v.py takes in the vocab, prepares three files: v.text unvowelized.txt vowelized.txt
python v.py vocab

v.fst is built by:
./fstcompile -isymbols=unvowelized.txt -osymbols=vowelized.txt v.text > v.fst

g.fst is built by using arpa2fst. The language model lm and the symbol table vowelized.txt are both in this directory, it was built by:
./arpa2fst --read-symbol-table=vowelized.txt lm g.fst

s.py repapres s.text by taking in a text file containing the unvowelized sentences, it only reads the first line for now:
python s.py debug_lines_nv

s.fst is built by:
~/bin/fstcompile --acceptor -isymbols=unvowelized.txt s.text > s.fst


Once the three FST's are built:

./fstclosure v.fst > cv.fst
(this is not needed, suggested by Hainan)
./fstcompose cv.fst g.fst > cvg.fst
./fstcompose s.fst cvg.fst > scvg.fst



Finds the shortest path by:
./fstshortestpath scvg.fsf short.fst

Prints the shortest path
./fstprint --isymbols=unvowelized.txt --osymbols=vowelized.txt short.fst
