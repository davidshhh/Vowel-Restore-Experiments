THE BASIC WORD IMPORTANCE IS OFF LINE AS WELL 
THE COMBINED MEASURE MIGHT NOT BE IF WE WANT TO WAIT WHAT THE USER HAS TYPED IN INTO THE SEARCH 
YEAH 
I'M NOT QUITE SO WHAT IT DID YOU WANT TO DO IT I YOU JUST WANTED TO ASSIGN 
UH I THOUGHT ABOUT WORDS 
MM 
MM OKAY 
YEAH BUT HOW ABOUT THOSE WORDS WHICH DON'T CARRY ANY MEANING AT ALL THE UM AND UHS AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE IF WE IF WE AVERAGE AVERAGE OVER OVER A WHOLE UTTERANCE ALL THE WORDS 
AND THERE ARE QUITE UNIMPORTANT WORDS IN THERE BUT QUITE IMPORTANT WORDS AS WELL I THINK WE SHOULD JUST DISREGARD THE THE 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
BUT THERE IS AN I. D. FOR AN UTTERANCE I THINK 
IT'S JUST FOR INDIVIDUAL WORDS 
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT THEN 
WE FOR UTTERANCES AS WELL 
I THINK IT'S JUST FOR ONE 
WORD 
SO WE HAVE TO 
YEAH 
UH I'M NOT QUITE SURE I HAVE ONLY SEEN THAT THE UH THE INDIVIDUAL WORDS HAVE GOT AN I. D. 
YEAH 
YOU ALWAYS COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE TIME STAMPS AND THEN TAKE THE ONES THAT UH BELONG TOGETHER IT FROM AN UTTERANCE 
YEAH IF THEY ARE ALREADY THERE'S IT'S EASY BUT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
YOU USE UH YOU SAID YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN UH IMPLEMENTING THE IDEA 
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU COMPUTING 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I W I W I WOULD NEED THE RAW TEXT PRETTY SOON BECAUSE I HAVE TO FIND OUT UM HOW I HAVE TO PUT THE SEGMENTS INTO BINS 
AND THEN YEAH 
NO THAT'S NOT NECESSARY 
YES I DID 
BUT UM I'VE ONLY JUST GET THE NOTES 
I HAVE TO STILL HAVE UH TO ORDER EVERYTHING BY THE TIME AND 
YEAH I THINK IT'S QUITE EASY AFTER THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO UH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH B I UH WE THAT'S WHAT I WAS UH THOUGHT 
THAT YOU JUST COMBINE THEM AND THEN ORDER THE TIME STAMPS ACCORDINGLY 
OKAY 
UM WHAT I FIND IT WAS THAT THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF THINGS WITHOUT WITHOUT US TIME STAMPS IN THE BEGINNING 
YEAH AND UH X. M. L. FILES 
YEAH THAT'S JUST AN I. D. OR SOMETHING 
I DON'T KNOW 
JUST NUMBERS 
YES BUT WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS THAT'S UH SOME KIND OF NUMBER 
IF MAYBE THE FILE NUMBER OR SOMETHING THAT IS IN THE BEGINNING 
WHAT IS THAT 
DO YOU KNOW 
UM I THINK THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF NUMBERS ON THE BEGINNING WHERE IN THERE IS IN TIME STAMP FOR THE NUMBERS 
IT'S 
THINK THEY SAY UM QUITE A LOT OF NUMBERS AND BEFORE THAT UH UM THERE'S THIS NUMBER 
WAS IT 
YEAH THERE I ARE NUMBERS ON THE UM THE W. TAG BUT THERE ARE IN TIME STAMPS 
YEAH 
YEAH IN THE BEGINNING AS WELL SOMETIMES I THINK 
AT LEAST I SAW SOME 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT WHAT IT IS IT ACTUALLY THAT NUMBERS 
OKAY SO BUT THERE ARE IN TIME STAMPS ANNOTATED AT THAT 
IT'S IT'S QUITE STRANGE 
AND ALSO UM THERE ARE DIFFERENT UM COMBINATIONS OF LETTERS 
B. R. I. AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO IT EVERYTHING ORDERED ARE THE TIME STAMPS GLOBAL OR UH ARE THEY LOCAL AT ANY POINT 
OKAY 
YEAH IT'S RAINBOW 
IT'S UM I THINK IT'S JUST THE DICTIONARY IN THE FIRST PLACE 
BUT 
UM NO I HAVE TO BIN IT UP AND SO I WILL ONLY HAVE COUNTS FOR EACH EACH BIN OR SOMETHING 
IT'S BECAUSE UM RAINBOW IS A TEXT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM 
AND I THINK IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE JUST ONE CLASS 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
MAYBE WE COULD 
YEAH SURE YOU SURE WE COULD DO THAT BUT I DON'T THAT MAKES SENSE 
IF WE NEED JUST FREQUENCIES MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST CALCULATE THEM BY USING PERL OR SOMETHING 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH IT'S QUITE EASY TO JUST COUNT AND SO ARE SORT THEM BY UM FREQUENCY 
JUST USING A PERL SCRIPT 
SO IT TOO BIG 
YEAH 
HMM 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HOW MANY TERMS YOU CAN HANDLE IN PERL 
MM YEAH 
UH I CAN GET ALL THE RAW TEXT BUT IT HAS TO BE ORDERED STILL 
SO 
NO IT ISN'T 
UM IT'S ON WHAT IS IMPLEMENTED IN RAINBOW IS INFORMATION GAIN AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THEY CALCULATE THAT 
YEAH 
OH THAT'S WHAT RAINBOW DOES 
I THINK YOU J CAN JUST GET PROBABILITIES FOR A CERTAIN WORDS FOR EACH DOCUMENT 
CERTAIN 
UM WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT 
MM-HMM 
OH 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT AS WELL THAT YOU THAT PROBABLY THE THE TOPIC SEGMENT LEVEL IS THE MOST UM INFORMATIVE FOR THE WORDS 
YEAH THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
I DON'T KNOW 
MM-HMM 
SO SHALL WE SIT TOGETHER TOMORROW THEN AS WELL 
OH OKAY 
UM YEAH WE WOULD TO BE BEST 
AT THE MOMENT IT'S IT'S JUST LINES OF 
MM-HMM 
UM 
OKAY 
SO UM YOU'D DO YOU EXTRACT THE WORDS THE RAW TEXT AS WELL 
OH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
PRINT OUT 
OKAY 
OKAY THAT 
OKAY 
SO HAVE WE ALREADY EXTRACTED FROM ALL THE FILES 
YEAH 
DID YOU ALSO ORDER 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
OKAY 
UH I DON'T NEED THE TIMES I JUST NEED THE WORDS 
BUT UM 
YEAH IN THE RIGHT ORDER 
YES 
YEAH THAT DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH I THINK 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
HOW LONG WOULD IT TOOK TO MAKE THE FREQUENCY COUNTS WITH A JAVA HASH TABLE 
YEAH 
NO HOW LONG YOU WOULD HAVE TO PROGRAM SOMETHING 
OKAY 
MM 
BECAUSE IT'S QUITE EASY IN PERL AS WELL IT'S JUST A LINE OF CODE FOR COUNTING ALL THE WORDS AND YEAH IT'S IT'S BY HASHES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
'KAY 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN IF WE JUST WANT TO HAVE UM SOME DATA FOR THE USER FACE COULD EVEN BE RANDOM DATA 
UH MM MM 
YEAH I'M 
HMM 
YES 
HMM YES 
HMM 
I'M NOT SO SURE 
I I THOUGHT WE WOULD JUST HAVE LIKE UM ONE BIG SUMMARY UM WITH ALL THE UH DIFFERENT IMPORTANCE LEVELS UM DISPLAYED ON IT 
AND DEPENDING ON WHAT ARE UM ZOOM LEVEL SO WE JUST DISPLAY A PART OF IT 
AND WE WOULD HAVE ONE VERY BIG THING OFF LINE 
AND FROM THAT WE WOULD JUST SELECT WHAT WE ARE DISPLAYING 
YES 
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU WOULD M GIVE A HIGH VALUE AT THIS UM SEQUENCES YOU WANT TO DISPLAY ON THE MEETING SERIES SUMMARY 
AND YOU JUST CUT OFF 
THAT WAS WHAT I SH I THOUGHT YEAH 
I THOUGHT 
BUT I THINK THE M DIFFERENCE MIGHT BE THAT WE WANT JUST WANT TO HAVE UM THE WORDS 
AND THAT'S NOT AS MUCH WHAT HE MEANT WITH NOT POSSIBLY LOADING EVERYTHING WAS THAT YOU M M LOAD ALL THE UH ANNOTATION STUFF 
ALL THE SOUND FILES ALL 
NO 
UM I RE I I'M GETTING QUITE LOST UM AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE UM W WHAT'S UM OUR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UM SO UM UH THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE AND THE SKIMMING 
I MEAN DO WE DO BOTH OR IS TO THE SAME THING 
OKAY 
SO BUT WHEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SUMMARIES YOU TALK ABOUT THIS UH BE ABOUT SKIMMING AND NOT BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH RIGHT ISN'T THAT THE SKIMMING 
ISN'T THAT THE SKIMMING 
YEAH BUT IT IS THE SAME DATA 
YEAH 
A 
AND YEAH I THINK WE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT COMBINING THAT MEASURE WITH UM THE MEASURES I GOT FROM UM SO UH HOT SPOTS AND SO NO 
SO THAT WOULD ALSO BE AN UTTERANCE LEVEL I THINK 
I THINK 
YES SURE 
YES 
YES RIGHT 
OOPS IT DOES 
SO I DEFINE BASELINE AND WHAT IT LOADS 
FOR EXAMPLE IT LOADS ALL THE UTTERANCES AND SO NO BUT IT DOESN'T LOAD UM THE DISCOURSE ACTS AND FOR EXAMPLE INTO THE AND WHAT'S WHAT ELSE THERE 
NOT THE SUMMARIES 
IT ONLY LOADS THOSE ON DEMAND 
YOU YOU MEAN THAT YOU UM BASICALLY SPLIT UP THE THE BIG THING INTO UM DIFFERENT SUMMARIES 
FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU HAVE A VERY UM TOP LEVEL UM SUMMARY AND A SEPARATE FILE FOR FOR EACH LEVEL 
MM-HMM 
YES 
NO UH NO NO IT'S F FOR 
NO YOU'RE RIGHT 
YEAH 
IT'S FOUR 
UM 
NO I I THINK WE WOULD JUST TAKE THE SEGMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY THAT WERE YEAH THERE'S UM THOSE SEGMENTS FILE 
UM YOU KNOW THE X. M. L. SEGMENTS 
OH 
THAT I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH THAT'S ME 
MM-HMM 
THERE THERE ARE TIME STAMPS UM FOR WELL 
SEGMENTS UM AND FOR THE UM SEGMENTS AS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA WHAT IS DISPLAYED ON ON LINE 
WHAT WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN THE HMM 
I THINK SO 
ISN'T 
UM FOR EX UM I I COMPARED TO WITH WHAT I DID FOR THE PAUSE UM DURATION EXTRACTION 
UM AND BASICALLY IT'S UH WORDS THAT ARE UTTERED IN A SEQUENCE WITHOUT PAUSES 
BUT SOMETIMES UM HOWEVER THERE ARE UM SHORT PAUSES IN IT AND THEY'RE INDICATED BY SQUARE BRACKETS PAUSE OR SOMETHING ON THE DATA 
UM SOMETI UH BUT UH THE ANNOTATORS DECIDED WHAT WAS ONE SEGMENT AND WHAT WASN'T 
I THINK SO 
YEAH BUT UM I THINK FOR SOME ANNOTATIONS UM AN UTTERA CA UTTERANCE CAN HAVE SEVERAL UM TYPES 
FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE DIALOGUE ACTS AND SO NO 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE FOR 
YEAH 
SHOULD BE YEAH 
YES BUT THAT'S 
YEAH EVERYTHING THAT'S A WORD HAS A SET TIME STAMP 
THAT'S AT THE END 
THAT'S AT THE AND I THINK HER TIME 
YEAH MAYBE 
DIDN'T HAVE A LOOK AT OUR MEETINGS 
UH I I THINK IT WOULDN'T IS IT OCCURS I MEAN IT WOULD BE IT OCCURS IN EVERY MEETING 
SO 
AND I THINK IT EVEN HAS UH ITS OWN ANNOTATION LIKE DIGITS OR SOMETHING 
SO THAT SHOULD BE REALLY EASY TO CUT OUT 
YEAH 
I'M SURE 
UH IT'S JUST TO TEST THE SYSTEM I THINK 
SO 
MM THEY HAVE TO READ NUMBERS FROM 
UH I DIDN'T HAVE A LOOK AT THAT 
SO 
THEY 
MM-HMM 
UH THE YEAH 
'KAY 
UM I JUST UM WONDERED SO WHO'S UH THEN DOING UM THE FREQUENCIES IN IN THE WORDS 
BECAUSE I'M I THINK I WILL ALSO UM I COULD ALSO MAKE SO IF IT UM FOR THE AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT THING 
BECAUSE I AM I IN MY OUTLINE I TALKED ABOUT UM USING THE UM DISCOURSE ACTS FIRST 
AND UM THEN ON THE CHUNKS OF TEXT I FOUND LOOKING FOR WORD PATTERNS AND SO NO 
SO UM I WOULD FOR EXAMPLE AND THE M MOST FREQ UM FREQUENT WORDS 
SO IF YOU CUT OFF ALL THAT I'D WON'T BE S OR 
YEAH I I BUT I NEED TO FOR MY CHUNKS THEN 
I WOULD 
YOU KNOW 
YEAH BUT I'D UH I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY OF WORDS IN MY UM IN THE REGIONS OF TEXT I FOUND OUT TO BE INTERESTING 
SO I WOULDN'T NEED TO 
IT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE RE CALCULATED ONLY FOR MY SEGMENTS 
HUH 
UH UH MM 
I THINK IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW L AS AS BIG TO USE THE HOT SPOT ANNOTATION THINGS 
THAT'S QUITE SMALL YEAH THAT'S SOME UTTERANCES 
YES 
YEAH YEAH 
SO I WOULD PROBABLY JUST CONCATENATE ALL MY UM TEXT CHUNKS AND THEN LET'S SAY UM I WILL RUN OVER IT 
YES 
YES DEFINITELY 
YEAH RIGHT 
YOU 
UM JASMINE UH UM WHAT IS UM THE TEXT YOU'RE EXTRACTING UH LOOKING LIKE THEN AT THE END 
BECAUSE UM I I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I DID FOR MY UM SPEAKER UM UH EXTRACTION AND I THINK I WOULD CH PERHAPS HAVE TO CHANGE TWO LINES OF CODES TO GET YOU UM FOR EACH MEETING A FILE THAT SAYS FR FROM UM THIS MILLISECOND TO THIS MILLISECOND THERE WAS THIS SEQUENCE OF WORDS 
AND SO NO 
SO THAT'S JUST CHANGING TWO LINES OF CODE 
AND IT WOULD GIVE YOU THAT 
SO 
UM YEAH 
SO FAR I EXTRACTED UM THE DURA DURATIONS 
BUT IT'S FROM THE WORDS FILE 
SO I COULD JUST UM CONTATENATE CONCATENATE UM THE WORDS INSTEAD OF THE DURATIONS AND IT SHOULD I MEAN 
SHOULD BE VERY 
STRAIGHT FORWARD 
I CAN TRY TO DO IT AND SEND IT TO YOU 
UP AND YOU HAVE A LOOK AT IT WILL TO MAKE SENSE FOR WHAT YOU WANT 
YEAH UH P I MEAN IT I JUST LET IT RUN OVER ALL THE FILES 
SO 
YES 
I JUST ORDERED 
UH I ORDERED ACCORDING TO THE UM STARTING TIMES OF THE UTTERANCES 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DIFFE 
YEAH I MEAN IT I I HAVE ON WHAT I GIVE YOU WOULD BE ONE FILE FOR EACH MEETING 
YEAH NOT FOR EACH MEETING SERIES 
I DIDN'T DO THAT YET 
YEAH ONE GROUP YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN THERE'S ONE SERIES THAT HAS JUST ONE MEETING 
YES 
UM THE YOU YOU THE DATA IS OF THE FRAME YOU HAVE UM THREE IDENTIFICATION LETTER 
SO B. I. D. OR B. B. D. OR SOMETHING AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE SAME GROUP 
AND THEN AFTER THAT THERE'S UM A NUMBER LIKE A. A. AN I. E. TWO 
SO IT'S A 
YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY QUITE EASY TO USE BECAUSE THEY'RE NAMED 
YES 
BUT I I MEAN SO UM THE START UH START TIMES UM START FOR EACH MEETING TO ZERO 
YOU COULD JUST PROBABLY JUST UM DID THE UM FINAL SECOND TIME TO THE NEXT MEETING AND SO ON AND JUST PUT IT ALL TOGETHER 
BUT THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE UM THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHO IN WHICH CHANNEL IT WAS SET UM IT BY WHICH PERSON IT WAS SET 
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY STORED IN ANOTHER X. M. L. DOCUMENT 
YEAH I WOU WOULD THEN JUST NOT PRINT OUT THE UM START AND END TIMES 
NO IT'S FOR EVERY SINGLE WORD 
OR FOR EVERY SINGLE UTTERANCE 
YEAH THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT 
YEAH BUT I DO IT WITH PERL IT'S JUST STRING MANIPULATION 
SO I WOULD I MEAN I WOULD JUST 
SURE 
NO I DIDN'T DO A S NO 
AND YOU WOULD WANT THAT ALL IN ONE FILE FOR ALL THE CORPUS 
OR 
FOR THE USERS 
YEAH I CAN DIRECTLY PUT IT INTO UH JUST LIKE 
SO UH ONLY WORDS UM PER MEETING SERIES 
UH-HUH 
YES 
YEAH THEY WILL JUST I WILL JUST TAKE I WOULD UH TAKE OVER THE NAMES THEY HAVE ANYWAY 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH ONE SERIES HAS THE UM SOME OTHER STARTING LETTERS 
SO 
SO ONLY WORDS AND WORDS AND TIMES 
AND YOU 
YEAH YOU WANT TO ORDERED 
OKAY 
OKAY ANYBODY 
UM ORD BASE DOT TIMES 
YEAH AND DO YOU WANT 
YEAH SOMETIMES THEY'RE CONTAINED IN IN ANOTHER 
SO 
JUST AFTER THE MM-HMM 
'KAY 
ORDERED 
ONLY WORDS 
UM AND I THINK UM FOR ALL THE CORPUS IT'S JUST FROM I KNOW FROM OTHER TIMES 
IT'S UM NINE MEGAMI BYTE TO HAVE I MEAN SHOULD BE SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO HAVE THE WORDS 
SHOULD BE 
NO UM ALL THE WORDS TOGETHER UM FOR ALL THE MEETINGS 
THAT'S WHAT I'M GUESSING THAT'S YOU KNOW 
UM WHAT I BECAUSE NINE MEGA BYTE IS WHAT I GOT FOR WHEN I USED FOR EVERY UM UTTERANCE THIS IS GOES FROM THERE IT THERE AND 
TAKES TAKES SECONDS 
OH 
YEAH I MEAN I'M IT DOING IT FOR ALL OF IT 
DOESN'T MATTER 
YEAH I MEAN I HOPE IT WILL BE THE SAME FOR THE WORDS 
IT'S JUST WHAT I 
MM-HMM 
MM 
SO SO UM I WILL PROBABLY SEND ME JUST ONE FILE OF THE FIRST MEETING UM AT ALL THOSE WHO NEED TO USE THAT YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK WHETHER THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT 
YEAH I MEAN IF IT'S JUST FOR ONE MEETING IT'S REALLY NOT TOO BIG 
YEAH 
WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE 
I I DRY READ IT THE LAST TIME 
NEXT WEEK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
OH MINE'S GONNA BE MOSTLY USING THE OFF LINE 
BUT THE ACTUAL STUFF IT'S DOING WILL BE ON LINE 
BUT IT WON'T BE VERY UM PROCESSOR INTENSIVE OR MEMORY INTENSIVE I DON'T THINK 
DON'T THINK SO 
YEAH 
ARE WE STILL GONNA GO FOR DUMPING IT INTO A DATABASE 
ARE WE STILL GONNA DUMP IT INTO A DATABASE 
'CAUSE IF WE ARE I RECKON WE SHOULD ALL READ OUR CLASSES OUT OF THE DATABASE 
IT'LL BE AS MUCH EASIER 
WELL IF WE'RE GONNA DUMP THE PART OF IT INTO A DATABASE ANYWAY 
WE MIGHT AS WELL DUMP ALL THE FIELDS WE WANT INTO THE DATABASE CALCULATE EVERYTHING FROM THERE 
THEN WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WORRY THAT MUCH ABOUT THE UNDERLYING X. M. L. REPRESENTATION 
WE CAN JUST QUERY IT 
WELL IF WE'RE GONNA DO THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND STORE EVERYTHING IN IN AN X. M. L. FORMAT AS WELL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL WE DON'T EVEN NEED TO DO THAT 'CAUSE IF WE GOT OUR INFORMATION DENSITY CALCULATED OFF LINE 
SO ALL WE DO IS TREAT THE WHOLE LOT AS ONE MASSIVE DOCUMENT 
I MEAN THEY'LL IT'S NOT GONNA BE SO BIG THAT WE CAN'T LOAD IN A INFORMATION DENSITY FOR EVERY UTTERANCE 
AND WE CAN JUST SUMMARISE BASED ON THAT 
I THINK YOU CAN DO IT ON LINE 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY MUCH POINT IN DOING LIKE THAT WHEN IT'S JUST GONNA FEED OFF IN THE AND THE INFORMATION DENSITY MEASURE BASICALLY 
AND THAT'S ALL CALCULATED OFF LINE 
SO WHAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING IS SORTING A LIST IS THE P COMPUTATIONALLY HARD PART OF IT 
WELL LIKE THE IDEAS WE'RE CALCULATING ARE INFORMATION DENSITY ALL OFF LINE FIRST FOR EVERY UTTERANCE IN THE WHOLE CORPUS RIGHT 
SO WHAT YOU DO SO YOU SAY IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SERIES OF MEETINGS YOU JUST SAY WELL OUR WHOLE DOCUMENT COMPRISES OF ALL THESE STUCK TOGETHER 
AND THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SORT THEM BY J INFORMATION DENSITY 
LIKE MAYBE WEIGHTED WITH THE SEARCH TERMS AND THEN EXTRACT THEM 
I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO SLOW TO DO ON LINE TO BE HONEST 
SO THAT 
YEAH 
WELL IN THE UTTERANCE LEVEL I WAS THINKING 
SO THE UTTERANCES WITH THE HIGHEST LIKE MAIN INFORMATION DENSITY 
WELL THE TROUBLE WITH DOING IT IN THE WORD LEVEL SO IF YOU WANT THE IDEA TO SYNCH UP 
YOU'VE GOT NO WAY OF GETTING IN AND EXTRACTING JUST THAT WORD 
I MEAN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
FOR EVERY SINGLE WORD 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL DO IT 
WE'LL HAVE TO BUFFER IT 
WELL THE SKIMMING'S GONNA USE THE IMPORTANCE 
BUT LOOK AT FIRST IT'S JUST GONNA BE I. D. F. 
WELL MOSTLY SKIMMING YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL THE NICE THING ABOUT THAT IS IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE IN SENTENCES 
WELL MORE OR LESS 
SO IT WILL MAKE MORE SENSE AND IF YOU GET JUST EXTRACT WORDS 
YEAH 
I SEE IT 
BUT IT'LL NEED TO BE CALCULATED AT WORD LEVEL THOUGH BECAUSE OTHERWISE THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH OCCURRENCES OF THE TERMS TO MAKE ANY MEANINGFUL SENSE 
YEAH 
YEAH I RECKON YOU CAN JUST MEAN IT OVER THE SENTENCE 
I THINK WE SHOULD FILTER THEM 
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE LIKE UM A CUT OFF 
SO IT A W WORD ONLY GETS A VALUE IF IT'S ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD 
SO ANYTHING THAT HAS LESS THAN SAY NOUGHT POINT FIVE IMPORTANCE GETS ASSIGNED TO ZERO 
YEAH THAT'S THE OTHER THE 
YEAH 
I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO BUFFER THE IDEA 
BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE VERY HARD 
I THINK IT WOULD BE LIKE AN HOUR OR TWO'S WORK 
LIKE JUST BUILD IN ANOTHER F WAVE FILE ESSENTIALLY 
YEAH I MEAN I BET THERE WOULD BE PACKAGES 
IN MEMORY YEAH 
SO JUST LIKE UNP THERE'S BOUND TO BE LIKE A MEDIA WAVE OBJECT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND JUST BUILD IN IN MEMORY 
I DON'T KNOW 
I HAVE AN IDEA 
BUT IT MUST HAVE LIKE CLASSES FOR DEALING WITH FILES 
AND IF IT HAS CLASSES FOR CONCATENATING FILES YOU CAN DO IT IN MEMORY 
SO 
WELL WHAT I THINK I MIGHT TRY AND BUILD SO BASICALLY A CLASS THAT YOU JUST FEED IT A LINKED LIST OF UM DIFFERENT WAVE FORMS 
AND IT WILL JUST STRING THEM ALL TOGETHER WITH MAYBE I DON'T KNOW TENTH OF A SECOND SILENCE IN BETWEEN EACH ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
NORMALISE IT YEAH 
OH YEAH YEAH WE'LL NEED THAT 
WE ALSO REALLY WANNA BE ABLE TO SEARCH BY WHO'S SPEAKING AS WELL 
IT DOESN'T MATTER 'CAUSE ALL THE CALCULATION'S DONE OFF LINE 
THAT'S EASY 
YOU JUST LIKE CREATE A NEW X. M. L. DOCUMENT IN MEMORY 
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE IF IT'S TOO BIG WHAT WE CAN DO IS JUST WELL ALL THE OFF LINE STUFF DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
AND ALL WE CAN DO IS JUST PROCESS A BIT AT A TIME 
LIKE FOR SUMMARISATION SAY WE WANTED A HUNDRED UTTERANCES IN THE SUMMARY JUST LOOK AT THE MEETING TAKE THE TOP ONE HUNDRED UTTERANCES IN EACH OTHER MEETING 
IF IT SCORES HIGHER THAN THE ONES ALREADY ON THE SUMMARY AS FAR JUST REPLACE THEM 
AND THEN YOU ONLY HAVE TO PROCESS ONE MEETING AT A TIME 
OKAY SO MAYBE WE SHOULD BUILD A B STORE A MENU MEASURE FOR THE SEGMENTS AND MEETINGS AS WELL 
AND SPEAKER 
SPEAKER AND UM TOPIC SEGMENTING WE'LL NEED AS WELL 
YEAH 
WELL YEAH AND THEN IT'LL F PRESERVE THE ORDER WHEN IT'S DISPLAYED THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK SO 
SO WE SHOULD BASICALLY MAKE OUR OWN X. M. L. DOCUMENT IN MEMORY 
THAT EVERYONE'S UM 
MODULE CHANGES THAT RATHER THAN THE UNDERLYING DATA 
AND THEN HAVE THAT X. M. L. UH NITE X. M. L. DOCUMENT TIED TO THE INTERFACE 
WELL YOU CAN MAKE IT IN A FILE IF YOU WANT 
MM-HMM 
THEY ARE UTTERANCES AREN'T THEY 
THE SEGMENTS ARE UTTERANCES AREN'T THEY 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT OKAY 
WELL THAT'S EASY 
WELL IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH ISN'T IT 
IT MAY NOT BE EXACT EVERY TIME BUT IT'S A IS SORT OF SIZE WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT WHY DON'T WE JUST WRITE IT IS A NEW X. M. L. FILE 
CAN NITE HANDLE JUST LOADING ARBITRARY UH NEW LIKE ATTRIBUTES AND STUFF 
I MEAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY'D MAKE IT ABLE TO 
YEAH 
SO WHY DO WE NEED TO HAVE TWO X. M. L. TREES IN MEMORY AT ONCE 
THE OTHER THING IS THAT WOULD MEAN WE'D BE USING THEIR PARSER AS WELL WHICH MEANS WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PARSE ANYTHING WHICH BE QUITE NICE 
'CAUSE THEIR PARSER IS PROBABLY MUCH FASTER THAN ANYTHING WE'VE COME UP WITH ANYWAY 
YEAH I MEAN WE CAN PROCESS IT IN CHUNKS IF IT GETS TOO BIG BASICALLY 
WE CAN JUST PROCESS AT ALL IN CHUNKS IF IT GETS TOO BIG TO LOAD IT INTO MEMORY 
I THINK WE PROBABLY WANT TO STORE SORRY 
I THINK WE PROBABLY WANT TO STORE UM A HIERARCHICAL INFORMATION DENSITY AS WELL 
SO LIKE AN INFORMAN MATION DENSITY SCORE FOR EACH MEETING AND EACH TOPIC SEGMENT 
'CAUSE OTHERWISE WE'D BE RECALCULATING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
YEAH 
AND THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY MAKE TOO MUCH EASIER TO DISPLAY 
WELL IT MAY NOT FOR THE WHOLE MEETING ABOUT LIKE 
YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH 
WELL WE CAN START OFF 
LIKE THAT 
WELL I WAS GONNA START OFF I'VE V GOT SORT OF HALF WAY THROUGH IMPLEMENTING ONE THAT DOES JUST I. D. F. 
AND THEN JUST I CAN CHANGE THAT TO WORK ON WHATEVER 
YEAH 
AND IT SHOULD BE WEIGHTED BY STUFF LIKE THE HOT SPOTS AND UM THE KEY WORDS IN THE SEARCH AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
DID UH NOT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT NAMED ENTITIES 
SO I THOUGHT HE SAID THERE WASN'T VERY MANY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S NOT T. F. I. D. F. IT'S JUST INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY 
'CAUSE IT'S REALLY EASY TO DO BASICALLY 
THERE'S JUST LIKE FOR A BASELINE REALLY 
WELL I'M HALF WAY THROUGH 
IT'S NOT WORKING YET BUT IT WILL DO 
UM YEAH 
AND THEN AVERAGING IT OVER THE UTTERANCES 
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE UM RELATED TO THE CORPUS AT ALL 
IT'S JUST WORKING ON AN ARBITRARY TEXT FILE AT THE MOMENT 
NO 
IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO KNOW HOW EVERYONE'S GONNA STORE OTHER THINGS THOUGH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I'VE GOT LIKE A FEW HOURS FREE 
LIKE AFTER THIS 
IT'S THE MOST BORING TASK 
YEAH 
OR AT LEAST UM SIMPLE VERSIONS OF THEM 
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY DOING SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE LIKE JUST DISPLAYING A WHOLE MEETING 
AND LIKE JUST BEING ABLE TO SCROLL THROUGH IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
OR YOU FOR AFTER THIS 
HOW ABOUT FRIDAY THEN 
'CAUSE I'M OFF ALL FRIDAY 
UH WEDNESDAY I'VE GOT A NINE 'TIL TWELVE 
YEAH NOTHING ON THE AFTERNOON 
I'VE GOT NOTHING ON THE AFTERNOON 
SO 
OKAY 
SO YOU UH YEAH 
WHERE BUT JUST IN APPLETON TOWER 
UH I'LL BE IN UM THE APPLETON TOWER ANYWAY 
UM WELL I'LL BE THERE FROM TWELVE 
I'VE GOT SOME OTHER STUFF THAT NEEDS DONE IN MATLAB SO IF YOU'RE NOT THERE AT TWELVE I CAN JUST WORK ON THAT 
SO 
YEAH 
WHY WE 
YEAH 
I'M JUST BUILDING A DICTIONARY 
OH MINE'S JUST GONNA USE THE UM HASH MAP IN IN UM JAVA 
'CAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA DO IT IN SMALL DOCUMENTS 
IT'S JUST LIKE BEF UNTIL THE INFORMATION DENSITY IS UP AND RUNNING 
JUST SOMETHING TO GET GIVE ME SOMETHING TO WORK WITH 
SO IT'S ONLY GONNA IS QUITE SMALL DOCUMENTS YOU USE TO START WITH 
WHY DOES IT NEED TO BE CLASSIFIED INTO LIKE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS 
CAN WE JUST FILL A SECOND CLASS WITH JUNK THAT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT 
LIKE I DON'T KNOW COPIES OF SHAKESPEARE OR SOMETHING 
'CAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR US THE UM FREQUENCY STATISTICS I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD BE CHANGED BY THE CLASSIFICATION 
I TH 
WELL THERE MAYBE ANOTHER TOOL AVAILABLE 
YEAH 
UM I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO'S GOT IT 
MIGHT BE WORDNET 
BUT ONE OF THIS BIG CORPUSES HAS A LIST OF STOP WORDS THAT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD AND THEY'RE JUST BASICALLY LISTS OF REALLY UNINTERESTING BORING WORDS THAT WE COULD FILTER OUT BEFORE WE DO THAT 
IT'S LIKE THAT'S IN THE PAPERS I READ 
THAT'S ME ON THINGS THEY DID RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING IS THEY'VE GOT THIS BIG S STOP LIST AND THEY JUST IGNORE ALL OF THOSE THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT 
YEAH I IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR ME AS WELL 
IT UH I THINK THAT'D BE USEFUL FOR ME AS WELL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL ALL YOU REALLY WANNA DO IS LIKE NOT GETTING SOME SUB SET OF THE ICSI CORPUS OFF THE DICE MACHINES 
'CAUSE I HATE WORKING ON DICE 
IT'S AWFUL 
LIKE SO I CAN USE MY HOME MACHINE 
UH HAS A C. D. BURNER THOUGH 
HAS A C. D. BURNER 
YEAH 
THE RIGHT HAND CORNER FAR RIGHT 
YEAH 
HOW BIG IS IT WITHOUT UM 
THE WAV FILES AND STUFF 
'CAUSE I COULD JUST EASY TO UM GOING OVER S. C. P. ONE NIGHT AND JUST LEAVE IT GOING ALL NIGHT IF I HAD TO 
IT'S YEAH I MEAN THE WAVE DATA ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT GONNA GET OFF THERE COMPLETELY 
REALLY 
OH RIGHT 
I'LL SEE IF I CAN S. C. P. IT I SUPPOSE 
I'VE GOT A LINUX BOX AND A WINDOWS BOX 
SO 
BROAD BAND 
PUT IT ON TO C. D. 
I CAN IF I GET DOWN I CAN PUT IT C. D. 
YEAH 
I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE 
SO HOW MUCH DO WE GOT 
REALLY 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT I CAN DO IT FROM THAT SESSION CAN'T I 
YOU CAN COMPRESS IT FROM A REMOTE SESSION AND S. C. P. IT FROM THE SAME SESSION 
DO YOU THINK 
YEAH 
OH NO NO I WAS THINKING OF SSHING JUST NOT SOME MACHINE AND THEN JUST SCPING IT FROM THERE 
YEAH 
I MEAN IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE GATEWAY 
BUT 
CAN YOU NOT DO THAT 
MM I SEE 
YEAH 
SO YOU COULD JUST 
BUT THE FIRST UH HOW BIG OR THE CHUNKS 
HOW BIG OR THE CHUNKS YOU'RE LOOKING AT 
IS QUITE SMALL THEN 
SO YOU COULD JUST UM YOU COULD USE JUST THE SAME THING WE USED TO BUILD THE BIG DICTIONARY 
YOU JUST DO THAT ONE LINE 'CAUSE THAT WON'T TAKE LONG TO BUILD A LITTLE DICTIONARY THAT BIG WELL IT 
I MEAN JUST USE THE SAME TOOL THAT WE USE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT DOESN'T NEED ORDERED NO 
UM WELL THAT'S THE IT OR YOU USING T. F. I. D. F. FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY 
ALRIGHT OKAY 
LIKE 'CAUSE FREQUENCY WOULD BE USEFUL I THINK 
BUT UM DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT THE SIZE AND WHAT WE CONSIDER A DOCUMENT IN THE SENSE OF CALCULATING T. F. I. D. F. IS GONNA CHANGE 
WHICH MIGHT NEED THINKING ABOUT 
I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL YEAH 
WELL YOU NEED THE RAW FREQUENCY AS WELL 
BUT UM 
YOU ALSO AND HOW MANY TIMES THINGS OCCUR WITHIN EACH DOCUMENT 
AND UM WHAT WE CONSIDER A DOCUMENT'S GONNA DEPEND ON OUR CONTEXT I THINK 
'CAUSE IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE LOT OF MEETINGS WE'LL CONSIDER EACH MEETING A DOCUMENT IN SORT OF TERMS OF THIS ALGORITHM 
AND IF WE'RE VIEWING LIKE SAY JUST A SMALL TOPIC SEGMENT YOU MIGHT LOOK AT EVEN EACH UTTERANCE AS A SMALL DOCUMENT 
YEAH BUT THE THING IS UM 
IT'S GONNA NEED SOME TH TH THOUGHT OF HOW WE 
ACTUALLY MAYBE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER 
MAYBE IF YOU JUST DO IT NICE TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL IT IT WILL BE FINE 
BUT I WAS JUST THINKING IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE THE T. F. I. D. F. OFF LINE FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT LEVELS WE MIGHT WANT 
'CAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA ALLOW DISJOINT SEGMENTS FOR EXAMPLE THEN HOW ARE WE GONNA KNOW WHAT'S GONNA BE IN CONTEXT AT ANY GIVEN TIME 
BUT I SUPPOSE IF YOU JUST ADD IT GLOBALLY TREATING A MEETING IS A DOCUMENT 
IT'D PROBABLY STILL BE WORK OUT FINE BECAUSE YOU'D ONLY BE COMPARING TO ONES WITHIN THE CONTEXT 
UH I DON'T KNOW I THOUGHT WERE YOU GONNA USE THAT IN THE END 
THE INFORMATION DENSITY 
OH SORRY THAT'S WHAT I MEAN 
LIKE UM YEAH FOR EACH WORD OR WHATEVER BUT ACROSS THE WHOLE LOT SO WHAT I MEAN BY HIGHEST LEVEL 
LIKE ACROSS THE WHOLE CORPUS 
YEAH BUT YOU'D PROBABLY LOOK AT EACH MEETING IS A DOCUMENT 
MM POSSIBLY 
ARE THEY BIG ENOUGH TO GET ANYTHING MEANINGFUL OUT OF 
WELL YEAH THAT IS NOT IT'S NOT AN ISSUE 
YOU JUST CONCATENATE AN X. M. L. FILE TOGETHER 
BUT WE STILL WANT TO HAVE LIKE A NOTION OF MEETINGS FOR THE USER 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH YOU JUST LIKE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO LOOK AT YOU JUST JAM TOGETHER INTO AN X. M. L. FILE AND THAT'S YOUR MEETING 
EVEN THOUGH BITS OF IT MAY COME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE OR WHATEVER 
I MEAN I DON'T SEE WHY THAT'S REALLY A BIG PROBLEM 
SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU CAN TAKE AN ARBITRARY AMOUNT OF DATA AND PROCESS IT WITH THE SAME ALGORITHM 
IT DOESN'T MATTER CONCEPTUALLY WHAT THAT DATA IS 
IT COULD BE A MEETING 
IT COULD BE TWO UTTERANCES 
IT COULD BE A MEETING PLUS HALF A MEETING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE 
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT THOUGH 
I MEAN WHAT YOU DO SO YOU JUST BUILD AN X. M. L. FILE AND IF YOU WANT TO TO GET DOWN TO THE UTTERANCES YOU'D GO TO THE LEAVES 
AND THEN IF YOU WANTED THE NEXT LEVEL UP 
YOU'D GO TO THE PARENTS OF THIS AND LIKE JUST GO FROM LIKE THE LEAVES INWARDS TOWARDS THE BRANCH TO BUILD UP THINGS LIKE UM YOU KNOW 
WHEN YOU CLICK ON A SEGMENT IT'S GONNA HAVE LIKE WORDS OR WHATEVER THAT ARE IMPORTANT 
AS LONG AS LIKE THE ALGORITHMS ARE DESIGNED UM WITH IT IN MIND I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY BIG PROBLEM 
WELL LIKE SAY YOU HAD UM LIKE SAY FOR A MEETING RIGHT YOU'VE GOT LIKE UH SAY A HIERARCHY THAT LOOKS QUITE BIG LIKE THIS 
AND LIKE THE UTTERANCES COME OFF OF HERE MAYBE 
THEN WHEN WHATEVER YOUR ALGORITHM IS DOING AS LONG AS WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH UTTERANCES YOU GO FOR ALL THE LEAVES 
LIKE THEN IF YOU NEED SOMETHING NEXT UP IS LIKE A TOPIC SEGMENT YOU'D GO TO HERE 
BUT IF YOU WERE LOOKING TO SAY THIS ONE IS ONLY WANT LIKE THIS 
RIGHT SO YOU IT'S SAME YOU'D START WITH THE LEAVES AND YOU GO UH I WANT A TOPIC SEGMENT 
SO I GO ONE LAYER UP 
SO AND THEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH JUST A TOPIC SEGMENT IN THERE IT'S THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
AND LIKE EACH TIME YOU WANT A HIGHER LEVEL YOU JUST NEED TO GO UP THE TRUE 
AND AS LONG AS YOUR ALGORITHM RESPECTS THAT THEN WE CAN JUST 
PROCESS ANY ARBITRARY X. M. L. 
FILE WITH WHATEVER HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE WE WANT 
A MEETING SAY AND THAT WOULD BE A TOPIC SEGMENT 
SO I THINK AS LONG AS YOU BUILD AN ALGORITHM THAT RESPECTS WHATEVER STRUCTURE'S IN THE FILE RATHER THAN IMPOSING ITS OWN STRUCTURE 
WELL IN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 
BUT I MEAN IT COULD BE SO MANY NODES AS YOU WANT 
LIKE THIS ONE COULD BE DEEPER MAYBE 
EASY 
SO THEN YOU'D START WITH ALL YOUR UTTERANCES HERE AND WHEN YOU GO UP TO GET TOPIC SEGMENTS YOU GO TO HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE 
THAT MIGHT BE A BIT CONFUSING THOUGH 'CAUSE YOU HAVE THINGS IN DIFFERENT LEVELS 
WELL WEDNESDAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET LIKE A MINI BROWSER JUST DISPLAYS TWO THINGS SYNCHED TOGETHER OF SOME KIND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'D BE USEFUL 
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU SEE ABOUT THAT THOUGH 
I DO HAVE AN IDEA 
I'VE PROBABLY GET A REASONABLE AMOUNT BECAUSE UM EVERYTHING IN MY DICE ACCOUNT CAN ACTUALLY BE DELETED 'CAUSE I STARE AT ALL AT HOME AS WELL 
SO THAT GUARANTEED TO STAY THE 
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEND A SUPPORT FORM 
JUST SAY WE WANT SOME WEB SPACE 
LISTEN TO 
YEAH 
'CAUSE THAT'D BE REALLY USEFUL SO IF WE HAD A BIG DIRECTORY 
ESPECIALLY FOR TRANSFERRING STUFF 
HAVING SAID THAT ARE WE ALLOWED TO TAKE A COPY OF THE ICSI CORPUS 
SOMETHING WE SHOULD PROBABLY ASK BEFORE WE DO IT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
NO UM ANOTHER 
MIGHT BE FUNNY TO SEE WHAT IS SUMMARISED THE WHOLE CORPUS SO ANYWAY 
I THINK IT'D BE VERY USEFUL 
WE CAN JUST CHANGE THE CODE 
SO THAT IT 
THAT'S QUITE GOOD 
YEAH 
I COULD JUST USE IT WITH THE FREQUENCY I THINK UNTIL THE INFORMATION DENSITY THING'S FINISHED 
THAT WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL 
IF YOU'RE DOING IT IN JAVA COULD YOU UM SERIALIZE THE OUTPUT AS WELL AS WRITING IT IT A FILE 
IF YOU'RE DOING IT IN JAVA COULD YOU SERIALIZE THE UM DICTIONARY YEAH AS WELL AS WRITING IT IT A FILE 
IT'S REALLY EASY 
I DON'T SEE WHY IT'D BE ANY MORE MASSIVE THAN THE FILE 
YEAH 
IT JUST SAVES YOU PARSING THE UM 
FILE REPRESENTATION OF IT 
AND NOW 'CAUSE I WOULD BE USING IT IN JAVA ANYWAY 
SO I'D JUST BE BUILDING THE DATA STRUCTURE AGAIN 
YEAH BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A BIT SILLY TO BE PARSING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN KINDA THING 
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT UM I THINK ALL THE COLLECTIONS AND THINGS IMPLEMENT SERIALIZABLE ALREADY 
I THINK THEY MIGHT DO 
TONIGHT I'LL TRY AND UM I'LL EITHER WORK SOME MORE IN UH THE T. F. I. D. F. SUMMARIZER OR DO THE AUDIO THING 
YEAH 
DO WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE SOMETHING NEXT WEEK 
YEAH 
YEAH I KNOW 
I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE WE HAD TO SPECIFY IT OURSELVES THAT IT'S NOT SO UM LIKE FOCUS THE SPECIFICATION OF MOST UM WORK WE HAVE TO DO 
YEAH 
ONCE WE START DOING IT IT WILL ALL BECOME MORE OR LESS OBVIOUS I THINK ANYWAY 
OKAY 
DOES ANYONE WANT TO USE UH STEVE'S FEEDBACK FROM THE SPECIFICATION 
RIGHT 
NOT REALLY UM JUST WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT LIKE DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND 
LIKE DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND STUFF AND UM YEAH 
HE WAS SAYING THAT WE SHOULD MAYBE UH THINK ABOUT HAVING A PROTOTYPE FOR WEEK SIX WHICH IS NEXT WEEK 
YEAH 
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY PRIORITIZE OUR PACKAGES 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
HAS HAS ANYONE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THE JAVA CODE FOR THE HUH 
HMM 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH I I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY THAT MIGHT BE ONLINE 
DEPENDS HOW IT'S GONNA WORK 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE 
HMM 
HMM 
YEAH YOU JUST CONCATENATE THEM TOGETHER 
HMM 
YEAH 
IT JUST MEANS IT LOADS ON DEMAND 
IT ONLY LOADS WHEN IT NEEDS A PARTICULAR TYPE OF FEEL 
LIKE WHEN IT'S BEING ACCESSED 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE IDEA TO JUST LOADS THE PARTICULAR ONES IT NEEDS 
BUT IF YOU WERE DOING A SEARCH OVER THE WHOLE CORPUS YOU'D HAVE TO LOAD THEM ALL 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
YEAH WE DO NOT WANT TO ONE TO DEVELOP A LITTLE TREE DISPLAY AS WELL FOR MULTIPLE RESULTS 
YEAH BUT THAT'D BE QUITE EASY TO DO 
YOU JUST NEED TO FIND THE TIME STAMP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK I THINK THOSE SEGMENTS FOR EACH UTTERANCE ARE SPLIT UP 
THINK SO 
YEAH I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S ALREADY THERE 
PRETTY SURE THAT'S ALREADY THERE 
THE THE UTTERANCES ARE NUMBERED 
HMM 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YE THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I GOT YEAH 
OH 
HMM 
YOU 
MM 
YEAH UH 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
TOPICS YEAH 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT ONE 
HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
HMM 
YEAH THAT'D BE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO DO THAT 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT IN JAVA YEAH 
YEAH 
HUH 
HMM 
YEAH I'VE HAD A B I'VE HAD A LOOK AT THE THE TOPIC SEGMENTS HOW IT'S STORED 
AND THEN YEAH TH THOSE ARE FEW PER MEETING AND IT UM WELL 
IT GIVES A TIME STAMP AND INSIDE EACH ONE THERE'S UH THE ACTUAL LIKE UTTERANCE SEGMENTS 
AND THE LIST OF THEM THAT OCCURRED 
AND THEY'RE ALL NUMBERED 
UM SO THAT'S WHERE THAT'S STORED 
YEAH 
SO I GUESS UM IF I'M GONNA BE SEGMENTING IT WITH A L. C. SEG THEN THAT'S LIKE SOME FORMAT I'D WANT TO UM PUT IT BACK TO ONE SO IT'D BE EQUIVALENT 
WELL LIKE THE INTEGRATION 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INTEGRATION 
HMM 
I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S BEEN ALLOCATED TO DO THAT YET 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
HMM YEAH 
YEAH IT C COULD BE DIFFICULT YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I GUESS THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET THE CRUCIAL M MODULES BUILT 
Y YEAH 
YEAH AND THEN 
YEAH AND THEN WE'LL MAYBE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE SOMEBODY NOT JUST INTEGRATING IT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I THINK SO 
OH YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
JASMINE I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU'D UH LOOKED AT EXTRACTING THE TEXT 
YEAH 
SO YOU YOU SAID YOU DID IT IN PYTHON YEAH 
YEAH DID YOU USE UH B THE X. L. UH X. M. L. PARSER IN PYTHON 
RIGHT 
YEAH SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD 
SO UM 'CAUSE YEAH 
I WAS HAVING A LOOK ON IT A LOOK AT IT AS WELL AND I NOTICED THE UM THE SPEAKERS ARE ALL IN THAT SEPARATE FILE 
SO DID DID YOU HAVE TO COMBINE THEM ALL AND AND THEN RE ORDER THEM 
YEAH 
Y YEAH C 
RIGHT 
YEAH SO THAT'S APPROACH UM WELL I WAS GOING TO DO 
SO YEAH WE MAY AS WELL COLLABORATE 
IN THE WORD FILES 
I'M NOT SURE I WHAT YOU MEAN 
OH RIGHT 
HMM 
HMM 
MM I THOUGHT THEY WERE LOCAL AT THE A PARTICULAR MEETING 
HMM 
MM IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE SHOULD DISCUSS 
YEAH SHOULD WE NOT HAVE LIKE A GROUP DIRECTORY OR SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN PUT ALL OUR CODE ON AND THAT KINDA THING 
HMM 
I'VE GOTTEN MM HARDLY ANY 
HMM 
YEAH WE CAN ASK STEVE IF UM WE CAN GET SPACE 
YEAH UH WE COULD DO THAT 
YEAH I'M SURE HE HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT LAST YEAR 
YEAH 
HMM 
THAT SOUNDS GOOD 
HMM 
HMM 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA NEED 
YES 
YEAH IT'S JUST UM CHANGING IT A BIT 
YEAH 
NO BUT UH THAT'S WHAT M. L. C. SEG DOES 
IT IT MARKS THE END OF EACH SEGMENT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH FOR ME IT'S BETTER IF THEY'RE BY MEETING 
THEN THAT'LL BE REALLY EASY TO DO ONCE THEY'VE GOT THE RAW TEXT 
IT'S JUST A CASE OF RUNNING THE SCRIPT 
YEAH I MEAN HOPEFULLY THIS WEEK 
ALRIGHT 
AND WE COULD 
DON'T KNOW 
SUPPOSE WE'RE JUST GETTING IN WITH ALL OR 
COMPONENTS 
SO 
I KNOW 
WE 
YEAH 
YEAH HE SUGGESTED THAT WE COULD HAVE AN UH INITIAL PROTOTYPE 
I KNOW I'D B I'D BE SURPRISED IF WE CAN GET ANYTHING WORKING BY NEXT WEEK 
ALRIGHT 
'KAY 
GOSH 
'KAY 
SO THERE MUCH MORE ON IT THEN UH DO 
SO THERE MUCH MORE ON IT THEN HE SAID YESTERDAY 
MM 
HMM 
HMM 
YEAH NOW I'D SAY F FOR THE PROTOTYPE IF WE JUST LIKE WHEREVER POSSIBLE P CHUNK IN THE STUFF THAT WE HAVE UM PRE ANNOTATED AND STUFF 
AND FOR THE STUFF THAT WE DON'T HAVE PRE ANNOTATED WRITE LIKE A STUPID BASELINE 
THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE ABLE TO BASICALLY THAT MEANS WE FOCUS ON ON THE INTERFACE FIRST SORT OF 
SO THAT WE WE TAKE THE THE READY MADE PARTS AND JUST SEE HOW WE GET THEM WORK TOGETHER ON THE INTERFACE THE WAY WE WANT AND AND THEN WE HAVE A WORKING PROTOTYPE 
AND THEN WE CAN GO BACK AND REPLACE PIECES EITHER BY OUR OWN COMPONENTS ARE BY MORE SOPHISTICATED COMPO PO COMPONENTS OF OUR OWN 
SO IT'S PROBABLY FEASIBLE 
THE THING SO I'M AWAY THIS WEEKEND 
SO THAT'S FOR ME 
OH YEAH UM YEAH 
NO 
BUT ALSO I MIGHT LIKE THE THE SIMILARITY THING LIKE MY JUST MY MATRIX ITSELF FOR MY STUFF 
I C I I THINK I CAN DO THAT FAIRLY QUICKLY BECAUSE I HAVE THE ALGORITHMS 
YEAH I THINK TODAY'S MEETING IS REALLY THE ONE WHERE WE WHERE WE SORT OF SETTLE DOWN THE DATA STRUCTURE AND AS SOON AS WE HAVE THAT 
UH PROBABLY LOOK AFTER TODAY'S MEETING WE THEN ACTUALLY NEED TO 
WELL GO BACK FIRST OF ALL AND LOOK AT NITE X. M. L. TO USE ON HOW FAR THAT THAT WHICH WE WANT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THAT WHICH NITE X. M. L. OFFERS US 
AND THEN JUST SORT OF EVERYONE MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THE INTERFACE 
SO I THINK OF TODAY WE DECIDE ON WHAT DATA WE WANNA HAVE NOW AND AND LATER MAYBE EVEN TODAY 
WE GO AND LOOK AT NITE X. M. L. OR SOME OF US LOOK AT NITE X. M. L. IN A BIT MORE DETAIL 
JUST TRYING TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF THAT CODE AND SEE HOW DOES THE REPRESENTATION WORK ON THEIR SYSTEM 
AND THEN SORT OF WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO THEN SAY OKAY THAT TYPE OF NITE X. M. L. DATA WE WANNA LOAD INTO IT 
AND THIS IS HOW EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT AND THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO FROM THERE 
NO 
I'VE LOOKED LOOKED AT THE DOCUMENTATION AND IN LIKE SEEN ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK THAT WE WANT TO USE THE NITE X. M. L. FRAMEWORK BECAUSE UM THEY HAVE A GOOD A EVENT MODEL THAT SYNCHRONIZES SORT OF THE DATA AND AND EVERY DISPLAY ELEMENT 
SO THAT TAKES A LOT OF WORK AWAY FROM US 
SORT OF THAT WOULD BE A REASON FOR STAYING WITHIN THEIR FRAMEWORK AND USING THEIR GENERAL CLASSES 
BUT BEYOND THAT I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT AT AT ALL WHICH IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD REALLY DO 
WHO ACTUALLY LOOK FOR THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION I MEAN WHO OF US IS DOING STUFF THAT IS HAPPENING ON LINE AND WHO OF US IS DOING STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING OFF LINE 
LIKE MY DATA IS COMING C 
HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
'KAY 
SO BASICALLY APART FROM THE DISPLAY MODULE THE I THE DISPLAY ITSELF 
WE DON'T HAVE AN EXTREMELY HIGH DEGREE OF INTERACTION BETWEEN SORT OF OUR MODULES THAT CREATE THE STUFF AND AND THE INTERFACE 
SO THE INTERFACE IS MAINLY WHILE IT'S RUNNING JUST WORKING ON DATA THAT'S JUST LOADED FROM A FILE I GUESS 
THERE ISN'T 
YEAH I KNOW 
THE YEAH THE SEARCH SO I GUESS THE SEARCH IS SORT OF A STRANGE BEAST ANYWAY BECAUSE FOR THE SEARCH WE'RE LEAVING THE NITE X. M. L. FRAMEWORK 
UM BUT THAT'S STILL SORT OF THAT'S GOOD 
THAT MEANS THAT AT LEAST LIKE WE DON'T HAVE THE TYPE OF SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY HAS TO DO LIKE A BILLION CALCULATIONS ON ON DATA ON LINE 
'CAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE LIKE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT OUR INTERFACE FOR THE DATA WOULD HAVE TO BE A LOT MORE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW IT PERFORMS AND AND EVERYTHING 
AND NOBODY IS MODIFYING THAT DATA AT IT ON LINE TIME AT ALL IT SEEMS 
NOBODY'S MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL DATA ON LINE 
SO THAT'S ACTUALLY MAKING IT A LOT EASIER 
THAT BASICALLY MEANS OUR BROWSER REALLY IS A VIEWER MOSTLY 
WHICH ISN'T DOING MUCH WITH THE DATA EXCEPT FOR SORT OF SELECTING A PIECE PIECE OF IT AND AND DISPLAYING IT 
HMM 
WELL SOME PARTS RELEVANT FOR THE SEARCH YES 
I'D SAY SO 
HMM 
YEAH BUT NOBODY OF US IS DOING MUCH OF SEARCHING FROM THE DATA ON THE ON LINE STAGE 
AND FOR ALL TOGETHER LIKE THE DISPLAY ITSELF 
I THINK WE ARE SURE IF WE IF IT'S SITTING ON THE X. M. L. THEN IF IT'S SITTING ON THE S. Q. L. STUFF BECAUSE IF IT'S SITTING ON THE X. M. L. 
WE HAVE THE THE NITE X. M. L. FRAMEWORK WITH ALL ITS FUNCTIONALITY FOR SYNCHRONIZING THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT LEVELS WHENEVER THERE'S A CHANGE WHENEVER SOMETHING'S MOVING FORWARD AND STUFF 
AND WE CAN JUST MORE OR LESS LOOK AT THEIR CODE LIKE HOW THREE PLAYER MOVES FORWARD 
AND HOW THAT MOVING FORWARD IS REPRESENTED IN DIFFERENT WINDOWS AND STUFF 
SO I THINK IN THE ACTUAL BROWSER ITSELF I DON'T WANNA SIT ON THE S. Q. L. IF WE CAN SIT ON THE X. M. L. BECAUSE SITTING ON THE X. M. L. WE HAVE ALL WE HAVE AS MUCH HELP 
AND FOR YOU FOR LIKE THE P THE CALCULATIONS THAT WE'RE DOING APART FROM THE SEARCH IT SEEMS THAT EVERYONE NEEDS SOME SPECIAL REPRESENTATIONS ANYWAY 
YOU MEAN OUR RESULTS 
YEAH IN IN THE NITE X. M. L. X. M. L. FORMAT AS WITH THEIR TIME STAMPS AND STUFF IS THAT IT'S EASY TO TO TIE TOGETHER ST THINGS 
WHAT I'M LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SO IF WE GO WITH THIS MULTI LEVEL IDEA 
LIKE THIS IDEA THAT SORT OF IF YOU START WITH A WHOLE MEETING SERIES AS ONE ENTITY AS ONE THING THAT YOU DISPLAY IS ONE WHOLE SORT OF 
THAT THEN THE INDIVIDUAL CHUNKS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WHEREAS AND THEN YOU CAN CLICK ON A MEETING 
AND THEN SORT OF THE MEETING IS THE WHOLE THING AND THE CHUNKS ARE THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS 
THAT MEANS SORT OF WE HAVE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF OF REPRESENTATION WHICH WE PROBABLY 
IF WE IF WE DO IT THIS WAY LIKE WE IF WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THAT IF WE DO IT THIS WAY 
THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY FIND SOME ABSTRACTION MODEL 
SO THAT THE INTERFACE ON THE SENSE LIKE DEALS WITH IT IS IF IT'S SAME AS THAT THE INTERFACE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO WORRY WHETHER IT'S A MEETING IN THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES OR A SEGMENT WITHIN A MEETING 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
AND THAT'S PROBABLY STUFF THAT WE HAVE TO SORT OF LIKE PROCESS TWICE THEN 
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THAT LIKE THE SUMMARY OF A MEETING WITHIN THE WHOLE MEETING CORPUS OUR MEETING SERIES Y IS MEETING SERIES A GOOD WORD FOR THAT 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HOW TO CALL IT 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE NOT NOT THE WHOLE CORPUS BUT EVERY MEETING THAT HAS TO DO WITH ONE TOPIC 
UM SO IN IN THE MEETING SE SERIES IS THAT A SUMMARY FOR A MEETING WITHIN THE MEETING SERIES ARE SORT OF 
COMPILED OFF LINE BY A SUMMARY MODULE 
AND THAT IS SEPARATE FROM A SUMMARY OF A SEGMENT WITHIN A MEETING 
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK WE CAN 
SO ARE WE DOING THAT AT ALL LEVELS 
ARE WE UM 
AND JUST HAVE DIFFERENT LIKE FINE GRAINEDNESS LEVELS SORT OF 
MM 
'KAY 
SO THE ONLY THING THAT YEAH SO THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN BASICALLY IF I DOUBLE CLICK LET'S SAY FROM THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES IN A SINGLE MEETING 
SO THAT THE ZOOM LEVEL CHANGES 
LIKE THE THE THE START AND THE END POSITION CHANGES AND THE ZOOM LEVEL CHANGES 
I I THOUGHT WE COULDN'T DO THAT 
LIKE I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT WE COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE COULDN'T LOAD THE DATA FOR ALL THAT 
BUT I DON'T KNOW I MEAN THAT 
SO I'M IS NOT SURE IF I GET IT 
I WAS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO 
OKAY 
I W I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE TOTAL MEMORY COMPLEXITY OF IT 
BUT I I COMPLETELY ADMIT I MEAN I JUST SORT OF LIKE THE TAKE THAT FROM SOME THING THAT JONATHAN ONCE SAID ABOUT NOT LOADING EVERYTHING 
BUT MAYBE I WAS JUST WRONG ABOUT IT 
HOW MANY UTTERANCES W 
YEAH AND I W YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WHAT WE HAVE SO WE WOULD HAVE A WORD 
LIKE WE WOULD HAVE WORDS WITH SOME PRIORITY LEVELS 
AND THEY WOULD BASICALLY BE BECAUSE EVEN THE SELECTION WOULD WOULD THE SUMMARIES AUTOMATICALLY FEED FROM JUST HOW PRIORITIZED AN INDIVIDUAL WORD OR HOW INDIV UH PRIORITIZED AN INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCE IS 
OR I ARE THE SUMMARIES SORT OF REFINED FROM IT AND MADE BY A MACHINE TO MAKE SENTENCES AND STUFF 
OR ARE THEY JUST SORT OF TAKING OUT THE WORDS WITH THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AND THEN THE WORDS OF THE SECOND HIGHEST PRIORITY 
AND THE U OKAY 
ARE WE DOING IT IN THE THE WHOLE THING IN THE UTTERANCE LEVEL 
OR ARE WE DOING IT ONE WORD LEVEL LIKE THE INFORMATION DENSITY CALCULATION 
W I THINK WE HAVE START AND END TIMES FOR WORDS ACTUALLY BUT IT'S YEAH 
BUT IT UM IT MIGHT SEE BUT IT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY IN THE PLAYER 
WE SHOULD REALLY MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT TOGETHER AT SOME POINT TODAY THAT WE CHECK OUT HOW THE PLAYER WORKS 
BUT THERE'S MAYBE SOME MERIT IN ALTOGETHER DOING IT IN AN UTTERANCE LEVEL IN THE END 
SO 
YEAH 
WELL BUT ALSO ABOUT THE DISPLAYS I MEAN THE DISPLAYS IN THE ON THE TEXT BODY 
IN THE ON THE LATEST DRAFT THAT WE HAD SORT OF WE COME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT IT ISN'T DISPLAYING UTTERANCE FOR UTTERANCE 
BUT IT'S ALSO DISPLAYING UH A SUMMARISED VERSION ONE YOU KNOW LIKE BELOW THE BELOW THE GRAPH THE PART 
MAYBE 
YEAH OR 
HMM 
OH YEAH IF IT'S JUST LIKE THERE THERE'S LIKE AUDIO SKIMMING AND THERE'S DISPLAYED SKIMMING 
YEAH 
UM MAYBE THERE'S SOME MERIT OF GOING ALTOGETHER FOR UTTERANCE LEVEL AND NOT EVEN BOTHER TO CALCULATE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT INTERNALLY 
THEN YOU CAN DO IT 
BUT MAYBE LIKE NOT EVEN STORE THE IMPORTANCE LEVELS FOR INDIVIDUAL WORDS AND JUST SORT OF RANK UTTERANCES AS A WHILE 
HMM 
YEAH 
'CAUSE IT IT MIGHT BE BETTER SKIMMING AND LESS MEMORY REQUIRED AT THE SAME TIME 
AND I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT FOR INDIVIDUAL WORDS THEN YOU CAN JUST IN THE WORST CASE 
IF YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING ELSE JUST SORT OF MAKE THE MENU OF THE WORDS OVER THE UTTERANCE 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
W IT'S IT'S 
WELL WHAT'S THE SMALLEST CHUNK AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE THINKING OF OF ASSIGNING AN IMPORTANCE MEASURE IT IS IT A WORD OR IS IT AN UTTERANCE 
SO WE'RE THINKING OF LIKE MAYBE JUST STORING IT IN A PER UTTERANCE LEVEL 
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S LESS STUFF TO STORE PROBABLY FOR DAVE IN THE ON THE AUDIO PLAYING 
AND FOR IN THE DISPLAY IT'S PROBABLY BETTER IF YOU HAVE WHOLE UTTERANCES THEN I DON'T KNOW 
LIKE WHAT IT'S LIKE IF YOU JUST TAKE SINGLE WORDS OUT OF UTTERANCES 
THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL WHEREAS IF YOU JUST UH SHOW IMPORTANT UTTERANCES ABOUT THE UTTERANCE AS A WHOLE IT MAKES MORE SENSE 
SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR YOUR ALGORITHM 'CAUSE IT JUST MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE WORKING ON A WORD LEVEL 
THEN WE JUST MEAN IT OVER THE UTTERANCE 
THEY ARE NO 
UH SO THAT'S GOOD ANYWAY THEN YEAH 
BECAUSE THAT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER THAN TO TO PUT IT AN UTTERANCE LEVEL 
OH YEAH 
NO BUT I MEAN LIKE HOW HOW JASMINE DOES IT INTERNALLY I DON'T KNOW 
BUT IT'S PROBABLY YEAH YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK ON WORD LEVELS FOR IMPORTANCE 
BUT THERE SHOULD BE WAYS OF EASILY GOING FROM A WORD LEVEL TO AN UTTERANCE LEVEL 
OKAY 
YEAH PROB 
HMM 
WELL WE DO A PRE FILTERING OF SORT OF THE WHOLE THING 
SORT OF LIKE ABOUT THAT LIKE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT SO IT'S EASY TO DO IN THE TEXT LEVEL 
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN IT WOULD STILL PLAY THE UH IN YOUR AUDIO UNLESS WE SORT OF ALSO STORE WHAT PIECES WE CUT OUT FOR THE IDEA 
YEAH 
I THINK BEFORE WE CAN LIKE ANSWER THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION HOW WE C DEAL WITH THAT 
IT'S PROBABLY GOOD FOR US TO LOOK AT WHAT THE AUDIO PLAYER IS CAPABLE OF DOING 
YES 
SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY BUFFERING 
LIKE YOU THINK DIRECTLY FEEDING 
BUT YEAH BUT NOT BUT NOT STORED IN THE HARD DISK AND THEN LOADED IN BUT LOADED IN DIRECTLY FROM MEMORY 
BUT IT'S PROBABLY A STREAM OF IT EXISTS IN JAVA IT WOULD BE PROBABLY SOME BINARY STREAM GOING ON OF SOME TYPE 
OKAY YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY SO I MEAN IS THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S PROBABLY EVEN IF YOU GO ON ONE PER UTTERANCE LEVEL 
THERE'S STILL SOME MERIT IN WITHIN UTTERANCES CUTTING OUT STUFF WHICH CLEARLY ISN'T RELEVANT AT ALL AND THAT MAYBE ALSO FOR THE AUDIO WE'D HAVE TO DO 
SO LET'S SAY WE PLAY THE WHOLE AU PHRASE BUT THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT SAYS MINUS THAT PART OF SOMETHING 
THAT'S OKAY THAT WE CAN DO 
YEAH MAYBE EVEN I MEAN THAT'S SORT OF THAT DEPENDS ON HOW HOW ADVANCED WE GOT 
IF MAYBE IF WE REALISE THAT THERE'S MASSIVE DIFFERENCES IN IN GAIN OR IN SOMETHING 
YOU CAN PROBABLY JUST MAKE SOME SIMPLE SIMPLE NORMALIZATION BUT THAT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE AND AND HOW MUCH AS NECESSARY 
YEAH OF LIKE I D I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AUDIO AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PLAYER 
SO IF YOU FIND THAT THE PLAYER ACCEPTS SOME AN INPUT FROM MEMORY AND IF IT'S EASY TO DO THEN I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S FAIRLY DOABLE 
SO BUT THAT MEANS ON THE GENERAL STRUCTURE WE'RE ACTUALLY QUITE LUCKY 
SO WE WE HAVE WE LOAD INTO MEMORY FOR THE WHOLE SERIES OF MEETINGS JUST THE UTTERANCES AND RANKINGS FOR THE UTTERANCES AND SOME INFORMATION PROBABLY THAT SAYS 
WELL TH I GUESS THAT GOES WITH THE UTTERANCE WHO'S SPEAKING 
BECAUSE THEN WE CAN ALSO DO THE DISPLAY BUT WHO'S SPEAKING 
YEAH 
BUT I'M I'M STILL CONFUSED 'CAUSE I THOUGHT LIKE THAT'S JUST WHAT JONATHAN SAID WE DO C THAT WE CAN'T DO LIKE LOAD A MASSIVE DOCUMENT OF THAT SIZE 
IN THE OTHER HAND 
THE OTHER HAND I MEAN IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE SHOULD BE LIKE FIFTY MEGA BYTE IN RAM OR SOMETHING IT SHOULDN'T BE MASSIVE SHOULD IT 
ACTUALLY FIFTY HUNDRED MEGABYTE IS QUITE BIG ONE ROOM 
JUST THINKING WHAT'S THE SIMP SO 
WE DO GET AN ERROR MESSAGE WITH THE PROJECT IF WE LOAD EVERYTHING INTO THE PROJECT WITH ALL THE DATA THEY LOAD 
SO WE KNOW THAT DOESN'T WORK 
SO OUR HOPE SO ESSENTIALLY THAT WE LOAD LESS INTO IT 
WHAT'S THIS LAZY LOADING THING SOMEBODY EXPLAIN LAZY LOADING TO ME 
OH OKAY 
SO THAT IS THAT ONLY BY TYPE OF FEEL 
LIKE IF IF IF THE SAME THING IS IN DIFFERENT FILES WOULD IT THEN MAYBE LIKE YOU KNOW 
IF IF UTTERANCES ARE SPLIT OVER THERE ARE TEN OR W HUNDRED DIFFERENT FILES 
SO THEN A CHANCE MAYBE THAT IT DOESN'T TRY TO LOAD THEM ALL INTO MEMORY AT THE SAME TIME BUT JUST 
SO WHY DOES IT FAIL THEN ON THE FIRST PLACE 
THEN IT SHOULDN'T EVER FAIL BECAUSE THEN IT SHOULD NEVER 
YEAH BUT YEAH BUT UM TO UH IT IT FAILED RIGHT WHEN YOU LOAD IT RIGHT THE NITE X. M. L. KIT SO THAT'S INTERESTING 
HMM 
LET'S CHECK THAT IT 
UM I'LL P I'LL PROBABLY ASK JONATHAN ABOUT IT 
SO ALTERNATIVELY IF WE REALISE WE CAN'T DO THE WHOLE THING IN ONE GO 
WE CAN PROBABLY JUST PROCESS SOME SORT OF META DATA YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE SORT OF SORT OF FOR THE WHOLE SERIES 
CHUNKS REPRESENTING THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS OR SOME 
LIKE SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS THE WHOLE SERIES IN IN A V IN A STRUCTURE VERY SIMILAR TO THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH WE REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL AMI MEETINGS 
BUT WITH DATA SORT OF ALWAYS COMBINED FROM THE WHOLE SERIES 
SO INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE SINGLE UTTERANCE THAT WE DISPLAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE LIKE THAT WOULD BE REPRESENTING A WHOLE UM TOPIC A SEGMENT IN A MEETING 
AND SORT OF USE THAT WE USING THE SAME DATA SET 
WELL IN A SENSE 
UH I'M I'M THINKING OF IN A SENSE OF LIKE CREATING A VIRTUAL A VIRTUAL MEETING OUT OF THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES SORT OF 
YEAH SORT OF LIKE OFF LINE CREATE A VIRTUAL MEETING WHICH WHICH BASICALLY TREATS THE MEETING SERIES AS IF IT WAS A MEETING 
AND TREATS THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITHIN THE USERS SO IF THEY WERE SEGMENTS AND TREATS THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS WITHIN MEETINGS SO IF THEY WERE UM UTTERANCES 
YOU KNOW SO WE JUST SORT OF WE SHIFT TO ONE LEVEL UP 
AND ON THAT WAY WE COULD PROBABLY IS THE SAME ALGORITHM AND JUST LIKE MAKE VIR LIKE ONE OR TWO IFS THAT SAY OKAY 
IF YOU ARE IN A WHOLE DOCUMENT UH A WHOLE SERIES LEVEL AND THAT WAS A DOUBLE CLICK 
THEN DON'T JUST GO INTO THAT UM SEGMENT BUT LOAD A NEW FILE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT BUT IN GENERAL IS THE SAME ALGORITHM 
THAT WOULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE IF WE CAN'T ACTUALLY LOAD THE WHOLE THING AND 
'CAUSE ALSO LIKE EVEN IF WE MAYBE THIS WHOLE LIKE MAYBE I'M WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE WHOLE SERIES IN ONE THING DISPLAY 
BECAUSE ACTUALLY I MEAN PROBABLY USERS WOULDN'T VIEW THAT ONE TOO OFTEN 
YEAH BUT I'M I'M STILL WORRIED 
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE DISPLAY IF YOU ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT A DISPLAY UH LIKE FOR THE WHOLE SERIES 
THE INFORMATION DENSITY LEVELS BASED ON AND AND THE F AND THE ONLY GRANULARITY YOU HAVE IS INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES 
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE UTTERANCE IN A SERIES OF SEVENTY HOURS OF MEETINGS 
YEAH 
YEAH AND IF YOU MAKE THAT STRUCTURALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THE THE L LIKE ONE LEVEL DOWN 
LIKE THE WAY HOW WE UH STORE INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES AND STUFF 
THEN MAYBE WE CAN MORE OR LESS IS THE SAME CODE AND JUST MAKE A FEW IFS AND STUFF 
YEAH SO SO BUT STILL USE IN IN GENERAL WE'RE HAVING WE'RE HAVING UTTERANCES 
AND THEY HAVE A SCORE 
AND THAT'S AS MUCH AS WE REALLY NEED 
AND IF COU AND THEY ALSO HAVE A TEAM A TIME INFORMATION OF COURSE 
HMM 
AND A AND A S AND A SPEAKER INFORMATION YEAH 
YEAH SO NO INFORMATION WHICH TOPIC THEY'RE N YEAH 
AND AND PROBABLY SEPARATE IT THAT ONE INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TOPICS LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
SO 
SO THE SKIMMING CAN WORK ON THAT BECAUSE THE SKIMMING JUST SORT OF SORTS THE UTTERANCES AND PUTS AS MANY ONE IS IT NEEDS 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'LL IT'LL PLAY THEM IN SOME ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE SET BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S GONNA BE MORE ENTERTAINING 
UM 
BUT THAT THAT'S ENOUGH DATA FOR THE SKIMMING AND THE THE SEARCHING SO WHAT THE SEARCHING DOES IS THE SEARCHING LEAVES THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK 
GOES TO THE S. Q. L. DATABASE AND GETS LIKE BASICALLY IN THE END GETS JUST A TIME MARKER FOR WHERE THAT IS LIKE THAT UTTERANCE THAT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH 
AND THEN WE HAVE TO FIND I'M SURE THERE'S SOME WAY IN IN NITE X. M. L. TO JUST SAY SET POSITION TO THAT TIME MARK 
AND THEN IT SHIFTS THE WHOLE FRAME AND IT ALERTS EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF THE DISPLAY AND THE DISPLAY UPDATES 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT WE CAN JU YEAH BUT SO SO IF IF SOMETHI SO YEAH 
SO IF IN THAT TREE DISPLAY SOMEBODY CLICKS ON SOMETHING 
YEAH AND THEN YOU SORT OF FEED THE TIME STAMP IT AND THE NITE X. M. L. CENTRAL MANAGER 
AND THAT CENTRAL MANAGER ALERTS EVERYTHING THAT'S THERE LIKE ALERTS THE SKIM LIKE THE THE AUDIO DISPLAY 
ALERTS THE TEXT DISPLAY 
ALERTS THE VISUAL DISPLAY AND SAYS WE HAVE A NEW TIME FRAME AND THEN THEY ALL SORT OF DO THEIR UPDATE ROUTINES WITH RESPECT TO THE CURRENT LEVEL OF ZOOM 
SO HOW MUCH DO THEY DISPLAY AND STARTING POSITION TO WHERE THE OR MAYBE THE MID POSITION OF IT 
I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE IF START WHERE THE THING WAS FOUND OR IF THAT THING WA WAS FOUND IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PART THAT WE DISPLAY 
THAT I DON'T KNOW 
BUT THAT WE CAN DECIDE ABOUT ABOUT A GENERAL SORT OF 
IT'S THE SAME THING OF LIKE WHETHER YOU PLAY AND IT MOVES FORWARD OR WHETHER YOU JUMP TO A POSITION THROUGH SEARCH 
IT'S ESSENTIALLY FOR ALL THE WINDOW HANDLING IT'S THE SAME EVENT 
IT'S ONLY THAT THE EVENT GETS TRIGGERED BY THE SEARCH ROUTINE WHICH SORT OF PUSH THAT INTO NITE X. M. L. AND SAYS PLEASE GO THERE NOW 
WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO IT IN MEMORY 
BUT THAT STUFF'S SO 
I MEAN LIKE THE INFORMATION IS COMING FROM OFF LINE 
SO WE PROBABLY WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO CHANGE THE UTTERANCE DOCUMENT 
RIGHT BECAUSE THE WHOLE WAY LIKE THE WHOLE BEAUTY OF THE NITE X. M. L. IS THAT IT TIES TOGETHER LOTS OF DIFFERENT FILES 
SO WE CAN JUST CREATE AN ADDITIONAL X. M. L. FILE WHICH FOR EVERY UTTERANCE LIKE THE UTTERANCES HAVE I. D. S I PRESUME SOME REFERENCES 
SO WE JUST W IT UH P JUST A VERY SHORT X. M. L. FILE 
WHICH IT'S THE ONLY INFORMATION IT HAS THAT HAS WHATEVER A NUMBER FOR FOR THE UM WEIGHT 
FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY AND WE JUST TO THAT AT THE EXISTING UTTERANCES AND TO THEM AT THE EXISTING SPEAKER CHANGES 
WELL OTHERWISE WE PROBABLY HAVE TO GO OVER IT AND LIKE ADD SOME INTEGER THAT WE JUST INCREMENT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM SORT OF IT EVERY UTTERANCE AS ONE IS AN I. D. SOME TYPE 
OR IN OUR TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW NITE X. M. L. E. D. S WORK AND MAYBE THERE'S SOME SPECIAL ROUTE WE HAVE TO FOLLOW WHEN WE USE THIS I. D. S 
IT'S ALM HMM 
YEAH THE THE GIRL SAID THE UTTERANCES THEMSELVES OR NOT NUMBERED AT THE MOMENT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SO I GUESS THAT WOULD BE SOLVABLE IF NOT 
MM-HMM 
SORRY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO THAT A BOARD MARKER PEN ACTUALLY 
OH 
THAT'S JUST USE LIKE TO MAKE A LIST OF ALL THIS STUFF OR WE PROBABLY CAN SOMEBODY CAN DO IT ON PAPER 
ALL THESE FANCY PENS 
SO WHAT IS THE STUFF WE HAVE WE HAVE UTTERANCES AND SPEAKERS AND WEIGHTS FOR UTTERANCES 
SO FOR FOR EVERY UTTERANCE SORT OF LIKE THE UTTERANCE HAS A SPEAKER AND A WEIGHT WHICH IS COMING FROM OUTSIDE 
ARE WE JUST TO TO TO IT 
AND THERE IS SEGMENTS WHICH HMM 
UH S SORRY UM 
UH TOPIC S TOPIC SEGMENTS I MEANT 
LIKE THEY ARE THEY ARE A SUPER UNIT 
SO SO THE UTTERANCES ARE TIED TO TOPIC SEGMENTS 
AND OF THE TIME STAMPS ARE IN A WORD LEVEL THEN WE B SOMEHOW HAVE TO EXTRACT TIME STAMPS FOR UTTERANCES WHERE THEY START 
W WHAT SEGMENTS NOW 
OKAY 
SO THE UH SO THAT THE SAME AS UTTERANCES THAT IS THAT THE SAME AS UTTERANCES THAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WHAT SO THAT'S UH 
BUT THAT'S ONE O ONE SEGMENT OR IS THAT TWO SEGMENTS THEN 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO BUT BUT GENERALLY UTTERANCES IS THAT WHICH WE JUST CALLED UH SORRY SEGMENTS IS THAT WHICH WE JUST CALLED UTTERANCES NOW 
LIKE IT'S IT'S THE SO IT'S SORT OF LIKE ONE PERSON'S CONTRIBUTION TO A TIME SORT OF THINGY DINGY 
OKAY SO YEAH SO WE HAVE THIS AND AND THEN WE HAVE SOME OF FIELD SOMEWHERE ELSE WHICH HAS 
TOPICS 
YEAH AND AND A TOPIC'S BASICALLY THEY ARE JUST IN THE I. D. PROBABLY WITH A START TIME OR SOMETHING 
AND AND THE UTTERANCES REFERENCED TO THESE TOPICS I GUESS 
SO THE TOPICS DON'T CONTAIN ANY REDUNDANT THING OF LIKE SHOWING THE WHOLE TOPIC AGAIN 
BUT THEY JUST SORT OF SAY A NUMBER AND WHERE THEY START AND WHERE THEY FINISH 
AND THE UTTERANCES THEN SAY WHICH TOPIC THEY BELONG TO 
YEAH 
NO 
BUT I WAS THINKING OF THE TOPIC SEGMENTATION NOW AND AND F FOR THAT THERE WOULD ONLY BE ONE 
RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF LIKE IT'S JUST A TIME WINDOW 
YEAH 
SO IF THIS LAZY LOADING WORKS THEN THIS SHOULD DEFINITELY FIT INTO I MEAN INTO MEMORY THEN BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T ALL BE IN MEMORY AT THE SAME TIME 
SO IF WE JUST HAVE THESE SORT OF THAT INFORMATION LIKE A LONG LIST OF ALL THE UTTERANCES SLASH SEGMENTS AND LIKE SHORT OR SMALLER LISTS WHICH GIVE WEIGHT TO THEM 
AND EVEN THOUGH PROBABLY IF THERE'S A LOT OF OVER HEAD IN HAVING TWO DIFFERENT FILES WE CAN PROBABLY MERGE THE WEIGHTS INTO IT OFF LINE 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
LIKE IF IF THERE'S A LOT OF BUREAUCRACY INVOLVED WITH HAVING TWO DIFFERENT TREES AND WHETHER ON ITS AT THE OTHER BECAUSE THE ONE HAS THE WEIGHT FOR THE OTHER 
THEN IT'S PROBABLY QUICKER TO JUST 
YEAH 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WHOLE BEAUTY THAT LIKE YOU CAN JUST MAKE A NEW X. M. L. FILE AND SORT OF IT THAT AT THE OTHER AND AND IT TRUE 
OH YEAH 
SO NO I DIDN'T I DIDN'T MEAN TRUE 
NO 
NO 
I MEANT JUST LIKE HANDLING TWO DIFFERENT FILES INTERNALLY 
SORT OF C I WAS JUST THINKING YOU KNOW LIKE IF IF THE OVERHEAD FOR HAVING THE SAME AMOUNT OF DATA COMING FROM TWO D FILES INSTEAD OF FROM ONE FILE IS MASSIVE 
THEN IT WOULD PROBABLY BE FAR AS EASY TO JUST LIKE OFF LINE PUT THE THE WEIGHT INTO INTO THE FILE THAT HAS THE SEGMENTS 
OH YEAH SEGMENTS SLASH UTTERANCES ALREADY 
BUT THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT I MEAN IF IT'S GOING HORRENDOUSLY WRONG 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH NO 
WE'D WE'D BE COMPLETELY USING LIKE THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND BASICALLY JUST I MEAN THE MAIN DIFFERENCE REALLY BETWEEN OUR PROJECT AND THEIRS REALLY IS THAT WE LOAD A DIFFERENT PART OF THE DATA 
BUT OTHERWISE WE'RE DOING AT THE SAME WAY THAT THEY ARE DOING IT 
SO WE JUST WE'RE SORT OF RUNNING DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUERIES ON IT 
W IN A SENSE W I THINK WE ARE RUNNING QUERIES IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT UM WHAT WE LOAD AND WHAT WE DON'T LOAD 
BUT WE'RE L RUNNING QUERIES ON THE SENSE THAT WE DYNAMICALLY SELECT BY BY WEIGHTS DON'T WE 
THAT WE HAVE TO CHECK HOW FAST THAT IS LIKE TO SAY GIVE US ALL THE ONES THAT WHETHER THAT WORKS WITH THEIR QUERY LANGUAGE 
WHETHER THAT'S TOO MANY RESULTS AND WHETHER WE SH 
YOU KNOW 
IF 'CAUSE IF IT I LET'S SAY I MEAN IF IF THEIR QUERY LANGUAGE IS STRONG AND IF IT WOULD RETURN B TEN MILLION RESULTS AND IT CAN'T HANDLE IT 
THEN WE CAN JUST WRITE OUR INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS IN THE WAY THAT THEY KNOW WHICH WHAT THE THRESHOLD SO 
SO THEY STILL GET ALL THE DATA AND JUST THEY INTERNALLY SAY UH IN THIS IS LESS THAN THREE AND I'M NOT GONNA DISPLAY IT OR SOMETHING 
HMM 
YEAH 
NO 
I'M JUST THINKING FOR THIS WHOLE THING OF LIKE A DIFFERENT LEVEL SORT OF CUTTING OUT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PIECES 
WHETHER WE DO THAT THROUGH A QUERY WHERE WE SAY GIVE US EVERYTHING THAT'S AB ABOVE THIS AND THIS WEIGHT OR WHETHER WE SKIP THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE 
BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL MODULE LIKE THE PLAYER AND THE DISPLAY SAY LIKE THEY STILL GOT SORT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT UTTERANCES 
UH ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES BUT THEY SAY UH THIS PIECE I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT'S BELOW THE CURRENT THRESHOLD LEVEL 
WHEN DO WE NEED THE ONE FOR THE MUTE 
OKAY 
YEAH I GUESS FOR THE SO WHEN WE HAVE THE DISPLAY WELL WE DISPLAY THE WHOLE SERIES 
THEN IF WE HAVE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TOPIC SEGMENTS WITHIN THE MEETINGS IF WE HAVE READY CALCULATED DISP UM MEASURES 
THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO SORT OF EXTRACT THAT DATA FROM THE INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES 
YEAH AND THAT'S ALSO FAIRLY EASY TO STORE ALONG WITH OUR SEGMENTS ISN'T IT 
FOR THE SEGMENTS 
ARE WE EXTRACTING SOME TYPE OF TITLE FOR THEM THAT WE CRAFT WITH SOME FANCY ALGORITHM OR MANUALLY OR WE'RE JUST TAKING THE SINGLE MOST HIGHLY VALUED KEY WORD UTTERANCE FOR THE SEGMENT HEADING 
HMM 
HMM 
IT'S PROBABLY LIKE IN IN THE END PROBABLY IT WOULDN'T BE THE BEST THING IF IT'S JUST THE HIGH MOST HIGHLY RANKED PHRASE OR KEY WORD BECAUSE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR AN INTRODUCTION THAT WOULD MOST DEFINITELY NOT BE ANYTHING THAT HAS ANY TITLE ANYWHERE SIMILAR TO INTRODUCTION OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
ALSO LIKE FOR THIS PART MAYBE IF WE GO OVER IT WITH NAMED ENTITY IN THE END 
IF I MEAN WE IF ONE OF THE PEOPLE DOING DIL HAS SOME NAMED ENTITY CODE TO SPARE 
AND JUST LOOK AT LEAST FOR THE FOR SORT OF FOR FINDING TOPICS TITLES FOR FOR SEGMENTS 
JUST TAKE A NAMED ENTITY WHICH HAS A REALLY HIGH WHAT'S IT CALLED D. F. I. D. F. WHATEVER 
'CAUSE YOU'D PROBABLY BE QUITE LIKELY IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A CONFERENCE OR A PERSON 
THAT THAT WOULD BE A NAMED ENTITY WHICH IS VERY HIGHLY FR UM FREQUENTED IN THAT PART 
YEAH HE SAID THEY'RE QUITE SPARSE 
SO THAT BASICALLY WAS DON'T BOTHER BASING TOO MUCH OF YOUR GENERAL CALCULATION ON IT 
BUT LIKE ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE SPARSE PROBABLY INDIVIDUAL NAMED ENTITIES WHICH DESCRIBE WHAT A WHAT A SEGMENT SO BUT WOULD PROBABLY BE QUITE GOOD 
LIKE IF THERE'S SOME NAME OF SOME CONFERENCE THEY WOULD COULD PROBABLY SAY THAT NAME OF THE CONFERENCE QUITE OFTEN 
EVEN THOUGH HE'S RIGHT THAT THEY MAKE INDIRECT REFERENCES TO IT 
ANYWAY SORRY 
SO YOU'RE DOING THAT IN A IN A PER WORD LEVEL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY COOL 
I WAS JUST WONDERING WHERE YOU HAD THE CORPUS FROM AT THE MOMENT 
SO IT IT SEEMS THAT THE DATA STRUCTURE ISN'T A BIG PROBLEM AND THAT BASICALLY WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ALL THESE MASSIVE DISCUSSIONS OF HOW WE EXACTLY INTERACT WITH THE DATA STRUCTURE BECAUSE MOST OF OUR WORK ISN'T DONE WITH THAT DATA STRUCTURE IN MEMORY IN THE BROWSER 
BUT IT'S JUST DONE OFF LINE AND EVERYONE CAN UH REPRESENT IT ANYWAY THEY WANT AS LONG AS THEY SORT OF STORE IT IN A USEFUL X. M. L. REPRESENTATION IN THE END 
SO LIKE 
YEAH THAT WOULD MEAN UNDERSTANDING THE NITE X. M. L. X. M. L. SORT OF FORMAT IN A LOT MORE DETAIL 
WE SHOULD I THINK WE SHOULD JUST HAVE A LONG SESSION IN THE COMPUTER ROOM TOGETHER AND LIKE NOW THAT WE KNOW A BIT MORE WHAT WE WANT 
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT NITE X. M. L. 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
GOOD 
YEAH I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THIS STUFF MUCH IT ALL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHO'S WHO'S SORT OF DOING THE THE THE CENTRAL COORDINATION OF OF OF THE BROWSER APPLICATION NOW 
LIKE 
HMM 
YEAH OR BUT ALSO LIKE ALL THESE ELEMENTS LIKE LIKE THE LOADING AND YEAH INTEGRATION AND AND LIKE HANDLING THE DATA LOADING AND STUFF 
NAH 
I'M SORT OF LIKE I THINK I'LL TAKE OVER THE DISPLAY JUST BECAUSE I'VE STARTED WITH A BIT AND FIND TO FIND IT DOABLE 
SO SOMEBODY SHOULD SORT OF BE THE ONE PERSON WHO'S WHO UNDERSTANDS MOST ABOUT WHAT'S T CENTRALLY GOING ON WITH WITH THE WITH THE PROJECT 
LIKE WITH THE WITH THE BROWSER AS A WHEEL AND WHERE THE DATA COMES IN AND 
ANY VOLUNTEERS 
IT'S ALSO A COMPLICATED ONE 
YEAH 
I KNOW ABOUT UH B I GUESS WE CAN DO IT LIKE SEVERAL PEOPLE TOGETHER 
IT'S PROBABLY JUST THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER A LOT AND VERY CLOSELY AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS F UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OTHER ONE IS DOING 
YEAH OR ARE READY MADE VERSIONS OF THEM FOR THAT MATTER AND 
YEAH BUT I THINK ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE MOMENT THE INTEGRATION COMES FIRST I MEAN IT'S SORT OF AT THE MOMENT THE BUILDING THE BROWSER COMES FIRST 
AND THEN ONLY COMES THE CREATING NEW SOPHISTICATED DATA CHUNKS 
BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF THE WHOLE THING ABOUT HAVING A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WHICH IS MORE OR LESS WORKING ON ON CHUNK DATA 
BUT IT AT LEAST WE HAVE THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH WE CAN THEN TEST EVERYTHING AND AND LOOK AT EVERYTHING 
'CAUSE BEFORE WE HAVE THAT 
IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE IT REALLY SEE HOW MUCH THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IS MAKING SENSE BECAUSE YOU JUST WELL I GUESS YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING FROM THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL X. M. L. IS FEELS FEELS THAT YOU CREATE 
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME BASIC SYSTEM WHICH JUST DISPLAYS SOME STUFF 
OR JUST ADAPT LIKE THREE LIKE JUST SORT OF GO FROM THEIR SYSTEM AND AND ADAPT THAT PIECE FOR PIECE AND SEE HOW WE COULD 
HOW WE COULD ARRAN LIKE ADAPT IT IT OR 
SYSTEM 
DOES ANYONE WANT TO LIKE JUST SIT WITH UM AND LIKE PLAY FOR THREE HOURS WITH NITE X. M. L. AT SOME POINT 
UH I WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE 'CAUSE I'D LIKE TO GO TO THE GYM 
I'M THEORETICALLY FREE 
BUT IF THERE'S ANY TIME TO HMM 
YOU HAVE NOTHING ON FOR TIME ON WEDNESDAY 
HMM 
NINE 'TIL TWELVE AND THEN NOTHI YOU HAVE OR YOU 
HMM 
ANYTIME WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON I'D BE COOL I THINK 
YO FORREST HILL WHATEVER ONE'S EASIER TO DISCUSS STUFF I DON'T KNOW 
I'M NOT BIASED 
OKAY 
WHAT TIME DO YOU WANNA DO 
OKAY SO I'LL JUST MEET YOU IN IN EIGHTEEN A IN THE AFTERNOON 
I GUESS AT THE MOMENT NOBODY CRITICALLY DEPENDS ON LIKE THE NITE X. M. L. STUFF WORKING RIGHT NOW RIGHT 
LOOK AT THE MOMENT YOU CAN ALL DO YOUR STUFF AND I CAN DO MY L. S. A. STUFF 
AND I CAN EVEN DO THE DISPLAY IT A VAST DEGREE WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THEIR SUPPLYING FRAMEWORK WORKING 
SO IT'S NOT THAT CRUCIAL 
YEAH ACTUALLY I NEED THE RAW TEXT AS WELL 
YEAH BUT I WAS I WAS I WAS MORE THINKING OF THE SORT OF THE THE WHOLE BROWSER FRAMEWORK AS A RUNNING PROGRAMME NOW 
YEAH I THINK WE ALL AND THE RAW TEXT IN DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT FLAVOURS DON'T WE 
BUT NUMBER WITHIN THE X. M. L. CONTEXT 
ARE THEY SPOKEN NUMBERS 
LIKE DO THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE UTTERANCES NUMBERS 
THERE'S THE NUMBER TASK ISN'T THERE 
THAT'S PART OF THE WHOLE THING 
HMM 
OKAY 
HMM 
YEAH WE HAVE TO PROBABLY CUT THAT IT ANYWAY FOR OUR PROJECT I DON'T KNOW 
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA SCREW UP A LOT OF OUR DATA OTHERWISE 
IF NOT SURE IF IT WHAT IT DOES IT DOCUMENT IT WOULD PROBABLY MAKE THE YEAH IF IF YOU HAVE SEGMENTS FOR THAT PROBABLY THE 
OKAY 
UH I'M JUST THINKING LIKE TO PR IT PRO PROBABLY LIKE THE L. S. A. WOULD PERFORM QUITE WELL IN IT 
IT WOULD PROBABLY FIND ANOTHER NUMBER TASK QUITE EASILY SEEING THAT IT'S A CONSTRAINED VOCABULARY WITH A HIGH CO OCCURRENCE OF THE SAME NINE WORDS 
SO THAT WOU TEN WORD 
HMM 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT THEY THEY SAID THE NUMBERS IN ORDER RIGHT 
YEAH I THINK IT'S AT THE IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WANTED TO CHECK OUT HOW WELL THEY WERE DOING WITH OVERLAPPING AND STUFF 
BECAUSE BASICALLY IT'S LIKE THEY'RE READING THEM OUT DIFFERENT SPEEDS BUT YOU KNOW IN WHICH ORDER THEY ARE USED 
ANYWAY 
ICSI HAS SOME REASONS FOR DOING IT 
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN PISSED OFF SAYING LIKE NUMBERS AT THE END OF EVERY MEETING 
UM DAVE IF YOU WOULD ARE ACTUALLY FOR WELL IF YOU'RE DOING I. D. F. S OR YOU WHATEVER YOU CALL YOUR YOUR FREQUENCIES I ALWAYS MIX UP THE NAME 
UH YOU NEED SOME DICTIONARY FOR THAT AT SOME POINT THOUGH 
LIKE YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME REPRESENTATION OF A WORD IS NOT NOT THAT SPECIFIC OCCURRENCE OF THAT WORD TOKEN BUT IF IF IF A GIVEN WORD FORM 
BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING COUNTS FOR WORD FORMS RIGHT 
YEAH SO WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER ON THAT BECAUSE I NEED A DICTIONARY AS WELL 
OKAY 
'KAY 
OKAY 
DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE O THE RED 
YEAH BUT FOR I'M JUST WONDERING FOR THE WHOLE THING 
DOES SOMEBODY WO WHO WAS IT IF YOU TWO WHO SAID THAT UM THERE'S SOME PROGRAMME WHICH SPITS OUT A DICTIONARY PROBABLY WITH FREQUENCIES 
OKAY 
SO ANYONE IF YOU FOR THE FOR THE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY OVER TOTAL FREQUENCY YOU GONNA HAVE TOTAL FREQUENCIES OF WORDS THEN WITH THAT RIGHT 
LIKE OVER THE WHOLE CORPUS SORT OF 
OR 
WE USING WHICH TOOL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
BE CAREFUL WITH THAT 
LIKE MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE BRITISH NATIONAL CORPUS WAS THAT THERE'S FAR MORE WORD TYPES THEN YOU EVER THINK BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT'S SORT OF UNUSUAL GENERALLY IS A NEW WORD TYPE 
LIKE ANY TYPO OR ANY STRANGE THING WHERE THEY PUT TWO WORDS TOGETHER 
AND ALSO ANY NUMBER IS A WORD TYPE OF ITS OWN 
SO YOU CAN EASILY END UP WITH HUNDRED THOUSANDS OF WORDS WHEN YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THEM 
SO GENERALLY DICTIONARIES CAN GROW BIGGER THAN YOU THINK THEY DO 
WELL YOU CAN PROBABLY ALSO YOU CAN PROBABLY PRE FILTER LIKE WITH REGULAR EXPRESSIONS EVEN JUST SAY IF IT CONSISTS OF ONLY DIG DIGITS THEN SKIP IT 
OR EVEN IF IT CONSISTS ANY SPECIAL CHARACTERS 
THEN SKIP IT BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WITH A DATA IN BETWEEN WHICH IS USUALLY NOT SOMETHING YOU WANNA HAVE AND 
WHAT I DID FOR MY PROJECT I JUST IGNORED THE HUNDRED MOST FREQUENT WORDS BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY END UP ALL BEING ARTICLES AND AND EVERYTHING AND STUFF 
SO WE NEED LIKE SEVERAL OF US AND A DICTIONARY 
UM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NEEDS TO WITH FREQUENCIES 
UM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NEEDS TO WITH FREQUENCIES 
OR 
FREQUENCIES 
YEAH 
WELL I GUESS AS SOON AS WE HAVE THE RAW TEXT 
WE CAN PROBABLY JUST START WITH THE JAVA HASH MAP AND LIKE JUST HASH MAP OVER IT AND SEE HOW FAR WE GOT 
I MEAN WE CAN PROBABLY IN A MACHINE WITH A FEW HUNDRED MEGABYTE RAM YOU CAN GO QUITE FAR 
YOU CAN WRITE IT ON BEEFY 
SO EVEN IF IT GOES WRONG AND EVEN IF IT HAS A MILLION WORDS BE 
OH YEAH BURNING IT IN A LIKE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BURN THE WHOLE CORPUS JUST THE X. HMM 
UH I SEE I ASKED SUPPORT ABOUT THAT TWO DAYS AGO 
IN THE INFORMATICS BUILDING THERE OH SORRY IN IN APPLETON TOWER FIVE THE ONES CLOSEST T TWO MACHINES CLOSEST TO THE SUPPORT OFFICE 
SO I PRESUME OH WAIT I HAVE THE EXACT EMAIL 
I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT SORT OF THE ONES THAT 
YEAH IF YOU IF YOU ENTER THE BIG ROOM IN THE RIGHT HAND CORNER I THINK 
UM THE THING IS LIKE YOU CAN ONLY BURN FROM THE LOCAL FILE SYSTEM 
SO IF IT'S FROM AS WELL ACTUALLY I THINK IF IT'S MOUNTED YOU CAN DIRECTLY BURN FROM THERE 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS I HAVE MY DATA ON BEEFY AND SO I HAVE TO GET IT INTO THE LOCAL TEMP DIRECTORY AND BURN IT FROM THERE 
BUT YOU CAN BURN IT FROM THERE 
UH WE LOOKED THAT UP AND I FOR WE LOOKED THAT UP AND I FORGOT 
YEAH YEAH 
NO YOU YOU WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT IT I DON'T THINK IT WAS I DON'T THINK IT WAS A GIGABYTE 
HMM 
SO I WOULD OFF I WOULD OFFER YOU TO TO GET IT IN THIS ONE AND THEN UM LIKE COPY IT 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I FIGURED OUT I'M QUICKER DOWN LOADING OVER BROAD BAND INTO MY COMPUTER THAN USING THIS HARD DISK 
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THE WAY HOW THEY ACCESS THE HARD DISK HOW THEY MEANT TO WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE 
HMM 
WHAT OPERATING SYSTEM DO YOU HAVE 
OKAY 
WHA WHAT CONNECTION DO YOU HAVE TO HIM 
YEAH 
SO IF ANYONE OF US GETS TO WE CAN THEN JUST AS AN EXT HMM 
YEAH BURN IT TO C. D. OR YEAH PUT IT IN IN HARD DISK WHATEVER 
QUESTION IS IF YOU'RE NOT QUICKER IF YOU UH BECAUSE YOU SHOULD GET MASSIVE COMPRESSION OUT OF THAT 
LIKE FIFTY PERCENT OR SOMETHING WITH A GOOD ALGORITHM 
SO IF YOU COULD COMPRESS IT AND JUST PUT IT INTO A TEMP DIRECTORY 
LIKE 
THE TEMP THE TEMPS USUALLY HAVE FOR GIGABYTE THREE OR TWO 
THE TEMPS YEAH 
I DO LIKE I MEAN THERE'S NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANYTHING STAYS THERE BUT OVERNIGHT IT'LL STAY 
AND I THINK THE TEMPS USUALLY HAVE 
OH YEAH BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE TEMP DIRECTORY OFF THE MACHINE YOU CAN S. S. H. INTO DIRECTORY OF S. S. H. 
YEAH THEY WOU THEY'D THEY'D PROBABLY HATE YOU FOR DOING IT 
BUT 
THEY'D PROBABLY THEY'D LIKE YOU MORE IF YOU S. S. H. UH INTO ANOTHER COMPUTER COMPRESS IT THERE AND THEN SORT OF COPY IT INTO THE INTO THE GATEWAY MACHINE 
THEY HAVE UM IF YOU S. S. HEY YOU KNOW 
IF YOU IF YOU S. S. H. AND THEY HAVE THIS BIG WARNING ABOUT DOING NOTHING AT ALL IN THE GATEWAY MACHINE 
YEAH 
TO YOUR HOME MACHINE 
I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO TUNNEL THROUGH THE GATEWAY INTO ANOTHER MACHINE YET 
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT EASY DEFINITELY 
THAT'S WHY I END UP SORT OF COPYING STUFF INTO THE TEMP DIRECTORY AT THE GATEWAY MACHINE 
SORRY OF THIS IS BORING EVERYBODY ELSE 
THIS IS JUST DETAILS AND HOW TO GET STUFF HOME FROM WHAT WE CAN PROBABLY JUST LOOK AT THAT TOGETHER WHEN WE'RE MEETING 
I'M SORRY 
MM-HMM 
WELL YEAH 
AS SOON AS SOMEBODY GIVES ME THE RAW TEXT OF THE WHOLE THING 
I CAN PROBABLY JUST IMPLEMENT LIKE A FIVE LINE JAVA HASH TABLE FREQUENCY DICTIONARY BUILDER AND SO 
UH DID YOU NOT SAY FREQUENCIES OF OF WORDS IN THE WHOLE SORRY DID UH 
SO YOU'D YOU 
YEAH YOU'D HAVE TO COUNT IT YOURSELF YEAH 
UH YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE DIFFERENT COUNTS FOR EACH CHUNK BUT JUST LIKE SORT OF FOR FOR SOMETHING FROM OLD CHUNKS 
OH YEAH NO THAT'S YEAH 
SO ONCE I WROTE ONE OR LIKE WE IF I WRITE LIKE AN ALGORITHM WHICH DOES A HASH UM TABLE DICTIONARY WITH FREQUENCY FROM A RAW TEXT 
THEN THE RAW TEXT CAN BE ANYTHING 
SO HOW FAR ARE WE GO UH HOW F HOW FAR ARE YOU GETTING RAW TEXT OUT OF TO DO YOU THINK 
OKAY WELL THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE FOR THE DICTIONARY THE ORDER DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE DOES IT 
SO YEAH SO UM I'LL GET THAT FROM YOU AND I'LL WRITE THE HASH TABLE WHICH GOES OVER THAT AND CREATES A DICTIONARY FILE 
SO FOR THE DICTIONARY IS IT OKAY IF I DO WHATEVER WORD BLANK FREQUENCY OR SOMETHING 
JUST P COULD EVERYBODY SORT OF START FROM THAT 
I MEAN I GUESS WE CAN 
YEAH I I NEED FREQUENCY AS WELL 
WELL I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE A LOT IN COMMON WHAT WE CALCULATE BECAUSE I FOR MY LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS AND LIKE COUNTS OF WORDS WITHIN A DOCUMENT 
UH WITHIN A A SEGMENT ACTUALLY WITHIN A TOPIC SEGMENT 
CAN I CONVERT THESE PROBABILITIES BACK INTO FREQUENCIES 
OKAY 
UH SO THAT'S WHAT F RAINBOW DOES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT L. S. A. BUILDS ON 
LIKE IT BUILDS A OF A DOCUMENT BY FREQUENCY MATRIX 
SO I COULD PROBABLY GET THAT 
EVEN THOUGH BUT I ALREADY HAVE I ALREADY HAVE MY CODE TO BUILD IT UP MYSELF 
NO DON'T BOTHER 
I HAVE MY CODE ALREADY 
UM 
YEAH SO DAVE YOU SAID YOU NEED THE FREQUENCY COUNTS ACTUALLY FOR PER DOCUMENT WOULD YOU SAY NOT FOR THE WHOLE THING 
IT MORE AND MORE APPEARS TO ME THAT IF WE IF WE SCRAP THE NOTION OF THE MEETING IS AN INDIVIDUAL THING AND SORT OF JU SEE MEETINGS AS AS TOPIC SEGMENTS AND HAVE SORT OF LIKE HIERARCHICAL TOPIC SEGMENTATION INSTEAD 
THEN IT'S BE LIKE A MORE COHERENT FRAMEWORK 
WAIT ARE WE ARE WE USING THIS UM FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE IDEA FOR THE WEIGHTING IN THE END NOW THIS THIS MEASURE YOU'RE CALCULATING 
BECAUSE IF WE'RE DOING LIKE I THINK FOR FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY WE UH WE SHOULD CALCULATE IT IN THE LOWEST LEVEL NOT IN THE HIGHEST 
BUT LIKE 'CAUSE 
YEAH BUT W IT DON'T YOU HAVE TO LOOK G SORT OF LIKE FOR IN A DOCUMENT VERSUS THE WHOLE THING 
ISN'T THAT HOW IT WORKS THAT YOU C LOOK LIKE IT OR 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE ISN'T IT LIKE THAT WE EXPECT TH THERE TO CHANGE OVER I B WITH THE DIFFERENT TOPIC SEGMENTS MORE 
THAT THEY TALK ABOUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN EACH DIFFERENT TOPIC SEGMENT 
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT RELATIVE TERM FREQUENCY IS ABOUT THAT LIKE IN SOME CONTEXT THEY'RE TALKING MORE ABOUT A CERTAIN WORD THAN IN GENERAL 
SO THAT WOULD MORE B THE THE TOPIC SEGMENTS THEN 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S WAYS TO ABANDON THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF OF MEETINGS AND SORT OF BUT JUST NOT REALLY TREATING SEPARATE MEETINGS IS TOO MUCH OF A SEPARATE ENTITY 
BUT 
BUT ON ALGORITHMIC LEVEL WHETHER WE ACTUALLY WHETHER THERE'S SOME WAY TO JUST REPRESENT MEETINGS AS AS TOPICS 
HMM 
THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT I MEANT 
BUT I THINK I HAVE TO THINK MORE ABOUT WHAT I MEANT 
UM G I'M CONFUSED ABOUT EVERYTHING 
YEAH 
I'M I'M NOT IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE UM A MEETING PLUS SOMETHING ELSE I'M MORE TALKING ABOUT LIKE YEAH 
THE KEEPING KEEPING THE SAME ALGORITHM AND THE SAME WAY OF HANDLING IT AND JUST SAYING LIKE JUST THIS THIS TOPIC HERE I UH IT HAPPENS TO BE LIKE A WHOLE MEETING AND IT HAS SORT OF SUB TOPICS 
SO JUST THAT SORT OF TOPICS A HIERARCHICAL CONCEPT WHERE LIKE A TOPIC WHERE THERE CAN BE SUPER TOPICS AND TOPICS 
AND THE SUPER TOPICS ARE IN THE AND WHAT THE MEETINGS OR BUT IN GENERAL AT SOME LEVEL SUPER TOPICS ARE TREATED LIKE LIKE TOPICS 
HMM 
MM I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I WANT 
SO SORRY COULD DESCRIBE THAT AGAIN THE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO THAT WOULD BE THE USERS AS A WHILE 
THAT WOULD BE SORT OF UM MEETINGS YEAH 
YEAH 
I'M A I'M A I'M A BIT BRAIN DAMAGED AT THE MOMENT BUT I THINK I'LL JUST SIT TOGETHER WITH YOU AGAIN AND AND GO THROUGH IT AGAIN 
HMM 
SO SO I'LL SEE THE TO LOOK SO THIS AND THIS STRUCTURALLY THEN ALWAYS IDENTICAL 
SO THAT WE CAN THAT WE CAN TREAT IT WITH THE SAME ALGORITHM OR 
YEAH I'M ALSO NOT SURE HOW WE CAN GO FROM FROM BOTTOM UP 
I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT'S LIKE MORE THAT UH WHATEVER I'M A CAN'T THINK IF IT AT THE MOMENT 
PROBABLY THIS IS ALL TOO COMPLICATED WORRYING ABOUT THAT IT THAT MOMENT ANYWAY 
NOW HAVE HAVE WE HAVE WE DECIDED ANYTHING ARE WE DOING ANYTHING 
SO WEDNESDAY WE ARE MEETING AND LOOKING AT THEIR AT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN SOME MORE DETAIL TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON 
WE HAD TWO THINGS FROM OTHER STUFF JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LIKE UNDERSTAND IT WE UNDERSTAND IT ENOUGH TO TO M MODIFY IT 
YEP 
HOW WOULD WE DO THAT 
BY JUST MAKING LIKE IT W READ WRITE FOR EVERYONE 
'KAY WHO HAS MOST FREE SPACE IN THERE 
SOME HERE 
WELL WE ALTERNATIVELY WE CAN PROBABLY JUST MAKE ANOTHER DIRECTORY IN THE BEEFY SCRATCH SPACE 
I MEAN THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING GIGABYTES AND GIGABYTES OF STUFF TO THE MOMENT 
NO 
NO 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK IF HE SENDS OUT THE I THINK IF HE SENDS OUT THE PORT HE'D PROBABLY BE IN A BETTER POSITION 
YEAH 
HMM 
I THINK HE SAID YES IT THAT 
I THINK UH THAT WAS LIKE IN WHEN WE WERE STILL IN THE SEMINAR ROOM 
I ASKED THAT ONCE OR LIKE ASK IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET IT OFF AND NOBODY SAID LIKE PEOPLE WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT THE TECHNICAL PRACTICALITIES 
BUT NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT AL BEING ALLOWED TO OR NOT ALLOWED TO 
I MEAN WE HAVE ACCESS TO TO HERE AND I GUESS IT PROBABLY MEANS THAT WE WE CAN'T GIVE IT TO ANYBODY ELSE 
BUT 
BUT IF THEY GAVE US ACCESS TO TO HEAR O SITTING ON A DICE MACHINE 
THEN THERE SHOULDN'T BE A REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE IT IN OUR LAPTOP 
I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE TOO MANY FRIENDS WHO WOULD BE TOO KEEN ON GETTING IT ANYWAY 
I HAVE THAT REALLY EXCITED PIRATE COPIED THING 
IT ANNOTATED MEETING DATA 
HUH 
WAIT WAIT WAIT 
UM SORRY 
YEAH SORRY 
WHAT I JUST REALISED WE SHOULD REALLY TO KEEP DIFFERENT SERIESES COMPLETELY SEPARATE FOR VIRTUALLY ALL PURPOSES 
JUST LET'S BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE 
LIKE THE THE ICSI CORPUS ISN'T ISN'T ONE MEETING SERIES IT'S SEVERAL MEETING SERIES WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE MEETING FOR COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS 
FOR EACH MEETING 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY BUT LIKE LET'S JUST BE CAREFUL THAT WHATEVER WE SORT OF WE MERGE TOGETHER 
THAT LIKE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF MERGING IT'S NOT THE WHOLE ICSI CORPUS BUT INDIVIDUAL SERIES 
I THINK WE MIGHT ACTUALLY I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BE SOMEWHERE LIKE WELL OR SOMETHING LIKE IT 
UM I THINK WE MIGHT JUST GET AWAY WITH FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT JUST LIKE LOOKING AT ONLY ONE SERIES AND JUST DOING WITHIN ONE SERIES 
I MEAN YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT ONE ONE SERIES 
OH YEAH LET'S TAKE THAT 
SO THE USE THE DATA ALWAYS CLEARLY SPLIT UP BY DIFFERENT SERIES 
UH LIKE IS IT EASY TO JUST PICK ONE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO IT IT EVERY LEVEL EVERYONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL TO REALLY JUST TAKE EVEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL 
JUST TAKE STUFF FROM ONE SERIES AND NOT MERGE STUFF FROM DIFFERENT SERIES TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE JUST MAJORLY MESSY 
YEAH SO SO IT IS LIKE IF EVEN IF WE MAKE ONE SINGLE TEXT FILE WHICH HAS THE WHOLE CORPUS 
SORT OF OUR CORPUS THAT WOULD STILL BE FROM ONE SERIES ONLY 
W BUT IT WHAT YOU'RE PRODUCING AT THE MOMENT IS LIKE INDIVIDUAL TEXT FILES THAT SORT OF HAVE THE RAW TEXT FOR A WHOLE A MEETING IS A WHEEL OR 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
'KAY 
UM SO IS IS ANYBODY CREATING AN UH A REAL RAW TEXT THING AT THE MOMENT LIKE WHICH IS JUST THE WORDS 
YEAH THE 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA NEED AS WELL 
BUT I BUT IF THERE UH B AREN'T LIKE SO IT'S IT'S START AND END TIMES JUST FOR THE FILE 
LIKE IS IT JUST THE FIRST AND THE LAST LINE 
OR IS IT FOR EVERY SINGLE THING ON 
SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY JUST NOT PRINT OUT THAT 
OKAY 
IF YOU'RE NOT IT CAN YOU MAKE A TEXT FILE WHICH JUST LIKE MAKES JUST THE WORDS 
'KAY 
DO YOU WANT IT STRAIGHT FLOWING 
'CAUSE I WOULD NEED SOMETHING THAT MARKS THE END OF UH IF HE IS IS YOURS SEGMENTED BY TOPICS THEN THAT LIKE IS THERE ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE TO THE TOPIC 
AT THE AUTOMATED TOPIC TOPIC SEGMENTATION 
UH THEN I NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT LATER ANYWAY 
OKAY BUT FOR NOW IF YOU C 
OKAY 
YOU'RE GONNA PUT THAT IS AN OUTPUT OF YOURS THE SEGMENTATION 
OKAY SO FOR NOW CAN YOU CREATE LIKE SORT OF JUST UH A DUMP WHICH IS PURE TEXT 
JUST PURE TEXT SO THAT I CAN GET A DICTIONARY AND YOU CAN WORK ON THAT FOR YOUR TOPIC SEGMENTATION 
AND 
OR FOR FOR THE USERS 
BUT I CAN BUT I CAN ALSO DEAL WITH SEPARATE FILES I MEAN I CAN JUST WRITE THE ALGORITHM THAT IT LOADS ALL FILES IN A DIRECTORY OR SOMETHING 
BUT I MEAN IF YOU 
BUT IF YOU CAN PUT IT IN ONE SINGLE MEGA FILE THAT WOULD BE QUITE USEFUL FOR ME 
EVEN THOUGH FOR YOU WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER IF YOU HAD DIFFERENT FILES BECAUSE THEN YOU SORT OF KNOW LIKE 
YEAH 
SO GIVE ME GIVE ME DIFFERENT FILES AS LONG AS LIKE TO UM IF YOU COULD NAME THEM IN A WAY THAT IS EASY TO ENUMERATE OVER THEM 
LIKE WHATEVER ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE OR SOMETHING 
OR JUST ANYTHING THAT I CAN 
YEAH 
SO SO IT SOMETHING THAT'S EASILY ENU LIKE TO ENUMERATE OVER 
SO AT SOME JUST SOME ORDERED PATTERN 
OKAY COOL 
OKAY COOL 
YEAH 
IN THE RIGHT ORDER 
IT'S JUST A WISH LIST 
ORDERS 
WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL HAVE UM LIKE A PRIMITIVE SEGMENTATION BY SOME READY MADE TOPIC SEGMENTATION BY SOME READY MADE TOOL READY 
OKAY 
OKAY COOL 
'CAUSE I'LL NEED THAT THEN WHEN IT'S DONE 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
WHAT'S WHAT'S NINE MEGABYTE 
THE THE 
THAT SOUNDS QUITE REASONABLE 
THAT'S NINE NINE CHARACTERS OVER OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THAT AS FAR ARE WE ARE WE PICKING ONE PARTICULAR SERIES AT THE MOMENT 
OR 
YES 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH I GUESS WE CAN PROBABLY PROCESS THE DATA FOR ALL DIFFERENT SERIES AND THEN CHECK WHICH SERIES AS THE BEST FOR THE PRESENTATION 
IT SOUNDS QUITE REASONABLE NINE MEGABYTE 
I MEAN IF YOU THINK IF IT'S R ROUGHLY A MILLION WORDS AND NINE CHARACTERS PER WORD SOUNDS REALISTI 
YEAH 
YES I'M GONNA BUILD A DICTIONARY THEN FROM THAT 
LIKE JUST A LIST OF THE WORDS THAT MAYBE A LIST OF THE WORDS WITH THE FREQUENCIES OR A LIST OF THE WORDS SORTED ALPHABETICALLY OR NUMERICALLY 
WHAT WHAT DOES ANYONE WANT 
DOES THIS THERE ANY WISHES FOR DICTIONARIES 
SO I'LL CREATE A DICTIONARY 
DID DID THE STRUCTURE YEAH 
AND THEN THE ACTUAL FILE WE CAN PROBABLY LIKE COPY FROM YOUR HOME DIRECTORY OR SOMETHING LIKE IT 
YEAH YEAH BUT I'M SO I'M SAYING FOR THE WHOLE THING IN THE END 
THEN LIKE THE BIG THING WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO BY EMAIL 
YEAH 
UH FROM THE TIME I GOT THE FILE I CAN DO THAT IN AN AFTERNOON THE NEXT SORT OF THE NEXT MORNING 
UH YOU MEAN HOW LONG PROCESSING TIME IT TAKES 
UH IT'S A IT'S A BOG STANDARD ALGORITHM 
I'VE I'VE SORT OF I'VE WRITTEN IT FOR FOR DIL JUST IN HALF AN HOUR OR SOMETHING SIMILAR 
IT'S JUST YOU PUT THEM IN A HASH TABLE AND AND SAY WELL IF IT EXISTS ALREADY ON THE HASH TABLE THEN YOU INCREASE THE COUNT BY ONE AND I'LL PROBABLY IMPLEMENT SOME FILTER FOR FILTERING OUT NUMBERS OR SOMETHING 
REALLY 
HOW DO YOU DO THAT 
OKAY WELL I DON'T KNOW ANY PERL 
I MEAN IF ANYONE WANTS TO DO A PERL SCRIPT FOR THAT THAT DOES IT DOES IT NICELY I UH 
I'VE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT 
I BUT I THINK I HAVE THE JAVA CODE VIRTUALLY READY BECAUSE FOR DIL I WROTE SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR 
LIKE FOR DIL I WROTE SOMETHING THAT COUNTS THE THE DIFFERENT OCCURRENCES OF ALL THE TAGS UM 
SORRY 
THE HASH TABLE 
OH I'VE NEVER SERIALIZED ANYTHING 
WOULDN'T THAT BE ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE THOUGH 
AND THEN SERIALI AND THEN WRITE THE SERIALIZATION TO A FILE 
SO YOU WANT LIKE A S LIKE A FILE WHICH IS THE SERIALIZATION OF A HASH TABLE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I I'LL I'LL CHECK IF I UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS 
I MEAN OTHERWISE I CAN GIVE YOU THE CODE FOR LOADING A DICTIONARY 
GIVE YOU MY MY IT'S JUST IT'S IT'S SORT OF IT'S A LINE BREAK SEPARATED FILE YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH I'LL SEE IF I UNDERSTAND HOW TO SERIALIZE 
THERE'S A THERE'S A SERIALISE COMMAND IS THAT GIVES ME ONE MEGA MOTHER OF A S 
YEAH BUT DO THEY AUTOMATICALLY WRITE IT THE FILE ANYWAY I'LL I'LL FIGURE THAT IT 
WE DON'T HAVE TO 
YES SO THAT PRETTY MUCH 
PRETTY MUCH IT 
SO DAVE AND UM LOOK AT HOW NITE X. M. L. WORKS AND WE'RE 
HMM 
I'LL BUILD A DICTIONARY AS SOON AS I GOT THE TEXT 
AND YEAH SO THAT 
WHEN DO WE HAVE TO MEET AGAIN THEN WITH THIS 
HOW ARE WE GONNA DO A DEMONSTRATOR NEXT WEEK 
MY GOD 
NO NO NOT DEMONSTRATE BUT LIKE DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT HE DIDN'T WE SORT OF AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE A DEMONSTRATOR OF IT 
LIKE SOME PRIMITIVE THING WORKING NEXT WEEK 
THAT'S GOTTA BE VERY PROTOTYPE 
MM-HMM 
UH WELL LET'S GO 
SORRY 
I FEEL LIKE LIKE HANGING MID AIR AND NOT REALLY LIKE FINDING A POINT WHERE YOU CAN GET YOUR TEETH INTO IT AND START WORKING PROPERLY AND SO IT'S ALL IS FUZZY THE WHOLE 
YEAH BUT IT AT THE MOMENT BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S ALSO AN IMPLEMENTATIONAL LEVEL 
LIKE WITH THE DATA STRUCTURES I'M JUST LIKE OVER THESE VAGUE IDEAS OF SOME TREES I'M OF 
YEAH 
IT'S JUST WE ARE HALF WAY THROUGH THE PROJECT TIME TABLE 
THAT'S JUST WHAT FREAKS ME TOO 
UM 
YEAH 
YOU YOU HAVE THIS GOING BEHIND YOUR EARS THE YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
NO 
JUST MAYBE TALK ABOUT UM HOW YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR DATA FILE 
YEAH 
THAT'S UM THE INTERFACE BETWEEN HAVING THE TOPIC SEGMENTS AND CALCULATING THE UH INFORMATION IMPORTANCE OF WORDS 
YEAH 
SO I I WOULD NEED SEPARATE FILES FOR EACH SEGMENT OR JUST MAYBE HAVE DELIMITERS INBETWEEN EACH SEGMENT 
OKAY YEAH AND YOU THEN I CAN MAKE FILES OF THAT 
ALRIGHT 
NO I DON'T KNO KNOW IT IN 
YEAH THAT'S FINE 
I JUST I JUST NEED A A TITLE FOR THE FEEL ABOUT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT IS 
MM 
SO UH WE HAVE THEN WHEN WE ARE MIXING OUR UM VALUES TOGETHER SO IT UM A VALUE FOR EACH UM EXPRESSION FOR EACH SENTENCE OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
MM MM 
YEAH 
YEAH I WOULD JUST END UP WITH UH VALUES FOR EACH WORD SO I WOULDN'T HAVE UM 
ANY BOUNDARIES FOR SEGMENTS AT ALL 
I JUST I JUST WOULD HAVE THE WORDS AND THEN HOW WE UM HOW LONG EACH EXPRESSION WOULD BE I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH BUT WHAT IS AN UTTERANCE 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
SO WHAT WE WHAT WE WOULD FIT IN INTO THE XML FILES WOULD TO BE UH UM A VALUE FOR EACH UTTERANCE 
OR WHAT YOU 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
SO THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO FIT IN MORE THAN JUST ONE WHERE VALUES UM 
YEAH 
BUT UM 
MM UH-HUH 
YEAH IT'S BETTER 
SO WE N WOULD NEED A VALUE LABEL FOR EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS THAT ARE NOT DIALOGUE ACTS 
FOR ALL THOSE THAT POINT AT THE ACTUAL WORDS 
YEAH THAT'S THERE 
NO ABOVE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO YOU MEAN IN A AN ATTRIBUTE 
YEAH 
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIEST TO JUST INCORPORATE A NEW ATTRIBUTE IN IN THIS FILE 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY NOT VERY UH NICE BUT WOULD QUITE EASY WOULDN'T IT 
YEAH 
BUT THEY DISPLAY THE SEGMENTS IN OUR THAT THE UTTERANCES I IN THERE UM 
USER INTERFACE AS WELL WHERE THE WORDS ARE YOU UM DISPLAYED 
SO SO THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR UTTERANCES DISPLAYED ON THEIR INTERFACE 
SO THAT'S THEY UM ACCESS PROBABLY THIS FILE AND THEN THEY DISPLAY THE WORDS 
SO WHY SHOULDN'T WE BE ABLE TO DO THAT 
OH 
YEAH THE PROBLEM IS PROBABLY THAT UM I EXTRACT ALL THE WORDS AND THEN UH I DON'T UM AS AN I. D. OR SOMETHING FOR IT 
SO IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO WRITE IT BACK TO THE RIGHT POSITION 
IT DEPENDS ON THE POSITION I THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH I I COULD USE ANOTHER A DIFFERENT APPROACH THOUGH 
IT 
MM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
UM WOULD YOU THINK IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO JUST TAKE ME FILE FILES BY SPEAKER 
IT'S IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT INPUT I GIVE IT UM TO RAINBOW 
SO I JUST COULD GO AS THE FILES AS THEY ARE 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THAT WOULD GIVE AN OUTPUT 
I DON'T KNOW 
NO IT UM I THINK IT'S NOT UH VERSUS THE WHOLE CORPUS 
IT'S UM YOU HAVE CERTAIN CATEGORIES AND YOU MEASURE WHICH WORDS UM HAVE THE HIGHEST INFORMATION FOR ONE CATEGORY 
SO IT'S THE CATEGORIES ACROSS EACH OTHER I THINK 
UM PROBABLY YEAH 
BUT YEAH IT'S IT'S IS STRANGE 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WHAT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY 
I THINK THE INFORMATION GAIN IN RAINBOW IS ORDERED BY THE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION GAIN 
NOT I AM NOT SURE IF I CAN GET THE RIGHT ORDER AND THE VALUES 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
BUT I AM OF THE ORDER STAYS THE SAME IT'S NO PROBLEM AT ALL IT I JUST WRITE BACK AGAIN 
BUT IF UH IT'S ORDERED BY INFORMATION GAIN I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WORDS COME FROM BECAUSE IT'S IT HAS A BIG OF WORDS REPRESENTATION 
OH YES 
SO IT IS 
IT WAS MADE FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION 
YEAH THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
YEAH UM WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES IS THAT YOU YOU PUT IN SOME DOCUMENTS AND YOU HAVE SEVERAL DOCUMENTS PER CATEGORY 
UM AND YOU HAVE SEVERAL CATEGORIES 
AND THEN IT MEASURES UM WHICH WORDS ARE TYPICAL FOR A CERTAIN T CATEGORY 
AND IF YOU GOT A NEW DOCUMENT IT WILL UM COMPARE WHICH WORDS ARE IN THAT NEW DOCUMENT 
AND IF THERE ARE A LOT OF WORDS THAT UM ARE TYPICAL FOR ONE CATEGORY 
IT WILL ASSIGN TO TO THAT CATEGORY AND IF IT'S TYPICAL FOR ANOTHER ONE IT WILL ASSIGN TO TO THAT ONE 
YEAH IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE UM YOU UM YOU HAVE UM THE DIFFERENT FILES 
IF IF THIS IS YOUR DIRECTORY YOU HAVE UM UM A DIAGRA UM A DIRECTORY ONE TWO AND THERE 
AND THIS REPRESENTS THE CATEGORY 
EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THERE IS ONE CATEGORY ONE 
YEAH JUST SPLIT IT UP SOMEHOW YEAH 
YEAH 
NO I'VE JUST UM SPLIT THEM UP UH SOMEHOW UM BY UM THERE ARE SEVERAL DOCUMENTS FOR 
UM EACH MEETING AND I JUST PUT IN IN EACH CATEGORY 
SO UH IT'S IT'S NOT VERY SENSIBLE TO THE MOMENT BECAUSE I'M WAITING FOR THE UM TOPIC SEGMENTS ARE I'M JUST YEAH 
YEAH YEAH PROBABLY 
YEAH MAYBE IT'S IT'S BETTER IF I WROTE IT MYSELF BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S IT EASY TO JUST SPLIT THINGS UP INTO BINS 
AND IT IT WOULDN'T BE ANY WORK AT ALL IN TERMS OF PROGRAMMING OR SOMETHING 
ALRIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HOW DOES IT CALCULATE THAT ACTUALLY 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT THAT'S THE S UH ALMOST I THINK SIMILAR TO WHAT I'M DOING BECAUSE WORDS THAT ARE ON EVERY CLASS 
THAT ARE NOT VERY INFORMATIVE BUT WORDS THAT ARE ONLY ONE ONE CLASS ARE ARE VERY INFORMATIVE FOR THAT CLASS 
OH OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S THE YEAH 
FOR A SPECIFIC WORD PER 
PER 
ALL OVER THE PLACE 
AND IN MY CASE IT WOULD HAVE I THINK IT WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT UH VALUES FOR EACH CATEGORY 
BUT IN THAT CATEGORY IT WOULD HAVE THE SAME VALUE TO EACH PLACE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
YEAH 
UM THAT WOULD BE BEST BUT I I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK OF THAT 
UM AT LEAST IT WORKS IF THERE ARE SEVERAL CATEGORIES WITH EACH WITH ONE DOCUMENT EACH BUT IT UM YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S THE QUESTIO YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
MM-HMM 
MM OKAY 
OH NO I LI I TH I THOUGHT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE DO UM WE JUST SPLIT I NEED SOMEWHERE TO SPLIT 
AND THAT UM SPLITTING AT CATEGORY BOUNDARIES UM SPLITTING AT TOPIC BOUNDARIES WOULD A NICE THING TO DO RATHER THAN JUST SPLITTING SOMEWHERE 
SO YEAH YEAH 
YEAH BUT IT I THINK IT SHOULD WORK FOR JUST ONE DOCUMENT BECAUSE IT IT COMPARES BETWEEN THE CATEGORIES 
AND IF YOU JUST HAVE ONE DOCUMENT UM IT STILL CAN FIND OUT WHICH WORDS ARE INFORMATIVE FOR THAT CATEGORY AND WHICH ARE NOT 
SO IF YOU HAVE JUST ONE DOCUMENT IN EACH CATEGORY AND THERE ARE A LOT OF UM OCCURRENCES OF THE WORD THE ON EACH ONE 
SO THIS WORD WILL BE NOT VERY INFORMATIVE ACROSS THE CATEGORIES 
SO IT SHOULD WORK FOR ONE BUT I'M NOT SURE OF HOW EXACTLY IT TO UM CALCULATES EVERYTHING 
UH I THINK IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO LIKE THAT UP 
YEAH MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE A LIST THAT IT'S O THAT IS ORDERED BY 
YEAH DON'T KNOW 
MM-HMM 
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT 
IT'S UH 
MM-HMM 
OH RIGHT 
MM 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH YOU YOU CAN USE UM 
SOME KIND OF UM TRUNCATION MAYBE IF YOU ATTACH A NUMBER TO EACH WORD AND SAY THAT IT SHOULD OMIT THE LAST PART 
UH PROBABLY NOT 
NO NO 
YEAH MAYBE I SHOULD TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND JUST PROGRAMME IT FOR MYSELF 
BECAUSE UM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT HOW CAN WE GET TO KNOW WHAT MAKES SENSE IS A A FUNCTION FOR JOINING EVERYTHING TOGETHER 
MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO FIND THAT IT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YOU YOU COULD ALWAYS FIND OUT HOW MANY WORDS THERE ARE IN AN UTTERANCE COULDN'T YOU 
YEAH 
SO 
FOR EXAMPLE 
MM 
SO BUT 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH THEN WE SH YEAH 
WE COULD EVEN YEAH WE COULD EVEN HAVE A LOOK AT ARE DIFFERENT MEASURES IF THEY UM 
COME UP WITH THE SAME SAME KINDS OF YEAH 
UH I THINK IF I CAN PROVIDE SOMETHING FOR THE WORDS AS THEY ARE 
IT'S STATED FROM WHERE IT WHERE THE SEGMENTS GO 
IT SHOULD BE UH SHOULD BE POSSIBLE 
YEAH SO IT MUST SHOULD BE POSSIBLE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YOU MEAN BY MATCHING STRINGS 
OR WHAT 
YEAH BUT WHAT I'VE DONE IS UM A PARSER AN X. M. L. PARSER WHERE YOU CAN GET THE START TIMES 
SO YEAH THAT'S QUITE EASY BECAUSE IT'S IT'S AN ATTRIBUTE AND YOU JUST USE SAY THAT YOU WANT THE VALUES OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES 
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES ME 
BUT 
MM 
SO LAUGHTER ANNOTATED AT ALL 
BECAUSE YOU COULD TAKE THAT ONE REUSE IT MAYBE 
IF YOU TAKE THE LAUGHTER OUT AND THEN CALCULATE IT 
MM 
YEAH 
NOT THE MOMENT 
MAYBE IF WE MEET AT THE WEEKEND 
UH I DON'T KNOW 
YEP 
SO UH ON HOW ABOUT THE THE PROTOTYPE 
IF WE WANT TO SHOW HIM SOMETHING ON MONDAY WE DEFINITE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER 
SOME OF US AT LEAST HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET IT RUNNING PROBABLY 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH ME TOO 
YEAH AND ALSO WE DON'T HAVE TO RECALCULATE IF JUST ONE 
OKAY 
HMM 
IT'S WITH CAMERAS 
YOU LOOK QUITE FUNNY AT THE MOMENT TIM 
NICE 
MM YES 
YES PERHAPS YEAH BUT I MEAN THEY'RE ALL VERY VERY SIMILAR ALL THOSE X. M. L. FILES 
I HAD UM A LOOK AT THE UM FOR EXAMPLE A. S. 
MM 
TAKE MOZILLA 
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD BE UM I MEAN UH FOR ME IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO SAY O ONE 
YOU KNOW W UM WHAT SCOPE ONE ANNOTATION WOULD HAVE 
I THINK IT WOULD BE CERTAINLY MORE THAN ONE WORD AND 
I THINK IT WOULD WORK BEST WITH UTTERANCES ARE SEGMENTS 
I THINK JUST THE SEGMENTS AS THEY'RE SEGMENTED IN THE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE POINT IS POINT SIX FIVE 
I THINK SO 
AND YOU WOULD IS PROBABLY STILL NEED UM YOUR VALUES FOR THE WORDS UM PERHAPS FOR FOR UM THE KEYWORDS THAT ARE DISPLAYED 
WHEN YOU CLICK ON SOMETHING 
YEAH BUT THAT'S ANOTHER REPRESENTATION THEN I THINK OF FOR THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE 
SHOULD YEAH 
UM UP 
YES 
NO IT'S NOT 
IT'S UM FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S UH B. D. B. A. A. IN C. POINT SIX 
UH I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING VERY MUCH BUT YEAH THAT'S THAT'S IT 
CAN YOU USE A BIGGER FONT 
OKAY SO HERE THERE'S FOR UM EACH SEGMENT UM UH THAT'S REALLY ALL SEGMENTS I MEAN IT'S IT CAN BE WORDS OR TOPICS ARE UM ANYTHING I THINK 
UM THAT'S WHY THE IT'S FOR EXAMPLE TIME PROVENANCE DIALOGUE ACT OR TIME PROVENANCE SEGMENT OR TIME PROVENANCE 
NO BUT IT YEAH 
YEAH IT UP UH WELL SOME OF THEM POINT AT THE WORDS OTHER OTHERS POINT AT THE UM DIALOGUE ACTS 
SO THAT'S KIND OF THE GLOBAL THING THAT TIES TOGETHER OTHER THINGS 
UM 
YEAH THEY HAVE THEIR NITE I. D. THE TIME 
THE SEGMENT IS WHAT IS DISPLAYED ON ON LINE UM BY NOT 
YEAH IT LOOKS UH UH THE SEGMENT THING LOOKS ON THE INTO THE WORDS X. M. L. FILE AND THE DIALOGUE ACTS 
UM THING 
YEAH I THINK IT'S IN A DIFFERENT 
UM 
IN THEIR THEIR ANNOTATION OF DIALOGUE ACTS 
AND ONE UM SEGMENT CAN HAVE OUR ON UM IF THIS WORD STRINGS THAT ARE PRESENTED IN ONE LINE CAN HAVE SEVERAL UM DIALOGUE ACTS ANNOTATED ON IT 
THAT'S WHY 
YEAH IT'S FROM WORDS 
YES 
THAT'S JUST BELOW 
BUT I THINK THOSE SEGMENTS ARE PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST O ONE TYING ALL THE OTHERS TOGETHER 
AND THE INFORMATION OR OR I MEAN WE ARE GOING TO CREATE A FILE THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE UM THE WORDS FILE 
I THINK 
YES 
YEAH THEY ARE 
UM TO DISCOURSE MARKER DIS F. MARKER FI POINT FIVE 
YEAH THAT'S THERE IN ONE UP UP 
GO UP 
YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH THIS IS ALL THE SPEAKER D. 
YOU NEED THE SPEAKER D. 
YES 
UM YOU CAN SEE WHETHER THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE OR NOT 
YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE W UM W. POINT UM FIRST IT'S W. POINT UM FIVE UH FIFTY FOUR AND THEN IT'S SEVENTY SIX 
SO THERE ARE UM THIS NUMBER OF UTTERANCES OF OTHER SPEAKERS IN BETWEEN 
YEAH I THINK WE WOULD ALSO NEED TWO OF THIS 
YEAH I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURE IN THAT POINTS TO TO WHERE WE TIE TOGETHER ALL OUR INFORMATION 
SO WE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE TO MAKE ONE THAT'S SIMILAR 
YES AND UH THEN ANOTHER ONE THAT WOULD PERHAPS GIVE THE ACTUAL PROBABILITY VALUE 
YEAH IT COULD COULD PROBABLY BE IN THE SAME FILE I DON'T KNOW 
BUT IF YOU HAVE SEVERAL LAYERS THEN 
YOU CAN'T REPRESENT THEM IN THE SAME FILE 
YEAH ONE SEGMENT POINT ONE 
UM THERE LINE BELOW 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I MEANT ACTUALLY YEAH 
MM-HMM 
UM 
BUT I I MEAN THERE'S NOT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT IS IN IN THE C CORPUS IN THERE IN THE SEGMENTS FILE 
I THINK THAT IS JUST THE UM THINGS THAT ARE LOADED EVERY TIME BUT WE HAVE LAZY LOADING SO IT CAN LOAD MORE THAN THAT 
PERHAPS WE COULD JUST TRY TO COPE 
UM YOU KNOW IT 
MAKE OUR FILE ONE OF THOSE LAZY LOADED 
BUT I MEAN I'VE NO REAL IDEA HOW THAT WORKS 
YEAH BUT YES BUT IT HAS UM YOU KNOW A BASIC THING THAT IT LOADS I THINK 
SO FOR EXAMPLE EVERY TIME IT LOADS THE SEGMENT THINGS IT CAN'T IT CAN'T NOT DISPLAY WORDS I THINK 
AND IT ERAS 
I THINK SO 
THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTOOD IT 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE IN THE ON THE OTHER THINGS THERE IS AN INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE PARTICIPANT NAME IS AND SO NO 
SO 
IN THE SEGMENTS FILE IT'S REALLY THE VERY BASIC THAT HAVE TO BE DISPLAYED FOR ANY THING 
YEAH I THIN I MEAN IT WOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT TO UM CREATE A FILE OF THE P SH OF THAT SHAPE 
I MEAN THAT WOULD BE ONE PROBLEM 
UM YEAH I I DON'T KNOW HOW ABOUT YOU WITH YOUR WORDS 
BUT UM FOR MY SEGMENTS WERE THE UM F. ZERO MEASUREMENTS AND ALL THESE VALUES I GOT FROM THERE 
UM I ALWAYS STORE THE BIG UH START AND END TIME OF EVERYTHING I CALCULATED THERE IS I WOULD JUST HAVE TO PU PUT IT UH YES 
YEAH IT IS 
UH CUT BUT ACTUALLY MY SEGMENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME AS THEIR SEGMENTS BECAUSE AND THEIR SEGMENTS THERE ARE UM PAUSE UM PAUSES SOMETIMES 
UM YES BUT UH YEAH I MEAN ONE SEGMENT OF THEIRS IS SOMETIMES TWO SEGMENTS OF MINE THAT'S JUST WHAT I MEANT 
YEAH BUT FOR EXAMPLE I MADE A FILE THAT CONTAINS JUST THE UM START TIMES 
IT COULD CONTAIN END TIMES AND WORDS FOR ALL SPEAKERS OF ALL MEETINGS 
I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE SAME THING SO I GAVE YEAH SO I GIVE IT YOU 
BUT UM UH DISPLAYING ALSO A START AND END TIMES OF EVERY WORD 
SO YOU COULD PERHAPS USE IT TO MATCH UM IT WITH YOUR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU GOT COULDN'T YOU 
PERL A PERL SCRIPT YEAH 
NO NO 
MM YEAH 
BUT WOULD YOU THEN NOT GET THE TYPICAL WORDS FOR EVERY SPEAKER 
IF YOU 
BECAUSE IT WOULD THEN SAY HOW TO FIND THAT IT'S THAT SPEAKER 
YEAH 
IT'S PROBABILITY YEAH 
OR OR VOL YEAH 
SO COULD YOU PUT THE MORE INFORMATION BACK IN THEN 
YEAH BUT THE TOPIC ISN'T IT 
THAT'S A TOPIC INFORMATION 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO HOW SURE OR UNSURE YOU ARE ABOUT THE WHAT'S FOLLOWING OUR B OUR CONTEXT MEASURES YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT DO WE HAVE ENOUGH INFORMA ENOUGH DATA FOR THAT IT GIVES US SENSIBLE THINGS 
BECAUSE I MEAN THE THE WORDS WE'RE LIKE REALLY LOOKING FOR APPEAR NOT TOO OFTEN 
AND IF THEY APPEAR FIVE TIMES IN THE MEETING AND THEY HAVE EACH TIME A DIFFERENT 
YOU KNOW DIFFER SOME DIFFERENT SURROUNDED WORDS PERHAPS WE HAVE NOT ENOUGH DATA 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU 
YEAH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
BUT THAT WOULD GIVE THE SAME VALUE FOR ONE WORD EVERY TIME I MEAN FOR FOR A SPECIFIC WORD 
YEAH BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD BE QUITE EASY TO RE INTEGRATE IT INTO SUCH A 
OKAY BUT THEN IT WOULD ALSO BE POSSIBLE TO RE INTEGRATE IT 
IT WOULD BE MORE DIF I MEAN IT WOULD BE A BIT MORE WORK BUT THEN 
YES 
UM AND WHAT WELL WHAT SCORE WOULD A WORD GET THAT JUST OCCURS ONCE IN ALL THE CORPUS FOR EXAMPLE 
EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE ALL THE OTHER SOME TOPICS WHERE IT DOESN'T OCCUR 
MM-HMM 
SO WOULD TO BE HIGHER SCORED THAN A WORD THAT UM OCCURS 
NO 
VERY UM SEQUENCE OF THE SAME TOPIC 
YEAH I MEAN UM WE HAVE UH SO UH ARE SEVERAL TOPICS 
FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE TWENTY TOPICS AND UM FOR ONE OF THESE TOPICS THERE ARE FIVE OCCURRENCES AND WE HAVE ONE WORD THAT 
YES BUT ACROSS MEETINGS UM THERE WILL BE THE SAME TOPIC SEVERAL TIMES 
OH 
IT WASN OKAY 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT YOU WERE DOING 
YEAH BUT 
YEAH BUT YOU MAKE ALSO UM SEGMENT SIMILARITY I THINK THAT WAS I I THOUGHT THAT WOULD 
AND THEY THEY ARE NOT RELATED THEN AT OTHER BLOCKS OF 
OKAY 
I UM 
OH OKAY 
I MISUNDERSTOOD THAT THEN 
SO YEAH HOW WOULD IT WORK 
I MEAN WHAT WOULD 
UM THE HAS INFORMATION THEN BE USEFUL FOR ONE OR RAINBOW 
UM I THOUGHT THE POINT ABOUT THAT WAS THAT WE WOULD PUT UM NOT SO UM SERIAL CATEGORIES ALL THE SEGMENTS OF THE SAME TOPIC ACROSS MEETINGS 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT BUT THEN IT DOES OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
YEP 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
YES 
YEAH I MEAN I HAVEN'T REALLY DECIDED ON UH HOW IT REALLY GET THE INFORMATION OUT OF THIS NOW 
BECAUSE UM WHEN I HAVE FOR EXAMPLE UM INCREASED SPEAKER OVERLAP THAT APPLIES TO SEVERAL TURNS OF COURSE 
BUT I COULD GIVE ME THE INFORMATION ABOUT YEAH HOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS 
YEAH 
PROS UM BUT YOU PROPOSED UM WE WE SHOULD BREAK THAT DOWN TO HAVE UM THE SMALLEST UM SMALLEST UM UNITY UM OF TIME DURATION SHOULD BE ONE WORD 
I MEAN THAT WOULD BE BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE WHAT NATURALLY CAME OUT OF HER THING 
AND 
YEAH SURE BUT I COULD THEN IF I IF I HAVE UM THE VALUE FOR A SEGMENT I WOULD PERHAPS JUST GIVE ALL THE 
IMPORTANT WOR OR MM YEAH NO 
YES 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT SOMEONE HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN AYE 
I WOULD PROBABLY SOMEHOW HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN TO TO THAT LEVEL YEAH 
YES SURE 
YEAH PROBABLY SOMEHOW IT SHOULD WORK THAT WAY 
YEAH BUT THEN OKAY BUT THE AT THAT MOMENT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO JUST MAKE IT IN A PER SEGMENT BASIS RIGHT AWAY 
AND LET HER ADAPT IT ALSO AT THE SEGMENT BASIS 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN MINE ARE ONLY MORE BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME START AND END POINT 
SOMETIMES THEY'RE TWO SEGMENTS AND ONE WITH A GAP IN BETWEEN BUT UM THE HAVE UM THE THE THEY DON'T OVERLAP 
NO NO THEY DON'T BUT UM 
UM 
THEY'RE I MEAN MY SEGMENTS OVERLAP ON THE SAME WAY AS THEIRS DO 
BUT SOMETIMES I HAVE UM SPLIT ONE OF THE SEGMENTS INTO TWO SEGMENTS BUT IT'S EASY TO MATCH THE START AND END TIMES TO MAP IT AT THEIR SEGMENTS 
I H HOPE SO YEAH 
MM-HMM YEAH 
THAT WOULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT BUT YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN THAT'S WHAT I'M ALREADY DOING WITH MY IS UH SEPARATE 
YEAH IT'S TELLS YOU EVEN WHICH WORDS TO USE 
YEP 
SHOULD BE POSSIBLE 
YEP 
YEAH I HOPE TO HAVE SOME VALUE QUITE SOON 
BUT UM I JUST WORKED UM I MEAN I JUST CALCULATED THE VALUES VALUES FOR UM THE AVERAGE F. ZEROS AND UM THEY'RE WHAT'S C I MEAN I DIDN'T HAVE A LOOK AT THE DATA YET 
BUT UM THEY VARY QUITE WIDELY EVEN FOR THE SAME SPEAKER ACROSS MEETINGS 
SO ONE SPEAKER HAD UM AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT A HUN ONE HUNDRED UM IN ONE MEETING AND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY IN ANOTHER MEETING THAT'S REALLY THAT'S STRANGE 
I MEAN PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE OF LAUGHTER OR SOMETHING THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT I DIDN'T HAVE 
I'LL PROBABLY LOOK AT IT 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I READ IN ONE OF THOSE PAPERS UH AS WELL BUT 
YEAH BUT IT COULD MESS UP THINGS QUITE CONSIDERABLY 
YEAH 
BUT UH OR YEAH 
BUT ALL THIS IS QUITE YOU KNOW DATA INTENSIVE 
I WHEN I UM LET THE UM JUST CALCULATE THE AVERAGE F. ZERO LEVELS 
IT I THINK IT NEEDED MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN WHAT HAVE HALF AN HOUR F TO DELAY IT FOR OUR MEETINGS 
BECAUSE UM YEAH UM I MEAN WE HAVE SEVENTY FIVE HOURS PER YEAH 
AV AVERAGE OF SIX SPEAKERS AND THEY'RE MEASURED EVERY O. POINT O. ONE SIX SECONDS 
AND THAT GIVES US QUITE A LOT OF VALUES 
YEAH WHAT I DID AT THE MOMENT IS UM I M YEAH I GOT THE F. ZERO VALUES FROM FOR EACH SPEAKER FOR HIS HEADPHONE 
AND I ONLY TAKE THIS UM THE W UH THAT WERE RECORDED AT THE TIME WHERE HE WAS ACTUALLY SPEAKING 
AND FOR THIS I CALCULATED UM THE AVERAGE 
ZERO 
SO THAT GAVE ME UM NEW ONE VALUE PER SPEAKER PER MEETING 
NO NO THAT'S JUST THE AVERAGE 
NO THAT I YEAH 
YES I MEAN I ARE JUST UH NEEDED TO HAVE THIS VALUE NOW TO RELATE UM UM HOW YEAH 
YEAH I THINK 
YEAH 
UM AMUSEMENT AND SO ONE IS YEAH 
YEAH 
I I I MEAN IT I ACTUALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHAT CAUSES THESE UM 
BECAUSE IT'S QUITE FUNNY TO HAVE A M MALE SPEAKING AT TWO HUN TWO HUNDRED UM 
YEAH SURE ABOUT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AND I AM AT THE MOMENT FIDDLING AROUND WITH MY DATA AND NOT QUITE SEEING HOW I GET IT A SENSIBLE ABSTRACTION LEVEL YOU KNOW 
FROM MY VERY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO I MEAN YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH SOME DATA EVEN IF IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE 
TRY UH TRY YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IF IT'S ALREADY ON SEGMENTS BASE THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH 
LOOK'S GOOD 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE I THINK 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WE HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH TO TALK ABOUT I DON'T THINK 
YEAH 
YES WE CAN DO THAT 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH WELL THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS 
IT'S GOT DELIMITERS IN BETWEEN THE MORE THE BOUNDARIES 
BUT 
YEAH IF YOU'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT YEAH 
AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEED A A LABEL FOR EACH SEGMENT 
BUT I MEAN THE MOST I C YOU DON'T NEED A ONE 
WELL I COULD GIVE YOU AN I. D. BUT IT'D BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY GIVE A TOPIC A TOTAL 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S NO PROBLEM 
HMM 
MM 
UM SO IT INTO SEGMENTS 
OR IS IT DIALOGUE ACT DIALOGUE ACTS 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT'S IT YEAH 
YEAH THEY'VE ALL GOT AN I. D. FOR EACH UTTERANCE 
YEAH AND IT'S GOT A DIFFERENT UH FILE FOR EACH SPEAKER 
NO NO IT JUST POINTS AT THE AT THE WORDS 
YEAH YEAH 
TH I SUPPOSE SO THE UTTERANCES 
BUT ALSO INCLUDES THINGS LIKE LIKE 
YEAH THINK SO 
MM 
YEAH CAN YOU NOT JUST LEAVES THOSE LINES BLANK 
OH ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
HMM 
YEAH WHAT DID YOU USE TO MAKE THAT FILE 
JUST IN PERL 
YOU DIDN'T USE AN X. M. L. PARSER 
OKAY 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
WELL LIKE FUNCTION WORDS AND STUFF 
MM 
HMM 
WELL UM WHEN IT SPLITS THE TOPICS UP IT DOES DO IT ON REGULAR WORDS THAT UM THAT OCCUR 
BUT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE NO 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU CAN'T REALLY GET ANY OTHER OUTPUT 
NO 
NO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IT'S SUPPOSED TO SPLIT IT INTO CU COHERENT TOPICS WITH THE SIMILAR INFORMATION 
HMM 
HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
YEAH 
UH I'M SURE IT'D BE QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD SOME OF THE TASKS WE HAVE TO DO 
BUT YET NO NO REALLY UNDERSTANDS THEM THE ACTUAL X. M. L. PARSING 
HMM 
YEAH THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN IDEA 
YEAH 
YEAH JUST SEND US AN EMAIL AND TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING 
RIGHT 
HMM 
THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE JUST 
HE SAID THAT 
OKAY THERE 
GROUP K. 
DO 
YEAH 
YEAH I GUESS 
WHATEVER 
IT'S YEAH I NEVER GET THIS IS WHAT'S THE POINT OF OF THIS IS STRAPLESS IF THIS STRAP'S SUPPOSED TO GO BEHIND M I OBVIOUSLY DOING THIS WRONG 
OBVIOUSLY FAILING THIS LIKE WHATEV CALLING CENTRE AND TRUE 
LIKE THIS AND THEN YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT THE SHIT HAS TO DO NOW 
OKAY 
YES SO UM ACTUALLY I JUST REALISE I DON'T HAVE POWER LET ME JUST SWITCH ON THE OTHER WHICH IS GONNA RUN IT 
OKAY 
SO THERE'S PROBABLY NOT MUCH TO TALK ABOUT AT THE MOMENT IN TERMS OF LIKE TALKING ABOUT EACH OTHER'S STUFF I MEAN BEYOND WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY 
SO WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING SO MAYBE IF WE TRY TO REALLY MAKE SENSE TOGETHER OF THE X. M. L. FORMAT TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN ALL PRODUCE THE DATA THAT WE ARE PRODUCING IN A WAY OR AT LEAST I MEAN I GUESS MY DATA I'LL PROBABLY OLD ONE FROM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY ANYWAY BECAUSE IT'S MATRIX 
BUT ALL THIS STUFF THAT GOES WITH ANNOTATION THAT WE HAVE IT IN THE RIGHT FORMAT 
MAYBE IF WE JUST SORT OF POOL WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE X. M. L. FORMAT AND TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF IT 
I DON'T AT ALL KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT THIS 
UM WHAT I DID JUST NOW SO I DOWNLOADED 
UM I DOWNLOADED SOME 
FALSE 
SOME X. M. L. FILES AND I WAS THINKING IF WE MAYBE JUST SHOULD GO THROUGH SOME OF THEM AND LIKE TRY TO SEE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL STRUCTURE AND POOL TOGETHER WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE 
WHAT WE THINK THAT THINGS MEAN 
AND THEN TALK ABOUT HOW THE ANNOTATION FOR INFORMATION DENSITY AND STUFF SHOULD MAYBE BE STRUCTURED IN A SIMILAR WAY 
OR BUT I DON'T RE I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN IDEA LIKE WHAT OTHER WORDS WHAT WE WOULD DO TODAY IN THIS MEETING 
I MEAN 
WHAT'S THAT PART 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES SO DOES ANYONE HAVE A GOOD IDEA WHERE TO START LIKE WHICH WHAT IS WHAT IS IT WE TALK ABOUT GETTING IN AT THE MOMENT 
WE'RE BASICALLY JUST 'CAUSE THE TWO IF YOU WILL MERGE YOUR DATA TOGETHER RIGHT 
IN SOME WAY LIKE I IN THE END IT'LL RESULT IN ONE ANNOTATION 
SO THE ONLY THING WE'RE TRYING TO TO ONE IS JUST AN ADDITIONAL ANNOTATION WHICH IS SIMILAR TO 
THE ANNOTATION ABOUT WHAT WHAT WOULD TO BE SO MOST SIMILAR TO 
SIMPLY TO THE SEGMENTATION INFORMATION OR 
OKAY 
I'M NOT SURE IT UH 
SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING 
NOT SURE WHAT SOFTWARE I HAVE TO THE MOMENT WHICH WOULD BE HELLO 
UM 
YEAH 
DOES ANYONE KNOW ANY GOOD STANDARDS SOFTWARE DISPLAYS X. M. L. I'M NOT SURE 
YEAH BUT I'M AFRAID I ONLY HAVE FIREFOX AND FIREFOX DOESN'T HAVE THE NICE X. M. L. VIEWER ANYMORE 
I THINK I DON'T HAVE MOZILLA 
NO 
I CAN PROBABLY JUST EMACS THEM 
BUT 
BUT GOING FROM FROM A WORD BUSINESS WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER TO THEN GO BACK AND CALCULATE FOR EACH UTTERANCE 
YOU KNOW WHO WHO CH TURN SO IF WE 
YEAH 
SO DO 
DOES ANYONE DOES ANYONE KNOW IN WHICH FILE THE ACTUAL LIKE WHAT'S IT CALLED THE SPLITTING INTO THE UTTERANCES 
SO IS CALLED IS THAT 
SO IT 
WHAT DOES IT AND WITH 
DOES IT WITH WITH SIX 
DOES THAT LIKE LIKE IT 
OKAY 
BE NICE 
LET'S ACTUALLY JUST USE OF MAYBE K. RIGHT 
UH THIS IS HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND JUST GETTING THE RIGHT SOFTWARE GOING 
SO THAT BETTER TO USE 
I GUESS YEAH WHAT AND BLACK IS BETTER TO USE 
SO JUST SO IF I CAN VIEW 
OKAY 
SO 
THIS THIS 
BUT WHAT IS THIS 
I MEAN THIS DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY CONTENT 
LIKE ANY TEXT 
OH WAIT SOMEBODY S S SOMEBODY EXPLAIN THAT SLOWLY TO ME 
SO 
SO WHAT DO ALL THESE THINGS IN THIS FILE HAVE IN COMMON 
WHAT WHAT ARE THEY 
NO BUT WE LIKE UH SO THEY ARE THEY ARE SEGMENTS IN WHAT SENSE 
WH WHAT'S DEFINITION OF A SEGMENT THEN 
OKAY 
AND 
AND THAT'S USUALLY DIALOGUE WHAT WHAT'S DIFFERENCE I BETWEEN PROVENANCE DIALOGUE ACT AND BETWEEN SEGMENTER 
I DON'T 
A DIALOGUE ACT UH A DIALOGUE ACT ANNOTATIONS OF DIALOGUE ACT 
SO SO THAT JUST ANOTHER REPRESENTATION OF TEXT 
JUST SO CAN WE HAVE THOSE FILES SOMEWHERE 
SO THE STUFF THAT'S 
THAT'S CALLED SEGMENT HERE THAT DO WE KNOW WHICH FILE THIS IS PULLING FROM 
FROM YEAH IT'S IT'S C IT FROM WORDS X. M. L. IS THAT IT'S SAYING HERE 
LET ME SEE IF I HAVE THAT WORDS X. M. L. FILE 
SO LET'S FOR EXAMPLE LIKE IT 
OKAY LET ME JUST TRY TO GET THEM ALL IT A DIFFERENT SCREEN 
UH UH SO THAT WHAT WE WERE 
SORRY I'M JUST I'M TRYING TO ARRANGE THEM IS THAT WE HAVE ONE ABOVE THE OTHER IS TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF THAT 
SO NO 
HERE WE HAD 
UM I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE SEGMENTS FILE IS ABOUT 
LIKE IT'S IT'S REFERENCING HERE IT'S REFERENCING TO 
IT A CERTAIN POSITION ON THE ON THE WORDS FILE 
SO IT'S THAT NON VOCAL SOUND AN HOUR 
THAT'S THE MIC NOISE OKAY 
BUT WHAT'S THE DOES IT ALWAYS JUST UH NO IT'S IT'S REFERENCING TO SEVERAL WORD STRUCTURES 
SO THIS WOULD BE BASICALLY BE A A SEQUENCE RIGHT 
SO THAT'S FROM W. FIFTY TWO 
ARE THEY NOT ORDERED OR UH YEAH FROM W. FIFTY TWO DOWN TO W. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT 
AND YEAH W SORRY 
OKAY 
SO THIS IS THIS IS SOMEBODY SAYING IT IT DOESN'T 
DO WE HAVE ANY CONFIRMATION DO WE ACTUALLY SEE FROM THIS FILE WHO'S DOING IT JUST OUT OF INTEREST 
OH 
SORRY ONE SPEAKER D. 'S FILE 
SO THIS IS WHERE HE'D LIKE TIME STOPS 
AND THEN IT ONLY STARTS AT A LATER TIME BECAUSE UH YOU DON'T SEE WHEN I'M POINTING AT SCREEN IT'S JUST FOR THIS 
SO THEN IT STARTS HERE THIS TIME AGAINST SPEAKER D. BECAUSE IN BETWEEN THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO THE THE FILE WITH ANNOTATIONS FOR INFORMATION DENSITY WHAT WOULD THAT BE LIKE 
WOULD THAT BE LIKE THE SEGMENTS FILE GIVING A START WORD AND AND WORD OR OR WOULD THAT 
HOW WOULD THAT BE TO BEST TIE IN WITH THE SYSTEM 
SORRY 
SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS OR LIKE WHERE YOU GIVE SORT OF A REFERENCE TO A BEGINNING AND AN END POSITION 
WELL THAT WOULD BE IN THE SAME FILE WOULDN'T IT 
IT WOULD JUST COULDN'T WE HAVE A LIKE UH 
I GUESS WE COULD INTRODUCE A DIFFERENT UM 
WE HAVE FOR NOW IF WE JUST DO SOMETHING WHICH FOR EVERY 
SEGMENT IN HERE ATTACHES ACTUALLY CAN WE NOT TO TO TO THE SEGMENTS FILE 
WOULD THAT NOT BE THE WAY HOW THEY WOULD WANT TO TO HAVE TO DO IS IF WE IN THE END 
IF WE WANT TO ATTACH TO EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS ONE NUMBER FOR NOW 
AND THOSE SEGMENTS HAVE UH DO THEY HAVE AN I. D. 
YEAH I GUESS THEY DO 
SO THIS IS THE I. D. OF A SPECIFIC SEGMENT RIGHT 
YEAH SO WOULDN'T IT I MEAN THE PROBLEM IS THEY'VE ME HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE EXACT INNER WORKINGS OF THREE OF THEIR ENGINEERED 
BUT YOU'D THINK THAT THE EASIEST WAY AND THE WAY THAT HOW IT'S INTENDED TO BE WOULD BE JUST 
IF WE HAVE HERE A LINK TO THE SEGMENT A LIKE AN I. D. FOR THAT SEGMENT 
THAT WE JUST CREATE ANOTHER FILE WHICH LINKS TO THE SEGMENT AND THEN HAS AN ADDITIONAL VALUE WHICH IS THE NUMBER 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH OH SORRY I I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVING TWO FILES 
I WAS THINK YEAH I I THINK THAT I I UNDERSTOOD WRONG 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WANTING TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT X. M. L. FILES WITH IN THE REFERENCE AND ONE JUST THE JUST THE NUMBER 
AND I WAS THINKING THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT YOU MEANT JUST UM HAVING LIKE FOR EACH SORT OF OF OUR SEGMENTS HAVING JUST THE I. D. 
WHICH IS REFERENCING TO THOSE SEGMENTS HERE AND ANOTHER ATTRIBUTE WHICH IS THE THE VALUE 
SO THIS WHOLE INFORMATION WE WOULD THEN STORE IN THIS UH NO 
THAT I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BECAUSE I DIDN'T DOWNLOAD LIKE THERE'S THIS ONE META INFORMATION FILE WHERE IT DESCRIBES THE STRUCTURE OF ALL THE FILES AND DESCRIBES WHICH UM WHICH ATTRIBUTES THEY BRING IN 
SO WE WOULD ADD THAT IT THAT FILE 
SAYING THAT SORT OF WE BRING AN INFORMATION DENSITY 
AND THEN WE WOULD CREATE THE FEEL OF THAT TYPE WHICH WE PROBABLY COULDN'T CALL IT SEGMENT 
I'M NOT SURE 
WE PROBABLY MIGHT HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT WORD FOR IT 
I'M NOT SURE IF IT THERE'S ANY TROUBLE WITH IT REPEATING 
IN THE EXISTING SEGMENTS FILE 
YEAH I RECKON ACTUALLY IF WE MAKE A COPY OF IT 
WHAT UH WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ABOUT THE W I TH DOESN'T THE LAZY LOADING APPLY TO EVERYTHING 
I MEAN THAT IT SORT OF DYNAMICALLY LOADS 
YOU THINK IT I IT L IT LOADS THE WHOLE OF THE SEGMENTS FILE EVERY TIME 
OKAY 
THE SEGMENT AT THE MOMENT IS SPLIT UP OVER 
HMM 
NO BUT I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO REALLY LIKE DISCUSS THAT IN DETAIL 
BECAUSE WE DON'T AT ALL UNDERSTAND AT THE MOMENT HOW THE INTERNAL DATA STRUCTURE LIKE HOW THE LOADING WORKS 
SO MAYBE IF WE GO IF WE GO AHEAD 
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO IN LIKE SOMETHING LIKE SEGMENTS OR MAYBE JUST A COPY OF SEGMENT WHICH HAS AN ATTRIBUTE FOR FOR EACH SEGMENT 
UM BUT IT IS LIKE WITH A WITH A VALUE WITH A DENSITY VALUE 
WOULD TO BE EASIER THOUGH BECAUSE ALL YOUR METHODS ARE SORT OF NOT WORKING WITH THEIR WHOLE TIME FRAME STRUCTURE THERE 
SO WOULD TO BE EASY FOR YOU TO TO TO THE THINGS TOGETHER 
LIKE IF YOU'RE DOING IT IN IN THE WORD BASIS HERE WITH THOSE WORDS THAT IN THE AND YOU THEN IT IT BACK IN INTO THE RIGHT SEGMENT HERE 
I MEAN 
YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO DO A BIT OF 
HMM 
YOU'RE DOING IT TIME BASED AT THE MOMENT 
SO THIS ISN'T DIRECTLY HAVING TIME REFERENCES BUT YOU CAN GET THE UH IT IS ACTUALLY HERE 
OKAY 
SO IF YOU SLICE IT UP BY TIME YOU'D PROBABLY BE ABLE TO JUST LIKE ATTACH LIKE JUST SOME ATTRIBUTE OF 
INFO VAL JUST F TO EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
UM I DON'T UNDERSTAND ENOUGH OF WHAT THEIR DATA STRUCTURE IS 
THIS PROBABLY WOULD BE A LOT EASIER WOULD I REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE HANDLING THE DATA INTERNALLY 'CAUSE THEN WE C THEN I COULD SAY UH 
IT'S EASY TO JUST TO IT IN IF YOU JUST HAVE TO TIME STAMPED THAT JUST REFERENCE BY WORDS AND STUFF 
BUT IT AT THE MOMENT 
SO YOU WOULD YOU'RE DOING I YOU'RE DOING A WORD BY WORD BASE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
BUT EVERY WORD DOES DOES THE WORD PICKING LIKE DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION VALUE IN YOUR THING I DOES IT DEPEND ON ITS POSITION LIKE 
TO BE D DEPENDS ON THE POSITION 
HMM 
AND YOU'RE DOING THIS VIA SOME SOFTWARE THAT'S LIKE EXTERNAL SOFTWARE SO YOU CAN'T 
SO WHAT IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU GET THE RESULTS FROM THAT SOFTWARE AND YOU GO BACK OVER IT THEN WITH THAT FILE SORT OF 
YOU WRITE AN ALGORITHM WHICH WHICH THEN GOES BACK BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT ORDER STILL AND STUFF RIGHT 
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM 
UH ABOUT THIS IS BY SPEAKER HERE WHICH MAKES IT SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT ACTUALLY NITE X. M. L. PROBABLY PROVIDES A LOT OF THE TOOLS THAT WE'D NEED TO DO THAT 
IN IN A TEMPORAL SEQUENCE 
BUT BUT WOULD THE INFORMATION DENSITY ALGORITHM STILL MAKE ANY SENSE IF YOU SPLIT THEM UP 
BECAUSE I MEAN THE WHOLE I THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING IS THAT YOU LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY OF A WORD IN THAT SPECIFIC HOW OFTEN A WORD INC OCCURS IN A CERTAIN TOPIC VERSUS HOW OFTEN IT OCCURS OVER THE WHOLE CORPUS AND THAT FROM THAT IT CALCULATES 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I HAVE A GUT FEELING IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO SPLIT IT 
YEAH 
NO BUT I MEAN IT CAN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT 
IF YOU IF YOU ALREADY HAVE YOU HAVE ON THE RIGHT ORDER ALL THE WORDS WITH A WITH A SCORE TO THEM 
AND YOU HAVE A FILE WHICH HAS EACH WORD AND A TIME STAMP 
SO THESE TWO TIED TOGETHER HAVE EACH WORD AND ITS TIME AND 
AND AND AND ITS PROBA AND ITS VALUE 
YEAH 
SO THEY'RE THEY'RE AT THE MOMENT SO 
IT APPEARS TO ME THAT RAINBOW WAS MADE FOR SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT 
HMM 
I ACTUALLY LIKE UM UM I ARE YOU ACTUALLY SURE THAT RAINBOW IS DOING A MEASURE LIKE IS RETURNING A MEASURE OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO MEASURE 
'CAUSE IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S JUST IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT NO NO IDEA MANY ASPECTS 
MM-HMM 
AND WE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT WHERE DO YOU HAVE THE ORIGINAL CATEGORY INFORMATION FROM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WHERE DO YOU WHERE DO YOU HAVE THEM FROM AT THE MOMENT THE SPLIT UP 
NO I IN THE IT IN THE TOPICS IN THE ON THE HUMAN TOPIC SO UM SO YOU'VE SPLIT THEM UP BY TOPIC AT THE MOMENT 
YEAH BUT 
OKAY OKAY OKAY 
'CAUSE I WAS JUST THINKING THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL BUT YEAH IF YOU IF THAT'S JUST WHILE YOU'RE WAITING 
OKAY 
HAVE YOU EVER LIKE LOOKED INTO DIFFERENT WAYS OF CALCULATING 'CAUSE I WAS JUST THINKING LIKE I MEAN THE FOR EXAMPLE THE THE INFOR UM WHAT'S IT CALLED 
THE ENTROPY CALCULATION IS THAT SHE BOXED IT UNDER THE SIMPLE CALCULATION THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY WRITE THE SCRIPT IN IN TIME AT ALL AND 
YEAH BUT I'M ALSO JUST LIKE I THINK THAT PROBABLY THE ENTROPY VALUE AT THE MOMENT FOR A WORD IS CLOSER TO WHAT WE'RE AT THE MOMENT LOOKING FOR 
I CAN JUST LIKE K K I CAN SIT TOGETHER WITH YOU FOR TWENTY MINUTES AND JUST SHOW YOU THE ENTROPY CODE THAT I WROTE FOR MY OTHER PROJECT AND IT PROBABLY AND WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S WE USED TO WE HAVE TO WE'D USE THE SAME MATRIX AS I'M USING IN MY LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS 
YOU'D USE TO CALCULATE ENTROPY SCORES 
AND THEN WE'D HAVE UM A SCORE WHICH ACTUALLY WHICH WOULD BE THE SAME FOR THE WORD IN EACH POSITION 
SO ON THAT SENSE IT'S DOING SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT 
AND LIKE WE BASICALLY THE SCORE THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS A CONDITIONAL ENTROPY SCORE WHICH JUST CHECKS HOW MUCH INFORMATION 
THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONE WORD TELLS YOU ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT WORD 
BUT THAT'S A RELATIVELY GOOD MEASURE OF WHETHER THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC WORD 
IN WHICH CASE THEY ARE USUALLY WORDS WHICH TELL YOU QUITE A LOT OR A VERY GENERAL WORD WHICH USUALLY DOESN'T TELL YOU QUITE A LOT 
UM IT IT'S BASICALLY THE IT'S THE STANDARD ENTROPY FORMULA 
AND YOU SORT OF YOU YOU 
YES YES IT HAS 
I MEAN 
I THINK THE OFFICIAL LE SORT OF THE OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IT TELLS YOU USE UM HOW MUCH THAT LIKE THE FACT THAT A GIVEN WORD OCCURS TELLS YOU ABOUT WHAT'S THE NEXT WORD'S GONNA BE 
WHICH DOESN'T SOUND TOO EXCITING 
BUT IT IT JUST WORKS IT IN THE WAY THAT WORDS WHICH ARE PROMISCUOUS AND WHICH OCCUR WITH EVERYTHING ALL OVER THE PLACE HAVE VERY LOW A SCORES IN THAT 
AND ALSO USUALLY END UP BEING THE WORDS WHICH ARE UP 
LEAST LIKE EXPRESSIVE AND L CONTAIN LESS INFORMATION 
YEAH FUNCTION WORDS ARE JUST VERY GENERAL NOUNS 
PRO PROBABLY LIKE WHAT WHATEV FOR EXAMPLE THE WORD COMPUTER IN THAT CONTEXT 
YOU COULD IMAGINE IT OUT OF LIKE BE IN ALL IN ALL THE CONTEXTS 
YEAH SO WE WOULD WE WE WOULDN'T DO IT BY WORD WE WOULD SORRY OKAY 
UM I WAS I WAS GETTING THAT WE ACTUALLY SORRY I WAS GETTING THAT WRONG I WAS GETTING IT FROM WHAT I DID MY PROJECT 
NOW ON THIS CASE WE WOULD DO IT BY PER MEE WORDS PER MEETING 
SO 
HMM 
YES IT IT'S PROBABLY DOING IT'S PROBABLY DOING QUITE THE SAME THING IN THE END 
BUT I'M JUST SAYING LIKE WITH THAT THING YOU WOULD EASILY HAVE AN ALGORITHM WHICH AT THE MOMENT PROVIDES YOU FOR EACH WORD WITH A SCORE WHICH WE CAN SEE 
UM IN UM I WAS I WAS I WAS DESCRIBING THE WRONG THING 
NO THIS CASE WE WOULDN'T BE DOING HOW MUCH IT TELLS YOU ABOUT ANOTHER WORD 
NO THIS CASE WE WOULD BE DOING GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW A WORD HOW GOOD IS IT AT PREDICTING FROM WHICH UM SPECIFIC TOPIC THAT WAS 
SO THAT WOULD YEAH IN THAT SENSE IT'S THE SAME THING HERE 
YEAH YEAH FOR A SPECIFIC 
YEAH 
THE SAME WORD THE WORD YESTERDAY WOULD BE WOULD HAVE THE SAME SCORE ALL OVER THE PLACE 
OKAY 
I C 
BUT BUT YOUR CATEGORY THING DEPENDS ON THAT WE NOT JUST HAVE TOPIC SEGMENTS BUT ALSO THAT THIS TOPIC SEGMENTS WE HAVE THEM IN CATEGORIES 
YOU YOU DO WOULDN'T YOU NEED SEVERAL DOCUMENTS FOR EACH CATEGORY 
ARE SEVERAL SEGMENTS FOR EACH CATEGORY 
DO BUT WELL IT WORD WITHOUT THAT AT ALL 
'CAUSE 
YEAH I MEAN IS IS IN OUR CASE BASICALLY EVERY 
EVERY S TOPIC WOULD BE ITS OWN CATEGORY 
AND THE QUESTION IS DOES THE ALGORITHM STILL MAKE ANY SENSE IN THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ALGORITHM ENOUGH FOR THAT 
BUT WHAT I'M REALLY LIKE BECAUSE THE ENTROPICAL UM CALCULATION IS IS SIMPLE MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK INTO MAKING THAT SCORE JUST AS A PRELIMINARY SCORE THAT WE HAVE 
LIKE IT IT'S A VERY IT GIVES YOU LIKE I'VE LOOKED AT THE RESULT 
IT GIVES YOU BASICALLY SOMETHING ON THE END WHICH VAGUELY TELLS YOU JUST WHETHER A WORD IS A VERY SPECIFIC WORD 
OR A VERY GENERAL WORD 
AND 
I LIKE THERE IS SOME HOPE THAT PROBABLY HAVING JUST SENTENCES WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF VERY SPECIFIC WORDS 
IF YOU MARK THEM AS BEING MORE INTERESTING THAN THE WORDS WHICH ARE ONLY VERY GENERAL WORDS THAT THEY WOULD GET US SOMEWHERE 
PROBABLY ONE POINT ZERO IS VERY HIGH INFORMATION VALUE 
YEAH 'CAUSE THIS WOULD 
YEAH IN IN A SENSE I MEAN THIS IS A BIT LIKE THE WHITE LIKE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY OVER TOTAL FREQUENCY 
MEASURE IT SORT OF JUST GOING BY 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN EVERY SEQUENCE OF THE SAME 
MM-HMM 
WITHIN THE WITHIN THE TOPIC IS LIKE TOPIC WE HAD TO WHEN YOU SAY TOPIC 
YOU MEAN LIKE JUST LIKE FROM FROM A BEGINNING TO END POINT LIKE WITHIN ONE MEETING THERE ARE SEVERAL TOPICS 
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION ANYWHERE DO WE 
BUT BUT YOU YOU ARE SEGMENTING 
WELL I'M I'M DOING IN ONE SEGMENT SIMILARITY IN THE END YEAH 
I'M DOING LIKE FINDING SIMILAR SEGMENTS BASIC LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS 
BUT 
BUT LIKE F FOR NOW LIKE YOUR SEGMENTATION IS JUST SPLITTING A MEETING UP INTO DIFFERENT BLOCKS VER 
NOT NOT FROM WHAT COLIN IS DOING FROM WHAT I NO 
IT'S ONLY LIKE I'M WRITING AN ALGORITHM THAT WHICH THEN TRIES TO LOSE AGAIN BASED ON WORD P OCCURRENCE PATTERNS TRY TO LINK TOGETHER MAYBE DIFFERENT ONES OF THIS 
SO 
SO THAT YEAH 
YEAH I'M ALSO A BIT B LIKE I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE ABOUT RAINBOW BEING THE RIGHT THING 
'CAUSE IT SEEMS THAT RAINBOW DOES IN ITS STRUCTURE QUITE RELY ON HAVING DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF THE SAME CATEGORY SORT OF IN IN A WAY 
'KAY 
YOU KNOW WHAT IS A BYPRODUCT OF MY L. S. A. I'LL PROVIDE UM A VOCABULARY LIKE SORT OF A DICTIONARY WHICH FOR EACH WORD GIVES AN ENTROPY SCORE ENTROPY SCORE 
WHICH JUST TELLS YOU OF HOW MUCH INFORMATION THE PRESENCE OF A WORD TELLS YOU ABOUT WHICH TOPIC IT IS 
NOT WHICH CATEGORY LIKE I'M NOT I'M NOT LUMPING TOGETHER SEPARATE TOPIC SEGMENTS INTO CATEGORIES 
BUT JUST LIKE HOW MUCH THIS WORD TELLS YOU BUT WHA HOW LIKELY THAT WE THE OCCURRENCE OF THAT WORD MAKES IT THAT IT'S A SPECIFIC SEGMENT TOPIC SEGMENT 
WHICH IS SOME MEASURE ALREADY OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS WORD IS VERSUS HOW SPECIFIC IF IT A CERTAIN SEGMENT THAT IS 
AND I'LL JUST PROVIDE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST NOT MUCH MORE WORK THEN JUST THE USUAL THING 
AND THEN WE CAN SEE HOW WE CAN IT THAT ONE WITH THE OTHER STUFF 
SO IF YOU UM KEEP IN WORKING ON RAINBOW MEANWHILE AND TRY TO FIND A WAY HOW TO TO YOUR RAINBOW STUFF INTO 
SOME WAY THAT WE CAN ATTACH TO TO A CERTAIN TIME SEGMENT 
I'M JUST THINKING WH IF 
IT IT SAID SO EACH WORD COMPLETELY UNIQUE LIKE SORT OF DOES IT TREAT EACH WORD EACH OCCURRENCE OF WORD IS A COMPLETELY UNIQUE EVENT 
OR DOES IT I MEAN IN IT IT HAS TO I MEAN BASICALLY THE THE FORM OF THE WORD IS IMPORTANT RIGHT 
WE CAN'T JUST REPLACE THE WORD BY AN ARBITRARY STRING 
BECAUSE IT LOOKS OF THE SAME WORD OCCURS AGAIN AND STUFF 
YEAH IT IT HAS TO WORK WITH A UM YEAH WELL I THINK IT'S A STUPID QUESTION 
LIKE IT IT IT HAS TO WORK ON ON ON THE WORD LIKE ONE 
WHAT I WAS THINKING IS WHETHER IF WE REPLACE THE WORD BY SOMETHING UNIQUELY ID IDENTIFIABLE THEN IT WOULDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENT WHICH ORDER TO USE 
BUT THAT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT NEEDS THE WORD BECAUSE THAT'S ALL IT'S WORKING ON 
IT'S THE WORD AND THAT LOOKS OF THAT WORD OCCURS AGAIN AND VERSUS HOW OFTEN THAT WORD OCCURS IN OTHER CONTEXT RIGHT 
SO WE CAN'T ATTACH SOME TYPE OF INFORMATION TO THE WORD JUST TO THE WORD STRING ITSELF 
LIKE MAKING AN UNDERSCORE MAKING THE TIME OR SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T WORK 
BUT WOULD TO HAVE THAT IN THE UNTRUNCATED VERSION THEN LIKE WOULD IT IS WOULD THE OUTPUT BE THE UNTRUNCATED VERSION 
IT WILL PROBABLY UM NO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD 
YEAH FOR NOW I MEAN REALLY JUST LIKE 
YEAH I THINK IF WE WORK TOGETHER IN IN IN AN ENTROPY BASED SCORE 
IT'S LET ME SEE IF I CAN DEMONSTRATE 
IT I MEAN LET'S JUST KEEP IN TALKING MEANWHILE AND I'LL TRY TO START THAT UP 
IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY DO IT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING ABOUT IT IT BASICALLY JUST 
DOES SOMETHING WHICH TELLS YOU HOW SPECIFIC A WORD IS 
IN A SENSE IT'S IN A IT'S IT'S BASICALLY JUST TO TO A HIGH DEGREE REALLY TELLING YOU HOW ARE HOW RARE A WORD IS OR HOW COMMON A WORD IS 
BUT UH IS IS THE FIRST STEP THAT'S PROBABLY FOR FOR A PROTOTYPE FOR NEXT WEEK THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A BAD THING I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S JUST THAT 
EVEN IF YOU JUST LIKE IF YOU HAVE SEGMENTS WHERE WHERE LOTS OF RARE WORDS OCCUR HIGHLIGHTED IN DARKER RED THAN SEGMENTS WHERE ALL THE VERY COMMON WORDS OCCUR 
THAT'S JUST THAT'S SOMEWHERE TO START FROM 
AND IT'S IT'S A BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THAT BUT THEN DE FACTO IT JUST ENDS UP DOING THAT MOSTLY FROM WHAT I FIGURED OUT 
UM 
ACTUALLY I THINK I'M NOT GONNA NOT GONNA START THAT NOW BECAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA TAKE TOO LONG 
SO 
IF WE GET IT IN A WORD BY WORD BASIS WHATEVER YOU DO IT'LL PROBABLY APPEAR IN A WORD BY WORD BASIS 
AND WHAT YOU HAVE IN A SORT OF SEGMENT BUT NOT QUITE SEGMENT BASE 
'KAY WHAT ABOUT THE FOLLOWING MODEL 
I MEAN THIS IS A VERY UNSCIENTIFIC WAY OF DOING IT IN SOME SENSE 
BUT WHAT IF WE IF WE TAKE TIME IS THE STANDARD UNIT FOR NOW AND SORT OF LIKE MAKE A MASSIVE ONE SEGMENT SPLIT SUPER ARRAY 
BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING CAN NO NO WAY OR THE OTHER BE TI TIED DOWN TO ACTUAL TIME 
SO IF WE IF WE F FOR F FOR EACH ONE SEGMENT TIME SLOT WE COULD ATTACH A VALUE 
AND THEN IT WOULD BE EASY TO THEN GO BACK WHEN IF WE HAVE THE TIME MARKS HERE 
AND RE MAP THAT INTO INTO THE LENGTH OF A SEGMENT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
SO IF YOU HAVE FOR EACH WORD SAY AND WE KNOW THAT WORD STARTS AT THIS SEGMENT AND NEEDS TO THAT SEGMENT 
AND YOU HAVE FOR LIKE FOR SOME TIME PERIOD W THE OVERLAP AND THAT PERIOD ON THE F. ONES AND THAT PERIOD OR SOMETHING 
SO YOU ALSO HAVE A VALUE WHICH CAN BE TIED DOWN TO A TIME 
AND THEN WE COULD JUST ONE UM IN MATLAB OR IN SOMETHING JUST CREATE SOME MASSIVE SUPER ARRAY OF 
OF THINGS FOR EACH FOR EACH LIKE SORT OF TIME SAMPLING SLOT AND AND CALCULATE A VALUE FOR THIS AND ONCE WE HAVE THIS ARRAY 
WE CAN GO WITH THE SCRIPT AND SORT OF GO FOR EACH SEGMENT AT THE STARTING AND END TIMES AND SAY OKAY 
THIS IS FROM OUR TIME SEGMENT OF HERE AT THIS TIME SEGMENT THERE 
SO WE TAKE THE SAME OF THIS AND DIVIDE THEM BY BY THE NUMBER OR SOMETHING CREATE THE AVERAGE AND PUT IT ONE IS THE VALUE FOR THE SEGMENT 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
OH 
TH THAT'S THAT'S A FIDDLING PLAY ON THE END BUT THAT PROBLEM WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE 
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A USEFUL WAY OF AUTOMATICALLY EVALUATING UM 
WE DON'T HAVE A WAY OF USEFULLY EVALUATING AUTOMATICALLY WHAT'S GOOD AND WHAT'S BAD 
SO IT'S IT'S PROBABLY ALWAYS GONNA BE A QUESTION OF LOOKING AT IT AND SAYING OKAY 
LIKE RUNNING OUT WITH DIFFERENT DIFFERENT FACTOR LOADINGS AND SEEING OKAY THIS WAY IT WORKS THIS WILL AND THIS WAY IT WORKS THAT WELL 
BUT IT PROBABLY BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR MAPPED T TO MAP FOR YOU TO MAP IT IN AS FAR YOU SORT OF I 
YEAH BUT AS YOU SAY THAT INST LIKE YOU BASICALLY SAY WE HAVING AN ARRAY WHERE EACH EACH CELL IS IS IN LIKE IS O IS ONE WORD 
AND THEN YOU WOULD MAP YOUR INFORMATION ONTO INDIVIDUAL WORDS 
HMM 
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHICH WORD THAT IS AND 
'KAY 
AND AND THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE SOME TYPE OF JUST POINT IN THE END WHERE THE ONE SCORES FROM THE ALL THE INDIVIDUAL WORD CELLS GET MULTIPLIED ALL WITH LIKE FOR EACH UTTERANCE OR WHATEVER 
YOU HAVE GOT ALL MULTIPLIED WITH THE SAME VALUE ALL THE ONES THAT ARE WITHIN THAT UTTERANCE 
THAT'S SORT OF THE COMBINATION OF OF THE TWO SCORES 
AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO GO BACK AGAIN AND THEN PUT THAT BACK INTO THAT SEGMENT MODE HERE 
SO THAT WE BECAUSE IN THE END WE DON'T WANT IT IN A PER WORD BASIS BUT PROBABLY IN A PER SEGMENT BASE 
OH YEAH YEAH ACTUALLY THAT YEAH THAT'S TRUE IS THAT IT'S EASIER IF YOU 
ARE ABLE TO YEAH WELL I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BACK WHERE WE STARTED AT THIS 
BUT YOU SAID IT W BUT YOU SAID IT'S MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOUR SEGMENTS AREN'T THOSE SEGMENTS EXACTLY 
HMM 
AND THEIR SEGMENTS DO OVERLAP 
UH TH TH THIS IDEA ARE THOSE DON'T 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO YOU COULD ON THEIR GRANULARITY YOU COULD ON THEIR GRANULARITY CREATE A SCORE LIKE FOR EACH FOR EACH OF THEIR SEGMENTS 
WELL I GUESS I MEAN FOR YOU IF YOU KNOW FOR EACH WORD IF YOU FIND THAT IT THEN IT HAS TO BE POSSIBLE 
BECAUSE IF WE KNOW SORT OF THIS IS GOING FROM WORD TO WORD OR AT THIS IS GOING FROM TIME TO TIME AND THEN THERE HAS TO BE A WAY THEN FOR YOU SAY OKAY 
THIS CONCERNS THESE FOLLOWING WORDS AND THEN JUST MAKE MAKE A SIMPLE MENU OVER THEM 
I THINK AN INTERESTING THING IS IF WE DON'T COMBINE YOUR TWO SCORES IN THE 
IN THE X. M. L. FILE YOU HAD BUT IF WE DO THAT IN THE SOFTWARE 
THEN WE CAN PROBABLY MAKE WAYS OF PLAYING WITH IT IN THE SOFTWARE AND SORT OF L YOU KNOW LIKE ADAPTING SOME SORT OF CONTROL 
LIKE PLAYING AROUND WITH LIKE LIKE IT'S PLAYING WITH DIFFERENT WEIGHTINGS FOR THAT THE UTTERANCE BASED ON VERSUS THE WORD BASED ON AND SORT OF LIKE IT IT DYNAMICALLY 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
LIKE PLAYING AROUND SORT OF FIGURING OUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY OF COMBINING THEM BY PLAYING AROUND AND LOOKING AT THE RESULTS 
YEAH 
YEAH WE COULD PROBABLY LIKE MAKE A UH UM GRAPHIC DISPLAY INITIALLY AT LEAST FOR OUR EXPERIMENTING 
WE'D JUST PLACE THEM IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEN IS HOW THEY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SO DO YOU THINK YOU LOOK BOTH OF YOU THEN CAN MAP SOMETHING INTO THEIR SEGMENTS LIKE JUST EACH OF YOU PROVIDE ONE VALUE 
LIKE DOUBLE VALUE OR WHATEVER LIKE ONE DECIMAL VALUE OR WHATEVER NOT NOT EXACTLY THEIR SEGMENTS 
IT'S STATED BOTH IN 
IT'S DONE BOTH IN TERMS OF WORDS AND IN TERMS OF SEGMENTS 
IT'S A BIT SAD SORT OF THAT WE DO THIS BEFORE WE'VE TRULY FIGURED OUT HOW THE NITE X. M. L. THING WORKS 
BECAUSE NOW WE'RE DOING IT ALL BY HAND AND LIKE PARSING AND UN PARSING THAT THING AND IT'S IT'S ALL PART OF THE FRAMEWORK 
OH 
HOW MUCH EASIER WOULD TO BE IF WE TRULY UNDERSTOOD THIS 
SO 
'KAY 
I MIGHT JUST CHANGE MY ORDER OF IN WHICH I DO THINGS AND LIKE FORGET MY LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS STUFF UNTIL THE WEEKEND AND TRY TO REALLY MAKE SENSE OF THE 
OF THE NITE DATA SYSTEM NOW IS THAT MAYBE AS SOON AS I'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT WE FIND WAYS OF DOING THAT IN WITHIN THE NITE FRAMEWORK ALREADY 
SO THAT WE DON'T MANUALLY HAVE TO PARSE TIMES AND ENTIRE THINGS TOGETHER 
WELL 
AT THE MOMENT WHAT YOU WOULD DO LIKE TO TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS YOU WOULD SORT OF LIKE WRITE SOME PERL SCRIPT OR SOMETHING THAT GETS THIS TIME VALUE OUT OF HERE AND 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO PROVIDED THAT YOU GET YOUR WORDS IN THE RIGHT ORDER 
DO YOU THINK IT IS AN EASY TASK FOR YOU TO IT IT'S A F RELATIVELY FEASIBLE TASK FOR YOU TO TO GET JUST A SINGLE VALUE PER SEGMENT 
OKAY 
AND YOU SAY YOU THINK YOU'RE ABLE AS WELL TO MAP ONTO THOSE SEGMENTS 
AND IF YOU'RE BOTH ABLE TO MAP ONTO THOSE SEGMENTS THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ONE FILE WHERE WE HAVE LIKE WHATEVER TWO VALUES 
VALUE A. AND VALUE B. BOTH AS ATTRIBUTES FOR 
FOR THIS 
AND THAT WE COULD LOAD INTO A PROTOTYPE AND SO WHAT TYPES OF DISP WHAT WAYS OF DISPLAYING THIS INFORMATION OR THREE 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
THERE'S PROBABLY ALSO SOCIAL INTERACTION FACTORS IN THAT THERE'S SOMETIMES JUST A MEETING LIKE IF PEOPLE ADAPT THEIR F. ZERO TO EACH OTHER THAN THEY'RE SOMETIMES P 
YEAH 
CAN YOU NOT DO SOMETHING LIKE JUST LIKE NOT MEASURING THE F. ZERO OR THE AMPLITUDE AT ALL 
BUT JUST LIKE THE VARIANCE OF F. ZERO WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME FRAME AND LIKE SORT OF LIKE JUST HAVE SOME PART FOR ITS VERY LOW VARIANCE WITH MORE THE SAME F. ZERO AND ONE WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF MORE VARIANCE 
I DON'T WELL ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT AT ALL 
YEAH 
SORRY 
MM 
HMM 
OKAY 
SO AT THE MOMENT YOU YOU JUST YOU MEASURING THE F. ZEROS RELATIVE TO THE AVERAGE FOR THE SPEAKER OR 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OR IS THE AVERAGE 
OKAY 
UM SO WHAT YOU WOULD BE FEEDING IN WOULD BE JUST LIKE ONE VALUE PER SPEAKER PER MEETING 
SO THAT OKA THAT THAT'S THAT'S YOUR AVERAGE BASELINE OKAY OKAY 
NO YEAH THAT THAT MAKES M YEAH THAT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE YEAH 
SO THAT WOULD SHOW YOU HOW MUCH RELATIVE TO HOW UH SORT OF HOW HE'S PERFORMING GENERALLY IN THAT MEETING RELATIVE TO THAT HOW HE'S IN A SPECIFIC SEGMENT 
UH OR SH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND FOR YOU THAT WOULD BE QUITE EASY TO TRANSLATE INTO THOSE SEGMENTS 
YEAH GUESS I'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION FIFTEEN TIMES NOW 
SORRY 
OH 
HMM 
UH THEY W THEY DO EXIST 
THE CASTRATI CORPS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER SCIENCE INSTITUTE 
UH WELL 
I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO GO SOON 
BUT NOT QUITE SURE I MEAN IS THERE ANYTHING MORE WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ANYWAY 
YEAH 
SO AS SOON AS AS SOON AS I'M HALFWAY THROUGH MY L. S. A. LIKE BASICALLY AS SOON AS I HAVE THE THE MATRIX BUILT 
IF IF THE DOCUMENT BY WORD STUFF IT'S VERY EASY TO THEN CALCULATE FOR EACH WORD A SCORE 
AND I CAN JUST GIVE YOU THOSE SCORES AND YOU CAN DO WITH THEM WHATEVER YOU WANT 
YEAH I THINK COLIN DAVE AND UM WELL ACTUALLY WORK ON ON THE JAVA STUFF 
AND IT AND WE'LL JUST SO WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOU SUPPLY US WE'LL TRY TO IT ON AND VISUALISE IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER 
UM I'LL ASK JONATHAN IF WE CAN POSTPONE THE MEETING AT ONE O'CLOCK 
SO THAT WOULD GIVE US A CHANCE OF MEETING IN FOR AN HOUR BEFORE THAT TO DISCUSS THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD 
YEAH I HAVEN'T GOTTEN LIKE SORT OF MY CONFIRMATION THAT W WEDNESDAY IS FINE 
I'M NOT SURE IF I'M SUPPOSED TO EXPECT A CONFIRMATION FOR MY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM NOW OR BUT I'LL JUST EMAIL HIM AGAIN AND SO ASK HIM IF WE CAN MAYBE MAKE IT ON SORRY 
WE SAID TWELVE AND I'M ASKING IF HE CAN MAKE ONE 
THIS IS A BIT FRUSTRATING AT THE MOMENT THIS PROJECT ISN'T IT 
IT'S SO LIKE DIFFICULT TO TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU UNDERSTAND ENOUGH TO REALLY FEEL THAT 
I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT FEELING THAT I'M REALLY WORKING AT THE MOMENT I'M MORE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF EVERYTHING 
AND IT'S A BIT TOO FAR INTO THE MEETING FOR THAT AND NOT THE PROJECT FOR THAT 
HMM 
I GUESS AS SOON AS WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK IN THE W IN THE TYPE OF THE PROTOTYPE WHERE LIKE SORT OF EACH OF US CAN IT IN THEIR STUFF AND SO WHAT IT L HOW HOW IT LOOKS LIKE AND HOW IT PERFORMS 
YOU KNOW 
THAT PROBABLY MAKES IT A LOT EASIER THAN BUT IT'S SORT OF IT'S A BOOT STRAPPING PROBLEM LIKE FOR THE PROTOTYPE WE NEED SOME TYPE OF DATA 
BUT TO DEVELOP THE DATA IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER TO TO HAVE THE PROTOTYPE 
ANYWAY I GOTTA GO 
HMM 
YES BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S IN A FORM WHICH IS EASY TO READ IN AT THE MOMENT THAT WOULD BE FINE 
SORT OF LIKE IF BASICALLY IF WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THOSE SEGMENTS FILE BUT FOR EACH OF YOU LIKE JUST HAVE AN ATTRIBUTE 
I THINK IT'S REALLY EASY IF WE DON'T MERGE THEM BEFORE HAND BUT IF WE LET THEM IF WE COMBINE THEM IN THE PROTOTYPE OR DON'T AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE THEN WE CAN EASILY D DISPLAY THEM INDIVIDUALLY C CONTRAST THEM TO EACH OTHER AND PLAY AROUND WITH HOW YOU TO COMBINE THEM 
EXACTLY YEAH 
YEAH 
AND I MEAN COMPUTATIONALLY MULTIPLYING TWO INTEGERS OR DOUBLES OR WHATEVER SHOULDN'T BE THE THING THAT SLOWS US DOWN 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
HOW YOU HOW DO YOU DO THE SUMMARY 
SO IT 
SO ARE YOU BASING IT IN CERTAIN THRESHOLDS UH OVER A SPECIAL D UH SO OKAY 
OH THAT'S THE OLD OLD ONE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM 
SO YOU WANT TO SEND STEVE THE PROTOTYPE AND WE SHOULD CHANGE DATA 
WHERE'S THE BEST BEST PLACE TO PUT IT 
OH 
DO YOU UM TAKE IT FROM FROM MY DIRECTORY 
OR DO I HAVE TO PUT IN IN THE SH 
YEAH BUT WOULD YOU TAKE IT FROM FROM MY DIRECTORY 
OR OKAY 
MAYBE THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
MAYBE THEY HAVE GOT UM THE MENUS ON THE CODE AS WELL AND THEN SOMETHING IN IS MESSED UP 
UH-HUH 
AND THE RE COULD BE SMALLER 
YEAH AS SOON AS I'VE FINISHED ALL THE MEETINGS I THINK THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH TO DO UNLESS I GOT SOME EVALUATION METHOD 
BUT THAT COULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT 
I WOULD HAVE TO TAG UH SOME PART OF IT OR SOMETHING 
BECAUSE IF I D IF I CAN'T EVALUATE I CAN'T DO ANY BETTER 
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO BETTER IF I DON'T EVALUATE ANYTHING 
YEAH 
YEAH HE'S REALLY KEEN ON THAT ISN'T UH 
MM 
I DON'T KNOW 
TEN PERCENT EACH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO BUT IT'S 
UM 
YEAH 
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THAT ONE YEAH IT MIGHT BE OF HELP 
YEAH 
IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL THOUGH I THINK 
HMM 
OH YEAH F PER UTTERAN UH I PRINT THE UTTERANCES IN THE I. D. 
UH IN THE THE I. D. OF THE UTTERANCE AND UH THE MEASURE I THINK 
THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE 
IF I JUST TAKE WELL UM A FILE OR WHERE ONE MEETING IS ONE OR 
CONCATENATE ALL THOSE SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD 
HAVE YOU CURRENTLY GOT CONTINUOUS I. D. S FOR YOUR TOPIC SEGMENTS 
OH OKAY I THOUGHT YOU HAD DONE ALL OF THEM AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO THAT WHAT V WHAT YOU'VE GOT BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THE DIFFERENT MEETING SERIES OVERLAP 
I THINK 
I DON'T KNOW 
MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO THE USER THOUGH JUST THE WORD IMPORTANCE MAYBE 
BUT WE HAVE GOT THE INDEX UM FOR CONVERTING FROM VERA'S I. D. IS IT TO YOURS 
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM SHOULD IT 
YEAH I'VE DONE THAT FOR THE CORRELATION AS WELL 
SO THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS QUITE EASY TO DO 
HAVE YOU GET THAT FOR ONE IT'S JUST FOR ONE MEETING AT THE MOMENT 
OH OKAY SURE 
SO WHAT KIND OF CHANGE WELL YOU IMPOSE ON THE SUMMARISATION 
BECAUSE IF WE FINE TUNE UH UM ACCORDING TO THAT AND IT'S NOT FINISHED IT'S N DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
SO YOU TO THE MOMENT YOU HAVE GOT A THRESHOLD AND EVERYTHING THAT'S ABOVE IT IS DISPLAYED 
OR HOW DO YOU DO 
YEAH SO IT'S SOME KIND OF THRESHOLD THAT IS SET OKAY 
OH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO UH WHICH VERSION OF MY DATA WAS THAT THE VERY FIRST ONE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH V I MEAN REALLY DOESN'T MATTER 
JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF I'M JUST 
YEAH 
YEAH PROBABLY 
PROBABLY ALL THESE UH-HUHS AND UH HMMS ARE SPELLED DIFFERENTLY IN THE THING OR WHAT'S THE PROBLEM 
YOU SHOULD GENERALISE 
UH UH 
THAT'S A VERY OLD ONE RATHER 
I THINK THESE S. S AND A. S AND SO ON THE SINGLE LETTERS ARE BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WITH MY UM FIRST VERSION OF THE TEXT THING 
'CAUSE I THINK THE 
HMM 
YEAH BUT BUT PERHAPS MORE THAN HALF 
OTHERWISE YOU GO ON IT SLOWLY YEAH 
UM OH SORRY THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE FIRST MEETING IS FOR EX THAT THERE'S NO UM A HOT SPOT ANNOTATION FOR THAT 
BUT I MEAN THAT'S NOT NOT A REAL PROBLEM 
UM 
I UH THINK IT MIGHT 
WHY BECAUSE UM I AM STEVE LAY QUITE A LOT OF UM WEIGHT ON UM YOU KNOW UH SURFING THROUGH MEETINGS 
SO WE SHOULD AT LEAST PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF DIFFERENT MEETINGS OF ONE GROUP 
AT THE BEGINNING UH UM TALKED QUITE A LOT ABOUT THAT 
UM AND WHAT ABOUT THE SIMILARITY MEASURE FOR SEGMENTS 
DO WE UM ALSO PRESENT THAT IN THIS WINDOW AND DO WE DO IT ACROSS MEETINGS 
UH I THINK THAT WAS PLANNED AT THE BEGINNING WASN'T IT 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
SO IT WOULDN'T BE DISPLAYED ON ON THE UH GRAPHICAL DISPLAY 
OH 
UM ONE 
I I'M JUST COMING BACK TO OUR INITIAL IDEA OF PRESENTING SOME YOU KNOW 
ALL THE SIMILAR SEGMENTS IN UH ACROSS MEETINGS AND SEPARATING BY UH SOME THINGS LIKE 
MM-HMM 
UH I I HAVE THAT FILE 
SO JUST 
DID YOU OVERTAKE THAT CODE FROM THE ORIGINAL THING 
YEAH BUT ALSO SPEEDING UP THE IDEAS AND SO 
UM WHERE WE HAVE A MOVING BAND THE GRAPHICAL DISPLAY THAT ALSO MOVES ACCORDING TO THE 
YEAH 
UH IF I'M PRETTY SURE THAT I CAN UH ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO IMPROVE THERE 
SO I MEAN IF YOU NEED ME TO WORK ON SOMETHING ELSE UM I CAN TRY TO FINISH MY STUFF UM EARLY 
BUT UM OTHERWISE I CAN STILL KEEP WORKING ON IT IMPROVING IT I THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH TEN PERCENT 
SO SO YOU WANT UM THE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBERS TO BE UM CONTINUOUS THROUGHOUT THE CORPUS IS THAT SECOND MEETINGS BEGINS WITH THREE HUNDRED UM SOMETHING 
COULDN'T WE COULDN'T WE JUST UM TAKE THE UM A NAME EACH UM EACH DIALOGUE ACT UM MEETING DOT UM DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER 
IT WOULD BE A LA LONGER NAME BUT 
A PROBLEM UM YEAH 
FOR EXAMPLE IS THERE ARE NOT UM F. ZERO VALUES FOR EVERY SPEAKER OR IN SOMETIMES NOT FOR EVERY MEETING UM HOW WELL I COUNT THAT UP 
I MEAN 
OH OKAY 
AT THE MOMENT I DON'T EVEN GENERATE ANY DOCUMENT UH DOCUMENT FOR THIS 
BUT BECAUSE I MEAN IT'S NOT ZERO IT'S JUST A NINE 
BUT WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER FOR THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE OF THAT JUST WOULDN'T BE PART OF IT THEN 
THE 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT DO WE REALLY WANT AUDIO DISPLAY THEM SEPARATELY BECAUSE THE USER WON'T OKAY FOR NOW FOR OR IS OKAY 
YEAH BUT THEN THE USER WOULD HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT IS W WAS WHAT AND WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE BLUE STRIPES AND WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE RED ONES 
UH I THINK THAT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD IDEA 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
COULDN'T WE COULDN'T WE WRITE ON PROGRAMME THAT CALCULATES ALL THE UM F FOR ALL ARE DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE THE UM A ABSOLUTE UM DIALOGUE ACT NUMBERS FOR THE MEETING 
BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT WE ALL PRODUCE THE NUMBERS FOR EACH MEETING SEPARATELY 
YEAH BUT WE SHOULD ALL USE THE SAME PROGRAMME I THINK 
WOULD PREVENT US FROM HAVING TOO MUCH MISTAKES IN IT 
OR AT LEAST UH THE MISTAKES WOULD BE CONSISTENT 
NO IT'S NOT REALLY DIFFICULT 
IT'S JUST 
YEAH I MEAN I CAN DO IT 
I CAN READ IN THE DIFFERENT UM IMPORTANCE MEASURES AND THEN RE RE CALCULATE THE NUMBERS 
MM 
OKAY 
DID I TELL YOU THAT WE'VE GOT KIND OF TWO WAY INTERACTION 
IF YOU CONTROL CLICK ON UTTERANCE IT WILL PLAY WHERE IT SHOULD BE IN THE FILE 
WE SHOULD PROBABLY SET THOSE SIZES 'CAUSE THAT'S SUCH AN EASY THING TO DO 
OR YOU MISSING THE SOUND 
OH THERE TO USE 
YEAH 
THAT'S VERA'S DATA ON THE DISPLAY 
BUT THE SEGMENTS ARE JUST MADE UP AREN'T THEY 
YOU CAN ALSO CONTROL CLICK ON THE DIALOGUE ACTS AND IT WILL PLAY THAT SECTION OF THE FILE AS WELL 
YEAH IF YOU WANT 
UH THAT ONE LOOKS ALMOST COM JUST YOU NEED TO 
THE ORIGINAL THE VERY FIRST ONE 
YEAH 
UM IT WILL BE IN PROGRAM 
WHERE DO I CALL YOUR DISPLAY 
NO IT IS IN YOUR DISPLAY 
UM WHERE IT CALLS WHICH ONE TO GET YOU JUST NEED TO CHANGE THE FLAG 
UM I THINK IT MUST BE UNLESS I IT 
OH NO ACTUALLY YEAH YOU CAN CHANGE IT FOR IN THE SUMMARY WHEN THE SUMMARY GETS CALLED IN PROGRAM MANAGER YOU CAN DO IT 
NO NOT YET 
IT'S JUST PICKS THE TOP RANKED ONES AT THE MOMENT 
YEAH THE EASIEST THING IS ONE PROGRAMME MANAGER WHERE IT MAKES THE SUMMARY 
IT'S PROBABLY THE BEST PLACE TO DO IT 
IT'LL BE ABOVE THAT 
IT'LL BE DOWN 
IT'S GONNA BE AFTER THE DATA MANAGER'S MADE 
YEAH THAT 
A NEW SUMMARY 
YEAH TH CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE I PUT IT 
MAYBE IT WILL BE ONE IS THE SUMMARY CONSTRUCTOR THEN 
YEAH TRY THE SUMMARIES CONSTRUCTOR 
WELL IT READS THEM INTO SEPARATE ARRAYS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST CHANGE A FLAG TO SELECT NO I WHICH ONE IT GIVES BACK 
YEAH IF YOU WANT 
UH THAT SHOULD BE FINE 
YEAH I SHOULD MAKE A NEW CONSTRUCTOR THAT LETS YOU SET THE FLAG 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S WEIRD 
NO MENU IT COMPLAINS ABOUT 
OKAY 
I THINK THAT TO BE HONEST IS SOMETHING WE CAN WORRY ABOUT AT THE END 
I MEAN THAT'S QUITE TRIVIAL TO CHANGE AND WE GOT A LOT OF THEIR WORK TO DO 
YEAH WE NEED TO GET IN THAT PRETTY SHORTLY I THINK 
OKAY SO I'LL NEED TO DO SOME CHANGES TO PROGRAM MANAGER TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE UM CHANGING RESULTS 
WHAT KIND OF INDEX 
TAKE AND MAKE THEM IN A HASH MAP OR SOMETHING 
CERTAINLY FOR NOW YEAH 
YEAH 
UM WELL FROM THE POINT OF US DEVELOPING IT IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE 
UM WELL AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST A AN OLD FILE 
IT'D PROBABLY BE YEAH BEST TO MAKE A COPY OF IT 
I'D HAVE THOUGHT 
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO UM THE SPEECH TOOLS THROUGH JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE 'CAUSE THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THEM IS HORRIFIC 
IT'S REALLY BAD 
SO I THINK I'M THINKING I'LL JUST WRITE IT A SCRIPT AND DO IT WITH A SYSTEM CALL 
NOT YET 
YEAH TH I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH WASTING TOO MUCH TIME ON IT 
YEAH 
HMM 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE THAT LONG ANYWAY 
YEAH YEAH 
SO YEAH IT WE JUST START EVERYTHING AFTER THE SUMMARY'S BEEN CREATED 
IT'S NOT A BIG PROBLEM 
YEAH 
UM I DON'T THINK I'LL NEED THAT REALLY 'CAUSE I'LL JUST DUMP IT A TEMPORARY FILE 
I THINK WE SHOULD DECIDE WHAT WE WANT TO TO ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE IN THE END 
'CAUSE ARE WE GONNA HAVE SOME KIND OF TREE VIEW TO REPRESENT THE MEETINGS AND STUFF 
BECAUSE IF IF WE'RE NOT THEN WE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE THE GRAPHICAL DISPLAY DISPLAY A BIT MORE INFORMATION 
MM 
IT'S NOT TOO DIFFICULT TO DO AND IT'S SORT OF A HACK KIND OF WAY 'CAUSE WE CAN JUST TREAT IT ALL AS ONE MEETING 
BUT WE'LL JUST CREATE LIKE HARD SEGMENTS AT THE START AND END OF EACH MEETING 
LIKE ONES THAT ARE RED INSTEAD OF BLACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
MM-HMM 
SO THERE THEN YEAH OTHER THAN WELL WE'LL JUST CREATE A HARD BOUNDARY IN BETWEEN EACH ONE IS YOU CAN USE THE THING 
YEAH 
I MEAN THAT'S QUITE A CHEAP WAY TO DO IT 
IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO DO IT IN THE SUMMARISER 
YEAH IT WILL STILL APPEAR CONTINUOUS ON THE DISPLAY 
SO HOW ARE WE GONNA DISPLAY THE SEARCH FOR THIS CORPUS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
HOW ADVANCED ARE WE GONNA HAVE OUR SEARCH 
BECAUSE I DEFINITELY THINK WE SHOULD RESTRICT IT IT I THINK WE SHOULD UM BE ABLE TO RESTRICT IT TO SPECIFIC SPEAKERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
BUT NOTHING TO FANCY 
UH I UH WELL WITH A SPEAKER I. D. 
YEAH IN FACT IF SOMEONE COULD CREATE A FILE WITH THE SPEAKER I. D. S AND SPEAKER NAMES 
THAT DONE 
OKAY 
WHERE IS IT 
SO IT IN THE GROUP DIRECTORY 
OKAY 
YEAH IT'S UM THE DATA MANAGER SHOULD BE QUITE WELL DOCUMENTED 
SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THAT FOR THE SEARCH QUITE EASILY 
UH FROM YEAH IN THE DIALOGUE ACT LEVEL 
I'VE NOT GET IT READING IN THE TOPIC SEGMENTS YET 
JUST 'CAUSE THAT WAS LOWER PRIORITY 
BUT YEAH ALL THE YOU CAN GET ALL THE UTTERANCES 
SO WHERE ARE GONNA PUT THE SEARCH RESULTS 
IF WE MOVE EVERYTHING AT THE RIGHT A LITTLE BIT AND MAKE A LITTLE BAR ON THE LEFT 
YEAH LIKE THE SEARCH RESULTS IN THERE 
YEAH YEAH 
LIKE WE'LL BASI YEAH 
WE'LL GET SOMETHING TO PRINT OUT THEIR LOCATIONS 
SO WE'LL ARRANGE IT IN A NICE LITTLE ORDER 
WE 
YEAH 
IT'S QUITE EASY TO DO THOUGH 
SO I THINK WE PROBABLY SHOULD 
UH WE SHOULD TRY RUNNING THAT THING AGAIN SEE WHAT IT DOES NOW 
OR JUST DELETE OR BACK UP TO 
UH J SO I CAN PRINT OBSCENE MESSAGES IN THE BACKGROUND TO ME STANDARD OUTPUT 
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK VERY WELL 
IT'S CAPABLE OF SLOWING DOWN THE IDEA BUT SPEEDING UP DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK AT ALL 
YOU HAVE TO PAUSE IT AND PLAY IT FOR THE 
YEAH THAT'S UH THEIR CLOCK COMPONENT 
UH IT'S ALL PART OF THE SAME COMPONENT THAT DOES THAT 
OH NO WE'D HAVE TO LOOK ON THEIR CODE AND SO WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES 
THIS THING IS REALLY BIZARRE 
IT SLOWS IT DOWN A BIT 
THE SPEED UP DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK 
YEAH 
LOSE THEIR GRASP OF ALGEBRA IS TERRIBLE 
WELL YEAH IT SHOULDN'T BE MINUS TWO TIMES IT SHOULD BE HALF 
'CAUSE THAT'D BE PLAYING IT BACKWARDS TWICE AS QUICKLY 
UH IT SHOULD DO BUT YOU'VE PROBABLY GONE PAST THE END OF THE FILE 
I DON'T KNOW 
I THINK IT'S JUST UM IT DID DO IT 
IT'S THAT BRIGHT SELECTION 
B YEAH UH 
THERE THAT OR ANOTHER 
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE QUITE COOL SO IF YOU COULD UM YOU KNOW LIKE SOME APPLICATIONS WHEN YOU OPEN A FILE YOU GOT LIKE A LITTLE PREVIEW 
IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT DISPLAYS LIKE A FIVE LINE SUMMARY WHEN YOU YOU'RE BUT IT OPEN THE FILE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
HMM 
YEAH 
THE SUMMARISER IS QUITE QUICK 
IT COULD PROBABLY DO IT DYNAMICALLY 
YEAH IT'D LOOK PRETTY AND I'M NOT CONVINCED YOU'D GET ANY KIND OF GOOD QUALITY SUMMARY OUT OF IT IN ONLY FIVE LINES 
BUT 
ANOTHER QUITE GOOD THING MIGHT BE UM HOW ARE YOU DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY TO USE TO APPLY TWO TIPS TO THINGS IN JAVA 
I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE 
'CAUSE WHAT WOULD BE QUITE COOL SO IF IN THIS SEARCH RESULT YOU COULD GIVE IT EACH IN A TOOL TIP THAT HAD THE CONTEXT 
LIKE THE UTTERANCE BEFORE THE UTTERANCE ITSELF AND THE UTTERANCE AFTER 
SO THAT WHEN YOU HOVERED OVER IT 
BUT YEAH IF WE CAN GET THE TOOL TIP WE SHOULD USE IT THOUGH 
'CAUSE I THINK IT SHOULD BE QUITE EASY 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
UM IT'S QUITE COMMON IN LIKE SOME APPLICATIONS 
YEAH 
UM ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS JUST ONE VALUE 
UM THE HEIGHT IT DOESN'T CHANGE ONE VALUE DOES IT 
SO IF YOU JUST REMEMBER THE COLOUR THAT IT WAS LOST IT AND YOU ARE DRAW A LINE BEHIND IT IF THAT COLOUR AND THEN THE NEXT ONE 
NO RIGHT NOW IT PROBABLY WON'T BE THAT MUCH BENEFIT 
RIGHT NOW IT PROBABLY WON'T BE MUCH BENEFIT 
SO THIS IS THE COMPONENT BASED EVALUATION HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
UH SO THAT'S A BIT ANNOYING 'CAUSE LIKE IT'S MY HOPE WE COULD JUST GO COBBLE SOMETHING TOGETHER AND JUST SAY LIKE IT'S GREAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK THEY DO 'CAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST UM SIXTY PERCENT OR ISN'T IT 
'CAUSE IT'S I THOUGHT THEY WERE THIRTY PERCENT EACH 
ONLY TEN PERCENT 
I THOUGHT THEY'RE THIRTY 
YEAH 
'CAUSE I THINK WE'D RAMPANTLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW LONG IT'D TAKE TO DO THE ACTUAL UH SOFTWARE ENGINEERING BIT 
SO I'LL PROBABLY JUST BE STARTING STUFF THEN 'CAUSE I'LL BE STARTING THE UH S. N. L. P. THING AND THE D. M. PROJECT 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR YOUR D. M. PROJECT 
OH 
SO YEAH I KIND OF NICKED THE IDEA 
UH WENT ABOUT CODE M. L. 
I'M GONNA MAKE ONE FOR GUITAR TABLATURE 
YEAH 
BUT I I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BIT OFF MORE THAN I COULD CHEW 
SO I THINK IT'S GONNA BE QUITE HARD 
MM WELL TAB DOESN'T USUALLY HAVE MUSIC NOTATIONS JUST UM PITCH INFORMATION 
OH 
SO HOW FAR I GOT ANYWAY 
MM YEAH 
WELL YOU CAN EASY ADD A COMMAND LINE PARAMETER 
MM 
IT MAY EVEN RETURN A FILE DIRECTLY 
POSSIBLE 
PROBABLY 
UM THE THING IS IT I DON'T KNOW 
IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO CALL IT FILE OPEN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 'CAUSE THAT'S IT'S MORE LIKE AN OPTION 
TO SET THE PRO 
BECAUSE IT READS EVERYTHING JUST FROM ONE FILE 
MM-HMM 
OH YEAH THAT DID HAPPEN ONCE BEFORE 
OR EVEN JUST THE ENTIRE CORPUS 
THAT'S WHAT UM COLIN'S FILE HAS GOT 
DOES HAS 
IT'S IT'S EASY TO LOAD THAT MUCH JUST TEXT 
UH I THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO GO FOR THE WHOLE CORPUS BECAUSE THE MEET THE UM THE I. D. IS GONNA HAVE GAPS AND STUFF ON THEM OTHERWISE 
AND IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO READ THROUGH THE LIST OF UTTERANCES WHEN YOU'RE COMPILING ALL THE DATA OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL A AT THE MOMENT THE MAIN DATA I THAT'S JUST UH UNIQUELY NUMBERED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CORPUS 
WELL AT THE MOMENT FROM THE DUMP FILE IT'S JUST GET THEM UNIQUELY NUMBERED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CORPUS 
HMM 
AND IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO DO THAT ANYWAY BECAUSE UM THAT MEANS YOU GET MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH HOW YOU WANT TO GROUP THEM 
AND ONE THING YOU REALLY DON'T WANT US OVER TO HAVE TWO UTTERANCES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE THE SAME I. D. 
YEAH BUT THAT'S THE POINT OF THE DATA MANAGER IS TO MANAGE ALL THAT 
IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY MUCH POINT 
'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S GOT QUITE NICE PROPERTY THAT THE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER ALSO COINCIDES WITH THE ARRAY INDEX NUMBER IN THE ARRAY OF DIALOGUE ACTS 
WHICH IS QUITE NICE 
WELL YOU COULD YOU COULD CHOOSE WHATEVER YOU WANTED 
BUT YOU MAY NOT BE INTERESTED IN THE SAME SERIES EACH TIME 
YOU MIGHT WANT TO DISPLAY ALL MEETINGS THAT HAD A PARTICULAR PHRASE MENTION SAY 
AND THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE ONES THAT WE ENUMERATED AS ONE MEETING IN WHICH CASE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE CONFLICTING I. D. S AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
WHEREAS THE IDEA OF YOU DO IT IN THE DATA MANAGER 
YOU CAN CONTROL ANY LOGIC LIKE THAT PROGRAMMATICALLY RATHER THAN DOING IT BY HAND AND SETTING IT IN STONE FOR ALL TIME 
WELL IT'S JUST GOOD PRACTICE 
LIKE IT SEPARATES THE DATA FROM THE PROGRAMME LOGIC 
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING IS EMBEDDING SOME OF THE PROGRAMME LOGIC IN THE DATA 
YEAH BUT THAT'S A DECISION WE'RE FORCING ON THE USER WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO 
YEAH I DON'T SEE WHY NOT 
YEAH 
I THINK IT SH EVERYTHING SHOULD BE LIKE THAT CONTINUES IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER 
I'M NOT SURE I HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED AT THE DATA 
IF THERE'S ONE VALUE I GUESS YOU HAVE TO PUT A ZERO ONE 
YEAH 
WELL IT MIGHT BE MORE SENSIBLE TO ASSIGN IT ON AVERAGE VALUE 
WELL WE'D WE ONLY USE F. ZERO WHEN IT WAS PRESENT THOUGH WOULDN'T WE 
W WELL WE'D WANT TO USE F. ZERO WHEN IT'S PRESENT 
YEAH 
YEAH IN THE SUMMARISER IT'D BE THE UH IDEAL PLACE TO DO THAT 
YOU COULD USE UM RED GREEN AND ABLE TO DISPLAY UP TO THREE 
WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT IN JAVA 
BUT 
THE TROUBLE IS THAT UH ISN'T A VERY SENSIBLE SCALE 
LIKE IT COMES UP TO LIKE RED TWO OR THREE TIMES AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
OR YOU COULD JUST SPLIT IT INTO TWO BLOCKS I SUPPOSE FOR NOW 
YEAH 
WELL THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT CAN'T SWAP MEETINGS AT THE MOMENT OF THE DATA'S THERE FOR IT 
YEAH THAT'S MOST SENSIBLE WAY TO DO IT I THINK 
YEAH THAT'S WELL IT'S NOT READING THAT IN YET BUT THAT WILL BE PART OF THE DATA MANAGER AS WELL 
LIKE THERE'S ACCESS CLASSES ALL DEFINED FOR THAT 
YEAH IT'S IN YOUR FILE ISN'T IT 
'CAUSE EACH UTTERANCE HAS GOT AN I. D. ASSOCIATED WITH IT 
I DON'T KNOW 
SO JUST KEEP YEAH JUST ENUMERATE UP FOR THE NEXT NUMBER 
THERE 
WELL THAT'S WHAT I MEANT SO IT'S A BIT POINTLESS HAVING TO USE FILE OPEN 'CAUSE IT WILL BE OPENING THOSE FILES ALL THE TIME 
IT'S MORE SENSIBLE TO HAVE TO USE AN OPTION AND THE LOCATION OF THEM 
OR JUST SO YOU CAN CONFIGURE THE THE LOCATION OF ALL THE FILES AS AN OPTION 
BUT WHEN IT STARTS UP IT SHOULD JUST READ THEM FROM THE DEFAULT PLACE 
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE 
UH OF COURSE IT THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T MAKE A DEVELOPMENT VERSION THAT DISPLAYS BOTH HAS TWO WIN UTTERANCE WINDOWS AND UH TWO GRAPHICAL DISPLAYS 
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU IT'D HAVE TO PICK WHICH ONE TO SYNCH THE CLICK IT 
TO ADD ANOTHER DIALOGUE ACT WINDOW IS REALLY EASY 
UH LIKE SAY IF YOU COULD MAKE A UM CHANGE IT YOUR THING IS IT COULD DISPLAY UH LOOK AT ONE TWO HALVES 
SO LIKE THE TOP HALF IN THE BOTTOM HALF THE OTHER 
OR MAYBE THERE ACTUALLY 
MAYBE TOP HALF AN BOTTOM HALF THE OTHER AND THE THIRD ONE ON AVERAGE THAT WE CAN CHANGE THE PARAMETERS FOR 
AND THEN YEAH I COULD EASILY MAKE IT THROW IT THREE DIFFERENT DIALOGUE ACTS 
NO I'D JUST HAVE TWO OF THEM NOT SYNCHED UP BECAUSE IT'S JUST FOR EVALUATING THE DATA 
OH RIGHT YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN 
OH NO NO IT'S STILL GOOD BECAUSE UM 
OH NO IT ISN'T 
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
YEAH 
YEAH I SUPPOSE 
NO HOLD ON YOU IT WOULDN'T NEED THREE INTERNAL TIME SCALES 
'CAUSE ONLY ONE'S SYNCHED TO THE CLOCK OR IT C AND THE OTHERS ARE ALL ABSOLUTE REAL TIME AREN'T THEY 
THAT'S WHAT'S DISPLAYED ON THAT THE BAR IS REAL TIME ISN'T IT 
SO THEY WOULD ALL BE IN THE SAME TIME SCALE 
NO NO ONLY ONE OF THEM SYNCHS AND TWO OF THEM OR JUST YEAH 
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
THEY SYNCH UP FOR THE PURPOSE OF EVALUATING THE DATA 
YEAH 
I MEAN NOT IN THE FINAL VERSION JUST FOR NOW 
YEAH 
HOW EASY WOULD TO BE TO MAKE IT AS YOU CAN ADD ARBITRARY NUMBERS OF THEM DO YOU THINK 
NO LIKE UH DIFFERENT MEASURES TO THE DISPLAY 
WELL THAT'S THE THING IF IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN LIKE AN HOUR OR SOMETHING IT'S NOT WORTH IT 
YEAH 
MM 
BUT THAT'S EASY 'CAUSE MINE CAN TAKE UH ANY NUMBER OF PARAMETERS 
MINE I'LL NEED TO MAKE A MINOR ADDITION TO THE DATA MANAGER AND THE SUMMARISER 
BUT IT'S MORE OR LESS READY TO GO WITH THAT 
OKAY 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SHOULD BE EASY 
WE COULD JUST MAKE THAT RATE BE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
JUST DISCONNECT IT FROM WHATEVER IT'S DOING AND THEN HAVE THAT SET THE LENGTH OF THE SUMMARY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
MM 
WELL IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T REACT TO IT BEING CHANGED AUTOMATICALLY 
IT ONLY REACTS WHEN YOU PRESS PLAY AT THE MOMENT 
SO YOU HAVE TO STOP IT AND START TO TO MAKE ANY EFFECT 
MM 
YEAH I MEAN JUST DISCONNECT IT FROM WHATEVER IT SENDS THE MEDIA PLAYER AND CONNECT IT UP TO OUR SUMMARISERS 
THAT MAKES DIFFERENT LENGTH SUMMARIES 
'CAUSE LIKE WE COULD MAKE THAT NOT EVEN HAVE LIKE A A REAL SORT OF MEANING JUST PUT LIKE MAX AND MINE 
AND THE USER CAN JUST LIKE SET IT IN BETWEEN WHEREVER THEY WANT THE UH WITHOUT ACTUALLY TELLING THEM WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
YEAH 
WE SHOULD CERTAINLY TAKE AWAY THE LABELS THAT SAY MINUS FOUR TIMES AS WELL 
'CAUSE THAT'S INCREDIBLY UNINTUITIVE 
WELL 
BUT IT WON'T MAKE ANY HUGE CHANGES LIKE IT'LL ALWAYS HAVE THE OF THE ABILITY TO READ THE ORIGINAL ONES 
BUT IT MIGHT BE QUITE COOL TO HAVE A COMBINED MEASURE 
LIKE JUST A WEIGHTED AVERAGE IS PROBABLY THE MOST SENSIBLE WAY IT BUT IT AND POSSIBLY THRESHOLDING IT 
NO IT JUST TAKES THE TOP LIKE TWENTY EURO FIFTY OR HOWEVER MANY 
YEAH 
UM WELL I WAS GONNA GO TO THE GYM AT BUT THERE 
SO 
OR TO BE HONEST LIKE IT'S MUCH QUICKER FOR ME TO GET STUFF DONE IN MY OWN 
IT'D MAKE MORE SENSE FOR US TO DIVIDE UP SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS DIVIDING UP TASKS AND THEN DO THEM SEPARATELY 
WELL IT'LL BE AFTER FOUR THEN 
'CAUSE I'M GONNA GO OUT THERE 
THE GYM 
OKAY 
SO MEET SAY FIVE TILL SEVEN THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TIME 
BECAUSE YEAH IT'S MUCH QUICKER IF WE'RE BOTH WORKING SEPARATELY I THINK 
'CAUSE WHEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER LIKE I'VE JUST NOT GOT A LOT DONE 
AND LIKE WHEN I GO HOME I'LL SPEND LIKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AND GET LOADS DONE IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE UP THERE AS WELL THEN 
YEP 
RIGHT 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD 
MM 
MM I SUPPOSE IT SHOULD DEPEND ON THE LENGTH OF THE SEGMENT 
MM I GUESS THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
YEAH I WAS WANTING TO TALK ABOUT THE SEARCH 
YEAH 
YEAH I'M QUITE KEEN TO DO LIKE MOST OF THAT 
LIKE MAKE AN INDEX SEARCH AND STUFF 
YEAH I THINK WHAT BASICALLY WHAT I NEED TO USE UM JUST A LIST OF WORDS WITH AN INDEX TO START WITH FOR EACH MEETING 
UM I SUPPOSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AS LONG AS THEY'RE UNIQUE AND IT CAN I CAN PASS 'EM BACK TO YOU AND YOU CAN SEE THAT AT THE DISPLAY 
UM YEAH PROBABLY 
YEAH 
OH YEAH DO YOU WANT YOU KNOW HOW YOU'VE JUST GOT DATA FOR ONE MEETING ARE YOU NEEDING MORE AT THE MOMENT 
MM I GUESS NOT 
YEAH I THINK WE'RE ALL USING THE FIRST ONE 
HMM 
UM I THINK IT SEGMENTS QUITE WELL THOUGH FIRST ONE 
YES IT'S NOT REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET TO LOOK NICE AND C CLEAN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
MM 
HMM 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH I SUPPOSE MY SEARCH WILL R IT RETURNED THE UTTERANCE 
BUT IF YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR A WORD YOU NEED AN INDEX FOR THE WORD AND THE UTTERANCE AS WELL 
UM TO P IT'D PROBABLY SELECT IT YEAH 
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO DO THAT 
YEAH 
VERY VERY BASIC YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
F YEAH IF IF YOU CAN PASS ME LIKE THE DIALOGUE ACT WITH 
YEAH WAS TO THE SPEAKER 
AND THEN 
IT 
YEAH THAT THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH SHOULDN'T IT 
'CAUSE YOU CAN 
OH YEAH I D I DID THAT YEAH 
YEAH I D I DID THAT AS WELL ACTUALLY 
UM YES IN THE DATA 
YEAH GROUP DATA SPEAKER DATA OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
SO IT SORRY COULD I DO IS THAT 
AT THE MOMENT IT'S READY TO LOOK GET DIALOGUE ACTS OUT WITH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH I SHOULD MAYBE JUST GET STARTED WITH 'EM 
MAKING A SEARCH WITH THAT 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH OF COURSE WE'VE GOT HERE 
THAT WOULD BE EVIL 
YEAH 
OH DEAR 
OH 
YEAH MAYBE IT HAS A DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTOR WHEN YOU CREATE IT 
SO IT 
OH YEAH 
I SUPPOSE 
YEAH 
SO DO YOU THINK A TREE VIEW FOR LIKE AN OVERVIEW OF THE WHOLE SET OF MEETINGS WOULD BE GOOD 
YEAH IT W IT WOULD LOOK GOOD 
HMM 
YEAH I SUPPOSE YOU COULD CALCULATE THEM OFF LINE AND JUST YEAH HAVE A LOOK LIKE A L LITTLE THUMBNAIL OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
I MEAN IT WOULD BE A BIT POINTLESS BUT IT WOULD LOOK GOOD FOR THE PRESENTATION 
YEAH 
I SUPPOSE 
YEAH 
HMM 
I'VE NEVER DONE IT BUT I'D IMAGINE IT MUST BE QUITE EASY 
YEAH IT'D BE NICE FOR A PRESENTATION YEAH YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
SO THAT QUITE EASY TO DO TO GET UM A MOVING CURSOR 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I WAS JUST GONNA DO SOME SORT OF INFORMAL EVALUATION 
YEAH I DID SAY THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH HE DID GIVE US EIGHT OUT OF TEN THOUGH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO I THINK THEY WERE TEN PERCENT EACH 
YEAH 
I THINK THEY'RE WORTH TEN PERCENT 
HMM 
YEAH I SUPPOSE HE CAN SEE THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE WORK ON 
I 
YEAH THAT YEAH THAT INTERFACE AND INTEGRATION YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SAME FOR ME 
OH YEAH 
OH NO I FORGOT ABOUT THAT 
UM I'M GONNA DO LIKE ON ON LINE MUSEUM ARCHIVE 
YOU GOT LIKE A DOCUMENT FOR EACH EXHIBIT 
OH YEAH 
OH THAT'D BE QUITE A GOOD IN ACTUALLY 
YEAH WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO LIKE MUSIC NOTATION AND STUFF 
RIGHT 
OKAY THAT'S N NOT SO 
HMM 
HMM 
WELL I HAVE I'VE ONLY DONE THE FIRST MEETING 
BUT YEAH THA THAT'S THE PLAN 
UM FOR THE TOPIC SEGMENTS 
YEAH SORRY FOR TOPIC SEGMENTS I HAVE 
BUT FOR THE UTTERANCES I'VE JUST GOT ONE MEETING AS FAR 
BUT THE IDEA WAS THAT IT WOULD BE CONTINUOUS 
YEAH 
REMEMBER HOW DID I DO IT 
HMM 
I TH THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE PROGRAM 'CAUSE WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA WANT TO CHANGE IT 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH WE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH IT SHOULD BE EASY TO DO YEAH 
YEAH I'VE GOT THE INDEXES FOR ALL THE MEETINGS I THINK 
YEAH 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
YEAH I'LL BE WORKING ON THE SEARCH I THINK 
IT'S READY TO GET STARTED 
YEAH I MAY AS WELL COME AND YOU CAN SHOW ME HOW TO THE MANAGER WORKS 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
NO I'M JUST LIKE SORT OF LIKE PREPARING PEOPLE FOR ME IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE REALLY NOTHING 
IT LOOKS LIKE BASICALLY LESS THAN ON THE OTHER STUFF 
BUT ACTUALLY DAVE HAS WRITTEN A WHOLE UNDERLYING DIFFERENT STRUCTURE NOW AND IF WE HOOKED IT UP WITH MY DISPLAY 
THEN WE SHOULD FAIRLY EASILY FROM NOW GET IT A STAGE WHERE WE CAN LIKE SELECT INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS AND CLICK ON THEM 
THEN PLAY THAT PART IN A COMPRESSED WAY AND DISPLAY DENSITY INFORMATION 
NOW AT THE MOMENT THE APPLICATION IS 
YES SURE ABOUT IS TO THE MOMENT WE HAVE A DIALOGUE ACT WINDOW AND A GRAPHICAL DISPLAY W I'M NOT SURE 
IN THE INTERESTING THING IS THE SOUND CAME WHEN I TRIED TO LAST TIME AFTER I I TRIGGERED OFF SOMETHING BY CLICKING ON SOMETHING 
YEAH THERE SUDDENLY THEY COME 
PROBABLY THEY'RE JUST SLOW AT LOADING 
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE BUTTONS YET 
SO AT THE MOMENT THE DISPLAY IS STILL DIS COUPLED FROM IT 
IT'S LOADING YOUR DATA I'M NOT QUITE SURE IS THIS IT PROBABLY LOOKS LIKE VERA'S DATA FROM FROM THE LOOKS OF IT 
YEAH THE SEGMENTS ARE MADE UP TO THE MOMENT BUT THE CODE'S THERE FOR INTEGRATING REAL SEGMENTS 
AND THIS IS SUMMARISED BASED ON JUST VERA'S DATA AT THE MOMENT FROM SOME PART OF THE MEETING 
SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT LOADING THE WHOLE THING AT THE MOMENT YET PROPERLY 
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS IS SUMMARISED BASED ON I I REALISE I'M ALWAYS POINTING AT MY SCREEN AND YOU DON'T SEE 
SO THIS STUFF IS SUMMARISED BASED ON ON THESE INTENSITY MEASURES 
AND WE DON'T HAVE THE EXACT AUDIO RECORD FOR THIS 
USUALLY SAY WE SHOULD HAVE JUST COPIED IT 
SO JUST TO SHOW DAVE HAS PUT A UH MUSIC FILE IN THERE AND THE MUSIC FILE IS PLAYING WITHOUT GAPS 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE WAY HOW WE HANDLE IT AT THE MOMENT IS THAT DAVE PREPARES AN AUDIO FILE 
CREATES AN AUDIO FILE DYNAMICALLY FROM JUST THE CHUNKS THAT WE WANNA HAVE AND THAT RUNS IN SYNCH WITH WHAT WE HAVE ON THE 
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHY I'M MAKING LOUD 
IT'S JUST 
SO WE USE THAT RUNNING ALONG WITH PLAYING 
OF THE MUSIC WE USE THE THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE DIALOGUE ACTS 
OKAY SO 
SO AND AND THAT ALREADY THIS PART HERE ALREADY IS DYNAMICALLY CREATED 
UM SHALL I JUST LOAD IT WITH JASMINE'S DATA JUST TO USE A DIFFERENT WHERE'S THE 
QUITE OLD 
YEAH WE WERE B LIKE DOING THIS WE WERE JUST CONCERNED WITH THE WHOLE STUFF 
AND DAVE WHERE WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR 
UM I LOOKING FOR ONE DATA MANAGER 
WHERE UM I LOOKING 
OR IS OUT OF US TO WHERE THE USE IT WHERE THE FILE NAMES ARE 
SO IT HERE 
SO IT UH SHE IS IT HERE WHERE UM WORDS IMPORTANCE FILE 
IN MY DISPLAY 
UH LET ME TOO 
I D 
JUST 
OKAY SO WHE WHERE DID YOU SAY IN PROG 
W YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS JUST ABOUT 
ABOVE THAT 
LIKE ONE 
NO THIS MENU ON THIS ROUTINE 
THERE IS SOMETHING READ IMPORTANCE WITH A ZERO AND THERE IS READ WORD IMPORTANCE WITH A ONE 
SHALL I SWAP THOSE AROUND 
HMM 
WELL WHA WHA WHAT WHAT'S THE DIFFERE SO TH THIS IS REALL 
YEAH 
SHALL I JUST SWAP THE FILE NUMBERS AROUND FROM NOW 
OR WOULD THAT CRASH ANYTHING 
OH YEAH AND AND WE REALLY LEAVE A 
MAYBE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHERE 
MM 
MM 
SO YOU HAVE TIME THIS AFTERNOON 
YEAH 
SO HERE 
SO THIS SHOWS IF WE SEE ANYTHING AT ALL THEN WE USE IT THE MOMENT AT LEAST THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY BE UM HAVING A DIFFERENT SUMMARY 
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING A DIFFERENT UM UM IMPORTANT MEASURE 
SO YOU SEE THAT UM I IT DOES SOMETHING 
LOOK AT THE MOMENT I THINK THIS WAS YEAH YEAH THAT'S AN OLD OLD OLD VERSION 
SO IT SHOWS UM AND SO IF YOU IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THE OLD VERSION HAPPENED 
THEN YOU USE IT MAKES SENSE THAT WORDS LIKE PROSODY JUST LIKE A SING IF THAT WAS THE ONLY UTTERANCE THEN THAT PROBABLY SCORED QUITE WELL AND STUFF 
UM 
WE HAVE TO GET THESE BUTTONS DAVE 
YEAH 
UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T GET THE THE BEAR IN THE DISPLAY WORKING JUST YET 
BUT THAT SHOULD BE A SMALL ISSUE 
YEAH I KNOW THIS IS VERY OLD 
WE JUST NEVER BOTHERED TO UPDATE THE STUFF BECAUSE WE WERE WORKING ON SO WE USE THAT WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT DENSITY CURVE AS WELL FOR THIS ONE 
AND 
YEAH SO FROM HERE WE GO AND IT HOPEFULLY WON'T BE TOO DIFFICULT TO NOW FIRST OF ALL PUT THE RIGHT SEGMENTS IN 
PUT A SLIDING BAR INTO THIS IS THAT PEOPLE SEE WHERE THEY ARE 
SO I'M UH I'M I'M CONSTANTLY TOUCHING STUFF IN MY SCREEN I REALISE 
AND AND THEN MAKE SELECTIONS BASED ON A SEGMENT 
NOW WHAT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE SO WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR LIKE HOW THE SUMMARISER WORKS 
SHOULD IT ALWAYS COMPRESS A SEGMENT AT A CONSTANT LENGTH THOUGH BY A CONSTANT FACTOR OF TIME 
OR 
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK SORT OF IF YOU KNOW IF IF THERE'S A CERTAIN DEGREE OF OF SUMMARISATION WHAT SHOULD BE THE CONSTANT 
IS ALWAYS LIKE A 
SO IT SHOULD ALWAYS WHATEVER REDUCE IT TO HALF THE ORIGINAL 
'CAUSE IN L LIKE AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW WOULD BE THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL I GUESS THAT COULD BE UH ADAPTABLE 
'CAUSE IN AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW WOULD BE THAT YOU COULD SORT OF MAKE IT THAT IT ALWAYS USE THE SAME LENGTH 
SO IF YOU LOOK OF THE WHOLE MEETING IS SELECTED IT COMPRESSES THE WHOLE MEETING AT FIVE MINUTES 
THEN IF ONE UM SEGMENT UH W ONE TOPIC IS SELECTED THEN IT PLAYS THIS WHOLE TOPIC IN FIVE MINUTES 
BUT THAT'S SORT OF THAT GIVES PEOPLE A BIT LESS CONTROL OVER SO MAYBE WE SHOULD DO IT INSTEAD THAT IT YEAH IT C IT YOU CAN SPACE 
YEAH 
WHAT'S THAT YOU DISCUSSED FOR TODAY THOUGH 
WHAT'S THERE TO TALK ABOUT FOR TODAY 
SHALL WE ABANDON THE WHOLE NOTION OF USING THE WHOLE UM ONE WHOLE GROUP IS ONE SINGLE THING AND JUST WORK ON A P CERTAINLY FROM NOW IN PROBABLY FOR GOOD THAT MEANS 
I MEAN 
NO 
DO WE HAVE EVERYTHING FOR THE SAME MEETING AT THE MOMENT 
LIKE IS IT OR YOU YOU ARE YOU ALL WORKING ON THE SAME MEETING 
OKAY 
DID ANYONE EVER CHECK IF THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD MEETING LIKE OUR F COMPARABLY TO OTHERS 
'KAY 
YEAH 
'KAY 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S ONLY DONE LIKE ONCE EVERY TIME THE SELECTION CHANGES RIGHT 
SO EVEN IF YOU SORT OF EVEN IF YOU DO AN HOURGLASS AT THAT MOMENT AND YOU KNOW 
EVEN IF IT PAUSES FOR TEN SECONDS WELL THAT'S TOUGH LUCK THEN 
OH 
THINK WE SHOULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT IF IT TAKES QUITE SOME TIME THAT THAT THE CLOCK DOESN'T START BEFORE OR THAT THE AUDIO AND THE CLOCK OR IN SYNCH SORT OF 
SO THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THERE'S A WAIT FOR COMMAND FOR AN EXTERNAL CA LIKE FOR AN EXTERNAL CALL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EXTERNAL THING IS FINISHED BECAUSE IN GENERAL LIKE THAT'S SORT OF RUNNING PARALLEL 
I THINK 
YEAH 
I HAVE SOME CODE FOR SYSTEM CALLS LIKE THAT HANDLES THE ONE AND THE OUTPUT IF YOU NEED SOME OF THAT 
OKAY 
OKAY COOL 
UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO TALK ABOUT 
WE HAVE 
SO THERE'S THERE'S ONE WEEK AFTER MY DISSERTATION 
SO WE'RE F UH BEFORE THE PRESENTATION OF THE PROTOTYPE 
WHICH I CAN WORK A LOT LOT LOT ON THIS 
SO THAT'S GOOD 
UM 
YEAH WELL THE GRAPHIC DISPLAY WILL DEFINITELY HAVE MORE INFORMATION 
UM IF WE'RE AT THE MOMENT ABANDONING ABANDONING THE CONCEPT OF DISPLAYING THE WHOLE SERIES OF MEETINGS JUST BECAUSE IT'S FOR US LIKE MORE BUREAUCRACY 
MORE COMPLEXITY AND IT PROBABLY JUST WON'T GIVE US ANY BROWNIE POINTS IN THE PRESENTATION 
OR DO YOU THINK IT WILL I MEAN DO YOU THE LOOK 
I C 
WE'RE 
SO ONE MEETING YEAH 
YEAH AND THEN MAYBE HAVE SOME BASIC INFORMATION 
LIKE IF 
YEAH 
SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE DISPLAY THAT KNOWS WHERE MEETINGS PICKING OUT OVER 
AND OTHERWISE INTERNALLY WE TREAT IT LIKE SO WE HAVE CONTINUOUS I. D. S FOR THE SEGMENTS 
YEAH THAT WORKS 
YES BUT APART FROM THAT WE DON'T REALLY DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT SO IF IT WAS JUST ONE MEETING 
YEAH I COMPLETELY AGREE 
SO THE ONLY THING IT WOULD BE THAT THE DISPLAY GETS INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE AND DISPLAYS THEM IS HARD BOUNDARIES 
UM 
YEAH SO THE INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS SORT OF MORE A SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY UM THAT SIMPLY THERE'S ONE BUTTON THAT SAYS FIND SIMILAR SEGMENTS 
AND THEN ON THE SAME DISPLAY WHERE WE DISPLAY THE SEARCH RESULTS FROM THE SEARCH 
WOAH 
WELL I'M NOT SO YOU THINK DISPLAYING UH LIKE AN INFORMATION ABOUT SIMILARITY TO THE SELECT UH LOOK AT A SELECTED MEETING IN IT A SELECTED SEGMENT IN THE OTHER SEGMENTS 
NO NO I THINK THAT'S I REALLY DON'T WANNA DO THAT TO BE HONEST 
UM IT WOULD BE NICE BUT LIKE JUST 
YEAH BUT I IT IT SHOULD APPEAR AS A CONTINUOUS THING F FOR THE YEAH 
BUT I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S WORTH MUCH BOTHER THOUGH 
LIKE IF WE DO A S LIKE A SIMILARITY SEARCH 
AND JUST LIKE YOU SAY FIND ME SIMILAR SEGMENTS AND THEN SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE A LIST AND YOU CLICK ON ONE OF THEM AND THEN YOU GO TO THAT SEGMENT 
I THINK THAT'S QUITE USEFUL UM EVEN WITHOUT DISPLAYING THEM SORT OF DIS CONTINUOUSLY 
WELL I WAS THINKING OF JUST LIKE REALLY JUST A M MORE OR LESS JUST IMAGINE THOSE ARE SEARCH RESULTS EACH LIKE EACH OF THEM SORT OF THEM SORT OF GIVING WHATEVER 
WE SHOULD AIM TO GET SOME NAMES FOR SEGMENTS LIKE JUST SOME EXTRACTION OF SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CALL 
AND IF IT'S JUST THE SINGLE HIGHEST UM IMPORTANCE MEASURE O PHRASE OF A SEGMENT IS THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING TO DISPLAY FOR THEM 
LIKE BASICALLY JUST A SUMMARISATION DOWN TO ONE SEGMENT 
AND IT WOULD JUST BE A LIST LIKE THIS AND YOU CLICK ON ON AND THEN WE YOU THE YOU KNOW 
THEN THE WHOLE BUREAUCRACY KICKS IN LIKE THIS GETS THE NOTA NOTIFICATION THIS GETS THE NOTIFICATION 
AND THEN WE COULD LIKE WE COULD SORT OF USE THE SAME THING FOR ME YEARS AND MINE 
BECAUSE YOURS WOULD SORT OF GIVE JUST THE SEGMENT I. D. S AND MINE WOULD GIVE THE START SEGMENT I. D. S 
SO BASICALLY THIS DISPLAY WOULD HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT A SEGMENT WHERE SOMETHING STARTS 
MAYBE AS WELL MAYBE ALSO SOMETHING WHERE SOMETHING ENDS LIKE FOR MENU AND SOME STRING THAT WE PASS TO DESCRIBE WHAT LIKE WHAT IT IS 
YOU WAIT YOUR SEARCH WHAT WOULD IT RETURN 
WOULD IT RETURN JUST THE SPECIFIC LIKE IT WOULD GO RIGHT AT THE UTTERANCE RIGHT 
YEAH SURE SURE SURE 
UM YEAH 
SO IN IN YOUR CASE LIKE IT WOULD BASICALLY WOULD PROBABLY SAY THE UTTERANCE HERE OR AT LEAST SOME PART OF THE U YEAH 
AND IN MY CASE IT WOULD SAY SOME NAME FOR THE SEGMENT AND THEN YOU WOULD JUST CLICK ON IT AND THEN LIKE THE WHOLE THING WOULD KICK IN 
LIKE YOU C YOU CLICK ON IT AND AND THE SELECTION MOVES AND THE DISPLAY GOES TO THAT PART 
YEAH 
DO WE HAVE THEM WITH A SPEAKER AT THE MOMENT 
OKAY COOL 
JUST RANDOM SP 
SO WHAT ABOUT 
SO WHAT ABOUT A GENERAL LAYOUT LIKE THIS THAT WE HAVE HERE 
THE DIALOGUE ACTS AND THERE THE PLAYER B AND HERE WE'D HAVE A SEARCH BUTTON AND THE SIMILARITY THING BUTTON 
I MEAN WE CAN 
OH GOOD QUESTION 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK WE PROBABLY LIKE WE CAN LEAVE THIS LIKE I. FRAMES AND JUST ARRANGE THEM SORT OF 
YEAH 
ALTERNATIVELY WE'LL HAVE LIKE THE WHOLE THING RUNNING ALREADY WHEN WE DO THE PRESENTATION AND WE JUST ARRANGE IT MANUALLY 
MY C 
UH APPARENTLY MICROSOFT SOMETIMES OR LOOK AT LEAST IN THE PAST THE DEMONSTRATIONS WHERE THEY JUST EXACTLY KNOW WHICH FIVE PERCENT OF THE SYSTEM WERE WORKING 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AS WELL 
HAS ANYONE EVER SEEN ANYTHING FROM THE OTHER GROUP 
THEY HAVE ALL UH 
THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF SC SCARILY GOOD 
IF ANYTHING WE BUILD IN A TIME BOMB THAT ONLY FAILS IF THE DATA IS THE DATA OF THE PRESENTATION 
YES BECAUSE WE ARE NICE PEOPLE 
DAVE THIS RATE THING DO WE HAVE ANY DIRECT CONTROL TO THAT 
OR IS THAT JUST DIRECTLY CONTROLLING HOW FAST IT PLAYS AND SORT OF WE CAN ONLY 
THAT'S A PITY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DOING SOMETHING 
'KAY 
UM DO YOU THINK IF WE OVERRIDE THEIR COMPONENT AND JUST OVERRIDE WHATEVER THE THE ACTION TO THAT SLIDE BAR IS 
SO IF IS SOMETHING LIKE THEIR SKIPPING WOULD IT ACTUALLY CORPORATE WITH OUR SYSTEM TO THE MOMENT 
WOULD OURS SKIP AUTOMATICALLY FORWARD 
YEAH I REALISE 
YEAH WHATEVER 
I THINK THIS SIMPLE THIS SIMPLE ST VIEW THAT WE GET THAT YOU CAN JUST LIKE PASS THINGS INTO AND THEN CHECK WHEN THEY GOT CLICKED REALLY 
WELL COULDN'T THE SUMMAR OH NO THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO OVERRIDE THOUGH 
HMM 
BUT I IN A SENSE I MEAN IF WE USE UH YEAH BUT LIKE PROBABLY THAT WOULD BE THE SAME THING THAT WE ALSO DISPLAY UP HERE 
BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT HAVING LIKE SOME ABOUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY EVEN BE SHORTER THAN FIVE LINES 
LIKE REALLY JUST GETTING I THINK GETTING IN OUR TWO BEST UTTERANCES FOR EACH SEGMENT WOULD BE REALLY WORTHWHILE 
FOR THE SEARCH RESULTS I PROBABLY THINK THAT INSTEAD OF A P A SIMPLE SUMMARY 
SOMETHING THAT DISPLAYS THE UTTERANCE WHERE THE WHERE THE WORD WAS LIKE DISPLAYS IN A HIGHLIGHTED FORM WHERE IT WAS FOUND 
IT TO APPLY WHAT 
WELL ALTERNATIVELY WE COULD ALWAYS HAVE SORT OF A THIRD SMALL COMPONENT WHATEVER 
LIKE IF THIS WAS THE SEARCH RESULTS 
AND THEN THEY ARE JUST LIKE SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S PART UNWRITTEN WHEN MILES GOES OVER THIS ONE IT TRIGGERS THAT ONE TO DISPLAY IT OR SOMETHING 
AND A TOOL TIP SO I THINK A VERY STRAIGHTF YEAH 
IT ESPECIALLY WITH A PREVIEW WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET TOOL TIP FAIRLY SIMPLE BECAUSE IT'S JUST A PROPERTY OF IT 
OH I'VE NEVER SEEN TOOL TIPS DISPLAYING SEVERAL LINES AND STUFF THOUGH SO I WONDER HOW GOOD THAT'LL LOOK 
BUT WE'LL WE CAN TRY THAT 
REALLY 
WELL AS FAR ONLY SEEN TOOL TIPS OF FEW WORDS LENGTH 
BUT YEAH UH THAT SHOULD BE FAIRLY EASY 
YEAH YEAH WE WILL HAVE 
THAT'S ACTUALLY JUST GONNA HAPPEN TODAY AND WE WILL HAVE PROPER SEGMENTS AS WELL 
UM THE THING I REMEMBER LIKE I HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW TO DO IT WITHOUT REDRAWING THE DISPLAY EACH TIME 
BECAUSE THE DISPLAY AT THE MOMENT DOES TAKE 
YOU SEE LIKE IT TAKES A FRACTION OF A SEGMENT TO DISPLAY BUT PROBABLY TOO MUCH TO UPDATE IT IT COMPLETELY REPAINT THE WHOLE THING EVERY SECOND 
SO UM AT THE MOMENT I'M JUST WHENEVER IT NEEDS TO BE REPAINTED 
I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT TO DO AND JUST REPAINTING THE THING IS A WHEEL WITH A MOVING BAR THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA 
BUT UNTIL I THINK OF SOMETHING BETTER 
WHAT I'LL JUST DO SO I'LL JUST I'LL PROBABLY NOT HAVE A MOVING BAR THE WHOLE LENGTH BUT JUST SOME INDICATOR SOMEWHERE 
LIKE WHATEVER JUST UH A TRIANGLE MOVING AT THE BOTTOM FOR NOW OR SOMETHING 
AND THEN I CAN JUST LIKE REPAINT A SMALL OR OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH I HAVE TO FIND I HAVE TO FIND OUT THE THE COMMANDS FOR LIKE REALLY JUST REDRAWING A SMALL SMALL PIECE 
SO I HAVE TO JUST THERE'S EXAMPLES T UM FOR FOR DOING STUFF LIKE THAT 
I JUST HAVE TO READ UP ON IT 
BUT YEAH DISPLAYING THE THE CURRENT POSITION BAR WILL BE EASY PROVIDED THAT MY WHOLE CALCULATIONS OF LIKE WHERE WE ARE IN TIME HERE ARE ALL CORRECT 
I MEAN THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT ISN'T TESTED SO FAR 
BUT IT SHOULD BE 
I MEAN 
SO THE THE GENERAL CONCEPT 
WELL WELL YOU TWO JUST UH KEEP IN WORKING ON IMPROVING THE INFORMATION DENSITY MEASURES OR DO YOU THINK THERE'LL BE A POINT WHEN YOU SAY WELL THAT'S THAT'S IT 
WE HAVE WE HAVE AN INFORMATION DENSITY SCORE AND AND WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO DO 
OR 
OKAY 
'KAY 
WELL I'M ACTUALLY AT THE MOMENT I DON'T SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN WORK ON ON THE PROGRAMMING ANYWAY 
HMM 
NO 
DID WE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I GUESS I MEAN 
UH I WAS A BIT PISSED OFF YESTERDAY ABOUT THAT PART BECAUSE IT WAS SORT OF JUST LIKE A DECISION WE HAD TAKEN 
SO OKAY WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EVALUATION L IN THE FIRST REPORT AND THERE'S NOTHING NOW WE CAN SAY ABOUT IT THIS TIME 
AND I THOUGHT WE SAID THAT IN THE MEETING BEFORE WE WRITE THE REPORT 
AND THEN UH COME BACK WITH THIS WHOLE CRITICISM SAYING LIKE UH 
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT UM EVALUATION AND THEN YEAH BUT WE DID THAT IN THE LAST REPORT 
WE SAID WE'RE NOT GONNA GO UH BUT NOW I EXPECTED TO ONE MORE DETAIL AND UH 
IF THAT TRANSLATES TO EIGHTY PERCENT LIKE IF IF THIS ACTUALLY TRANSLATE TO TO REALLY LIKE THEIR PERCENTAGE SCORES THEN THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
HMM 
SIXTEEN 
WHAT 
THERE WERE FORTY PERCENT EACH AND THIS IS HOW THEY BECAME SIXTY PERCENT NOW WHAT OKAY 
UM HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THERE WERE 
TEN EACH 
NOT BAD 
WE LOSE IT IT JUST MEANS THAT HE'S RELATIVELY LENIENT BECAUSE I MEAN THE REPORTS WERE I THINK THEY WERE OK GOOD REPORTS 
BUT LIKE PROBABLY SOMEBODY ELSE WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THEY WERE EXCELLENT 
SO THAT'S A GOOD SIGN 'CAUSE IT SHOWS THAT HE'S NOT HELL BENT ON 
UH AND THEN HE'LL SEE THE FINAL DISPLAY AND HE'LL REALISE THAT IT WAS ALL FAKE THAT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO ANY OF THE WORK 
SO THE THING IS 
LIKE FOR ME PERSONALLY I THINK A LOT OF WORK WILL BE DONE IN IN THE LAST MINUTE IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE 
THAT'S NOT A NEW STATEMENT AT GENERAL 
BUT 
LIKE THE WEEK JUST BEFORE THE PRESENTATION I HAVE MOST OF THE STUFF THAT I I'M DOING NOW I'M RID OF IT INCLUDING THE DISSERTATION AND DEL 
SO 
HMM 
SO JASMINE IF IF YOU GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND LIKE THIS FOR FOR YOUR CURRENT DATA WOULD THAT HELP IN 
I SORT OF HAVE BEEN PROMISING THIS FOR A WEEK NOW I REALISE 
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU 
UH 'CAUSE IT'S EMPTY AT THE MOMENT 
I MEAN DAVE I IT'S A PRETTY MUCH OR IT SH SHOULD BE A QUESTION OF COPYING IT OVER TO OUR OVER RIGHT 
SO I JUST DIDN'T 
YEAH 
CAN PROBABLY ADD A OPEN FILE DIALOGUE BOX WITH MINIMUM EFFORT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A READY MADE COMPONENT THAT RETURNS A STRING FOR A FILE NAME 
OR THAT WE YEAH 
SO WE CAN DO THAT TODAY 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WHY DON'T WE 
YEAH I KNOW EASIER TO J LIKE IT IT WOULD NOT NECESSARY NEED TO BE A PART OF THE FINAL THING 
BUT WHY DON'T WE JUST PROVIDE SOME MENUS 
EVEN IF IT DOES IT AUTOMATICALLY IN THE BEGINNING AS A START UP OPTION JUST TO ASK FOR A FILE NAME 
'CAUSE THEN WE CAN JUST PUBLISH A SCRIPT THAT YOU JUST RUN AND THEN THIS WHOLE THING STARTS 
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME TODAY LIKE I FORGOT ABOUT THE WHE I'M NOT SURE IF WE HAD THAT PROBLEM BEFORE 
FINDING THE JAVA MEDIA THE JAVA X. MEDIA STUFF IN ALL THE JARS FOR THAT 
YEAH I WAS LIKE SUDDENLY PANICKING AT ELEVEN WHEN I REALISED GOD I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD TO GET IT GOING HERE 
AND THEN I GET THAT THING 
YES SO UM IF WE DO A VERSION WHICH AUTOMATICALLY OPENS UP A FILE OPEN BOX 
YOU'RE YEAH IF SO YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCING THE RIGHT FORMAT WITH THIS ONE UM WITH JUST PER UTTERANCE 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
SO WOULD TO BE EASY SLASH DISSU DIFFICULT SLASH IMPOSSIBLE LOOK AT THE MOMENT IF WE SKIP IT A S TREATING A WHOLE SERIES AS ONE THING 
SO LIKE CREATING ONE FILE FOR THE WHOLE SERIES THAT GIVES THE UTTERA THE IDEAS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND 
BUT THE ENTIRE CORPUS 
IT 
HMM 
YEAH 
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU CAN UH PRODUCE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
LIKE I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR LIKE FOR ONE GROUP NOT FOR THE WHOLE CORPUS 
NO NO NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH NO BUT DAVE UM YEAH SO THA THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING THAT LIKE THE SECOND MEETING SHOULD CONTINUE TILL THE FIRST ONE'S STOPPED 
A AND FOR ONE GROUP THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF LIKE THEIR MEETING'S YOU KNOW LIKE THAT ONE MEETING AND THEN 
HMM 
THE UTTERANCES 
OKAY AND AND THAT'S THE 
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN THE LOGIC WISE 
SORT OF LIKE UNTIL HERE IT'S THE MEETING ABOUT THIS THING AND THEN IT'S THAT THING AND THEN IT'S IT'S THIS LIKE 
WHEREAS 
WHEREAS UH SO MAYBE MAYBE WE'RE TALKING K LIKE IS IS YOUR DATA MANAGER WOULD THAT THEN HANDLE THE WHOLE THING 
WOULD THAT HANDLE IT THAT THIS WOULD ONLY LIKE THE DISPLAY WOULD ONLY DISPLAY ONE GROUP 
YEAH SO IF I MEAN I DON'T MIND WHERE IT'S DONE 
SO IF THE DATA MANAGER FILTERS IT IT AND LIKE I JUST THINK THAT IN IN THE LOGIC OF THE PROGRAMME IT'S IT'S MUCH EASIER TO JUSTIFY WHY WE SAY WE TREAT A SERIES OF MEETINGS AS ONE SINGLE THING RATHER THAN WE 
BUT A 
I B LIKE WOULD JUST I WOULD FIND LOGICAL REASONS FOR WHY YOU CAN SUGG SAY PEOP 
UH BUT I SEE THESE TWO COMPLETELY G DEF LIKE I SEE EACH SER EACH GROUP IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT SHOULDN'T 
OKAY 
BUT WOULD IT STILL LIKE WOULD WE STILL IN THE LOGIC OF IT STILL HAVE CONTINUOUS I. D. S IF WE SAY WE TAKE JUST JUST ONE MEETING 
LIKE WOULD WOULD THE DISPLAY FOR EXAMPLE STILL BE ABLE TO JUST SAY I WANT FROM WHATEVER FROM THE FIRST UNTIL THE LAST AND AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN SORT OF AND AND THE DATA MANAGER WOULD THEN DISPLAY THAT JUST FOR THAT MEETING 
OKAY WELL IF THAT'S POSSIBLE YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT VERA SAID 
NO 
SO YOU YOU'D YOU'D ALSO SAY THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE PART OF THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE IF THERE'S NO F. ZERO 
YEAH 
WELL I I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA DO THE FUSING OF THE DIFFERENT IF INF IMPORTANCE MEASURES ANYWAY 
BU IF THAT'S DONE IN THE PROGRAMME OR IF THAT'S DONE OFF LINE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
DOES ANYONE HAVE A GOOD IDEA LOOK AT THE MOMENT TO PLAY AROUND WITH IT 
WHAT'S A GOOD WAY OF DISPLAYING TWO TYPES OF INFORMATION ON THE ON THE COLOUR DISPLAY 
I MEAN UH THERE'S PROBABLY LOGICAL WAYS LIKE IF ONE IS WHATEVER OF ONE IS THE DARKNESS AND THE OTHER IS THE REDNESS OR SOMETHING 
HAS ANYONE EVER EXPERIMENTED WITH SORT OF DISPLAYING TWO DIMENSIONAL INFORMATION ON ONE COLOUR 
BECAUSE THEN WE COULD DO JASMINE'S AND AND VERA'S PROBABLY IN THE SAME SCALE 
YEAH 
F FOR NOW 
NO FOR NOW 
LIKE YEAH FOR US 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK WE SH WE SHOULDN'T 
WE SHOULD ASSUME A N ASSUME A NON LINGUISTIC USER 
BUT I THINK PROBABLY FOR US LIKE IN DEVELOPING IT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING 
YEAH SO UM I'LL TRY THE RED GREEN BLUE 
WH WHAT'S DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THIS UH AND SATURATION THING LIKE WHAT THAT N NOBODY'S DONE MUCH COLOUR WORK 
OH ACTUALLY IT'S NOT A PROBLEM OF DOING IT 
LIKE I THINK IT'S 
OKAY 
OKAY WELL I GUESS I'LL JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE PHOTOSHOP COLOUR CUBE OR WHATEVER IT IS GIMP COLOUR CUBE AND LIKE IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
'KAY SO WE'LL PRODUCE A VERSION OF THIS WHICH OPENS UP WITH A DIALOGUE BOX UM WHERE YOU CAN SELECT A FILE 
SO THAT RIGHT DAVE 
WOULD WE BE ABLE TO DO THAT 
AND AND THEN YOU'LL GET THIS TYPE OF DISPLAY WITH THAT FILE 
AND THAT'S UH AT THE MOMENT OR WE USE ARE WE ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT USING THAT ONE MEETING THAT EVERYONE IS USING NOW 
OR TALK ABOUT SWAT SWI SWAPPING NOW 
SWITCHING 
YEAH 
SO EVERYONE SHOULD PRODUCE STUFF FOR THE WHOLE CORPUS NOW 
OR 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WE NEED THE EXPLICIT INFORMATION ABOUT EACH MEETING THEN 
LIKE SORTA WHI FROM WHICH UTTERANCE WHICH UTTERANCE IT GOES AND STUFF 
SO ANYONE IS ANYONE PROVIDING THAT AT THE MOMENT 
I DIDN'T DOES ANY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL IF YOU 
YEAH I'M NOT SURE ABOUT 
THAT 
SO NO I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND MUCH ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT TO USE TO DO IT D DIFFERENT THINGS 
WELL AS L AS LONG AS YEAH 
AS LONG AS EVERYTHING'S IN THE RIGHT ORDER IT SHOULDN'T LIKE WE SHOULD EVEN BE ABLE TO JUST I. D. IT WHEN WE'RE READING IT IN 
HMM 
'KAY 
YEAH SO IF WE EMAIL IT A SCRIPT ON HOW TO LOOK OF LOAD IT 
UM IS YOURS WOULD ALWAYS LIKE YOURS WOULD ALWAYS BE LOADED IN I GUESS 
LIKE YOU YOU THERE WOULD ONLY BE ONE VERSION OF YOUR DATA AND YOU CAN JUST OVERRIDE THAT VERSION OF YOU WANT 
BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A FILE OPEN DIALOGUE BOX FOR THAT THEN 
WELL WHAT WOULD THE OPTION BE 
OKAY 
BUT LIKE SO MAKE IT AN OPTION WHICH ONE IT DISPLAYS OR WHICH ONE IT USES FOR THE SUMMARISATION OR 'CAUSE IT 'CAUSE I WAS JUST THINKING SORT OF USE THAT BOTH JASMINE AND VERA COULD UM SO THEIR DATA WORKING AND 
MM IS THAT INTO GETTING TOO MUCH 
SO WE WOULD HAVE LIKE EACH OF THOSE COMPONENTS FOR 
FOR JASMINE AND OVER 
YEAH I KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT WOULD THAT NOT REQUIRE THREE CLOCKS AND I BUT THAT BUT BUT THAT ALSO MEANS 
OKAY 
'CAUSE THE DIALOGUE UH THE DISPLAY ALSO GETS THE INFORMATION ABOUT LIKE THE RELATIVE AND THE ABSOLUTE TIMES 
SO THAT WOULD BE CONVENIENT IF THAT JUST IF THERE'S JUST ONE OF THAT 'CAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S GETTING MESSY 
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST MAKE A SWAP INS WHY DON'T WE MAKE A SWITCH INSTEAD LIKE 
I DON'T WANNA DO LIKE THREE LIKE THREE INTERNAL TIME SCALES SO THAT'S JUST GETTING MESSY 
WELL I GUESS REALLY I MEAN LIKE ALTERNATIVELY WHY DON'T WE GO FOR THE SIMPLEST THING AND JUST CREATE THREE SCRIPTS ARE TWO SCRIPTS WHICH LOAD A PARAMETER UH F COMMON LINE PARAMETER 
WHICH IS WHICH FILE TO LOAD AND AND THEN IT'S JUST THERE 
OKAY 
YEP 
OKAY 
WOULD THE OTHERS 
UH YOU UH YOU JUST HAVE THREE SUMMARISERS AND THEN THEY'RE ALL SYNCHED UP WITH ONE CLOCK 
OKAY THE OTHER ONE IS JUST A STATIC DIALOGUE ACTS BOX 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEP 
SO WE HAVE THREE COLOUR DISPLAYS 
LIKE THERE ARE 
NO NO SURE 
OR MAYBE JUST START WITH JUST TWO LIKE WITHOUT EVEN COMBINING THEM IN ANY SOPHISTICATED WAY 
JUST JUST TWO 
YEP 
'KAY SHALL WE WRAP THAT UP 
SOR SORRY I'M IMPOSING 
YOU MEAN DISCONTINUOUS 
IF I HAVE TO DO IT F LIKE FLEXIBLY THEN I PROBABLY THEN IT WILL NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULT 
BUT IS IT WORTH ANY EFFORT THOUGH I MEAN 
'CAUSE WE'LL NEVER HAVE MORE THAN TWO AND WE'LL NEVER UH WELL WE'LL EITHER HAVE ONE OR TWO 
SO ON THE END 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF WELL I GUESS YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE 
BUT THEN ALSO WE'D HAVE TO FIND MORE SOPHISTICATED WAYS OF LOADING IT SPECIFYING THE PARAMETERS 
SO THAT MIGHT 
YEAH BUT THAT WE WOULDN'T SO WE'D HAVE TO HAVE SOME DIALOGUE BOX FOR OPENING STUFF 
IT MIGHT BE IT MIGHT TAKE HALF AN HOUR IN THE DISPLAY AND NOT MORE THAN THAT 
HMM 
BUT IT MIGHT ACTU I THINK IT MIGHT NOT REALLY BE WORTH IT TO BE HONEST 
LET'S WORK ON THE OTHER STUFF FIRST LIKE THE OTHER STUFF 
AND JUST PROVIDE LIKE SOMETHING WHERE EACH OF THEM JUST IF IF THERE'S UH A JASMINE SCRIPT AND A VERA SCRIPT AND THEY CH CAN LOAD THEIR STUFF AND SEE THEIR DATA ON ON THE THING 
THEY CA THEY CH CAN USE IT SUMMARISED BY THEIR DATA AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE STATIC ONE 
THAT SHOULD BE FAIRLY EASY TO DO RIGHT 
IF I JUST DOUBLE THE DISPLAY AND YOU MAKE A UH LIKE A NON SYNCHED UP SECOND DIALOGUE ACTS 
AND YEAH AND THEN THEY CAN TUNE FINE TUNE THEIR MEASURES 
I THINK IT WOULD BE COOL IF WE COULD CHECK THE NITE CLOCK F CODE OR WHATEVER CODE TO USE FOR THIS COMPONENT AND SO IF WE CAN ACCESS THOSE RATE THINGS AND AND DO SOMETHING USEFUL WITH THEM AND GET NOTIFIED WHEN THEY CHANGE AND STUFF 
YEAH I THINK 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO 
SO THE THE THING IS IT'S PROBABLY AN EASY TASK TO READ THAT RATE BUT IT'S PROBABLY MORE DIFFICULT TO GET AN EVENT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN IT'S CHANGED 
SO THAT'S WHY WE MIGHT HAVE TO EXTEND NITE CLOCK AND LIKE OVERRIDE THE FUNCTION THAT REACT TO THAT 
OR LIKE THE RATE IS PROBABLY A PROPERTY WHICH IN THE WORST CASE WE'D HAVE TO SET PUBLIC 
BUT IF WE WANNA REACT TO IT BEING CHANGED AUTOMATICALLY WE MIGHT HAVE TO 
OKAY 
SO THEY HAVEN'T SP OKAY 
YEAH SO IT SHOULDN'T LIKE EVEN IF IT EVEN IF UH IF WE HAVE TO EXTEND NITE CLOCK 
I MEAN IT SHOULD JUST BE A MATTER OF CHANGING ONE SINGLE METHOD IN IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEP 
AND WE COULD JUSTIFY ALL SORTS OF STUFF LIKE THAT BY OR IN THE PRESENTATION BY SAYING WE DELIBERATELY TRIED TO KEEP ANY COMPLEXITY AND NUMBERS AND STUFF AWAY FROM PEOPLE 
I THINK THAT'S SORT OF A LINE WE SHOULD GO BY IN GENERAL SORT OF SAYING YEAH WE COULD'VE DONE UH SO MANY TH 
WE DON'T WANNA CONFUSE PEOPLE 
WE GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING SIMPLE AND COLOURFUL WHERE SOMETHING IS MOVING AND WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO L DEAL WITH ANY NUMBERS OR TEXT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR THAT MATTER 
IN FACT THAT'S WHY WE'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF A DOG SITTING ON A FIELD INSTEAD OF A MEETING BROWSER 
IT IS NICE AND IT CALMS PEOPLE DOWN 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SHALL WE MEET IN AN HOUR OR SO DAVE 
I'M PROBABLY GONNA EAT SOMETHING QUICK 
OH OKAY I WAS ACTUALLY I WAS PLANNING THE SAME BUT WE WON'T GET SO MUCH DONE BEFORE THREE THAT'S THE THING 
'KAY LISTEN SO WHY DON'T WE MEET AFTER THREE THEN BECAUSE THEN I CAN LIKE UNTIL THREE MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE ALL THE DISPLAY C 
YEAH SURE YEAH 
SO UH SO WE COULD MEET AT FIVE AND I HAVE THE DISPLAY CODE READY BY THEN 
WHICH DOES THE STUFF LIKE LIKE HAVING A BAR WHERE THE POSITION IS AND STUFF 
AND 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WE CAN MEET IN FIVE AN APPEAL TO FIVE IN APPLETON TOWER AND JUST WORK ON SO I'LL I'LL HAVE MY DISPL I'LL MAKE SURE THAT MY DISPLAY DOES ALL THE STUFF WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT UN UNTIL THEN 
AND THEN WE'LL PUT THESE THINGS TOGETHER 
YEAH 
BUT I MEAN LIKE WE WE SHOULD DISCUSS TOGETHER WHICH WE LIKE HOW THE THE SEARCH INTERACTS WITH THE REST 
SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT COLIN SHOULD JUST DO ON HIS OWN 
IT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM FOR ME TO THE STAGE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I BASED EVERYTHING N NOT HAVING THIS UM 
YEAH 
UH WHAT I ALSO 
YEAH WHAT I ALSO DID WAS HAVING TWO PEOPLE UM ANNOTATE THE FIRST MEETING 
AND SO THEY DIDN'T ANNOTATE THE IN IN UH UH THE SPACES AND EVERYTHING WOULD MESS UP 
I THINK IF I HAD SPACES FOR THE UM NEW VALUES SO WHEN I WANT TO DO CORRELATION IT WOULDN'T WORK ANYMORE 
SO I DON'T KNOW 
UH WHAT I COULD DO IS UM WORK UM FURTHER WITH UM WHAT I'VE GOT NEW AND THEN JUST WHEN I HAVE MY UM UM YEAH 
THE FINAL FORMULA READY I COULD UH TO APPLY TO THE NEW STUFF 
THAT WOULD BE OKAY 
UM 
IN MY UM YEAH WHAT MY UM T. F. I. D. F. IS BASED ON COLIN'S DATA 
SO 
UM I END UP WITH THE SAME 
YEAH 
SO IT STILL THE OLD OLD T. F. I. D. F. 
OH OKAY 
HMM 
YEAH 
I THINK SO IT 
HOW ABOUT THE SUMMARISATION AGAIN YOU WANTED TO BIAS IT ON SENTENCE LENGTH AS WELL 
AND I'VE GOT A SENTENCE LENGTH INCORPORATED INTO MY IMPORTANCE MEASURE AT THE MOMENT 
SO 
OKAY 
BUT IF WE DO IT TWICE IT WOULDN'T MAKE TOO MUCH SENSE 
DON'T KNOW HOW EXACTLY WE WILL WANT TO IMPLEMENT YOUR 
WE CAN 
ARE WE STILL WITH THAT DO THAT WE WANT TO DISPLAY BARS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SPEAKERS 
OKAY 
AND ALSO DISPLAYING THE SPEAKERS BEFORE AN UTTERANCE 
OKAY 
SO TOBY YOU WANTED TO UH HAVE KEYWORDS FOR EACH TOPIC SEGMENT OR SOMETHING 
UM WHO WOULD UH WHO UH PROVIDES THE VALUES FOR THAT 
NO NO 
RIGHT 
BECAUSE WHAT I DO IS UM HAVING UM VALUES FOR EACH SEGMENT AT THE MOMENT 
SO I COULD JUST EXTRACT THE HIGHEST ONES FOR EACH SEGMENT 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOOD OR BAD 
IT COULD BE AT LEAST I COULD PROVIDE SOME VALUE 
UH IT IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME 
I COULD DO BOTH 
OKAY 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SEGMENTS ARE REALLY LONG 
AT LEAST THEIR NAMES AND IF WE HAVE THEIR NAMES THEN WE CAN GET THEIR EMAIL 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH UH SO LET'S PERHAPS UH IN THE MEANTIME TALK ABOUT THE UM UM NUMBERS WE ASSIGN TO THE DIALOGUE ACTS BECAUSE UM YEAH 
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU LEFT OUT THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE WORDS 
SO I JUST EXTRACTED THE ACTUAL DIALOGUE NUMBERS 
AND THE PROBLEM IS UM IT'S PERHAPS MORE UM DANGEROUS TO GET MISTAKEN WITH ALL THESE NUMBERS AND NOT KNOWING WHY THINGS HAPPEN IF WE JUST DEVOTE NUMBERS AND ONE MAKE NEW UH NO NO 
YEAH SURE BUT I MEAN FOR ALL THESE MEASURES THAT ARE BASED ON WORDS UM I CAN AUTOMATICALLY JUST THROW THOSE WHERE IT'S NOTHING 
BUT UM THOSE DIALOGUES ACTS UM LIKE THIRTY THREE IN IN THE FIRST MEETING UM THEY HAVE A DURATION EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE A WORD 
UM SO FOR MY EARL OTHER MEASURES I I GET THEM AND I DON'T I MEAN I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK FOR EVERY SINGLE WRITE A PROGRAMME THAT LOOKS FOR EVERYTHING A NUMBER AND DOES THE MAPPING FOR THAT 
YES 
WHY IS THAT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I JUST WANTED TO UH UM WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S NECESSARY AT ALL TO DO THAT 
YEAH AND IT'S A PROBLEM IF THERE'S NO 
BUT ACTUALLY I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE AUDIO SHOULDN'T THERE 
IF THERE'S UM EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT A WORD I THINK IN THE AUDIO THERE WILL BE SOMETHING TO THAT POINT BECAUSE IT HAS A DURATION 
HMM 
SO DO YOU CUT IT IT 
YEAH I MEAN BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE A SPECIAL FOR THIS 
IT'S JUST 
YEAH 
YEAH UH I MEAN IT'S JUST A QUESTION I WANTED TO RAISE 
OH OKAY SO 
SO UM BY HOW DID YOU ASSIGN THE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER 
DID YOU TAKE THE ONE YOU FIND IN THE ON THE UM X. M. L. FILE AND JUST KNOW PUT IT THERE 
OR DID YOU 
OKAY 
OKAY YOU END UP WITH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO 
WHO HAS THAT GOING 
YEAH 
MM 
PRESENTATION IS EXACTLY IN TWO WEEKS 
UM UH AND OR I THINK WE SHOULD START TO THINK ABOUT EVALUATION BY NOW 
I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME PEOPLE 
YEAH BUT IT'S JUST UH THREE DAYS BETWEEN THE PRESENTATION AND THE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK WE SHOULD UH TAKE THE TIME BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL BE 
BUT WE'LL ALSO HAVE TO WRITE THE THE THING ON THAT TIME 
I DON'T KNOW 
BUT IT'S FIFTY PERCENT OF THE MARK 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH IT WOULD BUY IS SOMETHING 
NO 
MM-HMM 
UH THAT REALLY YEAH THAT MAKES IT REALLY QUITE DIFFICULT FOR US IF WE WANT TO TEST OUR STUFF THE FIRST HAVE TO FIGHT FOR OUR COMPUTERS WITHOUT CARDS 
YEAH SURE 
I MEAN I YEAH YEAH I I JUST CARE FOR THE WRITTEN ONE 
DOES THAT WORK WITHOUT THE SOUND CARDS 
OKAY 
OKAY YEAH 
HMM 
OKAY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT DATA THAT I WORKED ON LAST WEEK 
OR DO WE HAVE ANYTHING MORE IN THIS 
YEAH 
UM PERHAPS MY LIST OF AGREEMENTS 
PERHAPS MY LIST OF AGREEMENTS SOMEWHERE 
YEAH IF WE FIND THEM GOOD ENOUGH 
WE WANTED TO PROVIDE UM THAT IN AN EXTRA LIST SAYING PROBABLY AGREEMENT 
YEAH FOR EXAMPLE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
IT'S A BIT SMALL BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS 
HMM 
STRANGE 
YEAH PERHAPS P BECAUSE IT'S WIDE SCREEN OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
BUT UM OKAY WHAT YOU SEE HERE UM IN THIS PART IS UH 
NO MOUSE YEAH 
THERE IT IS YEAH 
HERE IS UM A LIST OF THE UH M MOST IMPORTANT OR YEAH MOST PROBABLE WORDS THAT OCCUR IN AGREEMENT 
UM SO THE NUMBER IN THE FIRST BRACKETS IS UM SO I RUN IT IN ALL THE B. I. D. B. M. R. AND B. R. O. MEETINGS TO LEARN IT 
UM SO UH THE NUMBER IN THE FIRST BRACKETS IS HOW OFTEN IT OCCURRED IN THE UM UTTERANCES THAT WERE ANNOTATED AS AGREEMENTS BY THE UH DIALOGUE ACT AGREEMENT 
UM AND THE NUMBER IN THE SECOND BRACKETS IS HOW MUCH IT OCCURRED IN THE REST 
AND UM THE FIRST NUMBER IN EVERY LINE IS UM HOW MUCH MORE OFTEN THAT IS PER SAME UM SOME TEXT LENGTH 
SO UM THE NAME UH THE WORDS THAT UH IT GIVES IT OR LIKE QUITE GOOD I THINK 
IT'S UM YEAH EXCITING PERFECT TRUE INTERESTING EXACTLY CORRECT SUPER AND SO NO 
UM AND THEN I RUN IT IN THE FIRST MEETING GETTING UM THE SO WHAT'S ON THE ON THE BRACKETS IN THIS WINDOW HERE IS THE UTTERANCES 
UM AND THE MOMENT IT CAN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCES BETWE I MEAN YOU GET THE SAME VALUE FOR EVERY UTTERANCE THAT IS EXACTLY OR EVERY UTTERANCE THAT IS EASIER 
AND UM FOR THE LONGER UTTERANCES I JUST UM LIKE HOW OFTEN UM ONE OF THOSE WORDS AS IN THERE AND SIMPLY ADD IT UP 
SO THAT SHOULD IN PRINCIPLE FAVOUR LONGER UTTERANCES 
UM AND YEAH AND SO THESE NUMBERS HERE UM IN OUR ZERO THESE HERE UM THAT'S ME 
UM THE DIALOGUE ACT LABELS WHETHER IT'S UM UM IF THEY'RE ANNOTATED AS AGREEMENT THEY'RE NOT ZERO HERE 
SO HERE UM FOR THOSE WHO GET A V THAT GOT A VERY HIGH SCORE 
UM THEY'RE MOSTLY NO NOT ZERO AND SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE ZERO OR O ARE STILL VERY GOOD 
LIKE I I DEFINITELY AGREE UM IT'S A NICE KIND OF AGREEMENT THAT WE PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE 
UM AND WHEN YOU GET FURTHER DOWN YEAH YOU USE THIS WITH VERY LOW PROB UM SCORE ALSO HAVE UM NO AGREEMENTS 
HERE THEY ARE 
A LOT OF ZEROS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
SO IT LOOKS QUITE GOOD I THINK 
UM SO THAT'S WHAT I GOT FOR AGREEMENT 
THEN FOR DISAGREEMENT I DID ALSO ABOUT UM IT'S A BIT MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THERE'S SO LITTLE DISAGREEMENT 
YEAH SO THERE YOU SEE AGAIN IS THE LAST 
BUT IT'S MUCH SHORTER AND IT'S M MUCH WORSE 
SMILIES 
UM THAT IS UM HERE AT THE LIST OF UTTERANCES TO ME GETS US FOR THE FIRST MEETING 
YEAH I MEAN I THINK PERHAPS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BUT UH RATED SO HIGH HERE 
OR THINK 
I THINK 
OH YEAH 
THINK IS ALSO RATED HIGHER IN THE NON AGREEMENT THAN ON THE AGREEMENT 
I MEAN THERE IS SOME FUNNY THINGS 
UM YES 
YEAH THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT I'M GETTING HERE 
YEAH IT'S JUST I MEAN IT'S IT'S EXACTLY THIS THING BUT JUST I WOULD I WOULD JUST HAVE TO RE SCALE THIS FACTOR HERE 
AND I MEAN THIS IS THE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER 
SO 
YEAH I CAN JUST GIVE IT TO YOU IN THE FORMAT YOU WANT 
SO IT W IT WILL JUST K 
AND THEN SCORE YEAH AT THIS WAS JUST FOR SHOWING IT 
HUH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM NO PROBLEM I USED TO HAVE SO WITH ALL THE YEAHS 
BECAUSE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THEY ALL WRITE IT THE SAME 
SO UM I WAS THINKING PERHAPS IT LOOKING UM AT THE UM ACOUSTIC MEASURES I HAVE 
SO FOR EXAMPLE TO MY F. ZERO UM DEVIATION 
BUT UM YEAH 
BY NOW I JUST HAD A LOOK AT THE YEAH DATA UM AND ACTUALLY THE AVERAGE F. ZERO DEVIATION IS ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER FOR THE POSITIVE ONES THAN FOR THE NEGATIVE ONES 
I MEAN THERE IS A P DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO REALLY MAKE SO IF IT 
BUT I PERHAPS INVESTIGATE SOME TIME STILL IT 
YEAH 
SO AND I TH MY MY HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT IF IT'S REALLY YEAH UH LIKE AGREEMENT 
IT WILL SEND DIFFERENT THEN IF IT THEN NOT IF IT IS JUST A BACK CHANNEL 
MM 
BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE THRESHOLD 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE UH YOU HAVE UM YOU DON'T HAVE TO ONLY WITH YEAHS 
YOU HAVE TO ALSO WITH WORDS THAT ARE MUCH HIGHER RANKED 
YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WITH YEP SO MUCH HIGHER RANKED BECAUSE IT OCCURS LESS OFTEN UM IN THE TRAINING THING 
NO 
UM IT'S ONLY IF THEY'RE USED IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS 
YES I B YEAH I KNOW THAT NOT EVERY YEP IS AN AGREEMENT 
BECAUSE YOU UM THIS RIGHT YEP AND OKAY THINGS ARE TYPICALLY ALSO BACK CHANNELS 
YEAH BUT WE WOULD THROW A LOT AWAY THAT ARE QUITE GOOD 
IF YOU IF YOU WOULD SET IT OFF 
YES 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I THINK FOR THIS MEETING UM THERE WERE UM WHAT WAS IT LIKE AR AROUND SI OR NINETY ANNOTATED AGREEMENTS OR YEAH AG AGREEMENT DIALOGUE ACTS 
SO 
I MEAN THE B THE BEST ONES ARE DEFINITELY THIS IN THE FIRST SCREEN HERE 
SO IT COULD JUST 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
PROBABLY HAVE TO PLOT THEM 'CAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE ALSO I MEAN THIS IS JUST ADDED BY DIFFERENT SPEAKERS FOR EXAMPLE 
THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING IN ANOTHER 
BUT IT'S JUST TWO SPEAKERS AGREEING I THINK 
SAME FOR THIS ONE HERE FOR THESE TWO HERE 
I MEAN THEY THEY WILL BE OPTICALLY MERGED ANYWAY 
YEAH OKAY 
THAT WAS JUST WHAT I 
I ONL ONLY KEEP UH THE STUFF I ACTUALLY NEED ON IT AND THEN I CLEAN IT UP EVERY YOU KNOW VERY 
BUT ACTUALLY THIS ALL HERE IS N. L. S. S. D. BECAUSE IT WAS DOT A. THAT DIDN'T FIT IN MY UM QUOTA ANYMORE 
OKAY 
YEAH SAME THING UH UM WITH THE YOOHOOS AND SO NO 
THAT DO NOT INCLUDE MM 
OKAY THEN YOU YOU WILL PROVIDE A FILE WITH ALL THE MAPPINGS FROM THE OLD ONES AT THE 
UNIQUE ONES 
MM-HMM YES 
YEAH BUT NOT TOO DETAILED 
SO 
UM BY THE WAY HOW LONG UM HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE FOR THE PRESENTATION 
YEAH BUT MORE LIKE TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE LIKE AN HOUR 
YEAH I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU PRESENT THE COMPONENTS OF WHAT IT IT'S BASED ON 
THEN YOU WILL NEED MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES TO PRESENT IT I GUESS 
IT'S QUESTION 
YEAH THEN 
MY COMPUTER 
UH IT DOESN'T HAVE LINU LINUX 
SO 
MM 
YEAH 
YES 
AND YOU WOULD OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE TOO COMPLICATED TO COPE WITH THE THE UH SYSTEM IF YOU HAVE TO RE ADJUST IT UH IT A DIFFERENT ZOOM LEVEL TO GET BETTER RESULTS 
I MEAN IT WOULD BEHAVE STRANGELY IN THE EYES OF THE USER 
SIXTEEN TIMES ZERO 
DOES IT 
I HAVE TO CHECK THAT IT 
HMM 
IT DEPENDS WHICH DATA YOU USE AS WELL BECAUSE UM IF YOU USE THE DATA WHERE THEY'RE ALL REALLY HIGH 
IT DOES PREFER ONES FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE IT JUST PICKS THE FIRST ONES IT FINDS 
BUT I'LL CHECK IT IT ANYWAY 
YEAH 
I'VE GOT TIME NOW 
LIKE UM FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS I'LL DO SOME ON IT 'CAUSE I WAS JUST TOO BUSY LAST WEEK 
WHAT'S THAT THAT'S CREEPING OVER THE OTHER SCREEN 
THAT'S REALLY WEIRD 'CAUSE IT'S JUST STARTED CREEPING OVER 
UM WELL AS LONG AS THE TWO CORRESPOND THEN IT'S FINE 
OH RIGHT I SEE 
OKAY 
SO WOULD TO BE WOULD TO BE EASIER IF THERE'S A REFERENCE FILE WITH THE ACTUAL REAL I. D. AND THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER 
SO 
SO THERE SOME ALREADY 
SO WOULD THAT SOLVE THE PROBLEM BASICALLY 
BECAUSE THE WHOLE PROGRAMME WORKS ON THEM BEING NUMBERED AT THE MOMENT 
UM IT'D BE A LOT OF WORD FOR REALLY AN EXTRA P FEATURE GAIN AT ALL 
OR DO YOU THINK IT COULD APPEAR IN THE SUMMARY 
WELL IF IT'S SOMETHING ON THE IDEA THAT'S JUST LIKE A NOISE THEN WE DON'T WANT IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I DON'T I DON'T KNOW 
YOU 'CAUSE THE THING IS IT DEPENDS IF WE WANT TO HAVE TO DISPLAY THE WHOLE THING AT ONCE 
IF YOU LEFT THEM IN HOPEFULLY IT WOULDN'T AFFECT THE WAY THE PROGRAMME WORKS 
WELL I DON'T IN THE PROGRAMME IT'S JUST THEY'RE NOT IN THE RAW TEXT FILES 
WELL OTHER WAY 
EITHER WAY IS FINE BY ME AS LONG AS THE TWO WO THINGS UM IT UP 
SO FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHETHER THESE ARE IN OUR IT 
NO MINUS ONE OR SOMETHING 
YEAH CERTAINLY POSSIBLE 
ACTUALLY YEAH 'CAUSE THE T. F. I. D. F. WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WITH 
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST OMIT THEM THEN 
OKAY SO MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE THEM OUT THEN 
UH IT'S THE BAR IS WORKING NOW 
UH IS THE SUMMARY IS PROBABLY OKAY 'CAUSE IT DOES THE JOB 
YEAH 
UH I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH ONE TO USE IT THE MOMENT 
YEP THAT THAT THOSE NAMES ARE MISLEAD WELL THE T. F. I. D. F. IS FINE BUT WORD IMPORTANCE IS COMPLETELY MISLEADING IT'S NOT WORD IMPORTANCE AT ALL 
SO IT VERY COMPLEX OR IS IT OR UH JUST MULTIPLYING TOGETHER 
IT A POWER 
YEAH 
I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE 
YEAH 
YEAH I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE ACTUALLY 
YEAH 
UH IT'S STILL WORKING LIKE IT SHOULD DO 
YEAH 
SO IT DID WORK 
YEAH THAT THAT IS ANCIENT DATA THOUGH 
SO 
HAVING SAID THAT IT'S PICKING OUT SOME INTERESTING STUFF 
LIKE WE'RE LOOKING AT ATLAS YOU'D EXPECT TO SCORE QUITE HIGH 
YEAH MAYBE BUT ATLAS YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT IT'D BE QUITE HIGH 
I'M JUST QUITE SURPRISED IT ALL ACTUALLY WORKED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON LIKE INCOMPLETE VERSIONS THAT HAVEN'T WORKED FOR A LONG TIME 
AND LIKE TO USE IT ALL COME TOGETHER 
YEAH I'LL DO THE FIRST THING I'LL DO IS MAKE A LOAD BOX FOR SELECTING A FILE 
AND A SCRIPT THAT SETS THE CLASS PATH IS IT CAN BE RUN WITH JUST A SCRIPT 
SO P CLASS PATH IS LIKE THIS LONG 
BUT WE'LL HAVE PARAMETER FOR THAT 
YEAH 
AND TWENTY 
YEAH WE NEED TO ADD SOME SANITY CHECKING IN SOME OF THE STUFF 
YEAH 
BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T NEED TO EVALUATED FOR THE PRESENTATION DO WE 
SO IT 
UH 'CAUSE IT WAS MOVED BACK WASN'T IT 
YEAH 
I CAN ROPE PEOPLE IN IT IT DOING IT A FEW PEOPLE AT LEAST 
AS LONG AS WE DESIGN IT AS LONG AS WE DESIGN IT BEFORE HAND UH I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY MANAGE TO ACTUALLY DO IT IN THE THREE DAYS AFTER 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE USER EVALUATION 
WE SHOULD PROBABLY WRITE SOME USER DOCUMENTATION 'CAUSE I BUT THAT WILL GET US MARKS 
YEAH THEY'D LOVE THAT KIND OF STUFF 
JUST WE'LL JUST WRITE YOU KNOW LITTLE HELP FILES OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
HAVE YOU JAVA DOC ED IT 
AND ALSO WHERE IS IT 
OKAY 'CAUSE THE CODE VERSION IN THE GROUP DIRECTORY IS NOT THE RIGHT ONE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
NO DIRECTORY YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL WE SHOULD WAIT TILL WE HAVE TO READY FOR UM YOU GUYS TO USE 
THEN WE'LL PUT IT BACK IN THE GROUP DIRECTORY 
SO I'LL TRY AND DO THAT TODAY 
'CAUSE I'VE GOT TIME TODAY 
AND AS LONG AS I DON'T RUN INTO PROBLEMS I DON'T USE IT TAKING TOO LONG 
WELL IN THAT CASE IT IT'S PROBABLY JUST I MEAN THAT'S PROBABLY FINE 
I MEAN 
YEAH 
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH SHOULD BE DONE IN THE PROGRAMME BECAUSE UH 
I DON'T KNOW 
I THINK IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE DONE OFF LINE 
THE BASIC UH COMBINING OF ALL THE FACTORS 
YEAH YEAH SURE 
HOPEFULLY WE CAN TAKE OVER THAT RIGHT ONE 'CAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO 
THAT'D BE QUITE NICE 
I BUT YOU CAN JUST UH JUST ADD TO TO THE UM PANEL 
LIKE WHAT I BUT THAT'S A PRE MADE SWING COMPONENT THAT LITTLE SLIDER AND ALL YOU DO IS DID IT IT A PANEL 
YEAH 
CAN YOU SEND ME A LINK TO THAT APPEAR SO THAT I'LL IMPLEMENT THAT IN SUMMARIZER 
OH NO I'VE NOT LOOKED AT IT 
YEAH LIKE LAST WEEK I JUST NOT DONE ANYTHING 
BUT CAN'T USE IT TAKING LONG AGAIN 
BUT IT BE HONEST I DID LIKE NOTHING REALLY ON IT LAST WEEK 
SO AND I'VE GOT TIME TODAY TOMORROW AND PROBABLY FRIDAY 
SO 
MM-HMM 
IT'S JUST ANNOYING BECAUSE I NEED TO DO THAT IN A DICE MACHINE 
SO I CAN'T GET THEM TO COMPILE UNDER WINDOWS 
YEAH 
AND UM MOST THE DICE MACHINES DON'T HAVE WORKING SOUND CARDS 
SO 
NO IDEA 
YEAH 
I'M NOT SURE HOW IT IF IT IF IT CAN DO SOUND OR NOT 
I'VE NO IDEA 
BUT LIKE WHAT I CAN DO IS UM 
I I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT IT'LL JUST BE WRITING A SCRIPT AND IT WILL JUST GO 
AND AS LONG AS I CAN TEST THE SCRIPT LIKE ONCE AND IT'S WORKING FINE I CAN JUST MAKE IT RETURN DUMMY STUFF IS IT WORKS ON OTHER MACHINES 
YES 
SO 
OH ACTUALLY I KNOW WHAT I CAN DO 
I CAN THEN 
I CAN CHANGE THE SCRIPT 
SO IF I'M USING MY ONE AT HOME 
I CAN JUST ADD S. S. H. STUFF ON TO EV EVOKE THE SOUND TOOLS ON THE UH ON DICE AND THEN COPY 'EM BACK 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
I'M SURE I CAN FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO DO IT ANYWAY 
IF IT COMES TO TO I'LL JUST UM INSTALL NETBEANS AND STUFF IN MY LINUX MACHINE AND WORK ON THAT 
WELL THAT TO BE HONEST THERE WON'T BE A PRIMITIVE IN BETWEEN STAGE 
JUST IT'LL JUST WORK HOPEFULLY 
IN THEORY AT LEAST ANYWAY 
I WONDER IF WE SHOULD UM DO SOMETHING LIKE DROPPING THE BOTTOM THIRD 
THEN RE MAPPING THE LOWEST REMAINING ONE TO ZERO AND SCALING IT LIKE THAT 'CAUSE YOU GOT A MUCH NICER DISTRIBUTION LIKE THAT 
UM I'VE NOT USED TO TO DO THAT BEFORE BUT 
YEAH 
THERE IS A WAY OF CALCULATING IT UM YEAH WELL CALCULATING IT CUMULATIVELY BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER IT 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY QUITE A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY QUITE SENSIBLE 
YEAH I CAN'T REMEMBER IT OFF HAND BUT I KNOW THERE IS NO 
BUT IT COULD BE IT COULD BE FINE I MEAN RUNNING OVER THE DATA TWICE PROBABLY IS OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH NEVER CLOSES THE PROCESS WHEN HE DOES IT NOW 
THEY SAID IT INTO UM CLOSE THE PROCESS WHEN YOU CLICK THE CROSS 
YEAH IT REFUSES TO R LOAD THE CLOCK FOR SOME REASON 
I DON'T KNOW WHY 
YEAH YOU STILL YOU SET YEAH YOU STILL GET THE WRITTEN ON AND THE DISPLAY 
THE ONLY THING YOU DON'T GET IS THE CLOCK 
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BOTHER 'CAUSE WE'LL RUN IT IN A SOUND CARD VERSION 
THE YES THEY CAN 
ALL THAT HAPPENS IS IT REFUSES TO LOAD LOAD THE CLOCK 
YOU STILL GET THE DISPLAY ON THE SUMMARY 
SO THE YEAH THE MOVE UH BUT YOU CAN STILL CLICK ON THE SEGMENTS AND THAT'LL STILL WORK WON'T IT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
UM UH THERE MUST BE A WAY OF DETECTING WHETHER THE CLOCK'S LOADED 
LIKE IN FACT THERE THERE IS 
YOU CAN TRY AND SET SOMETHING ON THE CLOCK AND SO TRY AND CATCH AND THEN IF YOU CATCH THE EXCEPTIONS SET THE FLAG 
WE COULD PUT THIS ONE DISPLAY 
INSTEAD OF A LIST WHAT ABOUT PUTTING IT IN THE DISPLAY 
CAN YOU CLICK ON A POINT IN TIME ON DISPLAY AND JUMP OUT THERE YET 
OKAY 
'CAUSE THAT'D BE PRETTY GOOD 
NO I DON'T GET THAT IN MY MACHINE 
NO I DON'T 
NO 
OKAY 
AS LONG AS YOU CAN SKIP MORE ACCURATELY THAN THE TIME STEPS THAT'S FINE 
'CAUSE OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT RISK CUTTING BITS OFF 
LIKE IF YOU WANT TO JUMP TO A POINT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO JUMP MORE ACCURATELY THAN HALF SECOND 
BY HALF SECOND YOU'LL MISS WORDS 
YEAH I THINK SO 
OH YEAH I CAN YEAH I CAN DO THAT 
OF WHAT WE DISPLAY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OBVIOUSLY WE'LL HIDE THAT IN THE PRESENTATION 
BUT WE DON'T WANT I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO HAVE EXPOSED TO THE USER DOING THINGS LIKE ADDING THE THRESHOLD OF WHICH AGREEMENTS WE DISPLAY 
DECISION 
YEAH THEY UH THAT DOES LOOK QUITE PROMISING DOESN'T IT 
SO YOU CAN HAVE HAPPY FACES AND ANGRY FACES 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT MAKES SENSE 
SO CAN YOU UM 
AS WELL THAT PRODUCE BASICALLY AN AGREEMENT AND A DISAGREEMENT SCORE FOR EVERY DIALOGUE ACT 
SO COULD YOU PUT THEM IN THE SAME FORMAT AS THE OTHER DATA 
AND I'LL MAKE US TO TO READ IT IN 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
SO I COULD PROBABLY I COULD PROBABLY READ IT FROM UH THAT FILE ALREADY 
MY PREFERRED WOULD BE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER THEN YOU CAN PUT BOTH THE SCORES IN ONE FILE 
YOU CAN PUT BOTH THE SCORES IN ONE FILE OF IT MAKES IT EASIER 
YEAH 
AGREEMENT AND ONE DISAGREEMENT 
SO I'LL READ THAT INTO UM I'LL MAKE IT PART OF THE GET MEASURE THING 
SO YOU CAN JUST GET IT WITH A FLAG 
USING GET MEASURE 
SO YOU KNOW HOW ZERO IS T. F. I. D. F. 
NO SO UM THE WELL I'VE CALLED IT WORD IMPORTANCE BUT THAT'S A REALLY M MISLEADING NAME 
YEAH PROBABLY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OKAY 
UH THE PROBLEM IS YEAH IS OCCURRING NOT ONLY USE AN AGREEMENT ABOUT REALLY FREQUENTLY IS LIKE UH AN ENCOURAGEMENT AS WELL ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
HOW WHAT'S THE HIGHEST UM RANKED ONE THAT THAT KIND OF PROBLEM OCCURS WITH 
'CAUSE IF IT'S BELOW ABOUT 'CAUSE I SAW THERE'S ONES UP ON THE EIGHTIES WASN'T THERE 
IF IT'S BELOW LIKE FIFTY IT'S PROBABLY ARE EXACTLY NO THEY'RE ALL ABOUT ONE 
'CAUSE WE IN THE DISPLAY WE PROBABLY TAKE QUITE HIGH 
SO IT'D ONLY MATTER OF IT OCCURS IN ONES THAT ARE REALLY HIGHLY RANKED 
YEAH 
WELL OTHERWISE YOU'D GET ICONS ALL OVER THE PLACE 
SO ANYWAY 
YEAH 
SO WE WANT PROBABLY WANT TO TAKE A THRESHOLD AT LEAST OF FIFTY OR SIXTY JUST AS A LOOKING AT THAT 
IT WE PROBABLY WON'T WANT TO DISPLAY NINETY 
WE'D WANT TO RATE THEM IS HOW IMPORTANT THEY WERE WOULDN'T WE 
YEAH 
YEAH AND SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT 
IN AGREEMENT AT THE END 
SO YEAH WE'D PROBABLY WANT TO MERGE ONES THAT WERE VERY CLOSE INTO ONE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE SOME LOGIC WHEN IT DISPLAYS AT THAT SAYS IF THERE'S ONES VERY CLOSE TOGETHER TO JUST CENTRES IT AMONG THE 
YEAH IT'S LOOKING QUITE GOOD THOUGH 
I THINK IT'S ALWAYS REALLY FUNNY THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS WHO DON'T USE THE COMPUTER MUCH 
THEIR DESKTOP'S REALLY TIDY AND WHEN YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO IS IT ALL THE TIME THERE'S STUFF EVERYWHERE 
SO MINE'S LIKE THAT AS WELL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE SHOULD UM DOWNLOAD A DICTIONARY AND CHECK OUR UTTERANCES BEFORE WE UH LISTEN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY REAL WORDS 
DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
YEAH I MEAN IS HOW IT TURNS OUT 
IF THEY LOOK GOOD THEN THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF DOING IT IS ANY I SUPPOSE 
ACTUALLY WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IS TAKE THE HIGHEST THREE OR FOUR AND THEN JUST MERGE THEM TOGETHER INTO AN UTTERANCE 
IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT IT'D GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
YEAH 
YEAH I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TIME FOR THAT 
WHICH IS A SHAME 'CAUSE IT WOULD'VE BEEN COOL 
UM AT THE MOMENT IT DOESN'T REALLY CARE HOW MANY MEETINGS IT'S DISPLAYING 
JUST DRAW A BIG BLACK LINE IN THE BORDERS I THINK 
WELL Y Y YOU CAN IF YOU WANT IT 
IT'S 
'CAUSE IT J IT CAN DISPLAY FROM ANY UTTERANCE TO ANY OTHER UTTERANCE 
IT DOESN'T REALLY 
DO THEY 
OH 
YEAH I'D PREFER THEM DRAWN CONTINUOUSLY 
OKAY 
BECAUSE THAT WAY ALL WE HAVE TO DO IT DISPLAY EA MORE THAN ONE MEETING IS HAVE A HARDER BOUNDARY DRAWN 
ONE THING WE WILL HAVE TO DO SO WE WANT WE'D REALLY WANT A DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR IF WE CLICKED ON A WHOLE MEETING THAN A SEGMENT 
SO IF THERE'S MORE THAN ONE MEETING DISPLAYED 
IT SHOULD UM IF YOU CLICK EVEN IN IN THE SEGMENTS OF THAT MEETING I THINK IT SHOULD RE INITIALIZE AND DISPLAY THAT JUST THAT MEETING 
SO I'M NOT SO I'M NOT SURE HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE TO DO 
IT JUST NEEDS TO KNOW WHETHER IT'S DISPLAYING MORE THAN ONE WHOLE MEETING DOESN'T IT 
THAT'S THE ONLY 
KNOWLEDGE IT WOULD NEED 
BUT ANYWAY WE CAN SORT THAT IT IF WE HAVE TIME ONCE WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING ELSE 
YEAH 
THAT'LL GET S S SUFFICIENT TO CLAIM THAT WE HAD IMPLEMENTED SOME KIND OF ZOOM AS WELL 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S NOT DONE THE VERY CLEVER WAY BUT IT DOES WORK 
MM-HMM 
BASICALLY DO A CODE FOR US ON IT 
UM I'LL PROBABLY TONIGHT JUST WORK ON GETTING A FROZEN VERSION THAT WORKS CONSISTENTLY 
AND UM IF YOU COULD DOCUMENT IT FOR UM THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH FOR ME TO ADD IT IN 
UNLESS YOU WANT TO DO IT 
BUT MY CODE I'VE NOT DOCUMENTED THE PROGRAMME MANAGER CLASS 
SO THOUGH IT'S A BIT HAIRY AT THE MOMENT ISN'T IT 
UH-HUH 
OKAY SO PROBABLY WHAT YOU'D WANT TO DO IS UM 
DETECT WHERE THE MOUSE IS AND CHANGE THE DEFAULT TOOL TIP FOR THAT COMPONENT 
BECAUSE IT AUTOMATICALLY DISPLAYS AT THE CORRECT POSITION WHEN YOU HOVER 
YEAH YOU MIGHT NOR REALLY WANT TO BE CREATING A NEW ONE EVERY TIME YOU MOVE THE MOUSE 
I'LL HAVE A LOOK THROUGH SOME OF MY JAVA BOOKS 'CAUSE IT MIGHT BE THE SORT OF THING THEY HAVE IN THERE 
MM 
SO THERE ALL IS THAT G VERSION ALL IN THE 
OKAY 
COOL 
SO I'LL START WORKING ON THAT IN LIKE HALF AN HOUR OR SOMETHING AND IT WILL BE THE 
OKAY 
WE REALLY NEED TO GET IN CONTACT WITH THE OTHER GROUP AND SO IF THEY WANT TO DO A JOINT EVALUATION 
SO YOU NEED TO GET THEIR EMAIL ADDRESSES 
ARE THEY 
THAT'D BE HANDY 
YEAH WE CAN GET THEM 
SO YOU DO IS SENDING THEM AN EMAIL 
'CAUSE I WAS HOPING THAT STEVE WOULD MENTION IT IN 'CAUSE WE'VE MENTIONED IT AT HOME AS MANY TIMES 
BUT UH OBVIOUSLY HASN'T 
YEAH 
SO THERE'S THE FRAME PROBLEM 
NO I THINK IT'S COMING TOGETHER NOT BAD AT THE MOMENT ACTUALLY 
DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
I CAN'T USE IT GOING ON FOR AN HOUR TO BE HONEST 
YEAH I THOUGHT IT WAS A DEMO BASICALLY 
HALF AN HOUR 
AND LIKE TEN MINUTES OF THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY SET UP TIME AS WELL 
TEN MINUTES OF THAT WILL PROBABLY BE SET UP TIME AS WELL 
I W MAYBE YOU SHOULD PRESENT IT IN YOUR LAPTOP 'CAUSE WE CAN BE REALLY SURE IT'S RUNNING BEFORE WE COME 
I COULD PROBABLY GET MY COMPUTER IN IF I COULD GET SOMEONE TO GIVE ME A LEFT 
I KNOW A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WITH CARS 
YEAH 'CAUSE I WOULDN'T NEED TO BRING A MONITOR OR ANYTHING I'LL JUST NEED TO BRING THE BOX 
I'M PRETTY SURE I COULD NICK A LIFT OFF SOMEONE 
OR J. BUILDER 
IN FACT YOU WON'T EVEN YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN AND THERE AS LONG AS YOU GOT JAVA INSTALLED 
YEAH 
OH CRAP I FORGOT ABOUT THAT 
CYGWIN MAYBE 
IN CYGWIN 
NO BUT CYGWIN SHOULD RUN UM THE JAVA AS WELL 
A SOUND SERVER 
HOPEFULLY YEAH 
YEP I'LL DO THAT TODAY 
AND I'LL YEAH I'LL MAKE A SCRIPT TO RUN OUT AND PUT THAT IN THE GROUP DIRECTORY 
AND I'LL SEND AROUND THE EMAIL WHEN IT'S DONE 
IT'LL BE THE BUT WHERE IT CREATES THE CLOCK 
OR IS THERE STUFF ON THE DISPLAY AS WELL 
OKAY 
WELL IT REALLY WE SHOULDN'T EVEN NEED A FLAG 
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT WITH EXCEPTIONS 
I MEAN THAT'S THIS IS KINDA NOT EXACT CASE THAT EXCEPTIONS ARE MADE FOR REALLY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OH NO IT'S GONNA HAVE TO DO SOMETHING A BIT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT 
WHAT IT WILL HAVE TO DO IS DE REGISTER EVERYTHING IS TIME HANDLERS AND THEN UPDATE AND THEN RE REGISTER THEM 
OKAY 
HAVE YOU GOT A COMPONENT FOR DISPLAYING LISTS OF MATCHES 
'CAUSE THAT'D BE PRETTY USEFUL 
COOL 
OKAY YEAH I MEAN IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TOO HARD TO DO 
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DE REGISTER EVERYTHING THAT'S A TIME HANDLER FIRST BEFORE YOU DID THE STUFF ON 
BUT UM DEPENDS WHAT BEHAVIOUR WE WANT 
DO WE WANT WHEN YOU CLICK ON A SEARCH RESULT WE DEFINITELY WANT THAT ONE TO APPEAR IN THE SUMMARY 
YEAH 
YEAH IT SETS IF YOU LOOK AT SET SELECT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU WANNA DO YEAH 
DOES IT INTO 
YEAH BUT IT W IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE UM IF IT'S JUMPED TO IN THE END TEXT OR 
THEN YOUR DISPLAY WOULD THE THE LINE'LL JUMP WON'T IT 
YEAH 
UH AND ALSO THE REAL TIME AND PLAY TIME STUFF WOULD CHANGE 
SO WE YEAH WE NEED TO RE INITIALIZE THE DISPLAY THEN DON'T WE 
OKAY 
BUT YEAH WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO ENSURE THAT THE SEARCH RESULT IS IN THE SUMMARY THAT'S CREATED 
SO MY WE PROBABLY WANT A DIFFERENT SUMMARY CONSTRUCTOR THAT TAKES AN AN ADDITIONAL ARGUMENT OF AN I. D. 
AND IT WILL THAT W UTTERANCE WILL ALWAYS BE IN THE SUMMARY 
YEAH I SUPPOSE 
BUT THE TROUBLE IS THAT STILL DOESN'T GUARANTEE THAT IT'LL APPEAR BECAUSE IF YOU GOT ENOUGH OF THEM THAT ARE HIGH SCORED IT PREFERS THE FIRST ONES IT USES 
YEAH I SUPPOSE 
HMM MAYBE 
BUT YOU COULD DO YOU CAN UM ACHIEVE THE SAME EFFECT 
YEAH 
PROBABLY THE WAY TO HANDLE THAT WOULD BE TO MAKE A SUMMARY THAT'S THE SAME LENGTH IS THE SELECTION AND THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE SEARCH TERM CAME UP 
YEAH 
YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH 
BUT WE'LL HAVE THAT SLIDER OBVIOUSLY 
YEAH 'CAUSE THAT'S VERY USEFUL THING 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND I'LL START WORK ON SAY TWO 
WELL TO BE DONE BY THEN 
I KNOW 
DOESN'T LOOK GREAT DOES IT 
UH UH 
MM 
YEAH THERE IS THERE'S INDEX FILES ALREADY 
YEAH 
YEAH IN THE RAW TEXT INDEX DIRECTORY 
YEAH AND IT UH ALLOWS YOU TO MAP BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT I. D. S 
YEAH I GUESS 
'CAUSE WE CAN'T SHOW IT IN THE DISPLAY 
YEAH THEY'VE BEEN CUT OUT THE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY WORDS 
SUPPOSE 
HUH 
NO I GUESS NOT 
HMM 
THAT'S JUST 'CAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE A BLANK LINE IN IT 
SEEMS A BIT STUPID 
BUT I CAN FIT 'EM BACK ONE OF 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S A CAR UH 
YEAH MY TOPIC SEGMENTER DOESN'T LIKE BLANK LINES THERE 
MM 
OH YEAH COOL 
YEAH ANOTHER UH SH ISSUE WAS THAT 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
OH YEAH 
HUH 
YEAH 
BUT YEAH 
YEAH 
SO YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GON 
DO YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TIME 
SO IT NOT SO IT NOT ONLY TWO DAYS ANYWAY 
YEAH THAT'D PROBABLY BE QUITE GOOD 
YEAH I'VE GOT A BASIC SEARCH WORKING NOW 
IT'S G IT'S GOT A USER INTERFACE 
SO YEAH 
NO 
UH I'M STILL IN MY DIRECTORY BUT I I CAN PUT IT IN YOUR DIRECTORY 
YEAH YEAH I'VE I'VE NOT BEEN USING THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH I'VE JUST BEEN TAKING THE THE CLASS FILES FROM YOUR DIRECTORY 
HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
NO NO YET 
YEAH THAT 
THAT COULD BE GOOD YEAH 
HMM 
OH 
HMM 
YEAH OR WE GONNA HAVE TIME TO MAKE IT DISPLAY LIKE A WHOLE ARCHIVE OF MEETINGS 
OR IS IT JUST GONNA BE DISPLAYING SINGLE MEETINGS AND YOU'LL HOLD UP DIFFERENT ONES 
HMM 
YEAH THE S AT THE MOMENT THE DIALOGUE I. D. IS JUST THEY START TO ZERO FOR EACH MEETING THEY DON'T RUN UM CONTINUOUSLY 
BUT YOU W YOU'D LIKE THEM TO RUN CONTINUOUSLY 
YEAH I CAN CHANGE THAT 
YEAH JUST TO CHANGE THE INDEX FILES AS WELL 
MM 
DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT A SEARCH IN SOON 
NO UH YEAH 
YES 
YEAH WELL WE'LL WORK ON IT YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
YES WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE EVALUATION NEXT WEEK 
YEAH WE COULD DO THAT 
YEAH I THINK THEY'RE IN THE N. L. S. S. D. WEB PAGE 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH PROBABLY AS LONG AS WE NEED 
BUT YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
HALF AN HOUR OR SOME 
YEAH HALF AN HOUR PROBABLY 
HMM 
YEAH I THINK 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH IT MAY BE A GOOD IDEA TO DO THAT 
COULD WE GUARANTEE THAT IT'D WORK 
HMM 
YEAH I'VE BEEN ABLE TO RUN IT WITHOUT YEAH 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I'M SURE HE'LL LET US UH TEST IT IT BEFORE WE DO IT 
YEAH DAVE SEE IN THE PROGRAMME MANAGER DO YOU HAVE A A METHOD TO LOOK SET THE CURRENT I. D. S IT'LL UPDATE THE DISPLAY 
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA NEED WHEN I'M UH LIKE GETTING SEARCH RESULTS 
HMM 
RIGHT 
YEAH WELL AS FAR AS I'VE GOT TO THE MOMENT I'VE MADE A RESULTS CLASS THAT'S GOT LIKE THE I. D. AND THE STUFF 
YEAH 
YEP 
I'M WELL I'M WORKING ON IT 
RIGHT 
I YEAH AND IT MIGHT NOT BE THERE 
I KNOW I WAS THINKING THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM 
HMM 
HMM 
YEAH 
W YOU COULD YOU COULD WHEN IT'S WHEN YOU'RE DOING A SEARCH 
YOU COULD JUST LIKE SORT OF ZOOM BACK TO SEE YOU GET THE FULL TEXT FOR THAT SEGMENT OR THAT MEETING RATHER THAN A SUMMARY 
'CAUSE THAT'S MAYBE WHAT YOU'D WANT IF YOU WERE A USER 
YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT OPTION 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE BUT I'M NOT HAVING CRASHES AT THE MOMENT 
SO WHAT I'M HAVING S SO WE WE HAD A WE HAD A LONG PROBLEM BUT NOT FINDING OUT WHY THE TIME SYNCHING UP BETWEEN THE RELATIVE TIME IN IN A IN A SORT OF IN A IN A SUMMARISED SECTION AND THE ABSOLUTE TIME DIDN'T CORRESPOND AND STUFF 
AND WE FIND IT WAS SOME STUPID WELL 
AT THE MOMENT OUR BEST GUESS SO THAT IT WAS SOME STUPID JAVA THING BUT IF YOU IF YOU ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE TWO OBJECTS AND YOU SAY OBJECT IF YOU SAY A. EQUALS B. 
THEY ACTUALLY REFERENCE TO THE SAME THING 
SO ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE IT IN OUR AIMED AT THE OTHER AND IF YOU DO THAT AROUND FIVE CORNERS 
YOU LOSE TRACK OF IT AND YOU SUDDENLY WONDER WHY THAT VALUE IS ZERO 
AND IT TURNS IT IT IS ZERO BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME THING THAT YOU ANYWAY UH SO WE FIGURED IT IT'S INTERESTING 
WHY DON'T I HAVE A SCREEN HERE NOW ACTUALLY THAT'S NEW BUT THAT'S OKAY 
IT'S DOING DIFFERENT THINGS ALL THE TIME 
LIKE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ACTUALLY THE BUT UH UH THAT SHOULD BE OKAY THAT SHOULD BE OKAY 
I'LL I'LL BE ABLE TO 
YEAH BUT LAST TIME I PRESSED THAT KEY COMBINATION EVERYTHING WENT WRONG AND I THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT JUST FIN IN THE SCREEN 
SO THAT'LL PROBABLY KEEP UM FROM POINTING ON MY SCREEN WHICH I USUALLY IT MIGHT JUST BE AT THIS POINT 
LIKE THERE'S SOMETIMES A POINT AT LOADING NOT USUALLY THAT LONG 
WELL LET'S SEE 
ANYWAY SO ON UH LET'S JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
IN THE END WE DID GET IT WORKING BEFORE 
UH SO I GOT YEAH 
YEAH 
UH SO NOW I'M HAVING A COMPLETE MESS OF LIKE SPLIT 
SPLIT SCREENS AND STUFF 
I THINK LAST TIME YES BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT IS IT 
SO BUT I THINK IF I THIS IS A LOGO OUT COMMAND AND USUALLY IT RESETS THIS AMAZING STRANGE COLOUR COMBINATIONS I SEE IN FRONT OF UM AT THE MOMENT 
YEAH WE SOMEHOW ALWAYS GET IT WORKING BUT IN DIFFERENT WAYS EVERY TIME 
UM 
SO THAT KEPT US LIKE BASICALLY FROM DOING ANYTHING ELSE PRODUCT QU FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN THE LAST DAYS BECAUSE WE WERE UM HUNTING DOWN THAT STUPID ERROR 
I GET IT FIXED ON THE LAST WHATEVER AN HOUR OR SOMETHING 
BUT IS TO THE MOMENT THE PROGRAM IS SORT OF IN BETWEEN WORKING AND NOT WORKING BECAUSE WE'VE DONE LOTS OF CHANGES TO WHAT THE ERROR WAS 
DAVE I THINK ACTUALLY THAT THE SUMMARY AT THE CURRENT MOMENT ISN'T WORKING A HUNDRED PERCENT CORRECT 
BUT THAT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE INPUT DATA 
IT SEEMS TO JUST TAKE THE FIRST UTTERANCES MORE OR LESS 
LIKE IF YOU IF YOU FIRST OF YOU READ THROUGH THE SUMMARIES THEY READ SUSPICIOUSLY FLUENT LIKE AS IN PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
AND THEN IF YOU PLOT THEM IN THE SCREEN WHERE WHERE THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT THEY SEEM TO O 
YES 
SO MAYBE THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM IS COMING FROM 
YEAH 
UM 
SO THIS IS WHEN YOU START SHIFTING AROUND YOUR LAPTOP TO THINK THAT IT GETS SOMEHOW LESS SLOPED ON THE SCREEN 
UM 
SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THIS MEETING IS ABOUT IT BE HONEST 
UM I'M I'M GONNA SHOW THIS JUST WHAT WE HAVE TO THE MOMENT BUT IT NOT GONNA LOOK VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAD LAST TIME 
DON'T ASK HIM WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PROMISE THAT YOU'LL GET YOUR SCRIPT WHERE YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN STUFF BECAUSE ACTUALLY THAT WAS SORT OF READY BUT THEN WE SORT STARTED TRYING TO GET SOMETHING MORE WORKING AND THEN WE GET INTO BIG PROBLEMS 
SO AT THE MOMENT I MEAN AGAIN WE SHOULD BE IT A STATE WHERE PEOPLE CAN LOAD THEIR OWN SC OKAY 
YEAH 
THING IS A AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST REALLY BAD FOR ME 
BUT FROM MONDAY ON I CAN JUST DO TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FOR THIS ONE UNTIL IT UNTIL IT'S D 
BUT UNTIL MONDAY IT'S GONNA BE REALLY BAD 
LIKE I CAN PROBABLY HELP PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH GETTING GETTING WHAT WE HAVE RUNNING NOW 
BUT 
OKAY 
SO I'LL JUST START IT UP WHAT WE HAVE NOW AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE AND STUFF 
HUH 
OK 
YEAH IT DOESN'T 
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE WHATEVER YOU GOT AND THEN JUST SEE HOW FAR THAT GETS YOU 
BUT WOULD THAT NOT HAPPEN AT SOME SORRY I'M JUM JUMPING IN 
WOULD THAT NOT HAPPEN AT SUMMARISATION ANYWAY EVEN IF THEY'RE IN THE W LIKE WITH THE ONES THAT HAVE NO WORDS AND THEN NOT HAVE REALLY LOW INFORMATION DENSITY OR SOMETHING 
HMM 
'CAUSE YOU'D RECKON THAT YOU COULD LEAVE THEM IN AND THEY WOULD NEVER SHOW UP IN A SUMMARY ANYWAY 
WE WOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT IF WE JUST WRITE THE PROGRAMME THE WAY THAT EVEN IN THE P WAY THAT IT DISPLAYS EVERYTHING IT STILL LEAVES THOSE OUT 
LIKE IF WE THIS A SPECIAL INFORMATION DENSITY I. D. OR IF YOU JUST PUT A SPE YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND THEN JUST MAKE SURE THAT SUMMARY EVEN IN THE ON THE MOST SUMMARISED MODE JUST NEVER PUTS THEM IN 
HMM 
'KAY SHALL WE TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE CURRENT SYS 
SORRY 
YEAH IT IS ACTUALLY 
IT IS IT IS JUMPING NOW 
SORRY 
YEAH IT DID IS IT DID SUMMARISE JUST NOW 
IT'S JUST IT'S SUMMARISING STUPIDLY BUT AT LEAST IT'S JUMPING 
SHALL 
YES AND IN FACT AT THE MOMENT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH OF THE TWO I'M SUMMARISING OVER 
DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE WE ARE WE AIM IS TO THE MOMENT THE CONFIGURATION IS THAT WORD IMPORTANCE FILE IS TEST THREE AND T. D. I. D. F. FILE IS TEST TWO 
I'VE JUST I'VE JUST SWITCHED THEM AROUND 
SO I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING AT THE MOMENT 
YEAH ESPECIALLY SINCE I'VE JUST ESPECIALLY S SINCE I'VE JUST SWITCHED THEM AROUND ANYWAY 
BUT THAT'S OKAY 
I BY THE WAY I READ A PAPER WHICH MAKES AN IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT COMBINING TWO THINGS OF THAT TYPE 
UM THAT'S BASICALLY IT'S IT'S IT GOING ON ABOUT THIS FANCY CALLED GEOMETRIC MEAN WHICH EFFECTIVELY JUST MEANS MULTIPLYING THEM 
BUT I I HAVE SOME GOOD OF INFORMATION ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS HOW YOU CAN SORT OF WEIGHT TWO DIFFERENT FACTORS 
BECAUSE IT'S UH LIKE IT IT'S FOR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR 
SOMEBODY WOULD TRY TO SOLVE A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM WHERE THEY ALSO HAD TWO FACTORS SORT OF AND THEY WANT TO WEIGH THEM TOGETHER 
AND THERE IS LIKE A GOOD JUSTIFIABLE REASON UM WHY WE SHOULD DO IN A CERTAIN WAY AND HOW WE CAN THEN WITH A SIMPLE PARAMETER ADJUST HOW MUCH ONE WEIGHS AND HOW MUCH THE OTHER WEIGHS 
SO THERE IS SOMETHING FOR JUST FOR PUTTING THEM TOGETHER ON A RELATIVELY SIMPLE WAY BUT STILL A WAY THAT WE CAN SORT OF JUSTIFY 
UM AND WE CAN QUOTE STUFF ON THAT 
YEAH SURE WE HMM 
NO IT'S MULTIPLYING THEM AND AND LIKE PUTTING THEM IN OVER THE POWER OF SOMETHING AND THE OTHER OVER MINUS ONE ONE MINUS THE POWER OF SOMETHING 
AND THAT'S SORT OF AND THEY THEY'VE PLOTTED SOME GRAPHS ABOUT LIKE WHERE THEY SHOW F LIKE IN GOING FROM ZERO TO THE ONE AND THE OTHER GOING ZERO TO ONE AND LIKE HOW THE HOW THE LANDSCAPE CHANGES AND HOW I THE PARAMETER CHANGES 
HOW IT WORKS 
SO IT'S QUITE GOOD 
UM SO THAT'S PROBABLY SEEING THAT WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GONNA GO INTO ANY WHATEVER BASE BLAH BLAH BLAH MARKOV MODEL BLAH BLAH BLAH ABOUT F COMBINING THEM 
UM THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT WE GO TO 
NOW THIS IS STILL NOT IDEAL AT THE MOMENT DAVE 
IT'S IT'S SORT OF IT'S OVERRUNNING THE F LIKE IT IS OKAY SO AT THE MOMENT WE'RE THAT FOR THAT IF I NOW CLICK ONTO A SEGMENT HITS 
YEAH IT'S JUST WAIT SORRY I JUST RE SIZED IT A BIT 
YEAH SO IT'S J LIKE THE VALUES ARE SORT OF HARD CODED FOR THE SCREEN SIZES IN DICE AND MY SCREEN'S SMALLER 
SO LET'S SEE I WAS A STUPID USER AND WAS CLICKING ON THIS SEGMENT 
WE PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE THE SEGMENT LINES A LOT BIGGER 
SO THEN I UH I DID I GOT A NEW SUMMARISATION 
YEAH I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SO 
SO LET ME CHECK A DIFFERENT ONE 
YEAH SO YOU SO IT'S A DIFFERENT TEXT 
AND YOU USE IT IT'S RUNNING THROUGH IT 
AND ALSO YOU USE THE INDICATOR IN WHERE WE ARE IS JUMPING 
SO IT'S IT'S SKIPPING STUFF 
NOW I DON'T THINK THE SUMMARY AT THE MOMENT IS WHAT WE WANTED TO BE USING THE WORDS LIKE UH AND MM AND EXACTLY EXACTLY RIGHT SURE 
THIS SEEMS PROBABLY SH THIS IS AGAIN PROBABLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE WANT 
SO IT'S PROBABLY SOME VALUE THAT YOU HAVE TO LIKE DIVIDE BY ONE UH ONE DIVIDE BY THE VALUE OF SOMETHING 
BUT 
YES BUT ALSO EVERY OTHER WORD IN THAT SENTENCE WE SHOULD LOOK AT ARE PROBABLY IN YOUR LIST OF FIFTY LIKE LIST OF ALL IMPORTANT WORDS IN THE UNIVERSE 
SO YES BUT IT'S PROBABLY JUST BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE 
LIKE THIS IS JUST THEIR BEST SENTENCE FOR LIKE HAVING FUNCTION WORDS IN A ROW SORT OF AND EVERY O OTHER I MEAN THIS ONE IS SORT OF THE DEVELOPING A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE 
SO MAYBE IT'S JUST DOING IT RANDOMLY AT THE MOMENT 
I DON'T KNOW 
BUT WE HAVE SOME SUMMARY WORKING AND THAT'S A GOOD BASIS TO START FROM 
IF I PROMISE NOW THAT YOU'LL GET SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN PUT YOUR OWN DATA AND THAT'S SORT OF RINGING A BIT HOLLOW 
YEAH 
YEAH UH STILL IT'S UH IT IT'S MIGHT BE HAVING SOME PROBLEM 
I THINK THIS ONE OVER RAN JUST BEFORE 
SO WE MIGHT STILL HAVE SOME PROBLEM HERE THAT IT'S NOT STOPPING AT THE END BUT SO DAVE 
CAN YOU MAKE THE PROMISE EVEN I'M NOT MAKING THE PROMISE REALISTICALLY THAT THE GIRLS WILL VERY SOON GET 
OKAY YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
SO SO AT THE MOMENT I'VE HARD CODED IT IT JUST UM TAKING ONE TENTH OF THE NUMBER OF UTTERANCES WHICH WERE IN THE ORIGINAL SELECTION 
YEAH 
IT ACTUALLY IT GIVES YOU AN ERROR IF YOU PUT IT TO TWENTY BECAUSE THERE'S SOME THINGS IN THERE WHICH ARE SHORTER THAN TWENTY 
AND IF YOU SELECT THOSE THEN IT'S HAVING ONE 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK LIKE A B A PROPORTIONAL ONE IS PROBABLY NOT BAD IDEA 
THAT'S BL I MEAN NO NO ABSOLUTE LENGTH IS SORT OF A BIT STRANGE BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT SOME UTTERANCES WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN LENGTH 
I KNOW BUT WE HAD THAT DISCUSSION BEFORE AND I'M CONFUSED MYSELF ABOUT WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT 
SO THE FACT THAT THIS IS GOING ON BEYOND THAT GREEN LINE HERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT IDEAL BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO SORT OUT 
BUT THIS IS WORKING IN GENERAL 
DOES ANYONE HAVE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OVER THE WHOLE TIME ISSUE LIKE SO ON WHAT DATA IS IT TODAY 
WHAT DATE DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS PRESENTED WHAT DAY OF THE WIKI IS THAT AND ISSUES LIKE THAT 
SO THE PRESENTATION SO NOW SH TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY 
'KAY 
ONE WEEK FROM TODAY I SHALL HEAR THE FREEDOM RING FROM THE HILLS AND AND EVERYTHING AND SHALL THEN THROW MYSELF INTO NEW SLAVERY 
OH 
NO REALLY 
AND THE REPORT 
WRITING THE REPORT WON'T BE SO BAD 
HOW LONG AS IT EXPECTED TO BE 
I KNOW ABOUT UH IF EVERYONE LIKE IF EVERYONE IS MANAGING THREE PAGES FOR THREE BUT THEN THAT'S GONNA BE THAT THAT'S A BUG REPORT THEN 
AND STUFF 
SO YEAH BUT EVALUATION 
OH 
YOU THINK 
WE SHOULD PROBABLY INQUIRE ABOUT THAT ARE LIKE INTEGRATE TOOL TIPS THAT WOULD BE VISIBLE 
HAVING SAID THAT DAVE WE COULD PROBABLY WE LIKE IF WE WANT 
WE COULD PROBABLY GO BACK TO THE C UM AT THE GROUP DIRECTORY AND JUST USE THIS TRICK 
IT REALLY SEEMS TO BE ALL ABOUT STARTING IN THE DIRECTORY 
BUT I MEAN IF IF THE TWO OF US ARE JUST WORKING ON IT IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE 'CAUSE I'VE ALREADY MOUNTED YOUR DIRECTORY NOW 
SO AND PROBABLY 
MM 
WHAT 
WELL IF IT'S JUST MULTIPLYING TO NUMBERS 
IT CAN BE DONE IN THE PROGRAMME 'CAUSE THEN WE CAN UM BECAUSE WHAT WE COULD DO IS HAVE A SLIDE BAR WHERE WE CAN ADJUST THIS VALUE 
ACTUALLY IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY LIKE HOW BASICALLY A GENERAL WAY BECAUSE THERE'S AT LEAST TWO POINTS AT WHICH WE ARE INTERESTED IN THAT 
HOW WE CAN JUST HAVE A SLIDE BAR WHICH WE CAN READ AND WRITE IT WHICH IS IN A FORM OF THAT TYPE 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
IT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT SHOULD IT 
I MEAN SHOULD JUST BE 
YEAH BUT IT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFI UH LET'S SEE IT YOU COULD IF YOU'RE LUCKY 
YOU PROBABLY HAVE JUST TO EXTEND THAT CLASS AND THEN YOU CAN WORK WITH THAT VALUE 
BUT IF YOU'RE UNLUCKY IT MIGHT BE QUICKER TO JUST WRITE A VERY SIMPLE STRING COMPONENT WHICH IS JUST THE IS JUST A BAR 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SO BECAUSE WE'D BASICALLY IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ONES TO PLAY AROUND WITH 
NO FOR CONTROLLING THE LENGTH OF THE SUMMARY AND ANOTHER ONE FOR 
UM FOR THE MERGING FACTOR IF WE DO IT THAT AWAY WITH THE CHI METRIC 
YEAH YEAH 
IT'S IT'S JUST A SINGLE FORMULA EFFECTIVELY YEAH 
UM HOW IS THE AUDIO THING GOING 
SO THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY NOT HAD TIME TO WORK ON THAT 
'KAY IT SEEMS THAT AT THE MOMENT A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT HAS TO BE DONE IT SORT OF AT THE MOMENT I'M SAYING OH DAVE 
CAN YOU DO THAT 
SO THAT'S NOT IDEAL 
OH 
OKAY 
'CAUSE I THINK I MEAN THE IDEA IS A V IN THE AND THE IDEA IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF IT 
JUST BECAUSE IT'S IT'S GONNA LOOK STUPID IF WE HAVE EVERYTHING WORKING BUT JUST F 
THE SPEECH TOOLS 
HMM 
SO THERE ANY WAY FOR X. FORWARDING SOUND 
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE SORT OF THE NICE WAY TO SIT AT HOME AND HAVE TO FORWARD THE SOUND AT THE LOWEST BIT RATE IT YOU 
I MEAN SEEING THAT IT'S OVER BROAD BAND IT'S FORWARDING THE GRAPHICS QUITE OKAY IT WOULD PROBABLY LIKE BROAD BAND WISE BAND WIDTH WISE PROBABLY WORK OUT 
BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT AND UH NOT A SIMPLE THING 
HMM 
YOU ARE YOU NOT CREATING FILES ANYWHERE LIKE SORT OF REAL FILES 
SO THAT YOU CAN DO IN A DICE MACHINE INDEPENDENT IF WE 
YEAH 
NO PROBLEM WITH S. S. H. ING IN GENERAL IS THAT THE MACHINE THAT LIKE IN THE ONLY GATEWAY MACHINES THEY HATE YOU FOR DOING ANYTHING ON THEM 
AND THERE'S NO SIMPLE WAY AT LEAST I HAVEN'T FOUND ON IT DIRECTLY ON ON A SINGLE STEP SORT OF S. S. H. AND THEN S. S. H. AGAIN 
WELL ACTUALLY I GUESS IF YOU PUT S. S. H. AND YOU KNOW C YOU CAN GIVE A COMMAND OUTRIGHT AFTER WITH S. S. H. 
SO IF THAT C COMMAND IS S. S. H. AGAIN AND IF YOU THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE ALL YOUR KEY FILES SET CORRECTLY 
WHICH I HAVEN'T BECAUSE IT ALWAYS FUCKS UP IN MY SYSTEM 
MAYBE IF YOU GET THAT WORKING THEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DIRECTLY GO INTO ANOTHER MACHINE 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
'CAUSE A P A PRIMITIVE VERSION OF THE SOUND TO HAVE RELATIVELY SOON WOULD BE GOOD 
I THINK 
OK OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY GOOD 
SO TO COME BACK TO THE PROBLEM WE HAD BEFORE 
SO THE REASON WHY THE SUMMARY DIDN'T WORK WELL IN THE LAST ONE AND WORKS WELL NOW IS BECAUSE BASED ON THE BOTTOM DATA THE DATA IS SO HOMOGENEOUSLY HIGH IN ITS IMP IMPORTANCE RATING THAT IT JUST SORT OF THEN 
EVERYTHING ELSE BEING EQUAL TO TAKE THE FIRST ONES MORE OR LESS 
BUT NOW IT'S WORKING BETTER BECAUSE NOW IT'S IN A MUCH MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED 
WELL 
THE MOST PROFESSIONAL WAY OF DOING IT WOULD BE TO MAP THEM ACCORDING TO THE STANDARD DEVIATION 'CAUSE THAT WAY IT AU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ALWAYS THAT'S SORT OF LIKE IT IT'S THE PROBLEM IS IT'S MORE CALCULATION EXPENSIVE AND SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATED EVEN THOUGH IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE IN TERMS OF CALCULATION IT'S NOT MUCH HEAVIER 
BUT LIKE YOU KNOW GENERALLY ABOUT STANDARD DEVIATION 
YEAH IT'S IT'S A G IT'S A VERY SIMPLE SIMPLE FORMU IT'S BASICALLY JUST WHATEVER THE AVERAGE OF OUR MAIN SQUARE DIFFERENCES FROM THE MENU OR SOMETHING 
WHICH THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT GENERALLY YOU FIRST HAVE TO GET THE MENU AND ONLY IT ONLY ONCE YOU HAVE THE MENU YOU KNOW WHAT 
NO NO GO 
YEAH I'VE DERIVED THAT I'VE DERIVED THAT MYSELF 
LIKE I DIDN'T FIND IT SO I DID IT MYSELF AND IT TOOK ME A DAY WITH THE FORMULA 
BUT THEN I'M SLOW AT MATHS 
SO THE THE GOOD THING ABOUT THAT WOULD BE THAT IF YOU SIMPLY SAY THAT WHATEVER 
ONE STANDARD DEVIATION BELOW THE MAIN IS ZERO AND ONE STANDARD DEVIATION ABOVE THE MAIN IS ONE OR TWO STANDARD DEVIATIONS OR SOMETHING 
THEN WHATEVER THE DATA IS LIKE IT WOULD ALWAYS NORMALISE 
YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT THE SIMPLEST 
BUT THAT LIKE THAT'S THE MOST PROFESSIONAL WAY I CAN THINK ABOUT IT 
YOU THAT WOULD INDIRECTLY ALSO DROP STUFF 
I MEAN THAT WOULD DROP WHATEVER IS BELOW OR ABOVE 
SO IF YOU FIND THAT FORMULA THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
OTHERWISE I CAN SEE IF I CAN STILL UNDERSTAND LIKE I DID IT IN MY PROGRAMME 
IT'S UH IT'S REALLY STUPID 
LIKE THE STANDARD STANDARD DEVIATION FORMULA JUST REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE THE MAIN INITIALLY 
AND THAT MAKES SOME THINGS EXACTLY TWICE AS COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE AND THERE IS A WAY OF DOING IT CUMULA CUMULATIVELY 
HMM 
SO YEAH SO THAT'S ONE POSSIBLE WAY OF DOING THAT 
SO THE 
AND THAT'S JUST IN THE LOADING STAGE RIGHT 
YEAH THAT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE FINE ESPECIALLY IN THE WORST CASE WE JUST INTRODUCE A SMALL HOUR GLASS 
BUT ANYWAY WE ONLY WE ONLY GONNA PRESENT THIS NICE AND WE CAN PROBABLY JUST LIKE SORT OF START IT UP BEFORE THE PRESENTATION STARTS 
SO IF WE SHOULDN'T AT ALL BE WORRIED ABOUT IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE BEAUTIFUL 
IT'S LIKE IF YOU B WANT A PROGRAMME ONLY TO RUN ONCE AND ONLY A PART OF IT 
YOU DON'T WORRY IF IT CRASHES AFTERWARDS IF IT WASTES ALL THE RESOURCES IF IT FORMATS THE HARD DISK IN THE END 
ANYWAY I'M RAMBLING ON 
UM 
NO IT DOES NOT IT DOES NOT IF YOU I CHANGED IT 
I JUST 
SO YOU WOULD FORGET THAT THAT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD START AT FIFTEEN TIMES OVER AND HAVE FIFTEEN ZOMBIES RUNNING 
UM 
DOES ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHICH DICE MACHINES HAVE SOUND CARDS AND HOW TO FIND THEM 
'CAUSE THE THING SO WE CAN LIKE THIS AT THE MOMENT WOR IS WORKING BECAUSE IT HAS A SOUND CARD 
THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S STRUCTURE OF THIS IT ISN'T ENOUGH TO JUST SAY WELL IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOUND CARD YOU DON'T HAVE SOUND 
AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S WHAT I REMEMBER OUR PROBLEM WAS THAT 
YEAH 
NO 
SO I'VE WORKED AROUND THAT THERE IS WAYS I THINK TO GET AROUND IT BUT THE PROBLEM IS 
SO YOU BE YOU BASICALLY WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO CODE VERSIONS THEN 
NO FOR SOUND CARD AND ONE FOR NON SOUND CARD MACHINES TO TEST IT IN 
UM BECAUSE IT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOUND CARD 
SO THERE ISN'T A SIMPLE WAY TO JUST TELL WHICH ONES THE SOUND CARD MACHINES ARE AND JUST TO USE SOUND CARD MACHINES SO THERE 
WE 
NO BUT I GUESS I MEAN IF YOU JUST IF YOU TRUST IN DAVE'S SUMMARY FOR THE IDEA 
JUST PUTTING ALL THESE THINGS INTO SOUND THAN THAN HAVING A WRITTEN SUMMARY 
YEAH YEAH 
SO THE YEAH 
YEAH 
SO I THINK DAVE REALLY THE EASIEST WAY SO IF YOU JUST MAKE A SOUND CARD AND A NON SOUND CARD VERSION OF IT 
BECAUSE 
YEAH BUT THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE GIRLS CAN'T TEST IT 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
LIKE 
YES BUT WITHOUT THE CLOCK YOU DON'T HAVE WELL ACTUALLY YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOESN'T LOOK IF IT DOESN'T STRICTLY HAVE TO DO ANY MOVEMENT IN IT YEAH 
YEAH BUT WE HAVE TO COMMENT STUFF OUT FOR THAT I THINK 
LOOK AT THE MOMENT IF YOU CLICK ON A SEGMENT IT AUTOMATICALLY SETS THE WHOLE CLOCK THING GOING AND STUFF 
SO WE HAVE TO COMMENT OUT STUFF 
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING THAT THERE IS WE COULD MAKE IT THAT A FLAG COULDN'T WE 
WE COULD JUST MAKE THAT UH LIKE A RUN TIME FLAG AND THEN MAKE A FEW IFS AND SAY IF 
YES THE UP THERE IS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO ANYWAY SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO NO NO WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE IT SEEMS JUST THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF DICE MACHINES DON'T HAVE SOUND CARD 
NO NOTHING C MUCH TO TALK ABOUT THIS 
SO APART FROM LIKE UH A SEARCH BOX AND THE SIMILARITY THING OF NICE THAT KICKS OFF 
W WHICH IS GONNA BE HORRIBLE BUT UM THIS IS MORE OR LESS IN THE END 
LIKE THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT OUR PRODUCT WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE END 
SEEING THAT REALISTICALLY WITH THE GIVEN TIME FRAME WE'RE NOT GONNA DO AMAZING NEW THINGS FROM NOW ON 
SO I MEAN WE'LL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO 
HUH 
LIST OF AGREEMENTS 
OKAY YEAH 
OKAY 
OH YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD DAVE'S RIGHT 
IT COULD BE GOOD IN THE DISPLAY TO ANNOTATE THEM IN THE DISPLAY IF WE CAN 
YEAH WE COULD JUST MAKE 
NOT JUST YET 
BUT THAT SHOULD THAT'S ACTUALLY THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY I CAN SAY I CAN DO THIS WEEK BECAUSE THAT SHOULD BE I MEAN I'LL DO IT IN AN INEFFICIENT WAY 
I'LL EFFECTIVELY SORT OF GO THROUGH ALL THE SEGMENTS AND CHECK IF THEY'RE CLICKED ON 
BUT I THINK DAVE WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS THAT THE UH THE TIME CLICK OF THE CLOCK I THINK THAT'S CHANGEABLE 
AND I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY INCREASE THAT 
BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S ZERO POINT IN SECONDS AND THAT'S JUST THERE IS ACTUALLY THERE ARE SOME BACKGROUND NOISE WHEN IT'S WORKING AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE DOING IS MUCH EVERY TIME 
YEAH IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU D I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE THE VERSION WHERE THE DISPLAY YET 
WHERE THE DISPLAY IS ACTUALLY UPDATING UP HERE WHEN IT'S MOVING ON 
SO I MEAN YES IT IS BECAUSE MY DISPLAY IS PROGRAMMED INEFFICIENTLY 
BUT I THINK WITH THE T GIVEN TIME CONSTRAINTS IT'S PROBABLY EASIER INSTEAD OF MAKING A VERY EFFICIENT DISPLAY CODE TO JUST MAKE THE TIME MAKE THE CLOCK WHATEVER 
ZERO POINT FIVE SECONDS OR SOMETHING 
DO YOU WANT THE MONITOR 
IF I CAN SKIP MORE ACCURATELY THAN 
OH YOU'RE 
THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S COMING FROM MY RESOLUTION AND IT'S YOU HAVE A MUCH HIGHER RESOLUTION 
SO 
AGAIN I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD PART IF WE HAD A SLIDE B UM BAR INITIALLY WHERE WE COULD DYNAMICALLY ADAPT THE THRESHOLD OF WHAT WE YEAH 
SO MAYBE IT'S JUST LIKE MAYBE BE IT'S JUST GOOD TO HAVE LIKE SOME GENERIC COMPONENT WITH THEIR SLIDE BARS OR SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN RELATIVELY EASILY ADD A FOURTH ONE OR SOMETHING 
YOU KNOW AND JUST LIKE SORT OF ALL OUR FIDDLE FACTORS 
UM BECAUSE 
UH WELL IT DEPENDS WE WE COULD LIKE IN SOME CASES WE COULD PUT IT IS A FEATURE AND SAY YOU KNOW YOU CAN DYNAMICALLY 
LIKE 
WE WOULDN'T CALL IT THRESHOLD WE WOULD SORT OF LIKE THE GRANULARITY OF DECISION OR SOMETHING LIKE IT 
SO AND YEAH AND VERY AND EVERYTHING ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD I COULD THEN ADD THE UTTERANCE WHERE IT OCCURS 
JUST PUT A CERTAIN GRAPHICAL ITEM LIKE A HANDSHAKE OR SOMETHING COOL 
YEAH RIGHT 
MM 
YES I WAS J IT I WAS JUST THINKING THE SAME LIKE IT'S IT'S SO TEMPTING 
LIKE WE WE'LL WE'LL HAVE YELLOW WE'LL HAVE YELLOW SMILIES AND YELLOW ANGRY FACES 
AH BEAUTIFUL 
DIDN'T SOMEBODY SAY THAT ACTUALLY LIKE A LOT OF AGREEMENTS HAVE HAVE ACTUAL WORDS WHICH SHOULD SUGGEST DISAGREEMENT LIKE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IF THEY'RE CORRESPONDING EA FOR EACH THING YEAH THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT 
SO FOR EACH UTTERANCE YOU HAVE AN AGREEMENT AND ONE DISAGREEMENT SCORE 
UH SOMETHING LIKE IT 
OKAY YEAH 
THE ONE WHERE WE CURRENT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU CAN IF YOU INTRODUCE UM LIKE A SORT OF A STATIC WHAT'S IT CALLED PUBLIC STATIC INT 
SO BASICALLY A CONSTANT LIKE THAT'S JAVA'S TYPE OF A CONSTANT AND GIVE THEM NAMES LIKE IS ZERO T. D. I. D. F. 
NO THAT PROBABLY MAKES THE CODE A LOT MORE READABLE FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S PLAYING AROUND WITH IT 
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
SO JUST LIKE WHATEVER THREE MEANS AGREEMENT VALUE AND THEN I'D JUST WRITE SOMETHING AGREEMENT 
AND THEN IT'S EASIER TO UNDERSTAND FOR BOTH OF US WHAT'S GOING ON 
HMM 
I WOULD ALSO THE YEAH BUT I WOULD ALSO THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD PUT THE THRESHOLD FOR THAT IN IN THE END QUITE HIGH ANYWAY 
SO PROBABLY IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE 
BECAUSE I THINK THIS THING 
NO BUT LIKE 
BUT I MEAN THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT ONES HAVE THE SAME NUMBER IN ITSELF ISN'T A PROBLEM IS IT 
SO IF IF FOR EVERY YEP YOU'D BE SURE THAT IT'S AN AGREEMENT THAN THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM 
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'RE NOT SURE IF EVERY YEP IS AN AGREEMENT OR 
HMM 
SO OVER OVER HOW MANY DIFFERENT OVER WHICH LENGTH IS THIS 
NOW THIS IS LIKE IS THE THIRD COLUMN IS THE UTTERANCE WHERE IT OCCURS RIGHT 
OKAY SO W I THINK WE REALLY DO HAVE TO PUT THE THRESHOLD QUITE QUITE HIGH THEN BECAUSE 
YES 'CAUSE IT I WAS JUST I WAS JUST CHECKING YOU KNOW LIKE HOW FAR APART ARE THEY 
AND AT THE MOMENT THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT A GOOD THING TO DISPLAY IF THEY'RE LIKE AN AVERAGE TEN TEN UTTERANCES APART OR SOMETHING 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AGAIN 
I'D SAY PROBABLY A GOOD WAY OF GOING ABOUT THAT QUESTION IS TO HAVE A CONTROL WHICH WE CAN VARY IN THE IDEAS AND THEN JUST SORT OF BECAUSE THAT'S IN THE AND HOW IT'S GONNA BE EVALUATED 
YOU KNOW IN THE END AT THIS IS GONNA LI I MEAN WE'RE GONNA PRESENT IT AND SAY YEAH SO THESE ARE IT SHOWS DISAGREEMENTS 
AND THEN WE SEE WHAT WHAT LOOKS GOOD AND WHAT LOOKS I THINK PROBABLY IT LOOKS CREDIBLE IF LIKE AN U IF EVERY SORT OF EVERY TOPIC SEGMENT HAS UM W YEAH 
OR LIKE OR LIKE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN THE OTHER AND AND FIVE AGREEMENTS BUT NOT MORE 
ARE PROBABLY MAYBE LESS BUT NOT MUCH LESS AND ACTUALLY THI I THINK THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN IN EVERYTHING 
NO YES BUT MAYBE IN AN EXPENSIVE WAY OR MAYBE IN A STUPID LOOKING WAY THOUGH 
UM 
YEAH D I'M YEAH I WAS JUST THINKING THAT IT CAN CUT IT CAN PROBABLY BE DONE ON DISPLAY LEVEL 
THIS ONE CRASHED 
MEAN JUST CRASHED I THINK WHICH IS BAD 
IT PROBABLY JUST TO KEPT IN PLAYING AND NOW REACHED SOME WHATEVER 
MY GOD 
YEAH 
I THINK SORT OF THE BOTTOM LINE AND WHICH MIGHT WILL END UP WHAT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE IS THAT WE TAKE THE SINGLE HIGHEST RANKED UTTERANCE AND PUT THAT IS A IT IS A TOTAL 
LIKE REALISTICALLY LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE THE TIME WE HAVE LEFT TO DO THIS AND STUFF 
THERE WE 
YEAH 
YEAH MAYBE EVEN IN A S IN A SING LIKE I SEE THAT IN A OR LIKE IS THAT IN A WORD BASIS WOULD THAT BE SINGLE WORDS 
OR WOULD THAT BE 
'CAUSE BE CHECK OUT WHAT THEY WOULD BE LIKE IN A WORD BASIS 
MAYBE ACTUALLY IF IT IF THERE'S ONE WORD WHICH IS VERY TYPICAL I MEAN IT'S PROBABLY SOME WORD LIKE UH 
BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE THE ONLY TIME THAT HE WAS SPELLED WITH THEIR A. AND STUFF 
I THINK THAT ACTUALLY THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM OF THE WHOLE UM ANNOTATION THAT IF THEY AREN'T EXACTLY CONSISTENT IN HOW THEY DESCRI UH TRANSCRIBE STUFF LIKE THAT 
THEN WE PROBABLY CAN'T YEAH 
'CAUSE THAT'S WHEN WE'RE THINKING SOMETIMES LIKE WHY IS MM HIGH 
BUT THEN PROBABLY IT'S THE ONLY TIME THAT MM WAS SPELLED WITH A DOT AT THE END AND STUFF 
SO BUT YEAH LIKE IF IF SINGLE W 
I C I HAVE DICTIONARIES 
IF IT'S JUST LIKE I HAVE ARBITRARILY LONG LISTS FROM THE BRITISH NATIONAL CORPUS OF WHEN IT USUALLY 
WELL LET'S SAY AT LEAST THEY DO IT UH CONSISTENTLY ENOUGH THAT I THINK YOU CAN FILTER THEM OUT FAIRLY WELL 
YEAH SO IF YOU F LIKE I MEAN IF THE SINGLE HA BEST ONE WORD FOR A FOR A SEGMENT IS INTERESTING THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD 
SEEM TO BE HAVING 
IS A RANDOM S 
'KAY WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS HERE NOW IT SUDDENLY CRASHES AND HANGS 
YEAH I MEAN THAT WAS THAT WAS SORT OF IN THE ORIGINAL OF THEN THE NICE FANCY DRAWINGS THAT WE GAVE STEVEN 
I MEAN THAT WAS PART OF IT THAT SORT OF WITHIN THE SEGMENT YOU HAD THIS SUB SEGMENTS AND EACH OF THEM HAD DIFFERENT WORDS AND WHATEVER HAPPENED TO OUR DREAMS 
ARE THERE ASSIGNMENTS 
NO I DON'T THINK WE HAVE 
YEAH 
HMM 
POOR MAN'S SOLUTION IS PROBABLY GONNA BE TO HAVE A A LIST 
UH IS JU YOU YOU ARE THINK OF LOADING THEM ALL AT ONCE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
EVEN THOUGH W 
'KAY 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK THAT LIKE THE DR THE DRAWING HAS TO BE CHANGED ANYWAY THE IT'S NOT IDEAL AT THE MOMENT 
UM YEAH SO IF PERFORMANCE WAS IT GENERALLY WORKS FINE FOR THE DISPLAY IT SHOULDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE 
'CAUSE I THINK EVERYTHING IN THE DISPLAY CODE IS JUST FROM THE FIRST UNTIL THE LAST ONE DISPLAYED 
SO IF IF THE OTHER PERFORMANCE IS OKAY THEN WE SHOULD REALLY JUST LOAD THE WHOLE THING ON 
I'M VERY IDEAS 
SO THAT PROBABLY JUST MEANS THAT THE DISPLAY SORT OF HAS AN INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT LEVEL OF ZOOM IT HAS 
SO INITIALLY THE DISPLAY 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S PROBABLY FAIRLY SIMPLE TO DO ACTUALLY IF WE DO IT IN THAT MOST PRIMITIVE WAY OF JUST SAYING AS LONG AS YOU DISPLAY MORE THAN ONE MEETING 
YEAH 
WE THEN AND SOME WAY OF GETTING BACK UP AGAIN IN THE HIERARCHY 
BUT THAT IN THE WORST CASE IT WILL JUST BE A STATIC SORT OF ARROW UP BUTTON ON THE RIGHT HAND TOPPER CORNER OF THE DISPLAY 
AND YOU PRESS THAT AND THEN YOU'RE IN THE DISPLAY THE WHOLE THING AGAIN 
BUT FOR THAT AT THE MOMENT MY DISPLAY CODE NEEDS THAT THING TO WORK THE ONE UH NO THAT'S WORKING AT THE MOMENT ANYWAY 
THE ON THAT I JUST SAY GIVE ME ONE HUNDRED VALUES OVER THAT LENGTH AND THEN YOU'RE INTERNALLY OKAY 
BUT YEAH BUT UH THAT'S OKAY SO LONG AS MY DISPLAY I WAS JUST THINKING MY DISPLAY CAN'T HANDLE DISPLAYING A MILLION DIFFERENT SEGMENTS 
BUT NOW OR NO BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO 
EVEN NOW IT DOESN'T HAVE TO 
OKAY WELL THAT'S ALL DETAILS 
UM SO DAVE CAN YOU JUST TURN THIS WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW ON 
YEAH 
MAKE 
UH AND IF ONE 
IF ANYONE FEELS THAT THEY HAVE FOR TIME UH THIS IS A JOKE 
UM ONE THING THAT WOULD BE CONVENIENT FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND WHICH I HAVEN'T FOUND OUT BUT IT IS HOW TO DO TOOL TIPS IN AN ARBITRARY WAY IN IN IN SWING GRAPHIC DISPLAYS 
NOW THERE IS SIMPLE WAYS OF DOING TOOL TIPS OVER A GIVEN ELEMENT LIKE IF YOU HAVE A BUTTON AND YOU JUST GIVE IT A TOOL TIP TEXT 
BUT THERE IS MEANS OF DOING TOOL TIPS THAT JUST I C I PUT MY MOUSE OVER 
LET'S SAY I PUT MY MOUSE OVER THIS LINE HERE AND THEN IT WOULD TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IT IS 
AND THAT WOULD BE QUITE CONVENIENT FOR A LOT OF THINGS BECAUSE THEN WE CAN SORT OF HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THE DISPLAY ON THE ON THE WAY THAT JUST WHEN THE MOUSE IS OVER IT 
BUT I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW IT WORKS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY SO IF EVERYONE IS EVER BORED OR ANYONE FEELS THAT THEY CAN DO THAT 
YES BUT 
YEAH BUT THE THE THING IS IT IT ISN'T SIMPLY AN ACT OF SETTING A STRING DEFAULT TOOL TIP 
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT A TOOL TIP OBJECT THAT YOU HAVE TO CREATE AND GIVE IT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PROPERTIES AND STUFF OR 
YEAH 
SO ANYWAY I HAVEN'T LOOKED MUCH INTO THAT 
SO IF IF ANYBODY LOOKS INTO THAT THEN LET ME KNOW 
OTHERWISE I'LL START LOOKING INTO IT AS SOON AS I HAVE TIME AGAIN 
BUT IF ANYBODY 
YEAH 
I FOUND SOME STUFF BUT IT IN THE WEB AND IT JUST LOOKED AT UM LIKE PROPER CODING 
LIKE I SAW HALF PAGE CODE SAMPLES WHICH EFFECTIVELY JUST DISPLAYED A TOOL TIP AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO THAT POINT TO GET DEEPER INTO THAT 
SO IF ANYBODY GETS ANY GOOD SAMPLES OF THAT NEVER 
ANYWAYS THAT IS THAT IT FOR NOW 
NO BUT I'M GONNA I'M GOING UP APPLETON TOWER NOW AND I HAVE MY EXTERNAL HARD DISK 
SO I CAN 
YEAH 
SO THERE ANY DICE MACHINES IN THIS BUILDING 
FREELY ACCESSIBLE FOR ME 
CAN YOU SHOW ME WHERE BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO APPLETON TOWER AT THE MOMENT 
SO THEN I DON'T HAVE TO GO UP AND DOWN 
ACTUALLY NO BUT I HAVE TO GO THERE ANYWAY AND PUT A PIECE OF PAPER ON TWO MACHINES WHERE SOME STUFF OF MINE IS RUNNING ON 
YEAH AND I THINK LIKE I'LL JUST I'LL JUST KICK IN FULL TIME FOR N. L. S. S. D. NEXT WEEK 'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING I HAVE TO DO THEN 
APART FROM COGNITIVE MODELLING WHICH I THINK I'LL JUST DO IN FIVE HOURS THREE HOURS 
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT 
HMM 
I MIGHT JUST NOT GO FOR THE LAST QUESTION BECAUSE USUALLY THE LAST QUESTION IS TAKES HALF THE TIME AND GIVES YOU FIVE PERCENT OR SOMETHING LIKE OKAY 
REALLY 
OKAY 
NO MAYBE HE HAS MENTIONED IT TO THEM BUT THEY JUST NEVER TALKED TO USE 
I MEAN WE DIDN'T TALK TO THEM 
SO 
IT'S SORT OF COMING AS A SHOCK TO ME NOW BECAUSE I WAS SORT OF IN THIS MINDSET 
LIKE I FIRST KNEW OH THERE'S A LOT OF TIME BETWEEN THE PRESENTATION AND THE REPORT 
AND THEN I KNOW UH NOW THE PRESENTATION IS SHIFTED 
BUT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THESE TWO FACTS THE INTERDEPENDENCIES THERE'S SOME FANCY PLANNING LANGUAGE ABOUT THAT 
BUT THAT 
YES IT'S UM IT'S PROBABLY SOME VERSION OF THE FRAME PROBLEM 
FRAME PLOB PROBLEM 
HASN'T BEEN CLEAR TO ME 
WELL I RECKON THAT IT 
I RECKON THAT PROBAB 
BUT IF YOU JUST PRESENT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE THING IF YOU'RE NOT LIKE I DON'T THINK THIS PRESENTATION IS ABOUT THE INTERNAL WORKING 
SO YEAH 
SO FOR A DEMO I THINK REALISTICALLY SINCE EVERYTHING IN THIS UNIVERSITY SORT OF WORKS ON AN HOUR SLOTS AND STUFF 
SO IF IT'S TWO GROUPS THEN IT PROBABLY IT'S GONNA BE ROUGHLY HALF AN HOUR ISH 
HMM 
NO WHY IS THE THIS IS GONNA BE SO BAD 
LIKE THERE'S GONNA BE SOME SMALL L 
YEAH BUT THE PERFORMANCE IS REALLY BAD AT THE MOMENT ON THAT ONE THOUGH 
PLUS WE WOULD HAVE TO GET THE SPEECH TOOLS RUNNING ON MY LAPTOP THEN WOULDN'T WE 
MM 
WELL LET'S LET'S SEE 
DID IT IT COULD JUST BE FLUENT ON THE LAPTOP FOR ALL I KNOW 
I MEAN LIKE TO THE MOMENT IT'S NOT TOO BAD APART FROM I THINK THE SOUND IS STUTTERING AND THAT'S B I THINK BECAUSE OF THE LAPTOP 
BUT WE CAN ONLY REALLY JUDGE THAT ONCE WE HAVE SOUND FILES 
HOW FAST AS YOURS VERA 
MM-HMM 
WELL NOT WOULD RUN ON ANYTHING 
BUT 
YES 
NO THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
VIRTUAL MACHINE SHOULD BE FINE 
BUT BUT BUT THAT ALL RELIES ON FINDING SOME WAY OF GETTING THE SPEECH TOOLS TO DO THEIR JOB 
YEAH SO THAT'S 'CAUSE THAT'S THE THING LIKE THAT WOULD RELY ON I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO RUN THE SPEECH TOOLS ON 
NO NO NO NO D WHEREVER THIS IS GOING TO DOESN'T SOUND GOOD 
UM 
WE CAN UH CAN USE MY LAPTOP IS SORT OF LIKE AS A AS A SERVER AS A SOUND SERVER 
BUT THAT WOULD STILL MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO GET THE SPEECH TOOLS RUNNING ON THIS 
NO YOU KNOW I THINK I MEAN THE WAY JAVA WORKS IS THAT IT 
I THINK IT'LL RUN ON ON THEIR DICE MACHINE IF WE'RE DOING IT IN IF WE WILL WE SHOULD DEFINITELY TEST TO THE DAY BEFORE 
YEAH 
'KAY 
SO DAVE ARE YOU GONNA MAKE SOMETHING PRIMITIVE THAT PEOPLE CAN LOAD THEIR DATA ON 
OK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'M NOT I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TO MAKE IT WORK WITH THE TO MAKE IT NOT CRASH IF IT DOESN'T HAVE A SOUND CARD 
THERE'S THERE'S QUITE A BIT YOU HAVE TO COMMENT OUT FOR THAT WHICH IS STUPID BECAUSE I 
YEAH TH YEAH 
NO BUT THE THING IS THE DISPLAY CALLS METHODS WHICH PROBABLY EXPECT SOME SO I THINK OF THE DISPLAY ITSELF ISN'T DOING ANYTHING CLOCKY 
SO AS LONG AS IN THE MAIN PR IN THE PROGRAMME MANAGER EVERYTHING CLOCKY IS IS REMOVED 
BUT UH I W IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE TO CHECK HOW MUCH WORK IT WOULD BE TO DO IT OVER A FLAG 
'CAUSE THEN ON THE AND I 'CAUSE OTHERWISE WE ALWAYS HAVE TWO CODE VERSIONS AND PEOPLE MIGHT BE CHANGING THE WRONG ONE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
I JUST I KNOW THAT LIKE IF YOU DON'T DO IT WITH THE EXCEPTIONS CRASHES 
THAT'S WHAT FIGURED OUT 
LIKE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOUND CARD IT CRASHES EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE SOUND 
YEAH OKAY COOL 
UH I THINK THE DISPLAY HAS SOME METHOD FOR IT 
I'M NOT ACTUALLY LOOK FOR THE PROGRAMME MANAGER THEN TO CALL 
I'M NOT ACTUALLY A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED ABOUT THE DISPLAY HAS SOME METHOD WHERE YOU TELL IT WHERE TO START AND WHERE IT AND 
YEAH OR THERE'S GONNA BE SOMETHING 
WELL ACTUALLY DAVE DA DAVE DAVE DAVE 
OKAY 
NO SORRY I'VE UH I WAS WRONG I WAS THINKING IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN WE SAY SET SELECT ON IT DOES NOT 
BUT ACTUALLY A SET SELECTION DOES EVERYTHING YOU WANT SORT OF 
NO BUT SET SELECTION DOESN'T UPDATE THE DISPLAY THOUGH 
BECAUSE WELL IT IT DOESN'T TELL THE DISPLAY WHICH PART TO DO WHICH PART TO TO DISPLAY BECAUSE THE DISPLAY HAS JUST CALLED SET SELECTION IT 
IF 
YEAH BUT THAT ONLY WORKS THAT AT THE MOMENT ISN'T DONE THROUGH OUR SYSTEM THAT'S JUST DONE BECAUSE THEN THE TIME CHANGES 
SO ACTUALLY A TIME CHANGE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY PUT THE POSITION OF THE DISPLAY ON THE RIGHT PLAY 
OH NO BUT THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THAT COULD WILL BE OUTSIDE THE DISPLAYED AREA THEN 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
NO I THINK THE DISPLAY HAS A METHOD FOR THAT READY WHICH IS CALLED 
ANYWAY THE DISPLAY HAS SOMETHING USEFUL FOR THAT 
SOMETHING WHICH PROBABLY STARTS WITH THE WORD SET 
YEAH YOU CAN SIT THE WINDOW START UTTERANCE AND WINDOW END UTTERANCE 
HMM 
ALTERNATIVELY THERE'S ALWAYS THE METHOD OF JUST GIVING IT A REALLY HIGH SCORE 
IS A HACK YOU KNOW LIKE JUST AS LONG AS YOU THEN DON'T WELL PROBABLY PEOPLE WOULDN'T KNOW 
HMM 
WELL YOU COULD YOU COULD PUT ONE POINT IN WHEN THE OTHER ONES ONLY GO UP TO THE ONE 
BUT NO IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A NICE WAY I'M JUST SAYING 
YEAH PROBABLY THAT ACTUALLY TRUE THAT IF YOU'RE DOING A SEARCH YOU'RE USUALLY NOT INTERESTED IN A CONDENSED WAY BUT IN THE ON THE FULL THING ANYWAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK PROPORTION LIKE I EVEN THOUGH I'M I'M ALWAYS GETTING MYSELF CONFUSED ABOUT THIS BUT I THINK SORT OF MAKING THE SUMMARY LENGTH THING GENERALLY PROPORTION 
LIKE AS A AS A PROPORTIONAL FACTOR OF OF ITS ORIGINAL LENGTH IS A GOOD WAY OF GOING ABOUT IT 
BECAUSE ANYTHING WITH ABSOLUTE LENGTH'S SORT OF STUPID BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT A LONG LONG SEGMENT GETS TO ONE PERCENT OF ITS LENGTH AND ANOTHER ONE GETS TO EXACTLY THE SAME LENGTH AND STUFF 
SO IF WE'RE DOING IT BY A PROPORTION THEN JUST HAVING ONE POINT ZERO OR SOMETHING MAKES IT VERY EASY TO ALWAYS END UP TO THE ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT I'VE CURRENTLY LIKE THE CURRENT CODE JUST TAKES A TENTH OF THE SUMMARY LENGTH 
SO YEAH 
AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF SLIDER THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY LIVE IN AND LIKE SHOW 'CAUSE THAT'S THAT'S FUNCTIONALITY 
YEAH THAT'S SORT OF LIKE YOUR LEVEL OF THE ZOOM 
OF IMPENDING DOOM 
SHALL WE QUIT HERE 
ANYTHING TO BE DISCUSSED 
'CAUSE I'M GONNA COPY THAT STUFF OVER 
YEAH OTHERWISE YOU'LL YOU'LL DEFINITELY IS UM IN M. S. N. 
SO I'LL JUST 
CAN YOU JUST REMIND ME I DON'T HAVE TO TICK THE ONE ONE KEY THING UNTIL I FINISH WRITING 
BUT IT'S ONLY IF I GO BACK TO IT I TICK OKAY AGAIN 
MM 
YEP 
SO IF I'M WORKING O IF I'VE DONE A PAGE 'EM IN THE SECOND PAGE 
I TICK IT IS UM I FINISH THAT PAGE AND I GO BACK TO THIS I CAN JUST WRITE AND THEN NOT TICK UNTIL I FINISH WRITING AGAIN 
YEAH SO IT'S ALWAYS AFTER ONE YOU NEVER HAVE TO IT BEFORE 
FINE 
FINE 
AND YOU CAN GO ON BOTH SIDES AS WELL 
OKAY 
WELL I THINK THE FIRST THING IS 
WELL THE FIRST THING I THINK SO WE NEED TO UH SORT OUT THE CALL FOR ABSTRACTS OR THE C THE CALL FOR TITLES 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S KIND OF OVERDUE 
YEAH 
UM SO I VOLUNTEER TO DO THAT IF YOU LOOK 
UM OH OKAY 
SO 
AND I'LL DO THAT 
BY TRYING TO THINK WHAT IS IT THURSDAY TODAY I'LL DO I'LL DO THAT BY THE END OF THE WIKI ANYWAY 
SO 
YEAH WE'RE GONNA DO THAT BUT I THINK WE SHOULD IS PROBABLY SEND IT UM SEPARATE CALLS OKAY 
SO WE'LL SEND AN BUT WEREN'T MEN I MEAN WE COULD MENTION THE FACT THAT WE'RE INVITING OTHER PEOPLE 
BUT I THINK IT WILL PROBABLY JUST UH I MEAN IT PROBABLY WON'T MATTER TOO MUCH TO THE OTHER LINGUISTS THAT WE'RE HAVING THREE PEOPLE THERE 
WE CAN MENTION IT BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE TOO ESSENTIAL AND UH WE MIGHT ACTUALLY JUST END UP MAKING THEM WORRY THAT 
YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR PLACE OR WHATEVER BECAUSE UH I DON'T KNOW 
BUT WE DO WE DO HAVE TO DECIDE A PRIORITY THING SO THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN LOOK AT UM A LITTLE BIT 
LATER DOWN THE LINE 
SO SO THAT'S THE ONE FOR LING BASICALLY AND I'LL SEND THAT IT 
I'LL DO THAT TODAY OR TOMORROW 
UM NOW CLAIRE THAT'S THE OTHER THING SHE CAN DEAL WITH THE PSYCHOLOGY 
UM 
PSYCHOLOGY PEOPLE PROBABLY THAT'S I RECKON IT'S THE BEST THING TO DO 
'CAUSE SHE'LL KNOW WHICH EMAIL ADDRESS TO USE AND AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
SO UM 
IF ONE OF US COULD EMAIL CLAIRE 
OKAY YEAH SO IF ROBERT 
SO I IF ROBERT EMAILS CLAIRE AND WE'RE N GONNA NEED TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S GONNA SAY IN THERE 
UM 
WE MIGHT NEED TO JUST REMIND HER OF THE DATES IN CASE SHE DOESN'T KNOW SO SHE GETS THE DATES RIGHT 
UM 
AND UH UM SHE'S I KNOW SHE ALREADY KNOWS THAT IT'S JUST ANYONE DOING PSYCHO LINGUISTICS BASICALLY 
SO THAT'S FINE 
YEAH EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
UM 
BUT THEN THERE'S THE REST OF P. P. L. S. AND I THINK WE NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER 
I THINK SHE SHOULD JUST I THINK SHE SHOULD JUST WRITE HER OWN 
PROBABLY 
AND 
OKAY 
SO WHAT WE'LL DO I MEAN THE THING IS THE THE MAIN CALL WILL GO OUT BEFORE SHE'S GOT AROUND IT IT ANYWAY 
SO WHAT I'LL DO SO I'LL COPY IT 
I'LL C. C. HERE IN THE UM 
NO THEY WON'T BE 
I JUST THE THE ONLY THING I'M THINKING SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT STANDS OUT IS SOMETHING APPLICABLE TO THEM 
THAT THEY DON'T GO UH WE'RE JUST GETTING RUBBISH FROM YOU YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
I WANT THEM TO REALLY KNOW THAT IT'S ADDRESSED TO THEM 
UM AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT CLAIRE SENDING IT IS SHE'S PROBABLY GET A PSYCH EMAIL ADDRESS AS WELL AND IT IT MIGHT LIKE A BIT MORE RELEVANT TO THEM 
YEAH EXACTLY 
THEY KNOW HER ET CETERA 
UM SO YEAH SO IF IF WE'VE SO IF I'VE C. C. ED THE ORIGINAL ONE THEN YOU CAN TELL HER THAT THAT CAN BE THE BASIS FOR 
UM THE BASIS FOR HER EMAIL ABOUT JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW IT'S RELEVANT TO THEM ET CETERA 
UM AND OBVIOUSLY IN P. P. L. S. WE'VE ALSO GOT ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
NOW 
IN A WAY WE COULD SEND OUT THAT FIRST CALL IT THEM JUST AS PART OF THE SAME EMAIL 
BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO THINK IT WAS RELEVANT TO THEM 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
BUT UM I THINK WE DEFINITELY SHOULD OPEN IT UP TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
UM I THINK PARTICULARLY AT THE MOMENT 'CAUSE THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO SORT OF UH MERGE US INTO ONE SUBJECT AREA 
EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULD BE MEANINGLESS BECAUSE WE'RE ALL PART OF A SCHOOL I THINK THAT IT DOES ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD INVITE THEM BUT THEN WE'VE STILL GET THE PROBLEM OF UH A PRIORITY ISSUE 
SO YOU KNOW PROBABLY WHAT I WAS THINKING IS UM CERTAINLY SECOND AND THIRD YEARS ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE UH TOP ON TOP PRIORITY 
BUT THEN THERE'S A KIND OF AWKWARD QUESTION OF WHERE WE PUT FIRST YEARS BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO 
IF THEY WANT IT SHOULD THEY HAVE PRIORITY 
THIS IS A KIND OF LOWER POINT ABOUT UH IT KIND OF IT CROSSES OVER WITH DECIDING 
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WHEN WE UH 
WELL 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
IT'S THREE DAYS 
RIGHT 
THE UH UH THEY WERE TWENTY TWENTY MINUTE TALKS WITH TEN MINUTE UH QUESTION TIME OKAY 
AND YOU CAN RUN TWO IN A ROW BUT PROBABLY NOT UP TO THREE 
TWO WHAT DO YOU THINK TWO IN A ROW OR THREE IN A ROW 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I MEAN THE THING IS EVERY TIME WE HAVE A BREAK THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER WE ACTUALLY SERVE COFFEE AND BISCUITS AND THINGS 
BECAUSE THAT'S THE KINDA NORMAL THING TO DO 
SO ARE YOU SAYING HAVE SAY THREE SESSIONS IN A ROW AND THEN DO THAT TWICE IN THE MORNING AND TWICE IN THE AFTERNOON 
SO THAT'D BE SIX HOURS 
UH IS JUST HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF IN THE MORNING 
'CAUSE I MEAN WOULD SIX HOURS A DAY BE PUSHING IT 
NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE I MEAN THE GOOD THINK SO NO 
WELL I SUPPOSE WHAT WE CAN DO IS THINK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE NOW AND SAY RIGHT WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM WE CAN DO 
SO I THINK THAT'S ABOUT AS MUCH AS WE COULD DO TO HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF THEN HAVE A COFFEE BREAK 
THEN HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF THEN HAVE LUNCH HOUR AND A HALF COFFEE BREAK HOUR AND A HALF 
AND SO THAT WOULD BE EIGHTEEN HOURS OF TALKS OVERALL WOULDN'T IT 
BUT WHAT DO WE SAY 
SO IT'S THE SO IT'S TWELVE THIRTY SIX TALKS IS THAT RIGHT 
MAXIMUM THIRTY SIX 
UM 
OKAY LET'S JUST PUT THIS DOWN 
OH 
WELL I COULD LIKE 'CAUSE I I'VE GOT THAT THERE'S THE LAST ISN'T THREE OF POST GRADUATES I MAINTAIN IN IN LINGUISTICS 
UM THERE ARE PROBABLY ABOUT THIRTY ONE THERE 
UM BUT A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM OR FIRST YEARS AND I DON'T KNOW I MEAN JUST TO GET AN IDEA OR YOU PLANNING ON TALKING 
NO 
OR YOU PLANNING ROBERT 
AND I'M PROBABLY NOT 
SO THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT ALMOST NONE OF THE FIRST YEARS ARE GONNA VOLUNTEER 
UM SO 
IF WE HAD SAY TWENTY LINGUISTICS AND EVEN THEN 
I MEAN THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE ABROAD AND WHO WON'T BOTHER TO TURN UP OR CAN'T MAKE IT OR WHATEVER 
SO YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE THAT WE ONLY GOT SAY FIFTEEN ANYWAY 
AND THEN WE COULD BE LEFT WITH UH FIFTEEN BLOCKS FOR UM THE REST OF P. P. L. S. 
SO AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT THAT WE'VE GOT AN ABSOLUTE LIMIT OF ABOUT THIRTY SIX TALKS YEAH 
UM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT UH THE COFFEE BREAKS WILL BE FOR AND MAYBE LUNCHTIMES 
BUT COFFEE BREAKS ARE PROBABLY MORE LIKE AB OR ARE GONNA BE A BETTER TIME 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL HANG AROUND WHEREAS PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO OFF SOMEWHERE FOR LUNCH AREN'T THEY 
OKAY 
MM 
SO UH HOW LONG SHOULD A POSTER SESSION BE 
LIKE HOW LONG WILL PEOPLE WANT TO MILL AROUND FOR LOOKING AT 
OKAY 
SO THAT MEANS WE COULD HAVE THIRTY TALKS 
PLEASE 
UH AN I. M. OR P. M. OF POSTERS 
YEAH 
AND WE COULD PROBABLY GET QUITE A FEW IN THERE AT LEAST SIX ANYWAY 
AT LEAST SIX POSTERS IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
DURING THE SESSION LIKE HOW MANY CAN YOU HAVE GOING ON IT NICE 
WELL SPACE AND 
FIRST YEARS 
NO 
I'VE BEEN TO DURHAM UH POST GRADUATE CONFERENCE AND I MEAN EVERY CONFERENCE I'VE EVER BEEN IT 
THE POSTERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE COFFEE BREAK WHICH IS WHY PROBABLY BECAUSE NORMALLY THEY'RE LIMITED IN SPACE AND THEY 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK KEEPING IT 
UM ALONG SIDE THE CONFERENCE IS POSSIBLY ONE WAY OF MAINTAINING INTEREST AND 
AND UH 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY THE IDEA I THINK THE BEST IDEA 
I CAN IMAGINE IT WOULD SEEM A BIT RANDOM JUST HAVE LIKE A POSTER SESSION AND BES UH YEAH JUST HAVE A P A POSTER SESSION UM 
WHAT WOULD TO BE AT THE BEGINNING 
SO I SUPPOSE IT IS IT NORMALLY UH SECOND YEARS DO IT LIKE JUST AFTER THEY'VE COME BACK FOR THE S 
THE 
THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD BE I THINK 
IT 
YEAH BUT I D I DON'T THINK UH MEANS THAT IT WOULD BE 
THE FIRST YEARS WHO'VE ONLY JUST ARRIVED WOULD DO A POSTER 
THAT WOULD BE A BIT ODD WOULDN'T IT 
OKAY SO AT LEAST ANYONE WHO'S FEELING YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH I I MIGHT DO I D I STILL THE I'M LITTLE BIT DOUBTFUL 
BUT UM SO THAT'S GOOD ANYWAY 
SO 
WE'VE GOT AN IDEA 
I THINK THERE'S THIRTY TALKS AND AND SAY SIX TEN POSTERS WHATEVER WE CAN MANAGE TO FIT IN THE ROOM 
UM SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHERE WE'RE GONNA HO HOLD IT 
WE COULD HAVE IT ON B. NINE BUT THERE'S THINGS ALL OVER THE WELL 
THERE ARE THOSE PICTURES THAT RUN ALL THE WAY AROUND SO CAN WE TAKE THE PICTURES DOWN 
CAN WE USE B. NINE FOR THE POSTERS FOR INSTANCE 
OKAY SO POSTER BOARDS 
AND WHO UH UM WHAT I'LL DO I'LL EMAIL MITS ABOUT THAT OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL WHAT WE'LL DO IS SO WE CAN JUST SAY UH IF YOU WANT TO DO A TALK 
THEN JUST SAY SO AND IF YOU WANT TO DO A POSTER THEN SAY YOU WANT TO DO A POSTER 
AND WE CAN SORT OF BASE IT AROUND THAT 
AND IF WE GET ABSOLUTELY TONS OF PEOPLE WANTING TO DO POSTERS AND WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A YOU KNOW 
EVERYONE'S KIND OF DONE IT IS A COP OUT THEN WE MIGHT HAVE TO SORT OF EASY TO THEM WELL YOU KNOW 
WOULD YOU CONSIDER DOING A TALK INSTEAD BECAUSE UH PARTICULARLY THE SECOND AND THIRD YEARS 
BECAUSE WE NEED MORE TALKS AND JUST YOU KNOW DO IT LIKE THAT 
UM WE COULD EVEN SAY SOMETHING LIKE UM YOU KNOW 
FIRST YEARS MIGHT WANT TO GIVE A POSTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THAT'S A BAD IDEA BUT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY SO WE GOT SOME SORT OF IDEA OF 
THE STRUCTURE AND HOW MANY TALKS WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE 
I MEAN WE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO I'VE UH OKAY SO ENGLISH LANGUAGE UM WE'LL PUT IN THE MAIN CALL 
AND I'LL JUST I I'LL JUST KINDA MARKET IT IS AN LINGUISTICS AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK 
YES AND INFORMATICS WE COULD THINK ABOUT IT AS WELL 
SO I HAD A LOOK 
AT WHETHER THEY DO PHILOSOPHY OF A LANGUAGE AND LOGIC AND STUFF HERE AND THEY KIND OF IDEA 
THERE'S BUT THERE'S BUT THERE ARE FOR UH FULL TIME MEMBERS OF STUFF THAT LAST UM PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE IS A MAJOR INTEREST 
SO CHANCES ARE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE SOME P. H. D. STUDENTS THAT UH ARE INTERESTED 
SO 
DO WE THINK WE SHOULD INVITE THEM 
I THINK I'D BE SURPRISED IF WE GOT SORT OF FOUR OUT OF THEM 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE 
AMAZING IF WE DID 
SO I THINK IT'S PROBABLY WORTH I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA GET INUNDATED WITH REQUESTS 
SO I THINK IT'S WORTH ASKING THEM 
YEAH 
I MEAN I THINK THE INFORMATICS ARE DEFINITELY WORTH ASKING 
UH TH THERE'S THERE'S C. S. T. R. AND UM H. C. R. C. 
YES 
IT IS 
YEAH IT IS 
IT 
YEAH WELL IT WOULD BE NICE TO THAT 
IT WOULD BE NICE IT WOULD BE NICE TO DO IT 
THE THING SO WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BIAS IT TOWARDS ANY PARTICULAR KIND OF LINGUISTICS IN A SENSE 
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR DEPARTMENT IS THEN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SORT OF EMBRACE ALL KINDS 
IN FACT EVEN BY INVITING UM PEOPLE FROM UM INFORMATICS AND FROM OR MAYBE FROM PHILOSOPHY AND THINGS IT MIGHT BIAS IT IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION 
BUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S PROBABLY NOT TOO BAD 
I I THINK THAT I THINK THAT BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY INFORMATICS AND UM PSYCHOLOGY YOU'VE PROBABLY GET QUITE A LOT OF BREADTH THERE ANYWAY 
UM THE THING IS 
UH THE ONE THING IS THE ONLY KIND OF PEOPLE DOING ANYTHING LIKE APPLIED LINGUISTICS ARE THE APPLIED LINGUISTS THEMSELVES AND PEOPLE IN SOCIOLOGY WITH AN INTEREST IN LANGUAGE 
AND I DON'T THINK WE'D BE INVITING THEM 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE THE FIRST THING IS THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR INVITING EVERYONE IN P. P. L. S. BECAUSE WE ARE IN ONE SCHOOL 
AND THEN THE FACT THAT WE ALSO INVITE PEOPLE FROM THE INFORMATICS I SUPPOSE IT'S JUST THAT WE DO HAVE PRETTY STRONG TIES WITH THEM 
AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD BE TOO OFFENDED 
I HOPE NOT ANYWAY 
UM 
SO YEAH 
SO WHAT KIND OF PROVISOR CAN WE PUT IN 
I MEAN WE COULD 
WE COULD JUST SAY OUTRIGHT ANYONE IN THEIR THIRD YEAR OR ANYONE IN THEIR SECOND OR THIRD YEAR 
BUT I DON'T KNOW 
ARE WE CAN JUST YOU KNOW IT UH TAKE WHATEVER WE GOT AND PICK THE BEST BETWEEN US WHICH IS 
Y YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
SO YOU'RE GOING TO EMAIL CLAIRE 
UM 
SO WHO WANTS TO SEND SOMETHING TO TO INFORMATICS 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH SURE 
UM SO 
YEAH SO WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY IS ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GIVE A TALK ON LOGIC OR PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 
UM BUT PUT A WARNING THAT IF IT'S LOGIC THEN THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT ONE ONE WILL UNDERSTAND OR NOT THAT MANY 
I MEAN MAYBE JUST MAYBE IF YOU JUST PUT 
YEAH JUST PUT PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 
THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY GOOD 
OR JUST OR ANY PH 
YEP 
YEAH THAT'S IT 
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO 
YEAH THAT I THINK THAT'S AS MUCH AS WE NEED TO SAY 
THAT'S RIGHT 
SO UH YOU'VE GOTTA WORK OUT HOW TO DO THAT AND WHO TO EMAIL 
MM 
YEAH THAT'S FINE THAT'S FINE 
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANNA DO 
UM AS LONG AS IT'S CLEAR FROM THE SUBJECT BAR THAT IT'S RELEVANT TO THEM AND THAT IT SAYS SOMEWHERE THAT 
FOR PHILOSOPHY STUDENTS WITH AN INTEREST IN LANGUAGE AND AND THAT'S IT 
AND THEN BETWEEN SO WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER MEETING AND AND I MEAN AT THE SAME TIME SO WE'RE SORTING THROUGH ALL THE OTHER TITLES AND AND DECIDING UM HOW TO DIVIDE UP THE SESSIONS 
SO SOMEONE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER TO HAVE TALKS ON A SIMILAR TOPIC SPREAD OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHICH TO ME JUST SEEMED ABSOLUTELY CRAZY 
AND THE REASON SHE GAVE ME WAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH UH TAKING OUT LIKE A WHOLE DAY OR A WHOLE AFTERNOON WOULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT 
BUT I THINK THAT BALANCE AGAINST THE FACT THAT MOST PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY WELL LIKE I CAN HAVE JUST THIS ONE DAY OFF 
AS OPPOSED TO WHEN I'LL NEED AN HOUR OVER THERE DO YOU KNOW AN HOUR EACH DAY FOR THREE DAYS 
IT YOU CAN END UP HAVING TO TAKE THREE AFTERNOONS OR THREE MORNINGS OR WHATEVER OFF 
SO I THINK IN GENERAL AND ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF THE LECTURERS 
UH I THINK A LOT OF THE TIME SIMON KIRBY HAS ALREADY USED TO ME THAT ANYONE ANY OF HIS STUDENTS HE WANTS TO BE IN THE FIRST DAY 
IN THE WEDNESDAY RIGHT 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE I SHIFTED IT I BASICALLY HAD IT ON MONDAY TUESDAY 
WEDNESDAY TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN EVE IT MOVED DOWN TWICE TO WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY 
SO WEDNESDAY IS THE ONLY DAY LEFT THAT HE CAN MAKE 
SO 
YEAH 
SO AND THE OTHER THING IS UM WHEN WE GOT SOME CALLS SAY WE HAVE 
UH FOR INSTANCE THREE PEOPLE SUPERVISED BY BOB LADD 
THEN IT MIGHT BE THAT THEN WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO UH CONTACT BOB AND SAY BOB THESE THREE OF YOUR STUDENTS ARE GONNA BE TALKING 
UM PRESU PRESUMABLY YOU WANT TO BE THERE 
SO CAN YOU GIVE US A TIME THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU 
AND THEN WE CAN PUT THEM IN A BLACK IT IN TIME 
'CAUSE HE SAYS YEAH OKAY THURSDAY AFTERNOON I'VE GOT COMPLETELY FREE 
SO I THINK WE DO NEED TO STICK EVERYONE TOGETHER UH PARTICULARLY IF THEY'VE GOT THE SAME SUPERVISOR 
AND IT'S ALSO GOOD IF TALKS ARE IN THE SAME TOPIC FOR A WHOLE MORNING OR A WHOLE AFTERNOON BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE WILL COME ALONG AND GO UH 
THIS MORNING IT'S ALL ON PHONOLOGY OR THIS MORNING IT'S ALL ON APPLIED LINGUISTICS 
AND THEN 
OKAY 
SO MUCH AS POSSIBLE ANYWAY 
YEAH 
NOW WE NEED IF I'M GONNA SEND IT THIS CALL UH WE NEED A DEADLINE FOR TITLES 
SO 
UM 
WHAT SHOULD WE SAY 
SOMETHING LIKE 'CAUSE WE NEED A DEADLINE FOR TITLES AND A DEADLINE FOR ABSTRACTS 
SO LET'S SET THE THE LATEST DEADLINE 
THE THE UH THE THE SORT OF ABSTRACTS DEADLINE FIRST BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE A MEETING AND THAT'S GONNA BE WHEN ALL THE REAL WORK STARTS 
SO WHAT'S THE ABSOLUTE LATEST 
I WAS THINK I MEAN MAYBE THE END OF 
AND OF MARCH MIGHT BE OKAY 
UH I'M GOING AWAY FOR TWO WEEKS ON THE FOURTH OF APRIL 
AND THEN I'M COMING BACK JUST ONE TIME FOR THE CONFERENCE 
SO ANY ORGANISING AT LEAST STUFF WHERE I NEED TO BE WHERE WE NEED TO MEET PHYSICALLY HAS TO BE DONE BEFORE THAT 
I TELL YOU ONE THING 
UH IT'S STARTING IN THE WEDNESDAY AND THE FIRST DAY BACK IS TUESDAY 
I THINK I'M COMING BACK 
I'M TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT 
HOPEFULLY I'LL BE BACK IN TIME THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING THE DAY BEFORE 
'CAUSE I THINK I'M GONNA BE BACK 
MIGHT EVEN HAVE TO COME ON ON THE EVENING 
BUT THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SET SOME THINGS UP 
LIKE MAYBE JUST GET THE CHAIRS ORGANISED OR WHATEVER 
WE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO INTO THE ROOMS AND GET THINGS READY 
AND THERE'S GONNA BE OTHER THINGS LIKE GETTING THE TECHNOLOGY READY 
IS NOT ONLY IS THERE A PRESSURE TO HAVE UH 
TALKS THAT ARE IN A SIMILAR TOPIC TOGETHER BUT ALSO IF PEOPLE AND THE SAME KIND OF COMPUTER SET UP 
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THEM TOGETHER SO WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP CHANGING IT 
SO BECAUSE I TH I THINK IT WAS CEDRIC HAS ALREADY OFFERED TO DO WHATEVER WE NEED HIM TO DO 
BUT UH JUST NEEDS TO KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT PEOPLE AND SO THAT HE CAN BE THERE AND AND GET IT READY FOR THEM 
SO I THINK WHEN PEOPLE 
WELL HOPEFULLY MOST PEOPLE WILL DO EITHER HAVE SOMETHING LIKE POWERPOINT OR THEY'LL JUST HAVE UH P. D. F. SLIDES OR SOMETHING 
HOPEFULLY NO NO WILL HAVE ANYTHING TOO SPECIALIZED 
SO SH Z 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S GOT A LOT IN THERE 
BUT I THINK IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF I MEAN UH I THINK SOMETIMES MAYBE PEOPLE NEED TO BE IN LINUX RATHER THAN WINDOWS AND SO BOOTING IN AND IT 
UM SO SOMETIMES AN ISSUE I THINK 
UM 
BUT I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD SAY SO WHEN I PUT IT THIS CALL 
I'LL PUT BOTH DEADLINES AND I THINK I'LL SAY THAT WHEN YOU SEND IN YOUR ABSTRACT 
YOU NEED TO MENTION THAT ANY TECHNOLOGY YOU INTEND TO USE IS THAT AT LEAST IF WE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION YEAH 
SO UM SO DEADLINES 
UM OKAY SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS 
IF IF WE GIVE THEM A WHOLE MONTH OR JUST OVER A MONTH THEN 
THAT WOULD BE OKAY WOULDN'T IT BECAUSE WE'VE STILL GOT 
OH NO IT WOULDN'T BE OKAY AT ALL 
IF WE GIVE THEM THE WHOLE MONTH THAT'D GIVE US HARDLY ANY TIME 
SO IF WE GIVE THEM SAY TILL MID MARCH THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
SO GIVE THEM SOMETHING LIKE GIVE THEM SOMETHING LIKE TEN DAYS OR WHATEVER TO GET THE TITLE ONE 
AND THEN GIVE THEM A WEEK ON TOP OF THAT TO GET THE ACTUAL ABSTRACT DONE 
AND THE ABSTRACT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MUCH IT'S PROBABLY ONLY HALF A SIDE OF A. FOUR OR SOMETHING ISN'T IT 
JUST ENOUGH THAT WE CAN SEE WHETHER IT'S INTERESTING OR WHAT KIND OF OUR IT FITS INTO 
THAT'S ALL WE REALLY NEED 
UM SEE IDEAL IDEALLY I WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE GIVEN THEM A BIT LONGER 
BUT I THINK WE 
THAT WILL BE OKAY 
OKAY 
SO UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE A CALENDAR 
UM SO LET'S JUST 
THAT'S TRUE 
NO IT'S I THINK IT'S OKAY WHEN YOU'RE NOT WRITING ON THERE 
UM SO 
SO 
OH 
THIRTY ONE UH NO IT'S TWENTY EIGHT THIS 
THIS MONTH ISN'T IT 
TWO THREE FOUR 
SO IF WE HAVE TO LIKE A MONDAY MONDAY THE FOURTEENTH'D PROBABLY BE QUITE GOOD FOR THE FINAL DEADLINE 
AND THEN UM IF I SEND IT OUT TOMORROW WE'LL SAY SOMETHING LIKE THE L 
OR MAYBE THE FOURTH WOULD BE GOOD 
SO GIVE THEM A W YEAH A WIKI FOR THE TITLE AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE ABOUT TEN DAYS FROM THEN IT ACTUALLY GET THE ABSTRACT IN 
DOES THAT SOUND REASONABLE 
JUST PUT IT HERE YEAH 
THE ELEVENTH 
A BIT EARLIER 
SO I'M SAYING A WEEK FROM WHEN I SEND IT IT 
THAT WOULD BE A WEEK ANYWAY 
THAT WOULD BE A WEEK ANYWAY BUT YOU CAN GIVE THEM TEN DAYS TO YOU CAN GIVE THEM TEN DAYS TO GET THE TITLE 
OR YOU CAN GIVE THEM IT DEPENDS WHICH WAY AROUND YOU WANNA DO IT 
SO WHAT'S GONNA TAKE THEM LONGER ACTUALLY TO DECIDE WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO AND SEND THE TITLE 
OR IS IT GONNA BE IN THE BASIS OF THE TITLE DO THEY WANT MORE TIME TO WRITE THE ABSTRACT 
SO GIVE THEM THE SEVENTH YEAH 
OKAY SO 
SO MONDAY THE SEVENTH IS THE TITLE 
AND THIS PRESUMABLY WILL APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD 
LIKE UM 
AND MONDAY THE FOURTEENTH FOR THE ABSTRACT 
WELL WE WE KIND OF HAVE 
I D UH WE WERE GIVEN 
THE ONLY THING IS ACCE IS ACCESSING THE ACCOUNT 
THEY CAN SEND IT TO P. G. C. TOO LONG AS LONG AS WE CAN GET THE WH I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO THEN 
I'LL GO AND SO MAKE THE TODAY AND AND GET THE PASSWORD AND EVERYTHING 
'CAUSE 
WE POSSIBLY HAVE TO BUT I'LL JUST SORT THAT IT WITH HIM 
BECAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA TELL EVERYONE TO EMAIL P. G. C. THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE PRETTY SURE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS THE ACCOUNT AND THAT IT'S OPERATIONAL AND STUFF 
'CAUSE UH AS FAR I'VE JUST BEEN USING MY OWN UH EMAIL ADDRESS 
BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER IT'S QUITE EASY TO SEND F FROM AN EMAIL ADDRESS 
'CAUSE YOU CAN SEND FROM ANY EMAIL ADDRESS YOU LOOK 
IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT YOU NEED TO P UH IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT WHEN THEY REPLY TO TO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO UH ACCESS IT 
SO I ALREADY TRIED IT ONCE AND I'M SURE THEY GAVE US A PASSWORD 
AND I EVEN I EVEN ACTU 
UH WELL THAT'S IT THEN 
NO PROBLEM 
THAT'S IT 
SO DOES I 
I MEAN IT 
YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THE THING IS IF YOU WANT TO SEND THIS CALL FOR ABSTRACTS 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DO THE PHILOSOPHY AND AND THINGY ONE 
THEN IF YOU WANT TO SEND FROM P. G. C. THEN UH I MEAN YOU MIGHT ALREADY KNOW 
BUT YOU CAN GO IF IF IF YOU DID IT FROM WEB MAIL 
YOU CAN JUST CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT FOR YOURSELF AND WHERE IT IS IT ACTUALLY HAS A SOUND FROM ADDRESS 
AND YOU CAN JUST PUT P. G. C. AT LING DOT AND JUST DO IT THAT WAY 
UH OR DEPENDING ON YOUR NORMAL EMAIL CLIENT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH 
THE THE THE OTHER THING YOU COULD DO IS HAVE IS JUST FILL IN THE REPLY TO ADDRESS AS P. G. C. DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANNA DO 
BUT THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO 
I'LL SEND IT FROM P. G. C. S IF ANYONE REPLIES IT WOULD JUST GO TO THAT ACCOUNT AND ANY OF US CAN ACCESS TO TO ANY TIME 
PRESUMABLY YOU CAN ACCESS FROM WEB MAIL OR YOU KNOW OR I. MAP OR WHATEVER 
YEAH IF YOU WANT TO TO CREATE A WEB PAGE AND JUST COPY MY EMAIL INTO IT OR SOMETHING 
AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU MIGHT WANNA DO AND THEN LATER ON WE CAN PUT THE UH THE PROGRAMME IN 
SO UM 
OKAY 
IT'S NOT QUITE IT'S P TWO OR THREE MINUTES TO 
YOU YOU GET SOMETHING FOR TWO HAVEN'T YOU 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
IS VERY QUICKLY THEN CAN WE ARRANGE A NEW TIME TO HAVE A MEETING

BUT THE THE TEXT FOR THE ACTUAL CALL IS SHE GOING TO OUR WORK SOMETHING OR UH SH SHOULD 
MM-HMM 
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE GLAD TO USE KINDA THERE LINGUISTICS TO ADAPT 
THAT'S ALWAYS QUITE HELPFUL 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
YEAH

BU 
NOT CERTAIN ANYWAY 
THEY KNOW HERE 
THAT'S THAT THING 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM

SO IF WE HAVE TO PUT IN SOME RESTRAINTS 
LET'S SEE 
MM 
UP TO THERE BUT DON'T EXAGGERATE YEAH 
YEAH 
MM

MM-HMM 
ONCE IN THE MORNING TWICE IN THE AFTERNOON

MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS ABOUT IT EASY 
POSTER SESSION IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE JUST THE PEOPLE PRESENTING THE POSTERS ARE THERE AND CAN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
ACTUALLY 
THERE'S ALWAYS THE PROBLEM AGAIN THEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRESENTING THE POSTERS DON'T GET AROUND TO GO AND LOOK AT OTHERS' POSTERS 
BUT LET'S SEE ABOUT THAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
DO WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THIS 
FIRST YEARS 
OH 
ACTUALLY WE HAVE A MESSAGE HERE FROM MITS ABOUT THE POSTER SESSION 
POSTER SESSION WAS INTRODUCED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AS PART OF THE MAIN CONFERENCE 
ONE TWO THOUSAND IT WAS HELD SEPARATELY IN OCTOBER 
THE INTENTION WAS IT IS IT IS A WAY TO INTRODUCE INCOMING POST GRAD STUDENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT'S RESEARCH CULTURE 
HOWEVER I DID NOT PURSUE THIS DO THE FOLLOWING YEAR BECAUSE THE COMMENTS I RECEIVED FROM STUDENTS IN TWO THOUSAND WERE GENERALLY DISCOURAGING 
IN THE OTHER HAND I LATER LEARNED THAT SOME STUDENTS DID FIND THE OCTOBER POSTER SESSION QUITE A USEFUL EXPERIENCE 
MY SUGGESTION THEREFORE IS TO RE EXAMINE THE IDEA OF POSTER SESSION ALTOGETHER AND FIND A BETTER WAY TO IMPLEMENT IT IF THERE SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH INTEREST IN IT 
MM 
YEAH 
LAST SENTENCE 
ONE POSSIBILITY IS TO PUT IT BACK IN THE MAIN CONFERENCE AND LET PEOPLE CHOOSE BETWEEN A PAPER PRESENTATION AND A POSTER 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
BUT A POSTER I MIGHT DO 
MM-HMM 
ALL THESE DEAD LINGUISTS 
MM-HMM 
UM WRITE INTO THE CALL THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING THE IDEA OF HAVING A POSTER SESSION 
SO PEOPLE CAN INDICATE WOULD THEY PREFER TO GIVE A POSTER OR A TALK 
BUT THE ULTIMATE DECISION IS IN OUR SIDE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SEE HOW IT DOES IT WORK OUT WITH THE POSTER SESSION 
HOW DOES IT WORK OUT WITH THE TALKS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEP 
JUST 
THROW A GENERAL SUGGESTION AT THEM 
SO WHAT HAPPENS 
I THINK THEY DO 
STILL YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH MIGHT BE INTERESTING STUFF COMING IN 
READ SOMETHING RECENTLY ABOUT 
I THINK SOMEBODY'S MASTERS PROJECT TO LOOK ON HOW FAR ENGLISH IS ACTU UH ARE ON HOW FAR ENGLISH IS A SHAPING INFLUENCE ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IF 
YEAH 
OR SOME 
SOME RELEVANCE CLAUSE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
KIND OF A RELEVANCE CLAUSE 
MM-HMM 
ADJUST 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I THINK THAT'S 
SO FAR IT'S JUST A GENERAL STATEMENT OF INTEREST WHAT WE INTEND TO DO 
WHAT WE ACTUALLY GET TO DO WE'LL SEE LATER WHEN WE HAVE THE STUFF 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TWO WEEKS AHEAD OF 
AND OF MARCH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AND I WILL BE AWAY 
PROBABLY UNTIL EASTER 
SO THIS ACTUALLY MEANS WE HAVE THE WEEK DIRECTLY AFTER EASTER BETWEEN MY COMING BACK AND YOU LEAVING 
TO GET THE STUFF DONE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IN MY EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU USUALLY SHOULD HAVE S SOME KIND OF UM WHAT'S IT OVER HEAD THINGO UM BEAMER 
IN SOME CASES WE MIGHT IF IT'S REALLY TOUGH WE MIGHT BE AN END OF A OF SOME SOUND SYSTEM TO PLAY RECORDINGS 
SHOULD BE THERE YEAH 
ADJUSTING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NAH 
NO WAY ANYMORE 
MM NEITHER DO I 
MM-HMM 
I COULD CREATE IS ANOTHER CALENDAR 
FOR THE TITLE DEADLINE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH IF I THINK IF THEY'RE REALLY SERIOUS 
TO BE A BIT LATE WITH THE TITLE MIGHT NOT BE BAD BECAUSE IT WILL HELP THEM OUT 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEP 
GETTING ACCESS TO THE UH AT THE ACCOUNT 
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE'VE GOT AT ALL WRITTEN DOWN 
SHOULD I TAKE CARE OF THE WEB PAGE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
NO 
NOT QUITE BUT ALMOST 
YEAH 
UM 
MM-HMM 
I THINK LATEST AS SOON AS THE CELL IS IT 
BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE THE CELL THING WE HAVE THAT WAY AND LOOK AT THE BOAR ORGANISATORIAL STUFF LIKE UH 
DO WE KNOW ABOUT CHAIRS TEA AND STUFF 
OKAY 
IF NOT MORE YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO THE OTHER IF YOU AND LET'S SEE UM UM MYSELF AND MARK 
WHO'S NOT HERE AND BUT I THINK SO IT IT OCCASIONALLY MELISSA WILL ALL BE DOING CHECKING OF THE TRANSCRIPTIONS 
SO THIS IS THE SECOND PASS THESE TRANSCRIPTIONS ARE RECEIVING AND THAT'S PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD 
I THINK YOU ALL KN BASICALLY HAVE AN IDEA WHAT'S INVOLVED 
UM BUT THE EXTRA STEP THAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO DO OF IN THIS CASE IS TO LOOK AT THE SILENT REGIONS AND LISTEN TO THEM FOR EACH CHANNEL AND UM MAKE SURE THAT ONE BACK CHANNELS WERE LOST FOR EXAMPLE 
UM YEAH BACK CHANNELS IS WHAT YOU N TYPICALLY WOULD FIND ALTHOUGH BY AND LARGE THESE ARE GONNA BE SILENT 
SO 
SO YOU CAN UM START S CHECKING BY Y WELL Y YOU KNOW 
YOU CAN ORDER IT IN ANY WAY YOU LIKE BUT UM START WITH THE FIRST CHANNEL AND GO THROUGH IT ENTIRELY 
UM I WOULD RECOMMEND I'VE FOUND THAT IT'S EASIER WHEN YOU'RE CHECKING AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE BOUNDARIES ARE RIGHT FOR A SPEECH SEGMENT 
I WOULD RECOMMEND LIKE SAY THIS ONE 
GO DOWN HERE AT THE UH TRASCRIPTION TRANSCRIPTION TIER AND SELECT THAT IT IS THAT UH WHEN YOU PLAY 
YOU'RE CERTAIN THAT WHEN IT STOPS YOU'VE CAUGHT THE WHOLE SPEECH SIGNAL FOR THAT UTTERANCE AND HAVEN'T LOST ANY SIGNAL INFORMATION 
UM OTHERWISE IT IT'S LIABLE TO KEEP IN RUNNING AND YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE WHERE IT WHERE IT FINISHES 
SO IT IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME 
BUT UM ALTERNATIVELY 
I YOU YOU COULD JUST LISTEN TO THE SPEECH SEGMENTS AGAIN AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS CORRECT FOR THIS AND SO YOU COULD JUST HIT UM 
AND THEN 
LIKE THAT 
AND THEN GO BACK AND CHECK THE THE SILENCE REGIONS 
HOW IT IF IF YOU WANNA MAKE YOUR JOB A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING YOU CAN DO DO IT IN UM DIFFERENT WAYS ON A DIFFERENT DAY 
IT DOESN'T MATTER 
AS LONG AS IT GETS DONE 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
YOU'RE DOING SO THAT'S THAT'S THE ROLE OF THE CHECKER IS TO CHECK WHAT'S USED IN THE SILENT REGIONS UH IN THE SPEECH REGIONS AND THEN MAKE SURE NOTHING WAS LOST IN THE SILENT REGIONS 
YOU'RE ALSO UM RESPONSIBLE FOR RESOLVING ANY UM UNCERTAINTIES THAT WERE MARKED BY THE ORIGINAL TRANSCRIBER 
AND AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE THERE ARE GONNA BE M MANY SITUATIONS WHERE YOU LIKE THE FIRST TRANSCRIBER CAN'T MAKE ANY SENSE OF IT 
AND ON THAT CASE IT WILL BE UP TO YOU TO USE THE AT SYMBOL 
UM AND THAT CAN BE USED UH TO REPRESENT ONE UM UNINTELLIGIBLE WORD OR MULTIPLE INTELLIGIBLE WORDS BUT JUST USE ONE AT SYMBOL 
UM YEAH MM-HMM EXACTLY 
AND SO THAT UM ONCE YOU GO THROUGH ALL THE SO UM SPEECH REGIONS AND ALL THE UM NON SPEECH REGIONS 
NO O YOU COULD MAKE ANOTHER STEP OF DOING A SEARCH USING UM GOING UNDER THE EDIT MENU YOU CAN 
DO A SEARCH FOR YEAH FIND REPLACE FOR OPEN PARENTHESES AND THAT'LL TAKE YOU TO ANY THAT IT ANY THAT THE FIRST TRANSCRIBER MIGHT HAVE MARKED IT 
SO THERE'S NO 
AND THEN YOU CAN JUST RESOLVE THESE ALL IN BY ONE IS IS A DIFFERENT SET OF UM CHANGES ALTOGETHER 
AND AND LIKEWISE FOR THE DOUBLE QUESTION MARKS 
JUST ONCE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH UM AND RESOLVED ALL THE OPEN PARENTHESES YOU CAN DO THE SAME FOR P UH DOUBLE QUESTION MARKS 
AND UM AND LIKE I SAID IF YOU IF YOU CAN'T MAKE ANY SENSE OF IT THEN JUST USE THE AT SYMBOL 
IF YOU CAN UM JUST GIVE IT YOU KNOW GIVE IT YOUR BEST GUESS ON THESE CASES 
IF 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S I WOULD UH IF YOU'RE V IF YOU'RE QUITE CERTAIN THEN I WOULD GO AHEAD AND UM TYPE WHAT YOU THINK IT WAS USED 
IF IF YOU V THINK THAT ONE YOU THERE'S MAYBE A THE THIRTY PERCENT CHANCE YOU'RE WRONG OR OR MORE 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
SO MAYBE A GOOD IDEA WOULD BE TO LISTEN TO EACH CHANNEL ONE BY AN IDEA LISTEN TO THE SILENT AND NON SILENT REGIONS AND MAKE ALL THOSE CORRECTIONS 
LEAVE THE UNKNOWNS THE UM AMBIGUITIES THE UNCERTAINTIES UNCERTAINTIES UNTIL LATER 
SO GO THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS AND DO THAT AND THEN UM THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE THE CONTEXT FROM ALL FOUR SPEAKERS 
AND THEN GO BACK AND DO THOSE SEARCHES ONE BY ONE FOR EACH CHANNEL 
HOW WOULD THAT BE 
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD 
OKAY 
YOU'LL YOU'LL KNOW ALL IT WELL WHAT WAS USED IN THIS MEETING BY THE TIME YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL 
THAT WOULD HELP US UM YOU KNOW NAB A GOOD NUMBER OF THOSE UNCERTAINTIES 
MM 
CHOOSE ONE IT C I MEAN YOU THINK IF IT FROM A SPEECH RECOGNITION POINT OF VIEW AGAIN 
AND ALWAYS THIS SHOULD BE THIS SHOULD MOTIVATE YOU 
YEAH 
WHAT IS MOST ROBUST FOR A SPEECH RECOGNITION AND AND LEAVE IT ANYTHING SO YOU'RE WELL GEARED TOWARDS THIS TASK 
UM SO I'VE GONE THROUGH SORRY 
OH NO NO NO 
GO AHEAD GO AHEAD 
TOO MANY 
OKAY OKAY 
SO UM THIS IS NO I'VE GONE THROUGH 
I'VE JUST DONE ON CHANNEL 
AND THERE WERE LOTS OF LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS AS YOU CAN SEE 
'CAUSE I'VE GOT SQUARE BRACKETS AROUND ALL THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CHANGED 
UM SO THIS PERSON DIDN'T UH UM THE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT CAPITALISATION 
SO JUST ABOUT EVERY UTTERANCE NEEDS TO BE CAPITALISED AND AND NEEDS THE END PUNCTUATION 
YEAH 
UM NO NO NO 
WHATEVER M MAKES SENSE TO YOU 
UM BUT IN IT IT CAN CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT SEGMENT AND THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'LL REVIEW SOME OF THESE THINGS UM AFTER I GO THROUGH THIS A BIT UM JUST TO RE CAP 
TH THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I'VE AFTER CHECKING UM T EVERYBODY'S WORK UM THESE ARE THINGS THAT WERE COMMONLY LEFT OUT OR YOU KNOW MISC MIS TRANSCRIBED WHATEVER 
SO I'LL GO OVER THIS TO USE AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE WHITE BOARD 
UM UM OKAY 
SO UH THIS PERSON LEFT TO A LOT OF END PUNCTUATION AND UM HERE'S A CASE WHERE I THINK SHE WAS TRANSCRIBING AN OUT BREATH UM OR POSSIBLY ONE IN BREATH UH TO UH ONE AND USED THE HASH MARK 
IN ANY CASE I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING AND AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE TRANSCRIBING IN BREATHS OR OUT BREATHS 
THAT'S AN INFORMATION WE DON'T NEED 
UH YOU KNOW THIS IS THE HEAD SET MIC AND I HEARD SOMETHING THERE 
IT WAS ABOUT IT W YEAH IT WAS A BIT OF A YEAH IT WAS CREAKY SO YEAH OF UH 
YEAH WELL I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS UM LET'S SEE WAIT 
YEAH 
SO THERE'S THERE'S ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT MORE ON OTHER THAN THAN I HEARD BEFORE 
THIS IS SO I W I HEARD A CREAKY VOICE AND IT WAS AUDIBLE OF THE LEVEL OF THE REST OF THE SPEECH 
SO I WOULD I WOULD KEEP THAT 
I THINK THAT'S GOOD 
OH OKAY 
I WAS ADDING THAT THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING 
THAT MAKES SENSE 
OKAY THERE YOU GO 
UM SO THERE'S THINGS LIKE THAT 
UM SH THERE'S A MISSING FALSE START HERE UM THAT DIDN'T GET CAUGHT 
SO I ADDED THAT ONE 
UM SO THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE COMMON IN THE TRANSCRIPTIONS THAT I'VE LOOKED AT 
MISSED FALSE STARTS UM MISSED UM 
TRY TO GET IT RIGHT 
I MEAN THE T I THINK SYLLABLES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR FOR THE 
YEAH WELL DON'T LET IT DRIVE YOU CRAZY 'CAUSE THERE IS ONE SPEAKER MELISSA JUST PLAYED FOR ME TODAY AND HE STUTTERS HORRIBLY 
I MEAN I I I'D YOU KNOW IT'S UNFORTUNATE FOR HIM AND FOR US 'CAUSE IT'S REALLY GONNA BE A NIGHTMARE TO TRANSCRIBE 
SO YOU WILL HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE 
BUT IF YOU C IF IT'S EASY FOR REPEATED UM OF THE WORD IS REPEATED FOUR TIMES UH THEN THAT'S NOT TOO HARD TO COUNT 
I HAVEN'T COME ACROSS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN I HAVEN'T COME ACROSS ANYTHING EXCEEDING FOUR I DON'T THINK 
HAVE YOU 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAKE YOUR BEST GUESS 
TRY TO LISTEN TO IT CAREFULLY ENOUGH BUT NOT NOT SO THAT YOU'RE OBSESSING OVER IT FOR TOO LONG 
I WOULD SAY 
ALRIGHT 
WELL THERE AGAIN OF UH THINK ABOUT ROBUSTNESS AND SPEECH UH RECOGNITION AND IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER 
IF IT'S A WORD FRAGMENT WHO CARES 
IT YOU'RE MARKING IT IS A FRAGMENT AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT 
WELL UM I WOULDN'T DE BE USING THE STAR SO LIBERALLY UM FOR A NON NATIVE SPEAKER 
MM-HMM 
WELL RIGHT RIGHT 
UM I MEAN AND AND FOR THAT MATTER A LOT OF N NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS' REALISATIONS AREN'T GOING TO BE IS TRUE TO ME 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I WOULDN'T BOTHER TO MARK ALL OF THOSE INSTANCES THOUGH 
NO I MEAN YEAH THEY'RE THEY'RE UH YOU'RE GONNA FIND THAT FOR ANY SPEAKER THEY HAVE A SET WAY OF OF REALISING THESE THINGS 
AND AND IT'S JUST LIKE FIONA WAS SAYING UM THAT THE THE WORD THAT STANDS OUT IS SOMETHING REALLY UH ABERRANT 
LIKE UM I'M THINKING IF I I'VE USED THIS EXAMPLE BEFORE 
THERE'S A GUY WHO SAYS PROJECT INSTEAD OF PRODUCT AND UH IT'S SOMETHING LIKE PROJECT AND IT'S PROBABLY JUST HAS HIS PRONUNCIATION OF OF 
YEAH 
WELL IT IT THEY WERE CLEARLY TALKING ABOUT A PRODUCT 
SO SO UH I AM I MARKED THAT IS A UM UH MISPRONUNCIATION OR S OR SOMETHING TO FLAG ANYWAY 
UH EVALUATION 
YEAH I I'VE I REMEMBER THAT 
THAT ONE I WOULD I WOULD FLAG JUST LIKE YOU DID 
IT THAT'S SOMETHING DEFINITELY TO MARK UP 
MM YEAH 
THAT'S GOOD 
THAT'S GOOD 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH I KN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TELL YOU BUT IN UM CERTAIN SPEAKERS 
I IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO P I LOST MY LAPEL LAPEL MIC 
YEAH 
WAIT 
OOPS 
LEAST I WON'T BE TRANSCRIBING THE WHAT DO I CARE 
OKAY SO UM THERE'VE THERE'VE BEEN LOTS OF MISSED FILLED PAUSES 
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO MISS THOSE SOME MORE THAN OTHERS 
SO JUST REALLY KEEP IN OUR IT FOR THIS 
UM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I I'M NOT SURE I MISS THEM PLENTY MYSELF 
BUT UM THIS THIS SECOND PASS WE SHOULD REALLY TRY TO CATCH ALL OF THEM OR AT LEAST MOST OF THE YEAH 
NO NO 
AFTER 
OKAY 
YEAH IT SHOULD BE AFTER EVERY UM ACRONYM LETTER 
YEAH YEAH 
SO AT THIS POINT THE UM THE ONLY FILE THAT'S BEEN CHECKED IS MELISSA ONE THAT MELISSA DID AND THAT WAS CHECKED BY UM 
UM SO WE WE WE'RE STARTING FRESH WITH THIS AND YOU KNOW 
CHANGES LIKE THAT THAT WERE JUST ANNOUNCED WE'LL WE'LL BE ABLE TO CATCH FOR THIS FIRST PASSES 
SO YEAH YOU IF YOU DO IS UM SOMETHING LIKE UM U. H. M. FOR UM YOU YOU WOULD CHANGE THAT AT THE REGULARISED V VERSION 
UM AND WE JUST CH YOU KNOW THIS IS ARBITRARY BUT WE HAD TO CHOOSE SOMETHING AND NOT LET TO GET TOO CONVOLUTED WITH UM WITH CHOICE 
HERE'S 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM THERE 
UM I 
YEAH YEAH 
SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY RESTARTING THE SENTENCE BUT JUST A RESTART OF ANY TYPE 
A PHRASE 
YEAH 
THANK YOU FOR THAT DESCRIPTION BEATA

UM AS A AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS IS JUST MISSING AN E. CETERA 
UM BUT ANYWAY 
YOU CAN 
WE'VE CONSIDERED EXPERIMENTING WITH RUNNING THIS THROUGH A SPELL CHECK 
YOU COULD TAKE THIS IS AN EMACS FILE AND RUN A SPELL CHECK ON IT 
BUT I THINK IT WOULD SLOW THINGS DOWN TOO MUCH 
SO JUST HOPEFULLY I IN GOING THROUGH THIS VERY CAREFULLY YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE THESE MISSPELLINGS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM

RIGHT 
YEAH I TH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
SO WE'LL WE WILL JUST HOPE THAT YOU CATCH IT

A SPACE BETWEEN SHE WOULD LIKE SO 
SHE WOULD LIKE SO 
YES YES YES YOU'RE RIGHT 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
UH THAT WAS WHAT YOU WERE M REMARKING ABOUT 
OKAY 
THERE WE GO 
LET ME SAVE THAT 
OKAY 
WHAT ELSE 
UM BE CAREFUL ABOUT UM FINDING MIS TRANSCRIPTIONS 
SO UM 
SO SHE T SHE TRANSCRIBED THAT IS WOULD 
AND SO 
WELL I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR THERE 
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE GONNA BE C 
NO YOU TRY TO KEEP IT IS TRUE AT WHAT'S BEING USED 
THEN SO UM 
MM-HMM 
I'D HAVE TO HEAR IT BECAUSE IT M SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE A FRAGMENT 
UH IT JU I'D JUST HAVE TO HEAR IT 
UM UM I'D YOU DON'T WANT TO BE UM BE PRESCRIPTIVE AND AND TYPE WHAT YOU THINK THEY SHOULD'VE SAID 
BUT 
BUT I I I DO KNOW THE TYPE OF SCENARIO YOU'RE DESCRIBING 
I JUST IT'S JUST HARD TO ANSWER THAT WITHOUT HEARING SOMETHING 
MM 
YEAH THEY SHOULD ALL I I STOPPED MARKING THEM 'CAUSE THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY 
BUT 
UH LET'S SEE 
OH YEAH Y YOU'RE RIGHT 
RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
OKAY 
THERE WAS A YES IN THERE 
UM AND 
YES 
IS ANOTHER MISSED FALSE START 
UM 
THERE WAS CREAKINESS ON THE SH 
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO MARK THAT IS A SEPARATE SOUND 
UM 
MM 
IF IT SOUNDS LIKE UM THE LAUGHTER IS JUST UM INTERRUPTING A AN UTTERANCE THAT CONTINUES AFTER THE LAUGHTER I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT CAPITALISING 
IF YOU HEAR JUST LAUGHTER IN OTHER SIDE YEAH DO THAT 
YEAH YEAH MM I DON'T KNOW WE'LL HAVE TO I'LL 
OKAY SO LAUGHTER DURING SPEECH 
I'LL F I'LL TALK TO MELISSA AND JEAN 
SO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO WE DON'T HAVE ANY QUAL TAGS LIKE THEY USE 
BUT UM I'LL F I'LL 
I'LL FIGURE THAT IN IT AND PUT IT UP ON THE WIKI OR EMAIL YOU 
GOOD QUESTION 
I'VE COME ACROSS THAT AS WELL 
MM SO 
OH YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT THAT NOISE WAS INDICATING 
UM WE CAN SKIP ON 
THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF THINGS I WANNA POINT IT 
UM LET'S SEE 
OKAY 
DID YOU 
DID SHE SAY CIRCUIT 
I DIDN'T REALLY HEAR THAT 
SO WOULD WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO PUT AN ASTERISK AFTER THAT 
OH YEAH 
OH OKAY 
NO NOT NECESSARILY 
NO IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNIZER IS LIABLE TO TRIP UP ON I THINK 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
UM YOU THAT MAY BE BUT I PROBABLY WOULD FLAG IT 
I DEPENDING ON HOW HOW DIFFERENT THE VOWEL SOUND WAS 
IT'S GONNA BE YOUR CALL ON A LOT OF THESE CASES 
MM 
OKAY HERE 
HERE'S A CASE OF UM WHERE I FIND IT IN UH FIND A CASE OF DISCONTINUITY 
BUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE SHE'S A NON NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER I DON'T I DON'T KNOW 
MAYBE THAT WAS GRAMMATICALLY N UH 
UNMARKED FOR HERE 
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
MAYBE THAT WASN'T UH HERE ARE STARTING MAYBE SH THAT WAS 
MM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
SO AGAIN I DON'T KNOW 
THAT WE THAT WAS MY REFLEX AT THE TIME TO PUT THAT THERE 
BUT 
YEAH 
WELL 
UNLESS YOU KINDA GET RIGHT 
OH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH I WOULD TYPE IT IS TWO 
MM OKAY I'M GONNA SKIP AHEAD 
UH LET'S SEE THERE WAS A C 
SO I I HEAR SHE WOULD QUITE CLEARLY THERE AND I THINK A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RESOLVE JUST JUST HELPS TO HAVE THE CONTEXT AND BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO IT AGAIN 
WELL 
OKAY 
YES IT COULD BE A LOT OF THINGS 
UM 
SO THERE IS THERE IS ANOTHER CASE WHERE THERE WASN'T A SPACE BETWEEN UH 
A NON WORD FRAGMENT AND UM 
A RE START 
OKAY 
WHAT ELSE 
THERE IS AN EXTRA LITTLE SYMBOL ON HERE AND THAT WAS JUST KINDA CARELESSNESS 
UM 
SO D EVEN IF IT'S SOMETHING AS BRIEF AS MM-HMM WE'RE WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND CAPITALISE THAT 
AND MAARIKA ASKED ME WHAT TO DO IN THE CASE OF AN UTTERANCE JUST CONSISTING OF LAUGHTER 
DO WE DO WE USE PUNCTUATION IN THESE CASES AND I DON'T KNOW 
I HAVEN'T BEEN 
I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY 
YEAH 
OH NO 
UM 
DELETE AND COLLAPSE 
I'M TRYING TO UNDERST I'M TRYING TO INTERPRET MY NOTE HERE 
DELETE AND COLLAPSE THE SURROUNDING SEGMENTS 
OKAY I GUESS THERE THERE JUST REALLY WASN'T ENOUGH TO TRANSCRIBE THERE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO LIKE I SAID CLICK DOWN HERE JUST TO IF YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED THAT TRICK ALREADY 
AND THAT WON'T PLAY ANY SURROUNDING SEGMENTS 
SO THERE'S NOTHING THERE WORTH TRANSCRIBING 
UM 
OH 
UH-HUH 
THIS ONE 
UH SO YOU HAVEN'T PUT A HYPHEN THERE 
I SEE I SEE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
COMMAS 
COMMAS DID YOU SAY 
OH 
FOR GO FOR THAT IS TYPE OF SITUATION 
YEAH OKAY 
COMMAS ARE FINE 
I MEAN THEY'RE EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE EXTRACTED GLOBALLY SO IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU USE THE COMMA 
YEAH WE CAN JUST WIPE THEM OUT IN ONE FELL SWOOP 
I I AM TOO 
I I LIKE COMMAS AND THEN UH STEVE RENALS WHO'S PROJECT MANAGER HAD A LOOK AT UM I THINK IT WAS MY TRANSCRIPTIONS 
WHAT ARE ALL THESE COMMAS DOING AN HOUR 
BUT HE DIDN'T HE ULTIMATELY HE SAID IT WASN'T A PROBLEM 
THEY WILL I TH THEY'LL HELP IN THE CASE OF DISCOURSE MARKING BUT HIS POINT WAS THAT THEY'RE REALLY SUBJECTIVE 
I MEAN SOMETHING THAT YOU THE TRANSCRIBER HERE YEAH YEAH 
I REALLY LIKE USING COMMAS 
OH 
SH UH SHE SPELLED CUTEST UM WITH AN A. IS THAT THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I POINTED OUT 
OKAY WHAT ELSE 
UM 
SO HERE'S LET'S SEE 
NOW THIS WAS OUR 
SO SHE TYPED UH ARE AND I I DIDN'T QUITE HEAR THAT 
BUT 
BUT I YOU CAN SEE HOW IT COULD'VE BEEN I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
RIGHT 
AND YOU CAN NEVER KNOW BUT IF IT FITS WELL ENOUGH AS A AS AN INDEFINITE ARTICLE THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL 
UH I WAS SO I WAS SUGGESTING THAT SHE TO BE UH INSTEAD OF OUR 
BUT 
YEAH I IT'S TRICKY IT GETS AMBIGUOUS 
UM I DON'T KNOW 
UH WHAT'S THIS 
WELL UH SHE'S 
I HEAR THE WELL THERE 
THE ABOUT THIS BEING A HEAD SET MIC CHANNEL M MY MAKE IT EASIER TO HERE 
SHE TRANSCRIBED FROM THE LAPEL MIC 
OH 
OH 
OH 
OH GOOD 
AND YOU TRANSCRIBED THAT SPEAKER ENTIRELY 
IF THAT COMES UP AGAIN WE'VE GOT UM HEADSET MIC FILES NOW 
IN FACT THEY REPLACED ALL THE LAPEL MIC FILES IN THE M. M. M. SERVER WITH HEAD SET MIC FILES 
WHICH WE WEREN'T ASKING THEM TO DO BUT ANYWAY THEY DID IT 
AND SO NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE LAPEL MIC FILES 
APPARENTLY THE HEADSET MIC FILES ARE ARE JUST A BIT LOUDER 
AND SO YOU'LL F PROBABLY FIND YOURSELF TURNING THE VOLUME DOWN CONSIDERABLY 
BUT BUT APPARENTLY OTHER THAN THAT THEY'RE JUST IS GOOD 
BUT LET US KNOW BECAUSE WE CAN RETRIEVE THE THE OTHER FILES 
YEAH 
OH 
OKAY 
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA GO THROUGH UH ANY MORE OF THIS BECAUSE I I THINK I'VE GOTTEN THROUGH MOST OF THE TYPES THAT I MEANT TO PAINT IT 
OH RIGHT RIGHT 
UM WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO FOR THAT 
I D I DID S SO I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME GUIDELINES FOR ANOTHER CORPUS AND I DID IS SOMETHING ABOUT PROPER NAMES 
SO I'LL I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THAT AND SEE HOW WE CAN HANDLE THAT HERE 
WHAT 
OH YEAH QUITE POSSIBLY BUT SINCE IT'S COMING FROM ICSI UH IT'S COMING FROM IDIAP IN SWITZERLAND 
YEAH IT W IT SHOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO GET BUT IT'S IT'S IN EITHER STOP 
YOU KNOW EMAILING SOMEBODY TO FIND OUT WHO KNOWS THIS INFORMATION 
ANYWAY IT'S 
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE EVERYONE SIGNS A CONSENT FORM WHEN THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE EXPERIMENT 
SO WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT 
BUT BUT THERE SHOU WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE A WEE A MEANS OF DEALING WITH PROPER NAMES WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS OR HOW IT MIGHT BE SPELLED AT ALL AND AND FLAGGING THAT IN IN SOME WAY 
SO I'LL TH I'LL I'LL TRY TO ADDRESS BOTH THINGS 
UH JUST JUST TYPE MISTER FULLY 
I M. A. S. T. I. R. YEAH 
AND SOME WITH MISSUS M. A. S. S. A. S. I BELIEVE 
SO IT I BELIEVE I BELIEVE CHECK CHECK THE DICTIONARY 
THAT YEAH BUT YOU WOULD NEVER UM TYPE THE ABBREVIATED SPELLING FOR ANYTHING 
UM WELL I'M SURE THERE'S A SPELLING IN THE U. I. D. YEAH 
UH-HUH 
OH RIGHT 
SO THE TRANSCRIBER'S ENCLOSING EVERYTHING IN CARETS AND WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS 
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE YOU WILL BE LEAVING QUESTION MARKS THERE 
UM OKAY 
RIGHT 
UM IT SHOULDN'T BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE LEFT LIKE THE ASTERISK WILL BE LEFT FOR THE PRICE THE SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING 
BUT CARETS WITH QUESTION MARKS IN BETWEEN WOULD HAVE TO BE RESOLVED IN SOME WAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I I SUPPOSE THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO REALLY 
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE POLYGLOT TRANSCRIBERS HERE 
OH YEAH YEAH 
IF YOU IF IF IF IT'S A FOREIGN WORD AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS JUST ENCLOSE IT IN CARETS 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
IF YOU IF YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT YOU'VE GOT A FAIR GRASP ON FRENCH FOR EXAMPLE WHY NOT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM THERE IS THERE IS JUST ONE OTHER THING SHE SHE TYPED OKAY UM IN CAPS 
I. C C O. CAPITAL O. CAPITAL K. AND HUGE NO NO I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE MISSED THAT IN THE ON THE GUIDELINES 
YEAH 
IT IS O. K. A. Y. 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL IT WILL BE YOUR JOBS TO CATCH ALL OF THESE THINGS 
SO ON UM NO NO TRANSCRIBER WILL BE CHECKING NO CHECKER WILL BE CHECKING THEIR T OWN TRANSCRIPTION 
YES 
YES 
SO WE WILL CATCH THESE THINGS 
MORE EFFICIENTLY I THINK 
AND ONE SO I'LL JUST GO UP TO THE BOARD DO I HAVE TO KEEP THIS STUFF ON 
OH YEAH THEY'VE GOT CLIPS 
RIGHT I'M MOBILE 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
SO I GUESS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF USING THE WHITE BOARD AND KILLING A LITTLE MORE TIME I'LL JUST WRITE DOWN THE THINGS THAT ARE MOST COMMON TO BE CHECKED 
SO LET'S SEE 
SO UH OKAY 
NOW 
OKAY SO ALRIGHT 
RATHER THIS IS A LIST OF THINGS TO DO IS THE CHECKER 
SO YOU WANNA LISTEN TO THE SILENT REGIONS 
THEN CHECK THE SPEECH REGIONS 
AND AS PART OF THAT YOU WANT TO ME CHECK THE BOUNDARIES 
AND UH BY THE WAY THIS SHOULD BE UM 
UM TRANSCRIBE 
ANY MISSED SPEECH 
AND JUST LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE 
OKAY 
AND WITHIN THIS CHECKING THE SPEECH SEGMENTS YOU WANT TO LISTEN FOR OUR LIKE FOR MISSED UM 
LIKE FOR MISSED PUNCTUATION 
FILLED PAUSES 
WORDS IN STUTTERING 
AND IF YOU HAVE UM IF YOU HAVE A STUTTERED WORD YOU DON'T NEED TO USE THE HYPHEN TO MARK DISCONTINUITY 
IT'S JUST SO IF SOMEBODY SAYS TH TH THEN IT'S JUST THE THE 
UM WORDS IN ST UH 
AND WHAT ELSE 
TRY TO GET F FALSE STARTS 
SHORT WORDS MAKE SURE WITH LITTLE WORDS LIKE THE AND UH LITTLE ARTICLES AND THAT KIND OF THING DON'T GET OMITTED 
UM SHORT WORDS AND WORD FRAGMENTS 
THESE ARE THE COMMONLY MISSED THINGS 
AND THEN UM LIKE FOR CASES OF MIS TRANSCRIPTION 
SEEMS IS USUALLY TO BE WRITING THIS ALL 
BUT ANYWAY MIS TRANSCRIPTION SO MAKE SURE IF THE SPEAKER SAID WELL 
YOU TYPE WILL NOT WOULD OR UM IF THEY SAY WE EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT BE MORE GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT TO TYPE WE'RE UM THAT KIND OF THING 
UM THE CASES OF ELLIPSIS WHERE UM MAYBE THE TRANSCRIBER TYPED THEM BUT REALLY WHAT WAS USED WAS 'EM IS WHERE YOU USE THE APOSTROPHE 
AND LIKE FOR CAPITALISATION I'M NOT GONNA GONNA DO ANY MORE OF THIS 
CAPITALISATION 
SPELLING 
UM SO THE U. I. D. TO CHECK ON THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW BUT 
UM REFER TO THE WIKI FOR ALL REGULARISED SPELLINGS AND F FOR THINGS LIKE FILLED PAUSES 
HE WAS THAT 
WE 
AND THEN YEAH CAPITALISE THE K. 
YEAH 
AND 
I THINK SMELLS REALLY GOOD 
I SAID IT ALWAYS LOVE SMELLING MARKERS 
WHAT ELSE DID I FOUND 
UM THE S MAKE SURE THE DO THE DASH THE HYPHEN WHATEVER YOU CALL IT 
AS BEING USED APPROPRIATELY IN CASES OF DISCONTINUITY UM BUT NOT IN STUTTERING LIKE I SAID 
AND AND DON'T USE IT WHEN THE UTTERANCE IS CLEARLY CONTINUED ON THE NEXT SEGMENT OR WHATEVER 
UM DON'T TRANSCRIBE IN BREATHS OR OUT BREATHS 
AND OKAY SHOULD NEVER BE UM TWO CAPITAL LETTERS IT SHOULD BE O. K. A. Y. 
UM AND ONE OTHER THING IS TO BREAK BREAK UP LONG SEGMENTS IF YOU FIND ANY 
SO 
YEAH BUT THAT'S A KIND OF CRUDE GUIDELINE 
I'D I'D SAY JUST ANYTHING THAT SEEMS UNMANAGEABLE 
OH 
YEAH YEAH 
REALLY UH IT IT MEANS NOTHING TO SAY A MINUTE IT'S JUST A G A REALLY CRUDE GUIDELINE 
I WOULD JUST TRY TO KEEP SEGMENTS VERY MANAGEABLE UM AND A BIT U YOU KNOW SO THIS WAVE FORMS TO HELP YOU 
AND YOU CAN ADJUST THE RESOLUTION SO THAT UH 
THAT DIDN'T HELP ME TOO MUCH BUT YOU CAN USE THIS LITTLE SLIDE BAR TO ADJUST THE RESOLUTION 
ACTUALLY THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING 
WHICH O 
YEAH 
RIGHT OKAY OKAY 
SO YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OH OKAY RIGHT 
UH-HUH 
HMM 
OH RIGHT THAT'S GOOD 
OKAY 
THAT'S EXCELLENT 
ALRIGHT 
OH THAT'S THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW 
OKAY 
YEAH SO TO HELP YOU MAKE CUTS JUST LIKE LIKE IF YOU KNOW SO THIS WAVE FORM AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT L LOSING ANY SIGNAL INFORMATION 
BUT UM CUTTING SEGMENTS DOWN AS A L A LOW PRIORITY BUT IT IT WILL HELP ULTIMATELY I THINK POST PROCESSING WISE 
I DON'T 
YEAH YOU DON'T DON'T GET EXCESSIVE ABOUT IT 
'CAUSE THAT JUST ENDS UP TAKING TOO MUCH TIME 
BUT I D I THINK FROM A SPEECH RECOGNITION POINT OF VIEW IT SHOULDN'T MATTER THOSE SEGMENTS BEING WHATEVER LENGTH THAT THEY HAPPEN TO BE 
I'VE SEEN OTHER P PEOPLE'S TRANSCRIPTION GUIDELINES LIKE F FOR THE UM ICSI PROJECT AT BERKELEY AND ELSEWHERE SAY INDICATING THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER AND IT'S THE POINT IS JUST TO GET 'EM INTO MANAGEABLE UNITS 
AND 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE ACTUALLY THAT'S THE BEST REASON FOR CUTTING THEM DOWN 
BUT HOPEFULLY THE THAT'LL BE DONE DURING THE FIRST PASS BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT 
MAKING THE CHECKERS' JOB A LITTLE EASIER 
UM AND THEN YEAH JUST UM UM BE SURE AFTER YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE FOR CHANNELS TO UM DO A SEARCH ON ALL THE UNKNOWNS 
ALL THE UM CASES OF AMBIGUITY OR WHATEVER 
AND WHAT ELSE WAS I GONNA SAY 
THE WAY WE'LL BE ALLOCATING THIS IS IS THE SAME AS BEFORE THE IT'S GONNA BE IN THE THE THE SAME THE SAME PAGE JUST FURTHER DOWN 
SCROLL DOWN YOU'LL SEE WE ALL THE FILES 
AND UH I'VE ALREADY ALLOCATED SOME SOME THINGS TO BE CHECKED 
SO IF YOU RUN OUT OF WORK GO AHEAD AND START CHECKING BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S UM CONSIDERABLY UM BOTTLE NECKED AT THE MOMENT 
YEAH I'D SAY FOR NOW UM WE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE UH MUCH NEW STUFF TO BE UH TO BE GONE OVER FOR A FIRST PASS 
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO UM DO THIS SECOND PASS 
AND I'VE INDICATED IN A COLUMN WHETHER SOMETHING IS PRIORITY 
UM I THINK I HIGH TYPED HIGH IF IT'S HIGH PRIORITY 
UM SO DO THIS WOULD BE THE ONES YOU WOULD FOCUS ON FIRST OBVIOUSLY 
AND WHEN IT CAME YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE FILE NAME IN ANY WAY 
JUST KEEP IT THE SAME 
UM THERE THERE IS GOING TO BE A CHECKING IN PROCEDURE 
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY'S MENTIONED THIS BEFORE BUT YOU'LL YOU'LL KNOW ABOUT THIS WITH THE C. V. S. SERVER 
SO THE 
RIGHT BUT IT'S BE SO Y SIMILAR 
BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE CREATING A THREE A GUY JONATHAN IS CREATING A WEB FORM FOR YOU TO DO THIS ALL VERY SIMPLY AND LIKE JUST UM UPLOAD EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE UH UP UPLOAD THE FILE THAT YOU'VE TRANSCRIBED AND AND YOU'LL BE NOTING WHETHER IT'S THE FIRST PASS OR THE SECOND PASS AND YOU YOUR NAME UM SO THE PERSON WHO DID THAT PARTICULAR PASS 
AND THAT WILL HAPPEN SOON 
I'LL LET YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU'LL HAVE TO I WOULD SUGGEST CREATING A F FOLDER UM CALLED FILES TO BE CHECKED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
AND THEN WITHIN THAT CREATE A S CREATE SUB FOLDERS FOR THE THE GIVEN MEETING AND YOU'LL HAVE TO GET ALL THE SOUND FILES UNFORTUNATELY FROM THE M. M. M. SERVER ON YOUR OWN 
BECAUSE THE THE AMI SERVER'S NOT VERY RELIABLE FOR GETTING THESE SOUND FILES UNCORRUPTED 
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO GET ALL THE SOUND FILES FROM THE M. M. M. SERVER AND THE PERSON'S TRANSCRIPTION FILE SHOULD BE IN THAT FOLDER WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING YOURS 
UM AND THEN YOU'LL JUST UH YEAH D YOU'LL COPY THAT OVER YOU WON'T DON'T MOVE IT OVER 
BECAUSE WE WANNA HAVE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF THESE THINGS BUT YEAH COPY IT INTO YOUR DIRECTORY AND KEEP THE SAME NAME 
AND THEN WHEN YOU CHECK IT ON IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE REGISTERED EVEN THOUGH THE THE FIRST PASS WAS CHECKED IN WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS CHECKING IN BUSINESS 
UM IT WILL KNOW WHICH PASS IT IS BUT I THINK YOU'LL ALSO BE INDICATING THAT AS WELL 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IT'S IT' ACTUALLY SIX WHAT IS IT 
SO AT THREE MONTHS I THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THEY'RE THEY'RE THREE MONTH CONTRACTS AND NOW IF YOU CAN'T KEEP THAT THAT'S FINE 
BUT IT'S JUST A LOGISTIC THING WITH PERSONNEL WHERE WHERE WE UH THAT WAS THE MINIMUM WE WERE ABLE TO OFFER A CONTRACT FOR 
SO IF YOU HAVE TO BOW OUT LET US KNOW AS SOON AS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STOP 
YEAH YEAH OBVIOUSLY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE THINGS WE'LL HAVE TO WORK AROUND BUT UM YEAH IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE DETAILS 
MM-HMM 
I SHOULD THINK SO 
I MEAN THE WHOLE POINT WE OF KEEPING WELL AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO YEAH 
WORK TO USE OF YOUR COMPUTER WITH THE OTHER PERSON THAT'S FINE YEAH 
THE THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING M REGULAR HOURS WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEBODY WAS HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS 
BUT YOU'VE GOT KEYS SO SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IN DURING ODD HOURS IF IF YOU WANTED TO WORK 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH I DON'T SEE WHY NOT AS LONG AS YOU'RE YOU KNOW DOING YOUR GIVEN SET OF HOURS FOR THE WIKI 
YEAH 
AND UM YEAH 
PAYM I I THINK YOU'LL ALL BE PAID 
I THINK YOU'LL ALL BE PAID UH WILL HAVE YOU NOT 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
REALLY 
NO THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT NECESSARY 
MM NO 
WELL IT 
IF YOU HAVE ANY THE PROBLEMS LIKE THAT MM UM SEE CAROLINE HASTINGS 
I MEAN IF IT'S FOR THIS JOB AND AND GETTING PAID THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARY AND CAROLINE HASTINGS OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU SORT THAT IT 
BUT J ALSO IF IF PAY IS A MATTER UM LIKE IF IT'S A MATTER THAT YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN PAID FOR SOME REASON 
UM I HOPE THAT'S NOT NOT THE CASE 
MM-HMM 
TALK TO CAROLINE 
YEAH 'CAUSE I'VE I REALLY DON'T KNOW UM WHY THAT WOULD BE 
I'M HERE FULL TIME NOW SO I'LL I'LL BE HERE M MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AND I LI I LOVE IT FOR NOW 
SO YOU WON'T FIND ME ANYTIME AFTER THAT 
BUT 
YEAH MY HUSBAND'S AT HOME WITH THE BABY

OH GOOD THAT WORKED OUT WELL 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
FIND REPLACE YEAH 
UH-HUH 
OH YEAH 
HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU WANT UM I HAD A FEW TIMES WHERE I THOUGHT WELL IT COULD BE THIS 
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT IT COULD BE 'CAUSE IT C IT COULD BE A COMBINATION OF SOMETHING ELSE 
LIKE PUT THE GUESS DOWN OR LEAVE IT AS AMBIGUOUS IN SOME WAY 
RIGHT 
THERE'S A CHANCE THEY COULD BE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING SO FAR 
IT TOOK LI IT LIKE THE THIRD TIME 'TIL I THOUGHT UH YOU'RE SAYING F. FIVE 
IT JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE 
BUT IF THERE'S A CHANCE THAT IT'S EQUALLY LIKELY THAT THEY COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING OR THEY COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING LIKE ICE CREAM AND I SCREAM 
THEN JUST CHOOSE ONE AND LEAVE IT RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
WE JUST STARTED OR SPEECH RECOGNITION ASSIGNMENT JUST NOW 
YOU'RE IN S. L. P. PERSON 
YOU SURVIVED S. P. ONE AND S. P. TWO 
WE HAVE TWO NEW TEACHERS FOR S. P. TWO 
AND UH I'LL ASK YOU LATER ON LIKE IF YOU STILL HAVE YOUR NOTES 
MM THE HYPH 
AND YOU ONLY USE THE HYPHEN I THINK WHEN THE SENTENCE IS DEFINITELY NOT CONTINUING ANYWHERE 
SO IN LIKE IT'S 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
IT WAS THE CREAKY VOICE 
CREAKY VOICE 
BUT IT IS C REALLY CONNECTED TO THE WORD 
CAN WE HEAR IT AGAIN 
FROM THE 
FROM THE 
AND SOMETIMES WITH THE I WOULD BE THINKING ARE YOU ANTICIPATING A R YOU'RE YOU T TRYING TO SAY THE AND YOU'RE JUST SAYING THE THE THE THE THE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
I TRY TO TAKE CONSISTENCY IF THEY ALWAYS STRESS THE WRONG PART OF THE WORD 
THEN I THINK OKAY I'LL LET THAT ONE BUT IF IF IT COMES OUT AND LIKE ONE WORD IS 
OH 
WELL AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE A LECTURER THAT CAN I CAN NEVER QUITE S TELL IF HE'S SAYING PROBLEM OR PROGRAMME 
PROGRAMME PROBLEM 
AND IT I CAN'T ACTUALLY SAY BUT WHEN I'M LISTENING TO I'M THINKING AND I CAN'T TELL 
HOPE HE'S NOT INVOLVED WITH THIS ACTUALLY 
I HOPE HE'S NOT INVOLVED WITH THIS 
THAT'LL GIVE SOME TRANSCRIBER A HEADACHE 
IT'S EASY TO 'CAUSE YOU'RE IS USED TO TO T TUNING THEM OUT 
AND YOU KNOW IT'S EASY WHEN I GO BACK OVER I NORMALLY G LIKE GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING 
DO A QUICK PASS OF THE MAIN SECTIONS AGAIN AND THINK UH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT THE FIRST DAY AS WELL 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO IF THEY PAUSE JUST WHERE YOU'VE GOT IT HIGHLIGHTED AT THE MOMENT 
THAT WERE THE HYPHEN 
SO I HAVE TO OR DO THE MEETINGS FROM THE MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING 
WAS SHE WAS THAT A LIKE WE ARE REAL DEFINITE I'M STARTING A NEW SENTENCE HERE 
'CAUSE I'D SOMETIME IF IT SOUNDS LIKE UH COULD CARRY ON SAYING THE WHOLE SENTENCE I SOMETIMES DON'T HAVE A HYPHEN THERE 
BUT IS IT A AT ANY HESITATION 
OKAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
YEAH

OH YEAH 
ABSOLUTELY 
MORE 
IT'S USUALLY A CONTEXT PROBLEM BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES IF IT'S NOT INTELLIGIBLE YOU EITHER TEND TO BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT TO TO FIT THE CONTEXT 
UM YOU TEND TO TAKE THE CLOSEST ACTUAL WORD THAT WOULD FIT THE CONTEXT 
OR IF IT SOMETIMES IT SOUNDS VERY CLEAR AS A WORD ITSELF BUT THEN WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL 
AND THEN YOU M QUESTION YOU KNOW SECOND GUESS WHETHER IT'S REALLY WHAT YOU HEARD 
MM 
HMM 
BE ROBUST 
THAT'S ALWAYS FUN 
I'VE DONE THAT IT 
OH NEVER I I DON'T WANNA INTERRUPT IT 
UH UH WHEN I DID MY MASTERS UM I TAKE UH S. P. ONE AND S. P. TWO WITH SIMON KING 
YES 
AND ACTUALLY I'VE DONE QUITE WELL IN S. P. ONE I'VE DONE IT A BIT WORSE IN S. P. TWO BECAUSE IT WAS A L A LOT MORE CHALLENGING 
OKAY 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
BACK TO THE TOPIC 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY THE ONLY CASE WHERE YOU DON'T AREA WHERE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO CAPITALISE RIGHT 
SO IF IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THE SENTENCE IS BEING CARRIED ON THE P YOU KNOW 
THE SENTENCE FROM THE PREVIOUS SEGMENT IS BEING CARRIED ON THEN THAT'S WHEN YOU DON'T CAPITALISE 
OTHERWISE YOU DO 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND YOU SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW REALLY WHETHER IT'S A MIC NOISE OR THAT PERSON IS MAKING THAT NOISE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND HOW EXACT DO WE HAVE TO BE THERE 
BECAUSE UM YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE TEND TO STUTTER MORE THAN OTHERS AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE A FALSE START FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN A ROW 
AND HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO LISTEN TO TO REALLY UNTIL YOU'VE GOT THE EXACT NUMBER OF A THINGS RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL 'CAUSE SOMETIMES THEY GO YOU KNOW LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHETHER IT'S THREE TIMES OR FOUR YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WELL IT'S NOT THAT THE WORD IS OF THE WORD WERE THE WHOLE WORD WERE BEING USED FOUR TIMES 
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT DIFFICULT BUT SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A FALSE START 
WHICH IS REALLY JUST MAYBE ONE OR ONE AND A HALF PHONES AND THEN REPEATED AND THEN YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHETHER ONE IS A LONG DURATION OF ONE OR WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY TWO 
AND THAT KIND OF THING IS IT'S I THINK IT WAS A WORD STARTING WITH D. AND THE PERSON WAS GOING OR SO YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
WELL SPEAKING ABOUT 
SPEAKING ABOUT ROBUSTNESS IF IF SOMEBODY HAS AN ACCENT THAT YOU CAN ONLY REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING DUE TO WORLD KNOWLEDGE YEAH IT WHAT THEY SAY 
IT DOESN'T REALLY ACTUALLY SOUND AT ALL YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS 
THEN DO YOU TRANSCRIBE MORE PHONETICALLY OR DO YOU PUT UH UH A STAR OF AFTER EVERY SINGLE ONE WORD 
OR 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT THAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT BUT UM THE ONE THERE'S NO I'M TRANSCRIBING RIGHT NOW 
YOU KNOW A WHOLE BATCH OF DIALOGUES WHERE UH ALL FOUR PARTICIPANTS ARE NON NATIVE 
AND THERE'S ESPECIALLY IN THERE THAT UM I THINK HE'S EASTERN EUROPEAN AND I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING AT ALL 
BECAUSE I'M EASTERN EUROPEAN AND UH BUT IF WE WOULD JUST PLAY IT I THINK IT A RECOGNIZER 
THEN WHAT HE SAYS YOU KNOW THE WAY HE REALISES WORDS SOUNDS NOTHING AT ALL LOOK AT IT SHOULD BE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO IT'S LESS OF A SO IT'S LESS OF A STRESS 
IT'S REALLY LIKE UH HAS UH I DON'T KNOW JUST THE PHONEMES SOUNDING DIFFERENTLY 
WELL YOU CAN'T REALLY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE ALL OF IT 
OH 
YEAH 
UH I THINK I'VE TRANSCRIBED HIM AND I HAD PROJECT AT ALL UM EVALUATION CRITERIA 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
AND ONE GUY WHO WAS SAYING EVOLUTION EACH TIME HE MEANT EVALUATION AND IT TOOK ME A WHOLE DIALOGUE YEAH YEAH 
YEAH BUT THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING I WOULD ALWAYS TRANSCRIBE IT YOU KNOW FOR LACK OF BETTER KNOWLEDGE OR LACK OF CONTEXT 
AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DIALOGUE IT DAWNED ON UM THAT UH ACTUALLY MEANT EVALUATION 
AND THEN I WENT BACK AND REPLACED I REPLACED IT IN THE WHOLE TRANSCRIPTION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BASICALLY THE I THINK JUST DO YOUR BEST AND HOPE FOR THE BEST 
WELL WE HAVE BOTH HEAD SET AND LAPEL TRANSCRIPTION 
SO IT'S NOT TOO BAD 
YEAH LET'S HAVE MAARIKA TRANSCRIBE THAT 
MM-HMM 
UM SORRY I'M JUST USING THIS WITH THE T. V. THERE IS T. UNDERSCORE V. UNDERSCORE 
I THOUGHT WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO USE THE UNDERSCORE BETWEEN LETTERS 
NO 
OKAY SORRY THEN I'VE DONE IT WRONG AS FAR 
OKAY 
BUT IT IS A BACK TRACK 
YEAH I THINK IF IT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW NOT EVEN MAYBE IT WILL 
IF I TH IF YOU THINK IF IT IN TERMS OF A SYNTACTIC TREE 
IT IN DOESN'T HAVE TO GO BACK ALL THE WAY TO THE S. NODE 
BUT IT JUST UM IT MIGHT GO BACK TO THE LAST NODE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
WELL IT'S JUST MY WAY OF OF KNOWING IF IT W SORRY 'CAUSE LINGUISTICS IS ALL I'VE EVER KNOWN 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WHERE 
OH ET CETERA 
SO IT ONE WORD OR IS IT TWO WORDS 
OKAY 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO L 
BUT IN SH IT ISN'T IT IN LATIN LIKE ET CETERA LIKE ET ALII OR 
NO NO NO LIKE IT W YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE UH WHEN YOU HAVE A CITATION AND YOU SAY IT L IT MEANS AND OTHERS 
ET ET AL ET ALII IS THE FULL WORD AND ET CETERA MEANS AND FOLLOWING 
SO 
YEAH 
OH NO IT IS OKAY YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I THINK 
YEAH 
I THINK I IF SOMEBODY COULD WRITE I DON'T KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE IN PRACTICE TO WRITE A SCRIPT THAT WOULD IGNORE UM ALL THE WORD FRAGMENTS 
ANYTHING WITH A HYPHEN 
THEN A SPELL CHECK MIGHT MAKE MAKE SENSE 
BUT UH IT JUST USE SIMPLE EMACS IT WILL UH BASICALLY MARK UM ALL THE WORD FRAGMENTS FOR YOU AND UH YOU KNOW 
AND I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE AT SOME POINT YOU ALSO GET NEGLIGENT 
YOU JUST CLICK OKAY OKAY OKAY YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT A MISTAKE AND THEN YOU MIGHT MISS A REAL ERROR 
SO IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT AS AS A ACTUAL FULL WORD SHOULDN'T IT THERE B SHOULDN'T THERE BE A SPACE BETWEEN US AND THE HYPHEN 
YOU KNOW NOT TO BE NOT TO BE PEDANTIC 
AFTER THE ON THE THE C. AND THE HYPHEN SHOULDN'T THERE BE A SPACE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
UM THE WILD AND WE 
NO 
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE SAYING WELL OR WOULD 
YEAH UH IT IT'S HIS YEAH 
BUT IF IF IT'S NOT CLEAR DO I JUST PICK UH DO YOU JUST PICK THE MORE GRAMMATIC ALTERNATIVE 
OR 
B YEAH 
BUT IF IT BUT IF IT'S REALLY NOT ABSOLUTELY NOT CLEAR 
WHEN THEY SAY INSTEA YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY SWALLOW UP THE THE LAST BUT 
OR DO WE JUST THEN TRANSCRIBE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
THE UM SHOULD BE CAPITALISED 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OH OKAY 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM OKAY SO WHAT ABOUT OF A WHOLE UTTERANCE IS UTTERED WHILE LAUGHING 
DO YOU PUT THE LAUGHTER IN FRONT 
OR ON WHAT I SEE WHEN THAT HAPPENS WHAT I DO SO I PUT LAUGHTER IN FRONT 
THEN THE WHOLE SENTENCE AND LAUGHTER IN YOU KNOW AT THE END AS WELL 
SO 
YEAH 
NO BUT IT'S IT'S LAUGHTER TH THROUGHOUT 
YEAH 
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE LAUGHING THEMSELVES SILLY AT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHILE WHILE THEY SPEAK 
MM-HMM 
BECAUSE IN THE ICSI DIALOGUES UM THEY ALWAYS SAY YOU KNOW WHILE LAUGHING AND WE DON'T DO THAT 
SO THEY SAY THERE IS THERE IT'S REALLY NOT AMBIGUOUS WHETHER IT'S JUST LAUGH FOLLOWED BY IN A NORMALLY SPOKEN UTTERANCE OR WHETHER IT'S AN UTTERANCE SPOKEN WHILE LAUGHING 
I THINK THERE IS A DISTINCTION THERE AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT 
YEAH 
'KAY 
MORSE CODE 
MORSE 
YEAH 
BUT THEN I W BUT THEN I WOULDN'T PUT AN ASTERISK ON IT 
I THOUGHT ASTERISK IS SOMETHING WHERE UM IT'S C IT'S PRONOUNCED AS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WORD LIKE EVALUATION AND EVALUATION 
NO 
OKAY 
OH 
YEAH CAUSE I THIS IS A VERY FREQUENT MISTAKE THAT N NATIVE SPEAKERS MAKE IT SAY CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF CIRCUIT 
MM 
MM 
SO PUSH BUTTONS TWO WORDS 
I USED ONE WORD 
OKAY 
WELL IT COULD BE SHE WOULD OR SHOULD AS WELL 
YEAH 
MM 
I HAVEN'T EITHER 
IT'S JUST TOO SILLY 
I'M JUST THINKING OF UH YOU KNOW AN UTTERANCE CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF LAUGHTER AND THEN PUTTING LIKE PUNCTUATION IN LIKE 
SORRY 
YEAH BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS REALLY JUST SILENCE AND YOU'RE ASKING THE PERSON TO JUST GET RID OF 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
OH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
JUST TO MAKE SENSE OF A SENTENCE 
WHAT DOES CUTEST SPELLING MEAN 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
OH 
WELL IF YOU WERE COCKNEY THEN SORRY 
A. OR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WITH SOME PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY LEADS TO SOME REALLY SCREECHING NOISES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO LOUD OR PROBABLY THE MIC IS IS CLOSE 
I HAD THIS ONE UM IN ONE OF THE FIRST DIALOGUES I DID THE AGE THIS GUY CALLED ED 
YOU COULD UH ALWAYS USE THE WAVEFORM ACTUALLY YOU KNOW 
BEING JUST HITTING UM THE B THE BOUNDARIES ON ON BOTH ENDS AND JUST BEING AT SOME POINTS JUST BLACK SEGMENTS 
AND WHEN HE WAS TALKING THERE WAS THIS WHOLE LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SPEAK TO CLOSE TO A MICROPHONE AND THAT WAS REALLY HORRIBLE 
THE REST 
HMM 
MISTER ED 
UH I HAD ONE GUY ONE OF THE PROJECT MANAGERS WAS UM UH HAD A REALLY WEIRD ACCENT AND HE WAS CALLING UM ONE GUY MISTER ED 
HIS NAME WAS AUDIO AND IT TOOK ME A WHOLE TIME TO YOU FIND OUT THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY MISTER ED 
OR 
YEAH 
NO BUT THAT IT WASN'T ONE WORD THAT IT WASN'T LIKE SOME PROPER NAME STARTING WITH M. 
YEAH 
WELL BUT DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE UM HAVE THIS DATA 
KNOW THE PEOPLE NA PEOPLE'S NAMES LIKE WHEN YOU 
COLLECT THE DATA TH AREN'T PEOPLE FILLING OUT A FORM OR SOMETHING 
OKAY 
YEAH 
NO BUT IT'S INFORMATION THAT WE THEORETICALLY HAVE 
MM 
WE DIDN'T SIGN ONE 
MM-HMM 
MISTER JUST TO 
YEAH 
NO M. 
UM U. S. MI MISSUS THE MISSUS 
WHAT IF SOMEBODY CALLS THEMSELVES MS 
I MEAN IT'S NOT NOT THAT IT EVER HAPPENED BUT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH SO EVEN IF WE KNOW WHAT THAT WORD MEANS WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 'CAUSE I HAVE THERE IS ON DIALOGUE WHERE I THINK TWO SPEAKERS ARE FRENCH LIKE ONE IS DEFINITELY FRENCH 
AND I KNOW SHE IS SAYING AND THEN SOMEBODY S SAYING SOMETHING TO HERE AND SHE GOES COMMENT AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THAT IS YEAH 
UH NOT REALLY BUT ON COMMENT YEAH 
OK 
NO 
OKAY

THEIR OWN 
PROBABLY 
YEAH I CAN HEAR THE CHAIRS MOVING AND THE 
YEAH 
UH THE WHITE BOARD MARKER HAS A CAMERA AS WELL 
M. 
NO WELL APOSTROPHE AND THEN K. A. Y. 
THAT MARKER SMELLS REALLY BAD 
IT PROBABLY BECAME ADDICTED TO THE FUMES 
OVER A MINUTE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO IF SOMETHING IS A MINUTE AND THREE SECONDS I CAN STILL HAVE TO RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
UM IF YOU JUST CLICK ON ONE OF THE ARROWS 
UM IN IN THE RESOLUTION THINGY UM IT WILL 
YEAH IN THIS ONE 
NO NOT NOT THE OTHER IN THIS ONE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH AND YOU CAN ALSO IF YOU GO TO SIGNAL AND 
UM THAT'S IT'S SOMETHING UNDER SIGNAL WHERE YOU CAN ADJUST THE AMPLITUDE AS WELL ON RESOLUTION 
UM 
THEN YOU CAN ALSO WAIT 
NO I THINK THAT'S NOT IF YOU GO TO CONTROL PANEL 
SIGNAL CONTROL PANEL 
NO NO SIGNAL CONTROL PAN 
UM THE VERTICAL ZOOM YOU CAN ADJUST THAT AS WELL SO IF IT SEEMS TO FLAT FOR YOU ARE YOU CAN'T REALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
WELL I DON'T KNOW BUT I KNOW ABOUT THIS FOR THE SUMMARISATION I HAVEN'T DONE THIS WITH UH TRANSCRIPTION YET 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UM I'VE GOT A THREE MONTH CONTRACT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM 
EXCUSE ME 
YEAH I HAVEN'T GOTTEN PAID FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS 'CAUSE UM I W I ONLY HAVE A THREE MONTH CONTRACT STARTING FEBRUARY BUT I STARTED MID JANUARY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
SO YOUR HUSBAND NOW A STAY AT HOME DAD 
HE'S SLEEPING THROUGH 
YEAH 
FIVE YEARS JUST BECAUSE OF THE FLOODS BRINGING THE CEILINGS DOWN 
SO ON ITS GREAT JOY 
I THINK THEY PROBABLY OUGHT TO BUT UH THEY WILL 
THEY'VE ONLY JUST STARTED REALISING THAT TREATING THIS IS A LEGAL ISSUE IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT WAY TO LOOK AT IT 
SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE UP FOR UNDERSTANDING UM THE INTRICACIES OF THE COMMITTEE I GUESS 
I MEAN I YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY COULD BUT IT'S OR IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE HARD WORK 
THE LOW ISN'T VERY CLEAR 
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION 
THEY P THEY UH THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
IT'S JUST IT'S SO STRAPPED NOW UM YOU KNOW 
LIKE THE CITIZENS ADVICE BUREAU IS IS HARD TO ACTUALLY GET ACCESS TO BECAUSE THEY'VE THEY HAVE SO MANY CASES AND SO FEW PEOPLE 
SO BUT YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY THE NEXT THING THEY'LL HAVE TO DO 
UM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
WELL UM I THOUGHT THE RIGHT THING TO DO WAS TO REVIEW WHAT WEI XUN'S BEEN DOING IN THE AREA OF DIALOGUE STRUCTURE FOR WORK PACKAGE ONE OVER THE LAST PERIOD 
SO BASICALLY FOR HIM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT UH WHAT PROGRESS HE'S BEEN MAKING AND THEN FOR US TO AIM FOR UH FOR HIM TO DESCRIBE WHAT WORK HE INTENDS OVER THE NEXT PERIOD OF THE PROJECT 
AND FOR US TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HELP HE NEEDS WITH THAT 
UM M MAYBE GIVE HIM SOME HELP FIGURING OUT WHAT PUBLICATIONS HE'S GONNA UM GET OUT OF THIS AND FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT IT FITS INTO THE OVERALL PROJECT 
SO UM THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA DO EVERYTHING TODAY 
BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SORT OF ALL ALIGNED ON WHAT HE WAS DOING AT THE MOMENT AND AND THEN SORT OF FIGURED OUT HOW TO GIVE HIM THE BEST ADVICE COMING UP 
SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY I CALLED THIS 
I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED 
SO UM WHEN YOU SAY INTERACTIVITY DO YOU MEAN UM WELL HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERISE A HIGHLY INTERACTIVE MEETING 
WHAT ARE THE MEASUREMENTS YOU'D APPLY 
SO YOU I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS SEGMENTING MEETINGS INTO HIGHLY INTERACTIVE PARTS AND NOT SO INTERACTIVE PARTS 
WHERE YOU THINK SOME OF THEM OR LIKE A BIT LIKE DIALOGUE AND SOME OR A BIT LIKE MONOLOGUE 
SO WHAT MEASUREMENTS WOULD YOU APPLY TO ME FIND OUT WHICH IS WHICH 
SO YOU MEAN RELATIVELY SHORT TURNS AND SPEAKER CHANGE 
SO 
SO SO UM I RIGHT IN THINKING YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN SEGMENT MEETINGS MAYBE NOT TWO T TYPES OF AREAS INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE 
SO WHAT ARE THE WHITE OR THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INTERACTIVE AREAS 
SO WE S OKAY SO BUT YOU JUST SAID I THINK THAT YOU WOULD CHARACTERISE SHORT TURNS AS BEING THE NON INTERACTIVE PARTS 
OH OKAY WELL WE WE CAN DISCOUNT BACK CHANNELS 
I MEAN UH C ARE YOU USE IT OKAY IF WE TALK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE 'CAUSE I'M CONFUSED 
OR OR DO YOU GOT A C 
ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
'CAUSE IF THIS IS ALL WE'VE GOT 
I THINK WE SHOULD UH HAVE INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE ON THE BOARD AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT PROPERTIES GOING TO CHE JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR WHAT THE TWO MAIN 
OH 
WELL UH OKAY 
BUT ARE YOU YOU NEED TO BE MORE PRECISE WHAT YOU MEAN BY SPEAKER CHANGE 
SO YOU DO YOU MEAN ALL OF THE SPEAKERS ARE INVOLVED IN IT 
SO IT SUFFICIENT FOR TWO SPEAKERS 
RIGHT AND THEN 
OKAY BUT THAT'S ONE YOU CAN THAT'S DEFINITIONAL RIGHT 
SO SO I MEAN YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY CONSIDER THAT TO CHANGE THE TRAINS 
THESE ARE JUST BACK CHANNELS 
SO ONE SPEAKER WILL HAVE THE FLOOR CHANNEL UM THROUGHOUT THAT AND SO I GUESS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE INTERACTIVE SECTIONS WOULD HAVE SHORTER SPEAKER TURNS WHEN YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERING THE BACK CHANNELS AS INTERRUPTIONS 
UM SO 
WELL DO YOU 
YEAH 
SUFFICIENT BUT NOT NECESSARY MAYBE 
IT DEPEND IF YOU HAD AS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ALL JUST GIVING INFORMATION AND OPINION AROUND THE TABLE AND THEY NEVER ACTUALLY ASK QUESTIONS OF EACH OTHER 
BUT THE TURNS WERE ACTUALLY QUITE SHORT WHICH ONE WOULD TO BE 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT OKAY 
I REMEMBER YOU SAYING THIS BEFORE 
SO BASICALLY YOU WANT TO DO THE SEGMENTATION BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANALYSES TO THE TWO SECTIONS 
UM 
RIGHT 
SO WEI XUN QUITE TAKES QUITE A STRONG POSITION ON UM THIS M DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO UM KINDS OF GROUP ACTIVITIES BECAUSE HE SAYS THAT THEY ADMIT DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANALYSIS 
RIGHT THE WITH THE NON INTERACTIVE MORE MONOLO MONO LOGIC SECTIONS OF THE MEETING UM YOU HAVE TO UH ANALYSE THEM USING SOMETHING AKIN TO RHETORICAL STRUCTURE OR SOMETHING 
AND UH WITH THE OTHER SECTIONS YOU UH UM YOU YOU USE SOME OTHER THEORY TO LOOK AT THEM 
AND I ACTUALLY UH THINK THAT THAT'S A SLIGHTLY EXTREME UM POSITION UM WITH REGARD TO THE LITERATURE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHO THE DIFFERENT SPEAKERS ARE IN AN INTERACTIVE SECTION 
YOU CAN STILL UM BUILD MAYBE THE THE SAME ARGUMENT STRUCTURE OVER THE TOP OF THE BASIC UM ACTS AND PROPOSITIONAL CONTENT THAT'S THERE 
AND UH WHAT YOU GOT IS A MESSIER VERSION OF THE ARGUMENT STRUCTURE BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME ARGUMENT IN THEIR BRAIN YOU KNOW FOR THIS 
BUT UM BUT THAT THE SAME THEORY OR THE THE SAME ANALYSIS CAN BE APPLIED TO BOTH PARTS 
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP ME THAT IN MIND 
AND IF YOU IF YOU DO NEED TO ARGUE THAT THESE TWO KINDS OF GROUP ACTIVITIES UH CAN CAN ONLY BE ANALYSED IF YOU USE DIFFERENT ANALYTICAL MECHANISMS 
THEN YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS 
RIGHT SO IT IT PUTS AN EXTRA BURDEN OF PROOF ON THE WORK THAT YOU DO 
MM 
RIGHT 
BUT AT THE GROU DEGREE THAT A GROUP IS BUILDING AN ARGUMENT TOGETHER 
I MEAN IT I THINK WH WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN A GROUP DISCUSSION ISN'T NECESSARILY ONE COHERENT ARGUMENT F FOR THE PERSON 
BUT AN ARGUMENT THAT IS THE GROUP VIEW 
AND SO IT'S MAYBE IT'S NOT R. S. T. UM BUT IT'S M MORE AKIN TO UM I DON'T KNOW IS IT TOOLMAN 
BUT YOU KNOW NOT THAT I BUT YOU KNOW THE KINDS OF THINGS WHERE PEOPLE TO TRY TO REPRESENT ARGUMENT STRUCTURE 
OR OR THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF IT FOR THIS ANALYSIS REALLY THAT SUBSTANTIVELY DIFFERENT THOUGH 
BUT I IF SOMEBODY IF THERE'S BEEN AN ARGUMENT SO FAR IN A GROUP MEETING 
AND UM SOMEBODY MAKES A STATEMENT THEY HAVE AN INTENTION ABOUT HOW TO MODIFY THAT GROUP ARGUMENT 
RIGHT BUT BUT YOU'RE 
OKAY SO THE OR THE RELATION NAMES AREN'T AREN'T RIGHT BUT UM 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
WELL THE RELATION NAMES OR LESS IMPORTANT 
I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE ARGUED FOR AGES ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT RELATIONS WERE IN ANY OF THESE THEORIES 
AND THAT'S THAT'S LESS IMPORTANT THAN WHAT THE THEORY IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE 
AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE TWO DIF SEPARATE APPARATUSES FOR THE UM SPEAKER INTERNAL UM ARGUMENT STRUCTURE AND THE GROUP ARGUMENT STRUCTURE 
THAT THAT'S MORE APPARA APPARATUS THEN YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY NEED FOR ME FROM DOING THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS 
'CAUSE IN BOTH CASES YOU'RE UM BUILDING UP AN ARGUMENT PUBLICLY IN THIS GROUP MEETING AND THEN YOU KNOW 
ADDING SOMETHING OR CHANGING THE EXISTING ARGUMENT IN SOME WAY BY RELATING A CONTRIBUTION TO WHAT'S UM ALREADY ON THE TABLE 
SO 
MM 
YEAH C I JUST THINK WELL I MEAN IT ALL OF THESE THINGS WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER A NEW GENRE OF UM IF UH ACTUAL DATA 
THEN THEY END UP MODIFYING BUILDING NEW KINDS OF RELATIONS WITH NEW KINDS OF SEMANTICS AND ADDING THEM 
THAT'S THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THIS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM YEAH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
SO THERE YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY WHO'S DOING THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD CLAIM THAT YOU DON'T NEED TWO SEPARATE AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS FOR THESE TWO TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT WEI XUN HAS IDENTIFIED 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I JUST PREFER TO TO BE ONE THING RATHER THAN TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE THINGS AND THEN THE ADDED EXPLANATION OF WHY IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE SAME THING APPLIED TO BOTH HALVES 
HMM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WHICH WOULDN'T PROBABLY WOULDN'T GIVE US THE KIND OF UM INFORMATION THAT WE NEED ABOUT RELATIONS ACROSS TURNS 
JUST BECAUSE WE REALLY ARE CRITICALLY INTERESTED IN THE ARGUMENT UM THAT THE GROUP IS BUILDING UP SO THAT WE CAN FIND THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MADE AND UM ANY P UH COUNTER PROPOSALS TO PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND THINGS 
I MEAN IT REALLY IS MORE ON THE SEPARATE UH OF THE R. S. T. ISH RELATIONS THAN UM THEN ON THE DAMSEL KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS 
WHAT WE WANT UH OUT OF THE C UM THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SPEAKERS HERE 
THEY ARE JOINTLY BUILDING UP AN ARGUMENT STRUCTURE 
AND THAT IS THE CRITICAL THING THAT WE'RE MISSING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ME UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE MEETINGS 
SO WE WOULDN'T WE WOULDN'T WANNA DO THE SAME THING IS WHAT UM SHE DID IN THIS CASE 
BEC JUST BECAUSE UM DAMSEL DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT SORT OF REPRESENTATION BETWEEN SPEAKERS 
UH DOES IT 
OKAY UM I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN THAT THIS KIND OF DATA 
SO MAYBE 
RIGHT OKAY BUT OR WHAT I MEAN SO YOU KNO WANNA MAKE SURE YOU GET THE ARGUMENTATIVE RELATIONS HOWEVER YOU DO IT 
WHICHEVER RELATIONS YOU HAVE TO BUILD YOU KNOW 
NOT I'M NOT SAYING I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR SET OF TAGS OR RELATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFINED OUT THERE THAT ARE THE RIGHT ONES 
I'M JUST SAYING WE NEED THE CORRECT ONES FOR THE THE STRUCTURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS 
'CAUSE WE NEED CERTAIN INFORMATION OUT OF THIS ANALYSIS 
THAT 
YEAH 
WELL WEI XUN'S BEEN LOOKING AT THE DATA 
SO THAT'S THAT'S A STEP FOR THIS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM YEAH 
WELL WHAT YOU'LL NEED ON THE END IS SOMETHING OPERATIONAL 
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN USE IT ACTUALLY SEGMENT MEETINGS INTO THE UM THE AREAS THAT YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR THIS ANALYSIS RIGHT 
SO UM IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR TO UM WHAT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ARE 
SO IT WOULD BE I THINK HANDY IF YOU COULD TAKE A MEETING AT SOME POINT AND SAY YOU KNOW 
THIS IS A INTERACTIVE AREA AND THIS IS A MONO LOGIC AREA BECAUSE AND WE COULD COME UP WITH WHAT KINDS OF MEASUREMENTS YOU NEED 
UM I MEAN WE HAVE WE WE HAVEN'T DONE PAST WORK HERE ON SEGMENTING MEETINGS IN THAT WAY 
BUT WE HAVE DONE WORK ON CHARACTERISING DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEETINGS UM IN TERMS OF HOW HIGHLY INTERACTIVE THEY ARE 
BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT DEFINITION RIGHT 
IT'S IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE MEETING UM TAKE SOME TAKE EQUAL PART IN IT AS OPPOSED TO ME LIKE THE HIGHEST STATE IS PEOPLE IN THE MEETING JUST DRIVING IT AND AND UH THE OTHER PEOPLE FOLLOWING WHATEVER THE HIGH STATE IS PEOPLE WANT 
SO UM BUT THOSE KINDS OF MEASURES UM YOU KNOW 
WE COULD USE TO ME TO DO THIS KIND OF SEGMENTATION IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE ANALYSIS RIGHT 
W BUT WE NEED CLEARER DEFINITIONS OF WHAT THE DIFFERENT THINGS OR HOW MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF OF UM ACTIVITIES ARE THERE 
YOU KNOW IS IT JUST INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE OR IS THERE ARE THREE THREE MORE GRADES OF SHADING THAN THAT 
AND UM YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU EXPECT ON EACH 
WHAT'S THE BACK CHANNELLING BEHAVIOUR 
WHAT'S THE SPEAKER TURN UM YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF DIALOGUE ACTS DO YOU EXPECT 
I THINK THAT WOULD HELP YOU PIN DOWN WHAT THE DEFINITIONS ARE 
DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS WHETHER SOMETHING IS KNOWLEDGE OR OPINION ON THE WAY IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROUP PROCESS 
YEAH 
I I SORT OF HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN THE VIEW THAT UM THAT WILL PEOPLE AREN'T VERY GOOD TO TO THIS KIND OF RATIONALITY YOU KNOW 
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION AND OPINION ISN'T THAT PROMINENT IN THE WAY PEOPLE DO THEIR REASONING 
SO UM 
YEAH 
WELL Y YOU CAN'T DEFINE 'EM THAT WAY 
YOU CAN'T DEFINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION AND OPINION THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT'S UM BASICALLY DEFINING AS THE WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT IT 
AND I THINK WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN IS THAT UM IF PEOPLE CHALLENGE THE THE FACTS 
YOU OFTEN DISCOVER THAT THEY WEREN'T ACTUALLY SOLID FACTS ANYWAY YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE I THINK THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THIS IS KIND OF FLUID 
SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS IT IMPORTANT TO WHAT WHAT'S IT IMPORTANT TO 
SO DO YOU NEED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION AND OPINION TO DO THIS ANALYSIS 
SO WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING AT 
SO YOU'RE YOU'VE GOT BOOKS THAT HIGH IN YOUR DESK 
WHICH ONES ARE THEY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
SO YOU UM I'M SORT OF GETTING THAT YOU THINK THERE IS A LOCK ON THE UH THEORY TO DO WITH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE AT THE MOMENT 
BUT I'M BUT I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR YET WHAT YOU THINK THE LACK IS 
SO 
UM THE WALL OR YOU THINKING IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE READ THIS LITERATURE 
BUT I MEAN MY UNDERSTANDING OF EXCHANGE IS IS THAT THE INITIATING MOVE INTRODUCES A GOAL TO THE DISCOURSE 
AND THEN THE REMAINING MOVES UM WELL UH CONTRIBUTE TO EITHER THE UM THE MEETING OF THAT DISCOURSE GOAL OR THE DECISION NOT TO BOTHER WITH THAT DISCOURSE GOAL 
RIGHT 
AND SO UM I'D BE SURPRISED IF THERE WASN'T WORK DESCRIBING 
THINGS IN THOSE TERMS 
I MEAN I KNOW SINCLAIR AND COULTHARD IS IS BASICALLY ABOUT TEACHING YEAH 
SO YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT TO NECESSARILY UM APPLY UH IN IN WIDER CONTACTS IN A WAY 
LIKE YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO HAVE TO EXTEND THE THEORY TO DO THAT 
BUT I TH I THINK THERE ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT EXCHANGE STRUCTURE AND DESCRIBED IT IN THOSE TERMS IN A WAY THAT SHOULD REALLY SUIT YOUR NEEDS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO THIS IS A L A LOT LIKE GEORGE HORTON'S WORK ON SAYING WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS FOR UM THESE EXCHANGES 
YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT CHARACTERISE THE SET OF EXCHANGES THAT CAN HAPPEN 
MM 
SO IS IS YOUR COMPLAINT LESS BUT UM LESS ABOUT KNOWING WHAT MAKES AN EXCHANGE AND MORE ABOUT KNOWING HOW YOU PARAMETERISE EXCHANGES FOR THIS GENRE 
SO WHAT'S THE RANGE 
OKAY SO YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S THE RANGE OF EXCHANGE TYPES FOR THIS GENRE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK HASN'T BEEN DONE 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
THAT'S CLEARER 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO SO HAVE HAVE YOU TRIED I MEAN UM I KNOW IF ONE PREVIOUS ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH WHAT EXCHANGES ARE NEEDED FOR OF UM SOME KINDS OF INDUSTRY MEETINGS 
AND OUR EXPERIENCE IN THAT PROJECT WAS THAT UM YOU CAN'T REALLY IDENTIFY EXCHANGE STRUCTURES IN THESE MEETINGS BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T REALLY FOLLOW THAT PATTERN 
THAT EXCHANGES ARE CLEAR ON UM WELL I THERE'RE CLEARER IN WHEN YOU'VE GOT FEWER PEOPLE 
SO THERE'S FEWER PEOPLE TRYING TO PULL THE DISCOURSE GOALS IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
UM AND THEY'RE CLEARER WHEN UM YOUR GOALS ARE QUITE LIMITED 
SO WHEN YOU'VE JUST GET INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND YOU KNOW THE OR THERE'S A CLEAR TASK THAT THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO AND THEY'RE FOCUSSED ON THAT TASK 
SO IS NORMAL ON DIALOGUE ELICITATION LIKE MAP TASK OR LIKE YOUR 
LIKE YOUR INFORMA WHICH LIKE YOUR INFORMATION SEEKING DIALOGUES WHICH WASN'T DIALOGUE ELICITATION BUT IT WAS VERY CONSTRAINED IN GENRE 
SO UM THE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION MIGHT BE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE CATALOGUE OF EXCHANGES IS FOR REAL MEETINGS BECAUSE UM OR FOR THIS DECISION MAKING MEETINGS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY EXCHANGES 
RIGHT 
SO HAVE YOU GONE THROUGH THE MEETINGS AND LOOKED FOR INITIATIONS AND RESPONSES WITH WITHOUT A PRIOR CATALOGUE 
JUST KNOWING THAT INIT INITIATION IN INTRODUCES A NEW DISCOURSE GOAL AND A RESPONSE UM MEETS OR NEGATES THAT GOAL IN SOME WAY 
SO HAVE YOU TRIED MARKING THESE EXCHANGES 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BUT BUT A READING OF THIS YOU KNOW 
THE COULD TELL YOU THAT THERE IS IN CASE WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR INITIATION AND RESPONSES THAT'S GONNA WORK YOU KNOW 
'CAUSE YOU COULD GO THROUGH AND SO THAT UM ACTUALLY THE PATTERN OF OF ADDRESSING DIFFERENT DISCOURSE GOALS IS TOO DISPERSED TO ME TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT KIND OF MARK UP 
BUT I G YEAH I MEAN I OBVIOUSLY YOU WANNA HAVE A FRONT RUNNER SCHEME I IN MIND BEFORE YOU 
SO THAT'S IT 
YEAH 
DO YOU MEAN AN ACTION IN TERMS OF WHAT THE GROUP IS REQUIRING HIM TO DO OR DO YOU MEAN AN ACTION IN LIKE PICKING SOMETHING UP 
SO ACTION IN THE TECHNICAL MEETING SENSE OR JUST ACTION IN THE PHYSICAL SENSE 
RIGHT OKAY 
UH SO THAT'S NOT A PHYSICAL ACTION RIGHT 
UH UH IF I PICK THIS UP WHICH IS A PHYSICAL ACTION YOU CAN'T REJECT THAT 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S A ACTION IN THE SORT OF TECHNICAL SENSE OF MEETINGS 
SO YOU ARE ACTIONED TO DO SOMETHING WHICH IS PART OF THE PERMANENT RECORD THAT YEAH OKAY 
WELL THERE ARE VERY FEW UH SCHEMES FOR MARKING UP EXCHANGES AN ACTUAL DATA RIGHT BECAUSE UM PEOPLE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED IT VERY IMPORTANT 
WELL I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY GET TIRED AFTER MARKING UP THE DIALOGUE MOVES SO THEY NEV NEVER BOTHER WITH ANY HIGHER LEVEL DIALOGUE STRUCTURE 
SO WE DID IT IN THE MAP TASK 
BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW IF THERE CASES WHERE PEOPLE BOTHERED MARKING ANYTH ANYTHING HIGHER LEVEL THAN THE MAP THAN THE MOVE STRUCTURE 
RIGHT 
YOU DON'T KNOW IF 
NO YEAH I'VE S OH SORRY 
UM BUT IT C IT'S NOT BEEN VERY POPULAR CAR PROBABLY 'CAUSE IT MAKES ME 
DIFFERENT 
MM-HMM YEAH 
WELL THE FIRST STEP IS FIND IT IN THE WHAT HOW MUCH OF THE MATERIAL DOES THE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING COVER 
SO HOW MUCH OF A GENRE CLASH IS THERE HERE 
WELL IT'S 
YEAH 
B THE BUT THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD THAT ARE MOVING THAT DIRECTION LIKE MARTIN 
AND ALSO WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS THE THEORETICAL CLARITY ABOUT WHAT AN INITIATION AND A RESPONSE SO 
SO WHAT IS IT THAT TIES UM DIFFERENT ACTS TOGETHER AT A HIGHER LEVEL YOU KNOW 
MM-HMM 
BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOOKING AT UM WHETHER PARTS OF THE MEETING ARE HIGHLY INTERACTIVE OR NOT SO INTERACTIVE IS UH LOOKING AT WHAT SORT OF TASK THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO IT THE MOMENT 
SO YOU KNOW 
ARE THEY DOING UM UH I ARE ARE THEY UH I SEE IN THE KICK OFF MEETING JUST EXCHANGING INFORMATION TO GET STARTED WITH A PROJECT OR ARE THEY UH ACTUALLY ADDRESSING SOME SPECIFIC DESIGN UM CRITERIA AT THE MOMENT 
SHOULD TRY TO DECIDE WHICH SHAPE THE THING IS 
UM BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE KINDS OF RELATIONS THAT YOU GET BETWEEN THE UTTERANCES 
AND SO THAT AS MUCH MORE LIKE UM THE UM THE LITERATURE FROM MCGRATH ABOUT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES GROUPS GET INTO 
SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT HAS TO BE PULLED INTO THIS BECAUSE UM YOU YOU DO REQUIRE DIFFERENT UH UH DIFFERENT KINDS OF RELATIONS 
OR YOU EXPECT DIFFERENT KINDS OF RELATIONS FROM SOME OVER ARCHING SET ON UM THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES 
OH 
UM SO WHAT'S THE HIGH LEVEL VERSION AGAIN 
UP SO 
RIGHT OKAY 
I MEAN I THE MEETING ACTIONS IS JUST GONNA BE A SEGMENTATION 
IT'S NOT GOING TO PRESENT ANY SO ANY MICRO STRUCTURE 
SO IT'S JUST GONNA SAY FROM HERE IT HERE THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING 
THAT'S ALL THAT THAT SCHEME IS GONNA DO 
WE 
IT'S ONE 
THAT'S NOT IN THIS WELL THAT'S INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS 
AND THE MEETING ACTIONS ARE MEANT TO BE UH BECOME MORE UM SEMANTIC AND MORE THEORETICAL THAN THE KIND IDIAP HAVE TRADITIONALLY USED 
SO SO WE NEED TO STILL PRESERVE SOME UH SENSE OF THE ACTIVITY 
BUT RATHER THAN SAYING IT IS SOMEBODY'S AT THE WHITE BOARD IT'LL BE YOU KNOW THAT SOMEBODY'S EXPLAINING SOMETHING THAT THE OTHERS ARE FOCUSSED ON 
YEAH 
IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT SCHEME 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL YOU MIGHT NEED THE MEETING ACTION SEGMENTATION IN ORDER TO KNOW WHERE WHAT UH WHAT ARE YOU'RE CIRCUMVENTING FOR US 
IT'S JUST EXCHANGE STRUCTURE IN THESE ARE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND THEN THAT'S A SOLID BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE NEXT BIT OR SOMETHING 
I DON'T KNOW 
UM BUT W WELL TIME'S GETTING IN 
SO YOU KNOW WHAT PRACTICAL THINGS CAN WE DO TO HELP THIS WORK MOVE FORWARD 
SO YOU SHOW WHAT ELSE 
YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL M MARKING UP EXCHANGE STRUCTURE IF IF IT'S EITHER END OF UM IF YOU'VE GOT A WORKING SCHEME FOR IT IS RELATIVELY CHEAP 
IT'S A LOT CHEAPER THAN DOING DIALOGUE ACT CODING IN THE FIRST PLACE 
UM RIGHT WELL ONE PRESUMES IT IS OTHERWISE IT'S GONNA BE RA RADICALLY EXPENSIVE TO DO ANY KIND OF MARK UP 
SO UM THE YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT BUT YOU NEED TO WHAT WE NEED IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN KNOWING 
YOU KNOW THAT WE NEED EXCHANGE STRUCTURE MARKED UP AN X. AMOUNT OF DATA AT THIS POINT IS KNOWING UM WHERE YOU'RE HEADED WITH THIS I THINK 
SO WHAT'S THE GOOD THAT THAT UH THE PROJECT GETS OUT OF THIS IN THE END 
SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE W WHAT'S THE HEADLINE RESULTS OF THE WORK ON THE PROJECT 
I THINK SO SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HERE 
SO YOU GET YOUR EXCHANGE STRUCTURE MARKED UP 
AND SAY WE JUST PUT IN THE MONEY GET EXCHANGE STRUCTURE MARKED UP ON THAT ENTIRE HUB OR YOU KNOW 
FIGURE OUT HOW TO BOOT STRAP IT SO WE WE GET THIS UM UH HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SELL THAT IS A AS A PROJECT GOAL YOU KNOW 
'CAUSE PEOPLE ARE GONNA SAY EXCHANGE STRUCTURE IS WHAT 
WHAT DO WH WHAT DO YOU WHAT HOW DO YOU PLUG THAT INTO THE REST THE STUFF RIGHT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO 'CAUSE I THINK THAT UM JUST TO MAKE THIS M MORE EFFICIENT 
YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THE HIGH LEVEL GOAL IN ORDER TO FOCUS THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING RATHER THAN THINKING WELL 
YOU KNOW THERE'S THESE THEORIES YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE APPLY THESE THEORIES TO IT 
UM AND THEN SEEING WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR THE MEETING BROWSER ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY YEAH 
WE HAVE A GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO DO THIS WITH THE MEETING BROWSER UM WHAT KINDS OF DIALOGUE STRUCTURE WOULD WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT 
I MEAN UH I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU'D WANNA DISAGREE WITH THAT 
BUT I THIS MORE GOAL DIRECTED MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE IT EASIER TO ME BRING THESE THINGS TO PUBLICATION IN THE LONG RUN RIGHT 
RIGHT 
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT THEY SAY 
BUT IT'S SOMETHING AT LEAST IDENTIFY SOMETHING THAT WE'D HOPE TO GET OUT OF IT YOU KNOW 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I IT JUST HELPS YOU KNOW WHICH THEORY YOU SHOULD BE CONCENTRATING ON 
SO YOU KNOW THAT IMMEDIATELY DISCOUNTS EXCHANGE UM STRUCTURES THAT ARE MOSTLY FOR INFORMATION SEEKING ALONE BECAUSE THE NOTION EXCHANGE IS TO RESTRICT IT THERE 
AND IN FAVOUR OF UM THIS THIS MORE ARGUMENTATIVE THINGS 
SO I MEAN UH I DO THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND WHAT THE FINAL GOAL IS IS THAT YOU CAN PLUG THIS INTO SOMETHING TO THE END AND AND UM SHOW SOME BENEFIT OF HAVING THE MARK UP 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I MEAN OPERATIONALLY IT'S NOT GONNA MUCH DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT'S HUB OR NOT RIGHT BECAUSE 
WE'VE GOT THE BANK OF PEOPLE 
WE HAVE TO GET THE HUB STUFF THROUGH BUT UM YOU KNOW HE'S N NOT READY WITH ONE ANNOTATION SCHEME THAT CAN BE USED TO THE MOMENT ANYWAY 
SO AND IT IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE 
I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN AFFORD OFF BUDGET 'CAUSE 
YEAH IT UH AND IT'S IT DIFFERENT A GENRE YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S NOT HELP EITHER 
BUT YEAH THEY'RE EASIER TO DO THAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IN THE UM 
MM-HMM 
YOU 
UM WELL I DON'T REMEMBER THAT BUT THE W I MEAN THE 
UH ABOUT THAT WAS ABOUT WHAT TASK THE PERSON DOING THE BROWSING WAS GONNA DO 
IT W THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT SORT OF INFORMATION THEY'D WANT FROM THE MEETING ITSELF 
IT W IT WAS ABOUT UH I 
THAT WAS THE THAT WE THE BROWSER TASK 
YOU KNOW THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THESE SEVEN DIFFERENT TASKS PEOPLE MIGHT WANNA DO WITH BROWSERS UM YOU KNOW 
LIKE UH JOIN A MEETING LATE AND EACH UM CATCH UP ON WHAT'S HAPPENED ON THE MEETING AS FAR BE AT HOME WAITING FOR THE WASHING REPAIR GUY 
AND 
YEAH 
OKAY WELL C MAYBE 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO AVOID DOING STUFF THAT WAS S STUCK IN THIS PARTICULAR DOMAIN IF POSSIBLE 
BUT YOU KNOW THE THEY WEREN'T CONCENTRATING 
WELL YEAH 
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE UM USING THE TECHNIQUES THAT YOU CAN BE USING OPEN DOMAIN TECHN 
MM-HMM 
AND YOU DON'T THINK THAT CAN BE DONE AN OPEN DOMAIN AT ALL 
'CAUSE WE DON'T WANNA GET INTO UM WORKING WITH ONTOLOGIES 
I MEAN ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF THIS GROUPING WAS THAT YEAH THEY ALL WORK WITH THE CLOSED DOMAIN ONTOLOGIES AND WE'LL DO THE OPEN DOMAIN SIDE OF THINGS 
SO 
I DON'T KNOW 
WE'LL SEE 
OH RIGHT YEAH 
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO YOU'RE ADVISING WEI XUN THAT UH SHOULD BE USING LIKE ANY ONTOLOGIES AND PROPOSITIONAL CONTENT THAT UM D. F. K. I. AND T. N. O. BANK IN THE C. V. S. REPOSITORY OR OR NOT 
THAT'S WHAT I'M NOT CLEAR ON 
WITH OUR WITHOUT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
CAN ACTUALLY TRY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'LL BANK THESE BY THE WAY 
UM 'CAUSE THAT'S IT'S NOT HUB 
SO I IT'S ONE OF THESE THINGS WHERE EVERYBODY'S SUPPOSED TO BANK AS MANY THINGS AS POSSIBLE 
SO YOU KNOW W 
YEAH 
BUT OPEN 
YEAH IT'S NOT REALLY AN OPEN DOMAIN TASK YEAH 
WELL EVENTUALLY THE HUB IS SUPPOSED TO BE FORTY PERCENT NON SCENARIO 
BUT THAT DATA'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE KIND OF COMING IN THE LAST 
SO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THAT'S QUITE REASONABLE 
WE WE'VE GOT FIVE ISCA MEETINGS ACTUALLY WHICH ARE STILL UH AN ELICITATION TASK BUT THEY'RE NOT OUR DOMAIN 
SO THAT SHOULD HELP SOME 
AND THEY'VE BEEN DECLARED HUB 
SO SO THEY'LL ACCRUE ALL OF THE NORMAL AN ANNOTATIONS 
OF COURSE YEAH YOU'LL YOU'LL NEVER GET THE T. N. O. AND D. F. K. I. STUFF ON IT 'CAUSE THEY'RE ONLY BILLING STUFF FOR THE ONE TO MAKE THE 
YEAH JUST FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA HELP HIM TO TO TRY TO MAKE THIS MORE EFFICIENT 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE WE FINISH THAT OFF BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAT WORK'S JUST WASTED RIGHT 
WE'RE GONNA USE CHUNKS FOR SOMETHING USEFUL 
YEAH CHUNKS ARE GONNA BE NAMED ENTITIES IF NOTHING ELSE 
AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION AT WHICH LEVEL 
UH-HUH 
DIALOGUE ACT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND THAT'S A PROBLEM 
YEAH 
CERTAINLY IF IF YOU'VE GOT CHUNKS IT OUGHT TO HELP YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR DIALOGUE ACT BOUNDARIES BETTER NOT BE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
AND IT MAY BE EVEN MORE MECHANICAL THAN THAT BASED ON THE UM EXAMPLES WE'RE USING FROM D. F. K. I. 
'CAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE HAND MARKING STUFF AND THE DIALOGUE ACT BOUNDARIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE INTENTIONAL 
UM BUT THEY SEEM TO ALWAYS BE MARKING THEM THAT UM UH AFTER VERBS YOU KNOW WITH CLAUSE M UH IT'S VERY IT LOOKS QUITE MECHANICAL 
SO WE'RE QUERYING THEM ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT 
AND 
WELL HOLD ON 
BUT WHEN DO WE NEED CHUNKING BY 
AND IT YOU KNOW SO YOU I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW 
YOU START SOMETHING AND THEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER YOU PICK UP TO DO THE LAST TEN PERCENT OF THE WORK TO FINISH IT OFF OR WHATEVER 
SO IT I LIKE THINGS KINDA TODAY 
RIGHT 
SO HOW MUCH WORK IS THERE LEFT AND WHEN DO WE ACTUALLY NEED TO BUY WOULD BE USEFUL TO DISCUSS 
THE AMI DATA IS IS THERE 
THERE'S I MEAN THERE'S HUB SET A. IS TRANSCRIBED I THINK UM IN FINAL FORM 
YOU WE CAN CHECK THE WIKIS 
BUT YOU KNOW THE DATA IS ROLLING IN 
SO 
AND BUT BARBARA STILL SAYS SOMEBODY'S DONE THIS FOR CHUNKS 
I'LL HAVE TO LOOK UP YOU KNOW SO 
MM 
HAND CHUNKED 
MM-HMM 
BUT 
THAT SHOULDN'T BE THAT HARD TO DO RIGHT 
HOW MUCH DATA DO YOU NEED 
I DON'T READ LIPS 
WHAT WAS THAT 
WAS IT HARD 
YEAH 
THEY THE DATA HOW MUCH DATA YOU NEED WAS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE SWITCHBOARD 'CAUSE HE HAD LOTS 
SO HE DIDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH 
SO WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH DATA YOU NEED HAND CHUNKED 
AND THEN UH HOW DO YOU HAND CHUNK STUFF RIGHT 
SO YOU WERE WERE WORKING ON INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOING HAND CHUNKING 
FOR SWITCHBOARD YEAH 
BUT THEN UH THERE WERE TWO POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOR UH FOR DOING THIS IN THE AMI DATA 
YOU COULD EITHER UM ESSENTIALLY GO THE SAME ROUTE AS THEY DID WITH THE SWITCHBOARD UM YOU KNOW 
DO THE PENN TREE BANK AND THEN CREATE THE CHUNKS OFF THAT ARE YOU COULD CHUNK DIRECTLY 
AND IT WASN'T CLEAR TO USE WHICH ONE OF THESE TWO METHODS WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS 
RIGHT WELL SO YOU'D HAVE TO PRODUCE AS PART OF THIS EXERCISE 
YOU WOULD'VE THOUGHT SO BUT I DUNNO 
OH YES YEAH I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT 
BUT THAT'S NOT VERY SIMILAR 
WELL I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT GRAMMAR 
SO THE IS THAT SIMILAR ENOUGH THAT THAT THIS SOME METHOD COULD APPLY THAT WE DERIVE CHUNKS OFF THE H. P. S. G. OUTPUT 
I THINK YOU MIGHT ALSO A LOT ON YOU KNOW THIS SETUP 
SO BASICALLY YOUR YOUR CHUNKER IS TRAINED ON SOMETHING THAT WAS DERIVED OFF PENN TREE BANK 
AND IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT ENOUGH THAT THAT ACTUALLY CAUSES IT NOT TO MATCH 
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SUDDENLY EVALUATING AGAINST CHUNKS THAT WERE DONE USING H. P. S. G. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT GRAMMAR BUT IT YOU KNOW IT 
YEAH 
AND THE MAPPINGS ARE CAN BE CR PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR THIS RIGHT 
OR IS IS EASY TO MAP BETWEEN FINER GRAINED DISTINCTIONS AND COARSER ONES 
THINK SO 
YEAH 
HUH 
THE NAMES WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS WAS THE IDEA RIGHT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
SO YOU THAT SORT OF ASSUMES THAT WE THINK IT'S BETTER TO DO THIS BY DERIVING CHUNKS FROM UM SOME PARSED FORMAT THAN JUST HAND CHUNKING THE STUFF 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO LET'S TRY TO THIS WAY 
AND THEN THAT THAT PUTS OFF THE QUESTION OF UM WHEN DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS OUT WHEN WE GET H. P. S. G. STUFF RIGHT 
SO CAN YOU ASK ME D. F. K. I. WHETHER THEY CAN GIVE US A COUPLE AMI MEETINGS RUN THROUGH THEIR H. P. S. G. PROCESS 
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TIME SCALE THEY HAD IN MIND 
I MEAN IT IS THIS SOMETHING THEY W THEY WERE DOING IT AT THE MOMENT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WAS VERY PRELIMINARY OR DO YOU REMEMBER 
TWENTE YEAH 
YEAH 
Y YOU'RE EXPECTING ME TO REMEMBER STUFF AREN'T YOU 
OH YEAH 
UH I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE I'VE MISSED 
BRUSSELS AMSTERDAM 
T. N. O. OKAY 
SO I WASN'T THERE 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO ASK 'EM RIGHT 
SO IT'S TALK TO ALEX SEE IF IT LOOKS LIKE IT MAPS BY LOOKING AT THE VERBMOBIL 
IF IT DOES ASK D. F. K. I. THREE FOUR DATA OR A TIME SCALE AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH DATA YOU NEED IN ORDER TO DO THAT 
SO DO YOU HAVE A TECHNIQUE FOR ESTIMATING HOW MUCH DATA YOU'D NEED 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT SO WHO KNOWS HOW YOU DO THAT 
OKAY 
SO JUST ASK D. F. K. I. HOW MUCH DATA AND WHEN RIGHT 
IF 
YEAH I KNOW 
UH WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR TIME IN MIND WHEN WE NEED A CHUNKER THAT WORKS ON THIS STUFF 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I GUE IF WE DID A CHUNKED VERSION OF THE AMI DATA AND STICK IT INTO C. V. S. UNDER THE AUTOMATIC CONTRIBUTIONS THEN UM PEOPLE WOULD END UP USING IT 
'CAUSE THEY DO THAT RIGHT 
SO THE QUESTION IS IT WHAT STAGE SHOULD WE PUT THAT ONE 
YEAH SO POST EVALUATION SO WE CAN PUT IN SOME IDEA OF WHAT THE EVALUATION IS LIKE 
MM-HMM 
NO BUT HE'S RELYING IT IN AT THE THIS SUMMER 
MM-HMM 
SO WHEN WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE 
WHEN WHEN IS SHE SENDING SOMEBODY 
UH FOR THE NEXT ONE MM-HMM 
BUT THAT'S A PRETTY TIGHT TIME SCALE THEN RIGHT 'CAUSE IT'D BE FOR THE FALL WE'D WANNA KNOW THE EVALUATION 
SO THAT THE TIME SCALE YOU'RE THINKING OF OUR 
HOW IT COULD BE DONE 
YEAH 
OH THAT'S ALL I THINK 
OH 
MM-HMM 
I THINK YOU SHOULD STILL ASK BARBARA AGAIN YOU KNOW C CAN YOU HAVE ANOTHER THINK ABOUT WHO MIGHT HAVE THE CHUNKING STUFF 
'CAUSE SHE HAS SAID SEVERAL TIMES THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY AND SHE CAN HELP WITH THAT 
AND UM I THINK SHE'S JUST FORGOTTEN 
SO 
SO AND THEN WE CAN EVALUATE ON THE CASE YOU KNOW PRETTY EASILY 
YEAH EVEN IF IT'S JUST A YOU KNOW IN A WEEK THE UM THE REFERENCES AND THEN WHY THEY'RE RELEVANT RIGHT 
I MEAN YOU DON'T WANNA MAKE THIS REALLY FORMAL OR DO YOU 
YEAH A PARAGRAPH EACH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT THAT WE THAT WOULD HELP US BE A LOT MORE SPECIFIC AB THAN THAN JUST UM YOU KNOW 
LISTING BULLET POINTS ON SLIDES CAUSE THEN WE'D KNOW SORT OF WHICH LITERATURE YOU'RE THINKING OF UM PUTTING IN AND WE COULD READ THE MOST IMPORTANT ARGUMENTATIVE STUFF 
I CAN HAVE THESE THINGS ANYWAY YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THEY HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THIS PROBLEM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO VERY SOON BECAUSE I'VE GOT THIS UM THIS HEARING TO GO TO 
BUT UH IS THE PRACTICAL ACTIONS YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE'RE GONNA GO AWAY AND DO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO YOU CAN DO THIS EXERCISE AND THEN COME AND TALK TO ME SOME TIME NEXT WEEK 
I'M NOT ON MONDAY BUT THE THREE DAYS I'LL BE AROUND 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH SO THIS THIS IS INTERESTING BUT I W I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO L UM LOOK AT THIS RIGHT NOW 
SO WHY DON'T YOU BRING IT BY UM NEXT WEEK 
AND I WHAT I REALLY WANNA DO CONCENTRATE JUST NOW IS IS FINDING OUT THE HOW WE'RE GONNA HELP ME WEI XUN WITH WITH MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS 
SO WE'VE ALREADY GOT YOU KNOW HE'S GONNA UM CONSTRUCT A LIST OF THE REFERENCES HE THINKS IS IMPORTANT 
AND JOHANNA AND I AND AND YOU AS WELL ARE GONNA CONTRIBUTE TO THAT 
AND WE CAN PUT THAT IN A WEEK OR WE CAN DO IT SOME OTHER WAY 
I MEAN YOU KNOW I'M WIKI MAD 
SO UM IF WE SHARE IT IT SHOULD GO ON A WIKI 'CAUSE I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING IN MY EMAIL 
BUT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT 
UM AND THEN UH HOW DO WE YOU'RE ACTUALLY SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS TAKING ALL OF THE THE THE MOST IMPORTANT REFERENCES FOR UM FINDING ARGUMENT STRUCTURE THAT MIGHT I EVENTUALLY BE OF SOME IS IT A MEETING BROWSER AND TRYING TO LOOK AT ACTUAL DATA AND APPLY AND AND SO LIKE WHICH ONE HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA DO WITH THIS PARTICULAR DATA 
RIGHT 
SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD TAKE LIKE THE FRONT RUNNER SCHEME AND THE DATA AND YOU SHOULD LOOK AT NOT FRONT RUNNER SCHEME BUT FRONT RUNNER THEORY AND I SEE IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE DATA 
YOU KNOW USING THAT KIND OF THEORY AT SOME POINT 
AND MIGHT MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING EXERCISE RIGHT 
THE UPDATE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BUT THAT'S A GOOD STARTING POINT YEAH 
THAT'LL BE THE EXACTLY YEAH 
SO YOU WANNA GO THROUGH BASICALLY THE USER REQUIREMENTS AND YOU KNOW MAYBE THINK ABOUT SOME USER REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR OWN AND MAKE A CASE FOR 
YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'D WANT AND LIKE YOU'RE GONNA NEED UM THIS KIND OF DIALOGUE OR ARGUMENT STRUCTURE FOR IT 
UM UH UH I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT 
YEAH 
SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET RECORDS 
I MEAN I'M SURE THEY'RE NOT IN THE WEB YET 
SO 
YEAH 
MM-HMM YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO SO WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH THE REQUIREMENTS LIKE THAT AND DID DID YOU THINK THAT'S THAT WAS REASONABLE IT AFTER THAT TO TRY AND UM ACTUALLY 
YOU KNOW TAKE SOME THEORY THAT SEEMS FAIRLY REASONABLE AND THINK ABOUT THE PARTICULAR DATA AND COME AND TALK 
YEAH 
I THERE'S A FEW REFERENCES MISSING 
YEAH 
YEP 
SO THEN TRY FRONT RUNNER SCHEME ON WELL A FRONT RUNNER THEORY 
YEAH 
BUT TRY IT INFORMALLY 
YEP MM-HMM 
WHEN DO WE GET TOGETHER AGAIN 
'CAUSE I REALLY DO HAVE TO GO 
I PROMISED THESE GUYS I'D BE THERE 
UH-HUH 
BUT WE 
READING LISTS BEFORE THAT THOUGH SO RIGHT 
SO WE'LL GET TOGETHER IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS 
OH 
UH-HUH 
FOUR WEEKS YEAH 
RIGHT 
I'M GONNA HEAD OFF 
C 'CAUSE FLOODS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN DIALOGUE STRUCTURE I'M AFRAID 
AREN'T THEY SUING HIM 
MM-HMM 
CAN'T TH CAN'T THEY GET LEGAL AID 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO COUNT TO TEN OR SOMETHING 
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL THAT 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO 
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE A PRESENTATION FOR US THEN 
GREAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU WERE GONNA DEFINE THIS MORE ON THE SLIDES TO COME OR IF THIS IS IS MUCH AS YOU'RE GONNA TELL US 
I'M JUST WONDERING IF HE'S PREPARED 
SURE 
SO SO WHAT DID YOU HAVE MORE IN LATER SLIDES ABOUT THIS 
OKAY 
BUT WE'VE ALSO ESTABLISHED THAT IT'S NOT JUST SPEAKER CHANGE IT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE MM-HMM OKAY THEN 
OKAY 
Y YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL IT MIGHT BE THE CASE THAT TO BE INTERACTIVE THERE HAVE TO BE DIALOGUE ACTS OF SOME SPECIFIC TYPE IN A TURN RATHER THAN 
LIKE STATEMENT STATEMENT REJECT ACCEPT YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
MM-HMM 
WELL ACTUALLY I DON'T QUITE AGREE 
I MEAN I FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN'T USE R. S. T. ACROSS SPEAKERS BECAUSE THE DEFINITIONS OF THE RELATIONS DEPEND ON THE INTENTIONS OF THE SPEAKER AND THERE'S DIFFERENT SPEAKERS HAVE DIFFERENT INTENTIONS 
SO YOU CAN'T USE THE THEORY 
IT'S JUST FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG IT'S IT WAS MEANT AS A THEORY FOR A ONE PERSON UH RIGHT 
SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T OTHER THEO SO FAR 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
BUT THOSE ARE VERY THESE ARE REALLY DIFFERENT UM THEORIES THAT ARE AT ARE TRYING TO GET IT DIFFERENT THINGS AND IT AND THEY ADMIT OF UM YOU KNOW 
SOME OF THEM ADMIT OF MULTIPLE PARTIES AND SOME OF THEM ASSUME YOU'RE IN ONE SPEAKER'S HEAD 
RIGHT AND THE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THE ENTIRE THEORY IS BASED ON INTENTION AND THE INTENTION OF AN INDIVIDUAL 
SO R. S. T. WOULD BE A BAD THEORY TO USE 
SO MODELLING MODELLING A SINGLE CONTRIBUTION BY A SINGLE SPEAKER YOU CAN WITHIN THAT YOU CAN USE R. S. T. IF YOU WANT TO RIGHT 
BUT ACROSS SPEAKERS YOU CAN'T 
THEY HAVE NO RELATIONS FOR THINGS LIKE REJECT OR AGREE 
THEY THE THEORY DOESN'T HAVE THEM 
SO THE THE SO IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THEORY 'CAUSE THE THEORY IS THE RELATIONS PLUS THE NOTION OF NUCLEARITY 
SO WE NEED A DIFFERENT THEORY 
NOW I THINK ALEX UM S. D. R. S. ALLOWS BOTH KINDS 
SO YOU KNOW WITHIN A SPEAKER TURN YOU CAN HAVE THINGS LIKE EXPLANATION AND CASE AND ALL THAT 
UM BUT THEN ACROSS SPEAKER TURNS YOU CAN HAVE THINGS LIKE CORRECTION OR I DIDN'T SEE ANY EXAMPLES OF AGREE OR DISAGREE IN S. T. R. S. BUT I THERE AREN'T 
I MEAN THERE ARE THIRTY RELATIONS 
SO WE SHOULD LOOK AT AT WHAT THEY ARE 
BUT I D I DON'T 
WELL HERE THE RELATIONS HAVE A S 
DO YES BUT SO I MEAN THE RELATION NAMES IT'S NOT THE NAMES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IT'S THEIR SEMANTICS THAT ARE IMPORTANT RIGHT 
AND THEY'RE THE SEMANTICS OF THE RELATIONS ARE BASED ON THE SEMANTICS OF THE UTTERANCES THAT THEY'RE RELATING AS ALEX S EXPLAINED YESTERDAY 
UM AND SO UM IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THESE RELATIONS HAVE A SEMANTICS THAT'S TIED TO THE SEMANTICS OF THE UTTERANCES RIGHT 
UH P POSS POSSIBLY BUT FEW PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO YOU KNOW 
DO THE KIND OF UM TRUTH CONDITIONAL SEMANTICS THAT YOU KNOW ASHER AND LASCARIDES HAVE DONE RIGHT 
SO THE THEORY CAN HANDLE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN MEETINGS AS SHE EXPLAINED 
THE ACTUAL COMPUTATIONAL MECHANISMS THEY HAVE CURRENTLY FOR BUILDING UP THE TREES CAN'T 
NOW I DON'T REMEMBER WAS WHICH SPEAKER YOU IN THE C ON THE EXAMPLE SHE SHOWED YESTERDAY 
WAS TO THE CASE THAT THE REPRESENTATION OF THE UTTERANCES AND THE RELATIONS INCLUDED WHICH SPEAKER WAS UH 
I MEAN IT HAD THE AT THE L AT THE LEAVES THEY HAD THE WELL SHE DIDN'T SHOW IT BUT THEY WOULD HAVE THE SEMANTICS OF THE UTTERANCES 
AND THEN SHE HAD RELATION NAMES AND HANDLES 
RIGHT 
I JUST I JUST DON'T DIDN'T REMEMBER SEEING IN THE REPRESENTATION WHICH SPEAKER CONTRIBUTED WHAT 
'CAUSE SHE DID REPRESENT UM DISCOURSE STRUCTURES 'CAUSE THIS WERE THE VERBMOBIL SCHEDULING DIALOGUES 
SO THE UTTERANCES IN THE ON THE REPRESENTATION WERE UTTERED BY TWO DIFFERENT PARTS THAT WASN'T THE YOU KNOW 
IN THE ON THE EXAMPLES SHE SHOWED US THERE WERE THERE WAS SOME THAT WAS JUST YOU KNOW ONE PARTY 
IT WAS A MONOLOGUE BUT THEN THERE WAS A SNIPPET OF DIALOGUE AS WELL WITH 
FOR THIS SPECIFIC SET OF RELATIONS THAT THAT THEY'VE DEFINED 
THERE MIGHT BE SOME HIGHER LEVEL STRUCTURE THAT YOU WANNA PULL OUT OF THAT 
I MEAN I 'CAUSE YOU WERE SAYING YOU'RE JUST GONNA Y YOU'RE YOU WANNA LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW VERY LOCAL STUFF 
BUT FROM THAT YOU C ONE WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD PULL OUT SOMETHING HIGH YOU KNOW 
NO I THINK WORKING FROM THE BOTTOM UP SOUNDS GREAT 
BUT I'M JUST YOU I MEAN WHAT YOU CAN IMAGINE SOMEONE SAYING WELL HOW DID THEY DECIDE TO MAKE IT BLUE 
AND MAYBE THERE WAS A LONG BLOW BY BL AND YOU DON'T YOU KIND OF WANNA ABSTRACT AWAY FROM HE SAID THIS 
SHE SAID THAT UH SO YOU KNOW IT ANYWAY I YOU KNOW I MEAN I I DON'T THINK ESPECIALLY UH 
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT STEEPED IN THESE THEORIES THAT IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO YOU WHETHER WE USE R. S. T. OR SOMETHING LIKE S. D. R. S. 
BUT IT MIGHT MAKE MUCH MORE YOU KNOW I MEAN 
WELL I THINK WE SHOULD ASS I THINK WE SHOULD 
TRY TO FIND A THEORY THAT ALLOWS MULTIPLE SPEAKERS AND RELATIONS TO SPAN OVER MORE THAN ONE SPEA YOU KNOW 
BECAUSE IT IS TRUE THAT I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE DAMSEL AND OTHER ATTEMPTS TO COME UP WITH ANNOTATION SCHEMES FOR FOR DIALOGUE ACTS 
THERE WAS THIS NOTION OF FORWARD LOOKING AND BACKWARD LOOKING 
ANYWAY THEY'RE RELATIONAL 
I MEAN IN SOME WAY YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL RELATIONAL 
UM BUT YOU NEEDED 
BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENT SET OF TAGS IN THERE FROM THE KINDS OF RELATIONS YOU SEE WITHIN R. S. T. FOR EXAMPLE 
SO IF YOU LOOK AT AMANDA STENT'S THESIS AND THE ANALYSIS THAT SHE DID SORT OF WITHIN A TURN SHE SAID SOMETHING LIKE R. S. T. 
AND THEN ACROSS TURNS SHE USED DAMSEL RIGHT 
WELL I 
WELL IT GIVES YOU THINGS LIKE ACCEPT AND REJECT AND 
OH YEAH 
IN FACT R. S. T. DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT OKAY 
DO SO I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE IMPOR I THINK IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO GO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FIGURING OUT WHAT KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS WE WANT AND THEN FINDING AND 
YOU KNOW LIKE SETTING DOWN WHAT THE CONSTRAINTS ARE IN THE ANALYSIS GAME 
HE'S BEEN LOOKING AT THE DATA OKAY SO IT GOOD 
UM AND THEN AND THEN THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT THEORIES OF ARGUMENT 
I MEAN YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT THE SORT OF JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING KINDS OF UM APPROACHES 
SO YOU KNOW CLARK AND LOCKBAUM AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT KIND OF THING 
THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR DIALOGUE RIGHT I MEAN AND CAN BE EXPANDED TO MORE THAN TWO PERSONS 
ACTUALLY THE LOCKBAUM STUFF IS FOR GROUPS 
YEAH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO KNOW WHAT UM 
BUT WHO'S THEY 
THAT'S THE QUESTION 
WOAH 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
WELL I MEAN I THINK THAT UM W IT I DON'T KNOW UH W IT'D PROBABLY GET IT OR HERE YOU KNOW 
MORE OF YOUR PRESENTATION BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT CANDIDATES AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T GO THROUGH AND MARK UP EVERY MEETING 
I MEAN MARK UP MEETINGS WITH EVERY SCHEME WE THINK OF 
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO KIND OF GOT AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE CANDIDATES ARE UM IF THERE'S LIKE TWO OR THREE THAT WE THINK ARE GOOD CONTENDERS 
THEN WE TRY TO SEE WHAT WORKS BETTER RIGHT 
THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTION THERE ARE A LOT MORE OPTIONS 
SO SO LET'S SEE WHAT WHAT ELSE YOU'VE GOT 
UH SO THAT WAS IT ON DIALOGUE OKAY 
OKAY 
SO UH IT'S VERY UNCLEAR TO UM WHY YOU THINK EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION IS MORE PRINCIPAL T UH DID YOU I MEAN WHAT DID YOU HAVE SPECIFIC SCHEMES IN MIND THERE 
OR SPEC MM SPECIFIC 
PEOPLE'S WORK THAT YOU UM 
BUT CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF A SCHEME THAT'S BASED ON EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO I MEAN I THINK THAT UM THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BEFORE I MEAN 
YEAH 
I MEAN AND 
WELL WE'RE MARKING UP A LOT OF HIGHER LEVEL THINGS IN OUR 
OKAY 
SO UM HAVE YOU LOOKED AT NATE BLAYLOCK'S WORK 
SO HE HAS THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW ADOPT UM SO BASICALLY IT'S TOO 
YOU KNOW COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING YOU KNOW MORE THAN ONE PERSON INVOLVED AND TRYING TO CHARACTERISE THINGS SO UM 
YOU KNOW IF I 
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAMES OF ALL THE ACTIONS 
ONE IS IS THE COCONUT PROJECT IS A PROJECT THAT I DID WITH RICH THOMASSON AND BARBARA DIGINIO 
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT 
NOT VERY CLEAR 
NO 
THOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL IN THE PAPER 
BUT YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT IN IN VERY MUCH DETAIL 
OKAY SO I THINK YOU SHOULD 
UM BECAUSE IT WAS ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE DONE FOR JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING AND JOINT ACTION I THINK ARE VERY RELEVANT TO LOOK AT BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE SOLVING A PROBLEM TOGETHER 
RIGHT 
SO UM WHILE THESE SCHEMES MAY NOT HAVE THEY HAVE SOME EASE OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS THAT YOU NEED TO CHARACTERISE UM JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING 
SO WHILE THE UM 
YOU MAY THINK THAT THEY'RE MISSING SOMETHING THEN WE WE COULD CERTAINLY AUGMENT THEM 
BUT I THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT 
AND SO SO NATE BLAYLOCK TRIED TO OKAY SO YOU KNOW 
FROM GROSS AND KRAUSS AND GROSS AND SIDENER CAME ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT SHARED PLANS AND HOW YOU REALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND 
YOU KNOW DIALOGUE U UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND SHARED PLANS 
BUT THE ACTUAL THEORETICAL UM OR FORMALISATION OF IT WAS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX 
AND SO UM LOCKBAUM SIMPLIFIED IT QUITE AND YOU KNOW SIDENER AND RICH AND COLLAGEN HAVE SIMPLIFIED IT QUITE A BIT 
UM BUT NATE BLAYLOCK TRIED TO UM YOU KNOW DEFINE 
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SOMEBODY SUGGESTS SOMETHING 
WELL YOU CAN ADAPT TO YOU CAN WELL I CAN'T REMEMBER YOU KNOW OKAY BUT HE HAS UH UH HAS A TAXONOMY YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH EXACTLY RIGHT 
UM WHICH WE TRIED TO APPLY TO TUTORING BUT IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL FOR TUTORING 'CAUSE TUTORING'S JUST A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BALL GAME 
BUT UM IT YOU KNOW 
WE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME LOOKING AT IT AND IT DID STRIKE ME THAT FOR JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING THERE WE THERE WERE SOME GOOD IDEAS 
AND THERE IS YOU KNOW A SET OF TAGS AND WHAT THEY MEAN AND YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF THING 
AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO LIKE TO YOU KNOW CL YOU KNOW CLARK ON JOINT ACTION 
NOW HE'S NOT GONNA GIVE YOU A SET OF TAGS 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF GUY HE IS 
BUT UM 
BUT THE OVERARCHING IDEA YOU KNOW 
I MEAN I THINK ACCOUNTS FOR A LOT OF THE WAYS ON WHICH UM YOU KNOW THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE THE ARE THINKING 
BUT I MEAN I THINK THAT WE WE BASICALLY HAVE TO MERGE SOME OF THIS STUFF THAT'S BEEN DONE YOU KNOW 
IN MEETINGS WITH SOME OF THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN DONE ON COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING 'CAUSE THERE'S ELEMENTS OF EACH THAT SEEM REALLY IMPORTANT 
AND I THINK THE 
BECAUSE IT REALLY SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT AND SOME OF THIS STUFF ON EXCHANGE IS LIKE ANCIENT AND YOU KNOW 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MARK UP LOTS OF DATA AND COUNT THINGS YOU KNOW 
SO I MEAN ALL THE CONVERSATIONAL ANALYSIS STUFF I MEAN THESE GUYS NEVER COUNT ANYTHING YOU KNOW 
I MEAN THEY'RE UH PS SO THEY USE A PATTERN AND THEN THEY THINK IT'S KINDA CUTE AND THEN THEY SCOUR THE WORLD FOR THIRD TURN REPAIRS YOU KNOW 
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SAY HOW OFTEN DO THIS HAPPEN 
I MEAN THEY WORKED I MEAN I KNOW MANNY SCHEGLOFF REALLY WELL AND THEY'RE NOT COUNTERS 
THEY'RE PURPOSELY NOT COUNTERS 
THEY DEFINE THEMSELVES AS NON COUNTERS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH TH I MEAN IT IT DOES SEEM LIKE YOU KNOW 
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT FROM THAT AND THEN THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT FROM COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING 
AND 
IF YOU AL IF YOU TAKE THE EXCHANGE STUFF IT'S NOT GONNA DO QUITE DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING STUFF MAYBE IT WON'T DO EVERY THAT YOU WANT 
AND SO 
HMM 
LIKE SOMEBODY'S WRITING ON THE WHITE BOARD OR I MEAN THE W MEETING ACTIONS THEY PRESENTED AT THE REVIEW SEEMED REALLY LOW LEVEL TO ME LIKE SOMEBODY STOOD UP 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
I MEAN I I REALISE IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WEI XUN GOT UP AND WANT TO THE WHITE BOARD 
I REALISE THAT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW 
BUT I D WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT THIS MEETING ACTIONS 
SO YEAH MM OKAY 
WELL I THINK WE SHOULD APPROACH TO BOTH WAYS 
I MEAN UH YOU KNOW I I D 
YOU KNOW THE MEETING BROWSER PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF CONSTRAINTS 
AND SO WHAT THEY END UP WITH SAYING IS MOST CRITICAL FOR THEM RIGHT NOW MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST INTERESTING THING IN THE LONGER TERM 
AND SO 
RIGHT 
I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW A DECISION HAS EVOLVED RIGHT 
UM AND I THINK THAT 
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF ALL OF THIS LOW LEVEL STUFF WOULD ALLOW YOU TO TRACK THAT KIND OF THING 
BUT IT MIGHT AT LEAST BE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ALLOWING YOU TO TRACK THAT KIND OF THING AND 
YEAH SOME HIGHER LEVEL YEAH 
SO I MEAN I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT SOMETHING TO THIS LEVEL NEEDS TO BE THERE 
I MEAN NEED TO ASK QUESTIONS LIKE WHO DISAGREED OR WERE THERE ANY COUNTER PROPOSALS OR WHATEVER 
EVEN THIS KIND OF QUESTIONS YOU NEED SOME KIND OF MARK UP LIKE THIS 
WELL THAT BRINGS UP SOMETHING INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK PROBABLY WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS TRY TO GET 
YOU KNOW SOME OF THIS 
TASKS SORT OF PUT IN YOU KNOW SORT OF AS PART OF THE OFFICIAL AGENDA 
AS BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE UM WERE THERE ANY COUNTER PROPOSALS TO THE BANA YOU KNOW BANANA SHAPE OR WHATEVER 
UM UH OR AT SOME SPECIFIC YOU KNOW RECOMMENDATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
I MEAN YOU KNOW THIS YOU KNOW STRIKE ME AS CL CLEAR THINGS THAT YOU KNOW 
PEOPLE WHO GO TO DECISION MAKING MEETINGS WANT TO KNOW IF THEY'VE MISSED ONE OR ARE ARRIVING LATE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
SO IT W IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET SOME OF THESE THINGS IN THE OFFICIAL AGENDA AND SAY LIKE 
YOU KNOW WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF YOU COULD HAVE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS OR SOMETHING 
OH 
NO UM SO 
AND I THINK WE WOULDN'T WANNA NECESSARILY DO THIS ONE ICSI DATA 
I THINK THE ICSI DATA IS IT TOO COMPLEX AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH REAL DECISIONS MADE YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD CLEARLY IDENTIFY 
I MEAN THERE ARE SOME BUT AND NOT THAT I'VE READ MORE THAN ABOUT TWO MEETINGS 
BUT UM I THINK W IT YOU KNOW WE WILL USE ONE THING THAT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING IS THE I THINK IT UM 
SO THE UM WHAT CAN YOU DO BECAUSE PRESUMABLY THE UM D. F. K. I. FOLK OR SOMEBODY IS GONNA MARK UP A LOT OF THE DATA WITH SORT OF TAGS ABOUT ONTOLOGY 
RIGHT 
SO WE KNOW YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WILL HAVE GONE AND BY HAND AND SORT OF MARKED UP SOME SOMETHING LI LIKE SHALLOW SEMANTICY KINDS OF THINGS RIGHT 
OR MAYBE DEEPER SEMANTICY THINGS ABOUT THAT BUT YOU KNOW 
NOT REALLY IN A IN A FORMAL LANGUAGE BUT MOSTLY JUST YOU KNOW TAGS RIGHT 
UM AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WELL HOW DOES YOU KNOW 
JUST THE WAY PEOPLE TYPICALLY DO THIS IS YOU KNOW 
LET'S TAKE THESE SEMANTIC FEATURES INTO OUR THESE FEATURES INTO ACCOUNT AND SEE HOW WELL WE DO WITH THE THE LEARNING 
AND THEN LET'S THROW THESE FEATURES OUT AND SEE HOW WELL WE DO UM BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE THEM 
BECAUSE ONE OR TWO SIDES IS REALLY INTR ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS ONTOLOGY STUFF RIGHT 
I MEAN T. N. O. S AND D. F. K. A. S RIGHT 
SO THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF DOMAIN SEMANTICS 
AND THERE WILL ALSO BE PRESUMABLY SOME KIND OF TASK HIERARCHY MODELLING GOING ON ONE I MEAN 'CAUSE THE WHOLE BROWSER WORKING GROUP UM FINAL UM SORT OF PRESENTATION ON THAT SECOND DAY WAS ABOUT 
YOU KNOW KNOWING THE TASK RIGHT 
AND VERY YOU KNOW DETAILS ABOUT WHICH TASK IS THIS YOU KNOW 
WHICH SUB TASK IS THIS LITTLE CHUNK OF THE MEETING ADDRESSING AND FURTHERING IN VARIOUS WAYS RIGHT 
WHICH SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE REALLY HARD ON AN OPEN DOMAIN 
YOU REMEMBER WHEN STEVE CAME IN STEVE WHITTAKER CAME IN AT THE END AND SAID YOU KNOW 
THEY'D SPENT THE MORNING TALKING AND THEY COME UP WITH THIS IDEA 
UM 
NO THEY SAID PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT TASKS YOU KNOW 
I MEAN THEY REALLY THEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WERE THAT THAT WAS GONNA BE HEAVILY 
IN THESE ARE THE USE THESE ARE THE SCENARIOS 
THESE ARE THE USER SCENARIOS 
THE TASK WHAT WHAT UH COME BACK AND SAID THAT AT THE END 
I MEAN IT ACTUALLY KIND KIND OF SCARED ME BECAUSE IT WAS ALL BASED AROUND TASKS 
AND AND THE DOMAIN TASKS OKAY THEY'RE NOW THEY NOW HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MANY BUTTONS TO PUT IN THIS THING 
I MEAN IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE DOMAIN TASK 
AND IT IS REALLY THE IT AND GIVEN THAT 
UH IT IT'S REALLY SCARY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO AN AN OPEN DOMAIN WHERE YOU DON'T WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TASKS ARE 
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO FIGURE THEM TO UH VERY RELIABLY 
I DO ABOUT THE WHOLE PROJECT IS YOU KNOW FOCUSSED ON AMI HUB DATA IS THERE FIRST PRIORITY 
NO NO NO NO NO NO 
BUT I MEAN IF THE OF THE IF THEY HAD THE THEY HAD THIS SORT OF EPIPHANY AT THE END OF THIS MEETING WHERE THEY DECIDED WELL WHY ARE PEOPLE BROWSING THIS 
WELL IT'S ALL TO SEE HOW YOU KNOW HOW THE PARTICIPANTS WERE FURTHERING THEIR TASKS 
WELL RIGHT 
AND THEN YES 
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS CONFUSION ABOUT THE UM LAST SPIDER PHONE CONFERENCE THAT THE MESSAGES TELLING PEOPLE TO CALL CAME OUT AFTER THE MEETING HAPPENED 
AT LEAST TO SOME OF US 
SO UM I MEAN WE'LL WE'LL GET THAT BACK ON TRACK 
BUT I THINK THAT UM WE DON'T YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE SOME MEETING BROWSER DEMO THAT UM 
YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION OF OKAY WELL IF YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE 
YOU HAVE TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY 
WELL I THINK WHEN HE DOES OR WHEN HE DOES LEAR THESE LEARNING EXPERIMENTS HE SHOULD DO 'EM TWO WAYS 
BECAUSE UH WILL HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH OUR WITHOUT 
AND THEN WE CAN SEE LIKE WELL WITHOUT YOU KNOW THESE TAGS SO YOU KNOW 
ALEX WAS SHOWING UM YESTERDAY WELL WITHOUT KNOWING THE HEAD WORD OF THE UTTERANCE TO THE LIFE 
YOU KNOW YOU GET THESE KINDS OF RESULTS AND WHEN YOU DID THAT ONE YOU GET THESE THREE KINDS OF RESULTS 
AND YOU KNOW I THINK YEAH 
UM SO I THINK IF WE HAVE THESE FEATURES IT'S YOU KNOW 
IT'S A RARE ORP OR RARE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRY ONE HAD TO HEAD AGAINST THE OTHER 
UM AND THEN OF COURSE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALLY UM 
RIGHT 
WELL WE WON'T I MEAN WE WON'T USE 'EM TILL THEY'RE READY OBVIOUSLY 
SO WE MIGHT DO THE SORT OF OPEN DOMAIN 
I MEAN A ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE A CLOSED DOMAIN I MEAN WE WE CAN'T SEE ANY DOMAIN INFORMATION NECESSARILY 
OH 
I MEAN THERE PROBABLY OR A BUNCH OF ISSUES LIKE IF YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED HOURS OF MEETINGS AND THEY ALL TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS 
THEN IT'S EA IT IT'S NOT REALLY OPEN DOMAIN AND SOMEHOW THAT SNEAKS INTO ALL THE STATISTICS ANYWAY 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE SUCH A WIDE VOCABULARY AND YOU KNOW 
RIGHT 
SURE SO WE MIGHT FIND THAT WHEN WE MOVE FROM WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS OPEN DOMAIN BUT IN THE HUB 
YOU KNOW OUR RESULTS GO DOWN WHEN WE TRULY ARE GETTING MEETING YEAH 
SO I MEAN THAT'LL BE INTERESTING 
OKAY WELL THAT'S GOOD 
SO OKAY 
SO WE WANNA DECIDE UM WHAT WEI XUN SHOULD DO NEXT AND MAYBE THINK ABOUT MEETING IN I DON'T KNOW A MONTH OR SOMETHING 
YEAH MM-HMM 
UM SO BEFORE WE DO THAT CAN I JUST ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT CHUNKING 
IN THE BEGINNING YOU SAID SOMETHING BUT YOU WERE DOING THIS CHUNKING UM AND YOU'RE DOING IT IN THE ICSI DATA 
BUT THIS WAS DID YOU SAY AT THE WASN'T PICKED UP ON UM ARE YOU I I I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT W 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND YOU AND YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT YET 
TH THAT'S FINE 
SO THAT'S STILL IN THE AGENDA TO DO IT SOME POINT 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
THAT'S 
WELL SO I MEAN RIGHT 
UM OR BUILDING BLOCKS 
I MEAN SO I MEAN WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW IS CHUNKING INTERACTS WITH THE AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION YOU KNOW 
BECAUSE UM BARBARA WAS SHOWING THE LOW LEVEL 
AND I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CHUNKING SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF USE OF OF YOUR DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTER SAYS THERE'S THERE'S A SEGMENT HERE 
BUT YOUR CHUNKER SAID IN 
THIS IS A COHERENT CHUNK THEN YOU YOU YOU KNOW W I MEAN MAYBE THEY COULD WORK TOGETHER TO DO A BETTER JOB THAN 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
PERIODS 
UH AFTER UH RIGHT 
OKAY 
RIGHT OKAY 
GOOD 
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WELL WE 
WELL HOW MUCH UM 
WELL YOU WANTED TO DO THE CHUNKING ON THE AMI DATA RIGHT 
BECAUSE UM 
SO WE GET STICK TO SOME POINT IN EVALUATION OF CHUNKING RIGHT 
THE PROBLEM WAS YOU DIDN'T HAVE ICSI DATA THAT WAS HAND LABELLED FOR CHUNKS 
AND WE DECIDED LABELLING THE ICSI DATA FOR CHUNKS WOULD BE PROBABLY DIFFICULT AND MAYBE NOT VERY USEFUL 
AND SO IT TO ME 
OKAY IF THERE IF THERE WAS IF THERE WAS HAND LABELLED DATA THAT YOU COULD EVALUATE AGAIN IS TURN ON SOME AND EVALUATE ON SOME 
WOULDN'T THAT UM 'CAUSE YOU'VE TRAINED ON SWITCHBOARD RIGHT WHERE THERE THERE ARE CHUNKS 
SO IF YOU HAD SOME ICSI DATA THAT YOU COULD MAYBE SO I DON'T KNOW 
UM AS A WHAT'S THE ONE THERE'S T THERE'S A TRAINING SET AND THEN THERE'S THE DEVELOPMENT SET AND THEN THERE'S THE TEST SET 
MAYBE YOU'D USE SOME CHUNKED ICSI STUFF AS DEVELOPMENT OR SOMETHING AND DO SOME LAST TWEAKS AND THEN EVALUATE 
BUT YOU KNOW W UH I MEAN I CAN SEE WHY WEI XUN DIDN'T WANNA SPEND HIS TIME CHUNKING ICSI D 
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO GET SOME PORTION OF THE DATA HAND CHUNKED 
HOW MUCH UM WELL 
HOW MUCH 
IN SWITCHBOARD 
SWITCHBOARD IS ALL CHUNKED 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
WELL 
NO YOU HAD PENN TREE BANK PARSES AND YOU MADE CHUNKS FROM THAT 
MM-HMM 
SO ANYBODY GONNA PARSE 
SO ANY GONNA TRY TO ANYBODY TRY TO PARSE THE AMI DATA 
WELL THEY'RE USING THE U. R. G. RIGHT 
THE WHICH PROBABLY HAS A L MAYBE FINER G UH WHICH I BELIEVE HAS FINER GRAINED DISTINCTIONS THAN AND DIFFERENT LABELS THAN THE PENN TREE BANK 
IT'S I'M IT IT'S PROBABLY EASY TO DUMB DOWN THE H. P. S. G. PARSE TOO 
'CAUSE THE PENN TREE BANK PARSERS ARE PRETTY MINIMAL BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANNA COMMIT TO A SPECIFIC GRAMMATICAL THEORY 
SO I MEAN IT PROBABLY IS WORTH LOOKING AT 
'CAUSE THEY'RE DOING THIS WITH DAN FLICKINGER RIGHT 
WHICH IS THE SAME UM PARSER AS THE REDWOODS TREE BANK WAS MADE WITH THAT ALEX TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY 
SO YOU CAN LOOK AT REDWOODS PARSES 
UM AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT THEY ARE FROM TREE BANK PARSES 
AND YOU MIGHT WANNA TALK TO ALEX TO FIND OUT OF SOMEBODY'S ALREADY DONE THIS TURN REDWOODS STUFF INTO TREE BANK STUFF IS THAT THEY CAN COMPARE 
YOU KNOW AGAINST RESULTS THAT ARE REPORTED ON TREE BANK 
WELL THAT WAS THE IDEA I BELIEVE BUT UM 
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ANOTHER TREE BANK 
WELL THE GOOD THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THEN YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH AND PARSE YOU'LL BE GETTING THE SAME CHUNKS SO WHEN YOU DO THIS PROCESS AUTOMATICALLY 
'CAUSE THE PROBLEM W WHEN YOU GO THROUGH AND HAND DO IT IS THEN SUDDENLY YOU INTRODUCE YOUR AUTOMATIC METHOD AND YOUR ACCURACY GOES CAN GO AWAY DOWN 
I MEAN SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T IF YOU KNOW SORT OF FOR PART OF SPEECH TAGGING YOU KNOW 
WHETHER YOU DO IT BY HAND OR MACHINE IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME ACCURACY RIGHT 
BUT 
THEY TALKED ABOUT IT AT THE MEETING THAT WE WANT TO ONE 
TWENTE 
I WAS THINKING ENSCHEDE 
WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER THE ON THE OF THE RIGHT NAME OF THIS PLACE 
YES TWENTE 
WHICH 
YOU WERE THERE JEAN 
YEAH OKAY 
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO 
I I I KNOW YOU MISSED A MEETING AND SO AND SO THERE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN YOU MISSED THE ON ON T. N. O. 
NO NO WHICH PROJECT 
SORRY I DIDN'T GET THAT 
VERBMOBIL RIGHT 
YES YES THEY DID 
IT WELL THAT'S THAT'S WHAT ALEX TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY RIGHT 
THE PARSE I MEAN THAT'S WASN'T SOMETHING SHE DID BUT THAT'S THE DATA SHE'S USING RIGHT 
SO WE HAVE ALL THAT STUFF HERE YOU KNOW THE PARSED VERBMOBIL MATERIAL 
SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT AND SO WHAT THE PARSE TREES LOOK LIKE 
YOU DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR D. F. K. I. 
AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU THINK UH THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAP THIS INTO PENN TREE BANK STYLE BRACKETING 
THEN THEN WE HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT 
BUT I THINK THEY HAD THAT IN MIND 
SO IT'S IT'S WORTH ALSO TALKING TO HEAR ABOUT THAT 
OKAY GOOD 
EVERYBODY ALWAYS SAYS THERE'S NO DATA LIKE MORE DATA 
YOU KNOW I MEAN THE TYPICAL THING IS TO DO LEAVE ONE TO CROSS VALIDATION WITH YOU KNOW EIGHTY NINE DIALOGUES 
OKAY SO I TRAINED ON EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEN RE I TRAIN ON ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE AND OKAY BUT WE SHOULD SPEAK TO STEVE 
WE MIGHT HAVE SOME UM 
WELL THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT IS CHUNKING GONNA HELP 
I MEAN I THINK CHUNKING COULD HELP AUTOMATIC DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTATION 
I THINK CHUNKING COULD HELP US YOU MENTIONED NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION 
UM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL WE'D WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE PRETTY HAPPY THAT IT'S RELIABLE BECAUSE 
MM YEAH 
I MEAN OTHERWISE 
YOU GET THIS VERY BIZARRE RESULTS BECAUSE THE DATA IS NOT REALLY VERY GOOD 
SO UM BUT I AND NOBODY HAS EXPRESSED LIKE MASSIVE INTEREST IN IT IN CHUNKING 
SO I THINK YOU KNOW NOBODY'S UH WAITING FOR IT 
BUT BUT WE COULD WE C I THINK WE SHOULD TALK TO BARBARA ABOUT HOW TO DO SOME JOINT EXPERIMENTS OR OR IF SHE'S GONNA BE SENDING OTHER PEOPLE 
MAYBE LIZ OR WHOEVER COMES OVER NEXT TIME 
UH AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE GREAT IF IT WAS LIZ BECAUSE I THINK SHE IS THE ONE WHO DID THE DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTATION AUTOMATIC 
SHE JUST SAID THAT HOPEFULLY BY THE NEXT MEETING SHE WOULD BE BRINGING SOMEONE ELSE OR SOMEONE ELSE WOULD BE COMING INSTEAD OF HER REMEMBER 
THE THE NOT TO HAVE NOT TO HAVE TO DONE BUT JUST TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT COULD INTERACT WITH AUTOMATIC DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTATION 
UM AND W I GUESS WE SHOULD TALK TO YOSHI ABOUT ABOUT IT IN RELATIONSHIP TO NAMED ENTITIES 
WHO'S UH WHO'S DOING NAMED ENTITIES BESIDES YOSHI 
OKAY 
SO WE COULD TALK TO VASILIS ABOUT THAT AS WELL 
AND THEN 
SO ONE THING THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR UM BECAUSE I HAVEN'T READ I THINK WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE JEAN YOU KNOW 
HAS READ A LOT OF LITERATURE AND I'VE READ A LOT OF LITERATURE AND WE THERE IS SOME OVERLAP 
BUT THERE'S ALSO QUITE A BIG SPACE WHERE WE DON'T KNOW THE LITERATURE FROM THE OTHER SIDE 
AND SINCE YOU'RE GONNA BE READING IT I MEAN IT WOULD BE PROBABLY BE USEFUL IF YOU MADE SOME KIND OF 
YOU KNOW REPORT THAT DESCRIBED YOU KNOW OKAY THIS WHAT THESE PEOPLE YOU KNOW THIS IS 
YOU KNOW A SYNTHESIS OKAY HERE'S THE BASIC IDEA BEHIND EXCHANGE STRUCTURE AND 
YOU KNOW HERE'S A COUPLE OF YOU KNOW HERE'S THE TWO MOST RELEVANT WORKS THAT I'VE READ OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW IT JUST 
OR EVEN JUST LIKE A PARAGRAPH OF YOU KNOW THE BASIC IDEA 
JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT GONNA GO REA OFF AND RED ALL THOSE KIND OF STUFF BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME 
AND YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ ALL THIS COLLABORATIVE PROL PROBLEM SOLVING 
SO 
WELL IN ANY WAY EVERY TIME YOU WRITE A PAPER YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK AND DO THIS RELATED WORK THING ANYWAY 
SO IT JUST TO JUST MAKES IT A LOT EASIER UM TO GET THAT 
COMMON GROUND I THINK YOU KNOW 
I THINK IT'S A REAL ADVANTAGE THAT WE'VE READ DIFFERENT THINGS AND COME TO IT FROM A DIFFERENT SIDE BECAUSE I THINK THIS UH THEY THE THE PREVIOUS APPROACHES HAVEN'T REALLY 
YOU KNOW TAKEN YOU KNOW THE GOOD FEATURES FROM YOU KNOW BOTH SIDES AND AND TRIED TO PUT THEM TOGETHER 
YEAH ME TOO 
I CAN SEND YOU A L 
WELL I THINK WE BOTH WANNA SEND W WELL I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THIS BUT I YOU KNOW 
I WILL SEND YOU ARE WE CAN YOU KNOW 
CHAT OFF LINE FOR A MINUTE A BIT A LIST OF THINGS THAT I THINK YOU REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT 
AND JEAN PROBABLY MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME 
UM 
AND IF SABRINA HAS ANY IDEAS WE'D BE HAPPY TO HEAR FROM SABRINA AS WELL 
UM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL I THINK WE NEED TO ME LIKE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER UM FACTOR ON WHAT THIS MIGHT BE USED FOR IN THE END 
AND SO EVEN IF IT WE WON'T IT WON'T BE USED 
MAYBE IF IT WOULD NEED SOME HIGHER LEVEL ANALYSIS BEFORE IT COULD BE DIRECTLY USED FOR THAT PURPOSE WE SHOULD STILL KEEP THAT IN MIND 
AND SO I THINK GOING THROUGH THE PRESENTATIONS THAT UM WERE GIVEN TO THE WORK PACKAGE SIX MEETING WHERE UM AND I THINK IT WAS UM IT WASN'T WHO WAS IT INTO OUR WAS IT UH I'VE FORGOTTEN HER NAME 
THE OTHER WOMAN UM FROM TWENTE YOU KNOW THEY TALKED ABOUT 
THEY DID THEY HAD DONE A LOT OF QUESTIONNAIRES AND THEY GOT SOME USER REQUIREMENTS OUT OF THAT 
AND THEN STEVE PRESENTED UM THE RESULTS OF FOLLOWING PEOPLE AROUND AND LOOKING AT HOW THEY SAID THEIR NOTES FROM MEETINGS 
AND AND SO THAT WOULD GIVE US SOME IDEAS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WANT YOU KNOW OUT OF MEETING RECORDS 
BUT THEN WE SHOULD ALSO ADD THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE INTERESTING 
BUT JUST TO HAVE TO KEEP SOME OF THOSE GOALS IN MIND 'CAUSE THEY'RE T O ONE SCHEME MIGHT LET YOU ANSWER THIS SET OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WOULDN'T HELP YOU AT ALL WITH ANOTHER SET OF QUESTIONS 
SO SHOULD WE EXPECT THAT ALL THE SLIDES FROM LIKE THE WORK PACKAGE SIX MEETING ARE THE JOINT WORK PACKAGE FIVE WORK PA WILL BE U UP IN ONE OF THE WORK PACKAGE WEB SITES 
AND IF NOT HOW DO WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN 
HMM OKAY 
SOME OF THIS WAS PRESENTED IN AT LEAST THE ONE SPIDER PHONE OR THE SECOND SPIDER PHONE TELECON I WANT IT FOR WORK PACKAGE SIX 
SO IF THEY'RE NOT IN THE WEB WE CAN TRY TO LOOK AT THAT 
YOU KNOW AT THE MATERIALS THAT WERE PRESENTED IN THAT TELECON WITHOUT NECESSARILY LISTENING TO THE WHOLE TELECON 
YEAH 
WOAH 
AND STEVE UM AND HIS I'VE FORGOTTEN THE NAME IS IT WAS IT SIMON HIS YEAH 
THEY THEY'VE I THINK THEY MAY HAVE WRITTEN THIS UP UM IN A REPORT UM 
BUT I WOU WOULD HOPE THAT'S IN THE WORK PACKAGE SIX WEB SITE AS WELL 
I DO SO I ONCE HE'S READ A COUPLE MORE I MEAN HE'S JUST COMPLETELY MISSED OUT THE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING WORLD 
WHICH I D I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
I MEAN YOU MAY TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT AND SAY NO YOU'RE WRONG AND HERE'S WHY BUT I I I'M GONNA NEED SOME CONVINCING 
OR IT OR OR TWO AND SO THIS ONE GIVES YOU THIS AND THIS GO AND CAN'T YOU KNOW ARE THEY FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE 
OR CAN WE YEAH MM-HMM 
OKAY 
I THINK THIS IS GONNA TAKE ABOUT THREE WEEKS 'CAUSE HE'S GOT PLENTY OF READING TO DO 
SO MAYBE WE GET TOGETHER AGAIN IN THE YEAH I MEAN I'LL SEND THEM THE REFERENCES IMMEDIATELY 
SO THAT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU DO YOU THINK 
SO THAT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU TO TO READ AND THINK ABOUT 
IF YOU IF IF IT'S TOO TIGHT YOU KNOW I THINK UM WE CAN SAY FOUR 
OR OR YOU GONNA BE ON HOLIDAY 
YEAH 
MAYBE FOUR WEEKS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER PROBABLY IN ABOUT FOUR WEEKS YES 
SO WHEN ARE YOU GONNA BRING THIS BEAUTIFUL BABY IN IT IS EVERYBODY 
GOOD GOOD 
THAT'S GREAT 
YEP 
WELL GOOD LUCK SOLVING YOUR PROBLEM 
I HAVE TO TICK AND TICK 
IT DOES SOMETHING WEIRD WHEN YOU DO THAT 
YEAH MM-HMM 
HMM 
THANK YOU 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
I D 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YES 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MEETING ACTION 
THEY JUST MENTION THAT THEY WANT DECISION UM FOR ISSUES ACTION ITEMS 
I THINK THEY ARE MORE TALKING ABOUT UM USER REQUIREMENT FOR THE MEETING THAN SOFT TEXT THEY WANT TO KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENED HAPPENING IN A MEETING 
THEY SAY THAT 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
CONTACT 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UM RIGHT NOW D UH I'M DOING I'M TRYING TO DO THE UH MEETING ACTION SEGMENTATION 
JU BECAUSE UH AFTER TALKING TO JANE UM JUST UH WE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS WHETHER UH MEETING ACTION WILL BE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS TOPIC SEGMENTS 
SO UM IT WOULD BE GOOD TO ME TOO RIGHT NOW I'M DOING THIS 
UM LOOKING AT THE DATA AND TRYING TO SEE IF I CAN DO THE MEETING ACTION SEGMENTATION FIRST AND THE SCHEME 
AND THEN DO TOPIC SEGMENTATION AGAIN TO USE OF THE BOUNDARY ACTUALLY COINCIDE WITH EACH OTHER 
YEAH IF IF THAT THAT DO THEN MAYBE WE CAN TALK AGAIN WHETHER UM I IT TO MAKE SENSE 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT YEAH 
UM I HAVE JUST STARTED 
AND UM SO FOR UM I S THINK UH IT'S UH IT I THINK IT IT'S A STILL UM BUT THE IS ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL OF SEGMENTATION WE'RE TALKING HERE 
BUT UH MAYBE THE BOUNDARY WILL NOT BE EXACTLY THE SAME 
BUT UH THAT THAT THE SEGMENT 
MM-HMM RIGHT SURE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM SURE 
YES 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 
I WANT TO USE 
SOMETHING 
SURE 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT SO IT IT'S READY 
OKAY GREAT 
YEAH EVERYTHING'S OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY OKAY YEAH 
OKAY THANKS 
OKAY 
OKAY THANKS 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH A VERY OR A QUICK UH SLIDES 
SO UM I'VE BEEN HERE FOR FOURTEEN MONTH I THINK 
YEAH SO I'VE A ACCUSTOMED TO THE ENVIRONMENT HERE AND ENJOY STAYING HERE 
SO MM UH 
FROM UH LAST YEAR I WAS UH UH SO UH SUPERVISING THE ANNOTATION OF SEGMENTATION 
SUMMARISATION UH UH WITH JEAN UH OF THE I UH IC ICSI CORPUS AND UH UH UH IN THE OTHER HAND UH I W IN UH DID S SOME VERY PRELIMINARY WORK ON CHUNKING THE SWITCHBOARD CORPUS 
BUT UH THAT WAS NOT UH WELL PICKED UP ON THE AMI CORPUS WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE 
SO UH AND CURRENTLY I'M MORE INTERESTED IN IS UH UH YEAH ANALYSING THE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS 
THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO PRESENT HERE 
SO UH 
UH IN THIS PRESENTATION I'M GOING TO SEE HOW WE COULD ANALYSE UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE RELATIONS IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS 
UM 
'CAUSE MEETINGS AS A LOT DIFFERENT FROM NORMAL TEXT OR A IN A NORMAL DIALOGUE OR MONOLOGUE 
SO INTERACTIVITY IS A CONCEPT IS A CONCEPT THAT I'M USING TO DISTINGUISH THE TWO UH UH EXTREMES OF UH OF INTERAC UH OF DISCOURSE IN MEETINGS 
AND UH FOR DIALOGUES UH AND MONOLOGUES I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO USE DIFFERENT UH CONCEPTS TO M M UH MODEL THE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE 
THEN UH I W I WILL UH GIVE A VERY UH ROUGH PLAN FOR THE NEXT UH COUPLE OF MONTH 
AND FINALLY I I WILL INTR I INTRODUCE SOME RELATED WORK YEAH 
SO 
THE BIG QUESTION THAT I'M CONCERN HERE SO WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UTTERANCES IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS 
OR HOW DO WE ANALYSE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE RIGHT ABOVE UTTERANCES INSTEAD OF UH THIS HIGH LEVEL INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE OF DISCOURSE 
SO THE CONCERN HERE IS ABOUT THE VERY LOCAL LOW LEVEL UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE RELATIONS IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS 
UH THIS IS THE LOCAL DISCOURSE STRUCTURE 
SO THE UH BUILDING BLOCK OF THAT KIND OF UH STRUCTURE WOULD BE THE UH UTTERANCE AND POSSIBLY ONE OF ITS PROPERTIES 
THE DIALOGUE ACT WHICH WE'RE CURRENTLY UH WORKING ON OUR UH AND UH FOUR MEETINGS 
YEAH SO I'VE MENTIONED UH UH BEFORE THAT MEETINGS AS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM UH MONOLOGUE AND UH DIALOGUES 
SO UH IN MEETINGS I UH FROM MY UH READING OF THE ONE OF THE AMI MEETINGS I. S. ONE O. EIGHT UH THE UH THE FOUR MEETINGS 
I NOTICED THAT UH UH THE INTERACTION DEGREES OF INTERACTION IN THE MEETINGS UH VARIES FROM PARTS TO PARTS 
SO FOR SOME PART UH THE INTERACTION IS VERY STRONG 
SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A DIALOGUE 
BUT UH FOR SOME PART PART WHERE THE INTERACTION IS VERY WEAK UH JUST UH LIKE THE UH CHAIRMAN OR PROJECT MANAGER SO MM 
UH COORDINATING THE MEETING 
HE'S UH PUSHING THE MEETING FORWARD THEN THIS KIND OF S ORGAN ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OR PART 
UH UH AND ALSO OTHER PR UH PARTS LIKE UH THE BACK CHANNELS WITHOUT ANY UH SEMANTIC CONTENT UH FROM THEIR PARTICIPANTS 
SO THIS KIND OF UH INTERACTION MIGHT BE BETTER ANALYSED AS MONOLOGUE WHICH UH IN WHICH THERE IS INTERACTION I SUPPOSE 
SO 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
SO YEAH SO THIS IS GOING TO BE BASED ON THE UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE 
SO FOR THIS UTTERANCE THE NEXT UTTERANCE IF IT'S FROM ANOTHER PA UH SPEAKER 
THEN UH IF IT'S NOT A BACK CHANNEL OR UH SOMETHING SIMILAR THEN IT'S A DIALOGUE 
SO IF SPEAK CHANGES 
SO YEAH SPEAKER CHANGE SO 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH BU BUT UH SH SHORT UH TURNS UH LIKE MM OR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR MIGHT BE THE UH SEG SECOND TYPE OF INTERACTIVITY 
THE WEAK INTERACTIVITY 
THAT MIGHT NOT BE ANALYSED AS A UH MONOLOGUE BUT AS A DIAL UH NO NO NO WRONG UH NOT AS DIALOGUE BUT SO UM A MONOLOGUE 
YEAH 
SO FOR THAT PART UH FOR THAT KIND OF BACK CHANNELS WE CAN JUST SKIP THAT AND UH UH IT NOT TREAT THEM AS INTERRUPTIONS OR SOMETHING LIKE 
THEN YEAH WE COULD JUST UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SPEAK CHANGE SPEAK CHANGE WOULD BE YEAH 
IF IF IT'S UH JUST SOME KIND OF BACK CHANNEL OR IT'S JUST A SIGNAL SIGNAL THE USE THE SPEAKER IS LISTENING OR IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
UM 
YEAH SO 
OH YEAH 
UH SO FOR INTERACTIVITY THIS IS THE ONLY SLIDE 
SO YEAH ACTIVITY IS UH I'D DEFINE INTERACTIVITY TO BE AS A DEGREES OF INTERACTION IN MEETINGS 
SO WHICH MIGHT UH SPEAK CHANGE WHI UH UH WOULD BE A VERY GOOD INDICATOR YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
NO NO 
YEAH 
NO YEAH 
SO ACTUALLY SO UH THIS IS A VERY ROUGH IDEA OF INTERACTIVITY 
IF WE GO FURTHER WE MIGHT DISTINGUISH UH THE INTERACTIVITY BETWEEN TWO IF THERE ARE ALL THE GROUPS 
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOME FINAL DEFINITION FOR THE UH INTERACTIVITY YEAH 
YEAH SO THAT MIGHT BE THE SECOND CLASS YEAH 
WEAK THIS IS A KIND OF WEAK INTERACTIVITY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S ALSO TRUE 
YEAH 
SO YEAH YEAH ACTUALLY 'CAUSE UH I'VE LOOKED UH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO FOR THAT CASE YEAH UH YEAH SO THIS MIGHT BE A WEAK DEFINITION OF INTERACTIVITY 
SO IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT UH IF THEY ARE REALLY INTERACTI UH INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER OR JUST UH UH INCREMENTAL MM PRESENTATION OF SOME INFORMATION 
SO THAT'S D UH DIFFERENT 
WE MIGHT UM YEAH AND A MORE STRICT OR FINER UH DEFINITION OF INTERACTIVITY 
YEAH J UH FOR THIS IS OF THE UH FOR THE EASE OF THIS TERM FOR THE INDICATOR OF THE UH DEGREES OF INTERACTION 
UH I THINK FOR FOR THE CURRENT UH PROPOSAL I THINK THAT IT'S JUST FOR DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIALOGUES AND MONOLOGUES 
'CAUSE FOR THESE TWO TYPES OF DISCOURSE UH THE UH 
THE THE CONS THE THE TWO THAT WE ARE GOING TO ANALYSE THE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE MIGHT BE D DIFFERENT 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
AND ALSO 'CAUSE UH I HAVE UH READ SOME OF THE M. A. T. A. UH CORPUS 
UH SO FOR SOME PART OF THE THAT KIND OF MEETINGS UM UH SEVERAL UTTERANCES OR DIALOGUE ACTS ARE JUST UH TAGGED AS STATEMENT 
SO THAT I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY INFORMATIVE FOR HIGH LEVEL STR ANALYSIS 
SO THAT'S ALL WHAT UH THAT'S WHY WHY UH I'M DISTINGUISHING THE TWO KINDS OF DISCOURSE HERE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THE LIKE YEAH 
YESTERDAY YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MIGHT BE A 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
NO JUST A UH TURN EXCHANGE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
ACTUALLY SH UH SHE USED SOME A A A BUNCH OF FEATURES TO DO THE AUTOMATIC PARSING 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OH YEAH 
UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE YEAH 
VERY LOW LEVEL YEAH 
YOU C YEAH 
YEAH I IT UH JUST WE NEED TO USE UH HOW WELL WE COULD WORK OUT OF THE UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO UH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
NO 
HMM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SO YEAH FOR INTERACTIVITY THIS IS A VERY WEAK DEFINITION YEAH 
IF WE NEED MORE THAN WE MIGHT USE SOME MORE FINER UH F FINER UH DEFINITION FOR INTERACTIVITY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OKAY 
SO MM SO FOR DIALOGUE YEAH MM THERE WOULD BE UH SOME KIND OF UH INTERACTION STRUCTURE 
SO IT FOR UH IN PREVIOUS DISCOURSE STUDIES UH ESPECIALLY IN DISCOURSE ANALYSIS EXCHANGE UH IS USED TO DESCRIBE THIS KIND OF UH LOCAL STRUCTURE 
AND IN CONVERSATION THE ANALYSIS SO ADJACENCY PAIRS ARE USED TO DESCRIBE THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE 
OH 
BUT UH IN THESE TWO STRANDS OR WORK THEY UH JUST CAME UP WITH A LIST MAYBE NOT UH EXHAUSTIVE 
SO UH I'M BEEN THINK ABOUT UH IF WE COULD COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF MORE PRINCIPAL SCHEME UH TAKING SOME OF THE UH INFORMATION ON THE UH UH UH IN THE UH INTERACTION UH INTO ACCOUNT 
LIKE UH IS THE SMALL PART OF INTERACTION IS IS EXCHANGING SOME INFORMATION 
UH HERE INFORMATION IS A LITTLE VAGUE 
IT COULD BE SOME KIND OF KNOWLEDGE WHAT THE UH SPEAKER KNOWS OR OR SOME KIND OF THOUGHT WHAT THE SPEAKER IS THINKING 
SO THESE TWO KIND OF UH INFORM MM TWO KINDS OF THE INFORMATION UH MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF A DIFFERENCE 
SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE BELL'S MM EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION UH FOR THE KNOWLEDGE 
IF EXCHANGE OF UH OPINION UH UH SOME KIND OF SO IT'S UH VERY RELATED TO THOUGHT OF THINKING YEAH 
UH IN SOME CASE IT S DIFFERS 'CAUSE UH WHEN WE EXCHANGE KNOWLEDGE WE MIGHT NOT CHALLENGE UH THE SPEAKER 
BUT UH WHEN THE SPEAKER IS UH PR UH SO UH TALK ABOUT WHAT HE FEELS WHAT HE THINKS 
IS PROPOSING SOMETHING OR IS UH THEN OTHER SPEAKERS MIGHT MIGHT CHAN CHALLENGE HIM OR HERE 
SO THAT KIND OF STRUCTU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT UH THAT MIGHT BE BE SOME DIFFERENCE INTER INTERACTION PAR PATTERNS 
MIGHT BE 
'CAUSE UH FOR INFORMATION IF WE UH SOMEBODY'S UH SEEKING SOME INFORMATION THEN UH UH ASK SOME QUESTION AND UH THE ONE KNOWS WILL UH GIVES GIVES THE ANSWER 
BUT UH UH FOR THE UH OPINION OR THOUGHT UH STUFF 
THEN THE SPEAKER MIGHT JUST UH UH PRESENT SOME IDEA AND OTHERS WILL COMMENT OR UH CHALLENGE UH THE IDEA 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S VAGUE YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
MM SO 'CAUSE UH AS FAR I'M S STILL LOOKING FOR A UH IS CALLED PRINCIPAL SCHEME FOR THE INTERACTION UH FOR THE INTERACTION 
SO 
YEAH SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SO YEAH FOR UH P UH THE DISCOURSE ANALYSIS THEY'RE USING EXCHANGE 
BUT UH THEY HAVE AN UH NO CLASSIFICATION JUST TO COME UP WITH OKAY SO UH YOU MEAN UH 
UH SINCLAIR AND COULTHARD 
THAT IS 
ALSO AT GENEVA SCHOOL THEY I DON'T THINK THEY LOST SOME KIND OF EXCHANGE 
BUT UH THE UH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE UH AND UH YEAH EXCHANGE IS FIRST UH DEVELOPED AN UH SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONAL GRAMMAR ALONG THE UH UH HALLIDAY AND AND MARTIN'S WORK 
YEAH 
SO UH ACTUALLY THEY THEY HAVE SOME SOMETHING IN IN A TEXTBOOK ABOUT THE EXCHANGE 
UH THEY CALL IT NEGOTIATION 
SO THEY HAVE UH SOME FLOW CHARTS OF THE UH UH DETAILED ANALYSIS OF UH UH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE YEAH 
YEAH 
SO UM UH I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY KIND OF PRINCIPLE CLASSIFICATION OF EXCHANGES 
THIS IS I YEAH WE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM 
YEAH I. R. F. UH KIND OF STRUCTURE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
MM 'CAUSE UH FROM MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WE SEE ANANYS ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION SEEKING DIALOGUES OVER TELEPHONES 
SO IT'S UM UH ABOUT THE TOURISM INFORMATION 
SO FROM UH M MY ANALYSIS OF THAT KIND OF DIALOGUES I COULD SAY THAT THERE'S ONLY THERE ONLY FOUR BASIC UH EXCHANGES DEPEND ON THE INFORMATION UH DIRECTION OF THE INFORMATION FLOW 
AND ALSO THE SPEAKER ROLE 
'CAUSE IN THE INFORMATION SEEKING DIALOGUES THE UH T ROLES OF THE TWO PARTICIPANTS ARE DIFFERENT 
ONE IS MAINLY THE UH FROM THE UH AGENCY A TOURISM AGENCY 
THAT IS MENU UH UH INFORMATION PROVIDER UH WHILE THE CUSTOMER IS THE INFORMATION SEEKER MAINLY 
YEAH THAT'S UH SO THEREF UH AND ALSO MM UH THE DIRECTION OF INFORMATION FLOWS FOR SOME KIND OF INFORMATION 
LIKE UH THE UH UH PRICE OF A SPECIFIC ROUTE 
UH THE SPOTS THEY'RE GOING TO UH VISIT AND ALSO IN THE UH KINDS OF UH V UH VEHICLE OR OR TRANSPORTATION YEAH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH SO YEAH YEAH 
SO BUT THERE ALSO SOME VARIATIONS WHICH I CALL COMPLEX EXCHANGES 
SO THAT'S UH THAT'S UH JUST A LIST 
MM NOT LIKE THE UH BASIC EXCHANGE UH EXCHANGES YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH PARAMETRI YEAH I I I'M LOOKING FOR PARAMETRIC YEAH SCHEME 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S UH Y YEAH 
A PARAME PARAMETER OR PRINCIPLE 
YEAH SOME SOMETHING LIKE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND ALSO YEAH 
A AND ALSO IS ONE 'CAUSE IN THE MEETINGS UH THE SPEAKERS MIGHT MIGHT REPORT SOMETHING UH THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND UH UH UH UH TALK ABOUT THE WHAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DOING AND ALSO PLANNING SOME FUTURE ACTIONS 
SO THIS KIND OF INFORMATION MIGHT ALSO BE HELPFUL 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UH NOT MARKING 
JUST UH FOR MY UH READING OF THE UH U. I. S. ONE O. EIGHT UH FOR MEETING SERIES 
YEAH JUST TO READING THIS PART YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO THIS IS FOR THE UH DIALOGUE PART 
FOR MONOLOGUES UH THIS IS UH YEAH 
OKAY SO ONE FURTHER UH INFORMATION IS HERE 
OH 
OH 
MM 'CAUSE UH SO FOR THE INFORMATION AND ACTION THE UH THE ACTION HERE IS NOT DIALOGUE ACT BUT UH SOME KIND OF UH UH PHYSICAL ACTION UH THAT UH THE UH PARTICIPANT'S UH I I IS GOING TO UH OUR HAS DONE IN THE PAST 
HE'S GOING TO DO THE FUTURE 
SO 
UH NOT 
PHYSICAL SENSE YEAH 
PHYSICAL SENSE YEAH 
YEAH SO UH THIS KIND OF MIGHT BE THE UH SOME KIND OF SEMANTICS OF THE UTTERANCE OR OR EXCHANGE 
SO UH THIS IS JUST ONE UM THING I ONE PARAMETER UH FOR MM-HMM 
OH 
I MEAN UH HERE THE SCHEME IS FOR EXCHANGE SCHEME 
SO YEAH FOR UH FOR FOR UH EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 
SO THERE MIGHT BE THE UH S SPEAKER AND UH UH A HEARER 
SO WHO SPEAKS TO WHOM AND UH UH 
SO SO THIS IS THE UH UH SO DIRECTION OF THE INFORMATION FLOW AND ALSO S SPEAKER ROLE MIGHT BE FIRST UH PARAMETERS FOR THE UH EX UH INFORMATION EXCHANGES 
SO UM BUT FOR ACTION THAT MIGHT BE UH SOME KIND OF UH PROPOSE OR ACCEPT OR REJECT KIND OF UH UH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE I MEAN 
UH-HUH 
OH NO NO 
NO THAT'S UH THAT'S THE UH 
SO WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING AND UH UH SO COULD YOU DO SOMETHING OR THIS KIND OF UH ACTION RELATED UTTERANCE I MEAN 
YEAH 
OKAY TECHNICAL SENSE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OKAY YEAH YEAH 
OKAY YEAH THAT'S ONE 
HMM 
BEFORE COME UP WITH THE SCHEME YOU MEAN 
YEAH 
EXCH 
SO YEAH 
OH YEAH 
S STENT YEAH STENT MIGHT DOES UM YEAH 
STENT YEAH 
MM NO 
UH SO SO 'CAUSE I'M I MIGHT NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS ONE 
MM-HMM 
SO UH SO AT THE WORK UH DESCRIBED IN THE C UH NO NO UH IN THE COCONUT PROJECT OR SOMETHING SIMILAR 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
Y YEAH LIKE UH NOT VERY MUCH DETAIL YEAH 
YEAH 
NO NOT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YES YES 
YEAH I KNOW OKAY 
OH 
UH I KNOW THIS GUY YEAH YEAH 
UH JIM @'S STUDENT 
YEAH I KNOW 
NO NO NO SAA SAARBRUECKEN 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH I KNOW HERE 
OKAY 
NO 
MM-HMM 
NO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO MAIN ACTIONS I GUESS MIGHT BE SOME SOME HIGH LEVEL UH PROBLEM SOLVING OR DECISION MAKING UH UH CONCEPTS 
UH NOT LIKE THE EXCHANGE WHICH WHICH I I WOULD LIKE TO BE VERY LOW LEVEL UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE RELATIONS 
UH I MEAN UH I MEAN THE M MAIN ACTIONS MIGHT BE SOME IT MIGHT BE YEAH BUILT BUILT 
OKAY SO WELL WE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
PHYSICAL 
SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIONS YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH DIFFERENT SCHEME YEAH 
SO YEAH UH THE THE THE MAIN ACTIONS THAT UH YOU'RE TALK ABOUT I THINK MIGHT BE YEAH BUILT UP FROM THE EXCHANGE YEAH 
EX AT LEAST EXCHANGE MIGHT BE UH ONE KIND OF UH IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THAT KIND OF 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
NEXT 
YEAH 
SO YEAH FOR THE MONOLOGUE I'VE I HAVE NOT UH LOOKED INTO THE DETAILS ABOUT THE THIS KIND OF UH RELATIONS FOR THE MONOLOGUE PARTS 
JUST A LIST OF THIS UH RELATIONS 
AND UH SO UH NEXT I NEED TO UH REVIEW THE LITERATURE AND UH COME UP WITH S SCHEMES FOR THE REAL DATA ANNOTATION 
AND AFTER THAT UH W W 'CAUSE THIS MM IS NOT IN THE HUB CORPUS 
SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET AL ALL THE MEETINGS ANNOTATED WITH THAT KIND OF 
SO UH SO WE WE MIGHT JU FIRST TRY A FEW MEETINGS AND UH HAVE A RELIABILITY STUDY 
IF IT'S RELIABLE ENOUGH 
THEN WE MUST JUST UH JUST ANNOTATE A SMALL PART OF THE MEETINGS AND USING SOME LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO BOOT BOOT STRAP THE UH UH AUTOMATIC UH ANALYSER 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OF UH IF IT'S BASED ON THE UH UM DIALOGUE ACTS YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
YES 
HMM 
OR FITS THE MEETING BROWSER 
YEAH 
OKAY SO MM 
THIS MIGHT NOT BE 
THE FINAL GOAL THAT UH THAT COULD BE FIT INTO THE UH BROWSER 
BUT IT UH MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF UH UH INFORMATION WHICH MIGHT BENEFIT MEETING ACTIONS ARE SOME MORE HIGH LEVEL DECISION MAKING OUR PROBLEM SOLVING 
'CAUSE THIS IS THE BUILDING BLOCKS I GUESS YEAH 
SO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
SO AFTER THIS OF UH OF UH UH WE MIGHT DO SOME MM P UH FROM HERE WE MIGHT BE SOME UH UH 
YEAH C PROBLEM SOLVING DECISION MAKING PROCESS TO TRACK THAT KIND OF INFORMATION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MESSY 
YEAH YEAH 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
Y YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH M M UH SO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S KIND OF UH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
DIFFERENT FEATURE COMBINATION YEAH 
YEAH YES 
UH UH YEAH 
UH I MEAN I WAS SUPPOSED TO CHUNK UH SOME PART OF THE AMI MEETINGS 
YOU KNOW TO USE OF THE CHUNKER CHANNEL SWITCHBOARD WORKS WELL ENOUGH OR NOT 
IF NOT THEN MM WE HAVE TO USE SOME KIND OF SEMI SUPERV SUPERVISED LEARNING OR SOME UH BOOT STRAPPING TO TO TO DO THE CHUNKING 
NO NO 'CAUSE I WAS A BIT WORRIED ABOUT UH THIS KIND OF UH DISCOURSE STRUCTURE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH DIALOGUE SEGMENTATON 
YEAH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OR AMI DATA 
NO NO 
OKAY 
SO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH YEAH FOR SWITCHBOARD YEAH 
DIRECT CHUNKING 'CAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO IN A TREE OUT OF THE AMI DATA 
UH IS THE UH WE UH D. F. K. I. 'CAUSE THEY'RE WORKING ON SOME H. P. S. G. PARSING 
YEAH MIGHT BE 
MIGHT BE YEAH 
OF THE 
UH OF UH I'M I GUESS THAT IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT THEN WE MIGHT JUST UH WRITE ANOTHER SCRIPT TO DO THE TRANSLATION 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
I NEED TO LOOK AT SOME OF IT IS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
TWENTY MINUTE YEAH 
YEAH 
T. N. O. YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 'CAUSE YEAH THEY DID SOME WORK BIO PROJECT WITH THE H. P. S. G. PARSING 
AT LEAST BE 
YEAH WELL MAYBE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO 
OKAY OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UH NOT SURE C UH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
HMM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH

SO I MIGHT TAKE TWO WEEKS OFF TWO WEEKS OFF IN UH MY YEAH SOMETIMES YEAH 
OFF YEAH 
OKAY THANKS 
OH YEAH HOPE I HOPE IS VERY SOON 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY THANKS 
AND SOMETHING TO FIDGET WITH 
OKAY 
SO 
IN YOUR MARKS GET SET GO 
SUCH A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE DONE THIS 
AT THE BEGINNING WE DID 
UM 
WE DID A TRAINING SET DIDN'T WE AND THEN COMPARED TO USE 
WE PROBABLY DID 
AND SUPPOSEDLY DECIDED ON THINGS 
AND THEN WE DID THE ALL THE REST OF THEM SEPARATELY 
YES I THINK 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT YOU CONVINCED ME 
NO THAT'S TRUE 
MM-HMM 
IT'S THE LENGTH OF IT REALLY 
BUT WE HAD 
THAT'S REALLY HARD YEAH 
MM-HMM 
NO 
YEAH 
AND WE WE HAD A MANUAL WHICH WE HAVEN'T GOT HERE 
DO YOU RECKON IF WE GOT A COPY WOULD THAT BE USEFUL 
ARE WE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE MEETING NOW IT'S STARTED 
CAN WE GET BEN TO PRINT IS IT IN 
MM 
OKAY 
YES NOW WE'RE MOVING WITH THE HEADPHONES 
YES HE'S HE'S BEEN E MAILED TO YEAH 
OTHERWISE WE CAN GO INTO OUR SYSTEM AND GET IT 
YES 
LET'S SAY SOMETHING RUDE 
I UH 
TOP 
BUT ON HOW LITTLE WORK WE DID 
I'M DOING THAT IT YES 
YEAH 
THEY HAVE GOT A 
CONFERENCE THING HAVEN'T THEY 
IN THE A. T. C. 
I HAD TO FLY TO GERMANY TO DO A TELECONFERENCE THE SAME AS YOU DID FOR THE INTERVIEW 
AND THEY FLY YOU TO GERMANY AND PUT YOU IN A FOUR WAY TELECONFERENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN CHILE 
AND HAD THEY ASKED WE COULD HAVE DONE IT FUN TO A. T. C. AND SAVED ME HAVING TO TO GO TO GERMANY FOR A DAY 
BUT 
THEY HAVEN'T GOT THAT FOR 
MM 
AND MINE WAS EVEN IT WAS DIFFERENT AGAIN 
WE WE HAD IT WAS A FOUR WAY SPLIT SCREEN WITH UM AND OTHER OTHER PEOPLE NEED TO JUST STAYED LIKE THAT 
AND I HAD THE TALK ON A LAPTOP IN FRONT OF UM AND THEY HAD THE TALK ON THEIR LAPTOPS 
AND I HAD TO TELL TELL THEM WHEN TO PRESS THE BUTTON TO TURN THE PAGE 
IT JUST 
YES IF YOU SEE TOWARDS THE TOP LEFT OF THE IMAGE YOU'LL NOTICE AND LUCKILY OLIVIA HAD WARNED ME IT MIGHT BE COMPLICATED 
AND SO I HAD SOMETHING WITH WITHOUT VERY MANY MO NO NOT LITTLE FLYING IN AND THINGS BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST MAKE IT REALLY DIFFICULT 
BUT I PRACTISED THE TALK YEAH STANDING UP IN FRONT OF IT AND POINTING AT THINGS 
AND YOU'RE SITTING DOWN IN FRONT OF AND YOU COULD SEE YOURSELF BUT NOT ONLY COULD SEE YOU SEE YOURSELF YOU SEE YOURSELF BOUNCE BACK TWO SECONDS LATER 
BY THE TIME THE SIGNAL HAD GONE TO CHILE AND BACK 
SO YOU'RE LIKE UH DID I JUST DO THAT 
AND THEN YOU REACTING TO WHAT YOU ADD A WHILE AGO 
IT WAS A REALLY DAFT SITUATION 
LOVELY 
AND THEN WE CAN START FIGHTING BUT 
YES LET'S 
CONTINUUM FLUX OR CONTINUUM 
MM 
YES 
FLUX IN ITS OWN WOULDN'T BE A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
I THINK IT SHOULD PROBABLY JUST BE CONTINUUM 
IF IT WAS CONTINUUM LUMINOSITY YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T IT 
OH 
OKAY IT'S MY PART 
OH 
I THINK I THINK WE'VE WORKED 
YES AND I'M PRETTY SURE I'M BOTTOM ANYWAY 
SO EVEN IN ONE WE CAN TELL 
'CAUSE I WOULD FIGHT FOR LINE BEING A SPECTRAL FEATURE AS WELL 
IT'S A BIT HARD TO MARK ON THIS 
LET'S DO THAT 
THE ONES WE WANT 
YES 
AND IF NEITHER THEN WE'LL HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING ELSE 
AND I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT SOFT COMPONENT IS A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
OH 
WELL IF YOU DON'T NO 
YEAH GO AHEAD 
MM-HMM 
YOU CAN POINT TO A SOFT COMPONENT 
YEAH 
SO IT 
UH NOW IS A FEATURE PART OF SPECTRAL FEATURE 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AS WELL 
'CAUSE IT IT'S NOT JUST ABSORPTION 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABSORPTION POINT FIVE K. V. 
IT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING ON THE ABSORPTION THAT YOU'RE USING 
IF IT WAS A 
A DIP IN ABSORPTION OR A 
A LACK OF ABSORPTION YOU WOULD PUT IT IN BECAUSE WE SAID WE WOULD PUT DESCRIBING WORDS 
MM-HMM 
YOU WOULD GET A PENCIL 
THAT'S TWO 
UH THERE'S ONE WITH THE EQUIVALENT WIDTH 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WE WE WEREN'T GONNA MARK THE EQUIVALENT WIDTH BUT WE WERE GONNA MARK THE LINES 
BROAD LINE 
AND THAT SHOULD BE A AND NEBULAE 
IS A SOURCE TYPE 
I CAN'T REMEMBER 
SHOULD WE USE WHEN THE MANUAL COMES 
SO LET'S COME BACK TO THAT ONE 
UM 
YEP 
I WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT THAT THERE 
SELECT A 
YEAH THAT SEEMS REASONABLE 
YES 
UM 
BREAKING THE POWER LAW INDEX I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A YOU CAN PAINT IT IT BUT EQUALLY IT'S NOT A IT'S SOMETHING YOU'VE DERIVED 
SO WHAT'S A BREAKING A POWER LAW INDEX 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
OKAY 
SLIGHT DEPRESSION OF THE CONTINUUM NEAR THE LYMAN LIMIT 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AS WELL 
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY WE 
YEAH I IF IT WAS ABSORPTION AT H. ALPHA THAT WOULD ALL BE ONE 
OR ABSORPTION AT FIVE THOUSAND NANOMETRES WOULD ALL BE ONE ANYWAY 
BECAUSE IT WAS IT A CERTAIN POINT 
BUT THIS IS NEAR 
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
IT'S IT'S NEAR RATHER THAN IT 
IT'S NOT 
LET'S MARK THAT THEN 
YES 
SO THAT K. CLEAR 
OH 
MM ABSORPTION 
YES AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AS WELL 
TELL YOU WHO'S MORE AWAKE AT THIS 
MM-HMM 
NO ABSORPTION FEATURE 
THANK YOU 
THERE IS NO STEEP SOFT COMPONENT BUT ARE TWO K. V. 
MM 
YES YOU COULD 
I TEND TO MISS OUT THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO LONG 
UM 
YOU WOULD POINT TO IT 
YEAH 
YES I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
SHOULD WE GO BACK TO NUMBER FIVE 
BUT YES NEBULA 
MM-HMM 
I THINK IT DOES 
WE WEREN'T MATCHING A H. TWO REGIONS BECAUSE IT WAS A REGION I THINK WAS THE ARGUMENT FOR THAT 
LINE AGAIN 
LINE IN RATIOS 
BUT I REMEMBER WE WEREN'T GONNA MARK LINE RATIOS BUT WE WERE GOING TO MARK 'CAU WE'RE HERE WHERE YOU'VE GOT EQUIVALENT WIDTH OF H. BETA ORBITED 
RATIO IS DIFFERENT I GUESS 
MM 
I GUESS IT'S SIMILAR 
DON'T INCLUDE 
SO THAT THE VALUE OR IS THAT THE WORD 
DON'T IT IN INCLUDE THE DERIVED PROPERTY 
YOU WOULDN'T INCLUDE LINE IN THAT 
OKAY 
THE ONE TO KEEP YEAH 
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBERS I THINK THAT'S A SPECTRAL FEATURE EVEN THOUGH IT'S 
YOU WOULDN'T MARK THE SOURCE TYPE 
HERE 
YES BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT IT UNDERLINED 
IT SHOULDN'T BE HIGHLIGHTED 
SO 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT IT'S ALSO A I I IF WE HAVE 
BUT TH BUT YOU ALSO ABSORB THEM BY Y YOU OBSERVE THEM BY THEIR SPECTRAL FEATURE 
WHAT WERE WE DOING FOR THINGS BROAD ABSORPTION LINE QUASAR FOR EXAMPLE 
WE WERE MARKING THE BROAD ABSORPTION LINE AS WELL AS BROAD ABSORPTION LINE QUASAR 
SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THAT 
IF IT'S DEFINED BY A SPECTRAL FEATURE WE SHOULD MARK IT 
HERE 
YOU COULD POINT TO DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA THOUGH 
BECAUSE IT SAYS HERE SPECTRAL FEATURES WE'RE NOW REFERRING TO A TYPE OF SOURCE E. G. QUASAR 
UM NOT A BIS SPECIFIC TYPE OF SOURCE BUT I THINK STILL THE THE SPECTRAL FEATURE GE COUNTS EVEN THOUGH IT'S UM A MODIFIER OF SOMETHING 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON BOB 
HOW DOES IT WORK 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHICH DOESN'T HELP 
MM-HMM 
YOU YOU 
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S YOU COULD STILL SAY THAT'S DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA AND THAT'S DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA 
YOU COULD SAY ALL OF THAT IS DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA 
BUT ISN'T THAT J ALWAYS THE CASE WITH SOMETHING THAT'S NOT PARTICULARLY 
MM-HMM 
IT OUT OF IT WAS IF IT WAS SOME OTHER SPECTRAL FEATURE AND THEN ABSORBERS 
WOULD WE MARK IT 
BUT 
BUT WE INCLUDE MODIFIERS OF SOURCE TYPES WE WOULD MARK 
WE'RE NOT MARKING ABSORBERS 
BUT IF IT WAS A DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA QUASAR 
THEN WE WOULD MARK QUASAR AND WE WOULD MARK DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA 
IF IT WAS BROAD ABSORPTION LINE QUASAR WE'D MARK IT 
YEAH 
SO IT'S JUST I GUESS WHETHER DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA IS A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
IN ITSELF 
WHICH I WOULD PROBABLY SAY IT WAS BUT THEN I'VE NEVER LOOKED AT I NO 
MM-HMM 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S SPECIFIC 
I GUESS YOU YOU KNOW W WE SAY A UH BIG BLUE BUMP OR A SOFT OR A CONTINUUM 
AND WE INCLUDE THIS 
THAT TRUE BUT WE WE HAVE INCLUDED C POWER LAW THOUGH 
WELL NO WE INCLUDED P STEEP SOFT COMPONENT SORRY 
AND HERE WE INCLUDED BREAKING THE POWER LAW BECAUSE OF THE BREAK 
MM-HMM 
BUT THERE'S STILL SOME DEGREE OF FITTING AND IT'S STEEP YOU'RE SAYING 
YOU KNOW WHAT'S STEEP AND WHAT'S SHALLOW 
LET'S HAVE THAT FOR NOW THEN 
YOU IF IF WE CHANGE OUR MIND LATER WHEN WE GO THROUGH WE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK TO IT AND SAY 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
AND ABSORPTION AGAIN 
RIGHT WHAT HAVE WE GOT DIFFERENT HERE 
HMM 
IT'S 
YEAH IT'S THAT ONE AND THIS ONE HERE 
UH WE WERE INCLUDING FEATURE WITHIN SPECTRAL FEATURE 
OKAY 
I THINK I JUST MISSED OUT 
I THINK IT'S NOT SO IF IT'S A ALTHOUGH IT'S FOUR WIDTHS HALF MAXIMUM IT'S STILL THE USE THE LINE WITHIN IT 
SILICONE TWO IS AN ELEMENT RATHER THAN A 
NO THIS CONTEXT 
RATHER THAN A LINE 
THESE ARE THE LINES 
I GUESS WHAT YOU W 
IF WASN'T IN THERE THEN YOU'D HAVE TO SILICONE TWO LINES IT BUT WITHOUT WITH THE I THINK THAT MEANS SILICONE TWO DERIVED FROM THESE TWO FEATURES 
OKAY 
MM 
LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS 
LYMAN ALPHA FOREST YOU CAN PAINT IT IN THE SPECTRUM 
SO WE HAVEN'T BASICALLY WE JUST HAVEN'T GOT A A RULE FOR 
SPECTRAL FEATURES WITHIN OUR REFERRING TO USE TYPES OF SOURCE WHEN WE'RE NOT BOTHER MARKING THE SOURCE 
SO ARE WE MARKING H. TWO AND H. TWO REGIONS FOR EXAMPLE 
OH THAT'S TRUE 
BUT B YEAH BUT I GUESS IT'S NOT IT'S NOT DEFINED BY A SPECTRAL FEATURE THOUGH H. TWO REGION WHEREAS 
LYMAN ALPHA FOREST IS DEFINED BY THE DEFINITION OF LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS IS THAT THEY HAVE LYMAN ALPHA FORESTS 
BUT SOMEONE'S L SOMEONE'S LOOKED AT THAT SPECTRUM 
I DON'T THINK WE WERE MAKING DIFFUSE DIFFUSE EMISSION OR 
UM 
HMM 
MM 
IT'S A MODIFIER OF OF CLOUDS BUT I DON'T TH DON'T THINK IF WE'RE INCLUDING THE 
I THINK IF WE'RE NOT INCLUDING NEBULA AND CLOUDS WE CAN'T INCLUDE 
PERHAPS WE SHOULD'VE DONE 
BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE FOR THE WHOLE THING 
SO I THINK MAYBE WE JUST NEED TO PUT UNDER DON'T INCLUDE DIFFUSE EMISSION 
BUT THEN WE STILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF WE DON'T LABEL THE SOURCE WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE SPECTRAL FEATURES THAT DEFINE THAT SOURCE 
I IF WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE BROAD ABSORPTION LINE OBJECT WE MARK THAT 
WE MARK BROAD ABSORPTION LINE IN THAT 
IT'S NO BUT JUST TO KNOW THIS IS A LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUD WE'RE SEEN LYMAN ALPHA FOREST 
BUT IT'S STILL A SPECTRAL FEATURE EVEN IF IT'S NOT IT MIGHT BE A SPECTRAL FEATURE I NOT IN THE COULD 
BUT IT A SPECTRAL FEATURE IN THE QUASAR THE LYMAN ALPHA FOREST 
OKAY 
EVEN IF NOT MARKED 
NO NO ALSO CAN READ THAT SORRY 
OKAY SO THE LYMAN ALPHA FOREST AGAIN 
AND THAT DEFINITELY IS A SPECTRAL FEATURE IN ITS OWN THEN 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T EVEN SAY LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS 
EACH HELIUM TWO OPTICAL DEPTH I THINK THAT'S ELEMENTAL SPECIES 
OH 
UH WE MARKED THE SAME LINES 
WHAT HAVE WE DONE DIFFERENTLY 
'CAUSE THE PROPERTY OF THE LINE 
THEY'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF THIS 
AND WE WEREN'T USING LINE 
WHAT WAS THE ONE WE DIDN'T DO BEFORE 
LINE RATIO WE WEREN'T DOING 
WAS TALKING ABOUT L LINES OKAY 
LINE FEATURE AND THAT 
THERE'S ONLY ONE DIFFERENCE HERE 
NO NO THEY ARE THE SAME OTHERWISE 
QUITE IMPRESSIVELY 
THAT ONE'S THE SAME 
AND DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA DATA 
I CAN'T EVEN BUT IF YOU SAID 
IF YOU SAID THE SPECTRAL DAT 
THE CONTINUUM'S SPET MM 
BUT IF IT'S A DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SPECTRUM YOU'D MARK DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA BECAUSE IN THE SPECTRUM 
AND AND A DO IS EQUIVALENT OF SPECTRUM 
THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS TALKING ABOUT IS BUT IF IT'S SAYING SILICONE TWO LINE 
LEVELS THE NEW WORD 
I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT ON THE CASE OF IT BEING DATA 
MM 
WELL 
IF IT'S AN EMISSION LINE DATA 
MM 
IF IT'S AN EMISSION LINE DATA WOULD WE PUT IT IN 
BUT IF IT JUST SAID UM BUT IF IT JUST SAID EMISSION LINE WE WOULD 
AT THE EMISSION LINE IS STRANGE 
THE EMISSION LINE DATA SHOWS STRONG 
THEN UH I THINK IT'S THE SAME ACTUALLY I TH I THINK IT'S DATA ISN'T EVEN NEEDED 
IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA IT MORE THAN THE NINETY NINE PERCENT 
OR THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA FEATURE IF YOU PUT AFTER THREE RATHER THAN DATA THEN YOU'D MARK IT 
BUT I THINK DATA IS EQUIVALENT OF 
YEAH 
OKAY 
THAT'S THINK ENOUGH 
GIVEN THAT WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT IT FOR TEN MINUTES IT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT CLEAR CUT 
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SYSTEMS AND UH IT SHOULDN'T BE EITHER OF THEM 
IT SHOULD BE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA 
NO RED WHATEVER THAT IS 
SPECTRAL FEATURE 
AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE AT ALL 
AND I'VE DONE IT TWICE 
SO THAT CLEAR ENOUGH 
FLAT SPECTRUM 
WE WERE INCLUDING MODIFIERS INCLUDING BROAD LINE QUASARS NON BROAD LINE QUASARS AS WELL 
SO I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY INCLUDE THE FLAT SPECTRUM WITH YOUR Q WITH YOUR QUASAR IS A VERY DIFFERENT FROM STEEP SPECTRUM 
WE'RE TEN PERCENT OF THE WAY THERE 
CONTINUE 
OH GOSH IT WILL BE HERE FOREVER 
REMARKABLY SOFT IONISING CONTINUA 
YOU'RE RIGHT THOUGH I THINK 
OR OR CONTINUUM 
THE ABSORBED CONTINUUM 
MM-HMM YES 
OXYGEN SHOULDN'T BE THERE 
THAT'S NOT OBSERVED 
HEAVY ELEMENT ABSORPTION LINES I THINK SHOULD BE THERE 
NOW WHAT ELSE IS DIFFERENT 
MM 
OH THANK YOU 
AND THAT ONE 
YOU'RE RIGHT STAR FORMING GALAXIES ARE DISTINCT 
THAT'S YEAH DERIVED 
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU WERE DOING SEVEN THOUSAND OF THIS ONE HERE 
YOU MEAN THAT 
IF IT WAS LINES FROM H. TWO YOU'D MARK IT 
BLUE WING FLUX 
WHAT WERE WE GONNA DO ABOUT FLUX 
DOESN'T SAY 
YES IT'S THE AMOUNT OF STUFF ON THE BLUE WING 
SO I'M HAPPY WITH THAT 
LINE PEAK 
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE MARKED 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S TALKING ABOUT INCREASING LINE PEAK IT'S ALSO TALKING ABOUT INCREASING EXCESS BLUE WING 
SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EXCESS BLUE WING FLUX 
ANYWAY 
I THINK LINE PEAK IS SOMETHING YOU CAN PAINT IT 
NO BUT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T USE ALSO POINT TO INCREA INCREASING BLUE WING 
WHAT 
MM 
OKAY 
LIGHT 
Y YES 
RIGHT 
NEUTRAL HYDROGEN GUNN PETERSEN ABSORPTION 
I THINK ALL OF THAT'S A SPECTRAL 
AFTER 
IT'S BASICALLY A WAY OF SAYING THE GUNN PETERSEN T IT'S A WAY OF SAYING THE GUNN PETERSEN TROUGH THOUGH 
WHICH IF YOU JUST SAID THAT IT'S GUNN PETERSEN ABSORPTION FROM NEUTRAL HYDROGEN RATHER THAN I IF IT WAS A T IF IT WAS HYDROGEN ABSORPTION 
YOU'D MARK THE WHOLE THING 
IF IT WAS HYDROGEN ALIGN YOU WOULD SO YOU SHOULD MARK IF IT WAS OUR H. BETA ABSORPTION 
IT'S A MARKS THE KIND OF SPECTRAL FEATURE DOESN'T IT 
BUT IS IS H. BETA ABSORP UH EMISSION IS A PROCESS FROM H. BETA 
BUT IT'S STILL THIS IS A PROCESS FROM NEUTRAL HYDROGEN 
I GUESS WHAT I'M MEANING IS NEUTRAL HYDROGEN SHOULD BE IN THERE 
AND THE FACT THAT GUNN PETERSON COMES BETWEEN IT 
SO JUST A PEN 
MM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
LET'S JUST CROSS EVERYTHING OUT 
BLUE SHIFTED ABSORPTION 
I THINK IT'S A MODIFIER OF THE THING AND SO IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE THERE 
SO NO WE'RE PUTTING WEAK AND STRONG ABSORPTION WOULD COUNT AS I THINK BLUE SHIFTED SHOULD 
UM 
THAT'S TALKING ABOUT THE LINE ISN'T IT 
SO THAT SHOULD BE ONE 
YEAH 
THAT'S TALKING ABOUT UH 
STRENGTH RATHER THAN 
IT'S NOT THE UH ABUNDANCE OF IT OR ANY DERIVED PROPERTY IT'S JUST THE STRENGTH OF THE LINES 
I GUESS PERHAPS IT IS 
UM LET'S MAKE A DECISION 
I GUESS IT COULD BE ABUNDANCE 
YES THAT'S TRUE 
I THINK YOU PROBABLY SHOULD THEN 'CAUSE WE WILL PUT IN OUR ALIGN STRENGTH 
UH IF IT'S A F. I OF A TWO LINE STRENGTH WE WOULD DEFINITELY PUT IT IN 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S REFERRING TO EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT 
IT'S NOT SAYING 
TWO 
ITS LINES 
IT'S AN ABUNDANCE I IT'S AN ELEMENT I GUESS BUT IT'S 
BUT IT'S A STRENGTH RATHER THAN ABUNDANCE 
I THINK THAT'S STILL LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT OF FLUX COMING OUT OF THE OUT OF ALL THE F. E. TWO LINES RATHER THAN 
IN GENERAL WE HAVEN'T IF UNLESS IT'S SPECIFICALLY SAYING IT'S A LINE BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS JUST AS SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO A LINE 
AND I MAYBE IT'S NOT CLEAR ENOUGH TO MARK 
LET'S NOT MARK IT THEN 
WELL LINE NARROW LINE 
IF IT SAYS IT F. E. TWO LINE STRENGTH THEN WE WOULD MARK IT 'CAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LINE OF IT RATHER THAN THE EV ELEMENT 
THE WORD LINE SHOULD BE IN THERE 
OR 
YEAH I THINK THEY MEAN L 
I THINK THEY MEAN THE LINE STRENGTH RATHER THAN THE F. E. TWO ABUNDANCE 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY PROBABLY MEAN 
BUT IT'S JUST NOT VERY CLEAR 
B. S. BLOATED STAR 
THAT'S A 
YEAH 
UM TAKE OUT LINE 
AND THAT'S JUST THE WRONG 
THAT'S JUST THE WRONG COLOUR IS IS THAT 
I THINK YOU WERE RIGHT THERE 
YEP YOU'RE RIGHT 
AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AS WELL 
THAT'S A PHYSICAL PROCESS 
YES THAT WAS NO I WASN'T SURE ABOUT 'CAUSE INFRARED 
AND IF IT WAS MID INFRAR UH IF IT WAS YOU'D PUT IT IN 
THAT'S JUST THE WRONG ONE THAT'S JUST THIS SHOULD BE A SOURCE NAME 
I DON'T KNOW W 
YES 
I GUESS THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO WHAT DOES THAT UM MENU 
I PRESUMED IT 
SO IT 
OKAY RIGHT 
'CAUSE THAT'S NO I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT 
UH I THOUGHT IT WAS A CATALOGUE 
MM 
H. ALPHA I THINK SHOULD BE MARKED YEAH 
YEAH YOU'RE STILL DETECTING A LINE EVEN IF YOU'RE DETECTING IT FROM BROAD BAND FILTERS 
UM 
BROAD BAND 
BROAD LINE REGION YOU ARE RIGHT 
AND NOW ALIGN NEBULAE 
OKAY WE'LL JUST GO BACK AND CHANGE THIS 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
OKAY WHERE WAS IT 
STARTED HERE 
UM 
WHY DID IT SO WE MARK 
UM WE HAVE GOT NEBULAE MARKED HERE 
OH 
YEAH OKAY MODIFIERS WITH THEM WHICH IS GIVE A YELL IF YOU USE ONE 
SO DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBERS SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE 
BUT THEN I'M I I P I PROBABLY IS THAT RULE SO HALF THE TIME AND JUST FORGOTTEN TO USE IT THREE TIMES 
MM 
YEAH 
YES I I'M SURE I'VE FOLLOWED THAT RULE SOMETIMES AND JUST FORGOTTEN 
SO LET'S TAKE THAT IT 
UM 
LYMAN ALPHA FOREST HERE 
BUT LYMAN ALPHA FOREST SHOULD BE IN HERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TALKING ABOUT UH UM IT'S NOT MODIFIED 
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA DATA 
DATA I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP IN 
BECAUSE IT'S WOULD BE THE SAME AS FEATURE 
OR SPEC SPECTRUM 
I THINK DATA'S THE SAME AS SPECTRUM 'CAUSE THE DATA IS A SPACE UM 
FINAL VIEW BOB 
OKAY 
MM LET'S TAKE THAT IT 
AND THIS ONE COMES OUT AS WELL 
OKAY SO WE WANT NOTHING 
THERE 
DIDN'T IT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
WE'RE THERE 
RIGHT 
H. ALPHA DETECTION 
BUT I WOULDN'T IS H. ALPHA BROAD BRAND 
IT'S A LINE 
WHETHER YOU DETECT IT 
H. ALPHA EMITTERS ARE NOT 
A DISTINCT CLASS OF SOURCE I DON'T THINK 
LINE 
MM-HMM 
BUT I GUESS IF YOU'RE PICKING OUT A SPECTRAL FEATURE EVEN WITH A BROAD BAND OR NARROW BAND THEN IT'S STILL A SPECTRAL FEAT FEATURE 
IF YOU'RE PICKING OUT A LINE 
WHAT HOWEVER YOU PICK IT IT 
LINE IN ITS OWN 
I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF THIS WHICH MAKES LIFE SIMPLER 
YEP 
ABSORPTION PROFILES 
I THINK THAT I THINK THE WHOLE THING SHOULD ACTUALLY BE MARKED 
EVEN THIS COMPLEX 
HOW FAR SHOULD WE GO 
COMPLE JUST ABSORPTION PER 
UM 
LYMAN ALPHA FOREST LINE BLANKETING OR LYMAN ALPHA FOREST LINE 
SO IT A SYSTEM 
V. L. B. A. IS AN INSTRUMENT 
UH IS IT 
IS A NETWORK 
BUT IS IT 
YES 
V. 
V. L. BE VERY LONG BASELINE ARRAY 
V. L. B. A. 
IF IT HAD AN A. ON THE AND IT WOULD BE THE AN INSTRUMENT 
YES 'CAUSE IT IT IT TAKES AN IMAGE 
SO UH BUT THEN A UM RESEARCH GROUP COULD TAKE AN IMAGE 
OKAY LET'S UH HOW MUCH OF MODIFIERS ARE WE PUTTING IN 
FROM ONE POINT SIX OR FROM EUROPEAN 
OR JUST UM V. L. B. A. 
HE'S USING CAPITALS 
BUT SO 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
THAT'S JUST BROAD BAND ISN'T IT 
BROAD LINE EMISSION 
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE MARKED 
RADIO LOUD OBJECTS 
IT'S NOT VE IT'S NOT A M MOD IT'S NOT AN ORIGINAL SYSTEM 
ANYTHING ENDING AN OBJECT WE DON'T INCLUDE YEP 
SO NONE OF THIS 
YEP 
NOW WE'VE BOTH MARKED LINE RATIOS HERE 
AND THAT'S THE SAME 
CONTINUUM 
AND THERE IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE IONIZING CONTINUUM WHICH IS A PEAR 
YEAH 
I THINK YOU CAN POINT OUT LINE PAIRS 
AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE 
YEP 
SCRIBBLE AWAY 
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
THAT'S ALL ONE BIG SPECTRAL FEATURE 
AND NEBULA SHOULDN'T BE MARKED 
WHAT DO WE DO BACK HERE 
WHAT DID WE DO BACK HERE 
WE DID MARK NEBULA YES 
IT WAS THINGS THAT WEREN'T DISTINCT LIKE YEAH 
MM-HMM YEAH IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE 
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA STICK TO T LET'S STICK TO IT 
THE 
THE 
AND I THINK WE NEED THE 
I THINK WE WOULD PUT STOP PUTTING THE ONE WE COULD GET CONFUSED 
AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
OH YEAH 
LINE BLANKETING YOU THINK YOU 
WE HAD LINE BLANKETING JUST NOW AND WE INCLUDED IT 
I THINK WE SH UM 
WHERE WAS IT 
DON'T THINK N LYMAN F FOREST LINE BLANKET WE TOOK BLANKETING OUT 
AND THAT'S ALL THE SAME 
YES 
YES IT IS 
RED AND BLUE COMPONENTS 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AS WELL 
YEAH I THINK I IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU CAN PAINT IT 
THE SOFT X. RAYS OR OR THE HARD X. RAYS YOU CAN POINT AT THE RED AND THE 
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE C THE CONTINUUM THOUGH 
IF YOU HAVE A GALAXY SPECTRUM THOUGH YOU CAN SAY THERE'S THE BLUE COMPONENT THERE'S THE RED COMPONENT AT THE SPECTRUM 
UH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN I LIKE IT COMES FROM ADDING TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER 
I CAN SEE THAT YEAH 
YES 
BUT IF IT SAID RED OR BLUE EXCESS RATHER THAN RED OR BLUE COMPONENT I GUESS THE PROBLEM WITH 
MM-HMM OKAY 
LET'S 
IF YOU MODELLED IT WITH TWO PARTS IN THAT HAD A A UH A HARDER AND SOFTER SPECTRUM HUBBLE IN HUBBLE DEEP FIELD SOUTH 
I DIDN'T INCLUDE IT 
ALTHOUGH IT DOES APPLY TO THE TELESCOPE 
BUT MM 
LET'S KEEP IT IN 
ANYONE REMEMBER WHEN 
LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING 
OH 
EXCELLENT 
UM 
HUBBLE 
NO WAIT THE TOP ONE I THINK YOU SHOULD INCLUDE 
POSSIBLY WITH FLUX AS WELL THOUGH 
AND THEN YES THE WHOLE THING 
WELL I SAID RADIO GALAXIES 
NOW WHAT DID WE P WE SAY ABOUT ACRONYMS WHERE PART OF IT WAS USEFUL 
UM 
UM 
BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD MARK HIGH RED SHIFT IN THAT 
THEY ARE JUST RED SHI BUT YES 
WHA WHAT DID WE SAY ABOUT ACRONYMS WHERE 
YES I THINK YOU ARE 
SEYFERT ONE POINT EIGHT AND ONE POINT NINE GALAXIES 
YOU WOULDN'T SAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YES 
I THINK THEY PROBABLY OR 
INSEPARATE 
AND IT'S JUST THE AND THAT ANNOYS 
EMISSION LINE FEATURE WE'RE GONNA INCLUDE 
GALAXY WHEN IT'S A PROCESS 
YES 
UH NOW THIS IS NO 
WHERE IT SHOULD BE THIS ONE BUT WHAT IF YOU'D ONE OF THESE ARE DOUBLY UNDERLINED 
HAS TO JUST PLOTTED THE TOP COLOUR 
YES 
OKAY BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT HERE LET'S JUST MARK WHAT WE WANT AND MARK THAT BUT WITH ALSO BROAD LINE 
I CAN'T WRITE 
WE CHANGED IT IS THAT YOU COULD 
YEAH BECAUSE QUITE OFTEN UH AN OBJECT CLASS IS DEFINED BY A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
LIKE BROAD LINE RADIO GALAXIES 
BROADER LINES I THINK 
LOST THE WRONG WRONG COLOUR FOR A FEW THINGS 
UH IT'S ALL HERE 
HYPER LUMINOUS GALAXY 
MM-HMM 
THIS IS JUST A COLOUR ISSUE 
YEAH THEY SHOULD ALL BE AND THAT ONE 
U. S. M. 
IT'S DIFFUSE 
SO IT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE 
OH 
NO 
WHAT WE DOING ABOUT NEBULA AGAIN 
I'VE FORGOTTEN 
OKAY 
YEAH 
FEATURES 
FLAT SPECTRUM RADIO QUASARS 
STRONG DROP ON THE CONTINUUM 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT AGAIN 
THAT'S JUST THE PLACE 
UM WE'RE NOT DOING EMISSION LINE WHEN IT'S A MODIFIER OF OBJECTS ARE WE 
THE QUESTION IS OUR MISSION LINE OBJECTS A SEPARATE CLASS OF SOURCE 
I THINK THEY ARE 
YES YOU'RE RIGHT 
AND SEYFERT GALAXIES WE SHOULD BE IN YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
I GOT THREE SEVENTY 
RIGHT 
WE DID YEAH 
YEAH WE DID TWO OF THOSE DIDN'T WE 
I THINK WE DID TWO TRAINING SETS AND THEN WE HAD AT LEAST ONE MEETING WITH YOU WHERE WE TALKED TO ALL THROUGH 
YES 
YEAH 
I'D SAY NO 
BUT I D I MEAN I THOUGHT WE HAD BASICALLY THE SAME IDEAS TO BE I DON'T REMEMBER EVER HAVING STRONG ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE ON WHAT GROUP OR IT WAS JUST THE RULES ABOUT THINGS THAT IS YEAH 
AND WHAT COUNTED AS WHO IS FOR THE SPECTRAL FEATURES IT WAS MORE CONFUSING WHAT COUNTED AS A SPECTRAL FEATURE AND WE HAD A LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT 
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER SORT OF ARGUING FROM DIFFERENT SIDES AND CONVERGING JUST SORT OF PIECING OUT WHAT WOULD COME UP AND AGREEING WHAT WE'D DO 
IT PROBABLY WOULD BE BUT I DON'T I IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME YEAH SINCE WE'VE DONE THIS 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE HANDY 
SIGN OFF 
WE DID SEND IT AT HOME YEAH 
YEAH 
THERE'S A COOL LITTLE COUNT DOWN CLOCK THAT LETS YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN MEETING AS WELL 
NO WE DON'T AT ALL 
YEAH 
BUT THEY'RE HARDLY IN OUR AREAS 
OH 
YEAH I DID AS WELL 
NO 
IT'S A VERY STRANGE INTERVIEW FEELING AS WELL BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE THEM WHILE YOU'RE GIVING YOUR TALK 
BECAUSE THEY JUST SHOW USUALLY THEY HAVE A CAMERA ON YOU NEED A CAMERA ON THEM 
BUT DURING THE TALK PART THEY HAVE A CAMERA ON I BELIEVE THEM 'CAUSE I COULD USE THAT GUY READING A NEWSPAPER HALFWAY THROUGH MY TALK 
AND THEN THEY HAD A CAMERA ON SHOWING WHAT MY SLIDES WERE AND SO YOU FORGET THAT THEY CAN SEE YOU AT ALL 
AND SO WHEN ALL THAT WAS OVER THEY WERE ANSWERING ME QUESTIONS AND THE VIEW SWITCHED AGAIN I REALISED THEY WERE SITTING THERE IN THE INTERVIEW GOING 
SO 
YEAH 
AND YOU CAN'T SAY LOOKING OVER HERE 
LIKE O 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT IS REALLY STRONG 
MM 
EXCELLENT 
RIGHT 
SHALL WE SHALL WE DIVE IN IN THE INTERIM 
OR 
MM 
NO YOU WOULDN'T DO 
I THINK I'M DO I THINK I'M WORKING OUT WHO'S TOP AND BOTTOM 
UM 
YEAH I'M HAPPY ENOUGH WITH THAT 
I DON'T FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IT 
OH 
BEN SAID UH UH LEFT TO IT ON PURPOSE WHICH IS REASON 
YEAH 
I'M PRETTY SURE I'M TOP 
OH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY RIGHT AS WELL 
OKAY NEXT 
OKAY 
SO HERE WE'RE MISSING SOFT COMPONENT ON THE BOTTOM 
THERE 
IF YOU GOT LINE I GET SOFT COMPONENT 
YEAH 
YOU CAN POINT TO A SOFT COMPONENT 
YEAH 
IT'S A BIG BUMP IN THE SOFT BUT 
IT C UH YEAH I'M NOT FUSSED ABOUT THAT 
THEY BOTH MEAN THE SAME THING 
YEAH 
THIS IS THE THIS IS THE THING YOU POINT TO YEP 
YEAH THAT'S THE THING YOU PAINT IT AND THIS IS A PH A PHYSICAL MECHANISM 
SO YEAH I'D SAY 
TWO DOWN 
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN TO GO 
EXCELLENT 
MM THAT'S DEFINITELY TWO 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
I THINK THAT'S TRUE 
ALRIGHTY 
WHAT ARE WE MISSING 
BROAD LINE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YOU GET THAT 
OH 
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE DOING WITH NEBULAE 
WE WEREN'T DOING LIKE H. TWO REGIONS AND STUFF WERE WE 
I CAN'T REMEMBER ACTUALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES 
MM WE WERE DOING DESCRIPTIONS THAT MADE THINGS SEPARATE CLASSES IN WHICH CASE I'D ARGUE FOR ELLIPTICAL I THINK 
MY GOD I'VE JUST GONE MAD WITH THE UNDERLINING HERE 
YEAH I 
YEAH THAT'S THE THING BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT WAS A P YEAH 
THE PARALLEL INDEX IS SOMETHING YOU DESI DERIVE 
A BREAK IN A SPECTRUM IS SOMETHING YOU CAN PAINT IT 
SO 
YEAH B THAT THING THERE 
AND IF I DID IT AGAIN I'D SAY A SLIGHT DEPRESSION OF THE CONTINUUM AND POSSIBLY WELL 
'CAUSE YOU CAN USE BOTH THE SLIGHT DEPRESSION AND THE LYMAN LIMIT 
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY THE DESCRIPTIVE WORDS OF THE FEATURES 
SO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT THEY WOULD BE THE SAME THEY'D BOTH BE THE SAME SPECTRAL FEATURE WHEREAS HERE THEY'RE TWO SPECTRAL FEATURES 
THERE'S A LYMAN LIMIT WHICH YOU COULD USE AND THEN THERE'S A SLIGHT DEPRESSION NEAR IT 
BUT 
YEAH 
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE BUT THAT 
YEAH 
EXCELLENT 
YEAH OKAY 
UH-HUH 
THAT I DIDN'T MARK BECAUSE IT'S THE PHYSICAL PROCESS OF ABSORPTION 
NOT THE THE THING 
YEAH IF IT WAS THERE'S NO ABSORPTION FEATURE OR ABSORPTION TO USE IT THE SPECTRUM AT THIS WAVE LENGTH 
BUT WHEN YOU SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE THE QUASAR IS ABSORBED THAT JUST MEANS THE QUASAR IS BEHIND A A BUNCH OF STUFF 
SO THAT'S DESCRIBING SOMETHING PHYSICALLY RATHER THAN DESCRIBING THE SPECTRUM ITSELF 
SO 
THANK YOU 
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO ABOUT THINGS THAT WEREN'T THERE 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN PAINT IT 
YOU COULD POINT IT OUT OF IT WERE THERE 
MARKED IT YEAH 
YEAH 
HUH 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT WERE WE SAYING ABOUT NEBULA 
SOURCE TYPES 
NO NEBULA COUNTS DOESN'T IT 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THAT'S LINE RATIOS 
BUT 
UH LINE IN ONE LINE IN LINE RATIOS IS MODIFYING RATIOS 
IT ISN'T IT 
IT'S IT'S NOT TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC LINES 
A LINE RATIO IS A THING 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN YOU WOULDN'T YOU WOULDN'T INCLUDE ABUNDANCES OR LINE STRENGTHS 
YEAH IT SHOULDN'T BE ONE 
I DON'T THINK 
WHOOP NO 
UH I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE CIRCLING THE ONE WE LIKE RIGHT 
OH SORRY UM YEP 
OH RIGHT DAMPED LYMAN SEE AGAIN THAT'S UH THESE ARE SOURCE TYPES THE UM I MEAN IT'S NOT A SOURCE TYPE 
BUT DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBERS ARE THE ARE PHYSICAL THINGS NOT SPECTRAL FEATURES 
YOU 
BUT UH YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO POINT SOMETHING IN A SPECTRUM AND SAY THAT'S A DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBER UNLESS YOU'D 
YEAH YOU COULD DO 
BUT WE WOULDN'T SAY ABSORBERS WERE A TYPE OF SOURCE 
OKAY 
I'M NOT CERTAIN ABOUT THAT BUT I 
HMM 
BUT 
DO DON'T WITH DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA OBSERVERS YOU THEM A VARIETY OF PLACES ALONG THE LINE OF SIGHT 
SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW 
IF YOU LOOK AT A QUASAR AND YOU USE A BUNCH UH IF YOU GOT A BUNCH OF CLOUDS OF GOES ON THE WAY 
YOU CAN USE THESE THINGS AND BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO POINT TO ONE OF THEM AND SAY UH THAT'S A DAMP YEAH 
THEY'RE GONNA BE AT DIFFERENT RED SHIFTS 
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO THE THAT 
BUT 
YEAH 
YOU 
WELL NO BUT YOU USE THEM IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT RED RED SHIFTS 
IT'S LIKE THE THE LYMAN ALPHA FOREST SORT OF 
AND I'M NOT CERTAIN I WOULD 
I WOULD MARK THAT 
IT'S A TRICKY ONE 
UM NO I WOULDN'T BECAUSE IT'S THEY'RE PHYSICAL THINGS NOT SPECTRAL FEATURES 
YOU CAN'T POINT TO SOMETHING IN A SPECTRUM AND SAY THAT'S DEFINITELY A D DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SOME I GO AND I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE MODIFIERS OF THIS SOURCE TYPE 
AND WE WOULDN'T MARK THAT SOURCE TYPE 
WE WOULDN'T MARK ABSORBERS NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM IT'S TRICKY ONE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
BUT WE WEREN'T GOING TO INCLUDE S DESCRIPTIONS OF SPECTRAL FEATURES THAT WERE BASED ON FITTING WERE WE 
HAVE WE 
STEEP SOFT COMPONENT 
YEAH BREAKING THE POWER LAW IS SOMETHING I'M NOT CERTAIN OF 
STEEP SOFT COMPONENT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN PAINT IT IN A SPECTRUM AND SAY THREE TO USE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S TRICKY 
YEAH 
THAT'S GRAND 
YEAH 
YES 
UM AGAIN I'D SAY THIS THIS IS A PHYSICAL PROCESS NOT A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
OH 
YEAH 
UH I DON'T HAVE K. STAR BUT I SHOULD DO 
WAIT WHERE 
OKAY 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH BROAD H. ALPHA 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
OH NO WE'RE BACK TO IT AGAIN 
THAT'S TRUE BUT LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS ARE SOURCE TYPES WE AREN'T MARCHING MARKING 
WHICH WE DON'T MARK YEAH 
BUT WE CAN JUST BE CONSISTENT 
AND I DON'T THINK WE ARE 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT A SPECTRAL FEATURE IN THE SPECTRUM WE'RE LOOKING AT 
YEAH 
BUT SAYING THAT ISN'T THE SAME AS SAYING WE'VE SEEN THAT IN A SPECTRUM 
WHEREAS A BROAD LINE QUASAR SOMEONE HAS LOOKED AT IT AND THEY'VE SEEN A BROAD LINE 
BUT IF YOU'RE DISCUSSING LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS THEY COULD JUST BE DISCUSSING THE PHYSICAL OBJECT WHICH WE AREN'T MARKING 
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T I DON'T KNOW 
ANYTHING BLOBBY I D I DIDN'T MARK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I W I REMEMBERED NOT MARKING NEBULA OR CLOUDS OR 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER WE'RE DOING IT 
YEAH BUT BOB'S SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD BE UH INCLUDING NEBULA AND CLOUDS 
BUT WE HAVEN'T FOR THE WHOLE THING 
YEAH 
BUT THAT'S 'CAUSE WE'VE TO KNOW IT'S A RATHER BROAD ABSORP ABSORPTION LINE OBJECT WE HAVE SEEN IT 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LET'S KEEP THEM 
NOPE 
AND HERE 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
THERE THAT'S DERIVED YOU'RE RIGHT 
OH RUBBISH 
EXCELLENT 
OH YOU'VE GOT LINE BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES 
YEAH 
YEAH WE ARE 
YEAH I DON'T THINK LINE BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES COUNTS 
'CAUSE IT'S NOT TALKING ABOUT A SPECIFIC LINE 
SO YEAH 
I DON'T THINK THAT COUNTS 
AFTER 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
OH NO 
YEAH THEY'RE ALL THE SAME 
YES EXCELLENT 
UM DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA AGAIN 
SYSTEMS 
THAT'S A MODIFIER OF DATA 
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S A DESCRIPTION OF THE TYPE OF DATA 
A D 
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT COUNTS 
I WOULDN'T BUT YOU WOULD 
I THINK JUST BECAUSE IT'S GOT A SPECTRAL FEATURE IN THE PHRASE 
YOU WOULDN'T FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE WERE SAYING SILICONE TWO LEVELS WE DIDN'T MARK SILICONE TWO 
THAT'S THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SPECTRUM 
BUT WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS SO WE'VE MADE SOME MEASUREMENTS BASED ON DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA MEASUREMENTS AND THEY TELL US THIS ANSWER 
AND THIS ANSWER IS INCONSISTENT WITH THAT ANSWER 
YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT 
HMM 
UM 
I WOULDN'T BUT BECAUSE IT'S A MODIFIER OF DATA 
OH FEATURE ABSOLUTELY 
BU BUT 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
TAKE IT AGAIN BUT SYSTEMS SHOULD BE TOO 
YEAH 
MM 'KAY 
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN 
YES 
RIGHT 
SOURCE TYPE 
DID WE HAVE A RULE ABOUT THIS 
MM-HMM 
YEP THAT'S TRUE 
THAT IS TRUE 
ARE WE 
EXCELLENT 
JUST HITTING THE HALF AN HOUR MARK 
SO THAT I THAT'S TALKING ABOUT THE THE FLUX OF KIN OF IONISING PHOTONS RATHER THAN THE CONTINUUM OF THAT SPECTRUM 
SO I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE 
OXYGEN ABUNDANCE 
YEAH 
MM 
I'M HAPPY ENOUGH WITH THAT 
BLUE SHIFTED 
THAT'S OKAY WITH UM I DON'T CARE 
YEAH YOU CAN HAVE THAT AS WELL 
THERE YOU GO 
NEXT 
OH 
I THINK THEY ARE 
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THAT 
I DON'T LIKE THAT AT ALL 
YEAH COULD BE THAT I WAS A BIT SLEEPY 
LINES FROM IONS 
YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LINE FROM ONE ONE AND A LINE LINE FROM SOMETHING ELSE 
WELL YOU'D KNOW WHERE THEY ARE IN THE 
WELL I GUESS YEAH I DUNNO 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
THAT'S TRUE 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH BUT THE FEATURE ITSELF IS BLUE WING FLUX OR IF IT WAS SAID BLUE WING FEATURE WE'D MARK FEATURE 
HMM 
YEAH 
POSSIBLY 
DON'T KNOW 
UH UH 
YOU CAN PAINT IT IT BUT CAN YOU POINT TO A LINE PEAK VELOCITY SHIFT 
WELL YOU CAN POINT TO BLUE WING FLUX 'CAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR LINE AND THERE'S THE BLUE WING FLUX 
BUT IF THE LINE PEAK IS INCREASINGLY SHIFTED YOU'D 
MM THERE'S A SYSTEM ISSUE AGAIN SO WE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT AND KEEP IT 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
I THINK I MIGHT AGREE WITH YOU 
'CAUSE THIS DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T BE MARKED 
BECAUSE THAT IS A PROCESS NOT A 
AND IF THAT SHOULDN'T BE MARKED THEN THAT SHOULDN'T BE MARKED 
RIGHT 
OH OKAY 
MM 
YEAH 
HMM YES 
OKAY 
YEAH I'M NOT SURE THERE 
BUT UM 
B UH YEAH THERE THAT IF THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN NEITHER SHOULD EITHER OF THIS 
MM YEAH 
A FEATURE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
SO IT 
OH 
WE'VE MARKED THING HAVE WE MARKED THINGS LIKE 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE MARKED THINGS LIKE SILICONE ONE 
THROUGHOUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IF WE DON'T MARK IT THOUGH WE DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T MARK THESE TWO SHOULD WE 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
IF THAT'S TRUE THAN THEIR LEAVING OUT THE WORD LINE I DON'T SHOULD MEAN THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE MARKED 
BUT 
BUT I MEAN WE KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN 
LIKE 
YEAH LET'S LEAVE IT IN 
NEXT 
OH 
UH SO THAT WHAT THAT MEANS 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
SEYFERT TWO 
UH YEP 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
RADIO LOUD COUNTS YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
THAT COUNTS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THE AND THOSE SHOULDN'T BE SHOULD IT 
UM UM DOES THIS COUNT AS MODIFIERS ACTIVE WE DEFINITELY INCLUDE ACTIVE 
SO 
IT'S A K KIND OF ELLIPTICAL IS IT 
A E. TWO IS A KIND OF ELLIPTICAL 
WHAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE J. MEANS 
THIS CAN DOES THAT NOT MINE A A BROAD BAND DETECTION 
AND DOES THAT COUNT 
UH H. ALPHA DETECTION 
BUT DON'T WE SAY WE DON'T DO THAT 
OH 
I'M RIGHT LIKE 
DON'T INCLUDE MODIFIERS OF REGIONS OR SYSTEMS E. G. 
REGION SYSTEMS 
THAT'S WHY I WASN'T DOING IT 
G UH LOOK AT THAT 
YEAH BUT B UH MODIFIERS OF REGIONS OR SYSTEMS IS THE 
YEAH WE COULD ALWAYS CHANGE THIS IF WE THINK WE'RE RIGHT RATHER THAN GOING BACK THROUGH AND 
BASED ON THIS BUT WE COULD CHANGE THIS RULE RATHER THAN CHANGING ALL THESE THINGS 
WHAT'S THE WHAT WAS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO IT THIS POINT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEP 
'CAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWED THAT REAL 
RIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S FINE 
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SYSTEMS 
UH WE'RE BACK TO DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA DATA 
OKAY 
I 
I D I STILL DON'T THINK THAT GOES ON 
BUT 
YEAH 
I STILL DON'T LIKE IT 
BUT 
I DON'T HAVE PASSIONATE FEELINGS 
YEP 
YEAH JUST CROSS THOSE OUT 
OOPS 
EXCELLENT 
SO WHAT WERE WE LOOKING AT THIS PAGE FOR ANYWAY 
IT WAS FOR SOMETHING ELSE H. ALPHA DETECTION 
OH 
BROAD BAND DETECTIONS IS NO DON'T INCLUDE 
UH IS IT WOULD BE A NARROW BAND DETECTION A NARROW BAND IMAGING DETECTION 
ALRIGHT GOOD 
NO THEY AREN'T 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY YEAH 
RIGHT 
UH THIS IS ANOTHER SYSTEMS THING 
OKAY 
YEAH 
NO 
UM 
YEAH ABSORPTION PROFILES I'LL GO FOR 
WHY NOT 
YEAH TAKE OUT THE BLANKETING 
HAS THIS 
OH RIGHT 
YEP 
YEAH V. L. B. A. IS UH A NOT UH IT'S IT'S A V. L. B. A. IS IT'S A TECHNIQUE 
IT'S NOT A YEAH 
WHAT'S IT'S CALLED SOMETHING ELSE ISN'T IT 
THE V. I. 
YEAH IT'S CALLED A V. L. B. A. 
THIS IS 
V. L. B. I. NETWORK IMAGE 
SO DO THEY MEAN THE V. L. B. A. 
EUROPEAN V. L. B. I. NET 
SO IT ON IT IT'S AN INTSTRU GROUP INSTRUMENT NOT A RESEARCH GROUP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE PROPER NAMES 
BUT I DON'T 
YEAH SO THAT IS THIS WHOLE THING IS AN INSTRUMENT YOU SAY 
OH 
UH I SEE I SEE 
YEAH 
SO SO THIS LIKE IT'S A SUBSET OF THE V. L. B. A. 
RIGHT 
COOL 
RIGHT 
OH 
THAT IS A SOURCE NAME YOU'RE RIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S JUST 
MM-HMM 
WE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT OBJECTS AND I THINK IT'S THAT WE DON'T USE IT 
YEAH BUT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE 
SO THAT'S IT YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH 
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A SOURCE NAME 
YEAH THAT MEANS THAT'S A PROC IT'S A PROCESS OR IT'S A IT'S A TYPE OF PHOTONS THAT'S NOT THE CONTINUUM YOU'RE LOOKING AT 
SURE YOU CAN YEP 
MM NOPE 
NEITHER SHOULD THAT 
EXCELLENT 
HAVE WE AGREED ON THAT 
WE ONLY AGREED THAT AS FAR WE'VE ONLY AGREED THAT WE CAN'T INCLUDE SPECTRAL FEATURES MODIFYING NEBULA 
BUT I DON'T SEE YET WHERE IT'S WRITTEN DOWN THAT YOU CAN'T MARK NEBULA 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THE SO THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF NEBULA 
I THINK SO WHY I WASN'T DOING IT 
YEAH 
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM LET'S HAVE THEM 
WHAT'S DIFFERENT 
OH YEAH 
UM DON'T MIND 
MM-HMM 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
THERE 
SOURCE TYPE 
LINE BLANKETING 
SH I NO I DON'T THINK I DID I 
SO THAT YEAH 
DID WE 
OH 
UM 
WE DID JUST HAVE TO DON'T KNOW 
IT WASN'T THAT FAR BACK WAS IT 
NO IT WASN'T THAT FAR BACK 
LINE YEAH WE TOOK BLANKETING OUT SO I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD BE ONE 
SO THAT IT 
YEAH 
OH THAT'S A SOURCE NINE 
ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK I'M RIGHT 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM THE SOFT EXCESS YOU CAN DEFINITELY POINT IT IN AN X. RAY THING 
YOU KN YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ONE THERE ARE NOT YOU COULD SAY THAT'S THAT 
SO 
YOU'RE SAYING YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT WAS SOFT UNLESS YOU'D 
WE UH YEAH 
I SEE WHAT 
MM 
BUT RESULTS FROM SPECTRAL 
GIVE THAT FOR RED AND BLUE COMPONENTS BUT I WOULDN'T PROBABLY GIVE THAT FOR SOFT COMPONENT 
BECAUSE A SOFT EXCESS IS A UH I MEAN THAT'S AN X. RAY THING 
LIKE A BREAK YOU SAY UH LIKE THERE'S 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH I'D TAKE OUT RED AND BLUE 
WHICH MEANS MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE OUT SOFT 
BUT IT'S SUCH A BASIC SORT OF YOU LOOK AT A SPECTRUM AND YOU SAY THAT'S A A SOFT EXCESS IT'S A SOFT 
YEAH 
IT'S JUST A IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE YEAH 
UM HUBBLE AND HUBBLE DEEP SENT TO USE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO SHOULD WE DID WE HAVE A SOFT COMPONENT EARLIER 
SO WE SH SHOULD KILL IT 
NO 
YEAH 
THERE TO USE 
RIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
MM D YEAH OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S FINE I'M HAPPY WITH ALL THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT COUNTS 
DO WE UH DID WE USE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT RADIO GALAXIES 
'CAUSE I THINK 
THEY ARE DISCUSSED AS A SEPARATE SOURCE TYPE AREN'T THEY 
RADIO GALAXIES 
IT HIDES THAT YEAH 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHERE PART OF IT'S USEFUL 
I THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MARK THE WHOLE THING AREN'T YOU 
YEAH SO YOU'RE RIGHT 
UM 
IT'S A SUB CLASSIFICATION OF SEYFERT'S 
WOULD MAKE A S STUDY SEYFERT ONE POINT EIGHTS 
UH DO THEY 
YOU'RE RIGHT YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S FINE 
UH YEP 
YEAH GALAXY AND GALAXY FORMATION DOESN'T COUNT 
AND YES THAT COUNTS 
BUT NO 
YEAH 
RIGHT BUT I'M IN THE 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD GO ON 
DON'T MIND 
UH UP HERE 
YEAH 
MM 
SO IT 
OR IS IT UH RIGHT 
AND Q. S. A. IS NOT YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
YEP 
THE U. S. M. ISN'T A SOURCE TYPE 
SO IT 
WE'RE NOW INCLUDING NEBULA AREN'T WE 
MM WHAT HAVE WE DONE FEATURES 
MM YEP 
OKAY 
NOPE 
YEP 
WE AREN'T DOING EMISSION LINE OBJECTS 
OH NO WE AREN'T DOING THAT THERE YOU'RE RIGHT 
MM NO 
THEY AREN'T ARE THEY 
YEAH 
YEAH ANYTHING TO DO WITH OBJECTS 
SO NOTHING 
YEAH 
YES 
RIGHT 
'KAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
UH HAS HAD IT CERTAINLY 
YEAH 
YEAH HE'S BEEN EMAILED IT WHILE AGO 
NOW HE'S GONE 
OH REALLY 
EXCELLENT 
WE SHOULD HAVE THESE THINGS IN OUR OUR 
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE HIGH TECH THINGS 
WELL I GUESS THERE'S TELESCOPES BUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT THOUGH ISN'T IT 
THAT'S NOT IN 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT ALTHOUGH YOU UH IT ISN'T ACTUALLY USED ALL THAT OFTEN THESE DAYS I THINK 
GOSH 
RIGHT YOU 
RIGHT 
GOSH 
AND YOU MISS ALL THE THE BODY LANGUAGE AND THINGS 
YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
GOSH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S VERY ARTIFICIAL THOUGH ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
NOT VERY SENSIBLE 
YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH 
THAT MUST BE REALLY WEIRD 
SO THERE 
GOSH 
YEAH 
GOSH 
WELL MM-HMM 
GREAT 
DO YOU THINK 
SORRY I I SHOULDN'T INTERVENE PROBABLY 
BUT WELL THE UM ISN'T IT THAT IF UM IT'S A REGION OF THE SPECTRUM THAT'S U 
AND WE CAN PAINT IT IT 
AND THEN IT IS A SP A SP SPECTRAL F F 
FEATURE AND THAT ISN'T 
YOU THINK 
OKAY ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S A FEATURE 
UM BECAUSE IN THE S SP SPECTRUM IT DOES THAT AND IT DOES THAT 
SO IT YEAH 
THAT'S THAT IS WHERE IT BREAKS 
SO YEAH 
UH YOU WANT TO S SPLIT THAT ONE AND DO YOU INTO TWO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH I'D AGREE WITH THAT I THINK 
YEAH 
THANKS 
BUT IF IT HAD BEEN EITHER UM YOU WOULD'VE 
HAD TO USE A FEATURE 
YEAH BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LISTED EXPLICITLY UM THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INCLUDE IT 
L LINE RATIO IS AFTER ABUNDANCES 
SO 
UH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN 
UM 
WELL 
NO 
YEAH 
UM 
WELL I MEAN YOU COULD LOOK AT THIS THIS SPECTRUM AND SPOT THAT UM THE L LYMAN ALPHA HAS BEEN DAMPED 
THAT IS A ONE SPECTRAL FEATURE 
OH YEAH 
NO THAT'S TRUE 
DIFFERENT REDSHIFTS 
YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH BUT 
BUT YOU'RE GUESSING IN A WAY THOUGH AREN'T YOU 
SO 
MM THAT'S A THAT'S A TRICKY ONE CERTAIN CERTAINLY 
WOULDN'T YOU 
WOULDN'T YOU HAVE ALL OF IT 
RIGHT WELL TH YEAH THA THAT'S IN THE THE MANUAL 
SO 
I G I GUESS IT IS 
I 
AND THAT IT IS ALTERING THE SPECTRUM ISN'T IT 
I MEAN IS A CH 
CHANGE IN THE S SPECTRUM OF 
BACKGROUND OBJECTS 
UH SO THAT RIGHT 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH I THINK SO IT IN THAT 
UM 
THAT'S ACTUALLY AN IONIC SPECIES ISN'T IT ACTUALLY 
NOT A A SPECTRAL FEATURE AS SUCH O ON ITS OWN 
NO 
B B WHY AREN'T YOU MARKING IT THEN 
UH-HUH 
WELL THAT'S UP WHAT I'M P PONDERING REALLY 
UM 
YEAH BUT THIS IS UM SPECIES OF CLOUD IT'S A P 
A PARTICULAR SPECIES OF CLOUD NOT JUST A GENERAL CLOUD ISN'T IT 
SO ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT 
OKAY THE 
THEN I GUESS NOT THEN 
YEAH 
AND 
BUT IT'S IN THIS IS SP SP SP SP SPECTRUM OF ANOTHER OBJECT THOUGH 
IT IT ISN'T THE SPECTRUM OF THE CLOUDS 
YEAH 
THAT IS TRUE 
UH AND UH COULD POINT TO IT THAT'S TRUE AND SAY THAT IS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
I'M NOT SURE ACTUALLY 
I TH I THINK I WOULD MARK IT 
AND 
AND THAT IT 
IT IS A REGION OF THE SPECTRUM AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY USING A REGION OF THE SPECTRUM 
SO THE DATA 
UM 
BUT IF YOU BOTH WANT NOT TO MARK IT THEN FINE DON'T MARK IT 
MM 
RIGHT 
YOU HAVE TO S SPEED UP 
WE'LL GO UP COULD BE HERE ALL DAY 
WELL I YOU 
YEAH I DON'T THINK YOU CAN 
YEAH UH I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FEATURE 
REALLY 
IT'S A PROCESS ISN'T IT 
WELL 
ISN'T THAT A PROCESS 
IT'S A PROCESS ISN'T IT 
WELL IT I WOULDN'T 
HAVE ANY OF IT I THINK 
I THINK ALL OF THAT IS UM JUST THAT IS PROCESS 
ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
YOU THINK 
UM 
YOU DON'T THINK THAT IT 
ACTUALLY IS ABUNDANCE REALLY IN A WAY 
I'M NOT SURE 
BUT 
I'M NOT SURE 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
UH I 
WELL BUT IT 
ISN'T THIS AN ELEMENTAL UM ABUNDANCE 
THAT YOU ESTIMATE ACTUALLY USING A NUMBER OF LINES 
SO IT IT ISN'T JUST ONE DISCRETE 
LINE IN THE SPECTRUM IS IT 
I'M NOT SURE 
WELL IF YOU IT 
TWO IS AN IONIC SPECIES AND IT'LL HAVE A NUMBER OF 
LINES IN THE SPECTRUM AND YOU'LL UH ESTIMATE 
IN THE ABUNDANCE ALL OF THE S SPECIES ACTUALLY IS THE OLD LINES 
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IF IT'S YEAH 
I THINK SO YEAH 
UH WELL WHAT'S NEW 
OKAY 
WELL THEN HAVE TO ONE 
YEAH YEAH OKAY 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
OH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
SORRY WHAT'S THE I CAN'T SEE 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I WOULDN'T I THINK NOW PROBABLY 
WELL H. L. WAS A LINE THERE REALLY ISN'T IT 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK SO 
YEAH EXACTLY THAT 
YEAH EXACTLY THAT 
YEP 
TECHNIQUE 
YEAH 
THE NETWORK IS AN INSTRUMENT THOUGH ISN'T IT 
IT 
IT'S A. V. N. ISN'T IT 
WELL IT 
ISN'T ALL OF 
THIS IS AN INSTRUMENT IF YOU HAVE TO ALL ISN'T IT 
I THINK SO 
YEAH 
BUT UM 
WHICH IT IS UH I THINK 
THAT'S WHAT I THINK 
UH I THINK IT'S UH UM SO IS IS STARTING WITH UM EU EUROPEAN I THINK 
OH YES 
JUST IN EUROPE 
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MERLIN AND ALL THE I AM INTERNATIONAL LOGS IN EUROPE ALL 
HOOKED UP INTO AN INSTRUMENT BASICALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
DID YOU 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PROCESS AND THAT IT IT WASN'T INCLUDED 
YEAH 
YEAH 
REALLY 
WELL I WOULD ARGUE ABOUT IS BECAUSE I THINK THAT I MEAN TH THAT YOU ONLY EXTRACT THAT AFTER YOU ACTUALLY MODEL A SP SPECTRUM DON'T YOU 
YEAH 
BUT HAVE A COMPONENT THOUGH AS SUCH 
YEAH G UM C 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING THAT 
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY UM AFTER YOU ACTUALLY MODEL THE USE A SPECTRUM NOT JUST ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE SPECTRUM 
YEAH YOU THINK 
YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT UM COMPONENT IT IS UM MEANS IT'S AN ELEMENT ACTUALLY ON THE MODEL THOUGH 
WELL UH 
THE EXCESSES YEAH 
BUT UM THE COMPONENT ISN'T 
I THINK I WOULD 
YEAH 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK ACTUALLY PRETTY EARLY ON I'D HAVE THOUGHT 
WHERE ARE THEY 
UH ONLY JUST 
I 
INTERESTING BECAUSE IN THE HERE IT YEAH 
NO 
NO IT IS YEAH 
WELL PEOPLE DO THOUGH DON'T THEY 
I MEAN IT'S PRETTY S STUPID BUT THEY DO 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH 
IF YOU'RE HAVING ULTRA LOOM THIS EARLY ON THEN I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE HERE 
I DON'T THINK SO 
BUT IT YOU ARE YOU ARGUING NOT TO HAVE ANYTHING WITH OBJECT IN IT THOUGH 
SO THERE GOES 
AND YOU S SPEED IT UP AS WELL I THINK 
SO 
HMM 
DID DID YOU GUYS ACTUALLY HAD SORT OF UM THE INTERACTION OR DISCUSSIONS WHILE YOU WE DOING THE ANNOTATION 
DID YOU HAVE HAD STAGES OF CLARIFICATION OR I SUPPOSE YOU DID RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO DID YOU FEEL THAT IT WAS SOME SOME KIND OF SOME PROCESS OF CONVERGENCE 
LIKE THAT INITIALLY HAD QUITE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THE PHRASE TYPES AND AND MARKATIONS AND THEN EVENTUALLY YOU CAME UP UH WITH SOME KIND OF REALISE THAT YOU SET UP BETWEEN UH THE TWO IF YOU 
OR 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I THINK SO 
OKAY 
I DROPPED A 
SO DID DERE DEREK AND BEN HAS THE UM THE FILE THAT THEY THIS MANUAL 
YEAH 
O OKAY 
OKAY RIGHT IT'S PRINTING IT IT AS WELL 
I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT LIKE UH MARKING OR NOT MARKING WHO'S TOP AND WHO'S BOTTOM 
I THINK MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR YOU GUYS TO KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
OKAY FAIR ENOUGH 
SO SO YOU SORRY UM JUST FOR THE CONVENTION YOU YOU YOU MARKING WHICH UH WHICH THE ANNOTATION YOU THINK SO SO THE RIGHT ONE 
OKAY FAIR ENOUGH 
MM-HMM OKAY 
WOULD EITHER BE OTHER CASES WHERE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY MARK ON AB ABSORPTION 
OR 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
CHEERS 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO THAT THE NEBULA 
WAS TO THE NEBULA THIN YEAH 
UM SO SO CAN I JUST ASK W WE NOW YOU JUST UH ALIGNED D UH SORRY YOU CIRCLE THE WORD IN THE ON THE OUTLINE WHICH DIDN'T 
RIGHT SORRY 
K UH I SEE OKAY 
MM-HMM 
CHEERS 
I SEE 
THAT WAS EASY 
THE THE 
I IT IT WOULDN'T COUNT AS A SOURCE TYPE 
OR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
UM SORRY CAN WE JUST GO BACK THE UH ONE PAGE 
DID DID YOU RESOLVE THE THE L THE DIFFERENT UM SEGMENTATIONS LIKE UH THE MAIN PROBLEM WAS 
OH SORRY I I THOUGHT IT WAS A PROBLEM OF LIKE UH ON HAVING UNDERLINED THE ENTIRE OH SORRY 
NO NO I I SEE OKAY SORRY 
YEAH I SEE 
SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION TASK 
SO I TH I THINK TH THERE THERE WAS ALSO THIS ONE GUIDELINE OF SAYING FOR EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING UH IS SITTING UNDER A NEGATION 
RIGHT THE THERE WAS ON UM DAMPED L. Y. ALPHA SOMETHING 
THEN UM WE THEN I THINK THE CONVENTION WAS THAT WE STILL THAT YOU STILL WOULD MARK THAT 
RIGHT 
SO IT'S MORE LIKE UH A SO IT'S UH UH IT'S UH SORT OF LIKE A QUITE LITERAL TASK THAT'S REALLY LIKE FINDING THESE KIND OF UH THESE TYPES OF STRINGS UH RATHER THAN REALLY REFERRING TO THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL REALITY 
WHICH I MEAN SORT OF LIKE IF IF YOU IF YOU WERE TO RESOLVE THOSE KIND OF UH CASES IN ORDER TO PUT THEM SAY IN A DATABASE OR SO 
THEN YOU'D PROBABLY BE RIGHT ON THIS CASE RIGHT 
BUT UH THE GIVEN THAT THE KIND OF THING IS THAT THAT THIS NAMED ENTITY RECOGN TASK IS IS A MUCH AS A MUCH MORE UH LITERAL THING 
LIKE REALLY JUST FIN FINDING THESE KIND OF STRINGS 
I THINK IN THIS CASE UM I W I WOULD SAY THIS IS PROBABLY ONE ENTITY 
YEAH 
UM SO UH JUST ABOUT CHANGING RULES 
I MEAN IN A SENSE YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ANNOTATION THAT THAT THEY THE AGREEMENTS THAT YOU ARRIVE ON TODAY 
THAT THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU DID BEFORE 
RIGHT SO UH I MEAN THIS REALLY ONLY DISPLAYS UH THE THESE CASES WHERE YOU DISAGREED 
BUT IF YOU SORTA LIKE CHANGE A RULE NOW ON THE FLY THEN THAT MIGHT BE THEN THAT MIGHT BE UH CREATE INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE 
YEAH 
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY THIS NARROW AND BROAD BAND THAT THAT REFERS TO THE TYPE OF SPECTROGRAM THAT YOU HAVE 
LIKE IT IN THE TYPE OF FILTER OR IS IT UH OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
HE WAS IT ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO DOUBLY UNDERLINE THINGS 
UM 
I DON'T KNOW WHI WHICH ONE IT WOULD DISPLAY THEN 
I I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HAVE THIS IS Y Y YOU ALLOWED THESE KIND OF EMBEDDED UH ANNOTATIONS 
RIGHT OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD THAT'S NEARLY A THIRD 
SMILE FOR THE CAMERA 
HELIUM ONE 
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BREAK FOR AND 
BUT I THINK MAYBE THAT ONE SHOULD BE UNDERLINED 
HELIUM 
M. B. D. A. PRESUMABLY IS LAMBDA 
AND THE ON THAT CASE 
YEP 
YEP 
RIGHT WHAT'S DIFFERENT 
JUST THIS 
HIGH EXCITATION EMISSION LINES 
I THINK HIGH EXCITATION SHOULD BE ONE BECAUSE IT'S JUST SAYING 
IT'S TALKING ABOUT THE SPECIES THAT THE EMISSION LINES ARE COMING FROM 
LIVING UP IN NEBULOSITY 
SO I DON'T THINK IS AN INSTRUMENT 
OKAY 
IT INTO YES TO KEEP HUBBLE 
UM FOR THIS THAT SHOULD BE GREEN AS WELL 
WELL IT IS THE WHOLE NAME YES I GOT 
ABSORPTION LINE SYSTEMS SHOULDN'T BE THERE 
ABSORPTION LINE SYSTEMS 
AND AGAIN 
NEEDS COLUMN DENSITIES WHICH IS A DERIVED PROPERTY 
BUT THEN 
MM-HMM 
AND LYMAN ALPHA CLOUD SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE THERE 
RIGHT 
NO 
FOR SOME REASON I SEEM TO HAVE JUST ADD IN THIS ONE 
UH GET BORED 
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
YES 
I'VE LABELLED THAT WRONG 
AND HERE AGAIN 
UM TO USE 
BUT IS EMISSION LINE A. G. N. A SEPARATE CLASS FROM A. G. N. 
I DON'T THINK IT IS 
I THINK A. G. N. 
YOU WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT 
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'D PARTICULARLY CLASS THEM AS A SEPARATE SOURCE 
A SEPARATE SOURCE CLASS 
MAYBE YOU WOULD 
MM I DIDN'T IT I JUST LOOKED AT THE PLA 
AND I GUESS THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UH AN A. G. N. WITH EMISSION LINES AND ONE WITHOUT ESP ESPECIALLY IF IT'S X. RAY DETECTED 
SO YEAH I'M HAPPY WITH THAT AS LONG AS THAT'S RED AS WELL WHICH TO USE 
UM 
NO 
OH GALACTIC STARS 
I THINK YOU'RE OR YOU'RE RIGHT AGAIN THREE 
G. DWARF 
PRESUMABLY 
NEVER MET ONE BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
RIGHT 
UH IS IT 
THERE YOU GO 
AND CLUSTER YOU'RE RIGHT 
ABSORPTION 
BUT IT'S THE SAME LYMAN ALPHA FOREST SYSTEMS AGAIN 
SO YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
OR THREE MAYBE THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY YEAH I THINK SHOULD STILL BE ABSORPTION 
RADIO LOUD QUASAR AGAIN 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
I SHOULD DEFINITELY NOW WE HAD A DEBATE ABOUT THIS BEFORE AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHY I DECIDED TO MARK ASSOCIATED 
UM WHAT DOES IT MEAN 
WHAT IS IS ASSOCIATED ABSORPTION 
DOESN'T SAY IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT 
I DON'T KNOW 
I'VE GOT AN IDEA WHAT IT MEANS 
YEAH 
RIGHT OKAY 
SO SO THAT WHAT IT MEANS ON THAT C CONTEXT 
RIGHT 
UM AND ASSOCIATED AGAIN 
MECHANISMS 
QUASAR 
AND WE SHOULD'VE S PUT EMISSION LINE FEATURES SHOULDN'T WE 
BUT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO MARK THINGS WE'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY 
SO 
WE'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT N UND UNDERLINING FEATURES 
IT DOESN'T SAY IN THE MANUAL ABOUT FEATURES OR NOT BUT WE DO WHEN WE SAW ONES PREVIOUSLY WE MARKED FEATURES 
UM YES 
THE ONLY PROBLEM IT'S DONE IF WE'VE BOTH BEEN NOT MARKING IT THERE MIGHT BE OTHER INSTANCES IN THE TEXT WHERE IT'S NOT MARKED 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT OKAY 
YEAH 
YES WE'VE GOT QUASARS 
AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS LAST ONE 
SYSTEMS 
I. M. GALAXIES 
SO IT 
OKAY 
HUBBLE DEEP FIELDS IS BEING MARKED 
AND ABSORPTION SHOULDN'T BE MARKED YEP 
I DON'T THINK ABLE CLUSTER IS DIFFERENT FROM CLUSTER 
HMM 
NO ABLE CLUSTER IS JUST A A DISCOVER 
YEAH 
SOFT EXCESS 
YEP OKAY WE CAN HAVE SOFT EXCESS 
MM-HMM 
AND YES YOU'RE WRONG 'CAUSE THAT'S YOU'RE RIGHT 'CAUSE THAT'S EXTENDED EMISSION AND COMPTON EMISSION 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON BOTH OF THEM 
UM X. RAY B. L. X. AND RADIO B. L. X. I THINK ARE BECAUSE THE B. L. WITHIN SHOULD BE MARKED SO 
NO CONTINUUM 
C. O. LUMINOSITY 
MM-HMM 
UH IT'S STILL TO HIT 
UM 
INTERMEDIATE IS A REGION 
IT SHOULDN'T BE HIGHLIGHTED YOU'RE RIGHT 
BECAUSE IF IF WE TALK ABOUT THE BROAD LINE REGION WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HIGHLIGHT IT 
IT'S THE SAME IT'S JUST IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR BEFORE THE IS CALLED 
UM 
YEAH JUST GALAXIES 
STAR BURSTS 
YES THEY DO 
OH 
YES ASSUMING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STAR BURST GALAXIES RATHER THAN STAR BURST WITHIN A GALAXY 
BUT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT STAR BURST GALAXIES 
AND GALAXIES 
MM CONTINUA OR CONTINUUM FLUX 
IT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE THAT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE 
BUT WHAT DID WE DECIDE 
LET'S KEEP FLUX IN BECAUSE IT IN MOST OF THESE CASES WE'VE PUT FLUX IN 
AND THE SAME AS FEATURE 
BROAD LINE 
I WAS GONNA SAY PUT IT IN 
UM THE LACK OF BROAD LINE POLARIZATION 
BROAD LINE POLARIZATION IS THAT A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
I THINK YOU'D WANT THE WHOLE THING IN SOME EXTENT 
TS YOU CAN'T GET IT JUST FROM A SPECTRUM 
BUT YOU CAN IF YOU'VE GOT A SPECTRUM THAT'S SPLIT BY POLARIZED LIGHT 
SO IT IS 
POLARIZATION'S A PROPERTY 
YES OKAY 
YEP 
NOW I D DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS MARKED HERE 
HAVE YOU GET THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE 
OR IS TO CUT OFF 
NO 
I SAID THAT WEAK LINE WAS 
BECAUSE THE MODIFIER SHOULD BE INCLUDED WHICH I THINK IT SHOULD 
EVEN THOUGH WE CLAIM RADIO GALAXIES I THIS SHOULD BE UNDERLINED 
THIS SHOULD BE GREEN 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
ARE WE THE SAME IN THE BOTTOM LINE 
OKAY SO THE QUESTION IS UH NO IT'S DIFFERENT 
OH I'VE GOT LINE THAT'S FINE 
LINE COMES OUT AND AND SHOULD COME OUT AS WELL 
SO THERE'S A RIGHT BUT I THINK WEAK LINE SHOULD BE ONE 
BECAU I IN THE SAME WAY THAT IF YOU HAD BROAD LINE IT WOULD BE IN THERE 
RIGHT 
YES 
MM OKAY 
UM LINE AGAIN 
BUT WE'VE GOT EMISSION LINE IN THE RATIOS 
THAT'S FINE 
INFRARED GALAXIES 
THAT'S RIGHT AGAIN 
UH ONE IS IT 
NO IT'S WRONG 
YEAH 
I'LL GET THIS 
LINE 
AND THAT'S IT 
MAKING EMISSION FEATURE WHICH WE'RE INCLUDING NOW 
MM-HMM 
STAR FORMING GALAXIES 
NO WE CAN'T 
STAR FORMING GALAXIES SHOULD BE ONE 
YEAH 
PROTO GALACTIC LUMP 
WE NOT GONNA GET AWAY WITH THAT ONE 
IT'S A LAMP 
IT'S SOMETHING 
EMISSION FEATURE AGAIN 
DAMP LYMAN 
THAT SHOULD BE BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN ABSORBER IT'S AN ABSORPTION 
UH COVERS YEAH 
YEAH YOU CROSS 'EM OUT 
FEATURES 
A FEATURE AGAIN 
IS A AFTER A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHAS AGAIN 
YEAH 
FEATURE AND THE REST IS THE SAME 
NOW A LINE SHOULD BE ONE 
X. RAY B. L. 
INTERMEDIATE 
WE PUT IN TYPE TYPE ONE POINT NINE 
YES I THINK IT SHOULD BE ONE 
MM-HMM 
OH GOSH THIS LOOKS COMPLICATED 
UH IT'S JUST IT'S LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION 
AND WE DON'T LIKE THAT ONE 
AND WE DON'T LIKE THAT ONE 
YES WE ARE TAKING OUT LINE IN ITS OWN 
SO WE UH YES 
EVERY TIME 
YES I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE IN GENERAL EVERY TIME THERE'S BEEN LINE WHERE'S THERE BEEN LINE 
OKAY IT'S LINE WIDTH BUT IT'S ST IT'S STILL WHERE IT SAYS LINES 
HAVE WE HAD ANY JUST WHERE IT SAYS LINE RATIOS 
MM 
YES I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
NO 
WE WANT THE WHOLE THING IN THERE 
OR IN THE U. V. 
I DON'T THINK SPECTRUM SHOULD BE THERE 
BUT IF IT'S A WAVE LENGTH OR A WAVE BAND WE WERE PUTTING IT IN 
YEAH 
YEP YOU'RE RIGHT 
LINE CENTRE YOU CAN PAINT IT 
NOT LIKE LINE WIDTH BUT YOU CAN POINT OUT LINE CENTRE 
IN FACT THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED I THINK 
YOU CAN POINT AT THE LINE WINGS 
MM THAT'S JUST A 
YEP ONE THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE 
MM YOU'RE RIGHT STAR BURST 
OH STAR BURST ACTIVE STAR BURST LIKE ACTIVITY THAT'S I DON'T THINK THAT'S A CLASS 
IT'S A ACTION 
BUT O. GO ABOUT A AN A. AN A. G. N. IS A CLASS 
A STAR BURST IS A TYPE OF GALAXY BUT IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHIN A GALAXY 
IT'S 
BUT AN A. G. N. IS AN OBJECT 
THE STAR BURST YOU CAN'T SAY HERE IS A STAR BURST 
CAN'T STAR BURST IF IT MEANS GALAXY 
IF THIS MEANS STAR BURST GALAXY LIKE ACTIVITY THEN THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH 
BUT STAR BURST REFERS TO 
MM 
I CAN SEE THAT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
LET'S KEEP IT IN 
I I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ANYWAY 
MM-HMM 
YES I THINK IT WAS UM MAYBE IF IT WAS STAR FORMING LIKE ACTIVITY THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT 
BUT YEAH 
YES THAT'S RIGHT BUT STAR BURST IS DIFFERENT 
OKAY 
UM WE'VE JUST GET THIS SPLIT UP 
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE W H. 
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S TWO 
IT'S A WAVE LENGTH REGION BUT IT'S TILT BUT YOU'RE SAYING BETWEEN THAT LINE AND THAT LINE 
UM 
YOU ARE YES 
THAT'S ALL PART OF THE NAME 
LINE RATIOS 
BUT GALAXY SHOULD BE ONE 
SO WE NEED TO WRITE THAT 
UM HOLD ON 
OH NO THEY ARE THE SAME 
SORRY I MISSED THAT 
ABSORPTION LINE SYSTEMS 
HUBBLE 
AND HUBBLE 
AND GALAXY 
GALAXY DISTRIBUTION 
STILL THE DISTRIBUTION OF GALAXIES 
UM HIGH IONIZATION LINES 
YES 
MM-HMM 
OPEN THAT RADIUS BUTTON 
YES DON'T INCLUDE PLATT'S SPECTRUM 
QUASARS 
LOW IONIZATION 
MM BUT THERE SHOULD BE ONE 
UM LOW IONIZATION TH THEY'RE LOW BALS AREN'T THEY 
LOW BAL IS A SEPARATE CLASS OF SOURCE 
UM I I DON'T KNOW IF HIGH BALS ARE BUT LOW BALS ARE 
OH RIGHT YEAH 
YEAH 
I SHOULDN'T YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
EMISSION LINE CANDIDATES 
YES YOU'RE RIGHT 
CONTINUUM I THINK SHOULD BE IN AREN'T THEY 
ALTHOUGH I WAS TALKING ABOUT CONTI YEAH CONTINUUM LUMINOSITY CONTINUUM FLUX IT SHOULD BE ONE 
I THOUGHT WE HAD WE'D PUT IN 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WE WEREN'T DOING BROAD BAND DETECTIONS 
WE WERE DOING YEAH 
THIS IS NICE TO 
NOW WHAT WERE WE DOING F 
IT 
AND WHAT WERE WE DOING 
UM 
I DON'T KNOW 'CAUSE YOU IN LANGUAGE SPEAK MARK EACH AS A SEPARATE ENTITY 
THAT'S DIFFERENT 
MARK SUB SECTIONS OF ENTITIES T NO THAT'S DIFFERENT 
DOESN'T REALLY EASY 
SO WE NEED A RULE FOR THAT 
WHAT HAVE WE DONE IT 
Z. EQUALS TWO 
YEAH 
SO NO OKAY 
LET'S WHATEVER'S EASIEST FOR YOU 
YOU UM YES TAKE IT IT 
ISN'T IT 
THE SPECTRAL COMPONENTS 
X. RAY BINARIES 
HUBBLE DEEP FIELD AGAIN 
EMISSION LINE OBJECTS SHOULDN'T BE IN THREE OF THEM 
RADIO QUIET QUASAR SHOULD BE G MM 
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT 
NOW YOU'VE DONE ON AND NOT THE OTHER 
AND YOU'RE RIGHT BECAUSE ONE'S LINE FORMATION AND ONE'S LINE PROFILE 
A. G. M. I'VE DONE AGAIN 
THIS IS NICE AND SAY 
COMPONENTS 
UM 
MM-HMM 
BUT WE WANT THE LINE STILL 
THE GALAXY OR GALAXY 
GIVEN THAT IT IS THE GALAXY 
IT SHOULD BE THE GALAXY I GUESS 
INSERT PROPER WHATEVER THE WORD IS 
H. V. C. S AT THIS 
KNOWN TO L IN THE DIRECTION OF HIGH VELOCITY CLOUDS 
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE 
THEY SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE 
YES BUT THEY DON'T EXPLAIN 
I. C. M. 
SCUBA 
SOMETIMES ANYWAY WHEN IT WORKS 
UM 
NO BUT NO YOU'RE RIGHT AND THIS SHOULD BE RED AS WELL 
IT SHOULD ALL BE 
NARROW LINE A. G. N. ARE DIFFERENT 
I MISSED OUT THAT 
H. BETA L WIDTH 
SO 
JUST KEEP H. BETA I THINK 
GIVEN THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING LINE WIDTH ITSELF 
EVEN LINE OF IT IS LINE WIDTH 
YOU CAN HAVE FLUX 
H. BETA SHOULD BE ONE 
NOT THAT LINE BUT WE WANT ENHANCED 
WE WE WANTED AND THIS IS RELATIVE WE WANTED MODIFIERS OF MODIFIERS OF SPECTRAL LINES E. G. WEAK BROAD LINES 
I WEAK W RELATIVE TO WHAT THOUGH 
IT'S ALL RELATIVE BUT IT'S STILL A MODIFIER OF THAT LINE 
AND THE SAME 
UM 
NO ONLY WHEN IT'S EMBEDDED 
UH ABOUT THE SECOND ONE 
UH IT'S INCLUDED BESIDE MARK IT ALL AS ONE ENTITY YES 
YES I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE MISSED THE 
UM WEAK EMISSION I THINK SHOULD BE IN THERE 
MM 
IF WE'RE INCLUDING IT EMISSION 
UM 
NO THAT'S TRUE SO WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE EITHER OF THIS 
BUT THEN WEAK YEAH OKAY NOTHING AT ALL 
THAT'S NOT A SEPARATE SOURCE 
RED CONTINUUM SHOULD BE ONE 
BROAD LINE EMISSION AND THE REST FRAME U. V. SHOULD ALL BE ONE 
YOU'RE RIGHT YEAH 
OH 
NO IT SHOULDN'T 
OH YES SORRY YOU'RE RIGHT 
LINES 
YES THAT'S TRUE 
ASSOCIATED AGAIN WHICH MEANS NOTHING 
CONTINUUM SOURCE SHOULDN'T BE ONE 
AND ASSOCIATED SHOULDN'T BE ONE 
C. T. A. A. A. 
WHAT DOES IT STAND FOR 
THAT IS A SEPARATE THING 
Y YEAH 
YES BUT IT'S ALSO A TELESCOPE AND I THINK UH IF THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OF DESCRIBING IT THAT TELESCOPE 
THE C. T. A. A. FOUR METRE TELESCOPE IS MUST BE WHAT IT'S CALLED 
OTHERWISE THEY'D CALL IT A NAME 
UM 
WE'RE INCLUDING OBSERVATORY IF IT REFERS 
IF IT'S PART OF THE PROPER NAME OF AN INSTRUMENT 
YES UP THE TELESCOPE 
NO JUST FOUR METRE 
NO SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE 
OH NO IT SHOULD 
RON AND ABSORPTION 
SO IT CONTAMINATION FROM BLENDED IRON AND ABSORPTION LINES 
NO IT'S NOT 
IT'S NO IT'S NOT 
I IF THE COMMA WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE ONE 
SO THEY DO MEAN IRON LINE 
SO SO IT SHOULD BE ONE 
AND WE'RE KEEPING LINE IN 'CAUSE ITS STRENGTHS YEAH 
CONTINUUM FLUX WE SHOULD HAVE ALL IN 
G UH 
THERE'RE GONNA BE HUNDREDS OF THIS 
LEAST IT'S QUICK 
UM 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A SEPARATE CLASS OF QUASAR 
BUT THEN I DON'T KNOW ABOUT QUASARS 
I THINK IT SHOULD UP 
YEAH 
THAT'S OKAY 
UM THE A. W. D. S 
MM WHITE DWARF 
UM 
OKAY SO IT IS A DIFFERENT CLASS 
OKAY 
NOPE 
LOW BAL 
MM I'D PUT MULTIPLE IN THERE 
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO COMPONENTS 
I SAY NEITHER OF THEM 
OR YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
NO ABSORPTION LINES 
THAT SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED 
OH SORRY I'M I UM 
YEAH I DON'T THIN I DON'T THINK THERE WAS SO BUT 
MM ONLY IF IT'S AN ASTRO PHYSICALLY DISTINCT DISTINCT 
OKAY 
NO ABSORPTION LINES SHOULD BE ONE AND THE SAME HERE 
I DIDN'T 
NICE NOT TO DO ASSOCIATED FOR NICE 
I YOU'RE 
Y YES YOU SHOULDN'T 
AND WE WE OH GOSH WHAT WERE WE GONNA TO DO ABOUT A. AND AGAIN 
YES YOU ARE RIGHT YEAH 
STRONG SOFT X. RAY FLUX 
YEAH YOU CAN POINT TO THAT 
AND THAT'S ASSOCIATED ABSORPTION LINES 
AND ABSORPTION AND SMALL CLOUDS IS IT 
UH NOW THIS IS THE CONJUNCT RULE AGAIN 
AND I'VE DONE BLUE WINGS OF THIS AND THIS AND THIS 
AND THIS IS AN DOUBLE LINE 
AND THIS 
AND PRESUMABLY THAT'S RED THERE 
IT GOES OVER THERE 
I THINK I IF THE LINE'S TOO LONG YOU YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED ALL I IS NO 
BUT AND I'VE HIGHLIGHTED IT SEPARATELY 
IT SHOULD BE SEPARATE 
I THINK OF THE LINE'S TOO LONG 
IT'S ONLY HA PUTTING THE BOTTOM LINE BECAUSE OLIVIA WOULD'VE MARKED FROM BLUE ALL THE WAY TO THE END IS ONE LONG LINE 
YES BUT I THINK IT PROBABLY WAS AND JUST HASN'T PRINTED BECAUSE OLIVIA WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED MARKING AT FOURTEEN O. TWO 
ALMO TWO LINES ABOVE 
YEAH BUT I THINK IT'S JUST M MISSING AT THE PRINTING IF THE LINE GOES OVER THE END 
'CAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT YOU LOOK AT WHAT OLIVIA'S DONE HERE OLIVIA WOULDN'T HAVE JUST HIGHLIGHTED THAT LINE 
SHE WOULD HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE WHOLE THING 
YEAH AND IT'S JUST HASN'T PRINTED THAT 
BUT IT IS MARKED I THINK 
MM-HMM 
SHOULDN'T BE 
BUT IT'S AL IS THAT ALSO THE NAME OF THE SOURCE 
SO IT SHOULD BE THIS ONE PLUS THE PINK 
LINE BROADNESS AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE ONE 
THAT'S TRUE 
WELL OKAY YEAH 
SO WE'VE BEEN IN HERE 
ALRIGHT 
MY TABLE FOR NOW 
RICH IRON SPECTRUM 
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT 
AT THE FEATURE OF THE SPECTRUM 
DOES THAT MAKE IT A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
UM 
IT'S A FEATURE OF THE WHOLE SPECTRUM RATHER THAN YOU CAN'T SAY THERE IS A RICH IRON SPECTRUM YOU CAN SAY THIS IS A RICH IRON SPECTRUM 
YES IT'S NOT A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
IT'S FEATURE OF THE SPECTRUM WHICH IS DIFFERENT 
YES 
AND THEN WITH THE SAME 
GOSH WE'RE GETTING THROUGH THIS NOW 
UM GIANT ELLIPTICALS OR ELLIPTICALS 
WE WERE INCLU ARE YOU NOT 
THEY ARE SEPARATE BUT ARE THEY A SEPARATE CLASS 
I THINK THEY PROBABLY ARE IN THE ETA B. T. G. S AND THINGS 
IONIZED EMISSION 
YES I THINK YOU WANT IONIZED IN THERE 
YOU CAN POINT TO IONIZED EMISSION RATHER THAN 
HMM 
EMISSION FROM HIGH EXCITATION LINES 
YEAH 
IT IT'S POINTING THERE AND SAYING LIKE THERE'S A HIGH EXCITATION EMISSION 
AND THERE'S NOT HIGH EXCITATION 
MM-HMM 
LINE RATIO 
WHAT'S DIFFERENT THERE 
OH THERE YES 
NARROW LINE SEYFERT ONE SHOULD ALL BE ONE 
WITH THE RED INSIDE IT 
THAT 
YEAH 
IT'S DESCRIBING THE LINE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 
WE'VE INCLUDED IT BEFORE WHEN YOU'VE SAID THIS HAS BEEN DETECTED 
FROM I THINK SHOULD BE IN THERE 
E EMISSION LINES 
QUASARS I MISSED 
DAMPED LYMAN ALSO IS NOT SYSTEMS YEAH 
MM NO I THINK IT'S A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
YOU CAN POINT AT THE DAMPED LYMAN A ALPHA RESORPTION IN IN THE SAME WAY YOU CAN POINT AT H. BETA EMISSION 
ALTHOUGH H. BETA EMISSION IS A PROCESS 
OR EMISSION FROM H. BETA IS IS A PROCESS 
IN THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION SYSTEMS WE CROSSED OUT 
WE ALSO CROSSED OUT 
WHAT DID WE DO BACK 
MM YOU CAN POINT TO LOW RED SHIFT DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION 'CAUSE YOU'RE SHIFTED IN THE SPECTRUM THERE 
UM 
WOULD TO BE IF IT WAS H. BETA ABSORPTION 
AND YOU JUST TAKE OUT THE LOW RED SHIFTS 
QUASARS WITH H. BETA ABSORPTION YOU'D PUT IN 
BECAUSE IT'S A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
I THINK DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION 
I THINK IT'S BOTH 
BECAUSE WE'VE EVERY FEATURE IS PRODUCED BY A PROCESS 
YES IT'S DEPENDS WHETHER IT HAS TO WHETHER IT MEANS WITH LOW RED SHIFT DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA CLOUD ABSORPTION 
IF IT WAS DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBERS THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT 
BUT I THINK ABSORPTION 
IT'S A PROCESS BUT IT ALSO PRODUCES A SPECTRAL FEATURE WHERE YOU CAN SAY THERE'S THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION 
THERE'S THE ON THE SAME WAY THAT THE YEAH H. BETA EMISSION IS A PROCESS 
YEAH I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN THERE 
MICRO QUASARS 
THEY'RE DUBBED MICRO QUASARS 
SO IT GONNA BE A DECENT SOURCE TYPE IN THE FUTURE 
I HAVEN'T HEARD REFERRED TO SINCE 
BUT 
BUT JUST TALK ABOUT THE MICRO QUASAR 
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THEY HAVE UM 
MM ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE'RE HAVING HYPER LUMINOUS GALAXIES WHERE YOU KNOW THEY'VE JUST GOT ULTRA LUMINOUS AND UH EVEN MORE HYPER LUMINOUS 
WELL SOMEONE MUST HAVE MADE THAT UP FOR THE FIRST TIME 
I THINK 
SAME AS A HYPER LUMINOUS GALAXY BEING VERY VERY EXTREME 
I RECKON A DWARF AMORPHOUS NUCLEI STAR BURST GALAXY A DANCE IS A YEAH OKAY 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ACRONYM BECAUSE THAT'S HAS THAT SHOULD BE ONE 
STAR BURST NUCLEI 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
OH 
THE OBJECT 
IF IT WAS STAR BURST GALAXIES IT WOULD BE IN THERE 
STAR BURST NUCLEI REFERS TO A REGION WITHIN AN OBJECT WHICH WOULD NOT BE OBSERVED SEPARATELY 
UM 
OKAY 
BECAUSE THE ACRONYM HAS STAR BURST IN IT UH GALAXIES IN IT IN THE S. AND OF THE ACRONYM INCLUDES ITS 
THEN IT HAS TO BE IN THERE 
CONTINUUM FLUX YOU CAN HAVE 
I. V. AND OPTICAL EMISSION LINE RATIOS 
BUT 
I. V. AND OPTICAL EMI U. V. AND OPTICAL EMISSION SHOULD BE IN THERE THOUGH 
NO IT SHOULDN'T 'CAUSE IT IT MODIFIES THE RATIOS 
OH GOSH NO EMISSION L OKAY SO I'VE HIGHLIGHTED THIS ONE OR RED AND THEN THE WHOLE THING IN GREEN BECAUSE TYPE TWO SEYFART GALAXIES ARE NO 
SO I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AS LONG AS THIS IS 
T. V. GAMMA RAY EMISSION 
WE WEREN'T DOING BROAD BAND DETECTIONS YEAH 
USING THE 
IT IS YES 
VERY STUPID BUT IT IS 
F. B. S. OBJECTS SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE 
I DON'T KNOW BUT IT'S GOT OBJECT 
AND THE MAMA SCANNING MACHINE IS AN INSTRUMENT IT'S NOT A TELESCOPE IT'S AN INSTRUMENT 
OH YES IT SHOULD BE 
NARROW EMISSION LINES FROM HIGH IRON YEAH 
ABSORPTION FEATURES 
WEAK CONTINUUM 
THAT SHOULD BE SEPARATE 
CONTINUUM RADIATION 
ANOTHER 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
UH THERE'S EMISSION FROM THE NARROW LINE REGION YEAH 
NARROW LINE EMISSION SHOULD BE ONE 
F. V. LOW BAL IS A SOURCE TYPE 
STUPID KECKERS 
YOU SAID TO BE UH NO KECK OBSERVATORY 
YES WE DID DECIDE KECK WAS GOING ON 
AT ALL YEP 
AND WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW EMISSION 
RADIO QUASARS 
YEAH 
OH NO RADIO LOUD AND RADIO QUIET OR 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
UM 
YOU I THINK THEY'RE A SEPARATE CLASS YES 
WE'RE NOT PUTTING THEM IN SPECTRAL BUT I THINK WE ARE PUTTING THEM IN BECAUSE IT'S SO BROAD BAND 
BUT YES THEY ARE SEPARATE 
NO YOU CAN'T POINT TO TO YEAH 
MISSED GROUP 
SUBARU TELESCOPE YOU'RE RIGHT 
IT'S UNDER A PROPER NAME 'CAUSE IT'S GOT A CAPITAL T. 
WONDERFUL 
WELL ONCE WE'VE GOT THEM IDENTIFIED A LOT OF THEM WERE THE SAME PROBLEM GOING ROUND AND ROUND 
UM WHERE'S THE BIN IN HERE 
AND MORE AT THE POINT CAN I GET IT IT WITHOUT GOING UH I CAN CARRY MY LITTLE BITS ON THE WITH UM 
EXCUSE ME CAMERA I NEED TO FIND THE BIN 
UM AND THERE ISN'T ONE IS THERE 
HELLO 
RIGHT 
MM MM-HMM 
YEAH IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS 
THAT'S THIS IS A BIT OF H. T. M. L. GOO 
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BREAK FOR AND 
AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE H. T. M. L. GOO 
BUT THIS THIS ISN'T A S YEAH 
AND THIS ISN'T A SEPARATE THING SO I W I WOULD AGREE THAT YOU UNDERLINE THE YOU UNDERLINE THE GO ON EACH CASE BUT NOT THE END 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM MM-HMM 
MM 
YES 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
RIGHT YOU DON'T GET THAT 
SO ISN'T AN INSTRUMENT 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
WE AGREED FOR TO KEEP HUBBLE 
YEP 
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE A SOURCE TYPE YEAH 
IT'S 
YEAH DO YOU THINK THAT'S PART OF THE NAME YEAH 
I DON'T YEAH I HAVE ONE WAY OF KNOWING YEAH 
YEP 
YEP 
RIGHT 
MM YEAH 
YEP THAT'S FINE 
NOPE 
I WON 
OH 
OKAY 
YEAH I KNOW 
SO THERE A PRIZE AT THE END 
BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE 
UM OKAY 
MM THAT'S A SPECTRAL FEATURE THAT'S OKAY 
YOU 
EMISSION LINE A. G. N. 
YOU CAN GET A. G. N. WITHOUT EMISSION LINES 
I THINK IN PHIL'S PAPER HE DOES DOESN'T UH 
THE PAPER I POINTED YOU TO A FEW WEEKS AGO OUR LAST WEEK 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANT BUT YES 
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THEM AS SEPARATE CLASSES BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS 
YEAH 
YEP 
OH 
MM 'KAY 
YEAH THAT G. DWARFS ARE THINGS AREN'T THEY 
THAT'S ALRIGHT YEAH 
I SAW IT YESTERDAY 
OH YEAH 
THREE UH SO 
BY LYMAN ALPHA FOREST AND LYMAN LIMIT SYSTEMS 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
EMISSION MODELS DEFINITELY NOT 
UM WHY ASSOCIATED 
YEAH 
IT MEANS IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH SOME PHYSICAL THING ABOUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SPECTRAL FEATURES I DON'T THINK 
DOES IT 
MM-HMM 
I'M HAPPY TO SAY M. TWO WHAT NOT ABSORPTION IS A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
BUT ASSOCIATED MEANS IT'S ASSOCIATED TO SOME PHYSICAL THING 
SO YEAH 
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE ONE 
ALRIGHT 
YEP 
THESE ARE MECHANISMS 
SO THEY DON'T COUNT 
DON'T THINK 
UM 
YEP I JUST MISSED OUT 
AND THAT'S IT 
HMM 
YEAH WE SHOULD DO 
YEAH WE DID THAT THE SAME 
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING 
YEAH 
YEAH AND IT'S NOT IN THE MANUAL IS IT 
YEAH 
SO LET'S DO THAT 
EXTEND 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEP 
IT'S A KIND OF A REGULAR GALAXY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OR RIGHT 
THAT DEFINITELY GETS TO GO ON 
THAT'S NOT A COMPONENT 
I THINK 
YEAH WE COULD COME TO BLOWS OVER SOFT EXCESS 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I AGREE 
THAT'S FINE 
NO 
NO FOR CONTINUUM 
UM 
YEAH THAT'S FINE 
UH I CAN AGREE WITH TAKING THAT IT 
THAT THE IS CALLED YEAH I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE SHOULD IT 
'CAUSE IT'S A REGION YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH IT'S BADLY WRITTEN 
INFRARED GALAXIES 
WE SAID NOT TO MARK THINGS BASED SOLELY ON 
SO IT'S JUST DEFINED ONLY BY WAVE LENGTH 
SO WE CAN'T INCLUDE INFRARED GALAXIES 
AND 
STAR BURSTS COUNT SURELY 
MM YES YEAH THEY ARE 
GALAXIES 
MM 
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
I'D SAY CONTINUUM FLUX BUT I DON'T OBVIOUSLY 
BUT I DON'T CARE 
YEP OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM NO I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT IT 
OH 
MM NO YOU CAN'T POINT TO IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM 
UH WE'RE MISSING WEAK WEAK LINE 
OKAY YEAH 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
OH 
YEAH ONE YOU'VE GOT LINE IN THERE 
UM 
AND SHOULD COME OUT 
OKAY MM-HMM 
YEP THAT'S OKAY 
GALACTIC BLACK HOLE CANDIDATES 
YEAH 
YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT'S A SOURCE TYPE 
MM MM-HMM 
YEP 
NO IT'S NOT RIGHT 
RIGHT 
UH LINE EMITTING GAS I DON'T LIKE YEAH 
FOR INFRARED GALAXIES WE CAN'T HAVE 
THAT'S OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S OKAY 
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION THE SAME 
RIGHT YEP 
EMISSION FEATURE 
YEAH THAT CAN'T BE ONE 
YEP 
OH YES IT SHOULD BE 
YEP THAT SHOULD BE ONE 
THAT IS NOT A SOURCE TYPE 
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING 
YEAH 
DIBULAE ABSORPTION 
NO BUT IT SAYS IT COVERS A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALL ANGULAR SIZE 
IT'S A PHYSICAL THING 
YEP 
UH THIS FEATURE 
YEAH OKAY 
ALPHA 
YEAH YOU DON'T GET THAT 
DO YOU 
THESE ARE THESE ARE REGIONS GLOBS NEBULAE 
YEP 
YEAH 
X. RAY B. L. LAX 
YEP THAT'S OKAY 
INTERMEDIATE TYPES 
IT NOW IF WE'RE D 
DID WE IN THE END 
YEAH 
OH RIGHT 
YOU GET IT THEN 
THAT DOESN'T GO ON AND THAT'S OKAY 
RIGHT THAT'S OKAY 
WE DON'T LIKE SYSTEMS 
YEAH THAT'S OKAY 
ARE WE 
OKAY YEP 
WHAT LINE ARE WE TAKING OUT 
LINE WIDTH YEAH 
LINE RATIOS 
WE'VE BEEN TAKING OUT LINE IS A 
WORD THAT RELATES TO OTHER WORDS 
MY HEAD IS GOING YEAH 
BUT LINES ARE STILL LINES 
YEAH THAT'S OKAY 
RIGHT I AGREE THAT THAT CAN GO TO 'CAUSE THAT'S A FITTING THING 
ABSORPTION FEATURES IN THE U. V. SPECTRA 
OKAY 
IT'S LIKELY ONE SPECTRUM IN THE U. V. WHICH YOU CAN SEE ABSORPTION FEATURES IN 
OH RIGHT 
QUASARS QUASARS 
UH-HUH 
YEAH I'M RIGHT 
AND HERE I THINK I'M RIGHT AGAIN 
LINE CENTRE 
YEAH YOU'D YOU'D SAY LINE WINGS 
ALRIGHT YOU GET IT 
RIGHT YOU WIN 
UM ECLIPSING I DON'T THINK 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
Y YEAH BUT THEN THE A. G. N. LIKE ACTIVITY 
SO BOTH OF THEM HAVE TO GO 
A STAR BURST IS A CLASS 
AN A. G. N. 
BUT WE'RE COUNTING STAR BURSTS AS STAR BURST GALAXIES 
NO BUT A STAR BURST GALAXY IS ONLY A GALAXY WHICH HAS A STAR BURST IN IT 
LIKE AN A. G. AN ACTIVE GALAXY IS JUST A GALAXY WITH AN A. G. N. IN IT 
YEAH 
I THINK THEY'RE THE SAME 
THEY EITHER HAVE TO BOTH STAY OR BOTH GO AND I I THINK THEY SHOULD STAY 
YEAH 
STAR FORMATION WE WEREN'T PUTTING IN 
THAT 
OR WAS IT'S A WAVE LENGTH REGION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I'M RIGHT HERE 
THAT'S PART OF A NAME YEAH 
MM 'KAY 
INFRARED GALAXIES 
THIS TIME YOU HAVE TO 
BUT GALAXIES SHOULD BE ONE 
RIGHT 
UH UH WHAT HAVE WE DONE 
HUBBLE 
YEAH OK I IN THE GALAXY DISTRIBUTION 
YEAH OKAY 
MM 
YEAH WE DID IT BEFORE 
YEAH THAT'S OKAY 
OH 
YEAH OKAY 
WE WEREN'T DOING SPECTRAL SHAPES WERE WE 
YEAH THAT COUNTS 
MM-HMM 
WELL 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
THAT COUNTS 
THEY ARE AND IT'S A BIG JOKE 
HIGH BALLS 
OH YEAH 
UM NEXT 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT DOESN'T GO ON 
THAT MEANS OBJECTS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AND MAYBE IT A PARTICULAR RED SHIFT BASED ON IT 
YEAH 
THAT DOESN'T COUNT 
MM CONTINUUM LUMINOSITIES 
I DON'T REMEMBER ABOUT LUMINOSITIES 
WE'VE BEEN PUTTING IN CONTINUUM FLUX 
YEAH 
MM 
MEAN IT 
OH 
RADIO LOUD QUASAR SHOULD BE IN Z. EQUALS TWO SHOULDN'T 
THE REAL WAS TO LEAVE IT IN WAS IT 
YEAH THAT'S FOR THINGS MARKED WITH AND 
YEAH IT DOESN'T SAY 
Z. EQUALS TWO SO UM MEANS TO A CERTAIN DISTANCE 
UM SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN ABOUT RADIO LOUD QUASARS AS A THING 
SO IT'S WHETHER TO INCLUDE THE Z. EQUALS TWO ON THE 
YEAH 
OH 
NO 
YEAH 
NO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM NO WE CAN'T HAVE THAT 
YEP 
A SOURCE TYPE 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
UM RIGHT 
YES 
UM YEAH 
YEAH 
WE CAN RID OF THAT CAN'T WE 
GALAXY WITH THE GALAXY 
IT SHOULD BE THE GALAXY YEAH 
H. V. C. COMPLEXES 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT H. V. C. STANDS FOR BUT SINCE THEY'RE COMPLEXES WE CAN CROSS IT IT 
HUH 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT H. V. C. STANDS FOR 
YEAH THAT DOESN'T COUNT 
MM-HMM 
SCUBA THAT'S AN INSTRUMENT 
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
SHOULD BE THIS AND IT PROBABLY SO THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THAT MEANS 
UH I SEE 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
BUT LINE 
I DON'T THINK THAT MATTERS VERY MUCH 
OKAY 
HURRAY 
UM UH BUT YEP 
MM NO 
DO WE 
BUT ENHANCED RELATIVE TO WHAT 
OKAY 
BUT WHEN YEAH 
UH I DON'T THINK I WAS DOING THAT 
YEAH I'VE MISSED THAT A LOT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OH YEAH EXTENDED EMISSION IS EXTENDED 
WE WE'VE NOT BEEN INCLUDING EXTENDED EMISSION 
SO 
YEAH 
WEAK EMISSION LEVELS IS JUST A WAY OF SAYING YEAH I AGREE 
DONE 
STAR BURST CONTRIBUTION 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
RED CONTINUUM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE TOO 
WE WEREN'T DOING COMPONENTS 
SO 
YEAH THIS IS THIS A RADIO TRANSFER THING 
SO THEY DON'T MEAN THEY MEAN PHOTONS IN THE LINES ESCAPE 
NOT THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN PAINT IT 
I DON'T THINK THAT COUNTS 
MM 
UH UH 
MM THAT SHOULD BE UH WAIT IS THAT SO THAT'S AN OBSERVATORY ISN'T IT 
THE C. T. IS THE C. T. A. A. FOUR METRE UH THE NAME OF THAT TELESCOPE 
NO 
AND THE U. I. T. IS AN OBSERVATORY AS WELL ISN'T IT 
SO 
YEAH 
BUT WE IF WE PUT 
YEAH 
BUT THEN WE HAVE TO INCLUDE FOUR METRE AS WELL 
NO 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEP I AGREE 
MM-HMM 
WHAT IS THAT COMMA DOING THERE 
YEAH IN UH I SEE I SEE I S YEAH 
ACCOUNTING FOR GALACTIC REDDENING CONTAMINATION FROM BLENDED IRON 
WHAT THEY MEAN IS BLENDED IRON LINES 
YEAH 
CONTINUUM FLUXES YEAH WE'RE DOING THAT YEAH 
NO 
OH YEAH 
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA Q. S. I. 
UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS EITHER 
NO DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA Q. S. A. S 
IT'S NOT A SOURCE TYPE THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE 
SO 
WHAT'S D. A. 
AND THERE'S W. D. S 
IT'S TWENTY FIVE OF D. A. TYPE AND SIX OF D. B. TYPE 
YEP 
YEP 
YES YOU'RE FINE WITH THAT 
NOPE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
NO LUMINOS 
YEAH LOW LUMINOSITY Q. S. A. IS NO 
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THEM A LOT BUT 
WELL WE'RE DOING ULTRA LUMINOUS GALAXIES 
SO WE SHOULD DO 
YEAH 
PEOPLE DISCUSS THEM AS A SEPARATE CLASS 
THEY ARE SO SO MUCH AS ULTRA LUMINOUS GALAXIES ARE 
AND YEP THAT SHOULD BE ONE 
EXCELLENT 
REGIONS 
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT 
UH I. AND B. 
NO THAT'S THE CONJUNCTURAL 
I'M RIGHT HERE I THINK 
F YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S OKAY 
OH 
OH 
RIGHT 
IN THE A. A. L. OUTFLOW IT'S A R YEAH THAT DOESN'T COUNT 
IT DOESN'T COUNT 
AND I DIDN'T UH 
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS

THE N. SHOULD BE 
YEAH YEAH 
MM 
HMM 
YEAH 
UH I SEE 
SO YOUR N. STARTS YEP YEP I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN 
MM 
SO N. PROBABLY SHOULD BE HIGHLI 
YEP 
ABSORPTION COMPONENTS DON'T COUNT 
CONTINUUM SOURCE DOES THAT COUNT 
SHOULDN'T BE 
MM UH IS IT IS 
THAT'S RIGHT 
PROBABLY YEAH 
YEP 
UH LINE BROADNESS 
THAT'S A WAY OF SAYING LINE WIDTH THOUGH AND WE DON'T MARK LINE WIDTH 
OH 
RICH IRON SPECTRUM 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEP THAT'S THE RICH IRON SPECTRUM 
I AGREE LET'S GET RID OF IT 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT THAT'S NOT SHOULDN'T GO ON 
SO THAT EVERYTHING 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH WE AREN'T GONNA MAKE IT TO OUR SECOND COOKIE BREAK 
I DON'T MIND 
ARE GIANT ELLIPTICALS SEPARATE THINGS 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
OKAY 
LINE EMITTING GAS DOESN'T GET ONE 
IF YOU'RE DOING EMISSION FROM HIGH YEAH 
HMM 
WELL SHE 
SHE WAS ALLOWED EMISSION FROM HIGH EXCITATION WHAT NOT 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME 
YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS 
NO 
WELL I'M NOT CERTAIN OF HIGH EXCITATION SHOULD GO IN BUT IF HIGH EXCITATION SHOULD GO ON I THINK IONIZED MEANS THE SAME THING DOESN'T IT 
SO 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
YOU'VE GOT X. RAY SOURCE R. ONE SEVENTEEN 
MM-HMM 
NO THAT'S 
THIS IS DESCRIBING THE BAND YOU DO THE OBSERVATIONS IN 
YEAH THAT COUNTS 
ALRIGHT 
RIGHT OKAY 
SO 
SO YEAH OKAY 
YEP

OH 
THOSE SHOULDN'T BE THERE SHOULD THEY 
NO 
OH OKAY OKAY OKAY 
NO YES 
I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE AGREED TO CROSS OUT BEFORE ISN'T IT 
I THINK IT'S A PROCESS IT I THINK 
ESPECIALLY WHEN UH THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE Y WE'RE CHOOSING LOW RED SHIFT ABSORPTION 
THAT'S NOT REALLY SOMETHING YOU CAN PAINT IT 
MM 
I'M NOT TOO FAST I DON'T THINK 
MM NO I'M NOT SURE 
IT'S WHETHER IT'S A PROCESS OR A A FEATURE 
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT WE'VE DONE BEFORE 
WELL IF IT WAS IF IT WAS ABSORPTION AND DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA CLOUDS YOU'D NOT MARK ABSORPTION 
I DO THINK IT'S A PROCESS I THINK 
HMM 
MM 
WELL WE'VE BOTH MARKED IT 
SO LET'S LEAVE OUT THERE 
MICRO QUASARS 
YEAH 
THAT MEANS IT'S NEW FANGLED 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THEY'VE MADE UP THAT WORD 
YEAH 
BUT WE DO THEY WHAT DEFINES A MICRO QUASAR 
BUT 
OH YEAH Y Y THERE'S NOT BEEN MORE THAN ONE STUDY OF DWARF AMORPHOUS NUCLEAR STAR BURST GALAXIES 
SO THAT DO WE SAY WE TAKE THAT IT 
YEP THAT'S IT ON IT 
SO THAT'S OKAY YEP 
OH 
OOPS 
YEP THAT'S FINE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WE WOULDN'T HAVE LINE RATIOS 
SO YEAH THAT GOES 
YEAH 
NO IT MODIFIES RATIOS 
MM 
RIGHT 
YEP THAT'S FINE 
PLUS RED 
YEAH 
WE WEREN'T DOING BROAD BAND DETECTIONS 
RIGHT 
THAT'S DEFINITELY AN INSTRUMENT NAME 
RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN 
YEP YOU'RE RIGHT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO YOU CAN HAVE THAT 
RIGHT 
AT THE OTHER ONE WE STOPPED AFTER FOUR METRE 
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THAT THERE AS WELL 
YEAH 
WE DID IT THIS WAY BEFORE 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
CONTINUUM RADIATION 
NO 
ANOTHER 
NARROW LINE REGION EMISSION 
UH DO YOU TH I THINK THAT GOES OUT 
YEAH WE DON'T 
YEP 
UH YEP WHITE DWARFS IS A SOURCE TYPE 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
IT IS 
OH 
KECK IS YEAH 
UH WE DIDN'T ALLOW IRON SPECTRUM 
SO WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW H. OR HELIUM TWO O. SPECTRUM THERE 
YEAH 
SO ELECTRONIC 
YEAH 
RADIO QUASARS ARE S TYPE 
BUT RADIO QUASARS MEANS RADIO LOUD QUASARS 
I. V. ACCESSORS ARE RIGHT ISN'T IT 
IT'S A SPECTRAL FEATURE 
WE WEREN'T DOING FLAT SPECTRUM QUASARS WERE WE 
NO 
WERE WE 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
LINE STRENGTHS 
MEANS EQUIVALENT WIDTHS YEAH 
UH I DID MIS GROUP 
YEP 
HEY 
EXCELLENT

HMM 
THAT'S THE ACTUALLY USUALLY

I G I GUESS KEEP IT THEN 
YEAH I THINK SO 
BLENDED ION LINES YEAH 
YES YOU DO MEAN ION LINES 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH IT'S IF IT HAS 
UH UH 
HYDROGEN OR H HELIUM IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF WHITE DWARFS 
YEAH 
NO THAT'S RIGHT 
THAT ALL GOES 
YEAH 
I GUESS YOU COULD KEEP IT THEN 
YEAH 
BUT IT'S A REGION THOUGH ISN'T IT 
YOU YOU 
THE N. AS WELL 
OH YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
WELL KIND OF IT IT'S UH UH D IF YOU HAD A S SP SPECTRUM 
YOU HAVE ALL THE L LINES OF ACTUALLY LOTS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS AND YOU HAVE TO WORK AT AT ALL THE ONES SP WHICH ARE ION LINES 
THEN AFTER THAT YOU LOOK AND SAY UM UH HAS A LOT OF IN IN IT

IT ISN'T UH A SPECTRAL FEATURE SUCH AS UH IT'S A PROCESS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I THINK IT'S A PROCESS MYSELF 
YEAH 
WELL THAT'S TRUE 
THAT IS TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY OKAY

G. B. H. C. UH 
GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
WAIT FR FROM THE LINGUISTIC SIDE OF YOU IF YOU MARK STAR BURST BEFORE AND IF YOU FEEL THAT STAR BURSTS ARE LIKE OBJECTS 
THEN I THINK IT SH IT SHOULD STAY IN IN THIS CASE EVEN THOUGH IT'S MODIFIED BY ACTIVITY OR IT'S IT'S M MODIFYING ACTIVITY ACTUALLY 
HMM 
SO IS GOO AGAIN OR IS IT REALLY Z. EQUALS TWO 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
MM-HMM 
IF IT WAS RADIO LOUD QUASAR THEN YOU WOULD MARK IT IS ONE THING 
I I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO UM MARK THE WHOLE THING THEN IS NO 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL 
BUT 
UM SO SORRY AND THE THE A. G. N. I THINK THAT SHOULD BE ONE ENTITY RIGHT

MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
HMM 
SORRY WHAT WHAT HAPPENED NOW 
SO YOU YOU IF YOU FIND THAT DWARF AMORPHOUS BLAH BLAH GALAXIES THAT THAT'S NOT A PROPER NAME 
BUT YOU STILL INCLUDE THE ACRONYM 
OR 
OH OKAY 
ALRIGHT OKAY 
I SEE MM-HMM 
HEY WOW 
UNDER TWO HOURS 
AMAZING 
YEAH 
I TH I THINK SO YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I MEAN M MY VIEW ON THIS WAS THAT UM THE END FOR PEOPLE TO BACK UP THEIR DATA PERSONALLY WAS MADE SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR TO LAB USERS 
UM I MEAN I GUESS RIGHT OKAY 
AS LONG AS SHE ADMITS IT THEN THEN THAT'S FINE 
I I'M JUST THINKING YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WHEN THERE'S A A PROCESS ERROR LIKE THAT YOU THINK UH THEN THERE'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD CHANGE 
LIKE MAKE THE SIGN IN BIGGER RED LETTERS 
BUT I IN THE OUR CASE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING MORE WE CAN DO REALLY 
SO UM WELL I DOUBT ANYBODY'LL DO THAT AGAIN 'CAUSE THAT'LL GET AROUND 
SO 
YEAH THERE WAS A MAILING LIST BEFORE 
THEY'VE JUST REVIVED THAT RIGHT 
RIGHT OKAY 
UH-HUH 
RIGHT 
AND WE DON'T KNOW SO THERE'S EVERY CHANCE OF THIS FALLING OVER AGAIN IF IT'S A HARDWARE THING RIGHT 
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT APART FROM 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
WHY IS UH-HUH 
YEAH YEAH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
SO HOW LONG DOES THIS PUT YOU BACK FOR

DO IS THIS A DAY 
TWO DAYS

MM-HMM 
AND I SAW UH A BUNCH OF STUFF ABOUT SOFTWARE UPDATES

UM THE EYE LINK 
I C I DIDN'T READ 'EM 
I SAW LIKE FIVE MESSAGES GO BACK AND FORTH 
MAYBE THEY WERE UNDER THE WRONG SUBJECT HEADER 
SO ANYWAY WE HAVE WELL 
OH NO I MEAN THE EYE LINK SOFTWARE 
SO IT'S UNRELATED IT'S NOT THAT RIGHT 
OKAY GOOD 
UM 
YEAH 
SO UH I UH DID UH GET HIS DATA ON 
OR IS THIS PUT HIS SCHEDULE BACK 
HE'S DONE IT OKAY 
RIGHT 
UM WELL UNFORTUNATE BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE UM YOU GUYS ARE WELL PLACED FOR DEALING WITH IT 
IS BETTER YOU THEN UM 
YEAH 
UH SO YOU NEED TO BORROW SOMEBODY'S HEAD AND MOUTH AND STUFF TO TO RUN IT RIGHT 
AND 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO I'VE GOT A NEW UM TRAINEE WHO MIGHT NEED AMUSEMENT AT SOME POINT 
SO IF YOU NEED TO BORROW A HEAD THAT TALKS THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO DO MUCH ELSE 
I'LL TH I'LL ASK HER IF SHE'D MIND COMING DOWN AND HELPING YOU IT FOR UH A WHILE

UH WHO IS THAT 
OH YEAH HEIDI 
OH YEAH SHE'S GOOD 
YOU GUYS MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON 'CAUSE SHE DOES WELL YOU KNOW STUFF FOR THE VIDEO CODING AND GESTURING 
AND AUTISM 
BUT 
SO OKAY 
OH RIGHT WHAT AM I WRITING 
OH OKAY NYNKE TO VOLUNTEER 
WELL UH IN UH I WILL ACTUALLY GIVE HER THE THE OPTION 
BUT UM IT SOUNDS LIKE THE KIND OF THING WHERE YOU KNOW 
I THINK IT'S QUITE USEFUL WHEN YOU'RE AT THAT STAGE TO USE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES PEOPLE USE 
SO 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OOPS 
WELL YOU FIND THAT THEN 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
SO WE WANT ONE YOU CAN PICK UP USING MATLAB OR SOMETHING RIGHT 
OKAY 
PERFECT

SO OR YOU'RE GONNA BANK THE SCRIPT SOME PLACE AND TELL US HOW TO RUN IT 
UH-HUH 
'CAUSE WE WON'T KNOW 
RIGHT 
WELL THAT ALL SOUNDS GOOD 
OH REALLY 
OH OKAY 
UH-HUH OKAY 
VERY NICE VERY PRETTY 
IT DOESN'T GET IN THE WAY OF SEEING WHAT'S UNDERNEATH 
VERSION ONE 
MM-HMM 
IT'S NOT TOO BAD 
UH-HUH 
I C I CAN I CAN SEE WHERE THAT'S USEFUL 
NO 
JUST CHANGE IT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
ALTHOUGH IF IF YOU HAD A BIG THING AND IT WAS JIGGLING AROUND LIKE ANYBODY'S BUSINESS 
LIKE REAL EYE TRACK TRACES THEN YOU MIGHT FIND THAT A LITTLE BIT DISCONCERTING 
I MEAN SMALL THINGS YOU KIND OF EXPECT TO JIGGLE AROUND RIGHT 
BUT 
IT'LL LOOK LIKE IT'S QUIVERING YOU KNOW 
YEAH BUT WELL THAT'S ALL FINE 
WHAT ELSE 
YOU WERE SAYING JOE WITH THE MODEL BUILDER 
OH REMIND ME 
OH YES 
OKAY 
OH THAT'S GOOD 
OH OKAY 
REALLY 
JUST THE PARALLELOGRAM 
RIGHT 
OKAY SO Y YOUR JOB IN THIS IS IT UM ENSURE THAT IT ACTUALLY IS A BIG AND THEN PASS IT IT J 
OKAY 
THAT MAKES SENSE 
I MEAN TH THIS GEOMETRY STUFF IS REALLY TRICKY IF YOU DON'T DO THE FOLD THE BOXES STUFF ON YOUR HEAD WELL SO I CAN IMAGINE 
'CAUSE I COULD GET IT BACKWARDS EASILY YOU KNOW AND SO IT IS JUST AS WELL FOR WE FOR YOU TO CHECK THIS 
UH-HUH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH SO YOU NEED TO DRAW 'EM IN SOMETHING 
UH SO YEAH I SUGGESTED YOU DO THAT IN X. FIG 
SO THAT A REASONABLE THING TO DO OR NO 
YEP MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO THIS IS THIS FALLS DOWN COMPLETELY IF NIJMEGEN CAN'T RUN X. FIG 
SO YOU BETTER CHECK THAT WITH 'EM RIGHT 
BUT 
OKAY BUT THEY MAY NEED HELP FINDING THE SOMETHING IF THEY CAN'T DO X. FIG I SUPPOSE 
MICROSOFT THOUGH 
I MEAN WELL WHAT KINDS OF 
THEY ARE THE IPOD 
YEAH AND 
UH-HUH 
YEP MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO I WOULDN'T DO ANY ANY WORK TO FIND OUT WHAT'LL OUTPUT S. V. G. 
JUST ASK THEM LIKE YOU KNOW SAY W YOU NEED SOMETHING THAT DOES S. V. G. AND THEN UM IF THEY IF THEY COME BACK AND SAY UH 
THEN YOU YOU MAY NEED TO POODLE AROUND A BIT LOOKING FOR SOMETHING 
BUT UH YOU KNOW LET THEM LET THEM SAY THEY'VE GOT A PROBLEM BEFORE YOU UM SPEND TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'LL DO IT 
'CAUSE 
UH-HUH 
YEAH YEAH 
UH AS WELL I CAN IMAGINE THERE BEING UH SHAPES THAT YOU COULD CONSTRUCT ONE S. V. G. FORMAT THAT WOULD FOX THE MODEL BUILDER IN SOME WAY 
I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE SPECS ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF SHAPES ARE ALLOWED RIGHT 
UM RIGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THEY'RE UM CONVEX OR CONCAVE IN FUNNY WAYS 
YEAH EX 
AND YOU TRIED IT 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
WOULD WE WANT BY SELF INTERSECTION YOU MEAN YOU COULD 
YOU MEAN LIKE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
WELL BUT BY SELF INTERSECTION HERE I'LL DRAW HERE IF I CAN FIND THE RIGHT AND OF THE PEN 
YOU DO YOU MEAN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
A AND YOU CAN RULE OUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT RIGHT 
'CAUSE THAT'S TWO PARTS FOR YOU 
YEAH 
UM I MEAN YOU KNOW SOME F RAINY DAY YOU MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT 
WELL I DON'T KNOW 
I MEAN IT YOU KNOW LATER ON WE CAN FIX IT IF IT IF IT TURNS OUT THOSE PARTS IT'S NOT URGENT NOW 
I THINK THIS ISN'T IMPORTANT ENOUGH 
YEAH 
YEP MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
BUT BUT BUT IF THEY HAVE TROUBLE YOU KNOW HALF AN HOUR GOOGLING AND HELPING HELPING THEM IS PROBABLY WORTHWHILE 
'CAUSE SOMETI SOMETIMES PEOPLE I MEAN IT ACTUALLY I WOULD E I WOULDN'T EXPECT THEM TO HAVE ANY TROUBLE FINDING SOMETHING 'CAUSE J. P. IS QUITE UP WITH ALL THE ALL THESE THINGS 
SO UM ARE THE 
WELL YOU LET'S UM ENCOURAGE THEM INTO IT IS UM ANY SOFTWARE THAT MIGHT HAVE IDIOSYNCRATIC IDEAS ABOUT WHAT S. V. G. S 
SHE SAYS DELICATELY 
I HAVE AN UH THAT I WASN'T GONNA SAY 
I I HAVE AN IDEA WHETHER THEY HAVE IDIOSYNCRATIC S. V. G. OUTPUT OR WHETHER BUT UM THEIR TRACK THEIR TRACK RECORD COULD UH IN SOME OF THE OTHER STANDARDS HAS NOT THERE HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY STRANGE THINGS ABOUT IT 
SO UM BUT IN MY UH YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY SH THAT SHOULD BE OF 
MM-HMM 
UM YEAH 
I HAVEN'T LOOKED THROUGH THEIR EMAIL 
I DID IS SOMETHING FROM MARLOES 
SO THERE ANYTHING THEY'RE WAITING ON FROM IS THAT IS A PROBLEM OR I THEY REASONABLY HAPPY TO THE MOMENT 
UH THEY'VE DONE THE PLATES 
OH GOOD 
DUMPED THE DATA 
WHERE IS IT DUMPED 
B. S. C. W. 
WELL THAT'S OKAY 
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT USING THAT MUCH SPACE IF IT'S JUST FOR INTERIM 
AND THEY HAVE TO GET TO TO USE SOME WAY 
UM UH WE HAD A UH BRIEF DISCUSSION JUST BEFORE I LEFT BUT UH THIS IDEA OF EXCHANGING DATA BY FIRE WIRE DRIVE AND I D I DON'T KNOW IF THAT EVER GOT RESOLVED 
BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR LITTLE THINGS LIKE THIS 
SO I THINK B. S. C. W. IS THE RIGHT WAY TO EXCHANGE THESE 
WE JUST HAVE TO WIPE THIS STUFF OFF AND KEEP SEPARATE COPIES AFTER THAT 
THE C. V. S. 
UH SO YOU'RE MANAGING THAT OKAY AND YOU HAVEN'T RUN INTO C. V. S. BEFORE 
OKAY 
WELL GOOD 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
WELL THAT'S THAT'S REASSURING 
COURSE HE'S SITTING ON THE NEXT DESK 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WELL SHE'LL HAVE TO U USE THE C. V. S. EVENTUALLY 'CAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD WAY OF DOING THIS OTHERWISE 
BUT 
MM-HMM 
WELL THAT'S IT WE'LL NEVER SEE HIM HERE AGAIN 
WATCH I'LL FIND OUT HE'S GOT A BETTER COMPUTER AT HOME AS WELL RIGHT 
RIGHT AND WHAT ABOUT UM THE PROJECT IS A WHILE 
SO THERE ANYTHING THAT RED OR ANYBODY IS AFTER THAT WE AREN'T SUPPLYING 
NOT AT THE MOMENT RIGHT 
THEY'RE THEY'RE CRITICAL THE AT THE SUCCESS OF A PROJECT 
SO 
YOU UH YEAH AND GENERAL PLACES 
BUT YEAH I WOULDN'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT UNLESS THEY ASK YOU FOR SPECIFIC INPUT 
YEAH 
THAT'S WHAT'S CIRCULATING 
UH-HUH 
OH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
AND JOHN'S GOING 
MM-HMM 
OH THAT'S GOOD 
HE'LL BE USEFUL FOR THE W. P. SEVEN STUFF 
SO 
WELL WHILE YOU DO THAT I'LL BE TRAINED ON HOW TO HIRE PEOPLE 
SO 
UH BOTH 
SO 
SO SO THERE ANYTHING ELSE 
WHAT HAVE YOU GET ONE FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK BESIDES GETTING THIS STUFF UP AND RUNNING AGAIN 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
SO ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT IT THAT I SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IT OR YOU HAPPY WITH IT 
I MEAN I SORT OF WRITE THE INITIAL DRAFT OF IT I SUPPOSE 
SO 
UM UH SLOWER 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
UM I'LL HAVE TO LOOK 
I CAN'T REMEMBER UM HOW THIS WORKS NOW 'CAUSE IT WAS A WHILE AGO 
SO 
YEAH AND YOU'LL GET NOTHING BACK UNLESS I LIKE IT IT RIGHT 
SO I BEST FOR FOR US FOR ME TO DO THAT 
I I M YEAH I I MEAN IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT YOU'RE YOU UM PUTTING THINGS OUT FOR FOR REVIEW AND SAYING LIKE WHY FOR STUFF 
BUT UM WE DON'T WE ALSO DON'T WANT ME TO BURN TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME RECORDING STUFF THAT THAT NOBODY'S EVER GONNA LOOK AT NECESSARILY 
SO I MEAN THIS THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD CASE FOR OUR IT MIGHT UH OR IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU SHOULD JUST LIKE YOU KNOW 
TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS STUFF IF I HAPPEN TO BE AROUND TO THE TIME THAT YOU'RE DOING IT AND NOT YOU SEE I IF THE WRITING STUFF DOWN ON THE WIKI GETS TO BE TOO HIGH A PROPORTION OF THINGS 
THEN THEN YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANNA DO IT 
YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
THE SO UM I TH I THINK IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE RECORDS AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT 
ESPECIALLY IN ONE BIG DISPERSED GROUPS BUT THIS IS KIND OF A SMALLER GROUP 
UM SO IT YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THINGS MORE INFORMALLY WHERE IF YOU FEEL THE WIKIS ARE GETTING IN THE WAY OF THINGS 
SO 
OH YEAH IT WELL IF IT DOES YOU IN THINKING TO WRITE IT DOWN THEN DEFINITELY WRITE IT DOWN 
'CAUSE YEAH WE WANT CLEAR THINKING 
UM I CAN'T ACTUALLY REMEMBER UH I HOW IT WORKED WITH THE THE MOULDS 
I MEAN I W I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT UM 
NO I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER 
SO I'LL I'LL LOOK AT IT 
UH BUT UH I'M SURE IT'S FINE 'CAUSE UM IT'S JUST MY MEMORY OF THINGS 
OH YEAH UH-HUH 
YEAH 
SO UM SO THAT GONNA HAVE A VOICE OVER OR IS IT WE HAD DISCUSSIONS BEFORE YOU STARTED ABOUT WHETHER IT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY SILENT SO THAT THEY COULD USE IN CASE WE EVER WANTED TO DO THIS ONE IN DUTCH 
YEAH 
AND UH AND SO YOU KNOW 
YOU COULD JUST HAVE SORT OF WELL TH I THINK WE DISCUSSED HAVING IT WITH AN ENGLISH VOICE OVER ARE HAVING IT WITH AN VOICE OVER AND THEN HAVING TO WE JUST WITH CARTOON NOISES OR SOMETHING LIKE OR YOU KNOW WHEN THINGS BREAK 
SO TO EMPHASISE THE I MAY BE IMAGINING IT 
UH SO WE COULD PRODUCE A DUTCH VOICE OVER FOR THE SAME THING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY THE THE THE OTHER ISSUE IS UM UH I IF WE DO A VOICE OVER UH DOES THAT AFFECT THE LANGUAGE THAT THE PEOPLE CHOOSE TO USE 
SO SO THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER REASON FOR NOT DOING THAT 
ALIGNMENT OR YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
SO I THINK MAYBE THAT WAS ANOTHER REASON FOR ME JUST HAVING 
OR OR ARE DOING FOR YOU KNOW YOU GET IT OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
WELL THAT YOU 
YEAH 
WELL YOU NEED SOME WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY NOTICE THE THING YOU'RE TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THEM IF THERE'S NO VOICE UH 
OR OR YOU COULD JUST POINT TO YOU KNOW HAV BE GREAT BIG ARROW THAT POINTS AT THE TWO PIECES THAT BREAK 
YOU KNOW AND 
YEAH 
SO YOU GONNA CLEAR OR OR HOWEVER YOU DO THIS WITH ELLEN RIGHT 
'CAUSE SHE'S THE ON THAT HAS THOUGHTS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE AND STUFF 
UH WELL REMIN REMIND HER THAT THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THERE OUGHTA BE ONE 
MM-HMM 
I BET MARLOES JUST TALKED TO 'EM 
UH I THINK IT'S REALLY UP TO USE IT 
SO TOO HARD 
YOU DON'T WANNA GIVE 'EM THE SPECIFICATION YOU KNOW 'CAUSE THAT'S ONE TOO HIGH FALUTIN A LANGUAGE 
BUT UM UH I IT CAN'T BE THAT HARD TO GENERATE SOMETHING THAT SAYS 
MM-HMM 
UH UM UH IN MY HOLIDAYS WE ENCOUNTERED A CHILDREN'S TOYSHOP WHERE THERE WE THERE WERE TAMGRAMS 
AND MY SON REMINDED ME THAT HE CA HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND HIS TAMGRAM SET IN A WHILE 
WELL UH IF NOT IF YOU GUYS ARE USING IT 
OR DO YOU DO YOU FIND IT HELPFUL TO HAVE TO 
UH BUT IT'S SO TACTILE TO HAVE THE LITTLE METAL BITS 
IF YOU IF YOU'RE USING TO KEEP IT 
HE'S GOT PLENTY OF TOYS 
IF YOU'RE NOT IF YOU'RE NOT USING IT THEN I'LL TAKE IT BACK 
YEAH Y IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A WORRY 
THE THE LAD HAS PLENTY OF TOYS 
OH SIMILAR TYPES UH-HUH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
SO UM HOW YOU GONNA GET YOUR COMPLEXITY RATINGS 
GOOGLE 
SO THERE A BIG TAMGRAM COMMUNITY THAT RANKS THESE THINGS 
LIKE YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST ONE BOOKLET THAT CAME WITH ONE SET OF TAMGRAMS 
OR OR IS IT OBVIOUS LIKE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE THINGS 
YEAH 
BUT THAT STILL WON'T TELL YOU WILL HOW MANY TAMGRAMS ARE THERE THAT THEY'RE USING 
FIFTEEN OR SOMETHING 
NO NOT EVEN 
UH-HUH 
SO THAT'S NOT GONNA GO SO THAT'S NOT GONNA TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT RELATIVE COMPLEXITY 
THAT'S JUST GONNA TELL YOU WHERE IN THE SPAN YOU WANNA BE 
YOU STILL NEED SOME KINDA SCALE FOR THESE THINGS 
C UH IF YOU LOOK AT 'EM DO YOU JUST KNOW 
NO 
I WOULD THERE 
WHAT ABOUT HIM 
I IF UH MISTER GEOMETRY 
I MEAN YOU KNOW 
CAN YOU TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT THIS HOW HARD PEOPLE FIND THEM 
OR RIGHT OKAY 
WELL 
WHO IS PSYCHOLOGY ALREADY USES TAMGRAMS THAT'S STILL AROUND 
MEAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING TAMGRAMS FOR AGES 
SO THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY WITH A FOLK WISDOM YOU CAN CONTACT 
RIGHT 
I ONLY KNOW ANCIENT PAPERS 
SO LIKE LATE EIGHTIES 
DO PEOPLE STILL USE TAMGRAMS 
OH 
SO WE'RE VERY OLD FASHIONED 
WELL THERE WAS STUFF ON THE SEVENTIES AND THE EIGHTIES RIGHT 
SO SINCE THEN 
RIGHT 
WELL THE OLD THE OLD TASKS ARE THE BEST 
SO I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT WORRY ME 
UM 
SO UH SORRY THAT WAS K I THINK A BIG DIVERSION 
AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE GONNA DO NEXT AFTER ALL THIS STUFF WAS UP AND THE I WAS GONNA LOOK AT THE G. D. F. SPEC 
OR THE REST OF THE YOU UH OR IS THE REST OF WHAT YOU'RE TO DO WITH THAT SOFTWARE FAIRLY CLEAR 
'CAUSE THIS IS ABOUT THE ANALYSIS 
YOU REALLY ONLY NEED ROBIN RIGHT TO TO SPECIFY THE REST 
UH-HUH 
YEP MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 'CAUSE THERE WERE ALL THESE ISSUES ABOUT HOW YOU CALCULATE EYE EYE LAG AND YOU KNOW 
W WHAT OTHER THE ANALYSIS WE WANT O WANT OUT OF THOSE THAT AREN'T SETTLED 
BUT I THINK UM YOU KNOW ROBIN IS THE PERSON WHO KNOWS THE MOST ABOUT WHAT'S REQUIRED THERE 
AND I CAN IMAGINE IT'S GONNA TAKE A WEE WHILE TO I CAN IMAGINE YOU KNOW 
SO THAT MIGHT BE THE FOCUS OF DISCUSSIONS NEXT WEEK OR SOMETHING RIGHT THAT UM WHAT AND OUT OF THIS AND 
YEAH SO YOU MIGHT WANNA TRY AND COME 
IF YOU GET THAT FOR 
TRY AND COME EQUIPPED WITH A LIST OF THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU WANT TO IF IT AND AND SO WE CAN LOOK THROUGH AND SO 
UM UH Y ELLEN MIGHT HAVE VIEWS ON WHAT KINDS OF THINGS ONCE WE HAVE A LIST RIGHT 
SO SO YEAH 
SO BUT IT'D BE GOOD TO YOU KNOW 
MAKE SURE ONCE WE HAVE A LIST OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK WE'RE GETTING OF IT THAT IT MATCHES HER INTENTIONS FOR WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GET OUT OF IT 
SO UM YOU KNOW IF WE DO TALK ABOUT THAT THEN IT MIGHT BE NICE TO HAVE HERE ALONG FOR IT 
OH YEAH 
OH YEAH 
WHO IS THAT THEN 
'KAY 
UM ARE THEY STILL IN THE BUSINESS 
WHERE ARE THEY 
OKAY 
WELL THEY MIGHT HAVE THE FOLK WISDOM ON THE COMPLEXITY RIGHT 
SO NINETY TWO'S NOT THAT LONG AGO 
WELL IT IS REALLY 
BUT 
UM SO IT A PAPER YOU CAN GET 
WELL THEY STILL DO IT FOR LIBRARY LOANS AND STUFF SO 
UH-HUH YEP 
SO DO WE THINK NEXT WEEK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT 
'CAUSE WE WANT WANNA ASK ELLEN AHEAD OF TIME IF SHE WANTS TO COME ALONG FOR A DISCUSSION ABOUT UH WELL THAT'S THAT'S FINE THEN 
OKAY 
OH YEAH C SHE 'CAUSE SHE HER STUFF IS GETTING BLOCKED OFF THE MAILING LIST 'CAUSE SHE'S NOT MAILING FROM HER NORMAL ACCOUNT 
YEAH 
AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT ANY WAY TO JUST APPROVE MESSAGES FROM HER WITHOUT HER SUBSCRIBING AT THAT ACCOUNT 
SO 
UM 
THERE'S ONLY ONE MESSAGE AS FAR 
IT DIDN'T SAY MUCH 
OH 
YEP 
ANYTHING ELSE 
YEAH 
B I DON'T THINK THAT LIST IS OUR FINAL WORD ON THINGS AND 
UH WELL MAYBE IT IS THEN 
I 
UH-HUH 
I DON'T THINK I WAS FULLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT 
I MEAN I'M NOT GONNA HAVE VIEWS ON THIS ANYWAY 
WHAT I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IS MAKING SURE THAT UM THERE'S NOT BIG SURPRISES FOR ELLEN AND AND J. P. YOU KNOW 
WHEN THEY SUDDENLY DISCOVER THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE ASSUMING SOME ANALYSIS IS IN THERE AND WE DIDN'T DIDN'T PUT IT IN 
YOU KNOW 
'CAUSE NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO BE FIGURING OUT WHAT WE WANT OUT OF THAT DATA AND AND GETTING YOU WRITE THE STUFF OR GETTING J. P. TO WRITE THE ONE DIMENSIONAL ANALYSES THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
SO 
OH RIGHT 
OKAY 
SO YOU ACTUALLY YOU'RE BREAKING THIS DOWN INTO TWO STEPS NOW 
ONE IS JUST A STRAIGHT EXTRACTION FROM THE ASCII AND THE OTHER ONE IS ANY POST ANALYSIS THAT THAT ADDS INFORMATION BY ANALYSING IT 
SO THAT THE 
YEAH IT'S JUST ANYTHING THAT'S GOT SHOVED THROUGH THE EYE TRACKER 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY THAT IS POST ANALYSIS 
YEAH 
SO RIGHT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UH WELL THAT ALL SOUNDS GOOD 
SO 
I'VE GOT O UH ONE THING TO CHECK AND ONE PERSON TO ASK IF SHE'LL VOLUNTEER TO BE A HEAD 
AND SO FAR AS I KNOW THAT'S IT FOR ME 
SO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN 
I'M FOR FOR ONE OF MY OTHER THINGS I THERE IS NOW A SPECIFIC WIKI PAGE THAT SAYS STUFF JEAN HAS TO DO 
AND I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT THIS IS QUITE A GOOD IDEA 'CAUSE I WORRY ABOUT NOT DOING THE STUFF PEOPLE EXPECT OF UM 
MUCH MORE THAN THE OTHER WAY AROUND RIGHT 
WHAT DOCUMENTATION 
OH OKAY 
WELL IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE ITS WAY INTO ITS MY SALARY I'M AFRAID 
SO 
BUT YEAH 
I MEAN I DO SPEND TIME TALKING TO YOU GUYS 
SO YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF UM 
OH YEAH 
SO WE'VE MOVED OVER AND NOT THE OTHER EYE LINK 
SO UH 'CAUSE SHE'S RUNNING OUT THE MOMENT 
SHE DID ADMIT IT 
YES 
UH-HUH 
HMM 
NO 
BUT UM 
YES 
SHOCK AND WORRY TOO UH I THINK YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S A MAILING LIST UH AND MM-HMM YEAH 
UH F FRANK WENT THROUGH IT DELETED THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HAVE GONE OR OR WHATEVER AND REPLACED THEM 
SO THE THE YOU THE THE LAST SO NOW UPDATED 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES UH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
YEAH 
WE'RE DOING A BIT 
SO LAST WEEK BY THE TIME EVERYTHING AND AND THEN IT'LL BE HOPEFULLY NO MORE THAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TWENTY MINUTES TODAY IT 
HMM 
YEP 
I I YEAH 
YOU MEAN FROM WAS THAT J 
OR IS THAT 
UM THERE WAS NOTHING NOTHING OVER LAST WEEK 
JOE HAS UH PRODUCED ANOTHER VERSION OF THE UH MODEL BUILDER AND PUT THAT UP 
UH WELL THAT WE THAT WAS RUUD WELL A FEW WEEKS AGO 
BUT YEAH 
YEP IT'S UNRELATED 
AND WAS OUR WAS RUNNING 
'CAUSE FRANK DID ALL THAT BECAUSE UH THEN HAD AN EXPERIMENT 
SO HE'S RUN AN EXPERIMENT AND IT'S ALL WORKED 
UH HE'S HE'S DONE HIS AND GET HIS AND YES 
AND HE BACKS UP ANYWAY 
MAYBE IT WELL PLACED YEAH 
YEP 
WH A SPARE HEAD 
OR UH YES BUT SHE'S NOT AROUND 
SO UH 
NYNKE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
WELL I DID MEET UH UH UH UH SOMEONE FROM ANOTHER PROJECT OF YOURS ON WEDNESDAY EVENING IT WAS 
HEI HEIDI WHO IS THE GESTURE OF AUTISM 
YEAH MM-HMM 
MM YEP 
AND AUTISM YEAH 
YES 
SH SHE'S BEEN VOLUNTEERED 
YEP MAKE SURE IT UH IT STARTS AND FINISHES WHEN IT'S MEANT TO AND THAT SORT OF THING AS WELL 
MM-HMM 
UH YEP 
OH YES WITH THE UM THE BLEEP WAS A HARDWARE BLEEP ORIGINALLY 
AND SO IT COMES FROM THE P. C. WHICH IS OUTSIDE THE SOUND PROOF BOX 
YES 
UH MM-HMM 
IT COMES THROUGH THE 
YEAH YEP 
MM-HMM 
NO 
UH UM WHAT ELSE 
YOU HAVE ALTERED THE UM TASK PROGRAMME BECAUSE UH TO PUT THE UM LITTLE YOU CAN AND THE MOUSE UH TO MAKE IT 
RATHER THAN JUST A BLOB UH ELLEN WANTED SOMETHING TO LOOK MORE LIKE AN EYE IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE EYE 
THERE WAS LIKE YEAH MM-HMM 
WANT TO A REASONABLE SIZE IS THAT IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT WE KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT THOUGH 
SO YOU HAS TO BE A A REASONABLE TARGET UH FOR THE FOR THE TRACKING PURPOSES 
MM-HMM 
WITH LARGE MM YEAH I SUPPOSE THE LARGER MORE OSCILLATION APPEARS THAT UM IT'S NOT W I MEAN UH IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T THAT BIG 
SO YEAH 
OH YES HE'S PRODUCED IN ANOTHER VERSION THAT DOESN'T UH HAVE THE OVERLAP PROBLEM 
YOU KNOW THERE WAS THE YEAH THE COLLISIONS 
THE POLYGONS NOW DON'T OVERLAP 
UM MARLOES DISCOVERED SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THE ORIENTATION OF PARALLELOGRAMS FROM WHEN IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OUT WHEN IT APPEARS IN THE UM ACTUAL TASK 
BUT I THINK THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION THAN THE PARTS THAT WEREN'T THE SAME ACROSS THE TWO 
SO I'LL CHECK THAT IT UH TO SEE IF IT REALLY IS A PROBLEM OR NOT 
AND BASICALLY THE PARALLELOGRAM WAS APPEARING IN A SORT OF US A MIRROR IMAGE OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THE UH MODEL BUILDER IN THE ACTUAL YEAH 
JUST TOTAL IT FLIPPED UH IN IN A MIRROR IMAGE 
NOT ROTATED 
SO IT WASN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH ROTATION 
IT WAS F YEAH JUST THE PARALLELOGRAM 
SO UH ENTIRELY SURE 
MUST BE SOME WAY OF HOW THE VERTICES WERE DESCRIBED OR UH DEFINED IN ONE WAY OR COMPARED TO SOMETHING ELSE 
JOE YEP 
WELL UH MM-HMM 
YES 
UH THE OTHER THING WE'VE DONE IS UH LOOKED AT N NOT UH FOR THIS CURRENT EXPERIMENT BUT FOR FUTURE 
WHEN WE'VE GOT TO BUILD UM BIZARRE PARTS LIKE AIR CRAFT WINGS AND AND THINGS 
UH SOMETHING LIKE X. FIG UH CAN OUTPUT THE VERTEX POINTS UM FOR CREATING THE OR THE ACTUAL POLYGONS IN THE FIRST PLACE 
'CAUSE THE MODEL BUILDER UM ASSUMES THAT THERE'S AN EXISTING SET OF OF ORIGINAL PARTS 
SO YOU NEED TO DRAW THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE 
SO 
IT IT I YES 
WE OR SOMETHING I I UH UH 
YEAH 
SO IT MUST BE A SOME SORT OF PINK PACKAGE 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM ANYWAY 
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH BEFORE JOE DISAPPEARS JUST CHECKING THAT THE MODEL BUILDER'S NOT RESTRICTED TO JUST DOING THE TAMGRAMS 
OR SOMETHING TH YOU KNOW 
SO UH ON IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S UH M. S. N. 
UM NO BUT AS LONG AS THEY'RE SOLID POLYGONS IT SHOULD BE ALRIGHT 
OH NO IT SH WELL UH UH HOPEFULLY THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PARALLELOGRAM PROBLEM IS 
BECAUSE IT IT DOES HAVE SORT OF SOME OF ANGLES AND THINGS 
BUT UH ONE AS FAR AS UH I MEAN IT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OR PART OF IT WAS CONVEX 
YEAH 
I Y YEAH BUT THAT'S WHY UH WE NO WE'LL ONLY BE WORKING SO I SAY WITH SORT OF SOLID OBVIOUS POLYGONS AND AS PARTS 
'CAUSE THEY'LL HAVE THEY'LL HAVE TO HAVE A CENTRAL POINT ANYWAY FOR FOR ROTATION AND AND GRABBING 
BUT 
MM-HMM 
WELL UH UH REALISE WHAT WE'RE I WOULD CONSIDER THAT TWO PARTS YEP 
YEAH 
YEP 
THE LAST POINT AT THE YEAH 
YEP 
YES YEAH 
J. P. IS QUITE YEAH UH-HUH 
YES 
THE MICROSOFT VERSION OF S. V. G. OR SOMETHING 
YES UH-HUH 
I HAVE AN IDEA THERE 
OH 
NOPE 
UH I THINK THEY'VE UM THEY'RE NOT WAITING ANYTHING FROM US 
UH THEY'VE DUMPED THE PILOT THE PILOT STUDIES THAT THEY GENERATED BASED ON THE TASK WITH THEIR ENGLISH PARTICIPANTS OR ENGLISH SPEAKING PARTICIPANTS 
YEAH 
UH BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WITH AT OTHER THAN DUMP THE DATA 
UH THEY WILL THEY DUMPED IT IN THE MM B. S. C. C. W. SERVER 
BUT I'VE MOVED WELL I HAVEN'T MOVED IT I'VE COPIED IT INTO THE C. S. V. YEAH 
YEP 
NOTHING FURTHER SO 
NO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OH 
AND I'VE UH SENT A THING OFF TO MARLOES TALK TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HER AGAIN TO REGISTER FOR THE C. S. V. AND UH AND WHAT TO THE C. V. S. AND UH WHA WHAT TO DO AND UH WHICH BIT OF SOFTWARE I SEE THAT SEEMS TO BE QUITE EASY AND SIMPLE 
YEP 
NOPE 
WELL YES AND ONE IS AN YES IT'S NOW AND NO I HAVEN'T GOT A PROBLEM 
YEP 
UH AS FAR 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
UH Y YES 
UH AND I AM JUST USING IT THROUGH UM A WINDOWS BOLT IN SORT OF PIECE OF SOFTWARE 
YEAH 
NO I'VE JUST YEAH STRAIGHT FORWARD AND THEN YOU JUST RIGHT RIGHT YEAH OR AND RIGHT CLICK THINGS IN IN WINDOWS EXPLORER 
THAT'S IT 
MM-HMM 
IN A DAY LIKE THIS I KNOW IT'S A YEAH 
MM NO 
NOT AT THE MOMENT 
THE ONLY THING THAT'S BEEN GOING ROUND IS THE VERSION OF THE FLOOR 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT REAL PURPOSE OF UH THIS LITTLE FOLDED UP A. FOUR FLIERS 
UH THERE'S BEEN BIT OF UH ARE THEY JUST FOR DISTRIBUTION AT CONFERENCES AND THINGS 
OR DO THEY UH 
RIGHT 
WELL I I'M NOT REALLY BOTHERING 
BUT IT THERE'S THAT'S WHAT'S CIRCULATING AROUND THE THE GROUP IS A WHILE TO THE MOMENT 
UM I'VE SORTED OUT UH TRAVEL ET CETERA TO MUNICH FOR E FOR ELLEN JOHN AND MYSELF 
AND WE'RE ALL OFF IN THE FOURTEENTH OF DECEMBER 
COMING BACK IN THE FRIDAY 
THE SIXTEENTH YES 
THAT'S A SO THAT'S HOW IT HERE OR HOW TO INTERVIEW IS THAT THAT UH BOOK 
THE 
SPEND 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL MM-HMM 
UH WHAT EL UH WELL I'LL HAVE TO GET IT GRIPS WITH CRA CAMTASIA UH PROPERLY UH TO GENERATE A LITTLE SORT OF INTRODUCTORY VIDEO I SUPPOSE UH FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPERIMENT 
SO PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO USE UH AND SO THAT THE P YOU KNOW EXAMPLE MOVEMENTS UH AND THINGS LIKE THAT WILL BE 
IN DUTCH AS WELL 
UM WELL 
OH RIGHT 
OH 
HUH 
RIGHT 
UH IN THAT MUST HAVE BEEN BEFORE UM 
SO UH UH UH UP TO 
I 
SEPARATED 
YES MM-HMM 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
EXA YEAH 
SO TH I MEAN TH I DON'T THINK I THINK IT'D BE MORE SENSIBLE JUST TO DO THE NON THE THE VIDEO PART OF IT FIRST AND THEN YOU DID THE VOICE OVER AFTERWARDS 
RATHER THAN TRYING TO DO ALL AT ONCE 
YOU KNOW 
MIGHT SEE 
OR OR YOU GOING TO PRIME THEM IN ANY WAY 
DOING UH ANYTHING WITH THE VOICE YOU KNOW 
IF YOU START TALKING ABOUT HAVE TO AVOID OR UH YEAH TALKING ABOUT THE PARTS ARE JUST NAMING THEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
MM-HMM 
BEF YES 
OKAY 
OR DID NO NO NO NOISE IN FACT I THINK SO PROBABLY UH YES 
UH PRO PROBABLY ACTUALLY NOT EVEN THE SOUND EFFECTS 'CAUSE OTHERWISE THEY'LL EXPECT THAT IN THE REAL EXPERIMENT AND THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN 
SO IF THEY MAKE MOVE A PIECE AND IT BREAKS AND THEY DON'T HEAR THIS CRASH AND THEY GO UH WHAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED 
SO THAT REALLY ALL WHAT HAPPENED 
YEAH IT'S UH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES I THINK IT CAN GENERATE UH THINGS 
UH-HUH 
YES 
MM MM-HMM YEAH 
YES BUT UH ARE IN OUR DISCUSSION WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED UH IT WAS ASSUMED THERE'D BE A VOICE OVER 
BUT I'LL I'LL I BETTER I'LL I'LL REMIND HER YEAH I'LL I'LL I'LL DO THAT 
MM-HMM 
YES 'CAUSE WE'VE GOT TO THINK OF THE INSTRUCTIONS AND SORT OF BASIC INTRODUCTION TO TO ALL AS WELL 
SO 
ACTUALLY I I DID EMAIL NIJMEGEN TO ASK IF THEY'D HAD A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS THEY'D GIVEN THEIR PARTICIPANTS 
BUT IT PROBABLY I SEE I SUSPECT SO BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD A REPLY BACK 
YEAH IT TO UH IT WAS JUST IN CASE THEY HAD SOMETHING THAT WHAT 
MM-HMM 
NO THAT SHOULD BE A PROBLEM 
I'LL BE STRAIGHT FORWARD ENOUGH I THINK 
ALRIGHT YOU WANT TAKE IT BACK 
UM UH UH TO UH IN UM THE IT'S NOT GET IT'S UH YEAH IT'S I WILL BE ACTUALLY I COULD PROBABLY JUST PHOTO COPY THE MANUAL 
AND THERE'S ONLY A 
UM YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
UH UH I'VE HOPEFULLY WELL I WON'T HOPEFULLY NEED TO FOR MORE THAN ANOTHER WEEK OR TWO ANYWAY 
SO AS LONG AS YOU CAN HOLD OFF HAS NO NO 
RIGHT 
UM I I WAS LOOKING AT THE THE COMPLEXITY SORT OF UH ASPECT OF THE TAMGRAMS IN THAT UH BOOKLET 
IT'S NOT QUITE THAT THEY JUST GET HARDER 
IT'S THAT THEY KIND OF HAVE PAGES OF SIMILAR UM TYPES 
YEAH 
SO ONE PAGE WILL HAVE SORT OF PARTS THAT ARE KIND OF SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER AND THEN YOU MOVE OVER AND THERE'S A DIFFERENT ALMOST TYPE OF DESIGN OR STYLE 
UH SO IT'S NOT QUITE AS PROGRESSIVE IN COMPLEXITY AS UH 
GOOGLE 
MM-HMM 
UH I'LL TRY I'LL TRY 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S OUT THERE 
WELL UH UM I'M HOPING THE DUTCH INPUT WILL ALLOW US TO P SORT OF HAVE A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT WAS THE OF A SUITABLE COMPLEXITY FOR THE TASK 
OH NO NOT EVEN THAT 
THEY'VE OF THIS RELEVANT TYPE OUT WHAT WE'RE WANTING IT IS PROBABLY THERE 
OH WE'VE TO GENERATE SIXTEEN IN TOTAL 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IDEALLY 
MM NO 
WELL I DON'T 
I'M NOT 
UH I'LL TR I'LL TRY THE GOOD OLD GOOGLE AND SO IF THERE IS UH IF THERE ARE SOME SORT OF RANKING SITES OR WHATEVER 
OH 
I'LL TRY AND FIND OUT 
I DON'T KNOW OFF OFF HAND CERTAINLY 
UH I'LL I'LL DO A SEARCH 
B UM I'VE NOT ENCOUNTERED THEM 
MM WELL OR MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T SEE MM ANYTHING LIKE THAT I SUPPOSE FOR 
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF ANYTHING'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN 
MM-HMM 
SO LITTLE IS IT IS BUT YEAH 
YEAH 
YES 
HAVE TO 
TO TRY AND YES AND HOME HOME IN PARAMETERS AND CHOOSE THE RIGHT SORT OF SETTINGS 
SO YEP 
I'M SURE SHE'LL HAVE VIEWS ON IT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM UH I FOUND HAVEN'T FOUNT IT PHYSICALLY YET BUT UH A REFERENCE TO UH A NINETY TWO PAPER 
IT'S IN THE ROYAL PROCEEDINGS OF SOMETHING OR THREE SOMEWHERE BASED ON A UM AN EXPERIMENT THAT HAD BLOCKS A MODEL 
BLOCKS OF PARTS AND THEN AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE HAD TO BUILD YOU KNOW REPLICATE THE MODEL IT WITH THE PARTS 
UH JUST ONE PERSON TO A TIME OF COURSE 
BUT UH IT DID INVOLVE UM EYE MOVEMENTS AND MONITORING WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING COMPARED TO OTHER HAND MOVEMENTS AND UH THAT SUBJECT 
BALLARD 
BACK IN NINETY TWO 
YES I THINK SO 
UH THE I'LL MM NOT SURE 
YEP 
YEAH 
SO THERE SHOULD STILL BE WILL NOT THAT ONE 
SO IT 
Y UH-HUH 
OH THAT'S WHAT I'VE UM I'LL HAVE TO TRY AND FIND OUT 
UH HMM 
IF NOT UM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IS BOUND TO HAVE TO 
SHE'S NOT HERE NEXT WEEK ANYWAY 
IT'S NEXT WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY BEFORE SHE'S BACK 
UH SO THAT WHAT YEAH SHE'S GOT A MM YAHOO ACCOUNT OR SOMETHING THAT THINGS ARE GETTING FORWARDED TO AND 
OH 
OR OR UH WELL 
THAT'S ONLY OF THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING THROUGH 
OH 
UM ANYTHING ELSE 
WELL CERTAINLY 
TH TH THERE'S THE PROVISIONAL LIST OF WHAT WE NEED ON THE WIKI ANYWAY THAT I PUT IT UP 
SO 
MM-HMM 
UM WELL I I ADDED THINGS TO IT 
WELL BETTER UH WELL I DON'T KNOW WHEN HE LAST LOOKED AT IT 
BUT UH OR WHEN I ADDED TO 
IT WAS SOMETIME IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS ANYWAY 
BUT UH 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GETTING 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IT 
IT'S THE IT'S THE DYNAMIC REGIONS THAT UH I THINK MIGHT CAUSE A BIT OF TROUBLE 
BUT UH 
THAT FILTER MM YEAH FILTER OUT 
UNLESS YOU 
YEP I THINK SO 
TO DO 
HMM 
WATCH OUT WELL I THINK ACCORDING TO THE LATEST DOCUMENTATION UH YOU'RE DOWN FOR FIVE PERCENT OF YOUR FIFTEEN MONTHS ON THIS PROJECT OR SOMETHING 
SOME B UH JAST REPORT 
OFFICIALLY 
INTO REALITY UH-HUH 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH WE'LL GO WE'VE GOT THE MAILING LISTS OUT NOW ISN'T ISN'T IT 
SO IT'S EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT NOW 
YEAH 
SO IS EVERYONE IN THAT LIST HAS NOW BEING REMINDED 
YEAH DON'T STORE ANYTHI ANYTHING SENSITIVE ON YEAH DON'T STORE ANYTHING YOU YOU CARE ABOUT IN THE MACHINES 
SO 
YEAH WITH THE YEAH I MEAN I D I D I DID DO HARD DRI HARD DRIVE CHECK UM AND A MEMORY CHECK 
AND IT SAYS THERE'S NO UH THERE'S NO PROBLEMS BUT SOMETHING CAUSED IT TO GO WRONG ON THE FIRST PLACE 
SO WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW 
WE'LL JUST FINGERS CROSSED AND HIP UH YEAH HO HOPE THAT ALL THIS IS JUST A SOFTWARE THING THAT WE CAN JUST FIX LIKE THAT AND THAT'LL BE TOO 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S SO WHAT WE YEAH NO NO FOR ONE 
NO WE'LL TRY AND GET DONE TODAY YEAH GET GET WINDOWS BACK IN THERE 
TRY AND GET CAMTASIA IN THERE AND GET THAT TESTED OUT 
AND THEN THAT WILL BE I THINK THAT'S EVERYTHING WE NEED F BEFORE WE CAN BEFORE YOU CAN START RUNNING THE EXPERIMENTS ISN'T IT 
SO 
YEP 
YEP 
YEP YEP 
UH BUT UH YEAH 
NO I HAVE TO MANAGE TO GET TO THINGS WORKING ON ON MONDAY 
SO THAT THAT EVERYTHING WENT DOWN LIKE IN THE TUESDAY MORNING 
UM SO MY UM I SHOULD GET EVERYTHING WORKING ON THE UM YEAH ON MONDAY 
SO SURE THAT THE J. C. T. IS ACTUALLY WORKING COLLABORATING COLLABORATING BETWEEN THE TWO MACHINES 
UM I HAD DINNER I WASN'T ACTUALLY AT DINNER BUT I DO HAVE THE EYE TRACKER STUFF WORKING 'CAUSE IT WAS JUST UM RUNNING ROUN RUNNING AROUND THE LAB 
UM STILL HAVE TO ONCE IT'S RE INSTALLED HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO A PROPER P YEAH OF PROPER PILOT AND YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT UM BUT IT L IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS DOING ALL THE CALIBRATION AND DRIFT CORRECTION THINGS THAT S ELLEN WAS WANTING ON IT 
SO SO THAT DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO ADD TO THE SOFTWARE FOR THAT PART 
UM 
DON'T THINK SO 
MM 
DON'T SEE DON'T SOUND DON'T SOUND FAMILIAR 
YEAH 
YEAH SO I'LL TRY AND TRY AND GET CAMTASIA UP AND RUNNING SO I CAN TRY TO TO WHEN WHEN WHEN WE'VE GOT HER COMING IN 
AND WE'LL JUST SORT OF DO A RUN THROUGH OF PROPER PILOT JUST TO JUST JUST SO I CAN USE THE 
YEP 
YEP 
UM YEAH I'LL MAKE SURE MAKE SURE THEY CAN ACTUALLY PICK UP THE OF UM AUDIO SIGNAL AS WELL 
UH SO BUT UH IT SHOULD BE THE YEAH THE AUDIO SIGNAL SHOULD BE COMING OUT THE SPEAKERS ONCE IT'S SET UP PROPERLY 
SO THAT SHOULD THAT SHOULD MAKE THAT SLIGHTLY EASIER 
YEAH YEP 
UH BUT YEAH SO THEY'RE FORTUNATE HAVE SPEAKERS O ON THE MONITORS INSIDE THE ROOM 
SO AS LONG AS AND WHAT WE'LL HAVE DONE IS JUST GONNA SET UP AS THE UH WHATEVER THE ASTERISK SOUND IS ON WINDOWS IS WHAT GETS PLAYED 
SO SO JUST CHANGE SOUND AT WHATEVER YOU LIKE JUST GO THROUGH THE WINDOWS CONTROL PANEL 
YEP YEAH SO I'LL I'LL HAVE THAT RUNNING OVER THE WEEKEND 
UM SO L LAST WEEK I TRIED IT WITH A ONE KILO HERTZ SOUND 
UM AND IT WAS IT C IT COULD DETECT IT BUT IT WASN'T BUT BUT IT WASN'T VERY CLEAR 
DID IT WITH TEN KILO HERTZ AND IT'S JUST REALLY CLEAR WHERE YOU CAN TELL EXACTLY WHERE EXACTLY WHERE THE BEEP SO NOW 
SO YEAH 
SO TH IT'S JU JUST A MATTER OF UM YEAH YOU JUST BA BASICALLY JUST PLAY IT 
JUST PLAY A TEN KILO HERTZ SOUND OVER THE OVER THE SPEECH AND THEN JUST UM COMPARE THE TWO SIGNALS BASICALLY 
UM SO I'VE I'VE GOT A LITTLE SCRIPT FOR DOING IT 
SO SO YEAH YEAH 
YEP YEP NOT A PROBLEM 
YEP YEAH THE THE ON THE NO NO JUST INSTALLED SHOULD HAVE THAT NOW 
UM WE'LL DOUBLE WE'LL DOUBLE CHECK AND RE INSTALL ON SOFTWARE ON THE ON THE UM EYE TRACKING MACHINES 
BUT YEAH IT SHOULD UH SHOULD BE UPDATED WITHOUT ANY 
SO 
YEAH SO SO SO WE'VE GOT LIKE UH A BIG CIRCLE WITH A WHITE CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT FOR AN EYE 
AND WE GOT LIKE A RECTANGLE WITH TWO LIKE RECTANGLE BUTTONS ON IT FOR A MOUSE 
SO 
OH NO THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE IS THE USE THE ORIGINAL BLOBS BASICALLY 
BUT UM SO THEY UH YEAH I THINK THE MOUSE IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER BUT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT HUGELY BIGGER 
SO 
YEAH 
AND IF IT EVER EVER GETS TO BE A PROBLEM IN THE PILOT I CAN EASILY REDUCE THE SIZE OF WHATEVER 
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT TOO HARD 
SO 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
UH I'LL TRY TO 
YEAH YEAH 
SO SO YOU CAN YOU CAN DO IT IN X. FIG EXPORT THEM AS S. V. G. AND YOU JUST GOT A YOU JUST GOT A LIST OF X. Y. COORDINATES 
UM AND THEN I'LL JUST WRITE ON A LITTLE SCRIPT THAT TURNS THOSE X. Y. COORDINATES INTO A PART 
WELL THE THING IS IT'S S. V. G. 
SO AS LONG AS I'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT WILL OUTPUT S. V. G. 
YEAH YEAH 
SO I'LL ALS I'LL ALSO HAVE A LIKE HAVE A LOOK AT THAT 
BUT TH THERE'S THERE MUST BE PLENTY OF WINDOWS THINGS FOR THE THAT I O OUTPUT S. V. G. 
MENU UH I KN I KNOW I KNOW 
UM I KN I KNOW ADOBE AND THINGS HAVE FACULTIES THAT DO IT 
BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE LIKE A FEW HUNDRED POUNDS 
UM SO THE BUT THERE I I'D B I'D BE VERY SURPRISED IF THERE WASN'T A FREE PACKAGE FOR DOING IT 
UM I UH I HAVE A FEELING THAT THE M MY THE W. THREE C. BROWSER DOES IT 
HAVE A FEELING THAT THAT CAN ACTUALLY EDIT S. V. G. FILES 
YEP YEP 
YEP FAIR ENOUGH 
YEAH 
UM WHEN WELL YEAH BUT NO I'LL I'LL CREATE A C I'LL CREATE A CONVEX PART UM JUST SO NEXT WEEK UM JU YEAH 
BUT IT JUST TO TO JUST JUST HAPPENED TO BE A CONVEX PART THAT I WAS THAT I WAS I WAS PLAYING WITH 
SO IT IT HANDLED THAT FINE 
UM IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY SELF INTERSECTIONS SO THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM 
SO I'LL JUST HAVE TO HAVE CHECK THAT 
BUT 
YEAH BY BY A BY A PART OF IT CROSSES OVER ITSELF 
UM SO SO IT'S SORTA LIKE A B 
YEAH THAT SORT OF THING 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
IF IF IT IF IT BECOMES A YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH SO FOR NOW WE'LL JUST JUST ASSUME THAT NON INTERSE NON INTERSECTING UM AND UM YEAH 
AND THEN THERE'S THIS AT THE MOMENT THE E THE S. V. G. STUFF CAN OUTPUT ONES WHICH AREN'T CLOSED POLYGONS 
BUT UM ONES ONES YOU ONES THAT ACTUALLY HAD TURN UP INTO PARTS LIST UH IT CREATES A CLOSED POLYGON BY LINKING THE L END POINT AT THE START POINT 
SO SO UH YEAH SO AS LONG AS LONG AS THEY'RE YEAH 
SO AS AS AS LONG AS THEY'RE THEY'RE DRAWN WELL ENOUGH IT SHOULD BE ALRIGHT 
SO UM BUT YEAH 
SUPPOSE LET NIJMEGEN UH FIND THEIR FIND THEIR OWN S. V. G. SORT OF FIND SOMETHING THAT DOES S. V. G. AND THEN WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT IT UM IT MIGHT BE WORTH JUST CHECKING WHAT SOFTWARE THEY ARE USING 'CAUSE IT MIGHT CREA IT MIGHT CREATE OUTPUTS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM X. FIG 
SO 
YEAH 
THAT SHOULD THAT SHOULD BE FINE 
YEAH I THINK IT DOES S. V. J. UH S. V. J. OUTPUT 
UM SO I'LL I C I CAN SAY DOUBLE CHECK IF UH NIJMEGEN CAN'T FIND ANYTHING 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT OTHER THAN THAT THAT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO INSTALL THOUGH WASN'T IT 
IT WAS YEAH 
COPY AND PASTE THE STUFF TO THE OFF OFF THE WIKI 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN UH ALSO DOUBLE CHECKED IN THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA WE COULD ACCESS THE C. V. S. FROM HOME WHEN I WAS WORKING FROM HOME LAST LAST WEEK 
UM ON THURSDAY I MANAGED TO MANAGED TO GET ONE AND JUST JUST CHECK THE STUFF AND MAKE SURE IT WAS ALL MAKE SURE THE MAKE SURE MA MAKE SURE I COULD ACCESS IT 
SO THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE ACCESSING IT ONCE THEY'VE GOT THE LOG INS 
IS NOT YET I'M AFRAID 
UH WELL IN NICE UH ONCE I'VE TRIED TO THE CAMTASIA STUFF I'LL SEE IF THE IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS GONNA TR GONNA TRY AND FIX THEM 
IF THERE ISN'T ANY PROBLEMS 
NEXT TIME I'M WORKING ON THIS UH G. D. F. STUFF UM SO SO I'VE I'VE I P UH PUT IN A D. T. D. AND A SAMPLE X. M. L. FILE IN THE WIKI FOR THE G. D. F. 
SO IT'S BA BASED ON SOME STUFF YOU PUT IN THERE IN THE G. D. F. SPECIFICATION 
UM 
YEAH I MEAN WITH I CHO I CHANGED A COUPLE OF THINGS FROM YOUR ORIGINAL DRAFT 
UM SO THERE'S NOT UH THERE'S NO LONGER A SEPARATE THING FOR CREATING NEW PARTS 
SO JUST PUT A START AND END TIME ON EACH PART 
UH SO 
SO THE THE Y Y YOU HAD A YOU HAD A THING CALL I THINK IT'S MOULD OR S OR SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID WHICH IS SORT OF TO CREATE A NEW PART 
THERE'S AN ACTION TO CREATE A NEW PART 
UM BUT I TH UH I'VE I GAVE EACH PART A START TIME AND AN END TIME UM SO YOU CAN SEE WHEN THE PARTS WERE CREATED 
SO I'M NOT SO SO I'M NOT NOT SURE IF YOU WANNA KEEP THE MOLD OR NOT 
OH 
YEAH BUT IT'S IT'S JUST THE G. D. F. SPECIFICATION PAGE ON THE UH IN THE WIKI 
I'VE UH I MEAN I'LL TRY TRY TO PUT IN JUSTIFICATION FOR FOR THE CHANGE THAT I MADE UH IN THE PAGE 
SO UM BUT I'VE I'VE SENT TO IT FOR REVIEW SO THAT IS ANYONE WHO IS GONNA USING THE FORMAT CAN HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
HUH 
RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
MIND WHEN THE 
YEAH 
WELL THE ONES THAT THIS STUFF I MEAN SO IT'S HELPFUL 
IT WAS HELPFUL FOR ME TO PUTTING IT UP ON THE WIKI 'CAUSE I COULD ACTUALLY THIN THINK ABOUT IT SO I PUT IT UP AND SAY WELL THIS IS THIS IS WHY AND THE THIS IS WHY I WANNA DO THINGS THIS WAY 
UM SO 
YEP YEP 
YEP 
FAIR ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL UH WELL I KN I KNOW ON CAMTASIA IF YOU GOT A C IF YOU'VE GOT A CAMTASIA PROJECT 
YOU CAN HAVE THE VIDEO AND AUDIO STORED SEPARATELY 
IN WHICH CASE 
YEAH 
SO YEAH 
SO SO WE JUST ENDED THE JUST ENDED THE THE DUTCH STREAM YEAH THE VIDEO AND OR DO 
AND THEN THEY CAN EASY CREATE THEIR AUDIO OUT OF MM FROM THAT TOP 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL ONE THING UH IN ONE THING THAT CAMTASIA CAN DO YOU CAN HAVE LITTLE VIDEOS WHEN THERE HAVEN'T GOTTEN GOT ANY CAMERAS FOR DOING THAT 
BUT YOU COULD LIKE HAVE VIDEOS OF PEOPLE CLICK ON THE MOUSES AND SORTA OR WHATEVER ELSE MM-HMM 
YOU CAN DO YEAH YOU CAN GENERATE CALL OUTS AND WHATEVER 
SO THE MIGHT YEAH I'M SURE THERE MUST BE A WAY OF PUTTING BIG ARROWS OV OR WHATEVER 
UM 
OOPS 
NO I'M AN AF AFRAID NOT 
I WOULDN'T KNOW 
NO 
NO NO 
THAT'S A SO THAT'S PSYCHOLOGY THING HOW HARD THEY 
YEAH YEAH SO THIS YEAH 
YES YES 
HE'LL HE'LL JUST BE WORKING WITH ROBIN ON WHAT ANALYSIS WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THE G. D. F. FORMAT 
UM SO I'M GONNA C BASICALLY I'VE GOT A THE GEST ANALYSER'S THE BASE THE BASIS FOR UH UM ASCII TO G. D. F. CONVERTER 
UM SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS ACTUALLY CREATE AN OUTPUT UH A G. D. F. OUTPUT PART IT IT 
UM 'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT UH ONLY OUTPUTS THE VIDEO 
UM BUT IT DOES HAVE INTERNAL STRUCTURES WILL JUST MAKE IT EASY TO DO THE THE X. M. L. 
SO SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA LOOK AT 
AND THEN ONCE I'VE DONE THAT I CAN LOOK AT THE WHATEVER ANALYSIS WE NEED TO GET DONE OUT OF THE G. D. F. 
YEP 
YEAH YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
UM I THINK THAT'S IT 
AND I'LL T UH YEAH 
I'LL GET GET WORKING ON THE CAMTASIA STUFF THIS WEEK AND THEN IS NICE UH ONCE UH ONCE WE'VE GOT SOME SOME IDEA ABOUT WHAT ANALYSIS YOU WANT OUT OF THIS 
I CAN THINK ABOUT WHETHER G. D. F. 'S GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED ON IT 
UM AND F YEAH WHAT ANALYSIS WE CAN PULL OUT OF IT 
YEAH YEAH 
SO I'LL I'LL DOUBLE CHECK THE G. D. F. SPECIFICATION AGAINST THAT JUST TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU SAID THAT YOU'D YOU SAY YOU NEED FROM THAT LIST 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
'CAUSE THEY I MEAN WE WE WE GOT ALL THOSE ON THE ASCII FORMAT TO THE MOMENT AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHAT DATE DO WE NEED TO PULL OUT OF THAT INTO THE G. D. F. S I CAN ACTUALLY DO THE PROPER ANALYSIS 
UM 'CAUSE I THINK ALL THE ANSWERS ARE GONNA BE RUN OFF THE G. D. F. FORMAT 'CAUSE 'CAUSE WE'VE DECIDED THAT IF WE WANT AND LOOKED WELL IF WE'RE LOOKING AT DYNAMIC REASONS AND WHATEVER ELSE 
IT HAS TO BE G. D. F. 
YEAH 
WHICH IS YEAH WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE TO DO IT OFF THE G. D. F. S AS OPPOSED TO THE I. D. F. FORMAT 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
SO SO THE G. D. F. IT'S GOT YEAH SO IT'S IT'S GOT UH THE ALL THE THE STUFF ON THE UM I. D. F. 
SO IT'S JUST THE UH THE ASCII FILE THE THINGS LIKE THE MOUSE MOVEMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
AND THEN YEAH YEAH AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT G. D. F. CAN LOSE IT WILL ALSO HAVE INFORMATION SUCH AS RIGHT 
AT THIS POINT IN TIME THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE NEW PARTS ARE ARE THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE TARGET 
YEAH 
UM SO YEAH 
SO THE THE G. D. F. IS GONNA HAVE THAT SORT OF INFORMATION ON IT 
AND THEN ALSO 'CAUSE IT'S X. M. L. FILE WE CAN THEN DO X. S. L. T. OR WHATEVER ON IT TO TO GET EXTRACT WHATEVER BITS OF DATA YOU NEED FOR YEAH 
FOR FOR WHICHEVER BITS OF ANALYSIS YOU'RE TRYING TO DO FROM IT 
SO 
YEP 
I MEAN IF YOU'RE EVER YOU KNOW LATE 'CAUSE IF THAT IT'S NOT WE'LL FIND A WAY AROUND IT 
AND I'VE PUT YOU GUYS ON MONDAYS AT THIS TIME FOR MY CONVENIENCE BUT IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT 
REALLY 
I REALLY 
GREAT 
I WAS THE SO WHAT'D THEY HAVE TO DO BACK UP 
OH 
NASTY 
YEAH YEAH 
G I WE'RE GLAD THEY'LL LOOK AFTER THAT BUT 
UH I DON'T KNOW 
DO WE WANNA LOOK AT ANYTHING 
IT'S NOT UP YET 
I CAN 
UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S DOING 
OOPS THAT FELL OFF 
DOESN'T LIKE SILK 
STAY 
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA DISCOVER WE'VE GOT NO REASON TO MEET RIGHT 
'CAUSE EVERYTHING'S GOING SWIMMINGLY 
OH 
'CAUSE UH I HAVEN'T BEEN I HAVEN'T READ THE WIKIS IN MY EMAIL SINCE I LEFT 
SO UM 
OH YEAH 
UH-HUH 
UH-HUH 
UM THE UH WELL UM I DON'T KNOW THE MOZILLA STUFF 
SO IF IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S IDIOSYNCRATIC IN SOME WAY THAT TEACHES YOU FUNNY HABITS THEN IT WON'T HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
UH WELL YOU TH THERE ARE CERTAIN COMPANIES UM THAT I DON'T WANNA NAME WHO DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT 
I C BUT UM YEAH MOZILLA 
YEAH IT'LL BE ALRIGHT 
SO OKAY 
I BELIEVE YOU NOW IT'S A GOOD STRATEGY 
MM-HMM 
UH WH WHY DOES IT HELP THAT IT'S X. T. H. T. M. L. INSTEAD OF JUST X. M. L. 
YEAH BUT MOST M MOST BROWSERS WHEN WHEN YOU UH PUT AN X. M. L. FILE UP ON IT 
IT'LL JUST APPLY SOME DEFAULT STYLE SHEET AT IT ANYWAY THAT SHOWS YOU 
OKAY YEAH 
OKAY SO ALL YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IS SWAP IN TAG NAMES LATER 
OKAY 
EV EVERYBODY'S GOT THREE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THESE THINGS 
I'M SURE THAT'S FINE 
LIKE HAVING TO UH G IT'S 
YEAH 
NO I'M JUST TRY I'M TRYING TO L THINK OF THE THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG 
UM BUT SINCE I HAVEN'T TRIED TO THIS PARTICULAR WAY YOU KNOW UM BUT YEAH THAT SOUNDS GOOD 
SO UM I SEE YOU SAY WE HAVEN'T FINALISED WHAT THE G. D. F. LOOKS LIKE 
SO THAT AN IMPLICIT REQUEST FOR ME TO DO SOMETHING 
OR 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
IS A WELL I MEAN THERE'S TWO TWO CASES IN HERE RIGHT 
THERE'S THINGS YOU CAN GET STRAIGHT OFF THE ORIGINAL FORMAT AND THEN THERE'S THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO SOME KIND OF POST PROCESSING OF THE ORIGINAL FORMAT 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST A DATA FORMAT CHANGE IT'S ACTUALLY SOME KIND OF COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS TO GET THE THING OUT OF IT AS WELL RIGHT 
AND IT WASN'T UH Y I THINK IT WAS A LITTLE BIT UM CONFUSED UH LAST TIME WE SPOKE ABOUT UM WHETHER 
U WHETHER YOU CONSIDER G. D. F. FORMAT TO BE UM THE THING THAT'S JUST THE STRAIGHT FORWARD TRANSLATIONS OF WHAT'S ON THE ORIGINAL EYE TRACKING OUTPUT 
OR WHETHER LIKE WHETHER THE POST PROCESSING UTILITIES ARE A SEPARATE STEP 
'CAUSE I THINK YOU AND I HAD SEPARATE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THIS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER W WHO HAD WHICH VIEW AT THIS POINT 
SO YOU ARE YOU WORKING UH ACTIVELY ON THIS ANAL THESE ANALYSIS THINGS ARE YOU JUST WORKING ON THE TRANSLATION 
UH IS THE DATA FORMAT TRANSLATION 
OH OKAY 
SO YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT WHAT'S IN THERE AND WHAT ISN'T IN THERE THAT YOU NEED TO DO SOME REALLY INTENSIVE TRANSFORM TO DO 
NOT YET OH OKAY 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S UNDER CONTROL AND YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU GUYS ARE TELLING EACH OTHER WHAT YOU GUYS NEED TO KNOW 
SO I DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING RIGHT 
YOU'RE ALL FINE 
BUT THERE WAS A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CAME BEFORE THIS RIGHT THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE NOT UNDER CONTROL YET 
SO SO YOU KNOW THE G. D. F. STUFF WITH SO I ELLEN'S VIEW ON THIS IS WE GO THROUGH EVERYTHING IN ORDER 
LIKE THE PRIORITY IS EXACTLY THE PIPE LINE ORDER RIGHT 
SO UM CAMTASIA YOU MENTIONED 
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE BUT WE SHOULD CHECK WHAT OTHER THINGS WERE BEFORE THIS IN THE LIST OF THINGS TO DO 
UNTIL YOU GET THE UH MICROPHONES 
BATTERIES 
OKAY UH ARE THEY REALLY REALLY STRANGE BATTERIES 
HAVE YOU TRIED MAPLIN 
ARE THEY EXPENSIVE 
'CAUSE YOU KNOW LIKE A WEE BUS JOURNEY OVER TO MAPLIN MIGHT SOLVE THE PROBLEM IF IT'S GETTING IN THE WAY 
SO THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY UM RUINING YOUR SCHEDULE FOR ANYTHING AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE WAITING 
RIGHT OKAY 
IT SO I SEE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE UM YEAH 
WHEN YOU GET WORRIED GO TO MAPLIN OKAY 
PHONE THEM FIRST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IN THERE 
SOMEBODY AROUND MUST HAVE A UH PROBABLY STEVE 
SOMEBODY IN THE TECHIE GROUP WILL HAVE A MAPLIN CATALOGUE 
FACT I'LL SEE IF I CAN UM YEAH IT'S USEFUL TO KNOW WHO'S GOT A CURRENT ONE ANYWAY 
I DON'T SEEM TO GET THEM ANYMORE 
I GUESS I DON'T BUY ENOUGH EQUIPMENT 
OH YEAH 
OF COURSE 
DUH 
SO YOU CAN FIND OUT WHETHER THEY HAVE TO 
BUT YOU'D HAVE TO PHONE OVER TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAVE IT IN STOCK DOWN THERE 
I ACTUALLY LIVE NOT THAT FAR FROM THERE 
UM SO 
IT WOULD BE A HALF HOUR UM DIVERSION FROM MY MORNING ROUTINE TO PICK UP STUFF 
UH W BUT THEN AGAIN IT'S ALSO VERY CLOSE TO HAYMARKET SO IT'S EVEN LESS OF A DIVERSION FOR YOU PROBABLY 
EXCEPT YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND 
OH YEAH 
OH YEAH C YEAH 
YEAH 
I JUST THINK WELL YOU KNOW FOR THE SAKE OF THREE QUID OR HOWEVER MANY QUID IT HOW MANY BATTERIES DOES THIS THING TAKE 
DOESN'T TAKE A HUNDRED 
YEAH THEN YOU KNOW PUT YOUR MIND IT REST 
'CAUSE YOU KNOW YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO TO BE THE MORNING YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE RECORDING AND THEN SUDDENLY DISCOVER YEAH 
YOU KNOW THIS 
UH CHECK THEY GET 'EM FIRST THOUGH 
THEIR STOCKS ARE A BIT FUNNY DOWN THERE 
'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE IN OUR TO WALK THROUGH IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANYTHING OUT OF IT 
SO IF ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE IN THE WIKI DO I NEED TO PULL UP THE WIKI 
UH IT IS GONNA LET ME LOG IN 
NO I DO NOT WANNA CHANGE MY PASSWORD 
UM 
BUT YOU GUYS PROBABLY KNOW OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE WE WE WERE WAITING ON BEFORE YOU COULD RUN 
SO ALL THOSE TASKS CRAIG HAD WHEN IT STARTED 
UH HIS LAST DAY WAS THE THIRTY FIRST OF OCTOBER 
OH YEAH NO NO 
IT'S OURS 
YEAH IT'S OURS 
UH SO HE'S GOT OURS LEFT 
HE'S BEHIND HAND 
BUT NO HE WAS BILLING FOR UH WAS BILLING BY THE HERE 
SO I THOUGHT WELL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IF HE WANTS TO FINISH OFF THEN YOU KNOW 
UH WELL THEY'RE PROBABLY AWAY THEN 
WASN'T ELLEN AWAY 
THEY'RE REALLY AT THE SAME PLACE 
OH YEAH IT COULD BE TOO 
UH YOU HAVE NO MODELS AT ALL 
OH THAT'S A PITY 
MODEL BUIL BUILDER THAT'S WHAT I WAS CALLING THE GRAPHICAL MODEL EDITOR RIGHT 
SO YOU USE X. FIG TO MAKE THE PARTS AND THEN YOU THIS THING 
OH OKAY 
YEP 
OKAY 
UM I HAVE SOMETHING IN MY EMAIL ABOUT FROM JOE 
UH HE WOULDN'T HAVE SENT TO JUST TO ME WOULD UH 
DO YOU WANT ME TO CHECK THAT 
I'M NOT GONNA PROJECT MY EMAIL 
OKAY I THINK I MIGHTA HEARD THURSDAY OR SOMETHING 
I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHEN IT WAS 
OH 
OKAY SO I'VE GOT SOMETHING ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH 
THAT'S FRIDAY I THINK 
UH UH JUST WANTS TO KNOW HOW TO GET PAID 
RIGHT 
THAT SUGGESTS HE'S DONE DONE DONE 
ANYWAY HE'S IN EDINBURGH 
AS WELL I SUPPOSE HE WON'T COME BY 'CAUSE CRAIG'S ON HIS DESK 
YEAH 
SO 
WELL HE'S JUST NOT GONNA TRY TO LE SQUAT THERE THAT'S ALL 
UH WELL I SEE THE LAST THING I'VE GOT FROM HIM ABOUT WORK WORK WAS THE NINETEENTH OF OCTOBER THAT SAID HE UPLOADED SOME CHANGES THAT YOU WANTED 
THAT'S 
UH SO YOU DIDN'T GET THAT 
IT WAS UM AND HIM 
BUT PRESUMABLY THE UH PUT IT IN THE WIKI 
SO 
SO HE'S JUST TELLING US 'CAUSE UH THINGS WE PROBABLY DON'T READ WIKIS 
AND I'LL JUST CHECK 
YEAH 
WELL I I HAVEN'T REPLIED TO HIM ABOUT YEAH I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE MORE RECENT FROM HIM 
SO I HAVEN'T REPLIED TO HIM ABOUT UM 
YOU KNOW HOW TO SUBMIT COSTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
SO UM BUT THAT SUGGESTS HE'S AT AT THE END OF THINGS BUT WE WE COULD JUST ASK HIM 
I MEAN MAYBE YOU GUYS WOULD JUST WANNA ASK HIM DIRECTLY YOU'RE DONE DONE RIGHT 
'CAUSE UM IT'S WORTH YOU GUYS KNOWING 
AND THEN OF COURSE ANY PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN YOU INHERIT 
OH RIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT IT DOES AND MAKING SURE IT DOES WHAT YOU WANT I GUESS 
SO THE THE PROBLEM IS YOU WANT YOU WANTED TO CONSTRUCT SOME MODELS ON IT FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT BUT YOU WERE HOPING TO GET SOME FROM MARLOES 
OH YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT HAVE YOU YOU TRIED COLD CALLING HER 
THAT'S WHAT I D WHEN I AND THINGS THAT 
ACH TRY PHONE 
WHEN I IF YOU GET 'EM TODAY WHEN ARE YOU GONNA START RUNNING 
OH RIGHT 
SO YOU HAVE TO BE YOU HAVE TO BE READY BY THEN 
YEAH OR OR CHANGE THE SCHEDULE 
RIGHT OKAY 
UH-HUH YEAH 
MAKES SENSE 
UM SUBJECTS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AUDIO 
YEAH 
SO SO Y Y YOU DON'T HAVE SUBJECTS LINED UP BUT YOU DON'T EXPECT ANY TROUBLE GETTING THEM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BYE 
UM I DON'T KNOW THIS PERSON 
SO THEY WILL THEY NEED TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT IT 
WHO WHO'S THERE IS THAT A STAFF MEMBER OR A STUDENT 
OKAY 
UM WELL WE KINDA PAID FOR THE LAB 
SO IT DEPENDS BUT I SUPPOSE TALKING TO THEM SOMETIMES SOLVES THESE PROBLEMS 
UM YOU MIGHT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT SORT OF STAFF MEMBER IS IT 
SO IT A 
RIGHT 
UM I MEAN PRESUMABLY HE OR SHE IS NOT RUNNING SUBJECTS THE ENTIRE 
BLOCK BOOK FOR HOW LONG 
UH-HUH 
UH-HUH 
UM SO UH UM ELLEN'S STILL OUT OF TOWN RIGHT 
IT'S JUST UH Y YOU COULD TRY CALLING THIS PERSON AND SEE HOW THIS WORKS 
ELLEN MIGHT BE MORE PERSUASIVE 
UM IT'S JUST SOMETIMES UH ACADEMIC STAFF HAVE A BIT OF A CHIP BUT UM RESEARCH STAFF 
AND SINCE I DON'T KNOW THE PERSON I CAN'T TELL WHETHER IT'S ONE OF THESE ARE NOT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AND THEN ESCALATE I GUESS 
BUT UH YOU KNOW OR WHETHER THEY CAN BE PUT OFF FOR A LITTLE BIT OR SOMETHING 
SO I HAVE AN IDEA HOW THE BOOKING SYSTEM WORKS 
WELL YOU'RE DISCUSSING IT ON THURSDAY RIGHT 
AT THE MOMENT THERE'S JUST A BOOKING SYSTEM 
YEAH 
YEP 
WELL THAT'S THAT'S ONE TO RAISE AT THE MEETING 
UM I V MIGHT TALK TO ELLEN ABOUT THAT AHEAD OF TIME 'CAUSE UH THEY MAY HAVE SH AND MARTIN MAY HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT APPROPRIATE USE OF THE LAB 
OH REALLY 
YEAH BUT I G DON'T YOU GUYS SET UP FOR ISN'T BLOCK BOOKING MORE APPROPRIATE 
BECAUSE 
I I ISN'T THERE SET UP INVOLVED IN CHANGING AROUND FOR SOMEBODY ELSE 
NO 
OR IN THE SOFTWARE OR ANYTHING 
OKAY 
SO THERE'S NO COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT BEING MORNINGS OR AFTERNOONS 
YEAH 
SO SO ON THE WORST CASE UM YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT IF YOU ACTUALLY NEED THAT WEEK THAT YOU CAN COLLECT ON THE MORNINGS THAT WEEK 
SO THIS SOMETHING THAT'S KNOWN OUTSIDE ELLEN'S HEAD 
IT'S IN THE W BOOKING SYSTEM 
UH WELL 
THAT'S SOMETHING 
UH-HUH 
WELL MOST THE TIME TO TO P YEAH 
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF POSSIBLE WAYS OF GETTING WHAT TIME YOU NEED 
OF COURSE TRY TO BE KINDA AT OTHER PEOPLE 
BUT YOU WOULD ANYWAY 
SO 
SO THESE ARE THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE WORRYING YOU CAMTASIA AND LAB ACCESS 
AND OTHERWISE NO SWEAT YOU'RE HAPPY 
UH AND THE MODEL BUILDERS YEAH 
OH YEAH 
OH UH-HUH 
THIS THIS IS GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WHILE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT YOU WERE GONNA TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO OVERLAY SOMETHING ON TOP OF THE VIDEO THAT ARE NO 
YOU WERE JUST GO REALLY GONNA RUN A VIDEO OF THE SEP OF THE TRIAL 
YEAH OKAY 
THAT'S THAT'S MUCH EASIER 
SO UM WITH THE MODEL BUILDER WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WITH IT 
THE THE UM WHICH ONE YOU IS GONNA LOOK AT WHAT IT DOES IS FOR AND YOU'LL JUST TO TRY TO DO THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
UM HOW MANY MODELS WERE YOU RELYING ON HERE FOR 
SO ARE YOU SUDDENLY GONNA BE 
WELL WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET IT IS IS YOUR START TIME GONNA BE DELAYED 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MODELS READY IF SHE DOESN'T COME THROUGH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
WELL 
UM CAN YOU DRAFT CRAIG IN TO BUILD SOME OF NECESSARY 
YEAH 
WELL YOU KNOW ME CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND ALL THIS 
I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT THE WORST 
YOU CAN UM CALL A JAST TELCON BETWEEN YOU AND MARLOES 
YOU KNOW I IF IT'S NOT THAT AS YOU KNOW 
WITH THE COLD CALLING YOU CAN USUALLY AT LEAST FIND OUT WHETHER THEY'RE ALIVE AND GET AN AN OFFER TO TO GET SOMETHING 
BUT YOU KNOW THE NEXT THE NEXT ESCALATION IS SAYING NO WE REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS 
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW TUESDAY AT SUCH SUCH A TIME UNLESS YOU 
UM 
BUT PRESUMABLY WHATEVER IT IS THEY'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH SO NOW OVER 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I D 
I'D JUST HIT FOR THAT IT C ME TOO SLOW YOU UP IN COLLECTING STUFF THAT'S ALL 
OBVIOUS YEAH OH OKAY THAT'S TRUE 
WELL THAT SOUNDS 
THAT'S QUITE A SMALL THING SHE CAN DO FOR YOU I GUESS 
YOU KNOW 
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW W SITTING THERE BRAIN DEADLY CONSTRUCTING YOU KNOW SOME MODELS THAT SHE NEEDS TO DO 
IT'S JUST TO PROVIDE ADVICE ABOUT THIS WHICH MUST TAKE TAKE LESS TIME 
WELL THAT ALL SOUNDS FINE 
YOU GUYS WORRIED ABOUT IT 
YOU WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING 
WE'VE MOSTLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE EXPERIMENT SCHEDULE 
SO 
MM 
YOU'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF THINGS TO ME OF DO THAT WE HAVEN'T SET YOU UP FOR ANY TIME SOON 
THE G. D. F. SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT TAKE A WEE WHILE 
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING FROM UM FOR THAT 'CAUSE THAT'S ALREADY SORTA SPECED 
I MEAN AGAIN THAT'S THE PRO IF YOU 
YEAH 
IT'S JUST WHAT I'M WORRYING IT W WORRIED ABOUT IS HIM BEING IN THE LAB ALL DAY LONG AND YOU NOT BEING SURE LIKE WHAT TO DO FOR THE ANALYSIS ON OR SOMETHING 
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE COMPLETELY UNAVAILABLE WHEN YOU'RE RECORDING 
OR WELL THERE BE TIMES WHEN YOU DON'T RECORD ALL DAY 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
'CAUSE HE MIGHT UH YEAH NO NO NO I UNDERSTAND THAT 
IT WAS IT WAS MORE LIKE UH IT WAS MORE LIKE YOU KNOW 
YOU USE THIS WEEK HE'S GOT YOU KNOW THE G. D. F. STUFF TO DO 
THEN NEXT WEEK YOU'RE PLANNING ON RECORDING 
AND WHAT HAPPENS IF SUDDENLY YOU'RE UNAVAILABLE ALL OF NEXT WEEK JUST WHEN HE RUNS OUT OF WORK 
YEAH 
SO SO WE'LL WORRY ABOUT IT THEN 
MM-HMM YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT I D DON'T KNOW SO WE WANNA BOTHER WITH A PART BUILDER 
I MEAN THE IDEA WAS IT WASN'T WORTH THE INVESTMENT RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OR DO YOU 
UM YEAH BUT NOW NOW THAT THE GUY BUILDING THESE MODELS KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO DO THE ROTSYM SOME STUFF 
DO THEY HAVE DO YOU HAVE TROUBLE DOING IT 
NO SO 
YEAH 
WELL G I MEAN UM WE MIGHT WANT TO UM SEVERELY CASH LIMIT THE INVESTMENT THAT YOU PUT INTO MAKING A PART BUILDER RIGHT 
SO HOW HOW MANY PERSON DAYS WOULD TO BE WORTH LIKE IF CRAIG DISCOVERED IT COULD BE DONE IN X. DAYS 
RIGHT SO THERE'S YOUR LIMIT 
DON'T SPEND MORE THAN A DAY OR TWO ON IT 
YEAH UH 'CAUSE IT REALLY ISN'T WORTH IT 
YOU YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S THINGS ABOUT THIS PROJECT WE'VE HIDDEN FROM YOU USE FOR THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT 
SO IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE OUT OF WORK 
OH REALLY 
UH THAT ONE'LL JUST BE A LITTLE ADD ONE 
THAT'LL WHATEVER IT IS IT'LL BE THE SAME SKILLS AS YOU'VE LEARNED FOR SOMETHING ELSE 
UM AND IT'LL JUST BE I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT'S YOU 'CAUSE I THINK SOMEBODY ELSE IS DOING THAT ACTUALLY 
BUT UM I'M THINKING MORE OF THE FACT THAT UM AT SOME POINT WE SHOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU ABOUT THIS N. X. T. STUFF 
SO 
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S X. M. L. AND X. M. L. AND YOU KNOW 
IT TAKES STAND OFF LINKS AND STUFF AND IT'S UM SOME SOME PEOPLE IF THEY'RE NOT USED TO LINGUISTIC ANNOTATION C UM UH IT C TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO GET THEIR HEAD AROUND THE WAY THE IDEA DATA DATA MODEL WORKS 
AND UM YOU KNOW THERE'S STUFF TO LEARN THERE 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
YEP 
SO 
YEAH 
SO JUST DON'T WITTER AWAY YOU KNOW WEEKS ON FRIPPERIES WHEN WE'VE GOT THE REAL ME MEAT OF THIS YET TO COME 
WE'LL FIND WE'LL FIND PLENTY OF REALLY REALLY CRUCIAL S THINGS FOR YOU TO DO 
SO 
OKAY 
SO UH I'LL UH REMIND MYSELF TO LOOK AT WHAT'S NEXT BEFORE THE NEXT TIME WE GET TOGETHER 
YEAH 
SO YOU COLLECT ON MONDAY 
THAT MEANS YOU DON'T WANNA MEET RIGHT 
UH R RIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY NEXT WEEK 
IT'S ACTUALLY THE WEEK THAT YOU WERE PLANNING ON 
OH OKAY 
WELL I DON'T KNOW 
ANYWAY UM YOU'LL TELL ME WHETHER IT WE CANCEL THIS 
OR WHETHER I JUST TALK TO CRAIG 
IN WHICH CASE WE WON'T BE UP HERE 'CAUSE WE DON'T RECORD TWOS 
OH YEAH 
THAT SHOULD BE FINE 
LET'S SEE THAT'S LIKE THE 
THAT COMES TO AN IDEAL TIME FOR YOU THEN 
THAT'S LIKE THE TWENTIETH OR SOMETHING 
UH I CAN'T ADD 
MONDAY IS THE 
YEAH 
OH YEAH YOU HAVE TO PROMISE TO TELL US HOW THAT IS 
'CAUSE PEOPLE DO ASK ME 
YEAH IN A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU'D BE SURPRI THESE THINGS DO 
WELL IF THEY WERE GONNA DO THAT THEN THEY'D FORCE YOU TO GO TO IT 
I WOULD AND I WOULD KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'D GONE TO KNOW 
YOU KNOW 
I'M PRETTY SURE THEY DIDN'T HAVE INDUCTION IN MY DAY 
SO 
REALLY 
BUT YOU ONLY STARTED HERE 
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO I'M SURE 
UH WELL 
OH YEAH 
OH 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SEEMS REASONABLE 
SO UM IT'LL BE LIKE AN UH MONITOR 
BUT YEAH THEY'LL ALL BE DIFFERENT TIERS LIKE THAT 
AND THEN THERE'S THE LANGUAGE STUFF AS WELL PRESUMABLY 
YEAH THIS IS THE EASY STUFF 
YEAH 
WELL YES AND MOUSE 
YES AND MIC 
UH-HUH 
AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR YOU RIGHT 
I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE WAY YOU WANT IT 
COURSE THERE ARE LOT LOTS OF THINGS THAT CAN DO THAT 
BUT IT'S THE LANGUAGE PART THAT'S THE HARD PART 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S 
THAT SEEMS FINE YEAH 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE UM THE SETS OF CODES ARE 
WELL THE WHATEV WHATEVER WHATEVER YOU'RE GETTING OUT OF THE JAST ANALYSER 
SO 
I MEAN BLINKS AS WELL RIGHT 
UH SO YOU DON'T WANT A P UH PART OF THIS DATA 
YOU 
BUT 
I THINK YOU I THINK YOU SHOULD WELL THERE'S TWO VIEWS ON THIS 
UM IF YOU DO THEN THE PEOPLE FORMULATING RESEARCH QUESTIONS WILL ASK ABOUT THEM 
BUT IF YOU DON'T THEY'LL PROBABLY ASK ABOUT THEM ANYWAY AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO ADD 'EM AFTER THE FACT 
UH SO IT'S PROBABLY EASIER JUST TO S SHOVE 'EM IN 
YOU CAN STICK 'EM IN A DIFFERENT UM TRACK AND UH AND THEN LOAD 'EM OR NOT LOAD 'EM AS YOU PLEASE 
'CAUSE IT'S NOT WELL I DON'T KNOW 
WITH US TO USE IT PART OF USE THE THESE ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE SETS OF CODES AGAINST TIME RIGHT 
ISN'T BLINK A PART OF THIS 
YEAH 
BUT BUT ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE BLINKING BASICALLY IT'S LIKE IN A NIL CODE 
YOU C CAN'T FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING OTHERWISE 
SO IT MAY ACTUALLY BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE BLINKS REGISTERED IN THERE BECAUSE YOU MAY DISCOVER YOU NEED TO TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT TO SMOOTH SOME KIND OF ANALYSIS THAT YOU'RE DOING 
SO IT COULD BE THAT IF THEY ONLY THEY HADN'T HAD A BLINK JUST THEN THEY WOULD'VE BEEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
I'M THINKING MORE 
THAT YOU WANNA KNOW BUT 
UH I HOPE N NOT TOO MUCH RELIES ON MISSING STUFF 'CAUSE PEOPLE BLINK 
I WAS THINKING MORE LIKE UM YOU KNOW 
THE PERSON LOOKS A P A PART AND THEY'VE GOT A UH FIXATION BEFORE AND AFTER AND THERE'S BLINK IN THE MIDDLE 
AND YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE TIMES WHEN YOU WANNA TREAT THAT IS ONE THING RIGHT 
OH RIGHT 
OKAY 
SO BUT IN THAT CASE 
RIGHT UH-HUH 
NO THAT CASE THEN UM THESE TIERS ARE ALREADY LIKE BLINK CORRECTED 
AND THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BLINKS AS PART OF THIS 
YOU'D WANT BLINKS AS A SEPARATE TIER IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ONE 
YEAH 
YEAH SO THE KEY THING IS UH HERE IS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE 
AND UM THE SECOND KEY THING IS UM IT BETTER BE REALLY CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH THESE CODES UM UH W YEAH 
WHETHER ANY MONKEY BUSINESS HAS BEEN DONE AROUND THE BLINKS TO CORRECT FOR THAT 
UM 'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE OBVIOUS LOOKING AT THAT SET OF CODES THAT 
OH YEAH I SUPPOSE IF YOU KNOW ABOUT EYE TRACKERS THEN YOU'LL JUST KNOW 
BUT 
IT I THINK YOU'RE JUST SAYING IT COMES OUT OF THE EYE TRACKER ALREADY RIGHT 
THEY'RE ALREADY BLINK CORRECTED 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW IS LIKE TO WHAT STAGE IN THE EYE TRACKING STUFF WHERE IT DOES THAT AND WHETHER THAT GETS THROUGH IS THAT UM CRAIG GETS IT AUTOMATICALLY ON WHAT HE'S TRANSLATING OR TO G. D. F. 
WHETHER HE NEEDS TO READ THE SAME ANALYSIS BECAUSE SOMETHING ABOUT THE DATA PATH CUTS OFF THAT ANALYSIS FOR THE EYE TRACKER 
OR WHETHER WE EVEN LIKE IT RIGHT AND WANNA DO IT SOME DIFFERENT WAY 
YEAH 
BUT IT COULD BE THESE THINGS ARE CORRECTED FOR BLINKS IN THIS WAY PLUS THERE'S BLINK INFORMATION 
SO YOU KNOW IT IT TREATS IT IS A FIXATION AROUND BLINKS AND IT ALSO JUST HAPPENS TO TELL YOU WHERE THE BLINKS ARE 
'CAUSE AS THEY WERE SAYING THEY LIKE TO USE BLINK RATE AS MEASURES OF COGNITIVE DIFFICULTY OR SOMETHING 
SO 
IF THEY'RE NOT STILL FIXATING ON IT WHEN THEY COME BACK OUT OF THE BLINK THEN 
WHY IS THAT IS THAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO ANALYTICALLY 
OH RIGHT 
YEAH YOU SAID THAT 
WELL BUT DOES UM THE DURATION OF FIXATIONS COUNT FOR ANYTHING 
'CAUSE IT IF YOU'RE JUST ADDING THE LENGTH OF THE BLINK TO THE FIXATION YOU'RE NOT TREATING IT IS A SACCADE 
OKAY 
WAIT 
OKAY 
I KINDA GET THIS 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO MORE COMPLICATED THAN I THOUGHT 
I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE MULTIPLE FIXATIONS IN AN OBJECT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL IT'S NOT OKAY I MEAN THIS IS KINDA WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THIS CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT'S ON THE G. D. F. 
I MEAN YOU MIGHT USE IT IS THE INITIAL G. D. F. IS JUST WHATEVER STRAIGHT FORWARDLY TRANSLATES WITHOUT 
YOU KNOW WITHOUT TRANSFORMS WITH JUST THE DATA FORMAT CHANGING FROM THE ASCII 
AND THEN THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT GET ADDED THAT YOU MIGHT STILL WANT TO BE IN UM AUGMENTED G. D. F. FORMAT 
YOU KNOW LIKE THIS BLINK AND THE GAZE AND WHATEVER ELSE 
AND THEN YOU TRANSLATE TO N. X. T. 
SO YOU MIGHT STILL WANNA HAVE EVERYTHING IN THIS ONE G. D. F. FILE FORMAT THAT REPRESENTS EVERYTHING 
AND THEN THE N. X. T. THING IS JUST A SPLITTER 
IT'S NOT DOING ANY FANCY ANALYSIS 
SO I SEE THIS IS YOU KNOW 
A BUNCH OF LITTLE ROUTINES THAT TAKE THE THE G. D. F. WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION ON IT AND ADD NEW INFORMATION INTO THE SUB SCRIPT VERSIONS OF THE G. D. F. FILE THAT CONTAINS THESE POST PROCESS ANALYSES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I MEAN IT AT SOME EXTENT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH DATA FORMAT IT'S IN N. X. T. OR G. D. F. 
BUT IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR THE CONVERTER BETWEEN G. D. F. AND N. X. T. NOT TO ADD ANY DATA 
ALL IT DOES SO DO THIS THIS STUPID DATA FORMAT CONVERSION 
AND IT IT'S JUST YOU KNOW SEPARATING IT IT IN THE LITTLE STEPS 
SO YOU KNOW THERE HAVE TO BE THESE OTHER SCRIPTS THAT ADD ANY AMI DATA TRANSFORMS UM NOT DATA FORMAT TRANSFORM FORMS BUT DATA TRANSFORMS 
LIKE THIS IDEA OF UM OF PUTTING TOGETHER GAZES FROM FIXATIONS 
SO YOU YOU KNOW I IF WE KEEP IT SIMPLER LIKE THAT IS THAT IT'S IN LITTLE PIECES 
THEN IT'LL BE JUST EASIER TO UNDERSTAND W WHAT THE WH THE WHOLE THING DOES 
'CAUSE YOU YOU C YOU KNOW I IF SUDDENLY YOU DISCOVER THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE G. D. F. TO N. X. T. TRANSFORM 
YOU WANNA KNOW WHETHER IT'S ONE OF THESE LITTLE POST PROCESSES GOING WRONG OR WHETHER IT'S JUST THE THING THAT DUMPS IT INTO THE MULTIPLE FILES FOR THE END G. D. F. TO N. X. T. TRANSFORM IS C IS PRETTY SIMPLE 
SO UM YOU KNOW 
OH YEAH 
SO THAT'S LIKE ALL THE ANALYSIS THAT YOU NEED TO DO IT THINGS 
OR YOU JUST GONNA COPY WHAT THEY DO 
OR IS IT DOCUMENTED LIKE WHY THEY DID IT THEY WAY THEY DID IT 
OR IS IT JUST 
WELL IT'S GOOD STARTING POINT RIGHT 
SO IT'D BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF YOU AGREE WITH THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MADE ABOUT HOW TO DO THINGS 
MM 
OH 
WELL B BUT WE DON'T WANNA BUILD IT INTO OUR DATA PATH 
WE JUST WANNA LEARN FROM IT I THINK RIGHT 
CORRECT 
OR NO 
YEAH 
I'M JUST THINKING YOU KNOW LIKE I SEE THIS TAKES THE ASCII TO TO A D SIMPLIFIED ASCII 
AND SIMPLIFIED IN WITH TRANSFORMS IN IT ASCII AND IT'S JUST IT SEEMS TO BE HARDER TO MAINTAIN SOMETHING THAT'S GOT THAT IN IT IF IT'D BE BETTER TO BREAK THINGS UP INTO LIKE STEPS 
THAT YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE THE AND ALSO WELL WHY DO I THINK THIS 
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROGRAMME AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA GIVE US THE NEXT VERSION AND THAT'S GONNA BREAK OUR ENTIRE PIPELINE 
YOU KNOW 
THAT'S THE MAIN REASON 
YEAH 
OH YEAH I CAN IMAGINE I CAN IMAGINE THAT ALSO REQUIRING SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER WHAT THEY DO IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANNA DO 
THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING 
OH 
UH-HUH 
WELL SOUNDS GOOD 
YEAH 
AND IF IN DOUBT UM DON'T FILTER STUFF TO KEEP IT IN RIGHT 
'CAUSE WE ALWAYS DUMP IT AT THIS OTHER N. X. T. TRACK THAT WE DON'T NEED TO LOAD NECESSARILY 
SO UM THE IDEA SO YOU JUST KEEP STUFF UNLESS 
MM-HMM 
OH YEAH AND IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO DUMP STUFF INTO ONE INTO SEPARATE TRACK 
WE WE GOTTA TEACH YOU ABOUT THIS AT SOME POINT THOUGH 
SO UM BUT STILL NOT QUITE SURE WHEN 
IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE IN ANOTHER WEEK 
SO JONATHAN MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO ME TELL YOU ABOUT IT WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVED 'CAUSE YOU WERE GONNA GET OVERLOAD ABOUT LEARNING EYE TRACKERS AND ONE 
IT'S JUST TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE AND IT WASN'T IMPORTANT THAT TO BE THEN 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
HE'S A COOL CUSTOMER 
HE'S READY FOR IT 
OKAY 
I THINK WE'RE DONE RIGHT 
SORRY 
OH YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
I DO NOT REALLY NEED TO THIS JUST SAYS LOOK AT THE WIKI 
FIND OUT WHAT'S NEXT 
YOU COULD GIVE GIVE CRAIG MORE WORK TO DO 
THIS ONE'S MINE 
IT 
OH YEAH WELL THAT'LL TAKE FOREVER 
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY FUN 
CHECK YOUR BATTERIES 
YEAH IT SAYS 
SO IT SLIDING PAST 
YES 
STILL FIFTY SIX PERCENT COMPLETED 
SKIP IT 
'CAUSE I'M JUST DOING A B YEAH DISK CHECK OR SOMETHING 
YEP 
SO EVERYTHING GOING SMOOTH 
HMM 
MM 
AS LONG AS IT COMES OUT ON THE END 
THAT'S 
MM 
UH NOPE DON'T THINK SO 
UM 
MM-HMM 
UH IT'S BATTERIES WE'RE WAITING FOR 
TH THEY'RE THEY'RE D UH I I WAS TOLD THE BEGINNING OF THIS WEEK 
UM THE THEY ARE QUITE STRANGE 
MM UH UH IT'S W UH OUR UM A AVRIL HAS ORDERED THEM FROM SOMEWHERE POSSIBLY 
NO NO 
THEY'RE PROBABLY ONE FIFTY EACH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UH WELL HOPEFULLY 
TH THEY SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE LAST WEEK 
BUT UH CAROLINE THEN PHONED UP TO CHOOSE THEM AND THEY THEY WERE SO THEY WERE TOLD TO BE HERE 
SHOULD BE TODAY 
UH OR B WELL WE CAN STILL TEST WHETHER CAMTASIA RUNS ANYWAY 
IT'S JUST THE UH WHETHER IT'S THE MICROPHONES ARE PICKING UP THINGS CORRECTLY THAT WE NEED TO CHECK 
NOT YET NO 
RIGHT 
MM RIGHT O 
VIRTUAL 
YEP 
OH RIGHT 
BUT WHAT WE'RE 
I I 
MM-HMM 
IT IN IT'S TWO BATTERIES WE NEED 
OH NO NO 
NO 
YES 
FAIR FAIR ENOUGH IF YOU WANT 
MM-HMM 
IT'S STILL PROBABLY EVEN THAT ANGLE 
CAN'T REMEMBER THE WIKI 
DO UM 
THE ONLY THING THAT WELL THE THING THAT'S HOLDING IS UM SLIGHTLY UP SO UM CHECKING WHETHER JOE'S F FINISHED THAT THERE I THERE IS A WORKING UM MODEL BUILDER 
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S THE FINISHED FINISHED VERSION YET 
AND THE THE NINTH 
YEAH UH STILL HAD AN HOURS LEFT 
I WASN'T SURE UH IF IT WAS DOWN TO THE NUMBER OF HOURS OR WHETHER THIRTY FIRST OF OCTOBER F UH CERTAINLY UH UH OH RIGHT 
I THINK HE'S HAD SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN 
BUT UH NO I'VE N NI NIJMEGEN HAS GONE DEAD FOR ALL THOSE LAST TWO WEEKS 
WELL UH IT W E E ELLEN'S AWAY 
NO NO UM BUT I THINK WHAT THEY HAD WAS SOME BIG REVIEW 
UH A AND SO I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING BACK FROM THEM 
SO UH THE MODELS FOR 
YES UH-HUH 
WELL NO 
WELL WE DON'T NEED TO M MAKE THE THE PARTS ARE ALL THE STANDARD TANGRAM ONES I HAD BEFORE ANYWAY 
THE X. FIG THING'S ONLY WHEN WE COME TO BUILDING AIRPLANES AND NEW PECULIAR SHAPES 
UH BUT FOR THIS EXPERIMENT IT'S JUST THE TANGRAM TYPE UH TASK 
UM YEAH IF YOU GET RIGHT 
HOW ARE OF HOW RECENTLY THAT NOTHING I HAVEN'T I HEARD ANYTHING FROM JOE FOR A A WEEK OR SO ANYWAY 
SO 
YEAH 
THAT'S THAT'S NEWER THAN THE 
IT'S THE LAST THING WAS IN SP RESPONSE TO THE THING I WAS SAYING LAST WEEK ABOUT THE PARALLELOGRAM BEING THE WRONG WAY AROUND AND UH WE FROM THE MODEL BUILDER TO THE ACTUAL YEAH 
UM THAT NOTHING HAS I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING SINCE FROM OTHER SORT OF THE NETHERLANDS OR FROM YOU 
YEP 
UH SO UH BACK 
UH SO UH 
UH ONE RIGHT OKAY 
YEAH IT WAS AFTER IT WAS AFTER THAT THAT UH THERE WAS THE THING ABOUT UM W W WHY THE PARALLELOGRAM WAS THE WAS A MIRROR IMAGE 
MM-HMM 
YES 
YES OR AT L LAST UM SHE WAS MEANT TO HAVE HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY 
'CAUSE THEY DO THEY DO HAVE ACTUALLY RUN THINGS AND IT UH GET AN IDEA OF THE SORT OF STYLE AND TO CHECK THAT THEY'D BE ALRIGHT 
BUT ALL VERY QUIET 
YEAH 
OH NO IT HAS JUST BEEN EMAIL RATHER THAN UH IF IF THE TELEPHONE TYPE OF UH REQUEST 
BUT 
I'M DOWN FOR A WEEK 
WHAT'S THE SEVENTH IS A WEE A WEEK TODAY I THINK 
NEXT WEEK 
UM WELL UH I HAVEN'T BOOKED ANYBODY IN OR ANYTHING 
BUT UH THAT'S WHEN I'M HOPING 
WE HAVE BEEN OF COURSE PUT BACK A BIT BY THE EYE TRACKER GOING DOWN 
BUT UH WE'RE WE'RE NEEDING WE'RE CERTAINLY NEEDING SOME DATA ON THE BIG BY THE FIRST OF DECEMBER I THINK 
NO 
UM HOPEFULLY NOT 
THE ONLY OTHER SLIGHT COMPLICATION IS UM WHICH WILL BE B I THINK BROUGHT UP TO THE MEETING ON THURSDAY FOR ALL THE EYE TRACKING USERS 
UM UH THE LAB HAS BEEN BLOCK BOOKED AGAIN 
JULES FROM UM PSYCHOLOGY 
HAVE AUDIO 
YEP 
LECTURER 
WELL PRESUMABLY NOT 
BUT UH IT'S SORT OF QUITE SOLIDLY BOOKED UH FOR F CERTAINLY W WHAT SIX DAYS FROM TEN TILL FIVE FOR TWO OR THREE OF THESE DAYS 
UM I WOULDN'T I NO I CAN PROBABLY AT LEAST EMAIL HERE AND ASK HER UH IF SHE'S REALLY NEEDING IT ALL THAT TIME 
I I WILL YEAH AT THE UM YEP 
WHEN PEOPLE JUST UH IF THEY CAN LOG ON IT IT CAN BOOK IT 
MM-HMM 
UH I TH IN THEORY JAST IS MEANT TO HAVE TO EVERY MORNING 
UM BUT IT UH THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS OR OR ANYTHING 
NO 
OH NO 
THAT AS LONG AS P OTHER PEOPLE DON'T FOR SOME REASON I DON'T KNOW DISCONNECT SOME BITS OF THE EQUIPMENT THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD 
IT'S JUST THE 
OH YES IT'S UM IT'S IN THE P UH IT'S NOT IN THE BOOKING SYSTEM 
IT'S IN A WEB PAGE THAT FRANK CREATED ABOUT THE LAB 
WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS IS THERE 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
SHOULD SHOULD BE 
I'VE ALSO GET TO GET CAMTASIA W WELL YES THE UM THE MODEL BUILDER 
I'VE GOT TO GET CAMTASIA WORKING UM AS A SORT OF LITTLE MULTI MEDIA THING TO GENERATE A VIDEO OF HOW TO UM SORT OF A AN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO 
IT'S WHAT I'LL HAVE TO DO THIS WEEK 
HMM 
U 
YEP YEAH 
UH I'LL I'LL DO THAT 
YEAH AND JUST YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
HAVE A LOOK AT UH UM HOPEF HOPEFULLY THERE'S NOT A P A PROBLEM 
BUT UH THEY SAID MARLOES WAS UH ALSO MEANT TO BE CHECKING IT AND DOING THINGS AND QUIET 
UM I'VE I UH IT HASN'T BEEN DIVIDED UP ON THAT SORT OF WAY 
BUT 
UM DEPENDS HOW QUICKLY I MANAGE TO GET A GROUP OF IT HOW LONG IT TAKES ME TO GENERATE THEM OR HOW I GOT ONE WITH THE CAMTASIA 
MM-HMM 
UN UNSURE OF YET 
IT IT SHOULDN'T TH THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY GREAT UH PROBLEMS 
JUST CHECKING THAT THE THEY'RE OF A SUITABLE LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY OR OR OF WHATEVER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO QUITE QUITE RIGHT 
YEAH 
SO YEAH 
UM YEAH 
WELL I WAS HOPING FOR SOME FEEDBACK FROM YEAH 
YEAH EXACTLY 
YES 
YEP MM BOOK A TIME AND I THINK SO 
RIGHT 
WELL I'LL TRY AND GET AHOLD OF HER AGAIN TODAY AND SO WHAT 
I THINK IT IT WAS UP TILL THE END OF OCTOBER 
SO PRESUMABLY TODAY THEY'RE NOW FREE AGAIN 
OR TAKING A WEEK OFF TO RECOVER 
YES 
UM WELL HOPEFULLY IT IT WON'T ANYWAY 
IT'S JUST IF I THEN DO IT I HOPEFULLY WILL GET THE RIGHT MODELS 
THAT'S THAT'S THE PRO SO UH UH IT WILL BE GENERATED 
IT'S WHETHER THE MODELS ARE OPTIMAL OR NOT THAT I THINK THAT'S RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL SO IT WAS THE WHOLE ALL THE DYNAMIC REGION PART OF IT THAT'S UH 
MM-HMM 
OH NO UM ONE 
UH WELL IT DEPENDS HOW HOW MANY I CAN BOOK IN AND GET GET RUNNING 
YEAH 
AND BEFORE MY BRAIN MELTS IT BUT W WHEN WHEN THE EXPERIMENT'S RUNNING YEAH IT'S I'LL BE IN THE LAB 
UH I CAN'T JUST GO ON LET THEM GET START AND THEN COME BACK 
IT'S UH S SOME PEOPLE CAN BUT 
UH TH THEY'LL CERTAINLY BE TIME BECAUSE I'M RIGHT NEXT TO THE LAB ANYWAY I'LL COME BACK JUST TO CHECK MY EMAIL AND THINGS ANYWAY SO UH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH I WOULDN'T BOTHER MORE THAN ONE OR TWO CERTAINLY 
MM-HMM 
WE 
MM-HMM 
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE TWIDDLING YOUR THUMBS NO 
UM WELL AT TWELVE O'CLOCK NEXT MONDAY THE LAB IS TECHNICALLY BOOKED BY JULES 
IT 
UH IT STARTS THE UH NO WE THIS WEDNESDAY AND GOES THROUGH IT NEXT WEDNESDAY 
MM-HMM 
UM WHAT ELSE 
OH YEAH 
MY THEN OTHER COMPLICATION IS TWO WEEKS TOMORROW I START MY TEACHING 
MM-HMM 
FOR I'VE GOT TWO WEEKS OF THAT F FOUR LECTURES AND FOUR LABS 
YES 
UH WHAT'S TOMORROW IS THE F TOMORROW THE F FIRST 
SO IT WILL BE THE FIFTEENTH FOR TWO WEEKS 
OH YOU'VE GOT YOUR UH INDUCTION THAT'S RIGHT 
OH YES 
FROM A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME TO YOU KNOW 
MM-HMM 
IT'S PROBABLY THE UNIVERSITY'LL COVER ITSELF LEGALLY I THINK BY DOING THIS 
UH MM-HMM 
OH NO I SUPPOSE RATHER THAN BEING NOBODY'S BOTHERED SO FAR AS IT 
UH WELL I DON'T REMEMBER BEING ASKED FOR AN INDICATION 
SO 
IN PERL 
I GOT INVITED TO A UM A A A SUMMER GARDEN PARTY FOR NEW STAFF MEMBERS 
BUT THAT WAS BUT THAT'S ALL 
HMM 
UH UH 
I HAVE ONE N. X. T. QUESTION WHICH HOPEFULLY WON'T BE WELL IT'S NOT IN 
JUST HOPEFULLY AS PART OF THE OUTPUT IT WILL BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO THAT CORRECT 
SO YOU'VE GOT THE GAZE POSITION OF THE FIRST PERSON GAZE POSITION OF THE SECOND MOUSE POSITION OF THE FIRST 
MOUSE POSITION OF THE SECOND AND I DON'T KNOW A COMMON MOUSE ACTION THERE OR SOMETHING 
DOES THAT IT JUST ONE ONE SORT OF LAYERS LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
YEP 
YES UH-HUH 
UM THAT'S THAT'S JUST THE THE EYE MOVEMENT UH OTHER SORT OF STUFF YEAH 
IT HO HOPEFU UH HOPEFULLY THAT'S YEAH I GUESS IT'S THAT'S WHY I DRE 
AS WELL 
YEAH MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO I WAS JUST YEAH 
I WAS JUST CHECKING THAT UH I KNOW THE LANGUAGE PART BECAUSE THEY SAY L. P. HERE BUT UH THIS WOULD BE THE THE THE NEW PART 
NEW STUFF 
OH YEAH WHATEVER THAT IS 
UM YES I'M NOT SURE WHETHER WE NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE JUST HOW MANY THERE ARE IN EACH TRA UM UH P I DON'T KNOW 
I SUPPOSE IT COULD GO ON 
UH I MEAN I SUPPOSE IT WE'RE AS WELL TO HAVE TO IF WE CAN 
RIGHT 
WELL UH JUST SAY STICK 'EM IN ANYWAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM BLINK WOULD UH UH AT THE MOMENT JUST GET LUMPED IN WITH THE SORT OF PREVIOUS GAZE 
MM-HMM 
THE WAY THEY'RE LOOKING MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM UH YES MM-HMM 
MOVING SOMEWHERE ELSE OR IS MORE LIKELY TO BE UH 
BLINKING AT THE SAME TIME IS THE OTHER PERSON WAS DOING SOMETHING I THINK IT MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YES 
NORMAN NORMALLY UH WOULD BE JUST SO I SAY LIKE ADD THE BLINK TIME AND DURATION TO THE PREVIOUS FIXATION 
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT ABSORBING ANY NEW INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHAT THE CRITICAL SORT OF DECIDING FACTOR SO 
YES SO THAT THEY'LL INCLUDE THE 
SO I I YEAH WOULD UH IT WOULD BE AS A SEPARATE TIER WHERE JUST TO MARK 
THE ACTUAL POSITION 
MM-HMM 
WHAT'S INCLUDED AND WHAT'S ON YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
NO NOT CERTAINLY L NOT LOOKING AT CODES NO 
MM-HMM 
KNOW WHAT IT LIKE FOR AND WHAT NOT TOO YEAH 
UH I THERE ARE WELL THEY'RE ALREADY IDENTIFIED AS BLINKS 
THEN IT'S UH I IT IS TO THE HMM AT WHAT STAGE 
THE SOFTWARE THAT I'VE USED UH P POOLS UH THE BLINKS AS WELL DID IT IN 
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE DEFAULT 
YES 
YEAH SO I'M NOT SO I CERTAINLY IT'S LISTED AS A SEPARATE EVENT ON THE STREAM 
BLINKS ARE A TAG UH FROM THE I. D. F. AND AND THAT SORT OF THING 
IT'S REGISTERED AS A A DETECTION 
BUT 
MM 
MM-HMM 
UH I Y YEAH 
UH I MEAN IT IT IT WON'T BECAUSE OF THE FIXATION IT WILL BE DOWN TO WHAT WE DEFINE AS UH A GAZE 
SO BASICALLY THE TIME FRAME WHEN SOMEBODY STARTS LOOKING AT AN OBJECT UNTIL THEY LEAVE IT 
AND SO IF THEY BLINKED A LOT WITHIN THAT THEY'RE STILL LOOKING AT THAT OBJECT 
SO IT'S JUST THE TIME IN AT THE TIME IT 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
SOME OTHER WAY 
YES 
MM-HMM 
YEP THERE'S A BLINK SORT OF EVENT 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
IT SHOULD JUST BE A MATTER OF TREATING A B ADDING IN THE BLINK TO THE LAST FIXATION OR SOMETHING ANYWAY 
UH WELL UH THE THE REAL REASON IS UM AS LONG AS THEY'VE BEEN BLINKING 
EVEN IF THEY THEN OPEN THEIR EYES SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT'S WHEN THEY START ABSORBING THE NEW INFORMATION 
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE A JUST A LONG SACCADE 
MM IT YOU KIND OF HAVE VISUAL SUPPRESSION WHEN YOU MOVE AND IT'S THE SAME WHEN YOU'RE BLINKING 
YOU'RE NOT TAKING ANYTHING IN 
SO 
UH IT IT'S YEAH THAT YES UM THAT'S FOR THE SORT OF GAZE TIME MEASURE 
UH IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE FIXATIONS ARE STILL UM INDEPENDENT 
SO TH THEY W FIXATION DURATION ISN'T DOESN'T INCLUDE THE BLINK IN THE ASCII A OUTPUT 
IT'S ONLY WHEN WE START LOOKING AT SORT OF THE TOTAL GAZE THAT UM THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT LOOKING AT ONE PARTICULAR OBJECT 
WHICH INCLUDES ALL THESE SORT OF MULTIPLE FIXATIONS AND ANY BLINKS AND THAT SORT OF THING 
SO IT IT'S A A SORT OF COMPOSITE UH VIEWING TIME 
OH YEAH I'M AFRAID UH MM-HMM 
YEP YEP 
ALTHOUGH WE'LL ALSO STILL NEED A CENT OF THE FIXATIONS JUST SO WE CAN HAVE YOU YOU'VE GOT MEASURE FIXATION DURATION AGAIN JUST TO USE IS OF THOSE THEY SPEND LONGER JUST F AMOUNT OF MORE STABLE MOVE UH EYE FIXATION OR NOT 
OH 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
IT YOU YEAH MM-HMM 
VIEWING TIMES 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL THAT'S PARTLY WHY I BROUGHT THIS UP NOW IS IT I'M NOT SURE WHAT POINT DOWN THE DATA PATH THINGS SORT OF HAPPEN 
BUT THAT'S WHAT I WANT IT IN THE END 
UM WELL THE N. X. T. STUFF WILL HAVE THE MORE COMPLETE PICTURE 'CAUSE IT WILL INCLUDE COMBINE ALL THE LINGUISTIC STUFF WITH ALL THE MOVEMENTS AND THE ACTIONS 
UM BUT THERE'LL BE I SUPPOSE JUST SOME PURELY EYE MOVEMENT STUFF WE COULD DO 
I S PRESUMABLY WITH G. D. F. 
OH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
C 
NO 
AND UH YEAH 
THAT'S ALSO WHY I SENT YOU THE MM SAARBRUECKEN SOFTWARE OF THAT UH THE STUFF THAT TAKES THE ASCII SORT OF FORMAT ORIGINALLY AND THEN JUST UH SORT OF COMPRESSES IT AND THINGS 
YEAH THE GERMAN STUFF 
UH BECAUSE THAT LITTLE UTILITY UM DOES THINGS LIKE IT WILL BUT YOU CAN TELL IT OUT WHAT TO DO WITH BLINKS 
WHETHER JUST TO LUMP THEM IN OR OR NOT 
UH WHAT THE MINIMUM FIXATION DURATION FOR A STABLE FIXATION WOULD BE SORT OF YOU HAVE IF IT PICKS UP TO FIXATIONS LESS THAN SAY FIFTY MILLISECONDS 
YOU CAN TELL IT JUST IT AGAIN LUMP THEM ALL TOGETHER THAT'S NOT A SORT OF RELIABLE ENOUGH FIXATION 
UH YOU CAN PUT IN THIS SORT OF OF THINGS 
SO THAT'S UH THAT'S A BIT OF SOFTWARE THAT'S SENT AND THAT INCLUDES THE SOURCE CODE AND THINGS AS WELL 
MM-HMM 
OH NO THERE'S VERY LITTLE DOCUMENTATION AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE FOR THIS SORT OF THINGS 
YEAH SO I G I UH YEAH 
THAT'S THAT'S WHY 
SO MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
FINE 
GOOD 
MM-HMM 
'CAUSE UH AL ALSO JUST FILTERS IT 
THERE ARE A LOT OF UM STRANGE EVENT TAGS THAT THE EYE LINK PRODUCES THAT ARE FAIRLY MEANINGLESS I THINK 
AND IT CAN STORE IT STRIPS OUT A LOT OF THE JUNK UH AS WELL 
SO IT CLEANS IT UP 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
RIGHT 
UH BE FINE 
WELL UM POSSIBLY 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THE PRO 
OH YEAH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
SIX OR 
MM-HMM 
IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE AS IT SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE QUITE GRABBABLE 'CAUSE IT SO IT'S WRITTEN IN JAVA 
YEAH WELL YES UH-HUH THE ACTUAL UH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER THAN MAKING TOO MUCH COMPRESSION TO START WITH AND THEN BEING OUT OF UNABLE TO GO BACK OR YEAH 
LOSSINESS 
OR OR YOU LEAVE VERY QUICKLY 
UH-HUH 
YEP 
WELL I'M I UM 
OH DEAR 
OH MY PAGE IS BLANK STILL 
I GUESS NOT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL UH I WAS EXPECTING TO GET YEAH THOUGH AND I DID DID MAKE IT IN TIME 
BUT IT JUST JUST 'CAUSE ALL THE LEAVES AND THINGS 
UM THE STORE THE TRAINS WEREN'T STOPPING AT THE STATIONS 
SO THEY DECIDED TO PUT SPEED RESTRICTIONS ON 
YEP 
YEAH 
'CAUSE APAR APAR APPARENTLY P UH I'M NOT SURE 
UM THE AND THEY'RE BUSSING PEOPLE INTO STATION HAVE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS ON IT 'CAUSE IT'S IN A 'CAUSE IT'S IN A HILL OR SOMETHING 
UM SO I HAD SO I HAD TO BUS PEOPLE IN FROM LIKE STATIONS EITHER SIDE 
YES YES 
BUT YEAH IT L AT LEAST IT WAS SPEED RESTRICTIONS INSTEAD OF LIKE TRAINS FLYING PAST INTO BARRIERS AND THINGS 
SO 
UH F YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL YOU KNOW APA PA APART FROM APART ALL APART FROM WAITING FOR THE GET GET CAMTASIA SORTED OUT 
YEAH I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T ADDED ANYTHING TO THE WIKI RECENTLY 
SO UH 'CAUSE I'VE WE'VE BEEN BEEN WORKING ON TRYING TO GET THE X. M. L. STUFF WORKING 
SO SOME THE BA BASICALLY THEY ONLY HAD TO HOW THE DOM WORKS UM SO I CAN DO THE NEXT SO I CAN GE GENERATE D. D. F. FILES 
HUH 
UM SO SO THE YEAH SO JUST JUST BEEN READING THROUGH DOCUMENTATION 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING THE END OF LAST WEEK UM JUST SO I KNOW HOW IT ALL WORKS AND FIGURING OUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THINGS 
UM BUT I'M AT THE MOMENT I'VE I'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH THE DOM STUFF IN MOZILLA 
UH 'CAUSE I 'CAUSE UH JU JUST SO AT LEAST I CAN SEE HOW IT WORKS WITH THE H. T. M. L. PAGES SO I CAN GENERATE UM THE X. SO I CAN GENERATE X. H. T. M. L. STUFF AND SEE HOW IT ALL WORKS THERE 
JUST 'CAUSE IT JUST SEE HOW THINGS WORK ON THAT UM AND 
IT WILL THING IS THAT THE A. THE A. WELL THE I. P. A. IS STANDARDIZED BY THE W. THREE C. 
SO THE I. P. A. IS STAN IS STANDARD BETWEEN EVERYTHING 
UM 
UH OR 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
IT IS 
IT IT JUST HAS A COUPLE OF YEAH YEAH 
UM WELL YEAH BUT IF THEY WILL BE ABOUT IT DOE DOES LOOK LIKE IT DOES DOES THAT THIS IS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO I WAS DOING THE SO ANYWAY 
UM IT'S JU IT'S JUST THAT THAT'S THAT'S QUITE A QUICK WAY TO JUST TO GET INTO HOW HOW WORKS 
BECAUSE I CAN JUST QUICKLY GENERATE QUICKLY GENERATE A WEB PAGE AND THEN JUST ADD AND TAKE YEAH 
ADD THINGS OUT AND TAKE THINGS AWAY AND DON'T SEE EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON TO THE TIME 
SO 
UH WELL JUST 'CAUSE X. H. T. M. L. HAS A NICE YOU KNOW YOU GOT BROWSERS THERE IS YOU CAN ACTUALLY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE DIRECTLY WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON 
YEAH WELL I'LL I'M USING X. H. T. M. L. UH TO DETER THAT'S UH ALL ALL THE WEB PAGES ARE X. H. T. M. L. 
SO IT'S X. M. L. JUST WITH THE H. T. M. L. D. T. D. 
YEAH 
J J J JUST BE JUST 'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T UH WE HAVEN'T F HAVEN'T QUITE FINALISED THE UM THE G. D. F. FORMAT 
SO JUST JUST WILL JUST 
YEAH YEAH 
SO ALL HAVE TO DO IS JUST CHANGE TO CHANGE THAT SORT OF THING IS IT'S UH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT 
UM THAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT I'M DOING THE MOMENT I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE USE THE UH STUFF THAT ROBIN PUT IN THE WIKI TO SAY WHAT'S 
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE NEED ON THE ON THE TO UM IN THE OUTPUT FORMAT FOR THE FOR THE TASK YOU KNOW 
SO WHAT WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO THE ANALYSIS ON 
UM SO I'M MAKING SURE THAT I CAN TAKE GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OF THE G. D. F. S TO ST STATE OF THE MOMENT 
AND IF I FIND SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT THEN I CAN ADD THAT AT THE ADD THAT AT THE G. D. F. FORMAT 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH WELL THE 
WELL I'M I'M I'M JU TRY I'M MAKING SURE THAT THE G. D. F. FORMAT WE'VE GOT TO THE MOMENT WILL DO WILL OUTPUT SAY WELL I'VE OUTPUT OLD ANALYSIS THAT THAT ROBIN'S LOOKING FOR 
UM SO SO I'M SEEING THAT IS A WAY TO TO GET INTO UH UH USING THE DOM THINGS AS WELL 
UM SO YEAH 
SO AT THE MOMENT I'M LOOKING AT ACT ACTUALLY THE G. D. F. FORMAT ITSELF UM AND THEN TO GENERATE THE G. D. F. FORMAT I'M GONNA BE TAKING STUFF OUT OF THE GEST ANALYSER UM AND THEN USING A DOM PARSER TO GENERATE UH X. M. L. OUTPUT FROM THE GEST ANALYSER 
OH NO 
NO 
BUT UH I'LL WHEN AND OUT OF THE OUTPUT OF THE GEST ANALYSER DOES DOES DO SOME OF THE PROCESSING ALREADY 
WHICH IS WHAT I'LL M PLAN TO USE THAT IS THE BASIS FOR IT 
'CAUSE THAT ALREADY THAT ALREADY PICKS UP LIKE TARGET REGIONS THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO YOU GOT IS IS IT KNOWS WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PART OR WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT TARGET AREA OR WHITE OR WHATEVER 
UM SO YES AS LONG AS TO GET THAT IN IT SOMEWHERE 
SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PULLING THAT IT AND PUT THAT INTO THE UM INTO THE G. D. F. STUFF 
YEP 
YEAH UM BE 
YEAH YEAH 
I AM I THINK THE O THE ONLY THING I'VE GOT LEFT TO DO BEFORE THE EXPERIMENTS CAN BE RUN IS GET IS IS GET THE CHECK CAMTASIA WORKS 
UM NOW I'VE GOT CAMTASIA RUNNING ON MACHINES AND I THINK THEY'RE SET UP CORRECTLY 
BUT I CAN'T TEST IT UNTIL WE GET THE MICROPHONES WORKING 
MICROPHONES 
'CAUSE 
OH 
WELL UH MUST SOME THESE DAYS ANYWAY ISN'T IT 
SO SO 
YEAH 
SO WE ALL GET OFF EASY 
YEAH 
UH WILL C I CAN SAY I CAN SAY GET TO MAPL UH TO MAPLIN I KNOW WHERE IT IS OFF I USED TO LIVE THERE 
SO I KNOW I KNOW WHERE I USED TO LIVE HERE 
I'M A GEEK 
I KNOW WHERE I KNOW WHERE MAPLIN IS 
YEAH 
WELL I SUPPOSE I COULD GO I COULD GIVE YOU A CALL ON THE WAY IN TOMORROW AND OF THE NOT BE IT'S NOT BEEN IN YOUR IN YOUR F UM PIGEON HOLE 
I CAN SAY GO OFF THE TRAIN AND EARLY AND JUST PICK 'EM UP FROM THERE 
RIGHT YEAH 
WELL I'LL MAKE SURE I MAKE A I'LL MAKE SURE IF I GOT THE OF THE PHONE NUMBER IN MY PHONE SO I CAN CALL THEM 
ALL TRUE 
TRUE 
UM UH IT'S DALRY ROAD ISN'T IT 
UM 
I T I'D SAY YOU DON'T BE 
MM 
YEAH YEAH 
SCREEN SHOTS 
YEAH YEAH 
OH 
HMM 
WELL I'M I'M USING DICE MACHINES 
IF HE WANTS TO POP IN FOUR FIVE MINUTES THE THE WINDOWS MACHINE IS FOR FOR HIM TO THE MOMENT 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN I CONSIDERING WE GOT AN EMAIL FROM UH TH I THINK IT GOT SENT THROUGH SAYING THAT HE'D UPDATED THE THE WHATEVER IT WAS IN THE WIKI 
SO YOU DO HE'D HE'D UPLOADED A IN A NEW ZIP FILE AND OVERWRITTEN THE OLD ONE 
SO 
YEP 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL WHEN THE WHOLE THING WAS IF IT WAS GONNA RUN A TRIAL THAT'LL GIVE YOU SOME SOME SCREEN SHOTS TO WORK WITH 
AND THEN IT'LL JUST BE A MATTER OF ADDING NEW VIDEO F MOUSE MOVEMENTS OR WHATEVER 
SO 
UH HAVE A LOOK 
IF YOU THE ANYTHING PROB ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT UM THINK THERE'S A WIKI PAGE UP FOR THAT F FOR THAT PIECE OF UH FOR YEAH FOR THAT THING 
SO IF IF YOU JUST PUT JUST PUT WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS BUGS ON THAT PAGE AND I'LL WORK THROUGH THEM READ 'EM AS AND WHEN I CAN 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
UM 
YEAH 
AND LIKE THIS YEAH I MEAN I'VE USED THE SOFTWARE AND THERE'S NOT THAT HARD I MEAN 
OH 
YEAH 
IF 
YEAH 
AS WELL I CAN'T IMAGINE THE BUILDING THE BUILDING THE MOLD IS GONNA BE THAT HARD 
I MEAN I CAN EASILY JUST WELL HOWEVER MANY THOUSANDS ARE IN THAT UH DUTCH WEB SITE YOU FIND 
JUST YOU KNOW PICK PICK SOME OF THEM REDO THEM IN IN THE JA IN THE J. C. D. FORMAT 
THAT'S YEAH 
IT'S PRETTY MECHANICAL 
I CAN EASILY D EASILY DO THAT 
SO BUT IT'S A MATTER OF CHOOSING WHICH ONES YOU NEED TO DO 
WHICH I GUESS YOU HAVE TO DO 
WELL YEAH 
YEAH WELL YOU NEED TO YOU YOU AND MARLOES NEED TO SORT OUT YEAH 
UM I DON'T THINK DON'T THINK SO 
I MEAN UH IS THE THE MAJOR THING I'VE GOTTA DO GET TO DO IS GET THIS CAMTASIA SORTED OUT 
SO JUST WAITING FOR THE BATTERIES FOR THAT 
UM IF ROBIN'S NOT WORRIED I'M NOT WORRIED 
UM 
UM UP 
YEAH YEAH 'CAUSE I'LL GO GOTTA FINALISE THAT FORMAT AND THEN ONCE THAT'S DONE I'VE GOTTA START LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS SIDE OF IT 
AND THAT'S 
YEAH 
UM 
YEAH YEAH 
I THINK YEAH 
IN THE THE ANALYSIS I THINK THE ANALYSIS WILL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE 
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE THAT LONG TO GET ITS STUFF SORTED OUT 
IT'S GONNA BE HOW TO DISPLAY IT AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF 
UH WHATEVER MAKES IT EASIEST FOR YOU TO DO 
UM BUT ONCE WE 
HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
UM YEAH SO I STILL GOTTA WORK ON THE GEST ANALYZER AND TURN THAT INTO THE IT INTO A G. D. F. OUTPUTTER 
UM AND UH UH YEAH AND I'LL I CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE MODEL BUILDER AS WELL 
UM 'CAUSE ONE THING I'M THINKING ABOUT SO WE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE THE PART BUILDING PA TYPE STUFF 
UH AND IT MIGHT WORTH SEEING IF WE CAN ADD A LITTLE PART BUILDER THING INTO THE UM MODEL BUILDER 
UM JUST JUST THE JU I JUST GOTTA TIDY TIDY UP SOME THE CODE FOR GENERATING THE PARTS ANYWAY THE J. C. T. UM PARTS FROM FROM S. V. G. S 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
BUT I'LL WANNA HAVE A QUI HAVE A QUICK LOOK AND SO SO HOW EASY TO USE TO ADD THESE THINGS TO IT 
'CAUSE UM IF IF I CAN USE IT TO GENERATE UM UM THE ROTSYM ANGLE FOR EXAMPLE AND THE ROTATION SYMMETRY STUFF FOR IT 
WHICH IS WHAT WAS CAUSING THE BUGS UH BEFORE 
UM SO IF I IF I CAN USE THE MODEL BUILDER TO AUTOMATICALLY DO THAT THEN THAT WOULD USE THAT WOULD SAVE QUITE A BIT OF WORK AND IT'LL D SAVE A FEW BUGS 
SO 
NO 
IT'S UH IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU GOTTA REMEMBER ONCE THE PART'S BEEN BUILT 
SO UM 
YEAH YEAH 
WELL I'M NOT NOT NOT PL NOT PLANNING DO MUCH ON THAT 
IT'S JUST 
YEAH 
I MEAN I'VE I'VE ALREADY I'VE ALREADY GOT THIS YEAH 
YEAH THERE I SAW SAW SAW SAW SOMETHING ABOUT MAP TASK LIKE LITTLE FURTHER DOWN MY TASK LIST 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH WELL THAT THAT'S THAT'S JUST X. M. L. TO X. M. L. TO X. M. L. ISN'T IT 
TURNING G. D. F. AND WHAT OTHER BITS INTO N. X. T. 
YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT RIGHT 
UM YEAH 'CAUSE THAT'S THE YEAH O OTHER THAN YOU HAVE FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT TO USE BOTH X. M. L. 
SO THE THE PROGRAMMING SIDE OF IT DOESN'T SOUND TOO HARD 
IT'S GONNA BE MAKING SURE THAT IT FITS WHAT YOU EXPECT OUT OF THE FORMAT 
SO UM BUT NO THAT'S THAT'S FINE 
I'LL DO I'LL HAVE TRY TO FIND I'LL I'LL HAVE PLEN PLENTY OF UH PLENTY OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU ONCE I ONCE I GOT TO THE LAST STAGE 
I'M SURE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WE'LL 
YEAH 
WELL TH WE'RE GONNA GET CAMTASIA SORTED OUT THIS WEEK AND THEN IT'S CONCENTRATE ON THE ON THE GEST ANALYZER THE G. D. F. STUFF 
UM AND THEN YEAH 
ONCE ONCE WE'VE DONE THAT IT'S WHATEVER WHATEVER YOU WHATE WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOU WANT ME DO ONCE I DON THE ONCE I'VE DONE THE G. D. F. I GUESS 
YEP 
YEAH SO I THINK THE G. D. F. WILL KEEP ME BUSY FOR A LITTLE WHILE YET 
SO UM YEAH WELL THAT'S YEAH 
CERTAINLY KEEP ME BUSY UNTIL THIS TIME NEXT WEEK WHEN WE CAN START SUGGESTING THINGS THAT MIGHT MIGHT NEED TO LOOK AT FOR THE NEXT STAGE I GUESS 
YEP 
OKAY 
YEAH 
FOR THE FIRST YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
ACTUALLY YEAH THAT REMINDS ME I W W I W I WON'T BE UH ON THURSDAY I'M GONNA BE OVER IN MY INDUCTION DAY 
SO SO 
FAIR ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH 
I MEAN UH I DON'T IT'S MEANT TO BE THAT IN DEPTH 
IT'S 
YES YES 
I MEAN I D I DON'T EXPECT TO BE THAT IN DEPTH 
I MEAN IT'S FIFTEEN MINUTES IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TOPICS 
SO IT'S JUST IT'S UH TO USE 
OH YES IT IS 
I'M SURE MOST OF IT I ALREADY KNOW 
IT'S LIKE FIRE SAFETY 
YEAH 
HEALTH SAFETY DATA PROTECTION 
USUAL SORT OF STUFF YOU GET EVERYWHERE 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH I MEAN I CAN ROOM 
YEAH I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I START BEING A SET WHEN I WAS STA STARTING BEING A STUDENT 
I MEAN UH WE HAD THE INDUCTIONS WERE COMPULSORY BECAUSE UM A LOT OF STUDENTS WERE DOING IT WERE DOING TEACHING 
AND YOU COULDN'T DO THE TEACHING UNLESS YOU DONE THE INDUCTION BECAUSE YOU HAD TO KNOW ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY AND FIRE SAFETY BEFORE YOU COULD TAKE A CHARGE OF YEAH 
'CAUSE YOU WERE THE RESPONSIBLE PERSON IN THE ON THE CLASS ROOM 
SO 
SO BUT UH YEAH I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT SURE WHY THE WHY WHY I'M DOING IT NOW 
BUT OKAY 
SO SO HOW TO GO 
I'LL I'LL UH GIVE YOU MY REPORT ON FRIDAY OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO SO THAT MEAN YOU NEED THE BLINK CORRECTIONS PART OF THE ANALYSIS THEN 
UM 
RIGHT 
SO THA THA THAT'S UH THAT'S FOR THE REST OF THE STUFF THAT COMES THE EYE TRACKER ISN'T THE ANALYZER SOFTWARE THAT COMES THE EYE TRACKER 
RIGHT 
RIGHT OKAY 
WELL I I IF IF YOU WANT IF YOU WANT THE BLINKS MER MERGED INTO A FIXATION 
IT MIGHT WORTH MAKING MAKING A CR PART OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE G. D. F. STUFF 
SO TO REMIND ME IS IT IT JUST ADD THAT ANALYSIS IT YEAH IT IT IT 
SO IT'S I MEAN IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO DO JUST CHE JUST CHECKING THE TIMES THE TIMES OF THE EVENTS 
RIGHT 
OKAY OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 'CAUSE I THINK THE ASCII FORMAT IS IT STANDS DOES CONTAIN BLINK INFORMATION UM 'CAUSE UH D D I'M SURE I'M SURE THAT'S APPEARED IN THE ON THE DOCUMENTATION I'VE READ THROUGH 
POSSIBLY 
POSSIBLY YEAH 
RIGHT 
OKAY OKAY 
UM YEAH 
SO MIGHT MIGHT WORTH IS IS HAVING A LOOK AT THAT AND JUST JUST SEEING WHAT DATA IS WHAT DATA IS ALREADY ON THE ASCII FORMAT AND WHETHER YOU WANT ME TO DO ANY CORRECTION AS PART OF THE ANALYSIS 
UM 'CAUSE I'VE GOTTA DO THE ANALYSIS FOR THE FIXATIONS ON PARTS AND THINGS ANYWAY 
SO YEAH I D I I I DIDN'T THINK CHECK FOR BLINKS DURING THAT 
ISN'T GONNA BE A SHOULDN'T BE A BIG PROBLEM 
YEAH 
YEP 
UM SO WE'LL BE 
RIGHT MM-HMM 
AND SO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A FINAL THING THAT JUST SORT SAYS BETWEEN THIS TIME AND THIS TIME YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS OBJECT 
BETWEEN THIS TIME THIS TIME YOU'RE NOT LOOKING ANYTHING 
AND 
YEAH YEAH 
'CAUSE I THINK I THINK AT THE MOMENT THE G. D. F. FORMAT HAS FIXATIONS ON IT 
UM SO SO I G I GUESS THAT'D BE PART OF THE G. D. F. TO TRANSFORMATION WOULD BE TURNING FIXATIONS INTO GAZES AND WHATEVER ELSE 
OKAY OKAY 
WELL TH TH DON'T DON'T UH WORRY ABOUT THAT JUST THE MOMENT 
BUT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
SO SO SO WE WILL YOU ACTUALLY BE DOING MUCH OF THE G. D. F. 
OR S OR YOU EXPECTING DO MOST THE ANALYSIS ON OUT OF THE N. X. T. STUFF THEN 
SO WHE WHEN YOU UH WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GENERATE YOUR RESULTS 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
C WELL YEAH 
YOU TOLD THAT EARLIER 'CAUSE YOU COULD DO A QUICK ANA YOU COULD DO A QUICK ANALYSIS ON THE G. D. F. STUFF WITHOUT HAVING IT BEFORE YOU HIT BEFORE YOU DO THE DIALOGUE ANALYSIS TYPE STUFF 
SO YOU CAN GET SOME SOME RESULTS ANYWAY CAN'T YOU 
OKAY 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
OKAY OKAY 
RIGHT 
OH YEAH YEAH 
THE GERMANS DON'T YEAH YEAH YEAH 
FAIR ENOUGH FOR ONE 
YEAH SO SO THEY THEY WE'RE ALLOWED TO DO WHATEVER WITHOUT WITHOUT SOURCE CODE 
THERE'S NO C SORT OF RESTRICTIONS ON THAT 
FAIR ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH 
YEAH I SUPPOSE I CAN SAY LOOK THROUGH AND START WRITING UP SOME DOCUMENTATION ON IT 
THAT'LL GI THAT'LL GIVE US A STARTING POINT FOUR IS IT SORT TO TALK ABOUT IT TO LOOK FOR WHAT ANALYSIS WE N ACTUALLY NEED TO DO ON IT AND THINGS 
UM YEAH EASY 
C YEAH CREATE ALL THE UH SWITCHES AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU NEED TO DO 
SO UM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SO WE'LL NOI NICE YEAH 
WELL ONCE I'VE HAD ONCE I'VE HAD A BIT OF BIT MORE LIKE TO THIS G. D. F. STUFF THEN START LOOKING THROUGH THAT 
START LOOKING THROUGH THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT WORKS 
'CAUSE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
I'VE LO YEAH I'VE NO NO NOTICED THAT THE THE THE GEST ANALYSER KNOWS QUITE A FEW THINGS AS WELL 
SO UM BUT SO 
YEAH 
WELL UH I SEE IT THAT USEFUL FOR GENERATING THIS G. D. F. STUFF 
I CAN EASILY INCORPORATE WHATEVER FUNCTIONS IT TAKES FROM INTO GEST ANALYSER WHEN I'M DO DOING THE G. D. F. STUFF 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
I MEAN BUT WHAT YEAH SAY WHAT WHAT I'LL WHAT I'LL PLAN TO DO WITH IT THEN IS TAKE THE S TAKE OUT THE SOFTWARE 
FIND OUT WHAT FUNCTIONS ARE USEFUL FOR US IN THAT 
AND THEN USE THESE FUNCTIONS TO GENERATE THE STUFF THAT GOES INTO THE X. M. L. FILE THE THE G. F. FORMAT 
YEAH YEAH 
SO SO THE FIR FIR FIRST PART THAT'LL BE DOCUMENTING WHAT THEY'VE GOT AND THEN DISCUSSING IT WITH ROBIN 
SO UH YEAH 
SO SO I SUPPOSE POSE THAT THAT WAY THE 
RIGHT 
BUT YEAH WELL I TR MO MOSTLY YEAH 
I'M SURE I SURE MOST THE LOGIC'S GONNA BE GONNA BE THE SAME 
SO UM 
RIGHT 
YEAH FAIR ENOUGH 
YEAH FAIR ENOUGH 
WELL SO SO IT'S AS LONG AS IT'S X. M. L. N. X. T. WILL HANDLE IT WON'T IT 
'CAUSE 
YEP 
FAIR ENOUGH 
OKAY OKAY 
YEAH 
WELL I'M WELL I'M WELL G I'VE GOT THE HANG OF ALL THE STUFF I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE L LOOKS LIKE I'M COMING OUT AND OF THE STUFF THE STUFF LIST THERE ALREADY 
SO I'M GONNA HAVE START LOOKING AT THAT IS THE NEXT STAGE 
SO 
YEP 
WELL I AM I AM I MAY BE MAYBE I WANT TO CHECK OUT THIS BATTERIES AND THINGS WON'T I 
SO TOMORROW 
WELL THAT'LL BE SOMETHING TO DO 
WELL WELL WELL THE WELL THE WELL WELL IDEA OF THE TRAINS ARE THE SO BAD SO TODAY 
SO 
YEAH 
SO THIS WAS THAT FACE TO FACE MEETING 
UM BUT IT UH IT DOESN'T 
THERE ISN'T THE IS THERE ARE THINGS IN THE EYE TRACKER RECORD THAT WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT IN THE G. D. F. FORMAT UM LIKE THE FRAME RATE EYE MOVEMENT 
YOU KNOW W W UH UH I WE'RE IF WE'RE EXPECTING THE G. D. F. FORMAT TO BE UM SORT OF A PARSED VERSION OF EVENTS 
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH RAW FRAME F FRAME RATE STUFF COMING OUT OF THIS 
YOU WOULDN'T PROB YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT IN THIS KIND OF FORMAT FOR UP TRANSLATION TO THE OTHER THINGS 
YEAH W YEAH YOU CAN GET BACK TO IT 
YEAH 
WE'RE NOT THROWING ANYTHING AWAY 
THIS IS JUST THE STUFF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT THE THE ABOUT THE WAY TO THINK OF THIS IS THIS IS THE DATA THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ANALYSE AGAINST THE OTHER TRACKS OF DATA 
SO THE DATA THAT WE WANNA COMPARE WITH A LANGUAGE OR WITH WHATEVER 
AND UM SO 
YEAH 
SO SO IN ESSENCE WHAT YOU WOULD THEN DO IS 
WELL WE'RE NOT DOING FRAME RATE IT ANY FORM FOR WELL MAYBE WE ARE 
I DON'T KNOW 
I I HAD THOUGHT WE WERE YEAH THE EYE TRACKER DOES 
BUT 
BUT RIGHT 
W WHAT WE UM THE KINDS OF EVENTS THAT WE HAD OUR UH BEFORE TALKED ABOUT PUTTING INTO THE RECORD FOR THEN IS ON LINE AND N. X. T. ISN'T BASED ON SAYING EVERY X. SECONDS SOMETHING 
YOU KNOW GIVE ME GIVE ME WHAT'S HAPPENING EVERY X. SECONDS 
IT'S MORE LIKE YOU KNOW GIVE ME THE FIXATIONS AND THE UM THE BLINKS 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
DURATIONS ARE IN THERE 
BUT IT'S NOT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UM SAYING THAT SOMETHING IS IN A PARTICULAR STATE EVERY FRAME 
WHATEVER THE FRAME RATE AS YOU KNOW TEN SECONDS A MINUTE 
YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S ONE KIND OF W WAY OF LOOKING AT DATA 
AND UM A PARSED VERSION OF THE DATA WHICH ISN'T IT UM ANY PARTICULAR LENGTH 
IT RELIES ON THIS REALLY CLOSE FRAME RATE THAT'S UNDERNEATH 
NO NO 
THE TIME THE TIME IS STILL IN THERE 
BUT YOU'LL GET UH WHAT YOU WANT US TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE UM THE CONCEPTS BEHIND THAT DATA THAT YOU WANT REPRESENTED 
SO RATHER THAN SAYING THE EYE WAS TO THIS PARTICULAR PLACE 
YOU KNOW HERE AND THEN A TENTH OF A SECOND LATER HERE AND THEN A TENTH OF A SECOND LATER HERE 
YOU SAY THERE WAS A FIXATION FROM THIS TIME TO THAT TIME AND THERE WAS BLINK FROM THIS TIME TO THAT TIME 
AND 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
SO THERE'S TWO ISSUES HERE 
WE'RE NOT THROWING ANYTHING AWAY 
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT TOOL WOULD YOU USE TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OF THE DATA 
WOULD YOU BE AS THE MORE YOU CAN PLAN 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME IT WAS IN DURING THAT FIXATION 
YEAH 
OKAY SO THE PERCENTAGE AS I I SEE A CAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE USING FOR MEASUREMENT 
IT'S A CUT OFF FOR WHETHER OR NOT TOO COUNTS AS A FIXATION 
SO THAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
'CAUSE ALL YOU WANNA KNOW IS WHETHER THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE SAME OBJECT IN THE PERIOD AFTER 
YEAH 
OKAY 
CAN WE DRAW IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT UM THAT THIS IS SATISFYING ELLEN'S CONCERNS 
WELL THERE'S A WHITE BOARD RIGHT 
WE LEAVE THIS THING 
SO IF THE PENS WORK 
SO UM THIS IS UM A. 'S EYES RIGHT 
AND B. 'S EYES 
AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DRAW THIS RIGHT SO THAT THEY YOU KNOW 
IF UM FROM THIS TIME TO THIS TIME THEY'RE LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE 
W WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW IN THE CRITICAL YOU WANNA KNOW AFTER THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PERIOD WITH THIS GUY 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
SO 
YEAH 
SO YOU KNOW UH MIGHT GET TRIANGLE ONE THERE AND ONE MAYBE THIS ONE'S GONNA OVERLOOK LAP QUITE A BIT 
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS BE ABLE TO DEFINE UM BIGGER PERIODS WHICH IS THE PERIOD WHEN THEY'RE SORT OF INTERESTED IN TRIANGLE ONE OVERALL RIGHT 
THIS IS SORT OF SOME META LEVEL ANALYSIS 
YEAH 
BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO IN THE N. X. T. QUERY LANGUAGE BUT IT YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN ANY YOU KNOW 
THIS IS SUCH SPECIAL PURPOSE S BUT IT'S EASY ENOUGH GIVEN THE DATA FORMAT FOR ANY OF THESE THINGS TO DO THAT 
SO YOU COULD DO IT IN 'CAUSE I IT'S JUST A MATTER IF I THE HARD PART IS DECIDING HOW CLOSE TOGETHER THESE HAVE TO BE BEFORE YOU DECIDE THAT THIS IS A EVENT THAT YOU WANNA PULL OUT 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW ALGORITHMICALLY YOU'RE YOU'RE ALREADY PUTTING TOGETHER I MEAN THIS IS ESSENTIALLY ALREADY YOU KNOW THESE FIXATIONS WITH STUFF IN BETWEEN 
AND UH UM YOU KNOW W WE'VE GOT AN ALGORITHM FOR DECIDING WHEN THAT'S A LIKE I GUESS 
YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT ARE NO 
OH YEAH YEAH 
SO IT'S ALL FIXATIONS 
THEY'RE THESE ARE ALL FIXATIONS AND SACCADES BUT WITHIN THE YEP 
SO THAT'S EASY ENOUGH 
SO THE HARD THING SO THEY COULD BE MOVING THEIR EYE ARBITRARILY HERE RIGHT 
AND YOU KNOW MAYBE EVEN HAVING FIXATIONS ON OTHER THINGS 
YEAH 
YEP 
BACK AND FORWARD 
YEP 
SO UM THIS ISN'T YEAH 
BUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO WE WE CAN ALREADY BUILD INTO THIS G. D. F. FORMAT THESE REGIONS IF YOU CAN GIVE A DEFINITION OF WHAT YOU THINK THAT IS 
BUT I THINK THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS IS TO BE ABLE TO INSPECT THE DATA ON UM SOME TOOL AND PLAY AROUND WITH THE DEFINITIONS 
BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
AND UH ELAN'S A REASONABLE CHOICE FOR THAT RIGHT 
WHAT YOU NEED IS SOMETHING WELL NO BECAUSE YOU NEED TO 
YOU YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE THE EFFECTS OF THIS 
SO I G I GUESS THIS IS A CASE OF CRAIG WRITING SOME SCRIPTS SO ROBIN HAVING SOME IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS AND SAYING 
YOU KNOW DID THIS DATA A AUTOMATICALLY 
IT I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT HARD RIGHT 
IT'S JUST THERE'LL BE A BUNCH OF THIS 
YOU'LL HAVE SOME RULES ABOUT HOW MAYBE HOW LONG YOU SPEND ON OTHER OBJECTS AND W WHETHER THE OTHER OBJECT IS UM THE EXISTING CONSTRUCTION OR NOT RIGHT 
AND SO UM 
OH RIGHT 
SO IF THEY IF THEY UH THEY HAD A FIXATION IN C. YOU WOULDN'T BE WORRIED 
BUT IF THEY HAD A FIXATION ON 
YEAH THEY'RE YEP 
BUT YEAH THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE CLOCK UM AND THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT THEY MAY LOOK AT COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BUT THAT'S LIKE A SEPARATE ANALYSIS RIGHT 
SO 
IT IN ONE 
THE IS VERY SEPARATE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BUT WHAT WE FIND E WHAT WE CAN GET OUT OF THE DATA EASILY TO THE MOMENT IS IT THIS KIND OF LEVEL RIGHT 
AND THEN IT'S A CASE OF DEFINING ALGORITHMICALLY ALL THESE OTHER TRANSFORMATIONS THAT YOU WANT 
SO THIS IS AN UH WE HADN'T THOUGHT OF ADDING BEFORE BUT WE SHOULD RIGHT 
WHICH IS UM WELL HOW WOULD YOU DECIDE WHETHER SOMETHING WAS THE CURRENT ADDENDUM UH THE C 
SO THAT'S A HUMAN DECISION 
YEAH 
UM 
BUT THE EX 
BUT WE BELIEVE 
BUT WE BELIEVE J. P. TO BE DEFINING THAT MAYBE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I COULD BELIEVE THEM YEAH NO TAKING AN INTEREST IN THAT 
I MEAN THE GENERAL DIVISION WAS LANGUAGE HERE AND OTHER STUFF THERE RIGHT 
I'LL JUST I'LL JUST MINUTE THAT 
OH YEAH EYE TRACKER HERE 
YEAH I MEAN WE KNOW THAT 
WELL YEAH 
BUT I MEAN WITH TRANSACTION CODING IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU WOULD SO I YOU YOU WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT VERBAL ANALYSIS EXACTLY 
IT'D BE VERBAL PLUS ACTION 
BECAUSE IT'S A TASK BREAKDOWN 
IT'S JUST A SEGMENTATION 
YEAH BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE YOU YOU WOULDN'T DO TWO CODINGS FOR TASK LEVEL ONE YOU WOULDN'T DO TRANSACTION CODING IN A ACTION SEGMENTATION 
I I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALISTIC BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'D ACTUALLY DO IS IS UM THE FULL RECORD OF WHAT YOU HAVE AND DO A SEGMENTATION 
I THINK IT'D BE HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IF YOU SAID LIKE JUST THE LANGUAGE WITHOUT WATCHING THE VIDEO TO DECIDE WHETHER WE'RE BREAKING DOWN THE TASK 
UH YOU DON'T WANT TO TO BE CODING TH UH BASED ON THAT THOUGH AND THEN THAT SEEMS A STRANGE WAY TO GO ABOUT THINGS 
I MEAN THIS THE LANGUAGE EVENTS ARE MULTI MODAL RIGHT 
YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER 
WH WHY DO YOU CARE WHETHER THEY CAN DO IT JUST BASED ON THE THE LANGUAGE 
SO 
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME MUCH LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER THINGS ONE COULD GET OUT OF THIS DATA 
BUT I YOU KNOW I IT'S A POSSIBILITY 
WE'LL 
YEAH 
WELL I C I CAN SEE MAYBE WANTING TO KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN DO THE CHUNKING JUST BASED ON THE ACTIONS WITHOUT THE LANGUAGE IN CASES WHERE THEY USE BOTH 
IT'S MORE G I CAN'T QUITE SEE WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO IT JUST BASED ON THE LANGUAGE WHEN WE YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAD BOTH 
UH-HUH 
WELL I THINK THAT ONE'S JUST BOUND TO FEEL 
BUT YEAH 
REALLY 
OKAY 
ANYWAY 
SO BACK BACK TO THIS MAIN PROBLEM WHICH IS YEAH 
W THE RECORD THAT WE ARE GETTING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IS ABOUT THE UM BUT THIS YOU KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT SOME REGION OF THE SCREEN DEFINED DYNAMICALLY 
AND THEN WE NEED SOME WAY OF KNOWING WHAT THE YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE ADDING THESE OTHER ANALYSES ABOUT YOU KNOW 
THEY'RE THEY'RE JOINTLY FOCUSED ON THIS REGION AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS PERCENTAGE OF TIME THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT AS ADDING NEW TIERS OF INFORMATION OUT THERE THE ELAN TRACK OR N. X. T. 
THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH SORT OF TRACK BASED ON THIS WAY 
UM BUT THE HARD PART IS KNOWING HOW YOU WANNA DO THAT 
AND I I THINK IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET INTO THE G. D. F. FORMAT IS JUST THIS 
AND THEN WE'VE GOT AN OPTION BUT IT UH FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS JUST EXPLORE THIS DATA 
SUGGEST WAYS ABOUT DOING IT AND UM BE ABLE TO PLAY THEM BACK AND SO UM WHEN WE THINK WE'VE GOT THESE THINGS RIGHT 
I DON'T THINK WE EVEN KNOW WHAT THE SET OF THESE THINGS ARE THAT WE WANT MUCH LESS HOW TO GET 'EM YET 
SO THE 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
SO THIS IS NOT THE YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE AIMING FOR 
BUT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS WHAT CRAIG PROGRAMS FOR THE INITIAL G. D. F. TRANSLATION 
UM 
YEAH 
SO LET'S JUST RETURN TO THIS QUESTION OF FRAME RATE 
BECAUSE THIS IS THE THING WE WERE NOT PLANNING TO UM TRANSFER INTO THIS FORMAT 
SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT A FRAME RATE KIND KIND OF CODING IS AG IT CAN AGAIN BE SEEN AS A TRACK 
BUT IT SAYS IT'S A CODING LIKE THIS RIGHT WHERE YOU SAY IT'S IN STATE A. STATE B. STATE C. STATE A. 
RIGHT 
SO YOU RIGHT 
SO I'M JUST YOU'RE HAPPY THAT IT'S NOT GONNA HAVE FRAME RATE UH LIKE THIS 
IT'S GONNA HAVE AN INTERPRETATION LIKE THIS 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
SORRY 
RIGHT 
WE RIGHT 
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ELLEN'S CONCERNS MIGHT MEAN WE NEED TO ADD MORE INFORMATION TO THESE TAGS BECAUSE UM 
YOU KNOW THIS THING IN ITSELF SO TH BUNCH OF FIXATIONS RIGHT WITH SACCADES 
FIXATIONS AND THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME THOSE FIXATIONS COVER YOU MIGHT WANT 
OKAY 
SO NUMBER OF FIXATIONS 
PERCENTAGE OF 
NO NO 
THIS IS THIS IS STILL UM UH SUMMARY DATA 
THEY'RE HE'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST ADDING ATTRIBUTES TO THESE THINGS THAT SAY THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS THAT COUNTED AS THAT LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE RIGHT 
SO YOU IT'S POSSIBLE 
YEAH THE SPOTS'LL BE DIFFERENT ANYWAY 
'CAUSE I YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO HAVE THE SAME PIXEL 
SO UM WE HAVE THE OPTION THAT WE CAN PUT IN AN A. FIXATION THING HERE RIGHT AS WELL 
IF YOU WANT THE SMALLER IF YOU WANT THE SMALLER CODING IN AN HOUR 
SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST PARSED INTO THIS IDEA OF WHICH OBJECT 
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE RAW FIXATION AMI DATA 
WE CAN PUT THAT ONE IS ANOTHER TRACK 
IF YOU THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT ONE ONE OF THESE TOOLS THAT SHOWS YOU THE TRACKS AGAINST EACH OTHER 
YEAH I D THAT'S ALL UH ASKED FOR 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK 
YEAH AND IN N. X. T. THERE'S NO COST RIGHT BECAUSE THE YOU THE UH YOU JUST DON'T CHOOSE TO LOAD THOSE 
ALL WE'RE DOING IS DUMPING IT IS OUTPUT THAT YOU CAN LOAD IF YOU CHOOSE IT 
UM I G SO YOU KNOW SO IF THEY'RE THINGS THAT YOU JUST KNOW ARE CRAZY AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT THEN WE DON'T DO IT 
BUT OTHERWISE WE GO AHEAD AND DUMP 'EM 
'CAUSE IT'S EASY TO DUMP OUT THE FIXATIONS 
UM YEAH 
OKAY 
SO IT'S THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS THE DID YOU WANT THE EYE 
UM NOT E WELL IF IT'S CH YOU HAVE TO DO YOU HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO ANOTHER TIER RIGHT 
YOU CAN'T YOU CAN SAY THERE WERE THREE FIXATIONS AND THEY AVERAGED UH A CERTAIN TIME 
BUT YOU DON'T WANNA 
D WELL WHAT ABOUT THE THE OVERALL SUM OF THE DURATIONS 
SO THAT I MEAN WHICH WAY DO YOU WANT IT 
YEAH THEN THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT 
THAT WAY AROUND 
OKAY 
AND UH YOU DID YOU WANT THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME FIXATED AS OPPOSED TO WHICH IS SORT OF ANOTHER VIEW OF THOSE NUMBER 
YOU CAN HAVE SO MANY OF THIS IS 
YEAH 
WELL IT'S NOT UM THE THE EXTRA COST OF HAVING THIS AS ATTRIBUTES IS NOT HIGH 
SO UM YOU KNOW 
IT SAVES YOU I UH HAVING TO DO WRITE SCRIPTS TO DO ARITHMETIC ON THAT LATER IF YOU KNOW THAT THESE ARE NUMBERS THAT ARE GONNA BE USEFUL TO YOU 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
WELL WELL BUT YOU THESE ARE DIFFERENT TRACKS OF INFORMATION 
SO WHAT YOU WANT IS ONE TRACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH OBJECT IT'S IN IN ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S IN THE OTHER GUY'S GAZE 
AND IN ABOUT WHETHER IT'S ON UM ONE OF THE MOUSE POSITIONS 
YEAH BUT I IN IN THE ANALYSIS YOU SHOULD TREAT THIS IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE TRACKS OF INFORMATION 
BECAUSE THEY CAN BE LOOKING AT THEY COULD LOOK SIM SIMULTANEOUSLY AT SOMEBODY'S MOUSE SOMEBODY'S GAZE AND SOME OBJECT RIGHT 
SO 
YEAH 
SO TH THOSE ARE INDEPENDENT 
SO SO WHAT WE WANT IS WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT IS TO THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE RIGHT 
AND SAY THEY ARE IN THIS PERIOD WELL I MEAN UH THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GIVEN WHAT I'VE TRYING TO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO G SO THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF TRACKS HERE RIGHT 
BECAUSE WELL WE JUST ADDED THIS FIXATION TRACK 
AND THEN THERE IS A. 'S MOUSE NOT THEIR EYES IS AN AN OBJECT RIGHT 
AND THE MOUSE MIGHT BE ON TRIANGLE ONE 
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER 
I MEAN I THE MOUSE WE'RE JUST SAYING WHERE IS THE MOUSE 
YOU KNOW IT'S IN THIS OBJECT 
AND THEN UM A. 'S EYE IS NO WELL A. 'S MOUSE I GUESS RIGHT 
A. 'S EYE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT A. 'S MOUSE HERE 
A. 'S EYE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT B. 'S MOUSE HERE RIGHT 
I MEAN THESE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING CROSS PRODUCTS AT THE THINGS THAT COULD BE CO LOCATED 
SO YOU JUST TREAT 'EM AS INDEPENDENT 
AND I'M GUESSING FROM WHAT YOU SAY YEAH 
I GUESSING FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT ALL THESE TRICKS 
YEAH WHICH IS FINE 
THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH THAT AT ALL 
YEAH 
SO SO UM UH YOU KINDA GET THE IDEA HERE 
YEAH 
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING SO YOU DON'T TREAT THAT ENTIRE SET IS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE 
IT'S JUST USE THE THE OBJECTS IS LIKE A SEPARATE LEVEL OF ANALYSIS 
OF WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE OBJECTS THAN WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE GAZE 
'CAUSE THEY CAN HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME 
DOES THAT HAPPEN 
OH RIGHT 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS LIKE A NEW PROBLEM FOR US WHICH IS I'M GONNA CHANGE 
THAT'S THE BAD ONE 
YEAH 
SO YOU'RE SAYING 
OKAY 
CAN YOU WRITE ON MY PEN PAD 
JUST SAY YEAH PENS 
WHITE BOARD PENS 
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE LOOKING AT UM UH SQUARE ONE AT THIS POINT 
'CAUSE THEY 
CLOSE TOGETHER 
OKAY THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR THE DATA MODELS AND THREE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE USING 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY GREATEST OVERLAP 
DRAW UH MY G MY UH SPACIAL REASONING IS NO GOOD 
SO UH I I'M THE ON THAT USES THE WHITE BOARD 
'CAUSE I ACTUALLY PUT THE THE MICROPHONES ON 
UH THIS IS THE BETTER PEN 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
BUT YOU HAD A WAY OF CHOOSING WHICH ONE RIGHT 
SO YOU JUST MEAN WHICH I SEE IT CLOSER TO THE USE THE CIRCLE I MEAN WHAT IS THIS CIRCLE 
THEY'RE LOOKING AT A PIXEL OR SOMETHING RIGHT 
RIGHT 
SO RIGHT 
UH SO THOSE VARY IN SIZE 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THEY COULD BE 
UH ABOUT WHAT PAIN THAT'S GONNA BE ANALYTICALLY 
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA HOW MANY PARTS ARE THERE 
LIKE 
OKAY 
I KNOW WAYS OF GETTING AROUND THIS ANALYTICALLY 
'CAUSE YOU C 
IF THEY'RE REALLY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER IT'S GONNA GET FOXED 
YEAH 
IT'S NOT THE DATA FORMAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT 
IT'S THE UM THE WAY YOU DO THE ANALYSIS 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE TO SAY UM YOU KNOW DID THEY JOINTLY LOOK AT TRIANGLE ONE 
OKAY 
DID THEY JOINTLY LOOK AT SQUARE ONE 
OKAY 
DID THEY JOINTLY LOOK AT YOU KNOW YOU NEED SOME WAY OF UH UH GOING OVER THE WHOLE THING 
BUT I C WE CAN FIND WAYS AROUND THAT 
I THINK FOR NOW WE WE DO IT THIS WAY AND THEN WE WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO IF IT IN THE END 
IT'S JUST YOU KNOW ON LINE AT THAT HAS THE SIDE EFFECT THAT IF YOU GO FOR THE NATURALISTIC WAY OF OF UP TRANSLATING TO LINE 
THERE'LL BE A ZILLION TRACKS 
AND IT'LL PROBABLY RUIN THEIR VIEWER 
'CAUSE YOU'LL GET VERY SPARSE DATA ON EACH TRACK 
IT'LL BE LIKE THE OLD REFERRING EXPRESSION GENERALIS UH UH VISUALIZATION UM THE MAP TASK 
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT AN OBJECT ONE LANDMARK AND THEN ANOTHER LANDMARK 
WELL IT'S BIG RIGHT 
WELL WE'LL SEE IF ELAN LIKES IT OR NOT 
YEAH AND WE B WE BETTER ALSO LIKE HAVE ON THE REPRESENTATIONAL LIST OF PAR LIKE EVEN IN THE N. X. T. UP TRANSLATION A LIST OF PARTS 
IT IT AFFECTS THE WAY WE DO THE N. X. T. U UP TRANSLATION AND MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR PEOPLE 
WELL THE 
AND IT SUDDENLY BECOMES AND THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE CONSTRUCT AT A TIME RIGHT 
IT'S THERE IS IN THE CONSTRUCT RIGHT 
WHAT WHY DOES IT WHY DOES CONSTRUCT ONE BECOME CONSTRUCT TWO WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING TO IT 
YEAH 
UH AND THIS IS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO TO STAY TRIANGLE ONE WHEN YOU START WITH A CONSTRUCT IT'S NOT A CONSTRUCT AT ALL 
IT'S JUST A ONE THING 
AND WE DON'T WANT TRIANGLE ONE TO SUDDENLY HAVE BIGGER STUFF 
YEAH YEAH THERE ARE 
THERE ARE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THAT WAS THE NEXT QUESTION I HAD 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
THAT'LL COVER MOST OF 'EM 
MM-HMM 
I YEAH 
IT'S TRIANGLE TWO 
YOU DON'T BECAUSE THAT'S YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE HUMAN CODING TO DO THAT 
YEAH THERE MIGHT BE MULTIPLE TRIANGLES THAT YOU'VE BROKE AND YOU WON'T KNOW WHICH ONE THEY'RE PLANNING ON USING IT FOR 
WELL YOU KNOW WHICH MOLD THEY COME FROM 
AND SO YOU KNOW WHICH SHAPE THEY MATCH 
BUT YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW WHICH ONE OF THE ONES THEY'RE MEANT TO REPLACE 
UH SO THERE'S ONE TWO PARTS WITH THE SAME SHAPE 
THEN 
UH SOME SHAPE AND COLOUR 
RIGHT OKAY 
OH OKAY 
SO YOU CAN TELL WHAT IT'S MEANT TO REPLACE THEN 
BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME IT'S UH JUST A CASE OF THE MOLD RIGHT 
YEP 
YEAH 
BUT TH THIS ALSO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
W IN WHEN YOU SPECIFY THESE THINGS DO YOU SPECIFY THE MOLDS OR DOES IT FIGURE OUT WHAT THE MOLDS ARE BASED ON 
SO SO THIS HARD WIRED INTO TIM'S PROGRAM 
OR IS IT JUST AN ARTIFACT OF THE WAY WE USE 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
SO IT'S HARD WIRED 
SO MINOR MODIFICATION NEEDED FOR 
MM-HMM 
UH ABOUT WHAT WERE THE REQ WHA 
HAS MULTIPLES YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH UH BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE UNIQUE 
MM-HMM 
SO WHAT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO I TH 
I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW TO TRY TO SUMMARISE 
UH WE WE THINK TIM'S PROGRAM CAN DO BOTH OF THESE CONDITIONS THAT YOU WANT 
BUT I'M STILL WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE UH EFFECTS ARE FOR ANALYSIS 
BECAUSE YOU WERE AIMING AT SOMETHING ON UM THE G. D. F. FORMAT AND I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT 
AND WE 
YEAH 
SO SO OKAY 
SO I'LL SUMMARISE WHAT WE SAID ABOUT THAT PART THAT UM EVERY TIME YOU CAST OFF A NEW PART FROM A MOLD OR 
YOU KNOW VERY BLACK TRIANGLE HAS A DIFFERENT I. D. 
AND YOU KNOW IT'S A BLACK TRIANGLE 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHICH MOLD IT CAME FROM 
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH PART IT WAS INTENDED TO REPLACE ON THE SCREEN BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MIND READ 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN DEFINE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
I THINK THAT THIS IS A HUMAN CODING THAT AS PART OF THE ACTION CODING 
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW ANYBODY BUT A PERSON WATCHING THIS CAN GUESS WHY THEY CAST OFF THIS THING AT THIS TIME 
YEAH BUT THAT'S OKAY 'CAUSE THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT UNDERLYING PART NUMBERS 
AND WHEN YOU SAY WHAT A CONSTRUCT 
NO 
NO NO 
YES 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO WE CAN EASILY LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THAT AUTOMATICALLY 
IT'S JUST THE WHY THEY G WHY THEY GET NEW PARTS THAT'S THE PROBLEM FOR US 
WE CAN'T IF THEY SUDDENLY IF THEY DECIDE TO GET A PART OF A MOLD WE DON'T KNOW WE CAN'T KNOW WHY UNTIL THEY DO SOMETHING WITH IT 
IF THEY DO 
OH YEAH YOU SAID THAT 
UM 
YEAH BUT YOU CAN 
BUT YOU CAN BREAK YOU YOU CAN BUT YOU CAN BREAK ONE WHEN YOU BREAK ONE YOU DON'T CAST OFF THE MOLD YOURSELF IT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY 
OH OKAY NEVER MIND THEN 
SO THEY JUST HAVE TO USE IT YEAH 
UH-HUH 
UH BUT THEY HAVE TO DRAG IT UP PAST THE MOLD LINE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WHERE THERE'S EXTRA PARTS 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO THIS WHY QUESTION DOESN'T EVEN ARISE BECAUSE 
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WITH IT 
WHEN THEY DECIDE TO MOVE IT PAST THE MOLD LINE THEY'RE P DOING SOMETHING WITH IT PROBABLY AND YOU'LL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WITH IT BECAUSE 
THEY DO IT 
YEAH 
HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT 
YEAH BUT THERE'S THERE'D BE ONE WAY OF CODING THAT AUTOMATICALLY RIGHT 
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO THAT 
BUT THAT'S A HUMAN CODING RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
SO WE 
SO UH THAT'S GONNA PARTICULARLY BE A PROBLEM FOR J. P. RIGHT 
REMEMBER UM ALL THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR F WITH LANGUAGE WITH AND WITHOUT LANGUAGE 
AND IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL WHETHER THEY BROKE SOMETHING INTENTIONALLY WITHOUT THE LANGUAGE 
WHICH MEANS IT'S PROBABLY NOT 
YEAH OKAY 
BUT THE UM THIS IS PROPERLY PART OF THE ACTION CODING 
SO WE SHOULD WELL WE SHOULD MAKE A WISH LIST RIGHT AS A SIDE EFFECT 
MM 
THEY COULD DISCUSS DECIDING TO BREAK SOMETHING AND AND THEN ONE GUY DOES IT 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
NO NO 
IT WAS THEM JUST DR UH FORGETTING TO UM DEFINE AN ATTRIBUTE THEY HAD TO 
WELL WHI WHICH IS PROBABLY A DOCUMENTATION FAULT RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THERE A Y YEAH 
WELL WHILE WE'RE ON PAST THINGS IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANNA TELL US ABOUT THE PRIOR PART OF THIS 
WHICH IS THE YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS UH HOLDING YOU UP FROM 
UH-HUH 
RIGHT 
SO IT DOESN'T SLOW DOWN THE EYE TRACKER 
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING NASTY 
SO WE WE P SO WE PAY FOR IT AND 
NOTHING IMPORTANT AND NOTH NOTHING BIG ENOUGH THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT IT RIGHT 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
I KNOW 
UH DO YOU NEED TWO COPIES OF CAMTASIA TO DO THAT 
SO YOU'RE GONNA LOOK INTO THIS RIGHT 
WELL YOU C LOOK AT THE LICENCE CONDITIONS IT MIGHT NOT 
I C I NEVER PRE JUDGE LICENCES UNTIL I'VE READ 'EM 
SO UH WELL AND UM HOLD ON BEFORE WE GET GO ANY FURTHER 
SO THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR DATA STORAGE RIGHT 
BECAUSE WE UM IT MEANS WE'VE GOT WELL IN THIS IS THREE TIMES RIGHT 'CAUSE WE'VE GOT UH NO 
WE'RE GONNA BUILD WE'RE GONNA USE JAVASCRIPT TO BUILD THE VIDEOS ON THE FLY RIGHT 'CAUSE IT'S FAST 
SO THE THE PERMANENT STORAGE IS JUST THE CAMTASIA STUFF 
SO UH SO THAT A PROBLEM 
WHERE ARE WE PUTTING THINGS 
UH WE CAN WE CAN PUT 'EM IN THE SAME THING RIGHT 
YOU CAN DUMP 'EM INTO ONE VIDEO FRAME IF YOU DON'T MIND LOSING RESOLUTION 
BUT THAT'S MAYBE A PROBLEM RIGHT BECAUSE 
SO THE SYNCHRONIZATION'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM 
YEAH BEFORE THE TASK 
NO 
SO 
THESE ARE BA THESE ARE BACK UPS 
RIGHT 
SO THE FLASH GET ALLOWS YOU TO HAND SYNCHRONIZE THEM LATER IF YOU NEED TO BY STRIPPING EXTRA VIDEO OFF THE FRONT 
AS LONG AS YOU MAKE SURE YOU START 'EM BEFORE THE FLASH THEN YOU'RE FINE 
BUT IT WILL THERE'S A A COST OF HAVING TO GO TO BACK UP WHICH IS SYNCHRONIZING THEM 
OH OKAY 
SO YOU SEE YOU SHOULD START THE CAMTASIA REALLY EARLY THEN 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING IT 
I MEAN U 
WELL OKAY YOU'VE GOT THE PROPER SOUND RECORD 
BUT YOU'RE NOT DUMPING IT THROUGH CAMTASIA TO RECORD IT RIGHT 
YOU'RE 
WHAT BEFORE WE WERE GONNA USE CAMTASIA AT ALL WHAT WELL WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO WHAT WERE WE GOING TO DO WITH THE SOUND 
UH-HUH 
SO UH UH WE SEE THERE ANY SOUND DEGRADATION THAT COMES ABOUT FROM PUTTING THIS THROUGH CAMTASIA RATHER THAN RUNNING IT IT STRAIGHT 
OKAY 
SO WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING ON DOING IT IS BUNGING IT IN ONE OF THE CAMTASIA TRACKS AND THEN SPLICING IT OFF THE CAMTASIA TRACK 
IT'S AN EASY BUT IF YEAH 
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA BUNG IT IN THE OTHER CAMTASIA TRACK TO IF YOU NEED TO RIGHT 
BUT WE'LL JUST WE'RE GONNA STORE ALL THREE SEPARATELY THEN 
AND THE SOUND IS GOING TO START AT THE SAME TIME IS ONE OF THAT ARBITRARY ONE OF THE CAMTASIA VIDEOS 
BUT YOU'LL KNOW WHEN THE REAL EXPERIMENT YOU'LL KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT AND THE EYE TRACKER TIMINGS 
YEAH 
NO HUMAN INTERVENTION REQUIRED 
IT'S TIME STAMPED 
YEAH 
BUT HO HOLD ON 
DO WE NEED THAT 
I MEAN IT I I THOUGHT THE WAY THAT TIM HAD THIS SET UP ORIGINALLY 
UM THE D UH W THE TIME STAMPS USED THERE WOULD BE JOINT TIME STAMPS BETWEEN THE AUDIO AND THE EYE TRACKER SO THAT YOU KNOW 
UH THE AUDIO RECORD TEN SECONDS ONE WAS THE SAME AS TEN SECONDS INTO THE EYE TRACKER RECORD SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY EXTRA HAND WORK 
YOU KNOW ANY UH CHOPPING THE STREETS OF AUDIO SIGNALS TO GET THERE WAS NOTHING OKAY 
SO WE'RE RELYING ON YOUR MATLAB SCRIPT TO GET IS THE CHOPPED VERSION OF THE IDEA RIGHT 
RIGHT SO WE CAN EITHER ADJUST THE EYE TRAI TRACK DATA ARE WE CAN ACTUALLY CHOP THE AUDIO SIGNAL TO TAKE OFF THE FIRST WHATEVER HOWEVER MANY SECONDS 
YEAH 
BUT UH BUT DO UM THE UH LINING UP THE CAMTASIA TWO IS GONNA TAKE W W HE'S WORKING ON A MATLAB SCRIPT FOR THE SOUND BUT NOT FOR US THE ONE THAT'S GOT THE SOUND ON IT 
THAT'LL ALSO TELL YOU WHERE TO CHOP THE VIDEO TO GET IT OUT LINE UP 
THE ON THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE SOUND ON IT IT WON'T 
OH 
SO IT'S JUST GET THE BLEEPS 
OH OKAY SO W ONE HAND SYNCHRONIZATION REQUIRED AT ALL 
UM AS LONG AS THE SCRIPTS WORK RIGHT 
'KAY 
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU ABOUT THE FINDING THESE THINGS 
SO WE JUST HAVE TO WE HOPE WE DON'T HAVE AN ANY SUBJECTS WITH THE ODD VOCALIZATIONS 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
'CAUSE THIS THIS IS THE DROP IT TASTE 
YEP 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
MM 
OH YEAH 
I KNOW BUT AS YOU GO YOU GOT A SOLUTION FOR THAT THEN 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
YEAH 
YOU'RE SURE THERE'S NOT A BETTER SOLUTION THAT INVOLVES 
'CAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE MIGHT WANNA USE THIS FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION OR SOMETHING 
YOU NEVER KNOW IF IT'S THE DATA IS THERE THEN 
YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
AND YOU'RE GONNA WANT FORCED ALIGNMENT 
OH NO 
WELL NO NO 
BETTER TO COLLECT AND SORT 
UH WELL IT'S THE MENU 
WAIT WAIT W I I THOUGHT THE USUAL THAT A BETTER SOLUTION WAS FIXING THIS PROBLEM WITH THE MONO MICROPHONE SOCKET 
SOUND CARD 
SO YOU SAID THE PROBLEM WAS THE AIM AT THE UM UM I IS EXPECTING A MONO MICROPHONE INPUT 
SO SO THAT FIXABLE 
LIKE IS THERE ANY WAY YEAH 
UH I THINK A NEW SOUND CARD SOUNDS A BETTER SOLUTION THAN MONKEYING ABOUT WITH TRYING TO FILTER WHITE NOISE IT 
WHICH ISN'T HARD 
BUT UH BUT IT'S ONLY GOT AN INPUT RIGHT 
I BELIEVE IT'S EASY TO PUT TWO MONOS INTO A STEREO SIGNAL 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
SO SO THERE ANY REASON WHY WE WE DON'T DO THAT 
YEAH 
WELL 
IT'S IN THE OLD DAYS WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WANT A LITTLE IF THEY'D BEEN IN THE SAME ROOM WE WOULD HAVE HAD A LITTLE STEREO THING IN THE BACKGROUND AS BACKUP AS WELL JUST TO MAKE SURE 
'CAUSE IT'S SLIGHTLY DICIER YOU KNOW IF HIS SCRIPTS DON'T WORK THEN YOU DON'T GET THE OVERLAP 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A REAL TRIAL 
IT JUST HAS TO BE TWO GUYS TALKING IN THE TWO BITS 
AND THEN 
WE'VE BOTH BEEN SO BADLY BITTEN IN THE PAST 
YEAH 
BUT THIS THIS SOUNDS REASONABLE TO ME 
I SEE I THINK 
YEAH 
DO DO THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME SOUND CARD PROBLEM 
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT 
OKAY 
OH 
WELL UH YEAH 
I THINK TELL THE GUYS 
IT YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IT'S JUST THE WAY THEY WIRED IT 
SO UM IT'S GETTING LATE AND I'VE GOT A TWO O'CLOCK AND I'VE GOT A NICE LUNCH 
SO I WANNA EAT MY LUNCH TODAY 
UH WHAT DID YOU WANNA GET THROUGH TODAY MORE 
I MEAN I THINK I THINK IT WAS USEFUL GOING THROUGH YOUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THIS 
'CAUSE UM THAT'S QUITE A BIT CLEARER IN MY HEAD AT LEAST AND BUT I THINK MOSTLY WE LEAVE YOU TO GO AWAY AND OUR DESIGN THE G. D. F. OR ADD NEW BITS TO THE G. D. F. ALONG THOSE LINES 
AND THEN WE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT I THINK THE THING TO DO IS UM FOR YOU TO GO AWAY AND THINK ABOUT IT THIS AWAY WITH THE DIFFERENT TRACKS FOR THE DIFFERENT OBJECTS AND THE UM THE KINDS OF THINGS WE'VE ADDED ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
AND AND TRY TO CHANGE THE SPACE IS IT IT REFLECTS THIS AND MAYBE UM UH MAYBE BY THAT POINT THERE WILL BE SOME SAMPLE DATA OR SOMETHING UH AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS FOR US TO LOOK AT THE SP THE SPEC THE WAY YOU UNDERSTAND IT NOW AND SOME DATA 
AND THEN ELLEN'LL HAVE NEW IDEAS ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED OR ABOUT THESE POST ANALYSIS YOU KNOW THE AND THEN AND WE CAN ADD 'EM IN 
BUT IT'S GONNA EMERGE OVER TIME 
I MEAN THAT'S CLEAR 
UH IS THE SPACE TO THE OTHER CONVERSATION YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S SOLVED NOW 
YEAH TEST 
WE HAVE TO TEST 
WELL YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR MODELS OR DO YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL UH ANYTHING YOU ACTUALLY NEED FIXED 
YOU KNOW 
JOE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE RIGHT 
SO 
WELL I BUT HE WASN'T GONNA BE BOOKING ANY TIME TO USE AFTER THE THIRTY FIRST OF OCTOBER 
SO UM 
THAT THAT MEANS THAT ANY BUGS THAT NEED FIXED ARE NOW CRAIG'S RESPONSIBILITY RIGHT 
YOU DON'T KNOW HAVE ANY CHANGE IN THAT RIGHT 
'CAUSE UH THAT'S WHAT HE USED TO US ORIGINALLY 
SO I WOULD ASSUME YOU KNOW ONE MORE CONTACT WITH JOE 
IT'S NOT FOR TO GET WORK OUT OF SOMEBODY FOR FOR 
SO YOU KNOW ASK CRAIG INSTEAD 
YEAH 
I DON'T THINK 
WELL WE UH WASN'T PAID IN ADVANCE 
HE'S BEING PAID IN ARREARS 
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER 
UH I THINK IT'S 
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE ALL THE SOFTWARE 
I MEAN IT'S NOT BIG THINGS IT'S JUST MAINTENANCE AT THIS PROGRAM AT THIS POINT AND 
YEAH 
I IF HE CAN GIVE IT YOU KNOW LIKE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS YOU GOTTA HAVE AN IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU DISCOVER A BIG ONE THAT 
AND WE CAN MAKE CRAIG SHIFT ALL HIS OTHER PRIORITIES TO DO THIS 'CAUSE WE BOUGHT HIM 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
SO IT'S A KINDER WAY 
IT YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING THAT ACTUALLY NEEDS FIXED AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE WE WE ONLY AND THIS TO WORK WELL ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN USE IT FOR SOMETHING AND YOU GET WORK RATS 
SO 
AND HOW MANY MODELS DO YOU NEED TO COMPLETION 
AND HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE 
AND YOU GET 
AND YOU KNOW ABOUT COMPLEXITY 
YOU'RE WAITING ON MARLOES 
YOU CAN COLD CALL HER TODAY THIS AFTERNOON 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S HER JOB 
COME ON 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
SO YOU CAN DASH IN THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR TO A TIME 
DOESN'T SOUND VERY USEFUL FOR YOU 
UH-HUH 
OKAY WELL 
YOU GUYS SORT IT IT 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT BUT IT WOULD BE KINDA TO TELL HER AHEAD OF TIME WHICH OF YOUR MORNING SESSIONS YOU'RE BUMPED 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE PROBLEM THAT YOUR MORNINGS WEREN'T SLICED OFF IN THE BOOKING SYSTEM 
'CAUSE YOU KNOW I IF YOU'RE SA TOLD US THE BOOKING SYSTEM 
YEAH 
AND WHAT ARE THE INSTR WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS HAVE UM I YOU KNOW AS RULES ABOUT WHO YOU HAND THE KEYS IT 
'CAUSE YOU KNOW W LIKE PEOPLE TO KNOW TO GROUND THE UH I THOUGHT THE THE LENDING FOR THE BOOKING SYSTEM CAROLINE 
SO 'CAUSE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO UH HAVE TURNING ON 
OH OKAY SO THAT'S THE SAFETY 
AND YOU CONTROL THOSE ACCOUNTS 
OH OKAY THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH 
OKAY 
UH-HUH YEAH 
THAT'S SAFER 
'CAUSE THEN THEY LEARN THE FIRST TIME 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
I REALLY HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE 
SO UM WHAT ELSE IS IMPORTANT BEFORE YOU RUN 
NOTHING RIGHT 
YOU GET UH WILLING HEADS 
UH I DON'T THINK I BROUGHT MY DIARY UP 
UH BUT MAYBE 
WHY 
OKAY 
SO 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
SO DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME OF DAY YOU MIGHT WANT 
'CAUSE I SHOULD C I SHOULD CHECK THAT 
OKAY 
YOU ALL HAVE TO BE YOU'LL HAVE TO BE THERE IT WHEN IT FALLS OVER 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO THAT ALL SOUNDS OF GOOD FUN 
WELL I CAN JUST LEAVE YOU GUYS HERE YOU KNOW 
WHY NOT 
WHICH DATA 
YOU KNOW I I WANT EVERYTHING AND THEN I'LL DECIDE WHAT I WANT 
OKAY 
WE CAN GET BACK TO IT 
WE CAN GET WE CAN ALWAYS GET BACK TO IT 
WE'RE NOT THE ACTUALLY THROWING ANYTHING AWAY 
AND IF WE DECIDE TO RE JIG THIS AT SOME FINER 
MECHA METHOD 
WE'LL STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL AND A METHOD OF UH OF FILTERING 
SO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
AS LONG AS THE FORMAT IN WHICH WE PICK IT UP AS A FORMAT WHICH COULD BE GENERALISED TO A FINER TAKE 
BECAUSE THE WORST THING THAT CAN EVER HAPPEN TO YOU SEE YOU DISCOVER THAT YOU'VE DONE HUGE AMOUNTS OF ANALYSIS AND THE YOU ACTUALLY HAD THE DATA BUT YOU THROW IT AWAY BECAUSE YOU TREATED IT SO GROSSLY 
OKAY 
SO WHATEVER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE YOU KNOW BACKTRACK AND SAY OKAY INSTEAD OF EVERY SECOND EVERY TENTH OF A SECOND OR SOME SUCH THING 
BUT YOU KNOW THE 
WELL THE EYE TRACKER DOES 
MM-HMM 
WELL YOU NEED 
WELL ONE NEEDS TO KNOW THE DURATION OF THESE THINGS RIGHT 
SO ONE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL SO THERE'S NO REAL TIME THERE'S ONLY EV THERE'S ONLY EVENTS 
WHAT I'M WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS WHETHER WE'VE THROWN TIME AWAY 
HERE 
OKAY 
SO ONE OF THE FORMATS IN WHICH EYE TRACKER DATA IS ANALYSED IS PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT ON SOME TARGET AS OPPOSED TO SOME COMPETITOR OVER THE FIRST SECOND AFTER SOME EVENT 
OKAY 
SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE SHU HAVE TO SHOW IT SOME TIME SLICE RATE WHETHER THE EYE WAS IN THE SAME TARGET IS THE OTHER GUY 
A SIMILAR TARGET WHAT WE'D BOTH BEEN DEALI YOU KNOW 
SO WE HAVE TO BE WE HAVE ALL THE PARTS THE INTERESTING PARTS OF THE SCREEN IDENTIFIED AND BE ABLE TO SHOW DISTRIBUTION OF GAZE OVER TIME 
ALRIGHT 
NOW WE COULD BE REALLY UNLUCKY AND SOMEBODY WOULD EXPECT US TO DO THAT AT THE REAL FRAME RATE 
BUT I THINK THAT'S REALLY UNLUCKY 
BUT BUT MY POINT IS THAT WE MUSTN'T THROW AWAY ON OR LOSE THE CAPACITY OF BEING ABLE TO DELIVER THAT KIND OF DATA 
MM-HMM 
MM 
SO SO TYPICALLY THE YOU WILL MOVE RIGHT 
SO OVER ANY ONE SECOND THEY EYE'S ACTUALLY F FIXING ON A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS 
AND YOU AND SO WHEN YOU SAY THE EYE WAS IN THIS FROM HERE IT HERE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS THAT IS THAT IF YOU USE THE REAL FRAME RATE 
IT'S GONNA JIGGLE ALL OVER THE PLACE 
IT'S GONNA BE IN THIS LANDMARK 
UH IT'S IN THIS OBJECT THAT OBJECT THIS FIXED THING THAT FIXED THING OKAY 
YOU'RE GONNA GET LOTS AND LOTS OF STUFF 
AND IT'S PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT 
IT'S NOT UH I WENT HERE 
I SEE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE PERSON WALKING 
I WENT HERE I STAYED HERE 
IT'S IT'S MORE LIKE A FLY HOVERING 
MM-HMM 
BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU TAKE THEM AS SEPARATE EVENTS YOU GET THOUSANDS OF SEPARATE EVENTS 
MM-HMM 
AGAINST BIGGER FRAMES 
WELL THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DOING IT 
ONE IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A CUT OFF RIGHT 
BUT TH THERE IS THAT THERE WILL BE A TIME SPAN A KIND OF REACTION TO SOME EVENT SPAN 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
AND SO I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE REALLY TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT THIS 
ONE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME OVERALL IN WHICH TWO PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE SAME THING OKAY 
AND ONE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SEQUENCES IF THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT THE SAME THING AND THEN THEY BROKE IT 
ARE THEY DID LOOK AT THE SAME THING AND THEN THEY DID OR DIDN'T BREA YOU KNOW 
NO NO COULD IMAGINE THOSE TWO CATEGORIES 
THAT'S THAT'S A KIND OF TESTING OF OUR HYPOTHESES 
BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UM DUES YOU PAY AT THE WAY THEY DO THINGS IN THE LITERATURE TO GET YOUR PAPERS PUBLISHED 
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WILL WANT TO KNOW AS AN EVENT SERIES AFTER SOME CRITICAL EVENT RIGHT 
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TIME IS GIVEN TO LOOKING WHERE THE OTHER GUY IS LOOKING 
AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TIME OVER SOME YOU KNOW REASONABLE TIME SPAN OF A COUPLE OF SECONDS ALRIGHT 
SO THEY'LL BE THEY THEY'LL WANT IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE GAZE SETTLING ON PARTICULAR INCIDENTS ON PARTICULAR PLACES 
SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THOSE TWO THINGS AND THEY'RE RATHER DIFFERENT DEMANDS 
RIGHT 
OR HOW L ALRIGHT 
LET'S LET'S IMAGINE A TYPICAL CONSTRUCTION EVENT OKAY 
THERE IS SOME PART THERE ARE THERE ARE SEPARATE MOVABLE PARTS IN THE SCREEN READY FOR US RIGHT 
THERE MAY BE OR NOT A CONSTRUCTION ALREADY BEGUN RIGHT 
SOMEBODY MAKES THE FIRST MOVE 
THERE'S SOME KIND OF COMMUNICATION EITHER GESTURAL IMAGINARY OR VERBAL THAT PLANS HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT RIGHT 
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS THE PERSON WHO SPEAKS IS GOING TO DO SOME KIND OF VISUAL SCANNING 
WHILE THEY'RE SPEAKING OR COMMUNICATING IN SOME WAY THE OTHER PERSON MAY OR MAY NOT BE LOOKING WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING OKAY 
THEY MAY BE OVERLAPPING GAZE AT PARTICULAR OBJECTS WHICH ARE OF INTEREST 
LET'S CALL IT THE C THE CONSTRUCT EXISTING CONSTRUCT WHICH COULD BE ZERO 
ALRIGHT 
OR THE UM THE ADDENDUM THE THING WHICH IS NEXT GOING TO BE ADDED 
NEXT PIECE OKAY 
NOW IN ANOTHER CASE WHEN YOU DRAW THIS HE'S LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE WHICH YOU'RE ACTUALLY DRAWING YOU KNOW 
FOR A THE PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH HE'S STEADILY LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE IS GONNA BE VERY VERY SHORT RIGHT 
BECAUSE STARING FIXEDLY WITHOUT INTERRUPTION BLINK OR OR SACCADE IS IS AN EXTREMELY SHORT EVENT 
THAT'S FINE 
SO IT'S IN A REGION IT'S IN A REGION 
OKAY 
BUT EVEN SO YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET BOUNCING ON AND OUT OF THE REGION RIGHT 
SO EVEN SO YOU WANNA LOOK AT IF WE'RE INTERESTED IN HOW LONG BEFORE THE CONSTRUCTION MOVE TAKES PLACE 
UM HOW MUCH OF THE TIME THEY SPEND LOOKING AT THE SAME THING 
LET'S CALL THAT OUR MEASURE OF ALIGNMENT 
SO THEY'RE GONNA BE YEAH THAT'S RIGHT A. IS GONNA BE ON TRIANGLE ONE AND VARIOUS OTHER PLACES 
THAT'S RIGHT 
AND AND B. UM OKAY 
AND WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF OF THAT TIME WHERE THEY'RE BOTH IN THE SAME REGION 
RIGHT 
SO WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE DON'T UM SIMPLIFY DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
TEMPORARILY SIMPLIFY TOO MUCH IS THAT YEAH 
'CAUSE THEN YOU LOSE PERCENTAGE AS ONE IS A AS A D. V. 
RIGHT 
AND SO B. HAS SOME PERIODS OF LOOKING AT ONE AND ALL IT WILL WHICH WILL ALSO BE INTERMITTENT 
BECAUSE 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
WHEN THEY SHOULD BE 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
WELL 
IT 
RIGHT 
WHAT 
YES 
YES BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE FOR PART OF THAT TIME BOTH B. AND U. OR PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT OKAY 
IF IF YOUR INTENTION IS TO MOVE THE RED TRIANGLE TO SIT ON TOP OF THE THING ALREADY CONSTRUCTED YOU WOULD TEND TO LOOK BACK AND FORTH 
RIGHT 
AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO FIGURE THAT IT 
YEAH SURE 
SO SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE UNDER WHAT TOOL SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT THESE EVENTS 
SO 
RIGHT 
SO IS ESSENTIALLY THERE'S THERE'S UM U. I. IS DIVIDED INTO T. R. ONE AND C. AND OTHER STUFF OKAY WHERE C. S THE CONSTRUCT THE EXISTING THING 
WELL NO 
I MEAN WE'D TAKE A SEPARATE WE'D LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE TIME I MEAN I HAVE AN IDEA BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE LIKE WHEN THEY'RE BUILDING THINGS TOGETHER 
OKAY 
SO THERE'S A THERE'S THE ADDENDUM AND THE AND THE C THE EXISTING CONSTRUCT 
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA SPEND MORE TIME LOOKING AT ONE OR THE OTHER 
BUT IF THEY'RE WHATEVER IT IS THAT ONE IS LOOKING OUT OF THE OTHER'S LOOKING THE SAME PLACE THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE 
YEAH 
SURE SURE 
AND THAT'S WHAT THE OTHER STUFF THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT THE DIAGONAL STRIPES OR FOUR 
THAT'S TRUE 
BUT WE C WE CAN ONE OF THE THINGS WE'LL BE DOING IS UM CATEGORISING PEOPLE I TAKE IT OR INTERACTIONS BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE SPEND LOOKING AT THE CLOCK 
WE'D EXPECT THAT IF WE PUT PEOPLE UNDER TIME PRESSURE THEY'LL LOOK AT THE CLOCK A LOT MORE 
SURE IT'S A SEPARATE ANALYSIS 
BUT YOU DON'T WANNA THROW IT AWAY RIGHT 
SO SO YOU CAN DEFINE OF ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY CATEGORISED BY THE EYE TRACKER SO IT WHERE THE YOU S ALRIGHT 
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PULL OUT ANY INTERESTING CATEGORY AND SAY ALRIGHT FOR THIS PHASE IT'S T. R. ONE OR C. 
FOR THIS PHASE IT'S UM S. Q. ONE OR C. OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY TRANSCRIBE THE THING OR WATCH THE FILM FURTHER ON 
YEAH 
YEAH ABSOLUTELY 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S THE ADDENDUM IN THE CONSTRUCT SHOULD BE YOU KNOW KIND OF THEY THEY CHANGE THEIR TRUE IDENTITY 
BUT THEY'RE I THEIR CATEGORIES OF STUFF NOW I W MY KIND OF ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THAT THIS WAS J. P. LAND 
THAT THAT'S WHAT HE WAS OR WHAT HE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN WAS THE KIND OF CODING WHICH WOULD DEFINE THE BUILDING SEQUENCE OKAY 
SO AND 
THE AND MAYBE HE WANTS TO THINK ABOUT THAT MORE AND SAY WELL THERE WERE SEVERAL CANDIDATES FOR THE ADDENDUM ALRIGHT 
AND AND IT WAS THE NEGOTIATION OF WHICH CANDIDATE WAS GONNA BE THE RIGHT CANDIDATE THAT'S ACTUALLY THE INTERESTING STUFF 
SO I SHOULD TALK TO HIM ABOUT THIS 
HE'S HE'S ACTUALLY UM EMAILED ME WITH A L WITH A LIST OF THINGS HE WANTS TO DISCUSS IT LENGTH 
SO I W I'LL BRING THIS ONE BACK AT HOME 
WELL THIS IS MY QUESTION FOR HIM 
SO UH GONNA DEFINE THIS KIND OF BUILDING SEQUENCE IN A WAY THAT WE CAN GET IT 
OR IS UH IS B I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON CONSTRUCTION THERE FOR A WHILE 
SO IT MAY BE THAT THEY HAVE A CODING SYSTEM THAT'S READY TO GO AND WE SHOULD JUST APPLY TO 
OKAY 
UM THEY DO A LOT OF SUB ASSEMBLY IN THE TASKS THEY'VE BEEN DOING 
SO THEY MAY WILL HAVE A YEAH 
LET'S FIND OUT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
SO WHA RIGHT 
WHAT WELL W BUT WE HAVE THE NEW ACTIONS I MEAN ACTIONS MIGHT MOSTLY BE THEIRS RIGHT 
BUT SINCE WE HAVE THE THE EYE TRACKER I TH WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT GAZE RIGHT 
YEAH I RIGHT 
BUT UM SO THEY'LL THEY'LL UH THEY'LL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THAT 
BUT UM PRESUMABLY WHAT YOU PIOUSLY HOPE SO HAPPENS HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH UM TRANSACTIONS 
RIGHT THAT THE VERBAL ANALYSIS AND THE UM AND THE VISUAL ANALYSIS GIVE YOU THE SAME BREAKING POINTS THE SAME CHUNKING POINTS 
WELL I MEAN WHAT YOU KNOW 
IT'S IT IS IT IS A TASK BREAKDOWN 
BUT FOR THE VERBAL VERSION THERE ARE WAYS OF ANNOUNCING THAT NOW WE'RE DOING A NEW ONE RIGHT 
OR THAT WE'RE FINISHED WITH THE OLD ONE 
NO YOU WOULDN'T 
BUT I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH YOU KNOW 
SO ONE IS AN OUTCOME OF THIS IS THAT YOU COULD ANALYSE EITHER AND AND YOU'D GET THE SAME CHUNKING OF THE MATERIAL 
THE THING WHICH YOU GUYS THOUGHT TO MAKE AN A PAPER 
IT'S A HYPOTHESIS 
WELL 
THEY ARE DOING THESE THINGS TOGETHER 
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ONE COULD IMAGINE DOING IS UM SOON AS YOU KNOW 
HAVING THE TRANSCRIPTION THERE AND PL JUST PLAY IT BACK TO A BUNCH OF CAPTIVE UNDERGRADUATES AND SAY WHEN DO THEY STOP AND START 
UM BECAUSE BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT UM CYCLING SEQUENCES IN DISCOURSE 
AND OF THE DISCOURSE TELLS YOU WHAT'S GOING ON THAT'S INFORMATION 
I MEAN I GO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS HOW THE INFORMATION IS GONNA BE SHARED ACROSS THESE MEDIA 
AND IF YOU CAN GET IT ALL OUT OF THE SPEECH YOU KNOW IF THE OF ALL OF THE CHUNKING IS AVAILABLE WHEN THERE IS SPEECH 
OKAY THEN IT'S CARRYING A LOT OF THE BURDEN 
IT'S SAYING WE ARE DONE WITH THAT AND 
MM 
BUT THIS IS BUT WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT DATA LIKE THIS WITH THIS WITH OUR OLD FASHIONED ANALYSES UM YOU KNOW 
AND I IT'S IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO KNOW THAT THAT MUCH INFORMATION THAT CHUNKING OF THE TASK INFORMATION IS BEING CARRIED BY THE LANGUAGE 
BECAUSE J. P. 'S QUESTION THE OVERRIDING QUESTION IS IS WHAT'S LANGUAGE FOR 
YOU KNOW 
IF PEOPLE ARE BUSY INTERACTING ALL THE TIME AND ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO CONTROL FOR WHETHER PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER WHEN THEY'RE DOING THESE JOINT TASKS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO THEM TO BE IRRELEVANT 'CAUSE LANGUAGE IS IRRELEVANT 
IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE NICE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IN A PLACE WHERE WE'RE CONTROLLING WHETHER YOU HAVE LANGUAGE OR NOT 
YOU COULD GET THE ENTIRE CHUNKING OF THE TASK OUT OF A LANGUAGE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S A SELF CONTAINED SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO A SYSTEM WHICH IS WHICH CAN'T BE INTERPRETED WITHOUT THE OTHER SYSTEM 
OKAY 
USUALLY THE CLAIM 
ALMOST ALL STUDIES ON LANGUAGE CLAIM THAT LANGUAGE IS A SELF CONTAINED SYSTEM WHICH WILL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW 
THAT'S THE CLAIM 
ALRIGHT 
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS TRUE 
I SAID THAT'S THE CLAIM 
AND SO IT'S WORTH TESTING 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO NO 
AND WE WON'T AND ESTABLISHING THE FULL SET WELL YOU KNOW TAKE AS MUCH OF THE PROJECT 
SO YOU KNOW 
FINE 
MY ONLY CONCERN W UH YOU A S I SAID WHEN I BARGED IN WAS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T LOSE THE THINGS THAT WE MIGHT NEED TO PICK UP LATER 
THAT'S ALL 
EVERY SINGLE FRAME 
WELL 
OKAY 
BUT SINCE THE L THE DEFINITIONS OF LIKE A THING WE'RE LOOKING AT OR DO UM ARE THE ONES WHICH GET RID OF THE LOWER LEVEL 
LIKE JIGGLING AROUND IN THE AREA OF A PARTICULAR OBJECT RIGHT 
SO IF WE'RE MOVING THE THE GREEN TRIANGLE UM WE'VE DEFINED A REGION WHICH IS THE DYNAMICALLY THE GREEN TRIANGLE WHEREVER IT IS 
WE WILL JIGGLE AROUND IN THERE 
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WE ARE IN THERE 
THAT'S BENEATH OUR LEVEL OF ANALYSIS 
SO 
WELL THE ON THAT INTERPRETATION IS DEFINABLE TO FRAME RATE BY OUR BY THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA USE FRAME RATE 
I C WELL I MEAN I BECAUSE I CAN I CAN SAY FOR HOW MANY FRAMES THIS FIXATION WENT IS OFFICIALLY DEFINED 
SO THAT AS LONG AS I AS LONG AS IT'S NOT A UNTIMED EVENT OKAY 
A AND AN END TIME 
SO IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S FINE 
I CAN SAY IT'S A LONG ONE 
OR IT'S A SHORT ONE 
OR IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S TWENTY MILLISECONDS MORE THAN THAT ONE 
THAT'S 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND OKAY I'M I'M ASKING YOU USE AN EXPERT 
THIS IS THIS THIS ISN'T A LEADING QUESTION 
THIS IS A QUESTION QUESTION 
WHY WOULD THAT BE INFORMATIVE PARTICULARLY 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
NO IT 
SO YOU THINK THAT F FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT UM ONE OR ANOTHER UM APEX OF A TRIANGLE IT WOULD JUST THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
THEY WERE EXPLORING THE THING AS OPPOSED TO THEY WERE SIMPLY ALRIGHT THERE IS IT THERE TO USE 
OKAY SO THE UM SO THAT REALLY MEANS THAT WE'RE NOT THROWING AWAY ABSOLUTE FIXATIONS 
THE SCREEN LOCATION OF ABSOLUTE FIXATIONS 
ALRIGHT 
UH-HUH 
AS OPPOSED TO IT IF IT 
SO YOU SEE I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD YOU TO MEAN EXPLORING THE FIGURE 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR FIXATION IS A POINT 
AND THE FIGURES ARE BIGGER THAN POINTS 
SO YOU COULD BE EXPLORING THE FIGURE OR YOU COULD BE JUST SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION DEFINED AS THE FIGURE BUT NOT ON IT 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT FINE 
THE 
SO YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW THE VARIABILITY OF THE OF THE FIXATION 
AND WOULDN'T THAT DIFFER FROM PERSON TO PERSON 
OKAY 
SO IT'S THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SPOTS WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE EYE HAS FIXED THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FIX OH OK OKAY 
SO IT'S A JIGGLE RATE OKAY 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
WELL ALL I TH UNDERSTOOD YOU TO ASK FOR WAS THE DURATION OF EACH FIXATION INSIDE 
YEAH 
YOU CAN COME BACK 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
SO IT'S THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FIXATIONS 
WELL ACTUALLY DO YOU WANT THE AVERAGE DURATION 
OR DO YOU WANT THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ONES 
DURATION OF EACH FIXATION ON THE REGION 
WELL YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THAT 
SO THAT'S A MEASURE OF JIGGLE IN THE REGION ROUGHLY 
MOVING 
OKAY 
WHAT'S OUR ERROR OF MEASUREMENT ON LOCATION ON THE SCREEN 
SO IT WHAT DEGREE DO WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHETHER THE TWO LITTLE EYES LITTLE CIRCLES ARE EXACTLY ON THE SAME PLACE OR JUST SOMEWHERE IN THE SAME REGION 
RIGHT OKAY 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
IT'S YEAH OKAY RIGHT 
OKAY 
SO MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT THE THE MOUSE IS A DYNAMIC OBJECT RIGHT 
THE EYE TRACK IS A DYNAMIC OBJECT 
OR IS IT ONLY THE THE PIECE THAT THE EYE TRA THE OTHER PERSON'S EYE TRACK IS NO THAT'S THAT'S AN OBJECT IN THIS DEFINITION 
IS A AS AN OBJECT 
OKAY 
WITH SOME WITH PLUS OR MINUS SOMETHING OR THREE YEAH AROUND IT 
SOME CIRCULAR AREA 
OKAY 
AND 
UM SO YOU CAN BE IN THE OBJECT BUT NOT IN THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE 
SO THERE CAN BE A TRIANGLE WHICH HAS A. 'S GAZE IN THE CENTRE AND YOUR GAZE ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO BE HERE 
YOU'RE IN THE TRIANGLE REGION 
DOES THIS 
OKAY 
BUT IT'S DIRECTLY ADDED WHEN WHEN THESE TWO ON THIS SITUATION WHEN THESE TWO OVERLAP RIGHT LIKE THIS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL IT WOULD COME UP IT WOULD SAY YES RIGHT 
I MEAN BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE IN THE SAME PLACE 
SO IF YOU YOU YOU'RE GONNA HAVE DYNAMIC REGIONS WHICH OVERLAP IN ANOTHER BY DEFINITION 
OF THE MOUSE IS IN THE CONSTRUCT THEN RIGHT RIGHT 
RIGHT 
WE TREAT THOSE AS AS OTHER OBJECTS 
BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND THE THE PARTS OF THE C THING TO BE CONSTRUCTED IS THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO OVERLAP WITH OTHER THINGS IS NOTHING BREAKS 
OKAY 
IF WE MM-HMM 
YOU 
MM-HMM 
YES AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY LOOKING AT SOMEBODY'S GAZE WHEN THE MOUSE ISN'T ALSO THERE RIGHT 
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW THESE THINGS 
RIGHT THEY'RE I THEY'RE INDEPENDENT DYNAMIC OBJECTS 
OKAY 
IS A DEFINITION OF WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT AND TOUCHING THE SAME THING 
SO IMAGINE THAT WE'VE JUST ADDED A PIECE TO THE CONSTRUCT ALRIGHT 
SO NOW THAT'S THE CONSTRUCT 
AND BOTH MOUSE SYMBOLS ARE ON IT RIGHT 
AND BOTH GAZES ARE ON IT RIGHT 
SO IT THAT POINT YOU SHOULD HAVE A LINE UP OF A. IS IN THE CONSTRUCT A. IS IN THE MOUSE 
A. IS AN A. IS AN A. 'S MOUSE A. IS ON B. 'S MOUSE A. IS ON B. 'S GAZE AND B. LIKEWISE 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
UH I LOVE THE ERASER 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT THE MOUSE IS ALSO A DYNAMIC OBJECT 
THAT'S FINE 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
AND THEN YOU THEN YOU LOOK FOR COMBINATIONS OF THEM 
YEAH 
I THINK WE NEED TO 
BECAUSE THE SAME MEASURE OF ALIGNMENT IS LOOKING WHERE THE OTHER GUY IS DIRECTING ATTENTION 
AND THERE ARE TWO MEASURES OF WHERE THE OTHER GUY IS DIRECTING ATTENTION THAT YOU GET FROM THE VISUAL TRACK 
ONE IS WHERE THE MOUSE IS AND THE OTHER IS WHERE THE GAZE IS 
SO 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
SO 
YEAH THAT ACTUALLY TRUE 
BE 'CAUSE 
RIGHT 
BUT THAT IT'S ALSO GONNA BE THE CASE THAT UM WHATEVER REGION YOU DEFINE AS THE REGION OF THE DYNAMIC OBJECT OF THE RED TRIANGLE MAY GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT OVERLAPS THE REGION OF THE DYNAMIC OBJECT OF THE GREEN SQUARE 
OKAY WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THAT 
YEAH BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THEM CLOSE TOGETHER THERE'S ALWAYS SOME FUZZ FACTOR AROUND THEM 
AND SO IF THEY'RE LEFT LYING CLOSE TOGETHER OKAY OR IN THE IN FACT IN THE MODEL IN THE NOT IN THE MODEL 
IN THE ON THE SUPPLIES SET THEY'RE ACTUALLY NEATLY PACKED INTO A LITTLE SPACE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SQUEAK SQUEAK 
YES 
BECAUSE THE TWO OR IS CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THEIR REGIONS OVERLAP 
MM-HMM 
THE GREATEST OVERLAP WITH WHAT 
UH UH 
I THINK I THINK YOU'RE THROWING INFORMATION AWAY 
YEAH 
BUT IT MAY BE A BAD IDEA 
IT MAY BE A BAD IDEA 
YOU'VE JUST THROWN DATA AWAY 
YEAH 
WELL 
THE GAZE WILL WOBBLE 
THE GAZE WILL WOBBLE 
THAT'S NATURAL 
MM-HMM 
OR INDEED THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER 
DO OR DECIDING WHICH ONE TO CHOOSE ARE THINKING SO YOU DON'T WANT TO DECIDE IT'S ONLY ONE AND THROW THE OTHER ONE IT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY WELL THAT'S FINE 
THAT I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT'S THE OBVIOUS WAY TO DO IT 
WELL EACH ONE IS YES OR NO 
COUPLE OF DOZEN 
RIGHT 
SIX TO A DOZEN USUALLY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I MEAN I THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT UM IF PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING F MM-HMM 
WELL NOT OF THE REGIONS OVERLAP OKAY 
OF THE REGIONS I 
RIGHT 
AND IF YOU DEFINE THE REGIONS SO NEATLY THAT THERE'S THAT 
YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE LOSING GAZE BECAUSE OF JIGGLE OUTSIDE THIS CLOSELY DEFINED REGION WHEN IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF SPACE THEN 
I MEAN I I ACTUALLY LIKE THE SOLUTION HOWEVER UGLY IT IT LOOKS IN TERMS OF A DATA FORMAT OF HAVING A TRACK FOR EVERY POSSIBLE OBJECT OF GAZE 
MM-HMM 
IS A THING 
MM-HMM 
WELL OKAY 
SO 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS BRILLIANT 
YEAH IT IS BIG AND YOU DO HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH IT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON 
BUT IT GIVES YOU A VERY CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON 
YEAH WELL OKAY 
BUT SO WE'D WE'D BETTER DO A TEST ONE AND AND LISTEN TO THEM SCREAM 
WITH PARTS 
RIGHT 
SO I MEAN SO 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO WHAT ABOUT THE POINT WHERE A PART BECOMES THE CONSTRUCT 
DO YOU STILL IDENTIFY IT IS A PART 
I MEAN I THINK ONE SHOULD ALSO THAT I TAKE IT 
'CAUSE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
SO YOU CHA SO EVERY TIME A PART IS ADDED TO THE CONSTRUCT IT BECOMES A NEW PART 
SO THE CONSTRUCT ACTUALLY UM HAS SAY IT HAS SIX THINGS THAT ARE ADDED TO SOME INITIAL THING OKAY 
SO IF THERE'S JUST THE INITIAL THING YOU'VE PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN THAT'S JUST THE INITIAL OBJECT RIGHT 
SOON AS YOU PUT A PART THERE'S A CONSTRUCT 
BUT IT'S CONSTRUCT ONE 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU ADD ANOTHER PART CONSTRUCT ONE CEASES TO EXIST AND YOU GET CONSTRUCT TWO RIGHT 
SO ACTUALLY DEFINING ALL OF THIS IS THE CONSTRUCT IS GONNA BE THE TRICKIEST THING 
RIGHT 
SO YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE RIGHT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT CEASES TO EXIST 
'CAUSE YOU CAN BUILD SUB ASSEMBLIES 
AND THEN YOU CAN START AGAIN 
ALSO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SCREW IT UP YOU G START AGAIN 
BECAUSE THE DEFINITION 
MM-HMM 
WELL THE PROBLEM IS THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE POPPING OUT OF EXISTENCE 
SO DO WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UM WE BREAK IT AND IT WENT AWAY AND UM IT'S NEW PART OF THE CONSTRUCT 
CAN WE IT CAN WE TAG THE CONSTRUCTS WITH WHAT'S ON THEM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO WE COULD WE COULD ESSENTIALLY WELL 
THEN WE COULD CUMULATI OR IT IS A NEW CONSTRUCT 'CAUSE IT HAS A NEW LIST OF A NEW CUMULATIVE LIST OF PARTS RIGHT 
BUT WE WILL 
RIGHT 
SO 
SO SOME FANCY PROGRAMMING'S GONNA HAVE TO BE DONE TO SAY I WAS LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE AND NOW I'M LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE ONE CONSTRUCT ONE 
'CAUSE THE FIRST CONSTRUCT WAS TRIANGLE ONE AND SQUARE ONE OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
SO NOW WE HAVE TO ASK WHETHER UM 
SO LE LET'S IMAGINE THOSE WE'VE MADE A CONSTRUCT OF TWO PARTS AND WE'RE C I A TRIANGLE AND A SQUARE 
AND WE'RE CONSIDERING NOW ADDING SOMETHING ON TO THE SIDE OF THE SQUARE THAT ISN'T ATTACHED TO THE TRIANGLE 
OKAY 
ARE WE LOOKING AT THE SQUARE OR WE LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT 
YEAH 
UH IN THIS DEFINIT SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT 
THERE ISN'T A WAY TO FIGURE OUT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SQUARE RATHER THAN THE TRIANGLE 
MM-HMM 
IT IS 
WELL 
OKAY BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THE EXAMPLE UM F PRESUMABLY THAT'S THE BEST EXAMPLE OF OVERLAPPING OVERLAPPING AREAS 
'CAUSE IF IF THE THING THE TWO IS THE TWO THINGS ARE NOW ABUTTED 
OF COURSE THERE'S AN AREA WHICH IS COMMON TO BOTH OF THEM OKAY 
UM SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO RUN THROUGH IN MY HEAD IS THAT WE CAN ALWAYS TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UM SOMETHING GOING OUT OF EXISTENCE 'CAUSE IT'S JOINED TO CONSTRUCT SOMETHING GOING OUT OF EXISTENCE 'CAUSE WE THREW IT AWAY 
RIGHT 
SUPPOSE WE PICK UP ON W W WE SCREWED UP THE FIRST TIME WE PUT THE TRIANGLE WITH THE SQUARE AND WE THREW IT AWAY AND DECIDED WE DIDN'T LIKE IT 
AND WE TAKE ANOTHER ONE 
SO AT TRIANGLE ONE 
SO AT TRIANGLE ONE PRIME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IT'S THE REPLACEMENT FOR TRIANGLE ONE 
MM-HMM 
WELL HOW DO I KNOW WHAT IT REPLACES 
NO NO 
UH THIS IS TRUE 
BUT IF I HAVE TRIANGLES IN TWO THREE RIGHT AND I THROW THEM AWAY ANY TRIANGLES I TAKE IT OR TO REPLACE ONE TWO THREE 
OKAY 
EXCEPT THAT EX NO YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE THEY'RE MEANT TO REPLACE 
BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO REPLACE ANY THAT ARE ALL THAT ARE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN THROWN AWAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
SO THE NEW PARTS ARE REPLACING THOSE WHICH HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE SCREEN 
AND IF THERE'S NO MORE T. R. ONE TRACK THE T. R. ONE TRACK IS GONE NOW 
OH THERE ARE MANY 
SAME IDENTITY 
UH SO THAT TRUE 
YOU'VE DECIDED NOT TO MAKE ALL THE TRIANGLES RED AND SQUARES GREEN AND 
OH OKAY 
RIGHT 
ONE TWO AND THERE 
THEY 
OKAY 
SO 
SO THERE 
SO SHAPE PLUS COLOUR 
OKAY 
THEY'RE UNIQUE 
ALL THE PARTS ARE UNIQUE 
SO WAI HANG ON 
THAT MAKES THE TASK A LITTLE BIT EASIER RIGHT 
THE UH ALL THE LINES 
SO 
INDEED 
WHICH KIND OF LEAVES YOU WITH AN OBVIOUS WAY OF MAKING THE SAME TASK HARDER AND USER DOESN'T IT 
BUT BUT THAT'S HARD TO CODE 
I MEAN THAT'S REALLY A THING WE MIGHT DO 
OKAY 
SO NOW LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THE CODING WOULD SURVIVE THAT 
IT'S JUST IT'S A BEAUTIFULLY CONTROLLED SITUATION 
THE CONSTRUCTION TASK IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME 
IT'S THE FIGURING OUT STUFF THAT GETS HARDER OF EVERYTHING IS PURPLE 
FOR A JUST TO CHOOSE A COLOUR AT RANDOM HERE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO IF YOU HAVE FIVE BLACK TRIANGLES THERE GONNA BE FIVE BLACK TRIANGLES IN THE PARTS BOX 
OR NO 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
AS LONG AS TO THIS IS POSSIBLE 
SO C THAT THAT JUST AS A KIND OF THING WHICH IS IS SIMPLE 
SO MUCH LIKE A SINGLE ONE ZERO VARIABLE CHANGE THAT OUT OF IT THAT DOESN'T ALREADY EXIST 
'CAUSE I'M TR I'M TRYING TO KINDA MAP THIS ONTO BAUFIX 
UM AND BAUFIX HAS HAS MULTIPLE YOU KNOW ALL THE THE 
THE THE V THE NOTES OR OR RADIO OR AND ALL THE UM FLAT THINGS ARE WOOD COLOUR SOMETHING 
THE SAME PART THE SAME PART IS DIFFERENT COLOURS 
OH YEAH 
SO WHEN YOU SAY A RED NUT OR A GREEN BOLT OR A LONG GREEN BOLT THEN THERE'LL BE LOTS OF THEM LYING AROUND 
AND I THINK THAT'S HOW THE ROBOT IS SET UP TO THREE OR FIVE FIVE GREEN BOLTS 
UH HERE IS NO YOU KNOW 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO 
OKAY 
SO WE UH ALL I'M I'M DOING IS KIND OF WORRYING TOO LOUD ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN THAT WE'LL MISS BY THE A SIMPLE VIEW OF FOR EXAMPLE REGIONS AND LOOKING AT AT TRIANGLE ONE 
WHEN IS TRIANGLE ONE NOT TRIANGLE ONE ANYMORE 
UM DOES IT IS KEEP ITS IDENTITY 
MM 
IDENTITY YES 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S TRUE 
SO HOW CAN WE DEFINE THE SHAPES THAT PEOPLE BUILD 
WELL 
IF ASSUMING I WAS FOR A MOMENT I WAS J. P. AND I WANTED TO KNOW HOW THEY ACTUALLY WENT ABOUT BUILDING THE THING 
OKAY 
AND I WANTED TO ME TO LOOK AT THE STRATEGY 
AND I WANTED TO USE OF THE STRATEGY WAS DIFFERENT WHEN WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT AND WHEN WE JUST PICKED UP WHATEVER 
I MEAN SUPPOSE I CAN'T TALK TO YOU AND I'M DOING THIS TASK WITH YOU AND I CAN'T TALK TO YOU 
UM 
THE THING WHICH IS GONNA BE HARDEST FOR ME IS MAKING ELABORATE PLANS WITH YOU 
I CAN REACH FOR THE NEXT THING AND YOU CAN GO WHERE I REACH 
BUT IF I HAVE SOME YOU KNOW SUB GOAL SOME LONG TERM SUB GOAL 
OF DOING SOMETHING CLEVER WITH PUTTING THESE TOGETHER 'CAUSE IT'S HARD AND THEN PUTTING THESE TOGETHER 'CAUSE IT'S HARD 
THERE IT'S GONNA BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY THAT IT YOU 
AND THE DIFFERENCE IN THE HISTORY OF CONSTRUCTION RIGHT AS AN IMPORTANT THING AND I WONDER HOW WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION BACK 
DO YOU THINK 
NO IT WHY IS NOT UH THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION I'M ASKING 
THE QUESTION I'M ASKING IS WHAT'S THE HISTORY OF THE CONSTRUCT 
SO YOU HAVE THE ON THE NAMES OF THE THINGS IN THERE 
AND YOU HAVE TWO CONSTRUCTS SUPPOSE WE HAVE TWO SUB CONSTRUCTS 
AND WHICHEVER ONE HAD TWO PIECES PUT TOGETHER FIRST IS THE EARLIER NUMBERED OF THOSE CONSTRUCTS RIGHT 
HOW DO YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADDING A PIECE TO THIS FIRST CONSTRUCT AND CREATING A SECOND CONSTRUCT 
MM 
OKAY 
IT'S IT'S IT'S PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP 
OKAY 
SO CONSTRUCT TWO COULD BE UM CONSTRUCT ONE IS UM A RED TRIANGLE AND A GREEN SQUARE 
CONSTRUCT TWO SO UM TWO GREEN SQUARES OKAY 
CONSTRUCT THREE RIGHT AS A RED TRIANGLE A GREEN SQUARE AND ANOTHER RED TRIANGLE 
CONSTRUCT FOUR OKAY 
OKAY 
AND YOU CAN SEE HOW ARE WE GONNA TELL WHEN FOR EXAMPLE YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO HUMAN CODING IN WHEN TWO SUB CONSTRUCTS ARE PUT TOGETHER 
NO THAT'S A DEFINITION WHEREIN A CONSTRUCT HAS A C HAS CONSTRUCTS AS CHILDREN 
OKAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
SO WE COULD ZIP WE COULD ZIP THROUGH THIS AND LOOK AT ALL THE UM ALL THE INTERACTIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE BUILD SUB CONSTRUCT CONTSTRUCTS FIRST WHICH WE EXPECT THEM TO DO BE AS A WILD HYPOTHESIS MORE WHEN THEY HAVE VERBAL COMMUNICATION THAN WHEN THEY DON'T 
OKAY 
AND WE CAN DO THAT BY SIMPLY SEARCHING FOR ANY CONSTRUCTS THAT HAVE CONSTRUCTS AS CHILDREN 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY MADE A REAL THAT YOU CAN'T UH COLLECT EXTRA PARTS RIGHT 
NO NO 
I MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE YOU HAVE TO BREAK ONE TO GET AN OKAY 
AND YOU CAN'T JUST BRING EXTRAS IN CASE YOU SCREW UP 
YOU HAVE TO SCREW UP FIRST AND THEN YOU CAN BRING AN EXTRA 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
I BUT IT DOES HAVE REPLACEMENT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THERE THERE'S A AS YOU S SO YOU APPRECIATE YOU APPRECIATE THE COST OF 
SCREWING UP 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM THAT'S RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
SO THEY REJECTED SOMETHING OR THEY BROKE SOMETHING INADVERTANTLY 
OKAY 
SO THERE A WAY OF 
TELLING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL BREAKAGES 
BEC YEAH 
NO YOU P THEY BOTH PUT THEY BOTH PUT THEIR HANDS ON A CONSTRUCT BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE IT 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
SO THAT JUST HAS TO BE CODED 
MM-HMM 
UM NOT GENERICALLY 
BECAUSE THEY'LL IF THEY'RE GONNA DO IT BY GESTURE THEY'LL BUILD UP A CONVENTION RIGHT 
WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED TO KNOW 
UNLESS THEY DEVELOP A CONVENTION 
SUPPOSE THEY START OFF WITH LANGUAGE AND THEN THEY THEY SAY HEY LIKE YOU KNOW LET'S DO IT LIKE THIS 
SURE 
ABSOLUTELY 
I JUST I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT A WISH LIST YES 
YES 
FOR SURE YOU KNOW THAT'S AND L OR WELL ONE IS NOT NECESSARILY INTENTIONAL 
THEY COULD JUST SCREW UP 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
OR I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY GOOD IN WE'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THAT WE'LL GET A BAD SCORE 
LET'S JUST THROW THAT WAY AND START AGAIN YEAH 
OKAY 
WHICH REMINDS WE HAVE FIXED THE SCORE PROBLEM 
HAVE WE 
RIGHT 
WAS THE PERCENTAGE OVERLAP AND THAT MADE THE SCORE 
YEAH 
THAT'S WHEN I LEFT 
OH YEAH WELL DO YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH WHICH WHICH ONE WAS THE TOP RIGHT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT THAT'S ALL BEEN FIXED 
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S BACK 
DON'T TELL ME IT WAS A FEATURE 
ALRIGHT 
OH OKAY 
OH 
SO 
HMM 
BUT 
THE RIGHT 
NOT PROMINENTLY FLAGGED 
OKAY 
A COMMUNICATION FLAW 
OKAY 
SO WE CAN NOW THAT'S NOW JUST LOVELY 
AND THERE WON'T BE ANY CRAZY SCORES ANYMORE 
OH 
I HAVE TO USE A NEW PAGE 
ALRIGHT 
SO THE LAST I THINK I'M SORRY YOU KNOW I HAD AS ASSORTED EMAILS FROM YOU AND I WAS PROBABLY DIDN'T CATCH EVERYTHING 
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THERE ARE TWO CAMTASIA RECORDS 
THEY DON'T USE THEIR OWN GAZE 
THEY USE THE O ONLY THE OTHER GUY'S GAZE RIGHT 
HUH-HUH 
OKAY 
I MEAN 
CHECK IT 
OKAY 
SO WE 
MM-HMM 
SO THERE MM 
SO THERE SUCH A THING UM SO UM YOU KNOW DUAL TRACK VIDEO 
BECAUSE YOU CAN CERTAINLY MIX THINGS 
UM WHAT IDEALLY ONE WANTS ONE DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO L TO HAVE THESE THINGS 
UH UM BECAUSE WE'RE USING THEM FOR BACK UP AND FOR CODING 
WE DON'T REALLY WANT TO PLAY THEM INDEPENDENTLY 
WE DO ALMOST ALWAYS WANT TO USE THEM IN EXACTLY IN PARALLEL 
TIME ALIGNED 
UM WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR SYNCHRONIZATION OTHERWISE 
OKAY 
SO THAT WE'D HAVE TO RE ALIGN THEM 
WE COULDN'T DUMP THEM FROM THEIR START POINTS 
WELL MAYBE YOU COULD 
THE THING THAT YOU'RE DUMPING THEM NOT JUST STARTS RUNNING WITH THE FLASH AND THE BLEEP 
YOU TURN ON THE TWO COPIES WHENEVER AT DIFFERENT TIMES 
BUT THEY'RE STILL IN 
SO THE WHAT WHAT I TH WHAT ARE THEY I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE THE PARTS THAT ARE OPERATING HERE 
TWO VIDEOS ARE TURNING ON 
THERE IS IN TIME STAMP THAT COMES FROM SOME COMMON SOURCE 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
RIGHT SO THERE A DIV MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO THEY'LL INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THE UM THE EYE TRACKER CALIBRATION RIGHT WHICH IS NOT A BAD THING ACTUALLY 
BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU WANNA GO BACK AND FIND OUT OF THIS WAS JUST A PARTICULARLY DUFF SUBJECT 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
AND HAND EVERY TIME WE RE CALIBRATED THE DAMN THING SLIPPED YEAH 
THAT ACTUALLY HELPS 
I MEAN THAT ONE 
RIGHT 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
NO THEY THAT ACTUALLY SAVES YOU HOURS TRYING TO MAKE SOMEBODY'S DATA SMOOTH OUT WHEN IT WON'T 
BECAUSE YEAH 
THAT'S A TECHNICAL TERM 
THAT'S A A TECHNICAL CATEGORIZATION IN PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE 
WELL WE NEED SOUND WE WE NEED REAL SOUND RECORDING RIGHT 
THAT'S THAT'S TWO TRACK 
THAT'S STEREO 
ALRIGHT 
UH-HUH 
NO WE ON WHAT 
OH SORRY 
OH 
NO ONE OF THE 
CAN 
O O IT'S UH 
NO CAMTASIA 
THAT'S OUR ONLY SOUND RECORD 
MM 
MM-HMM 
HOW GOOD IS IT 
YEAH 
HAVE TO REALLY QUESTION 
MM-HMM 
AND THEN THEN THEY CAN DO SOUND ANALYSIS ON THAT 
OH OKAY 
RIGHT 
SO WE THERE'S GONNA BE A WAY TO SOONER OR LATER TO ALIGN THE EYE TRACK CAMTASIA ON CAMTASIA TWO WITH TWO SOUND CHANNELS 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
UH THE BLEEP WE'LL FIND 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
THEY UH THEY ALSO TEND TO HAVE A FUNNY FUNNY SHAPE BEEPS 
SO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SO THERE AN END SIGNAL 
WHEN YOU DECIDE IT'S ALL OVER DOES IT PING YOU BACK AND 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
SO WHEN YOU'VE WHEN YOU'VE PRESSED WE'RE FINISHED IT PINGS BACK TO YOU 
OKAY 
IT'S JUST THAT ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING THINGS 
AND SO UP SAVING A PERCENTAGE OF A TRIAL IS SOMETIMES A GOOD I YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO DO THAT IS SOMETIMES A GOOD IDEA 
OKAY 
CAN WE 
YEAH CAN WE DO CAN WE DO SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT 
LIKE HAVING 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN IT'S IT'S CRAZY 
WE'RE IN AN ANECHOIC ROOM WHICH WE SPECIALLY YEAH BUILT AN ANECHOIC 
BUT YOU KNOW SOUND ROOM WHICH WE SPECIALLY BUILT FOR THIS 
WE'RE D IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES 
WE SHOULDN'T SCREW IT UP MORE THAN WE HAVE TO 
SO THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THIS 
NO 
NO NO 
DO YOU HAVE A POWERED MICROPHONE OR SOMETHING 
RIGHT 
THAT THE LINE IS STEREO THE INPUT IS MINE 
RIGHT 
SO THAT WHAT YOU SAID 
RIGHT 
SO UH 
THAT'S SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUND CARD 
YEP 
ITS OWN TRACK ITS OWN VIDEO 
YOU HAVE TO ALIGN THE VIDEOS ANYWAY RIGHT 
WELL I'M NOT THE TECHNICAL PERSON WHO WOULD DO IT 
BUT I KNOW WHO TO ASK 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BUT IT'S THE SAME AS 
MM-HMM 
SAYS ROBIN THINKING ABOUT CUTTING AND SPLICING YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I WANNA SEE SEVERAL OF THEM 
I WANNA SEE I WANNA USE ONE OF THEM UM LIKE REALLY NICE BEFORE WE START RUNNING SUBJECTS 
CAN WE DO THAT 
YEAH 
YES THAT'S RIGHT 
I JUST WANNA KNOW IT WORKS THE WAY YOU EXPECT TO TO WORK 
THIS IS NOT A A GESTURE OF MISTRUST 
THIS IS JUST EXPERIENCE THAT UM IF ANYTHING CAN SCREW UP TO WELL 
I I'M TRYING TO CHOOSE MY LANGUAGE CAREFULLY BECAUSE WE'RE BEING RECORDED 
BUT YOU'LL HEAR MORE CHOICE LANGUAGE AT THE POINT WHEN WE'VE ALL DONE A LOT OF WORK AND AND THEN WE DISCOVER WE CAN'T USE THE SESSION BECAUSE OF SOME THING WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT 
RIGHT 
UM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
AND THEN THEN WE COMBINE 
YEAH 
IT'S PROBABLY WORTH MENTIONING THIS AT THE AT THE GUYS IN THE GARAGE IN TORONTO RIGHT 
TO SAY MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
RIGHT 
I THINK THAT'S A OF THE DOCUMENTATION SAID IT WE COULD RECORD IN STEREO THEN I THINK WE SHOULD TALK TO THEM ABOUT HOW THEY'VE DONE THIS 
SO YOU'RE NOT SURE FROM THE DOCUMENTATION WHAT IT SAYS IT CAN DO 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY SO WHEN YOU I MEAN UH GIVEN THAT THERE ARE THESE EVENTS RECORDED 
WE CAN SEE ANY OF THEM AS THE BEGINNING OF ANY OF THEM AS A START POINT FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT 
UM THERE ARE ALSO MOTIONS BEING RECORDED OF OBJECTS 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
SO I'M RIGHT 
UH THAT THAT THAT'S GREAT 
I I'D BEFORE WE BREAK UP FOR LUNCH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT TH THAT I KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GONNA BE BEFORE WE'RE IN RUN MODE OKAY 
SO THE SOUND THING THE SOUND THING IS STANDS IN OUR WAY WE NEED TO BE RECORDING SOUND ONLINE 
OKAY 
SO THAT'S A THING THAT HAS TO BE SOLVED 
THE SHAPE THING IS SOLVED 
MM-HMM 
WE THINK 
WE BELIEVE 
RIGHT 
SO THAT'S THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE DONE THIS WEEK 
UM IN FACT LIKE TOMORROW FOR EXAMPLE 
UM THE SHAPE ALL THE SHAPE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED 
GENERATING SHAPES NO PROBLEM 
UM SCORING SHAPE OVERLAP NO PROBLEM 
NOTHING IS PROBLEM THERE 
THERE ARE NO VISUAL DISPLAY PROBLEMS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THEY HAD THREE 
THEY HAD THEIR INSPECTION LAST WEEK 
UM J. P. STAGGERED AWAY FROM IT AND 
OH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO 
UM I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T HAD ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM SINCE 
WELL HE'S PH HE'S PHYSICALLY HERE 
IF WE WANT TO PAY HIM FOR SOME MORE TIME WE CAN DO THAT 
WOULD THAT BE A JUST BETTER EASE OF OUR TIME IN GET 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
BUT UM UH UH UH IS AROUND AND I BELIEVE 
AND IF IF THE F I IF IT'S A 
RIGHT 
BUT IF UM IF EVERYBODY HAS A LOT TO DO AND YOU KNOW 
JOE COULD GIVE IT A COUPLE OF HOURS WHICH I SEE WHAT IT MIGHT TAKE JUST TO FIX IT 
THEN LET'S DO IT BECAUSE STARTING RUN TIME SO NOW GETTING TO BE FAIRLY URGENT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
BUT WE CAN'T WE CAN'T MAKE JOE DO THIS EC ALRIGHT 
SO THERE'S UH SOME TRADE OFF BETWEEN AVAILABILITY AND SPEED FROM START TO FINISH GIVEN THAT THIS IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S CODE 
SO YOU KNOW 
RIGHT SO WE'RE WE'RE B WE'RE BUILDING MODELS 
RIGHT 
WE'RE WE UM 
WE HAVE THE DESIGN SOMEWHERE 
MM 
HMM 
WELL 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I THINK SO 
'CAUSE UM I HAVE TO CHECK BACK WITH 
WITH J. P. FAIRLY SOON 
OKAY UH WANTED TO KN UM 
THE EIGHTEEN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTH PLAN GREAT 
DELIVERABLES GREAT 
PROGRESS WITH THE EXPERIMENT WELL THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW 
OKAY 
SO WHAT DO WE THINK IF YOU HAVE A FAIRLY HECTIC WEEK OR WE LOOKING FOR SUBJECTS NEXT WEEK 
OKAY 
ADS GO UP 
YEAH I D 
I D 
BUT I THINK AD SHOULD PROBABLY GO UP THIS WEEK 
WE WANT PEOPLE FOR ONE FOR NEXT WEEK 
SO THAT OKAY 
SO ANYBODY NOW TERRIFIED AT THE THOUGHT THAT WE'RE LIVE NEXT WEEK 
THERE ARE PEOPLE COMING IN HERE IN AFTER ANOTHER 
OR P TWO TWO AFTER TWO MORE LIKELY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY SO THE USE THIS IS THIS GENERALISED IS THIS GENERALISED ANXIETY ROBIN 
OR DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC THING THAT OKAY 
SO ASIDE FROM THE USUAL ANGST WHICH WE ALL SUFFER WHEN WE GO LIVE 
SO WE WE WE WANNA DO SOME PILOTING AT THE END OF THE WIKI 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
SO 
RIGHT 
SHE'S USING BUT SHE'S ACTUALLY RELAXED THAT SOMEWHAT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OSTENSIBLY BOOKED TIME WHICH ISN'T 
OKAY 
WE'VE BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE A SOLID BOOKING FOR ALL THE MORNINGS ANYWAY 
RIGHT 
AND L EXCEPT BY PERMISSION OF US ALRIGHT 
WE WIN IT 
UM SO WE CAN CHANGE THAT 
I MEAN THEY EVERYBODY ACKNOWLEDGED THE THE OTHER WEEK THAT WE THAT WE HAD PRIORITY 
OH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OH YEAH YEAH 
OH YEAH YEAH 
DON'T WORRY 
UM THERE'S THERE'S A BOOKING SYSTEM RIGHT 
SO IT'S PUBLIC WHAT'S BOOKED AND WHAT ISN'T 
OKAY 
NO 
ALRIGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD GET IN THERE AND BOOK MORNINGS AS FAR AS THE YOU CAN SEE 
ALRIGHT 
UH-HUH 
YEAH JUST A WELL WE THINK WE SPOKE TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WHO USED THOSE FACILITIES THE OTHER DAY 
BUT WE COULD BE WRONG 
SO 
RIGHT 
UM WELL THE TWO KEY HOLDERS ARE HERE 
UH I SEE 
FROM CAROLINE 
OR THE GENERAL OFFICE 
THE GENERAL OFFICE 
I SEE 
BUT NO THEY NEED A THEY NEED AN ACCENT ON THIS MACHINE TO ACTUALLY IT IS IT 
THEY NEED ACCOUNT ON THESE MACHINES SO THAT THEY COULD BOOK 
THEY COULDN'T ACTUALLY LOG IN 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON A WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT THE MATIN THAT THE MACHINES RETURN TO ZERO STATE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN YOU COME OFF THEM 
BECAUSE THE IT'S THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEAVING VAR UM WELL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEAVING VARIOUS BITS OF WHO KNOWS WHAT AROUND ON THEM 
RIGHT WHICH WHICH WE THINK SO WHAT'S CRITICAL 
OKAY 
UM PILOTING PILOTING PILOTING 
YOU HAVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THE THINGS 
WE HAVE TO TRY THE MUCH THE THINGS 
WE HAVE TO CHECK THEM WITH MARLOES AND J. P. THAT THEY LIKE THE REPRESENTATION THE VARIABLES RIGHT 
HOW ABOUT UH YOU HAVE ANY TIME ON FRIDAY 
I GOT A EMAIL BACK 
MAYBE YOU AND I SHOULD BE THE PILOT SUBJECTS 
FIRST PILOT SUBJECTS THE ONES WHO ME KNOW WHICH QUESTIONS WE WANNA ASK 
AND THEN WE SHOULD GET ANOTHER PAIR WHO ARE NAIVE TO THE WHOLE THING 
OKAY 
THIS IS GENERALISED FLOATING ANXIETY 
NO NO 
IT'S IT'S IT'S WISDOM 
BUT YEAH 
WELL UM BECAUSE ACTUALLY WE CAN I MEAN UH YOU KNOW IF WE MAKE COMMENTS THEY FEED BACK IN A LO INTO THE DEVELOPMENT 
OH FIVE HUNDRED HERTZ THOUGH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UH UM UM I UH I YEAH BUT THE P SORT OF START AND END TIMES WILL GIVE YOU BACK TO THAT OUTPUT 
A AS A AND THEN YOU JUST MEASURE IT AGAINST YOU KNOW THE C THE C YEAH THE CUMULATIVE TOTAL TIME RECORD OR SOMETHING 
SO 
MM-HMM 
B UH UH UM YEAH SO I'LL I'LL LAG IN SOME OF IT DURING THE I SUPPOSE THERE'S THE THE SACCADIC MOVEMENT ITSELF FOR EXAMPLE 
TH TH TH YEAH 
THE IT SHOULD STILL COME TO THAT THE LITTLE SKETCH I ASKED THIS UP FOR FOR LAST WEEK ABOUT N. X. T. AND WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE THAT SORT OF TIERED EFFECT SO YOU COULD USE THE OVERLAP OF WHERE ONE PERSON IS LOOKING COMPARED TO THE OTHER AND THEIR MOUSE MOVEMENTS AND THINGS 
THAT THAT SHOULD OR UH ADDRESS ALL THAT 
MM-HMM 
BUT BUT BECAUSE IT'S ALSO IN THE I BASED ON THE THE TIME COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BASICALLY GOT THE SCAN PATH OF THE PATTERN OF EVENTS FROM THAT AS WELL 
YEAH YEAH 
SO I DID HAVE IT SOMEWHERE 
I DIDN'T HAVE TO OUR UH HAVEN'T BROUGHT IT 
TRYING TO REMEMBER IT 
MM-HMM 
THE 
UH TO ME TO UM UH BUT UH BR AT THAT POINT THEY'RE ALL OF IT LUMPED ALL THE INDIVIDUAL FIXATIONS AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T MOVE OFF THAT TRIANGLE TOGETHER AS A TOTAL SORT OF GAZE GAZE TIME ON THAT 
YEP 
YEAH 
THAT THAT'S A TARGET WITHIN THE TARGET REGION 
UH UM 
UH-HUH 
UM YES SOMEWHERE 
MM-HMM 
IT IT SH YEAH IT I MEAN UH AS LONG AS WE'RE DIF R YEAH IT THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANYTHING MISSING 
THAT SHOULD BE ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
YEP 
UM UM YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YES 
SO WE YEAH 
SO WE IF WE HAVE AN AN EVENT YEAH THAT THAT YEAH THE SECOND LINE THEN FOR THE SECOND BEFORE IT 
AND THEN WE CAN JUST TAKE THAT CHUNK OUT AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT 
THAT SHOULD I I 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH WELL IF IT'S JUST BASED ON UH LIKE A A STABLE FIXATION FAR AS LONG OR OR SOMETHING AND CROSSING INTO THAT REGION 
YEAH 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM YEAH 
IT MM-HMM 
DON'T KNOW 
MM-HMM 
MORE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL HE'S REALLY INTERESTED IN 
MM-HMM 
SO WHICH ONE DOES 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT TO BE 
BUT WELL I DON'T KNOW 
BUT WE UH MM-HMM MM-HMM 
YES UH-HUH YEAH 
IT'S MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YOU CAN WE CAN ANNOUNCE NOW 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL 
UH BUT YOU YOU YOU 
YOU MEAN AT THE TAGS OF THE DATA W WITHIN IT 
YEAH 
SO SO THINGS LIKE FIXATION THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS A AND 
B UM YEAH WITH SOME SOME MEASURE OF THE SO WE COULD WORK AT THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS THAT MADE AND THE AVERAGE FIXATION DURATION AS WELL 
BECAUSE HAVING ST LONG STEADY FIXATIONS CAN BE INFORMATIVE 
UM IF IF THEY'RE HOLDING THEIR IF THERE'S LESS DANCING AROUND THE UM THE COGNITIVE FOCUS TENDS TO BE IN IN SORT OF PART 
SO UH THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IF THEY EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE SAME PART 
IF THEY'RE LOOKING AROUND IT UH RATHER THAN JUST HOLDING THEIR GAZE STEADY OR UM AND LONGER ON IT 
OH YEAH 
IT YEAH IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY IT'S IT'S WORTH MM-HMM 
OH NO I WOULDN'T WANT TO THROW IT 
PUT THE ACTUAL LOCATION 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I MEAN PRESUMABLY 
UH F WELL YES BUT THAT PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY TO GET IT BECAUSE YOU'D THEN HAVE TO BREAK UP UH THE PARTS SOMEHOW 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
UH IT IT YES IT CAN DO BUT IT'S ALSO LOOKING AT IT WITHIN THEIR THEIR OWN BEHAVIOUR TO USE YEAH 
UH THE W I I WOULD SAY JUST THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS 
I MEAN IT COULD JUST BE YEAH THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
EXACTLY 
SO 
MM-HMM 
I MEAN IT 
IT YEAH 
UH IF IF WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING THEN I SUPPOSE IT'S YOU CAN ALWAYS YES IT'S YOU'RE NOT THROWING ANYTHING AWAY THEN 
OR 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
UH BUT UH UH NUMBER UH WELL THE UH DURATION TIME AS WELL SOMEHOW 
WHETHER IT'S THE AVERAGE ONE OR 
OF THE FIXATION 
WELL 
THE THE AVERAGE SHOULD BE ALRIGHT UH TO WORK WITH 
THE THE 
UH WELL IF YOU'VE GOT THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS ON THE AVERAGE TIME YOU CAN THEN JUST GENERATE IT 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OH 
AGAIN UH THAT THAT SHOULD BE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DERIVE THAT PRESUMABLY FROM 
RIGHT 
UH THAT IT CAN VARY A BIT DEPENDING ON THE CALIBRATION 
BUT IF WE'RE BUILDING IN A SORT OF ERROR MARGIN UM IT IT WILL BE BASED ON PIXELS AROUND 
BUT THERE'LL ALSO BE A MINIMUM NO 
'CAUSE I'M TRYING TO THINK THAT IT'S PROBABLY THE SMALL THE ACTUAL MOUSE ICON IS SO SMALL 
IT'LL NEED A SLIGHTLY LARGER UH JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU HAVE I SEE A SORT OF LARGER ERROR OR OF B ERROR MARGIN AROUND IT 
OH NO 
THE O THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE POSITION AS WELL 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
TREA TREATED THE SAME AS AS THE MOUSE SAY 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
YES YEP 
YES 
SO IF THERE UH IF MM-HMM 
YES 
BUT NOT LOOKING AT THEIR INDIVIDUAL AND PR FACT THEY PROBABLY WILL AVOID LOOKING DIRECTLY 
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE LOOKING DIRECTLY AT IT IT'S OBSCURING 
THE THE PART 
MM-HMM 
YEAH MM-HMM 
THE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THE UM THE MOUSE THE GAZE AND THE PART ARE ALL LAYERED 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH UH IF WHEN THEY GET MOVED TOGETHER 
MM-HMM 
IT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
TWO OBJECTS CLOSE TOGETHER YOUR EYE GAZE CAN ACTUALLY BE LOOKING AT THE LEFT EDGE OF ONE AND THE RIGHT EDGE OF THE OTHER 
AND THEY'RE SOR THEREFORE LOOKING AT TWO OBJECTS AT ONCE 
SAYING THEY NEED SOME NEW PENS 
NEW PENS 
WHITE BOARD PENS 
MM-HMM 
UH UNLE UH BUT IT UH UNLESS WE JUST DEFINE IT IS THERE'S ONLY THEY'RE THEY ARE EXCLUSIVE 
AND WHICH EVER AREA M HAS THE GREATEST OVERLAP IS WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT 
WELL IT W IF IF YOU'VE GOT YOUR SORT OF EYE POSITION 
AND IT'S IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE EXACTLY FIFTY PERCENT IN AN OBJECT AND FIFTY PERCENT ON THE OTHER 
OH 
WELL I UH UH PUT THESE THINGS IN 
YEAH 
UH UH WHAT I'M I'M THINKING SO IF YOU'VE GOT SAY AN OBJECT THERE AND RIGHT 
YOU KNOW SO THIS IS 
THANK YOU 
UH PART IN AND PART TWO 
AND YOU'VE GOT THEY'RE SORT OF THEY'RE LOOKING 
THERE 
THEN THAT OVERLAP MEANS THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE TWO PIECES SIMULTANEOUSLY 
BUT 
YEAH UH JUST IF THIS IS THERE'S MORE OF IT UH YEAH I YES 
OH THAT'S W UH THAT'S THAT'S A DECISION WE'LL UH UH UH I'M SAYING IS IF THEY'RE LOOKING OF MOST OF WHAT THEIR OVERLAP IS HERE THEN WE STICK WITH THAT ONE 
OH THAT'S THE W IN THAT BECAUSE UM THE GAZE POSITION WILL BE A SORT OF FUZZY AREA 
IT WON'T JUST BE A PIXEL 
IT'LL IT'LL BE AN ACTUAL LIKE CIRCLE AND OR 
YEAH 
SO I I IT IT THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE W UH IT'S IT'S NOT JUST A SINGLE POINT 
IT'S IT'S A IT'S A SORT OF LUMP TARGET 
AND SO THERE'LL BE A BIT OF A A SORT UH SOME SORT OF OVERLAP OF TWO OBJECTS 
OR B YEAH THEY COULD JUST BE OSCILLATING MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH I MEAN IF IF THEY ARE OSCILLATING THOUGH THEN THAT'S PRESUMABLY GOING TO ST CHANGE THE WEIGHT 
SO YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO USE THEM FLIPPING BETWEEN UH WHEN YOU DECIDE THEY'RE LOOKING THERE MM-HMM IF THEY'RE REALLY CLOSE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OH YES 
THE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH I IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A PROBLEM UH BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE PART OR A CONSTRUCT FORMING IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIXATION 
SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE QUITE IS CLEAR IF YOU CAN'T CAN'T CHOP IT OFF 
UH-HUH 
AND THEN IT YES 
AND IT BECOMES CONSTRUCT OR ASSEMBLY WHATEVER TWO 
NO 
YOU CAN BUILD SUB SUB ASSEMBLIES AND THEN LINK THE THE PART REALLY YEAH 
I SEE EACH 
W W I TH UH 
WHICH CONSTITUENT PARTS 
CONSTRUCT 
YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT 
'CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT'S DIS DEFINED 
LOOKING AT AREAS WITHIN IT 
HMM 
UH W 
THEY CAN'T REPLACE UH THE NEW PARTS ONLY APPEAR WHEN THE PREVIOUS ONE'S BROKEN 
YES 
THEY CA THEY CAN APPEAR WITHOUT THEM 
YOU C 
UH WITH SOME SHAPE BUT NOT THE SAME SHAPE AND COLOUR 
UH SOME YOU 
YEAH 
YEP 
WELL THAT'S WELL THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE AT THE MOMENT 
OH 
YES 
SO THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS AT THE MOMENT 
UH I JUST ASSUME THAT'S HOW NI NIJMEGEN HAD SET IT ALL UP 
TH THAT'S THAT'S BACK TO UH TIM'S DAY 
THEY ARE INDIVIDUAL UH YOU HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS FOR THE YEP 
UNIQUE YEAH 
YES 
THE TAM TAMGRAMS ARE MUCH EASIER WHEN YOU CAN SEE 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
IT IS JUST A CONSTRUCTION TASK RATHER THAN A PUZZLE 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OH YES 
IT AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE D UH THERE ARE TWO I THINK TWO SMALL ONES AND TWO LARGE TRIANGLES 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY THE SAME PHYSICAL SIZE AND SHAPE 
AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE IN DIFFERENT COLOURS 
THAT ALSO MEANS ON THE P NEW PARTS LIST THEY'RE THERE FOR YOU KNOW TWO V LARGE TRIANGLES AND TWO SMALL ONE SMALL ONES SAY 
WHEREAS IN IN THE REVISED EDITION IF THEY WERE ALL JUST BLACK THERE'D ONLY BE IN UH MOLD IN THE NEW PARTS 
SO FAR AS I KNOW IT'S HARD WIRED 
IT JUST APPEARS SO 
MM-HMM 
THE POLYGON ONE POLYGON TWO WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE 
MM MM-HMM 
YEP 
HMM 
YEP SAME SAME PIECES 
MM-HMM 
NO SO THEY THEY CAN HAVE DIFFERENT UH NUTS THERE 
W WELL NUTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT COLOURS 
BUT SOME PART IN DIFFERENT COLOURS YEAH 
NO WHAT I MEAN THERE'S MORE THAN THEY'RE MULTIPLE PIECES THAT LIKE THE SAME 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND THE EXTRA PARTS DON'T APPEAR 
SO YOU CAN'T COLLECT THEM 
YEAH 
THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THEM THAT IT'S LIKE GREYED OUT 
THEY REALLY VERY FAINT 
SO YOU USE THE MOLD IS THERE 
BUT THEY DON'T COME FILLED UH UNTIL 
YES 
YES 
I I IT APPEARS IN THE NEW P UH LIKE UH SUDDENLY THE THE THE THE NEW PART LIGHTS UP SORT OF THING AND IT'S THERE 
YES 
THEY HAVE TO BRING IT INTO PLAY 
NO 
NOPE 
THAT YEAH 
THAT THAT IS ONE THINK UNLIKE THE SAY THE BAUFIX OR ANYTHING 
W I ASSUME THE THE BAUFIX 
THE OTHER AREN'T ANY EXTRA PARTS 
AND AT THE MOMENT THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T A ALLOW FOR THAT 
YES 
REPLACEMENT BUT NO SUPERFLUOUS SO YOU CAN'T HAVE A A STANDARD STOCK WITH EXTRA PARTS THAT IT'LL NEVER USE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
INTENTIONAL UM IN THE SENSE THAT THEY BREAK DELIBERATELY WHEN THEY BRING THEM INTO THE NEW PARTS 
BUT THEY CA YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THE TRASH CAN DO THAT THEY BRING A 
YOU HAVE TO HOPE THAT THERE'S LANGUAGE AND ONE OF THEM SAYS SOMETHING 
YOU C MM-HMM 
UH THERE'S NO THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD TELL THAT JUST FROM THE THE RAW MOVEMENTS OR OR SOMETHING 
MM YEP 
YEAH 
IT 
I 
ALTHOUGH 
WHAT I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER EASE OF THE PEOPLE DELIBERATELY BREAK THINGS BY MOVING TWO PIECES TOGETHER 
THEY THEY DON'T BOTH BREAK 
THEY BOTH THEY BOTH 
MM-HMM 
SO TH I INTENTIONAL THING IS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY BOTH CLICK ON THE SAME OBJECT AND IT BREAKS 
NO THEY COULD JUST MAKE A MISTAKE OR SCREW UP YEAH 
Y YEAH 
BUT THAT'S BRINGING IN THE THE LANGUAGE THING AGAIN 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH UH YES 
AT THE THE PERCENTAGE SCORE 
YEAH 
SO ARE YES RATHER THAN THE NUMBER OF PENALTIES OR OR SOMETHING 
IN THE THE SCORE W UH IS FINE 
UH Y THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY IT'S WORKED OUT 
BUT UH UH THE PROBLEM WAS UM TO DO WITH THE UM THE P THEY HAD A RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE PIECE AND UH IT'S ALL IT IS TO THE SYMMETRY OF THAT 
SO AS LONG AS IT'S DEFINED FINE 
YES 
IT WASN'T IT WASN'T A BIG 
IT IT IT WAS A 
UH WELL 
OH YES IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD TO BE DEFINED AND THE UH DUTCH LOT DIDN'T 
SO THAT WAS IT WAS ACTUALLY THEIR THEIR FAULT 
BUT UM IT'S NOT CLEAR ENOUGH ON THE DOCUMENTATION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT I IT IT IS QUITE FUNDAMENTAL AND UH CAUSES QUITE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS IF YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT 
YEP EXACTLY 
YEAH 
OR UH WE'RE WELL WE YEAH 
WE SHOULD SHOULD GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING 
THE UM CAMTASIA WAS TESTED LAST WEEK AND INITIALLY WE WERE A BIT WORRIED BECAUSE UH IN THE OLD VERSION IT SEEMED TO INTERFERE WITH IT 
BUT UH WHEN YOU WHEN CRAIG RE COMPILED IT AND DID HIS NEW VERSION IT STARTED WOR WOR IT SEEMS TO WORK FINE 
UM 
NOTHING WE CAN TELL 
NO UH 
MM-HMM 
NO 
YES 
THERE WILL NOW HAVE TO BE TWO CAMTASIA RECORDS BECAUSE UH E EACH PERSON ACTUALLY SEES A DIFFERENT SCREEN BECAUSE OF THE GAZE FEEDBACK 
THEY DON'T USE THEIR OWN GAZE AT THE OTHER PERSON 
SO THERE'LL NEED TO BE TWO SEPARATE CAMTASIA VIDEOS GENERATED 
HOPEFULLY WE WON'T 
YOU MEAN OFFICIALLY 
OR UH 
YEAH I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE I WAS ASSUMING WE'D JUST GOT ONE AND ONE LICENCE BOTH OF US 
SUPPOSE TECHNICALLY WE SHOULD HAVE TWO BECAUSE IT'LL BE TWO MACHINES 
I SUSPECT THAT IT WILL 
IT'LL BE PER MACHINE I WOULD THINK 
HMM 
I I'LL HAVE A UH YEAH I'LL HAVE A L A LOOK AT THE ACTUAL CAMTASIA LICENCE 
UM THE OTHER THING WE'RE WE 
IT 'CAUSE IT'S NOW TWICE TWICE THE SIZE OF A 
UH MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL THE OTHER PROBLEM IS UH CAMTASIA HAS TO BE MANUALLY LAUNCHED ON BOTH MACHINES SEPARATELY 
YEAH 
UH DURING THE TASK THERE IS A FLASH AND A BLEEP 
UH I MEAN NOT DURING THE TASK 
UH BEFORE 
FOR EACH TASK 
YES 
YES 
UH CAMTASIA Y YEAH 
BUT 
NO THEY'RE THEY'RE IN TWO IS THE TWO SEPARATE MACHINES AND THE YOU YOU START AND AND THEM SEPARATELY 
TH THEY THEY'RE NOT TALKING TO EACH OTHER 
THEY'RE JUST RECORDING 
YOU START IT RECORDING AND IT STARTS RECORDING WHAT'S ON ON SCREEN 
AND YOU START THE OTHER RECORDING ON THE OTHER MACHINE 
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE TOTALLY SEPARATE 
THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER ONE 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
YES 
OH YEAH 
SO HOW HOW LONG TO TAKE THEM ACTUALLY 
THAT'S THAT'S TRUE 
HOW LONG DID IT TOOK THEM TO CELEBRATE 
OR YEAH 
HOW MANY OUT HOW MANY TIMES BEFORE UH THE VALIDATION WORKED OR SOMETHING 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
I UH 
WELL IT AT THE MOMENT THE THAT'S WHAT I WAS ASSUMING ON ON ON DOING THAT UH IT'S DONE FIRST 
MM-HMM 
YOU GO BACK AND ACTUALLY YES THEY WERE CRAP 
ISN'T THAT THE ANSWER 
YEAH 
UM YES 
THE OTHER THING WE WERE GETTING SORTED OUT WAS THE THE MICROPHONES 
'CAUSE ONLY ONE OF THE UH CAMTASIA VIDEOS WILL ACTUALLY HAVE THE SOUNDTRACK 
UH WE'RE JUST GETTING WE'VE GOT ONE CABLE AND AT THE TWO MICS 
I SUPPOSE WE CAN DO IT IS IT WOULD TO BE WORTH SPLITTING IT 
OH YEAH 
SO THE TO TO TO THE MOMENT IT'S INS WELL 
WHAT WE'VE FINALLY JUST UH AT TWELVE O'CLOCK TODAY LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT IT SUSSED UM SO TO GET ONE CHANNEL ONE MICROPHONE BEING THE LEFT CHANNEL AND ONE BEING THE RIGHT CHANNEL TO MERGE INTO A STEREO SINGLE FILE 
OH UNFORTUNATELY THE ONE ONE MACHINE 
THE DISPLAY P. C. S 
YEAH THE CAMTASIA V VIDEO 
OR M M MULTI MEDIA THING 
YEAH 
YES 
IT IT'S 
YEP 
IT'S CAMTASIA THAT'S RECORDING IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO SO UM SO I ASSUME THAT WILL ONCE YOU'VE THAT SORT OF INFORMATION YOU WILL YOU GET THE G. D. F. FORMAT 
YOU THEN FILTER OUT TO SAY RIGHT BETWEEN TIME X. AND TIME Y. THEY'RE THEY'RE CONSTRUCTING THAT HAVING TRIANGLE ONE AT THE CONSTRUCT 
AND THEN YOU JUST SAY IN THAT TIME PERIOD WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE THEY LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE 
WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE THEY LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT 
DOES THAT SOUND DOES THAT SOUND REASONABLE 
YEP 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH ALL ALL THE ALL EVENTS HAVE A START TIME AND AN END TIME 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 'CAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S GONNA CO THAT'S 'CAUSE B THE DIAGRAM WE GOT THERE SUGGESTING THAT THEY'RE ONLY LOOKING THING TO TIME 
SO WHETHER IT'S TRIANGLE OR WHATEVER ELSE 
BUT IS WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THERE IS THEY CAN BE LOOKING AT THE TRIANGLE AND MAYBE A MOUSE POINTER AND MAYBE AN EYE AT THE SAME TIME 
OKAY OKAY 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH YEAH 
'CAUSE YOU GET C 'CAUSE YOU 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEP YEP 
OKAY YEAH 
SO SO YEAH 
SO SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF ADDING THESE THE TWO MOUSE POINTERS AND THE UM TWO GAZES AS EXTRA OBJECTS 
UM SO YEAH 
AS LONG AS AS LONG AS THEY'VE GOT AN I. D. IN THERE WE CAN JUST SAY RIGHT AT THIS UP BETWEEN THESE TIMES THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT OBJECT OR THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE MOUSE 
THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHATEVER 
YEP 
YEAH 
PENS 
I CONFUSE 'EM 
YEAH 
THAT WOULD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL THING IS THAT WITH 
YEAH 
THING THING IS W. G. D. S. FORMATS IS WOR IS WORKING AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S ACTUALLY GOT A SEPARATE TRACK FOR EACH PART 
SO 
YEAH 
WELL THE 
WELL TH TH TH IT DEPEN DEPENDS ON THE DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU BUILD IN 
THERE'S DIFFERENT PARTS THERE'S DIFFERENT PARTS WHETHER YOU'RE DOING THE TAMGRAM OR WHETHER YOU'RE DOING AN AIRPA AIRPLANE OR WHATEVER 
UM 
BUT TH BUT IS ABOUT THING IS IF IF WE IF WE GOT IF WE GOT TRACKS FOR EACH FOR EACH PART WE CAN WE CAN EASILY ANALYSE IT DOWN LATER ON 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL TH TH TH TH DOESN'T REALLY LAST PART IN THE ON THE G. D. F. 
UM SO YEAH 
THAT THAT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
THERE IS THAT BAS BASICALLY WHAT I'VE GOT AS WELL THERE THERE THERE'S PLACES WHERE YOU GET THE I. D. THOUGH 
SO YOU'VE THE IN I. D. FOR A PART YOU GET AN I. D. FOR A LOCATION ON THE SCREEN 
SO IT SHOWS YOU THE TARGET CONFIG THE CLOCK WHATEVER ELSE 
UM AND THEN WE CAN EASY ADD I. D. S FOR THE TWO MOUSE POINTS AND THE TWO GAZES 
UM AND FROM THAT AND BA BASICALLY ALL ALL THE ALL THE TRACKS ARE DOING IS SAYING AT THIS BETWEEN THIS TIME THERE'S A LOOK AT THIS O THIS OBJECT 
YEAH TH THIS I. D. 
UM SO UH SO IT'S EFFECTIVELY A TRACK FOR EACH I. D. 
TH TH YEAH TH BUT BUT 
WELL WHA WHA WHAT HAPPEN WHAT HAPPENS THERE IS THAT THE THE TWO THE THE EXISTING PARTS BASICALLY CEASE TO EXIST AND A NEW PART WITH A NEW I. D. STARTS EXISTING AT THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE JOINED 
YEP 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE WAY HE'S WORKING THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE IT UH THE IT'S IT'S GENERATING A NEW I. D. WHEN YOU C WHEN YOU CREATE A NEW PART 
UM 
YEAH 
UM YEAH 
BUT THERE THERE'S THERE'S JOINT EVENTS 
SO IF THE OF A JOINT EVENT IF IF IF IT'S THERE'S JOINT EVENT LINKED TO LINKED TO THE TIME THEN YOU KNOW IT'S BECOME PART OF A CONSTRUCT 
UM OF UM 
YEAH TH TH TH YEAH 
THE CON THE CON THE CONSTRUCTS ARE ALREADY TAGGED WITH THAT 
SO THAT I'M ACT THERE'S ACTUALLY A AS A SEPARATE FILE OF THE DATA FORMAT WHICH SAYS FOR EACH CONSTRUCT 
WHICH WHICH TWO PARTS MADE IT MADE THAT COME TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT CONSTRUCT 
YEAH 
BUT YOU CAN STILL TO YOU CAN STILL TRACK WHAT PARTS WENT INTO IT 
SO YOU CAN STILL FIND TRIANGLE ONE WHATEVER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT BUT THAT'S EASY N UH IT'S EASY TO DO BECAUSE THE THE CO EACH CONSTRUCT HAS THE I. D. S FOR THE P THE THINGS THAT CONSTRUCT IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL WE'LL DO YEAH WELL WITH THE YEAH D WELL THING IS THAT WE WE STILL HAVE THE X. WA THE X. WAVE TRACES FROM THE ASCII FORMATS 
SO IF IF YOU WANT IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY I'M LOOKING AT A SQUARE INSTEAD OF I'M LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT 
THAT'S IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THAT DATA IT 
UM IT'S IT'S YEAH 
IT'S IT'S NOT DOING IT'S NOT DOING IT IN THE GEST ANALYZER AT THE MOMENT 
BUT I CAN EASILY ADD TO TO GIVE THAT INFORMATION IF YOU WANT 
YEAH IF IF YOU TAKE IT IF YOU T IF YOU CREA IF YOU CREATE A NEW PART TO UH IT GETS A NEW I. D. 
SO IF YOU GET IF YOU DRAG A NEW PART OUT OF THE PARTS BIN 
OH 
YEAH I MEAN THE W E 
YEAH I MEAN YOU KNOW WHO YOU KNOW WHICH WAY THEY MATCH 
SO YOU CAN 
YEAH THE 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO YEAH 
YEAH SO I THINK THAT ANYTHING'S LOADING 
THERE'S THERE'S THAN TWO TRIANGLE ISN'T THERE 
THERE'S TWO IDENTICAL TRIANGLES IN THE TAMGRAM 
UM 
WELL YEAH YEAH 
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SPECIFY THE MOLDS IN THE ON THE ON THE P THE FILE THAT C THAT GENERATES THE PARTS LIKE A LIST OF PARTS 
THE MOLDS ARE BAS JUST TAKEN OUT OF THE THE FILE THAT GENERATE THAT SPECIFIES THE PARTS 
SO SO UH HOWEVER MANY PART HOWEVER MANY MO HOWEVER MANY PARTS THERE ARE IN THE FILE THAT'S HOW MANY PARTS APPEAR IN THE ON THE PARTS BOX 
IF YOU HAVE FIVE BLACK TRIANGLES GONNA BE FIVE FIVE PARTS IN THE F FIVE BLACK BLACK TRIANGLES IN THE PARTS BOX 
BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WELL IF IN THE ON THE INITIAL CONFIGURATION YOU CAN OR IS A TRIANGLE 
SO IF YOU SEE IF YOU ONLY WANT IN BLACK TRIANGLE 
YOU JUST CREATE IN BLACK TRIANGLE ONE THE PARTS BOX AND THEN OR IS THAT UP THAT TRIANGLE FIVE TIMES IN THE CONFIGURATION 
YEP 
YEP 
WELL WHEN THE WHEN THE F WHEN THE FINAL CONSTRUCT THE THE WAY THE THE WAY THE THE CONSTRUCTS ARE DEFINED IN THE FILE 
YOU'VE GOT LIKE YOUR P YOUR PARENT CONSTRUCT AND THE PARTS THAT IT'S CONSTRUCTED OUT OF 
UM AND YEAH SO I SAY THE 
YEAH YEAH 
SO YOU GOT PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP AND I THE CHILD CAN BE A PART OR IT CAN BE ANOTHER CONSTRUCT 
YEAH YEAH 
'CAUSE UH THERE'S A JOINT ACTION 
THE RESULT THE OUT WHAT YOU NEED FOR A JOIN ACTION YOU NEED TO YEAH A CONSTRUCT AND A PART TWO PARTS WHATE WHATEVER YOU'RE TAKING TOGETHER 
AND THEN THE RESULT OF THAT IS A CONSTRUCT 
YOU'VE GOT TIME WHEN THAT HAPPENS 
YOU CAN SEE THAT CONSTRUCT APPEARED AT THAT TIME 
UM AND YOU CAN STILL TRACK THE CHILDREN OF THAT CONSTRUCT 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL BY BY THE BY THE TIME BY THE TIME THEY'RE DOING THAT THEY MUST HAVE ALREADY BROKEN SOMETHING 
SO YOU'LL SEE YOU'LL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE REPLACING 
SO 
UH THEY DO 
IF IF IF WHAT IF ONE OF ONE PERSON'S TRYING TO GET A PART TO A PART THAT ISN'T THAT THAT IS THE PART THAT'S JUST SITTING ON THE SCREEN THAT'S NOT BEING TOUCHED 
THEY BOTH BREAK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH WELL YEAH 
'CAUSE YEAH 
C 'CAUSE IT WAS THROUGH THE ROTATIONAL PART 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN I'M 
I'VE TH I'VE YEAH 
IT'S IT'S IN THE DOCUMENTATION 
BUT IT'S LIKE TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY DOWN A QUITE A LONG PAGE 
SO 
YEP 
BUT UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
NO TH TH TH THERE'S THERE'S VERY SMALL GRAPHICAL BUGS 
BUT IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT BIG THING 
IT'S LIKE COUPLE OF WHITE PIXELS UH IN THE COURSE OF A IN THE COURSE OF A THE COURSE OF A TASK 
SO IT'S THERE'S DISTRACTING 
NO 
YEAH BUT THEN THE QUE THE QUE THE QUESTION IS THERE A LICENCE FOR CAMTASIA WHERE YOU JUST NEED ONE EDITING C THING AND TWO RECORDING THINGS 
'CAUSE YEAH THE OR THE RECORDING YEAH THE RECORDING THI PRO PROGRAM IS JUST QUITE A IT'S QUITE A SMALL PROGRAM 
THEY JUST GEN IT JUST GENERATES THE VIDEO AND SO I DON'T KNOW DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH HAVING A LOOK AT THE LICENSING FOR THAT JUST TO USE 
YEAH 
YEP 
MM 
YEAH 
NO YOU GET YOU 
YEAH YOU GOT EXACTLY THE SAME ACCESS TO SOUND QUALITY AS YOU GET FROM ANYTHI ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WINDOWS 
SO YOU CAN YOU DECIDE WHATEVER QUALITY YOU WANT 
SO GOT A BIT OF 
OH YEAH 
BECAUSE THE THE SYNCHRONIZATION THE AUDIO AND VI THE AUDIO VISUAL SYNCHRONISATION COMES OUT A SPECIFIC POINT IN THE EYE TRACK FILE 
NO IT'S YEAH TH IT'S I I STA STAMPED INTO IT 
SO IT'S JUST AFTER JUST AFTER IT PRINTS THE LINE STARTING EXPERIMENT UH UH YEAH 
I'LL I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S JUST YEAH 
YEP 
UH WELL THE WELL THE MATLAB SCRIPT UH BAS JUST USE UH JUST SAYS UH YEAH 
GI GI GIVES YOU THE TIMES OF THE AUDIO BEEP IN THE S IN THE SIGNAL 
SO I JUST 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
PRETTY CONFIDENT 
BUT YOU YOU'VE YOU'VE SEEN THEM 
IT IT WAS IT WAS 
YEAH 
YEAH I DON'T SEE HIM WITH TEN HE KILOHERTZ 
YEAH 
YEAH TH TH TH THERE'S A SIGNAL TO THE START AND THE END OF EVERY TRIAL 
SO 
YEP 
YEP 
YES IT'S A STEREO JACK 
IT'S A STEREO JACK 
BUT IT'S A MENU BUT IT'S A MENU UH MICROPHONE 
MONO MONO RECORDING ON MICROPHONES 
LINE IN 
UH SP GOING GOING THROUGH A LINE IN 
SO IT'S A SO IT'S A LOT SO IT'S QUIETER BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS THOUGH IT'S NOT POWERED 
BUT IT'S STILL THINK YEAH 
WE WE STILL PICK UP A SIGNAL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL THE THE WHEN THEY ARE THEY ARE THE THE THEY HAVE BATTERIES IN THEM 
BUT I THERE'S NOT DOESN'T 
BUT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE POWERED BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE LINE IN INPUT'S SO LOW 
THE USE THE SOUND THE SOUND THE S 
WELL TH YEAH TH TH YEAH THE THE THE THE JACK THAT IS THAT IT'S PLUGGED INTO IS STEREO 
BUT WHEN YOU PLUG IN WHEN IT'S RECORDING FROM MICROPHONE IT RECORDS ON MINE 
AND YEAH 
A NEW SOUND CARD IS FIXABLE 
YEAH 
ALSO THINK WE WE HAVE A WELL I SUPPO I SUPPOSE IT WILL IN THE ONE THING YOU DO IS UH OR IS RECORD THE SOU SPEECH SIGNAL SEPARATELY FOR EACH FOR EACH PERSON 
BUT THEN YOU'D HAVE TO PULL THE TWO PULL THE TWO SOUNDS TOGETHER 
SO IF UH SO IF I I IF EACH MACHINE RECORDED ITS OWN WITH A RECORDED THE RECORDED LIKE THE THE P THE THE UH THE USER ON THAT ONE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH THEY YEAH 
AND THEN THE USE THE YEAH 
SO THE 
YEAH IT'S EASY 
EASY 
IF IF NOTHING IF NOTHING ELSE YOU UH UH IF NOTHING ELSE YOU CAN DO IT IN A MATLAB SCRIPT 
YOU JUST WRITE READ READ FILE ONE READ FILE TWO 
AND THEN YOU JUST YEAH 
YEAH BUT THEN THE THE THE MATLAB THE MATLAB SCRIPT WILL TELL YOU HOW L IT WILL TELL YOU HOW FAR APART THEY ARE 
'CAUSE YOU CAN DO YOU CAN JUST MEASURE THE DRIFT BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM 
'CAUSE YOU GOT A L YOU GOT A LIST OF WHERE THE WHERE THE BEEPS OR 
AND THEN YOU SAY RIGHT THIS STREAM IS LIKE I DON'T KNOW NOUGHT POINT TWO FIVE SECONDS BEHIND THE OTHER ONE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO THEN 
THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME SOUND CARD 
SO YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
'CAUSE 'CAUSE 'CAUSE 
YES 
YEAH 
SO THE THE EXTERNAL VERSION'S GOT PLUGS THAT SIZE AND THAT THAT IS STEREO MICROPHONES 
BUT YEAH 
THE OTHER ONE'S PLUG'S LIKE THE SMALLER SIZE AND THAT ISN'T STEREO 
SO THE COLOUR THE COLOUR CAN DO IT 
IT'S JUST THAT THE CONNECTORS ON THE THE CONNECTORS AT THE BACK OF THE COMPUTER CAN'T 
YEAH 
BUT AS AS FAR FAR AS WE CAN AND FIND THE THE WEB SITE OF THE YEAH THE THE CREATIVE LABS WEB SITE AND THE REVIEW OF IT 
UM AND THEY WEREN'T ENTIRELY CLEAR 
BUT THEY BOTH SUGGESTED THAT IT IS THERE IS A MENU THAT THERE THERE IS A MONO MICROPHONE 
YEAH 
YEAH I'M 
YEAH 
SO AND BASICALLY TO THE OUTPUT THE G. D. F. IS JUST GONNA BE A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS YOU KNOW WITH START AND END TIME 
AND THE EVENT'S GONNA HAVE WHATEVER ALL WHATEVER THE OBJECT UH SO THAT'S BEING LOOKED AT AND THINGS 
UM AND THEN YEAH AND THEN IT'S A MATTER IF WE'RE GONNA PUT WHATEVER FILTERS YOU AND AFTER THAT 
SO YOU CAN SAY RIGHT 
I JUST WANT SO YOU CAN SAY FROM THE TIME WHERE THEY PICKED UP TRIANGLE ONE AT THE PART TIME IT BECAME PART OF THE ASSEMBLY 
FIND OUT HOW IT'S HOW M PERCENTAGES OF TIME THEY WERE LOOKING AT IT OR WHATEVER 
YEP 
SO YEAH 
SO YOU GET UM YEAH 
THERE THERE'S MOVE EVENTS 
THERE'S LOOK EVENTS 
THERE'S FIXATIONS AND BLINKS NOW AT THE MOMENT AS WELL 
UM AND YEAH AND UH YEAH AND SO HE LIKES IT LOOKS AT OBJECTS AND LOOKS WHATEVER ELSE 
SO UM SO 
YEP 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH I WILL 
YEP 
YEP 
OKAY 
FAIR ENOUGH 
OKAY 
WELL YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
SO WE'LL WE'LL GET WE'LL GET THE GET THE AUDIO STUFF TESTED YOU KNOW SINGLE MICROPHONES 
UM YEAH 
GET THAT TESTED NEXT COUPLE DAYS AND I ASSU I ASSUME THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU NEED UM FOR IT IN TERMS OF THAT 
YOU DON'T YOU DON'T NEED ME INVOLVED IN THE PILOT DO YOU 
AS WELL UNLE UNLESS UNLESS IT'S A BUG REPORT YEAH 
I'LL W YEAH W I'LL I'LL I'LL BE I'LL BE AROUND 
BUT YEAH I'LL MAKE SURE 
BUT UH HOPEFULLY IT WILL RUN SMOOTHLY AND YEAH I CAN RELAX 
SO 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
UM WELL THIS IS THE KICK OFF MEETING FOR OUR OUR PROJECT 
UM AND UM THIS IS JUST WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES 
UM SO FIRST OF ALL JUST TO KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER I'M LAURA AND I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER 
DO YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF AGAIN 
OKAY 
GREAT 
OKAY 
UM SO WE'RE DESIGNING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL AND UM UH I HAVE TO RECORD WHO'S HERE ACTUALLY 
SO THAT'S DAVID ANDREW AND CRAIG ISN'T IT 
AND YOU ALL ARRIVED ON TIME 
UM YEAH SO DOES UH DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
UM SO YOU CAN SEE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY 
UM SO THAT'S KIND OF OUR OUR BRIEF AS IT WERE 
UM AND SO THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT STAGES TO THE DESIGN 
UM I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED UM IN YOUR EMAILS 
WHAT DID YOU GET 
MM-HMM 
SO THAT WHAT EVERYBODY GOT 
OKAY 
UM 
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE INDIVIDUAL WORK AND THEN A MEETING ABOUT IT

UH AND HE'S QUITE QUITE WEE AS WELL AS YOU KNOW HE CAN DOESN'T TAKE UP TOO MUCH SPACE 
UM 
AND UH AND UH DOES A FUNNY THING WHERE HE CHASES HIS TAIL AS WELL WHICH IS QUITE AMUSING SO 
IT IS 
I THINK IT IS

RIGHT UM WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS 
JUST DOWN HERE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM WHAT ARE WE DOING NEXT

OKAY UH WE NOW NEED TO DISCUSS THE PROJECT FINANCE 
UM 
SO ACCORDING TO THE BRIEF UM WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING THIS REMOTE CONTROL FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO UM AND WE'RE AIMING TO MAKE FIFTY MILLION EURO 
UM SO WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING THIS IN AN INTERNATIONAL SCALE 
AND UH WE DON'T WANT TO TO COST ANY MORE THAN UH TWELVE FIFTY EUROS IS FIFTY PERCENT OF THE SELLING PRICE 
SURE 
ALL TOGETHER 
UM I DUNNO 
I IMAGINE THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION 
I IMAGINE IT PROBABLY IS OUR SALE ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY UP TO THE 
THE UM THE RETAILER TO UH SELL IT FOR WHATEVER PRICE THEY WANT 
UM 
BUT I I DON'T KNOW 
I MEAN DO YOU THINK THE FACT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE SOLD INTERNATIONALLY WILL HAVE A BEARING ON HOW WE DESIGN IT AT ALL 
THINK IT WILL 
UM 
HMM 
OH YEAH REGIONS AND STUFF YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
WELL FOR A REMOTE CONTROL DO YOU THINK THAT WILL BE I SUPPOSE IT'S DEPENDS ON HOW COMPLICATED OUR REMOTE CONTROL IS 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
WHAT JUST LIKE IN TERMS OF LIKE THE WEALTH OF THE COUNTRY 
LIKE HOW MUCH MONEY PEOPLE HAVE TO SPEND ON THINGS LIKE 
YOU I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN YEAH 
MARKETING 
GOOD MARKETING THOUGHTS 
OH GOSH I SHOULD BE WRITING ALL THESE DOWN 
UM 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
LIKE HOW MUCH DOES YOU KNOW A REMOTE CONTROL COST 
WELL TWENTY FIVE EURO I MEAN THAT'S ME 
THAT'S ABOUT LIKE EIGHTEEN POUNDS OR SOMETHING ISN'T IT 
OR ONE IS IT AS MUCH IS THAT 
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN POUNDS 
UM I DUNNO I'VE NEVER BOUGHT A REMOTE CONTROL SO I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW GOOD A REMOTE CONTROL THAT WOULD GET YOU 
UM 
BUT YEAH I SUPPOSE IT HAS TO LOOK KIND OF COOL AND GIMMICKY 
UM RIGHT OKAY 
LET ME JUST SCOOT ON AHEAD HERE 
OKAY 
UM WELL D DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO UH AT THE FINANCE ISSUE AT ALL 
THEN 
NO ACTUALLY 
THAT WOULD BE USEFUL THOUGH WOULDN'T IT IF YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT YOUR MONEY WOULD GET YOU NOW 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
OH 
FIVE MINUTES TO END OF MEETING 
OH OKAY 
WE'RE A BIT BEHIND 
YEAH 
RIGHT SO DO YOU THINK THAT SHOULD BE LIKE A MENU DESIGN UM OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL DO YOU KNOW 
DO YOUR YOUR SATELLITE AND YOUR REGULAR TELLY AND YOUR V. C. R. AND EVERYTHING 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OR EVEN LIKE YOU KNOW NOTES ABOUT UM WHAT YOU WANNA WATCH 
LIKE YOU MIGHT PUT IN THEIR UH I WANT TO WATCH SUCH AND SUCH AND LIKE A UH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
SO EXTRA FUNCTIONALITIES 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
UM OKAY UH I'D WEL WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WRAP UP PRETTY QUICKLY ON THE NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES 
UM I'LL JUST CHECK WE'VE NOTHING ELSE 
OKAY 
UM SO ANYTHING ELSE ANYBODY WANTS TO ADD ABOUT WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS THEY'VE USED 
WHAT THEY WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BE PART OF THIS NEW ONE AT ALL 
YOU KEEP LOSING THEM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
W YOU GET THESE ONES WHERE YOU CAN IF YOU LIKE WHISTLE OR MAKE A REALLY HIGH PITCHED NOISE THEY BEEP 
THERE I MEAN IS THAT SOMETHING WE'D WANT TO INCLUDE DO YOU THINK 
DUNNO 
OKAY MAYBE 
MY GOODNESS 
STILL FEELS QUITE PRIMITIVE 
MAYBE LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN OR SOMETHING 
OKAY 
UH-HUH OKAY 
WELL I GUESS THAT'S UP TO OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
IT LOOKS BETTER 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT WELL UM SO JUST TO WRAP UP THE NEXT MEETING'S GONNA BE IN THIRTY MINUTES 
SO THAT'S ABOUT UM ABOUT TEN TO TWELVE BY MY WATCH 
UM SO INBETWEEN NOW AND THEN UM SO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL WORKING DESIGN OF IT AS YOU YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE 
UM FOR USER INTERFACE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS I GUESS THAT'S YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT'LL ACTUALLY DO 
UM AND UH MARKETING EXECUTIVE 
YOU'LL BE JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT ACTUALLY WHAT YOU KNOW 
WHAT REQUIREMENTS IT HAS IT HAS TO FULFIL AND YOU'LL ALL GET INSTRUCTIONS EMAILED TO YOU I GUESS 
UM 
YEAH SO IT'S THE THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN STAGE IS NEXT I GUESS 
AND UH 
AND THAT'S THE END OF THE MEETING 
SO I GET THAT LITTLE MESSAGE A LOT SOONER THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD USE 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH YEAH 
OKAY WELL JUST VERY QUICKLY 'CAUSE THIS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FINISH NOW 
UM I GUESS THAT'S UP TO SEE I MEAN YOU PROBABLY WANT SOME KIND OF UNIQUE SELLING POINT OF IT IS UM YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
RIGHT OKAY WE'LL THAT'S THAT'S THE END OF THE MEETING THEN 
UM 
SO UH 
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING 
UH I'M DAVID AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
UM I JUST GET THE PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT WHAT THE PROJECT IS 
DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT'S ABOUT IT DIDN'T GET ANYTHING ELSE 
DID YOU GET THE SAME THING 
COOL 
THERE'S TOO MUCH AGREE 
OKAY 
CAN'T DRAW 
UM 
YEAH 
UM WELL ANYWAY I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST THE FIRST ANIMAL I CAN THINK OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD 
UM 
YES 
BIG REASON IS 'CAUSE I'M ALLERGIC TO MOST ANIMALS 
ALLERGIC TO ANIMAL FUR SO UM FISH WAS A NATURAL CHOICE 
UM YEAH AND I KIND OF LIKE WHALES 
THEY COME ON AND GO TO EVERYTHING IN SIGHT 
AND THEY'RE QUITE HARMLESS AND MILD AND INTERESTING 
TAIL'S A BIT BIG I THINK 
IT'S AN AFTER DINNER DOG THEN 
HMM 
IT DOES MAKE SENSE FROM MAYBE THE DESIGN POINT OF VIEW 'CAUSE YOU HAVE MORE COMPLICATED CHARACTERS LIKE EUROPEAN LANGUAGES THEN YOU NEED MORE BUTTONS 
SO POSSIBLY 
HMM 
YEAH 
AND YOU KEEP LOSING THEM 
FINDING THEM IS REALLY A PEN YOU KNOW 
I MEAN IT'S USUALLY QUITE SMALL OR WHEN YOU WANT TO RIGHT IT SLIPPED BEHIND THE COUCH OR IT'S KICKED UNDER THE TABLE 
YOU KNOW 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
I THINK ONE FACTOR WOULD BE PRODUCTION COST 
BECAUSE THERE'S A CAP THERE IS UM DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOU CAN CRAM INTO THAT PRICE 
UM 
I THINK THAT THAT'S THE MAIN FACTOR 
COOL 
UM I'M CRAIG AND I'M USER INTERFACE 
YEAH 
WELL MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL WOULD BE A MONKEY 
THEN THEY'RE SMALL CUTE AND FURRY AND UH WHEN PLANET OF THE APES BECOMES REAL I'M GONNA BE UP THERE WITH THEM 
YEAH 
I KNOW UM 
MY PARENTS WENT OUT AND BOUGHT UM REMOTE CONTROLS BECAUSE UM THEY GOT FED UP OF HAVING FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS FOR EACH THINGS THE HOUSE 
SO UM FOR THEM IT WAS JUST HOW MANY DEVICES CONTROL 
MM-HMM 
GREAT 
AND I'M ANDREW AND I'M UH OUR MARKETING 
EXPERT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S IT 
YEAH 
I WILL GO 
THAT'S FINE 
ALRIGHT 
SO 
THIS ONE HERE RIGHT 
OKAY 
VERY NICE 
ALRIGHT 
MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
SO LIKE 
A BEAGLE 
UM CHARAC FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF IT 
SO THAT RIGHT 
OH RIGHT WELL BASICALLY UM HIGH PRIORITY FOR ANY ANIMAL FOR ME IS THAT THEY BE WILLING TO TAKE A LOT OF PHYSICAL AFFECTION FROM THEIR FAMILY 
AND YEAH THAT THEY HAVE LOTS OF PERSONALITY AND UH BE FIT AND IN ROBUST GOOD HEALTH 
SO THIS IS BLUE 
BLUE BEAGLE 
MY FAMILY'S BEAGLE 
I COULDA TOLD YOU A WHOLE LOT MORE ABOUT BEAGLES 
BOY LET ME TELL YOU 
IMPRESSIONIST 
ALRIGHT 
MM 
SUPERB SKETCH BY THE WAY 
YEP 
I SEE A DOG IN THERE 
YEP 
NOW I SEE A ROOSTER 
WHAT KIND IS IT 
SO UH WERE THAT THE IT'S HIS OWN CHA TAIL HE'S CHASING 
HMM 
PROBABLY WHEN HE WAS LITTLE UH GOT LOTS OF ATTENTION FOR DOING IT AND HAS FOREVER BEEN CONDITIONED 
'KAY 
UM CAN WE JUST GO OVER THAT AGAIN 
UH SO BAS AT TWEL ALRIGHT YEAH 
OKAY 
SO COST LIKE PRODUCTION COST US TWELVE FIFTY ABOUT SELLING PRICE IS IS THAT WHOLESALE OR RETAIL 
LIKE IN THE SHELF 
OUR SALE OUR SALE ANYWAY 
YEAH OKAY OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
YES 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL RIGHT AWAY I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S UM THE THE UH LIKE WITH D. V. D. PLAYERS IF THERE ARE ZONES 
UM F FREQUENCIES OR SOMETHING UM AS WELL SO UH CHARACTERS UM DIFFERENT UH KEYPAD STYLES AND S SYMBOLS 
UM 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THEN A AND THEN L THE OTHER THING INTERNATIONAL SO ON TOP OF THE PRICE 
I'M THINKING 
THE PRICE MIGHT MIGHT APPEAL TO A CERTAIN MARKET IN ONE REGION WHEREAS IN ANOTHER IT'LL BE DIFFERENT SO 
JUST A CHARA JUST A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE 
JUST 
OR JUST LIKE BASIC PRODUCT PODI POSITIONING THE TWENTY FIVE EURO REMOTE CONTROL MIGHT BE A BIG HIT IN LONDON 
MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A BIG HIT IN GREECE WHO KNOWS SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH 
YEP 
RIGHT AWAY I'M MAKING SOME KIND OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT WHAT INFORMATION WE'RE GIVEN HER THINKING 
'KAY TRENDY PROBABLY MEANS SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUST BASIC SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUST STANDARD 
UM 
SO I'M WONDERING RIGHT AWAY IS SELLING TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS THAT SORT OF THE THE USE THIS GONNA TO BE LIKE THE PREMIUM PRODUCT KINDA THING OR 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
YEAH I'D SAY SO YEAH 
NO 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON LIKE HOW THAT COMPARES TO THREE 
THERE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH INTERESTING THING ABOUT DISCUSSING UM PRODUCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL FOR ME IS THAT L AS YOU PAINT IT 
I JUST DON'T THINK OF REMOTE CONTROLS AS SOMETHIN SOMETHING PEOPLE CONSCIOUSLY ASSESS IN THEIR PURCHASING HABITS 
IT'S JUST LIKE GETTING SHOELACES WITH SHOES OR SOMETHING 
IT JUST COMES ALONG 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
LIKE IS SORT OF LIKE HOW DO YOU I I MEAN NO NO WAY OF LOOKING AT IT WOULD BE 
WELL THE PEOPLE PRODUCING TELEVISION SETS MAYBE THEY HAVE TO BUY REMOTE CONTROLS 
OR ANOTHER WAY SO MAYBE PEOPLE WHO HAVE T. V. SETS ARE REALLY FED UP WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AND THEY REALLY WANT A BETTER ONE OR SOMETHING 
BUT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY SO 
RIGHT SO NO FUNCTION ONE OF THE PRIORITIES MIGHT BE TO COMBINE AS MANY USES 
I THINK SO 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL LIKE UM MAYBE WHAT WE COULD USE AS A SORT OF LIKE A EXAMPLE OF A SUCCESSFUL OTHER PIECE TECHNOLOGY IS PALM PALM PILOTS 
THEY'RE GONE FROM BEING JUST LIKE LITTLE SORT OF SCRIBBLE BOARDS TO CAMERAS M. P. THREE PLAYERS TELEPHONES 
EVERYTHING AGENDA 
SO LIKE I WONDER IF WE MIGHT ADD SOMETHING NEW TO THE AT THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET SUCH AS THE LIGHTING IN YOUR HOUSE OR UM 
YEAH YEAH 
NO 
YEAH 
LIKE P PERSONALLY FOR ME AT HOME I'VE I'VE COMBINED THE UM THE AUDIO VIDEO OF MY TELEVISION SET AND MY D. V. D. PLAYER AND MY C. D. PLAYER 
SO THEY WE ALL WORK ACTUALLY FUNCTION TOGETHER BUT I HAVE DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS FOR EACH OF THEM 
SO IT'S SORT OF IRONIC THAT THAT THEN THEY'RE IN THERE 
UM 
YOU KNOW THE SOUND AND EVERYTHING IT'S JUST ONE SYSTEM 
BUT EACH ONE'S GOT ITS OWN LITTLE 
PART 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S JUST REALLY GOOD IDEA 
YEP 
OH SURE 
I REMEMBER WHEN THE FIRST REMOTE CONTROL MY MY FAMILY HAD WAS IN A CABLE 
ACTUALLY HAD A CABLE BETWEEN IT AND THE T. V. AND BIG LIKE BUTTONS THAT SORT OF LIKE LIKE IN A BLENDER OR SOMETHING 
AND UM YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE NOW IT'S BETTER BUT ACTUALLY IT'S STILL KIND OF 
I DUNNO LIKE A MASSIVE JUNKY THING IN THE TABLE 
MAYBE WE COULD THINK ABOUT HOW COULD BE MORE YOU KNOW STREAMLINED 
SO 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH 
OR WHATEVER WOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY REASONABLE 
'CAUSE IT COULD BE IT COULD IT COULD BE THAT IF IT COULD BE THAT FUNCTIONALLY THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY BETTER 
BUT THAT JUST THE PEOPLE IF IF NOT HAVING YOU KNOW 
THESE DAYS THERE'S A R PE THINGS IN PEOPLE'S HOMES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE LIKE CHIC YOU KNOW 
UM NICER MATERIALS AND MIGHT BE 
BE WORTH EXPLORING ANYWAY 
OKAY 
UM 
BEFORE WE WRAP UP JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME PAGE HERE UM 
DO WE WE WERE GIVEN SORT OF AN EXAMPLE OF A COFFEE MACHINE OR SOMETHING RIGHT 
WELL 
UM 
OR W IT UM RIGHT NOW ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ARE TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL MAY HAVE FEATURES WHICH GO BEYOND THE TELEVISION 
OR ARE WE KEEPING SORT OF LIKE A A DESIGN COMMITMENT TO TELEVISION FEATURES 
I I DON'T KNOW 
YEP 
YEAH SURE 
OKAY 
OKAY YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
SO THAT ALRIGHT NOW 
OKAY 
SORRY 
OKAY EVERYBODY ALL SET TO START THE MEETING 
OKAY WE'VE GOT HALF AN HOUR FOR THIS ONE UM TO UH DISCUSS THE UM FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 
ALL READY TO GO 
OKAY 
UM SO HOPEFULLY YOU'VE ALL BEEN WORKING AWAY AND I'VE PUT THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING IN THE PROJECT FOLDER 
UM SO I GUESS JUST TO TO RECAP ON UH WHAT WE DID LAST TIME 
UM KIND OF UH GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT AND HE GOT FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE EQUIPMENT AND STARTED TO DISCUSS UM A BIT ABOUT THE PROJECT 
YOU KNOW COST WISE HOW MUCH HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAD TO USE 
UM JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE THREE NEW REQUIREMENTS 
UM WHICH IS THE THE FIRST ONE IS THAT UM UH THE COMPANY'S DECIDED THAT TELETEXT IS OUTDATED UH BECAUSE OF HOW POPULAR THE INTERNET SO 
NOBODY USES TELETEXT VERY MUCH ANYMORE SO WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO CONSIDER THAT IN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM THEY'VE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT WE UM WE ONLY USE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO CONTROL THE TELEVISION INTO THE V. C. R. D. V. D. OR ANYTHING ELSE 
I THINK THE WORRY IS THAT IF THE PROJECT BECOMES TOO COMPLEX THEN IT'LL AFFECT UM HOW LONG IT TAKES US TO GET IT INTO INTO PRODUCTION 
THE TIME TO MARKET 
SO UM WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP IT SIMPLE AND IT'LL JUST CONTROL THE T. V. 
AND THE OTHER THING WAS THAT THE COMPANY WANT THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEW DESIGN 
UM I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THE CORPORATE COLOUR SO 
IT MIGHT BE YELLOW BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF YELLOW EVERYWHERE 
WELL THAT'S THE THING I'M I'M NOT SURE UM 
UH THE BECAUSE IN THE THE COMPANY WEBSITE UH WHAT DOES IT EASY 
UH SOMETHING 
YEAH I MEAN DO THEY USE THAT SOMETHING THEY WANT ACTUALLY WRITTEN ON IT 'CAUSE IT'S QUITE LONG 
UM OR YEAH JUST THE IDEA BUT I'M NOT SURE 
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DISCUSS AS WELL 
SO THESE ARE THE OTHER THINGS JUST NOT TO WORRY ABOUT TELETEXT UH ONLY CONTROL THE T. V. 
AND UM AND UH INCORPORATE THE UH COLOUR AND SLOGAN OF THE COMPANY 
UM SO SO EVERYBODY OKAY WITH ANY OF THAT OR DO YOU WANT ME TO RECAP AT ALL 
RIGHT UM TIME FOR PRESENTATIONS THEN 
WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST 
OKAY COOL 
OH YEAH OF COURSE YEAH 
G GO ON AHEAD 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
UP 
UM 
WELL WE CAN CHAT AWAY FOR UH FOUR FIVE MINUTES OR SO I THINK IT IT MUST 
JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES ANYWAY 
MM-HMM 
SHALL WE SH WELL WE'LL STICK TO KIND OF YOUR OR FOR NOW 
YEAH 
LOOKS KIND OF YEAH 
WELL I THINK IT'S A VALID POINT 
I MEAN LIKE THE IN IN THE LEFT LOOKS QUITE UM QUITE COMPLICATED AND THAT P. R. T. P P. R. E. T. THING IS INCREDIBLY CONFUSING 
UM SO I SEE I SEE WHY YOU YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT PREFER THE SIMPLER DESIGN BUT YEAH YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT IN 
YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES SO MAYBE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU GOT A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE YOU KIND OF FLIP THE THING OPEN 
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
UH-HUH AND THEN ACTUAL NUMBERS FOR CHANNELS AS WELL YEAH 
GOOD I W I WOULD SAY THAT'S REQUIRED 
I MEAN THERE'S NO WAY ANYBODY'S GONNA BUY A REMOTE CONTROL THESE DAYS WHEN IF YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY INDIVIDUALLY SELECT CHANNELS I MEAN WOULD ANYBODY DISAGREE WITH THAT 
UM WHAT ELSE UH SO DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT TELETEXT DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT V. C. R. 
UH ANY KIND OF LIKE DISPLAY CONTROLS AT ALL DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW LIKE BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST 
MM 
YEAH 
I THINK ARE YOU ARE YOU MAYBE KIND OF THINKING WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE AND WHAT WOULD BE NICE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY RIGHT 
WELL DO YOU WANNA MAYBE JUST TO THIS POINT DECIDE ON WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE AS A P AS A FUNCTION OF THIS 
UM SO SO FAR JUST TO RECAP YOU'VE GOT VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL AND 
RIGHT OKAY 
UM 
MM-HMM YEAH 
OK 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UH WELL JUST TO TO WRAP UP QUICKLY ON THIS THIS LITTLE SECTION HAVE I JUST LOST UH NO 
UM UH DO YOU THINK MAYBE THAT'S THE ONLY KIND OF UH ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS 
AND THEN MAYBE JUST THINGS THAT WOULD BE NICE IF IT COULD DO WOULD BE THINGS LIKE AUDIO SET UP AND DISPLAY SET UP AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
MAYBE LIKE A MUTE BUTTON THAT SORT OF THING 
ANY OF YOU ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT AT ALL 
NO 
OKAY RIGHT 
UM OKAY IF WE CAN MOVE ON IT NEXT PRESENTATION THEN PLEASE 
UM 
DO YOU WANNA 
PROBABLY NOT ACTUALLY 
YEAH 
BUT COMPLICATED 
IT'D BE NICE IF EVERYTHING WAS WIRELESS WOULDN'T IT 
RIGHT 
UH LIKE OVERLAP BETWEEN WHAT YOU SAID 
UH WELL FOR ALL YOU KNOW THAT THAT'LL HAPPEN 
MM HARD TO KNOW WHAT WHERE YOUR ROLE ENDS YEAH 
OKAY 
UH PR YEAH PRESS FUNCTION AND F. EIGHT YEAH 
MM 
YEAH YOU WANNA 
UH UH HERE WE GO 
THERE YOU GO 
UM 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
CAN YOU UM 
RIGHT OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD AND SO EASY TO USE BIG PRIORITIES 
OKAY 
MM 
SO IT YOU WANNA GROUP ALL THE DIFFERENT KIND OF TYPES OF FUNCTIONS TOGETHER YOU KNOW 
THAT'S I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
WELL UM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON BY THE END OF THE MEETING SO WHO WE'RE GONNA BE UM WHO'S OUR OUR TARGET AUDIENCE 
OUR TARGET MARKET 
UM SO IF WE WANT SOMETHING THAT THAT LOOKS GOOD AND SO EASY TO USE 
BUT HAS Y IS FAIRLY POWERFUL PRODUCT WHATEVER WHO DO WE REALLY WANT TO ME THAT IT 
I MEAN 
YEAH WHO WOU WHO WOULD HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND 
WELL I IF IF LIKE TWENTY FIVE OR S OR IS OUR SELLING PRICE THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE 
WELL I DON'T I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW MUCH THAT WILL RETAIL AT 
BUT YOU WANT IT'S SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT GONNA JUST USE THE REMOTE THAT COMES WITH THEIR TELLY I SUPPOSE THEY'RE GONNA ACTUALLY GO OUT AND BUY ONE 
SO WHO DO YOU THINK WE'RE AIMING THIS IT 
IT'S ABOUT SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN POUNDS I THINK 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH SO DO YOU THINK WE'RE WE'RE AIMING AT A FAIRLY YOUNG MARKET THEN 
YEAH OKAY 
UM DO YOU THINK THEN UH VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD REALLY SERIOUSLY CONSIDER 
WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK CRAIG 
NO YEAH 
I THINK WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO NARROW IT DOWN TO SAY LET'S TARGET THESE PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT AND 'CAUSE YOU KNOW 
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME KIND OF SELLING POINT TO IT 
SO UM ANYBODY ANYTHING OTHER TO ADD JUST KIND OF YOUNG PROFESSIONALS 
UH THE LIKE IF WE ARE GOING TO INCLUDE SPEECH RECOGNITION IT'S KIND OF BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND THIRTY FIVE SEEMS TO BE LIKE A REALLY HIGH RESPONSE TO THAT 
SO WE COULD SAY THAT WAS OUR TARGET 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE LOOK FAIRLY YOUNG 
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE BIT OF EXPENDABLE INCOME TO SPEND ON THIS SORT OF THING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THEY'LL NOT SH NOT SHY AWAY FROM SOMETHING QUITE HIGH TECH 
THAT THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
UM OKAY SO UM SO SHALL WE MAKE THE DECISION UH TO INCLUDE SPEECH RECOGNITION IF WE CAN 
OKAY 
WHY IS THAT 
OKAY 
WHERE YOU CAN ACTIVATE IT AND DEACTIVATE IT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
OH OKAY 
WELL DO YOU WANNA UM GIVE US YOUR PRESENTATION AND THEN THEN WE CAN I DON'T KNOW M MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA TO ALL DELIVER OUR PRESENTATIONS AND THEN DISCUSS 
BUT THIS IS THIS IS HOW WE'RE YEAH EXACTLY YEAH 
UH IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S JUST OCCURRED TO ME AS WELL SO IF WE MAKE IT UM SPEECH RECO IF WE INCORPORATE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
THAT'S APPEALING TO PEOPLE UM MAYBE WITH A PHYSICAL DISABILITY AS WELL 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
REALLY 
DO YOU THINK MAYBE WE NEED LIKE FURTHER ADVANCES IN THAT KIND OF OUR INITIAL IT'S WORTHWHILE INCORPORATING IT THOUGH 
MM

OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL WELL A WORRY THAT WAS WAS EXPRESSED IN THE NEW REQUIREMENTS WAS THAT IF WE MADE THIS TOO COMPLEX IT WOULD E IT WOULD EFFECT UM HOW LONG HOW LONG TO TAKE US TO GET THIS TO MARKET 
SO I TH SUSPECT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA JUST TO RESTRICT OUR KIND OF OUR CREATIVE INFLUENCE ON THIS IN THE USER INTERFACE AND NOT WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT UH HOW WE TRANSMIT TO UM BECAUSE I MEAN IT IT'S TRIED AND TESTED INTRA RED 
SO WE COULD STAY WITH THE 
MM-HMM 
OH YEAH 
YEAH MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WE 
YEAH 
W WELL WELL WE'VE UM IN THE NEW REQUIREMENT SPEC THEY SAID JUST TO FOCUS ON THE T. V. SO THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO FOR NOW I THINK 
SOMETHING I WAS WONDERING ABOUT WAS THE POWER 
UM SO IT WORTH CONSIDERING LIKE HAVING LIKE A CHARGING UNIT AS OPPOSED TO JUST REGULAR BATTERIES 
I MEAN IS THAT SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT TO GO INTO DO YOU THINK OR SHOULD WE JUST CONSIDER RUNNING ON REGULAR BATTERIES 
UH-HUH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY SO

OKAY SO JUST STICK TO TO REGULAR 
OKAY 
UM RIGHT 
SO BASICALLY THE UM I'M JUST GONNA JUST RECAP UH WHAT I USED TO THE START 
WAS THAT UM THE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MEETING WAS IT F ABSOLUTELY FINALISE WHO WE'RE GONNA UM THIS OUT AND WHAT EXACTLY THE PRODUCT'S GONNA DO 
SO UM JUST TO RECAP ON OR WE ALL HAPPY ABOUT THE IDEA OF UM AMONG THE PRODUCT TO UM THE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE BRACKET 
UM AND ALSO THE FUNCT THE THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONS OF WHAT IT'S GONNA DO 
DO YOU WANNA RECAP ON THAT CRAIG 
OKAY RIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH IT'S AS OPTIONAL FUNCTIONS 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY RIGHT 
UM OKAY WELL I GOTTA KIND OF GOT FIVE MINUTES TO WRAP UP NOW 
UM NEXT THING WE'RE DOING IS HAVING LUNCH 
WHOOHOO 
UM AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIRTY MINUTES OF WORKING ON THE NEXT STAGE 
UM SO I'LL BE PUTTING THE MINUTES OF THIS UH THIS MEETING INTO THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER 
UM SO UH I GUESS JUST TO JUST TO CONFIRM THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE NEXT WELL IN THE THIRTY MINUTES AFTER LUNCH ANYWAY 
UM FOR UH OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER YOU'RE GONNA BE THINKING ABOUT THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT 
UM USER INTERFACE DESIGNER GONNA BE THINKING ABOUT OUR USER INTERFACE AND MARKETING YOU'RE GONNA BE THINKING ABOUT TREND WATCHING 
UM AND YOU'LL ALL GET SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS AS WELL 
SO UM I DUNNO JUST JUST TO TO ASK NOW IF YOU'VE GOT ANYTHING ELSE YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT WHILE WE'VE BEEN TALKING 
UM DO YOU WANNA START WITH DAVID 
ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY AT ALL 
NO OKAY 
ANDREW 
YEAH YEAH I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY A GOOD IDEA 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE UM DO WHICH IS GONNA BE LIKE YOU KNOW YOUR BASS SETTINGS AND ACTUAL VOLUME UH OKAY 
OKAY AND THEN VISUAL 
OKAY SO BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN JUST ACTUAL DEVICE THINGS 
LIKE WHAT CHANNEL YOU'RE WATCHING TURNING ON ON OFF STUFF LIKE THAT 
OKAY UM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM SO YEAH I GUESS JUST THINGS TO THINK ABOUT ARE YOU KNOW LIKE THE FACT IT'S GOTTA LOOK GOOD 
BECAUSE OF WHO WE'RE WE'RE YOU KNOW TARGETING THIS IT 
UM SOMETHING MAYBE KIND OF QUIRKY IN DESIGN MAYBE 
MAKE IT KIND OF ERGONOMIC KIND OF TO HOLD YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT 
UM SO I GUESS I GUESS THAT'S IT 
THAT'S THE MEETING OVER 
WHOOHOO 
MM YEAH 
NOPE WE'RE ALL SET 
WHICH WHICH IS THE CLUNKY IN THE ONE ONE LEFT OR IN THE RIGHT 
OKAY 
NO 
I'LL ADD IT LATER I GUESS THE PRESENTATION 
NO 
NO 
UM FUNCTION F. EIGHT 
FUNCTION THE BLUE BUTTON 
NEXT TO THE CONTROL IN THE LEFT 
YEAH 
YOU HAVE TO PUSH IT TOGETHER 
NOPE 
TRY THAT AGAIN 
WAIT 
YEP THERE WE GO 
INCREASE THAT 'CAUSE WE CAN'T USE THE 
THAT'S MUCH BETTER 
THERE YOU GO 
BOUNCING ON TOP 
IS INSTALLING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE 
UM I THINK IT'LL BE THE MID RANGE TO THE HIGH END MARKET IN TERMS OF PEOPLE 
'CAUSE TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR A REMOTE HOW MUCH IS THAT LO LOCALLY IN POUNDS 
SO THAT IT IS THAT A LOT OF MONEY TO BUY AN EXTRA REMOTE OR A REPLACEMENT REMOTE 
RIGHT 
UM SO MAYBE NOT THE HIGH END RANGE BUT MAYBE MIDDL MIDDLE UP ISH 
KIND OF 
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH 
I DUNNO I GUESS YOU PAY WHAT TEN TEN QUID FOR A REMOTE 
LIKE A SIMPLE REPLACEMENT RIGHT 
I MEAN IF YOU LOST YOUR REMOTE AND THE FIRST THING YOU JUST WANNA GO OUT AND GET WOULD YOU HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY 
YEAH 
YEP 
I I THINK TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE IS IS IS FREE TO ADD THAT ONE IS A GROUP AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S MORE THAN HALF YOUR GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO AT LEAST TRY AND USE YOUR TECHNOLOGY 
YEAH 
I THINK PERHAPS THAT AGE GROUP IS SIGNIFICANT AS WELL BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO IS THE COMPUTER 
WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR WITH COMPUTERS IN IN THEIR EVERYDAY WORK 
I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE MAYBE BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THIRTY FIVE 
BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT FORTY ISH AND ABOVE NOW WOULD NOT BE SO DEPENDENT AND RELIANT ON A COMPUTER OR A MOBILE PHONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GADGETY RIGHT 
PEOPLE WHO ARE U GROWING UP USED TO YOU KNOW IN SCHOOLS AND IN UNIVERSITIES 
WHEN YOU GO ON IT THERE WORKING LIVES PEOPLE WHO WOULD YOU KNOW REGULAR YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
I I THINK ONE THING WE SHOULD TRY NOT TO AVOID IS NOT TO SAY WE HAVE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION RIGHT NOW 
BECAUSE UM BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE G Y EVERYBODY'S SAYING RIGHT YOU WANT SOMETHING SIMPLE 
YOU WANT BASIC STUFF AND YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S EASY TO USE 
SPEECH RECOGNITION MIGHT NOT BE THE SIMPLEST THING FOR SOMEBODY TO USE 
UM BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO LOCK OURSELVES INTO A S PARTICULAR KIND OF TECHNOLOGY 
RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON ON EXACTLY WHAT ARE THE FEATURES THAT WE'RE GONNA SAY AND THEN 
YOU KNOW SAY SPEECH RECOGNITION IS GOOD FOR THIS SPEECH RECOGNITION IS NOT GOOD FOR THIS 
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD I SUGGEST THAT WE THINK ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION ANYWAY IT'S A IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE USED TO FULFIL A FUNCTION 
BUT IT AND OF THE DAY WE DON'T LOOK AT THE TECHNOLOGY BUT WE LOOK AT THE FUNCTION FIRST 
OKAY SURE 
SORRY DO YOU MIND PASSING ME MY NOTEPAD 
THANKS 
COOL UM 
OKAY 
UM 
WELL THIS IS JUST THE WORKING DESIGN UM 
WELL THIS IS JUST WHAT HOW I WOULD GO ABOUT IT 
UM I GUESS I TRY TO DEFINE LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW TRY TO DEFINE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET DONE 
UM I THINK IN A PRACTICAL WAY WE KIND OF KNOW WHAT IT IS 
WE'VE USED TO WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT BUT WE'RE WE CAN'T N WE HAVEN'T NARROWED DOWN UM EXACTLY WHAT THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO FULFIL 
LIKE BESIDES THE BASICS I THINK BACK IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS WE KNOW WHAT THE BASICS ARE 
HAS TO CHANGE CHANNELS HAS TO CHANGE VOLUME BUT IN LIKE SPECIFICS RIGHT WHICH ONE OF THE BASICS ARE YOU TRYING TO TARGET 
UM ARE THERE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BASICS THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT OR LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE BASICS 
UM AND I JUST THE IDEA IS JUST TO GET EVERYBODY TO UM I USUALLY HAVE A HAVE HAVE A DESIGN THAT'S THERE IS A BASIC 
SO YOU KNOW THINGS THAT TO START EVERYTHING GOING 
BUT I GUESS EVERYBODY DOES HAVE SOME IDEA SO I DON'T THINK UM THERE'S A AND FOR THAT 
UM OKAY THIS FINDING THINGS AS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING SO I'LL GO INTO THE DIAGRAM FIRST 
IT JUST EXPLAINS HOW THE PROCESS GOES THROUGH FROM A FROM THE BASIC TECHNOLOGY POINT OF VIEW 
THE BASIC STEPS THAT YOU NEED UM IN THE DIAGRAM AND IN THIS SLIDE PROBABLY WORKS BETTER 
UM OKAY YOU NEED SOME POWER SOURCE 
'KAY A BATTERY OR SOMETHING TO KEEP IT GOING 
UM AND THAT POWER SOURCE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT TIES YOU DOWN TO UM HOW LONG THE DEVICE WILL LOST 
UM IT TIES YOU DOWN PERHAPS A BIT LATER ON IN TERMS OF THE TECHNOLOGIES UM HOW FAR YOU CAN TRANSMIT THE SIGNAL OR THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FUNCTIONS THAT YOU WANT 
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE VOICE RECOGNITION RIGHT 
THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRAINED BECAUSE THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO POWER A MICROPHONE YOU MIGHT NEED TO POWER OTHER THINGS SO THAT'S ONE PERHAPS CONSTRAINT THERE 
UM 
THE KEY THE BASIC THING IS THERE'S A USER INTERFACE WHERE PEOPLE PUNCH A BUTTON OR TALK INTO IT OR SMILE TO IT OR BLINK THEIR EYES WHATEVER 
YOU KNOW AND THAT UM PICKS UP AN INPUT FROM A USER 
UM UH A LOGIC A SERIES OF LOGIC HAS TO DECIDE WHAT THE USER IS TELLING THE DEVICE 
AND THE DEVICE HAS TO OR YOU KNOW BASED ON YOU PUSH BUTTON A. S I WILL DO SOMETHING WITH BUTTON A. 
SO MAYBE BUTTON A. IS THE POWER BUTTON OKAY 
UM AND THEN IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO TO THE DEVICE ITSELF WHICH IS THE RECEIVER HERE 
UM AND I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF MY DESIGN UM 
IT'S FAIRLY GENERAL UM AND I GUESS THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS ALSO NOT TO RESTRICT YOU IN IN THE WAY YOU'RE THINKING LIKE UM VOICE RECOGNITION 
RIGHT UM IF IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS IMPORTANT THAN WE JUST ADD MORE POWER RATHER THAN HAVING A THING THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER 
SO IT'S NOT REALLY A CONSTRAINT ON THAT SENSE BUT I MEAN THESE ARE FUNCTIONALLY YOU KNOW THE BASE WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS TO DO 
UM SO I GUESS THE REST OF IT I THINK WE SHOULD MAYBE YOU YOU WANNA GO BACK TO WHAT THE FUNCTIONS ARE 
I THINK THAT'S MORE RELEVANT TO A DISCUSSION 
YEAH W I'M DONE 
MORE OR LESS 
YEAH 
PS OH IT'S JUST PUTTING THE REST OF IT INTO WORDS BUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING 
UM YOU HAVE A TRANSMITTER AN INPUT DEVICE LOGIC CHIP YOU KNOW STUFF LIKE THAT 
UM 
I GUESS THIS WOULD BE 
YEP 
UM THESE THESE AREN'T TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS ON THAT SENSE 
THIS IS JUST UM A BASIC PRINCIPLES AND BASIC COMPONENTS THAT ARE NEEDED 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU NEEDED UM IF YOU NEEDED TO ADD UH A VOICE RECOGNITION RIGHT 
THEN YOUR USER INTERFACE WOULD BE SPLIT BROKEN DOWN INTO MORE COMPONENTS RIGHT WHICH YOU HAVE A MICROPHONE THE V. R. AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
OH 
YEP 
YEP 
SO EACH COMPONENT REPRESENTS ONE FUNCTION BUT I THINK THE BASIC FUNCTIONS ARE THE LOGIC THE TRANSMITTER 
UM AND THE RECEIVER OKAY AND THE POWER OR THINGS THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT 
UM AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT BASED ON WHAT YOUR USER INTERFACE REQUIRES THEN WE'LL ADD MORE FUNCTIONALITY TO IT 
UM THERE MIGHT BE IN OTHER CONSIDERATION WHICH WOULD BE THAT THE THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE T. V. FOR EXAMPLE 
OKAY UM ARE WE GONNA RESTRICT OURSELVES TO USING THE TRADITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES OF INFRA RED THING 
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY BE PHYSICALLY BE POINTING OUT 
RIGHT 
YEP 
THERE MIGHT BE IN THEIR PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION UM ONE PARTICULAR RIGHT NOW SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VOICE RECOGNITION 
UM IF SOMEBODY'S GONNA UH TALK TO THE DEVICE YOU IDEALLY WANT THEM TO HOLD IT TO THEM 
I IT YOU MAY NOT REQUIRE THAT BUT YOU KNOW UM IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING VERY NATURAL I GUESS 
YOU KNOW TO HOLD IT TO SIGNAL TO THE USER AND PUSH A BUTTON MAYBE TO START S TALKING ABOUT IT 
THEN YOU NEED TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO USE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE USING INFRA RED THE LINE OF SIGHT UM SAY THE T. V. 'S AT THAT CHAIR 
AND I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF HERE AND THE TRANSMITTER IS HERE IT BLOCKS IT 
SO ON THAT SENSE THERE'S NOT REALLY A RESTRICTION BUT IT'S SOMETHING WHICH YOU MAY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT LATER ON ON THE PROCESS 
NOT AS MUCH FURTHER DOWN 
THERE'S THERE'S NOT MUCH SPECIFIC SPECIFIC INFORMATION BUT I THINK THAT UM AN INDICATION OF INFRA RED MEAN THAT YOU'RE JUST TARGETING TRADITIONAL DEVICES 
BECAUSE INFRA RED IS SOMETHING WHICH EVERYBODY HAS 
THERE'S A THERE'S KEY FRAME FROM A FROM A COMPONENT POINT OF VIEW THERE'S ADDED COMPLEXITY 
AND YOU ADD COST TO TO UM AND THEN THERE'S PROBABLY THE FACT THAT YOU NEED ANOTHER PHYSICAL COMPONENT 
YOU NEED A DOCKING CRADLE FOR EXAMPLE FOR YOU TO PUT IT ON TO CHARGE 
OR YOU NEED TO GET THE USER TO PLUG IT IN 
UM AND MOST USERS ARE VERY OF USE ALREADY USED TO THE IDEA OF BUYING BATTERIES AND PUTTING IT INTO THE CONTROLLER 
BUT UNLESS THE CONTROLLER'S GONNA CONSUME A LOT OF BATTERIES LIKE HE'S GONNA RUN THROUGH LIKE TWENTY BATTERIES A MONTH 
THEN I DON'T THINK RECHARGEABLE IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED TO CARE ABOUT 
UM 
OKAY I THINK 
ANOTHER THING THAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT CATEGORISING THE CONTROLS 
UM MAYBE I COULD SUGGEST WE WE BREAK THEM DOWN INTO THREE SIMPLE CATEGORIES 
ONE WOULD BE AUDIO CONTROLS ONE WOULD BE VIDEO CONTROLS AND THE OTHER ONE WOULD BE A DEVICE 
UM THIS MAY NOT MAP VERY WELL IT ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY ESPECIALLY BUT I THINK THAT UM FROM A MANUFACTURER'S POINT OF VIEW FROM A PERSON DESIGNING THE DEVICE 
BUT I THINK FROM A POINT OF VIEW OF A PERSON USING THE DEVICE YOU KNOW A T. V. S SOMETHING THEY USE AND SOMETHING THEY HERE 
UM IT'S SOMETHING THEY DO OTHER THINGS TO LOOK TURN IT ON AND TURN IT OFF 
I MEAN LIKE SO WHAT WE COULD HAVE IS LIKE THREE BUCKETS RIGHT WHERE WE COULD THROW THINGS INTO LIKE IF WE WANT THIS FEATURE 
LET'S THROW IT INTO THERE AND THEN FROM THERE DECIDE WHETHER IT'S BASIC OR IT'S NON BASIC 
I MEAN IT MIGHT HELP WITH THE VISUALISATION 
AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP WITH THE COMPONENT BUILD AS WELL 
MM NO NOT REALLY 
MM 
UM THINGS LIKE ON OFF 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU SEE 
I M MAIN IN TERMS OF PICTURE AND THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE YOU KNOW UM SO UM AND CHANNEL 
BECAUSE THE ON OFF ALSO GOES YOU KNOW LIKE ON OFF LIKE POWER NOT ON OFF SOUND 
NOT ON OFF VIDEO 
ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T TURN OFF THE VIDEO IN YOUR T. V. 
BUT UM YOU MIGHT WANNA YOU KNOW TURN OFF THE SOUND SAY YOU WANNA PICK UP THE PHONE THERE'S A MUTE BUTTON RIGHT 
SO YOU YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF PUTTING IT ON IT UM OTHERS ARE A DEVICE 
DEVICE IS BASICALLY ANYTHING WHICH WE CAN'T CATEGORISE RIGHT 
WE PUT IT IT 
YEAH ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU HEAR RIGHT 
YOU YOU PUT THAT NOT DO 
AND THEN VIDEO IS ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN SEE 
UM 
YEP 
YEP 
YEP 
LIKE RANDOM WHICH WE HAVE ON THEIR PLACE TO PUT BUT WE NEED TO SOMEWHERE THERE 
UM EVEN EVEN IF IT DOESN'T MAP VERY CLEARLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PEOPLE AT LEAST HAVE SOME IN THEIR MIND 
IT'S EASY TO USE 
I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT UM AND I GUESS FROM THE COMPONENT POINT OF VIEW IT'S EASY TO BUILD AS WELL 'CAUSE THINGS ARE LIKE FIXED 
I'LL GO FIRST 
ALRIGHT UM CAN I ST STEAL THIS FROM THE BACK OF YOUR LAPTOP 
OH 
SO THIS IS THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
UM 
RIGHT TO DO THE UM THE DESIGN I HAVE I'VE HAD A LOOK ONLINE 
I'VE HAD A LOOK AT THE HOMEPAGE WHICH HAS GIVEN US UM SOME INSP INSPIRATION FROM PREVIOUS PRODUCTS 
UM I'VE HAD A LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS PRODUCTS TO SEE WHAT THEY OFFER AND UM I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU GUYS FOR ME YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THE DESIGN AT THE END OF THE MEETING 
UM UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK OUTSIDE THE MEETING ROOM SO 
UM HAVING A LOOK AT THE EXISTING PRODUCTS I FOUND OUT THAT UM IT TENDS TO COME IN SORT OF TWO EXTREMES 
THERE'S THERE UM A VERY COMPLICATED ONE THAT'S GOT LOTS OF BUTTONS LOTS OF COLOURS VERY CONFUSING YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
UM IN THAT CASE THE THE LABELLING TENDS TO BE VERY BAD 
UM THERE'S AN EXAMPLE I'LL SHOW YOU TO THE AND UM SH SHOW YOU NOW 
OH 
HERE UM THE BUTTON THERE AND THERE 
THIS ONE'S PROG 
SORRY 
THAT ONE'S PERG AND THAT ONE'S PERG AND IT DOESN'T REALLY TELL YOU WHAT IT DOES 
UM NOT SURE IF YOU HAD A A LOOK AT THE OTHER UM CONTROL IN THAT EXAMPLE 
UM IT'S A VERY SIMPLE ONE 
IT'S GOT ONLY THE BASIC FUNCTIONS MM BUT UM IT'S THE SAME SIZE IS THE THE HARD TO USE ONE 
UH IT LOOKED A BIT CLUNKY 
THEY'RE VERY BIG AND NOT VERY MUCH AS FOR BUTTONS 
UM AND IT'S JUST VERY HARD TO ACCESS THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS 
THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING FOR INSTANCE FOR A SLOW MOTION BUTTON 
UM MY OWN PREFERENCES I PREFER THE THE CLUNKY ONE 
UM IT'S VERY EASY TO USE 
UM BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES LACK THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS WHICH I I QUITE LIKE HAVING IN THE CONTROLS 
UM SO I BELIEVE THE THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS SHOULD MAYBE BE HIDDEN IN A DRAWER OR SOMETHING LIKE THE FROM THE BOTTOM OF IT 
SO NOW I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR YOUR PREFERENCES 
UM NOT SURE OF HOW LONG WE'VE GOT UH 
UM THE CLUNKY ONE IS THE IN IN THE RIGHT 
UM I THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAME SIZE BUT UM IT'S GOT MUCH FEWER BUTTONS 
IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S VERY SPREAD OUT AND KIND OF YOU KNOW I GOT THE IDEA IT'D BE SORT OF ABOUT THIS SIZE 
GET VERY FEW BUTTONS ON IT AND 
UM DO WE HAVE ANY FUNCTIONS THAT UM WE'D WANT ON IT 
I MEAN AS FAR I'VE GOT UM ONE AND OFF UM SWITCH THE CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AND PUT THE VOLUME UP AND DOWN 
UM THEY'RE JUST THE THE VERY BASICS YOU COULD USE FOR A T. V. 
OKAY 
UM YOU SAY THAT'S A UH A REQUIRED ONE OR A REQUESTED ONE 
WOULD YOU LIKE UM THE CHANNELS LIKE THE THE NUMBERS ONE THING UM 
UM YEAH 
UM 
UH TO START WITH UM SORT OF A BIT BOTH 
UM WE NEED TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE UM AND AFTER THAT WE CAN ADD THINGS IF THEY'RE POSSIBLE 
THERE'S UM ONE AND OFF UM VOLUME AND CHANNEL AND SKIP TO CERTAIN CHANNELS WITH THE NUMBERS 
DO YOU WANT TO SWITCH PLACES 
JUST JUST SWITCH THEM 
THINK MAYBE THE THE WERE IN THE BACK MIGHT BE ALSO 
UM 
WELL DID YOU NOT SAY IT WAS THE THE ADULTS THAT WERE GOING FOR THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
SORT OF THE THE OLDER GROUP 
UH F 
YEAH 
I RECKON ONE PROBLEM WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION IS UM I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN ONE OF THEM USED AND UH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS IN THAT ONE WASN'T PARTICULARLY AMAZING 
SO YOU END UP YELLING AT THE CONTROL FOR HOURS 
CHANNEL UP 
UM 
I THINK IT'D PROBABLY QUITE EXPENSIVE TO PUT IN 
UM 
I THINK WE JUST SAY THAT IT WAS GONNA BE THE THE MOST BASIC STUFF POSSIBLE 
UM ON OFF UP AND DOWN CHANNELS UP AND DOWN VOLUME AND UH SKIP IT A CHANNEL 
UM I THINK WE INCLUDE MUTE BUT APART FROM THAT UM I THINK WE JUST WE'LL GO FOR THE SIMPLENESS 
YEAH 
UM JUST ABOUT THE THREE BUCKETS UM WHAT WOULD GO ON THE THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS ON 
COULD YOU PLUG ME ONE 
OKAY 
THANKS 
OKAY 
'KAY 
OKAY 
AND THE SLOGAN LIKE THE ACTUAL WRITTEN SLOGAN OR JUST TO EMBODY THE IDEA OF THE SLOGAN 
'BOUT PUTTING THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
SURE 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
UM YEAH 
LIKE A LOT OF A LOT OF WHAT I'VE UM RED AND PREPARED FOR THIS MEETING FITS IN REALLY CLOSELY WITH WHAT WITH WHAT CRAIG'S JUST GONE OVER 
SO ONE PART I COULD I COULD GIVE YOU SOME OF MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES BUT I COULD ALSO THE DID SEEM TO THIS WHICH IS JUST ABOUT SORT OF UM SORT OF MARKET RESEARCH 
BUT ANYWAY UM WE MIGHT COME TO THAT LATER 
UM CLUNKY ONE WHAT SENSE LIKE UM H HEAVIER 
LARGER 
I SEE SO IT'S MORE JUST BASIC 
RIGHT OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SURE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WHICH WAS THAT 
UP THE NUMBERS ARE THE UP DOWN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE DON'T 
NO 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK I THINK SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW SO WE'RE CATEGORISING 
WE'RE SAYING WELL WE WANT THIS TO BE A PRODUCT THAT OFFERS ALL THE SORT OF MORE TRICKY FEATURES BUT WE WANT THEM TO BE IN ANOTHER OR 
SO THAT RIGHT 
SO THAT WHAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING 
WE'RE KIND OF LIKE SORTING THEM IN OR ARE WE ACTUALLY ELIMINATING THINGS WE JUST DON'T WANT THE PRODUCT TO HAVE 
YEAH 
YEP 
WELL NO NO WAY I WOULD LOOK AT THIS UM WOULD BE THAT WE A APPROACH THE DIFFERENT CONTROLS IN TERMS OF UM LIKE CONTROL TYPES 
SO THAT FOR THE USER IT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WHERE THEY GO 
UH AND ALSO THINK MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SORTA W W WHAT WOULD JUST WANNA BE ACC EASILY ACCESSIBLE 
FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAD AUDIO CONTROLS THESE COULD BE SOMETHING PEOPLE SET UP VERY RARELY 
MAYBE THEY'RE UN THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE IN A LITTLE OR BUT COVERED UP UM THINGS LIKE CHANNEL AND VOLUME UM ARE USED ALL THE TIME 
SO WE JUST HAVE THEM RIGHT IT ON TOP UM VERY JUST VERY SORT OF SELF EXPLANATORY 
UM SO MAYBE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HAVING THERE ARE MORE GROUPINGS OF CONTROLS 
YOU KNOW LIKE IN WHICH ARE JUST THE THE HABITUAL ONES THAT SHOULD BE RIGHT WITHIN YOUR NATURAL GRIP 
AND OTHERS THAT ARE UH ALSO AVAILABLE AND THEN OTHERS THAT ARE CONCEALED 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SURE 
CAN THIS CAN THIS PL REACH 
CAN THIS PLUG COME ACROSS 
NO 
SO WHY DON'T I JUST PICK UP AND MOVE THEN 
HERE I'LL JUST 
WHY DON'T I JUST 
MM ER CAN YOU GO UP BEHIND ME 
KINDA THIS IS IS THIS I'M ALL IN A KNOT NOW 
OKAY 
UM 
SO I CAN I CAN SAY ALREADY 
I DUNNO WHETHER THIS IS FOR GOOD OR FOR BAD BUT THERE'LL BE A LOT OF KIND OF UH REDUNDANCY IN THE ON THE THE ISSUES AND THE THE UH THE THINGS 
YEAH YEAH 
WHICH IS UM NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING 
BUT MY WHAT I'VE ALREADY STARTED DOING IS CR I CREATED A SLIDE IN IN MY PRESENTATION HERE IS UM SO THAT WE KIND OF THINK WELL WHAT'S THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF WHAT WE'VE TAKEN FROM YOUR IDEAS AND AND MINE 
BECAUSE CERTAINLY I I HAVE A HARD TIME SEPARATING SEPARATING THINGS COMPLETELY 
OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY WHAT YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME WHAT YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME IMPACTS A LOT ON WHAT UM LIKE MARKET RESEARCH MM THAT THAT I'VE BEEN SO HOW DO I HOW DO I GOT THIS UP 
OKAY 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
SO 
F. EIGHT 
UH AND F. EIGHT 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY I THINK THAT THAT'S DOING IT NOW 
UH AGAIN 
OKAY 
UM OKAY GREAT 
OKAY 
JUST UM BEFORE I BRING THIS UP WHAT I'LL JUST SAY SO UM WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE DONE IS TRIED TO COLLECT SOME INFORMATION IS THAT I CAN THEN RELAY THIS TO TO YOU GUYS SO THAT IT'S NOW BECOMES A COLLECTIVE THING 
AND THEN KIND OF LEAD US IN THE DIRECTION OF DECIDING 'KAY WHAT WHAT OUR OUR OPTIONS 
WHAT SHOULD WE DECIDE AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
THAT WOULD BE 
OKAY 
SO UM DOES THAT MAKE SENSE 
SO WHAT I BASICALLY GOT SO I JUST LOOKED INTO SOME INFORMATION AND SORT OF THE TRIED TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW WE COULD REVIEW IT AND HOW WE COULD AND WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS WE COULD TAKE AWAY FROM IT AND THEN MAYBE BY THE END OF JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE THINGS WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT OUR OUR PRIORITIES 
'CAUSE CERTAINLY THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT INFORMATION TO GO THROUGH 
SO UM I'M THINKING HERE BUT UH PRIMARILY ABOUT CUSTOMER NEEDS THAT WE START WITH THE CUSTOMER 
AND W YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT AND WHAT ARE ISSUES WITH WITH UM EXISTING PRODUCTS 
UH TO THINK ABOUT TRENDS AND ALSO ABOUT TRY AND CONNECT THAT AS YOU USE WITH THE COMPANY VISION WHICH IS ABOUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
UM AND THEN AS I SAY UH WE WE'D LIKE TO PRIORITISE OUR DESIGN FEATURES FROM THIS AND UM 
DUNNO 
OKAY 
UM 
SO THIS IS WHAT I'VE FOUND HERE UM A LOT OF THIS IS NOW TO UM SO WE'LL JUST READ THROUGH TOGETHER 
UM USERS DISLIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO THEY FIND THEM UGLY 
MOST PEOPLE FIND THEM UGLY 
UM THE VAST MAJORITY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY FOR IT TO LOOK FANCY AS WELL WE'LL SEE LATER 
THE VAST MAJORITY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY FOR ME SLIGHTLY MORE INTUITIVE CONTROL SUCH AS VOICE RECOGNITION 
OKAY I'M GONNA WE'LL LOOK AT THAT IN A SECOND 
UM MOST PEOPLE USE ONLY A OF A VERY SLIM PORTION OF ALL THE CONTROLS 
SO I GUESS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS PEOPLE WANT THIS UH TECHNOLOGY 
THEY TEND TO USE THE MOST SIMPLE CONTROLS AND OVERALL THEY FIND REMOTE CONTROLS TO BE SOMETHING THEY DON'T DOESN'T REALLY APPEAL TO THEM 
SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING SO WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE LIKE F FOR ME THIS IS SORTA LIKE THREE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM INSPIRATIONS 
YOU KNOW ONE IS THAT WE WANT UH SOMETHING THAT'S HIGH TECH BUT WE WANT TO TO SOME SAY 
AND IN SPITE OF THE PRIMITIVE SIDE OF IT AND THE VERY HIGH TECH SIDE WE WANT TO TO JUST BE AN APPEALING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN PEOPLE'S HANDS 
UM FRUSTRATIONS 
THEY GET LOST A LOT SO SO IT CAME UP IN OUR LAST MEETING 
UM TAKES TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE THEM 
THIS IS UH WHY I MENTION WHEN CRAIG WAS UH SHOWING US SOME IDEAS THAT WE ACTUALLY TRY AND GROUP CONTROLS 
SO DO IT DOESN'T JUST LIKE LIKE A BIG PANEL KINDA LIKE WHEN YOU YOU LOOK AT 
YOU KNOW A NEW COMPUTER KEYBOARD OR SOMETHING THAT IS QUITE EXPLANATORY 
IF YOU WANT DO IF YOU WANT VISUAL THEN YOU HAVE THIS 
UM 
AND I WILL ADMIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT R. S. I. STANDS FOR 
UH IN THAT DID NOT COME UP AT ALL 
UM SO HERE HERE IS ANOTHER UM SORT OF A A REVIEW HERE OF THE MAIN THINGS 
I ALSO FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD UH ADULTS AT LEAST WOULD PAY MORE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION 
NOW APPARENTLY WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE TECH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY IN REMOTE CONTROL 
SO I DUNNO IF THAT'S POSSIBLE WE MIGHT CONSIDER GETTING INTO IT 
UM 
AND AND AGAIN HERE SO WE SORT OF MOVE M SORT OF THEN START THINKING ABOUT HOW WE WANNA SELL AND MARKET THIS 
I THINK A RECURRING THEME HERE IS THE COMPANY WANTS TO TO BE WANTS US TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S FASHIONABLE AND SLEEK AND TRENDY 
UM PEOPLE UH ADDITIONALLY AREN'T AREN'T LIKING THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR PRODUCTS 
SO WE WANNA THINK ABOUT SO WE TAKE ALL THE SORT OF THE TECHIE FEATURES HOW WE CAN UM PUT THAT INTO A NOTE WHICH IS WHICH PEOPLE LIKE 
YOU KNOW THEY LIKE THE AESTHETICS AND THE ERGONOMICS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO YOU KNOW JUST C LOOKING AT WHAT WHAT CRAIG UM CRAIG'S I UH IDEAS OR IS SORTA TELL ME THAT MAYBE WHAT WE WANNA DO IS TRY AND UM SEPARATE THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE WANNA INCLUDE IN THIS 
SO IF WE DO SAY WELL WE WANT THERE TO BE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WILL WE TRY AND MAKE THAT ALMOST BE LIKE OPTIONAL TECHNOLOGY 
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE LIKE I FIND A LOT OF T. V. S THESE DAYS 
SOMETHING REALLY LIKE BUT I'M SO IF YOU WANNA JUST TURN 'EM ON AND OFF YOU CAN 
BUT THEY HAVE LITTLE PANELS WHERE YOU CLICK AND THERE'S JUST LIKE TONS OF FEATURES YOU GO THROUGH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S SO THAT'S SORT OF THE UM BUT I I'M MY HOPE HERE IS THAT I'M PUTTING IT THIS INFORMATION IS THAT WE CAN THEN SAY OKAY 
WELL HOW DO WE COLLECTIVELY MOVE ON WITH IT 
UM I I HAVEN'T BROUGHT IT IN SPECIFIC MARKETING IDEA 
ALTHOUGH MY SENSE IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD TRY AND THINK ABOUT IS WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS IN MATERIALS AND SHAPES AND STYLES AND THEN IS THAT 
BUT NOT LET THAT CONFINE US TECHNOLOGICALLY 
SO 
ALRIGHT 
ANY UM COMMENTS ON ALL OF THAT 
THAT'S UH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WHERE'S THE MONEY MAYBE 
YEAH 
AND WHO WATCHES T. V. 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THIS THIS KINDA TOUCHES ON YOUR COMMENTS THERE DAVID 
THESE ARE THE AGE GROUPS WHICH WE HAVE INFORMATION ON AND THESE ARE THIS IS A TABLE OF UH WHAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY MORE FOR A CERTAIN FEATURE 
JUST GIVES US A ROUGH IDEA OF WHERE THE W THE WALL TO SPEND MONEY ON T. V. EQUIPMENT IS 
MOSTLY FOCUSED AROUND THE TWENTY FIVE AGE GROUP 
SORT OF YOUNG PROFESSIONAL KIND OF 
MM-HMM 
OH YEAH IT'S THE 
YEP 
IT DOES IT DOES FIT WITH THE MARKET THAT WE'RE SORT OF IDENTIFYING IN TERMS OF 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SURE 
SURE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BUT YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
IF WE CAN 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
COULD TO BE ON ON OFF THING 
LIKE IF YOU WANT TO N YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SURE 
SURE 
YEAH 
SURE 
YEAH 
SURE 
YEP 
YEP 
YEAH IT'S GOOD WELL IT'S GOOD TO GET DOES IT WHILE THEY'RE FRESH IN MIND 
UM 
NOT 
YEAH 
AND NOT LOSING 
AND ALSO IT HELPS IN TERMS OF PEOPLE NOT LOSING THIS YOU KNOW THEY THEY'RE SAYING OH IT'S I ALSO IT IN THE COUCH 
LIKE WE'RE KIND OF WHAT WE'RE B SORT OF GETTING N NOT HERE IS MATING DIFFERENT UH DESIGN FEATURES TOGETHER THAT THEY 
RIGHT 
OH REALLY YOU'VE SEEN ONE BEFORE 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
SURE 
SURE 
YEP 
RIGHT 
AND LIKE IN THE MEANS B SINCE WE'RE IN THE TOPIC OF THE TECHNOLOGY UH ARE THERE ANY LIKE WHAT OUR OUR OPTIONS 
ALRIGHT WHAT'S WHAT I ONE IS THIS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE GO ABOUT IT OR OR THREE THREE THEN 
RIGHT 
THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF 
'KAY 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
AND UM JUST A CLARIFICATION BEFORE WE FINISH THIS 
UH DOES C IS OUR CONTROLLER IS TO HAVE THE OPTION OF BEING UM IN A STANDARD UH FREQUENCY IS ALL OF THE OTHER EQUIPMENT 
SO THAT THE ONE CONTROLLER CAN CONTROL SEVERAL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT 
OKAY 
JUST TO T. V. OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S GOOD 
AND SO IT GOING TO INCLUDE ANY OF THE UH THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES OR ARE WE GONNA ELIMINATE THOSE 
OKAY 
OR IS IT IS IT IS IT IS IS IT INTO AN OPTION STILL THAT WE INCLUDE SOME THINGS JUST AS A SORT OF UNDER LIKE SORT OF UNDER A DOOR OR SOME 
'CAUSE WHAT WHAT I'M I'D BE A BIT WORRIED ABOUT SO IF SOMEONE WAS UH HAD PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED HABITS OF EXPECTING TO CONTROL SURROUND SOUND OR THIS AND THAT WITH THEIR CONTROLLER AND THEN AND THEN THEY 
YOU KNOW W THEY GET OURS AND W IT'S DOESN'T HAVE THAT 
I DUNNO IF THAT'D BE A PROBLEM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
'KAY OKAY 
LIKE THAT 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM OKAY GREAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM YEAH JUST I JUST WANTED TO ASK THEN BEFORE WE WRAP UP 
SHALL WE AGREE FOR SAKE OF UM SORT OF CLARITY AND WHEN WE WHEN WE R RESUME THAT WE'LL U USE THIS IDEA DAVID'S PROPOSED 
WHERE WE THINK OF THESE OTHER SORT OF BUCKETS AND ANYTHING ANYTHING WE DISCUSS ABOUT THEM IS SORT OF OKAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS 
SHALL WE DO THAT THEN 
OKAY GREAT 
AND AND CHANNEL 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
COLOUR YEAH 
SURE 
SURE 
OKAY 
AND THEN K I SUPPOSE QUITE LIKELY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IN THE D DEVICE CATEGORY THERE MIGHT BE SOME WHICH ARE JUST LIKE THE HABITUAL STANDARD AND THEN OTHERS WHICH ARE MAYBE A BIT MORE YEAH 
SURE OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
GREAT 
THEN WE GET TO GO FIND OUT WHAT WAS PICKED UP FOR LUNCH FOR US 
OKAY 
OKAY WELL 
OKAY 
OKAY WE ALL READY TO GO 
WELL HOW UM IN THE ON THIS MEETING THEN IF WE UM 
I'LL JUST JUST RECAP ON THE MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING 
AND WE UH DECIDED ON 
DECIDED ON OUR OUR TARGET GROUP BEING FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE AND WE DECIDED THAT IT WAS GONNA BE NON RECHARGEABLE BATTERY POWERED 
THAT WE'RE GONNA GROUP OUR AUDIO VISUAL AND OTHER FUNCTIONS INTO INTO THOSE CATEGORIES UM 
AND I TOLD YOU GUYS ABOUT THE OTHER NEW REQUIREMENTS ABOUT IGNORING TELETEXT IGNORING EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE T. V. 
AND TRYING TO INCORPORATE THE THE UH CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN 
UM SO THAT WAS THE LAST MEETING 
SO THERE ANYTHING HAVE I FORGOTTEN ANYTHING 
SO THAT EVERYTHING 
OKAY 
UM SO IF WE HAVE THE THREE PRESENTATIONS AND THEN IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO KIND OF THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO DISCUSS 
MAYBE JUST MAKE A NOTE OF IT AND WE'LL HAVE ALL THE DISCUSSION AT THE END 
THAT MIGHT BE A BETTER IDEA THIS TIME 
AND SO IF WE START OFF UH WITH ANDREW AND THEN CRAIG AND THEN DAVID IF THAT'S ALRIGHT 
UM AND THEN AFTER THAT WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT STUFF RIGHT 
SO IF YOU WANNA TAKE THIS 
SCREWED IN QUITE TIGHTLY 
UH WHAT DID UH HOW DID WE LEAVE IT WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION NOW 
WE DID WE SAY WE WERE GONNA TRY MAYBE INCORPORATE IT BUT WE HADN'T MADE A DEFINITE DECISION ON THAT 
RIGHT 
UH I SHOULD ALSO POINT TO THAT UM THE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF FINAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS MEETING IS TO REACH A DECISION ON THE CONCEPTS OF THE PRODUCT 
SO UM THAT'S KIND OF THE END RESULT HOPEFULLY 
UH-HUH 
HOPEFULLY APPEAR IN A WEE SECOND 
UP THERE WE GO 
OH NO 
OH RIGHT 
HERE WE GO 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YOU A FOUR POINT DEFINITELY 
OKAY 
YOU RIGHT 
UH-HUH 
OKAY

UH PLUG YOURS IN THEN 
MM 
NOT QUITE 
UH SOMETHING COMING NOW YEAH 
THERE WE GO 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
I THINK IT'S YELLOW BECAUSE LIKE THE WEBSITE IS YELLOW AND THERE'S A BOUND TO THE BOTTOM IS YELLOW IS YELLOW 
LEMON YOU KNOW DEFINITELY FOOD FOR THOUGHT THERE BUT KEEP GOING AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT AFTER 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
MM 
YE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT THAT WAS VERY GOOD AND UH NOW WITH DAVID 
I KNOW IT'D BE HANDY WOULDN'T IT 
DO YOU DO YOU WANNA SIT ON THE THE LINE OF SIGHT OF THIS UM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
W YOU COULDN'T HAVE LIKE PLASTIC AND RUBBER 
YEAH 
MM 'KAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
I'LL CLEAR ONE OF THESE THINGS FOR YOU 
JUST BY MOVING IT YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
W YEAH 
OH YEAH YEAH I SEE 
YEAH 
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
RIGHT CAN I 
YEAH WELL YEAH IT'S JUST I'M QUITE KEEN TO GET THE DISCUSSION GOING WITH THE TIME WE'VE LEFT SO BUT YEAH YOU C ASK AWAY 
MM 
WHY WHAT KIND OF LIGHT DO YOU WANT ARE YOU THINKING OF 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
LIKE A PHONE YEAH LIKE THE BACKLIGHT IN A PHONE 
OKAY COOL 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT OKAY UM WELL LET'S JUST GO RIGHT BACK TO THE MARKETING IDEAS FOR A START 
AND JUST GIVING AN D D ON THE TIME WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES TO PLAY WITH IT MUST 
SO UM YEAH SO JUST TO TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS MEETING IS TO REACH AN DECISION ON THE THE THE CONCEPTS OF THE PRODUCT 
SO BACK TO YOUR IDEA ABOUT UM INCORPORATING THE IDEA OF LIKE FRUIT AND VEG AND THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
UM I MEAN WHAT DOES EVERYBODY THINK ABOUT 
DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY IDEAS OF ABOUT HOW WE CAN FIT ALL THAT IN TOGETHER 
I MEAN THAT'S KIND OF THE USER INTERFACE TYPE OF THING WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT 
SO MAYBE DO YOU ARE WE THINKING SOMETHING THAT LIKE SO COULD SIT ON YOUR HAND COMFORTABLY OR DO YOU THE YOU'D HOLD ONTO COMFORTABLY OR 
SO SOMETHING QUITE CURVY 
OKAY UM RIGHT OKAY 
COLOUR WISE I MEAN YOU MADE A R UH WAS IT YOU ARE UH I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO MADE THE POINT ABOUT HOW IF YOU'VE A NICE BRIGHT COLOUR YOU'LL NOT LOSE IT 
WAS THAT 
WHOSE ABOUT HOW IF YOU HAVE A BRIGHT COLOUR YOU'LL NOT LOSE IT AS MUCH 
UM AND WHEN THE CORPORATE COLOUR IS YELLOW I MEAN MAYBE WE COULD THINK ABOUT ABOUT THE COLOUR OF THE WHOLE PRODUCT BEING YELLOW I DON'T KNOW 
UM 
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE UH THE MATERIALS WHEN IT HAS ANYBODY GOT LIKE AN OVERALL PICTURE IN THEIR MIND ABOUT WHAT WHAT MIGHT WORK 
THAT'S ALL 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
UH YOU KNOW LIKE IN CIRCULAR IN SHAPE OR 
CHOICE OF MATERIAL YEAH 
'CAUSE I I I WAS KINDA THINKING ABOUT AS WELL YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET THESE SHOCK RESISTANT MOBILE PHONES 
AND THEY'RE PLASTIC BUT THEN ALSO HAVE LIKE RUBBER ON THE OUTSIDE AND IT KINDA FEELS IT FEELS KIND OF WARMER TO THE TOUCH 
IT FEELS A BIT MORE COMFORTABLE AND MAYBE WE COULD INCORPORATE PLASTIC AND RUBBER 
NOT TOO 
AND THEN THEN WE COULD HAVE CURVED SHAPES 'CAUSE WOOD OR TITANIUM YEAH 
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE BOXY AND RECTANGULAR AND I THINK WE MIGHT BE MOVING AWAY FROM THAT YOU KNOW SO UM 
WELL I'M DO WE REALLY WANT IT IN LIKE THE SHAPE OF A LEMON OR NO I DON'T THINK WE DO OTHER 
OKAY RIGHT WELL UM SO THOUGHTS ABOUT THE ACTUAL SHAPE OF THE THING 
A SNOWMAN SHAPE 
UH-HUH 
THAT'S QUITE A DISTINCTIVE SHAPE THAT WOULD BE GOOD WOULDN'T IT 
YEAH SO YEAH SHOULD WE GO WITH THAT 
DO YOU WANNA DRAW IT IN THE BOARD 
OH THAT'D BE GOOD 
MM-HMM 
SO CALL IT THE SNOWMAN SHAPE TRADEMARK 
YEAH THAT'S COOL 
UM AND I MEAN COLOUR WISE WHAT DOES EVERYBODY THINK 
I THINK IT IS QUITE IMPORTANT TO GET YELLOW IN THERE SOMEWHERE 
I MEAN DO YOU WANT THE WHOLE THING YELLOW MAYBE LIKE YELLOW AND WHAT DO YOU WANT SOMETHING 
UH-HUH 
OKAY COOL 
UM AND ALSO I MEAN HOW ARE WE GOING TO INCORPORATE THE SLOGAN ON 
THE FACT THAT IT TALKS TO YOU I MEAN IT MIGHT BE QUITE COOL IF WHEN YOU FIRST START USING IT IT SAYS 
WHAT IS IT PUTTING FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS OR SOMETHING I DUNNO 
OR WHEN YOU LOOK OR IF YOU TURN IT OFF OR SOMETHING IF IT CAN SPEAK IF IT COULD ACTUALLY SAY THE SLOGAN IT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE POWERFUL THAN JUST HAVING IT WRITTEN ON IT SOMEWHERE 
I D I DO ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT AT ALL 
I KNOW 
UM UNLESS IN A I MEAN IF YOU ALSO WOULD THAT WORK IF WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE UM AN L. C. D. DISPLAY WHERE WOULD WE PUT THAT 
WOULD WE PUT THAT IN THE INSIDE OR 
IT'S BOUND TO INCREASE THE COST OF IT A LOT I WOULD'VE THOUGHT 
YEAH 
MM UH YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
SO SO ON AND FOR AN L. C. D. DISPLAY 
I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY COMPLEX 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS REALLY IN UM 
I WOULD SAY ONE AND FOR A TALK BACK 
UH DOES ANYBODY DISAGREE WITH THAT 
NO 
EASY 
OKAY UM RIGHT SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE THREE DIFFERENT SETS OF OF FUNCTIONALITIES 
UM I MEAN DO YOU WANNA GROUP THEM NOT SO AHEAD OF THE SNOWMAN BODY OF THE SNOWMAN INSIDE OF THE SNOWMAN IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING 
OKAY 
OKAY RIGHT UM WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT 
SO I'M JUST GONNA UM POP THIS ONE HERE 'CAUSE I HAVE A SLIDE ABOUT DECISION MAKING WHICH I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT 
OH SH GOD WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES UM OKAY UH BACK WE GO 
UM ENERGY WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S SUGGESTING WE'RE HOW WE'RE POWERING THE THING 
I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF THIS KINETIC THING WHERE YOU'D HAVE THE BACK UP OF THE BATTERY 
BUT HAVE HAVE KINETIC POWER I MEAN WHAT DOES ANYBODY THINK ABOUT THAT 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I SUPPOSE THAT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE AWAY AND YOU'RE NOT USING IT THEN YOU'RE NOT USING ANY POWER EITHER 
SO YOU'D HAVE THE BATTERY IS THE KIND OF TO KEEP IT TICKING OVER IDEA I'M REALLY SORRY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WRAP UP QUITE QUICKLY 
WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH TIME SO I THOUGHT 
UM SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT ENERGY IS REFERRING TO HERE 
CHIP ON PRINT IS THAT THAT'S AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGN THING IS IT DAVID 
OKAY UM SO FOR THE CASE KIND OF DISCUSSED THAT 
YEAH I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE RUBBER BUTTONS THAT FILE KIND OF 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
COULD HAVE THINGS LIKE BACKLIGHTING THE BUTTONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
YOU THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA 
SO SO LIKE CUR SLIGHTLY TRANSPARENT CASE IS IT'S YELLOW LIKE TINTED YELLOW BUT YOU CAN MAYBE SEE THROUGH IT 
SO THAT WHAT YOU MEAN 
OKAY 
LIGHTS 
OKAY 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH IF YOU ARE HOLDING IT IN YOUR HAND YOU COULD YOU COULD DO THAT COULDN'T YOU 
IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT IN YOUR HAND YOU COULD 
DO YOU THINK 
OKAY 
MM 
YEAH OKAY OKAY UM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
JUST 
OKAY UM RIGHT WELL WOULDN'T IT WE DO NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER WE WANT TO INCORPORATE A JOG DIAL IN NICE AND QUICKLY 
UM I'M ALL FOR THEM ACTUALLY I THINK THEY'RE QUITE YOU KNOW THE VERY QUICK TO ME TO USE 
SO DOES ANYBODY OPPOSE THE IDEA OF OF INCORPORATING IN INTO THE DESIGN AT ALL 
NO 
AND THE OTHER THING WAS UM CAN WE THINK OF ANY WAY OF GETTING THE SLOGAN INTO THIS THING 
UH-HUH 
UH-HUH OH OKAY WE REALLY GOTTA WRAP UP SO YEAH 
OKAY WELL IF WE CAN DO THAT GREAT 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH LET'S LET'S TRY AND GET THE SLOGAN ON THEIR UM AND 
MM 
OKAY 
RIGHT I'M GONNA HAVE TO I'M REALLY GONNA HAVE TO HURRY YOU IN HERE 'CAUSE WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY OVER TIME 
UM SO THERE ANYTHING ANYBODY'S UNSURE ABOUT 
JUST FOR IN CLOSING JUST THE NEXT MEETING'S GONNA BE IN THIRTY MINUTES 
AND SO YOU CAN SEE IN THE SCREEN HERE WHAT EACH OF YOU ARE GONNA HOPEFULLY BE DOING 
UH I KNOW THAT THE DESIGNERS ARE GONNA BE WORKING WITH PLAY DOH ON THAT 
SO UM THAT'LL BE THAT'LL BE GOOD 
UM AND I'LL GET THE THE MINUTES UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
ANYTHING AT ALL YOU THINK WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THAT WE NEED TO 
SO EVERYBODY KIND OF HAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BE DOING 
OKAY 
THAT'S KIND OF A DESIGN THING THAT YOU GUYS CAN CAN DISCUSS YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
TO MAKE SOMETHING FLUSH WITH THE CASE 
OKAY RIGHT 
OKAY 
SP KINDA GRIPPY 
OKAY 
OKAY I'M GONNA HAVE TO I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL THIS TO A CLOSE 'CAUSE WE'RE WAY OVER TIME 
SO UM THAT'S REALLY GOOD LIKE WE'VE S HAD MUCH TO TALK ABOUT THAT UM PRETTY MUCH RUN OUT OF TIME TO DO IS 
SO OFF YOU GO AND DESIGN STUFF WOOH 
YEAH QUITE JEALOUS ACTUALLY 
'S TO DO NOW IS TO DECIDE HOW TO FULFIL WHAT YOUR STUFF IS IS IN THAT SENSE IS IT DOES KIND OF MAKE SENSE YEAH 
YEP 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
NO 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
IT'S PROBABLY NOT SENDING 
YEAH 
YEP THERE TO USE 
AND THE PLAY DOH 'S YELLOW 
COOL 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY UM 
OOPS 
YEAH OKAY 
LET ME JUST GET THIS GOING FIRST 
OH THERE TO USE 
'KAY THAT SHOULD BE TOO 
OKAY UM I GUESS THE SAME THING AGAIN I STARTED WITH SOMETHING VERY BASIC 
SO JUST SO YOU GUYS HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT'S INVOLVED IN MY PROCESS 
UM AND THEN YOU CAN JUST WORK THROUGH IT AND WE 'LL EITHER MODIFY IT OR START FROM SCRATCH UM DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR NEEDS ARE 
UM THE COMPONENTS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME 
UM I THINK LIKE WHAT YOU GUYS SAID UM THE MOST INPUT THAT'S NEEDED IS BASICALLY IN THE USER INTERFACE 
THE REST OF THE COMPONENTS UM THEY DO HAVE AN IMPACT IN TERMS OF COST AND COMPLEXITY 
UM LIKE YOU SAID TIME TO MARKET WAS A PROBLEM UM AND HOW MANY COMPONENTS ARE PHYSICALLY IN THERE IN COST 
AND THE POWER IS BASICALLY A FACTOR OF THAT 
UM AND THE LOWER COMPONENTS THE POWER THE LOGIC THE TRANSMITTER AND THE INFRARED UM THEY AFFECT YOU IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF YOUR DEVICE 
UM AND THAT WOULD HAVE SOME INTE IMPACT ON HOW YOU I THINK MORE HOW YOU HOLD RATHER THAN UM THE ACTUAL IS USING THE THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE UM LIKE WE'VE SAID WE'VE DEFINED 
LIKE WE ONLY WANT THE BASIC THINGS THAT TO BE VISIBLE AND THE REST OF THEM WE TRY TO HEAD 
SO UM YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WORKING OUT SPACE 
SO I GUESS THREE THINGS UM COST UM COMPLEXITY AND THE SIZE 
THESE ARE THE OTHER THINGS THAT UM WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOU 
SO JUST GO THROUGH IT IN THE COMPONENTS 
UM THESE ARE THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU 
UM I'M NOT VERY SURE ABOUT THE VOICE THING 'CAUSE I GOT ANOTHER EMAIL AND IT WAS IN FACT QUITE SKETCHY ON WHAT IN THE VOICE OPTIONS OR 
UM IT SAID IT COULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LISTEN 
I IT SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A SENSOR BUT NEVER CLARIFIED THAT 
SO MAYBE IF YOU WILL I COULD USE THE OTHER EMAIL THAT THEY SENT YOU 
UM 'CAUSE THEY GET BACK TO ME WITH LIKE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS ARE DIFFERENT OFFERINGS OF WHAT COMPONENTS AVAILA 
OKAY SO YOUR BASIC COMPONENTS ARE BUTTONS OKAY AND YOU HAVE A WHEEL AVAILABLE LIKE A MOUSE SCROLL WHEEL 
OKAY THERE'S AN L. C. D. DISPLAY UM I THINK THESE ARE QUITE STANDARD THINGS 
NO UM THEY'RE WELL IN THE SENSE THAT THESE ARE ALL THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR YOU 
I'LL EXPLAIN IT YOU THE COMPLEXITY AND THE COST THING AGAIN A BIT LATER 
OKAY UM THEN THERE'S UM HOW THE CASE ACTUALLY LOOKS 
IT CAN ACTUALLY BE FLAT OR IT CAN BE CURVED 
UM AND THEN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIALS THAT YOU CAN USE UM I DON'T THINK YOU CAN USE THEM IN A COMBINATION 
UM BUT UM I COULD CHECK BACK FOR YOU BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THEM IN A COMBINATION 
UM I THINK PLASTIC AND RUBBER WOULD BE FINE BUT PLASTIC RUBBER AND WOOD I WASN'T I'M NOT VERY SURE ABOUT THE TITANIUM 
THEY HAD SOME RESTRICTIONS ON USING THE RUBBER AND THE TITANIUM 
UM THE RUBBER WAS A RESTRICTION ON THE KIND OF POWER SOURCE YOU COULD USE 
BUT THE TITANIUM HAD A DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS IN THE SHAPE OF THE THING SO I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME RESTRICTION ON UM 
I THINK YOU COULD PROBABLY GROUP PLASTIC AND RUBBER TOGETHER WOOD AND TITANIUM 
BUT YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE EASIER FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE AND A COMPLEXITY JUST TO USE ONE 
YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO TWO 
UM AND THE OTHER COMPONENTS ARE LOGIC CHIPS UM AGAIN I'LL I'LL GO BACK TO THE COMPONENT CHIPS 
THE COM HOW COMPLEX OR HOW EASY THE LOGIC IS IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY FUNCTIONS YOU HAVE ON THE ON THE UNIT 
UM AND THAT IMPACTS COST 
UM I DON'T THINK THE LOGIC CHIP HAS A ISSUE ABOUT SIZE 'CAUSE THEY SHOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE 
POWER CONSUMPTION SHOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME 
UM I THINK THE MAIN IMPACT IS COMPLEXITY UM AND THE OTHER THING IS UM THE POWER OPTIONS 
UM THE FIRST ONE IS A STANDARD BATTERY 
OKAY THE SECOND ONE I THINK IS MORE OF A GIMMICK THEN ACTUALLY A USEABLE THING IT'S A WIND UP YOU KNOW A CRANK 
YEAH BUT THAT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A LOOK AND FEEL DECISION BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE ONE POWER SOURCE IF YOU'RE USING THE ALTERNATIVE POWER SOURCES 
I THINK WHATEVER IT AS YOU STILL NEED A BATTERY 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO KEEP DOING ONE THING 
OKAY THE OTHER ONES ARE A SOLAR POWERED CELL 
WHICH MAY NOT BE A GREAT IDEA IN EUROPE OR ANY COUNTRY THAT HAS SEASONS 'CAUSE HALF THE YEAR YOU'D BE DEAD 
SO LIKE WHAT I SAID YOU PROBABLY AND LIKE A BATTERY AND SOMETHING ELSE 
UM AND THE KINETIC ONE I GUESS FOR ME IS THE MOST INTERESTING IN BECAUSE IT'S MOVEMENT AND PEOPLE LIKE TO FIDDLE WITH THEIR AND IT'S A NICE SALES GIMMICK I THINK 
FROM A MARKETING GIMMICK IT IT'S A TECHNOLOGY THING IT'S A SHAKE IT IT DOESN'T WORK SHAKE IT KNOCK IT OR SOMETHING 
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOU HAD THOSE BALLS YOU KNOW THOSE STRESS BALLS WHERE YOU BOUNCE THE BALL AND IT AND IT LIGHTS UP AND IT GOES 
YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE A GIMMICK COMBINED WITH RUBBER 
YOU KNOW JUST TO IF YOU GET FRUSTRATED WI REMOTE CONTROL YOU CAN THROW IT KIND OF YOU KNOW JUST UH YOU KNOW UM SO 
UM OKAY MY FROM MY ROLE I DON'T THINK THAT PERSONAL PREFERENCES BUT ROLE PREFERENCES I THINK UM SOMETHING COMFORTABLE TO HOLD 
UM SMALL AND SLIM I GUESS THAT'S MORE ON THE SENSE OF SMALL AND SLIM IN TERMS OF COMFORTABLE NOT SO SMALL YOU CAN'T 
YOU KNOW LIKE A PHONE OR SOMETHING TOO SMALL PHONE 
UM AND THE OTHER THING IS FROM A PRODUCTION POINT OF VIEW UM THE LESS COMPONENTS WE USE AND THE SIMPLER THE COMPONENTS MEANS YOU REDUCE YOUR COST AND YOU INCREASE YOUR PROFIT 
UM AND ALSO THE TIME TO MARKET AND THE COMPLEXITY OF DEVELOPING DESIGNING AND DEBUGGING IT UM SO 
UM OKAY LET ME JUST GO BACK AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS 
UM 
THE USER INTERFACE RESTRICTIONS BASICALLY MEANS THAT IF YOU USE MORE COMPLICATED FEATURES 
LIKE THE BUTTONS ARE STANDARD OKAY THE L. C. D. PANEL AND THE SCROLL WHEEL YOU NEED MORE COMPLICATED LOGIC 
UM THE CASE OKAY WITH A RUBBER CASE YOU CAN'T HAVE THE SOLAR PANELS 
OKAY WITH THE TITANIUM CASE LET ME JUST CHECK THAT UM TITANIUM CASE CAN'T BE CURVED IT HAS TO BE SQUARE 
OKAY UM THERE'S NO RESTRICTION ON THE PLASTIC AND IT CAN'T BE CURVED ON THE WOOD 
SO THAT'S AGAIN I DON'T THINK YOU CAN USE THEM IN A COMBINATION UM ESPECIALLY THE TITANIUM I I SUSPECT THEY'RE VERY FIXED AT A PARTICULAR AND 
SO UM MIXING THEM MAY NOT BE A GOOD IDEA UM YEP 
THAT'S IT 
UM I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE THE L. C. D. PANEL REQUIRES POWER AND THE L. C. D. IS A FORM OF A LIGHT SO THAT 
OR YOU THINKING ARE YOU THINKING OF OF A LIGHT ON THE SENSE OF UM A LIGHT LIGHT 
OR A LIGHT ON THE SENSE OF IT GLOWS KIND OF YOU KNOW FRANKENSTEIN IT'S ALIVE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM THAT'S WHY I THINK THE OPTION OF THE THE KINETIC THING WHICH BASICALLY MEANS AS LONG AS YOU SHAKE IT LIKE A WATCH LIKE AN AUTOMATIC WATCH 
UM IT'S PROBABLY SENSITIVE ENOUGH WHEN YOU FIDDLE IT 
SO YOU COULD TRIGGER THAT IT A LIGHT LIKE I SAID THE BOUNCING BALL THING 
OR YOU COULD TRIGGER THAT IT IS THAT TO POWER THE LIGHT AS OPPOSED TO USE WHEN THEY PICK IT UP 
RIGHT AND THEN THAT THAT SORTA TRIGGERS THE 
GLOWINGNESS 
I THINK UH MADE THAT 
SO THERE A PARTICULAR SHAPE THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN 
LIKE DOES MARKETING HAVE ANY RESEARCH ON DOES IT NEED TO BE LONG 
DOES IT AND WITH A SQUARE THING WHA 
YEAH 'CAUSE THAT WILL N HELP NARROW DOWN THE CHOICE OF 
LIKE FRUIT 
I'M THINKING FRUITS IN MY HEAD BUT THAT'S TACKY 
DO WE NEED AN L. C. D. DISPLAY 
WHAT WHAT'S THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THAT 
YEAH BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE USING IT WHAT WOULD WE WHAT WOULD WE ACHIEVE FROM IT 
PUTTING IN LIGHTS IS CHIP ABOUT PUTTING IN AN L. C. D. PANEL JUST TO MAKE IT GLOW IS A BIT OF A 
MM-HMM 
I THINK THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AN INPUT DEVICE TO GET THE LISTINGS INTO IT 
SO UM IT'S A BIT NUTS TO GET THE MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY YOU KNOW 
UM I I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S ONE AND FOR AN L. C. D. DISPLAY BUT UM IT'S WHAT'S WHAT WHAT WOULD TO TELL THE USER 
'CAUSE THE L. C. D. TENDS TO BE AN OUTPUT AS UH AS OPPOSED TO AN INPUT SO UM DOES THE REMOTE CONTROL AND TO TALK BACK TO THE USER 
WE HAVE THE OPTION OF THE SPEAKER AS WELL THE USE THE SAME THING GOES FOR THE SPEAKER 
SO THERE A AND FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO TO TALK BACK 
UM 
YOU COULD PUT A GAME ON IT 
WHEN THE T. V. DIES YOU CAN PLAY WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL 
WHERE WOULD YOU PHYSICALLY POSITION THE BUTTONS 
UM I THINK THAT THAT HAS SOME IMPACT ON IN IN MANY THINGS 
UM MAYBE YOU WANNA DRAW ONTO THE 
YEP 
NO LIKE I SAID WE HAVE A H HYBRID KIND OF THING IS IT'S NOT GONNA CHARGE THE BATTERY IT'S JUST 
YEAH 
YEP 
YES YES 
OR EVEN A CLEAR CASE 
UM YOU KNOW A A GLOWING A A GLOWING YELLOW TYPE CASE WHERE THE YELLOW IS SHOWABLE BUT IN THE DARK IT SORT OF IT'S ALIVE 
UM IN IN A SLIGHT SUBTLE WAY 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
OR ARE THERE MIGHT BE A LIGHT RUNNING THROUGH IT LIKE A MOUSE 
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE CORDLESS MICE AND THEY DON'T AT THAT MUCH POWER RIGHT 
SO THE POWER THE BATTERY IN THAT SENSE MAYBE YOU HAVE ONE OR TWO STRATIG STRATEGICALLY PLACED LIGHTS THAT SORT OF 
YEAH BUT BECAUSE THE CASE IS TRANSPARENT SO IT GIVES IT A LITTLE BIT OF A GLOW DOESN'T MAKE IT FREAKY 
THE QUESTION IS WHEN YOU'RE ROLLING IT HOW DO YOU WANNA ROLL IT 
DO YOU WANT 'EM TO ROLL IT LIKE THAT 
DO YOU WANT 'EM TO ROLL IT LIKE THAT 
'CAUSE IN A MOUSE YOUR HAND'S IN A POSITION TO ROLL IT 
WHEREAS THE OTHER THING ABOUT HAVING IT JOG DIAL THIS WAY IT TENDS TO GET MOVED ACCIDENTALLY 
THAT'S A VERY UNNATURAL MOTION TO YEAH 
CAN YOU IMAGINE YOU HAVE TO SCROLL A LOT 
UM IT MIGHT WORK FOR VOLUME AND MAYBE SOME OF THE BRIGHTNESS CONTROLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT NOT FOR CHANNELS RIGHT 
IF YOU HAVE A TELEWEST BOX YOU'VE GOT LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ALL THE CHANNELS YOU'VE ABOUT FIFTY CHANNELS CAN YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO 
UM AND I DON'T THINK HAVING THAT YOU KNOW TOO QUICK TOO SLOW KIN IT'S CONFUSING AT THE I DUNNO 
BUT USERS TEND TO TEND TO WANT TO USE THAT AND ONCE THEY LOSE IT IN THE USER EXPERIENCE THEY'RE LIKE 
BECAUSE THAT'S BECOMES THE MOST ACCESSIBLE THING IN FRONT OF 
YEAH 
SO YOU WANNA EXPAND THE SHAPE OF THE 
THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE NO PROBLEM IN TERMS OF UM IN TERMS OF WHETHER YOU'RE LEFT HANDED OR YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED YOU MIGHT BE LOCKING YOURSELF ON 
COULD I JUST COULD I JUST JUMP IN AND SUGGEST SOMETHING QUICKLY 
UM I THINK ONE THING WOULD BE THE JOG DIAL 'CAUSE THAT'S GONNA HAVE QUITE A BIG IMPACT ON THE THING UM 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING THE A SLIDE BECAUSE THEN YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT THE HAND 
I THINK INCORPORATING A LOGO IS QUITE STRAIGHT FORWARD 
THERE'S LOTS OF SPACE FOR IT UM 
YEAH BUT IT'S ALSO A A MARKETING AND A FUNCTION 
YEAH 
FEEL LIKE FRUIT 
FRUITS KIDS 
NO LIKE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH KINDA LIKE THAT YEAH 
PLAY DOH TIME 
YOU GET TO CHOOSE FIRST 
NO WE'RE KIDDING 
OKAY CAN I JUST SWIPE YOUR POWER CABLE I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS 
OKAY LEMME OKAY I'M GONNA PULL EVERYBODY AT FIRST AND THEN PUT IN WHOEVER NEEDS TO BE LEFT 
IT'S YOU 
ARGH 
THIS IS A REAL HASSLE AND A OOPS 
I'M GONNA TAKE THE MICROPHONES 'CAUSE IT'S TOO LAZY TO TAKE THEM OFF AGAIN 
COOL 
SO IT WORKING 
AND SO THINK OF THIS CONCEPT 
UM TO RESEARCH IT I'VE UM HAD A LOOK ON THE THE HOMEPAGE AGAIN 
IT'S PROVIDED ME WITH MORE EXAMPLES OF UM PREVIOUSLY EXISTING C REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM THERE'S A WEE BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE OTHER EXISTING ONES THERE 
UM SO I'VE TAKEN THE UM SUGGESTIONS FROM THEM AND TRIED TO INCORPORATE THEM INTO THIS UM 
SO THEN THIS WE'RE LOOKING FOR UM SUGGESTIONS IN SIZE THE UM SIZE OF CONTROL AND THE BUTTONS 
UM THE SHAPE OF THE CONTROL AND WHEREABOUT THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE LOCATED ON THE CONTROL 
UM WHAT I FOUND FROM THE RESEARCH IS THAT MOST THE CURRENT CONTROLS ARE JUST BASICALLY BIG BRICKS WITH LOADS OF BUTTONS ALL OVER THEM 
UM THEY'RE NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT AND THEY'RE NOT VERY COMFORTABLE TO HOLD 
THEY'RE I JUST HOLD 'EM LIKE BIG BRICKS AND THEY'RE VERY EASILY LOST 
UM THEY TEND TO BE VERY DARK COLOURS SO IF THERE ARE SHADOWY PLACES DOWN THE SIDE OF COUCHES YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM 
UM THE THE CONTROLS THEMSELVES TEND TO USE A VERY INCONSISTENT COLOUR SCHEME 
UM FOR INSTANCE THE STAND BY BUTTON ISN'T ALWAYS READ UH IT REALLY SHOULD BE 
IT'S UH SOMETHING THE USER THEN UH IDENTIFY WITH 
THIS IS A RED SWITCH OFF THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE 
UM I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT BUT SOMETHING TO LOOK AT FOUR 
UM THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT I'VE I'VE GOT COUPLE OF PREFERENCES FOR THE THE END CONTROL UM I GET 'EM WITH THE THE RED COLOUR BUTTON FOR STAND BY AND SO THE OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT UM 
THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE LARGE 
THEY SHOULDN'T BE TINY LITTLE THINGS LIKE YOU GET IN SOME MOBILE PHONES 
THEY SHOULD BE EASY TO PRESS VERY COMFORTABLE 
UM ONE OF THE EXAMPLES GIVEN ON THE HOMEPAGE WAS UM THERE'S ONE UP AND DOWN VOLUME BUTTON BUT BOTH OF THEM HAVE A V. ON THEM 
SO THE UP VOLUME BUTTON LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD BE A DOWN VOLUME BUTTON THAT'S KINDA CONFUSING 
UM SHOULD AVOID S THINGS LIKE THAT 
UM OF THE THE CORPORATE COLOUR SCHEME ALLOWS IT WE SHOULD HAVE A VERY BRIGHT COLOUR IS THAT IT CAN BE EASILY IDENTIFIED ANYWHERE 
UM OBVIOUSLY TRYING TRYING TO AVOID BEING TACKY THERE BUT IT COULD UM IT IN VERY EASILY WITH YOUR YOUR LIME AND LEMON IDEA 
FANTASTIC 
UM 
ANY EXTRA FEATURES WE ADD BEYOND THE BASIC ONES SHOULD BE M HIDDEN 
THEY SHOULDN'T BE IN THE UM SHOULDN'T BE VISIBLE WITHOUT SOMETHING BE OPENED OR SOME SORT OF SPECIAL EXTRA EFFORT 
UM IF WE DID DECIDE TO GO FOR VOICE ACTIVATION THERE SHOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE A BUTTON AS ALTERNATIVE 
POSSIBLY HIDDEN IN THE THE OPENED UP SECTION UM MAKING THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH IT OR WITH SOMEBODY'S VOICE MAYBE THEY GOT A COLD OR 
UM WE SHOULD DEFINITELY AVOID THE BIG SQUARE BLOCK LOOK 
THAT'S JUST WRONG 
AND UM WE GOT AN EMAIL UH FROM I THINK IT'S THE THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 
AND THEY'VE USED THE THE VOICE CONTROL UM CAN NOW TALK BACK IF YOU ASK IT A QUESTION 
SO IT SH IT COULD BE GOOD TO HAVE THEM UM CONFIRM ANY ACTION YOU TAKE 
AND POSSIBILITY 
RIGHT AND THESE ARE PROBLEMS I'VE HAD WITH IT 
UM I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SLOGAN SHOULD GO ARE REALLY WHAT THE SLOGAN IS 
I THINK IT'S UM FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS 
AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW FLEXIBLE THE COLOUR SCHEME IS 
I MEAN YOU SAY YOU WANTED THE THE CORPORATE COLOURS BUT THEY DON'T SAY YOU KNOW IF WE CAN SEE ANY OTHER COLOURS AT ALL OR 
THAT'S IT 
I THINK I'M COOL 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
UM I THINK WE COULD GO FOR LIKE UM MAYBE NOT A P A FRUIT SHAPE BUT A VERY SORT OF CURVY TYPE SHAPE 
UM YOU COULD HAVE THE SAME SORT OF TEXTURE AND COLOUR IS A FRUIT 
UM PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT S SITS IN YOUR HAND COMFORTABLY SORT OF FEELS RIGHT ON YOUR HAND 
SO I'M 
I'D QUITE LIKE A SORT OF UH SNOWMAN TYPE SHAPE 
UM AS A P SORT OF LARGER BIT SITS IN YOUR HAND AND THEN YOU GET MAYBE ANOTHER BUBBLE AT THE TAPE FREE JUST ANY OTHER FUNCTION YOU NEED 
UM SOMETHING LIKE THAT UM YOU GOT TWO GROUPS THERE UM MAYBE IT COULD FOLD UP AND YOU GOT A THIRD GROUP INSIDE OR UH YOU HAVE VOLUME CONTROLS BUT THERE 
SO I RECKON IT'D LOOK QUITE NICE IF WE JUST HAD UM THIS HERE 
HAD A SORTA BACKGROUND YELLOW AND THEN HAVE SORT OF A NICE BOLD COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS 
I THINK THAT MIGHT SCARE ME 
I THINK THAT'D PROBABLY SCARE ME 
YOU TURN IT IN YOUR CONTROL POSSESSED S 
UM 
NAH 
UM WELL I THINK THE ADVANCED ONES THE THE ONES YOU DON'T USUALLY USE COULD BE HID INSIDE 
B UM I THINK THE WE HAD WERE FAIRLY BASIC ONES THEY'D HAVE TO GO ON THE THE FRONT SOMEWHERE 
UM 
YEAH I THINK SO YEAH 
MM 
WELL BUT THEN FOR ME FOR SKIPPING A LARGE AMOUNT OF CHANNELS YOU DO HAVE TO UH TO SKIP THE CHANNEL BUTTON THE NUMBER PART 
UH BUT 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
IT KINDA DOES MAKE SENSE DOESN'T IT BECAUSE WHEN WE GET INTO THE END OF MEETING WE'RE KIND OF TALKING ABOUT ACTION AND DESIGN AS OPPOSED TO BACKGROUND 
EVERYTHING I HAVE IS KINDA BACKGROUND 
MM-HMM 
UH THAT SOUNDS 
SURE 
OKAY 
SURE 
YEAH COOL 
WHY DON'T I GET THAT 
HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM ALRIGHT SO C IS IT FUNCTION F. EIGHT 
HMM 
COME ON 
I THINK IT'S WORKING 
OKAY GREAT S SO LET ME JUST START THIS 
OKAY GREAT 
SO UM UH S MOVE ON 
UH-HUH OH WHERE'D IT ALL GO 
IT'S NOT GOOD 
OKAY LEMME JUST SEE WHERE I CAN FIND OUT 
THIS LOOKS MORE LIKE IT 
I THINK I JUST OPENED UP THE TEMPLATE 
SORRY ABOUT THAT 
OKAY ALRIGHT SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK HERE 
OKAY SO THIS WAS THE METHOD THAT UM I'VE TAKEN 
UH BASICALLY WHAT I WANNA DO HERE BEFORE WE GET INTO IT UH IT FOR 
SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU ALL THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION I HAVE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IF WE WANT THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL 
AND UH AND THEN SORTA G GO THROUGH SOME OF THE WAY THAT I'VE DEALT WITH THAT INFORMATION 
AND THEN SORT OF BRING US ALL TOGETHER INTO IT IT IS SORTA SEE HOW THIS FITS IN WITH THE OVERALL VISION 
UM SO I'VE TRIED TO TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MARKET RESEARCH AND SUMMARISE IT FOR US 
AND THEN IDE IDENTIFY UH TRENDS THAT ARE ARE SORT OF IN SYNC AND ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR OUR UH P PROJECT PLAN THAT WE HAVE AS FAR 
AND THEN UH INITIATE A KIND OF DISCUSSION IN DESIGN OPTIONS IS THAT IT SORTA HELPS US TO TO NARROW IN IN IN ASPECTS THAT WILL INFORM OTHER UH OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE OF THE PROJECT 
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE THA THAT SORT OF STRATEGY 
I THOUGHT THAT THAT WILL IMPACT ON THE REST OF WHAT WE DO SO THAT'S WHY I SUGGESTED WE GET IN THIS 
OKAY SO IT IF UM DIFFERENT UH FIGURES AND RATINGS OB UH IF PEOPLE IN GENERAL 
UM CONSUMERS IN GENERAL THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WAS FOUND WAS THAT UH THE BAR TO TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL 
A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL OKAY AND NOT TOO SPECIFIED NOT A FUNCTIONAL LOOK OR OR FEEL UH B F F FANCY 
UM HOWEVER THIS IS WHERE WE KINDA HAVE TO BE VERY I THINK CREATIVE ABOUT IT 
NUMBER TWO WAS THAT TO BE INNOVATIVE 
OKAY SO THAT TELLS ME THAT WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO BE INNOVATIVE WITHOUT A ADDING JUST UNNECESSARY UM SORT OF FUNCTIONAL BITS TO IT 
UH AND THIRD PRIORITY UH FOR EASE OF US IS AGAIN THAT KIND OF GIVES US A GENERAL PICTURE OF HOW IT HAS TO BE 
UM QUITE USER FRIENDLY WHILE STILL HAVING TECHNOLOGY 
SO IT I'LL JUST SAY RIGHT WAY AS A BIT OF A FORESHADOWING INTO HOW WE PROCEED WITH THIS IN TERMS OF UM MARKETING 
SO THAT I THINK UM WHAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IS HOW THE UM 
BUT HOW THE INNOVATION UH CONTRIBUTES TO THE LOOK AND FEEL AND NOT AS MUCH TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT 
FOR EXAMPLE LIKE WHEN YOU PICK IT UP AND PUSH IT LOOK AT ALL LIGHTS UP OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE 
OR IT'S GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO TO THAT JUST SEEMS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE THING THAT THE MESSAGE HERE IS EASE OF US 
SO HOW DO YOU MAKE INNOVATION MAKE SOMETHING MORE MORE EASY TO USE 
WELL THAT'S I GUESS WHERE WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS 
OKAY THEN THERE'S THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE BACK THE THE MARKET UM 
RESEARCH I HAVE HERE IS IN FASHION STYLE OKAY WHICH IS WE'VE AGREED AS A PRIORITY 
UH TOP EUROPEAN FASHION TREND UM THAT I READ ABOUT SAYS THERE'S THIS EMERGING THEME OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES OKAY ESPECIALLY IN CLOTHES AND FURNITURE 
AND WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT I THOUGHT HMM WELL DO WE WANT TO ACTUALLY TRY AND THINK ABOUT THIS TREND AND HOW WE ADD SOMETHING TO IT 
ARE WE GET RIGHT INTO IT OR WE COMPLETELY STEER AWAY FROM TO DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
SO MY MY FEELING IS THAT WE WE DO WANT TO OBSERVE THIS TREND 
BUT WE WANT TO THINK ALSO ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT SORT OF HAS TO FIT IN WITH SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT SPECIFICALLY ELECTRONICS 
UM 'CAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'RE ON WHAT WE'RE ONE IS PARTLY SORT OF HOME DECOR PARTLY SOMETHING LIKE A COMPUTER 
UM SO I THINK WE MIGHT WANNA BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW HOW QUICKLY WE CREATE LIKE A REMOTE CONTROL IN THE SHAPE OF AN APPLE OR SOMETHING 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE PUSHING IT 
AND THEN IN TERMS OF UM MATERIAL TRENDS ARE FOR THINGS TO BE SOFT AND SPONGY AND SORT OF YOU MIGHT SAY ERGONOMIC OR OR FRIENDLY TO HANDLE 
WHICH IS WHICH ALSO IN INDICATED THAT LAST YEAR THIS WAS THIS WAS NOT THE CASE 
SO UM PROBABLY A LOT OF THE COMPETITION ON THE MARKET WILL BE STILL IN LAST YEAR'S MODE 
SO IF WE TRY AND REALLY CAPITALISE ON THAT I THINK THAT'LL BE IN OUR FAVOUR 
UM 
SO THIS THIS IS THE SUMMARY OF EVERYTHING 
UM STYLE SO NUMBER ONE UH THING IN THE ON THE MARKET OF WHO WE'RE SELLING IT 
UH INNOVATIVE DESIGN TECHNOLOGY'S ALSO A MOST IN THAT IT'S SEEN IT'D BE SEEN TO BE UH CUTTING EDGE 
UH BUT EASE OF USE IT HAS TO BE INSURED THROUGHOUT 
THAT WAS LIKE THE NUMBER THREE THING 
AND THEN AT THE END THERE ARE VIBRANT NATURAL COLOURS UM 
THAT'S THE WAY I INTERPRETED IT ANYWAY SOFTNESS IN MATERIALS SHAPE AND FUNCTION 
AND SO I'VE WRITTEN AT WRITTEN AT THE BOTTOM TO GIVE US SORT OF A CONTEXT OF DISCUSSION 
MAC IPODS SOMETHING WHICH IS I'D HAVE TO SAY VERY HIGH TECH 
TEN GIGABYTES WHATEVER BUT WHEN YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND THERE'S LIKE NO BUTTONS 
YOU KNOW WHAT A MAC IPOD IS 
I'M THINKING HOWEVER MAC IPOD IS SORT OF LAST YEAR'S BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD AND SORT OF GLASSY AND GLOSSY 
SO I'M THINKING IF WE IMAGINE THAT WE'RE TAKING SOME OF THE FEATURES OF A MAC IPOD AND WE'RE THAN MAKING IT IS MORE OF LIKE A MORE OF LIKE A COMFORTABLE TYPE OF OUR MORE OF LIKE A 
MAYBE MORE VIBRANT TO FRIENDLY THING TO HAVE 
UM AND THEN USE THIS IS W WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION WHAT I'M WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IN THIS SLIDE HERE IS THAT WE WE TAKE THESE IDEAS 
AND SO WE GET INTO MORE THE MORE UM TECHNI LIKE SORT OF PRODUCTION SIDE OF THINGS 
THAT WE THINK ABOUT SHAPE MATERIALS AND THEMES OR SERIES THAT GO THROUGHOUT 
SORT OF LIKE A 
I DUNNO LIKE UM WE THINK OF SOME KIND OF A THIN THEME THAT UNIFIES IT ALL THAT WE AGREE ON UH SORTA LIKE A MARKETING IDENTITY 
UM 
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE 
YEAH 
SO SO LIKE I THROW IT A FEW IDEAS THERE JUST TO KINDA GET US THINKING ALONG THOSE LINES LIKE LEMON 
LIME I DUNNO GREEN COLOURS PE WHATEVER IT'S JUST AN IDEA 
'CAUSE I'M THINKING THAT SOME OF THESE IDEAS WILL SEEM QUITE COHERENT IF WE USE THEM IN TERMS OF OTHER WHAT PEOPLE ASSOCIATE THOSE THEM WITH IN TERMS OF TEXTURE 
SHAPE COLOURS THINGS LIKE THAT 
LIKE UM THE ONES THE ONES WHICH I'M MOST FOND OF IN TERMS OF GIVING LIKE A THEM TO IT WOULD BE LIKE UM LIKE LEMON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WHICH IS LIKE YOU USE A LOT IN IN THREE EUROS 
LIKE I SEE LOTS OF WEBSITES AND THINGS THAT SEEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH LIKE LEMON AND LIME AND 
SO ANYWAY IT'S JUST JUST AN IDEA 
I'M THINKING MAYBE WE COULD INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE FEATURES INTO A FAIRLY UM NOT SOMETHING WHICH IS WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE SOMETHING TO TO WHICH IS ALMOST GIMMICKY BECAUSE LIKE UM LIKE SOMETHING TO DO WITH LIKE LIGHTING WITHIN IT 
LIKE YOU KNOW JUST WITHIN THE SAMPLE SENS WHEN YOU PICK UP A PHONE AND TOUCH A BUTTON TO UH LIGHTS UP Q USUALLY THE BUTTONS LIGHT UP 
HOW CAN WE BUILD IN THAT 
MAYBE LIKE IT COULD LIGHT UP IN DIFFERENT COLOURS OR SOMETHING OR ARE PEOPLE COULD BUY THE BY THE CONTROL AND THEN IT COMES WITH DIFFERENT LIKE 
COVERS OR SOMETHING SO 
ANYWAY THESE ARE THAT'S ALL I HAVE BUT UH HOPEFULLY WE CAN WE CAN REVISIT THOSE IDEAS WHEN WE GET INTO 
YEP 
DID YOU PRESS F. EIGHT 
YEAH 
OKAY DO WE HAVE A CORPORATE COLOUR SCHEME 
I DIDN'T KNOW 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
GREAT 
LOTS OF GOOD INFORMATION THERE 
IT'S A SHAME THE CABLE WASN'T JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE HUH 
JUST UM 
IT TAKES A SECOND DOESN'T IT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
THEY'RE STANDARD AREN'T THEY 
YEAH 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
NO 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IT CAN'T BE CURVED 
OKAY 
UH QUESTION ON CAN I ASK A QUESTION 
OKAY 
CAN WE UH POWER A LIGHT ON THIS 
CAN WE GOT A STRONG ENOUGH BATTERY TO POWER A LIGHT 
OKAY 
SO MAYBE ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN JUST TRY AND INCLUDE AS A REALLY GOOD BATTERY 
WELL 
I MEAN I'M THINKING IT MIGHT BE 
THAT FOR UH THIS TO BE A HIGH TECH THING IT'S GONNA HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING HIGH TECH ABOUT IT AND THAT'S GONNA TAKE BATTERY POWER 
AND TO MAKE THAT TO MAKE THAT A REALISTIC GOAL I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WILL COME UP LATER SO CAN THE BATTERY POWER IT 
ILLUMINATE THE BUTTONS 
YEAH IT GLOWS 
WELL UM I'M THINKING ALONG THE LINES IF YOU'RE YOU'RE IN THE DARK WATCHING A D. V. D. AND YOU UM YOU FIND THE THING IN THE DARK AND YOU GO LIKE THIS 
AND THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY DOES 
OH WHERE'S THE VOLUME BUTTON ON THE DARK AND UH Y YOU JUST TOUCH IT OR YOU JUST PICK IT UP AND IT LIGHTS UP OR SOMETHING 
LIKE A PHONE YEAH YEAH 
WHEREAS WITH PHONES PEOPLE CHARGE THEM ONCE A WEEK 
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO PUT IN A REALLY GOOD BATTERY SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO CHARGE THEIR R REMOTE CONTROL VERY FEW DAYS 
BUT ARE PEOPLE GONNA WANNA SHAKE THEIR MOVIE CONTROLLER 
RIGHT 
SURE 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY GREAT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT'S THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL I MEAN I'M THINKING THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS HAVE SOMETHING THAT KIND OF UNIFIES A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS 
AND IF WE THINK THAT WHAT WE ARE WE ARE NUMBER IN MARKETING MOTIVE IS UM THE LOOK AND FEEL 
SO FOR THE LOOK AND FEEL TO SEEM COHERENT AND NOT JUST SORTA BITS AND BITS AND PIECES OF OF CONCEPT AND TECHNOLOGY OR OR WHATEVER OR FASHION 
THEN WE SHOULD HAVE TO KIND OF COME BACK TO ONE THING THAT WE KIND OF ALL SORTA CAN VISUALIZE 
UM MAYBE WHAT WE COULD DO IS IT TH THINK ABOUT A CONCEPT WHICH TOUCHES B BACK TO THE ON THE UM THE COLOUR YOU SAID COMPANY COLOUR YELLOW 
I MEAN IF WE THINK OF SOMETHING LIKE I WAS SAYING ALSO LIME AND LEMON YOU KNOW 
WHAT CAN WE COME UP WITH SOMETHING WHERE WE WE TRY AND ASSOCIATE IT WITH WITH LIKE THE USERS 
WE JUST CAME UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE KIND OF US TO USE A THEM TO INSPIRE THE 
SHAPES AND THINGS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO NO NO NOT AT ALL 
IT'S MORE MORE JUST THAT WE WE THINK ABOUT LIKE 
WHAT IT SO WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SO AND THEN WE HAVE NO NO SORTA THEME THAT WE STICK WITH 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
RIGHT SURE 
YEAH 
UM CAN WE YEAH LIKE IT AND WHO LIKE DO YOU HAVE A 
CAN YOU LIKE YEAH JUST TO WE CAN VISUALIZE IT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEP 
MM 
WHAT WOULD TO ACHIEVE 
WELL 
L. C. WELL I'D WHEN YOU SAID TO MENTION THE L. C. D. I'D THINK I WONDER WHAT THAT WOULD BE BUT 
AND THE THE THE THING I COULD USE IT HELPING WITH WOULD BE IF IT WAS SOMEHOW CONNECTED WITH UM LISTINGS 
SO SO YOU SCROLL THROUGH 'CAUSE WE SAID WE MIGHT HAVE A JOG DIAL 
SO SO YOU SCROLL THROUGH YOUR STATIONS YOU CAN YOU TO ACTUALLY TELLS YOU WHAT IT IS 
RIGHT OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM NOT REAL 
MM-HMM 
NO 
MM MM 
WELL I I WAS JUST 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
UM I'VE HAD KINETIC THINGS BEFORE 
AND THE THE THE ONE ISSUE WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND WITH THEM IS THAT YOU'RE COMMITTING THE USER TO MOVING IT AND WATCHES YEAH 
SURE OKAY RIGHT OKAY 
SUPPORT FOR IT 
I MEAN JUST IT'S JUST WORTH POINTING OUT BECAUSE LIKE I'VE I'VE KNOWN I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE TO HAVE KINETIC WATCHES THAT THEY WERE ALL THE TIME 
AND IT'S JUST LIKE MAGIC BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS POWERED AND THERE'S ONE BATTERY 
I'VE ALSO KNOWN PEOPLE TO HAVE THINGS LIKE LIKE A JEWELLERY WATCH THEY WERE FROM TIME TO TIME 
AND THEY EVENTUALLY JUST SAY IT'S JUST TOO MUCH OF A NUISANCE BECAUSE I DON'T WEAR AT ALL THE TIME 
LIKE REMOTE CONTROL IS SIMILAR YOU'RE AWAY IN VACATION I DUNNO WHATEVER YOU SOMETHING AND IT JUST STARTS TO GET WORN DOWN 
SO WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT 
YEAH 
YEP 
AND THIS SIZE HERE I'D SUGGEST THIS BE SMALL LIKE QUITE SMALL 
UM JUST A A LOT OF THE UM 
I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS RUNNING THROUGH MY MIND RIGHT NOW I REALISE WE'RE BEING EFFICIENT TO WRAP UP THE MEETING AND HAVE LOTS OF DECISIONS MADE 
UM BUT WE ARE LEANING QUITE A BIT AT THE SIDE OF BEING LOW TECH RUBBER BUTTONS PLASTIC FRAME 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE'RE REPRODUCING THE SAME OLD REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S IT THERE 
SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING THIS HIGH TECH USER FRIENDLY UH UM THEM LIKE WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE U WE'RE USING IT TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS 
LIKE 
OKAY SO SO BACKLIGHTING THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
YEAH CLEAR THAT'D BE 
OKAY 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH THAT'D BE REALLY GOOD 
YEAH 
SURE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
SURE 
YEAH THEY THEY EMANATE A LIGHT THROUGH IT 
'KAY 
YEAH MM-HMM 
UM AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT WE WE'RE SO WE'VE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO ACHIEVING IS SIMPLICITY 
AND SO I'M THINKING MAYBE SHOULD WE TRY AND THINK ABOUT HAVING SOMETHING LIKE UM SOME KIND OF IN INNOVATIVE CONCEPT ABOUT HOW THE UM THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNELS ARE CONTROLLED 
'CAUSE THAT'S THE MAIN THING PEOPLE WILL F WANNA DO 
COULD WE USE LIKE A JOG DIAL LIKE A NICE JUST SORT OF ROUND SOMEWHERE ON IT WHERE YOU JUST ROLL IT 
OR 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL WHY DON'T WE DO IT LIKE A MOUSE THEN 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
MM 
YEAH 
BUT THAT'S NOT A BAD THING IS IT 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT AT THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO GO PUSH THE BUTTON 
JOG DIALS ARE MUCH EASIER THAN THAT 
YOU JUST ROLL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH LIKE I MEAN IF WE IF IF WE KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS BOARD HERE 
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE COULD TAKE THIS IDEA IMAGINE THAT I DUNNO THAT IT'S WITHIN THE SHAPE OF THE HAND IT'S QUITE SMALL 
I DUNNO 
YEAH 
IT'S SMALL AND THAT WE'VE GOT LIKE THE THE L SLOGAN SOMEWHERE LIKE IN THE CASING AT THE SIDE 
AND THAT YEAH WELL I MEAN ISN'T THAT WHAT WE JUST UH SAID SAID WE USE JUST HAVE TO DECIDE NOW 
YEAH 
AND THEN LIKE A JO 
AND THEN LIKE A JOG DIAL SOMEWHERE THAT FITS IN WITH THE SHAPE OF IT LIKE I DUNNO LIKE HERE IN WITH THE 
IT WOULD GET BUMPED IT'S DOESN'T REALLY FIT WITH YOUR HAND 
YEAH 
OR MAYBE JUST FIT IT IN LIKE DOWN THE MIDDLE HERE 
A JOG DI 
YEAH 
IT'S KIND OF YEAH 
YEAH 
HUH 
UM 
YEAH I THINK THE JOG DIAL YOU KNOW IT JUST AFTER YOU DRAW THAT WHAT IF IT WAS FLAT AND YOU JUST SPUN IT THAT'D BE GREAT 
YEAH 
YEP 
SURE YEAH YEAH AND MATERIALS WE SORTA SAID WE'D DO PLASTIC AND RUBBER DIDN'T WE 
AND I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY AND STAY AWAY FROM JUST THE BIG PROTRUDING RUBBER BUTTONS 'CAUSE THAT'D JUST BE S STANDARD 
SOMETHING A BIT MORE FLUSH YEAH OR MAYBE HAVE RUBBER INCORPORATED INTO THE CASE AS WELL 
SO THAT IT HAS AND ALSO TO PLASTIC I'VE SEEN CAN GET REALLY TEXTURED SO YOU CAN GET PLASTICS THAT ACTUALLY FEEL SOFT IN YOUR HAND 
THEY FEEL KIND OF LIKE UM YOU GET PENS NOW AND THEN THAT YOU'D THINK THAT THEY WERE RUBBER BUT THEY'RE NOT 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY JUST PLASTIC THAT'S TEXTURED KIND OF A LITTLE BIT LIKE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY WE ALL ALL SET 
RIGHT 
WELL THIS IS THE UH FINAL DETAILED DESIGN MEETING 
UM WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND WE'RE GONNA EVALUATE THE PRODUCT 
AND THE END RESULT OF THIS MEETING HAS TO BE A DECISION ON THE DETAILS OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL LIKE ABSOLUTE FINAL DECISION 
UM AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO SPECIFY THE FINAL DESIGN IN THE FINAL REPORT 
SO UM JUST FROM FROM LAST TIME TO RECAP WE SAID WE WERE GONNA HAVE A SNOWMAN SHAPED REMOTE CONTROL WITH AN L. C. D. DISPLAY ON AND FOR TALK BACK 
IT WAS HOPEFULLY GONNA BE KINETIC POWER AND BATTERY UH WITH RUBBER BUTTONS MAYBE BACKLIGHTING THE BUTTONS WITH SOME INTERNAL L. E. D. S TO SHINE THROUGH THE CASING 
UM HOPEFULLY A JOG DIAL AND INCORPORATING THE SLOGAN SOMEWHERE AS WELL 
ANYTHING I'VE MISSED 
OKAY UM SO UH IF YOU WANT TO PRESENT YOUR PROTOTYPE GO AHEAD 
OKAY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
SO W WHAT KIND OF THING UH IS GONNA BE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY COOL 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
COOL 
WHERE ARE WE GONNA HAVE THE SLOGAN 
OKAY COOL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO IF THIS ISN'T IT SCALE WHAT KIND OF 
DIMENSIONS ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT HERE 
MM-HMM 
SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN 
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEN CENTIMETRES 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
SO TEN CENTIMETRES IN HEIGHT 
OKAY UM 
YEAH 
THAT'S GREAT AND IT'S VERY BRIGHT AS WELL 
SO UM OKAY 
OKAY SO JUST COULD YOU JUST LOST ALL THE THINGS THAT IT DOES SO SO I CAN WRITE THEM IN THE REPORT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY SO THAT'S LIKE AN OKAY BUTTON RIGHT 
OKAY 
UH UH LIKE DEPTH OF THE ACTUAL THING 
UH SO THIS K TO GET AN IDEA OF SCALE FROM YOUR FROM YOUR THING THERE OKAY 
SO YOU CAN POWER ON AND OFF WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO 
OKAY 
OKAY JOG DIAL FOR VOLUME 
AND WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO WITH THE JOG DIAL 
CONTRAST BRIGHTNESS YEAH AND ANYTHING ELSE 
WELL IF THE DESIGNERS WHAT ARE THEY 
UH-HUH 
OKAY CHANNEL TUNING 
THAT'S A GOOD ONE 
OKAY AUXILIARY INPUTS 
SHARPNESS 
OKAY WHAT ABOUT UH SOUND SETTINGS 
UH D CAN YOU CHANGE ANY OF THIS AT ALL 
OKAY 
OKAY SO THERE ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL IT CAN DO 
THAT 'CAUSE THAT'S THAT'S FINE 
JUST NEED TO KNOW SO I CAN WRITE IT DOWN 
OKAY UM RIGHT I G I GUESS THAT'S IT SO WE CAN NOW UM 
WE CAN NOW HAVE A LITTLE LOOK AT THE 
THE EXCEL SHEET AND PRICE LISTING AND SO IF WE NEED TO 
UM IF WE NEED TO RETHINK ANYTHING AT ALL 
SO UM FOR THIS FIRST PART HERE POWER WISE HAVE WE GOT BATTERY 
DO WE HAVE KINETIC AS WELL 
NO 
OKAY JUST BATTERY 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF COST RESTRAINTS IS IT 
OKAY UM WHAT ABOUT THE ELECTRONICS HERE 
ADVANCED CHIP 
OKAY UM THE CASE WHAT DOES IT MEAN BY SINGLE AND DOUBLE DO YOU KNOW 
SO WE WANT DOUBLE CURVED 
OKAY 
UM 
SO THERE ANY RUBBER AT ALL IN THE BUTTONS OR ANY 
OKAY UM AND WE WANTED SPECIAL COLOURS DIDN'T WE 
SO I'LL HAVE TO PUT THAT UH NO WAIT W UH HOW MANY COLOURS HAVE WE GOT THREE 
JUST ONE COLOUR OKAY 
OKAY SO INTERFACE WISE IS IT THIS THIRD OPTION WE HAVE THE TWO OF THEM THERE 
OKAY AND THEN BUTTONS WE HAVE WHAT TWO COLOURS 
LIKE UH OH WAIT SO PUSH BUTTON AND INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH OKAY 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
FOUR 
SO W WHY ARE WE ARRIVING AT THE NUMBER FOUR 
WHERE DOES THE NUMBER FOUR COME FROM 
OKAY RIGHT SO WE'RE WRITING DOWN FOR 
OKAY 
HOW ABOUT THIS 
ARE WE WANTING THEM IN ONE THEY'RE JUST AS EVERYTHING GONNA BE PLASTIC 
OKAY 
SO WE'RE W W QUITE FAR OVER 
NOW WE'RE GONNA SOMETHING'S GONNA HAVE TO GO 
UM WE'RE AT SIXTEEN POINT EIGHT AND 
WELL WE UH SOMETHING HAS TO GO TO THE TEN OF TWO POINT OUT THERE ARE 
SO LET ME SEE WHAT ARE WE I MEAN UH YES SORRY FOUR POINT THREE 
MY MATHS IS ALL IT 
YEAH 
HOW MUCH WOULD THAT SAVE US 
NO 
OKAY SO 
SO W WHAT'S OUR REVIEWED SUGGESTION 
UM TAKE AWAY THE L. C. DISPLAY 
TO BE REPLACED WITH A REGULAR CHIP 
OKAY 
AND SO WE'VE GOT POINT THREE TO GET RID OF 
UM AND WE UH WHERE ARE THE FOR THE FOUR PUSH BUTTONS ARE WHERE EXACTLY NOW 
TWELVE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
DO YOU THINK 
LIKE IS IS THAT ONE BIG BUTTON OR IS IT TWELVE BUTTONS HOW CAN TO BE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN 
MM 
OKAY WELL WE HAVE POINT THREE TO GET RID OF SOMEWHERE 
MM 
NO CAN DO 
WELL DO YOU WANT COLOUR DIFFERENTIATION HERE 
OH YEAH SORRY YEAH THEN 
RIGHT SO 
OH 
THAT'S IT 
OKAY ACH THAT'S A SHAME 
UM RIGHT SO TAKE AWAY THAT COMPLETELY 
OH 
AND NOW WE'RE UNDER BUDGET 
SO WE DO HAVE POINT FIVE EURO TO PLAY WITH IF WE WANTED 
UM 
DOESN'T SAY SO 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
JUST ONE 
DOES THAT MEAN THAT ONE BUTTON HAS A SPECIAL FORM OR 
YEAH OKAY 
WELL WELL THERE WE GO 
SO I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO REDRAW THIS NOW 
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE L. C. D. ANYMORE AND WE'LL JUST GONNA HAVE NO NO IT IN THE T. V. IT'LL SHOW YOU WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
WHICH I THINK IS FAIR ENOUGH AND SO THIS IS GONNA BE ONE BIG THING HERE 
UM 
RIGHT OKAY 
SO JUST IT WILL TO BE THOROUGH THEN WIDTH WISE WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT WHAT THREE CENTIMETRES OR SOMETHING 
OKAY AND THEN SO HEIGHT WISE 
HOW HOW TALL DO YOU ENVISAGE IT BEING 
BUT THAT BIG 
BUT TWO CENTIMETRES OKAY 
OKAY 
ACH THAT IS YEAH 
OKAY WE'LL SEE WE'LL SAY TWO POINT FIVE 
OKAY UM SO WE HAVE TO WITHIN COST ANYWAY 
UM SO YEAH PROJECT EVALUATION IS THIS POINT 
UM 
RIGHT UH 
OKAY SO CAN WE CLOSE THAT 
THIS IS WHAT IT'S THE FINAL SPEC THAT IT'S GONNA BE 
SOMEONE IS GONNA HAVE TO YEAH THAT'S FINE THAT'S FINE 
OKAY 
RIGHT UM 
SO AT THIS POINT WE UH LET ME SEE DISCUSS UH HOW SATISFIED WE ALL OR WITH UM 
WITH THESE FOUR POINTS WITH THE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY IN THE PROJECT AND LEADERSHIP AND TEAMWORK AND THE STUFF WE HAD AROUND SO I GUESS 
UM LET ME IS UH 
YEAH I WASN'T REALLY SURE WHAT THAT WAS 
YEAH YEAH GO FOR THAT FIRST 
I WASN'T ENTIRELY SURE WHAT UH WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THAT BUT YOU YOU GO FOR IT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OH THERE TO USE 
MM 'KAY 
OKAY 
WELL YEAH I MEAN COMPARED TO MOST REMOTE CONTROLS YOU SEE THAT'S PRETTY GOOD 
I DUNNO LIKE A SIX OR SOMETHING 
WHAT DOES ANYBODY ELSE THINK 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
I WOULD SAY FIVE OR SIX 
DAVID 
OKAY 
OH YES SORRY THEN THEN I WOULD SAY TWO OR THREE 
YEAH 
WELL IT HAS THE WEE JOG DIAL BUT 
MM 
I'D GO WITH THREE OR FOUR MAYBE THERE 
YEAH BUT THERE OKAY 
WELL THAT'S KIND OF 
BUT THE YELLOW I MEAN IT COULD BE A LEMON YELLOW COLOUR COULDN'T IT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL YEAH I MEAN IT'S REALLY BASIC LOOKING ISN'T IT 
I MEAN I'D GIVE THAT NEARLY A ONE 
FIVE 
THAT'S REALLY LOW 
WELL 
YEAH I SUPPOSE MM 'KAY 
YEP 
GONNA HAVE THAT IN THE SIDE AREN'T WE LIKE THREE OR SOMETHING 
OUT OF FORTY NINE I GUESS 
'S PRETTY GOOD 
OH YEAH 
TWICE THAT ABOUT THIRTY ONE 
SO YEAH B WELL YEAH BUT SIXTY NINE SEVENTY PERCENT YEAH 
IT'S PRETTY GOOD 
OKAY 
NOBODY SAW IT HONESTLY 
SO THAT YOU ALL HAVE ALL FINISHED OR 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
OKAY GREAT UM ARE YOU SUBMITTING THE 
THE UM EVALUATION CRITERIA OR UM I 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR INSTRUCTIONS HAVE BEEN 
OKAY UH JUST WONDERING IF I NEED TO INCLUDE IT IN THE MINUTES BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SUBMITTING IT ANYWAY THEN OKAY GREAT 
COOL 
UM RIGHT UH WELL NEXT UP THEN BECAUSE WE'VE DONE FINANCE IS THE PROJECT EVALUATION 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
RIGHT OKAY 
UM WELL DO YOU WANNA UM JUST INDIVIDUALLY SAY WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ABOUT THESE FOUR POINTS AND OR NOT THOSE FOUR POINTS 
MY FOUR POINTS SORRY FORGOTTEN THAT 
YOU GOT A DIFFERENT UH 
OH YEAH THEY'RE GOOD AREN'T THEY YEAH 
RIGHT OKAY UM YEAH HERE WE ARE 
UH AS A NOTE WE'LL DO THIS 
ALPHABETICALLY 
UM DO YOU WANNA START ANDREW 
I DON'T KNOW JUST UM YOUR OPINION ON THIS FOR THESE FOUR POINTS REALLY AND HOW WE USED THEM 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
WELL D DO YOU FEEL THOUGH THAT THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO HAVE QUITE A LOT OF CREATIVE INPUT INTO THE THING 
BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT MEANS THE ROOM IS IN THIS ROOM 
I THINK IT MEANS LIKE YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
ROOM 
OH YEAH 
WELL I DUNNO DO YOU TH I THINK IT MEANS UM I THINK IT MEANS DID YOU FEEL YOU WERE ABLE TO GIVE CREATIVE INPUT SO 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY UH DO YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY LET'S TAKE EACH POINT AND EVERYBODY DISCUSS IT I THINK 
YEAH 
SO STILL IN THE TOPIC OF ROOM FOR CREATIVITY UH NEXT UP IS CRAIG 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
SO YOU THINK A MORE RELAXED ATMOSPHERE WOULD BE MORE KIND OF CONDUCIVE TO CREATIVE THOUGHT OR 
YEAH BUT ACTUAL ENVIRONMENT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
VERY GOOD 
UM WHAT ABOUT LEADERSHIP 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS LIKE IF I DID A GOOD JOB OR SOMETHING 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW 
FROM LIKE YOUR PERSONAL COACH PERSON AND STUFF LIKE THAT DO YOU THINK MAYBE

YEAH 
OKAY 
MM 
DID HE DID YOU GUYS GET THE EMAIL I SENT YOU 
OH THAT'S ALRIGHT 
I WAS WONDERING IF THAT GOT THREE OKAY 
OKAY UM SO UM TO USE IT TO SUMMARIZE THE TEAMWORK ISSUE SAYING THAT IF WE COULD COMMUNICATE OUTSIDE THE MEETING 
YOU KNOW JUST LIKE QUICK QUESTIONS QUICK THOUGHTS WHATEVER IT PROBABLY WOULD BE ABOUT USER 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT UH ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY ON TEAMWORK AT ALL 
OKAY UM WHAT ABOUT THE YOU KNOW HOW WE SAID THE WHITEBOARD THE DIGITAL PENS THE PROJECTOR STUFF LIKE THAT 
UM DID ANYBODY THINK ANYTHING WAS LIKE REALLY USEFUL ANYTHING WAS PRETTY ONE OF 
UNSUPPORTIVE 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
AND POINT IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
SO DO YOU THINK PRODUCING A PROTOTYPE EARLIER ON THE PROCESS WOULDA BEEN A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WHAT ABOUT THE DIGITAL PENS DID YOU FIND THEM EASY ENOUGH TO USE 
YEAH 
CLUNKY OKAY 
UM 
YEAH 
I KNOW I THINK AT THE VERY START OF TODAY I LIKE WRITE A WHOLE LOAD OF STUFF 
DIDN'T CLICK NOTE ON ONE THEN WENT BACK AND WROTE ONE TINY WEE THING IN THE ANOTHER PAGE 
BUT THEN DID CLICK NOTE AND SO I'M QUITE WORRIED THAT I'VE JUST WRITTEN OVER THE TOP OF IT OR SOMETHING 
BUT THEY'LL HAVE MY PAPER ANYWAY UM AND HAVEN'T DONE THAT SINCE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
DO YOU THINK THE COMPUTERS JUST PROVIDE DISTRACTION IN A MEETING 
OKAY 
I KNOW I I LIKE TO HAVE THINGS WRITTEN DOWN IN FRONT OF UM ACTUALLY 
LIKE A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT WAS EMAILED TO UM I ENDED UP YOU KNOW LIKE WRITING DOWN THERE OR SOMETHING SO I COULD LOOK AT IT REALLY QUICKLY AND NOT HAVE THE DISTRACTION OF ALL OF THAT 
UM I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE 
UM WHAT ELSE UH ANY WH I D I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY SAY NEW IDEAS FOUND 
UM I DON'T KNOW SO COULD YOU THINK OF LIKE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TODAY AT ALL 
MM 
YEAH IF WE JUST HAD UH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I I DUNNO I THINK IT WAS QUITE GOOD THAT WE HAD TIME LIMITS ON THE MEETINGS BECAUSE THEY REALLY COULD HAVE RUN ON AND LIKE MY EXPERIENCE WITH MEETINGS IS THAT THEY REALLY DO 
AND YOU CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE ONLY THING IS THOUGH LIKE WHEN WE HAD OUR MEETING ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
I THOUGHT THERE MAYBE ANOTHER FIFTEEN MINUTES WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL THERE BUT UM YEAH 
I REALLY THE I I THINK MAYBE IF WE'D LIKE ALL BEEN WORKING ON THE ONE ROOM 
AND THEY JUST SAID YOU KNOW LIKE EVERY HOUR OR SOMETHING EVERYBODY MAKE SURE YOU YOU KNOW JUST HAVE A HAVE A SHORT MEETING AND THEN JUST C JUST TO HAVE LIKE SOMETHING WRITTEN DOWN 
JUST LIKE YOU KNOW A A MILESTONE IF YOU LIKE UM RATHER THAN HAVING MEETINGS BUT 
THERE YOU GO 
UM SO IN CLOSING I HAVEN'T GOT MY FIVE MINUTES TO GO 
THEN UH THERE IT I FIVE MINUTES TO GO 
WONDERFUL 
OKAY UM ARE THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET YES THEY ARE 
AND SO THE PROJECT EVALUATED YES IT IS 
SO NOW CELEBRATE 
WELL APPARENTLY NOW I WROTE THE FINAL REPORT 
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING NOW 
YOU DUNNO 
THAT IS LOVELY 
SO SO THAT J IS THAT JUST SO THAT JUST A LOGO OUR IDEAS TO DO ANYTHING 
JUST A LOGO AND THEN LIKE NINJA HOMER RIGHT OKAY 
I THINK IT'S QUITE NICE 
OH NO THAT'S COOL IT'S GOT I'M KIND OF 'EM SLIGHTLY GUTTED THAT WE COULDN'T GET PLASTIC AND RUBBER I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE 
UH WELL MAYBE FROM NOW IN REAL REACTION SHOULD GIVE US MORE MONEY 
PLAY DOH IS 
REALLY 
YEAH 
DID THEY 
OKAY 
PLAY DOH 
YEAH IT SMELLS FUNNY DOESN'T IT 
UM 
YEAH LIKE THE STUFF FOR I THINK IT HAS TO BE YEAH 
YEAH UM SO IT WH WHAT ARE YOUR SUMMARISING WORDS ABOUT PLAY DOH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
TANGIBLE 
OKAY UH 
MM 
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE WE NEEDED TO DISCUSS 
THAT THAT'S ABOUT IT REALLY 
JUST SIT STILL I GUESS FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
UM 
WELL I DUNNO

YEAH YEAH OF THE MEETING'S OVER THEN YEAH I GUESS SO 
NO 
NINJA HOMER MADE IN JAPAN 
AND THERE ISN'T UH DO IT DOESN'T OPEN UP TO THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS 
SO THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS ARE STILL HIDDEN FROM YOU BUT THEY'RE HIDDEN IN THE SENSE THAT UM THEY'RE NOT ONE IS 
UM THEY'RE IN THE L. C. D. PANEL AND THE JOG DIAL 
OKAY 'CAUSE 
THE L. C. D. PANEL JUST DISPLAYS UM FUNCTIONALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
IF YOU'RE USING AN ADVANCED FUNCTION RIGHT LIKE UM C BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST WHATEVER IT WILL JUST SAY YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE IT ONLY HAS FOUR COLUMNS 
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE L. C. D. LIKE WHEREAS MANY THE MINIMUM AMOUNT WE NEED THAT THE USER WILL AUTOMATICALLY KNOW LIKE THIS IS BRIGHTNESS OR THIS IS CONTRAST 
IT MIGHT EVEN BE IN A BIT MORE COMPLEX L. C. D. PANEL WITH PICTURES LIKE MAYBE THE SUN OR THE 
YOU KNOW THE THE SYMBOLS OF THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS 
THAT'S A NUMBER PAD 
UM THEY'RE AL ALONG THOSE YEAH 
YOU HAVE THIS SPACE HERE AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS THING IN THE SIDE AS WELL OR AT THE BOTTOM 
'CAUSE SLOGANS ARE USUALLY QUITE SMALL RIGHT THEY'RE NOT LIKE HUGE SO THEY'RE SO 
SAY A BUTTON'S ABOUT SAY A BUTTON'S ABOUT THIS SIZE RIGHT SO YOU WOULD STILL HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE FOR A SLOGAN SAY EVEN FOR THAT 
YEP IS THAT WOULD BE ABOUT A CENTIMETRE FOR A BUTTON IS ONE TWO THREE 
FOUR CENTIMETRES 
PLUS MAYBE HALF O FIVE 
SIX SEVEN EIGHT BUT YEAH NINE TOTAL 
NINE TEN 
YEP 
EXCUSE ME 
SURE 
OH WE'VE DISCUSSED HOW UH HIGH IT IS ABOUT HOW WIDE IS IT 
ONE IS IN THE HEIGHT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WIDTH 
DO WE NEED FIVE 
I DON'T THINK FIVE IS B BUT THE OTHER AND A HALF 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY THINGS LIKE UM BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST UM MAYBE TUNING THE CHANNELS 
UM 
WHAT ELSE 
UM THE VARIOUS INPUTS 
OR YOU HAVING A V. C. R. OR YOU HAVING YOU KNOW WHICH INPUT DO YOU HAVE 
UM 
YEP COLOUR SHARPNESS 
UM A LOT OF THESE THINGS WILL HAVE TO BE UM FOR AND OPEN FOR USERS TO DEFINE THEM 
DO WE HAVE LIKE YOUR BASIC Y YOUR BASE YOUR MID RANGE YOUR HIGH RANGE 
UM 
YEP LEFT RIGHT BALANCE UM MAYBE EVEN PRE PROGRAMMED SOUND MODES 
LIKE UM THE USER COULD DETERMINE LIKE A SERIES OF SOUND MODES 
AND THEN WHAT COULD HAPPEN WOULD BE UM WHEN YOU CLICK ON THAT THEN IT WOULD GO TO THAT SETTING 
YEAH 
THE BATTERY 
NO 
UM 
WE NEED ONE 
YEP 
YEAH ADVANCED CHIP 
WE NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP I THINK YEP 
LET ME JUST CONFIRM THAT 
YES I THINK SO 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEP 
PLASTIC 
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SKIP THE RUBBER 
UM 
YEP 
FOR THE CASE ITSELF ONE COLOUR 
IT'S ONE SPECIAL COLOUR 
'CAUSE THE CASE UNIT ITSELF THE REST OF OUR COMPONENTS GO ON TOP OF IT 
YES 
ONE AND THE L. C. DISPLAY 
HOW MANY 
WE'VE GOT PUSH BUTTONS AS WELL 
OKAY LET'S JUST BE SAFE AND PUT LIKE SAY FOUR BUTTONS FOR THAT ONE 
OKAY UM AND MAYBE A SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS SO MAYBE FOUR AGAIN 
'CAUSE THAT'S ONE BUTTON BY ITS THE COMPLEXITY OF TWELVE BUTTONS 
SO WE'RE JUST ESTIMATING THAT YEAH IT WOULD BE LESS 
NO 
YEP 
YEP 
HOW MUCH WOULD THAT SAVE US 
THAT WILL ONLY SAVE YOU ONE 
THE OTHER THING COULD BE THAT UM YOU COULD TAKE AWAY THE L. C. D. PANEL AND THE ADVANCED CHIP TOGETHER UM BECAUSE WHEN YOU 
DO SOMETHING ON THE T. V. THE T. V. RESPONDS AND REACTS AS WELL 
SO THE USER COULD BE LOOKING AT THE T. V. AND PUSHING HIS THING SO WE MAY NOT NEED TO USE WHEN WE SCROLL WE NEED JUST SOME WAY TO GET THE T. V. TO RESPOND 
WHICH I THINK IS A TECHNICALLY DOABLE THING IS 
YEP 
AND THE ADVANCED CHIP GOES AWAY AS WELL 
REGULAR CHIP 
YEP 
SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT UM 
THE TWELVE BUTTONS THAT YOU SEE THERE 
FUNCTIONALLY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO INTERCEPT SO FAR AS A GOOD ESTIMATE FOR 
YEAH SO YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY CUT IT'S LIKE THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS FOR EIGHT TWELVE 
IT IT NEEDS TO BE MORE THAN ONE BIG BUTTON BECAUSE IF YOU OPEN UP YOUR PHONE 
UNDERNEATH THERE'S ACTUALLY ONE BUTTON UNDERNEATH IT'S JUST THAT THE PANEL ITSELF IS A SINGLE PANEL 
WE JUST REPORT THAT IT HAS TO BE OVER BUDGET OR THE COLOURS YOU COULD TAKE AWAY S COLOURS FOR THE FOR THE BUTTONS 
NORMAL COLOURED BUTTONS 
NO THAT'S NOT THE BUTTON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
THAT'S THE BUTTONS ONLY REFER TO THE IPOD IS 
SHOULD WE TAKE THAT OFF UH 
HEY IT'S BACK TO THE ORIGINAL 
UM SO THEN THIS JUST BECOME NORMAL COLOURED BUTTONS SO THAT MIGHT BE SOME SOME WAY OF CUTTING THE COST 
YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PROFILE 
NO 
WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PLAY DOH TO MAKE IT THREE D. 
SO THERE'S NO MORE DIMENSION TO THE THING WHICH WE NEED TO TO ADD 
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD IN THE REPORT LENGTH WIDTH AND HEIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TWO 
THIS IS ABOUT THIS IS ABOUT TWO 
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN TWO SO 
OKAY 
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY HARD TO CATCH SO YOU YOU RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WANNA TRY SOMETHING 
THE THE LOOK AND THE COLOUR IS SOMETHING WHICH IS COOL 
BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO THAT FACTOR IF IF IT'S TOO UNFAMILIAR THEN UM BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE SHELF 
YEAH BUTTON SHAPE MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO CHANGE RATHER THAN RATHER THAN POSITIONING 
'CAUSE I THINK POSITIONING IS WE'RE KINDA ENGRAINED INTO THE THE TELEPHONE KIND OF 
PAD 
MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THE DESIGN EVALUATION FIRST 
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED THE POWER SO 
NO THAT'S OKAY THAT'S OKAY 
IN THE POWER CORD ITSELF 
YEAH SO THEN YOU HAVE A BIT MORE FREEDOM TO 
YOU YOU STILL HAVE YOUR BLUE FINGERS 
YOU KILLED A MONSTER 
I RATE THAT PRETTY HIGHLY 
YEP I'M FINE WITH THAT 
IT'S ONE TO SEVEN RIGHT 
WAIT WHAT'S THE SCALE ONE TO SEVEN RIGHT 
OKAY IT'S UPSIDE DOWN 
SAY IT'S MORE 
MEDIUM BUT GOING TOWARDS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN MEDIUM KIND OF THING 
YEP 
LEMON 
OKAY THE BLUE THE BLUE COLOURS AND DON'T RE DON'T ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE COLOUR 
EXCEPT FOR THE B THE THE RED BUTTON THEY BECAUSE FOR WANT OF A 
YEAH THE THE YELLOW IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COLOUR BUT THE BUTTON ITSELF THE BLUE CAN BE ANYTHING ELSE 
YEP THAT'S FINE 
YEAH COMPANY LOGO 
I THINK IT'LL BE COST PROHIBITIVE YEAH 
YEP 
THE CAMERAS DID 
YEP 
IT KEEPS GETTING TOO BIG 
'KAY I'M I'M LISTENING I'M JUST TRYING TO INCORPORATE THE LOGO INTO THE THE THING SO I'M PLAYING WITH THE PLAY DOH AS WELL 
JUST IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING WHY IS UH STILL PLAYING WITH THE PLAY DOH 
JUST ABOUT RIGHT L. E. G. O. LEGO 
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE CAGED WITHIN WHATEVER YOU IT'S LIKE A BALLOON IN A CAGE IT CAN ONLY GO AS BIG AND NOT HIT THE SIDE 
THE CONSTRAINTS DO COME IN VERY FAST 
YEAH 
I THINK ANOTHER POINT IS THAT THE MEETINGS UM ARE MORE BRAINSTORMING SESSIONS THAN MEETINGS AS TIME IS ALSO A VERY SO UM STRONG FACTOR AND STRUCTURE 
BECAUSE FOR A BRAINSTORMING MEETING YOU WANT A STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS YOU IT ALLOWS IDEAS TO GET TOSSED 
UM TO BE EVALUATED AND TO BE REVIEWED AND TO GET FEEDBACK AND COME BACK 
AND I GUESS THAT POINT ABOUT THE ROOM NOT BEING ARE VERY FRIENDLY TO THAT I THINK THAT'S A VERY BIG THING 
AND I THINK THE FACT THAT WE'RE WEARING THESE THINGS RESTRICTS I FEEL IT 'CAUSE I WEAR M MY GLASSES 
RIGHT AND THAT BUT THAT IRRITATES ME RIGHT IT IT IT DOES ACTUALLY YOU KNOW AFFECT HOW W WHETHER YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE TO COMMUNICATE 
I FEEL LIKE I'M HIDING BEHIND THE EQUIPMENT RATHER THAN THE EQUIPMENT IS HELPING ME AND YOU KNOW 
NOT NOT AS MUCH AN ATMOSPHERE THE ATMOSPHERE IS VERY RELAXED 
BUT THE THE GEAR YEAH YOU KNOW THAT CREATES BOUNDARIES TO THAT UM AND AND THE TIME THE TIME GIVEN ALSO RESTRICTS 
EXCUSE ME 
I THINK CONTROLLING IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD I THINK THE INTERACTIONS ARE VERY STRUCTURED 
I THINK STRUCTURE IS PROBABLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL IS STRUCTURED TO ONE PARTICULAR TASK AND ONE PARTI RATHER THAN CONTROLLING 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A SENSE OF CONTROL 'CAUSE ALL THE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN TERMS OF A 
LIKE A CONSENSUS RIGHT WE GO ROUND AND WE THINK ABOUT IT 
BUT THAT YOU KNOW PROCESS ACTUALLY SAYS YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN A CERTAIN WAY 
IT DOESN'T TELL YOU YOU KNOW SOME WAYS THAT YOU MIGHT WANNA BE A BIT MORE CREATIVE IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS YOU KNOW NOT THE 
I THINK YOU TRIED TO USE THE COMMON SHARE FOLDER TO TO TO TO COMMUNICATE 
BUT UM IT JUST COMES BACK TO S S SLOW IN THE EMAIL ME TO IT DOESN'T HAVE A YOU KNOW A MESSENGER WILL GO 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I THINK THE TOOLS THAT THEY WERE GIVEN THE TOOL SET THAT WERE GIVEN TO USE OUR FANCY BUT THEY DON'T SUPPORT COLLABORATION I THINK THAT'S THE WORD 
THEY DON'T SUPPORT THE TEAM WORKING TOGETHER YOU KNOW THEY'RE STILL VERY INDIVIDUAL TOOLS 
WE HAD PLAY DOH FUN 
NO NOT REALLY 
I THINK UM THE THE FOCUS OF IT A LOT WAS THE POWERPOINT AS OPPOSED TO THE AT THE WHITEBOARD 
AND I THINK THAT UM UM IS ALSO DOES YOU KNOW HINDER US AND THINGS I THINK 
IT WILL BE CLEAR TO HAVE THE WHITEBOARD RATHER THAN THE THE POWERPOINT 
OR MAYBE THE WHITEBOARD AND THE POWERPOINT IN THE SAME PLACE YOU KNOW IN THE CENTRE OF THE 
I THINK THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY POWERPOINTS IN THE MEETINGS 
'CAUSE THE PLUG IN AND THE PLUGGING SPENT WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DOING THAT 
AND A LOT OF THE INFORMATION ON THE POWERPOINTS I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW WE NEEDED TO ACTUALLY IT COULD HAVE 
WE COULD HAVE GONE THROUGH IT VERBALLY ESPECIALLY MY SLIDES I FELT THAT THEY JUST YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO PRESENT THEM 
YEP CLUNKY 
AGREED 
HAVING TO TICK IT BEFORE YOU GO OFF WAS A BIT HINDERING AS WELL 
'CAUSE YOU'RE HALF WAY THROUGH A THOUGHT AND THEN YOU RUN OUT OF PAPER AND THEN YOU HAVE TO JUMP 
BUT I THINK THE PEN IS V IS VERY INTUITIVE EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO USE IT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY 
SO I THINK THE PEN'S GOOD 
IT'S ABOUT THE BEST THING 
YEAH WE ONLY NEEDED ONE COMPUTER AND 
AND THE COMPUTER MAY NOT UM BE CONDUCIVE TO A MEETING BECAUSE UM YOU TEND TO LOOK AT YOUR COMPUTER AND WANNA HAVE THE URGE TO CHECK SOMETHING 
YOU KNOW IT'S USEFUL BUT 
I THINK TOO MANY COMPUTERS ARE JUST DISTRACTING 
UM 
YEP 
AND WE HAVE NINJA HOMER 
NINJA HOMER 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE HOMER SIMPSON 
BUT IT'S ELECTRONIC SO IT'S MADE IN JAPAN 
YEAH IT'S JUST A LOGO 
NINJA HOMER 
THE THE RED IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT THE WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANNA PRINT ON THE SIDE OF IT 
YOU CAN WEAR HOMER YOU CAN THROW HOMER WHEN YOU'RE FRUSTRATED DOH 
IT'S CLUNKY 
UH I DID LEARN SOMETHING NEW PLAY DOH IS USEFUL 
NO IT IS IT IS 
IT IS USEFUL AND NO NO NO NO NO NO NO UM CONCEPTUALIZING IN BEING CREATIVE 
'CAUSE LIKE YOU SAY IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN PUT YOUR HANDS ON AND FEEL AND TOUCH AND GET A SENSE FOR 
LIKE WE WERE PLAYING WITH THE PLAY DOH AND THE IDEAS CAME WITH THE PLAY DOH RATHER THAN WITH EVERYTHING ELSE 
YOU MIGHT WANNA WRITE THAT DOWN 
IT'S JUST I'M JUST FIDDLING WITH THE PLAY DOH AND I'M GOING YEAH YEAH IT'S KINDA COOL 
IN ALL PLAY DOH IS EDIBLE 
IT'S JUST WHAT IT'S THE STUFF THAT YOUR MOM COULD MAKE WITH PRESERVATIVES AND UH 
IT'S HELPFUL TO THE CREATIVE PROCESS 
UM IT ENGAGES ALL YOUR SENSES NOT JUST YOUR SIGHT BUT YOUR SENSE OF FEEL YOUR SENSE OF TOUCH 
AND IT HELPS YOU TO UNDERSTAND 
DIMENSION AS WELL 
I THINK THAT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT IT STARTS TO POP UP WHEREAS IN A PIECE OF PAPER ON A COMPUTER IN A BIRD 
UM EVEN WITH A THREE D. GRAPHIC THING IT STILL IT REQUIRES A LOT OF YEAH TANGIBLE THAT'S A NICE WORD 
IT BECOMES TANGIBLE 
NOPE 
I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY DO IT HERE AS LONG AS WE DON'T COLLABORATE 
CAN WE TURN OFF THE MICROPHONES 
UH UH 
THIS IS IT 
UM THERE ARE A FEW CHANGES WE'VE MADE 
UM WELL LOOK AT THE EXPENSE SHEET 
AND UH IT TURNED TO BE QUITE A LOT EXPENSIVE TO HAVE OPEN UP AND HAVE LOTS OF BUTTONS AND STUFF INSIDE 
SO INSTEAD WE'VE UM THIS IS GONNA BE AN L. C. D. SCREEN UM JUST A A VERY VERY BASIC ONE 
VERY SMALL UM WITH ACCESS TO THE MENU THROUGH THE THE SCROLL WHEEL AND UH CONFIRM 
UM BUTTON 
UH APART FROM THAT IT'S JUST PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS WE DISCUSSED LAST TIME 
YOU KNOW JUST LIKE RIGHT INSIDE THERE 
WELL WE WANT THE OTHER BUTTONS TO BE BIG ENOUGH TO PUSH EASILY WITH A FINGER SO WE RECKON MAYBE THAT'LL BE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE IS THE PALM OF YOUR HAND 
WELL I'M 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE AGAIN THE THE SORT OF THE FOGGY UM YELLOW FROM LAST TIME THAT LIT UP WHEN YOU PUSHED THE BUTTON 
UM 
BUT UM THIS BUTTON UM BECAUSE IT'S RED IT'S SORT OF VERY PROMINENT 
WE'RE GONNA USE IT IS UH IT CAN BE THE POWER BUTTON IF YOU HOLD IT FOR MAYBE TWO SECONDS IT'LL SEND A STAND BY SIGNAL 
UM APART FROM THAT IT'S GONNA BE USED AS A CONFIRM BUTTON FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND YOU USE THIS IS A JOG DIAL 
I DON'T KNOW 
DIDN'T PUT FIVE CENTIMETRES 
UM 
SOMETHING BY THREE 
UM YOU CAN SKIP STRAIGHT TO A CHANNEL USING THESE BUTTONS 
UM WERE GONNA HAVE THE VOLUME CONTROL HERE 
BUT UM BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE THE L. C. D. AND THE JOG DIAL WE JUST THOUGHT WE'D UM SO THAT IS THE VOLUME 
UM YOU CAN USE IT FOR ME MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS LIKE CONTRAST COLOUR AND 
UM YEAH 
UM JUST WHATEVER ELSE WE WANTED TO INCLUDE IS THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS UM WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY GO THROUGH AND SPECIFY THE 
UH WHAT CAN A T. V. DO 
UM 
THE THE BALANCE HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UM I THINK SINGLE WOULD JUST BE SORT OF ONE SORT OF OVAL WHEREAS DOUBLE IS THIS SORT OF THING 
UM WE HAVE UM GOT SOME PUSH BUTTONS AS WELL 
'KAY 
SO I RECKON WE'VE GOT ONE BUTTON FOR THIS THING 'CAUSE IT'S JUST ONE BIG SHEET OF RUBBER 
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT COUNTS BUT 
YOU CAN SEE WE'RE WE'RE ALL VERY FAR BEYOND THE 
WELL WE COULD TAKE OUT ONES BY MAKING IT SINGLE CURVED JUST FILL IN THESE BITS 
THAT IS NO 
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH YEAH 
THAT'S UM ONE PIECE OF RUBBER BUT IT'S GONNA HAVE TWELVE BUTTON THINGS UNDERNEATH SO 
YEAH WE 
UM 
SO I RECKON 
RECKON THAT PROBABLY COUNTS AS A SPECIAL FORM FOR THE BUTTONS 
I THINK THERE'S JUST ONE BUTTON IS HANDY 
YEAH 
YOU SEE I ENVISION IT IS BEING UM QUITE DEEP SORT OF DEEP ENOUGH TO BE COMFY TO HOLD ON YOUR HANDS RATHER THAN BEING WIDE AND FLAT 
YEAH IT WORKS YEAH 
SO BUT THAT THICK 
YEAH 
SO IT 
YEAH 
I'M SEEING FIVE THEN 
ONE'S HIGH ISH ISN'T IT 
OH OKAY SO YEAH TWO OR THREE 
EIGHT THREE 
YEAH 
YEAH NO 
YEAH I THINK IT'S ABOUT FIVE 
YEAH WELL WE HAVE TO USE UH PLASTIC IS IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE 
I THINK I'D PROBABLY INCREASE THE COST 
WE'VE ONLY GOT LIKE WHAT TEN CENTS LEFT SO 
YEAH 
MY LEG 
UM I AGREE WITH HIS POINT IT'S UM IT IS QUITE A LOT OF FUN TO TO GO AND THEN YOU HAVE SORT OF HIT THE AND THEN GO RIGHT 
GOTTA CUT EVERYTHING OUT 'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY 
UH RECKON THAT WAS A BIT HARD BECAUSE WE COULD ONLY DISCUSS THINGS IN THE MEETING 
IF WE COULD JUST GO UP TO SOMEBODY OUTSIDE THE MEETING AND HAVE A QUICK TALK WITH THEM THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A LOT EASIER 
NOT JUST YET 
YEAH 
UH THEY'RE A BIT CLUNKY 
GOOD POINT 
YEAH 
SO THIS FOR THE PROJECT OR 
OH YEAH 
DO WE KNOW WHAT THE OTHER ONES ARE 
OH WOW 
HEY YEAH I SAID NINJA HOMER 
GUESS I'D FORGOT HOW GOOD IS PLAY DOH SMELLS 
I THINK THEY'RE ALL NON TOXIC 'CAUSE IT'S MADE FOR LIKE TWO YEAR OLDS 
YEAH IT'S NOT VERY TANGIBLE 
MM 'KAY 
WHERE ARE THEY 
OH RIGHT 
GREAT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 'KAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM AND WHAT IS THIS HERE 
OKAY SO THE NUMBER PAD SO 'KAY GREAT 
MM 
YEP 
LOOKS GOOD 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
BUT NON IN TOTAL 
THAT SOUNDS GOOD 
YEAH 
YEP 
THAT'D BE GOOD IN FACT A PEN IS ABOUT TEN CENTIMETRES USUALLY 
SO THAT WOULD BE THAT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GOOD SIZE OF YOU USE IT THERE 
MM 
SO IT POSSIBLE UH I'M JUST GONNA BRING UP THE IDEA OF COLOURS 
SO THESE ARE THESE THE COLOURS THAT OF PRODUCTION OR IS THIS JUST WHAT WE HAD AVAILABLE 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
HOW HIGH IS IT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SURE 
THERE AND A HALF 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM PROBABLY COLOUR OR SHARPNESS 
MM-HMM 
DO 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
MM 
OR EVEN CLEAR 
UH HOW MM-HMM HOW ARE WE GOING TO ACHIEVE THIS HIGH END PRODUCT OF 
WE ONLY HAVE VERY SPARSE 
TWO POINT THREE 
FOUR POINT THREE NO 
AND THEN WHERE IS THE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WE COULD JUST GO WITH UM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
HOW ABOUT WITH EMBOSSING THE LOGO ISN'T THAT GOING TO COST US SOME MONEY 
YEAH 
THAT'S A FREEBIE 
WAS THE GOAL IN YOUR IN YOUR PROTOTYPE DESIGN THAT TO BE AS LOW PROFILE AS POSSIBLE 
SORT OF FLAT AS POSSIBLE 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING TO SURE OKAY 
YEAH ALRIGHT YEAH FAIR ENOUGH 
OKAY JUST THOUGHT I'D ASK 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
TWO'S NOT VERY HIGH AT ALL THOUGH 
MAYBE A BIT HIGHER 
YEAH 
MAYBE CLOSER TO OTHER EVEN OR TWO AND A HALF 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM IT'S PROBABLY JUST I DUNNO IF IT'S WORTH GETTING INTO 
BUT UM JUST IN IN THAT WE WANT THIS TO BE STYLISH SHOULD WE THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF THE BOX IN TERMS OF A BUTTON GRID 
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THERE'S LOTS OF DEVICES OUT THERE THAT THAT INSTEAD OF TAKING YOUR STANDARD NINE NINE SQUARE GRID 
AND THEY HAVE TO SORT OF STYLIZED OR IN DIFFERENT CONCEPT THAT THAT 
YEAH 
SURE OKAY 
YEAH ALRIGHT 
OKAY SURE 
WHAT ABOUT BUTTON SHAPE 
SQUARE BUTTONS 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SURE 
YEAH 
MM 'KAY 
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO UM 
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO MY UM DESIGN EVALUATION LAST 
OR 
EVALUATION 
OKAY 
SURE 
UM ALRIGHT SO THE WAY THIS WORKS I'M GONNA NEED TO PLUG INTO POWERPOINT I'LL TRY AND DO IT AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE 
UM THIS IS UM I'LL JUST GO OVER YOUR HEAD IF THAT'S OKAY 
WHAT'S THAT 
I DON'T NEED THE POWERPOINT 
OH COURSE YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
LET ME GET THAT 
A BIT MORE 
OKAY SO WHAT THIS IS IS A SET UP FOR US TO UM UH AS A KIND OF A LIKE A 
THE IDEA IS THAT I'VE SET UP I'VE REVIEWED ALL OF THE UM THE POINTS OF DISCUSSION FROM THE BEGINNING 
AND SAID THAT IS A CRITERIA OF EVALUATION FOR THE UM UH FOR THE CURRENT DESIGN UH THE OR THE PLAN AND UH SO WE CAN REVIEW THAT 
UH I THINK IT'S GONNA END UP BEING SORT OF ELEMENTARY BECAUSE WE'RE SORT WE'RE N NO WE'RE NOT GONNA PROBABLY IS IT TO CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT 
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S GOING DOES IT 
YEAH OKAY GREAT 
UH AND I'M GONNA WRITE UP OUR RESULTS ON THE BOARD 
SO THIS'LL BE A WAY FOR US TO GO THROUGH AND DECIDE IF WE'RE UM SORT OF REVIEW WHERE WE STAND WITH IT 
OKAY SO UM 
SO IT SORT OF B BRING TOGETHER TWO THINGS SORT OF DESIGN GOALS AND ALSO THE MARKET RESEARCH THAT WE HAD UH WHEN WE RATE THIS 
ONE IS V HIGH IN IN SUCCEEDING OR FITTING TO OUR ORIGINAL UM AND SEVEN IS LOW OKAY 
SO THIS I THIS I TH ARE THE AND UM WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO UH TO COLLECTIVELY RATE THIS 
SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS TRY AND JUST YOU WORK ON A CONSENSUS SYSTEM SO 
WE JUST CAME OUT IN AGREEMENT 
OKAY 
SO THE FIRST ONE UH STYLISH LOOK AND FEEL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH M M UH MY ONLY RESERVATION WITH IT WAS THAT WE BASICALLY WENT WITH YELLOW BECAUSE IT'S THE COMPANY'S COLOUR 
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YELLOW'S GONNA REALLY BE A HOT 
BUT 
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK 
OKAY 
OKAY LET'S GO WITH FIVE THEN 
IF HE HE JUST ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE 
THE USE IT MEANT THREE OKAY 
YEAH ONE IS HIGH 
'KAY 
LET'S GO WITH TWO POINT FIVE THEN 
OKAY UM CONTROL HIGH TECH INNOVATION 
WE HAD TO REMOVE 
YEAH SO WE'VE HAD TO REMOVE A FEW OF OUR FEATURES WE WANTED BUT JOG DIAL 
'S GOOD 
OKAY THERE 
OKAY UM 
STYLE REFLECTS A FRUIT INSPIRED COLOUR DESIGN 
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID COLOUR BUT JUST 
SORT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
YEAH COULD BE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY SO WE'LL GO TWO 
YEAH 
OKAY AND UM DESIGN AS SIMPLE TO USE SIMPLE ONE FEATURES 
IF IF YEAH F FAIRLY BASIC YOU GUYS THINK 
YEAH NO 
OKAY 
UM SOFT AND SPONGY HAVE WE ACHIEVED THAT 
WE'VE USED MOSTLY PLASTIC IN THE END SO IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A BIT OF A COMPROMISE FOR PRICE 
FIVE 
THAT'S 
UM 
COULD WE HAVE USED AN ENTIRELY RUBBER FROM IT IT 
WAS THAT ONE OPTION 
IT WOULD COST MORE THAN PLASTIC 
OKAY LOGO WE'VE GOT IT IN THERE HAVEN'T WE 
HUH 
AND UM IT'S WITHIN BUDGET YEP 
IT IS ISN'T IT 
OKAY SO WE CAN SAY THEN THAT UH OUT OF A POSSIBLE OR WHAT WOULD BE OUR GOAL HERE 
YEAH OUT OF FORTY NINE WITH WITH ZERO BEING THE HIGHEST 
WE ARE TO UH TWO SEVEN EIGHT TEN FIFTEEN POINT FIVE 
SO IT'S PRETTY GOOD 
TRANSLATES TO SOMETHING LIKE ABOUT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY TWO PERCENT EFFICACY 
OF OUR ORIGINAL GOAL 
RIGHT 
I THINK 'CAUSE IF YOU TURN THAT NOT 
A HUNDRED 
IT WOULD BE BUT 
BUT THIRTY ONE AND THEN INVERT THAT IT'S 
OH RIGHT ABOUT SEVENTY YEAH SEVENTY PERCENT 
OKAY GOOD 
THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE FORMALITY FOR US TO GO THROUGH 
YEP UH HUNDRED POUND PEN 
SORRY ALRIGHT 
NO 
HMM 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S ME 
I DID HAVE ONE OTHER UM IN THERE FROM I THOUGHT I MEAN I I DO NOT KNOWING HOW WE WOULD DEAL WITH THIS INFORMATION 
I THOUGHT KEY IN THEORY THIS KIND OF A PROCESS WOULD BE ABOUT REFINING OUR DESIGN REVISITING OUR ORIGINAL GOALS 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I NEED TO PU PUSH THROUGH BUT I THOUGHT SHOULD WE THINKING MORE ABOUT THE DIMENSIONS 
UM SORT OF LIKE MORE OF A THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPES AS WELL AS OPPOSED TO JUST THAT FLAT UM 
COULD OUR DESIGN INVOLVE A SERIES OF COLOURS SO THAT IT'S MORE OF LIKE A LINE WHERE WE HAVE LIKE SORT OF THE 
I DON'T KNOW LIKE THE HARVEST LINE OR THE VIBRANT 
I DUNNO THE WHATEVER JUST SOME THEM AND THEN WE HAVE DIFFERENT TONES LIME GREEN LEMON 
IT'S JUST DISCUSSION 
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE CAN JUST ABANDON THIS IT'S FINE 
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE ORIGINALLY SET IT TO DO 
UM YEP IS THERE 
THAT'S ALL 
UM I THINK TO RECORD IT AND UH I HAVEN'T BEEN ASKED TO SUBMIT IT YET 
YEAH 
I WILL YEAH 
HUH 
YEP 
I LIKE THOSE PRINTER CABLES THAT JUST HAVE THE TWO LITTLE BUTTERFLY CLIPS LIKE THAT 
IT'S REALLY QUICK 
IT IS 
SURE UM SO WHAT IS IT YOU'RE ASKING OF UM NOW 
OR SORT OF OUR WORK ON SETTING THIS UP 
YEAH 
WELL SO IT UH OKAY I'LL JUST GO THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM THEN 
THE THE REM UH 
IS FAIRLY INSTITUTIONAL BUT UM THE MAIN THING SO I THINK 
UM OR SO IF THIS SPACE IS MORE JUST TO REPORT ON THINGS AS OPPOSED TO BE CREATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE AND IT WOULD PROBABLY HELP TO UM HAVE LO SORT OF A CUMULATIVE EFFECT IF WE HAVE IDEAS AND WE COME BACK AND THEN THE IDEAS ARE STILL IN DISCUSSION 
YOU KNOW AS ONE OTHER WORDS THIS THIS ROOM IS SORT OF A CENTRE POINT OF CREATIVITY 
WHEREAS IN REALITY AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS IT'S NOT REALLY THE CENTRE POINT OF CREATIVITY IT'S MORE JUST A 
D DEBATING 
YEAH YEAH BUT THAT'S JUST THE THING IS THE QUEST IN TERMS OF THE THE FIRST POINT THREE THE ROOM 
IT FEELS AS THOUGH THE CREATIVITY GOES ON WHEN WE LEAVE 
AND THEN WE COME HERE AND THEN WE KIND OF PUT IT OR IDEAS AND THEN YOU KNOW 
OH OH RIGHT RIGHT OH RIGHT OKAY ROOM FOR CREATIV OH RIGHT I JUST LOOKED UP AND SAW OKAY WHITEBOARD DIGITAL PENS THE ROOM 
ONE OF COURSE YEAH 
SORRY 
HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH I THE KEY IN THE UM YEAH DIF ANSWERING THE QUESTION UH IN THOSE TERMS I'D SAY THAT ACTUALLY THERE'S SORT OF A TEASE OF CREATIVITY BECAUSE WE'RE ASKED TO WORK THROUGH THIS 
BUT ACTUALLY THE GUIDELINES ARE FAIRLY CONTRIVED IN TERMS OF UM OKAY FASHION TRENDS 
SAY FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COLOUR SCHEME BUT THEN I THEN WE'RE TOLD OKAY SO THE CO COMPANY COMPANY COLOURS 
SO WHAT DO WE DO 
WE'RE TOLD OKAY UM THINK IN TERMS OF STYLE AND LOOK AND FEEL AND TECHNOLOGY BUT BUILD SOMETHING FOR TWELVE AND A HALF POUNDS 
SO ACTUALLY THE CREATIVITY WAS MORE MORE OF LIKE A UM A F SORT OF A F FORMALITY THEN AN ACTUAL 
YEAH WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS THE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH 
NEW CREATIVITY 
YEP 
RIGHT 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WELL WELL I MEAN MY SENSE IN THAT IS SORT OF WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION ENCOURAGEMENT 
YEAH FROM AND YOU AS WELL I THINK JUST SORT OF ACTING AS TEAM LEADER 
UM YEAH I THINK I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S GOOD 
I MEAN MY PERSONAL VIEWS ON ON LEADERSHIP IS THAT EFFECTIVE EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP SORT OF UM GIVES PEOPLE A CERTAIN ROOM FOR FREEDOM AND DELEGATION 
BUT THEN TO COME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT THEY TAKE GREAT OWNERSHIP AND 
YOU KNOW INNOVATIVE THOUGHT WITH 
IN IN REALITY I THINK HERE THE THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF LEADERSHIP SUCH AS THE THE ORIGINAL B BRIEFING AND THEN THE PERSONAL COACH AND THE AND THEN YOU KNOW HAVING HAVING YOU WITH YOUR THE MEETING AGENDA IS ACTUALLY QUITE A QUITE A QUITE A CON CONFINING FRAMEWORK TO WORK WITHIN 
AND SO IT IS LEADERSHIP ALMOST AT THE POINT OF SORT OF DISEMPOWERING THE THE THE TEAM MEMBER SO 
BUT IT'S NOT BAD LEADERSHIP IT'S JUST SORT OF IS FAIRLY STRONG YOU KNOW 
IT TURNS IT TURNS THE INDIVIDUAL INTO MORE OF LIKE A UM SORT OF A PREDETERMINED MECHANISM AS OPPOSED TO A SORT OF A FOUR 
YEAH UH YEAH WITHOUT WITHOUT A DOUBT 
YEAH MAYBE NOT CO CONFINING 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UM DID YOU WANNA COMMENT CRAIG 
YEAH 
YEAH 
FULLY AGREE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH GOT THE EMAIL 
YEAH 
YEAH ON IT 
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM EXACTLY 
YEAH I MEAN IF YOU 
YEAH I MEAN SORT OF TAKING UPON THAT IDEA 
W THE WAY I SEE THIS I SEE THAT IT'S UH THE THE USE THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH WE'VE WE'VE APPROACHED THIS WHOLE TASK IS QUITE CONTRARY TO THE P PRINCIPLE OF TEAMWORK BECAUSE THE THE TASKS WERE D D SORT OF UM DIVIDED 
AND THEN THE WORK WENT IN IN ISOLATION I I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS DID WHILE YOU WERE TOGETHER MAYBE THAT WAS A BIT DIFFERENT 
BUT UM YEAH BUT UM BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU IF YOU IMAGINE ENTI ENTIRE THE COMPLETELY SAME TASK GIVEN TO USE BUT IS USED OKAY 
FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS COME UP WITH UM LET'S SAY UM A DESIGN CONCEPT 
AND WE SIT HERE TOGETHER AND DO IT WELL THAT'S WHAT TEAMWORK IS 
IT IS TO SAY OKAY GO OFF AND DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER IT'S ACTUALLY P SORT OF PREDISPOSES YOU IT QUITE THE CONTRARY OF TEAMWORK 
UM NOT THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE I THINK THE BEST WE COULD HAVE DONE 
I'M NOT DISSATISFIED WITH IT 
MM-HMM 
I THINK THE WHITEBOARD FOR ME IS THE KIND OF THING I WOULD USE ALL THE TIME 
BUT IT'S UM NOT QUITE IS USEFUL AS IT IS IS IT COULD HAVE BEEN MAYBE JUST IN THE WAY THAT WE WE USE IT 
IN THE SENSE THAT ONCE WE HAVE AN IDEA OUT THERE ARE WHILE WORK WAS GOING IN IN BETWEEN MEETINGS 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN UP IN A BOARD UH YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO IN LIKE IN TEXT 
UM AND THEN WE COULD THEN KEEP OUR IDEAS SORT OF BUILDING IN THAT 
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO DESIGN CARS AND YOU KNOW IN AVIATION THEY QUITE OFTEN JUST HAVE A SIMPLE LIKE FIBREGLASS PROTOTYPE AND IT'S COMPLETELY YOU KNOW UM ABS ABSTRACT FROM THE FINAL PRODUCT 
BUT THEY USE IT IS A KIND OF A CONTEXT TO SORT OF WALK AROUND AND PUZZLE AND END POINT AND DISCUSS AND AND AND IN A WAY EVERYBODY'S AS WE DISCUSS THINGS IN THE IN THEORETICALLY AND OUT OF OUR NOTEBOOKS 
WE'RE JUST WE'RE ACTUALLY JUST EACH OF US DISCUSSING SOMETHING THAT'S IN EACH OF OUR OWN MINDS 
IT WASN'T UNTIL WE HAD THIS HERE YOU KNOW 
LOOK AT ONE POINT I PEEKED ACROSS AND LOOKED AT CRAIG'S PAPER AND I'M LIKE NOW I KNOW WHAT HE'S THINKING 'CAUSE I SAW HIS BOOK 
BUT THE B THE B WHITEBOARD COULD'VE ACTUALLY BEEN THIS KIND OF CONTINUING UM 
THINK COULD BE YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE THE POWERPOINT WAS PROVIDED TO USE WHILE WE HAD TIME TO PREPARE WHEREAS I CAN IMAGINE IF I'D BEEN ENCOURAGED TO USE PAINTBRUSH 
FOR EXAMPLE OR WHATEVER I WOULD'VE ACTUALLY USED TO UM 'CA YOU KNOW 
JUST 'CAUSE THAT'S SORTA HOW W WHAT WE WERE SET UP TO TO USE WHILE WE HAD OUR TIME 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
NO NOT QUITE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SURE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
AND O ON THE TOPIC OF THE TECHNOLOGY 
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T NEED TO MOVE OUR COMPUTERS BECAUSE EACH COMPUTER HAS ALL OF THE FILES 
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT THEY ALL 
WE ONLY ACTUALLY NEEDED ONE COMPUTER 
IF THERE HAD BEEN A FIFTH THAT COULD JUST BEEN SITTING THERE READY TO GO THE WHOLE TIME 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL THE W MAIN ONE FOR ME IS THAT UH THE PROCESS 
IN IN A NATURAL F CONTEXT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED BY THIS NECESSITY TO DISCOMMUNICATE OURSELVES FROM EACH OTHER 
SO THAT'S KIND OF A NEW IDEA FOR ME IS LIKE JUST SORT OF THAT IDEA 
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF IS HARD TO KEEP OF WORKING FORWARD ON A TEAM A TEAM BASED PROJECT WHEN WHEN YOU'RE TOLD YOU MUST NOW WORK AWAY FROM YOUR TIME 
OH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
GREAT 
SO IT 
SO NOW WE 
I I DON'T KNOW 
HMM 
WHAT DID YOU CALL IT 
HUH-HUH 
LOGO 
HUH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
FASHION TECHNOLOGY OR SOMETHING 
HMM-HMM HMM 
HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
HUH 
HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO IT'S TRUE YEAH 
HMM 
AND SOME PLAY DOHS ARE ACTUALLY I THINK EDIBLE AREN'T THEY 
WOW HMM 
HUH 
YEP 
TEST 
YEAH 
MM-HMM YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
DO WE RETREAT TO RE TO CONTINUE OUR 
R REPORTING OR WHAT I 
OKAY WELL I THINK WE'RE READY TO BEGIN 
RIGHT MY NAME'S ADAM DUGUID WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF REAL REACTION UM WE HAVE ON THE GROUP 
UM YEAH GO FOR TO MEET 
N. E. Z. 
EBENEZER 
AND YOUR ROLE IS 
YOU'RE THE MARKETING EXPERT OKAY 
NEXT WE HAVE 
T. R. U. K. 
AND YOUR ROLE IN THIS IS 
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
AND LASTLY WE HAVE 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE USER INTERFACE IS IT 
DESIGNER 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
THIS IS THE AGENDA FOR TODAY'S MEETING 
SO YOU CAN SEE W OPENING ACQUAINTANCE TOOL TRAINING PROJECT PLAN DISCUSSION AND CLOSING 
UM WE ALREADY GOT ONE THROUGH OPENING AND PARTIALLY THROUGH ACQUAINTANCE 
SO THE REASON WE'RE HERE WE'RE GONNA DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL SO YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW 
THE VERY BROAD OVERVIEW IS ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY 
COURSE WE'LL HAVE TO GO INTO A BIT MORE UM DETAIL THAN THAT 
BUT UH PERSONALLY I THINK THAT THE ORIGINAL IS GONNA BE A VERY KEY ASPECT AT THIS DESIGN 
UM THERE'S A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS OUT THERE ANYWAY SO WE'RE GONNA NEED SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY GONNA SET IT PART 
THIS IS HOW TODAY SEEMS TO BE GOING TO WORK 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE THREE KAY PHASES SO YOU'VE PROBABLY ALREADY BEEN TOLD THE FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURAL AND THE DETAILED DESIGN 
UM 
FIRST ONE'S GONNA BE COVERING THE USER REQUIREMENT SPEC TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS WORKING DESIGN 
SECOND SEEMS TO BE CONCEPTUAL COMPONENTS PROPERTIES MATERIALS AND THE LAST ONE IS A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF OUR DESIGN AS FAR 
OF COURSE YOU'VE ALL GET THE SIMILAR EMAILS I BELIEVE RIGHT 
WHAT CAN I SAY 
EBENEZER YOU WANNA HAVE A YOU WANNA DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
BRILLIANTLY DONE 
THANK YOU 
TARIK WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A SHOT AT A BIT OF ARTISTRY 
UH UM YOU CAN CLIP THEM TO YOUR BELT 
YOU SHOULD ALSO L UM HAVE YOUR THE LAPEL MIC ON AS WELL 
YEP THE IT'S JUST ACROSS THERE THAT'S IT 
YEP 
YEAH 
IT'LL FOLLOW YOU IF YOU 
YOU CAN PROBABLY JUST STICK IT IN YOUR POCKET FOR NOW I WOULDN'T WORRY TOO MUCH 
SHOULD HAVE GOOD RANGE 
EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
DAVE IF YOU'D LIKE TO UH 
HAVE A DASH 
CHEERS 
HARDLY WHAT I'D CALL THE BEST DRAWING ON THE WORLD BUT IT'LL DO FOR NOW 
ALSO NOT QUITE AS FEARED AS YOUR AVERAGE TIGER BUT UH CATS ARE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE ANIMALS THEY'RE VERY INDEPENDENT 
THEY'RE SNOTTY AS HELL AT THE BEST OF TIMES AND UH WHAT CAN YOU SAY YOU GET TO LEAVE THOSE QUALITIES IN AN ANIMAL 
RIGHT 
I THINK WE'VE ALL MANAGED TO MASTER THE WHITEBOARD EITHER BY LOOKS OF IT IS ON IT IT 
PROJECT FINANCE 
SO YOU CAN SEE TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS PER UNIT 
THAT'S NOT A TERRIBLE LOT AS FAR AS I'M AWARE AND WE'RE HOPING TO SELL THEM FOR TWENTY FIVE 
IF WE'RE AIMING FOR FIFTY MILLION EUROS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE SELLING AN AWFUL LOT OF THEM 
YEP 
WELL FIFTY MILLION AND IF YOU'RE MAKING TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS ON EACH ONE THEN AWFUL LOT NEED TO BE SOLD 
OKAY 
NOW WE BETTER ACTUALLY JUST GOT ONE WITH THE UH THE MEAT OF THE PROJECT 
SO I'M GONNA GUESS THAT WE'VE ALL USED REMOTE CONTROLS 
ANY IDEAS OF WHERE YOU THINK A NEW REMOTE CONTROL COULD GO INTO THIS MARKET 
OKAY 
OKAY YEAH THA THAT'S TRUE WITH THE PRICE RANGE WE'RE LOOKING AT GOING FOR A TOUCH SCREEN WOULD PROBABLY BE POSSIBLY OUT OF OUR YEAH 
BUT YOU THINK UH AGAIN SOMETHING TO CONTROL MULTIPLE UNITS IN UH A SIMPLE FASHION 
WOULD THE THE DO SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF IN ONE BUTTON WOULD TURN ON SAY THE VIDEO RECORDER 
THE T. V. MAYBE THE SOUND SYSTEM AS WELL ALL IN IN AGE IS THAT KIND OF 
OKAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE A A GOOD STRONG IDEA 
UM 
ANY TAKES IN THIS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH I'VE HEARD I'VE SEEN THE BAR CODE DESIGN BEFORE YEAH 
OKAY WELL WE'RE BEGINNING TO RUN OUT OF TIME NOW SO WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF IDEAS WE CAN WE'LL HAVE TO WORK FAST 
UM ALRIGHT SO YOU CAN SEE WE'VE GOT THIRTY MINUTES UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING SO WE'LL HAVE TO TRY AND DECIDE ON SOME OF THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY 
UM HOW THE USER INTERFACE MIGHT WORK 
THAT'LL BE A KEY ASPECT ESPECIALLY IF THE IDEA OF UM SOME KIND OF MACROS FACILITY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PROGRAM IT 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSE BACK OR AT LEAST SOME KIND 
UM 
AND WE'RE GONNA MAYBE N TRY AND HAVE TO FIGURE OUT 
WHAT THE USER WANTS YES 
UM RIGHT 
HAS ANYBODY GOT ANYTHING THEY'D LIKE TO ADD TO THIS STAGE ANYTHING THEY THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISSED AS FAR 
I I DON'T SEE WHY NOT ALMOST EVERYBODY IS PROBABLY USED TO A CONSOLE BY NOW AND ALL OF THEM INCORPORATE SMALL KEYPADS ON THEM 
IN FACT EVEN THE MOBILE PHONES THESE DAYS ARE BEGINNING TO USE THEM AS WELL SO IT'S PROBABLY AN INTERFACE THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE USED IT 
UM 
AND THAT COULD ALLOW AN EASY NAVIGATION USED AS A JOYSTICK AS WELL 
OKAY 
SO SMALL STYLISH AND SOMETHING THAT'S JUST A LITTLE DIFFERENT 
OKAY 
THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO QUITE EASILY 
I WOULD I WOULD HAVE HOPED SO ANYWAY 
UM RIGHT 
I'D SAY WE FINISH THIS ONE UP WE GET STARTED I'LL GET ONE 
I'LL WRITE UP WHAT WE'VE UM KIND OF QUICKLY DONE AND I'LL GET THAT IT TO EVERYBODY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM SO FAR AS I'M AWARE WE LEAVE THE MICROPHONES HERE UM UNLESS WE GET TOLD OTHERWISE AND JUST TAKE THE LAPTOPS WITH US 
TARIK RAHMAN 
T. I. R. U. K. 
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
DO WE TOOK THEM OFF 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
UH UH 
NOW WHERE DO I PUT THE 
SO THIS SUPPOSED TO BE CLIPPED AS WELL 
UH DESTROYING YOUR ELEPHANT HERE 
UH HERE WE HAVE A TIGER 
OH 
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED TIGERS 
THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE BIG THEY'RE BIGGEST CATS 
UH I DID A PROJECT ON CATS IN THE WILD WHEN I WAS A KID AND UH IT WAS MY FAVOURITE CAT 
JUST 'CAUSE IT WAS LOOKS THE BEST THE STRIPES ORANGE 
MY DAD USED TO TALK ABOUT HE'S FROM BANGLADESH SO HE USED TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT THEM WHEN HE WAS WHEN I WAS A KID 
AND UH THEY'RE JUST THE MOST FEARED OF OF UH ANIMALS IN THE WOULD 
SO UH THAT'S WHY I LIKE THEM 
DIDN'T SAY AN ANYTHING ABOUT UM REALLY BUT 
MM 
'KAY 
WELL WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GAMING AND STUFF DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF 
STICK ON IT RATHER THAN BUTTONS 
LIKE UH CONTROL PADS YOU KNOW IF GAMES BUT OR IS THAT A BIT RIDICULOUS 
YEAH 
OH DAVE COCHRANE 
USER INTERFACE DEFIN DESIGNER YES 
UM 
UM THE MONKEY UM 
THE ONE OF UH IN FACT THIS IS A SOMEWHAT OBLIQUE REFERENCE IN FACT IT UH WELL MY I HAVE A THREE UH THERE YOU YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO UH WHO WHO WHO IS AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS MISS MONKEY 
UM MONKEYS HAVE ATTITUDE 
WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD THING 
AND I MEAN FOR AND FROM UH FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SORT OF THE STUDY OF HUMAN EVOLUTION THEY AND OTHER PRIMATES ARE TERRIBLY INTERESTING 
UM SO I LIKE MONKEYS 
AND AND TH TH TH TH TH TH THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE PERHAPS MORE ATTITUDE THAN MOST 
WELL ONE THING I'M AWARE OF US 
THE OTHER UH UM AT THE SORT OF V VERY HIGH PRICE END OF THE MARKET THERE'S THERE'S A EM EMERGING MARKET FOR SORT OF TOUCH SCREEN L. C. D. REMOTES THAT CAN BE UH PROGRAMMED IN M MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED WAYS THAN SORT OF CONVENTIONAL MODELS 
SO YOU GET THE SORT OF YOU GET UM YOU YOU CAN REDESIGN THE INTERFACE TO YOUR OWN NEEDS YOU CAN PROGRAMME IN MACROS 
AND YOU GOT A MUCH GREATER DEGREE UM UM I MEAN YOU GET IN THIS SORT OF OTHER ONE IN FIVE IN ONE WHATEVERS 
BUT YOU CAN GET INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT UH THE THE THE DIFF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT IT'S DESIGNED TO CONTROL TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT 
AND YOU CAN HAVE AN UH YOU KNOW ONE MACRO TO TURN THE UH YOU KNOW TURN THE T. V. TO THE RIGHT CHANNEL 
GET THE UH OUR UH REWIND THE TOP ON THE V. C. R. AND GET TO TO PLAY ONCE IT'S REWOUND FOR INSTANCE 
UM B IT OCCURS TO UM THERE MIGHT BE A NICHE FOR UH FOR A REMOTE THAT AIMED TOWARDS SOME OF THAT SORT OF FUNCTIONALITY BUT USING A JUST CONVENTIONAL PUSH BUTTON DESIGN 
AND THEREFORE PUTTING IT INTO A UM WELL MUCH LOWER PRICE BRACKET 
ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITIVE YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN I WOULDN'T LIKE TO SAY YOU G I MEAN YOU GET ONES THAT YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN MULTIPLE UNITS 
BUT SOMETHING THAT COULD UM OPERATE BETWEEN MULTIPLE UNITS IN A MORE INTEGRATED FASHION 
SOME AND IDEALLY SOMETHING INTO WHICH IT WOULD HAVE SOME AT LEAST LIMITED FACILITY FOR ME RUNNING MACROS 
FOR INSTANCE UM LET'S SAY UH UH UM 
OR UM YOU KNOW YOU PR UH YOU PRESS UH SAY THE PLAY BUTTON FOR THE D. V. D. PLAYER AND IT TURNS THE T. V. ON AND NOT THE RIGHT CHANNEL AS WELL 
UM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THE OTHER KEY FEATURE THAT UH THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BUILT INTO IT IS IT IS IS TO MAKE SOMETHING YOU KNOW FAIRLY SORT OF ERGONOMIC 
SOMETHING THAT JUST FITS FITS AS COMFORTABLY AS POSSIBLE INTO THE HAND 
BUT OF COURSE UH AL AL ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A MORE SORT OF 
SLIGHTLY UNCONVENTIONAL OR ATTRACTIVE UH 
SHA SHAPE FOR IT OVERALL 
A CURVE MM-HMM 
SOMETHING SORT OF SORT OF SL SLIGHTLY SORT OF BIOMORPHIC IN FORM 
UH WHICH IT WOULD NEED TO BE TOO SORT OF CONFORM TO THE SHAPE OF THE HAND MORE EFFICIENTLY ANYWAY 
OH EBENEZER ADEMESOYE 
WOULD YOU LIKE UM TO SPELL THAT 
SO 
UM N. E. Z. 
E. R. 
I'M THE MARKETING EXPERT 
SURE 
WHITEBOARD 
'KAY 
SO OKAY 
I WILL MAKE THIS QUICK SINCE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME 
UM 
'KAY SO IT'S NOT THE BEST PICTURE IN THE WORLD 
HERE WE HAVE AN ELEPHANT 
FIRST POINT BEGINS WITH AN A. SEEM LIKE EBENEZER 
ALSO ELEPHANTS HAVE A VERY GOOD MEMORY MUCH LIKE MYSELF 
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER BACK WHEN I USED TO LIVE BACK IN NIGERIA BUT I THINK I USED TO HAVE A PET ELEPHANT 
SO ELEPHANTS ARE BIG STRONG AND GENTLE AND THEY HAVE GREAT MEMORIES AND THEY BEGIN WITH THE LETTER E. JUST LIKE EBENEZER 
THANK YOU 
OH 
UH UH I THINK YOU GO 
THE LITTLE 
THE THE 
OH THAT'S GOOD WE CAN CLIP THEM IN 
OKAY 
YEAH THERE WAS THIS MICROPHONE AS WELL THAT YOU 
JUST UM SOMEWHERE 
I THINK SO 
YEAH 
THERE YOU GO 
UH THAT WAS PROFITING THAT WAS ONE MINUTE SO THAT'S THE AMOUNT MADE OKAY 
YEAH 
OH 
'KAY 
WELL UM I'VE NOTICED THAT UH GAMING C IS BECOMING QUITE POPULAR WITH TELEVISION UM WHEN I WAS YOUNGER WE USED TO E PLAY GAMES USING OUR CABLE 
USING THE CABLE SUBSCRIBED THE CABLE PROVIDERS BUT OUR REMOTE CONTROLS WOULD GET WORN OUT REALLY EASILY 
AND THE REMOTE CONTROL WAS NOT A GREAT KIND OF KEYBOAR UM KEYPAD FOR PLAYING GAMES 
SO PERHAPS ON THAT WAS MORE UM 
SPECIALISED FOR GAME PLAYING OR INTERACTIVE TELEVISION 
THEY THEY'VE RECENTLY BROUGHT OUT THIS NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR PEOPLE TO SET THEIR FAVOURITE CHANNELS OR UM TO RECORD THINGS 
INSTEAD OF PEOPLE ENTERING IN WHAT TIME THINGS START 
YOU SIMPLY STRI SLIDE A BAR TO SAY WHAT TIME IT BEGINS AND SLIDE ANOTHER BAR TO SAY WHAT TIME IT NEEDS YOU KNOW THAT'S 
YEAH IT'S IT'S TAKEN OUT THE 
YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE UH REALLY CLEVER TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL 
I THINK FOR GAMING YOU KNOW YOU WANT YOU WANT SOME BIG BUTTONS FOR UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT SHOOT 
UH YOU WANNA BE ABLE TO CHANGE ANGLES IN INTERACTIVE TELEVISION SO YOU NEED BUTTONS TO CHANGE THE TELEVISION ANGLE THE CAMERA ANGLES AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
WHAT THE USER WANTS UH 
OKAY 
OH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
SO 
NO NO THE DESKTOP YOU'LL FIND YOU SHOULD FIND THAT THERE'S A PROJECT DOCUMENTS LINK 
A WELL ACTUALLY JUST THERE 
YEAH 
THAT'S IT 
IF YOU DUMP IT IN THERE 
YOUR USERNAME 
OKAY 
EXCELLENT 
RIGHT 
HOPEFULLY THAT'S IS READY TO UH TO GO 
SO 
FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING 
WE'LL HAVE TO FLESH OUT SOME OF THE UH STUFF 
UM 
WE'LL START WITH THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING 
NOT A LOT THANKFULLY TO SAY 
WE INTRODUCED OURSELVES DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF A MACRO FACILITY INTERAC INTERACTING THE T. V. A BIT MORE UM MENTIONING OF BAR CODE 
JOYSTICK FOR USER MANIPULATION UM AND ERGONOMICS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AS WELL 
UM IT'S COME TO MY ATTENTION THE FOLLOWING 
TELETEXT HAS BECOME OUTDATED DUE TO THE POPULAT POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET 
REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR THE T. V. 
UM 
DO FOR UH TIME TO MARKET AND POSSIBLY ALSO COST ISSUES 
UM ALSO OKAY SO THE CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD STAY RECOGNISABLE UM IF UH YOUR COLOUR AND SLOGAN OF COURSE IS DOWN TO THE BOTTOM THERE 
UM 
NOW 
JUST TO SAY QUICKLY UH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT ONLY BEING USED FOR A TELEVISION THE MACRO FACILITY MAY NOW NOT BE REQUIRED 
UM OR AT L ITS FUNCTIONALITY WOULD HAVE BEEN OF LIMITED USE 
SO AT THE POINT IN MY OPINION ANYWAY THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE WORTH PURSUING 
UM IF ANYBODY DISAGREES WE CAN UH DEFINITELY SAY SO 
UM AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL JUST CRACK ON AND WE'LL GET EVERYTHING GOING 
UM I'D LIKE IT IF POSSIBLE HEAR FROM OUR MARKETING EXPERT FIRST TO HELP US GAIN AN IDEA OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO 
SO UM I'LL JUST LOAD UP YOUR PRESENTATION FROM HERE IF YOU WANT 
YEP 
SORRY 
OH 
SO YOURS THE 
OH SORRY 
OKAY RIGHT 
UH IF YOU THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
IF YOU DO YOU WANT ME TO JUST CYCLE THROUGH IT FOR YOU ARE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEP 
OKAY YEP 
MM-HMM 
IF YOU COULD UH 
SURE IF YOU COULD SPEED IT UP A BIT YEAH 
IF YOU COULD UH SPEED IT UP A BIT PLEASE YEAH 
SORRY 
COOL 
OKAY 
EXCELLENT 
RIGHT 
UM 
HERE FROM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER NOW I THINK MIGHT BE AN IDEA 
UM YOU'VE GOT YOUR PRESENTATION NOW IS IT IN THE USE IT 
OKAY 
TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
NO 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
UM IF WE COULD HEAR FROM OUR INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER OR DESIGNER 
IF YOU LOOK ON THE DESKTOP YOU'LL FIND THAT THERE'S A LINK TO THE PROJECT FOLDER OUR PROJECT DOCUMENTS 
IF YOU SAVE IT IN THERE WE CAN OPEN IT UP FROM HERE 
OR YOU FINDING IT OKAY OR 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OH 
YEAH 
UH DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT AT ALL MATE 
OKAY 
WELL 
OH SORRY I'M I'M INTERRUPTING YOU 
OR YOU USE IT YEAH 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
UM RIGHT WE CAN PROBABLY SKIP THAT FOR NOW 
SO WE'VE HAD SOME STUFF PUT FORWARD UM 
ALONG WITH THE NEW USER REQUIREMENTS 
UM WE'VE HAD A LOT OF KIND OF INPUT I'D SAY SO FAR 
UM 
I HEAR WHAT THE MARKETING EXPERT'S SAYING ABOUT UM VOICE ACTIVATED CONTROL 
HOWEVER I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF WORRIES ABOUT THAT 
THE POWER REQUIRED UM AND THE ABILITY TO THE COST IT SEEMS LIKE FOR UH AN EMBEDDED SYSTEM THIS COULD CAUSE US ISSUES 
UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE THAT THERE'S FAIRLY ROBUST SERVICES ON UH COMPUTERS VIA UH V VOICE I. B. M. DO UM DRAG AND DICTATE 
BUT THOSE REQUIRE A LOT OF MEMORY AND USUALLY UM STATE QUITE ADVANCED PROCESSOR REQUIREMENTS 
UM VOICE ACTIVATION COULD BE AN INTERESTING IDEA BUT I THINK THAT OUR IND INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WOULD PROBABLY UPON SOME RESEARCH SAY THAT IT'S MAYBE NOT FEASIBLE 
UM THAT'S JUST MY VIEW RIGHT NOW 
HOWEVER THE IDEA OF A JOYSTICK AND THEN MAYBE AN L. C. D. WHICH HAS BEEN KIND OF PUT FORWARD SO FAR IT'S ALMOST LIKE HAVING A SMALL 
T. NOT T. V. TO SAY BUT IF YOU CAN CONTROL ALMOST ALL OF THE FUNCTIONALITY FROM THE DISPLAY 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH POWER AN L. C. D. WOULD TAKE BUT IT MIGHT BE QUITE LOW 
WELL LITERALLY UM IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DISPLAY MAYBE SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN UM THIS IN A A MOBILE PHONE 
SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN READ NO NO UM FAIR AMOUNT OF INFORMATION 
TRAVERSE MAYBE QUITE A FEW MENUS IF WE MAYBE SAID MOBILE PHONES IS A GOOD EXAMPLE THEY USUALLY INCORPORATE THEY HAVE THE KEYPAD 
AND THEN EVR ALL THE OTHER FUNCTIONALITY IS USUALLY ASSOCIATED INSIDE BY TRAVERSING AROUND 
THAT COULD BE ONE POSSIBILITY 
UM AND THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE SAY THE COMMON BUTTONS AS YOU SAY VOLUME CONTROL CHANGING CHANNELS 
WE 
I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU 
MM-HMM 
THAT WOULD BE MY FEELING AS WELL I THINK WE COULD POSSIBLY CREATE QUITE A USEFUL USER INTERFACE 
UM NOW I MEAN I DON'T SORRY GO FOR IT 
I THINK IT COULD PROBABLY BE AIMED AT MOST PEOPLE WHO'VE USED A MOBILE 
AND THAT MIGHT BE JUST ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING TRY TO TARGET MOST PEOPLE 
UM IF WE ARE IF WE WERE TO FOLLOW THAT EVEN 
WE MIGHT BE SO YOU KNOW UM WE'RE KIND OF ALMOST RELYING ON THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH A MOBILE PHONE I SUPPOSE 
BUT THAT DOES COVER A VERY LARGE SECTION OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE 
UM I MEAN I IMAGINE AS WELL THAT THE ACTUAL L. C. D. AND MAYBE IT A CERTAIN EXTENT THE JOYSTICK AS WELL WOULD BE FOR THE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY 
WHICH MAYBE DOESN'T GET USED AS OFTEN 
MAYBE IT MAKES IT EASY FOR THEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO UM CHANGE THE CHANNELS AS IN THE FREQUENCIES AND SUCH FOR REPROGRAMMING IT 
UM AND YOU CAN STILL HAVE THE MAIN BUTTONS THAT ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO TURN THE MACHINE ON AND OFF D UP AND DOWN IT DEPENDS 
I MEAN MAYBE WE HAVE THE FEEL UM THE JOYSTICK IS A SEPARATE ONE FOR THE OTHER FUNCTIONS THEN 
THAT THERE'S JUST A A SMALL NUMBER OF SO YOU WERE SAYING UH BUTTONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEFINED 
SO LIKE WE GO FOR THE NICE STANDARD UM UP AND DOWN FOR AND VOLUME CONTROL 
SO THAT LITERALLY ANYBODY CAN COME ALONG PICK UP THE REMOTE AND STILL KNOW WHAT DO DO 
AND THEY CAN COMPLETELY IGNORE MOST OF THE FUNCTIONALITY WHICH WOULD BE FOR SAY THE O ACTUAL OWNER OF THE THE T. V. AND WHO WOULD NORMALLY USE THE UNIT 
I DUNNO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL THIS IS A REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE TO STICK TO I'M AFRAID THIS ISN'T IN THAT I'VE JUST ARBITRARILY DECIDED ON 
SO UM THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE SOLID ONES THAT HAS TO BE OBEYED FOR NOW 
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THIS IS OUR DESIGN SPEC FOR NOW 
'FRAID TO SAY 
UM 
I WOULD SAY SO YES BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE REMOTE BOXES AND THAT IS A SEPARATE UNIT 
UM I THINK THAT IT I WOULD SAY THAT THE DESIGN SPEC WE'VE BEEN WITH IS FOR THE TELEVISION ONLY FOR NOW 
AND UNTIL WE HEAR OTHERWISE WE SHOULD GO WITH JUST THAT 
OKAY 
MAYBE WE'LL HEAR DIFFERENTLY BUT FOR NOW 
IT WOULD BE EASE OF MANIPULATION OF CERTAIN FUNCTIONS YES 
UM 
THERE IS THAT POSSIBILITY YES 
B HOWEVER I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE'LL BE GOING WITH THAT BUT IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE THE EVEN IF THE MARKETING EXPERT 
THAT MIGHT BE SALES WHO ARE NOT IN THIS MEETING 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WAS UH THE ABILITY TO LOSE A REMOTE WHICH IS YOU SAID YOU'VE DONE IN FACT WE'VE PROBABLY ALL DONE 
UM I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A GIMMICK OR NOT 
BUT HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER SEEN THOSE ODD LITTLE KEY RINGS WHERE IF YOU WHISTLE IT WILL BEEP AND YOU TELL YOU WHERE IT IS 
UM 
WELL THE OTHER OPTION OF COURSE IS THAT UM THE WELL I WAS GOING TO SAY CLAPPING UM 
UM DIGITAL TELEPHONES UH FOR EXAMPLE IN INTO HAS OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT BASE UNIT 
SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE'S A BUTTON BUT MAYBE IT'S A BUTTON THAT YOU ATTACH TO THE T. V. 
SOMETHING WHICH YOU WHEN YOU PRESS THAT IT WOULD BEEP TO GIVE ITS LOCATION AWAY ON THE REMOTE UNIT 
AND THAT COULD BE SOMETHING COULD UM SEPARATE US A BIT 
AND THAT WAY BECAUSE WE'RE ATTACHING WHAT WOULD BE A SMALL BUTTON TO THE T. V. AGAIN SAY WHAT 
IT WOULD BE A SMALL TRANSMITTER UM WATCH BATTERY TYPE SCENARIO I WOULD SAY 
OR SOMETHING THAT IF IT WAS PROBLEMS ENOUGH YOU COULD ACTUALLY EVEN JUST UM I DON'T POWER THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK INTO 
YEP 
YEAH IT'S UH PUTTING A LOT IN YOUR SHOULDERS THERE IS I MEAN THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT SEPARATES US A BIT FROM THE MARKET AS WELL 
SO 
TO GO ON FROM HERE 
UM WE HAVE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THE REMOTE 
BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS MEETING IT WOULD BE BEST TO SAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING THIS IS THE DESIGN WE'RE GONNA TRY AND GET 
THIS IS HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE OURSELVES LOOK UNIQUE 
DO WE GO FOR MAYBE A REMOTE CONTRO UH SORRY WE'RE GONNA GO FOR A REMOTE CONTROL OBVIOUSLY 
DO WE GO FOR A SMALL JOYSTICK THAT WOULD OPERATE SAY CHANGING CHANNELS 
UP AND DOWN AND THEN WHAT ANOTHER BUTTON THAT WOULD SAY THAT IT'S NOW BEING USED TO MANOEUVRE ROUND THE L. C. D. 
WE COULD USE SAY THE LEFT AND RIGHT FOR CHANGING CHANNELS AND THE UP AND DOWN FOR VOLUME AND 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
VOILA 
VOLUME SELECTION OKAY YEP THE TELETEXT WE'RE GAMBLING WITH AND WE'RE GONNA SAY IT'S DEAD THE WAY OF THE DID 
SO WE WILL SORRY WE COULD MAYBE EVEN GO AS FAR AS SAYING POWER BUTTON SMALL JOYSTICK L. C. D. 
AND THEN WHAT MAYBE IS IT IN MORE BUTTON TO SAY THAT YOU'RE USING THE MENU SYSTEM 
AND WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PUSHING DOWN ON THE JOYSTICK TO SAY OKAY 
SO WE'RE HAVING VERY VERY FEW BUTTONS INVOLVED BUT NAVIGATION AROUND A MENU FOR MOST THINGS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM 
OKAY 
SO UM WE'RE ACTUALLY THAT SOUNDS LIKE A ROUGH IDEA 
DO WE INCORPORATE THE IDEA OF TRYING TO F LOCATE THE REMOTE CONTROL AGAIN VIA A BEEPING NOISE 
DO YOU MIND LOOKING 
THE ABILITY TO LOCATE IT AGAIN 
SO THAT WOULD REQUIRE A UM TRANSMITTER MAYBE ATTACHED TO THE T. V. JUST SO THAT IT SAYS FIND ME 
AND WHAT A BASICALLY A SMALL MICROPHONE UM IN THE ACTUAL UNIT CAN MAYBE HIDE IT IN THE BASE 
SORRY 
SOME SPEAKER SORRY YEAH 
UM 
E SO WE MIGHT BE BETTER WITH THE SOUND POSSIBLY WE COULD MAYBE INCORPORATE 
THE E THE TRUE FACT CONSIDERING THE COST OF AN L. E. D. WE COULD JUST INCORPORATE IT ANYWAY 
THE L. E. D. S CAN BE SURPRISINGLY BRIGHT NOW 
UM 
SO BY THE SOUNDS OF IT WITH WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING SO FAR 
YOUR DESIGN UM THE USER INTERFACE IS STILL QUITE OPEN YOU COULD GO FOR QUITE AN INTERESTING DESIGN 
BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY GOING TO HAVE A VERY FEW KEY AND YOU'VE GOT 
YOU KNOW A SMALL L. C. D. JOYSTICK 
E I THINK IT LEAVES YOU OPEN IT A A POTENTIAL WIDE RANGE OF SHAPES SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE IT STAND OUT SLIGHTLY 
UM IF YOU COULD LOOK INTO WHAT WE'VE SUGGESTED SO FOR THE FEASIBILITY OF UM SMALL TRANSMITTER 
UM AND SUCH MAYBE IF AN L. C. D. SCREEN REQUIRES TOO MUCH POWER OR SUCH 
EBENEZER UM MARKETING EXPERT 
F YEAH IF YOU COULD MAYBE AS WELL SO WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF THIS MINIMALIST APPROACH THAT WE'VE TAKEN 
WHERE OF A JOYSTICK TO CONTROL THE VERY BASIC FUNCTIONS AND THEN THE IDEA OF MANIPULATING IT LIKE YOU WOULD A MOBILE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW EASY THAT WILL BE WITHIN THE TIME FRAME BUT COULD BE SOMETHING WE COULD MAYBE LOOK INTO 
OKAY 
UM ANY LAST COMMENTS THAT ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO PUT FORWARD 
ANYTHING THAT THEY THINK HAS BEEN MISSED OUT 
BUT OF A WIDE OPEN QUESTION EITHER OF COURSE 
FEEL FREE TO EMAIL UM IF YOU THINK THAT UH WE'VE SCREWED SOMETHING UP AND WANNA GET IT RECTIFIED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
RIGHT 
SPEAKER AND L. E. D. FOR LOCATING UM 
TRANSMITTER 
GETTING THE EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE YEP THAT'S QUITE TRUE 
UM AND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CAN EASILY BE ADOPTED AT THE LAST MINUTE AS WELL I'D SAY 
THE ELECTRONICS COULD BE SO EITHER PLACED EXTERNALLY OR INTERNALLY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTROL SO THAT'S GOOD 
USES MAYBE GIVES US A NEW POTENTIAL MARKET 
'KAY 
UH ONE THING THAT WE'VE ALMOST NOT TALKED ABOUT IT ALL MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT UM USER INTERFACE 
WE ALSO NEED TO MAYBE GET THE SLOGAN ON HERE UM IT'S I'M POINTING AT MY LAPTOP WHAT IN GOOD 
REAL REACTION AND SUCH 
SO UM 
OH SORRY 
MY APOLOGIES 
NO IT COULD WILL BE I'VE PROBABLY MISSED THAT 
UM I THINK THAT'S AL ALMOST THE LAST MINUTE THING WE CAN JUST INCORPORATE INTO THE ACTUAL PLASTIC ON TOP 
SO I'M NOT TOO CONCERNED A THAT WE HAVEN'T GONE INTO DEPTH ABOUT THAT 
BUT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU COULD CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SHAPES 
IN FACT WE MIGHT LIKE TO PUT A SLOGAN ON AND UM POSSIBLY THE TWO R. S TO SIGNIFY THE COMPANY 
RATHER THAN REAL REACTION 
SOUNDS GOOD 
AND I'D SAY THAT THAT'S SO FOR NOW 
OKAY 
HOW DID WHERE DID WHERE DID YOU GET ALL YOUR AN INFORMATION 
OH 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
UH I WAS STILL WORKING ON STUFF I HADN'T GOT IT FINISHED 
UM ALRIGHT 
CLICK TO SAVE ONE WHERE DO I HAVE TO SAVE IT 
UM WHAT I'VE DONE WITH IT I'M SORRY 
SHIT 
UM 
I'M JUST CLOSING IT NOW 
WHERE I'VE SAVED IT 
THAT'S IT THERE YEAH 
OH RIGHT 
OH RIGHT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING DESIGN UH THIS IS BASICALLY THE INSIDE GOING ON OF THE 
THE UH REMOTE CONTROL 
SO WE HAVE THE ENERGY SOURCE WE HAVE THE USER INTERFACE THIS THIS IS WHAT I'VE SEEN 
UH THE SENDER WILL PUSH THE BUTTON THE CHIP WILL RESPOND UH AND THEN THE DIG DIGITAL SIGNAL IS SENT TO THE T. V. 
SO UH 
UH IF YOU GO TO NEXT SLIDE YOU'LL SEE YOU'LL SEE UH WHAT DO WE NEED ON THE USER INTERFACE 
DO WE NEED UH MANY BUTTONS OR DO WE NEED L MANY LIGHT BULBS THAT COULD BE EASIER TO UH TO REALISE WHICH APPLIANCES ARE IN OR NOT 
UM OR WOULD THAT TAKE TOO MUCH POWER WOULD WE NEED MORE UM COMPONENTS IN THERE TO SUPPLY THE POWER 
UM THE JOYSTICK IS ANOTHER THING IF WE WERE GONNA ADD THAT UM THERE'D BE MORE COMPONENTS TO DEAL WITH THAT 
UM SO UH WE NEED TO I DUNNO EXACTLY WHAT 
THAT'S THE DESIGN OF THE THE THE LAYOUT OF THE UH ELECTRONIC DESIGN 
BUT UM OBVIOUSLY THERE'LL BE MORE DETAILS ONCE WE'VE DECIDED WHAT WE'RE PUTTING IN THE USER INTERFACE 
SO THAT'LL BE DECIDED I GUESS 
UH AND THE NEXT SLIDE 
OH YEAH 
UM IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE THEN 
I JUST SAID THE IT WAS A MESS UH I WAS JUST PUTTING ADDING IT TOGETHER AT THE END THERE 
OH 
UH SO YOU HAVE THE ENERGY SOURCE OBVIOUSLY CONNECTED TO THE CHIP AND THE USER INTERFACE OBVIOUSLY CONTAINS EVERYTHING 
YOU HAVE THE SWITCH TURN IT AN INFRARED BULB 
UH WILL CONTACT THE T. V. AND WILL HAVE WHATEVER DEVICE OR D. V. D. PLAYER THE BULB WILL TURN ON TO SAY IT'S ONE 
UH SO DO WE NEED ON THE CONTROL UH DIFFERENT BUTTONS TO DECIDE ARE DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS WOULD TO BE EASIER 
UM I DUNNO WHAT WE SHOULD DECIDE ON THAT 
NO IT'S FINISHED YEAH 
COST 
MM 
L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE JUST TELLING YOU WHAT'S ON OUR UH INTERACTIVE L. C. D. OR 
DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL GET MIXED UP LIKE THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT THIS SCREEN AND THAT SCREEN AND THEN 
YOU KNOW TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING WORKING WOULD TO BE A BIT CONFUSING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE'RE JUST SAYING VOLUME 
SHOULD VOLUME BE IMPORTANT IN THE JOYSTICK DO YOU THINK 
YEP 
I 
YEAH THINK SO 
LIGHT BULB AS WELL NO 
AND A LIGHT BULB 
NO 
TO FLASH 
NO 
NAH YOU'D USE IT ANYWAY IF YOU HEAR IT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO I SHOULD JUST LIKE TO UM THE SPEAKER THE SPEAKER AND AN L. E. D. 
AND 
YEAH AND A TRANSMITTER 
UP 
FASHION 
THE SLOGAN IS YEAH THE SLOGAN'S WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS ISN'T IT 
'S ALSO LOOK COOL 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH IT'S IN THE IT'S IN THE FOLDER YEAH 
MM 
OKAY THIS IS A BRIEF RUN THROUGH OF THE UM OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE 
SO UM SO UH THE THE THE PRESENTATION IS UH ALREADY SLIGHTLY OBSOLETE BECAUSE I HAD IN MIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD UH B I BE AIMED AT CONTROLLING MULTIPLE DEVICES BUT UH THERE'S STILL STUFF OF RELEVANCE 
SO 
PRESS ONE 
I'VE LOOKED AT LOOKED AT A NAME UH COUPLE OF THEIR UH REMOTE CONTROL MODELS JUST FOR AN IDEA OF BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES 
UM 
AND WASN'T REALLY SATISFIED BY WHAT I SAW I HAVE TO SAY SO THIS IS MORE SORT OF SPRINGBOARD FOR UH HOW THIS COULD BE IMPROVED ON 
UM UM BASICALLY THE JOB OF THE DEVICE IS TO SEND COMMANDS TO ONE APPLIANCE IN THIS CASE THE TELEVISION SET 
UM TO SAVE YOU GETTING OFF YOUR BACKSIDE 
UM AND THERE'S TWO MAIN TRENDS IN THE ON THE SORT OF DESIGN PRACTICE 
IN THE ONE HAND AND THIS UH THIS PARTICULARLY RELATES TO ITS SORT OF EARLIEST MODELS WHERE WITH YOU KNOW I SEE SO MANY BUTTONS ON IT IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE TELEVISION SET 
UM GIVING YOU EVERY POSSIBLE FUNCTION THAT TH THAT THE DEVICE HAS THE REMOTE CONTROL CONTROLS 
AND MOST OF THESE FUNCTIONS ARE NOT GOING TO BE USED IT CREATES A RATHER USER UNFRIENDLY INTERFACE 
AND IN THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A USER FOCUSED APPROACH THAT PARES THINGS DOWN TO JUST WHAT WHAT IS MOST LIKELY TO GET USED 
UM 
WITH UH A AND A END OF COURSE THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SORT OF LOSS OF FUNCTION HERE OBVIOUSLY BUT MOSTLY THAT'S RELATIVELY PERIPHERAL FUNCTIONS 
AND SO YOU GO FOR SOMETHING THAT'S FAIRLY INTUITIVE TO USE 
AND UM WELL IF THE FOR THE MOST PART FOR T. V. REMOTE IT'S UH TH THAT WOULD BE CHANNEL CONTROL AND VOLUME 
UM AND IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU ARE WANTING TO INCORPORATE UH CONTROL OF A D. V. D. V. D. OR UH 
V. C. R. PRESUMABLY INTO THAT THEN THERE'S A PLAY PAUSE STOP REWIND FAST FORWARD RECORD SO FORTH 
UM 
MY OWN VIEW IS THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE GOING FOR A USER FOCUSED DESIGN 
UM BUT UH THE PRO I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF THE SORT OF USER FOCUSED DESIGNS THAT ARE ABOUT IS THAT THEY SORT OF MAKE ASSUMPTIONS IN ADVANCE ABOUT WHAT UH WHAT A GIVEN USER'S GOING TO UH WANT MO WANT TO DO FROM WANT TO TO DO MOST 
SO SOMETHING THAT'S UH 
SOMETHING THAT IS MORE PROGRAMMABLE 
THAT UH PERH PERHAPS HAS THE FULL RANGE OF FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE TO IT BUT YOU CAN THEN SPECIFY YOURSELF WHAT YOU'RE MOST LIKELY TO WANT 
UM SO THAT THESE ARE THEN IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH FAIRLY MINIMAL NUMBER OF CONTROLS 
UM I LIKED EBENEZER'S IDEA OF INCLUDING A JOYSTICK ON THAT AND UH POSSIBLY A SORT OF FAIRLY MINIMAL NUMBER OF SORT OF FUNCTION BUTTONS 
AND HAVE A DISP YOU THEN HAVE SOME SORT OF BASIC DISPLAY ON IT IS THAT IF YOU'RE UM SORT OF CHA CHANGING FROM DIFFERENT MODES FOR THE DEVICE IT'LL TELL YOU JUST EXACTLY WHAT UH YOU KNOW EACH DIRECTION OF THE UH 
OF THE UM JOYSTICK'S GOING TO DO OR WHO ARE WHAT EACH FUNCTION BUTTON'S GOING TO DO 
UM THIS IS ACTUALLY A AGAIN SLIGHTLY TAKING INSPIRATION OFF OF UH GAMES CONTROLLERS 
YOU KNOW THE PLAYSTATION CONTROL WHERE YOU HAVE FOUR BASIC FUNCTION BUTTONS THAT ARE JUST MARKED WITH UM DISTINCTIVE UH GEOMETRICAL SHAPES BUT THE AND THEN DEPENDENT ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH IT WHAT GAME AND SO ON UM THIS UH THESE FUNCTIONS ARE THEN SORT OF FURTHER SPECIFIED 
AND SO IT'S TAKING TAKING THE OLD FROM THAT 
UM 
THAT'S IT 
MM 
MM 
MM 
I I WAS THINKING THAT THE REMOTE THE UM SORT OF DEFAULT FUNCTIONS FOR THE JOYSTICK WOULD BE UP AND DOWN FOR UH VOLUME LEFT AND RIGHT FOR CHANNELS 
UM I THINK PROBABLY FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF HOURS OF USING IT UM BUT YOU KNOW MUSCLE MEMORY'S A WONDERFUL THING UM 
AND I THINK AND I THINK THAT SIZE OF UH DISPLAY WAS ABOUT WHAT I HAD IN MIND 
UM THOUGH 
I MEAN I W I WOULD SAY THAT UH WE COULD PROBABLY PROBABLY BE REQUIRED TO M M MOST OF THE MOBILE PHONE DISPLAYS YOU USE THESE DAYS OR COLOUR BUT WE SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO STICK TO BLACK AND WHAT 
SO IS SIMPLY TO KEEP UM KEEP THE UNIT COST DOWN 
UM I MEAN COLOUR COULD BE A SORT OF SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT BUT UH YOU KNOW COST A BIT OF EXTRA MONEY IF WE W W W W ONCE EVERYONE'S GOT THE FIRST 
YOU KNOW OH COLOUR'S OUT WE'LL HAVE TO REPLACE IT WON'T WE 
IT DOES NOTHING EXTRA 
MM 
MM 
MM 
I TH THE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE UH THE UH JOYSTICK IS THAT UH Y Y YOU THEN BASICALLY YOU CAN THEN BASICALLY PUT IT I MEAN FOR FOR T. T. FOR T. V. REMOTE ALONE 
YOU COULD PUT 
UM I MEAN THERE ARE LIKE I SAY THE THE THE MAIN THINGS PEOPLE DO WITH A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL IS THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL 
YOU CAN PACK ALL THAT INTO WAS NOT A SINGLE CONTROL 
UM 
BUT UH ABOUT THE BUT THEN O UH OBVIOUSLY IF UH 
YOU KNOW IF YOU I IF YOU WANTED TO ACCESS FURTHER FUNCTIONS I YOU YOU THEN GET TO SORT OF MENU NAVIGATION 
I MEAN WITH THINGS LIKE EACH WITH THINGS LIKE TUNING AND CHANNELS UM YOU KNOW ADJUSTING BRIGHTN UH BRIGHTNESS AND FIDDLY THINGS THAT IN IN REALLY BOTHERS WITH 
MOST T. V. S THESE DAYS ACTUALLY HAVE MENUS ANYWAY SO THIS WOULD BE A FAIRLY RATIONAL WAY OF INTEGRA 
INTEGRATING THE UH THE REMOTE WITH THE DEVICE IT'S CONTROLLING 
UM 
CONCERN ABOUT OUR MARKET 
UM IF WE ARE I MEAN MOST OF THE UH 
OF THE REPLACEMENT REMOTE MARKET IS SORT OF REMOTE CONTROL RATIONALISATION 
UM YOU'VE GOT TWENTY DIFFERENT DEVICES IN YOUR LIVING ROOM YOU WANT ONE W YOU YOU WANT ONE THAT'LL DO THE JOB OF ALL OF THEM 
UM OF ALL YOU'RE REPLACING IS ONE OF THE YOU KNOW HOWEVER MANY REMOTES YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIVING ROOM 
UM YOU KNOW YOU STILL NEED SEPARATE REMOTES FOR EVERYTHING ELSE 
I JUST THINK THAT UH POSSIBLY MM 
MM 
MM 
DOES THAT UM WOULD THAT INCLUDE UM ACCESS TO SAY INTERACTIVE FUNCTIONS ON DIGITAL OR CABLE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM 
JUST A THOUGHT 
UM MAYBE THEN OUR MARKET SHOULD BE T. V. MANUFACTURERS RATHER THAN THE PUBLIC 
TRY AND SELL IT TO SELL IT TO THEM TO SUPPLY WITH 
UM 
MM YEAH I'VE SEEN THEM 
MM 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
MM 
MM YEAH 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S 
YEAH 
FOR VOLUME 
ACTUALLY HOW 
ACTUALLY I WOULD SAY MAYBE TWO TWO FUNCTION BUTTONS THE EYE WE'RE NOW USING THE MENUS BUTTON AND UM AND AN OG AND ONE OKAY BUTTON 
I MEAN CERTAINLY SOMETHING I'VE FOUND WITH THE JOYSTICK ON UM THE JOYSTICKS ON MOBILE PHONES IS THAT A LOT OF THE TIME THE THE DEVICE MISTAKES YOU TRYING TO MOVE IT IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER FOR PUSHING DOWN FOR OKAY 
OR VICE VERSA 
AND THAT'S REALLY IRRITATING 
THE O THE O THE OTHER DIS DESIGN CONSTRAINT I THINK WE SHOULD BEAR IN MIND IS THAT PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW VERY MUCH USED TO USING A REMOTE CONTROL ONE HANDEDLY 
UM SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT E EVEN WITH THE JOYSTICK 
YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT CAN JUST SIT COMFORTABLY IN THE PALM OF THE HAND AND HAVE THE JOYSTICK JUST CONTROLLED BY THE THUMB 
OH 
SO AS A SMALL SPEAKER YOU MEAN 
MM-HMM 
BLUE ONES PARTICULARLY 
PLUS THAT'S A NICE WEE DESIGN TOUCH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
ACTUALLY NO NO WE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT 
UM IF WE DO END UP TRYING TO MARKET THIS TO TELEVISION MANUFACTURERS THEN THE UM THEN THE TRANSMITTER COULD ACTUALLY BE BUILT INTO THE TELEVISION 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YOU KNOW I THINK I MEAN IF IT W IF WE GOT A MAJOR TELEVISION MANUFACTURER TO SAY YOU UH YEAH WE'LL HAVE THAT 
SAVE AS THE BOTHER THEN THAT'S YOU KNOW VAST AMOUNTS OF SALES 
QUITE QUICKLY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
I THOUGHT THE UH THE DO THE DOUBLE ARC COULD PERHAPS UH B THE UH THE ENTER BUTTON 
JUST PUT IT IN THE DESKT DESKTOP 
PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH 
WHAT'S YOUR USERNAME 
WHAT'S YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD 
MM-HMM 
SORRY 
OKAY 
THERE WE GO 
'KAY 
SURE 
UM SHE WOULD YOU LOOK AT I'LL JUST DO IT FROM HERE 
UM TRY SECOND ONE MAYBE 
TRY TO YEAH MAYBE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH I THOUGHT I PUT IN MY LAST NAME I GUESS NOT BUT 
OKAY 
OH YEAH THAT'D BE FINE THAT'D BE GREAT 
OKAY 
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT BY ME EBENEZER 
OKAY SO UM WE DID SOME RESEARCH WE ASKED ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE THEIR OPINIONS ON REMOTE CONTROLS 
WE ASKED SOME UH OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS JUST WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
GET A LOT OF RE RESPONSES AND WE ASKED SOME VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD FEEDBACK 
PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THIS IS ONLY A HUNDRED PEOPLE USE EVEN WHEN THE GROUPS ARE DIVIDED INTO FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE 
TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE THERE'S ONLY MAYBE TEN PEOPLE FIFTEEN PEOPLE IN EACH GROUP 
OKAY 
SO WE GOT SOME THE BAD STUFF WE GOT REMOTES ARE OFTEN LOST 
I OFTEN LOSE MY REMOTE CONTROL THE BACK OF THE COUCH SOME PLACE 
AND EVEN IF IT'S NOT LOST PERMANENTLY IT TAKES ME A FEW MINUTES TO FIND OUT 
MOST BUTTONS ARE NOT USED ANY MORE LIKE YOU SAID TELETEXT IS OUTDATED NOW 
I REMEMBER TRYING TO LOAD A D. V. D. PLAYER RECENTLY 
AND THERE WERE SO MANY BUTTONS TO TAKE UM I DON'T KNOW MAYBE TEN MINUTES TO TO GO THROUGH EACH BUTTON 
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE SHIFT BUTTON TO ACCESS THE YELLOW BUTTONS YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST A LOT OF STUFF THAT IN IN REALLY USES 
AND IF THEY DO NOT VERY OFTEN 
TAKES TOO LONG TO MASTER THE REMOTE CONTROL 
I'VE SEEN SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE BIG THEY HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS 
YOU HAVE TO HOLD DOWN MORE THAN ONE OKAY IT IN TIME TO DO SOMETHING THEY'RE JUST NOT GREAT TO USE 
WE JUST GOT A LOT OF BAD COMPLAINTS ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE REMOTE CONTROLS 
SOME OF THE GOOD STUFF WE GOT 
BETWEEN THE AGE OF UH FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY EXTRA FOR VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE 
NOW DON'T GET EXCITED YET I'VE GOT MORE TO SAY IN THAT 
MOST PEOPLE'D BE WILLING TO PAY FOR THAT UM MOST PEOPLE WANT REMOTE CONTROLS TO BE PRETTY 
THEY WANT TO TO BE FANCY TH THEY THEY WANT TO TO BE DIFFERENT 
EVERYBODY HAS A WHITE REMOTE CONTROL WITH BLACK BUTTONS AND A RED BUTTON AND A GREEN BUTTON NOT EVERYBODY WANTS THAT 
FINALLY MY OPINION 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING IS COOL 
AND UH VOICE RECOGNITION THE SOFTWARE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE EXIST ALREADY 
IT'S A BIT SKETCHY AT SOME TIMES UH YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET GOOD ALWAYS ACCURATE RESULTS 
BUT FOR A VERY FIXED NUMBER OF WORDS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE 
HOW MANY DIFFERENT WORDS CAN YOU HAVE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT 
CHANNEL FIVE CHANNEL SEVEN YOU KNOW HOW MANY YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT MANY WORDS 
FOR A FIXED VOCABULARY IT WORKS QUITE WELL 
I'M PRETTY SURE PEOPLE WOULD BUY IT 
BUT AFTER A WHILE PEOPLE MAY WANNA RETURN IT 
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TO TO SAY SOME I MEAN MOST PEOPLE USE A REMOTE CONTROL FOR SWITCHING TO CHANNELS 
AND THEY SAY THEY DO THAT BUT NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE TIME 
USING THE REMOTE CONTROL NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE TIME FOR CHANGING CHANNELS AND THAT'S FOR FLICKERING THROUGH CHANNELS 
SO IF YOU HAVE TO SAY APA PA PA PA 
IF YOU HAVE TO DO THAT ALL THE TIME THEN PEOPLE MIGHT GET A BIT FED UP WITH THAT AND THEY MAY RETURN IT 
HOWEVER UH BECAUSE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE EXISTS ALREADY 
THERE'S NO NEED TO SPEND MONEY ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUT THIS DOES MEAN THE AND FOUR MICROPHONES ON THE 
IN THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS AN UNUSUAL FEATURE IN MY OPINION 
BUT IF WE DO HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT YOU CAN UH GET RID OF 
SO YOU COULD THERE'RE TWO OPTIONS 
THERE YOU HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION BY ITSELF WHICH I THINK IS A BIT IMPRACTICAL FOR LIKE NIGHT TIME IF YOU WANNA BE WATCHING TELEVISION AND YOU WANNA BE QUITE 
OR I DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE A VISITOR COMING ROUND AND THE REMOTE'S ONLY TRAINED FOR YOU IT'S A BIT IMPRACTICAL TO HAVE JUST VOICE RECOGNITION BY ITSELF 
SO YOU CAN HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION AND A REGULAR REMOTE 
BUT IMAGINE YOU GET RID OF THE REGULAR REMOTE PART THEN YOU CAN DESIGN THE REMOTE TO LOOK ANY WAY YOU WANT TO TO LOOK 
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON PHYSICAL SIZE 
OR SHAPE IT IT COULD BE AS FANCY AS YOU WANT TO TO BE 
YOU KNOW IT COULD BE LIKE A LOLLIPOP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOMETHING WEIRD LIKE THAT 
AS LONG AS THE VOICE RECOGNITION STUFF WORKS THAT'S THAT'S FINE 
SO WE HAVE THE THREE BIRDS WE HAVE THE DESIGN THAT WE HAVE THE THE FANCY BUT 
RIGHT THE VOICE RECOGNITION'S FANCY IT'S COOL IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S RADICAL SO 
AND THEN WE HAVE AN EXTRA BUT I DON'T REMEMBER SO I'M PRETTY SURE PEOPLE WILL BUY THE REMOTE 
BUT IS IT PRACTICAL TO HAVE A VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IN A REMOTE CONTROL I THINK IS A BIG QUESTION 
UM WELL PEOPLE 
WELL PEOPLE BE WILLING TO WAIT FOR THE THE PERIOD THAT IT'LL TAKE TO TURN THE REMOTE 
'CAUSE I THINK IT WILL THE REMOTE WILL UH GET BETTER OVER TIME WITH THE SAME SURE SURE 
BUT FOR THE FIRST WEEK OR FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS ARE YOU WILLING TO WAIT ARE YOU WILLING TO HAVE A BAD REMOTE CONTROL 
AND UH WHAT IF YOU HAVE VISITORS COME ROUND THEY STAY THE NIGHT THEY WANNA USE THE T. V. 
THEY CAN'T USE THE REMOTE BECAUSE THEY SPEAK DIFFERENTLY TO YOU 
UM HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR REGIONAL ACCENTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
UH WILL PEOPLE RETURN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
I THINK A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BUY THE REMOTE CONTROL IF THEY HAVE THE MONEY YOU KNOW SO 
DO OUR AUDIENCE HAVE THE MONEY BUT WOULD THEY RETURN IT AFTER A WHILE BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS FAST AS PRESSING A BUTTON IT'S NOT A PRACTICAL 
SO 
THESE ARE THINGS I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER 
I THINK IT'S COOL 
I'M SORRY 
SURE 
I'M BUT IT AND YEAH 
I THINK IT'S COOL 
BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME CONSIDERATIONS 
SO YEAH 
THERE WAS UH A WEBSITE UH 
RIGHT HERE 
G I STARTED MAKING STUFF UP THEN I GOT AN EMAIL SAYING 
MM 
WELL LIKE IF YOU GO TO AN UH WHICHEVER ONE YOU WERE WORKING YEAH AND YOU JUST CLICK FILE SAVE US 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
MM 
I UH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
SURE ABOUT THE IDEA OF A REMOTE WITH A MENU OR AND A JOYSTICK I THINK LIKE I UH IF I WAS IN THE HABIT OF BUYING REMOTE CONTROLS THEN I WOULD WANT ONE 
BUT I THINK WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC AUDIENCE YOU KNOW 
LIKE WHAT IS OUR TARGET AUDIENCE WHAT NICHE ARE NICHE ARE WE TRYING TO MARKET AND CORNER 
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING LIKE FOR WHOM IS THIS INTENDED 
EVERYBODY 
MOST PEOPLE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SURE 
I THINK THAT'S FOR YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
OKAY SPECIFICALLY TELEVISION 
SO THE JOYSTICK IS JUST FOR DIFFERENTNESS 
OKAY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
IT'S JUST THE WAY I FIGURE OUT TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS PER UNIT WE HAVE TO SELL AT LEAST LIKE THREE MILLION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
NOT TOO ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE THE MONEY WE WASTE ON REMOTES THAT ONE ONE BUYS YOU KNOW 
LIKE IF WE MADE A PERF IF WE MADE A KS FOR EVERY REMOTE WE MADE SOMEONE BOUGHT IT THEN WE HAVE TO SELL A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS 
WE JUST 
SO THIS GONNA BE ENOUGH TO TO SELL 
YEAH 
I HAD ONE OF THIS AND MY BROTHER AND MY DAD COULD HAVE ABOUT UM UP BECAUSE IT IT WENT OFF ALL THE TIME ACCIDENTALLY 
THE CLAPPING ONE 
IT A TELEVISION 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
I THINK SO YEAH 
BUT WE HAVE A FREQUENCY OF HOW WHAT PEOPLE USE A REMOTE CONTROL FOR MOST 
UM POWER IS USED LIKE ONCE PER HOUR CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT PER HOUR 
THAT'S BY FOR THE BIGGEST ONE AND THEN TELETEXT IS STILL HERE THAT'S LIKE FOURTEEN AND VOLUME SELECTION 
NO YEAH OKAY OKAY 
YEAH UM 
MM-HMM 
UM 
I THINK BECAUSE IT'S SO SMALL IT MIGHT BE IN UH I MEAN IF WE ONLY HAVE LIKE TWO THREE BUTTONS IT MIGHT BE ESSENTIAL TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT 
YEAH 
SPEAKER YEAH 
W THIS LITTLE KEY RINGS HAVE BOTH SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I CAN GIVE YOU THE FREQUENCY WHAT PEOPLE WHAT OPTIONS PEOPLE USE MOST OFTEN 
I GUESS THAT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT IN THE TS DEFINING THE THE SOFTWARE SIDE OF THE INTERFACE RIGHT 
YOU WANT THE STUFF 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
SURE 
SURE 
MM 
'KAY 
YEAH 
TRANSMITTER 
ALRIGHT YEAH 
CRACK ON 
OKAY SO WE'LL START OFF WITH A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE MINUTES 
I THINK TO SUM UP THE LAST MEETING WOULD BE TO SAY UM THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE'VE UM SET IT 
THESE ARE WE WERE GOING TO GO FOR WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FAIRLY MINIMAL DESIGN BASED ON UH A SMALL JOYSTICK 
L. C. D. AND A COUPLE OF OTHER BUTTONS FOR NAVIGATION UM WITH POWER BEING I SUPPOSE ONE OF THE MAIN SINGLE PURPOSE BUTTONS 
UM WE WERE ALSO GOING TO USE NOVELTY OF BEING ABLE TO LOCATE THE REMOTE CONTROL AGAIN VIA A SMALL TRANSMITTER WITH ANY LUCK 
THE IDEA TO TRY AND SEPARATE US AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE MINIMAL DESIGN 
UM LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE ABLE TO BE FAIRLY ADVENTUROUS IN THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL SHAPE OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL WITH ANY LUCK 
UM THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP THE LAST ONE 
SO WE'LL JUST CRACK ON UM LIKE TO MAYBE START WITH THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER IF IT'S POSSIBLE 
UM UH THE CON TODAY IS THE CONCEP TODAY 
THIS UH MEETING IS THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE AND SO UM 
SORRY ABOUT THIS 
AND SO TO COVER THINGS LIKE UM WHAT THE PARTS MIGHT BE MADE OF UM 
CAN WE UH OUTSOURCE THESE FROM ELSEWHERE UM WELL WE HAVE TO CONSTRUCT ANY ITEMS OURSELVES 
YEAH OKAY WELL I'LL JUST UH I'LL LOAD IT UP THEN 
UM 
WHICH ONE DO YOU 
UH INTERFACE CONCEPT 
THAT'S YOU 
WE'VE GOT TREND WATCHING THAT'S YOU 
COMPONENTS DESIGN 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
NOW THE KINETIC ONE WE'VE 'CAUSE THAT'S THE ONES WHERE LIKE YOU THE MOVEMENT CAUSES IT 
UM THE BUT UH THE BATTERY FOR A A WATCH WOULDN'T REQUIRE A LOT OF POWER WOULD BE MY ONE QUERY 
IS A KINETIC ONE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPLY ENOUGH POWER 
DO YOU THINK 
WE 
WHICH I SUPPOSE AS WELL WOULD ALLOW US TO GO OFF THE SHELF AGAIN YOU'D SAY 
UM 
UM 
COURSE 
UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D BE ABLE TO OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD OR NOT THE SINGLE CURVED AND DOUBLE CURVED 
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE 
UM COULD YOU MAYBE DRAW SOMETHING 
I YOU DON'T DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT IT'S JUST 'CAUSE I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO 
SO IT MIGHT LITERALLY JUST BE OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
MM 
OKAY THAT WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE CAN TALK ABOUT 
UM SO YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THE CHIP THAT WE MIGHT REQUIRE AS WELL 
UM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA AS FAR 
LIKE WHEN WE'RE SAYING THAT WE'D NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP FOR AN L. C. D. DOES THAT IN SHOOT THE COST UP BY A DRASTIC AMOUNT 
OR 
WELL I THINK COMPARED TO SAY JUST PRESSING BUTTONS 
IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON THAT SENDS A CERTAIN TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE INFRA RED WHEREAS I THINK IF WE'RE CONTROLLING THE L. C. D. WE DEFINITELY REQUIRE A MUCH MORE POWERFUL CHIP 
JUST COMPARED TO THE CHIP YOU WOULD USE FOR PUSHING BUTTONS I THINK SO THE THE POINT BEING MADE 
IF I'VE NOT OVER STEPPED 
YEAH 
OKAY UM SHOULD I GO ON OR GO BACK 
WELL WE'D ALSO BE RELYING ON THE UM THE BULK BUYING IN PRODUCEMENT AND SUCH 
I ASSUME 
WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THE COSTS OF THIS 
SO SORRY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM 
SO ON THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'VE BEEN SUPPLIED HOW FEASIBLE WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE IDEA OF USING AN L. C. D. LOOKS 
UM I MEAN THAT SOUNDS LIKE QUITE A GOOD REQUIREMENT TO ME 
UM CONVENTIONAL BATTERY WOULD SEEM TO MAKE SENSE 
UM I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANY COST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SINGLE AND DOUBLE CURVED AND I'M I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE 
BUT PLASTIC OR RUBBER IS A TRADITIONAL FORM OF CASING WOULD SEEM TO BE A GOOD WAY FORWARD 
OKAY 
OKAY WELL UM 
YEAH WELL WELL WE MOVE ON IT USER INTERFACE AND YEAH 
UM SORRY AS LONG AS WERE YOU 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM AND D D D INTERFACE CONCEPT 
YEAH 
CAN I JUST JUMP IN SLIGHTLY THERE 
THAT WOULD SUGGEST THE DOUBLE CURVED DESIGN'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE MOST APPROPRIATE THEN 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
UM YEAH 
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE'LL PROBABLY BE QUITE TIGHT FOR TIME AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE PROBABLY GET A LOT YOU'D LIKE TO SAY I GUESS 
OKAY 
EXCELLENT RIGHT 
UM UH 
FILE OPEN 
TREND WATCHING 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
WELL UM I WOULD SAY THAT THE MOST YOU COULD PROBABLY HOPE FOR IS GAINING A YEAR'S LEAD ON MOST PEOPLE ANYWAY 
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BRING OUT NEW DESIGNS SO IF WE CAN GET NEXT YEAR THEN THAT'S POSSIBLY A GOOD PLACE TO START ANYWAY 
UM 
SEEMS LIKE A A LOT OF THE COMPONENTS COULD BE OFF THE SHELF SO I DON'T EXACTLY WHAT COST WOULD BE INCURRED 
UM I CAN USE YOUR POINT ABOUT THE NUMBER KEYPAD 
BUT I'VE I WOULD SAY THAT WE CAN PROBABLY INCORPORATE IT INTO THE MENU SYSTEM IF YOU NEED TO DO TRAVERSAL OF A LARGE NUMBER OF CHANNELS 
MY FEELING WOULD BE THAT EVEN IF IT A LATER DATE THIS WAS TO BE TAKING CONTROL OF UM BOXES AS WELL UM HAVING THE EASE OF THE L. C. D. AND THE JOYSTICK WOULD PROBABLY ALLOW YOU TO MANIPULATE ENOUGH CHANNEL NUMBERS FOR YOU TO BE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO UM SO WE'LL SEE A LARGE NUMBER OF STANDARD COMPONENTS UM 
SAY SOMETHING LIKE UM LITHIUM ION BATTERY THE KINDA THAT YOU FIND IN MOST UM SMALL HAND HELD DEVICES NOW 
UM 
LOOKS LIKE WE GOING FOR A DOUBLE CURVED DESIGN 
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT COST IMPLICATIONS THERE ARE IN THAT 
UM LOOKS LIKE WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DECIDED ON SOME KIND OF FLEXIBLE RUBBER 
THOUGH I'D HAVE TO SAY DEPENDING ON HOW FLEXIBLE IT SO WE MIGHT NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF INNER FRAME 
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY WAY WE COULD MAYBE REMOVE THE ARTICULATION 
I CAN SEE WHY IT LOOKS APPEALING BUT IT COULD BE A WEAK POINT IN UM THE STRUCTURE DO YOU THINK 
THAT WOULD BE A WORRY OF MINE 
YEAH WE WON'T ADD THAT FUNCTIONALITY 
HOWEVER AN INTERESTING POINT IS I DON'T KNOW HOW SERIOUS YOU WERE THERE 
BUT WE IF WE TAKE SOME OF THE IDEAS WHY DON'T WE MAKE THE DAMN THING YELLOW TO INCORPORATE THE DOES THE COLOUR OF THE LOGO 
I DUNNO 
IT'S AN CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT COLOUR FROM YOUR AVERAGE UM 
THAT'S TRUE 
WAS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR RESEARCH 
MM-HMM 
AN INTERESTING POINT IS THAT IF THE PERSON DOESN'T HAVE THE COMPUTER WE CAN STILL MAKE THE PROCESS EASIER BECAUSE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO LOOK UP CODES 
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE TO THAT ONE OF THE OPTIONS THEY HAVE IS THAT THEY LOOK UP THE NAME OF THE COMPANY ON THE L. C. D. AND THEN THEY MAYBE LIKE UP DIFFERENT NAMES OF UM DIFFERENT ACTUAL UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED 
ARE WE HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL JUST GO THROUGH THEM UNTIL IT'S LIKE DOES THIS DO THE CORRECT FUNCTION AND SUCH 
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE USED VERY OFTEN THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
OKAY THIS JUST TO GIVE US A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE MEANT TO BE DOING FOR THE NEXT STAGE 
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT YOU GET THAT ANYWAY 
THIS IS THE CONCEPTUAL ONE 
UM 
I THINK WE'VE COME UP I THINK WE'VE COVERED EVERYTHING WE NEED TO HERE 
UM I THINK WE'VE DECIDED ON WHAT YOU KNOW DECIDED ON STANDARD ITEMS FOR MOST OF UM RUBBER AND SUCH 
SO WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT THE DETAILED DESIGN AND WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING FOR THE NEXT MEETING 
UM 
SO FOR EXAMPLE UM I'LL JUST START AT THE TOP 
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF AND THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER GONNA BE WORKING QUITE CLOSELY AT THIS STAGE 'CAUSE IT'LL BE HARD NOT TOO OBVIOUSLY 
UM 
LOOKING FROM PROTOTYPING OF SOME DES DESCRIPTION USING CLAY 
UM I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE TOLD A LOT MORE ABOUT THAT IS UH PROGRESS 
UM 
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
THEY'RE KIND OF IT LOOKS THEY'RE THE IDEA I'VE PUSHED FORWARD SO FAR AS MAYBE MORE OF A PHYSICAL IN THERE 
WHEREAS POSSIBLY BE MORE INTERESTED IN MAYBE HOW THE L. C. D. 'S GOING TO INCORPORATE DO YOU THINK 
OR DO YOU S PERCEIVE THAT MOST THE DESIGN DESIGN DECISIONS STILL NEED TO BE BASED ON THE PHYSICAL LAYOUT 
MM-HMM THAT'S VERY TRUE 
UM 
OKAY 
UM GET PRODUCT EVALUATION AS WELL 
UM 
I I THINK WE'D BE YEAH NO 
IT'D BE MORE A CASE OF HOW DO WE ENVISAGE US PERFORMING THE PRODUCT EVALUATION ONCE WE HAVE A MODEL TO TEST WITH 
UM SO IT'D BE A CASE OF DO YOU THINK THAT JUST BRINGING USERS IN TO HAVE THEM TEST IT IT 
UH MAYBE PUTTING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PRODUCTS INTO THE FIELD IN CERTAIN PLACES WHICH I SUPPOSE IS QUITE SIMILAR 
OR JUST KIND OF HITTING THE STREETS AND YOU KNOW SAYING THIS IS A NEW REMOTE CONTROL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE LIKE IF IT 
UM 
I THINK THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY UNDER THE AGE OF SAY MAYBE SIXTY OR SOMETHING LUDICROUS 
UM THE REASON I'M SAYING THAT SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT A A REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROL 
SOMETHING THAT'S STYLISH SO MAYBE YOU'RE EVEN JUST MAYBE YOU'RE NARROWING DOWN YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE SIMPLY BY SAYING 
IF THEY'RE BUYING IT THAT OFTEN ARE THEY'RE MAYBE LOOKING TO REPLACE SOMETHING THEN 
THEY'VE GOT A BIT OF FREE CASH SO THAT PUTS THEM POTENTIALLY IN THE YOUNGER AGE BRACKET 
MAYBE EVEN SINGLE JUST FOR THE REASONS OF UM UH EXCESS CASH FLOW 
ALTHOUGH OF COURSE I MEAN TO TWENTY FIVE EUROS I DON'T THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT CHARGING THE EARTH FOR THE UH DEVICE 
THINK THAT'S WELL WITHIN THE NORMAL BRACKET 
UM YOUR IDEA OF THE U. S. B. WOULD I THINK WOULD LARGELY DEPEND ON THE COST 
U. S. B. 'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THE CHEAPEST INTERFACES OUT THERE 
BUT IT MIGHT PUSH THE COST OF THE OVERALL UNIT UP 'CAUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE NOT JUST THE CONNECTION BUT THE CHIP FOR COMMUNICATING WITH THE REST OF THE SYSTEM 
THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE TO BE BASED ON 
THE THE IDEA WAS THAT MAYBE IT COULD CONNECT UP FOR UM ALLOWING A SOFTWARE INTERFACE ON THE P. C. FOR A LARGER PROGRAMMING DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE'VE GONE FOR SUCH A NICE 
EASY MINIMAL DESIGN NORMALLY 
UM 
IT'S JUST FOR T. V. BUT FOR 
PROGRAMMING IT TO USE YOUR T. V. YOU MIGHT HOOK IT UP TO THE P. C. 
I I'M NOT SURE BUT I'M THINKING MAYBE THAT THE ADDITIONAL COST OF THE U. S. B. MIGHT BE PROHIBITIVE 
WE DON'T KNOW UNLESS IT WOULD MAKE SENSE IT 
MM-HMM 
WE 
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE IT 
I WOULD SAY IT 
UM AND WE'D BETTER BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE TIME AS WELL 
WE'VE ALREADY HAD THE FIVE MINUTE WARNING SO 
UM 
I WOULD SAY YEAH 
INTERNATIONAL WOULD MAKE SENSE 
UM YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT PRODUCT EVALUATION 
I'M I'D BETTER START WRITING UP A HELL OF A LOT OF CRAP 
UM YOU'RE GONNA LIKE A BIT MORE AT THE KIND OF THE PHYSICAL MAKE UP YOU SAY 
UM LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA NEED A MAYBE A KIND OF PROTOTYPE IN CLAY 
UH WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES 
UM 
SO UM DO I THINK WE'VE GOT AN IDEA OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO FOR THE NEXT MEETING WOULD YOU SAY 
YEAH I WOULD USE THAT WOULD BE MY MY FEELING 
WE SEEM TO HAVE QUITE A GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT THE IDEA OF THE THE R RUBBER COULD BE QUITE 
YEAH 
SO WE ALWAYS NEED TO REMEMBER THAT SOMEWHERE WE'RE MEANT TO BE GETTING THE SLOGAN ON 
POSSIBLY I'M THINK I'M NOT SURE BUT I'M USING A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE AROUND MAYBE THE JOYSTICK AREA WHICH COULD BE USED 
UM 
OKAY 
AND I THINK THAT SAYS IT ALL REALLY 
RIGHT 
SO EVERYBODY IN A HALF HOUR 
OH OH OKAY 
I'LL JUST 
UH I HAVE A PRESENTATION I JUST SAVED IT IN THE UH THE FOLDER 
OH 
IT'S UH 
COMPONENTS DESIGN 
ALRIGHT 
SO 
OH 
THE CASE UH L THAT'S WHAT I WROTE FIRST OF ALL COULD BE PLASTIC OR PLASTIC 
UH ABOUT LATER ON WE FIND OUT THAT UM IT CAN BE RUBBER AS WELL OR TITANIUM OR EVEN WOOD 
SO UH WE DECIDE WHAT IT'S GONNA BE 
PROBABLY PLASTIC 
OH 
WE NEED THE INFRA RED TRANSMITTER 
GET THAT OFF THE SHELF 
UH JOYSTICK WE'LL PROBABLY IF WE'RE GONNA USE IT UM COULD BE 
PLASTIC WE ARE RUBBER EVEN AS WELL 
UM 
IF YOU GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE 
OH 
IF YOU GO ON IT IF UH FINDINGS IT'S LIKE TWO OR THREE SLIDES DOWN 
RIGHT 
SO THIS IS WHAT I FOUND WE CAN SEE 
OH 
THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BATTERIES 
UM 
CAN THERE IS A HAND DYNAMO OR THE KINETIC TYPE ONES YOU KNOW THAT THEY USE IN WATCHES OR ALSO UH A SOLAR POWERED ONE 
UM 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH I DON'T THINK IT WOULD 
UM 
AND SOLAR CELLS I DUNNO ABOUT THAT 
OH 
WE SHOULD PROBABLY JUST USE CONVENTIONAL BATTERIES 
UM 
JUST LIKE IN USUAL REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM 
YEAH 
UM 
AND THESE ARE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OUR TWO DIFFERENT TYPES THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHAPES YOU CAN HAVE 
UH ONE IS A FLAT ON AND THEN MORE ORIGINAL ONES ARE SINGLE CURVED ONE OR IN WITH A DOUBLE CURVED 
UM THE MATERIALS ARE THE OTHER SO YOU CAN SEE BUT UH YOU CAN'T HAVE A TITANIUM ONE FOR A DOUBLE CURVED UH WHICH WOULD BE 
YEAH AND LIGHT 
UH I THINK SO AS WELL YEAH 
THEY MAKE MOUNTAIN BIKES OUT OF THAT DON'T THEY 
SO IT'S REALLY LIGHT AS WELL 
UM 
IT YEAH 
OH 
WELL 
FOR A CURVED WELL I WAS THINKING TO F FOR TO SIT ON YOUR THE PALM OF YOUR HAND 
UH MAYBE LIKE THIS WITH THE UH JOY PAD HERE 
JOYSTICK HERE 
AND MAYBE 
UM 
NO OKAY BUTTON AROUND HERE IS THAT THE THUMB CAN UH IS IT QUITE EASILY 
UM I DON'T EXACTLY 
DOUBLE CURVED 
IT PROBABLY MEANS THIS IS PROBABLY DOUBLE CURVED 
UH WHEREAS A SINGLE CURVED WOULD BE 
LIKE THAT 
I GUESS 
OR NOT NECESSARILY 
YEAH LIKE THAT 
WHEREAS THIS IS TWO CURVES 
UM 
SO I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN BY UH DOUBLE CURVE 
UM WHICH OBVIOUSLY IT LOOKS BETTER THAN THE SINGLE CURVE BUT UH YOU CAN'T HAVE IT IN TITANIUM WHICH IS 
OH 
A NICE MATERIAL 
OH 
AND FOR THE BUTTONS UM IT CAN HAVE THE SCROLL WHEEL WHICH THEY USE IN MOUSES FOR COM P. C. S 
UH BUT 
UM IT REQUIRES A 
MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP TO USE AND IF YOU WANNA USE L. C. D. IT'S EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE 
SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE THERE'S TRADE OFFS THERE 
UM 
IF YOU WANT THE BUTTONS TO BE UH YEAH IF YOU HAVE A DOUBLE CURVE UH CONTROL AND IT'S RUBBER THEN YOU HAVE THIS RUBBER BUTTONS AS WELL 
BUT YOU'RE GONNA UH I RECKON YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE UH OKAY A NUMBER KEYPAD ANYWAY FOR THE AMOUNT OF CHANNELS THESE DAYS 
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS TO GET TO THE ONE YOU WANT 
YOU WANNA ENTER JUST THE NUMBER OF IT IF YOU KNOW IT 
SO 
UM I RECKON WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A NUMBER KEYPAD ANYWAY 
DO YOU THINK 
YEAH 
SO 
DEPENDS WHERE 
GONNA SPEND THE MONEY 
IF YOU WANT THE F FANCY L. C. D. DISPLAY 
YEP 
YEAH I 
UM 
UH THE PREVIOUS SLIDES JUST EXPLAIN WHAT'S ON THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF THE UH REMOTE CONTROL 
IF YOU GO TO THE ONE BEFORE THAT UH IS IT JUST SAYS WHAT IT DOES 
TRANSLATE THE KEY PRESS INTO AN INFRA RED SIGNAL AND THIS IS RECEIVED BY THE T. V. 
UH THE CHIP JUST NEEDS TO DETECT THE SIGNAL OR DETECT THE KEY PRESS AND THEN UH IT'LL SEND IT AT THE TR THE AMPLIFIER 
AND UH THEN THE NEXT SLIDE JUST SHOWS HOW THE UH COPPER WIRES 
UH INTERACT WITH THE BUTTONS THE RUBBER BUTTONS UH 
IT UH GOT SENT TO THE CHIP 
SO THAT'S JUST HOW THE CONTROL WORKS INSIDE 
UM WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WHAT 
BUTTONS WE'RE GONNA USE 
UM 
I THINK WE CAN DO IT IF UH WE USE CONVENTIONAL BATTERIES AND NOT HAVE SOLAR CELLS OR KINETIC 
UM AND THEN 
MAYBE IS SINGLE CURVED UH CASE 
BECAUSE WE MIGHT NEED TO TO BE CURVED FOR THE UH 
THUMB TO USE THE JOYST JOYSTICK EASILY 
UM 
AND THEN YOU'LL NEED THE ADVANCED CHIP OBVIOUSLY FOR THE L. C. D. 
YEP I'M FINISHED 
OH OKAY 
OH YEAH I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT 
THE UH RUBBER MATERIAL IS THE TYPE OF STRESS BALL MATERIAL NOT JUST NORMAL RUBBER 
FORGOT TO SAY THAT 
YEAH 
IF YOU'RE GOING WITH THE FRUIT AND VEG THING LOOKS LIKE A BANANA 
IF IF YOU WANNA DESIGN IT THAT WAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MONKEY 
THE U. S. B. FOR WHICH 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
BUT DIDN'T THEY JUST SAY IT'S JUST FOR T. V. OR ARE WE GONNA 
OKAY YEAH 
THEY'RE GOING WITH THE FASHION THING LIKE THE DESIGN SPONGY RUBBER 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S ME 
MM 
THERE'S ALSO A WATCH MOVES AROUND A GREAT DEAL MORE 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
UM I'M ACTUALLY GONNA BE BOLD AND GO OO GO STRAIGHT FOR RUBBER UM FOR REASONS I'LL GO INTO UH ONE MORE DETAIL 
MM 
YEP 
NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO WORK BETWEEN THE UH THE SLIDES AND THE UH 
AND THE WHITE BOARD 'CAUSE I ACTUALLY I HAVE SOME FAIRLY CONCRETE THINGS 
THIS TIME 
UH UM I WAS GIVEN A 
NO H. T. M. L. FILE GIVING UM VARIOUS IDEAS FROM UH FROM THEIR PREVIOUS REMOTE CONTROL DESIGNS AND PRETTY MUCH DECIDED TO JUST DUMP THEM ALL 
I WASN'T VERY IMPRESSED BY THEM AND THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO OUR UH NOTHING I SAW SEEMED TO MEET THE SORTS OF DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS THAT WE'RE GOING FOR TODAY 
UM SO WHAT I RA RATHER THAN LOOKING AT THEIR REMOTES UH RA OOMP BE BETTER TO SIMPLY LOOK AT THE HUMAN HAND 
UM AND TRY AND IF UM AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT A WAY OF LAYING OUT THE ELEMENTS WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED ON 
UM SO THAT IF OR A F IS THAT THE FINGER IS E EACH FINGER OR THUMB IS WHEREVER IT NEEDS TO BE ALREADY 
UM SO UH NEXT SLIDE IF YOU PLEASE 
UM AND WHAT WE'VE BASICALLY DECIDED ON WAS THE THE UM THE JOY UH THE JOYSTICK 
TWO FUNCTION BUTTONS AND THE L. C. D. JUST KEEP IT PAIRED DOWN TO THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM 
I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED THE UM THE NUMERIC KEYPAD BECAUSE IF YOU UM BECAUSE ONE OF THE MEANS THAT WE COULD HAVE AVAILABLE UM VIA VIA VIA THE L. C. D. IS ONE WHERE YOU SCROLL THROUGH CHANNELS 
SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING F AND BE BEAR IN MIND SINCE THIS ISN'T MEANT TO WORK FOR ME 
IF IF IF FOR AUDIO FOR DIGITAL OR UM OR FOUR OR FOR CABLE WHATEVER YOU'RE BASICALLY LOOKING AT FOUR OR FIVE TERRESTRIAL CHANNELS 
AND THEN UM YOUR V. C. UH AND THEN THE CHANNEL THROUGH YOUR V. C. R. AND OR D. V. D. PLAYER 
AND OUR UM BOX 
SO IT'S NOT I'M NOT REALLY EXCESSIVELY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT 
YOU MUST HAVE TWO TWO MODES BASIC MODE WHERE UM THE JOYSTICK'S UH LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT FOR CHANNELS 
UP DOWN FOR VOLUME UM AND THE UH UH AND THE MENU MODE FOR UH FURTHER FUNCTIONS 
UM NOW THE REASON I WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN USING RUBBER FOR THIS IS THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HIGHLY ERGONOMIC DESIGN 
UM IT NEEDS TO BE ERGONOMIC FOR LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE 
UM SO YOU 
MM-HMM 
YES ABSOLUTELY 
UM BASI BASICALLY WHAT I BASICALLY WHAT THE WHITE BE HAVING UM I WOULD SAY THE THE WHOLE THING ARTICULATED AT TWO POINTS 
SO THAT IF YOU IF YOU'RE HANDING IT FROM A LEF UH LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED USER YOU CAN ADJUST IT IS THAT THE UM THE L. C. THE L. C. D. AND THE UH 
THE JOYSTICK WOULD BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
AND ALSO THIS IS A RATHER NICER DE UH DESIGN GIMMICK THAT THE THE UM YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THING YOU KNOW IT SHOULD HAVE SORT OF ORGANIC FEEL IT TO THAT IT SHOULD BE 
YOU KNOW SOFT TO TOUCH AND 
CAN BE MOVED AROUND ALL NICE 
UM OKAY ON IT IN AT THE NEXT UH AT THE NEXT SLIDE 
OKAY 
YEAH 'KAY BASICALLY UM 
I CAN ADD PRETTY PICTURES TO THIS 
THE UM 
ASSUMING THE HAND THE HAND TO BE IN ABOUT SORT OF THIS POSITION UM HOL UH HOLDING THE REMOTE 
THE UM THE JOYSTICK UNIT SHOULD REST OVER THE UH THE JOINT OF THE OF OF THE UH FOUR FINGER IS THAT IT'S DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE FOR THE THUMB 
UM AND IT WOULD NEED TO THERE WOULD NEED TO BE A IT WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED JUST BELOW THAT IS THAT IT COULD BE SWITCHED AROUND FOR UH LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED USERS 
SO 
YOU THEN HAVE A GRIP SECTION THAT CAN BE MORE OR LESS THE SAME IRRESPECTIVE OF HANDEDNESS 
YOU JUST HAVE BIG TWO BIG BUTTONS THAT COVER MOST OF THE OR IS IT CAN IN THE UPPER PART 
NO FOR THE FOUR FINGER ONE FOR THE MIDDLE FINGER 
UM AND THAT 
TH THIS PART HERE IS THE JOYSTICK 
THIS WOULD BE THE ACTUAL GRIP 
PROBABLY WHERE YOU'D WANT TO HAVE THE BATTERY AS WELL 
THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY THE BULKIEST PART 
AND YOU THEN HAVE TO THE UH AT THE BOTTOM THE L. C. D. AND THIS WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED AS WELL 
AND BASICALLY I'D WANT THIS AT REST HERE RIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE WORST 
SO IT WOULD FIT JUST NICELY IN THE HAND 
AND AGAIN THIS PART COULD BE 
ROTATED SO IT CAN 
SO SO SO THAT IT CAN BE ADJUSTED TO EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED USER 
UM 
SO THE T UH THE TOP FUNCTION BUTTON IN BASIC MODE WOULD BE THE ON OFF SWITCH AND MENU MODE WOULD BE THE ENTER BUTTON 
AND THEN THE BOTTOM FUNCTION BUTTONS SWITCHES BETWEEN BETWEEN MODES 
UM NOW PROGRAMMING IT ACTUALLY THI THIS IS ONE THING I'VE FOUND WITH UM THE REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROL 
PROGRAMMING THEM CAN BE A RIGHT PAIN 
SO I THOUGHT THE THE SIMPLEST WAY AROUND THAT WOULD BE TO HAVE UM 
A CABLE TO CONNECT IT AT THE COMPUTER SOME SOME FAIR IV FAIRLY FAIRLY SIMPLE SOFTWARE ON THE COMPUTER JUST SO THAT YOU IN YOUR COMPUTER JUST SO THAT YOU COULD UM PR PROGRAM IT IT A RATHER IN A RATHER MORE COMFORTABLE INTERFACE 
AND YOU COULD DOWNLOAD PROGRAMS FOR IT FROM UH FOR UH T. V. S FROM ALL SORT OF MAIN MANUFACTURERS 
UM THOUGH YOU I IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO HAVE UH HAVE A UM UH HAVE A UH HAVE A MODE FOR PROGRAMMING IT WITHOUT THE COMPUTER 
UH JUST IN CASE THERE ARE THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE LEFT OUT THERE WHO DON'T HAVE THEM YET 
UM 
BUT UH 
YEAH 
THAT'S THAT'S MY IDEA 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH ACTUALLY IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF CHANNELS THE NUMBER KEYPAD CAN BE QUITE ANNOYING AS WELL 
BECAU IT'S YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT UH YOU KNOW WHAT NUMBER'S THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL OR WHATEVER 
IT'S JUST IRRITATING 
BUT IF YOU UH BUT BUT BUT IF YOU HAVE A UM BUT IF YOU HAVE A MENU STRUCTURE THEN YOU CAN SUB GROUP THEM 
SO YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH I I WOULD SAY DEFINITELY 
I MEAN I MEAN I MEAN THE THE IDEA OF HAVING TO SORT OF ARTICULATED I TH THERE WOULD BE BASICALLY TWO POINTS OF ARTICULATION 
WE UM ONE BELOW AND ONE ABOVE THE UM THE UH THE MAIN SORT OF GRIP 
SO 
MM 
I D I DON'T TH I DON'T THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A A STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS 
I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A FIRM S SUB STRUCTURE YOU CAN THEN INCORPORATE ARTICULATION INTO THAT 
IF YOU THEN HAVE A SORT OF OUTER SKIN OF MM FLEXIBLE SPONGY RUBBER THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT AS YOU KNOW VERY MUCH YOU KNOW 
ORGANIC AND I THINK WOULD LIKE RATHER CO I MEAN MI RATHER COOL 
I MEAN MY DRAWING THERE DOESN'T DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE 
IT MAKES IT MAKES IT LIKE MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A VIBRATOR THAN A THAN A UH THEN A REMOTE CONTROL BUT UH 
MM-HMM 
MAKE IT HARDER TO LOSE AS WELL 
I TH UH I MEAN IF IT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD PERHAPS BE PROGRAMMABLE THOUGH MAYBE HAVE MONKEY AS DEFAULT 
UM 
MM-HMM 
WELL BASI BASICALLY THE UM FOR F FOR UH I MEAN E EACH MANUFACTURER WILL HAVE A PARTIC WILL HAVE A PARTICULAR COMMAND SET THAT UH THE T. V. RESPONDS TO 
IT'S NOT SIMPLY A MATTER OF FREQUENCY 
SO UM 
USUALLY WHAT'S DONE IS YOU HAVE THIS BIG BOOKLET FULL OF DIFFERENT POSSI YOU'LL HAVE ALL OF THEM SORT OF PROGRAMMED IN AT THE UH REMOTE 
AND YOU'LL HAVE THIS LITTLE BOOKLET OF CODES Y THEN FIND YOUR UM UM UH FIND YOUR MANUFACTURER AND TRY THE DIFFERENT CODES THAT 
COME UNDER THAT MANUFACTURER'S NAME 'TIL YOU FIND THE RIGHT ONE 
IT'S 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
SO THAT'S THAT'S QUITE ANNOYING AND WE PROBABLY WOULD STILL HAVE TO DO THAT 
BUT IF WE HAD UM SOME SORT OF HOOK UP TO YOUR COMPUTER IS AN OPTION THEN IF YOU'VE GOT A COMPUTER YOU CAN AVOID THAT 
RATHER IRRITATING THING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM BOOKLET 
SOME PAGES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT IT'S A BUT IT'S A NUISANCE 
AND IT'S A NUISANCE VERY CLOSE TO THE TO ME TO ACTUALLY PURCHASING IT SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE THINKING ABOUT 
IF YOU IF THERE'S W I IF THERE'S NO NO THE SHOP THAT'S THAT SAYS IT CAN AVOID MUCH OF THAT NUISANCE YOU MIGHT BE FAVOURABLY INCLINED TOWARDS IT 
UM MM 
MM 
UM WELL I I THINK OTHER THAN GE GETTING A SORT OF MORE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING FORM FOR IT 
UM M MOST OF THE SORT OF LAYOUT DESIGN DECISIONS ARE ARE MADE I WOULD SAY 
UM BUT THEN AGAIN THE UM THE MENU STRUCTURE TO TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT THAT'S GONNA VARY ACCORDING TO THE MODEL OF TELEVISION 
AND ALSO ANY CUSTOMISATIONS THAT THE USER MIGHT WISH TO INCORPORATE 
SO UM AND ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT HAVING AN L. C. D. AND A MENU STRUCTURE IS THAT THERE IS THAT FLEXIBILITY TO IT 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH I MEAN IT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE OTHER THING I MEAN IT I MEAN IT WOULD NEED TO UH IT WOULD NEED TO HAVE UM SOME SORT OF ONE BOARD MEMORY ANYWAY 
UM F FOR ONE FOR ONE THING BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THE MENU SYSTEM SHOULD BE UM UH I MEAN ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TERRIBLY COMPLICATED IF IT'S JUST CONTROLLING ONE DEVICE THE MENU SYSTEM OUGHT TO BE UM 
O OUGHT TO BE CUSTOMISABLE AND UH 
MM-HMM 
HOW UH HOW UH HOW YOU WANT SAY THE UM THE THE MENU STRUCTURE FOR FLICKING THROUGH CHANNELS IF YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF CHANNELS 
THAT SORT OF THING 
YEAH 
ARE WE GOING TO BE SUPPLIED WITH THE CLAY IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW 
WHERE IS THE CLAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
I TH I THINK I WOULD LARGELY WANT TO ACTUALLY STEER CLEAR OF THE WHOLE SORT OF FRUIT AND VEG THING 
BU BUT UM BUT THE SPONGY IDEA I LIKE 
I LOOK AT A LOT 
I HAVING IT I HAVING TO SORT OF BR BRIGHT YELLOW I THINK THAT'S QUITE A GOOD IDEA THOUGH MAYBE WE COULD HAVE OPTIONS FOR COLOURS AS WELL 
AND AGAIN THIS HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING HARDER TO LOSE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
I WAS LIKE LIKE I SAID BEFORE I I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE R. R. ON THE UH IN THE TOP FUNCTION BUTTON 
OH 
COST US 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TITANIUM THE REALLY STRONG METAL TITANIUM 
SO IT INTO ALSO IT'S EXPENSIVE 
TWO CURVES 
AND AN ADVANCED CHIP FOR THE L. C. D. 
SO THAT DID I 
ADVANCED LIKE THREE EIGHT SIX ADVANCE 
OKAY 
OKAY SURE 
MM IF WE ONLY HAVE TWELVE POUNDS FIFTY 
TWELVE EUROS NOT EVEN TWELVE POUNDS 
TWELVE EUROS WHAT'S THAT LIKE EIGHT POUNDS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT NINE POUNDS 
OKAY THAT'S GOOD POINT 
I ALSO HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR RUBBER 
BASED ON MY RESEARCH 
DIGITAL 
SO THIS THE JOYSTICK 
OKAY 
MM 
MM 
'KAY 
WE GO 
OKAY 
SO UH TO GATHER MY RESEARCH TWO BASIC METHODS 
WE COMPARED UH WHETHER PEOPLE WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO DO A LOT OF STUFF OR THEY WANT TO TO LOOK COOL 
AND THEN WE WE RESEARCH UH FASHION TRENDS IN EUROPE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE NEW BLACK YOU KNOW IS IT GOES 
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE 
UH WE FOUND IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE PEOPLE WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO LOOK COOL MORE THAN THEY WANT TO TO TO BE COOL 
SO NO THEY WANT TO TO DO A LOT OF GOOD AS THEY WANT TO TO LOOK LIKE IT DOES A LOT 
AND IF IT DOES DO A LOT THAT'S A BONUS BUT THEY DON'T CARE SO MUCH YOU KNOW 
THEY WANT TO TO BE THAT'S SENDS A BIT LIKE A CONTRADICTION 
TECHNOLOGY TECHNICAL TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
PEOPLE WANT TO TO BE THAT BUT IS STILL THEY CARE MORE ABOUT THE WAY IT LOOKS THAN WHAT IT DOES 
SO LIKE THE INTERFACE IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
AND EASY TO USE 
IT IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT UH FROM THE SECOND POINT AT THE THIRD POINT IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT I MEAN THE SECOND POINT IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT IS THE THIRD POINT 
PEOPLE WANT IT 
I SEE IT HAS TO BE COOLER THAN EASY TO SEE YOU KNOW IF IT HAS THE NEWEST FEATURES 
EVEN IF IT'S DIFFICULT TO USE PREFER TO TO HAVE THE NEWEST FEATURES 
AND IF IT'S EASY TO USE THAT'S A BONUS 
THE FASHION NOW THIS IS SEEMS A BIT ODD TO ME 
BUT FRUIT AND VEG IS THE NEW IS THE NEW BLACK FOR FURNITURE FOR CLOTHES FOR SHOES 
HOW THAT RELATES TO A REMOTE CONTROL I DON'T KNOW 
BUT I I SEE I COME ON IT THAT IN THE NEXT IN THE NEXT SLIDE 
SPONGY 
I'VE ALS I'VE BEEN SAYING EVERYTHING'S THE NEW BLACK 
WELL SPONGY'S THE NEW BLACK AS WELL 
SO WE HAVE THE CHOICE BETWEEN RUBBER AND PLASTIC 
IF IT'S THE TYPE OF RUBBER THAT YOU CAN SQUEEZE YOU KNOW IT'S SPONGY THEN CAN I SKIP THE REST 
OKAY 
OKAY SO KINDA SPONGY MATERIAL 
SO UM SO MY PERSONAL OPINION 
UM WE WANT SOMETHING FANCY AND TECHNI TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE OBVIOUSLY 
BUT WHAT WE WHAT WE NEED IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROM THE AFTER THAT LOOKS COOL THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT 
YOU KNOW THAT'S EVERYONE HAS A WHITE REMOTE CONTROL BLACK REMOTE CONTROL YOU NEED SOMETHING COOL 
LIKE TITANIUM IS COOL BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE 
AND MAYBE IT'S A BIT OF OVERKILL FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
UM NOW THE FRUIT AND VEG OPTIONS THERE WE WE GO ON THAT DIRECTION OR WE STAY TOTALLY AWAY FROM IT 
UM I MEAN THE RESEARCH DID COME UP WITH FRUIT AND VEG SO MAYBE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR IT'S THE UP TO THE INTERFACE GUY 
SO IF WE STAY AWAY FROM IT AS YOU KNOW STAY AWAY FROM IT 
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA GO ALONG WITH IT THEN IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE LIKE AN APPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ARE A KIWI FRUIT 
IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE 
I SAY POTATO PEELER BUT I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE A HAVE A MUCH COOLER IDEA THEN I D 
SO I THINK COOL IS THE OKAY 
FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT A SPONGY REMOTE CONTROL 
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE 
I'VE SEEN PLASTIC REMOTE CONTROLS 
I THINK MAYBE THEY WERE 
I DON'T KNOW BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THEY FIRST COME UP WITH REMOTE CONTROLS THEY HAD A REASON FOR IT BEING 
STURDY YOU KNOW 
FOR BEING STRONG AND STURDY 
SO UM IF WE WANT SOMETHING STRONG AND STURDY I SAY STAY WITH PLASTIC OR TITANIUM BUT IF WE GO WITH SPONGY 
WE CAN STRESS THAT YOU CAN DROP THIS AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S SPONGY MATERIAL IT'S NOT GONNA BREAK YOU KNOW 
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THE L. E. D. AND THE LIGHTS ARE GONNA FIT INTO A SPONGY MATERIAL BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE COMPLETELY SQUEEZABLE 
SO HOW DO THINGS FIT IT 
AND IF WE ARE GONNA USE SPONGY WE CAN SAY IT'S LONG LASTING YOU KNOW IT'S DAMAGE RESISTANT AND STUFF LIKE THAT IS 
SO JUST TO SUMMARISE PEOPLE WANT STUFF THAT'S COOL THAT'S THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COOL 
AND IF IT IS COOL THEN THAT'S A BONUS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE UM PEOPLE LIKE FRUIT AND VEG 
WE CAN EITHER GO DOWN THAT ALLEY OR STAY TOTALLY AWAY FROM IT 
PEOPLE LIKE SPONGY MATERIAL 
IF WE'RE GONNA USE SPONGY MATERIAL WE HAVE TO THINK OF HOW PRACTICAL TO USE AND HOW WE CAN FURTHER PROMOTE THAT IDEA 
AND ALSO THIS WAS THIS YEAR 
SO THINGS CHANGE ALL THE TIME EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW THEY THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THIS YEAR THIS IS THE NEW BLACK 
WELL NEXT YEAR SOMETHING ELSE IS GONNA BE THE NEW BLACK AND WE'RE STUCK WITH LAST YEAR'S FRUIT AND VEG TYPE STUFF 
'KAY 
THAT'S ME 
THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
YOU CAN INCORPORATE NAMES INTO THE MENU 
OKAY 
EVEN NEWS MUSIC 
LIKE THEY DO AN UH SKY DIGITAL KINDA 
YEAH 
OKAY 
COURSE NOT 
SURE YEAH 
SURE 
THE ONES FOR WHEN YOU LOSE THE BANANA UM F YEAH 
FOR WHEN YOU LOSE THE REMOTE CONTROL IT COULD BE LIKE A A MONKEY NOISE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT RATHER THAN A STANDARD BEEP BEEP 
YOU YOU KNOW YOU LOSE THE MONKEY THE BANANA 
YOU YOU LOSE THE BANANA YOU PRESS A BUTTON AND YOU HEAR LIKE MONKEY SCREAMS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT DIRECT YOU TOWARDS THE BANANA 
SO UH I WAS GONNA TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAMMABLE REMOTE CONTROL 
NOW I THINK IT'D BE COOL IF YOU HAD ONE REMOTE CONTROL THAT COULD WORK WITH ALL T. V. S 
YOU KNOW YOU SEE YOU CLICK A BUTTON AND IT FINDS THE FREQUENCY THAT 
WORKS WITH YOUR PARTICULAR TELEVISION 
BUT WHY YOU'D NEED TO PROGRAM IT LIKE AS AS A STANDARD FEATURE I I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S BECAUSE TELEVISIONS THEY DON'T GIVE THE REMOTE CONTROL ANY TYPE OF FEEDBACK WHEN YOU SEND IT 
OKAY 
SO IT IS IT ACTUALLY A BOOK OF NAMES TO DIGITS OR IS IT LIKE A FEW PAGES 
I WAS JUST THINKING IF WE WERE TO STORE THIS INFORMATION SOME TYPE OF MAPPING 
THIS PERSON PROBABLY NEED TO USE THIS FEATURE LIKE ONCE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU FIRST BY THE REMOTE CONTROL 
OR WHENEVER THEY BUY A NEW TELEVISION SO ONCE EVERY S 
YEAH AND IT'S 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH YOU SEE I DON'T SOME OF THESE THINGS KINDA LOGICALLY FOLLOW THE OTHERS 
HOW CAN T PRODUCT EVALUATION DOESN'T THAT COME AFTER ACTUALLY SEEN 
A PRODUCT PROTOTYPE 
OH THAT'S THE OKAY SURE SURE SURE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SURE 
AT THIS STAGE WE STILL HAVE NO NO TARGET AUDIENCE OR 
'KAY 
AND IT'S STYLISH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEP 
OKAY 
PROGRAMMABLE MEMORY AS WELL 
FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
WE'VE WE DEFINITELY TALKING SOME TYPE OF 
DIFFERENT 
BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOME TYPE OF FLASH MEMORY OR SOMETHING 
WELL SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO READ THE WHOLE THING ONCE THE BATTERIES ARE CHANGED YOU KNOW ONCE YOU TURN OFF THE POWER 
YEAH 
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES UH DIFFERENT SKINS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
SURE 
I IF IT WAS CUSTOMISABLE AS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND STUFF THAT DOES OPEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE INTERNATIONAL RIGHT 
SO 
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE IF YOU COULD 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THE FRUIT AND VEG 
THIS ONE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SURE 
I MEAN WE ARE TRYING TO PROMOTE A REMOTE CONTROL BUT WE WANNA KEEP THE COMPANY BRAND AS WELL SO 
I THINK SO IT 
SO 
THAT SHOULD HOPEFULLY DO THE TRICK UM 
'KAY 
SORRY ABOUT THE SMALL DELAY 
FALLING A LITTLE BIT BEHIND SCHEDULE 
AND THAT'S UH FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE 
OKAY 
SO JUST TO TRY AND ROUGHLY GO OVER WHAT WE AGREED ON THE LAST ONE UM 
WE'RE GONNA GO FOR SOMETHING UH UH HOW WAS IT 
UH THE NEW BLACK I BELIEVE 
UM SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD 'CAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE IN PREFERENCE TO ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY IN THE END THOUGH WE SHOULD NEVER AVOID FUNCTIONALITY OF COURSE 
UH MANY OF OUR COMPONENTS ARE GONNA BE STANDARD OFF THE SHELF 
BUT IT SEEMED LIKE WE WERE GONNA REQUIRE AT LEAST AN ADVANCED CHIP AND WE WERE STILL VERY MUCH FOR THE IDEA OF USING AN L. C. D. DISPLAY 
UM OTHER THINGS WERE WE WERE HOPING TO USE RUBBER MOST LIKELY GONNA BE DOUBLE CURVED ETCETERA 
OKAY 
SO UM DO IT YOUR HARD WORK WE MIGHT AS WELL LET THE UH TWO DESIGNERS GO FIRST AND UH SHOW US THE PROTOTYPE 
QUITE HOW THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS I'M NOT SURE ABOUT 
OKAY 
I'M AFRAID YEAH 
WE'LL GO INTO THAT A BIT MORE BUT PLEASE GO ON 
MM 
OKAY YEAH 
GREAT 
UM 
YEAH OKAY 
EXCELLENT WORK 
UM 
YEAH I BELIEVE SO 
SO I MEAN I DON'T THINK ANYBODY COULD ACTUALLY STOP A REMOTE BEING LOST 'CAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE HUMAN ELEMENT 
BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE'VE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT FINDING THE DAMN THING ONCE WE HAVE 
MM 
UM 
JUST BEFORE WE GO THROUGH ALL OF THE STEPS HERE UM WELL WHAT WE'LL DO IS 
UM IF WE CAN LOOK AT THE CRITERIA YOU'RE GONNA EVALUATE AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE PRODUCT EVALUATION OF THAT'S ALRIGHT 
YEAH SO THAT 
UM SO SO THERE ANYTHING HERE THAT YOU 
THAT YOU WANTED TO COVER IS IN THE CRITERIA THAT YOU'VE COVERED 
AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK PRETTY MUCH PROMPTLY TO THIS 
I SEE THERE ANY OF THESE CRITERIA THAT AND ANY EXPLAINING 
OR IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOUS THOUGHT THE REALLY WOULD STAND OUT COMPARED TO THE OTHERS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
ONE AND WHICH WE WILL DO VERY VERY SHORTLY 
UM 
OKAY 
SLIGHT PROBLEM WE HAD WAS THAT WE HAVE AN AMAZING FOUR EUROS OVER BUDGET FOR WHAT WE WERE HOPING TO DO 
UM MOST OF IT STEMS FROM THE EASE OF THE L. C. D. WHICH I THINK IN THE END ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT HALF OF OUR EXPENDITURE BECAUSE OF COURSE WE REQUIRED A CHIP AS WELL 
UM THE ONLY WAY TO GET THIS DOWN WAS THERE TO DITCH THE A L. C. D. 
IT WHICH POINT WE'VE REMOVED A LARGE PART OF HOW WE WERE GONNA INTERFACE REQUIRE MORE BUTTONS ETCETERA 
OR WHAT WE DID WAS THAT WE UM WE USE ONE I SEE I WAS QUICKLY GOING OVER IT WAS ALTERING THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE 
UM CHANGING IT TO PLASTIC AND A SOLID UNIT WITH A SINGLE CURVE DESIGN WOULD ALLOW US TO COME BACK INTO THE UM PROPOSED COSTS AND WE'RE JUST SCRAPING IT IN 
WE'VE GOT POINT TWO OF A EURO LEFT OVER THERE 
SO WE'RE JUST MANAGING IT REALLY 
EVEN THEN AS WELL UM THERE WAS NO CRITERIA TECHNICALLY DEFINED FOR A JOYSTICK AS I'VE USED WHAT I THINK'S APPROPRIATE 
WITH ANY LUCK THAT WON'T MEAN THAT WE'VE INCURRED MORE COST THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD IT 
IT BLOWS A LOT OF OUR REALLY GOOD IDEAS KIND OF SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE FOR EXAMPLE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A A. S. B. CONNECTION IS DEFINITELY NOT VIABLE NOW 
UM 
THAT SHOULD STILL BE VIABLE 
WE'VE GOT AN ADVANCED CHIP WE'VE GOT THE EASE OF THE L. C. D. 
AS BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES IS STILL VERY MUCH A POSSIBILITY 
UM BUT WHAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO DECIDE ON SO HOW WE'RE GONNA GO FROM HERE 
WE DO NEED TO TRY AND COME UP WITH AN IDEA WHICH COULD BE CONTINUED WITH OTHER PEOPLE OF AND BE 
UM 
WE CAN I CAN BRING THE EXCEL UP SHEET UP AND UH SHOW YOU IF YOU WISH UM 
I REALLY THINK SO M MUCH AS IT PAINS ME IS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO WITH PLASTIC AND SOME KIND OF SOLID DESIGN 
POSSIBLY MEANING THAT THE L. C. D. WOULDN'T BE IN THIS PERFECT PLACE 
IT MIGHT BE S STUCK LIKE SLIGHTLY BETWEEN WHAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR LEFT HANDED AND WHAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR A RIGHT HANDED PERSON 
OKAY 
IT VERY MUCH IS ABOUT MAKING CONCESSIONS UNFORTUNATELY 
UM 
UM AB AB AB IDEA SO YOU MEAN IN THE PLASTIC OR 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
YOU NOW HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION SO I D 
UM 
SO SO YOU CAN SEE HERE FOR EXAMPLE THE BATTERY 
REALLY NOT VERY LITTLE CHOICE IN THAT ONE 
WE'VE GONE FOR ONE OF THE CHEAPER OPTIONS AS WELL 
UNFORTUNATELY WE REQUIRE THE ADVANCED CHIP IF WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT WE'RE NEEDING IT 
I'VE SAID SINGLE CURVED 
WE REALLY DO NEED TO TO BE THAT WAY FOR THE ERGONOMICS OF IT 
UM PLASTIC FOR SOME REASON INCURS NO COST WHICH I'VE HAD IT VERY MUCH MAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT RUBBER'S ONLY GOT A VALUE OF TWO EUROS PER UNIT 
PROBLEM COMES HERE SO YOU CAN SEE IN THE INTERFACE 
UM 
IF I'VE READ THIS THING CORRECTLY THEN WE CAN SAVE POINT FIVE OF A ARE HERE IN THAT IT'S NOT PER PUSH BUTTON 
THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THEN A NUMERIC KEYPAD WOULD COME ON IT UM WHAT 
FOUR POINT FIVE EUROS WHICH IS AN AWFUL LOT SO THAT COULD WILL BE WRONG 
EVEN IF WE SAVE POINT FIVE THERE IT WOULD JUST MEAN THAT WE'RE MOST LIKELY PLACING IT IN ACTUALLY JUST GAINING A COLOUR FOR THE UNIT 
WHICH HAS HAD TO BE PUT IT ONE SIDE 
SO YOU CAN SEE 
THE EASE OF AN L. C. DISPLAY UM ADVANCED CHIP AND WHAT WOULD DETERMINE THE SCROLL WHEEL HERE AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S AN INTEGRATED SCROLL SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON THAT WASN'T QUITE WHAT I THINK THEY HAD IN MIND WITH A JOYSTICK 
I THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP WITH THE BEAN COUNTERS 
UM 
SO YOU CAN SEE I MEAN THAT'S TAKEN UP WELL OVER HALF OF THE PRICE 
SO UM I'M VERY MUCH OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS OF WHERE WE GO 
BUT BECAUSE WE NEED TO SHED WHAT WAS FOUR EUROS OFF OF THE UM THE PRICE OF FOR WHAT WE REALLY DESIRED 
THIS ONE COMES IN UNDER PRICE IS YOU CAN SEE ABOUT THIS WAS THE ON THAT SACRIFICED THE MATERIAL FOR THE CASE AND FOR THE ACTUAL CASE DESIGN 
OH NO WE HAVEN'T NOT 
THAT'LL IT LITERALLY WOULD JUST BE A BUTTON 
WE MIGHT HAVE TO 
IT LOOKS LIKE ALMOST NOTHING 
MM 
OH GOOD CALL I MISSED THAT 
THAT'S A VERY VALID POINT 
SO IF WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THE L. C. DISPLAY THEN THAT'S 
I BELIEVE SO YEAH 
THAT WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE IN KEEPING WITH THE UM THE FASHION STATEMENT AND SUCH YEAH 
BEING MANIPULATED BY THE JOYSTICK YEAH 
WHICH I'M DEFINING AS SCROLL WHEEL 
UM 
YEAH IT'S JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ACTUAL DEFINITION FOR WHAT A JOYSTICK MIGHT BE THAT 
THAT'S WHAT I'VE LABELLED IT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS EVALUATION 
IF WE REMOVE THE L. C. DISPLAY WE COULD SAVE OURSELVES 
A FAIR AMOUNT 
WHICH YOU COULD 
IT'S A SHAME 
WE SHOULD POSSIBLY HAVE 
IF WE COULD'VE INCREASED THE PRICE WE COULD'VE MANUFACTURED THAT AND WE COULD'VE GOT SOMETHING FAR CLOSER TO WHAT WE WERE HOPING TO 
AGAIN YOU'LL HAVE TO ARGUE WITH THE ACCOUNTANTS ON THAT ONE 
UM BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS MEETING I'M WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STICK WITH THESE FIGURES 
SO 
I WOULD SAY THAT IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THE GENERAL OPINION IS WE'RE GONNA KEEP THE L. C. DISPLAY 'CAUSE IT'S ABOUT WHAT REALLY SEPARATES US 
DESPITE THE COST IT'S GONNA INCUR 
UM 
ARE PEOPLE MAYBE NOT HAPPY WITH BUT ARE WILLING TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS ONE GOING FOR A PLASTIC SOLID CASE TO KEEP THE L. C. D. 
IT'S HARD TO TELL 
UM I WOULD SAY THAT YOU'RE AT LEAST GONNA TAKE DOUBLE CURVED AND EVEN THEN I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF THAT'S INCORPORATING THE IDEA OF ARTICULATION 
SINGLE CURVED WITH ARTICULATION 
BUT THE CURVES ALL O OVER HAND SO IT 
WE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY SAVE A LOT BY REDUCING IT ANYWAY SO I MEAN FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS MEETING MAYBE WE CAN STATE THAT SINGLE CURVE STILL ALLOWS ARTICULATION 
UM UNLESS WE HEAR OTHERWISE WE COULD GO AHEAD WITH THAT PROPOSAL 
WHICH IS WHAT WE CAN GET INTO NOW 
AS LONG AS AS ARE WE GONNA SAY WE WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE TIME AS WELL BUT WE'RE GONNA SAY UM SINGLE CURVED DESIGN 
IT COULD WILL BE ABOUT IT A COST OF 
OKAY YEAH WE'LL DEFINITELY WON'T GO WITH THAT ONE 
YEAH THAT'S VOICE RECOGNITION IS 
UM 
SO OKAY YEAH BATTERY DEFINITELY 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT UNLESS WE CAN MANAGE TO PUT IT IN UNDER POINT TWO EUROS UM 
MAYBE EVEN SLIGHT WELL UH YEAH PRETTY MUCH POINT TWO EUROS I'D SAY 
SO WE'LL LEAVE THAT ONE FOR NOW 
WE'LL JUST HAVE 
IT'S UH A CASE OF UM 
I'M UH SLIGHTLY UNSURE 
NO POINT FIVE OF A OR FOR ONE PUSH BUTTON DOESN'T SOUND QUITE RIGHT 
SO MAYBE IT'S A CASE OF A PUSH BUTTON SO MAYBE ONE OR MORE 
UM 
IT WHICH POINT OF 
WELL YOU GOT POINT FIVE THERE 
IT'S LITERALLY A CASE OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS CORRECT 
I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF THEY'RE I DON'T THINK THEY MEAN POINT FIVE EUROS PER BUTTON 
SO 
THERE WE GO 
BLACK'S PROBABLY THE NORMAL COLOUR YOU'D SAY YEAH 
I QUITE LIKE THAT COLOUR THAT YOU'RE FETCHING THERE IT'S UH DEFINITELY FOR MAKE IT GLOW IN THE DARK EVEN BETTER 
SO 
WELL WE GO WITH THAT THEN 
IT'S NOT AND WE CAN SEE WE'LL COME BACK TO UH YOUR EVALUATION WHICH YOU'RE PROBABLY NOW GOING TO OPEN S BUT THERE WE GO 
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA UM YOU WANT TO GO MAYBE A BIT QUICKLY AS WELL I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH TIME 
WE'VE NOT HIT THE FIVE MINUTE MARK WARNING YET BUT 
TEN 
MM MM FOUR 
THERE 
MM 
OKAY 
TWO BUTTONS 
YEAH 
I'D SAY WE'RE DOING WELL THERE 
MM-HMM 
SO UH MODELS THE 
I'D 
YEAH 
WHICH IS A SHAME 
MM 
I'D BE TEMPTED WITH THEIR YEAH 
WE'LL GET PANNED ON THE NEXT ONE ANYWAY 
YEAH WE 
IT IS YEAH 
DON'T BLAME THEM 
UM BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE'VE MINIMALISED THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS AND SUCH 
PLASTIC IT SUCKS 
BUT IT'S NO WORSE THAN ANY OF THE OTHER PL REMOTE CONTROLS WE HAVE 
LIKE YELLOW YEAH 
IT WOULD ALSO HELP KEEP THE THE PRODUCT PLACEMENT S YEAH 
SO IT INSPIRED BY CLOTHING FASHION 
YES 
IT'S KIND O IT PROBABLY 
WELL I MEAN IT'S PROBABLY MORE FRUIT AND VEG THAN MOST OTHER THINGS OUT THERE BAR FRUIT AND VEG IS WHAT FOUR 
SO THAT BEING TOO GENEROUS 
OH DEAR 
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK YOURSELF 
WELL IT'S KIND OF CURVED AND WE CAN MAKE IT YELLOW AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH BANANA LOOK 
SO IT'S GOT A CURVE IT IT 
UM I DO YOU THINK I'M STRETCHING THE UH THE EASE OF THE BANANA 
IT'S NOT BAD AND CONSIDERING THE DON'T PICK THE PEN 
UM 
YOU UH AND YOU'VE KNOCKED BATTERIES IT 
UM RIGHT OKAY IT'S CONSIDERING THE PRICE WE HAD TO GET THIS ONE 
TO HAVE A POSITIVE YOU KNOW EVEN BASED ON THE FOUR OF AS BEING HEAVILY BIASED UM 
IT WAS GONNA BE QUITE HARD TO GET ANYTHING STANDING OUT I'D SAY POSSIBLY BASED ON 
UM THE THE COST FEATURES 
MAYBE IT'S BEEN TARGETED 
HIDE IT IN THE FRUIT BASKET 
PROBABLY THE PEOPLE TECHNOLOGICALLY 
THEY'RE USUALLY THE ONES THAT BUY POINTLESS STUFF 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UM DON'T KNOW HOW LO MUCH LONGER WE'VE GOT 
AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES I THINK 
UM QUICKLY WE'LL POP ONTO PROJECT EVALUATION 
UM 
SO 
WE'VE GOT THIS UH FOUR CRITERIA HERE FOR UH SATISFACTION 
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO ME 
UM DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINIONS ON ANY OF THEM 
FOR EXAMPLE UM WE'LL WORK BACKWARDS I SUPPOSE 
THE ABILITY TO WORK ON THIS PROJECT USING THE TECHNOLOGY WE'VE BEEN PRESENTED WITH 
UM PEOPLE MADE GOOD EASE OF THE 
UH PEN AND PAPER 
I WOULD SAY 
I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE ADVANTAGE FOR US USING A DIGITAL PEN MIGHT BE 
MM 
IT MUST 
IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE PAPER'S STILL A HEAVY CONSIDERATION FOR TAKING NOTES 
SO MAYBE THIS IS LITERALLY JUST A WAY AROUND IT 
UM I DUNNO 
HOW ARE PEOPLE SATISFIED WITH THE TEAMWORK WE'VE MANAGED TO DISPLAY TODAY 
LEADERSHIP 
SO MUCH SO CAN BE LEADERED IN THIS UH THING 
UM LAST ONE WE'VE GOT IS ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 
NOW I THINK WE GOT 
YEAH I THINK OF IN THE END IDEAS THAT CAN BE USED SADLY 
NOT AS MUCH THAT WE WEREN'T FULL OF IDEAS ABOUT OF ONES THAT ARE GONNA ALLOW US TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE THING 
IT'S A BIT OF A PITY 
UM I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE ON THAT 
I THINK WE NEEDED A LARGER BUDGET 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO ME YOUR A M PRODUCT MAYBE AT THE TECHNOLOGICAL KIND OF SECTOR 
THEN YOU CAN AFFORD TO MAYBE JACK THE PRICE UP SLIGHTLY FROM WHAT IT IS 
BECAUSE THEY WILL PAY OUTRAGEOUS CASH TO 
FIRST ON THE MARKET 
MM 
IT COULD EVEN 
THAT'S TRUE YEAH 
UM I SUPPOSE THESE ARE ALL THAT WILL HAVE TO BE TAKEN UP WITH A IT A DIFFERENT GROUP TO I GUESS 
SO IT A THE COSTS INVOLVED 
BUT I MEAN 
WE'VE GOT A A PROTOTYPE 
SO I DUNNO I I THINK IT'S GONE OKAY TODAY CONSIDERING THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE 
HAD TO OUR DISPOSAL AND UM SUCH 
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MEAN WE COULD HAVE COME UP WITH A LOT MORE SOLID DESIGN IN THE AND I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE 
IT IS VERY MUCH A PITY TO ME GET SO FAR INTO THE STAGE AND THEN FIND OUT THAT MAYBE SOME OF YOUR IDEAS ARE JUST A BIT TOO EXPENSIVE 
ALWAYS HARD TO TELL UNTIL YOU KNOW THE COSTS 
UM 
OKAY 
OR THE COSTS WITHIN BUDGET 
WELL THEY ARE NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR SLIGHTLY LESS THAN CAPABLE PRODUCT 
WE'VE EVALUATED IT AND WE CAN SAY THAT WE CAME OUT WITH A VALUE OF THREE 
IT'S YEAH 
AND THEN THE FINAL ONE WHERE YOU GET TO CALL IT HAL 
BUT WE'LL GO INTO THAT LATER 
RIGHT UM SO THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO TO ADD UM 
ANYTHING THEY THINK THAT'S NOT BEEN COVERED BEFORE I QUICKLY WRITE UP A FINAL REPORT 
UM I DUNNO I MEAN WE'VE GOT A PRODUCT 
WE MAYBE AREN'T AS HAPPY WITH IT SO WE'D LIKE TO BE BUT 
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING WE THINK WE CAN MAYBE STICK ONTO THE THE MARKET AND SELL 
AND OF COURSE SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN AVOIDING TALKING ABOUT 'CAUSE IF WE'VE NO INFORMATION IS SELLING THEM DIRECTLY AT THE MANUFACTURERS 
THERE IS A HUGE MARKET 
I MEAN WE'VE BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON IT BUT WE'VE NO MORE KNOWLEDGE THEN THERE'S LITTLE WE CAN SAY IN THAT 
YEAH 
SO UM UNLESS ANYBODY'S GOT ANYTHING THEY'D LIKE TO ADD 
WE CAN MAYBE ROUND THIS UP SLIGHTLY EARLIER THEN WE'D NEED TO AND THEN WE CAN FINISH UP THE WRITING AND SUCH 
YEAH 
OH THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION 
THAT A QUESTION WE CAN ASK 
UM OBVIOUSLY IT'S GONNA BE BULKIER THAN HOW IT LOOKS BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE FLAT ON ONE SIDE 
SO THE L. C. D. WILL BE S STICKING DOWN LIKE THIS WON'T IT 
'CAUSE IT YOU CAN'T GET IT CURVED 
UH BECAUSE OF COSTS 
AND IT'S PLASTIC AS WELL SO IT WON'T BE AS COMFORTABLE ON THE HAND 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH 
WHAT ABOUT WHAT IF THE THE VOLUME ON THE T. V. 'S TURNED UP MASSIVELY AND UH YOU JUST WANNA TURN DOWN THE VOLUME CAN'T FIND REMOTE 
SUPPOSE YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE T. V. AND DO IT MANUALLY 
MM 
LIKE YOU YOU WOULDN'T HEAR THE SPEAKER 
MM 
THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
FASHION 
SO BASICALLY THE ONLY NEW THING IS THE L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE NOW 
UH AND JOYSTICK YEAH 
SO 
THE L. C. D. BASICALLY IS THE BIG SELLING POINT OF 
THE REMOTE 
BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT UH ORIGINAL THOUGH ISN'T IT 
IT CAN BE S YEAH IT CAN STILL BE SINGLE CURVED BUT 
YOU JUST 
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED FOR THE JOYSTICK I THINK THOUGH 
COSTS FOUR 
YEAH 
ARE WE GOING FOR A SPECIAL COLOUR AT ALL 
WELL I WAS FOR A CASE 
OR HAD YOU ALREADY INCORPORATED THAT 
THINK IT'S TEN MINUTES LEFT 
SPECIAL COLOUR 
THERE 
ARE WE GOING ON ONE 
I'D SAY WE GO TWO 'CAUSE LIKE IF THE FANCIEST WOULD BE THE DOUBLE CURVED 
WOULDN'T IT 
WITH THE ARTICULATORS 
WITH BELLS ON IT 
NO NEED FOR TELETEXT 
FIVE 
SIX 
SIX 
PUT A LEOPARD PRINT ON IT 
YEAH WE GOTTA 
I'D SAY THE COLOUR OF THE BORDER THERE WORLD YOU'D FIND THAT THAT'S THAT'D STAND OUT 
LOGO BRAND 
MM 'KAY 
YELLOW COURGETTE 
WELL THIS THIS WHAT WE'RE GONNA AT THIS IS THEIR MOTTO LIKE 
AND WE'RE WE'RE NOT DOING WELL IN IT 
YEAH I'LL GO WITH FIVE 
'S BAD DESIGN THAT THING 
MM YEAH 
WELL IT DEPENDS WHO YOUR WHO'S WHAT THE TARGET PEOPLE ARE LIKE YOU'D SAY 
MAYBE THE FASHION CONSCIOUS 
WOMEN WOULD BE GOING UH LOOK AT THAT 'S COOL IT LOOKS LIKE A IT'S 
YELLOW LOOKS LIKE A BANANA IT'S COOL IT'S GOTTA LOOK GOOD IN THE SITTING ROOM 
RATHER THAN THE L. C. D. WHEREAS UH MORE TECHNICAL LIKE LIKE MORE UH PEOPLE IN WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY IT'S GOOD 
IT'S GOT AN L. C. D. SCREEN 'S ONLY GOT TWO BUTTONS AND A JOYSTICK 
SO 
WHICH WHICH KIND OF PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE 
LIKELY TO BUY IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
GOOD 
VERY GOOD 
WE'RE BURS BURSTING WITH CREATIVITY 
AND THE PRICE WAS LIKE IT WAS TWICE THE 
W ASSEMBLY COST 
AND WOULD TO HAVE TO BE TWICE THAT 
IT COULD BE LIKE COULDA HAD THE ASSEMBLY LIKE MAYBE FIFTEEN EURO 
WE'LL STILL SETTLE FOR TWENTY FIVE 
MAYBE 
IN THE BEGINNING YEAH 
OKAY IT'S A 
I THINK IF WE BOTH STEP UP AND UH 
OUTLINE OUR IDEAS 
OKAY 
NOW 
DO UH DOING THE PROTOTYPE GAVE US A BIT MORE INSIGHT INTO THE ERGONOMICS OF THE DESIGN 
UM FOR ONE THING 
IT TURNED OUT THAT THE ONLY POINT AT WHICH IT NEEDS TO BE ARTICULATED FOR HANDEDNESS IS UM SO UH I SEE DOWN HERE FOR THE UH L. E. D. 
SO IT TURNED OUT THE WHOLE THING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIGHT TO LEFT HAND FAIRLY WELL FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF OPERATING THE UH FUNCTION BUTTONS AND JOYSTICK 
THOUGH IT MIGHT BE AN IDEA TO BE ABLE TO A ADJUST THE POSITIONS FOR THE BASE OF THE JOYSTICK JUST A LITTLE BIT FOR UH 
JU JUST A THOUGHT 
YOU COULD SIMPLY HAVE A SLIGHTLY OVOID SHAPED JOYSTICK THAT COULD THEN JUST BE TURN UH TWISTED ROUND 
SO THAT THE UH STICKY UH SO THAT THE ABOUT THAT STICKS OUT A BIT MORE AS IN ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER 
BUT AS YOU SEE YOU USE WITH THE UH WITH HOLDING IT IN THE LEFT HAND 
THE L. UH THE L. C. D. IS NOWHERE USEFUL IS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED 
UH IF WE'RE GOING TO RETAIN ERGONOMIC DESIGN 
UM NOW I I GOT YOUR NOTE ABOUT UH KEEPING THE COST DOWN 
YEAH 
THIS DESIGN COULD BE DONE WITH UM 
WITH UH PLASTIC CASING 
THOUGH I WOULD RECOMMEND AROUND THE GRIP PART HERE IN THE MIDDLE 
HAVING MAYBE JUST A RUBBER GRIP OVER THAT WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR A SLIGHTLY MORE SORT OF BIO MORPHIC FORM AND A BIT MORE ERGONOMIC AS WELL 
SO FOR THE UM 
SO FOR THE SINGLE CURVE 
UM WELL THIS EDGE AND THIS EDGE LIKE I SAY IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME CURVATURE TO IT BUT IT'S NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY 
REALLY THE CURVE THAT'S MOST NEEDED IS THE UNDERSIDE SO THAT THE JO SO THAT THE JOYSTICK RESTS OVER THE THE EDGE OF THE HAND LIKE THIS 
UM AND YOU HAVE 
THE UH TRANSMITTER HERE AND A WEE SPEAKER FOR THE UH FOR THE UH FOR THE UH OF UH FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL FINDER 
SO 
ANY FURTHER COMMENTS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN THE UH YEAH 
YEAH 
I MEAN WITH THE WITH THE RUBBER DESIGN IT COULD I YOU KNOW IT COULD PRETTY MUCH MOULD VERY MUCH TO THE AT THE USER'S HAND 
NO NICE WEE FEATURE IF WE COULD IF WE COULD STILL DO THE RUBBER 
I THOUGH OF WAS TO HAVE THE UH RUBBER EXTEND BEYOND THE END OF THE UH OF THE RIGID SUBSTRUCTURE 
SO IT HAS A WEE SORT OF TAIL THAT YOU JUST DRAPE OVER YOUR WRIST SO IT STAYS IN POSITION NICELY 
MM 
LOVELY 
UM 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S STILL PART OF THE DESIGN 
MM 
MM 
AND MAKING IT A BRIGHT COLOUR HELPS WITH THE PERSONALLY I WOULD HAVE GONE FOR PURPLE 
MM-HMM 
I'D SAY NUMBER ONE 
I THINK WE IF IT WAS JUST THE SOUNDER THEN THE I MEAN SOMETHING I'VE FOUND WITH UH W W WITH SAY TR TRYING TO FIND UH A CORDLESS PHONE OR A M MOBILE 
YOU CAN HEAR IT BUT YOU CAN'T QUITE OPEN IT DOW PIN DOWN WHERE IT IS 
BU 
YEAH 
MM-HMM I SUPPOSE O ONE THING THAT COULD BE DONE IS UH S HAVE TO UM CIRCULAR AND HAVE TO USE IS THAT THE UH THE PINK ACTUALLY GOES A BIT OVER THE PINKIE FINGER 
MM 
SO THAT UH THE 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
I THINK IF WE REMOVE THE THE L. C. DISPLAY THEN THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY ONE POINT AT ANY OF THESE MEETINGS AND WE JUST WE COULD JUST PUT OUR BRANDING ON ANY OTHER REMOTE CONTROL 
MM-HMM 
UM YEAH I MEAN ONE THING I MEAN HO HO HOW MUCH EXTRA WOULD TO BE TO TO KEEP I MEAN KEEP THE UM THE ARTICULATION 
THIS IS WHAT I'M WONDERING 
OH NO I THINK I I TO DO THAT IT NEEDN'T REQUIRE IT TO BE DOUBLE CURVED 
IT'S UH IT'S JUST IT'S JUST IT'S JUST THAT THE CASE WOULD COME ON IT WOULD BE MADE IN TWO PARTS AND THEN JOINED TOGETHER WITH AN ARTICULATION 
MM 
YEAH I MEAN AND I MEAN THE UH I MEAN IF YOU LIKE UH IF YOU LOOK CLOSER TO THE UH AT THE PROTOTYPE HERE 
THE LINES HERE ALONG THE GROUP 
ARE ACTUALLY QUITE STRAIGHT 
UM I MEAN YEAH IN THE ON THE L. C. D. I MEAN ALTHOUGH WE'VE DONE IT WITH A CURVE IT COULD JUST AS EASILY BE DONE UM WITHOUT CURVES 
THE CURVE THAT'S REALLY NEEDED IS UP HERE 
TO PUT UH TO KEEP THE JOYSTICK IN A GOOD ERGONOMIC POSITION FOR IT TO HAVE TO REST ON THE TOP OF THE HAND 
MM 
MM NO THAT'S THAT VOICE RESPONSE THING THAT WE GET THE EMAIL ABOUT 
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST COMPLETELY POINTLESS 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
B I BASICALLY IT WAS SAYING THAT OUR LABS HAD COME UP WITH A CHIP THAT YOU COULD 
YOU KNOW SAY HELLO IT AND IT WOULD SAY HELLO BACK IN A FRIENDLY FEMALE VOICE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY WELL LE LET'S SAY THAT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE OUR SPECIAL COLOURED CASE AND THEN WE AT LEAST HAVE MAKE IT A LITTLE HARDER TO LOSE 
BECAUSE MOST M MOST REMOTES ARE A FAIRLY DINGY COLOUR THAT GETS CAMOUFLAGED UNDER ANY PILE OF CRAP IN A LIVING ROOM 
OR GREY 
YELLOW 
OKAY 
THERE 
I THINK WE CAN DO OTHER 
THE THE SPECIAL COLOUR DOESN'T WOULD I THINK MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
IT MAKES IT STAND OUT FROM YOU KNOW IT'S LOST IN A BIG PILE OF CRAP IT STANDS OUT FROM THE REST OF THE CRAP 
TWO BUTTONS AND A JOYSTICK 
TOTALLY 
IT DOESN'T GET MUCH FANCIER 
MM 
MM 
I'D GIVE IT A THREE FOR THIS FOR THAT 
YEAH 
I MEAN THE MENUS THING IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T NORMALLY AS IN UM IN A REMOTE BUT YOU USE IT IN A LOT OF OTHER PLACES 
MM-HMM 
I'D GIVE IT A THREE 
MM-HMM 
I'D SO I I'D GIVE IT A SIX TO BE HONEST 
WELL I I I WOULD SO I WOULD SAY GIVE A S GIVE A SELECTION OF COLOURS 
UM WE WENT WITH YELLOW WE WENT WITH YELLOW FOR THE PROTOTYPE 'CAUSE WE HAD YELLOW 
IF I WERE BUYING ONE I'D GO FOR PURPLE 
LEOPARD PRINT WOULD BE COOL 
THAT'S KINDA 
I IT WON'T BE WHEN IT'S BEEN 
BUDGETED 
I I THINK SO I I THINK THIS ISN'T NOT PARTICULARLY FRUIT AND VEGGIE 
UM 
MM 
I'D I'D I DON'T THINK FRUIT AND VEG IS THE SOLE CRITERION 
SO THE SOLE CRITERION FOR BEING UM FASHION FASHIONABLE OR INSPIRED BY CURRENT FASHIONS 
UM I'D G I'D RATE I'D RATE THIS FAIRLY HIGHLY FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW ACTUALLY 
MM 
MM 
PERSONALLY 
I THINK GIVEN THAT 
THE PRODUCT UM 
ONLY REPLACES A SINGLE REMOTE CONTROL THAT YOU'VE ALREADY GOT 
ARE PEOPLE REALLY GONNA SHELL TO TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR SOMETHING THAT'S ONLY MARGINALLY GOOD 
MM-HMM 
I SEE I SUPPOSE ONE THING IS THAT BE BECAUSE IT'S TECHNICALLY INNOVATIVE 
UM FOR SOMEONE WHO'S SORT OF TECHNOPHOBIC THE FACT THAT IT SIMPLY LOOKS UNFAMILIAR WOULD BE DAUNTING 
UM 
YEAH GOT NOTES AND DOODLES 
WELL I THINK THIS IS A I THINK THE DIGITAL PEN'S MOSTLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE UH 
OF THE RESEARCHERS STUDYING THIS 
IT'S ALL P GOES INTO THEIR CORPUS 
THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFER THE UM 
TRANSFER OUR IN OUR PAPER NOTES ONTO THE UH 
COMPUTER OURSELVES 
NOT UH UH UNTIL UH UNTIL ACCOUNTS CAME ALONG SQUISH 
YEAH 
MM 
I MEAN I TH I MEAN I THINK IT R RETAINING THE USE THE MORE SORT OF BIO MORPHIC FORM ON THE ARTICULATION WOULD GAIN MORE ONE IS UH WOULD GAIN MORE PROFIT IN SALES THAN IT WOULD ALSO IN UH 
NO ADDED EXPENSE 
SUCH AS IT IS 
ACTUALLY I WANT THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY I MEAN SOMETHING THAT COULD PERHAPS BE PART OF THE PRODUCT MM THE M M PRODUCT TESTING MARKET RESEARCH PROCESS WOULD BE TO UH PRODUCE MOCK UPS OF BOTH VERSIONS AND SO JUST HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE THE OVER GOING OVER BUDGET 
UM UM WOULD MAKE IT SALES 
AND WE COULD EVEN YOU KNOW MARKET TWO VERSIONS 
WEE CHEAPIE VERSION WITH THE NICE BIO MORPHIC RUBBER 
YES 
MM 
AND I CAN GET MY BUS 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
RIGHT 
YEAH I'VE GOT A IF YOU LOAD UP MY EVALUATION DOCUMENT 
MM 
UH EVALUATION 
BASIC POINT UH HAVE A LIST OF CRITERIA THAT WE NEED TO RATE THE PROTOTYPE BY 
UM THEN WE WELL IT'S A SEVEN IS UM SEVEN 
SEVEN STEP KINDA EVALUATION PROCESS 
SO UM NOT SEVEN STEPS SEVEN SCALE 
SO AFTER WE'VE FINISHED DOING ALL THE RATINGS FOR EACH CRITERIA WE AVERAGE THAT AND THAT WILL GIVE US SOME TYPE OF UH CONFIDENCE IN OUR PROTOTYPE 
AND UH THE CRITERIA BASED ON REAL REACTIONS' KINDA GOALS AND POLICIES MARKETING STRATEGIES AND ALSO THIS I PUT TOGETHER FROM THE USER REQUIREMENTS PHASE 
'KAY 
UM IF YOU FLIP THE 
SO THESE ARE THE CRITERIA 
AND UH PERHAPS I COULD HAVE PUT 'EM A BIT BETTER BUT YOU NOTICE A FEW THINGS THAT WE'VE TOTALLY ABANDONED 
WHICH MEANS THAT UH THE PRODUCT WILL SCORE VERY BADLY ON SOME OF THESE POINTS 
PUT IT MILDLY 
SO WE HAVE UM TRUE 
NO IT 
SEVEN EIGHT UH 
FOURTH 
OKAY SO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH EACH POINT 
IF WE IMAGINE IT'S ACTUALLY STRAIGHT AND JUST GIVE IT A A SCORE 
SO UM HOW WELL WOULD YOU SAY THE PROTOTYPE IS UH HOW WILL HAVE WE REALISED THE DREAM OF BEING ABLE TO STOP REMOTES FROM FROM BEING LOST 
OR TO BE ABLE TO FIND THEM ONCE THEY ARE LOST 
I MEAN UH IS THE HOMING THING STILL THE LOCATOR IS THAT STILL 
SURE 
AND ADAM WE CAN KEEP THAT ONE 
OKAY 
SURE 
IT 
SURE 
MM 
BRIGHT COLOUR 
SO WE STILL HAVE THAT NOISE THING YEAH 
SO IN A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN HOW WOULD YOU GUYS RATE IT FOR FINDING FINDING IT ONCE IT'S LOST 
NUMBER ONE 
OKAY 
NUMBER NUMBER ONE FOR THE FIRST CRITERIA 
YEAH YOU CAN TELL WHAT ROOM THE MOBILE IS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YOU WANNA SAY SOMETHING 
THAT'S FINE 
OH THAT'S THAT'S FINE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CR IS THERE ANYTHING I WANNA 
UM A FEW 
SOMETHING I NEGLECTED FROM MY INITIAL RESEARCH IS THAT REAL REACTIONS HAS A A GOAL STRATEGY THAT ALL OF THE PRODUCTS BE INSPIRED BY MATERIAL FASHION AND CLOTHING FASHION 
THAT IS WHY FRUIT AND VEG BEING POPULAR IN THE HOME AND IN CLOTHING WAS IMPORTANT AND THEY WANT ALL THEIR PRODUCTS TO BE SOMEHOW INSPIRED BY CURRENT TRENDS IN FASHION 
SO THEY SAY WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS WELL THEY REALLY MEAN IT THEY THEY'RE VERY BIG IN FASHION SO 
THAT'S THIS BUT RIGHT HERE 
AND UH THIS BUT IS THIS AN EASY TO USE FOR VISITORS OR FOR ANYBODY 
I GUESS IT'S JUST THE SAME AS SAYING EASY TO USE INTERFACE SO IT'S KINDA CONDENSED INTO ONE 
AND WE CAN COME BACK TO TO YOU SAID 
SO 
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES 
YEAH 
MM 
DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON HOW MUCH UM DIFFERENT PRINTS COST 
I MEAN CAN YOU GET THE ENTIRE THING PRINTED WITH A DESIGN UM 
YEAH YEAH 
WHY WOULD WHY WOULD THAT BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN AN INDIVIDUAL PUSH BUTTON AND SCROLL WHEEL TOGETHER 
THAT'S QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPENSIVE 
YEAH 
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE UH SPEAKERS HERE 
THE LIKE UH WE UH WHAT ABOUT SPEAKERS AND TRANSMITTERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
HAVE WE FACTORED THAT ONE 
TRANSMITTER RECEIVER SPEAKERS 
PLUS THE EXTRA DEVICE ITSELF THAT'S GONNA BE IN A T. V. 
SO THAT GONNA BE A BUTTON OR 
YEAH 
I I MEAN IT'S NOT IN HERE BUT UM 
DID THEY SO DO WE HAVE TO USE AN ADVANCED CHIP FOR THE L. C. D. 
OKAY 
WELL THAT'S YEAH 
WHAT'S A HAND DYNA DYNAMO 
YOU HAVE TO WIND IT UP 
TECHNOLOGY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND WE COULDN'T REPLACE THE JOYSTICK RIGHT 
BECAUSE WE WOULD NEED FOR EXTRA BUTTONS TO REPLACE IT UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT 
AND THAT WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A BIT AS A SCROLL WHEEL NOT JUST BACK AND FORWARD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
AH OK 
DOES THIS DOES THIS BEAR IN MIND THAT I MEAN IT'S A BIT RIDICULOUS THAT THEY'RE GONNA CHARGE US 
WHAT IS IT LIKE THIS MUCH MONEY FOR THREE MILLION IF WE'RE GONNA BUY THREE MILLION COMPONENTS YOU KNOW 
MM 
'KAY 
I THINK SO 
YEAH 
COULD WE COULD WE NOT GET RID OF THE CURVY THE CURVES THE CURVACEOUSNESS AND FOCUS ON THE MENU BEING THE BEST INTERFACE 
'CAUSE LIKE WE DO WE HAVE RE RESTRICTIONS ON SOFTWARE 
UH BUT THERE HAS TO BE 
JOYSTICK 
OKAY 
SURE 
OKAY MY BAD 
SO I THINK THE PRODUCT IS NOT GONNA PERFORM AS WELL FOR MY CRITERIA 
OH WAIT A MINUTE 
SAMPLE SPEAKER 
WHAT IS A SAMPLE SPEAKER 
SO THAT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO WHAT WE WANT 
YEAH 
YOU GOT A EMAIL ABOUT VOICE RESPONSE 
I DID NOT SO 
WE WON'T GO WITH THAT ONE DID YOU SAY 
I MEAN I W 
OKAY OKAY 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA GET RID OF THE WHOLE LOCA LOCATOR THING 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UH SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE CASE 
MM-HMM 
W WHAT'S THE DEFAULT COLOUR 
WHAT ARE BLACK 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SURE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO UH 
RIGHT OKAY 
OKAY 
'KAY 
ABILITY TO STOP REMOTES FROM BEING LOST OR TO FIND THEM ONCE THEY ARE LOST 
UM 
OKAY 
SPECIAL COLOUR 
UH UH FOUR 
THERE IF WE'RE BEING GENEROUS I FEEL 
THINK WE'RE BEING GENEROUS HERE WITH THREE 
MM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNUSED BUTTONS 
WE'RE DOWN TO TO TWO BUTTONS SO IT 
OKAY SO THAT'S A ONE 
YOU KNOW WHERE THAT'S 
OKAY THAT WAS GOOD 
EASY TO USE INTERFACE BUTTONS MEN MENUS THAT'S YEAH THAT'S GOOD 
'KAY THAT'S WE'RE NOT DOING SO BADLY 
UM EASY TO USE UH OKAY LET'S FORGET THAT ONE 
FANCY LOOKING 
SURE 
AND WE COULD DO WHATEVER WE LIKE WITH THE L. L. C. D. 
YEAH LET'S JUST ASSUME IT'S A GOOD L. C. D. DISPLAY 
MAYBE I WAS PANICKING FOR NO REASON 
YEAH WE MAYBE YOU'D BE A BIT TOO YEAH 
THERE WE GO 
YEAH THAT'S ME 
THAT'S THAT'S BETTER TO 
MORE ACCURATE NUMBERS 
TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
WELL WE'RE GETTING RID OF THE LOCATOR THING WHICH WHICH YEAH 
'KAY 
YEAH MOBILE PHONES 
AND YOU WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS MOVING THE MENU FROM THE TELEVISION TO THE REMOTE CONTROL SO IT'S 
YOU SAY THREE 
I MIGHT GO AS FAR AS TWO ON THAT 
THERE 
THERE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MATERIALS THAT PEOPLE FIND PLEASING 
SPONGINESS IS WHAT THEY REALLY WOULD HAVE WANTED APPARENTLY 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
IT'S NOT A STEP BACKWARDS 
YEAH OKAY LET'S GIVE IT A SIX 
OKAY THAT'S TOTALLY THROWN EVERYTHING OFF BALANCE 
INSPIRED BY THE LATEST INTERIOR AND CLOTHING FASHION 
WE WE COULD 
WHAT COLOUR WERE WE GONNA MAKE IT 
I KNOW BUT 
BUT UM BY THIS I THINK IT'S MORE A CASE OF FRUIT AND VEG 
YEAH 
MM 
BUT 
TH TH THEY'RE REFERRING TO THE FRUIT AND VEG THING 
SO THIS LIKE A BANANA TYPE COLOUR 
COULD WE STRETCH NO STILL IT'S NOT SHAPED LIKE A BANANA IS 
UH SO THAT 'CAUSE IT'S FLAT 
WHAT IS WHAT FRUIT OR VEG IS FLAT 
YEAH 
ARE WE MIGHT HAVE TO SUFFER BADLY FOR THIS ONE AS WELL 
FOUR 
OH THAT'S IT'S VERY AMBITIOUS YEAH UM 
SURE 
INSPIRED BY 
YEAH 
THIS IS THEIR STRATEGY 
I M IMAGINE WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME MONEY INVESTED IN THIS AND THE AMOUNT THAT WE INVEST IS GONNA BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE MARKS 
MIGHT WE MIGHT WANNA BE A BIT MORE SKEPIBLE SCEPTICAL ABOUT 
THIS ONE 
I WOULD SAY I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT AT ALL RIGHT 
IN ANY WAY OR SHAPE OR FORM 
WE DIDN'T UM 
OKAY THE THE YELLOW BANANA LIKE THING SO I THINK SO OKAY 
RIGHT FIVE 
SO THAT SOUND REASONABLE 
FIVE 
YEAH 
'KAY SO WE HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN 
SO FIVE SEVEN TEN SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE 
WHICH GIVES US AN AVERAGE OF THREE 
IT'S WELL THIS WOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE 
SO W IT'S IT'S NOT BAD 
IT'S IN THE GOOD SECTION 
OOPS 
SORRY 
I'M I'M SORRY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
EVEN IF WE WERE TO INCREASE THIS ENTIRE THING BY BY SEVEN WE WERE TO GO DOWN A GRADE TO IT FOR 
WE WOULD HAVE TO DO I MEAN WE DIDN'T WE WEREN'T THAT KINDA OPTIMISTIC TOO OPTIM OVERLY OPTIMISTIC 
YOU KNOW LIKE WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T DID WE DIDN'T SUBTRACT A WHOLE SEVEN POINTS FROM THESE THINGS SO I THINK WE'RE DEFINITELY IN THE GOOD BUT 
EVEN IF WE GAVE THIS ONE SEVEN AND THIS ONE SEVEN THAT'S STILL ONLY THREE EXTRA POINTS OVER SEVEN 
YOU KNOW IT'S YEAH WE DID IT W IT WAS OKAY 
IT WAS GOOD 
MM-HMM 
I THINK SO 
I MEAN MY MUM STILL HAS NOT LEARNT HOW TO USE TEXT MESSAGING ON HER PHONE AND SHE'S HAD IT FOR A LONG TIME YOU KNOW 
SHE USES TO TO MAKE PHONE CALLS AND THAT'S IT 
YEAH 
SO I THINK IF SHE OF MY MUM SAW A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE THIS WITH ONLY TWO BUTTONS AND A JOYSTICK 
I MEAN THAT'LL PROBABLY BE THE FIRST ONE SHE DECIDES NOT TO BUY YOU KNOW 
SHE'D BE LIKE SO THIS A REMOTE CONTROL I DON'T HOW DO YOU USE IT AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
SO EVEN IF IT IS REALLY USER FRIENDLY TO USE BUT WE'RE USED TO USING MENUS ALL THE TIME 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S TOTALLY UH RADICAL TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH NO NO NUMBERED BUTTONS YEAH 
BUT LIKE RADICAL GOOD MAYBE 
WROTE NEARLY A PAGE BUT NOT 
I THINK TRACKING 
YEAH THAT WOULDA BEEN PRETTY GOOD 
I'D YEAH I LOOKED AT YEAH 
I L YEAH TOP MARKS 
WELL YEAH 
WE WE'RE NOT LACKING IN DOES YOU KNOW IT'S THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MAYBE THE COUNTS WOU WOULDA BEEN BETTER IF WE HAD A LIST OR MORE 
YEAH TO BEGIN WITH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
AND LIKE RESPONSE FROM CONSUMERS 
SURE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY LET'S 
THANK YOU 
I WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF UPSET YOU KNOW AT THE BUDGET AND THAT WE HAD TO CUT A LOT OF STUFF 
IT'S LIKE MEAN WE WE CAN'T HAVE THE LOCATOR THING 
AND SO YEAH THAT'S JUST BAD 
DO YOU THINK MAYBE THE PRICES WERE WERE MADE 
MM 'KAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THE UNIVERSAL ONES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM IT'S ABOUT THAT 
MM 
UM WELL MY FIRST THOUGHTS WOULD BE MOST REMOTE CONTROLS ARE GREY OR BLACK 
SO YOU SAID THEY COME WITH THE T. V. SO IT'S NORMALLY JUST YOUR BASIC GREY BLACK REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS SO MAYBE WE COULD THINK ABOUT COLOUR 
MAKE THAT MIGHT MAKE IT A BIT DIFFERENT FROM THE REST AT LEAST 
UM AND SO YOU SAY WE NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF GIMMICK 
SO UM I THOUGHT MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE IF YOU LOSE IT AND YOU CAN WHISTLE YOU KNOW THESE THINGS 
BECAUSE WE ALWAYS LOSE OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THEN YOU LOSE IT YEAH 
KIND OF UM MAYBE MORE LIKE A P. D. A. KIND OF JUST HAND HELD LIKE 'CAUSE 
YEAH 
NO I WASN'T NO SORRY I WASN'T THINKING OF THE SCREEN OF LIKE A P. D. A. BUT 
OKAY 
SO YOU WANT ME TO LOOK AT SHAPES AND EVERYTHING YOU SAID 
YEP 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OH NO 
SORRY IT'S OKAY 
OKAY COOL 
UH MAKING A PROFIT OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS 
SO IT'S G GONNA HAVE TO BE BE PRETTY DAMN TRENDY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I WAS THINKING THAT AS WELL 
I THINK THE THE ONLY ONES THAT I'VE SEEN THAT YOU BUY OR THE SORT OF ONE FOR ALL TYPE THINGS WHERE THEY'RE YEAH 
SO PRESUMABLY THAT MIGHT BE AN IDEA TO 
PUT INTO 
YEAH YEAH 
UH 'CAUSE I MEAN WHAT UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS THAT'S ABOUT 
I DUNNO FIFTEEN POUNDS OR SO 
AND THAT'S QUITE A LOT FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
THE THE KEYRINGS YEAH YEAH 
OKAY THAT'S COOL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
'KAY 
WE'RE 
SORRY CARRY ON 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
FOR FOR UH REMEMBER WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT FOR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY 
OKAY WELL RIGHT WE'LL HAVE TO UM I'LL WE'RE K HAVING ANOTHER MEETING IN HALF AN HOUR SO UM WE SHOULD ALL LOOK INTO A BIT 
UH UH ACTUALLY NO WE'LL ALLOCATE 
SO YOU DO THE LOOKING AROUND AT THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM IF YOU COULD MAYBE COME UP WITH SORT OF SHAPES AND SUGGESTED SHADES OR WHATEVER AND YOU COULD LOOK INTO UM 
BASICALLY HOW HOW IT'S MADE I. E. LIKE HOW YOU MAKE IT ALL IN IN HOW WHAT SORT OF MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU WHATEVER 
AND OBVIOUSLY OTHER INSTRUCTIONS WILL COME FROM THE PERSONAL COACH 
WHICH WILL PROBABLY JUST USURP WHAT I SAID SO 
SHAPES AND COLOURS AND UM BASICALLY HOW TO MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE 
OH 
AND YOU LOOK AT COMPETITION AND DESIGN 
COOL 
SO WE HAVE UH 
UM 
OKAY GROOVY 
AND NO DOUBT WE'LL GET UM 
SORRY 
WE'LL GET UM WARNINGS FOR NEXT MEETINGS AS WELL 
OKAY 
I SHALL I CAN'T IMAGINE THOSE ARE WORTH MUCH 
OKAY 
FASHION INTO ELECTRONIC 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT SO TWENTY FIVE 
SO YEAH I'VE 
THE ONLY THE ONLY REMOTE CONTROLS I'VE USED USUALLY COME WITH THE TELEVISION AND THEY'RE FAIRLY BASIC 
SO UH 
MM 
BUT BUT TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE YOU NEED A LOT OF NEAT FEATURES 
FOR SURE 
YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT 
UH WHAT DO WE THINK A 
WHAT DO WE THINK A GOOD SIZE WOULD BE FOR THIS 
'CAUSE I I KNOW SO YOU ADD MORE BUTTONS AT THE REMOTE TO SOMETIMES GETS SO BIG AND CLUNKY AND THERE'S JUST LIKE A HUNDRED BUTTONS ON IT 
OR YOU COULD HAVE A REALLY SMALL SLIM ONE BUT THEN YOU COULD LOSE IT EASILY 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
WAIT FOR EMAILS 
HMM 
SLIM 
OH YEAH UH 
BEING AS A MARKETING EXPER EXPERT I WILL LIKE TO SAY LIKE BEFORE DECIDING THE COST OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL OR ANY OTHER THINGS WE MUST USE THE MARKET POTENTIAL FOR THIS PRODUCT LIKE WHAT IS THE COMPETITION ON THE MARKET 
WHAT ARE THE AVAILABLE PRICES OF THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE PRICES 
WHAT SPECIALITY OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS ARE HAVING AND HOW COMPLICATED TO USE IT IS THIS REMOTE CONTROLS AS COMPARED TO THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET 
SO BEFORE DECIDING OR BEFORE FINALISING THIS PROJECT WE MUST DISCUSS ALL THESE THINGS LIKE AND APART FROM THIS IT SHOULD BE HAVING A GOOD LIKE ALSO 
BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY LI UH LIKE TO PLAY WITH IT WHEN THEY ARE WATCHING MOVIES OR PLAYING WITH OUR PLAYING WITH THREE C. D. PLAYER 
M. P. THREE PLAYER LIKE ANY ELECTRONIC DEVICES 
THEY REALLY WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING GOOD HAVING A GOOD DESIGN IN THEIR HANDS SO YES ALL THIS 
YEAH 
YEP 
OH 
HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
WOW 
SO SORRY I WAS JUST GONNA SAY WHAT WAS THE QUESTION FOR THIS 
OR S OR YOU COMING IN IT THAT 
OKAY 
SO THESE PERCENTAGES ARE ARE WHAT 
HMM 
MM MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEP SURE THAT'S COOL UM 
YEAH 
I CAN TURN MY COMPUTER QUICKLY IF THAT'S OKAY 
UM YEP 
OKAY AND THEN WHAT DO I PRESS F. EIGHT 
OH RIGHT 
OKAY COOL 
OH 
YEAH 
NO SIGNAL 
OKAY 
COOL 
OKAY AND THEN HOW DO I PRESS THE THE BIG ONE TO GET IT IN AT THE BIG 
F. FIVE AND I PRESS THAT AGAIN TO GET IT OFF AS WELL D I 
OKAY SO UM I'M THE INTERFACE DESIGN DESIGNER USER INTERFACE DESIGNER SORRY 
UH I'M CONCERNED WITH UM W WHAT EFFECT THE APPARATUS SHOULD HAVE ON THE USER AND UM I'M I'M ALSO I WANT TO POINT TO THAT OUR MOTTO 
PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS SO OBVIOUSLY WE USE A COMPANY WE WANT TO MAKE OUR PRODUCTS TRENDY AND FASHIONABLE IT'S A BIG CONCERN OF AREAS 
OKAY AND HOW DO I PRESS ON JUST THE NEXT BUTTON 
THE ARROW 
OKAY 
SO UM I LOOKED AT EXISTING DESIGNS AND ALSO UM THE INFORMATION THAT RAJ GAVE US WAS VERY USEFUL BUT WHAT PEOPLE LIKE WHAT PEOPLE DISLIKE 
UM AND WHAT PEOPLE FASHIONABLE BECAUSE WE SAID PEOPLE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FIVE WERE THE MAIN UM BUYERS OF OF OUR T. V. I THINK 
SO UM WHAT THEY LOOK AND WHAT THEY FIND FASHIONABLE 
AND ERGONOMICS WE SAID UM I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO DO ANY OF THIS MYSELF 
BUT UM MAYBE THAT COMES UP I DON'T KNOW 
AND THE FINDINGS WELL 
THE BASIC THAT WAS THE BASIC FUNCTION TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET 
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO 
UM SO THEY NEED TO BE INCLUDED UM BUT I'VE GOT SOME PICTURES HERE OF SOME LEADING ONES 
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET TO THEM DO I PRESS F. FIVE IS IT 
ESCAPE 
OH OKAY COOL 
I HAVEN'T GOT MY GLASSES ON SO I HOPE IT'S THIS ONE 
THESE ARE TWO LEADING UM REMOTE CONTROLS TO THE MOMENT 
YOU KNOW THEY'RE GREY THEY'VE I MEAN THIS ONE'S GOT LOADS OF BUTTONS 
IT'S HARD TO TELL FROM HERE WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO AND THEY DON'T LOOK VERY EXCITING AT ALL 
UM PERSONALLY I PREFER THIS ONE JUST BECAUSE IT'S LOOKS EASIER SO IT'S A BIT MORE SLEEK WITH MORE OF THIS SILVER STUFF 
UM BUT THERE YOU GO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST AND I THINK WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT 
UM 
HANG ON 
F. FIVE OKAY SORRY 
PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
UM WELL I THINK WE NEED TO L I THINK THE ERGONOMICS IS QUITE UM IMPORTANT UM 
UH-HUH 
AND UM I THOUGHT NOT TOO EDGY AND LIKE A BOX 
MORE KIND OF HAND HELD MORE UM NOT SO UH COMPUTERY AND OR ORGANIC YEAH MORE ORGANIC SHAPE I THINK 
UM SIMPLE DESIGNS LIKE THE LAST ONE WE JUST SAW NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS AND SO RAJ POINTED OUT 
ONLY TEN PERCENT FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS 
SO I THINK WHAT WE CAN MISS IT IN THE BUTTONS WE CAN MAKE UP FOR ONE DESIGN AND AND HOW NICE IT LOOKS 
UM 
HAND HELD AND PORTABLE I THINK IS PORTAMINT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE T. F. T. HAVE JUST UM RELEASED UM I THINK SO IT A A REMOTE CONTROL FOR PRESENTATIONS OR UH AND A BIG SEVEN INCH BIG SCREEN 
ANYWAY SO UM 
YEAH 
NO SEVEN INCHES ISN'T THAT BIG BUT UM ANYWAY UM SO HAND HELD AND PORTABLE AND UH UM I THOUGHT ABOUT OTHER FUNCTIONS FOR T. V. BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY WANT THAT 
SO MAYBE WE FORGET ABOUT THAT 
IT'S FOR ONE T. V. UH RIGHT OKAY SURE 
AND SO THE LAST THING I THOUGHT WE WHICH I QUICKLY MENTIONED IN THE OTHER ONE WAS MAYBE A BIT OF A GIMMICK TO SET US APART FROM OTHER PEOPLE 
LIKE GLOW IN THE DARK UM WHICH DOES ALREADY E EXIST BUT IT'S NOT VERY WIDELY USED I DON'T THINK 
EASY FINDER WITH THE A WHISTLE FUNCTION OR SOMETHING OR RECHARGEABLE STATION BECAUSE IT'S A PAIN WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF BATTERIES 
AND I THINK THAT YEP THAT'S IT 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
UM I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO 
MM-HMM YEAH OR SOME SORT OF VOICE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SOMETHING 
UH YOU NEED TO TWIDDLE THE THINGAMIBOBSY THING 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SURE 
WELL I LIKE THAT DESIGN 
YEAH NOT A PROBLEM 
MM-HMM 
OR A LITTLE BASE STATION OR SOMETHING 
THAT MIGHT COST MORE THOUGH 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY WITH BATTERIES WE DON'T NEED TO PROVIDE WELL WE PROVIDE THE FIRST BATTERIES 
BUT IT'S MORE IT'S THAT'S CHEAPER TO JUST PROVIDE BATTERIES 
A BATTERY IN IT KINDA 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM 
MM THAT'S A GOOD IDEA ACTUALLY I LIKE THE PROGRAMMABLE OPTIONS 
MM 'KAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
CORPORATE COLOUR 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
'KAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
ALTHOUGH THE THE DANGER WITH THAT IS IT COULD LIKE A BIT CHEAP 
YEAH 
WELL 
MM 
IN THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS KIND OF FUNCTIONS AND STUFF 
MM-HMM OKAY 
OKAY COOL 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM 
GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL I WAS THINKING 
UM SO I I GUESS THAT WOULD BE CHEAPER THAN A LIGHT I THINK 
OFTEN LOST S WAS THAT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
WELL WHAT ABOUT THIS MIGHT GET A BIT TOO EXPENSIVE ACTUALLY 
BUT WHAT ABOUT UM SOMETHING THAT'S BUILT INTO THE T. V. UM THAT YOU CAN PRESS AND IT'LL SEND IT A LITTLE SIGNAL YOU KNOW LIKE THE ONES THAT WE CAN'T HEAR OR SOMETHING UM THAT THAT WILL ACTIVATE THE REMOTE CONTROL STARTS TO BEEP 
IF YOU FIND IF YOU 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH THAT'S THE ONLY THING YEAH 
THAT COMES WITH OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
THAT COULD ALSO BE BUILT INTO THE T. V. THOUGH WHICH MIGHT MAKE OUR REMOTE CONTROL A BIT OBSOLETE 
YEAH OKAY 
MM 
AND THE EXPENSE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MAYBE NOT EVEN ALL OF IT 'CAUSE WE SAID UM COLOURS AND FASHION WE WERE IMPORTANT IS MAYBE UM JUST LIKE A LITTLE L LINE THAT'S KIND OF AROUND THE OUTSIDE AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE THE REST A DIFFERENT COLOUR 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 'CAUSE WHAT I THOUGHT MAIN 
SLOGAN YEAH 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
'CAUSE YEAH THAT WE MORE THAN FINDING OUT 
THAT WAS MORE LIKE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE WATCHING A FILM IN THE DARK YOU CAN UM STILL USE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT WAS MORE OF A A GIMMICK 
MM 
YEAH UNNECESSARY 
YEAH 
MM 
SO SO THAT ONE OF OUR DEFINITE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY W THAT IT NEEDS A T. F. T. SCREEN 
YEAH YOU THINK SO 
OKAY 
MM-HMM THAT'S COOL 
UM 
IF IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD GIMMICK 
MM-HMM 
AND WHERE IS IT SORRY 
OH 
OKAY COOL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WHAT I THOUGHT AS WELL BUT THE MATERIAL IS M MAYBE NOT THIS KIND OF MATERIAL 
BUT MAYBE MORE LIKE UM THIS KIND OF RUBBERY MATERIAL IT'S A BIT MORE BOUNCY LIKE YOU SAID THEY GET CHUCKED AROUND A LOT 
UM A BIT MORE DURABLE AND THAT CAN ALSO BE ERGONOMIC AND IT KIND OF FEELS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS 
THE RUBBER RATHER THAN 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
UH I THINK W WITH THE MORE ORGANIC SHAPE OF IT IT WON'T BE SO IT WON'T USE HAVE MANY SHARP CORNERS IS THAT 
SO THAT'S SOMETHING GOOD UM 
I DUNNO I MEAN 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
INTERESTING 
YEAH DO WITH THE COLOUR UM DOES IT HAVE TO BE ALL YELLOW DO YOU KNOW 
NO 
YEAH 
HAVING A LITTLE BIT 
OKAY COOL 
MM MM 
MM-HMM OKAY 
COOL 
OH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IN THAT

UM MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING WHICH WERE ESSENTIALLY THAT WE UH HAD DECIDED ON ROLES FOR EACH OF YOU 
HOWEVER UM THERE ARE SOME CHANGES THAT I'VE GOT FROM ONE HIGH THAT UM 
OR A BIT UH WELL W WHAT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY REALISE IT WAS THAT THE UH THIS IS FOR A SPECIFIC TELEVISION 
SO THE ALL IN AN IDEA GOES TO THE WINDOW 
AND THEY REQUIRE THAT THE UH ACTUALLY I'LL GET OUT THAT AT THE END POINT NUMBER FOUR 
UM WE'LL GET WHAT YOU'VE GOT AND THEN WE CAN SEE WHAT WE CAN ADAPT FROM IT 
SO UM PRESENTATIONS WERE YOU ANYBODY GOT RARING TO GO 
RARING TO GO

MM-HMM

THAT'S COOL 
UM DO YOU HAVE TROUBLE WHISTLING 
REALLY 
OH 
YEAH I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE 
WELL I SUPPO UH YOU COULD YOU YOU COULD HAVE THE YOU COULD HAVE THE BASICALLY UM INSTEAD OF A WHISTLE IF IT'S GOT THE VOICE RECOGNITION YOU COULD HAVE TO JUST 
YOU KNOW WHERE ARE YOU 
HMM 
SOUNDS GOOD 
FUNCTION F. EIGHT FOR THE UM THE UH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
LET'S REMEMBER THAT 
MM-HMM 
BUT SURE SURELY THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE UM SORT OF SPECIFIC RATHER THAN ABOVE A THRESHOLD 'CAUSE IF YOU HAD A LOUD MOVIE ON YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET IT BEEPING BACK TO YOU 
SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO DERAIL YOU THREE 
UH SO THAT WHAT THAT IS 
WELL THAT'S COOL 
IF YOU IF YOU CAN BUILD SPACE CRAFT YOU'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH A REMOTE CONTROL YEAH 
RIGHT OKAY 
SO THAT JUST SWITCHES ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND IT'S ENTIRELY SPEECH OPERATED IS IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH NOW IT'S FIF FIFTY MILLION EUROS WE'VE GOTTA UH WE'VE G GOTTA MAKE PROFIT SO WE'RE MAKING THAT AT TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS A TIME 
OKAY 
WOULD TO BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE RECHARGEABLE IDEA 
SO THAT IS THAT GONNA MARK UP A LOT 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
I MEAN IF YOU THINK ABOUT THESE BASE STATIONS NOW IT'S ESSENTIALLY JUST A A LED WITH A SORT OF SELF CONNECTING BRAKE IN IT 
SO I DON'T THINK IT'D UP UP THE PRICE THAT MUCH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
'KAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH UM I'LL TAKE THAT BACK 
RIGHT ALSO SO UM A NOTICE I GOT NOT VERY LONG BEFORE THE MEETING IS DIDN'T MANAGE TO FORWARD IT ON IT YOU 
IT SO LET'S SEE I'LL FIND IT MYSELF UM 
TA NAH 
WE HAD THAT UM TO DIS INCLUDE TELETEXT UM BECAUSE IT'S BECOME OUTDATED AND EVERYBODY USES THE INTERNET ANYWAY 
UM DUNNO WHAT ORACLE WOULD HAVE TO SAY WITH THAT BUT NEVER MIND 
UM IT'S ONLY FOR THE TELEVISION WHICH I'M PRESUMING MEANS IT'S FOR A SPECIFIC TELEVISION 
AND UM INSTEAD OF COLOURS AND SORTA COLOUR OPTIONS THEY WANT CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN SOMEHOW IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEW DESIGN 
YELLOW 
I PRESUME 
UM EVERYTHING ALL THEIR SORT OF UH YOU KNOW THE UH CORPORATE WEBSITE AND EVERYTHING'S YELLOW 
AND THE LOGO UH THE SORT OF SLOGAN WE PUT THE OF FASHION IN ELECTRONICS UH 
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW SORT OF INCORPOR I MEAN 
I GUESS IF YOU'RE GOING FOR A SORT OF GLOBULAR SHAPE YOU COULD KIND OF HAVE TO WORKING ITS WAY AROUND IT OR SOMETHING 
UH WHERE UM I 
OKAY SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WHICH FUNCTIONS WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY HAVE 
UH NOW WE HAD AS LISTED OPTIONS WE HAD 
SPEECH RECOGNITION POTENTIALLY FLAT SCREEN INTERFACE L. C. D. INTERFACE UM 
WE ALSO WANT TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS SO WE'LL PRETTY MUCH TAKE THAT ONE IS RED 
WE'LL SEE THE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS FOR A TELEVISION 
NO TELETEXT 
UM OKAY HOLD ON 
NOT ENOUGH BUTTONS YOU MEAN 
SO SORTA STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN A A FEW AND A R IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE JUST CUTTING ON THE UM 
I DO HOWEVER HAVE THIS FROM OVER MY HEAD THAT THEY DON'T WANT TELETEXT ON IT 
UH MAYBE RAJ YOU COULD FIND OUT WHAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK ABOUT THAT OR MAYBE THEY'LL SEND 
SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THAT BUT UM WHAT PEOPLE WHETHER PEOPLE WOULD REQUIRE UM TELETEXT IN A REMOTE TELETEXT OPTION IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY UM 
SO UH I TAKE TO YOUR POSITION ARLO IS THAT THE BELLS AND WHISTLES WE'VE GOTTA COME UP WITH THE A GIMMICK BUT NOT TOO COMPLICATED A GIMMICK 
UM SO I MEAN A A THE SORT OF INKLING I'M GETTING FROM LITTLE BITS OF UM WEB CHATTER THAT I'M GETTING SENT IS THAT THEY'RE QUITE INTERESTED IN A T. F. T. DISPLAY 
INTERACTIVE DISPLAY 
HOWEVER THAT DOES SOUND A BIT LIKE THE 
MORE COMPLICATED DESIGN THAT RAV UH SORRY RAJ UM 
SAID PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE 
ALTHOUGH I GUESS IF THERE'S A SORT OF IF YOU THINK ABOUT STANDARD INTERFACES THAT PEOPLE USE ALREADY 
SORT OF WINDOWS STYLE DROP DOWN MENUS OR WHATEVER I THINK MAYBE THAT'S A BIT 
GOING A BIT FAR BUT YOU KNOW LIKE IN A BASIC SENSE THAT YOU COULD HAVE YOUR BASIC SELECTION OF BUTTONS 
AND IF YOU HIT A SORT OF MENU AT THE TOP YOU HAVE 
UM IT GOES TO A DIFFERENT SELECTION OF BUTTONS SO IT SORTA KEEPS IT SIMPLE 
UM GLOW IN THE DARK SO THAT SORT OF WITH A LIGHT INSIDE IT OR IS IT SORT OF GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL 
OKAY 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LEAST YEAH 
THAT'S COOL 
THAT'S COOL 
OKAY COOL 
UM 
SPEECH RECOGNITION I TAKE IT 
I DON'T I'VE I KNOW IF IN PRODUCTS UM THAT IS SPEECH RECOGNITION WELL 
REALLY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OR A YEAH AN ADVERT AN ADVERT FOR B. B. C. TWO ON B. B. C. ONE'LL SWITCH THE CHANNEL FOR YOU KINDA THING 
MM 
UH-HUH 
OH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
SO LIKE A KIND OF BACKWARDS REMOTE FROM THE TELLY 
RIGHT 
THAT WE SHOULD JUST STICK ON YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THAT'S A SORT OF BASIC R. F. KIND OF FREQUENCY SO IT'LL BE CHEAP 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
IT MIGHT DO IS OUT OF A JOB 
UM 
OKAY 
I LIKE THE WHOLE SORT OF REMOTE FEEDBACK THING 
UM SO I THINK RATHER THAN AND THAT ALSO KIND OF TAKES AT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IN TERMS OF THE INTERFERENCE OF IT NOT WORKING VERY WELL AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO I TH YEAH AND EXPENSE AND THE TIME 
SO I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO GO WELL I MEAN LIKE THE THING ABOUT THE THERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE T. F. T. OR THE L. C. D. KIND OF THING IS IF YOU'RE ALSO WANTING THE THE KIND OF 
UH ORGANIC GLOBBY SORT OF FEELING TO IT THEN 
YOU MIGHT HAVE TROUBLE INCORPORATING THE SCREEN 
UM BUT I GUESS NOT I THEN WE'LL JUST WE'LL JUST PRETEND THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
UM UH AND HOW ARE YOU ABOUT THE GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL 
SO THAT 
CONTRAST CONTRA WELL 
YEAH OKAY 
SO IF IT'S DOW IT'S D UH YEAH 
OR IF IT'S DOWN UNDER THE COUCH CUSHIONS UM WHICH IS WHERE I USUALLY FIND MINE 
UM 
OKAY WELL WE CAN SEE WE CAN STILL USE THE GLOW IN THE DARK AS A GIMMICK ESSENTIALLY 
UM IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE LOGO ON AS WELL BRIGHT YELLOW LOGO ON OUR OUR UM 
SLOGAN 
UH THEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA BE FAIRLY BRIGHTLY COLOURED ANYWAY 
AND WE CAN HAVE SORT OF A A A TRIMMING AS WELL IF THE GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL JUST AS GIMMICKYNESS 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT SO IN SORT OF IF IF WE'RE GON IF WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THE IDEA OF UM UH OF FEEDBACK 
SORT OF REMOTE FINDER THEN THAT KINDA STUFFS THAT IN IT THEN 
DO YOU THINK 
UH IT MAKES IT FAIRLY UNNECESSARY THEN 
OKAY 
UM OKAY SO SCRATCH THAT 
UH SO WE'VE GOT DO WE WANT TO GO WITH THE T. F. T. IDEA OR THE IS THAT FAR TOO EXPENSIVE 
WELL I MEAN I THINK I THINK THE SORT OF FIND THE FINDER THINGS I MEAN IT'S UH I COULD PROBABLY WRITE THE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM FOR THAT MYSELF 
UM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UM NO I MEAN THAT WAS GOING ON RAVS UH RAJ'S SORT OF UM MARKETING RESEARCH I GUESS 
UM 
OH 
SO WE'LL STICK WITH SORT OF PROGRAMMABILITY UM FOR THE BUTTONS THAT WE DO HAVE 
UM 
SO THAT'S SORT OF 
INCLUDED IN YOUR SUB MODULE KIND OF STUFF UM 
UH YOU WERE FINDING IT BUT TELETEXT 
IF YOU COULD FIND OUT THAT UH 
UM I THINK WE'RE GONNA SCRATCH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS A BIT OF A 
UM EXPENSIVE NO 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
SO IT INTO THE CIRCUITS THAT COST 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
UH WELL THAT KIND OF TAKES BACK THE R. F. THE R. F. REMOTE SORT OF IDEA AS WELL 
UM 
FIVE MINUTES 
OKAY 
DECISIONS 
UH VOTES LET'S VOTE 
WHO WANTS T. F. T. 
NO NO IDEAS 
EXCELLENT SO WE'LL GO WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION YEAH 
UM SPEECH RECOGNITION LIMITED BUTTONS ORGANIC DESIGN 
AND WHAT ELSE WAS I THINKING OF THAT I HAVEN'T WRITTEN DOWN AND THEREFORE FALLEN OUT MY HEAD PROGRAMMABILITY 
OH 
UH O OKAY 
AND ALSO INTEGRATING THE REMEMBER TO INTEGRATE THE LOGO AND THE S SLOGAN 
OKAY SO 
UM CAN YOU PUT ALL THESE REPORTS IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER IF THEY'RE NOT ALREADY IN THERE AS WELL 
SO IT JUST HELPS ME SUMMARIZE THEM 
AND UM I'LL PUT ANY I'M I'M PUTTING ANYTHING I DO IN THERE ANYWAY SO UH 
UH PR UH PROJECT DOCUMENTS 
NO 
I. M. I. SCENARIO CONTROLLER 
WHERE UM I 
PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH IT'S IN YOUR DESKTOP AS WELL 
AND I WILL TR GETTING STRINGS OF UM INFORMATION I'LL TRY AND FORWARD ANY SPECIFIC TO ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR 
AS SOON AS I GET THEM NOW RATHER THAN I WAS ABOUT IT SORT OF TELL YOU ABOUT THE CHANGES BEFORE THE MEETING 
AND THEN THE MEETING TURNED UP SO 
I DID 
SO 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MORE SORT OF UM 
FLESH LIKE THAN PLASTICKY SORT OF 
OH NO ETHICS THAT'S GONNA COST US MONEY 
OKAY SAFETY 
YEAH 
IT SME SMELLS GOOD FOR CHILDREN 
THAT SOUNDS YEAH IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE IT'S GONNA BE HAVE A BIG YELLOW FOAM BALL YEAH SORRY 
PLEASE GOD NO 
UM 
WELL I WOULDN'T TH I MEAN MY REACTION IT IN ALL YELLOW REMOTE CONTROL WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN HORROR SO I THINK JUST HAVING IT 
SURROUNDING THE LOGO 
YEAH 
AND I'LL SEE IF I CAN ARGUE WITH BOSS ABOUT PUTTING THE WHAT WAS IT 
WE PUT WE PUT FASHION INTO 
WHOOPS IT'S NOT WORKING 
CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE FORGOTTEN IT 
WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
I BET THAT'LL CATCH ON WELL 
OKAY ANY LAST 
WORRIES QUERIES 
OKAY 
SO SO I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING 
OKAY THEN LUNCHTIME YAY 
OKAY THAT FELT A BIT MORE LIKE A SOMETHING WITH ORDER AND AND REASON TO IT THEN THE LAST ONE 
THIS IS QUITE FUN ACTUALLY 
I REALLY DON'T 
YEAH YEAH 
WOW YOU'VE YOUR FIRST PAGE 
I WAS JUST WRITING REALLY BIG 
I'VE FINISHED THE MEETING NOW 
OH EVERYBODY NEEDS K QUESTIONNAIRE 
IT'S A INSPIRED DESIGN 
HMM 
OF COURSE 
SO UH I NOTICED YOUR TALK ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION AND WHISTLING 
AND UH I WAS JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW HAVE WE DONE ANY RESEARCH INTO HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN WHISTLE 
UM OR IF IS THAT A FUNCTION WE WANT IN THE REMOTE 
I DON'T BUT I I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DO RIGHT 
YEAH IT JUST I MEAN IT HAS TO BE A CERTAIN KIND OF WHISTLE IT RIGHT 
THAT'S COSTLY THOUGH 
UM A MUCH EASIER THING IS JUST ANY LOUD NOISE LIKE CLAPPING UM SHOUTING YOU KNOW UH AND THEN WHAT WOULD THE RESPONSE BE 
IT BEEPS BACK TO YOU OR SOMETHING 
OKAY 
WELL UH LET ME SET THIS UP 
SO I PLUG IT IN PRESS F. FIVE 
FUNCTION F. FIVE 
OR FUNCTION F. EIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
I THINK IT'S UH JUST TO LOCK IT IN 
IT'S GOT IT 
OKAY 
UM 
SO SO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER MY JOB IS TO TAKE AN INPUT FROM YOU GUYS UM SO IT'S GOOD YOU WANT FIRST 
AND I JOTTED DOWN SOME NOTES AS TO WHAT ARE THE B NEEDS AND UH WHAT KIND OF NOVEL FEATURES WE CAN ADD TO DIFFERENTIATE OUR PRODUCT FROM THE OTHERS 
UM SO RAJ TOLD US THAT UH CONSUMERS ARE WILLING TO SPEND MORE FOR FANCY PRODUCTS 
AND UM UH ALSO MENTIONED THAT UH THE CURRENT PRODUCTS DON'T ALWAYS MATCH USERS' OPERATING BEHAVIOUR 
UM A LOT OF THE BUTTONS AREN'T USED AND UH 
UH MENTIONED THAT THEY'RE NOT FUN TO USE 
AND UH A NOVEL FEATURE WHICH UH WE JUST BROUGHT UP WAS THIS THIS AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION FEATURE OR NOISE DETECTION FEATURE FOR WHEN YOU LOSE THE REMOTE 
THERE COULD BE A LITTLE MICROPHONE ON IT 
AND ANY NOISE OVER A CERTAIN THRESHOLD UM IT'LL PICK UP AS A A DISTRESS SIGNAL UM FROM YOU AND IT'LL BEEP BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW UH HERE I AM OR SOMETHING OF THESE SORT 
OH YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
WELL MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE A 
UM HMM THA THAT WOULD BE A CONSIDERATION TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT YES 
UM 
YEAH WELL TH THAT'S UH FOR LATER DOWN THE RED UM AND THEN USE FOR THE USER INTERFACE IT SHOULD BE TRENDY 
UM AND NOT COMPUTERY RIGHT IS MORE LOW TECH AND NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS 
SO I TAKE THIS ALL INTO CONSIDERATION AND ALSO I HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS FROM THE BOSS 
RIGHT UM AND PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS WHICH I KINDA THREW OUT THE WINDOW 
AND SO I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH AND UNFORTUNATELY ALL I HAD TO WORK ON WAS OUR UH OUR CORPORATE ARCHIVES OF THE GREAT PRODUCTS WE'VE MADE BEFORE 
WHICH INCLUDE YOU KNOW UM SPACE CRAFT COFFEE MAKERS AND BULLET TRAINS 
OR UH OR A HIGH SPEED TRAIN 
RIGHT AND HAVING PERSONALLY WORKED WITH ALL THESE PRODUCTS UH I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE WITH UH WITH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN OF THIS 
RIGHT 
SO 
I FIGURED JUST PUT 'EM ALL TOGETHER 
YOU GOT A A CAFFEINE POWERED SPACE SHUTTLE TRAIN TRANSPORT TO YOUR T. V. AND UM 
SO FOR THE USER INTERFACE PROBLEM YOU KNOW TOO MANY BUTTONS 
GIVE IT ON BUTTON 
AND AND IT'S A YOU KNOW FOR THE THE COWBOY IN ALL OF SO I I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE THE FUNCTION IS THERE BUT 
YEAH IT'S A G I MEAN YOU COULD HAVE A YOU KNOW A 
RIGHT 
SO I THINK I I MISSED THE BUDGET THING IT WAS FIFTY MILLION EUROS 
AND WE GOTTA SELL TWENTY FIVE OF THEM 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
OH OKAY SO I I MIXED THOSE NUMBERS 
OKAY 
WELL I GUESS MORE REALISTICALLY THEN WE NEED A PRODUCT THAT'S GOT SOME KINDA NIFTY OUTER CASING CHEAP PLASTIC UH 
YOU KNOW UM THAT SHOULD BE JUST LIKE UH A TENTH OF THE PRICE MAYBE OR LESS 
AN ENERGY SOURCE WHICH'D PROBABLY JUST BE UH YOUR REGULAR BATTERIES UM WE DON'T WANNA HAVE TO 
OH 
YEAH YEAH WE COULD DO THAT IT 
UM I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT SO SO THE UNIRS THE USER INTERFACE UH THE CANONICAL USER INTERFACE FOR THIS WOULD BE JUST A BUNCH OF BUTTONS 
BUT SINCE WE'RE A CUTTING EDGE COMPANY WE UH OF COURSE WILL HAVE ALTERNATIVES LIKE UH SPEECH RECOGNITION WHISTLING RECOGNITION AND ROCKET POWER 
BEHIND OUR PRODUCT 
UM AND LASTLY THE TRANSMISSION INTERFACE IS UH JUST SOME ENGINEERING THING YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
UM SO HERE'S YOU KNOW A GREAT SCHEMATIC THAT MY UH APPRENTICE DESIGNER GAVE ME 
UM SO YOU CAN USE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL HAVE PARTS AND THESE PARTS LIKE LIKE THAT AND UM YOU KNOW IT'S GOT A LITTLE OPERATING PROCEDURE THAT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND I SUPPOSE YOU ALL KNOW HOW IT WORKS BECAUSE WE'VE ALL USED IT AND WE WOULDN'T BE IN A COMPANY DESIGNING REMOTE CONTROLS IF WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE SO UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
I THINK UH PROGRAMMABLE OPTIONS WHICH UM JUST REQUIRE A SMALL AMOUNT OF MEMORY UH NON VOLATILE MEMORY 
JUST UM SO THE USER CAN PUT IN THEIR FAVOURITE CHANNELS AND MAYBE THEIR PREFERRED VOLUME SETTINGS SO THAT WHEN THEY TURN IT IN IT'S NOT BLASTING 
OH OKAY 
AND THE UH THE BELLS AND WHISTLES THAT WE MENTIONED YOU KNOW THEY TAKE MORE BUDGETING 
UM MORE TECHNICAL UH EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT AND IT'S ALSO MUCH MORE LIKELY TO NOT WORK IF IF WE ADD THESE BELLS AND WHISTLES 
THAT'S ALL I GOT 
OH THAT'S TIGHT 
OKAY I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO SCREW IT IN 
JUST PUSH IT 
YELLOW 
YEAH YEAH 
WELL HMM 
UH IT'S 
THEY'RE ACT THERE THERE WAS A REMOTE CONTROL THAT CAME OUT TWO YEARS AGO THAT HAD A SOME BASIC SPEECH RECOGNITION ON IT 
YOU COULD PROGRAMME IT WITH YOUR CHANNELS AND THEN YOU SAY YOU KNOW LIKE UH B. B. C. ONE AND IT GOES TO THAT CHANNEL 
YEAH IT DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL THOUGH BECAUSE OF THIS NOISE INTERFERENCE PROBLEM 
THEY MENTIONED YOU KNOW IF THE TELEVISION SAYS YOU ARE LISTENING TO B. B. C. ONE 
RIGHT RIGHT AND SO THERE WAS A LOT OF THIS 
YOU'D BE WATCHING THE T. V. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'D IT'D PICK UP A NOISE AND TURN IT OFF OR YOU KNOW OR TURN THE VOLUME OFF OR SOMETHING 
BUT IF YOU CAN WORK AROUND THAT THAT NOISE PROBLEM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT AND THEN IT WOULD DO JUST YOU KNOW UH SUBTRACTIVE KIND OF CANCELLATION OF THE ONES 
WHAT YOU COULD DO THEN WOULD BE YOU HAVE UH A REMOTE CONTROLLED BY THE T. V. SPEAKER 
OR NOT A REMO I'M SORRY A MICROPHONE BY THE T. V. SPEAKER AND A TRANSMITTER THERE THAT SENDS BACK TO YOUR REMOTE 
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T UM EXPECT UH THE THE TELEVISION MANUFACTURERS TO TO PUT THAT FEATURE INTO THEIR T. V. S 
BUT YEAH THEN YOU HAVE LIKE THE LITTLE SE SEPARATE MODULE BY THE T. V. SPEAKER 
WHICH 
RIGHT AND THEN THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD KNOW UM WHAT'S BEING PRODUCED BY THE TELEVISION 
RIGHT RIGHT 
RIGHT RIGHT 
UM 
YEAH THAT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THEN IN ANOTHER THING WAS ABOUT THIS LOSING THE REMOTE AND TRYING TO FIND IT AGAIN 
IF YOU DO HAVE THIS SORTA SPEECH INTERFACE TO TO YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO FIND OUT 
YOU JUST SAY YOU KNOW UM WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOU WANT THE REMOTE FOR 
YOU KNOW TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR AT UH TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF 
YOU JUST SHOUT YOUR COMMAND TO IT AND IT WOULD DO IT FOR YOU IF IT'S WITHIN YOU KNOW WITHIN HEARING RANGE 
AND UH YOU KNOW IT COULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM YOU THAT YOU'VE NO IDEA WHERE IT IS AND IT WOULD STILL DO ITS JOB 
WELL HOPEFULLY WE'RE UH WE'RE AHEAD OF THE CURVE 
HMM 
UM 
MM 
YEAH IN THE THE MATERIAL'S CHEAP BUT IT'S JUST UH THE THE GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO CHARGE IT YOU KNOW 
AND THEN UH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE SITTING ON THE DARK FOR TOO LONG TO UH IT WON'T GLOW ANY MORE 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
UM YEAH WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF FEATURES NOW I I THINK 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK A CONSIDERATION TO USE THAT THIS UH REMOTES GET ABUSED A LOT YOU KNOW THEY GET THROWN AROUND 
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THE THE T. F. T. SCREEN WOULD BREAK OUR UH GET DAMAGED 
THEY'RE PRETTY FRAGILE 
YEAH MM 
OH 
OH NO IT'S IT'S MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE T. F. T. IT'S JUST A MICROPHONE AND SOME SOME INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 
AND IT'D IT'D BE A SMALL VOCABULARY SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM LIKE A 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
SO IT SHOULD BE WHEN YOU SAVE 
IN YOUR DESKTOP SO IT GOES SAVE US ARE 
AND THEN UH HOT THAT LITTLE FOLDER UP THING AGAIN 
AGAIN 
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP YEAH THAT'S UP TO DESKTOP 
RIGHT AND THEN PROJECT DOCUMENTS 
MM 
DID YOU GOT MY EMAIL 
OKAY 
JUST MAKING SURE 
YEAH 
WOW 
WE COULD GO COMP YEAH 
WE COULD GO COMPLETELY OUT OF THE BOX AND MAKE THE THING A BIG RED BALL FOAM BALL 
AND IT'S GOT THE THING IN THE INSIDE 
AND THERE'S NO BUTTONS AT ALL IT'S ALWAYS ON AND JUST YELL AT IT AND IT WORKS 
AND THEN CH CHILDREN WILL LEAVE IT 
UH YELLOW YELLOW BALL 
RIGHT 
TWELVE THIRTY 
MM 
YEP 
YEAH I'VE BEEN USING UP THE PAGES 
ANOTHER QUESTIONNAIRE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
SO HOW 
SO 
SH DO YOU WANT ME TO HOLD IT 
SO AFTER THAT 
F. EIGHT 
IF UH SORRY F. EIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH UM AGAIN RAJAN THE MARKETING EXPERT 
UH SO WE HAVE DECIDED ON THE LAST MEETING THAT I HAVE TO FIND OUT SORRY YEAH SURE 
YEAH YEAH 
OH ACTUALLY SORRY I HAVE TO USE THE OTHER SORRY 
YEAH THANK YOU 
OH YES I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE UH MARKET POTENTIAL FOR THIS PRODUCT UH LIKE CONSUMER LIKINGS AND EVERYTHING 
WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS PRODUCT AND ARE WE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OR A NET PROFIT OUR OUR AIMS OR NOT 
THEN 
SORRY 
OKAY 
YEAH I CAN OKAY 
UH THEN UH THE METHODOLOGY I ADOPTED TO FIND IT ALL THIS WAS MARKET SURVEY 
A A DETAILED MARKET SURVEY ON CONSUMERS WAS DONE TO FIND OUT THEIR LIKINGS AND DISLIKINGS 
WHAT THEY PREFER WHAT THEY NOT PREFER W WHAT PROBLEMS THEY DO ENCOUNTER IN ALL THIS TYPE OF THINGS 
AND WHAT WE GOT WAS WE FOUND THAT IF YOU UH WHAT THEY TH WHAT PROBLEMS THEY ARE HAVING WITH DIFFERENT UH REMOTE CONTROLS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET 
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS THEY DO FIND OUT THAT THE REMOTE CONTROLS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET ARE UGLY 
THEY ARE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING 
SO WE HAVE TO PUT STRESS ON THIS UH WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS FACT ALSO LIKE OUR DESIGN 
UH SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE SHOULD BE GOOD LOOKING FOR THE CONSUMERS 
AND YES THAT'S W UH THIS WILL DEFINITELY THIS CAN DEFINITELY PUT UH UH ENHANCE OUR SALES 
UH AND EVEN UH THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY HIGH UH PAY MORE FOR THIS UH GOOD LOOKING REMOTE CONTROLS ALSO 
SO EVEN IF THE AVAILABLE MARKET GOES FOR THE AVAILABLE UH EVEN IF THE MARKET GOES FOR THE AVAILABLE REMOTE CONTROL IS LESS EVEN THEN WE CAN SELL IT TO TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
WHICH MAYBE WHICH MAY SEEM QUITE HIGH BIT OF OUR LOOKS OR OR OF THE R REMOTE CONTROL WE DESIGN HAVE A GOOD BETTER UH BETTER LIKE UH DESIGNS 
THEN WE CAN HOPE THAT CONSUMERS WILL PREFER THESE G REMOTE CONTROLS 
THEN 
AND THE SECOND THING SOME SOME COMPANIES THEY THINK THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE AND MORE FUNCTIONS OF THE USERS UH ARE IN THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS 
BUT RATHER THAN THIS HAVING MORE FUNCTIONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROLS WE SHOULD EMPHASISE WHAT ACTUALLY CONSUMER WANT WHAT THEY OPERATE RATHER THAN MAKING IT TOO COMPLICATED 
BECAUSE MOSTLY IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE USERS THEY USE ONLY TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS 
SO THERE IS ONE POINT OF HAVING NINETY PERCENT BUTTONS MAKING THE REMOTE CONTROLS TOO BULKY 
TOO COMPLICATED TOO EXPENSIVE A BECAUSE I THINK I BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY IS USEFUL ONLY IF UH THE CONSUMERS THEY WANT TO USE IT 
OTHERWISE THERE IS ONE POINT OF HAVING ALL THIS TYPE OF THINGS 
SO THIS WILL NOT ONLY REDUCE THE COST OF OUR REMOTE CONTROLS BUT IT WILL INCREASE OUR PROFIT ALSO 
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS FACT ALSO 
THEN 
UH IT WAS FUNCTION I WANT TO GO TO 
UH ESCAPE OKAY THANK YOU 
THEN IF WE LOOK AT THIS SLIDE UH THESE ARE IN YOUR SHARED DOCUMENTS YOU CAN SEE LIKE 
OH SORRY 
UH IT LIKE ALL THE MARKET POTENTIAL WHAT UH HOW WE SHOULD DESIGN CONSU OUR REMOTE CONTROLS 
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE THERE IS IS TO EN ENHANCE OUR PROFIT ENHANCE OUR SALES 
YEAH THESE ARE DIFFERENT AGE GROUP PERSONS LIKE UH SORRY I CAN OPEN IT IN ANOTHER WAY 
OH YES 
IF WE LOOK AT THE COSTS WHETHER THE CONSUMERS THEY ARE WILLING TO UH PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL OR NOT 
WE CAN FIND THAT THEY UP TO A THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGE GROUP WE HAVE A VERY GOOD DISLIKING FOR THIS UH THIS UH POINT 
LIKE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO WE CAN EMPHASISE ON THIS POINT ALSO LIKE 
BECAUSE IT WILL DEFINITELY ENHANCE OUR SALES IN THIS GO ON THIS PARTICULAR AGE GROUP FROM UH FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE 
AND I UH AND I THINK THAT MOST OF THE USERS OF THE REM UH T. V. ARE BELONG TO THIS AGE GROUP 
SO WE SHOULD LOOK 
YEAH 
WE CAN LOOK AT THAT THAT FACTOR ALSO SO YES 
YEAH 
SO AND 
AND THEN 
YES 
I THINK SO 
UH IF WE LOOK AT THIS DATA HOW HOW UH UH HOW WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS THE CONSUMERS ARE FACING WITH THE EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE MARKET 
THEY FIND THAT THIRT UH THIRTY FIVE PERCENT UH THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE CONSUMERS THEY FIND TOO DIFFICULT TO OPERATE A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IT SHOULD BE IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO LEARN HOW TO OPERATE THESE REMOTE CONTROLS AND WE SHOULD PROVIDE PL UH SP UH PROPER MANUALS FOR ITS IS ALSO IS IS THAT PEOPLE CONSUMERS COULD EASILY LEARN 
THEY NEED NOT TO HAVE ANY MUCH TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IT IS UH TO KNOW HOW TO OPERATE THESE REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO THIS IS ALSO A VERY G UH MAJOR FACTOR TO L UH TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION TO ENHANCE OUR PROFITS AND SALES 
SO UM THIS IS ALL ABOUT 
UH MARKET POTENTIAL BY UM 
OH YES TH THANK YOU 
YEAH WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT IT 
SORRY 
SORRY 
OH SORRY I HAVE 
BRIAN THIS ONE ALSO I 
YEAH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRIAN 
IF YOU WANT ME TO HELP YEAH 
YEAH 
UH F. EIGHT 
FUNCTION F. EIGHT 
MM SO 
IT'S NOT COMING 
FUNCTION F. EIGHT OKAY 
YEAH 
COMPUTER 
COMPUTER ADJUSTING YEAH 
YEAH 
ESCAPE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
FIFTY MILLION WAS UH PROOF 
IS A PROFIT 
YEAH ME TOO 
YEAH 
BUT COST 
OKAY 
OH 
I 
OH MY I SAY SOMETHING ABOUT 
OH ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY VERY IMPORTANT POINT UH SO IF WE LOOK AT THE MARKET BECAUSE PEOPLE MOR FIFTY PERCENT PEOPLE THEY FIND THAT THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE REMOTE 
IN THE ROOM 
BUT YEAH OUR LAST AND MEANS THEY FORGET WHERE THEY HAVE KEPT THE REMOTE CONTROL LAST TIME 
BUT IF WE ADD SPEECH RECOGNITION AS WELL AS GLOW IN THE DARK THEN BOTH THESE FACTORS WILL HELP THEIR LOCATING THE REMOTE CONTROL 
LIKE IF THEY COME AND SPEAK SOMETHING TO THE REMOTE CONTROL UH REPLIES TO SOMETHING SOMETHING AND IT GLOWS IN THE DARK 
BOTH THESE FACTORS UH BOTH THESE POINTS WILL HELP THEM TO LOCATE THE WHERE THEY HAVE KEPT THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THIS WILL DEFINITELY ENHANCE OUR UH MARKET SALES SO WE SHOULD TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION ALSO 
YEAH 
TOTALLY IT TAKES CHEAP SPEECH RECOGNITION SHE THEY W 
YEAH 
GLOW IN DARK 
HERE 
SURE 
UH IT IS IN SHARED DOCUMENTS 
PROJECT UH PROJECTOR 
HMM 
IT IS NOT GIVING ANYTHING 
SHARED DOCUMENTS 
UM BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE LIKE 
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN ALSO IF THEY MEANS IF CHILDREN CATCH HOLD OF YOUR OR IF THEY CHEW IT IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARMFUL 
SO WHATEVER MATERIAL WE USE IT SHOULD BE YEAH 
SO WE HAVE TO SAFETY POINT OF VIEW ALSO WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE 
YEAH 
SMALL LOGO WITH THE LIKE A SMALL YELLOW STRIP OR Y YELLOW WITH THE LOGO ON IT 
YEAH 
HMM 
THAT'S GOOD 
CHECK HERE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
COOL 
MM UM 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
THE LAST ONE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS IT 
OH SORRY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SORRY 
I WAS JUST READING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 
HARD TO KNOW HOW WE ARE GOING TO INCORPORATE THAT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TH THAT'S VERY GOOD 
GLOW IN THE DARK 
OKAY 
WELL THAT'S GOOD 
THAT'S WHAT WE KIND OF PREDICTED ANYWAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY THE SPONGY NOT REAL SPONGY 
YOU CAN DO YOU THINK LIKE RUBBER WOULD BE GOOD OR DOES IT REALLY WANT TO BE LIKE GEL KIND OF STUFF 
OKAY 
QUITE DISPOSABLE 
OKAY 
OH OKAY 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
COOL 
MM 
A REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
AND WERE THERE ANY FACTORS THAT WEREN'T IMPORTANT IN THE SURVEY THAT THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT 
OR WAS IT JUST OKAY 
COOL 
F. WHAT IS IT 
UM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
NO SIGNAL 
SO THAT 
OKAY AND THEN F. FIVE RIGHT 
OKAY 
UM 
OKAY SO THE INTERFACE CONCEPT UM 
YEAH 
THE INTERFACE SPECIFICATION WHAT PEOPLE UM HOW THEY INTERACT WITH IT BASICALLY I THINK 
UM SO THE METHOD WE LOOKED AT EXISTING DESIGNS WHAT ARE THE WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THEM 
WHAT'S BAD ABOUT THEM UM I LOOKED AT THEIR FLAWS SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THEIR FLAWS EVERYTHING 
UM AND WHAT THE SURVEY TOLD US AND WHAT WE THINK WOULD BE GOOD AS A BIT OF IMAGINATION 
UH THE FINDINGS I'VE GOT SOME PICTURES TO SHOW YOU AS WELL 
YEAH 
OKAY SO MOST REMOTE CONTROLS USE GRAPHICAL INTERFACE 
WHERE YOU M HAVE GOT IS BUTTONS AND YOU POINT TO RATHER THAN HAVING THE OUTPUT AS A A STREAM OF TEXT OR SOMETHING 
UM AND WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE'S INCONSISTENT LAYOUT WHICH MAKES IT CONFUSING 
SO I THINK FOR OUR REMOTE CONTROL THERE IS SOME INCONSISTENCY ALREADY IN EC EXISTING IN BETWEEN REMOTE CONTROLS 
BUT I THINK STANDARD KIND OF UM SHAPE AND UH PLAY AND THIS KIND OF BUT BUTTONS LIKE THE THE TOP RIGHT FOR ONE AND OFF OR SOMETHING 
I THINK PEOPLE FIND THAT THEN IT'S EASY TO USE 
AND WE'VE GOT SOME PICTURES OF SOME UH NEW REMOTE CONTROLS TO SHOW YOU 
DO I PRESS ESCAPE F. FIVE 
OR JUST 
ESCAPE OKAY 
UM UH I STILL HAVEN'T GOT MY GLASSES ON 
YEAH OKAY 
SO THESE ARE THE SAME OF THE PICTURES OF EXISTING ONES 
I'LL JUST WALK YOU THROUGH THEM 
THIS ONE IS A VOICE RECOGNITION 
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF D WE'RE GOING FOR 
THERE'S UM AN L. C. D. THING WHICH WE THOUGHT COULD I THOUGHT COULD GET A BIT CONFUSING AND A BIT EXPENSIVE AS WELL FOR US 
THIS ONE IS GET A KIND OF SCROLL LIKE A MOUSE WHICH YEAH 
UM AND BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW YOU'D USE THAT LIKE WOULD THE COMPUTER COME 
UH-HUH THAT'S LIKE THE L. C. D. ONE IS IT 
BUT THE ONE BELOW THAT HAS GOT LIKE A LITTLE SCROLL FUNCTION IN THE SIDE 
BUT I PRESUME THAT THE FUNCTIONS MUST COME UP ON THE T. V. SCREEN 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THAT IS 
SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW IDEAS 
AGAIN THAT'S JUST QUITE BORING SHAPE GREY LOOKS QUITE SPACE AGEY BUT TOO MANY BUTTONS I THINK IN THAT ONE 
YEAH IT DOES LOOK KIND OF DANGEROUS 
UM THIS ONE I THOUGHT WAS REALLY COOL 
IT'S W IT'S GOT THE PROGRAMMABILITY FUNCTION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT 
YOU CAN PUT IT IN THERE IT'S FOR YOUR KIDS AND IT'S QUITE AN ORGANIC SHAPE AND THE LITTLE CIRCLE AROUND THERE IS PRETTY COOL 
AND THAT'S REALLY EASY TO USE BRIGHT SO I LIKE THIS ONE LOT FOR OUR DESIGN 
I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
OF COURSE YELLOW 
RIGHT YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
UM SO MAYBE THAT COULD BE BUILT INTO ONE OF THE THINGS AND IT COMES UP ON THE T. V. OR SOMETHING 
AND THIS IN THE OVER SIZED ONE I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU BUT I THINK IT'S A BIT TOO GIMMICKY 
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL SELL VERY WELL 
I GUESS SO 
I DON'T KNOW 
I THINK THAT'S A BIT 
YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH 
AND UM THIS ONE IS JUST POINTING OUT 
I LIKE SOME OF THESE THINGS UM THE THE RAISED SYMBOLS AND EVERYTHING 
BUT POINTING TO ME THAT THIS IN THE VOLUME IT IS KIND OF PRESSING DOWN BUT IT WOULD ACTUALLY GO UP BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE 
SO THAT COULD THAT'S A BIT CONFUSING 
UM BUT THE BUTTONS ON THIS I THINK OR IT'S JUST SHOWING YOU HOW YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM BUTTONS 
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME 
SO THAT'S QUITE COOL 
UM 
YEAH EXACTLY 
UM F. FIVE 
YES 
SO THERE ARE SOME OF THE FINDINGS 
SO WE NEED TO COMBINE THESE ONES UM AND I'VE JUST GOT AN E MAIL FROM OUR TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT THEY HAVE BROKEN THROUGH WITH SOME NEW SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE THAT YOU CAN PROGRAM IN 
UM YEAH IT IS JUST ONE TIME VERY HANDY 
UM SO I THINK MAYBE INCORPORATING THAT IN OUR DESIGN WOULD BE GOOD 
IT'S YOU PROGRAM IT LIKE YOU SAY RECORD UM AND THEN PLAY AND THEN 
RECORD PLAY MACHINE AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO THAT'S AND IT'S MUCH YEAH 
SO THAT'S QUITE COOL 
UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES JUST SOME IMAGINATION THE RAISED SYMBOLS I THOUGHT WERE GOOD THE L. C. D. IT DOES LOOK SMART 
BUT I THINK MAYBE FOR OUR BUDGET DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE A BIT TOO EXPENSIVE TO HAVE THE 
YEAH 
AND THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 'CAUSE I THINK WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION ARE WE 
UH-HUH 
UH-HUH 
BUT OUR BUDGET WE'VE YEAH 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
I'M NOT SURE IF THE F FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS UH PR UH TWELVE EUROS FIFTY M MANUFACTURING COST 
THE L. C. D. 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH 
SO 
UH-HUH 
YEAH THAT'S THE THING BECAUSE 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE YEAH 
AND ONE OF THE SURVEY FINDINGS WAS THAT THEY WANT TO SAY IT IS SO I THINK I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE L. C. D. 
IT'S A IT'S GREAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT FOR OUR BUDGET AND FOR THE THING WE'RE TRYING TO GO FOR US EASY TO USE 
IT'S NOT THE THING WE SHOULD GO FOR I THINK 
CHILD FRIENDLY I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOOD AS YOU POINTED OUT THE UM 
THE BIT TOO OFTEN GOES MISSING ESPECIALLY WITH CHILDREN 
BUT IT'S A GOOD SHAPE AND THE ORGANIC IS KIND OF WE COULD MAKE A VEGETABLEY KIND OF ROUND SHAPE I THINK 
YEAH I KNOW CARROT 
YEAH 
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO TO BE YEAH 
UM THE CHILD FRIENDLY YEAH 
EASY TO USE IT SEEMS QUITE EASY TO USE 
I LIKE THE DO THE DIFFERENT SHAPES OF THE BUTTONS AND STUFF 
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GO FOR 
YEAH 
AND THE MOUSE NO I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE PEOPLE USE MO MICE MOUSES NOW WITH THE SCROLLING THING 
UM 
YEAH 
SO YEAH 
SO THEY'D BE ABLE TO USE THAT UM SO I SAID I THINK I I'D PRESUME IT WOULD COME UP ON THE SCREEN 
UM SO THERE YOU GO 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S UM THE USER INTERFACE 
DESIGN 
SO OKAY I'LL TAKE THIS IT NOW THEN 
THERE YOU GO 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE SPONGE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I LIKE THE RUBBER THE STRESS BALLS I THINK YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE A BIT OF A GIMMICK LIKE IT'S GOOD TO HOLD AND 
YEAH 
AND THAT MIGHT BE QUITE DURABLE AND EASY TO CHUCK AROUND 
YEAH Y YELLOW INCORPORATED YEAH 
I THINK 
MM 
YEAH THE BUTTONS WE LOOK 
'CAUSE THERE'S GONNA BE THE THE COVER THE THE RUBBER OR THE PLASTIC CASING AND THEN THE BUTTONS ON PROBABLY TWO DIFFERENT COLOURS OR I IF WE'RE HAVING BUTTONS ACTUALLY 
I DON 
YEAH 
YOU DO HAVE ONES LIKE UM PLAY COULD BE GREEN OR ONE AND OFF IS RED AND STUFF LIKE THAT YEAH 
MAKES IT EASY TO USE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE THAT BLUE ONE DID LOOK QUITE HARDISH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LIKE UH AN HOUR GLASS KIND OF FIGURE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING OF OR JUST LIKE A 
IT'S NOT YEAH 
WE COULD MAKE NOVELTY REMOTE CONTROLS 
YEAH 
BUT THEN HOW WOULD YOU PAINT IT 
HOW WOULD YOU PAINT IT 
WHAT 
YEAH 
Y I'M I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE BANANA IDEA 
RUBBER BANANA 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I THINK MAYBE JUST DRAW ON THE KIND OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SHAPE 
AND WHAT ELSE DID YOU SAY ABOUT FASHIONS 
WHAT WAS TRENDY 
AND SPONGY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE YEAH 
LIKE WHAT'S WHAT'S THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE NAME OF IT SOME KIND OF 
YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S LIKE LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE SNOWMAN KIND OF THING 
I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THAT 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING 
YEAH MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE 
'CAUSE THAT YOU CAN HOLD IT IN LIKE THE BOTTOM BIT AND 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT DO YOU GUY WHAT DO YOU THINK 
NO 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
AND BUTTONS WOULD DID WE SAY 
UH DIFFERENT SHAPES OF BUTTONS 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH WHAT ABOUT THE SCROLL WHEEL AND SPEECH RECOGNITION 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I'M NOT SURE 
UM I MEAN THESE IDEAS I SAW WERE JUST FOR INSPIRATION I THINK 
UM YEAH I CAN NO I'M NOT SURE 
I COULDN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S COOL 
SO LET'S NOT SO THE WHITEBOARD ANY MORE 
AND UH SO WHAT ELSE WAS THERE 
UM THE WHAT ABOUT THE GLOW IN THE DARK THING THE STRIP AROUND IT 
ARE WE JUST GONNA LEAVE THAT 
YOU STILL LIKE IT 
'CAUSE WE'VE GOT THE UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
'CAUSE UM IT COULD YEAH 
ESPECIALLY WITH YELLOW 
MM 
I DUNNO 
THEN YOU PUT IT IN THE FRUIT BOWL 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH DO WE NEED BUTTONS 
MM 
I QUITE LIKE THE SHAPE 
I QUITE LIKE THE DESIGN OF THAT UH 'CAUSE THAT COULD SIT ON ITS OWN AND IT'S QUITE GOT A QUITE STEADY BASE 
UM 
AND SO WE SAY WE N WE DON'T WANNA BE TOO RIDICULOUS WITH THE FRUIT THINGS YOU KNOW 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 'CAUSE YOU SAID ABOUT DISPOSABLE DIDN'T YOU 
YOU SAID ABOUT DISPOSABLE EARLI PEOPLE WANT DISPOSABLE THINGS SO WE COULD DO THAT LIKE HAVE A CHOICE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WE STILL NEED THE BUTTONS ON THE SAME PLACES THOUGHT DON'T WE 
OH THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE 
OH OKAY 
UH HALF A FRUIT 
OH OKAY OKAY 
OKAY OKAY 
OKAY 
MM MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL UM BECAUSE WELL I I'M NOT SURE IF WE SHOULD GO AS FAR IN THE WHOLE FRUIT THING 
BECAUSE I THINK WE SHOULD MAYBE JUST TAKE THE INSPIRATION FROM THE FRUIT AND UH BECAUSE WHAT YEAH 
W I THINK WHO WHO WOULD WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS WHO WANT IT QUITE TRENDY AS WELL THEY SAID 
THEY WANTED SOMETHING THAT LOOKS FANCY AND I THINK MAYBE FRUIT COULD BE A BIT OF A TOO MUCH OF A GIMMICK BUT SOMETHING ERGONOMICALLY SHAPED AND ORGANIC 
LOOK GOOD TO HOLD BASED ON FRUITS AND NATURAL THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE AL ALREADY WE'RE GOING A BIT GAUDY WITH THE YELLOW YOU KNOW 
I MEAN WE COULD MAKE IT NICE PALE YELLOW 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE THAT PALE YELLOW AND THEN AN OUTSIDE BIT BRIGHT YELLOW WITH YOU SAID THE LOGAN THE SLOGAN

OKAY COOL 
THEN WE SHALL START WITH A PRESENTATION FROM RAJ 
ALRIGHT OKAY 
FASHION 
MM 'KAY

EXCUSE ME 
OH YEAH 
MM 'KAY 
THERE 
OH OKAY 
RIGHT OKAY 
YEAH

UH IT'S KINDA LIKE SCROLLING UH RIGHT WELL 
IF I SEE IF I'M THINKING OF THE RIGHT ONE I'VE GOT THE SAME THING IN FRONT OF MY MONITOR 
YOU SCROLL IT AND THE WHEN YOU REACH THE SORT OF UM MENU ITEM THAT YOU REQUIRE YOU PRESS THE MIDDLE OF THE SCROLL 
RIGHT OKAY 
YEAH PRESUMABLY 
YEAH LOOKS LIKE UH LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A JET 
OKAY 
YEAH I AM I MEAN THE ONE THING I THINK ABOUT ABOUT THIS NOISE IS UM THESE KL UH SECURED AREAS UM 
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THEM WITH THE THE COVER MISSING

OKAY 
YEAH 
I CAN'T USE THE ALTHOUGH TH I MEAN TO BE TO BE SURE THEY HAVE GOT I MEAN THEY ARE GOING CRAZY WITH THE L. C. D. TECHNOLOGY NOW 
SO THAT YOU'VE GOT YOUR L. C. D. T. V. S AND EVERYTHING SO MAYBE THE SMALL 
BUT I MEAN LIKE I I TH BLACK AND WHAT I GUESS IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK FUNKY ENOUGH 
UM BUT I MEAN LIKE EVEN MOBILE PHONES OR WHATEVER HAVE NOW HAVE COLOUR L. C. D. SCREENS 
W I JU I MEAN I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE COSTS OF THEM 
TWELVE FIFTY 
POSSIBLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
RIGHT

UM SO MAYBE IS UH A SORT OF UH PLASTIC INITIAL PLASTIC WITH A A LATEX KINDA SHEATH 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT STUFF SO

LET'S THAT'LL MAKE IS FIFTY MILLION EUROS 
UM 
WELL 
I GUESS IT'S KIND OF DRA UH YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE TO SORT OF CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS A FRUIT JUST TO HAVE THAT KIND OF FRUITISH SHAPE 
YEAH 
YEAH WE CAN RELATE IT BY ADVERTISING OR 
YEAH 
THERE'S A GOOD MAN 
THERE'S A GOOD IDEA 
UM I LI I SEE I MEAN FOR THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS YOU KNOW UP AND DOWN UH PLAY STOP 
THEY'VE GOT I MEAN THEY'VE GOT STANDARD SORT OF INTUITIVE UM 
THINGS THAT ARE ALWAYS USED 
THAT'S COOL 
I LIKE IT 
UM 
UH SPEECH RECOGNITION I THINK SO WE NEED A MICROPHONE PRESUMABLY 
YEAH 
I MEAN HO HO H WEL ARE WE SURE THAT SCROLL WHEEL DOES GIVE EASE OF US 
GLAD WE'RE NOT DOING THIS FOR REAL 
YEAH 
AND UH I THINK OF THIS THIS NEW SOFTWARE FOR THE SOUND RECOGNITION IS THE MICROPHONE 
I WOULD PUT IT SORT OF SUB CENTRALLY SO IT'S YEAH 
SO IT CAN BE SORT OF HELD AND WE WE REALLY NEED REALLY GONNA NEED TO HOLD IT IF IT'S GONNA BE VOICE RECOGNITION 
OOPS 
UM 
UPSIDAISY 
I SEE I STILL LIKE IT 
UM BUT THAT'S ME 
YES OR MAYBE IT'S JUST GOING A BIT UH IT FOR 
I MEAN WE ARE PUSHING IT PROBABLY WITH FUNNY FRUIT SHAPES 
UM DON'T WANNA SORT OF OVERKILL 
'CAUSE I MEAN LIKE UH IF WE I MEAN HOW GOOD IS THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THING 
DO WE WANT TO GO FOR BUTTONS AT ALL DO WE WANT TO JUST HAVE A DEVICE THAT MAYBE SITS AND PRETENDS IT'S A FRUIT 
YEAH YOU KNOW AND THEN YOU JUST TAL I MEAN LIKE EVERYBODY'S GOT FRUIT BOWL IN FRONT OF THE TELLY

IT KIND OF OF IT FITS WITH F FITS WITH MARKETING UM 
LIKE LIKE MOBILES YEAH 
YOU CAN STANDARDISE THOSE I MEAN 
I THINK TH I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A FACIA THEN YOU'D WANT TO HAVE TO USE THAT IT DOES GO OVER THE BUTTONS 
'CAUSE WHEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF THEY'RE WANTING TO 'CAUSE THEY WANT TO LOOK AT IT 
IF THEY'RE USING IT AND WHAT THEY WANT TO LOOK AT IS FACING AWAY FROM THEM 
IT DOESN'T REALLY 
YOU KNOW 'CAUSE THAT'D BE IN THE PALM OF OTHER HAND AND THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE IT 
UNLESS YOU HAVE SORT OF YOU GET THE BUTTONS OPTIONS IN ONE SIDE 
AND YOU GET THE FACIA ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH A MICROPHONE IS THAT YOU CAN PLACE TO FACE DOWN 
AND YOU'VE GOT THE FACIA AND YOU CAN JUST TALK TO THE 
MAYBE 
SO YOU'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO HALF A DOZEN OPTIONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY SO WE STICK WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT THREE 
MM 'KAY 
MM-HMM

OH THAT'S TRUE 
I MEAN I W I W UH THAT DO THAT I THOUGHT UM JUST IN THE BASIS OF LIKE RIDDING THEM OF BATTERIES AND THAT KIND OF BOTHER IS HAVING A 
YEAH HAVING A RECHARGEABLE STAND SO THAT NOT ONLY IT DOUBLES AS A STAND 
BUT UM FOR USING IT IS UH RECHARGING IT BUT ALSO FOR USING IT IS SOUND RECOGNITION 
YEAH THAT KIND OF THING 
YEAH 
RECHARGEABLE 
WHAT'S CHIP ON PRINT 
WHAT'S 
SORRY NEVER MIND 
YEAH AND IF WE IF WE'RE JUST HAVING BUTTONS AND THE SPEECH THEN WE'RE GETTING OUR CHEAPEST OPTION OF 
CHIPPING 
THAT'S GOOD 
UH WHA

OH OOPS 
SORRY MAN 
OH OKAY STILL DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET DOWN ALL THE LAST BITS SO WE HAD RECHARGEABLE AND 
OH 
APPLES 
MM MM MM MM MM 
'KAY SO WE COME UP WITH THAT THAT'S OKAY 
WHAT'S SUPPLEMENTS 
SUPPLEMENTS 
UH UH 
SO 
I SHOULDA SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IF I KN SEE I I KNOW THAT 
I SHOULDA SORT OF ENGINEERED IT SO WE K ENDED UP MAKING A DIFFI DIFFICULT SHAPE 
JUST FOR CRUELTY 
I WONDER IF THEY MEAN LIKE LITERALLY MAKE IT SORT OF BUTTONS AND EVERYTHING 
UM 
OH NO I THINK THAT'S AS OUR DISCUSSION OVER UNLESS ANYBODY'S GOT QUESTIONS OR CONFUSIONS 'CAUSE I'M CONFUSED 
HUH 
UM UH WE'LL PROBABLY GET QUESTIONNAIRE IN A MINUTE IT'S A 
THERE WE GO 
WARNING FINISH MEETING NOW 
I ROUNDED IT UP FOR TOO FAST 
UM 
WHERE ARE WE GOING 
MY DOCUMENTS THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT 
MY PROJECT DOCUMENTS 
THERE WE GO 
NO 
WE SHOULD MAKE A BIG SPONGE LEMON AND THEN IT'D BE IT WOULD BE YELLOW 
IT'S YEAH 
MM 
NO IT'S GOT IT'S GOT IT 
WOW 
UH IT LOOKS THREATENING 
IT LOOKS LIKE YEAH 
WOW 
THEN D BLIND DON'T WATCH T. V. 
THEY DO 
THE L. C. D. AND THE OTHER STUFF UH I THINK 
BEN BANA 
HMM 
BUT UH PRICE PRICE NOT WITHSTANDING UM SO IT TOO COMPLICATED IS IT GONNA BE TOO MUCH JUST OVERLOAD 
BUT BUT THE THING IS WHEN YOU USE A REMOTE CONTROL YOU NEVER LOOK AT IT RIGHT 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE T. V. AND AND IT'S UH IT JUST SEEMS KIND OF LIKE A A NEEDLESS TH 
SO WHICH VEGETABLE 
OKAY 
THE THE LEMON 
WELL WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS 
OH 
OKAY 
UM SO 
I GUESS THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM AMONG 
AND I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU THE UH I GUESS TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THIS 
AND I'M GONNA USE THE WHITEBOARD JUST 'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T SAID IT 
RIGHT 
SO THE WAY I'M GONNA DO THIS IS UH WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OLD REMOTE CONTROLS SEE HOW THEY WORK 
UH REUSE THE THE VITAL KIND OF UM ESSENTIAL PIECES OF IT AND THEN WE'LL THROW IN OUR NEW INNOVATIONS UM AND KEEP IT ALL WITHIN BUDGET 
SO UH YEAH LOOKING INSIDE A A VERY SIMPLE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM THIS IS WHAT THEY SENT ME 
'KAY 
HERE'S UH THE COMPETITION I SUPPOSE 
UM YOU OPEN IT UP THERE'S A CIRCUIT BOARD INSIDE UM AND THERE'S A A CHIP 
A PROCESSOR THE T. A. ONE ONE EIGHT THREE FIVE WHICH UM RECEIVES INPUT FROM THE BUTTONS AND EACH 
RIGHT IT'S VERY THEY'RE VERY CHEAP REMOTE 
THIS REMOTE COSTS NOTHING YOU KNOW 
UM SO THAT TAKES A SIGNALS FROM THE BUTTONS AND TRANSLATES IT INTO A SEQUENCE OF PULSES THAT IT THEN SENDS OUT THE AT THE AMPLIFIER 
WHICH IS MADE OF SOME TRANSISTORS AND AMPLIFIERS 
OP AMPS AND THEN THAT GETS SENT TO THE UH AT THE L. E. D. LIGHT 
WHICH I CAN KINDA IS IS THAT LITTLE RED LIGHT BULB AT THE END AND THAT SENDS OUT THE INFRARED UH LIGHT SIGNAL TO THE TELEVISION 
UH HERE TO USE 
UM SO THIS IS KIND OF THE THE BEAR ESSENTIALS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT IT DEFINES THE UH 
OR UM NO I MEAN THIS IS A VERY OLD ONE IS NOW WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THIS IS A A MINIMALLY SMALL AND CHEAP THING TO MAKE 
RIGHT 
SO THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE FOR CREATION 
UM 
SO YOU KNOW SO WE SAID WE GET THE OUTER CASING WHICH WE HAVE TO DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT'S IT GONNA BE 
UM THE BOARD WE HAVE IT IS BASICALLY UH THE SAME SET UP 
PROCESSOR UM WE'LL PROBABLY IS THE MORE ADVANCED PROCESSOR THAN THEY HAD AMPLIFIER AND TRANSMITTER ARE ALL STANDARD 
UM SO FOR THE CASING UH THIS ONE E MAIL I GOT FROM OUR MANUFACTURING TEAM 
UH YOU KNOW WE HAVE A BUNCH OF OPTIONS FROM WOOD TITANIUM RUBBER PLASTIC WHATNOT 
UM LATEX DOUBLE CURVED CURVED 
SO LOTS OF CHOICES WHAT DO WE THINK 
UH OR SPONGE I GUESS ISN'T IN THERE RIGHT 
ORGANIC SPONGE 
OH YEAH IT'S VERY ELASTICY FOR SURE 
UM 
YEAH SO 
OKAY SO HERE OR A A PLASTIC 
UH LATEX 
OH RIGHT 
SO SOMETHING WITH GIVE IT IT 
OKAY 
AND 
AND THE COLOUR IS YELLOW RIGHT 
YELLOW OKAY 
UM 
MM' KAY 
SO YELLOW FOR THE BODY AND THEN WHAT COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS 
SO MULTI COLOURED BUTTONS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM 'KAY SO THE SHAPE WE WANNA GO 
UM HOW EXACTLY 
MAYBE 
DOUBLE 
WHAT ABOUT A BANANA 
YEAH 
OKAY LIKE WE COULD HAVE A BIG BANANA SHAPED REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE IT'S YELLOW FRUIT RIGHT 
UH I IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH AND YOU POINT I GUESS 
WE COULD HAVE A LITTLE L. E. D. S ON EACH AND 
IS A SPONGY BANANA OR YEAH 
OKAY OKAY 
SO 
SO MAYBE IN AN UNIDENTIFIABLE FRUIT OR FIABLE FRUIT OR VEGETABLE LIKE IS IT WOULD HAVE A STEM PERHAPS AND A 
MAYBE A IT'D BE S AXIALLY SYMMETRIC 
SO IT'D LOOK LIKE THIS KIND 
LIKE A GOURD ALMOST OR A SQUASH OF SOME SORT 
YEAH AND IT HAS A A CLEAR TOP AND BOTTOM SO YOU SEE YOU COULD SAY YOU KNOW IT TRANSMITS FROM THIS AND 
YEAH 
OKAY SO DOUBLE CURVED SINGLE CURVED WHAT DO WE FEEL 
OKAY 
OKAY UM I GUESS SINCE YOU'RE THE MARKETING GUY 
WE'LL UH 
OKAY WE COULD DO THAT 
UM 
OKAY SO 
SO BUTTONS 
OKAY JUST LIKE THAT 
OKAY 
WITH THE SCROLL WHEEL OR NO 
OKAY UH I COULD PUT THE MICROPHONE HERE 
OKAY THERE'S THE MICROPHONE 
WHERE SHOULD I PUT THE MICROPHONE 
OKAY WELL WE CAN DO SOME USER TEST WITH SCROLL WHEELS RIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO SHOULD THE MICROPHONE BE JUST ANYWHERE IN IT OR 
'KAY THERE'S THE MIC 
UM NO WELL WE CAN 
WHOOPS 
UM 
YEAH 
UM 
OOPS SORRY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
HMM 
THEY CAN WORK FROM A YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOLD IT 
YEAH 
I IT COULD EVEN ENCOURAGE HEALTHIER HABITS FOR TELEVISION WATCHERS YOU KNOW THEY HAVE UH FRUITS ALL AROUND THEM 
NOW JUST MAKE SURE THEY DON'T AT THE REMOTE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
BUT YEAH 
BUT YEAH BUT THE SPEECH THING IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HAND HELD OR CLOSE 
IT CAN SIT AT A DISTANCE AND PICK IT UP STILL 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY UM SO 
YEAH SO I GUESS WE DECIDED ON MATERIAL RIGHT 
SO THAT THAT SPONGY LATEX RUBBER EVERYTHING FEEL 
AND THE COLOURS WE GET DOWN AND THE SHAPE MAYBE WE'LL JUST MAKE IT KINDA MIX AND MATCH TYPE OF SHAPE OR 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
GREAT 
UM SO FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE UM YOU KNOW ALMOST EVERY REMOTE CONTROL USES JUST BATTERIES BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE LIMITED BY THAT 
WE CAN USE A HAND DYNAMO 
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS WE CRANK IT 
RIGHT IT'S LIKE THOSE WATCHES THAT YOU C IS 
THIS MIGHT BE AN IDEA FOR SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANNA GRAB YOU CAN SHAKE IT IF IT'S OUT OF POWER 
OKAY 
SO IF IT IF IT'S NOT WORKING I GUESS PEOPLE'S NATURAL REACTION ANYWAY SO IT JUST SHAKE THE THING 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
UH THERE'S SOLAR POWER 
UM 
YEAH 
OKAY SO PROBABLY JUST 
MM 
'KAY 
OKAY 
SO UH A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY 
OKAY 
UM THE USER INTERFACE THE BUTTONS I GUESS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ALREADY 
UM 
HMM 
UH THE THE UH THE ELECTRONICS UM BASICALLY THE MORE FEATURES WE DID UM 
OOPS THIS ONE 
SO THE MORE FEATURES WE DID THE FANCIER CHIPS WE NEED TO BUY AND PUT IN WHICH ADDS TO THE COST IS YOU CAN EXPECT 
UM 
BUT UH I THINK WE CAN KEEP IT ALL UNDER BUDGET 
SO UH YES SO THE SPEECH THING YOU SAID OUR OUR TECHNO OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT CAME UP WITH SOME BREAK THROUGH 
SO JUST ONE TIME 
RIGHT RIGHT 
YEAH AND KEEPING THE L. C. D. SCREEN IT 
HUH 
OH YEAH THAT WAS THAT WAS IT 
SO CONTROL F. EIGHT RIGHT 
TRY UH FLIPPING THE SCREEN DOWN 
'KAY 
UH I GOT TO DO IT IT 
UH NOT 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
SAVE EVERYTHING AT THE SHARED DOCUMENTS IS THAT RIGHT 
OH 
UH THIS LAPEL MICS ARE TROUBLE 
ARE WE DONE WITH OUR MEETING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH ME RAJ AGAIN 
UH IN THIS MEETING I I'M GOING TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE TREND WATCHING UH HOW THESE TRENDS IS GOING TO AFFECT OUR MARKET POTENTIAL AND HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS 
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK ON THIS 
FIRST OF ALL METHODOLOGY 
THE MET METHODOLOGY TO FIND OUT THE TREND WAS INCL UH WAS DONE IN A WAY WE HAVE DONE A REC NOT ONLY A RECENT REMOTE CONTROL MARKET SURVEY 
BUT WE ALSO CONSIDERED THE LATEST FRE FASHION TRENDS OF THE MARKET BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THIS IS ALSO A FACTOR WHICH WILL AFFECT OUR SALES AND PROFIT 
SO WHAT OUR OUR FINDINGS 
IN OUR UH IN OUR FINDINGS WE HAVE SEEN THAT WHEN WE DID OUR REMOTE CONTROL MARKET SURVEY WE FOUND THAT UH PEOPLE L UH PEOPLE DO HAVE PREFERENCE FOR THE FANCY MOBI UH OF REMOTE CONTROLS WHICH LOOK AND FEEL VERY GOOD 
RATHER THAN HAVING A FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL UH GOOD 
SO THIS SH THIS CLEARLY INDICATES THEIR PREFERENCE FOR THE DESIGN THEIR OUTLOOK OF THE REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO WE SHOULD TAKE INTO UH WE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS FACTOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR BECAUSE THIS FACTOR IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT 
THE SECOND FACTOR WHICH IS FURTHER TI TWICE THE IS IMPORTANT IS THE ASCII IS UH THE THIRD FACTOR 
SO THIS FACTOR BECOMES THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN OUR SURV UH UH IN OUR MARK UH MEANS IN TAKE IN DESIGNING OUR REM UH REMOTE CONTROLS 
IN THE FIRST ONE IS THE UH THE OUTLOOK OF THE MOBILE THE IT SHOULD HAVE A FANCY OUTLOOK 
THE FANCY DESIGN UH RATHER THAN JUST HAVING A FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL GOOD IT SHOULD HAVE A FANCY LOOK AND FOO FEEL GOOD 
THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE A TECHNOLOGICALLY UH INNOVATIVE 
WE MUST HAVE SOME TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT IN THE REMOTE CONTROL THE RATHER THAN JUST PUTTING IT IS IT IS IS THE OTHER ROOM UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE 
SO IT UH SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE LIKE GLOW IN THE DARK OR SPEECH RECOGNITION SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO THAT INDICATES OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT 
AND THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT ON THE TO TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE 
LIKE IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH CO COMPLICATED THERE SHOULDN'T BE TOO MANY BUTTONS ON THIS MOBI UH REMOTE CONTROL 
IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO COMPLICATED UH LIKE THIS WAY 
AND IT SHOULD BE UH AND CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH MANUALS THAT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND IN THEIR LOCAL LANGUAGE SOMETHING 
SO THAT THEY COULD KNOW HOW TO USE THIS REMOTE CONTROLS 
WHEN WE DID UH F FASHIONS UH RECENT FASHION UH OUR RECENT FASHION UPDATE SHOWS THAT 
OH YEAH 
Y YEAH UH YEAH WE HAVE TO BECAUSE UH DO YOU CAN SEE HOW PEOPLE HAVE RELATED THEIR CLOTHES SHOES AND EVERYTHING WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
BECAUSE THE G WORLD SO NOW CHANGING IT'S TREND TOWARDS ORGANIC BECOMING MORE AND MORE ORGANIC BECOMING YEAH 
SO YEAH 
SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE WE SHOULD DO 
AND PEOPLE UH THE F FEEL OF THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY RATHER THAN JUST HAVING A PLASTIC LIKE HARD LOOK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO SO THAT THEY COULD PLAY WITH IT WHILE HANDI UH WHILE HANDLING IT 
SO THAT SHOULD ALSO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION 
SO THESE ARE MY VIEWS 
SO 
NO IT C YOU A THE RUBBER WHICH IS GOOD FOR HEALTH AND WHICH IS QUITE DISPOSABLE THAT WE CAN TAKE INTO CO YEAH 
'CAUSE WE IT SHOULDN'T BE HAVE ANY HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT ALSO BECAUSE OUR COMPANY IS VERY WELL FOR TAKING ALL THESE CONCERNS INTO CONSIDERATION 
SO WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY HARM TO THE SOCIETY SO 
SO THAT'S ALL 
SO UH WE DIDN'T FIND OUT ANY SUCH POINT 
OH YES THERE COULD BE BUT WE COULDN'T FIND OUT ANY SO 
YEAH 
OH NO 
YEAH UH YEAH UH YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
BUT IN OUR MARKET SURVEY WE HAVE SEEN THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE 
BUT THEY WANT THE QUALITY THEY WANT F FANCY LOOK THEY WANT SOME NEW DESIGN SOMETHING NEW 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
SO EVEN IF WE INCREASE OUR COST LITTLE BIT WITHIN UH SOME LIMITS AND WE GIVE SOMETHING NEW TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT AS WELL AS NEW DESIGN WITH FANCY OUTLOOK 
I THINK WE WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A GOOD SALES IN THE MARKET 
AND THE 
UH I IT WILL BE EASY BECAUSE THERE WILL BE AN L. C. D. S SCREEN 
THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT FRENT ICONS THEY CAN JUST CLICK OK OKAY WHATEVER THEY W 
OH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I APPRECIATE THIS IDEA BECAUSE THEN THIS THIS WILL HELP US IN OUR ADVERTISEMENT ALSO AND WE CAN RELATE WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THE PEOPLE'S CHOICES 
THAT WHAT OUR DATA SHOWS THAT IS THIS W THIS W 
UH THE FASHION TREND SHOWS THAT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES LIKE PEOPLE UH NOW 
SPONGY 
YEAH THEN ONLY WE CAN RELATE IT WITH SOMETHING 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
ARE WE CAN DO SOMETHING WE CAN DESIGN TWO THREE SHAPES AND WE CAN HAVE A PUBLIC SURVEY LET THE PUBLIC CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT 
YEAH SURE 
I WILL BE HAPPY TO DO THAT 
YEAH 
ARE WE CAN WE CAN DO ONE THING WE CAN JUST HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL AND CASINGS OF DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SHAPES 
DIFFERENT FRUIT SHAPES IN SUCH A WAY THAT A ANY CASING CAN BE COULD BE FIT INTO THIS MOBILE GENERAL PIECE 
SO WHATEVER PEOPLE WANT LIKE IF SOMEBODY WANT IT IN BANANA SHAPE 
WE WILL PUT THAT CASING ONTO THAT MOBILE PHONE OKAY IT WILL LOOK L UH YEAH 
NO THAT WE 
SO SO SORRY 
UH LIKE IF THIS IS A LOOK OF THIS IS A MOBILE PHONE UH WE WILL DESIGN CASING IN SUCH A WAY LIKE HALF OF 
WE NEED NOT TO HAVE A FULL COVER WE WILL JUST HAVE A HALF OF COVER OKAY 
IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO I IN BANANA SHAPE WE WILL FIT BANANA SHAPE CASING ONTO THAT IS IT WILL GIVE A BANANA SHAPE LIKE 
IF SOMEBODY WANTED AN APPLE SHAPE WE WILL DESIGN THAT WE WILL PUT WE WILL PUT APPLE SHAPE CASING ON THAT 
IT WILL GIVE APPLE SHAPE LIKE 
SO ON THAT WAY YOU CAN HAVE ANY THAT MEANS WHATEVER YOU WANT WITHOUT UH YEAH 
YEAH BUTTON WILL BE IN THE UPPER SIDE BUTTONS WILL BE THE ON THE UPPER SIDE 
YEAH BUTTONS WILL BE IN THE UPPER SIDE LOWER SIDE WE WILL JUST PUT THE CASING 
SO HALF OF THAT WILL BE LIKE THE YEAH NOT NOT THE UPPER SIDE 
SO FROM LOWER YOU CAN IT MEANS WHILE YOU ARE HOLDING OF FROM THIS SIDE YOU C YOU CAN HAVE BANANA LIKE ARE PEOPLE LIKE WHATEVER 
SO ON THAT WAY WE NEED NOT TO DO HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SHAPE MOBILES EVERYTHING WE WILL JUST DESIGN CASINGS FRUIT SHAPE 
AND 
YEAH 
BUT 
BUT BUT DO YOU THINK THAT IT WILL BE A GOOD IDEA TO USE DYNAMO TH THIS TYPE OF CELLS 
BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE HAVE IT WILL LOOK OF THE CELL IS OUT OF BUT YEAH IT UM YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE YEAH 
UH SOLAR POWER WELL WE ALSO NOT BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEN THEY HAVE TO KEEP M THEIR MOBILES OUTSIDE IN SOLAR ENERGY 
AND THE DAYS WHEN THERE IS NO SOLA SUNLIGHT YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT WE W YEAH 
I THINK WE SHOULD A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY WILL BE A GOOD IDEA 
THEY CAN THEY CAN RECHARGE IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH 
UH EXCUSE ME BRI 
YOU JUST TOUCH THE IPOD YEAH 
NO 
THAT'S GREAT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UH IT WAS UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME 
I WILL SHOW YOU IN SHARED DOCUMENTS 
UH WORKING COMPONENTS 
UH YOU DIDN'T GET THAT 
I WILL SEND NOW 
UH I'LL PUT IT IN SHARED DOCUMENTS AGAIN 
PROJECT DOCUMENTS SORRY I PUT IT IN THE SHARED DOCUMENTS

WE MADE THREE FOR YOU 
UM ONE'S BASED ON THE BANANA ONE'S BASED ON THE TOMATO AND THE OTHER ONE IS SET 
LIKE 
OH YEAH WELL YEAH WE HAD V SOME RED LEFT OVER 
SO 
OKAY SO THIS IS THE UM NON TO NINE UH NO BUTTONS ON OR SO MM FEW BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE MAINLY SPEAK RECOGNITION 
THE YELLOW THERE IS THE UM THE SLOGAN YEAH THAT WE NEED TO INCORPORATE IT'S VERY SIMPLE 
IF YOU DO NEED BUTTONS YOU CAN FLIP IT OVER AND THERE'S SOME OTHER UM BUT MAINLY IT'S SPEECH RECOGNITION 
YEAH 
YEAH AND YEAH THEY MIGHT PROJECT THINGS INTO THE SCREEN WHICH YOU CAN DO IN THERE 
MM I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT 
UM AND THIS ONE IS THE ONE WE MORE LIKE THE ONE W THAT WE LOOKED AT EARLIER 
YEAH YOU GUYS CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THAT IF YOU WANT 
YEAH SURE 
UM THAT ONE IS UH NO IT'S DELICATE 
THAT'S THAT'S ALREADY GOT ITS STAND THAT ONE 
THAT'S IT STAND 
IT DOES ALSO LIE FLAT BUT THAT'S THE THAT YELLOW STAND THERE REPRESENTS THE THE CHARGING STAND 
UM THE BLACK ON THE BACK IS THE SLOGAN 
OH YEAH THAT WELL WE DID THINK OF THAT 
YEAH IF IT'S STANDING UP IT'S IT'S IN THERE BUT ALSO WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE COMPANY NAME IN THE FRONT 
WHICH IS THE LITTLE BLACK KIND OF LINE IN THE MIDDLE 
SO UM AND THAT'S THE UM TRANSMIT THE L. E. D. THING 
THESE ARE THE S TWO SCROLL ONES WHICH WE THOUGHT COULD BE CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AND VOLUME UP AND DOWN 
WE N WERE WEREN'T SURE ABOUT PUTTING THEM THERE BECAUSE UM I IT'S IT KIND OF COULD GET BASHED 
YEAH 
WELL IF YOU HOLD IT YOU CAN YOU ALL CAN HOLD IT IS IT DOES ACTUALLY FEEL QUITE ERGONOMIC IF YOU'VE GOT SMALL HANDS 
UM OBVIOUSLY I DON'T THINK THAT'S REAL SIZED 
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A BIT BIGGER 
OKAY 
UM THAT'S A SPEAKER AT THE TOP SO YOU CAN SPEAK INTO IT LIKE A LITTLE WALKIE TALKIE AS WELL FOR SPEAK RECOGNITION 
UM AND UM THEN THE BUTTONS 
YEAH KIND OF SELF EXPLANATORY JUST BUTTONS WHENEVER YOU NEED THEM 
TRIED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE 
OH THAT'S THE CHARGING BASE PRONGS AT THE BOTTOM 
WE SAID THIS 
AND UM THEN THE BIG RED BUTTON ON THE MIDDLE IS THE ONE AND OFF IN 
IT'S NOT IN THE TRADITIONAL PLACE BUT UM IT'S QUITE AN OBVIOUS PLACE 
SO THERE WE GO AND AND UM WE HAVE THE BANANA BASED ON IT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO ARE THERE ANY UM IMPROVEMENTS OR ISSUES OR 
OH 
OH 
OH 
MM-HMM 
MORE LIKE A TRADITIONAL REMOTE CONTROL 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
LIKE AN S. SHAPE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
COOL 
COOL 
SO WE COULD EVEN ADD SOMETHING 
WELL MAYBE WE COULD ADD SOMETHING BUT MAYBE IF WHAT DO YOU TH WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE MONEY SO 
YEAH IF WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE DESIGN THERE'S ONE POINT IN SPENDING MONEY IF WE DON'T HAVE TO 
BUT IF THERE IS ANYTHING YOU THINK WE'VE MISSED OUT THERE THEN YOU KNOW FEEL FREE TO ADD IT 
MAYBE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE BIGGER SO THERE MIGHT BE MORE SPACE FOR THE THE SLOGAN ON THE FRONT 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN AN IDEAL PLACE RIGHT NOW 
MM 
I THINK IT WENT QUITE SMOOTHLY 
W I THINK WE WERE VERY CREATIVE 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
MM-HMM

OH THERE ARE ISSUES UH THERE ARE ISSUES 
UM MAIN PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BEING FINANCE 
UH LET'S JUST ENTER IN THE UM EVALUATION CRITERIA 
UM UNFORTUNATELY 
THE UNIT WE ARE CURRENTLY GOING TO PRODUCE MINUS THE EXTRA SCROLL BUTTONS UH IT'S GONNA COST US FOURTEEN POINT SIX EUROS 
SO WE HAVE TO REA SORRY I'VE ACCIDENTALLY HIGHLIGHTED SOMEHOW UM 
THERE WE GO 
OH GOD WHY IS IT DOING THAT 
THERE WE GO 
SO BASICALLY UM IN ORDER TO SAVE OR TWO EUROS 
UM I WAS THINKING 
THAT WE COULD HAVE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SHAPE BUT JUST HAVE IT FLATTENED 
UM 
YEAH I MEAN IT'S ALREADY GOT A KIND OF COOL SHAPE IS ABOUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE CURVED SORT OF ONE AND IT 
AND BY DOING IS UH NO HOLD ON 
DOESN'T SAVE US QUITE AS MUCH 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS AGAIN 
OH GOOD POINT 
UM 
THAT'S SORT OF CURVE ON AND IT 
NO I THINK IT MEANS DOUBLE CURVED IS NO UM LIKE UH A SINGLE CURVE ON THAT BOTTOM HALF 
AND THE DOUBLE CURVED WOULD BE IF IT WAS THAT SIMILAR CURVE UPWARD 
OKAY I MIGHT BE WRONG THOUGH 
I DON'T THINK THAT COUNTS AS A CURVE I THINK THAT'S JUST A SHAPE 
A CURVATURE IS LIKE THE THIS CASE 
YEAH AND WHY WHY I'VE GOT IT TWO I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T SEEM TO SELECT ANY MORE HOWEVER 
RIGHT 
NO 
IT'S MEANT TO BE ONE YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHY I PUT TWO IN THERE 
BUT UM HOLD ON TILL I FIND IT I THINK THIS SHIFT BUTTON MIGHT BE STUCK AGAIN 
NO MAYBE THE SHIFT BUTTON'S STUCK IN 
UM OKAY SO THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY THREE WHICH WOULD GIVE US 
OH THAT'S FINE 
ELEVEN UH ELEVEN EUROS SIXTY 
UM 
WE C UH NOT QUITE HAVE THE SCROLL WHEEL UNFORTUNATELY 
WHAT 
YEAH 
YEAH I KNOW THAT JUST EXTENDS IT AS WELL 
I DON'T KNOW 
IT ONE OF THE BUTTONS IS STICKING I DON'T KNOW

RIGHT RIGHT 
YEP 
IT WON'T STAND 
JUST LET IT LIE DOWN IT WONT STAND 
WHAT'S ON THE UH IN THE LEFT 
OKAY

THAT'S TOO BAD 
OH

GREAT LEADERSHIP 
YEAH YEAH 
THESE PENS ARE ARE NOT THOUGH

UM I'M GONNA GIVE IT A TWO 
TWO 
WHAT ARE WE DOING 
WE'RE GONNA AVERAGE THEM 
OKAY 
SO SEVEN FOURTHS 
BUT ONE POINT OF ONE POINT EIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH AROUND IT UP TO TWO 
SO TRENDS 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WANT US TO WRITE THERE 
HOW TO HOW CONFORMS TO THE CURRENT TRENDS 
'KAY 
SO FAR AS THE UH TECHNOLOGY IT ITS' GOT THE LATEST TRENDS IN SPEECH TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S MISSING THE SCREEN 
SO WE SAID UM BUT IT DOES HAVE THE PUSH BUTTONS ARE THE SCROLL BUTTONS 
UM BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT FANCY SOLAR POWER OR THE THE VIBRATING ENERGY MECHANISM 
SO I GIVE IT A A FOUR 
I'D GIVE IT A KINDA MIDDLE OF THE RED FOR 
FOR TECHNOLOGY 
YEAH 
WELL IT WAS YELLOW 
WELL I THINK IT'S THE THE REMOTE CONTROL CONFORMS TO THE THE COMPANY STRATEGY 
SO THAT THE QUESTION 
UM 
YEAH 
I'LL GO WITH TWO 
SO ON AND A HALF 
A TWO 
YEP 
SO 
OKAY 
OH 
HMM 
E EXCUSE ME I FORGOT MY 
COPY 
NO NOT MINE YET 
YEAH 
UH CAN I HAVE 
OH SORRY SO 
MM-HMM 
MM 
AND DOUBLE CURVE ON BOTH SIDES 
CURVE 
YEAH THIS IS DOUBLE CURVE NO 
THIS IS DOUBLE CURVE 
AT THIS ONE IS SINGLE CURVE 
'CAUSE THIS IS SINGLE CURVE THIS IS CURVED ON BOTH SIDES 
SO DOUBLE CURVE 
LIKE THIS ONE CURVE ON THIS SIDE ONE CURVE ON THAT SIDE 
HMM 
HMM 
MAYBE 
MM 
SHOULD 
UH YOU CAN DO ONE THING 
YOU JUST SELECT ONE BOX OUTSI YEAH THIS BOX 
THEN MOVE IT WITH THE HELP OF THIS OKAY 
JUST UH JUST UH OKAY JUST A MINUTE 
OKAY 
NO INPUT LIKE THIS 
SHIFT 
NO IT'S NOT 
YEAH IT'S NOT WORKING 
SHOULD WE ASK MELI SHOULD WE ASK OUR TECHNICAL EXPERT MELISSA 
YEAH 
YEAH WE 
YEAH 
YEAH THESE ARE NEW IDEAS LIKE GLOW IN THE DARK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WE DISCUSSED ALL THE NEW IDEAS ABOUT OF COURSE WE COULDN'T REACH ANY PROPER GOALS 
WE COULDN'T USE THIS BUT WE UH WE ARE USING THESE SCROLL BUTTONS LIKE THIS 
THESE ARE NEW IDEAS WE NEED NEW SHAPES EVERYTHING 
IT L YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
SO 
SO 
UH BRIAN HAVE YOU HAVE YOU FINISHED 
OH MINE NEEDS ALSO THIS 
AT LEAST MINE IS ALSO THE PRESENTATION 
YEAH YEAH 
UH IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED THAT IS MINE 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
SO 
SO NOW IS THE FINAL EVALUATION FINAL EVALUATION OF THE UH UH OF OUR PRODUCT 
HOW WE ARE GOING TO MEANS UH TO WHAT STANDARD WHAT STANDARD WHETHER IT MEETS OUR STANDARDS ARE NOT 
HOW UM WHAT RATING WE WILL GIVE IT THESE PRODUCTS 
SO OF COURSE THIS IS WILL BE A TEAM WORK WE WE TOGETHER HAVE TO DECIDE WHA WHAT RATING WE WILL GIVE IT THIS PRODUCT AND EVERYTHING 
SO WHAT METHODOLOGY I WILL TELL YOU ON WHAT BASIS WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS ALL THIS 
WE WILL GIVE THE RATING TO THIS PRODUCT BASED ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS WHETHER IT MEETS THE USER REQUIREMENTS OR NOT THIS PRODUCT 
THEN TRENDS WHETHER IT AS AS FASHION TRENDS ARE NOT 
MEANS BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY STATED THAT PEOPLE DO PREFER FASHIONABLE THINGS NOWADAYS 
SO THIS IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR OUR EVALUATION ALSO 
THEN MARKETING STRATEGY OF THE COMPANY 
SO WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT OUR COMPANY IS QUITE IN THE MARKET NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF PROVIDING QUALITY PRODUCTS 
NOT ONLY ONE PRO PROVIDING LATEST TECHNOLOGIES BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL S 
YEAH 
SO BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL SAFE PRODUCTS UH YEAH LIKE UH KEEPING UH KEEPING IN MIND ALL THE SAFETY ISSUES 
SO 
NOW COMES THE CRITERIA RATING WITH SEVEN POINT SCALE 
I'M HAVING THIS SCALE THIS SCALE SO WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A BIRD 
THE USER REQUIREM I THINK 
THANK YOU 
SO 
SO THESE ARE THE THREE CRITE CRITERIAS FOR OUR EVALUATION OF OUR PRODUCT 
FIRST OF ALL UH COMES USER REQUIREMENT 
SO WE WILL SEE WHETHER THIS PRODUCT MEETS ALL USER REQUIREMENTS OR NOT 
I I WILL FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR VIEWS WHAT DO YOU THINK WHETHER IT MEETS ALL USER REQUIREMENTS OR NOT 
SO 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WILL PERSONALLY GIVE 
SEVEN 
OH 
UH ONE IS MEANS HIGHEST RANKING OKAY 
BUT I THINK HIGHEST RANKING IS SEVEN OR NO 
OKAY RIGHT RIGHT 
SO IT'S ONE FOR FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW 
AND WHAT DO YOU SAY OUR INDUSTRIAL EXPERT 
UH DO YOU CAN YOU CAN TELL ON ON THE LIKE I THINK SHE HAS GIVEN HER VIEWS ON THE BASIS OF DESIGN 
BECAUSE SHE WAS RE I INTERFACE EXPERT 
BUT YOU CAN GIVE YOUR VIEWS BASED ON TECHNOLOGY WHETHER THE TECHNOLOGY MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CUSTOMERS ARE NOT 
TWO 
AND WHAT ABOUT UH YOU BRIAN 
YOU WILL GO FOR ONE 
OKAY 
UH FOR ME PERSONALLY IT IS EVERYTHING FINE IT MAY BE HAVING GOOD DESIGN 
IT MAY BE UH MEETING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CUSTOMERS LIKE TECHNOLOGY WISE PRICE WISE 
BUT THERE IS ONE THING WHICH LIMITS THE CUSTOMERS LIKE WE ARE HAVING ONLY TWO THREE DESIGNS 
LIKE WE ARE HAVING ONE BANANA DESIGN AND THE OTHER ONE IS ORANGE AND UH YEAH LOWER END 
AND THE THIRD ONE IS WHAT YOU GO UH THAT IS NOT A OF FRUIT LIKE 
BUT OF A PERSON DOESN'T LIKE BANANA OR ORANGE YOU ARE LIMITING HIM 
NO DON'T BUY OUR PRODUCT BECAUSE WE ARE L WE LIKE THIS ONLY 
SO WE ARE SHOWING OUR PREFERENCE FOR PARTICULAR FRUITS TWO OR THREE KINDS RATHER AND YEAH 
SO 
OH NO UH PERSONALLY AS A MARKETING EXPERT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE WHATEVER COMPANIES THEY LAUNCH THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE SHAPE OF FRUITS 
THEY GIVE A RANGE OF PRODUCTS A RANGE OF SHAPES LIKE IF WE USE 
LOOK AT THE SMALLEST THING TOFFEE CHOCOLATES THEY GIVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS 
SOME CHILDREN LIKE TO BUY BANANA SHAPE SOME APPLE SHAPE SOME EVEN PINEAPPLE SHAPE SOME ORANGE SHAPE 
SO YOU CAN WHAT SHAPE A PERSON WILL LOOK 
SO ON THIS CASE GIVING ONLY ONE OR TWO CHOICES WE ARE LIM LIMITING OUR CUSTOMERS 
AND BY LIMITING THEM WE ARE LIMITING OUR SALES LIMITING OUR PROFIT ALSO 
UH MAYBE 
OKAY BUT I WILL I WILL PERSONALLY WON'T GIVE IT BEYOND THREE 
SO WE CAN 
YEAH IN AN AVERAGE WE CAN THINK THREE FOUR SEVENTHS MAYBE 
THERE ARE FOR 
OH NO SORRY IT SHOULD BE 
NO SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY WE ARE DOING A VERY WRONG THING 
YEAH YEAH WE ARE TAKING EVERYTHING AND THAT'S I HAVE TAKEN IT VERY WRONGLY 
YEAH UH THERE FOR FOR TWO SIX SEVEN SEVEN SEV YEAH ONE PE EXACTLY 
SO WE CAN SAY ONE OR TWO 
BECAUSE IT IS ONE POINT EIGHT UH TWO SO WE WILL DO TWO 
YEAH 
SO WHERE WERE THE TRENDS 
SORRY 
YEAH AGAIN THE THE FASHION TRENDS THIS ALSO LIKE WHETHER IT IT WILL BE FASHIONABLE TO HAVE THESE PRODUCTS IN THE UH AS A FRUIT SHAPE OR SOMETHING 
OH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OH 
OKAY 
UH PERSONALLY I W UH I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF TRENDS THESE PRODUCTS ARE QUITE GOOD LIKE THESE PRODUCTS ARE IN FRUIT SHAPE 
BECAUSE THAT WHA PEOPLE NOW OR FASHION TREND SHOWS THAT PEOPLE LIKE EVERYTHING ALL OF EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING ADVERTISED LIKE CLOTHES 
SHOES AND EVERYTHING IS BEING ADVERTISED IN THE FORM OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE GETTING THEM ARE SHOWING SOME ASSOCIATION WITH THEM 
SO AND IN THIS WAY OUR PRODUCT IS GOOD 
AND THE SECOND THING NOW PEOPLE DON'T WANT ANY COMPLICATED OR BULKY PRODUCTS AND OURS IS QUITE SIMPLE AND QUITE HANDY 
SO THAT IS ALSO OF THAT ALSO OUR PRODUCT MEETS THE OF THE FASHION UH TRENDS OF THE MARKET 
AND YES 
IT IS CUS SPONGY ALSO 
SO THEY CAN PLAY WITH IT IT'S QUITE GOOD 
SO THEN I THINK MAYBE I CAN GIVE IT TWO 
SO FOUR FIVE TEN THIRTEEN THIRTEEN 
SO WE CAN USE IT FINE 
SO WHAT ABOUT COMPANY STRATEGY 
OKAY 
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU BRIAN 
YEAH AND UM ALSO LIKE THIS PRODUCT UM UH UM UH UM UH THIS MEETS ALL COMPANY STRATEGY LIKE OUR PRODUCT SHOULD BE AS PER CUSTOMERS' REQUIREMENT 
SO PER LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND IT SHOULD BE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFE 
SO SINCE OUR PRODUCT MEETS ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS SO I WOULD ALSO PREFER TO GIVE IT RANK ONE 
SO FOR SIX SIX 
HALF 
SO WE CAN SAY TWO OR NO OKAY 
SO THE SEVEN SEVEN 
OH OVERALL WE ARE GETTING TWO SOMETHING BUT WE CAN AROUND IT IS TWO 
YEAH 
SO I THINK OVERALL UH EVALUATION OF OUR PRODUCT IS QUITE GOOD 
SO WE CAN LAUNCH IT 
YEAH 
SO YEAH 
GREAT 
OKAY 
SO THIS IS UH FIRST MEETING OF 
THIS DESIGN PROJECT 
UM AND I AM LIKE TO SHOW YOU THE AGENDA FOR THE MEETING I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS SENT ROUND IT ALL OF YOU 
MAYBE NOT 
ANYWAY THIS IS THE THE PLAN FOR TODAY'S MEETING IS UM FIRSTLY JUST TO INTRODUCE THE PROJECT BRIEFLY 
UM ALTHOUGH I'M SURE YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT SOME OF THE INFORMATION ALREADY 
THEN THE MAIN PURPOSE IS IT IS THAT WE GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT MORE 
UM THEN WE WANT TO PRACTICE USING SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT WE'LL BE USING DURING THE THE COURSE OF THE DESIGN PROJECT AND THE MEETINGS 
UM SPECIFICALLY THE WHITEBOARD OVER THERE 
UM THEN WE NEED TO GO THROUGH THE SPECIFICS OF OUR PROJECT PLAN UM AND DISCUSS COME UP WITH SOME PRELIMINARY IDEAS ABOUT IT 
AND THEN THAT'S IT 
SO WE'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO DO THAT THAT'S UNTIL ELEVEN TWENTY FIVE 
SO SO ANY ANY QUESTIONS 
SO I 
NOT AT THIS POINT 
SO THIS IS OUR PROJECT 
WHAT WE'RE AIMING TO DO IS TO CREATE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR A TELEVISION 
UM WE WANT TO TO BE SOMETHING ORIGINAL SOMETHING TRENDY AND ALSO SOMETHING USER FRIENDLY 
SO IT HAS TO BE QUITE INTUITIVE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO USE THIS PRODUCT 
THE METHOD THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT THAT HAS OTHER COMPONENTS AS SUCH 
THERE'S THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OF THE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
WE'RE GOING THE WAY WE'LL DO THAT I THINK SO IT TO WORK INDIVIDUALLY INITIALLY AND THEN COME TOGETHER FOR MEETINGS TO TO WORK ON THAT 
UM SIMILARLY WITH THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN WE'LL START OFF BY WORKING INDIVIDUALLY WITH OUR OWN EXPERTISE ON OUR OWN LAPTOPS AND THEN WE'LL BRING WHAT WE'VE DONE TOGETHER 
UM AND THEN THE DETAILED DESIGN WILL COME AFTER THAT 
WE'LL PULL IT ALL TOGETHER 
I THINK AT THE W WE'RE TALKING THE THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IS MORE YOUR 
UM OUR OF THINGS WHERE YOU'LL BE WE WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT FUNCTIONS WE NEED ON THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WHAT WHAT SPECIFIC THINGS TO IT HAS TO DO ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN SO UM PERHAPS BIGGER THAN THAT AND INCLUDES THE HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE IT AND AND THAT KIND OF THING 
UM I THINK WE'LL WE'LL START THAT INITIALLY WITH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN ALREADY BUT THEN YEAH 
OKAY SO THAT'S JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE P THE THE PROJECT ITSELF 
UM WHAT I'D LIKE US TO DO NOW IS SIMULTANEOUSLY INTRODUCE OURSELVES AND START USING SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT WE'RE USING FOR FOR THE PROJECT SPECIFICALLY THE WHITEBOARD 
SO EACH PERSON IN TURN I'D LIKE US TO GO UP TO THE WHITEBOARD 
THE PEN'S JUST UNDERNEATH IT THERE AND DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND THEN TELL EVERYONE WHAT THE OF YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL ARE AND WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT TELL US YOUR NAME 
WHAT YOUR ROLE IS AND PERHAPS HOW YOUR ANIMAL RELATES TO THE ROLE THAT YOU'RE TAKING IN THIS PROJECT 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST 
OH YEAH P PUT THEM IN POCKETS 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HURRY WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME 
IT'S GOT AN YES 
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A CAT 
YEAH I CAN SEE BY THE EARS 
MM 
EXCELLENT AND WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S YOUR ROLE WITHIN THE TIME 
MM-HMM 
AND MORE ABOUT YOURSELF YOU'RE FROM 
MM-HMM 
BUT NOT WITH RABBITS 
EXCELLENT TO MATCH THE RABBIT 
THERE'S A ONE OF YOU HAVE NOT ENOUGH ROOM THERE'S AN ERASER THERE AND YOU CAN RUB IT OFF 
UH IT LOOKS LIKE A DOG 
THE OTHER LEGS ARE IN THE OTHER SIDE 
AND WHERE WHERE ARE YOU FROM 
ESTONIA 
GOOD LUCK 
MM 
IT'S EATING 
YEAH 
EXCELLENT 
RIGHT NOW NOW IT'S MY TURN OBVIOUSLY 
OKAY HERE'S A SPACE 
YEAH I LIKE THE COW 
I'M JEN 
UM I LIKE DOGS TOO BUT I CAN'T DO THAT ALREADY BECAUSE I CAN'T DRAW A DOG AS WELL AS YOU CAN 
I LIKE 
MM 
HMM 
IT'S A GECKO 
YEAH 
THEY'RE 
YEAH THEY'RE L IT'S A KIND OF LIZARD 
AND I I LIKE GECKOS BECAUSE THEY REMIND ME OF WARM PLACES AND 
AND WHERE I WAS LIVING IN CAMBODIA THEY USED TO LIVE IN MY HOUSE AND THEY WERE IN THE CEILING AND THEY WOULD MAKE LITTLE GECKO NOISES IN THE EVENING 
I DON'T LIKE SNAKES 
I CAME FROM AUSTRALIA AND WE HAVE NASTY SNAKES 
THAT'S WHERE I'M FROM AUSTRALIA 
I'M FROM MELBOURNE AND I'M YOUR PROJECT MANAGER FOR TODAY AND MY ROLE IS BASICALLY TO KEEP THINGS GOING AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL WORK TOGETHER 
IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY IS THAT BY THE END OF THE DAY WE COME UP WITH A GREAT PRODUCT 
OKAY 
SO LET'S SEE WHAT'S NEXT IN THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION 
SO I'VE JUST THOUGHT YEAH I'VE JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THIS THAT WE COULD EVEN PUT TOO MUCH MORE PROFESSIONALLY AS THERE WE GO 
OKAY SO THIS IS THE UM OVERALL BUDGET FOR OUR 
PROJECT 
WE'VE GOT UM WE'RE PLANNING TO SELL THIS REMOTE CONTROLS FOR LET'S MAKE THAT GO AWAY THAT MEANS WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES 
UM WE'RE PLANNING TO SELL THE REMOTE CONTROLS FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS EACH 
UM AND WITH THAT WE'RE AIMING FOR A PROFIT OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS 
AND THAT'S SELLING THEM IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET NOT JUST IN THE U. K. 
UM SO TO DO THAT OUR FINANCE PEOPLE ESTIMATE THAT WE NEED PRODUCTION COSTS OF MAXIMUM TWELVE AND A HALF EURO IS THAT WE CAN REACH THAT 
PROFIT TARGET 
SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND WHILE YOU'RE DESIGNING 
OKAY 
HMM 
THIS IS LET ME JUST SKIP AHEAD TO USE THAT'S THE LAST THING OKAY 
WE'VE ONLY GOT A COUPLE OF MINUTES 
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY FIRST IDEAS TO BOUNCE AROUND BUT UM WHAT WE'RE THINKING OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
MM-HMM 
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT W IT'S BEST IF WE TAKE AWAY WITH US 
BUT IF WE ALL HAVE A THINK WHEN WE GO AWAY FROM THE MEETING 
WHAT SPECIFIC THINGS COULD BE UM INCLUDED IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL THAT THAT ARE OUT OF THE ORDINARY 
SOMETHING SOMETHING NEW 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
SO PERHAPS SOME SORT OF MENU BASED THING OR 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO NO 
IT COULD BE ONE BUTTON FOR A MENU OR SOMETHING IF YOU REALLY NEED TO GO AND DO THAT 
MM-HMM 
EXCELLENT 
UH I HAVEN'T HAD A LOOK YET YEP 
MM-HMM 
GREAT 
ANY OTHER IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS BEFORE WE 
MOVE ALONG 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
IT'S LIKE THIS FANCY WEBSITES 
THAT YOU CAN'T ACCESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN IDEA HOW TO GET IN ABOUT THE DESIGNERS THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT 
OKAY SO WE NEED TO WRAP IT UP NOW IS THAT WE CAN GO AWAY AND GET IN WITH SOME OF THIS 
UM WE'VE GOT ANOTHER MEETING IN THIRTY MINUTES SO 
YOU'RE YOU'LL BE GETTING SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ONCE YOU GO BACK TO YOUR WORKSPACE BUT UM BASICALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WORKING DESIGN 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
AND FOR YOU IT'S THE USER REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION LIKE YOU SAID AT THE START 
OKAY 
THANKS FOR THAT 
UH I'LL SEE YOU IN HALF AN HOUR 
CARRY THE LAPTOPS BACK AGAIN 
DO WE NEED TO UNPLUG THINGS 
PROBABLY 
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT UM 
DO I HAVE A CHOICE 
OKAY 
UH UH THINGS FALLING EVERYWHERE 
RIGHT OKAY 
COOL 
OKAY 
SO MY NAME'S CAT AND I'M REALLY NOT VERY GOOD AT THIS WHOLE DRAWING MALARKEY SO UM 
OKAY 
OH GOOD POINT 
UH THE EYES ALWAYS RUIN IT 
RIGHT 
OKAY WHAT DO IT'S EYES LIKE 
OKAY COOL 
UM THIS IS A RABBIT 
YEAH I DON'T THINK IT'S FURRY ENOUGH SO WE'LL MAKE IT A FLUFFY RABBIT 
OKAY RIGHT IT'S A FLUFFY RABBIT BLUE 
RABBITS DON'T COME IN BLUE BUT YOU KNOW 
UM OKAY AND I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S SMALL AND IT'S FLUFFY 
AND ONE DAY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GETICAL GENETICALLY MODIFY THEM AND THEY WILL COME IN PINK 
OKAY 
I AM THE UM I AND MY NOTEBOOK MM UH TOP BANANA 
THANK YOU 
OKAY COOL I AM THE MARKETING EXPERT UM SO LIKE 
I'M GONNA BE DOING THE APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO THE LITTLE GUY IN THE COMPUTER THAT KNOWS EVERYTHING THE USER G REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION OF THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 
UM TREND WATCHING IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND PRODUCT EVAD VALUATION IN THE DETAILED DESIGN UM SO YEAH 
UM I'M FROM LEICESTER UM SECOND YEAR 
UM WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT TO KNOW 
I LIKE SPORTS UM YEAH AEROBICS KICKBOXING SPINNING UM AND UH 
NOT WITH RABBITS NO NO 
AND VETS I LIKE VETS AS WELL 
AND YEAH UM AND I LIKE COCKTAILS ESPECIALLY PINK ONES 
OKAY 
COOL 
IS A BIT MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN MY RABBIT 
I THINK IT NEEDS FOUR LEGS IF IT'S GONNA WALK THOUGH 
THEY'RE NOT JUST LIKE A BIG ROUND BODY AND THEN SOME REALLY SKINNY LEGS AND THEN JUST SOME HORNS 
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR 
HORNS DRAW SOME HORNS 
SO THAT A LIZARD 
SO THERE A DIFFERENCE 
IF YOU RIGHT CLICK ON IT YOU CAN 
YEAH I WAS LOOKING AT THE WEBSITE 
AND THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY'VE MADE AND I LIKE PUT DOWN SOME LIKE INSPIRATIONAL WORDS LIKE THAT I GOT FROM LOOKING AT THE PICTURES 
SO THE MOTTO IS UM WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS AND UM SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS SLEEK AND STYLISH BUT IT'S STILL FUNCTIONAL YOU KNOW 
SO I'M KIND OF THINKING YOU KNOW LIKE THIS PHONES THAT THEY HAVE 
THE NEW GENERATION ONES WHERE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY BUTTONS ON THEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
YOU KNOW IS SOMETHING HEADING TOWARDS THAT 
SO IT'S NOT OVERLY I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT UH MOST OF THE BUTTONS DO IN MY REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO I FIGURE HOW MANY DO YOU AND YOU KNOW 
OKAY 
SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE LESS CROWDED THAN THIS LIKE I MEAN YOU KNOW THEORETICALLY YOU CAN DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS WITH YOUR T. V. RIGHT 
BUT WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO 
THEY TURN IT IN THEY WATCH CERTAIN SPECIFIED CHANNELS YOU KNOW AND THEN THEY TURN IT OFF AGAIN 
SOMETIMES THEY PLAY A MOVIE 
YEAH SO 
THERE'S NO NEED TO HAVE BUTTONS ON IT TO DO THAT MAYBE TO DO 
YEAH 
SO IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF SAD CASE THAT KNOWS HOW YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WORKS 
THEN YOU KNOW THAT'S FINE AND YOU CAN DO IT IN THE SCREEN RATHER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE HAVING TO HAVE THESE BUTTONS WHICH JUST CONFUSE THEM 
HMM 
'CAUSE LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRAIN IT'S JUST VERY LIKE THERE'S AN EXTRA BITS ON IT 
THE TURN ON THE WEBSITE AND I DUNNO IF YOU CAN PUT IT UP ON THE THING UM BUT IT IS JUST LIKE A LONG LIKE THING USED FOR MU MOVING PEOPLE 
BUT IT LOOKS REALLY PRETTY IT 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH

NOT AT THIS POINT 
YEAH WELL ORIGI UH AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE CAT

YEAH 
OH

I AM I MEAN I'M NOT SO SURE BECAUSE I'M NOT SO IS VERY UM FAMILIAR WITH ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS BUT I DO LIKE DOGS 
OH SORRY MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BEFOREHAND BUT MM-HMM

UM YEAH AND I DO LIKE DOGS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD FRIENDS TO APPEAL AND THEY ARE LOYAL 
MM WELL THAT'S COMPARED TO SOME OTHER ANIMALS LIKE CATS 
UM THEY'RE REALLY MUCH MORE FUN BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SO INDEPENDENT 
UM 
YEAH MAYBE MAYBE THE FACT THAT THEY PROTECT THEIR HOME AS WELL YEAH 
UM WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH WITH MY ROLE IN THE PROJECT IS HARD TO SAY 
UH I HOPE TO BE LOYAL TO THE PROJECT AND NOT TOO N NOT TO UM LET PEOPLE DOING SIMILAR PROJECTS KNOW THE DETAILS OF OUR PROJECT OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
I'M FROM ESTONIA UH YEP 
UM SO SO THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW 
OH RIGHT MY ROLES UM SO UM IN THE DIFFERENT UM STAGES OF THE DESIGN 
SO AT FIRST I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ME FOR YEAH DESIGNING THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE UM 
UM OF THE REMOTE CONTROL UH THEN ON THE ON THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STAGE I NEED TO UM COME UP WITH UH INTERFACE CONCEPT AND THEN ON THE LAST UM STAGE I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INT INFA FOR THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
OKAY THAT'S IT 
THANKS 
IT LOOKS VERY VERY CUTE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WOW 
UH A GECKO OKAY 
IS A OR ARE THEY ALSO LIKE LIZARDS OR ARE THEY YEAH THEY ARE MM-HMM 
OH 
MM-HMM 
I HOPE YOU DON'T LIKE SNAKES DO YOU 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
WONDERFUL 
YEP 
I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER WHETHER THERE IS LIKE ANY SPECIAL FEATURE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE WE WANT THIS REMOTE CONTROL HAVE AS OPPOSED TO THE ALREADY EXISTING ONES 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT UH I MEAN E EVEN THOUGH IT HAS TO BE OUR ORIGINAL WE SHOULDN'T UH GO LIKE TOO FAR AWAY FROM FROM THE USUAL ONES 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE NEW USERS WILL JUST HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH L LEARNING YEAH YEAH 
HM HMM 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
SO YOU 
MM-HMM 
SO SH 
I'M A BIT CONFUSED ABOUT UH WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN AND CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
UH I SEE IT JUST UH MORE DETAIL UH SO I UNDERSTAND IT 
RIGHT 
HOW HOW IT WILL BE DONE 
SO WHE WHERE DO WE IDENTIFY THE COMPONENTS OF OUR UH PRODUCT 
UH I THINK IT'S IT'S IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE THAT WE IDENTIFY THE IT'S IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE THAT WE IDENTIFY THE COMPONENTS OF OUR PRODUCT

I'VE GOT AN IDEA HOW TO DRAW A COW 
UH THIS IS GOING TO BE 
YEAH THAT'LL DO 
OKAY SO LET LET ME DRAW THE BODY FIRST 
BIG ROUND BODY REALLY SKINNY LEGS AND THEY'VE GOT A LONG TAIL AND A LONG FACE 
AND THERE IS SOME GRASS THERE 
SO THIS IS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT COWS THAT THEY JUST KEEPS SITTING THERE EATING GRASS THEY DO NOT DISTURB ANYBODY UM THEY'RE KIND OF BUDDHIST IN A WAY 
SO YEAH I LIKE COWS 
UM MY MY ROLE IN THE PROJECT IS UM UH THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
SO I'M SUPPOSED TO DESIGN ALL THE DETAILS OF OF THE PRODUCT UM UH HOW IT WORKS AND WHATEVER IT'LL MM TAKE DURING THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE 
WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE PERFORMED BY TO UH DURING THE UM CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF IT AND UM FINALLY I'M NOT TOO SURE WHAT WAS THE LAST PART 
UM THE DETAILED DESIGN I I GUESS IT WILL AGAIN BE THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE COMPONENTS AND HOW THEY INTEGRATE WITH EACH OTHER 
UM I'M FROM AND 
UH I'M DOING MY P. H. D. IN PSYCHOLINGUISTICS I SIT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY 
YEAH 
THANK YOU 
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A COW DOES IT 
NO WAY 
OH OKAY 
UH-HUH 
MM 
THANK YOU 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I THINK UH I IN THE BEGINNING UH ONE THING WAS THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE MM TRENDY 
USER FRIENDLY AND ORIGINAL SO UM I THINK YOUR POINT IS RELEVANT AS FAR AS THE ORIGINALITY IS CONCERNED 
THAT WE SHOULD PROVIDE SOME FEATURES THAT ARE QUITE UNIQUE AT THIS 
MM 
ALRIGHT 
MM 
YEAH 
THERE IS A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY IN THERE THAT IS NOT USED NINETY PERCENT OF THE TIME BUT WILL BE USED TEN PERCENT OF THE TIME YEAH 
YEP 
AND THEN USE THE 
MM 
MM 
UH WE CAN AIM FOR I MEAN WE CAN THINK ABOUT ALL THESE LITTLE THINGS BUT WE CAN AIM FOR SOMETHING WE THAT GIVES A HIGH BATTERY LIFE 
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM FOR REMOTE CONTROLS ANYWAY BATTERY LIFE UH VERY NEW AND THEN YOU NEED TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES 
UM 
HMM 
YEAH 
A BIG LEARNING CURVE YEAH 
YEAH 
SO I IT SHOULD KIND OF FIT IN AS WELL AND THE STEREOTYPE OF A YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
HMM 
ALL HOOKED UP 
OKAY SO NOW WE ARE HERE AT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING 
UM HOPEFULLY THIS MEETING I'LL BE DOING A LITTLE BIT LESS TALKING THAN I DID LAST TIME 'CAUSE THIS IS WHEN YOU GET TO SHOW US WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING INDIVIDUALLY 
THE AGENDA FOR THE MEETING I PUT IT IN THE SH SHARED DOCUMENTS FOLDER 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANT THAT YOU COULD USE IT OR NOT 
DID ANYONE 
NO 
UH WELL 
UM I'LL TRY AND DO THAT FOR THE NEXT MEETING AS WELL SO IF YOU CHECK IN THERE THERE'S A SHARED PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER 
UM AND IT SHOULD BE IN THERE 
PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH 
SO I'LL PUT IT IN THERE 
SO IT BEST IF I SEND YOU AN EMAIL MAYBE IT LET YOU KNOW IT'S THERE 
YEP 
I'LL DO THAT NEXT TIME 
UM I'LL ACT AS SECRETARY FOR THIS MEETING AND JUST TAKE MINUTES SO WE GO THROUGH AND THEN I'LL SEND THEM TO YOU AFTER THE MEETING 
THE MAIN THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS MEETING IS YOUR PRESENTATIONS THAT YOU'VE BEEN PREPARING DURING THE TIME SO WE'LL GO THROUGH EACH OF YOU ONE BY ONE 
UM THEN WE NEED TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE SENT TO USE 
I JUST SENT TO THE LAST MINUTE I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT WE CAN SEE HOW THAT AFFECTS WHAT YOU WERE YOU WERE DOING 
UM AND THEN WE NEED TO 
BY THE END OF THE MEETING COME TO SOME KIND OF DECISION ON WHO OUR TARGET GROUP'S GOING TO BE AND WHAT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S THE THE MAIN GOAL IS IT CAME UP WITH THESE TWO THINGS 
TARGET GROUP AND FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES TO DO THAT ONE 
SO 
I WOULD 
SAY YEAH 
SO UH WHO IT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TRYING TO SELL THIS THING TO YEAH 
SO WE NEED TO YEAH 
WE NEED TO HAVE A FAIRLY DEFINED GROUP THAT THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON AND THEN LOOK AT THE FUNCTIONS UM OF THE DEM REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF 
SO WITH THAT I THINK IT'S BEST IF I HAND OVER TO YOU 
DOES ANYONE HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR GOING FIRST 
YOU WANNA GO FIRST 
OKAY SO WE NEED TO UNPLUG MY LAPTOP AND PLUG IN YOURS 
I ASSUME WE JUST PULL IT IT 
JUST BEFORE YOU START TO MAKE IT EASIER WOULD YOU THEIR MIND EMAILING ME YOUR PRESENTATIONS 
ONCE WE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT NOW BUT WHEN ONCE YOU GO BACK JUST SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO SCRIBBLE EVERYTHING DOWN 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
DO YOU HAVE ANY UM I DO ABOUT COSTS AT THIS POINT 
BR 
OKAY 
'CAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER I GUESS IF WE'RE IF WE'RE USING MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IT MIGHT 
INCREASE THE PRICE 
YEAH 
THAT'S FINE 
ARE THERE ANY MORE 
QUESTIONS OR SHALL WE JUST SKIP STRAIGHT TO THE NEXT ONE AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS ALL OF THEM TOGETHER AT THE END 
YEAH I THINK THAT WILL DO 
OKAY SO DO YOU WANT IT 
YES SHALL SHALL WE PULL THIS UP 
I THINK THAT HAS TO COME OUT OF THREE 
YEAH 
YEAH I THOUGHT THIS LAST MINUTE THINGS THEY'RE GONNA HIT YOU THE WORST 
IT IT TAKES A LITTLE 
UH AND HAVE YOU YOU NEED TO THEN ALSO PRESS ON YOURS FUNCTION F. EIGHT IS THE BLUE FUNCTION KEY AT THE BOTTOM AND F. EIGHT 
NOW IT'S COMING COMPUTER NO SIGNAL 
MAYBE AGAIN 
OKAY ADJUSTING 
THERE WE GO THERE WE GO 
UH IF YOU PRESS IF YOU PRESS FUNCTION AND THAT AGAIN THERE'S THERE'S USUALLY THREE MODES 
ONE WHERE IT'S ONLY HERE ONE WHERE IT'S ONLY THREE AND ONE WHERE IT'S BOTH 
OKAY SO ONE MORE TIME 
SHOULD YEAH JUST WAIT FOR A MOMENT ADJUSTING 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
IF I MEAN THAT WAS THE THE DIRECTIVE THAT COME THROUGH FROM MANAGEMENT 
BUT IF WE HAD A A DECENT CASE FOR THAT WE REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE VIDEO AND D. V. D. I COULD GET BACK TO THEM AND SO 
IT'S W IT'S JUST WHETHER IT'S WORTH ARGUING ABOUT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION OF MAARIKA BEFORE WE GO ON TO THE NEXT ONE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
SURE WE CAN DISCUSS THAT MAYBE AFTER THE NEXT ONE 
DO YOU WANT TO YEAH 
UH I'M GETTING HUNGRY 
YOU SET 
UH WE NEED TO DO THE FUNCTION KEY THING IS THAT IT COMES UP IN HERE 
HELLO 
SO IT PLUGGED IN PROP IT'S WORKING 
OKAY 
EXCELLENT 
IT'S M SWITCHING BETWEEN CHANNELS SORT OF RANDOMLY GOING THROUGH 
MM 
OH THAT'S A BIT DIFFICULT TO USE 
IF YOU EXPLAIN IT IT IS IT'LL BE FINE 
YEAH 
I LIKED THE I LIKED THE LITT OOH COME BACK 
NO 
OKAY 
MM-HMM THAT'S THE NEXT ONE ALONG YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THE REMOTE CONTROL 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S ALRIGHT 
MM 
KEYS AND THINGS LIKE THAT YEAH 
WHISTLE AND IT SCREAMS AT YOU YEAH 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S YOU EXCELLENT 
UM 
I'M JUST GONNA TICK YES 
SO WE'VE GOT ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES TO DISCUSS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THEN AGAIN I GUESS THE THE WHERE IT WAS MOST POPULAR WAS THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE BRACKET AND THE I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THEY'RE BUYING TELEVISIONS 
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH MONEY GENERALLY 
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT IT'S IT'S MORE THAT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE 
WHEN PEOPLE ARE REALLY MOVING IT AND THEY'VE GOT THEIR FIRST JOB AND THEY WANT THEIR NICE TOYS AND 
O UH IT'S NO SORRY WE UNPLUGGED IT 
HERE LET ME 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH THEY'VE GOT NO COMMITMENTS AND 
USUALLY NOT A CAR AND ALL OF THESE THINGS 
KIDS 
YEAH 
YEAH AND IF WE'RE IF WE'RE TALKING TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS A PRICE THAT'S NOT UNAFFORDABLE EVEN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT DO THEY 
BUT THE T. V. S ARE OFTEN KIND OF SOMEONE'S OLD T. V. THAT'S BLAH BLAH AND BE A BIT STRANGE TO HAVE A FANCY ROME REMOTE 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH IF WE IT IF WE TAKE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE BUT THAT THEN DOES IMPLY THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND INCORPORATE VOICE RECOGNITION 
SO THAT GONNA HAVE A AN IMPLICATION FOR THE TECHNICAL SPECS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WITH UM BUT WITH A T. V. REMOTE IT'S GONNA BE QUITE LIMITED IF WE'RE AT SAYING THE MAIN THINGS PEOPLE WANT TO DO IS ON OFF CHANNEL FIVE 
LOUDER THA THAT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY SIMPLE 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT MAYBE IF YOU WANNA LOOK INTO THAT JUST TO JUST TO CHECK 
UM SO IF WE GO FOR THE THE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE AGE GROUP 
AND THEN OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GET THE ANYONE WHO'S OLDER THAN THIRTY FIVE WHO WANTS TO LOOK YOUNG AND HIP AND TRENDY AND HAS THE MONEY 
THEN THEY'LL THEY'LL STILL GO FOR THE SAME ADVERTISING 
YEAH I THINK WE NEED BOTH 
YEAH 
MM 
UH-HUH 
UH-HUH 
SO THAT IF THAT WAS IN THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION THAT WOULD BE GREAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WATCH SKY AND YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY A POSSIBILITY 
YEAH 
SO THAT YOU CAN YELL AT IT YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S BUT THEN IF YOU'RE BUYING THE REMOTE SEPARATELY BUT YOU YOU COULD HAVE SOMETHING 
BUT I IF IT WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD LIKE STICK ONTO THE T. V. OR SOMETHING 
SOME LIKE A TWO P IF YOU BOUGHT IT IN A TWO PART PACK IS ONE PART ATTACHES TO THE T. V. 
THE L 
WELL THAT'S RIGHT BUT IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF HAVING DIFFERENT NOISES 
YEAH 
OKAY I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WRAP THIS UP UM 
BUT IF WE GO AWAY WITH THAT THAT KIND OF GENERAL 
UM SPECIFICATION IN MIND THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS WE WANT TO TO LOOK SIMPLE 
BUT STILL HAVE THE BUTTONS SO IT'S EASY TO USE BUT ONLY THOSE KEY BUTTONS THE MAJOR BUTTONS AND THEN IN SORT OF MENU ON 
AND THEN VOICE RECOGNITION INCLUDED AS AN OPTION UM BUT THAT OBVIOUSLY NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE WORKING TO USE IT WHETHER IT'S REALLY FEASIBLE AND SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS WE WERE MENTIONING UM 
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS TO GO BACK TO OUR LITTLE PLACES 
COMPLETE OUR QUESTIONNAIRE AND SOME SORT OF SUMMARISATION WHICH YOU YOU'LL GET IMMEDIATELY BY EMAIL 
SEND ME YOUR PRESENTATIONS SO THAT I CAN USE THEM TO MAKE THE MINUTES 
AND THEN WE'VE GOT A LUNCH BREAK AND AFTER LUNCH WE GO BACK TO OUR OWN LITTLE STATIONS AND HAVE THIRTY MINUTES MORE WORK 
UM I'LL PUT THE MINUTES IN THAT PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER BUT I'LL SEND YOU AN EMAIL WHEN I DO IT IS THAT YOU KNOW 
IT SHOULD BE IN YOUR DESKTOP SO ON THE YEAH 
SO I'LL PUT IT I'LL PUT THEM THERE AS SOON AS I'VE WRITTEN THEM 
YEAH AND EMAIL THEM AROUND 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE GREAT 
OH YEAH PUT THEM IN THERE 
YEAH THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO EMAIL THEM 
NO THEY'RE ALL CALLED SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS AND SOMETHING SOMETHING YEAH 
SO IF YOU PUT THEM IN THERE WE'LL ALL BE ABLE TO USE THEM AND REFER TO THEM IF WE NEED TO 
UM SO IT WHERE WE'RE GOING FROM HERE YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT 
YEAH 
WHATEVER THAT MEANS 
YEAH 
YOU'LL BE LOOKING YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT 
NO SOMETHING CONCEPTUAL AND YOU'RE WATCHING TRENDS TO SEE HOW WE GO AND SURELY VOICE RECOGNITION'LL FALL OFF THE MAP OR SOMETHING THAT UM WE'LL KEEP KEEP OUR OPTIONS OP HMM 
COMPONENTS YEAH 
NO WE HAVE WE HAVE AFTER LUNCH WE HAVE THIRTY MINUTES TO OURSELVES TO PREPARE 
SO THAT'S FINE W BEFORE LUNCH WE JUST HAVE TO COMPLETE THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND SOME SORT OF SUMMARY 
OKAY 
RIGHT IN TIME 
OKAY SO YOU CAN I GUESS WE'LL SEE YOU FOR LUNCH IN A SEC 
COOL 
DO YOU WANNA GIVE ME THE LITTLE CABLE THING 
YEAH 
COOL 
OH THAT'S WHY IT WON'T MEET 
OKAY COOL 
YEP COOL 
OKAY FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
ALRIGHT YEAH 
IT'S WORKING 
COOL OKAY 
SO 
WHAT I HAVE 
WH WHERE I'VE GOT MY INFORMATION FROM US A SURVEY WHERE THE USABILITY LAB UM OBSERVED REMOTE CONTROL IS WITH UM A HUNDRED SUBJECTS AND THEN THEY GIVE THEM A QUESTIONNAIRE 
UM SO IT WAS ALL BUT YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU KNOW 
WHAT'S THE MOST ANNOYING THINGS ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS AND UM THE POSSIBILITY OF SPEECH RECOGNITION AND L. C. D. SCREENS ON REMOTE CONTROL 
NOT THAT THEY ACTUALLY GIVE ME ANY ANSWERS ON THE L. C. D. SCREENS SO I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT BUT IT BUT ANYWAY 
UM OKAY SO 
WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HOW CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE SO YOU KNOW DEFINITELY YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT 
UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY 
UH THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT HAVE ON FASHION SENSE 
UH EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE TO GET UM YOU KNOW A NICE LOOKING REMOTE CONTROL 
UM CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS THEY DON'T MATCH THE USER BEHAVIOUR WELL SO YOU'LL SEE IN THE NEXT SLIDE 
UM I DUNNO WHAT ZAPPING IS ABOUT 
OH RIGHT 
BUT YOU HAVE THAT LITTLE THING THAT COMES UP TO THE BOTTOM AND TELLS YOU WHAT'S ON 
UM OKAY FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS SAY THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS SO THAT'S GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU KNOW 
WE WERE SAYING EARLIER ABOUT YOU KNOW DO YOU NEED ALL THE BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL THEY JUST MAKE IT LOOK UGLY 
OKAY 
COOL 
UM SO THIS IS MY LITTLE GRAPH THING 
MM K 
OKAY WELL I CAN SEND IT AT ALL OF YOU 
WHAT IT IS IS UM IT'S CONES 'CAUSE I THOUGHT THEY'D BE MORE EXCITING 
UM BUT UH WHERE'S TO GO 
BACK 
OH 
OH YES COOL 
OKAY I'M GONNA STOP PLAYING WITH THE LITTLE POINTY THING 
UM OKAY 
SO LIKE WHAT IT SHOWS IS HOW MUCH THINGS ARE USED RELATIVELY AND WHAT YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE FROM THAT IS THE THING THAT'S USED MOST IS THE CHANNEL SELECTION 
WHAT YOU CAN'T USE IS VOLUME SELECTION IT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN ALL THE OTHERS 
YEAH SO WHAT THE GRAPH SHOWS IS THAT YOU KNOW POWER CHANNEL SELECTION AND VOLUME SELECTION ARE IMPORTANT AND THE REST OF THEM 
YOU KNOW NOBODY REALLY USES AND SO THAT'S THE THE NUMBERS ALONG THE TOP REPRESENT THEIR LIKE UM THEIR IMPORTANCE 
YOU KNOW AS IN A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT AND 
YOU KNOW CHANNEL SELECTION AND VOLUME SELECTION ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AND THE POWER 
WELL IT'S NOT QUITE SO ESSENTIAL APPARENTLY ALTHOUGH I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT COULDN'T BE UM AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
I THINK YOU KNOW YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT HAVING THOSE BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE THEY'RE JUST NOT NEEDED AND THEY'RE NOT USED 
OKAY 
THIS IS THE ABOUT THAT THE EMAIL MESSED UP FOR UM AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FIDDLING ABOUT WITH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THING 
OKAY COOL 
SO UM OKAY SO THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE FIND ANNOYING ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS 
UH THAT THEY GET LOST THAT THE UH YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT INTUITIVE AND THAT THEY'RE BAD FOR REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
I THINK IF YOU'RE WATCHING ENOUGH T. V. TO GET REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY FROM UM YOU KNOW 
WATCHING T. V. THEN THAT'S THE LIST OF YOUR PROBLEMS BUT YOU KNOW IT'S UP THERE 
UM THAT YEAH 
OKAY SO UM I MEAN THE THE R. S. I. THING WOULD BE THAT 
LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE THE COMPUTER KEYBOARDS AND YOU KEEP YOUR WRISTS UP WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT ENCOURAGES YOU WANT SOMETHING WITH AN ERGONOMIC TO DESIGN THAT ENCOURAGES GOOD EASE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND YOU KNOW 
NOT STRAINING YOUR WRISTS WATCHING T. V. 
YES 
OKAY COOL 
RIGHT UM SORRY THIS IS PINK BECAUSE I WAS COPYING AND PASTING THE TABLE AND I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO WHAT IT IT AGAIN 
UM OKAY BUT THAT SHOWS HOW PEOPLE WHETHER THEY WOULD PAY MORE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE 
SO YOU CAN SEE FROM THAT THAT YOU KNOW 
YOUNGER PEOPLE TO THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE ARE QUITE LIKELY TO PAY QUITE A LOT MORE OF WELL QUITE ARE QUITE LIKELY TO PAY MORE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE 
WHEREAS AS PEOPLE GET OLDER THEY'RE A BIT MORE SCEPTICAL ABOUT IT AND THEY'RE LESS WILLING TO TO TRY TO 
UM SO CLEARLY VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT 
BUT UM YOU KNOW I D I DO WONDER HOW WELL THAT WOULD WORK GIVEN THAT A T. V. YOU KNOW 
TENDS TO BE PEOPLE TALKING AND UM YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU GOING TO STOP IT FROM JUST FLIPPING CHANNELS WHILST WATCHING T. V. 
UM OKAY 
COOL 
UM OKAY SO THESE ARE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
SO YOU HAVE SLEEK STYLISH SOPHISTICATED YOU KNOW IS SOMETHING THAT'S YOU KNOW A BIT COOL 
UM YOU KNOW FUNCTIONAL SO IT'S USEFUL BUT MINIMALIST 
UM THERE'S A THERE'S AN IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE SO WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE FILLING UP YOUR HOME YOU KNOW 
A LOT OF PEOPLE FILL UP THEIR HOME WITH BITS OF CRAP BASICALLY YOU KNOW 
AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS STUFF AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE WHAT THE HELL IS THAT WHO IS EVER GONNA USE IT 
YOU KNOW SO THINGS SHOULD EITHER BE FUNCTIONAL OR BEAUTIFUL OR PREFERABLY BOTH SO I THINK WE NEED TO AIM FOR BOTH 
UM OKAY THEN A LONG BATTERY LIFE LIKE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER AND UM 
YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING THAT SOLAR POWER WOULD BE QUITE COOL BECAUSE 
YOU KNOW YOUR REMOTE CONTROL JUST SITS THERE AND YOU COULD JUST SIT IT IN THE SUNSHINE AND SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT A BIT 
UM AND THEN LIKE A LOCATOR SO YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE YOU HAVE FOR A MOBILE PHONE OR NOT A MOBILE PHONE 
YEAH THAT'S IT YOU KNOW 
I KNOW IT'S WEIRD 
MY FLATMATE AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN THE WAY NOT IN THIS MORNING AND I WAS LIKE I NEED TO GET ONE FOR EVERYTHING 
SO YEAH SO MAYBE SOMETHING WHERE YOU CLAP AND THEN IT BEEPS SOMETHING A KIND OF SOUND THAT YOU DON'T OFTEN HEAR ON THE T. V. YOU KNOW 
'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT YOUR REMOTE CONTROL BEEPING EVERY FIVE MINUTES 'CAUSE YOU YOU'D THEN DELIBERATELY LOSE IT BY THROWING IT AT THE WINDOW OR SOMETHING 
SO OKAY 
COOL 
THAT'S ME 
CAT'S 
C 
YEAH I MEAN THAT'S THE THING IS THAT IT DIDN'T SAY IN THE SURVEY YOU KNOW WHETHER 
YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WILL PAY MORE FOR A MORE STYLISH REMOTE CONTROL BUT I'M ASSUMING YOU KNOW YES 
WELL THAT'S WHEN YOU GO TO UNI ISN'T IT 
SO YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
OH I'VE UNPLUGGED IT 
DO YOU WANT ME TOO 
YEAH 
SEVENTY SIX POINT THREE PERCENT 
YEAH 
YEAH I KN I MEAN I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS 
BUT I MEAN IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT THAT PEOPLE OF THAT AGE GROUP HAVE A HIGHER DISPOSABLE INCOME BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE LIKE I MEAN 
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE AT UNIVERSITY YOU'RE PAYING YOUR RENT BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A MORTGAGE YOU DON'T HAVE A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY YOU DON'T 
NORMALLY HAVE A CAR YEAH SO 
YOU'RE STILL LEARNING TO DRIVE ACTUALLY SO THAT JUST COSTS MORE THAN A CAR BUT YEAH 
UM SO I MEAN LIKE TO USE AN AGE GROUP TO TARGET REALLY I THINK 
NO I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THAT'S LIKE FIFTEEN POUNDS 
YOU KNOW I THINK 
YEAH I D I DON'T KNOW MANY PEOPLE WITHOUT A T. V. 
WE DIDN'T HAVE A T. V. LAST YEAR AND EVERYONE THOUGHT WE WERE OFF OUR HEADS YOU KNOW 
YEAH I D WELL WE'VE WE'VE GOT QUITE A D DECENT T. V. 
YEAH 
I THINK I THINK THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW NINETY ONE POINT TWO PERCENT OF FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS ARE SAYING YES 
I WOULD PAY MORE FOR A VOICE RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL DOES SAY QUITE A LOT REALLY 
YOU KNOW SO I MEAN THAT AND THE DISPOSABLE INCOME AND I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO IGNORE YOU KNOW 
IS NOT A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW 
NO IDEA TOTALLY 
YOU DO HAVE IT IN YOUR MOBILE PHONE THOUGH DON'T YOU 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE LIKE I MEAN EVERY MOBILE PHONE NOW HAS LIKE CALL THIS PERSON AND IT CALLS THEM 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
SO SO 
Y YOU'D MAYBE AND A CODE WORD 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
SO LIKE WHEN YOU SAY CHANGE EXCEPT THAT'S BEING USED QUITE A LOT ON T. V. SO MAYBE LIKE YOU KNOW REMOTE 
I MEAN HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE SAY REMOTE ON T. V. 
ALTHOUGH I ONLY WATCH CHARMED SO REALLY I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT LIKE SO YOU'D JUST SAY REMOTE FIVE YOU KNOW REMOTE TEN REMOTE IN TWO NINE 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT OF UH VOICE RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROLS 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT 
YEAH BUT THEN THE CODE WORD WOULD BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE I MEAN SKY ADVERTISE ON EVERY CHANNEL DON'T THEY YOU KNOW 
SO THEN IT WOULD BE YOU'D BE WATCHING CHARMED AND THEN THE SKY ADVERT WOULD COME ON AND IT WOULD CHANGE IT SKY 
YEAH YEAH AND THAT WOULD BE REALLY ANNOYING 
YEAH 
DO YOU NOT THINK THAT DEFEATS THE OBJECT OF HAVING VOICE RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL THOUGH 
YEAH YOU KNOW SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S MORE LIKE IF YOU LOST IT AND IT'S DOWN THE SOFA SOMETIME YOU CAN YELL AT IT AND IT'LL JUST CHANGE IT 
YOU CAN LOOK FOR IT LATER YEAH 
YEAH YEAH I SUPPOSE NEARER TO YOU ABOUT A B LIKE IF YOU HAVE SURROUND SOUND THEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 'CAUSE IT'S IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T LOSE THE THE BIT TO LOCATE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH DEFINITELY YEAH 
UH SO YOU YOU WANT OUR UM POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS ON THERE HEY 
OKAY 
THERE YOU GO 
BUT IS EVERYONE'S CALLED FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
OKAY SO THAT'S GOOD 
THAT'S ME DONE 
OKAY COOL 
NO 
MM 
UM UM WE IN IN A WHITE 
UH PROJECT PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH YEAH YEAH OKAY 
OH OKAY YEAH 
YES I THINK SO 
YEAH THE LAST MINUTE YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
OKAY 
HMM 
MM 
OKAY YEAH AFTERWARDS YEAH OKAY 
THANKS 
I THINK WE NEED LIKE SOME GENERAL DISCUSSION AT THE END PROBABLY 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK SINCE SINCE WE WERE DISCUSSING SOME UM DESIGN ISSUES THEN I I I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE OKAY YEAH 
THANKS 
UH I 
OKAY I HOPE WAIT 
SHOULD IT JUST 
THERE'S JUST NOTHING 
OH RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT UM 
OKAY 
NOTHIN OKAY SOMETHING IS COMING UP 
NO SIGNAL 
WHY 
OH 
MY MY COMPUTER WENT BLANK NOW 
ADJUSTING 
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN MY COMPUTER NOW 
THIS IS THE PROBLEM BUT 
UM 
UH NOW IT'S OKAY 
NO 
NO 
OH OKAY 
OKAY THAT'S FINE THAT'S GOOD 
OKAY LET'S START FROM THE BEGINNING 
SO I'M GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN UH JUST LIKE SOME SOME FIRST ISSUES THAT CAME UP 
UM 'KAY SO THE METHOD I WAS UM ADOPTING AT THIS POINT 
IT'S NOT UM FOR THE FOR THE WHOLE UM PERIOD OF THE UM ALL THE PROJECT BUT IT'S JUST TO THE AT THIS VERY MOMENT 
UM UH MY METHOD WAS UM TO LOOK AT UM THERE UM REMOTE CONTROLS 
UH SO MOSTLY JUST BY SEARCHING ON THE WEB AND IT IS WHAT UM FUNCTIONALITY THEY SAID 
AND THEN UM AFTER HAVING GOT THIS INSPIRATION AND HAVING COMPARED WHAT I FOUND IN THE WEB UM JUST TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE IDEA WHAT THE USER REALLY NEEDS AND WHAT UM WHAT THE USER MIGHT DESIRE AS ADDITIONAL UH FUNCTIONALITIES 
AND YEAH AND THEN JUST TO UM PUT THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IN IN WORDS 
UM SO THE FINDINGS UH WERE UM THAT THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS IS JUST SENDING MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET SO THIS QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD 
AND UH W SOME OF THE MAIN FUNCTIONS WOULD BE SWITCHING ON SWITCHING OFF 
UH THEN THE USER WOULD LIKE TO SWITCH THE CHANNEL UM FOR EXAMPLE JUST UM CHANGING TO THE NEXT CHANNEL TO TO FLIP THROUGH ALL ALL OF THE POSSIBLE CHANNELS 
OR THEN MM UH THE OTHER POSSIBILITY WOULD BE THAT UM SHE MIGHT JUST WANT TO CHOOSE ONE PARTICULAR CHANNEL SO WE WOULD NEED THE NUMBERS 
AND AND ALSO THE VOLUME IS VERY IMPORTANT 
UM UM I ALSO OKAY 
'KAY 
UM UM AMONG THE FINDINGS I FOUND THAT UM M MOST OF THE CURR MM PRESENTLY AVAILABLE REMOTE CONTROLS ALSO INCLUDE OTHER MM FUNCTIONALITIES UM ONE OTHER DESIGN 
LIKE OPERATING A V. C. R. BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH D. V. D. PLAYERS 
BUT THEN THERE ARE SURELY THERE ARE MANY OTHER FUNCTIONALI FUNCTIONS THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE ADDED TO THEM 
BUT ACCORDING TO THE LAST MINUTE UPDATE UM ACTUALLY UM WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ALL THESE COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS ADDED TO OUR DESIGN 
SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES WOULD BE UH TO KEEP THE MM THE WHOLE REMOTE CONTROL SMALL UM JUST LIKE THE PHYSICAL SIZE 
AND THEN IT MUST BE EASY TO USE 
SO IT MUST FOLLOW SOME CONVENTIONS UM LIKE WHEREABOUTS YOU FIND THE ON OFF BUTTON AND MAYBE THE COLOUR TENDS TO BE RED OR SOMETHING 
UM THEN YEAH 
THE MOST HAVE BUTTONS WOULD BE ON OFF AND THEN THE CHANNEL NUMBERS AND THEN UM THE ON THAT ALLOWS US TO GO TO THE NEXT OR THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL 
AND THEN VOLUME HAS TO BE THERE 
BUT THEN UM OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES UM COULD BE JUST UH THERE COULD BE A MENU BUTTON AND YOU COULD CHANGE THINGS IN THE SCREEN THEN 
UM FOR EXAMPLE BRIGHTNESS AND MM SIMILAR FUNCTIONS COULD BE JUST ME DONE THROUGH THE MENU 
AND YEAH THE LAST QUESTION I HAD ABOUT WHETHER WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE AN UH MORE FUNCTIONALITIES THE ANSWER WAS ALREADY IN BECAUSE OF THE LAST MINUTE UPDATE 
SO AT THE FOR THE TIME BEING THAT'S UH THAT'S ALL 
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS 
YEAH AND ALSO IT'S IT'S UM OTHER QUESTION IS UH BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT 
AND THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE INCLUDED BECAUSE BESIDES VIDEO AND D. V. D. THERE ARE THE MM UM VIDEO C. D. S AND WHATEVER 
SO IT MIGHT BE PROBLEMATIC TO TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ALL THESE POSSIBLE THINGS 
UM WELL I THINK THE BUTTONS ARE STILL MM KIND OF THE MOST UM EASY FOR THE USER TO USE 
I MEAN UM WHAT OTHER OPTIONS WOULD YOU HAVE 
A LITTLE SCREEN OR SOMETHING 
BUT THIS WOULD BE REALLY KIND OF I THINK A LOT OF LEARNING FOR THE USER AND AND I MEAN THE USER JUST WANTS TO GET UM GOT A RESULT UM QUICKLY 
NOT TO SPEND TIME IN LIKE UM GIVING SEVERAL ORDERS UM I DUNNO 
I THINK I TH I WOULD I WOULD THINK THE PUT THE BUTTONS BUT IF IF YOU HAVE THREE MM PROPOSALS UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
UH UM I GOING ON THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
NO 
WAIT 
OKAY HERE IT COMES 
OKAY HERE YOU ARE 
UM THAT'S VERY GOOD VERY INTERESTING 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU SHARE A TELEVISION OR SOMETHING THAT YEAH 
IT WAS SEVENTY SOMETHING YEAH YEAH 
YEAH THIS THIS IS NOT UNAFFORDABLE BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHETHER PEOPLE NEED TO WHETHER THEY DO HAVE A T. V. TO USE ITS FULL 
YEAH 
COMMON THE STUDENTS YEAH YEAH 
THE USE THE SITE YEAH AND THE REMOTE CONTROL MIGHT NOT YEAH IT MIGHT NOT EVEN FUNCTION WITH THE OLD T. V. 
YEAH WE'RE STILL YEAH 
ARE WE MAYBE WE CAN JUST KIND OF UH UH 
YEAH BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK MAYBE WE CAN WE CAN JUST DECIDE TO TO HAVE BOTH OF THESE GROUPS AS OUR TARGET 
BECAUSE ACTUALLY I MEAN THEY'RE ALL STILL RE YOUNG PEOPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT UH UM 
YEAH YEAH SURE YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WE WILL NOW THE V THE VOICE RECOGNITION IF IF IT WORKS WONDERFULLY W WE COULD POSSIBLY DO AWAY WITH ALL BUTTONS 
BUT I THINK THIS IS NOT REALLY THE RIGHT MOMENT YET 
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE JUST IS USED TO BUTTONS AND UM YEAH IT'S IT'S KIND OF SAFER SO WE WE NEED BOTH 
SO THE VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD BE JUST AN EXTRA IT WOULDN'T REALLY REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE REMOTE 
YEAH BUT UM BUT IN THE OTHER HAND 
REMOTE CONTROL ISN'T IS CLOSE TO YOU YOU PROBABLY MIGHT JUST JUST UH SPEAK INTO IT AND AND THE T. V. WOULD BE ALREADY FURTHER AWAY 
SO IT MIGHT NOT PICK UP THE OTHER THINGS COMING FROM THERE 
YEAH BUT THEN THE REMOTE CONTROL I THINK I MEAN UM THE IDEA IS KIND OF IT'S IT'S NOT THAT IT'S SITTING THERE ON ON TOP OF THE TELEVISION 
BECAUSE THEN YOU COULD ALREADY YELL AT THE TELEVISION AND YOU WOULDN'T YOU YOU WOULDN'T NEED THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL IS STILL SOMETHING YOU KEEP IN NEAR YOURSELF 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
NO BUT I I I WAS JUST DEFENDING THE THE FACT WHY WHY WE WANT TO KEEP THE REMOTE CONTROL CLOSE TO USE 
A AND UH NOT TO YELL AT IT FROM THE DISTANCE 
OKAY 
OH YEAH YEAH 
OKAY YEAH MM-HMM 
THE MAJOR ONES YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
DID YOU FIND OUT 
IT'S JUST YEAH YEAH 
UH SO SO WE'LL JUST PUT THEM I THERE WE W YEAH WE WE WON'T EVEN OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH SOMETHING CONCEPTUAL YEAH 
HMM 
SORRY ABOUT UM THE NEXT MEETING UM ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO UM RIGHT AFTER LUNCH OR SHALL WE PREPARE OR 
TO PREPARE OKAY YEAH THAT'S GOOD 
OKAY 
COOL 
OKAY SO YOU 
MM 
YOU SAID UH TARG TARGET GROUPS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
OH OKAY 'KAY 
SO ARE 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
I CAN GO FIRST YEAH 
RIGHT 
UM SO F FROM THE 
RIGHT SURE 
OH OKAY 
SO ON UH WITH UH WITH REGARD TO THE UH WORKING DESIGN OF THIS UH UH REMOTE CONTROL UH I'VE IDENTIFIED UM A FEW BASIC UH COMPONENTS OF THE REMOTE AND UH SO UH FROM THE DESIGN 
FUNCTIONAL DESIGN PERSPECTIVE UM W I C WE CAN NOW UH KNOW WHA WHAT EXACTLY THE COMPONENTS ARE AND HOW HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER WITH EACH OTHER 
SO 
THIS IS THE METHOD THAT UH I'LL MOSTLY BE FOLLOWING IN MY UM IN MY UH REAL 
UM THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE COMPONENTS UH AND UH SINCE SINCE I'M DEALING ONLY WITH THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS 
I WOULD NEED FEEDBACK FROM THE MARKETING PERSON UH AND UH FROM THE USER INTERFACE PERSON 
UH WE'LL THEN INTEGRATE THIS INTO THE PRODUCT DESIGN IT A TECHNICAL LEVEL AND UH BASICALLY UPDATE AND COME UP WITH A NEW DESIGN SO IT'S A CYCLICAL PROCESS 
OKAY SO THESE WERE THE BASIC FINDINGS FROM TODAY 
THE LAST THREE BULLETS HAVE BEEN INTEGRATED FROM UH THE LAST MINUTE UH EMAIL 
UH I JUST QUICKLY JOTTED THEM DOWN 
UM SO BASICALLY UH THE SO I TOLD YOU THE IDENTIFICATION OF HOW THE REMOTE CONTROL WORKS AND WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS PARTS TO IT 
UH AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES UM AND HOW THE PARTS UH COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER 
UM OKAY SO E THE MEE EMAIL SAID THAT TELETEXT IS NOW OUTDATED SO WE NEED TO DO AWAY WITH THAT FUNCTIONALITY OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM ALSO UH THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE USED ONLY FOR TELEVISION BECAUSE INCORPORATING OTHER FEATURES UM MAKES IT MORE COMP COMPLEX 
AND THE REASON WHY TELETEXT IS OUTDATED BECAUSE UH OF INTERNET AND UH THE AVAILABILITY OF INTERNET OVER TELEVISION 
HOW HOWEVER OUR OUR REMOTE CONTROL WOULD ONLY BE DEALING UH WITH THE THE S FOR TELEVISION IN ORDER TO KEEP THINGS SIMPLE 
UM ALSO THE MANAGEMENT WANTS THAT UM OUR DESIGN SHOULD BE UNIQUE UH TO USE IT SHOULD INCORPORATE UM COLOUR AND THE SLOGAN UH THAT OUR COMPANY UM HAS TO USE ITS STANDARD 
OKAY SO UH UH HERE IS A FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM THERE'S BASICALLY AN ENERGY SOURCE AT THE HEART UH WHICH FEEDS INTO THE CHIP AND THE USER INTERFACE 
THE USER INTERF INTERFACE COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHIP SO I'LL BASIC GO OVER TO THE 
OKAY 
SO IF UH OF THIS IS OUR ENERGY SOURCE AND THIS IS A CALL UH IT COMMUNICATES UH IT FEEDS ENERGY INTO THE 
NOT THE CHIP WHICH BASICALLY FINDS OUT HO HO HOW HOW TO DO EVERYTHING 
THERE IS A USER INTERFACE HERE 
SO WHE WHEN THE USER PRESSES A BUTTON IT FEEDS INTO THE CHIP AND THE CHIP THEN GENERATES A RESPONSE AND TAKES THE RESPONSE TO AN INFRARED TERMINAL 
UM WHICH THEN USE THE OUTPUT OF THE CHIP IS AN INFRARED BIT CODE 
WHICH IS THEN COMMUNICATED TO THE REMOTE SITE WHICH HE HAS AN INFRARED RECEIVER 
UM THE OTHER CAN BE UH A BULB HERE OR SOMETHING TO INDICATE WHETHER THE REMOTE IS ONE OR COMMUNICATING 
UM SO THESE ARE THE ESSENT SO A ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
WHATEVER NEW FUNCTIONS THAT WE NEED TO DO M MAKE THE CHIP MORE COMPLICATED UH AND BIGGER BASICALLY 
OKAY 
UM SO I IN MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES UM I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN KE KEEP THE DESIGN AS SIMPLE AND COLOUR AS POSSIBLE 
THIS WOULD UH HELP US UH AT UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY TO A FUTURE POINT OF TIME 
AND UH ALSO IF WE CAN INCORPORATE UH THE LATEST FEATURES IN OUR CHIP DESIGN 
SO THAT ARE UM UH REMOTE CONTROL DOES NOT BECOME OUTDATED SOON AND IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH MOT MOST UH TELEVISIONS 
THAT'S ABOUT IT 
SO ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW OR 
NO I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT WHAT EACH COMPONENT COSTS 
UM YEAH 
ANYTHING ELSE 
YEAH 
CERTAINLY YEAH 
SO SO THE YEAH WE DEFINITELY NEED TO OPERATE WITHIN OUR CONSTRAINTS 
BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY I I DO NOT HAVE ANY DATA IS UH I JUST IDENTIFIED THE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS FOR THAT 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 'KAY 
I IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME 
OH THERE IT IS YEAH 
IT'LL COME UP TO UM UH NO SIGNAL 
YEAH YEAH IT SAYS SOMETHING NEW ADJUSTING 
OKAY 
OH THAT'S STRANGE 
OKAY 
AND ONE MORE TIME 
MM 
SORRY COU COULD YOU GO BACK FOR A SECOND 
UH SWITCHING ON OFF CHANNEL UH VOLUME OKAY THAT'S GREAT 
SO ON THE U USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS UH UH UH WE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE BASIC BUTTONS THAT WE DO WANT 
UM BUT UM SO SO AT THIS STAGE 
UH HOW WE GO ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THIS BUTTON WE WILL NOT IDENTIFY OR I MEAN NO WE CAN COMPLETELY DO AWAY WITH BUTTONS AND UH HAVE SOME KIND OF A FANCY USER INTERFACE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT UH IS IS THERE ANY UH UH ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT 
RIGHT 
YEAH AND IT'LL MAKE THE COSTS YEAH 
RIGHT 
UH I THINK THE CO COSTS WILL ALSO PLAY A BIG ROLE WHEN WE COME TO KNOW ABOUT THEM 
AS WELL WE CAN PROBABLY WAIT UNTIL T WE HAVE MORE KNOWLEDGE ON THAT 
UH I IF THE OF THE COSTS ALLOW WE CAN HAVE LIKE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY AND UH WITH UM BECAUSE WE DO WANT SOMETHING FANCY AND FASHIONABLE AS WELL 
SO YEAH 
COOL 
TRY TO PRESS OH OKAY YEP 
MM 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
MM 
MM 
MM 
SOME KIND OF A RING SOME 
RIGHT 
HMM 
OKAY THAT'S GREAT THANKS 
MM 
I THINK ONE OF THE VERY INTERESTING THINGS THAT CAME UP ON UM UH KA KATE CAT CAT'S UH PRESENTATION WAS UM UH THIS THIS ISSUE OF UH UH LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION BEING MORE POPULAR WITH UH YOUNGER PEOPLE 
SO IF WE NEED TO HAVE A TARGET GROUP UM THEN UH I THINK SO FAR AS THE M MOTTO OF OUR COMPANY IS CONCERNED 
IF WE WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING SLEEK AND UH YOU KNOW 
GOOD LOOKING UH WE ARE BETTER OFF TARGETING A YOUNGER AUDIENCE THEN UM YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPARATIVELY ELDERLY 
UM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
BU BUT BUT THE SURVEY DID SAY THAT OF THINGS LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION ARE MORE POPULAR WITH THEM SO IF YOU WANT TO PUT IN SOMETHING STYLISH 
THEN UH THE IT'LL CERTAINLY BE MORE POPULAR WITH THIS I YOU WITH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE AS COMPARED TO OLDER PEOPLE YEAH 
RIGHT AND 
RIGHT 
MM 
RIGHT 
BUT UH STILL IF IF YOU CAN GO BACK TO THAT SLIDE AND UH HOW POPULAR WAS IT 
OH OH OKAY 
THAT'S ALRIGHT IF YOU CAN JUST LIKE IT UP ON YOUR COMPUTER WH UH UM PEOPLE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE 
UH HOW POPULAR WAS IS IT WAS STI STILL STILL QUITE POPULAR AMONGST THEM 
SO EVEN THEY ARE SEVENTY SIX PERCENT IS THAT HIGH AMOUNT 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
SO YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
BU BUT EVEN EVEN IN THE CASE OF TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE IT'S QUITE POPULAR RIGHT 
SO MM UH OR OR OR 
MM 
MM 
UM I WAS HAVING A A GENERAL OUTLOOK ON M M MOST LIKE SOPHISTICATED FEATURES 
BUT VOICE RECOGNITION ITSELF I'M NOT VERY SURE ABOUT 
BECAUSE ONE OF THE P UH THINGS THAT CAT POINTED OUT WAS UH UH HOW DO WE GO ABOUT IMPLEMENTING IT 
UH AND UH 
YEAH 
BUT HOW FREQUENTLY DO WE USE IT ANYWAY AND UM UH UH UH HOW GOOD IS IT YOU KNOW UH VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARES ARE STILL QUITE UH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
O 
RIGHT 
MM 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
OKAY SO IT SEEMS LIKE A FEASIBLE THING TO IMPLEMENT UH FOR FOR A LIMITED YEAH 
MM 
WHAT UH 
MM 
WHAT WH UH WHAT I WAS THINKING IS THAT THERE IS THIS UH SEPARATION BETWEEN WHAT THE CHANNELS ARE ON T. V. AND HOW THEY ARE NUMBERED ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IF WE CAN DO WITH AWAY WITH THAT OUR PRODUCT CAN BE REALLY POPULAR UH IN THE SENSE THAT UH A PERSON CAN SAY 
I WANT TO WATCH UH I. T. V. ONE INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT I WANT TO GO ONTO CHANNEL NUMBER FORTY FIVE 
YEAH SO IF UH IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED SOME KIND OF 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S 
RIGHT 
MM 
MM YEAH AND IT MIGHT BECOME VERY DIFFICULT FROM A DISTANCE FOR THE TELEVISION TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE OF THE NOISE FACTOR FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL BEING CL I MEAN IT'LL IT'LL MM 
YEAH 
MM 
SO UH WH ANOTHER THING UH THAT CAN BE USED IS THAT UH THERE CAN BE A BEEPER BUTTON ON THE T. V. 
SO YOU CAN GO AND PRESS THAT BUTTON AND UM AND THE REMOTE CONTROL 
WHEREVER IT IS IT'LL BEEP SO WE WE CAN PROBABLY COME TO KNOW WHERE IT IS 
RIGHT YEAH YEAH YEAH 
ALRIGHT YEAH 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
SO WHERE EXACTLY SO THIS I 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH IN THAT ONE RIGHT YEAH 
NO 
RIGHT 
I GUESS I'LL FIND OUT 
WHA WHAT WAS IT AGAIN THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK INTO 
CON COMPONENTS UH 
EXCELLENT 
SO UM I SENT YOU THE AGENDA IT WAS IN THE ON THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT A CHANCE TO JUST HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
ANYWAY IT'S THE MEETING'S GONNA FOLLOW MORE OR LESS THE SAME STRUCTURE AS LAST TIME 
SO WE'LL GO ROUND EACH OF YOU IN TURN AND YOU CAN GIVE YOUR PRESENTATIONS ON WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO 
UM AND AT THE END OF THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS WHAT YOU'VE COME UP WITH IS THAT WE CAN MAKE A DECISION ON THE KEY REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS 
SO THAT'S WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE COMPONENTS' PROPERTIES MATERIALS THE USER INTERFACE AND ANY TRENDS THAT THE MARKETING EXPERT HAS BEEN WATCHING 
OKAY 
UM DO YOU WANNA START AGAIN 
LET ME WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES 
YOU HAVEN'T MADE A POWERPOINT OKAY 
MM-HMM 
LET'S HOPE THE PEN HOLDS OUT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
AND CHARGING THEIR REMOTE YEAH 
OH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
FOR A REMOTE 'CAUSE YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
WOOD WOOD 
A FLUFFY REMOTE 
HUH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
EXCELLENT 
DO YOU WANNA STAY SOMEWHERE NEAR THE BOARD SO THAT IF WE NEED TO YOU CAN SIT DOWN BUT JUST WE MIGHT NEED YOU TO LEAP UP 
WHAT ARE YOU POWERPOINT OR 
OKAY 
DO YOU THINK THESE PENS CAN GIVE YOU CANCER OF THE HAND 
SOME SORT OF RADIATION 
YEAH 
RIGHT INTERFACE CONCEPT 
THAT'S FINE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
IT'S YEAH 
YEAH 
UH-HUH OH YEAH 
IT'S LIKE THE LIKE YOU SAID IN 
THE SCROLL SCROLL WHEEL 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
EXCELLENT 
OKAY STRAIGHT TO TRENDS AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS IT ALL AT ONCE 
THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS 
EXCELLENT 
IF YOU TWO COULD BOTH DO THAT AS WELL IN CASE WE NEED TO REFER TO IT 
HERE IT COMES 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH SURE 
YEAH 
THAT'S OVER IN THE INTERFACE IF IF YOU COULD PUT 
YEAH 
AND MAYBE THE L. C. D. AND SPINNING SO THAT MEANS WE NEED AN ADVANCED THING 
MM-HMM 
MM 
IT IT IS ALSO QUITE NICE THOUGH IT TO HAVE SOMETHING HERE SO YOU DON'T INTERRUPT THE PICTURE IN THE SCREEN IS IF YOU'RE WATCHING SOMETHING 
YEAH 
RATHER THAN HAVING TO INTERRUPT YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE 
MM 
YEAH 
AND THEN YOU CAN FLIP IT OPEN 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH AND POSSIBLY EVEN UNEVEN LIKE NOT NOT SYMMET YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SOMETHING A BIT SQUISHY AND 
YEAH AND IT'D HELP IF YOU DROP IT IT PROTECTS IT AS WELL 
AT SOME DEGREE 
UH-HUH 
OR IF WE WANT TO USE THE THE LATEX THEN WE HAVE TO GO WITH ONE OF THE OTHER UM POWER THINGS 
FROM FROM BOUNCING IT 
YOU CAN HAVE TO USE LIKE A LITTLE BALL TO BOUNCE THAT FLIPS OPEN 
MM YEAH 
UH-HUH 
MM 
YEAH 'CAUSE THE 
YEAH 
DUNNO 
NOTHING TO OPEN THEM 
ANYTHING ELSE 
WHAT'VE WE GOT 
OKAY SO 
LOOKING AT WHAT WE'VE GOT WE WE WANT AN L. C. D. DISPLAY WITH A SPINNING WHEEL 
YEAH RUB OFF SOME OF THIS 
YEAH IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT STREAMLINED AND SEXY HAVING A HAVING A WIND UP 
I THINK THE 
DEPENDS HOW MUCH HOW MUCH MOVEMENT IT REALLY NEEDS 
PR PRESUMABLY IF THEY'RE SUGGESTING IT THEN WE COULD USE IT 
I'D I'D KEEP IT IN 
WE DON'T WANT THAT IT'S NO IT'S NOT NOT VEGETABLE 
MM 
MM 
YEAH AND GIVEN THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE SPONGY MATERIAL PREFERENCES I UH WOULD THINK MAYBE RUBBER OR PLASTIC IS MORE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
JUST FOR FAST 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND IT YEAH L. L. C. D. 
DO WE NEED THEM IN AS BUTTONS OR DO WE NEED THEM AS L. C. D. 
BUTTONS 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA DO NEXT SO IF WE PUT DOWN THE KEY UM THINGS THAT WE WANT 
JUST SPINNING AND NOT SCROLLING I WOULD SAY 
YEAH 
HMM 
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A IF IF YOU'VE GOT A FLIPPED THING 
EFFECTIVELY IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CURVED IN ONE SIDE AND FLAT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT YOU FOLDED IT IN HALF 
TH THAT WOULD BE IN ONE SIDE UH-HUH 
NO I THINK IT'S JUST THE CASING RUBBER ON THE OUTSIDE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FEATURE 
MM-HMM 
I GUESS 
BANANAS 
MM-HMM 
GREEN 
YEAH 
WE NEED THE ADVANCED YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
THAT WAS THE 
WE CAN'T HAVE SOLAR PANELS WITH RUBBER IS 
SHALL WE GO FOR IF WE'RE GOING FOR RUBBER WE THINK UH ONE IS OUR CASE AND THEN 
YEAH 
WE'VE GOT FIVE MORE MINUTES 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I THINK IF WE CAN IF WE CAN INCLUDE THEM TO NOT TOO MUCH EXTRA COST THEN I'D PUT THEM IN BUT IF IT'S 
YEAH 
IT'S FROM THE COMPANY IS 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND THE CASE IS CURVED IN ONE SIDE BUT THEN FLAT FLAT SO IT'S FLIPPED INTO EACH OTHER 
CAN I PULL THE THING AT THE BACK OF YOUR COMPUTER 
JUST SO WE CAN 
NOTHING IT'S RIGHT I'M JUST 
THERE WE GO 
UH UH NOW I'VE GONE TOO FAR 
YEAH 
WE'RE IN OUR WAY 
OKAY 
SO WE'VE BASICALLY WORKED OUT THAT WE'RE GOING WITH A SIMPLE BATTERY 
THE ADVANCED CHIP AND A CURVED IN ONE SIDE CASE WHICH IS FOLDED IN IN ITSELF UM MADE OUT OF RUBBER AND 
THE BUTTONS ARE ALSO RUBBER 
WE'RE HAVING PUSH BUTTONS ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEN ON THE INSIDE AN L. C. D. WITH SPINNING WHEEL AND WE'RE INCORPORATING VOICE RECOGNITION 
THAT'S OUR OVERALL CONCEPT AND IT'S GONNA LOOK SORT OF VEGETABLE AND BE IN BRIGHT VEGETABLE COLOURS 
I THINK IT'S IN THE 
MM MM 
YEAH 
IN THE 
MM-HMM 
IN THE CENTRE YEAH SURE 
OKAY SO NOW WE'VE GOT THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE OUR NEXT MEETING 
IN THE MEANTIME THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER OVER HERE IS GONNA WORK ON THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN WHICH I'LL PRESUME HE'LL WORK OUT WHAT THAT MEANS 
UM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER WILL WORK ON THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND THE MARKETING EXPERT IS GOING TO WORK ON PRODUCT EVALUATION 
AND AS WELL SO THAT 
THE TWO DESIGNERS ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON OUR PROTOTYPE FOLLOWING THOSE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WE'VE JUST CAME UP WITH USING MODELLING CLAY AND YOU WILL GET EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR PERSONAL COACH 
SO THAT ALL OKAY 
AND ANYONE WHO HASN'T PUT THEIR THEIR PRESENTATION ON THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER IT WOULD BE GOOD JUST AS IN CASE WE HAVE TO REFER TO IT 
YOU UH NOBODY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU 
UNPLUG YOURSELF 
I DUNNO MAYBE I WOULD CAR 
DOES THAT MEAN LIKE A WIND UP ON 
A WIND UP REMOTE 
YOU COULD MAKE THE HAND DYNAMO INTO AN EXERCISE BIKE AND THEN PEOPLE COULD EXERCISE WHILST WATCHING T. V. 
YEAH AND STOP WORRYING ABOUT THE WHOLE R. S. I. FROM THE REMOTE THING 'CAUSE THAT'S JUST 
YAY 
DID YOU SAY WOOL 
WOOD 
OH RIGHT 
YEAH YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY WHEN WE GET TO MY PRESENTA 
SONY 
SONY ERICSSON MOBILE PHONES HAS TO 
MM 
NO IT'S GOT ITS LITTLE CAMERA ON THERE PLUG IT IN 
'S A 
UGLY 
YEAH YOU CAN'T 
UH IT'S LIKE THE IPOD 
G YEAH NO YOU CAN 
IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE WHERE YOU YOU KNOW HOW YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR MOUSE 
AND YOU YOU GO ROUND AND I IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT AND YOU SPIN ROUND AND IT YEAH 
IT IS 
YOU JUST GO ROUND AND IT IS A BIT WEIRD AT FIRST BUT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY LIKE FAST 
I LIKE THE THE WHEELS THAT CLICK ON THE SIDE YOU YOU GET 'EM MUCH SLOWER SO IT'S QUITE GOOD IF YOU LIKE SEARCHING QUITE A LOT OF STUFF 
DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE LOOKIN IF YOU'RE THE SCROLLING THROUGH THE A. TO Z. OF YOUR MUSIC AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO T. 
THEN IT'S A LOT FASTER THAN THE WHOLE BUT YOU'VE GOT A LOT LESS CONTROL OVER IT 
OKAY I'VE PUT THE COPY OF THE PRESENTATION ON UM THE YEAH 
COOL 
FABULOUS 
OKAY COOL 
UM SO WHAT I DID WAS TO SEARCH THE INTERNET TO COME UP WITH MARKET TRENDS AND YOU KNOW WHAT USERS ARE GONNA BE WANTING ON THE THE NEAR FUTURE 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
NOW THE FIRST ASPECT IS APPARENTLY TWICE AS IMPORTANT IS THE SECOND ASPECT WHICH IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT IS THE THIRD A ASPECT 
SO I MEAN THE THE EASY TO USE THING IS FAIRLY LOW DOWN ON THE WHICH I THINK GIVEN THE TARGET GROUP IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT REALLY 
UM YOU KNOW PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING NEW SOMETHING TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENT 
SO THE WHOLE IDEA WITH THE L. C. D. S AND THE SPINNING AND THE COLOURS AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS QUITE LIKE QUITE THE THING TO GO FOR 
AND UM YEAH IT WANTS TO LOOK FANCY FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
MM 
DEPENDS HOW FAST YOUR TELEVISION RUNS REALLY DON'T DON'T YOU THINK 
I MEAN WE'VE GOT ONE OF THIS UM TELEWEST BOXES AND YOU PUT THE NUMBER IN THE REMOTE AND THEN YOU WAIT AND THEN IT GOES TO THE T. V. AND THEN YOU WAIT 
AND THEN IT COMES SO I IT ACTUALLY TAKES QUITE A LONG TIME 
AND IF YOU GET THE NUMBER IN WRONG THEN IT'S A BIT OF A PAIN SO I THINK 
YOU KNOW A SCREEN ON THE REMOTE WOULD PROBABLY CUT DOWN YOUR TIME ON THAT 
BUT LIKE REMOTES DO TEND TO GET F THROWN ABOUT A BIT 
YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
AND I IT WOULD BE LIKE I MEAN IF YOU COULD MAKE IT INTEGRATE WITH THE T. V. THEN IT COULD COME UP WITH NEW INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S ON 
AND YOU COULD JUST SO THAT IN THE REMOTE RATHER THAN 
YEAH 
BUT UM I THINK MAYBE A WAY TO DO IT WOULD BE A SIMILAR WAY TO HOW YOU HAVE YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU KNOW 
LIKE YOU HAVE THE SLIDEY ONES AND YOU HAVE THE FLIPPY ONES AND THEN THE SCREEN'S PROTECTED SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET SCRATCHED 
SO YOU CAN HAVE LIKE WHAT LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL YOU KNOW OR LIKE A MINIMALIST REMOTE CONTROL 
SO YOU GET YOUR BUTTONS ON TO NINE YOUR ON AND OFF AND YOUR VOLUME ON THAT AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO MESS ABOUT WITH IT 
YOU FLIP IT OPEN AND YEAH 
YEAH SO THAT KIND OF DECIDES YOUR WHOLE CHEAP THING 
OKAY 
COOL 
OKAY APPARENTLY FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WILL BE PROVIDING INSPIRATION 
SORRY I DISCOVERED CLIP ART 
UM SO THIS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FEATURE FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE 
SO I MEAN I'M TAKING THIS IT MEAN YOU KNOW CURVINESS 
DO YOU KNOW 
'CAUSE YOU DON'T TEND TO GET FLAT VEGETABLES 
YOU KNOW 
YEAH BUT OF ASYMMETRY AND STUFF 
BUT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO TO GET IN THE WHOLE UM R. S. I. ISSUE IN THERE 
BECAUSE I MEAN IF YOU THINK MOST PEOPLE USE THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH THEIR RIGHT HAND UH RIGHT HANDS SO YOU WANNA YOU CURVE IT IS THAT IT'S SUITABLE FOR US WITH THE RIGHT HAND 
UM YEAH I'M NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF MATERIAL WILL BE SPONGY 
UM 
YEAH BUT I MEAN YOU YOU HAVE TO 
WELL I SUPPOSE YOU WOULDN'T GET A REMOTE UH AN ELECTRIC SHOCK OFF YOUR REMOTE CONTROL IF IT WAS MADE OF RUBBER 
YEAH YEAH 
IF IT'S MADE OF RUBBER YOU COULD GET THE KINETIC ENERGY FAIRLY EASILY THERE YOU COULD JUST BOUNCE IT UP AND DOWN 
YEAH 
UM SO YEAH UM OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF FLATNESS I THINK 
IT IT DEPENDS ON THE WHOLE ERGONOMICS OF IT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE HOW YOU PUT YOUR HANDS SO YOU IT'S THE LEAST MOVEMENT BASICALLY 
NO I D I DON'T THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE 
I I HAVE ONE OF THIS IS SLIDEY PHONES AND I MEAN THE BACK IS ESSENTIALLY STRAIGHT BUT IT'S CURVY SO 
BESIDES YOU HAVE FOUR SIDES TO A THING SO I MEAN DOES CURVED ONE SIDE MEAN ONE SIDE AS STRAIGHT AND 
YOU KNOW CURVED TWO SIDES MEANS THE WHOLE THING IS JUST A BIG CURVY P THING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH IT'S IT'S MORE ABOUT THE PROTECTING THE L. C. D. WHICH I THINK SO WHERE IT CAME FROM 
BUT IN MY RESEARCH DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE ALL THE PICTURES 'CAUSE I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO WITH MY TIME 
OKAY COOL 
UH COMBINE STYLE WITH A LEVEL OF FUNCTIONALITY UM BEAUTY AND PRACTICALITY AND A THING OF BEAUTY AND P FUNCTION 
OKAY 
IT'S ABOUT THE PRACTICALITY OF IT REALLY ISN'T IT 
YOU KNOW 
I MEAN IF 
I CAN'T IMAGINE A M WOODEN REMOTE CONTROL 
WELL IT'S NOT VERY CLEANABLE EITHER DO YOU KNOW 
IT'S IT'S NOT A PRACTICAL I MEAN IT'S IT'S ALRIGHT FOR A TABLE BUT FOR A REMOTE CONTROL YOU KNOW 
AND SPLINTERS AND STUFF AND 
IT JUST UM DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE I THINK SO THE THING WITH WOOD 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME PUSH BUTTONS DON'T YOU 
G YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK THIS IS GOING BACK TO THE THE GRAPH AT THE BEGINNING THAT I MADE WHERE YOU KNOW THE BUTTONS THAT PEOPLE USE ALL THE TIME 
YOU WANT BUTTONS FOR THEM AND EVERYTHING ELSE MENU DRIVEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
G YEAH I WOULD THINK BUTTONS YEAH 
IT'S IT'S TH I THINK THE THING IS SO IF SOMEONE JUST WANTS TO TURN ON THEIR T. V. AND PUT IN A CHANNEL 
THEN IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE THAN ANY OTHER REMOTE AND THEN IF SOMEONE WANTS TO YOU KNOW 
CHANGE THE CONTRAST ON THEIR T. V. AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND IT SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE BUT YOU KNOW 
I MEAN MOST OF THE TIME I MEAN THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH THE BIGGEST TECHNO GEEK CAN SPEND FIDDLING WITH THE T. V. 
I THINK SO THE THE THE ISSUE THERE 
E THERE ARE 
G YEAH 
I WOULD SAY THE USE THE USE THE SPINNING GOES TO A HIGH SPEED TO THE AT THE SCROLLING WHEEL 
SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO BE GOING AS FAST OR NOT 
BUT I MEAN THE THE THING WITH THIS WHOLE IF YOU YOU'RE PLANNING ON MAKING IT OUT OF RUBBER 
IN THE BASIS THAT IT'S SPONGY THEN I'M NOT SURE HOW WELL A SCROLLING WHEEL WOULD WORK 
YEAH BUT Y YOUR SPINNING WHEEL TENDS TO GO TO ONE SIDE 
YOU WANT AN OUTSIDE OF RUBBER AND THEN OPEN IT UP AND 
OR MAYBE LIKE INTERCHANGEABLE CASES 
'CAUSE I KNOW LIKE WE'RE GOING BACK TO IPODS AGAIN IN THE WHOLE SPINNING WHEEL 
BUT I HAVE LIKE A YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY MY IPOD'S NOT MADE OF RUBBER 
BUT THEN I HAVE A LITTLE RUBBER CASE THAT GOES OVER THE TOP OF IT AND I CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR THEORETICALLY TO MATCH MY OUTFIT 
YEAH I THINK THE SPINNING WHEEL IS DEFINITELY EVERY NOW 
YEAH 
THAT DOESN'T FIT IN WITH THE WHOLE VEGETABLE THEME THOUGH 
YEAH 
BUT I MEAN DO YOU THINK WE COULD INCORPORATE THE COLOURS OF THE COMPANY INTO THE BUTTONS AND THEN MAKE THE COLOUR OF THE MAIN REMOTE THE COLOUR LIKE VEGETABLE COLOURS 
DO YOU KNOW 
SO YOU COULD HAVE LIKE I MEAN I SUPPOSE VEGETABLE COLOURS WOULD BE ORANGE AND GREEN AND SOME REDS AND UM MAYBE PURPLE AND THAT AND THEN YOU'D PICK THE BUTTONS ON COMPANY COLOURS TO TO MATCH WITH IT 
SO ARE WE DISCOUNTING SOLAR ENERGY BECAUSE RUBBER'S GONNA BE USED IN THERE SOMEWHERE OR 
IF SOLAR PANELS WITH THE RUBBER 
YEAH OKAY SO WE ALSO THAT I THINK 
YEAH 
IT'S JUST A GIMMICK 
YEAH SURE J 
SORRY DO YOU WANT ME TOO 
WHAT DOES UM U. C. S. MEAN 
OKAY COOL 
SO IT'S ADVANCED INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 
IMAGINE IT WOULD BE INSIDE 
SO UM ACTUALLY THAT COULD LOOK REALLY CUT DOWN YOUR THING SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR OUTSIDE WHICH IS LIKE MINIMALIST 
AND THEN YOU OPEN IT UP AND YOU'VE GOT A SCREEN AND A SPINNING WHEEL WHICH YOU CAN INCORPORATE BUTTONS NOT 
UM SO YOU'VE STILL NOT GOT LIKE A LOT OF STUFF ON THE 
YOU'VE MAYBE GET YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU'RE MODELLING AN IPOD YOU'VE GOT FIVE BUTTONS AND A WHILE 
AND FOUR OF THE BUTTONS ARE IN THE WHEEL AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE LITTLE BIT INSIDE THE WHOLE YEAH 
COOL I'M GONNA GO AND SIT ON MY OWN 
I KNOW I'M HATED 
I'VE GOT A BIT TANGLED UP IN ALL THIS 
SO WHAT WAS WHAT WAS THIS K KA 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
UM YOU MEAN THIS WOULD BE LIKE THE THE OVERALL SHAPE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL YEAH MM-HMM 
YEAH MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM I HAVE SOME POWERPOINT YEAH 
OH 
'KAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM TO BE HONEST ACTUALLY I MENTIONED SOME SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH WHICH COULD FIT IN THE ON THE THIS TALK UM THIS TIME 
I AM I MENTIONED THEM ALREADY ON THE PREVIOUS TALK 
SO UM YEAH THIS TIME UM I MIGHT NOT HAVE THEM IN THE SLIDES BUT I I CAN JUST MENTION THEM AW AGAIN 
OKAY 
SO UM I THOUGHT UM I WOULD ALSO INCLUDE THE DEFINITION OF USER INTERFACE UM SO IT'S THE ASPECTS OF A F F A COMPUTER SYSTEM OR PROGRAMME WHICH CAN BE SEEN UH BY THE USER UM AND AND WHICH UH THE MECHANISMS THAT THE USER USES TO CONTROL ITS OPERATION AND INPUT DATA 
SO THIS WOULD P INCLUDES THINGS LIKE SHAPE AND SIZE AND BUTTONS AND UM VOICE RECOGNITION AS WELL AND COLOUR AND SO NO 
UM UM THE METHOD I EMPLOYED THIS TIME WAS A AGAIN HAVING A LOOK AT RELATED PRODUCTS AND MAINLY ON THE INTERNET AND THEN UM ANALYSE THEM UH FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF USER FEN FRIENDLINESS AND ALSO UM WHETHER THEIR APPEARANCE WAS WAS PLEASANT 
UM AND THEN UM THIS UH THIS UM 
THIS CAN HELP US TO DECIDE WHICH FEATURES WE WANT TO INCORPORATE IN OUR PRODUCT 
SO SOME FINDINGS UM UM 
SO IN IN THE CASE OF MANY USER INTERFACES 
THEY'RE JUST IS FULL OF BUTTONS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY UH HARD TO FIND THE ONES YOU YOU REALLY UM WANT TO USE AND UM AND IT'S JUST CONFUSING 
IT TAKES YOU KNOW TIME TO LEARN 
UM OKAY AND I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST QUICKLY SHOW SOME OF THEM THAT I FOUND 
OKAY SOME OF THEM ARE HERE 
UM WELL THE PICTURE IS NOT VERY CLEAR BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE ACTU OI OH OH OH SORRY FOR THAT 
'S GO BACK 
OH NO PLEASE 
OKAY SO YEAH THEY'RE QUITE BIG AND HAVE MANY MANY BUTTONS 
ACTUALLY OF THE OF ALL THESE I PERSONALLY P PREFER THIS ONE 
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE SMALLEST AND AND WITH WITH LAST UH WITH THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF BUTTONS AS WELL 
AND I WOULD SAY EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF SOME OF THEM IS KIND OF NOT SO ONCE 
UM OKAY 
SO LET'S CARRY ON WITH THIS 
UM 
SO UH UM O OTHER FINDINGS UM SOME NEW THINGS UM USED UH SOME OF THEM WERE MENTIONED ALREADY BY OUR TECHNICAL UM DESIGNER UH 
OUR OWN COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED A NEW ONE USER INTERFACE UH WAIT ON THIS IS NOT THE ONE 
OKAY THERE IS A WE CAN UH INCLUDE VOICE RECOGNITION AND UM IT ALLOWS I IT'S POSSIBLE TO RECORD EIGHTY DIFFERENT VOICE SAMPLES ON IT 
UH SO UH THIS UH THIS ONE WAS ALREADY MENTIONED UH THE L. C. DISPLAY 
UM IS ANOTHER NEW DEVELOPMENT IS A SCROLL BUTTON WHICH WAS ALSO THE ALSO ALREADY MENTIONED 
AND UH OUR OWN MANUFACTURING DIVISION HA HAS UH DESIGNED A NEW UM 
UH PROGRAMMABLE SPEECH UH 
MM SORRY UH SPEAKER UNIT I GUESS IT'S IT SHOULD BE 
UM AND THIS MEANS THAT UM ONCE UH UH IT IT IT COMES TOGETHER WITH A VOICE RECOGNITION 
BUT IT'S NICE NICE THE MM UM GADGET UH RECOGNISES UH THE VOICE OF THE SPEAKER 
THERE CAN BE A UM PRE PROGRAMMED ANSWER FOR EXAMPLE 
YOU CAN PICK UP THE REMOTE CONTROL AND SAY SOMETHING TO TO LIKE HELLO AND IT SAYS SOME HELLO AND YOUR NAME OR WHATEVER 
SO I MEAN THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE N DEV NEW DEVELOPMENTS WHICH WE MIGHT CONSIDER IF WE WANTED TO INCLUDE 
NO NO THE SCROLL BUTTON IS A DIFFERENT THING 
I I HAVE A PICTURE IF YOU JUST A MOMENT I'LL I'LL SHOW YOU 
I WASN'T COMPLETELY SURE MYSELF BUT I THINK IT'S JUST LIKE UM IT'S IT'S A WHILE IT'S LOOK INTO SEPARATE BUTTONS 
LIKE THIS ONE HERE 
BUT I'M I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHETHER WHETHER YOU CAN REALLY TURN IT AROUND IT'S LIKE YOU PRESS THESE ARE THESE ARE 
UH-HUH 
MM 
OH 
OKAY AND THE PERSONAL PREFERENCES ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS AS AS LAST TIME 
IT IT HAS TO BE SMALL SIMPLE 
OKAY WE DECIDED TO INCLUDE VOICE RECOGNITION IS TO HAVE THE STANDARD UH MAJOR BUTTONS LIKE ONE 
OFF UM CH THE CHANNELS AND AND THEN UM VOLUME AND THEN THE REST WOULD BE A MENU ON THE SCREEN 
UM AND I I ALSO THOUGHT UH IF WE WANT TO KEEP IT SMALL AND NICE UM AND ACTUALLY I I QUITE LIKE THE IDEA OF A SCROLL A SCROLLING BUTTON 
I THOUGHT IT COULD BE FOR FOR VOICE LIKE I DUNNO IT MM LIKE IN A UM I LIKE IT USED TO BE ON WALKMANS OR SOMETHING 
THERE IS UH I THINK THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE COULDN'T SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO YEAH THAT'S UH THAT'S IT 
YEP YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO IT COULD BE LIKE A RUBBERY YEAH UH-HUH 
THANKS 
YEAH UH HUM YEAH 
YEAH IT'S YEAH 
NO WOOD IS I CAN'T ON HOW DO YOU UH I MEAN YOU CAN'T KEEP IT REALLY SMALL UH YOU CAN'T MAKE IT LIKE THEN AND 
THE WOOD THING 
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO YOU IN YOU NEED TO PUT ALL THE TECHNOLOGY IN 
SO I MEAN IF THE CASE YOU DID THE CASE AND IT IT BECOMES A BIT BULKY WI MM MM YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
U YEAH WOOD IS NOT REALLY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH IN THE CASE OF REMOTE CONTROL NOT REALLY 
YEAH BUT YOU UM I THINK FOR FOR THE CHANNEL NUMB UH CHANNEL NUMBERS YOU STILL NEED THEM WOULDN'T YOU 
YEAH SO FOR CHANNEL NUMBERS BUT 
BUT I TH YEAH BUT I THINK THE L. C. D. DISPLAY IS KIND OF YEAH 
IT'S FASTER WITH A UM YEAH AND WE IF WE DIS AND WHEN WE USE UM DISCUSSED THAT WE MIGHT LIKE THIS FLIPPING OPEN THING 
THEN I MEAN YOU YOU CAN USE IT IS A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL BUT IF YOU DO WANT TO USE L. C. D. 
THEN YOU FLIP IT OPEN BUT IT'S IT IT'S MORE TIME CONSUMING 
YEAH 
NO NO I MEAN MM WE WE DEFINITELY NEED THE THE NUMBERS BECAUSE IT'S UH OTHERWISE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO FLIP THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS 
UM 
YEAH I WOULD SAY BUTTONS BECAUSE IT'S YEAH 
I 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT NO I I'M NOT COMPLETELY UM COMPLETELY CLEAR UH I YEAH BUT THE SPINNING WHEEL 
SO I THINK IT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE BOTH LIKE A SCROLLING AND SPINNING THING 
IT'S UH YOU CAN AL INCLUDE EVERYTHING IN THE SPINNING IF YOU YEAH YEAH IN THAT CASE 
UH BUT I MEAN YOU CAN 
YEAH I AM I THINK SO IT I MEAN THE CASE WOULD BE YEAH THE CASE WOULD BE RUBBER AND THE THE BUTTONS 
RUBBER BUTTONS BUT THEN 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I THINK WE UM IT WAS A A REQUIREMENT THAT WE USE OUR UM THE THE COLOURS OF OUR COMPANY 
SO WOULD TO BE LIKE YELLOW GREY AND BLACK OR SOMETHING OR 
YEAH DOES 
YEAH 
BANANA'S YELLOW YEAH DEFINITELY 
MM-HMM 
AND THE BUTTONS AS WELL I THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT IT IT I THINK IT SHOULD BE QUITE CHEAP BECAUSE IT'S FROM OUR OWN COMPANY YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UM 
UH-HUH 
SO WE WE WOULD WITH HAVE THE SPINNING WHEEL INSIDE WITH THE L. C. D. OR WOULD TO BE IN THE TRUE 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
SO BUT SHALL I MOVE AWAY FIRST OR SHALL I STAY HERE WITH WE NEED TO 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
RIGHT SO SO I HAVEN'T MADE A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION YEAH I I THOUGHT I'LL SEE THE WHITEBOARD INSTEAD 
UM MM OKAY 
SO BASICALLY I'LL START OFF BY UH I THOUGHT I'LL SEE THE WHITEBOARD BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS THAT WE CAN START UM UH RUBBING OFF THE OPTIONS THAT WE DO NOT REQUIRE AND PUTTING IN THE OPTIONS THAT UH OUR UM OR HIGHLIGHTING OR UNDERLINING THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OKAY 
SO UH I'LL START AGAIN WITH A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO CONNECT THAT ANYWAY BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE INSIDES OF A REMOTE CONTROL AND UH THEN WE CAN PROBABLY UH DISCUSS THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS 
YEAH 
OKAY SO W WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS IS THIS IS THE OUTSIDE OF THE REMOTE RIGHT 
IF YOU OPEN IT YOU HAVE A CIRCUIT BOARD HERE RIGHT AND THIS IS THE CHIP THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT LAST TIME 
THIS BASICALLY SENDS INFORMATION TO A TR UH TRANSISTOR HERE WHICH THEN HE SENDS THE INFORMATION TO AN L. E. D. DEVICE HERE 
IF YOU FLIP THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD AND THIS IS THE THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT HERE UH EVERYTHING ELSE IS KIND OF 
OKAY SO IF YOU FLIP THE CIRCUIT BOARD THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
SO YOU USE FOR EXAMPLE A PARTICULAR BUTTON ATTACHES TO A PARTICULAR PLACE ON THE P. C. B. AND UH ON PRESSING THIS BUTTON I A CIRCUIT COMPLETES 
THE INFORMATION GOES TO THE CHIP WHICH IS SOMEWHERE HERE AND THE CHIP THAT TRA THEN TRANSLATES THE CODE INTO AN INFRA INFRARED RADIATION 
WHICH GOES GOES TO THROUGH THERE 
SO UH THE IMPORTANT POINT THAT I READ OVER THE WEBSITE WAS UH THAT THE CONFIGURATIONS OF THESE PRINTED CIRCUIT CIRCUIT BOARDS UH ARE QUITE CHEAP TO MAKE 
YOU CAN GE GET THEM PRINTED AS YOU WANT TO USE WE WE CAN HAVE A CONFIGURATION UM IRRESPECTIVE OF THE COST THE WAY WE WANT TO HAVE 
RIGHT 
SO THAT'S THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE SO THESE ARE THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE 
OKAY 
SO THE BATTERIES I'LL START WITH THE BATTERY RIGHT 
SO THEY CAN BE SIMPLE WHICH IS LIKE UH THE NORMAL BATTERIES IN UH OUR UH THE CELLS YEAH 
UH THESE THESE ARE THE KIND DIFFERENT KIND OF BATTERIES THAT THE COMPANY MAKES RIGHT 
SO 
AND DYNAMOS 
UM YEAH YEAH 
SO UH I DON'T KNOW IF EVEN IF YOU WANT TO CONSIDER THIS BUT THOSE ARE THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THE COMPANY MAKES 
SO TH THEY'LL THEY'LL SINCE UH THEY'LL COME INTERNALLY FROM THE COMPANY THEY'LL BE SO UH CHEAPER UH ALL THESE OPTIONS 
SO THE THIRD ONE IS UH THE KINETIC ENERGY ONES 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S A GOOD OPTION 
THE THE KINETIC ENERGY ONE IS UH THAT E UH UH THEY ARE USUALLY MODERN WATCHES SINCE OUR HAND KEEPS MOVING IT KEEPS THE WATCH TICKING 
BUT I DUNNO I IF IT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR A REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'LL JUST LIE THERE FOR A LONG WHILE SOMETIMES 
BUT AS SOON AS YOU PICK IT UP TO MOVIES AND THEN AGAIN TO UH RE RECHARGES OR SOMETHING 
AND THE FOURTH OPTION IS THE SOLAR CELLS WHICH ARE ALSO MADE BY THE COMPANY 
ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY 
OKAY UM SO I'LL LIST THINGS AND THEN WE CAN COME BACK AND DISCUSS WHAT WHAT WE THINK FROM UH EVERYBODY'S PERSPECTIVE 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT CASES THAT CAN BE PROVIDED 
THEY CAN BE BASICALLY THE SHAPE OF THE CASES THEY CAN BE FLAT THEY CAN BE CURVED WITH UH ONE SIDED 
CURVED AND ONE SIDE FLAT AND THEY CAN BE CURVED WITH ON BOTH THE SIDES 
THESE ARE THE OTHER OPTIONS RIGHT 
UM 
YEAH WOULD TO BE FLAT ON BOTH THE SIDES WOULD BE CURVED FROM ONE SIDE OR WHATEVER UH THERE WERE DIFFERENT KIND OF SUPPLEMENTS AVAILABLE 
UM LIKE IT CAN BE IN PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD OR TITANIUM RIGHT 
WO WO WOOD 
YEAH 
NOT WOOL 
OH REALLY 
OKAY 
UM THE S UH WE CAN USE EVEN UM A CERTAIN TITANIUM IS ALSO SAID UH IN THE COMPANY TO MAKE UH UH SOME SPACE DESIGN EQUIPMENT 
SO IT'S KIND OF UM UH IT'LL BE PROBABLY NICER TO USE BECAUSE IT RELATES TO THE OVERALL IMAGE OF THE COMPANY 
BUT UH IT CANNOT BE USED IN A DOUBLE CURVED SURFACE 
IF WE CHOOSE THIS WE CANNOT USE TITANIUM 
FOR FOR THESE TWO WE CAN USE TITANIUM WOOD RUBBER OR PLASTIC 
YEAH 
OH OKAY THE INTERFACE OPTIONS NOW 
SO 
WE CAN HAVE PUSH BUTTONS LIKE MOST REMOTES DO AND OUR COMPANY IS AN EXPERT ON MAKING PUSH BUTTONS 
OH 
UH WE CAN HAVE SCROLL WHEELS LIKE THE ONES ON UM UH MOUSE POINTERS UH UH 
YEAH YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO AND THEY HAVE THEY CAN EVEN HAVE AN AN INTEGRATED UH PUSH BUTTON INSIDE THE SCROLLING THING 
THE SCROLL PLUS PUSH 
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY DEVELOPED BY THE COMPANY UM IN THE LAST DECADE SO NOT TOO RECENT 
AND L. C. D. S WE CAN HAVE L. C. D. S 
SO THESE TWO ARE RECENT AND AND THIS IS Q QUITE OLD 
THE VARIOUS ELECTRONIC OPTIONS ARE UM 
UH SO TH THIS CONCERNS FIRS FIRST OF ALL THE THE CHIPS I I SHOWED YOU TO UH SO THERE'S THERE'S A CHIP BEHIND THIS ONE RIGHT 
THE P. C. B. IS UH INEXPENSIVE SO WE CAN PUT PUT IN UH WHATEVER WE WANT 
BUT THE VARIOUS INTEGRATED CIRCUIT OPTIONS ARE WE HAVE EITHER A SIMPLE ONE 
OR A REGULAR 
OR ADVANCED 
AND UH THE PRICE GOES UP 
SO WE GO DOWN OBVIOUSLY 
UM OKAY 
SO THE GOOD THING ABOUT UH WH WH WHY WHY WE WOULD WANT TO USE ADVANCED U WHY WE MIGHT WANT TO USE ADVANCED IS THAT L. C. D. S CAN ONLY COME WITH THE ADVANCED CHIP 
UM THE WE NEED REGULAR OR ADVANCED FOR UH SCROLL WHEELS 
RIGHT 
UM AND THE CHIP BASICALLY INCLUDES THE INFRA INFRARED SENDER 
YEAH 
UH BESIDES THIS IN ELECTR UNDER ELECTRONICS UH ALSO THE COMPANY HAS STARTED MAKING A SAMPLE SENDER 
WHICH IS DID NOT EXPLAINED WHAT I WHAT IT WAS BUT I'M GUESSING THAT UH SO THEY HAVE A SAMPLE SENDER AND A SAMPLE SPEAKER 
SO I'M GUESSING THAT UH THE SAMPLE SPEAKER IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE UM UH YOU KNOW 
AS SOON AS YOU PRESS A BUTTON TO TO MM UH GIVE GIVES YOU FEEDBACK IN FIVE OR WHATEVER 
YEAH NO 
UM AND UH I DUNNO WHETHER SAMPLE SENDER SENDER HAS TO DO SOMETHING WITH VOICE RECOGNITION OR NOT BUT ANYWAY 
SO THESE ARE THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE 
OKAY SO THA THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY NOW NOW UH I THINK THAT UH WE CAN INTEGRATE UM UH YOU KNOW 
UH THE USER INTERFACE UH AND UH THE MARKETING THINGS IN THAT KEEP UH TAKING OUT THINGS FROM THIS AND UH UNDERLINING THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT YEAH 
YEAH YEAH SURE 
SURE 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH IT SHOULD SHOULD DO IT 
YEAH 
THAT'S NICE ONE 
MM 
MM 
OH SORRY UH CAN YOU GO BACK FOR A SECOND 
UM UH ARE YOU SURE WHA WHAT THIS MEANS A SPINNING WHEEL WITH THE L. C. DISPLAY 
UH UH YEAH OR THE 
OH OKAY THE IPOD THING YEAH 
UH IT'S THE IPOD UH KIND OF UH 
ALRIGHT RIGHT 
OKAY OKAY 
SO INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN YOU JUST SPIN YEAH YEAH 
UH-HUH 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
SO MAYBE I SHOULD INCLUDE THAT HERE AS WELL L. C. D. S UM PLUS SPINNING 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO UM UH MAYBE UH SO YOU'RE DISCUSSING THINGS IS IT OKAY IF WE JUST UH KEEP HIGHLIGHTING THINGS HERE 
RIGHT 
SO MM UH IS IT YEAH SO PROBABLY VOICE RECOGNITION IS IS KIND OF IMPORTANT RIGHT 
UM AND ONE YEAH 
OKAY I I HAVE A POINT ABOUT L. C. D. I DUNNO IF IT IS THE RIGHT POINT TO TAKE IT UP 
WE UH L. C. D. S ARE BASICALLY FOR FEEDBACK RIGHT AT THE USER WHO'S PRESSING BUTTONS 
AND THE FEEDBACK CAN COME THROUGH TELEVISION ITSELF SO DO WE NEED AN L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE 
MM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
THAT'S TRUE YEAH THAT'S ALSO 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM RIGHT 
OKAY 
SO NOW WE SEEM TO HAVE A CONSENSUS THAT L. C. D. S ARE DEFINITELY THE WAY TO GO BECAUSE OF STYLE AND 
RIGHT 
YOU YOU AGREE 
MARK YEAH 
YEAH 
SO L. C. D. S YEAH DEFINITELY 
GO ON 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
MM 
YEAH WE WE HAVE WE HAVE RUBBER BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT I FORGOT TO DISCUSS WITH THE UM WITH USING 
SO IF IF WE USE UH LATEX CASES THEY WON'T ALLOW US TO USE SOLAR CELLS AS AN ENERGY SOURCE THAT IS THE CONSTRAINT 
SO UM WE COULD USE TITANIUM WOOD OR PLASTIC UH OUR UH 
YEAH W ENERGY SOURCE 
YEAH TAP IT IN THE DESK YEAH 
MM 
SO PROBABLY DOUBLE CURVED SURFACE IS THE WAY TO GO YEAH 
OR OR CURVED IT ON AND AND FLAT ON THE TOP BECAUSE I I'M NOT SURE IF IT IS FLAT ON BOTH BOTH THE SIDES 
THEN UH HOW MUCH EASY WOULD TO BE TO REACH FOR BUTTONS ETCETERA 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SINGE SINGLE SIDE CURVED OR DOUBLE SIDE CURVED DOES NOT EASY TOO MUCH DOES IT 
IT UH 
MM 
UH I THINK UH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
DO NOW ADD TO SAY ANYWHERE IN YOUR RESEARCH MATERIAL ABOUT THIS SLIDING STUFF UH BECAUSE UM ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE 
I THINK UH THE ONL ONLY OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE CASE IS ARE THESE THREE 
UH THE OTHER WE HAVE UH A FLAT SURFACED UH CASE OR A CURVED SURFACED CASE 
IT DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT UH WHETHER TECHNICALLY YOU KNOW THIS THIS STUFF IS AVAILABLE AT ALL 
RIGHT YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
COOL THANKS 
YEAH 
LET'S LET'S TRY TO R RUB OFF THINGS AND YEAH SO UM HAND DYNAMOS ARE DEFINITELY IT RIGHT 
YOU YOU GOT A WIND DYNAMO YEAH 
OKAY 
UM KINETIC ENERGY DOES SEEM TO HAVE SOME KIND OF UH UH PEOPLE BUT UH 
IT'S 
YEAH 
SO AGAINST A WATCH WHICH CONSTANTLY KEEPS MOVING THIS THIS THING WILL HAVE TO BE TAPPED EVERY TIME WHICH WHICH MIGHT BE VERY FRUSTRATING FOR THE USER 
KINETIC ENERGY IT NEEDS I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TECHNICAL INFORMATION ON THAT YEAH RIGHT 
OKAY LET'S KEEP IT OPTION UH KEEP AN OPTION YEAH 
UM THE FLAT CO COMPLETELY FLAT CASE IS DEFINITELY IT RIGHT 
IT HAS TO BE AT LEAST CURVED FROM ONE SIDE YEAH 
UM OKAY WE STILL HAVE ALL ALL THE OPTIONS 
WOOD DO YOU THINK WOOD WILL BE A GOOD IDEA 
MM 
RIGHT 
YEAH IF IF IT IS REALLY THEN IF IT IS REALLY THEN IT IT'S LIKELY TO BREAK IT'S IT'S MUCH MORE UH 
RIGHT 
THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY WOOD IS IT 
RIGHT 
OKAY NOW FOR THE REALLY INTERESTING STUFF THE INTERFACE 
RIGHT SO UH THE THE PUSH BUTTONS AS AS OUR EXPERTISE UH IN THE INDUSTRY 
BUT UH IT SEEMS TO BE OUT OF TREND YOU KNOW NOBODY SEEMS TO BE 
MM RIGHT 
UH IF IF WE HAVE L. C. D. DISPLAYS THAT OPENS UP A WHOLE WORLD YOU KNOW 
IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY THEN MM YOU CAN SELECT ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THE L. C. D. DISPLAY 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
MM RIGHT 
SO UH IN IN THE BUTTONS WE HAVE FOR THE CHANNELS ALSO WE HAVE OPTIONS 
DO YOU DO WE ENUMERATE EVERYTHING FROM ZERO TO NINE 
OR DO WE HAVE JUST UH CHANNEL PLUS CHANNEL MINUS JUST TO JUST TO SCROLL 
THE NUMBERS 
RIGHT 
OR IN THE L. C. D. WE CAN YOU KNOW 
OKAY 
SO MM 
ALRIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY SO BUTTONS DEFINITELY NO BUT UH SHALL WE UH TRY TO DRAW A PREC UM 
OH OKAY 
OKAY OKAY SO THE COMPONENTS 
RIGHT SO UH WHAT ABOUT THE THE SCROLLING UH 
MM UM 
I'M NOT SURE IT'LL BE A GOOD IDEA TO CONSTRUCT THE WHOLE THING OUT OF RUBBER 
UH I IT 
OR OR AT THE CORNERS EDGES JUST THE EDGES COVERED BY RUBBER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
EVERYTHING ELSE IN PLASTIC OR EVEN TITANIUM IF WE WANT TO USE IT 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT RIGHT 
RIGHT OKAY SO SO THAT GIVES US A MORE TRENDY LOOK AS WELL 
UM 
RIGHT 
YEAH AND UH WE'RE GOING MORE FOR THE TRENDS THAN FOR THE USABILITY ANYWAY RIGHT 
SO 
I'LL RUB THAT IT 
AND UH COLOURS CAN BE PROVIDED WITH THE CASE RATHER THAN 
UM BUT WE STILL NEED TO TO THINK ABOUT THE COLOUR OF OUR REMOTE AS SUCH YOU KNOW JUST KEEP IT BLACK OR 
MM 
OKAY 
UM OKAY IF YOU GO GO OVER TO UH THE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 
UH SINCE WE'RE HAVING L. C. D. IS THERE THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE'RE WILL BE ABLE TO UM WHAT WE DO NEED TO CONSIDER 
HOWEVER IS THAT THE PRICE IS GOING UP FOR THE EVER EVERY SUCH THING THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING 
BUT SINCE L. C. D. S SEEMS TO BE UH A DEFINITE YES SO IT SEEMS TO BE AN AREA WHERE WE WOULD WANT TO SPEND 
SO I'LL RUB OFF THE OTHER TWO 
UH SO UH THE CONSTRAINT WAS UH YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
I THINK UH WE'LL HAVE UH UH USING THE SIMPLE BATTERY WILL BE A SAFER OPTION AS COMPARED TO THE KINETIC ENERGY ONE 
I MEAN A ALTHOUGH IT DOES SOME UH INTERESTING 
BUT IT DOES NOT HOLD ANY ADVANTAGES AS SUCH FOR A YEAH 
OKAY 
OH OKAY SO ARE WE UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER NOW THAT UH THE THE SPEAKER IS FOR THE FEEDBACK RIGHT 
IT IT SAYS UH THE THINGS THAT YOU TYPE ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS 
Y YEAH WE WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT IT UM 
YEAH OKAY SO SO TH THIS IS ONE AS WELL THEN THE SAMPLE SPEAKER 
RIGHT 
FLAT ON THE TOP 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I. C. S 
UH INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 
YEAH 
UH UM WE WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING ON FOR VOICE RECOGNITION AS WELL AS L. C. D. S MM 
RIGHT 
YEP 
MM 
MM-HMM 
COOL 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
THIS IS OUR FINAL MEETING THE DETAILED DESIGN MEETING 
AND AGAIN I'LL TAKE MINUTES 
THE WHAT WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH IN THIS MEETING IS FIRSTLY THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION FROM YOU TWO 
SO YOU CAN SHOW US WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON SO DILIGENTLY 
UM THEN 
THEN CAT'S GOING TO PRESENT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE EVALUATING THIS AGAINST 
THEN I NEED TO SAY SAME SET A FEW THINGS ABOUT FINANCE 'CAUSE WE HAVE TO CHECK THAT IT'S WITHIN THE FINANCE CRITERIA 
UM AND THEN WE'LL BE MAKING SURE THAT OUR PRODUCT FITS BOTH THE EVALUATION CRITERIA FROM CAT AND THE FINANCIAL LIMITS 
UM AND THEN WE UH WILL HAVE A BRIEF EVALUATION OF THE WHOLE PROCESS OF PRODUCTION AND DESIGN THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH 
SO WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES 
SO 
'CAUSE WE MISSED OUT 
SO 
IT'S NOW I GUESS THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO START AT FIFTEEN THIRTY FIVE SO WE'VE GOT UNTIL FOUR 
FIFTEEN 
SO THAT RIGHT 
YEAH UNTIL ABOUT FOUR FIFTEEN 
SO YEAH 
GO FOR IT 
DO YOU WANT 
YES 
DUAL USE PERFECT 
DUAL USE PERFECT 
DOES IT VIBRATE WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS 
SORRY SORRY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WOW 
AND IT'S THE WHOLE THING'S MADE OF RUBBER IS THAT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
HUH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE 
I LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YOU ARE YOU COULD HAVE TO SEE YOU IN THE WHOLE IF YOU 
BUT IF YOU HOLD IT IN IF IT'S A SCROLL AND CLICK SO YOU HOLD IT IN 
NO 
MM-HMM VERY GOOD 
AND IT'S WITH THE THE BLACK AND YELLOW YOU'RE EVEN IN THE RIGHT COLOURS 
MM-HMM 
VERY GOOD LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
TEST IT IT 
UH IT'S A SORT OF INTERMEDIATE COLOUR I GUESS 
VERY GOOD 
OKAY SO MAYBE IF WE GO ON IT EVALUATION CRI CRITERIA AND THEN WE'LL THERE I SUSPECT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A COUPLE OF MINOR FINANCE ISSUES 
BUT UM WE'LL SEE I'M SURE WE CAN GET AROUND THEM SOMEHOW 
WE'LL JUST SEND ALL OF OUR MANUFACTURING IT 
SOME NICE POOR COUNTRY AND 
CUT SOME OF THE PRICES THAT WAY 
WALES FOR EXAMPLE 
MARKETING EXPERT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO FOR EACH OF THIS WE NEED TO GIVE IT A ONE TO SEVEN 
SO THAT RIGHT 
MM DOTS NEVER MIND 
YEAH I AGREE 
YEAH JUST PREPARE ONE NOW 
I RECKON IT 
YEAH 
SEVEN YEAH IT'S TERRIBLY SEXY 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
EXCELLENT 
EXCEPT WE CAN'T UH WE CAN IF WE THEN YEAH I'LL TAKE A NOTE IT'S FINE 
YEAH 
I THINK IT DOES 
ALRIGHT 
BUT THAT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM 'CAUSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE ALL LEFT HANDERS OR ALL RIGHT HANDERS IN A FAMILY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UM 
SIX 
YEAH I THINK I THINK FOR UM I MEAN MOST PEOPLE ARE RIGHT HANDED SO IN IN TERMS OF OUR GREATEST TARGET GROUP 
I THINK IT'S PRETTY GOOD BUT WE MIGHT WANT TO FLAG IT FOR MANAGEMENT THEY WANT MIGHT WANT TO ME 
THEY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THE LENGTH IS GONNA BE DIFFICU 
MM 
NO WE'RE GONNA PUT IT LIKE WE'VE GOT THE THERE'S THE LOCATOR DOT 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'D SAY SIX 'CAUSE THE I MEAN THE THE STANDARD LAYOUT FOR NUMBERS IS THERE THERE THERE AND ONE RATHER THAN THE WAY YOU'VE GOT IT 
I REALLY LIKE THE WAY YOU HAVE TO BUT IT'S NOT THE IMMEDIATE THING THAT YOU'RE USED IT 
SO 
MIGHT BE 
BUT IT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL BE EXPERIENCING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES SOON 
FIVE 
YEAH 
I'M HAPPY WITH FIVE 
YEAH 
YEP 
BUT OTHERWISE IT'S SUPERB 
SIX 
YEAH 
WELL WE'VE BANNED THEM FROM 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S VARIED 
YEAH 
SIX 
VOICE CONTROL HAVE SEVEN 
OH THAT'S THE SECOND ONE 
SO YOU MUST HAVE CHANGED IT IN THIS ONE WHERE IT'S GOT SCORE BUT NOT IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE 
G. TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL TECHNOLOGY NONE OF IT IS ACTUALLY NOW 
YEAH 
ALL OF THE COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN USED IN OTHER THINGS BEFORE 
BUT D YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON FIVE SIX 
YEAH 
SPACE REMOTE 
PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
VERY GOOD 
YEAH NO 
OR A SEVEN 
FIFTY ONE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT 
SIX POINT POINT ABOUT SIX POINT FIVE 
CLOSE ENOUGH 
NOW WAIT UNTIL WE GET TO FINANCE AND THEN WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN AFFORD IT 
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT TO THE MOMENT OR DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING MORE 
THAT'S IT 
ALRIGHT 
SO FINANCE 
AND WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN 
UNSCREW THIS FIRST 
SORRY THIS IS I'M JUST UM 
BEAUTIFUL 
NOT ANYMORE 
COMPUTER NO SIGNAL 
ADJUSTING 
THERE WE GO 
OKAY SO WE'VE LOOKED AT THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION AND THE EVALUATION CRITERIA 
AND NOW WE HAVE TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCTION COSTS 
SO I'VE GOT AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET TO HELP US DO THAT 
CAN YOU READ THAT 
ALMOST 
MORE OR LESS 
UM I STARTED FILLING OUT IN BUT OF COURSE THESE ARE PROVISIONAL SO WE HAVE TO GO DOWN 
ONE HAND DYNAMO RIGHT 
NO SIMPLE BATTERY 
NO KINETIC ENERGY IN SOLAR 
THE CHIP WE'RE GOING FOR AN ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT 
WE ALSO SAID THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER 
UM SINGLE CURVED SURFACE IS THAT WE CAN FOLD IT 
CASE MATERIAL WE SAID RUBBER 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SPECIAL COLOUR MEANS 
IT COULD BE 
RUB RUBBER COMES COLOURED IT'S I WOULD MAYBE IT'S LIKE IF YOU WANT TITANIUM COLOURED OR WOOD COLOURED IT'S DIFFERENT 
YEAH LET'S LEAVE IT IS ZERO 'CAUSE IT'S EASY 
WE WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE TO SO WE'VE GOT PUSHBUTTON AND THEN WE'VE 
SCROLL WHEEL WITH PUSHBUTTON WE HAD NO 
SO FOR THE MEETING 
YEAH 
AND BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS 
NO 
NO 
BUT THE THE SPINNING WHEEL'S NOT THERE 
I HAVE THINK MAYBE IT'S INTEGRATED WITH THE L. C. DISPLAY 
I THINK THE PUSHBUTTON OH 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ONE 
YEAH 
THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY 
PUSH WHAT UH WHETHER WHETHER PUSHBUTTON MEANS THAT P COUNT BY BUTTON OR DO WE I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES SENSE 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO SO WE CAN SEE THAT'S WAY TOO EXPENSIVE DOWN HERE 
OUR BUDGET'S TWELVE POINT FIVE 
YEAH SO THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS THOUGH FOR THE 
FOR THE LOCATOR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT ELSE DOES IT AND 
YEAH 'CAUSE THE SAMPLE SPEAKER WAS I THINK MORE COMPLICATED THAN JUST A BEEPING THING 
YEAH OKAY SO WE 
UH-HUH 
RIGHT SO WE NEED ONE FIFTY OFF 
TAKE IT DOWN TO JUST A SCROLL WHEEL 
WE COULD DO 
YEAH 
YOU CAN HAVE TO SCROLL IT STRAIGHT R ROLL IT STRAIGHT DOWN FOR FOR MUTE 
THAT'S WITH THE L. C. 
WE DECIDED 'CAUSE IT'S NOT IN OUR LAST 
THE SCROLL WHEEL IS IN THE SIDE 
WE'RE POINT THREE OVER TO THE MOMENT 
IT'S NOTHING NO 
YEAH I HAVE 
YEAH 
RATHER THAN HAVING THREE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO DO 
THERE WE GO 
UH LIKE WE'RE WAY UNDER BUDGET AND WE'LL MAKE HUGE PROFITS AND WE'LL ALL GET BONUSES 
OR OR THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF SPECIAL COLOUR 
SO THAT'S ALRIGHT 
WE WE'LL LEAVE IT TO THAT AND THEN I'LL TAKE I CAN SEND IT BACK TO MANAGEMENT AND SAY WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE ABOUT THE COLOUR 
IF THAT COSTS EXTRA THEN WE'VE STILL GOT SOME SPACE FOR IT YEAH 
EXCELLENT 
ALRIGHT 
SO DID WE ALSO UM IN OUR EVALUATION CRITERIA IS A RESULT OF DOING THAT 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT THEN 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BEEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE 
'CAUSE WE WE WON'T HAVE RUN OUT OF OUR POT OF PLAY DOH 
YEAH I KNOW I KNOW MY PEN VIBRATES 
BUT ONLY FOR A VERY SHORT TIME 
UM 
OKAY 
SO 
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE DESIGNED A 
BANANA 
WELL DONE TEAM 
UM WE NEED WE'VE JUST GOT ABOUT TEN MINUTES OR IS LEFT OF THE MEETING 
SO IT WOULD BE GOOD IF WE COULD JUST HAVE A LITTLE TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT ITSELF AND HOW TO WANT 
UM SO THAT WE CAN FEED BACK TO THE MANAGEMENT FOR NEXT TIME THEY'RE DESIGNING A PRODUCT 
FEEDBACK 
DOES 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS OF UM GOING AND WORKING INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN COMING BACK TO A MEETING THAT THAT WORKED IN TERMS OF 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BANANA 
MM-HMM THE WHITEBOARD DIGITAL PENS 
WE LIKE THE PENS 
YEAH YOU COULD TAKE IT TO LECTURES AND JUST WRITE STUFF DOWN AND HAVE TO PRINTED OUT WHEN YOU GET BACK TO THE OFFICE 
THEY GREAT 
DO YOU THINK THEY'D NOTICE IF ONE WANT 
OH OKAY 
YEP 
SHH 
YEP 
BUT THAT WORKED WELL HAVING HAVING A WHITEBOARD THAT WE COULD DRAW ON AS WELL AS HAVING THE POWERPOINT 
'CAUSE THE I FOUND THAT THE PROBLEM WITH POWERPOINT OFTEN IS THAT IT'S SO STATIC AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT ONCE YOU'RE IN THERE YEP 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THAT'S ALRIGHT THAT ALWAYS IRRITATES ME ANYWAY YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND PRESUMABLY YOU DON'T YOU CAN SAY NASTY THINGS AS WELL 
I HAVE NO STAKE IN IT 
YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT 'CAUSE I'M TAKING THE NOTES 
I'LL LEAVE THE ROOM AND YOU CAN HAVE ANOTHER GO 
BETTER THAN THAT THEN THE BANANA 
I THINK IT WORKED QUITE WELL 
DID ANYONE FEEL THAT THEY WERE GETTING SORT OF COVERED UP AND NOT BEING ABLE TO 
SAY THERE BUT 
YEAH 
NEW IDEAS FOUND 
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT ABOUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
BANANA REMOTE 
YEAH 
OR YOU CAN ALWAYS GO TO GOOGLE AND TYPE IN BANANA REMOTE CONTROL 
FLIP 
VIBRATE 
AND UH YEAH 
NOTHING THAT YOU REALLY WANT 
TRUE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO COSTS ARE WITHIN BUDGET WELL WITHIN BUDGET INCLUDING A LITTLE WHAT HAVE WE GOT 
ONE EURO LEFT OVER FOR BITS THAT WE DIDN'T FORESEE 
UM WE'VE EVALUATED 
THE PROJECT 
YOU'VE GOT THE SCORES 
CAN YOU PUT THAT IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FILE 
IT'S IN THERE ALREADY 
AND THE PROCESS WHEEL DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH 
WERE THERE ANY WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU FIND DIFFICULT OR ANYTHING 
THAT DIDN'T GO AS SMOOTHLY AS YOU'D HOPE 
YEAH 
OKAY THEN 
UM I THINK WE'RE STILL WELL WITHIN OUR 
TIME 
WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LEFT BUT IF WE'VE FINISHED THEN WE'VE FINISHED 
WE'RE JUST TOO TOO EFFICIENT AND YOU SHOULD NEVER DRAG A MEETING IN JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE EXTRA TIME 
SO I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE END OF THAT MEETING 
THANK YOU TIM 
IT WAS VERY PRODUCTIVE DAY AND 
MM UH NO 
RIGHT SO WE HAVE TO COMPLETE THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY WHEN THEY SEND IT 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ALREADY SENT OR NOT 
UM PRESUMABLY I HAVE TO 
I DON'T SEE WHY YOU CAN'T STAY HERE REALLY 
DID I SAVE THIS ONE 
PRODUCTION COSTS 
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PINK 
BUT IT WAS BLUE ON THE BOARD 
IT DOES LOOK VERY COOL 
AND THEN DO WE GET TO MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU THINK BANANAS ARE A SAFE THING TO USE 
IT'S A BIT UM PHALLIC 
UH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
OH THAT'S JUST BAD 
SO IT TO SCALE OR DO YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE IT A BIT SMALLER 
YEAH 
IT L DOES LOOK LIKE THE CURVY AND THEN THE WHOLE SHAPE'S CURVY SO I WOULD SAY THAT THIS CURVY DOES LOOK QUITE LIKE A VEGETABLE 
I WASN'T VERY KEEN ON THAT BUT YEAH 
SO WHERE'S THE VOLUME 
UH YOU DID GET THAT ONE THEN MM-HMM 
OH OKAY 
COOL 
UH THE THING WE FORGOT WAS LIKE A MUTE BUTTON 
YEAH 
IN THE WHOLE LIKE IF YOU HOLD THE WHOLE DOWN THEN IT WILL MEET 
YEAH BUT IT'S A SCROLL AND CLICK ISN'T IT 
OKAY COOL 
SO THAT THAT SOLVES THE WHOLE MUTE ISSUE 
YEAH 
YEAH UH WE HOLD THE REMOTE 
UH BUT IT IT DOES FEEL ALL COLD AND SLIMY 
I HATE PLAY DO IT'S JUST MINGING 
BUT YEAH UH THAT'S COOL COOL 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
WALES 
MM 
COOL OKAY 
RIGHT OKAY 
FABULOUS YEAH 
OKAY COOL 
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS PREFER PREPARE THE EVALUATION OF THE NEW DESIGN 
UM SO WE'RE GONNA BE USING A SEVEN POINT SCALE SO ON SO YOU KNOW YES 
IT TOTALLY MEETS WITH THAT REQUIREMENT AND SEVEN IS ON IT REALLY DOESN'T WE NEED TO GO BACK AND START AGAIN 
UM YOU KNOW 
BASICALLY WHAT I DID WAS I WENT THROUGH ALL THE LIKE USER REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE AND WE'VE WORKED ON AND LIKE MADE A LIST OF THEM 
UM YOU KNOW SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE EACH ONE AND LIKE IS IT WAS ABOUT GOING BACK TO THE START AND SAYING OH YEAH 
WE DID MANAGE TO DO THAT ARE UH NO WE REALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT 
OKAY 
COOL SO THESE ARE WHAT THEY ARE 
OH 
YES I DID HAVE A. B. C. AND D. DOWN HERE BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE TURNED INTO LIKE JUST BULLET POINTS 
OKAY 
BUT IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THEY SAY A. B. C. AND D. THEN THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD 
WELL I THOUGHT WE'D UM KINDA SAID THAT YOU'D HAVE A LITTLE THING TO STICK ON THE T. V. 
YEAH 
COOL 
OKAY 
SO BE ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT 
THAT'S THIS ONE 
WHAT DO YOU ALL SAY 
YEAH 
UH WE'RE ALL SO PROUD OF THE 
OKAY SO THAT'LL BE A SEVEN FOR A. 
COULD UH NO YOU CAN'T WHILST THAT'S UP THERE 
OKAY UM UH WHAT I'VE DONE IN THE NEXT PAGE SO I'VE SET IT UP SO WE JUST PUT THE MARKS IN 
YEAH 
BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT 
IF YOU TAKE A NOTE OF THEM AND THEN I'LL PUT THEM IN IN A MINUTE 
OKAY SO WE'RE ALL AGREEING ON SEVEN FOR A. 
COOL OKAY 
DOES IT MATCH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER 
YEAH 
I MEAN 
YEAH 
I TH I THINK IT'S NOT IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A PEN 
YEAH BUT I MEAN BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A PEN YOU KNOW LEFT HANDED PEOPLE CAN'T NORMALLY WRITE RIGHT HANDED 
BUT THEY CAN NORMALLY DO MOST THINGS RIGHT HANDED SO I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT SUCH A BIG ISSUE 
YEAH 
I MEAN YOU CAN YOU CAN USE YOUR FINGER TO TO SCROLL RATHER THAN YOUR THUMB 
SO I MEAN THAT DOES KIND OF NEGATE THE WHOLE R. S. I. ISSUE 
SO MAYBE WE NEED TO PUT THAT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF INVESTIGATION MAYBE GIVE IT A FIVE I WOULD SAY 
WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I TH I THINK THE ALTERNATIVE IS FLIPPING FROM THE TOP 
YEAH UM 
BUT YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT MAKING IT SMALLER YEAH 
BECAUSE 
SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT SIDE FLAT 
SO IT WORKS LIKE A MOBILE PHONE FLIPPING BUT YOU YOU KNOW AS LONG AS THAT SIDE'S FLAT THAN THAT WILL WORK 
OKAY 
UM OKAY SO C. 
OR ARE WE ADMITTING DEFEAT ON C. OR ARE WE SAYING WE'RE GONNA STICK A LOCATOR ON THE T. V. 
THERE'S A LOCATOR 
COOL IS THAT MEANS YOU NEED A THAT DOES MEAN YOU NEED A LITTLE SPEAKER ON IT THOUGH DOESN'T IT 
TO MAKE IT BEEP 
OR A BUZZER 
OKAY 
SO THAT'S TWO SO THAT'S SEVEN YEAH 
IT'S LOCATABLE 
FABULOUS 
D. 
YEAH 
YEAH AND I MEAN DO 
SO SHOULD WE MAYBE SAY OF A FIVE AND EASY TO USE INTUITIVE BUT IT'S DIFFERENT 
SO DO YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S OBVIOUS HOW TO USE IT BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT FIRST 
SO WE GIVE THAT IN A FIVE YOU THINK 
YEP 
I'M GLAD YOU'RE ACCEPTING THIS 
IT HAS TAKEN A LITTLE WHILE HASN'T IT 
UM INTUITIVE 
BUT 
SORRY IT'S REALLY HARD TO WRITE ON THIS 
I JUST WANT A BIT MAD DIDN'T I 
UM OKAY COOL E. OKAY 
UM I WOULD GUESS THIS COMES BACK FROM THIS WHOLE B. THING LINKS IN HERE IS POSSIBLY FOR LEFT HANDED 
INVESTIGATE 
SO SHOULD WE GIVE IT A SIX 
SIX 
I USED TO SEND FIFTY TEXTS A DAY YOU KNOW AND I NEVER GET REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY FROM THAT 
SO I FIND IT QUITE HARD TO BELIEVE TO BE HONEST 
OKAY SO WE GIVE THAT A SIX YEAH 
OKAY F. 
HANG ON HOW COME IT'S SHOWING UP WITH THE THINGS THERE BUT IT ONLY HAD BULLET POINTS THERE 
THAT'S JUST 
OH OKAY COOL 
UM RIGHT SO 
YES SO THAT'S A SEVEN THEN 
UM COOL 
YEAH BUT I MEAN YOU DON'T 
THEY'RE NEVER BEEN USED I THEY'VE NEVER BEEN USING REMOTE REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE I DON'T THINK 
YEAH WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK 
SIX 
WELL THAT'S IT I MEAN 
YEAH BUT I MEAN EVERYTHING HAS BEEN USED IN SPACE BEFORE IT GETS TO ANYONE ELSE REALLY HASN'T IT 
SO I DON'T THINK MANY PEOP 
THAT'S IT THEY CAN TAKE IT WITH THEM 
SO WE GIVE IT SEVEN AND WE WRITE 
THERE WE GO 
COOL 
SO WE NEED THE AVERAGE HERE SO WE GOT 
SEVEN 
SO WE'VE GOT FOUR SEVENS SO THAT'S TWENTY EIGHT THREE SIXES EIGHTEEN 
TWO THREE FOUR 
SEVEN EIGHT 
OKAY THAT'S PRETTY GOOD I THINK 
UM NO THAT'S IT YEAH 
COOL THERE WE GO 
THERE WE GO AND THERE ARE THE MARKS 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT RUBBER COMES COLOURED DOESN'T IT 
YOU KNOW 
YEAH YOU MIGHT END UP HAVING TO TAKE OFF THE 
SAMPLE SENSOR 
NO 
WE'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE PUSHBUTTON THOUGH HAVEN'T WE 
'CAUSE THEN YOU HAVE 
THAT MEANS YOU CAN ONLY HAVE TWENTY FIVE PUSH BUTTONS IN TOTAL DOESN'T IT 
NOT COUNTING ANYTHING WE'D STILL BE ON BUDGET 
TWELVE POINT FIVE 
NO 
WELL IT DOESN'T BUT IT UH 
AND L. C. DISPLAY 
THIS SAMPLE SENSOR 
YEAH THE SAMPLE SENSOR WILL HAVE TO GO 'CAUSE THAT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE THING IN THERE 
YEAH 
BUT THAT'S A BIT OF A GIMMICK ANYWAY REALLY ISN'T IT 
WE CAN AFFORD TO GET RID OF IT 
SO THAT MEANS NO LOCATOR DOES IT 
I MEAN DOES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY YEAH 
SO I WAS GONNA SAY THE SCROLL WHEEL PUSHBUTTON THING 'CAUSE 
BUT THAT'S WELL YOU WOULD JUST HAVE TO TO SPIN IT DOWN 
SO THAT'S POINT THREE 
YEAH I MEAN THAT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY COST ANY MORE 
THAT'S THE SPIN WHEEL THOUGH ISN'T IT 
DIDN'T THAT CAME WITH THE L. C. 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO SO WE'RE POINT THREE OVER 
UNLESS WE JUST TAKE OFF THE SCROLL WHEEL ALTOGETHER AND JUST HAVE PUSHBUTTONS FOR THE VOLUME 
COULD BE STILL PUT THEM IN THE SIDE 
BUT YEAH 
I MEAN THE SCROLL WHEEL'S PRETTY COOL BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL WE COULD ADMIT TO THE SINGLE CURVE COULDN'T WE 
YEAH BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
YEAH 
WE JUST GET RID OF A GIMMICK THAT WAS NEVER ANYWAY 
AND THE SCROLL WHEEL AS I MEAN ESSENTIALLY THE TWO BUTTONS THAT WAS IT'S NOT A GREAT DIFFERENCE I DON'T THINK 
REALLY 
COOL 
THAT'S NOT A VERY EXCITING COLOUR 
I THINK YOU SHOULD MAKE IT MORE VEGETABLE LIKE 
UH THE THE BEEPER THING 
IT 
YEAH I THINK JEN WANTS TO TO VIBRATE 
YOU KNOW YOUR PEN VIBRATES 
YEAH 
COOL 
YEAH 
IF WE'D HAD THAT SHEET AT THE BEGINNING SHOULD'VE BEEN LIKE OKAY 
SO WE CAN HAVE THAT LET LET'S JUST THROW IT TOGETHER AND DO WHAT WE CAN 
YEAH 
I THINK 'CAUSE THE MEETINGS WERE SO REGULAR YOU KNOW 
IT WASN'T LIKE WE WERE ALONE FOR VERY LONG AS YOU DIDN'T ST GO OFF AND THINK 
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT TO HAVE A VIBRATING REMOTE CONTROL SHAPED LIKE A BANANA 
AND THEN YOU KNOW COME BACK THREE DAYS LATER AND JEN'S GOING LOOK LIKE IT VIBRATES AND IT LOOKS LIKE A BANANA 
UM YEAH SO YEAH 
UH I LIKE THE PENS 
I WANT ONE 
THAT WOULD JUST BE SO COOL TO DO DO ALL YOUR NOTES AND SO 
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SAY THAT WAS THE RECORDING 
OKAY COVER UP THE MICROPHONE 
ALRIGHT LET'S TAKE IT 
OKAY 
IT IS A BIT LIMITING ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE THING FLEW IN YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE WHOLE WHOOSHING THING 'CAUSE THERE WASN'T TIME FOR THAT IS YEAH 
NOT THAT YOU CAN DO THAT IN THE BOARD EITHER 
WE COULD MAKE SOME LITTLE 
YEAH TOTALLY I MEAN THAT WAS FAIRLY TIGHT ANYWAY I MEAN ESPECIALLY WITH THAT LAST MINUTE ALTERATION 
BACK TO THIS IS JUST HAD TO BE CHANGED 
AND YEAH SO COOL 
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT JEN NOW 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
YOU WEREN'T LIKE A A DICTATING LEADER IS THAT WAS ALWAYS GOOD 
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE PEN YOU MIGHT ATTACK ME WITH IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T GO SHOPPING FOR REMOTE CONTROLS THAT OFTEN MAYBE SOMEBODY'S ALREADY THOUGH IF IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'LL BE LOOKING AT NEXT TIME I NEED TO WRITE AN ESSAY 
THAT LOOKS BORING I'LL SEE IF ANYONE'S MADE A REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH YEAH 
I THINK WE'D LIKE TO THINK THE IDEAS WERE NEW BUT WE'VE GOT NO WAY OF FINDING OUT 
THAT VIBRATES 
YEAH BUT THAT WOULD JUST CAME UP WITH LIKE THREE THINGS REALLY WOULDN'T IT 
YES 
AND IT'S FABULOUS 
IT'S IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS 
YEAH YEAH SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE A LITTLE BIT RUSHED 
YEAH WE'VE GOT LIKE FIVE MINUTES LEFT 
YEAH 
'KAY 
WE COULD DRAW ANIMALS IN THE BOARD AGAIN 
I DON'T LIKE PLAY DOH NO 
IT'S JUST MINGING 
IT SMELLS SO BAD 
IT DOES 
MM 
NO IT HASN'T BEEN 
DO WE HAVE TO GO BACK INTO THE OTHER ROOM OR CAN WE STAY IN HERE NOW 
OKAY SO THE OTHER WAY 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT FOR FIFTEEN YEAH 
SO YOU SAID UM ARE ARE WE STARTING WITH THE THE AS WELL YOU MAYBE START WITH LIKE THE MM THE SHAPE AND THINGS AND AND THEN I WILL EXPLAIN THE THE USER INTERFACE THE UH THINGS 
LIKE THE BUTTONS AND THE SCROLLING THINGS AND 
WELL BUT IT'S IT'S JUST IN A APPROXIMATION 
OH YEAH 
RUBBER 
YEAH 
UM IT COULD BE MADE A BIT SMALLER AND END OF COURSE IT WOULD BE AND YEAH 
BUT UM ONE THING WE ACTUALLY KIND OF UM FORGOT WHILE DESIGNING 
THAT ONE SIDE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ROUNDER SO WE SAID THE BACK SIDE ROUND YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND IT'S SPONGY AS WELL 
SO SO UH THE USER INTERFACE IS SO WE DISCUSSED LAST TIME UH MM NO NO THE ON THE COVER WE JUST HAVE THE VERY BASIC THINGS 
SO WE HAVE THAT ONE UH CHANNELS HERE STARTING FROM UM UH ONE TWO THREE THREE WOULD BE NUMBERS ON ON THE ON THE ACTUAL ONE 
SO IT'S FOR UP IT FOR UP TO SEVEN UP TO NINE AND ZERO Z ZERO HERE 
YEAH 
AND THEN WELL THIS IS ON OFF BUTTON 
IT'S IT'S QUITE STANDARD MM PLACE FOR IT AND AND ALSO THE COLOUR IS QUITE OFTEN RED SO IT'S IT'S KIND OF USER FRIENDLY 
AND THEN THESE ONES WOULD BE FOR FLIPPING THE CHANNELS BACK AND LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONE AND THE NEXT ONE 
AND AND WE WOULD ALSO HAVE A L LITTLE UM THING SAYING HERE PREVIOUS AND NE PREVON PREVON NEXT 
THE VOLUME IS IS SCROLLING 
IN THE SIDE THIS ONE 
YEAH YOU JUST DO IT LIKE THIS 
AND AND AND IT'S IT'S IN THE BACK SO MM COVER OR BACK LID BECAUSE IF YOU FLIP IT OPEN YOU CAN STILL DO THE SCROLLING HERE 
SO 
SO THE VOLUME SO YOU JUST SCROLL BUT THEN ONCE YOU FLIP IT OPEN OKAY 
THERE THERE YOU HAVE THE SCREEN AND AND YOU HAVE THE MM SPINNING WHEEL WITH OPTIONS TO CHOOSE 
YOU CAN MOVE BACK AND FORTH AND THEN IF YOU NEED TO M CHOOSE SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN YOU JUST PUSH THE CEN MM THE MIDDLE BUTTON 
A MUTE BUTTON 
WELL WE'LL HAVE THIS IN THE SCREEN ON THE DISPLAY 
WELL BUT THE ABOUT THE MUTE YEAH THE SCROLLING IS KIND OF YOU HAVE TO SCROLL ALL THE WAY TO MAKE IT MEET RIGHT 
OKAY YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
AND OKAY SO I SEE THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS ALSO JUST PART OF IT 
YOU CAN'T REALLY IS IT IN THE INTERFACE 
YEAH 
AND WE DO HAVE THE LOGO ON IT AS WELL 
SO I THINK IT 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK UM WE COULD DO L THE LOGO IN GREY IS IT IS IN THE WEBSITE 
IN THE ACTUAL ONE 
YEAH 
SO IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS 
YEAH 
YEAH TH YEAH IT'S DEFINITELY ATTRACTIVE 
UH THE LOCATABLE THING WE ACTUALLY FORGOT 
YEAH 
SHALL I JUST PREPARE IT NOW 
IT WILL BE READ IT 
SO SEVEN WAS THE THE MAXIMUM YEAH 
I I GO FOR SEVEN 
I WOULD THINK YES YEAH 
YEAH SO YOU SO WE WE MIGHT DO WE MIGHT WANT TO DO LIKE A UH ANOTHER UM MODEL ANOTHER ANOTHER VERSION 
WHICH IS LIKE EXACTLY THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THIS ONE 
YEAH 
BUT THEN THEN I THINK LEFT HANDED PEOPLE ARE ALREADY USED TO DISCRIMINATION ANYWAY SO THEY JUST 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE I MEAN ANYWAY RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO SCROLL WITH IT SO I IF THE MAJORITY ARE RIGHT HANDED IT'S UH 
OR MAYBE SIX BECAUSE IT'S JUST NO NO I ONE AMONG THE ISSUES I MEAN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO YEAH BUT MM BUT WE HAVE TO NICELY WITH THE HINGES HERE YEAH 
SO IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM IT WILL BE AND IT WILL BE IT WON'T BE HEAVY 
YEAH WELL YEAH BUT IT'S IT'S A BIT LONG 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LONG 
WELL I MEAN IT CAN BE OPENED LIKE THIS OF COURSE AND YEAH 
SO UH SLIGHTLY SMALLER 
YEAH BUT IF WE FLIP IT OPEN ONLY AS MUCH IS THAT 
MM THAT YOU STICK ON T. V. 
YEAH WELL W BUT L ABOUT THE SPEAK SAMPLE SPEAKER IS INCLUDED 
SO IT IT HAS SOME CAPACITY TO MM TO DO SOME TO MAKE SOME SOUNDS SO YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
IF UH UH OF THIS MEANS INTUITIVE IF IT MEANS THE WAY PEOPLE KIND OF ARE USED TO FINDING THINGS AND IT'S I TH I THINK IT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM UH THE ERGONOM ERGONOMIC DESIGN WELL MM I MEAN I D UH I DUNNO I MEAN THE THE REPETITIVE STRESS THINGS 
BUT THEN WHO WOULD BE REALLY PUSHING THE BUTTONS AS MUCH ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL ANYWAY YEAH 
SO 
YEAH SO IT'S KINDA 
YEAH 
YEAH IT DOES HAVE YEAH 
TECHNOLOGI WELL 
YEAH 
WELL MM WE HAVE WE HAVE THE SAMPLE SPEAKER AS WELL WHICH IS YEAH IT'S KIND OF NOW 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE ALL THEY ARE ALL RELATIVELY NEW 
SIX 
I MEAN HOW HOW FAR CAN YOU GO WITH A REMOTE CONTROL REALLY 
IT STILL HAS TO DO WHAT I WHAT IT HAS TO DO 
YEAH ISN'T IT FASHIONABLE 
YEAH SURE 
IT'S THE MAXIMUM FASHION 
FRUIT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE FASHIONABLE THESE DAYS SO 
SO I THINK WE'VE DONE VERY WELL BUT 
WHAT'S THE ASSESSMENT 
THE AVERAGE IS ABOUT SIX AND SOMETHING 
A LITTLE BIT OVER SIX 
NO WAIT A LITTLE BIT UNDER SIX 
NO WAIT 
UH THREE SIXES OKAY YEAH 
FOUR SEVENS 
SIX POINT SOMETHING YEAH 
SIX POINT FIVE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH YES 
RUBBER 
I THINK SOMETHING COLOURED YEAH PROBABLY 
SO I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY SPECIAL CO NO 
YEAH 
OR MAYBE MAYBE IF YOU WANT SOME KIND OF PATTERN THING ON IT YEAH YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
WE HAVE PUSHBUTTONS 
SCRO WE HAVE SCROLL WHEEL AS WELL 
SO YEAH YEAH WE HAD FOR MUTING YEAH 
AND WE HAVE L. C. DISPLAY AND YEAH 
UM 
YEAH BUT WHAT DO WE UH WE HAVE L. C. DISPLAY BUT BUT THE WH ABOUT THE S SPINNING WHEEL 
YEAH 
OKAY LET'S YEAH 
WE HAVE TO COUNT ALL OF THEM OR YEAH 
BUT IT WAS VERY IN INNOVATIVE INNOVATIVENESS 
WELL UM YEAH 
WELL THE SPEAKER UH THE SAMPLE SPEAKER IS IS EXPENSIVE BUT WE COULD JUST HAVE SOME SOME VERY VERY EASY DEVICE THAT JUST BEEPS 
THIS WOULD BE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH THERE YOU RECORD YOUR SAMPLES YOUR SPEECH SAMPLES AND 
YEAH THEN THEN WE WOULD BE IN THE B BUDGET 
YEAH BU NO NO YOU CAN PUSH THIS ONE BUT WE DON'T HAVE A PUSHBUTTON UH WE C WE DON'T HAVE THIS MUTING MECHANISM FOR THIS SCROLLING THING 
MM-HMM 
BUT I MEAN WE CAN PUT AN ADDITIONAL MUTE BUTTON ON THE TOP AS WELL 
IF YOU 
MM 
SO 
MM-HMM 
OKAY YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
WELL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BEEPING THING 
BUT YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE SAMPLE SPEAKER BUT IT WILL JUST BEEP SO WE STILL HAVE THE LOCATE 
WHICH COLOUR THE THE COLOUR OF THE PHONE OR THE COLOUR OF THE 
BUT IT CAN BE YELLOW AS WELL 
IT CAN COME ON THE SAME COLOUR IS THE THE CASE 
YEAH MM SO FAR AS CREATIVITY IS CONCERNED YEAH I THINK THERE WAS THERE WAS ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 
THE ONLY THE ONLY PROBLEM BEING THAT AT THE END WE HAD TO CUT SOME THINGS DOWN BECAUSE OF THE THE BUDGET WE HAD 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THE UM THE MEANS WERE VERY VERY GOOD THE MEANS WE SAID 
AND THE PENS 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND AND AND THIS TIME ALSO THE TIME LIMITS BUT ACTUALLY PREPARING THE 
YEAH 
BUT YEAH BUT I MEAN ALREADY JUST JUST PREPARING THE SLIDES BEFORE BEFORE THE MEETING YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I WAS I WAS SATISFIED WITH WITH THE LEADERSHIP YEAH 
MM-HMM 
AND THEN THE TEAMWORK I THINK I THINK IT WORKED QUITE QUITE NICELY YEAH 
TO EXPRESS THEM MM MM NO 
WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S PRETTY NEW PRETTY NOVEL SOLUTION FOR A FOR A REMOTE CONTROL REALLY ALL THIS FLIPPING OPEN THING AND 
YEAH NEITHER NEITHER DO I BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING AND AND NONE OF MY EXAMPLES WERE WAS WAS LIKE THIS ACTUALLY SO 
YEAH MAYBE WE MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A PATENT ON THIS ONE 
PATENT PATENT PATENT 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YES 
YES 
AND MY MAIN DIFFICULTY WAS THE THE TIME PRESSURE 
OTHERWISE IT'S IT'S ALL FINE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES 
YEAH IT WAS A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU 
YOU CAN MAKE SOME ANIMALS 
UH YOU DON'T LIKE NAME 
IT DOESN'T 
SMELLS QUITE NICE 
SMELLS VERY SWEET 
I MADE YOUR ANIMAL FOR YOU 
YEAH THAT'S THE ONE 
I'M PROUD OF IT 
UH-HUH 
HOW HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES 
YEAH 
OKAY SO 
PRESENTATION 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO UM BASICALLY GOING WITH OUR TREND OF VEGETABLES AND WE SELECTED THE COLOUR AND APPROXIMATE SHAPE OF BANANA 
UM 
YEAH 
UM 
YEAH 
UM SO BASICALLY IT'S THE IT'S THE FLIP OPEN THING AGAIN 
SO NOW WE WE HAVE THE OKAY SO UM MARK WILL EXPLAIN YOU THE USER INTERFACE THERE 
AND IT FLIPS OPEN ON THE SIDE IS IT OPENS LIKE THAT 
AND WE HAVE THE USER INTERFACE O ONE HERE AND UH THE THE L. C. D. AND AND THE SCROLL ARE INSIDE 
UM 
WELL EVERYTHING ELSE IS PROBABLY USER INTERFACE IS 
YEAH YEAH 
OH YEAH 
YEAH IT HAS YEAH 
YEAH WELL BUT I SINCE IT'S MADE OF RUBBER ANYWAY 
I I THINK IT'S IT'S UH 
YEAH 
MM 
HMM 
IT'S IN THE SIDE 
OH NO WE WE'D NOT PUT US IN IN THE COVER WE HAVE THE THE BEAR ESSENTIALS 
UH IN THE L. C. D. WE ARE YOU KNOW THE MAIN MENU WILL HAVE VARIOUS OPTIONS 
MM 
MM 
YEAH IT'S HIDDEN IN THERE SOMEWHERE 
COOL 
WE RAN OUT OF RESOURCES HERE IS 
YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK 
YEAH SO THE BUDGET 
I GUESS WE'LL GIVE IT MAXIMUM POINTS IN EVERYTHING 
SO 
YES 
OKAY 
BUT WE CAN WE CAN I CAN I CAN TAKE INTO UH UH 
UM THE THE ONLY THING THAT WE WERE CONSIDERING WAS THAT UH THIS THING IS KIND OF MORE FOR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE THAN FOR LEFT HANDED PEOPLE 
SO IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED YOU'RE KIND OF LEFT UH SCROLLING WITH YOUR FINGER 
BUT THEN YEAH 
YEAH 
SO BU IT'S IT'S NOT A HUGE PROBLEM BECAUSE I I IT IS OPERATABLE 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEP 
MM 
MM 
NO MORE THING IS THAT I 
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE CLUMSY WHEN WHEN IT OPENS UP RIGHT SO IT OPENS ON THE SIDE 
SO 
YEAH YEAH YEAH I MEAN YEAH 
SO YOU GUYS CAN DECIDE WH WHETHER 
OOPS 
YEAH BUT W WHICH MAKES IT KIND OF REALLY BIG YEAH 
UH THIS THIS KIND OF UH MAKES IT MORE AND TWO IT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THE U. R. CHANNEL 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
NO WE HAVE A LOCATOR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
INTUITIVE COMPLETELY INTUITIVE 
INTUITIVE 
AND UH EVEN THE SCROLL 
IT'S A IT'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY IS M M MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET USED IT IN THE BEGINNI SO IT IS KIND OF NOT VERY INTUITIVE BUT UH IT'S A GOOD TECHNOLOGY 
I MEAN ONCE THEY GET USED TO IT 
YEAH 
SO L 
YEAH OKAY 
I'M GONNA GIVE A SEVEN IN EVERYTHING IS 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH UNLESS YOU ARE A ALL THE TIME SITTING 
YEAH 
YEAH I I THINK IT IS ERGONOMIC 
MM YEAH 
AND MOREOVER IT IT HAS UM L. C. D. AND EVERYTHING IS THAT UH YOU KNOW UH WE MINIMISE THE PRESSING OF THE BUTTONS ANYWAY 
ABSOLUTELY 
SO IT HAS VOICE CONTROL 
YEP 
ANYWAY IT UH YEAH IT'S THE MOST SOPHISTICATED REMOTE THAT I EVER SEEN 
YEAH BUT THEY'VE BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER ON A REMOTE 
YEAH 
ABSOLUTELY 
THE CARROT BANANA REMOTE 
I THINK THAT'S A 
YEAH 
THERE ARE HOW MANY SIXES 
ONE TWO THREE 
THERE 
AND IN FIVE 
OKAY TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT FO FORTY SIX 
FORTY SIX AND FIVE FIFTY ONE 
FIFTY ONE DIVIDED BY 
MM I GUESS IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR A BIT 
MM 
ADVANCED YEAH 
YEP 
MM ANYTHING UH I THINK WHICH IS NOT MORE 
YEAH 
MM 
NO UH WE WE HAVE UH YEAH 
MM NO 
WE DON'T HAVE WE'RE NOT USING ANY OF THAT 
HUH 
WH WH WHAT IS THE LIMIT 
OH 
MM I DON'T THINK SO NO 
NO IT SAYS WHAT WHAT IS THE KIND OF INTERFACE IF IT IS PUSHBUTTON THEN YOU GOT A ZERO POINT FIVE 
IT'S A SCROLL WHEEL AS WE WE'VE PUT IT'S PUSHBUTTON AND SCROLL WHEEL AND L. C. D. DISPLAY SO THAT'S THAT'S THE OTHER KIND OF INTERFACES THAT WE HAVE 
WH WH WHAT'S OUR CRITERIA 
OH OKAY 
UH IT DOES NOT HAVE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION BUT IT DOES HAVE FOR THE FEEDBACK SPEAKER 
WHEN YOU SAY WHEN YOU PRESS ON IT SAYS ONE OR IT SAYS HELLO 
MM AND THE LOCATOR ALSO GOES AWAY 
A ALSO I IN THE CASE I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU WILL EVALUATE THIS IS A CURVED SURFACE 
BECAUSE IT'S JUST RUBBER SO IT'S PROBABLY A FLAT SURFACE RUBBER 
UH I MEAN UH UM YEAH 
UM 
SO THA THAT MEAN THAT WE CANNOT PRESS HOW DO WE HOW DO WE MAKE A SELECTION IN UH IN THE L. C. D. 
IF IN THE L. C. D. WE CAN SCROLL RIGHT 
BUT HOW DO WE MAKE A SELECTION IF WE D CANNOT PUSH THE BUTTON 
NO W W W BUT UH IT'S IT'S THE SCROLL WHEEL AND I THOUGHT WE WERE REFERRING TO THIS IS A SCROLL SPINNING WHEEL AND PUSHBUTTON THING 
THAT COMES WITH THE L. C. D. 
UH SO SO TH TH THIS IS 
SO WE'RE ADDING COSTS FOR RIGHT OKAY UH I MEAN I THINK THIS IS GOOD 
INSTEAD OF SCROLLING HERE WE HAVE TWO BUTTONS HERE UP FOR UP AND DOWN 
IN THE SIDE 
MM UH IT SOUNDS GOOD ACTUALLY YEAH 
WE HAVE YEAH 
NOT REALLY NO 
BECAUSE WE KEEP ALL THE FEATURES WE KEEP VOICE RECOGNITION WE KEEP L. C. D. DISPLAY 
WE INSTEAD OF HAVING SCROLLING WE WE JUST PUSH THE BUTTONS 
UM YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT WE ALSO THE LOCATOR 
SO INSTEAD OF SPEAKER 
'KAY 
I THINK IT MM 
I THINK UH IN ONE THING THAT WAS LACKING UH WAS THAT WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE VARIOUS THINGS COST TO BEGIN WITH 
UM WE KAP KEPT A ADDING THINGS RANDOMLY 
SO HAD WE KNOWN 
YEAH THAT ARE NOT YEAH 
YEAH 
SO DO ALL THE RANDOM DECISIONS AT THE END COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED 
MM 
YEAH MM 
YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S IT'S IT'S I WONDER WHAT ONE OF THESE COSTS 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
I GUESS IT WAS A FAIRLY SMALL GROUP IS ALL OF US GOT TO EXPRESS OUR OPINIONS YEAH 
MM 
HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOOD THOUGH BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GIVEN TOO MUCH TIME THEN YOU GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR TIME AND UM YEAH 
ALTHOUGH WE COULD HAVE MADE THE R. S BETTER HAD WE HAD FIVE MORE MINUTE 
WE CERTAINLY ARE MM 
YEAH 
YEAH SOME HERE 
MM UH NO 
I DON'T THINK SO 
WAS THERE A QUESTIONNAIRE ALREADY SENT 
SO THAT ALRIGHT 
OR 
OKAY 
KEEPS COMING OFF 
'S FIDDLY 
RIGHT 
UH ANOTHER ONE 
OH 
VERY NICE 
'KAY 
OKAY 
CELP 
OH 
IT'S AN ELEPHANT 
OH MY GOSH I'M NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO DRAW THAT WELL 
DOES IT 
OH 
MM 
I HAVE AN IDEA WHAT MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS 
OH 
IT'S 
A WHITE 
ALRIGHT 
HOW 
NO 
GREAT 
UM 
OKAY 
NOT QUITE SURE HOW THIS IS GONNA WORK 
COOL 
UH WELL I'LL TRY MY BEST TO DRAW 
CAN I JUST DRAW THE FACE 
IT'S A CAT 
WHICH ALSO HAS WHAT 
A BIG FAT BODY AND 
BIG AND A LONG TAIL 
WHY 
BECAUSE UM CUDDLY 
AND USUALLY CATS ARE VERY FRIENDLY 
USUALLY 
AND THEY'RE HEALING AS WELL 
THEY HEAL 
AND THEY CAN FEEL WHEN A HUMAN'S GOT PROBLEMS SO 
SO THAT'S WHY I LIKE CATS 
THERE WE ARE THAT'S ME 
MM 
MM-HMM 
OH 
MARKET RANGE INTERNATIONALLY SOLD 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL 
WELL 
A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR T. V. 
WHAT WOULD I LIKE 
UM 
MEDIUM 
MM 
TWELVE FIFTY 
OUCH 
GUESS 
COULDN'T WE HAVE LIKE IN THAT COMES OUT 
LIKE SO YOU HAVE NO NO LIKE MM IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE REALLY THICK 
I MEAN REMOTE CONTROLS CAN BE THIN BITS 
AND THEN YOU HAVE ONE FOR YOUR D. V. D. AND YOU SORT OF SLIDE IT IT AND THEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE YOU SLIDE IT IT 
HAVE SLIDES 
AND THEN IT ALL COMES COMPACT 
NOT IN 
SO IT'S NOT YOU ACTUALLY JUST PUTTING THERE ARE FOR DIFFERENT REMOTES TOGETHER ABOUT MAKING THEM THINNER AND UM INTO ONE BASICALLY 
SO YOU JUST FLIP THEM OUT 
THAT WOULD BE COOL 
I WAS THINKING THAT LIKE A FLIP 
OKAY 
UM 
BUT WHAT'LL MAKE IT WHAT'LL MAKE IT INTERESTING FOR PEOPLE TO BUY THOUGH 
I MEAN IF IT'S IF IT'S JUST LIKE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
I THINK A FLIP UP THING 'CAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE THIS PROBLEM OF LIKE IF IT'S IN THIS WELL I DID ANYWAY 
LIKE WE HAD FIVE OR SIX REMOTES AND THEY WOULD BE LAYING IN THE C ON THE COUCH 
AND YOU'D COME AND SIT DOWN AND UH THE TELEPHONE'S THE TELEVISION SWITCHED ON OR SOMETHING 
SO MAYBE SOMETHING THAT LIKE 
DOES HAVE A LID OR CLOSES SO YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALLY PRESS A BUTTON OR RECORD BUTTON FOR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
BUT MAKE IT LIKE REALLY SNAZZY AND COOL PEOPLE WILL WANT IT 
SO MAKE IT YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
AND EVEN FOR KIDS AS WELL 
IT'S UM IT'S SAFER FOR THEM I GUESS 
LIKE THEY DON'T FLICK ONTO 
CHANNELS AND ALL THAT SL FLICK ONTO 
MM 
W WHAT DOES I. D. V. I. D. N. M. E. STAND FOR 
UH OR OKAY 
THESE ARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION 
AND I'M MARKETING 
THESE ARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION 
SO WHAT THE USER REQUIRES 
IN A REMOTE 
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS 
MM 
SO DO WE TAKE THIS OFF 
SO WE'RE 'KAY 
IN THE OR 
NO 
I DUNNO WHERE TO PUT IT 'CAUSE THE 
OKAY 
COULD YOU S TAKE IT OFF 
OKAY 
ARE WE FREE TO TAKE NOTES UH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BRING THE LITTLE THINGS FOR THE 
MM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
'KAY UM 
UM OKAY IT'S BIG IT'S GOT A GREAT MEMORY 
SUPPOSED TO HAVE A GREAT MEMORY WE SAY AN ELEPHANT NEVER FORGETS 
AND UH DUNNO KNOW WHY BUT LOOKS LIKE NICE TO ME 
NICE ANIMAL 
OKAY 
NO 
REALLY 
OH THAT'S A 
NOT BAD I WOULD SAY 
VERY GOOD 
MM 
YEAH 
SO THIS A T. V. ONE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE 
OKAY 
IT 
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH UH I MEAN HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE PER HOW MUCH 
TWELVE FIFTY 
SO DO WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC WITHIN THE BUDGET OR 
CLOSE PR I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
UM HAVE UH IN VERY COMPLICATED ONE ONE ONE SIDE WITH ALL THE D. V. D. AND V. C. R. ACCESS AND STUFF 
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE O ON UH A REMOTE CONTROL THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY SIMPLE WITH JUST THE CHANNEL 
PROGRAM PLUS AND MINUS AND THE JUST THE MUTE BUTTON FOR EXAMPLE 
I CAN REAL KEEP IT REALLY REALLY SIMPLE ONE ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER SIDE BE VERY COMPLICATED 
YEAH 
OR GRANDMA AS WELL YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE WHAT IS THE MUTE BUTTON 
NO BUT YOU WOULD SLIDE IT INTO UH SOMETH LIKE SOMETHING ON THE BACK WOULD HOLD LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PRESS THE BUTTONS BUT 
START BREAKING UP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
COULD BE REALLY LIGHT OR I DUNNO SOMETHING SPECIAL 
YEAH 'CAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IF IT SAYS JUST T. V. REMOTE DOESN'T SAY COM COMBINATION WITH ALL ALL THE OR 
MM 
OKAY 
THAT'S 
MM 
MM 
HERE HOW IT WORKS ON 
BU 
DO YOU THINK ARE TWO KIND OF OVERLAP BECAUSE 
YEAH 
I DON'T 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OH 
HMM 
HOW DO WE STA WA HOW DO WE START 
DOES ANYBODY KNOW 
SO THAT'S THIS 
OH OKAY RIGHT 
OH 
HMM 
OKAY JUST HANG ON A SECOND EVERYBODY 
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THIS YET 
UM 
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT BUT LET'S JUST START IT OFF AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
IF YOU'RE ALL READY 
SO SO THE AGENDA 
OPENING ACQUAINTANCE TOOL TRAINING AND PROJECT PLAN DISCUSSION AND THEN CLOSING 
PROJECT AIM IS A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S ORIGINAL UH TRENDY AND IT'S USER FRIENDLY 
PROJECT METHOD FUNCTIONAL DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK ANOTHER MEETING CONCEPTUAL DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK AND A MEETING OF DETAILS DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK AND A MEETING 
TOOL TRAINING 
TRY TO THE WHITEBOARD EVERY PARTICIPANT SHOULD DRAW THEIR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND SUM UP THEIR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL 
UM

MM 
OKAY 
WONDERFUL WELL DONE 
DO YOU WANT TO USE THE WIPE THE UM THE WIPER AND WIPE IT OFF 
AND MISTER AESTHETICS DESIGNER DO YOU WANNA GO NEXT 
NO 
NO 
OKAY WELL DONE 
YEAH 
MISS MAR MISS MARKETING 
UM YEAH I THINK YOU CAN JUST DRAW THE FACE BUT THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO DESCRIBE IN WRITING HOW THE REST OF IT LOOKS

UH NOT A VERY GOOD ONE 
OKAY WELL YOU GET IT'S A S 
IT'S A SQUIRREL AND I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE CUTE 
AND STUPID 
RIGHT 
OKAY SO I GUESS THAT WAS THE TEST TO USE OF THIS EQUIPMENT IS ALL WORKING 
MM 
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PAGE 
OKAY PROJECT FINANCE SELLING PRICE TWENTY FIVE EUROS PROFIT AIM FIFTY MILLION EUROS 
YEAH 
PRODUCTION COST UH RIGHT IT'S GOTTA BE CAN'T COST ANY MORE THAN TWELVE FIFTY TO MAKE 
EXPERIENCE WITH WITH REMOTE CONTROL IS TALK ABOUT WHO WHO'S USED WHAT 
ANY IDEAS 
STUFF LIKE THAT 
NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES 
AT QUARTER TO TWELVE 
YEAH 
AH OK SO WE'RE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS DISCUSSION LIKE RIGHT NOW ARE WE ARE UH OKAY 
I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST TO GIVING US INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE R TO DO NEXT BUT 
OKAY 
RIGHT WHO'S GOT EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS THEN 
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY 
UM 
'KAY UM 
W WHAT 
YOU WANT IT BIG DO YOU WANT TO SMALL 
ARE WE ARE WE GOING FOR LIKE LIKE TELEPHONES ARE GOING LITTLE TEENY TINY THINGS ARE WE ARE GOING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S BIG AND 
VIDEO AND TS HI FI AND STUFF 
MAYBE YOU YEAH NOW TH THAT'S THE OTHER THING IS IT'S GOTTA BE CHEAP 
'CAUSE I I I MEAN I WAS THINKING SOMETHING THAT'S GOT DIFFERENT LIKE MAYBE A A AN L. C. D. DISPLAY ON IT THAT'S GOT DIFFERENT PAGES FOR DIFFERENT DEVICES 
BUT THAT WOULD P THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE QUITE EXPENSIVE 
PER UNIT YEAH 
WELL AT THE MOMENT WE COULD 
W I MEAN WE 'CAUSE WE THIS IS WHAT WE TH WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE MOMENT IS JUST SAYING WHAT WHAT WE'D LIKE 
AND THEN AFTER WE AFTER WE'VE FOUND OUT WHAT WE CAN LOOK 
SOME DIFFERENT IDEAS WE CAN THEN GO AND DO THE RESEARCH TO FIND OUT OF THOSE ANY OF THESE IDEAS ARE FEASIBLE OR NOT 
SO WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT THAT CONTROLS LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS 
UM 
'KAY 
OKAY THAT'S 
TH THAT'S AN IDEA 
OKAY 
ONE SIDE FOR KIDS ONE SIDE FOR ADULTS 
LIKE IT OR SOMETHING LIKE A FLIP TELEPHONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAYBE 
F FLIP IT OPEN AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THE BUTTONS ARE YOU FLIP IT CLOSED AND YOU'VE JUST GET THE BASIC BUTTONS ON THE OUTSIDE MAYBE 
UM UH WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES LEFT 
BUT OKAY 
WELL WE'VE GOT A K WE'VE GOT A FEW IDEAS THERE 
YEAH 
I HAVE GOT I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE A BACK UP PLAN IF I 'CAUSE I I I JUST THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT I MEAN WE DON'T 
WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTROL EVERYTHING 
WE SHOULD HAVE A BACK UP PLAN OF JUST A REALLY GOOD TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT JUST THAT IS JUST FOR A T. V. BUT IT'S JUST A REALLY GOOD NICE ONE 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
SO 'CAUSE I'M JUST THINKING BEARING IN MIND THE WE'VE GOTTA WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S CHEAP TO MAKE 
I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH IDEAS AND STUFF A LOT QUICKER 
YEAH 
MY W YOU KNOW MAYBE EVEN 
OR MAYBE EVEN IS SOMETHING THAT'S FOR DISABLED PEOPLE ARE SO PEOPLE THAT UH B DON'T USE VERY WELL OUR BIG BUTTONS FOR TOUCHY BUTTONS FOR 
YEAH 
OR JUST ONE THAT LOOKS REALLY FUCKING COOL 
OTHERWISE WE'LL BE WE'LL BE HERE ALL DAY TALKING ABOUT DO THIS LET'S DO THAT ONE I THINK WE SH I THINK WE SHOULD 
YEAH 
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE WE'RE UH YOU KNOW UH SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE ALL A BIT SORT OF GADGET HEADS AND WE LIKE THINGS THAT DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE 
BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
I MEAN I'D LIKE IN THAT MAKES IT AS WELL BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN 
OKAY LIKE A LACK OF LIKE A LOCK FUNCTS FUNCTION ON IT LIKE YOU HAVE IN YOUR TELEPHONES YEAH 
YEAH IT'S GOTTA BE SELLABLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
NO PORN CHANNEL FOR CHILDREN 
OKAY 
UM ALRIGHT SO WE'VE GOT SOME IDEAS WE'VE GOT UM 
LET'S MOVE ON 
OOPS LET'S CLOSE THAT 
NEXT MEETING UH OKAY 
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UM WHICH IS 
UM 
YEAH THERE YOU GO 
SO 
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S YOU SEE YOU GOTTA YOU GO YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA BE THE ONE THAT'S WORKING OUT WHAT WHAT BUTTONS WE NEED 
UM 
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER YOU ARE THE ONE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING OUT KIND OF BOX IT GOES ON I GUESS SO UM 
WHETHER IT'S WHAT GOES INTO THE BOX SOMEHOW 
AND IN MARKETING 
USER REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATIONS 
YEAH WHAT 
RIGHT OKAY YEAH 
YOU TWO YOU TWO ARE GONNA BE JUST I THINK YOU JUST DOUBLE UP YOU KNOW YOU WORKING TOGETHER 
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOTTA GO AND FIND OUT DO THE DO THE RESEARCH 
SO WHAT PEOPLE WANT IN A REMOTE WHAT BUTTONS ARE USED MORE OFTEN AND SO STUFF LIKE THAT 
OH WE'VE BEEN WARNED TO FINISH THE MEETING NOW 
OKAY 
OKAY EVERYONE WELL DONE 
GOOD MEETING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE BACK END OF AN ELEPHANT 
AESTHETIC YEP SURE 
'KAY MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL UH LET'S SEE 
DUNNO IF ANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN NAPOLEON DYNAMITE BEFORE 
IT'S A LIGER A COMBINATION OF A LINE AND TIGER 
HAVE YOU NOT SEEN NAPOLEON DYNAMITE 
UH IT'S A HILARIOUS MOVIE 
YOU HAVE TO USE IT 
AND 
AND IT'S BEST CHARACTERISTIC IS IT'S PRETTY MUCH 
THE AWESOMEST 
ANIMAL 
BUT YOU HAVE TO USE THE MOVE TO FULLY APPRECIATE IT 
EITHER GO 
A PRAIRIE DOG 
UH A SQUIRREL 
YEAH THAT'S PRETTY GOOD 
ALRIGHT 
SO I THINK BEFORE WE CLOSE UH WE ARE EXPECTED I MEAN THE LAST SLIDE WANTED US TO MAYBE DISCUSS LONGER WHAT ARE 
WHAT OUR IDEAS WHERE 
I MEAN IF YOU WANNA GO BACK TO THE LAST SLIDE 
OH 
SO 
YEAH I THINK WE'RE I MEAN BEFORE WE CLOSE THE MEETING WE'RE SUPPOSED TO COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS FOR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK THIS IS JUST THE PRELIMINARY GET SOME ROUGH IDEAS FOR WHAT OUR EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS HAVE BEEN AND AND WHAT WE WOULD 
ROUGHLY WHAT WE WOULD INCORPORATE INTO A NEW ONE MAYBE 
YEAH I THINK WE'VE ALL GOT 
MM 
YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S LIKE THERE'S SORT OF A TENSION BETWEEN TWO IDEAS I MEAN 
YOU WANT YOU WANT ONE REMOTE THAT MAYBE CAN WORK UH ALL ALL OF THE FUNCTIONS OF T. V. AND IF YOU HAVE WHATEVER ASSOCIATED WITH T. V. THE D. V. D. PLAYER 
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT LOOK AT THE SAME TIME YOU DON'T WANNA REALLY BUSY REMOTE WITH A THOUSAND BUTTONS ON IT OR SOMETHING 
MM 
YEAH 
IT G CAN'T BE MORE THAN TWELVE FIFTY PER UNIT 
COST 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S LIKE 
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A TWO SIDED REMOTE THOUGH 
'CAUSE IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO USE IN THE WAY THAT YOU MANI MANIPULATE IT 
OH 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WE SHOULD UH I GUESS BY THE END OF THIS MEETING WE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST A A ROUGH CONCEPTION YOU KNOW STAGE ONE WAS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
WHAT EFFECT THE APPARATUS SHOULD HAVE 
OKAY 
UM SO I MEAN WE STILL HAVE TIME IN OUR NEXT MEETING TO COME UP WITH THE ACTUAL CONCEPT FOR THE USER INTERFACE 
BUT THE THE FUNCTIONS THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE WANT OR THAT IT CAN CONTROL THE T. V. 
BUT ALSO DEVICES CONNECTED TO THE AT THE T. V. I MEAN BE ABLE TO OPERATE 
D. V. D. PLAYERS THINGS LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
YEAH I MEAN 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST CONCENTRATE ON HAVING A A GOOD T. V. REMOTE AND HAVE TO BE UM 
HAVE TO BE LIKE ERGONOMIC SO IT'S COMFORTABLE TO USE UH SIMPLE TO USE AND LOOKS DECENT END 
SORTA FIND A NICHE FOR OUR REMOTE LIKE MARKET IT IT A CERTAIN KIND OF P KIND OF PEOPLE 
CERTAIN CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC 
YEAH NO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
YEAH RATHE RATHER THAN FOCUS ON 
YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
REMOTES SPINNING OUT FROM OTHER REMOTES AND HAVING LITTLE NESTED REMOTES INSIDE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING I MEAN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A FLIP FUNCTION IT CAN JUST HAVE A LOCK FUNCTION 
SO THAT IT'S NOT UH NOT USABLE WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO TO BE USEABLE 
I GUESS THAT'S GOOD GOOD FOR NOW 
THAT'S ME 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH IT DOES SEEM LIKE OUR OUR RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE SOME OVERLAP 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT SO YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES 
I AM REISSA 
R. U. I. S. S. I. 
DOUBLE S. A. YEAH YEAH 
SORRY 
MM 'KAY 
MM 
I'M FINE 
YEAH 
I UH YEAH YEAH 
DO I MEAN I I'M FINISHING OFF MY PRESENTATION 
NO NO 
UH I'M DONE 
OKAY 
MM 
IS A BATTERY LIKE 
THE ONLY WAY OF 
NO NO 
NO I MEANT LIKE 
NO 'CAUSE LIKE CHA 'CAUSE ALWAYS CHANGING UM UM BATTERIES CAN GET LIKE ANNOYING 
THE BATTERY'S DOWN AND MAYBE I DUNNO SOLAR CHARGED 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT OF LIKE YOU'RE IN THE PHONE IN THE OTHER ROOM AND YOU NEED TURN TELEVISION OFF OR SOMETHING AND YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO INTO THE PUT THE TELEPHONE DOWN 
AND GO INTO THE OTHER ROOM 
HOW ABOUT BLUETOOTH 
INSTEAD OF USING INFRA RED 
SO BLUETOOTH 
ISN'T THAT A BETTER SIGNAL 
MM 
MM 
'S JUST AN IDEA 
ADJUSTING 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
WHERE DOES IT GO INTO 
HERE 
THE BLUE THING 
WELL FUNCTION F. EIGHT 
NO UH 
COME ON 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL FOR OUR MARKETING REPORT UH WE OBSERVED REMOTE CONTROL USERS IN A USABILITY LAB 
AND ALSO GAVE US THIS IS RESEARCH AND WE ALSO GAVE PARTICIPANTS UM QUESTIONNAIRES TO FILL OUT 
UM TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE TESTED WERE A HUNDRED JUST SO YOU KNOW SO THAT HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE TESTED AND THESE WERE THE FINDINGS 
SO SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF USERS FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL UGLY 
OKAY SO THEY DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM EIGHTY F EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEM WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY IF THE REM REMOTE CONTROL LOOKED REALLY COOL AND FANCY 
SO I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT 
UM CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL WITH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER 
SO THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THE WAY THEY OPERATE IT DOESN'T 
LIKE MATCH HOW PEOPLE BEHAVE 
UM PER CENT OF THE USERS SAY THAT THEY ONLY USE TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTONS ON A REMOTE IS PROBABLY IF YOU HAVE LIKE ONE 
TWO THREE FOUR FIVE THE WHOLE UP TO Z TEN THEY PROBABLY DON'T USE THIS THEY ONLY USE THE UP AND DOWN CHANNEL 
EXACTLY 
THAT'S ANOTHER THING 
UM SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF USERS SAY THEY ZAP 
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THEY MEAN ZAP GOES LIKE 
YEAH 
MM 
UM TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW REMOTE 
I THINK ESPECIALLY FOR UH THE OLDER GENERATION 
I KNOW MY GRANDMOTHER DOESN'T LIKE MOBILE PHONES TAKES AGES TO WORK HOW TO USE 
ANYWAY UM AND THEY ALSO REMOTES OFTEN GET LOST IN THE ROOM SO NOBODY CAN FIND THEM 
SO MAYBE TRACKING DEVICES AS A GOOD IDEA 
UM PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
UM SO YEAH UM I WAS THINKING SOMETHING EASY TO USE ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER PEOPLE 
UM HAS TO LOOK REALLY COOL FLASHY GROOVY FOR PEOPLE TO BUY IT 
AND IT'S EASY TO FIND SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MAYBE AND ALSO WE ASKED THEM WHETHER THEY WANTED WHETHER THEY'D BE INTERESTED IN UM VOICE ACTIVATING 
SO VOICE ACTIVATION 
SO AND THIS WAS WHAT WE COME UP WITH 
THEN IF YOU LIKE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE THIS IS AGE SORRY AGE GROUPS 
SO FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE SAID LIKE NINETY TWO NINETY ONE PER CENT OF THEM SAID YES 
UM SO BASICALLY THE MAJORITY EXCEPT FOR THE FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLDS FOR SOME REASON DIDN'T WANT A VOICE ACTIVATED ONE 
AND NEITHER DID THE OLDER GENERATION BUT THE YOUNGER GENERATION WHO WE ARE CATERING FOR 
LIKE WHO HAVE MOST OF THE MONEY NOWADAYS DO WANT A VOICE ACT SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE 
WELL THE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD AND THIRTY FIVE AND THE THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE 
FORTY FIVE POINT SEVEN PER CENT SAY ONE IS 
SO THEY DON'T 
WELL 
THESE GUYS ARE GROWING UP 
VOICE ACTIVATION MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST 
UM ALSO WITH UM WITH BUTTONS A THING CALLED R. S. I. SO WRIST SENSE HUH 
YEAH REPETITIVE STRAINS INJURY SO THEY DON'T I THINK PEOPLE WHO WATCH T. V. MAYBE TOO OFTEN KEEP CHANGING CHANNEL HURTS THEIR WRIST 
I DON'T THINK SO 
YEAH MAYBE NOT SO HARD 
YEAH 
MAYBE 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
MAYBE THE THE BUTTONS NOT SO HIGH UP AS YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESS SO MUCH ARE WE JUST LIKE FLAT BUTTONS SOMETHING 
YEAH 
SO THAT IS UM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
WELL JUST QUESTIONNAIRES 
YEAH YOU CAN 
I THINK HE'S PARTICIPANT ONE AREN'T YOU 
CAN'T WE HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS ON THE REMOTES SO SOMEBODY CAN CHOOSE DIFFERENT COL LIKE DOES IT HAVE TO BE OF A CERTAIN 
BUT IF IT'S A R. R. IT WOULD BE REAL REACTION LIKE IF IT HAD A SYMBOL ON IT 
WOAH 
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE TO ONE COLOUR 
MM 
MM 
MM 
ARE WE ARE WE FINISHED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE 
'KAY UH 
MM 
THE 
OKAY 
WHO IS GONNA DO A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION 
Y WELL AS WELL 
OKAY 
YEP 
OKAY I'M 
OKAY 
I'M CATHERINE WITH A C. 
C. A. T. H. 
E. R. 
A. N. O. 
RIGHT 
TRUE 
HOW LONG AS THE MEETING 
OKAY 
NO PROBLEM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM JUST CONNECTING THIS 
ARE WE GETTING I 
REALLY 
OKAY 
COOL 
OKAY 
SO I'VE GOT A VERY QUICK UH 
OH 
OKAY 
SO THE WORKING DESIGN I'VE GOT A VERY QUICK PRESENTATION ON THIS IS UM I'VE UH NO YOU CAN'T USE A THING 
UH WELL I'M GONNA DRAW IT IN THE BOARD THEN 
IT'S IN BLUE UH AND I COULDN'T CHANGE IT 
W IT'S FINE ON MY SCREEN BUT NEVER MIND 
SO UM THE IDEA IS THAT WE'VE GOT THE 
ENERGY SOURCE UM WHICH IN OUR CASE WILL PR UH WELL OKAY NEVER MIND 
SO UM I THINK MAYBE UH TWO BATTERIES I DUNNO WHAT THEY'RE CALLED SIX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UH AND THEN 
UM 
THEN ON THE UH REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF WILL HAVE UM THE SENDER FOR THE SIGNAL WHICH COULD BE UH 
AN INFRA RED SIGNAL 
UM WHICH WILL BE SENT BY AN ELECTRONIC CHIP 
AND UH THE CHIP WILL BE CONTROLLED BY THE USER INTERFACE 
SO WE'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT LATER FROM GABRIEL 
AND UH THE SENDER WILL SEND OUT THE TELLY ITSELF AN INFRA RED SIGNAL TO TELL IT TO SWITCH ON OR SWITCH CHANNELS 
UM AND THAT'S IT REALLY FOR THE WORKING DESIGN 
SORRY THE PRESENTATION WASN'T VERY UH COLOUR BUT 
REALLY 
COOL 
UM SHOULD I ERASE THIS OR 
OKAY 
FINE 
OR SUGGESTIONS 
WELL IT'S JUST YOU DON'T WANT IT PLUGGED IN REALLY SEE 
IN INDOORS 
I DUNNO SWI I TH I TH I THINK CHANGING YOUR BATTERIES ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS IS NOT REALLY A PEN BUT 
YEAH 
WELL THE THING IS UH Y YOU DON'T 
WELL WE CAN MAKE THE THE SIGNAL STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH WALLS IF IF YOU FANCY IT 
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT 
BUT 
WHY NOT 
I JUST THINK THAT IT'S IT'S GONNA COST MORE AND I'M I'M NOT SURE IT'S YOU'RE GONNA USE IT 
IT'S A FANCY D UH IT'S QUITE NICE BUT THEN I DON'T TH I DUNNO 
THERE YOU IF YOU WANNA WATCH THE TELLY YOU'RE IN THE ROOM YOU ARE GONNA 
BUT 
UH WE CAN WE CAN KEEP THE IDEA OF YOU I 
WE CAN USE IT A LATER STAGE MAYBE I DON'T 
DO YOU NEED THE BORDER 
OKAY 
SORRY 
WELL MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T WATCH SO MUCH T. V. THEN 
MAYBE IT COULD BE INSTEAD OF PRESSING BUTTON IT COULD BE JUST TOUCHING A 
YEP 
WELL IN THE PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT YOU'VE GOT THE ADDRESSES I THINK 
SO PROJECT MANAGER IT'S PARTICIPANT ONE TO A. M. A. 
YOU HAVE THEM I YOU HAVE THEM BUT WE'LL SEND YOU AN E MAIL 
YOU WANT TO HAVE FRIENDS DON'T YOU 
IT WOULDN'T BE 
WELL YOU COULD 
IT COULD COME 
BUT IT COULD COME IN DIFFERENT COLOURS AND HAVE THE R. R. COLOURS JUST SOMEWHERE LIKE JUST AROUND THE LOCK BUTTON COULD BE THE R. R. LOGO OR COLOURS AND 
IF 
COOL 
THINK WE CAN FIRST

YEAH YEAH I DO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU YOU WE DON'T WANNA OVERCOMPLICATE THINGS 
YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED TO 
YEAH EXACTLY 
BASICALLY WE'RE WE'RE DESI WE'RE DESIGNING AND MARKETING A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL UNIT 
WE'RE NOT W W W W DESIGNING SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PLUG IN A HEADSET TO AND AND YOU KNOW CONNECT TO YOUR LAPTOP COMPUTER AND STUFF 
IT'S UH 
OKAY 
RIGHT WELL DONE CATHERINE 
UM GAB GABRIEL LET'S UH LET'S HEAR FROM YOU IN IN IN SUCH THINGS

OKAY 
NOW THAT'S I JUST HAVE A Q A Q QUESTION FOR YOU 
THIS WE UM RESEARCH THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING LOOKI LOOKING AT THEIR YOU KNOW EXISTING UNITS STUFF 
UM HAVE YOU FIND THAT ANYONE ELSE HAS DO HAS LOOKED INTO THE LOCKING FUNCTION OR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
I WOULD SAY 
IT'S 
IF IT'S SIMPLE TO DO 
WHICH I THINK IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE EVEN IF IT'S A PHYSICAL YOU KNOW 
A OF A LIKE A OF A PHYSICAL SWITCH OR A PHYSICAL COVER FOR THE REMOTE EVEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UM THEN YES IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW 
LIKE SO YOU SAID EARLIER ON AB AB AB A FLIP THING SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT YOU KNOW BEING PHYSICAL 
LIKE NOT 
UM I'VE HAD WORD DOWN FROM HEAD OFFICE THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE CENTRED WELL 
SOMETHING WE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IS UM WE'VE GOTTA KEEP THE CORPORATE IMAGE WITHIN THIS REMOTE CONTROL UNIT 
IT'S GOTTA DO LIKE LIKE IT'S IN THE R. AND R. 
YOU KNOW THE THE COMPANY IT'S IT'S FROM WHAT I CAN SEE FROM OUR OTHER PRODUCTS ARE YELLOW WITH BLUE WRITING ON THEM 
UM 
WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
THERE YOU GO 
SO IT'S KINDA GOTTA LOOK IT'S GOTTA LOOK NEW AND SO YOU KNOW SOMETHING FASHIONABLE 
OF OF REMOTE CONTROL WELL IF TELEPHONES CAN BE FASHIONABLE THEN MAYBE REMOTE CONTROL UNITS CAN BE 
YEAH 
BECAUSE WE NEED 
YEAH 
GREAT 
OKAY FANTASTIC 
RIGHT WELL DONE GABRIEL 
UM REISSA 
LET'S PLUG YOU IN BABY 
YEAH W IT IT JUST TAKES A WEE WHILE 
'CAUSE WE'VE ONLY GOT FIVE CHANNELS 
I THINK THAT'S K FLICKING QUICKLY BETWEEN CHANNELS 
YEAH 
WOW 
YOU ARE A CHILD OF TECHNOLOGY AREN'T YOU 
SO THERE YOU G YEAH 
UH BUT DO THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE THE MONEY 
THEY THEY DON'T 
IT'S OLDER GENERATION THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE GONE OUT AND 
PEOPLE PEOPLE FROM THE AGE OF THIRTY IF THERE'S A BIG DROP OFF THERE 
FOR PEOPLE UP TO THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE YOU'RE KINDA SAYING YEAH THEY WANT IT 
UM BUT NO THEY'RE NOT SORT OF MOST PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE MONEY OR PEOPLE FROM THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE 
UH 'CAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR TWENTY YEARS 
UM AUDIO AND THE AND THAT'S A THAT'S QUITE A MINORITY THERE IS YEAH IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE FIFTY FIFTY THAT'S THE THIRTY FIVE PER CENT 
YEAH 
I WOULD SAY SCRA I'D SAY SCRAP THAT STRAIGHT OFF 
SO YOU SO IT'S SO IT'S SO YOU GET SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE A LOOK INTO THEN I WHEN DESI WHEN DESIGNING THE ERGONOMICS OF US HAVE A LOOK OF UM THERE'S ANY W ANY MEDICAL BACKGROUND WE CAN FIND IT BUT THIS 
LET'S JUS WE JUST WANT NEED TO COVER OUR ARSES SO THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA USE AS IN TEN YEARS' TIME 
SAY YOUR REMOTE CONTROL GAVE ME REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
YEAH 
THEY'RE HAVING A LUNCH BREAK AT THE MOMENT BUT YEAH 
I'LL SEE IF I CAN GET SO IF I CAN GET AHOLD OF THEM FOR THE NEXT MEETING 
YEAH 
OKAY 
THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT REISSA 
UM OKAY SO WE'VE BASICALLY 
WE'VE DECIDE WE'VE D 
WE'VE DECIDED THAT IT'S GONNA BE YOU KNOW UH WE'RE GOING FOR A BASIC TELEVISION REMOTE 
IT'S GOTTA BE SAFE TO USE IT'S GOTTA LOOK COOL 
IT'S GOTTA BE CHEAP 
SO UM 
NOW GOING BACK TO THE UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN OF IT YOU KNOW WE WERE LOOKING AT WHETHER IT SO MAYBE INFRA RED OR BLUETOOTH 
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST GO WITH THE SIMPLEST OPTION ON EVERYTHING UH AND THAT WOULD BE INFRA RED ENERGY SOURCE THAT WOULD BE BATTERIES 
OH MAN W WE CAN LOOK INTO USING THE SO YOU KNOW THE LITTLE TINY WEENY BATTERIES ALL LIKE SPECIAL LONG LASTING BATTERIES 
UM 
BUT A ONE THERE'S NO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY POINT IN MAKING A REMOTE CONTROL UNIT THAT'S GONNA LAST FOR FIFTY YEARS 
BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY WILL HAVE CHANGED AND YOU KNOW WE WON'T HAVE TELEVISIONS IN TEN YEARS' TIME 
SO 
I THINK WE'RE ALL UM PRETTY SUSSED ON THAT 
UM 
ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS 
EVERYBODY HAPPY IN THEIR WORK 
NOW THIS IS GOOD WE'VE GOT A GOOD STRUCTURE GOING ON 
WE ALL KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE YOU BEEN GE HAS HAVE ANY OF YOU LOT BEEN GETTING LOADS OF CRAP SPAM ON YOUR COMPUTERS

SO IT YELLOW AND BLACK OR IS IT YELLOW AND BLUE 
I I KIND OF THOUGHT IT WAS BLUE WRITING ON A YELLOW BACKGROUND BUT I MIGHT BE JUST GOING A BIT 
OKAY 
WELL 
MAYBE YOU CAN COME UP WITH A FEW WITH A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT IDEAS 
WELL AS THE THING IS SO WE'VE GOTTA KEEP THE COMPANY IMAGE 
IT'S GOTTA SAY PEOPLE HAVE GOTTA LOOK AT THIS REMOTE CONTROL AND INSTANTLY RECOGNISE THAT IT'S A REAL REACTION I PRODUCT 
THERE'S LOADS OF COMPANIES THAT CALLED R. R. 
THIS IS SLOG BUT THIS IS THE SLOGAN THIS IS THE THE THE THE TYPE 
YEAH 
WELL NOT NECESSARILY 
BUT WE HAVE TO INCORPORATE IT 
NOT NECESSARILY EVEN IF I IT JUST HAS TO YOU BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PRODUCT AND INSTANTLY KNOW THAT IT'S ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS AS OPPOSED TO A SONY PRODUCT OR A 
YOU KNOW A PANASONIC PRODUCT 
IT'S GOT IT SO MAYBE SO YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK AT OUR OUR OTHER PRODUCTS AND SO IF THEY ALL FOLLOW A S SIMILAR VEIN PERHAPS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
QUITE POSS YEAH

YEAH 
SURE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
UH GABRIEL 
A. L. 
THINK SHE'S FINISHING UP HER PRESENTATION 
OH 
YEAH ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCE LIKE WIN WIND POWER OR 
BICYCLE POWER 
ONE QUESTION I HAVE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CONTROL WE HAVE OVER THIS IS UM 
SO FAR AS THE INFRA RED SIGNAL DO WE HAVE CONTROL OVER 
YOU KNOW HOW FAR AWAY YOU CAN BE FROM THE RECEIVING UNIT THE THE T. V. AND STILL HAVE TO BE OPERATIONAL 
I MEAN MAYBE WE WANT ONE WITH A STRONG SIGNAL STREAM 
OH 
THAT'S TRUE 
OKAY 
UH I'M JUST GONNA USE THE POWERPOINT UH 
TECHNICAL 
OKAY 
OKAY SO WHILE THIS IS WARMING UP THERE IT IS UH 
SO I'M DOING THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
YEAH AND BASICALLY UH AS FAR AS METHODS I WAS I WAS LOOKING LOOKING AT 
LOOKING AT UH ALREADY EXISTING REMOTES TRYING TO FIND SOME INSPIRATION FROM DESIGNS THAT ARE ALREADY OUT THERE 
THINKING OF WHAT WE CAN RETAIN WHAT WE CAN DO AWAY WITH UH WHAT WE WHAT WE CAN PERFECT A LITTLE BIT AS FAR AS DESIGN UM 
WE DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S TOO RADICAL OF A CHANGE I GUESS I MEAN PEOPLE WANT A REMOTE THAT'S FAMILIAR 
THAT HAS THEIR FAVOURITE FUNCTIONALITIES UM AND AND DOES THE BASICS BUT 
UM SO WE CAN IMPROVE WHAT'S OUT THERE AND MENTION THAT 
THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY THAT PEOPLE WANT 
UM SO THINGS THAT SEEM LIKE ABSOLUTE MUST HAVES UH WOULD BE A VOLUME CONTROL 
UM SO UP DOWN KEYS FOR THAT UH CHANNEL KEYS UP DOWN 
BUT THEN ALSO A NUMERICAL KEY PAD SO THAT THEY CAN JUST KEY DIRECTLY AT THE CHANNEL THAT THEY WANT 
RATHER THAN DOING UP DOWN AND UH A MUTE BUTTON 
UH ONE THING THAT I DIDN'T INCLUDE HERE THAT I FORGOT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME WAS DOING UM SOME SORT OF LOCK UH FUNCTION 
UH I DON'T I DUNNO UH THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY 
AND SO ON THE RESEARCH THAT I WAS DOING 
THERE'S BASICALLY TWO TYPES OF REMOTES ONES THAT ARE ENGINEERING CENTRED AND ONES THAT ARE MORE USER CENTRED 
WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN ACCESS THE WEB PAGE FROM HERE BUT I CAN SHOW YOU UH 
YEAH 
SO THIS IS A ENGINEER CENTRED ONE IS YOU SO IT'S RATHER BUSY BUT IT ALSO LETS YOU PLAY YOUR MOVIE 
STOP YOUR MOVIE FAST FORWARD ALL THESE UM FREEZE FRAME 
UH AND THIS IS A USER CENTRED ONE 
UH IT'S IT'S EASIER TO GO JUST GLANCE AT THIS AND SO WHAT'S POSSIBLE TO DO YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE STARING AT AT FOUR FIVE MINUTES 
AND I JUDGING FROM WHAT WHAT WE ALL TALKED ABOUT DURING OUR LAST MEETING I KIND OF GATHERED THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WERE GOING AFTER 
UH ARE THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING ON AT LEAST 
UM 
SO THE ENGINEERING CENTRED ONES UH PROVIDE A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY 
BUT IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OVERWHELMING SO THE USER CENTRED ONES JUST FOCUS ON EASE OF US 
UH AND THIS SORT OF OVERLAPS WITH WHAT THE MARKETING PERSON UH REISSA 
BECAUSE UH WE WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT BEFORE WE MAKE FIRM DECISIONS ON THIS 
SO UH YEAH THAT'S ME 
NO THAT THAT THAT SEEMED LIKE A NOVEL IDEA IS OF AS FAR AS I KNOW 
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY ANOTHER EXISTS LIKE YOU LIKE YOU SAID IN IN MOBILE PHONES 
THAT WAS SORT OF THE INSPIRATION FOR IT 
UM I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT WITH ONE IN ALL MY YEARS IN IN THE REMOTE BUSINESS 
I'VE HAVEN'T I'VE NEVER SEEN A LOCKING FUNCTIONALITY 
I DUNNO WHAT UH DO YOU GUYS HAVE A A YOU ARE ANY IN THAT A FEELING ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S REALLY NECESSARY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
RIGHT 
MM 
RIGHT 
AND OUR MOTTO IS SO WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
I THINK I THINK WE HAVE TO CARRY THAT MENTAL 
MM 
WELL YEAH THIS I THINK 
WE CAN SEE WE TALKED ABOUT THE LAYOUT IN MY PRESENTATION AND WHAT I DIDN'T MENTION YET REALLY IS IS THE SORT OF LIKE THE ERGONOMIC DESIGN 
I IT I THINK WE CAN MAKE BIG IMPROVEMENTS OVER THESE TWO THAT YOU SEE HERE I MEAN 
UH EVERYTHING IS GOING TO ERGONOMIC YOU KNOW 
THERE'S YOU KNOW MICE FOR YOUR COMPUTERS THAT ARE VERY ERGONOMIC AND KEYBOARDS AND THAT COULD BE ONE OF OUR NICHES P SORT OF UH UH IN THE MARKET 
I GUESS 
UM 
YEAH 
OH YEAH THIS IS GETTING ALL 
MM 
YEAH THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO DO FUNCTION F. EIGHT AND IT SHOULD COME UP 
YEAH IT JUST TAKES A SECOND UH 
YEAH YOU WANNA NAVIGATE THE CHANNELS QUICKLY I GUESS 
MM 
NO I WOULD I WOULD SAY THE OLDER THE OLDER PEOPLE YEAH 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE MY GUESS AS WELL 
WHAT ABOUT JUST FROM THE THE PROSPECTIVE OF OUR MANUFACTURING COST 
I MEAN IF IF IT'S TWELVE FIFTY PER UNIT 
I MEAN OKAY THERE'S 
OH 
REPETITIVE STRAIN UH REP REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY OR LIKE FROM DOING 
MM 
MM 
YEAH WE SHOULD PROBABLY CONSULT WITH OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT UH 
YEAH 
I THINK WE CAN DO SOME REALLY IN IN THAT DEPARTMENT THE THE ERGONOMIC DEPARTMENT WE CAN MAKE SOME SOME REALLY GOOD IMPROVEMENTS 
MM 
YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALL IN THE PRETTY MUCH ON THE SAME PAGE 
UH IT'S PROBABLY JUST YOU 'CAUSE YOU'RE THE PROJECT MANAGER 
SELL TRYING TO SELL YOUR THINGS 
OKAY 
NO I DON'T 
I 
OH 
UH IT'S JUST PARTICIPANT ONE OH OKAY 
YEAH 
WELL IT'S JUST W IT'S JUST IT'S JUST PAR PARTICIPANT ONE PARTICIPANT TWO 
SO ARE WE HEADED TOWARDS LIKE A B A BIG YELLOW AND BLACK REMOTE AS FAR AS MAYBE THAT'S OUR NEXT MEETING THAT WE DISCUSS THAT 
WELL IT'S LIKE WHAT NO I WHAT AND BLUE ON A BLACK BACKGROUND WITH WHAT WITH YELLOW BORDERS 
MAYBE THAT'S LIKE GETTING AHEAD OF OURSELVES 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COME ON DOWN FROM FROM THE HIGHER UPS SO I MEAN WE ARE SORT OF BEHOLDEN TO THEM 
NOT ONE COLOUR BUT THE PATTERN NEEDS TO BE RECOGNISABLE 
YEAH PRETTY SOON I THINK I GUESS THAT'S NOW 
ALRIGHT SO YOU ALL SOON 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
I COVER MYSELF UP 
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED ONE OF THIS I REALLY HAVE 
WHERE DO YOU BUY 'EM FROM 
THEY'RE 
YEAH 
OH MY GOSH 
MM-HMM 
BATTERIES 
IT'S HERE 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
I THINK RUBBER'S 
BUT AFTER MY AFTER MY FASHION THING I THINK YOU'LL REALISE THAT RUBBER IS MORE 
PEOPLE 
WHAT ABOUT THE JUST DEVELOPED UH SAMPLE SENSOR 
GO THERE THE SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER THING 
MM I DUNNO 
BE COOL 
CHANNEL TWO 
UH IT JUST GIVES AN ANSWER 
UH THEN THEN 
I THOUGHT I THOUGHT IT WAS WHEN THEY SAID 
I THOUGHT WHEN THEY SAID VOICE RECOGNITION THEY MEANT UM LIKE CHANNEL FIVE AND IT WILL CHANGE 
LIKE YOU TALK TO IT 
CAN I HAVE CHANNEL FIVE 
UH THEN FORGET ABOUT IT 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
SO IT WILL LOOK LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
YEAH 
WELL THE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS 
DON'T YOU HAVE TO MOVE YOUR 
MM 
MM 
YEAH THE RUBBER'S GOOD 
YEAH SO THEY CAN SIT THERE AND GO LIKE 
MM 
MM 
THAT DOES GET ANNOYING 
UH-HUH 
WELL 
MAYBE WE CAN 
RIGHT 
WELL I'M JUST BASICALLY LETTING YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKETS 
AND WHAT THE FASHIONS ARE FOR NEXT YEAR 
UM 
SO YES SO FROM LOOKING AT THIS YEAR'S TRENDS AND FASHIONS AND ALSO RECENT INVESTIGATION THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET 
WE HAVE FOUND THAT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET THIS OR LIKE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS LIKE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO WHICH WE'VE ALREADY PROBABLY DISCUSSED 
UM THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS LIKE AND FEEL 
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO LOOK AND FEEL FANCIER THAN THE ONES THAT ALREADY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE 
SO IT HAS TO BE 
YEP 
EXACTLY 
UM SECOND UH IT SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE INNOVATIVE 
SO 
TECHNOLOGICALLY IT SHOULD BE LIKE UM WORK BASICALLY I GUESS 
IT SHOULD WORK 
SHOULD 
THAT'S NOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
SO ONE ELSE 
THAT'S WHY I WAS THINKING BLUETOOTH 'CAUSE IF YOU LIKE PUT UP BLUETOOTH AND IT'S LIKE A BLUETOOTH REMOTE CONTROL 
EVERYBODY'S GONNA LOOK UH 'CAUSE BLUETOOTH IS THE ONE THING NOWADAYS 
LIKE IT REALLY IS LIKE PEOPLE AND UM WHEN IT COMES TO MARKETING LIKE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE GO FOR THEY DON'T REALLY CARE WHETHER YOU KNOW 
AT THE END OF THE DAY WHETHER IT WORKS PROPERLY OR NOT 
WELL THEY DO BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S NOT 
YEAH BUT IT LOOKS GOOD 
IF IT LOOKS GOOD AND IT'S IT CAN JUST BE THERE FOR DECORATION 
BUT LIKE 
YOU COULD ALWAYS INSERT YEAH 
YEAH BUT I MEAN PEOPLE LIKE 
WELL IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT IF YOU LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE BOUGHT BY PEOPLE 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT NOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT STATE OF THE ART 
WELL IT DOESN'T 
LIKE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOU KNOW BLUETOOTH THAT WAS JUST AN IDEA 
BUT LIKE IT NEEDS DO SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW SO NOW 
WHETHER IT'S A BATTERY IT COULD BE SOMETHING REALLY 
REALLY MINOR YOU KNOW LIKE BUT I THINK WE ARE REALLY KEEPING TO WHAT IS ALREADY OUT THERE 
AND PEOPLE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT PEOPLE'VE ALREADY GOT IT 
IF WE WANT SOMETHING NOW WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE 
AND UM JUST GO CREATIVE 
AND THEN YOU CAN MARKET IT 
NEVER HAVE TO CHANGE A BATTERY AGAIN 
I THINK SAFETY S 
YEAH 
THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT UH SO IT'S EASY TO USE 
AND I THINK WE'VE ALL UM WORKED THAT IT 
UM OKAY IN THE FASHION HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK 
NEXT YEAR'S FASHION I VERY MUCH IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE THM ARE LIKE THE THEME FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE 
SO NEXT YEAR PEOPLE WILL BE BUYING I FOUND THIS REALLY FUNNY YOU KNOW STRAWBERRY SHAPED CHAIRS 
AND THINGS 
YEAH 
RUBBER THINGS 
UM AND SO IT'S RUBBER THE FILE WHICH IS IN THIS YEAR IS SPONGY 
SO IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE SPONGY BUT SPONGY I WOULD SAY SO YEAH SO WE'RE ON 
YEAH 
AND SO PERSONAL WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING LIKE MOVE AWAY FROM THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS UH LIKE THE LOOK AND THE FEEL OF THE CURRENT ONES AND CHANGE THE LOOK AND FEEL 
WHILE STILL KEEPING TO THE COMPANY'S IMAGE BASICALLY 
SO YEAH 
I HAD TO SAY 
SO WE'RE MOVING ON THE RIGHT DIRECTION LIKE 
MM 
MAYBE MAKE IT LIKE FRUITY COLOURS OR SOMETHING 
SOME SORT 
OR 
MM 
WELL 
I THINK IF IT'S RUBBER 
IT NEEDS TO BE 
DIFFERENT 
I THINK IT'S IT SHOULD BE I MEAN WHAT DO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH RUBBER 
YOU KNOW LIKE 
REALLY DIFFERENT COLOURS BASICALLY 
OKAY SURE I SORRY I SAID THE WRONG WORD WHAT DO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH THE MEET THE MATERIAL THAT MATERIAL 
UM UM LIKE I'M JUST THINKING BRIGHT COLOURS 
BRIGHT NATURAL COLOURS NOTHING 
IT 
BRIGHT BUT IT NOT YEAH 
LIKE NO LIME GREEN OR BRIGHT YELLOW OR BRIGHT PINK 
WANNA MAKE IT DIFFERENT COLOURS IS ANYBODY CAN CHOO LIKE LIKE 
YEAH 
AND IN THE BACK OF TO HAVE THE LOGO 
WELL 
I CAN SAY IN THIS COUNTRY YOU'LL GET YOU KNOW LOTS OF PEOPLE WANTING SOMETHING REALLY FUNKY AND COOL 
LIKE AND KIDS WILL BE WALKING IN WITH THEIR PARENTS SAYING MUMMY I WANNA BUY THAT ONE 
AND UH PARENTS WILL USE THE WELL AS THE PRO AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S UM 
LIKE KIDS WON'T BREAK IT IT'S NOT BREAKABLE IF YOU THROW IT AROUND 
ESPECIALLY WITH YOUNGER KIDS YOU KNOW THEY CAN PICK IT UP AND AND 
YEAH 
THE ONLY THING IS IS THAT REALLY SMALL KIDS MIGHT CHEW ON IT BUT 
YEAH 
SO SO IT'S OR IT'S QUITE IT'S QUITE LIKE UM USER FRIENDLY AND ALSO FOR DIFFERENT FAMILIES 
LIKE LIKE FAMILY USE AS WELL AS FOR LITTLE KIDS AND FOR OLD KI LIKE TEENAGERS WILL LOOK AT I THINK 
ESPECIALLY MAYBE YOUNGER GIRLS IF IT'S IN PINK THEY'LL BE LIKE PINK REMOTE CONTROL FOR OTHER ROOM SOMETHING 
YEAH 
SO LIKE YOU WALK IN YOU'RE LIKE UH I LIKE THAT REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S SO BRIGHT AND THEN 
AND THEN THE SHOP ASSISTANT COMES UP AND SAYS UH WHAT COLOUR WOULD YOU LOOK 
AND THEN THEY GO LIKE UH I CAN CHOOSE THE COLOUR WOW 
SO IT PUTS I THINK EVEN THE CUSTOMER INTO MORE CONTROL OVER WHAT THEY'RE BUYING INSTEAD OF YOU'VE GOT ALL CLEAR IT'S EITHER THAT OR NOTHING 
SO THEY ALSO GET TO PICK 
WELL PERSONALLY I LIKE WALKING INTO A SHAPE AND CHOOSING A COLOUR 
IT'S UM 
YEAH 
MM 
D YOU'VE GOT THE 
EVALUATION 
MM 
YEAH 
SO 
THIS GIVES YOU ALL THE DETAILS 
UM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
ALMOST 
MM 'KAY 
NO NO NO NO IT'S FINE I'M JUST PREPARING 
OKAY 
WHERE IS THAT THING 
OH SORRY COULDN'T SEE 
WOULD THAT WORK 
OKAY SO THAT'S ME AGAIN 
UM SO UM FOR THE ENERGY SOURCES WE CAN HAVE A BASIC BATTERY 
A HAND DYNAMO WHICH IS WHICH WAS USED UH IN THE FIFTIES FOR TORCHES 
IF YOU REMEMBER THAT KIND OF WHICH WOULDN'T BE V WOULDN'T BE V V YEAH YEAH 
IT WOULDN'T BE VERY FANCY 
YOU CAN HAVE A KINETIC PROVISION OF ENERGY WHICH IS USED IN SOME WATCHES THESE DAYS 
SO IF YOU HAVE JUST A BIT OF GENTLE MOVEMENT THAT IT WILL GIVE IT THE ENERGY TO WORK 
OR YOU CAN USE SOLAR CELLS BUT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT INDOORS REALLY BUT 
YEAH 
I DUNNO ACTUALLY 
I DUNNO 
UM 
THINK THE THE UH WHAT WOULD COST THE LESS WOULD BE THE BASIC BATTERY REALLY 
AND UH IF WE WANT SOMETHING FANCIER I THINK THE KINETIC PROVISION OF ENERGY COULD BE NICE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH THE COST 
SO WE'VE GOT TO DISCUSS THAT 
FOR THE CASE OF THE REMOTES ITSELF UM THEY CAN BE A GENERAL CASE WHICH IS JUST A FLAT ON 
YOU CAN HAVE UH A CURVED ONE OR A DOUBLE CURVED IN IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO 
YOU KNOW KIND OF MORE ERGONOMIC THAT KIND OF SUITS THE PALM OF YOUR HAND THAT KIND OF THING 
SO 
UM THEN THE CASE MATERIAL ITSELF IS IT CAN BE UH UH EITHER PLASTIC OR LATEX 
UH RUBBER WOOD OR TITANIUM 
AND THE FOR EACH OF THEM YOU HAVE UH CASES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE TITANIUM 
YOU CAN'T USE IT FOR IF YOU IF WE'RE CHOOSING A DOUBLE CURVED CASE WE CAN'T CHOOSE TITANIUM 
AND IF WE ARE CHOOSING UM SOLAR CELLS THEN WE CAN'T CHOOSE LATEX FOR THE CASE MATERIAL SO WE JUST HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT 
BUT IF WE'RE CHOOSING JUST THE FLAT CASE THEN WE CAN GO FOR ANYTHING 
AND I THINK WE DISCUSSED EARLIER ON THE R. S. I. PROBLEM THING SO WE COULD UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND ALSO IT DOESN'T BREAK AS EASILY MAYBE I DUNNO 
SO RUBBER WOULD BE 
OKAY 
UH SO SO IF D OKAY 
AND THEN THERE ARE THE PUSH BUTTONS AS YOU CAN HAVE BASIC PUSH BUTTONS ARE A SCROLL WHEELS LIKE YOU HAVE IN A MOUSE 
UM ARE YOU COULD HAVE UM L. C. D. WHICH GIVES YOU A DISPLAY 
UM SCROLL BUTTONS AS WELL 
SO IF YOU USE A RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED CASE YOU MUST USE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS 
SO IF WE'RE GOING FOR RUBBER THEN WE HAVE TO DECIDE FOR THE CASE 
UM AND IF WE CHOOSE DOUBLE CURVED THEN WE HAVE TO GO FOR RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS 
SO IT'S A CONSTRAINT 
YEAH BUT IS IT A DOUBLE CURVED ONE OR NOT 
IF IT'S NOT A DOUBLE CURVED THEN WE'VE GOT THE CHOICE FOR THE PUSH BUTTONS IF IT'S A DOUBLE CURVE WE'VE GOTTA GO FOR RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS 
IF THAT MAKES SENSE 
YEAH 
NO BUT NO L YOU SEE YOU'VE GOT OKAY THE ENERGY THAT'S ONE THING 
THEN YOU HAVE THE CASE IS UH WHETHER IT'S FLAT OR CURVED 
AND THAT'S WE DON'T CARE IF IT'S RUB RUBBER OR NOT BUT THEN WE'VE DECIDED THAT WE GOING FOR RUBBER FOR THE CASE MATERIAL 
SO IF WE'VE CHOSEN RUB RUBBER AND IF NOW WE HAVE THE CHOICE FOR THE CASE WHETHER IT'S FLAT SINGLE CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED 
AND I'M JUST SAYING IF IT IF WE CHOOSE TO TO BE DOUBLE CURVED THEN WE NEED TO GO I DUNNO WHY 
BUT WE NEED TO GO FOR UH RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS 
SO THERE 
I DUNNO WE JUST NEED TO DECIDE ON THE ON THE CASE 
LET'S GO CRAZY 
AND THEN DO I HAVE A LAST SLIDE 
YES I D 
UM SO THE PUSH BUTTONS THEMSELVES THEY CAN BE JUST SIMPLE ARE THEY CAN BE SO THAT'S JUST THE ELECTRONICS BETWEEN THE BIT BEHIND THE PUSH BUTTONS 
UM AND THE PRICE THAT GO WITH IT WITH IT IS THE SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS ARE GONNA BE THE CHEAPEST 
UH IF WE GOT A SCROLL WHEEL THAT'S A HIGHER PRICE RANGE 
IF WE GOT AN ADVANCED CHIP WHICH IS UM USED FOR THE L. C. D. THE DISPLAY THING THEN THAT'S EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE 
MM 
YEAH 
THE INFRA RED 
YEAH 
WELL IF IF IT'S NOT CHIP ON PRINT THEN I GUESS YOU GET DIFFERENT CHIP COMPONENTS AND YOU BUILD THEM SEPARATELY AND DOESN'T INCLUDE THE INFRA RED 
IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE MM 
TECHNICALLY SPEAKING IT'S NOT AS ADVANCED BUT IT DOES THE JOB IT 
IF 
IT DOESN'T YEAH YEAH YEAH 
TOTALLY 
YEAH 
SO LET'S NOT GO FOR THE 
YEAH YEAH 
I AGREE 
SO IT'S EITHER UM THE SCROLL WHEEL OR THE PUSH BUTTONS 
WELL 
IT'D BE IT'D BE COOL BUT THEY ARE SAYING THEY'VE JUST DEVELOPED IT I'M JUST GUESSING 
BUT IT'S GONNA BE THE MOST EXPENSIVE OPTION PROBABLY NEED 
HM 
JUST IF YOU ARE REALLY LONELY MAYBE 
CHANNEL FIVE 
AND THEN IT SWITCHES ON 
OKAY SO I'LL GO BACK MAYBE AT THE PREVIOUS SLIDE AND WE CAN DECIDE FOR EACH PROBLEM WHAT WE SHOULD CHOOSE 
SO FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE DO WE GO FOR THE BATTERY OR THE 
CHEAPER OPTION 
OR YOU HAPPY WITH THAT 
OKAY 
SO WE'LL GO FOR THE BATTERY 
THEN THE CASE DO YOU WANT IT FLAT OR CURVED OR SING OR DOUBLE CURVED 
DOUBLE 
OKAY SO THEN IF WE USE DOUBLE CURVED CASE THEN WE HAVE TO U CHOOSE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS AND THAT'S FINE 
UP 
YEAH 
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD GIVE AN OPTION OF FLAT BUTTONS ARE A 
THAT THEY DON'T 
MM 
ALRIGHT THAT'S ME DONE 
SORRY 
WELL 
BLUETOOTH WOULD FOR EXAMPLE ENABLE YOU I THINK IT UM UM CONNECT FOR EXAMPLE YOU IF YOU GOT A WE CALL ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE 
BUT YOUR MOBILE PHONE IS DOWNSTAIRS OR SOMETHING YOU WOULD GET IN YOUR TELEVISION YOU'RE BEING CALLED BY THIS PERSON RIGHT NOW 
THINGS LIKE THAT 
NO I 
NO BUT IF YOU GET BLUETOOTH ON THE REMOTE YOU'D BE ABLE TO 
I WITH THE TELEVISION YEAH 
I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND AN ADVANTAGE 
WHA WHAT WE WHAT ADVANTAGE WOULD YOU GET FOR THE 
MAYBE THE KINETIC MO PROVISION OF ENERGY THEN 
IT'S BEEN DONE FOR WATCHES BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FOR REMOTES YET 
CHANGE THE BATTERIES EVER AGAIN 
YEAH WELL AND ONE LITTLE CHARACTERS YOU SAY YEAH BUT NOT TOO MUCH 
YEP 
NO VEGETABLES 
WELL YEAH BUT PEOPLE WOULD SO YOU FOR THAT 
SAID THE BEATLES SO 
YEAH 
WHY NOT 
I'M GONNA WRITE THAT DOWN 
THAT'S YEAH 
ALTHOUGH I'D BE CURIOUS TO SEE HOW MANY UH 
YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME COLOURS THAT I WOULDN I WOULD NEVER CHOOSE AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS HOW MANY PEOPLE CHOOSE THAT COLOUR 
MM 
AND PRODUCE LESS OF THE SILLY COLOURS MAYBE 
YEP 
ALRIGHT 
MM 
COOL 
IT IS 
GREAT 
THAT'S TRUE 
DOESN'T 
YEAH 
ARE WE TAKING THIS OFF 
I FEEL LIKE MADONNA WITH ONE OF THIS ONE 
I SAID I FEEL LIKE MADONNA WITH ONE OF THIS ONE 
RIGHT 
HELLO EVERYBODY 
BACK AGAIN FOR ANOTHER WONDERFUL MEETING 
SO UH EVERYONE READY 
OKAY WE C WE CAN HOLD ON FOR A MINUTE 
I FIGURED WITH THE SPAM THING IF YOU CAN'T BUT IT JOIN IN 
OR YOU READY 
OKAY RIGHT WELL I TAKE OUT THAT YOU ARE ALL READY NOW 
UM ALRIGHT FIRST OFF WE'LL JUST UH RECAP FROM OUR LAST MEETING 
UM WHICH WAS WE GET TOGETHER JUST TO BASICALLY DECIDE ON WELL TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY UH SUPPOSED TO BE DOING 
AND WHO WE ALL ARE AND STUFF LIKE THAT MM GET BIT MORE OF AN IDEA TOGETHER OF WHAT'S GOING ON 
UM WHAT WE ARE GONNA TALK ABOUT IN THIS MEETING IS UM 
NOW THAT WE KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE DOING 
NOW WE KNOW THAT IT'S A T. V. REMOTE AND STUFF AND YOU GUYS HAVE JUST BEEN OFF DOING SOME SOME UH R. AND D. FOR THAT 
THAT'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THIS THAT HAVEN'T HEARD THAT BEFORE SO I'M LEARNING ALL SORTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGI TERMS IN TECHNOLOGY TODAY 
UM YEAH WE'RE GONNA HEAR YOUR UH THE OTHER LITTLE PRESENTATIONS WHETHER THEY BE ONE COMPUTER OR IN THE WHITEBOARD OR WHATEVER YOU WANT 
UM I'D LIKE TO ME HERE O I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHO'S G WHO'S ON THE UM FROM FROM UH CATHERINE ACTUALLY FIRST 
I WANT WHAT I'D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IS UH IF WE'VE FINALLY DECIDED ON UM WHAT SORT OF ENERGY WE'RE GONNA BE USING AND 
IT'S JUST THAT YEAH LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM YOU FIRST 
GET YOURSELF IN POSITION 
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US REMEMBER THE FIFTIES 
DO SOL SOLAR PANEL THINGS DO THEY HAVE TO WORK FROM THE SUN OR CAN THEY WORK FROM A LIGHT BULB 
DOES ANYBODY KNOW 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY JOLLY GOOD 
WHAT'S A DOUBLE CURVED ONE 
OKAY 
SO THAT MIGHT BE AN IDEA OF USING THE RUBBER BUT THEN IT SHOULD YOU KNOW YEAH 
WHEN A T. V. PROGRAMME'S GOT ONE WATCHING THE MATCH AND YOUR TEAM'S JUST LOST 
YOU CAN FUZZ IT ACROSS THE ROOM AND IT'LL BOUNCE OFF THE WALL BACK TO YOU 
YEAH I LIKE THAT IDEA 
RUBBER WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL GOING WE'RE ALL LIKING THAT IDEA 
YOU THINK YOU CAN MARKET THAT 
UH WE LIKE RUBBER UH 
UH-HUH 
WELL WE'RE GONNA GO WITH I THINK WE'VE DECIDED THAT IT'S GONNA BE A RUBBER CASE IS 
PUSH BUTTONS INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE 
RUBBLE DOUBLE DOUBLE 
I'LL HAVE A BIG MAC PLEASE 
LET'S HAVE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS HEY 
YEAH 
SIMPLE YEAH 
CHIP ON PRINT 
IT'S A BIT 
OKAY UH WHAT I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HERE 
SO UH OKAY ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT 
WHICH I PRESUME IS LIKE IN P. C. B. AND THAT'S GOT ALL THE ELECTRONICS IN ONE BOARD INCLUDING THE UM INFRA RED SENDER 
RIGHT 
UM WHAT A WHAT ALTERNATIVES DO WE HAVE TO THAT 
YOU UM WHAT ALTERNATIVES DO WE HAVE TO THE CHIP ON PRINT 
SO IT SOUNDS 
SO WHY WOULD WE NOT GO FOR THAT 
IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S INSIDE THE THE UNIT 
I IT DOESN'T AFFECTS WHETHER THE CUSTOMER'S GONNA BUY IT OR NOT 
UM WE WANNA GO FOR ONE I I ALL AS LONG AS IT WORKS 
YOU KNOW 
SO LET'S NOT LET'S UH NOT BOTHER WITH THE CHIP ON PRINT 
YEAH 
SO YEAH PUSH BUTTONS 
WHAT ABOUT WHAT 
WELL WHAT DO WE NEED A SPEAKER FOR IN A REMOTE CONTROL UNIT 
SO 
YEAH 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANNA TO GO INTO WITH THIS PRODUCT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BASIC BATTERY 
IT'S CHEAP IT'S CHEERFUL IT'S WORKED DOES WORK 
WE WERE GO WE WERE GOING WITH THE LATE WITH THE THE R. S. I. RUBBER WEREN'T WE 
THE THE 
THE DOUBLE WHOPPER PLEASE 
YEP BUT WE'RE GOING FOR THE SIMPLE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
AND IT'S CHEAPEST ALL AROUND IT SOUNDS KINDA FUNKY 
AND WE CAN ALSO MARKET IT SO I 'CAUSE WE WERE S SAYING EARL YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER ON YOUR RESEARCH THAT UM THE THE PEOPLE HAVE THE R. PEOPLE WERE GETTING THE COMPLAINING ABOUT R. S. I. 
AND THIS IS ANTI R. S. I. 
SO THAT'S ANOTHER MARKETING POINT THAT WE CAN SEE 
BUT ANYTHING IS GONNA HAVE BUTTONS 
EVEN IF IT'S A JOG WHEEL IT'S STILL REPETITIVE 
YOU 
YOU SEE YOU CAN STILL GET IT DOES YOU STILL GET REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY WHETHER YOU ARE PRESSING A BUTTON OR PRESSING A FLAT BIT OF SCREEN 
IT'S THE V IT'S THE FACT THAT YOU ARE PRESSING THE SAME DOING THE SAME MOVEMENT 
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING 
BUT THE FACT THAT THIS THIS RUBBER I IS ACTUALLY USED IN THIS ANTI R. S. I. PS SPECIFIC 
YEAH 
AND YOU KNOW YEAH YOU CAN FUZZ IT ACROSS THE ROOM AND THROW IT TO THROW IT TO YOUR CHILDREN YEAH 
OKAY GABRIEL 
LET'S UM LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT THE UM IT'S THE INTERFACE 
GREAT 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
DO WE HAVE AN UH EXAMPLE OF A GOOD ONE 
BRILLIANT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
WELL LET'S UM SO W WHAT OUR OUR DEFINITE DECISIONS ON THIS THEN AS A TIME 
THE UM 
THE THE UM THE INTERFACE TYPE WE'RE GOING FOR 
JUST THE SIMPLE AS SIMPLE STRAIGHT SET OF BUTTONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY AND WE'RE NOT YEAH 
ARE WE GONNA HAVE HAVE ONE OR WE DO HAVE WE DECIDED ON WHETHER 
WE WE'RE GONNA USE SUPPLEMENT IT WITH ANYTHING YOU KNOW COLOURS OR PARTICULAR GIMMICKY BITS TO TO WE'RE NOT WE'RE JUST GONNA GO FOR SOMETHING 
WE'RE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKEY DOKEY 
YEAH I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS 
LET'S MOVE OVER IT 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH THE BUTTON THAT JUST DOES THAT YEAH 
COOL 
MM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WHY SHOULD PEOPLE BUY THIS WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY GOT A REMOTE THAT CAME WITH THE T. V. 
WHAT'S THAT MEAN 
OKAY NOW THE TROUBLE IS SO WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED THAT WE'RE GOING WITH THE STUFF THAT WORKS ALREADY THAT'S CHEAP 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE COULD UM 
OF COURSE THEY DO 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THAT'S YOUR FIRST THING YOU GO UH I'M NOT GONNA BUY THAT 'CAUSE I DUNNO IF IT WORKS OR NOT 
OKAY WELL WHAT DO YOU TWO THINK ABOUT THIS 
YEAH WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT UM 
YEAH AND AT THIS IS JUST GONNA ALL THIS IS BEING USED FOR US YOUR TELEVISION 
IT WOULD THAT WOULD MEAN YOU'D NEED A TELEVISION THAT HAS BLUETOOTH ON IT WHICH ONE ON TELEVISION DOES DOES IT 
THAT WOULD MEAN WE'D HAVE TO MAKE A TELEVISION AS WELL 
NO THAT WOULD BE YOUR TELEPHONE IN WITH YOUR TELEVISION 
YEAH AND I 
NAH THE TELEVI THE TELEVISION WOULD HAVE TO BE A BLUETOOTH COMPATIBLE BASICALLY 
ONE AND THERE IS IN THERE IS IN SUCH THING 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH THIS THAT'S THAT'S VERY GOOD 
AND AND THIS IS ALL TYING IN VERY NICELY 
THE FACT THAT IT'S MADE OUT OF THIS RUBBER WE CAN THROW IT BUT 
THE WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO THROW THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS BUT BECAUSE IT CHARGES ITSELF UP BY DOING IT 
BUT YEAH BY THE SQUEEZING IT THE 
YEAH THAT'S A GREAT IDEA 
WELL DONE 
YEAH 
I WANNA WATCH THE PINEAPPLE CHANNEL 
WELL SPONGY THAT'S WHERE 
YEAH WE'RE WE'RE AHEAD OF THE GAME THERE 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT YEAH IN THIS I THIS IS GOOD AS THROUGH ALL THAT WE'VE WE GO WE'RE RIGHT 
WE'RE GONNA GO GO BACK TO UM GOING WITH THE KINETIC THING THAT'S GREAT 
USING THE SPONGY RUBBER THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT ANTI R. S. I. YOU CAN SEE YOU SQUEEZE IT YOU ARE NOT ONLY THERAPEUTICISING YOURSELF 
YOU ARE CHARGING THE BATTERIES AND UM I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE BUTTONS BEING IN THE SHAPE OF FRUIT THOUGH 
YEAH THIS IS TRUE 
WELL OKAY IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY FINALLY UM AGREED ON SO 
ITS IMAGE 
LIKE YEAH WE'RE WE'RE SAYING NO WE DON'T WANT TO TO BE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 
BUT WE DUNNO WHAT IT SHOULD BE OR LIKE ARE WE GOING YEAH IT LOOKS SLICK 
BUT WHAT DO WHAT DO WE MEAN BY SLICK SORT OF THING 
I MEAN YOU SAID EARLIER ON I IT SHOULD BE FUNKY 
L KEEP IT CLEAN KEEP IT CLEAN 
BRIGHT BUT NOT TOO BRIGHT 
LIKE THE VOLUME BUTTONS SHOULD BE THE ALL THE SAME COLOUR AND THE AUDIO AND THE THE CHANNEL BUTTONS SHOULD BE ONE COLOUR AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
DO YOU MEAN 
OKAY WHAT 
OKAY 
THE 
YEAH I MEAN WE THAT'S W W 
YEAH 
THIS IS THE REMOTE CONTROL TOMATO 
YEAH 
WELL IT'S IT'S GOTTA BE CHEW PROOF 
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD MARKET IT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS FOR DIFFERENT SO WE COULD DO LIKE THE PINK RANGE 
THE BLUE RANGE THE GREEN RANGE THE 
MM 
WELL THAT'S THAT CAN BE DOWN TO BIT OF MARKET RESEARCHING YOU KNOW IF THAT'S EASY ENOUGH TO FIND OUT WHAT COLOURS ARE MORE POPULAR 
MM 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
WELL UM WE'LL ALRIGHT LET'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA AIM TO GET TOGETHER BY THE NEXT MEETING THEN UM 
SO 
FROM YOU CATHERINE WI YOUR Y Y YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON THE THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN 
UM GABRIEL YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON YOU KNOW COME UP WITH THE THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
THEN BASICALLY YOU TWO ARE GONNA BE WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS 
YOU WON'T BE GOING OFF TO YOUR SEPARATE OFFICES 
UM AND I THINK YOU ARE GONNA GET A CHANCE TO PLAY WITH SOME CLAY 
I THINK YEAH IT'S GONNA YOU KNOW COME UP KI YOU KNOW 
B B FOR THE NEXT MEETING BE ABLE TO COME ON AND SHOW US SOME SOME I SOME PHYSICAL IDEAS 
'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT UH YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S HARD 
WE WERE KINDA GOING YEAH IT'S GOTTA FEEL NICE IT'S GOTTA LOOK COOL AND THAT IT'S YOU KNOW NOW WE CAN ACTUALLY START 
YOU KNOW IS SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL SOMETHING OR THREE 
UM AND YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON THE PRODUCT EVALUATION 
UM 
AND I 
WILL BE UH 
TALKING TO THE BOSSES BASICALLY AND UH 
F FIELDING OFF SOME MORE SPAM AND 
OH 
THAT'S IT REALLY 
KEEPING THINGS IT WILL UH YOU KNOW UH HOPEFULLY UH KEEPING THINGS TOGETHER 
UM 
YEAH THAT'S 
THIS IS THIS IS UH GOOD 
SO WE KNOW FOR DEFINITE WE KNOW WE'VE WE'VE NOW GOT SOME DEFINITE THINGS GOING ON 
WE DEFINITELY KNOW HOW IT'S POWERED WE DEFINITELY KNOW THAT UM IT'S GONNA BE A SIMPLE BUTTONS 
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE GOING FOR THE NEW TECHNOLOGICAL CHIP ON PRINT EXPENSIVE THINGS SO WE'VE WE'RE KEEPING THE COSTS DOWN 
IT'S THIS RUBBER CASING THAT WE CAN SELL AS UM FUN AND FUNKY 
DON'T KNOW IF ANY OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE MADE OUT OF THIS STUFF 
PEOPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING OH STANDARD STUFF GIVES YOU REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
WELL THIS REMOTE CONTROL IS DESIGNED TO DO THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE 
IT'S SUPPOSED TO FIX IT RATHER THAN CAUSE IT 
UM 
YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA W WE'RE GONNA USE A SORT OF EXTRA SOMETHING ON IT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT EXTRA THINGS ARE THERE EXTRA THINGS THIS PRODUCT HAVE 
WE'LL LOOK INTO THIS LOCK KEY 
FACILITY ALTHOUGH WHETHER OR NOT IT HAPPENS OR IS POSSIBLE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO 
OKAY 
I THINK THAT'S UM WELL DONE EVERYBODY 
ANYONE HAVE ANY UH 
ANY QUESTIONS EVERYONE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL I'M SURE YOU'LL SOON GET AN E MAIL ABOUT IT 
OKAY 
RIGHT WELL 
IT'S UM WE'RE WE'VE STILL COUPLE OF MINUTES UNTIL OUR MEETING'S DUE TO FINISH 
BUT UM 
I GOT A NOTE SAYING THAT YOU TWO WHO ARE GONNA BE WORKING TOGETHER SO BEF BEFORE YOU ALL DISAPPEAR OFF JUST 
HOLD HOLD FOR 
UM 
UM I THINK IT'S UH YEAH I THINK IT'S GONNA BE PAR PART MORE OF A PROFIT SHARING ON THE PRODUCT 
YEAH I THINK I I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA HAPPEN AT THE MOMENT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I WANT A SHARE IN THE SPACE ROCKET 
DID YOU SEE THAT THIS K THAT THIS COMPANY WE'VE MADE A SPACESHIP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
AND THE SPACESHIP DOESN'T HAVE THE R. HAVE A MASSIVE R. AND R. DOWN THE SIDE OF IT BUT I STILL WANT ONE 
OKAY 
UM I'VE JUST HAD A SIGN FLASHING UP SAYING FINISH THE MEETING 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S NOT TELLING IT'S NOT SAYING DO ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR JUST YET 
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO YOUR OWN OFFICES 
YEAH 
YEAH IT SAYS YOU TWO 
HELLO 
YEAH 
THAT'S THE KIND OF SPAM THAT EVERYBODY LIKES TO RECEIVE 
HMM 
DO YOU HAVE ANY PREFERENCE UH OF ORDER 
I THINK SHE IS STILL FINISHING HER 
HMM 
OKAY IT'S UH 
SO IT LIKE A CRANK THING OR SOMETHING 
WELL THERE'S SOMETIMES COMBINATIONS I MEAN LIKE CALCULATORS DO COMBINATIONS OF BATTERY WITH BUT ALSO USING SOME SOLAR POWER 
UH I THINK IT HAS TO BE IN THE ON THE SOLAR ENERGY BUT I DON'T KNOW 
LET'S HAVE A SQUEEZABLE REMOTE 
IF IT'S RUBBER ISN'T IT MALLEABLE ANYWAY IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S DOUBLE I MEAN ISN'T A RUBBER CASE 
MEAN IT'S COMPLETELY FLEXED I MEAN IT IT FLEXES TO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO IT 
MINE IS WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NORMAL RUBBER CASE AND A RUBBLE DOUB DOUBLE RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED CASE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
GO RUBBER 
GO RUBBER THE WHOLE WAY 
I THINK PUSH BUTTONS SO 
YEAH 
THE THE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION UM OPTION IS IT DOESN'T SEEM REALLY VERY PROMISING FOR US UH 'CAUSE UH 
THE YEAH THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY'RE ALREADY USING IT FOR US WITH THE COFFEE MACHINE WHERE BASICALLY YOU CAN PROGRAM A SIMPLE WE UM 
THAT WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING IT WILL GIVE A RESPONSE AND YOU PROGRAM THE RESPONSE AS WELL 
JUST UH CLIPS OF THE THAT YOU RECORD YOURSELF 
SO YOU CAN PROGRAM YOUR COFFEE MAKER THAT WHEN YOU SAY GOOD MORNING TO TO IT SAYS HELLO RICK OR WHATEVER 
BUT I MEAN IT'S NOT IT WOULD BE ONE THING IF IT WAS SPEECH RECOGNITION WHERE YOU SAY SOMETHING AND IT TURNS THE T. V. IN LIKE 
TURN THE T. V. ON AND I TURNS COMES IN BUT IT'S NOT THAT 
IT JUST GIVES YOU A IT JUST GIVES YOU A VERBAL RESPONSE 
SO YEAH I MEAN LIKE WHAT'S THE POINT OF SAYING HELLO REMOTE I MEAN HELLO HOW HOW ARE YOU 
YEAH IF YOU'RE REALLY LONELY IT SO IT'S 
NO THA THAT WE THAT WE THAT WOULD BE MORE PROMISING 
IT IT'S JUST A REMOTE THAT TALKS TO YOU 
OH 
I MEAN TO CERTAIN CUES 
'KAY 
YEAH I'M FINE WITH THE BASIC BATTERY 
HMM 
YEAH SO WE WANT TO RUB RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED 
SO RUBBER RUBBER KEYS YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE'RE GIVING THEM A WAY TO BURN OFF STEAM BASICALLY YEAH 
NOT THAT WATCHING T. V. SHOULD BE THAT STRESSFUL 
OH YEAH I GUESS T. V. CAN BE STRESSFUL YEAH IF YOU'RE WATCHING SPORTS 
ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH SOME OF WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TIES INTO WHAT CATHERINE WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT 
OKAY SO I'M CONTINUING WITH THE USER INTERFACE UH TOPIC 
AND SO BASICALLY I CONSULTED WITH OUR MANUFACTURING DIVISION 
IT SOUNDED LIKE CATHERINE WAS ALSO SPEAKING WITH THEM 
UH I ALSO TAKE UH REISSA'S MARKETING FINDINGS FROM THE LAST MEETING INTO CONSIDERATION UM 
'CAUSE I THINK THAT'S THAT'S CRUCIAL AS FAR AS UH WHAT KEYS WE'RE GOING TO INC INCLU WHAT BUTTONS WE ARE GOING TO INCLUDE AND AND HOW THEY'RE LAID OUT 
UH AND SO THE MANUFACTURING DIVISION UH SENT SOME SOME SAMPLES OF OF UH INTERFACE COMPONENTS THAT WE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT HAVE BEEN USED IN THEIR PRODUCTS 
UH LIKE THE COFFEE MACHINE 
SO I ALREADY MENTIONED THE SPEECH RECOGNITION INTERFACE 
I GUESS WE WE BASICALLY VETOED THAT IDEA 
IT'S IT'S POINTLESS 
UH IT'S JUST A SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE OUTPUT 
IT WOULD JUST BE PROBABLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART OF OUR REMOTE WITHOUT ANY ACTUAL INTERESTING FUNCTIONALITY AS FAR AS OPERATING THE T. V. 
UH SO YEAH 
THEY THEY ALSO GIVE THE UH THEY THEY SUGGESTED THE IDEA OF USING A SPINNING WHEEL LIKE YOU SEE IN THE SIDE OF AN M. P. THREE PLAYER LIKE IPOD 
UM SO WE'VE ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT AND I THINK THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE WORSE FOR SOMETHING LIKE R. S. I. I MEAN YOU GET THAT THUMB MOVEMENT THAT YOU'RE CONSTANTLY DOING 
UM THE OTHER SUGGESTION AND I I HAVE A FEELING THAT 
WE'RE INTERESTED IN IN SOMETHING MORE GENERAL BUT THEY SUGGESTED UH YOU KNOW GOING I A LITTLE BIT INTO A A NICHE 
LIKE EITHER GEARING OUR REMOTE TOWARDS KIDS WHERE YOU COULD HAVE LOT OF COLOURS UM 
THE KEYS MIGHT BE YOU KNOW FUNNY OR OR OR UH SOMETHING FOR THE ELDERLY 
WHERE THE REMOTE'S VERY LARGE AND THE BUTTONS ARE VERY LARGE AND THERE'S ONLY A FEW BUTTONS 
BUT YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN DISCUSS THIS BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE FROM OUR LAST MEETING WE REALLY WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS GENERAL BUT DONE WELL 
UH UM 
SO THE KEY LAYOUT AND DESIGN ARE REALLY CRUCIAL 
YOU DON'T WANT UH YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO QUICKLY ACCESS THE BUTTONS THAT THEY USE A LOT WITHOUT UH ALWAYS PRESSING THE WRONG ONE UM 
AND I DIDN'T MENTION THAT WE NEED A POWER BUTTON ON OUR LAST I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE HERE OF UH GOOD LAYOUT AND BAD LAYOUT 
OH 
FROM OUR MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT 
SO THIS WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF BAD LAYOUT 
WHERE YOU HAVE VOLUME UP AND VOLUME DOWN BUT THEY HAVE A V. ON BOTH OF THEM IS UH 
IT'S SORT OF CONFUSING FOR THE USER 
UH THIS IS THE EXAMPLE OF THE GIANT REMOTE THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE 
AND FOR SOMETHING FOR KIDS 
YEAH 
UM 
AND SO 
YEAH I TH I THINK MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES OF WE'VE ALL KIND OF TALKED ABOUT AND SEEMED TO BE IN THE SAME PAGE UM 
UH SO I WAS AGAINST THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND AGAINST GOING UH TOWARDS ANYTHING IN IN A NICHE SENSE 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE MORE GENERAL 
I DIDN'T I DIDN'T THINK THE SPINNING WHEEL OR THE UH L. C. DISPLAY WERE WERE CRUCIAL FOR US 
AND YEAH THAT'S IT FOR ME 
SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY SORT OF DISPLAY I THINK UH 
SO YEAH IT'S JUST GONNA BE JUST GONNA BE PUSH BUTTONS 
UM 
I THINK WE SHALL HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF BUTTONS IDEALLY I MEAN A A POWER 
CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN AND A NUMERICAL KEYPAD 
OH 
AND SOME SORT OF IT WILL EITHER HAVE A A LOCK BUTTON LIKE WE MENTIONED OR OR A COVER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I GUESS IT'S AT THE POINT WHERE WE NEED TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT 
WELL NOW THAT WE'VE DECIDED ON OR 
UM IT SEEMS LIKE WE WOULDN'T WANNA MAKE IT TOO BUSY AND IT SORT OF GAUDY BUT UM 
YEAH I WOULD SAY MAYB MAYBE A COUPLE OF COLOURS LIKE UH LIKE A BLACK WITH WITH YELLOW AND SOMEWHERE 
LIKE MAYBE THE R. R. CAN BE YELLOW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I I GUESS THE FACT UH ALSO THAT WE ARE HAVING A RUBBER CASE UH WOULD PREVENT US FROM HAVING THE COVER FUNCTION THAT WE THOUGHT OF BEFORE 
I MEAN 'CAUSE UH SO SO IF WE WANNA HAVE A LACK OF SOME SORT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A BUTTON 
BUT I THINK THAT SHOULD BE I MEAN UM I CAN SPEAK WITH THE BUTTON DEPARTMENT 
BUT UH I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO HAVE A BUTTON THAT JUST PREVENTS PREVENTS THE OTHER UH THE OTHER BUTTONS FROM OPERATING 
SO THAT SHOULD BE SIMPLE 
MM 
YEAH 
WELL IT SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE MAYBE CUTTING EDGE IN SOME SENSE I MEAN HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S LITTLE MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THAN WHAT'S ON THE MARKET 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ACTUALLY I MEAN THIS FIRST TWO POINTS WE'VE ALREADY SORT OF GONE AWAY FROM 
'CAUSE OR RUBBER ONE IS NOT FANCY I MEAN IT'S DIFFERENT BUT I WOULDN'T SAY LIKE A RUBBER REMOTE IS FANCY 
IF THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT THEN WE MAYBE WE'RE GOING ON THE WRONG DIRECTION 
AND IT'S IT'S NOT TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE EITHER 
MM 
SO SO SO THE ADVANTAGE OF BLUETOOTH THAT YOU CAN JUST LIKE SYNCHRONISE IT WITH THREE 
ELECTRONICS 
YEAH THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT IT ALLOWS YOU TO DO RIGHT 
YEAH THA THAT WOULDN'T BE THE REMOTE AS MUCH I MEAN 
MM 
YES SO CAN 
YEAH WE CAN MAKE THE SQUEEZING OF THE RUBBER BE THE B THE GENERATING LIKE THE ENERGY GENERATOR 
WE'RE ALL ABOUT THAT 
OKAY SO WE COULD HAVE KEYS THAT ARE LIKE A B LIKE A BROCCOLI KEY AND A UH AND AN AVOCADO KEY ON THEM 
YEAH THAT'S GREAT FOR US 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S GREAT 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW HOW WE INCORPORATE 
WE DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW EVERY TREND I GUESS 
UH-HUH 
THE POWER BUTTON COULD BE LIKE A BIG APPLE OR SOMETHING 
THEY DON THEY DON'T OWN ALL IMAGES OF APPLES 
OKAY WE'LL MAKE IT A UH POMEGRANATE A BIG POMEGRANATE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
SURE 
THE ONE THING I'M WONDERING ABOUT 
I HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING LIKE TOO MUCH DOWN A GIMMICKY ROAD OF OF HAVING I MEAN IF SOMEBODY GO GOES INTO THE STORE THEY'RE GONNA USE LIKE THREE OR FOUR NORMAL REMOTES 
AND THEN A BIG SPONGY PINK T TOMATO UH REMOTE 
I MEAN WHAT ARE NINETY PER CENT OF PEOPLE GONNA TAKE 
MM 
YEAH I MEAN THAT THAT SEEMS TO WORK WELL WITH FOR PRODUCTS LIKE IPOD WHERE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF COLOURS 
THAT PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE CUSTOMISING IT WHEN THEY BUY IT EVEN YOU KNOW JUST JUST BY THE FACT OF CHOOSING 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OH RIGHT 
YEAH 
THAT SOUNDS GOOD 
RIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW 
OKAY 
OKAY I'LL STAY IN HERE 
DOES THE PAY RAISE IMMEDIATELY COME INTO EFFECT ON OUR NEXT PAY CHECK OR IS THAT 
SO WE'RE BUYING FUT I MEAN WE'RE GETTING FUTURES IN THE COMPANY 
SO WE REALLY HAVE A INCENTIVE TO MAKE THIS REMOTE WORK 
I'D LIKE TO SHARE IN THE COFFEE MACHINE PROFITS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY DOING WELL 
YEAH 
THIS COMPANY HAS ITS ITS FINGERS IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT POTS 
YEAH WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT IN THE MONEY MAKING DEPARTMENT 
WELL I I DID NOTICE LOOKING AT I MEAN 
THEY TOLD YOU THAT THEY WANTED WHATEV OUR PRODUCT TO REPRESENT THE THE R. R. BRAND AND AND TO BE IMMEDIATELY NOTICEABLE 
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK LOOK AT THE COFFEE MAKER AT THE AT THE CORPORATE WEB PAGE IT'S NOT OBVIOUS 
R. R. 
WELL IT IS IT IS BECAUSE WE WE WORKED WORKED HERE FOR YEARS AND WE USE THAT COFFEE MACHINE 
BUT IT'S DOESN'T HAVE THE COLOUR SCHEME OF OF THE OF THE COMPANY ANYWHERE IN IT OBVIOUSLY IT'S JUST SIL SILVER AND BLACK 
NO 
MM 
OKAY 
RIGHT WELL I GUESS THAT'S SO 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
IT'S PLAY DOH 
BECAUSE KIDS YEAH 
BUT UM IT'S IT'S MADE EDIBLE 'CAUSE YEAH 
IT'S MADE EDIBLE 'CAUSE KIDS EAT IT AND IF IT'S WASN'T EDIBLE THEN 
WELL NORMAL BABIES 
OH YEAH IT IS YEAH 
OH YEAH 
THAT IS COOL 
WHAT'S THE BIG BLUE THING 
OH COOL 
AND MUTE 
UH IT'S SO CUTE 
YEAH BUT THEN 
BUT THEN YOU CAN LEARN TO USE YOUR RIGHT UH LIKE I WAS JUST THINKING IF THERE'S LEFT HANDERS AND RIGHT HANDERS IN THE FAMILY WHAT THEY HAVE TWO REMOTES 
YEAH I'M SURE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO 
I MEAN IT'S ONLY PRESSING BUTTONS YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING YOU KNOW EXTRAORDINARY 
I THINK EVERYBODY CAN PRESS A BUTTON WITH THEIR LEFT AND RIGHT HAND SO 
YEAH IT'S NOT 
YEAH 
HAVE THEM IN STOCK 
MAKE 'EM MORE APPEALING AS WELL 
AND ALL THE PLAYING AROUND SO UH 
YEAH I'M JUST DO YOU WANNA PLUG IN 
OKAY 
MM 
PLAY DOH WON'T LAST VERY LONG EVERYBODY'LL GO LIKE OOPS IT'S AGAIN 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL THEY'LL BUY MORE OF THEM IF YOU TO THEM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S BETTER FOR 
AND SPECIAL MATERIAL 
WELL THEY'RE RUBBER AREN'T THEY 
WE'RE UNDER BUDGET 
IT'S ALREADY SAVED I THINK 
THANK YOU 
MM 
OH YEAH 
THIS IS WHERE WE ALL GET IT I GOT TO WRITE ON THE PAUSE IN THE BOARD 
RIGHT 
OH 
'S FUNCTION 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
SO EVALUATION 
WE'RE GONNA DO IT ALL TOGETHER SO WE EVALUATE EACH CRITERIA 
I'VE GOT THE CRITERIAS 
AND WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN ONE BEING TRUE 
SO IT'S IT'S MORE LIKE IT'S FITS THE CRITERIA AND SEVEN BEING SO ON IT DOESN'T FIT THE CRITERIA 
AND THE CRITERIAS ARE AND I'LL DRAW THIS UP ON THE BOARD SO WE HAVE A BOX 
AND THIS IS FALSE THIS IS JUST LIKE 
TO KEEP YOU INFORMED 
SO SEVEN'S HERE AND ONE'S HERE AND THEN YOU'VE GOT ON THE MIDDLE 
SO THE FIRST CRITERIA 
DO YOU ALL GET WHAT WE'RE DOING 
OKAY COOL 
OKAY FIRST CRITERIA LOOK AND FEEL 
SO THE IDEAS REMOTE LOOK AND FEEL FASHIONABLE TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT 
SO IT IS IT COLOUR WISE AND SO IT SPONGY 
SO WHAT MARK SHOULD WE GAVE FOR THAT 
SO NO IT'S NOT 
A IN A ONE 
SO I'LL JUST WRITE CRITERIA CRITERIA ONE WE GOT NO 
SECOND CRITERIA NEW TECHNOLOGY 
HAVE WE IMPLEMENTED NEW TECHNOLOGY 
SO ON THE NEW HIGH TECH 
SO IT'S 
SO WE'LL GIVE IT A 
YEAH 
I'D SAY IT'S ABOUT A A TWOISH 
TWO 
THERE 
THERE 
SO CRITERIA THERE IS IS IT EASY TO USE 
I THINK IT'S A ONE I THINK 
TWO SO IT'S 
BUT IF WE MAKE A RIGHT HANDED AND A LEFT HANDED THEN 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
'KAY CRITERIA FOR US COSTS 
'S GREAT 
YEAH 
LIKE THE AMOUNT OF BUTTONS 'CAUSE PEOPLE LIKE A LOT LE LIKE 
SO IT'S A ONE 
UM CRITERIA SIX 
R. S. A. IS IT GOOD AGAINST 
YES 
VERY GOOD 
IT'S ONE 
AND CRITERIA SEVEN WHICH IS THE LAST ONE DOES IT GET LOST 
SO IT EASY TO GET LOST 
NO 
BUT IT IS SMALLISH 
MM 
I THINK I IT WOULD COULD BE COULD GET LOST 
MM 
YEAH 
I MEAN IT'S NOT FULLY IT'S NOT FULLY LIKE YOU CAN'T SAY I MEAN IT'S NOT A ONE DEFINITELY 
YEAH 
THE MOBILES GET LOST ALL THE TIME 
BUT THEN YOU RING 'EM AND YOU FIND THEM 
SO 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S THAT 
SO THAT'S THE EVALUATION SO I'D SAY 
YAY 
IT'S LIKE LIKE A NUMBER ONE 
UM 
NUMBER ONE PRODUCT 
ALL DONE THANKS 
WE FITTED ALL THE CRITERIAS 
YEAH 
YEAH SO 
SO THAT'S THAT ONE 
BEEN COOL 
NO FOUR DIFF IN ONE FOR MEETINGS 
FUNNY ALL DESIGNER MEETINGS COULD BE THIS QUICK 
THEY'RE USING OUR IDEAS 
YEAH 
JUST START SUMMARISING NOW 
YOU CAN REPLY TO THE SAME MESSAGE 
SO SUMMARY THERE 
IF YOU JUST REPLY TO THAT ONE 
WAS IT WAS TO FIFTY OR FIVE 
DEPENDS HOW MUCH WE SELL 
WE FINISHED AN HOUR EARLIER 
MM 
MM 
DEFINITELY 
YEAH 
JUST DON'T SH DON'T THROW IT IT ANY OF THE ORNAMENTS AND BREAK THEM 
NO 
YAY 
YEP 
WE HAVEN'T GOT THE FIVE MINUTE LEFT THING YET 
MM MM 
NO PROJECT 
I LOVE IT 
I LOVE IT 
I THINK IT'S COOL 
BEING ALL WIRED UP AND A VIBRATING PEN AND IT'S COOL 
BEING WATCHED 
UM 
WOW 
MM 
LOGITECH 
YEAH 
MEETING ADJOURNED 
I SAID IT IT IT 
YEP 
WE'VE GOT A COOL PROTOTYPE 
DOUBLE CURVED 
WHICH IS ANT ANTI R. S. I. 
OH RIGHT YEAH 
YEAH 
I KNOW I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT HANDED AND RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE IN THE FAMILY AND THEY ALL USE THE COMPUTER FOR THE WHOLE THE SAME COMPUTER THE FES FAMILY AND THEY HAVE A MOUSE 
AND EVERYBODY IS USING RIGHT HANDED MOUSE 
IMAGINE D OR YOU RIGHT HANDED 
IMAGINE YOU'RE DOING IT WITH YOUR LEFT HAND I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO 
BUT WE CAN HAVE BOTH UH 
YEAH 
I THINK IT DOES 
YEAH 
THERE YOU GO 
PLAY DOH IS VERY CHEAP 
CHEW PROOF 
UH UH UH 
YEP 
RUBBER 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
A ONE 
WELL THE KINETIC THING YEAH 
WELL AS THE UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TRUE 
TWO 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES SO YEAH 
IT'S YELLOW 
TWO

DID YOU KNOW THAT 
IT'S DEFINITELY 
YEAH 
IT'S IT'S CHEW PROOF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
EVERYBODY EVERYBODY READY 
OKAY LET'S HAVE YOUR UM LET'S GET HAVE THE UH PRESENTATION 
NICE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WHAT BUTTON 
UM 
OH MUTE 
OKAY 
THAT CERTAINLY DOES 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
'S GREAT 
I HAVE ONE THING ABOUT IT BUT IT'S A SMALL THING BUT IT'D MEAN WE'D HAVE TO MAKE A RIGHT HANDED ONE AND A LEFT HANDED ONE 
BUT THAT'S I DON'T SEE WHY THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE 
YEAH 
THEY MAKE LEFT HANDED SCISSORS YOU KNOW 
YES SO 
MM 
SURE 
SURE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT UM OTHER THAN THAT I MEAN UH AND THAT'S UM YOU KNOW 
THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I THINK I THINK IT'S GREAT YEAH GREAT IDEA 
I THINK IT'S WELL IF THE R. R. MOTTO IS WE BRING FASHION TO TO ELECTRONICS I'D SAY THAT COULD BE QUITE FASHIONABLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH VERY GOOD YEAH 
IT'S COME UP WITH WHAT WE'VE YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT'S WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT DOING HASN'T IT ALL SEEMS TO BE THERE 
WELL DONE 
UM BEFORE WE MOVE ON 
I NEED THAT CABLE 
THANK YOU 
YEAH 
UM 
ONE THING I DO NEED TO DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT IS THE COSTS 
WELL YEAH 
UM 
YEAH 
OH RIGHT 
OKAY NOW I THINK WE'LL DO THIS I COULD DO YOU KNOW I CAN DO THIS O ON MY OWN OR I COULD DO IT WITH YOU 
BUT IT'S JUST EASY ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH IT WITH YOU SO WE'RE GOING FOR THE KINETIC POWER 
AND THE ELECTRONICS WE DECIDED ON IT BEING JUST A SIMPLE THE EASIEST 
THING THAT'S INSIDE IT 
OH 
SO THE CASE WE'VE GONE FOR THE DOUBLE CURVED 
UM 
AND IT'S MADE OUT OF RUBBER 
THE INTERFACE IS PUSH BUTTONS 
AND BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS WELL THEY'RE IN DIFF SPECIAL COLOURS AREN'T THEY 
SO SPECIAL COLOURS 
SPECIAL FORM YEAH THEY'RE A SPECIAL FORM THERE IN SHOPS AND STUFF 
YEP 
YEAH 
UM 
ARE THEY MADE OUT OF ANY SPECIAL MATERIAL 
NO THEY'RE NOT 
THEY'RE NOT MADE OUT OF WOOD OR TITANIUM OR RUBBER OR ANYTHING THEY'RE JUST SIMPLE 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
SO LET'S SEE IF THAT COMES WITHIN BUDGET 
AND IT DOES 
THAT IS GONNA COST UH YEAH 
THAT'S GONNA COST TEN TEN EURO SEVENTY CENTS A NOT TO MAKE 
AND OUR TARGET WAS IT HAD TO COME ON IT UNDER TWELVE FIFTY 
SO 
THIS IS ALL VERY VERY GOOD 
THE BOSSES WILL BE VERY PLEASED 
OKAY LET'S JUST SAVE THIS IS I CAN E MAIL TO TO YOU 
OH 
SAVE IT IN SAVE IT IN THE UH MY DOCUMENTS 
SPLENDID 
OKAY 
SO UH THAT'S DONE WITH THIS WITH THIS UM DOODAH SO YOU'RE 
GONNA DO WHAT YOU WERE GONNA DO 
YOUR EVALUATION 
F. EIGHT 
I LOVE THE SMELL OF THAT PLAY DOH 
I C 
I WOULD GIVE IT A SEVEN 
OH SORRY AN IDEA YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGICAL THING THAT'S ANOTHER THING I THAT'S ANOTHER MARKETING THING 
SO ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF IT IT 
EASY TO USE 
I'D SAY IT'S I WOULDN'T NOT IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED IT'S NOT 
I WOULD GIVE IT A I WOULD GIVE IT A TWO 
'CAUSE I I IT I IT I IT IS MORE GEARED FOR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE THAN LEFT HANDED PEOPLE BUT 
YEAH 
GIVE IT A TO GIVE IT A TWO 
COST 
IT'S COME IN UNDER BUDGET 
SO THAT'S A DEFINITE ONE 
AMOUNT OF BUTTONS 
CONTAINS ONLY THE NECESSARY BUTTONS 
YEAH 
SO IT'S NOT R. S. I. 
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA GET LOST EASILY 
TWO 
I MEAN IT 
NO I MEAN 
I MEAN YOU COULD STILL FLUSH IT DOWN THE TOILET THEORETICALLY BUT 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT IT'S ALL ALL SYSTEMS GO 
WE CAN'T FAIL 
WELL DONE REISSA 
OKAY I I THINK UM I JUST WANNA PUT IN AS PROJECT MANAGER THE YOU KNOW 
LITTLE BIT OF PRAISE FOR EVERYBODY HERE FOR HOW THEY'VE WORKED ON IT YOU KNOW BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A TIME 
YOU KNOW YOU'VE W EVERYONE'S COME UP WITH THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL IDEAS ON THEIR OWN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS UM AND THEN COME TOGETHER AND WORKED ON 
YOU KNOW INTEGRALLY YOU KNOW AT THE RIGHT TIMES PSP YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY YOU TWO 
THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW GONE VERY VERY WELL AND AND AND BE YOU KNOW HAS BEEN GOOD COMMUNICATION GOING ON 
DID YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE THE CORPORATE SQUASH COURT AND BASH A FEW BALLS ABOUT 
FANTASTIC 
I THINK SO I I YOU KNOW AND I THINK WE'VE C WE HAVE COME WE'VE COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW 
SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE WE HAVEN'T WE'RE NOT JUST REHASHING AN OLD DESIGN 
YEAH 
YOU KNOW MAYBE THIS ISN'T A SIMULATION MAYBE THIS IS ACTUALLY SO IT'S LIKE SONY OR SOMEONE LIKE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST YEAH THEY GET 
YEAH 
YEAH TWO YEARS' TIME THIS WILL BE IN THE MARKET 
EX EXACTLY THAT PRODUCT UM THUM WE'LL GO YEAH WE DESIGNED THAT AND ONE ONE WILL BELIEVE SO 
BUT UM 
NO I THINK WHEN THIS MEETING'S FINISHED LIKE OFFICIALLY THERE BE WE'LL GET A UH QUESTIONNAIRE TO FILL IN 
OR SIX UH 
I HAVEN'T GOT MESSAGE 
IT GETS HANDED OVER TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT 
WHAT ARE WHAT OUR PROJECT WAS WAS TO COME UP WITH THE PRODUCT BASICALLY 
THE FOR THE AND JUST BASICALLY IS IT TO COME CAN USE IT WITHIN BUDGET 
WHEN IT C WHEN IT COMES AT ALL THE OTHER THINGS OF HOW TO SELL IT AND YOU KNOW 
THE B THE PROFITS AND ALL THAT THAT'S OTHER DEPARTMENTS IT'S ANOTHER TEAM THAT ACTUALLY WORK AT THE UM THE UH YEAH 
THE ALL THE GUYS IN THE PROFIT SHARING YEAH 
UM 
YEAH THAT'S IT 
YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE MADE I WE'VE MADE WE'VE DESIGNED THE PRODUCT WE'VE UM WE'VE GOT THE PROTOTYPE 
IT'S WITHIN BUDGET IT'S DOES EVERYTHING THAT WE WANTED TO TO DO 
IT'S NOW IT'S IT'S UM 
SOMETHING THAT UH THAT ISN'T IT THERE ALREADY 
YEAH 
WELL THIS IS VERY MARKETABLE IN THAT IT SO IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF NEW AND LOOKS A BIT QUIRKY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT THAT 
IT'S THAT IT'S UM HANG ON I WROTE IT DOWN HERE SOMEWHERE 
OH NO I TH I PUT IT IN ONE OF MY E MAILS THAT I SENT OFF 
UM THAT YOU KNOW IT'S MARKETABLE IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S WHILST ALL THESE OTHER REMOTES UH ACTUALLY DO GIVE YOU REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
OR ONE DOES THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE YOU KNOW SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOW 
WHICH IS ONE OF THE CRITERIA THEY ASKED US TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING WITH SOMETHING NEW 
YEAH AND IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH THE T. V. YOU CAN F THROW IT BUT YOU KNOW 
IT'S FINE IT'S KID PROOF 
WELL YOU CAN BREAK THE ORNAMENTS BUT YOU WON'T BREAK THAT 
YEAH 
SO ALL IN ALL I THINK WE'VE DONE VERY WELL 
WELL DONE EVERYBODY 
UM 
DRINKS ARE IN THE COMPANY 
IN THE CORPORATE BAR THAT'S NEXT TO THE CORPORATE SWIMMING POOL ON THE TOP FLOOR THAT WE'RE THAT'VE ALL JUST GAINED ACCESS IT 
YEAH 
THAT'S IT 
WELL AS FAR AS I IT AS FAR AS I KNOW 
UM 
NO 
ANYONE WANNA PLAY I SPY 
YEAH I GUESS 
I MEAN WE'RE GONNA GET ASKED TO FILL OUT ANOTHER QUESTIONNAIRE 
UM 
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE THE SAME AS ONE WE'VE DONE BEFORE 
BUT I'M NOT THE AUTHORITY TO SAY THAT IT IS 
UM HOW DOES EVERYONE FEEL ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEEN USED IN THIS 
THE SORT OF USING OF THE THE PENS AND WRITING ON THIS SPECIAL PADS AND ALL THAT 
YEAH 
I TH YOU KNOW I'D I'D N YEAH SO WE SAID EARLIER I'VE NOT NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE 
SOMETHING THAT AT THE WHITEBOARD 
THINGY THAT'S GREAT 
UM BUT A P A PEN WITH A CAMERA ON IT I DON'T THINK IT'S SUCH A NEW THING 
I MEAN IT'S I ARE IN SUCH A NEW IDEA 
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF IT WAS SORT OF HAND WRITING RECOGNITION STUFF 
BUT SO IT'S NOT IT'S LITERALLY THAT'LL COME UP IN A COMPUTER SCREEN IS A PICTURE FILE RATHER THAN ACTUAL TEXT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
I'VE I'VE DEFINITELY EATEN IT BEFORE 
I DIDN'T KNOW WAS EDIBLE 
ACTUALLY THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I REMEMBER LIKE 
PEOPLE I DUNNO IF MY MOM EVER DID IT BUT I REMEMBER OTHER PEOPLE'S MOMS MAKING LIKE HOME MADE PLAY DOH WHERE YOU JUST LIKE MAKE THE COLOURING AND MAKE SOME SORT OF SORT OF DOUGH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WE'VE GOT SOME 
YEAH IT'S PRETTY EXCITING 
SO 
EVERYTHING UH THAT WE WANTED WE WANTED TO TO BE ERGONOMIC AND TO BE MADE OUT OF RUBBER VERY SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE YEAH 
DOUBLE CURVED UM BUT ALSO SOMETHING THAT WAS GONNA JUMP TO TO PEOPLE 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT UH SEPARATE IT FROM THE OTHER REMOTES OUT ON THE MARKET 
SO UH I THINK IF YOU PUT THIS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND YOU'LL SEE WHAT A NICE THING WE HAVE GOING HERE 
SO BASICALLY 
IF YOU HOLD IT LIKE THAT THE IN IN YOUR THUMB YEAH THE THUMB BUTTON IS THE POWER BUTTON 
YOUR INDEX FINGER IS CHANNEL UP MIDDLE FINGER IS CHANNEL DOWN RING FINGER IS VOLUME UP YOUR PINKIE IS VOLUME DOWN 
THAT'S THE LOCK BUTTON HAS A L. L. ON IT AND THEN THE M. IS A MUTE BUTTON 
AND THEN IT ALSO HAS DIGIT 
FOR MUTING THE UH 
UM AND THEN THEN YOU CAN ALSO THERE'S A NUMERIC KEYPAD ON THE TOP SO YOU CAN KEY DIRECTLY AT THE AT THE CHANNEL IF YOU WANT 
SO IT'S REALLY BASIC FUNCTIONALITIES AS FAR AS WHAT KEYS ARE AVAILABLE BUT WE THINK IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE AND VERY INNOVATIVE AND IT LOOKS DIFFERENT 
SO ALL THE I MEAN THE IMPORTANT KEYS ARE RIGHT AT YOUR IF IF YOU KNOW RIGHT TO UH IT A CONVENIENT PLACE FOR YOU TO TO ACCESS THEM 
SO YOU DON'T YOU 
YEAH 
IT SHOULD BE 
AND IT'S ALSO CONFORMABLE TO THE SIZE OF YOUR HAND 
I MEAN IF THAT'S TOO BIG IT'S A RUBBER REMOTE SO YOU CAN YOU KNOW 
CHANGE THAT 
SO D DOES THAT UH WHAT MESH WITH WHAT YOU GUYS WERE HOPING AND FOR AND EXPECTING OR DOES IT 
OH THAT'S GOOD THINKING YEAH 
YEAH IF WE BUILD ROCKET SHIPS WHY CAN'T WE BUILD LEFT HANDED AND RIGHT HANDED UH REMOTES 
YEAH I DIDN'T I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I'D YEAH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
DO YOU THINK IT SAYS R. R. 
FASHION TO ELECTRONICS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND IT'S GOT THE B THE BLACK AND YELLOW AND BLUE 
PLUS RED WHICH IS SORT OF A A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE UH UH 
SO THAT'S THAT'S OUR END OF THINGS WHO UH 
THAT'S 
YEAH 
THE COSTS WAS THAT WHAT YOU SAID 
BUT IT'S DOABLE 
THAT WAS THE MAIN CRITERIA FROM THE LAST MEETING IT HAD TO BE CHEW PROOF 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN THESE THESE ONES ON THE SIDE OR CURVED KIND OF US 
THE BUTTONS OR RUBBER 
THAT'S COOL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND WE'RE ACTUA ACTUALLY MAKING A BETTER PROFIT THEN WE EXPECTED 
YEAH HAVE SOME HAVE SOME 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OH SORRY ONE 
YEAH 
THAT WAS OUR MAIN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION W EVERY EVERYTHING ELSE WAS FAIRLY SIMPLE BUT THE FACT THAT WE SAID THE KINETIC ENERGY WAS NOW 
IT'S ERGONOMIC BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S THAT'S A DESIGN THAT'S A DES THAT'S A DESIGN THING YEAH 
IT'S ABOUT IN THE MID IN THE MIDDLE SOMEWHERE MAYBE YEAH I DUNNO 
MAYBE THERE YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE ONE LEFT HANDED AND ONE RIGHT HANDED THEN I WOULD GIVE IT A ONE BUT OTHERWISE OTHERWISE A TWO 
YEAH 
THAT WAS GREAT 
YEAH 
IT IS VERY BRIGHT YEAH 
IT'S NOT THE KINDA THING THAT'S GONNA SLIP LIKE BETWEEN A COUCH CUSHION OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW 
MAYBE IT WILL 
OH 
YOU THINK IT COULD LOST 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH ANYTHING I MEAN 
OKAY 
IT'S BIGGER THAN THE AVERAGE MOBILE I GUESS 
BUT YEAH IT CAN GET LOST 
YEAH 
OKAY YEAH TWO IS FINE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH DURING OUR DESIGN I MEAN THERE WAS SOME S SOME HEATED HEATED DISCUSSION ABOUT WE WE KEPT WE TRIED TO KEEP IT COOL AND AND 
JUST JUST 
WE JUST HAD TO WE JUST HAD TO SQUEEZE OUR PRODUCT A LITTLE BIT AND 
NOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN A A GREAT TEAM 
THINK WE'RE THE WE'RE THE ENVY OF ALL THE OF ALL THE OTHER R. R. TEAMS 
YEAH I THINK THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO FIND IDEAS FOR A IDEAL REMOTE 
SO AT THIS STAGE I MEAN IS THIS THE LAST MEETING OF THE PROJECT 
WE DON'T UH HAVE ANOTHER ONE AFTER IT'S GONE GONE TO MARKE MARKET OR SOMETHING 
SO THERE'S NO WAY TO LIKE PREDICT WHAT ARE 'CAUSE WE HAD A WE ORIGINALLY HAD A 
SO FAR AS OUR FINANCIAL UH UM GOALS WE HAD A SPECIFIC NUMBER FOR PROFITS THAT WE WANTED 
IT WAS FIFTY MIL FIFTY MILLION 
I DON'T REMEMBER 
BUT THERE'S NOT A WAY TO COMPUTE THAT I MEAN SINCE WE SAVED ON THE ON THE PRODUCTION COST 
DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE MAKING AN PROFIT 
OH 
HMM 
BUT WE HAVE A VESTED INTEREST PROF PROFIT SHARING 
I THINK ACTUALLY NEED AN ADVANTAGE OF OF THIS IS THAT AFTER THE UH YOU KNOW 
AFTER THIS FAD OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES PASSES THIS WILL STILL BE C A COOL REMOTE YOU KNOW 
WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW TYING TYING OUR CART TO THAT ONE HORSE 
MM 
MM 
MM 
TO MAKE WATCHING T. V. HEALTHY 
OH 
RIGHT YOU IT 
MM 
THAT'S IT 
I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY BETTER THAT WE WRAP IT UP THEN HAVE FIVE MINUTES OF 
SILENCE 
SHOULD WE CALL THE DAY THEN 
OH RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YOUR MOMENT TO SHINE 
RIGHT I THINK THEY DO WANT TO DO HAND WRITING RECOGNITION IN THAT IT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP 
I GUESS WE SHOULD AND THIS SINCE WE'RE OFF OFF TOPIC 
SO 
SHALL WE 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY 
UM I'M GLAD YOU COULD ALL COME 
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO START THIS TIME 
UM I'M JUST GONNA HAVE A LITTLE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION FOR US FOR OUR KICK OFF MEETING 
MY NAME IS ROSE LINDGREN 
I I'LL BE THE PROJECT MANAGER 
UM OUR AGENDA TODAY IS WE ARE GONNA DO A LITTLE OPENING AND THEN I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROJECT 
THEN WE'LL MOVE INTO ACQUAINTANCE SUCH AS GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT INCLUDING A TOOL TRAINING EXERCISE 
AND THEN WE'LL MOVE INTO THE PROJECT PLAN DO A LITTLE DISCUSSION AND CLOSE SINCE WE ONLY HAVE TWENTY FIVE MINUTES 
FIRST OF ALL OUR PROJECT UM 
UM WE ARE CREATING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL WHICH WE HAVE THREE GOALS ABOUT IT NEEDS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY 
I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE ALL THREE OF THIS 
UM SO WE'RE GONNA DIVIDE US UP INTO THREE COMPA THREE PARTS 
FIRST THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN WHICH WILL BE UH FIRST WE'LL DO INDIVIDUAL WORK COME INTO A MEETING THE CONCEPTIONAL DESIGN 
INDIVIDUAL WORK AND A MEETING AND THEN THE DETAILED DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK AND A MEETING 
SO THAT WE'LL EACH BE DOING OUR OWN IDEAS AND THEN COMING TOGETHER AND UM COLLABORATING 
OKAY WE'RE GONNA GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT 
SO UM WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS START OFF WITH UM LET'S START OFF WITH AMINA 
UM ALIMA SORRY ALIMA 
UM WE'RE GONNA DO A LITTLE TOOL TRAINING SO WE ARE GONNA WORK WITH THAT WHITEBOARD BEHIND YOU 
UM INTRODUCE YOURSELF UM SAY ONE THING ABOUT YOURSELF AND THEN DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND TELL US BUT IT 
PROBABLY BOTH 
HOW DO YOU SPELL YOUR NAME 
THANKS 
SO WHAT ARE YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS 
MM 
EXCELLENT 
SHALL WE JUST GO AROUND THE TABLE 
MM 
MIGHT BE NICE TO HAVE THEM ALL UP THERE AT SOME TIME 
UM 
MM 'KAY 
MM 'KAY 
I'M ROSE AND I'M PROJECT MANAGER FROM CALIFORNIA 
UM 
HMM 
SO 
UM IT'S ACTUALLY A COYOTE 
LET'S SEE 
LET'S SEE LET'S GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A SNOUT I DON'T KNOW SOME TEETH 
YEAH 
OH DEAR 
YES 
I LOVE UM I LIVE RIGHT ACROSS THE START FROM AN OPEN SPACE IN CALIFORNIA 
WE HAVE COYOTES HOWL ALL THE TIME 
SO I REALLY ENJOY THEIR THEIR SINGING YOU THEY'RE REALLY BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS 
MM 
OKAY UM MOVING ON IT 
SLIGHTLY MORE SERIOUS STUFF 
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT PROJECT FINANCES 
UM WE HAVE A COUPLE WE'D LIKE TO SELL IT FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE EURO WITH THE PROFIT AIM OF UM FIFTEEN MILLION EURO UM FROM OUR SALES AND BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH THIS IS FOR TELEVISION IT'S A WE HAVE A MARKET RANGE OF INTERNET 
LIKE IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET RANGE WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SPECIFICS 
UM IN ORDER TO MAKE A PROFIT OF THIS MAGNITUDE WE NEED TO UM BE ABLE TO PRODUCE EACH ONE TO A MAXIMUM OF TWELVE FIFTY EURO 
SO WE'RE SELLING IT FOR TWICE WHAT WE'D LIKE TO PRODUCE IT FOR 
OKAY UM JUST TO GENERATE A LITTLE BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PROJECT UM I COULD I'D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES USING OUR REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM YOUR FIRST IDEAS ABOUT UM CREATING A NEW R REMOTE CONTROL 
WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST UM LIKE YOU WHAT ARE THE FEATURES THAT YOU REALLY LIKE WHAT ARE THE FEATURES THAT YOU DON'T LIKE ETCETERA SO 
HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
UM I WOULD IMAGINE ALL OF THEM 
BUT WE COULD BUT IT'S POSSIBLE WE COULD USE LIKE A LITHIUM BATTERY UM THAT WOULD LOST A LOT LONGER THAN LIKE DOUBLE A. S 
UM LIKE THE THESE ARE THE BATTERIES THAT ARE USED IN A LOT OF UM M. P. THREE PLAYERS NOW AND THAT KIND OF THING 
UM 
UM 
OKAY IT SEEMS WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CONFLICT OVER UM TO UH COMBINING ALL THE REMOTES CONT TOGETHER VERSUS HAVING F FIVE DIFFERENT REMOTES 
SO UM LIKE YOU SAID YOU DON'T LIKE HAVING ALL THE BUTTONS IN IN IN ONE REMOTE AND YET YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE FIVE REMOTES 
SO HOW DO WE WORK WITH THAT 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
OKAY SO MAYBE HAVE LIKE ONE REMOTE THAT HAS THE MAIN FUNCTIONS ON OFF 
CHANNEL CHANGING VOLUME AND ANOTHER ROTE REMOTE WITH ALL THE SPECIAL THINGS 
BECAUSE THAT IS ONE THING THAT UM REMOTES TEND TO HAVE BUTTONS THAT THE T. V. S NO LONGER HAVE AS WELL 
SO LIKE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM SOMEWHERE 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA UM AND THOSE SPECIAL FUNCTIONS OCCASIONALLY 
UM BUT NOT NECESSARILY ON THE UM THE NORMAL REMOTE 
GOOD QUESTION 
I DON'T KNOW THAT YET 
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION 
UM 
I'LL LOOK INTO THAT 
IF I CAN 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
'KAY SOUNDS LIKE WE'VE HAD A GOOD LITTLE DISCUSSION FOR OUR FIRST IDEAS 
MIND IF WE MOVE ON 
PS MM OKAY 
UM NOW OUR NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES 
I BELIEVE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ONLY WORKING ON THIS THIS ONE FOR ABOUT TWENTY SO WE CAN CONTINUE DISCUSSING MORE NEW IDEAS OF YOU'D LIKE UM 
BUT THIS IS JUST A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT WE'LL BE DOING INDIVIDUALLY 
UM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN ALIMA WILL BE DOING UM THE WORKING DESIGN 
UM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER THAT'S FOR 
TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS I GUESS LIKE KEEPING IN MIND THE BUTTONS THING THE SIZE OF THE BUTTONS 
UM USER REQUIREMENTS UM SO YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT DIFFERENT TRENDS UH ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PEOPLE AND 
UM I GUESS KIND OF THE SAME UH DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING WE'LL GET FROM THE ACTUAL CONSUM S CONSUMERS 
MM 'KAY UM 
AND YOU WILL GET SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS SENT BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH 
I REALISED IN THIS PAST ONE WE WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH WE JUST WANTED TO GET A LITTLE BRAIN STORMING DONE 
UM IS VERY EXITED TO USE ALL YOUR ANIMALS AND HOW WHAT WONDERFUL UM ARTISTS WE ALL OUR UM 
ANY QUESTIONS 
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AN AGENDA YET UM I'LL PUT THAT TOGETHER 
I'M SURE SO WE'LL EACH GET OUR OWN INSTRUCTION AND THEN UM BECAUSE WHAT WE GONNA DO SO FIRST OUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TOGETHER 
SO I'M SURE WE'LL ALL HAVE MORE CONCRETE THINGS TO CONTRIBUTE NEXT TIME 
MM 'KAY UM I'LL TYPE UP MI MINUTES AND PROBABLY EMAIL THIS AT AT ALL OF YOU 
UM JUST INCLUDING ALL THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT 
UM 
YES I YES I THINK I CAN 
MM-HMM 
I'LL JUST ATTACH TO TO AN EMAIL 
AND YOU'RE YOU'RE NUMBER TWO THREE FOUR 
SO THAT CORRECT 
OKAY 
EXCELLENT 
IT WAS LOVELY MEETING YOU ALL 
JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP CHECKING THE COMPANY WEB SITE AND THE EMAILS 
LET ME SEE IF I CAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW 
ALIMA 
OKAY 
UM I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF THIS I HAVE TO BRING WITH UM 
RIGHT SO I'M SUPPOSED TO DRAW MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
I HAVE ONE DRAWING SKILLS WHATSOEVER 
BUT UH LET'S SEE INTRODUCE MYSELF 
MY NAME IS ALIMA BUCCIANTINI 
UM I'M FROM THE STATE OF MENU ON THE S 
I'M DOING NATIONALISM STUDIES 
BLAH BLAH BLAH AND I HAVE AN ARTISTIC TALENTS 
A. L. E. M. A. 
UH AND I GUESS I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER IN THIS PROJECT 
SO LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET UM HERE 
I WILL DRAW A LITTLE TURTLE FOR YOU ALL 
NOT NECESSARILY 'CAUSE IT'S MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE ANIMAL BUT JUST THAT I THINK THEY'RE DRAWABLE 
AND YOU HAVE THE PRETTY LITTLE SHELL GOING ON 
SOME LITTLE EYES 
HAPPY 
THERE YOU GO 
THAT'S A TURTLE 
UM 
I I LIKE THE WHOLE HAVING A SHELL THING 
IT'S QUITE COOL CARRY YOUR HOME AROUND WHERE YOU GO UM QUITE DECORATIVE LITTLE ANIMALS THEY CAN SWIM 
THEY CAN THEY'RE VERY ADAPTABLE THEY CARRY EVERYTHING THEY NEED WITH THEM UM AND THEY'RE EASY TO DRAW 
NO YOU CAN ERASE THE TURTLE IT'S ALRIGHT 
SNAKE 
WELL SNAKE 
IT'S W 
UH A CAT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
THAT'S 
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE 
YEAH UM 
I AGREE WITH HAVING TOO MANY REMOTES AROUND 
MY DAD HAS A WHOLE DRAWER AT HOME OF REMOTES FOR VARIOUS THINGS AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK HALF OF THEM UM 
WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR UM I GUESS SO THAT IT'S EASY TO USE AND THAT THERE'S NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS 
THEY ARE NOT TOO SMALL YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO ONE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
AND ONE THING I PARTICULARLY LIKE SO IF YOU ARE NOT UM SORT OF MOVING IT AROUND TO GET TO TO WORK WITH THE INFRA RED 
UM I THINK THERE IS A WAY AROUND THAT 
BUT I KNOW IN MY RESIDENCE RIGHT NOW THE THE TELEVISION YOU SORT OF HAVE TO WALK ALL AROUND THE ROOM TO GET TO TO TURN ON 
SO I IT'S JUST SIMPLER JUST TO JUST TURN AROUND THE T. V. ITSELF 
AND I THINK THAT'S IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL IT SHOULD ACTUALLY WORK FOR WHAT IT'S DOING 
SO 
I KNOW 
YEAH SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T 
YEAH 
COULD WE GOT SOMETHING THAT 
JUST HAS 
NO DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE BUTTONS THAT YOU NEED TO PROGRAM THE VIDEO RECORDER OR PROGRAM IS THREE THINGS THAT I'M NOT VERY COHERENT ABOUT 
BUT THAT JUST HAS YOUR MAJOR BUTTONS FOR THAT WORK FOR EVERYTHING YOU KNOW VOLUME CONTROL ON OFF 
CHANNEL CHANGING 
YEAH 
NO THAT WAY 
YEAH 
YEAH AND IF UM IF YOU'D SAVE THE MORE COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS MAYBE FOR SEPARATE REMOTES THAT YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO USE EVERY DAY 
UM 
YEAH 
MM 
RIGHT 
MM 
MM YEAH 
YES 
I GUESS WE HAVE TO DEFINE WHAT WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR 
IF IT'S JUST A TELEVISION THEN THAT IT'S A BIT SIMPLER 'CAUSE THERE'S LESS BUTTONS THAT WOULD EVEN NEED TO BE ON IT 
LARGE 
IF YOU HAVE OLDER PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE LIKE UM THAT AREN'T VERY CO ORDINATED HAND YOU 
IT'S REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT THAT YOU ARE NOT PRESSING A SMALL LIKE TEENY MOBILES PHONE SIZE BUTTONS IF WE CAN HELP IT 
HMM 
YEAH 
I'M SURE WE'LL BE BUSY 
I'M TWO 
ALRIGHT 
'KAY 
HMM 
YES 
WELL 
OH MY GOD IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO 
TAKE MY CONTRAPTIONS WITH UM 
ALRIGHT I'M JESSY 
I'M FROM AROUND D. C. ISH SORT OF IN THE U. S. 
AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP THE DEEP SEA SORT OF THEM GOING ON ANIMAL 
DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO DRAW THIS 
JUST WHERE CAN I 
MM 
MM 
MAYBE IF I DO THE WATER BUT HOW 
SORT OF GIVE AN IDEA 
I HAVE AN IDEA HOW ONE WOULD EXPLAIN THIS 
MM MAYBE WITH SOME WHISKERS 
BRIEFLY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SEAL 
YOU CAN IMAGINE IT IN THE WATER 
I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE PLAYFUL AND SILLY SORT OF HAVE A GOOD TIME 
NOT GONNA TRY AND PRETEND LIKE I CAN GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT 
IT'S DEFINITELY SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER ONCE YOU ARE DOING IT 
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE 
UM I HATE WHEN THERE'S LIKE FOR DIFFERENT BUTTONS AND YOU HAVE TO PRESS IT ACTUALLY TRAIN ON THE T. V. LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO ONE FOR THE POWER OF THE T. V. AND THEN LIKE ANOTHER ONE TO GET THE ACTUAL SCREEN ON AND SOMETHING ELSE TO GET IT ALL GOING 
I DON'T KNOW 
NOW THEY KEEP COMBINING ALL DIFFERENT REMOTES TOGETHER AND I DON'T KNOW IF I NECESSARILY LIKE THAT 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU END UP WITH MULTIMEDIA OVERLOAD 
I JUST WANNA WATCH THE T. V. UM 
ALWAYS GETS LOST 
SOME SORT OF LIKE 
DEVICE TO HELP YOU FIND OUT 
YEAH 
WHAT ABOUT LIKE BATTERIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT LIKE ARE THERE SOME REMOTES THAT DON DON'T REQUIRE 
LIKE BATTERIES OR DO ALL REMOTES REQUIRE BATTERIES 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND MAYBE THAT SPATIALLY DIVIDES IT SO IT'S LIKE IF YOU'RE LIKE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THE T. V. ONE THAT'S YOU KNOW 
LIKE THE TOP THING IN THE REMOTE I DUNNO IF D BE VERTICAL OR HORIZONTAL IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT 
BUT IF IT'S LIKE ALL THE T. V. STUFF WAS HERE THEN ALL THE V. C. R. STUFF WAS HERE 
ALL THE WHATEVER ELSE WE HAVE PROGRAMMED INTO IT IT'S ALL JUST IN ITS SEPARATE PLACE AND NOT LIKE ALL THE ONE BUTTONS TOGETHER 
'CAUSE THEN YOU LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M TURNING ON 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM HMM 
I THINK IT'S JUST T. V. I MEAN IF IT IF WE'RE TAKING IT JUST NEW PRODUCT A NEW TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S NOT LIKE DOESN'T SAY 
YOU KNOW THINGS MIGHT BE MORE ADVANCED THAN THAT 
IT'S AN IDEA WITH THE BUTTONS BEING REALLY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I'M FOUR 
OH OKAY 
WELL MY NAME IS AN UH 
AND I'M THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER FOR THE PROJECT 
UM 
AND 
I'LL TRY AND DRAW MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
I'LL I SHOULD LEAVE THAT IN IN THERE SHOULDN'T I BEFORE I CALLOUSLY RUB IT OFF 
UM I'M NOT GONNA DRAW IT QUITE TO SCALE UM 
SO THAT AT LEAST IDENTIFIABLE 
IT'S A WHALE YES 
THANKS 
UM AND YEAH THE REASON I LIKE WHALES IS 'CAUSE UH THEY'RE WELL FIRST OF ALL THEY'RE QUITE INTELLIGENT UM AND ALSO THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF MYSTERIOUS 
LIKE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM OR OR UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK HOW THEY FORM GROUPS 
AND I JUST FIND THEM INTERESTING ANIMALS 
COOL 
I'VE USED I'VE USED REMOTE CONTROLS FOR THINGS LIKE T. V. AND THE C. D. PLAYER AND VIDEO RECORDER AND 
I I GUESS THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY NEAT NEAT LITTLE TOOLS UH 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET UP AND WALK ACROSS THE ROOM TO CHANGE A CHANNEL 
SO ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SOMEONE REALLY LAZY LIKE UM THEY THEY'RE PRETTY NICE 
UM 
I FIND THEM THEY CAN BE A BIT ANNOYING ESPECIALLY 
LIKE YOU KNOW IF I'M WATCHING T. V. I HAVE HAVE TO HAVE THREE SEPARATE REMOTE CONTROLS OF IN FRONT OF UM 
YOU KNOW ONE FOR THE T. V. ONE FOR THE DIGITAL BOX IN FOR UM THE VIDEO RECORDER AS WELL 
UM 
AND ALSO THEY TEND TO THEY TEND TO BE A BIT CONFUSING 
THEY'VE GOT TOO MANY BUTTONS ON THEM UH TO TO SORT OF IT SORT OF COMPLICATED WHEN ALL I REALLY WANNA DO IS SWITCH ON AND OFF 
CHANGE THE CHANNEL CHANGE THE VOLUME 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
CAN I ASK ARE WE DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL FOR A TELEVISION ONLY UM AND IF IF THIS DEVICE IS JUST TO BE USED FOR THE TELEVISION 
WOULD WE EVEN TECHNICALLY BE POSSIBLE TO INCLUDE VIDEO RECORDER FUNCTIONS ON IT 
UM OR SHOULD WE JUST STICK TO JUST STICK TO HAVING TELEVISION TELEVISION RELATED BUTTONS ON IT 
SO WE SHOULD MAYBE WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT I IT IT'S JUST A TELEVISION THAT WE'RE WANTING TO CONTROL 
WELL 
I MEAN I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE PLAYING AND RECORD AND STOP BUTTONS ON IT FOR THE VIDEO RECORDER AS WELL I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WORKS TECHNOLOGICALLY OR NOT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
'KAY 
WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DISCUSSING AT THE NEXT MEETING 
DO WE KNOW THAT 
RIGHT 
YEP 
YEP 
OKAY 
CAN YOU E MAIL YOUR SLIDES AS WELL 
SO THAT POSSIBLE 
COOL 
'KAY 
GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN 
LET'S SEE IF THAT COMES UP 
THIS IS OUR FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING 
UM 
JUST A SEC WHILE MY POWERPOINT COMES UP 
ET VOILA 
OKAY 
MM UM WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
LET'S START 
OKAY OUR AGENDA TODAY UM JUST CHECK THE TIME IT'S TWELVE THIRTEEN 
UM 
I'M GONNA DO AN OPENING TALK ABOUT UM DID YOU ALL GET THE MINUTES 
I E MAILED THEM TO YOU 
I'M ALSO PUTTING 'EM THEM IN THE SHARED FOLDER 
SO UM THEN I WE'LL TALK ABOUT OUR GENERAL OBJECTIVES AND HAVE YOUR THREE PRESENTATIONS 
UM I'LL TALK ABOUT THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS I'VE JUST RECEIVED AND THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS 
FINALLY WE'LL JUST CLOSE 
WE'RE STARTING THIS MEETING AT APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THIRTEEN AND WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES 
SO 
FIRST OF ALL THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OBJECTIVES 
UH WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION WHAT NEEDS AND DESIRES ARE TO BE FULFILLED 
THE FUNCTIONS DESIGN WHAT EFFECTS THE APPARATUS SHOULD HAVE AND THE WORKING DESIGN HOW THE APPARATUS ACTUALLY WORKS TO FULFIL ITS FUNCTION 
OKAY THREE PRESENTATIONS UM YOU CAN GO IN ANY ORDER YOU CHOOSE UM 
SURE PLEASE DO 
YES I D 
YEAH 
FUNCTION F. EIGHT YEAH 
THE BLUE ONE F. N. 
SO IT PLUGGED IN ALL THE WAY AND YOU SCREWED IT ON AND 
MM 'KAY 
IT'S TAKING OUT A LITTLE BIT 
'KAY THERE YOU GO 
PRESS THE LITTLE PRESENTATION 
IT'S THE UM IT LOOKS LIKE A Y. KIND OF OVER THERE ABOVE DRAW 
THERE THAT IN THERE YOU GO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THAT WAS THAT WAS GREAT 
UM 'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION UM ON EFFECTS 
WAS THAT YOU 
GREAT 
PUSH 
USER INTERFACE RIGHT 
INTERFACE 
MM 'KAY THANK YOU 
OKAY 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 'KAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THAT WAS VERY USEFUL 
IT'S FUNNY TO USE THE DRASTIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO REMOTES 
UM 
AND NEITHER OF THEM WERE VERY PRETTY YOU KNOW 
MM 
MM 
YOU THREE TO USE 
LOVELY 
HMM 
UM THE IT'S RIGHT ABOVE DRAW 
THERE ARE THREE THINGY IF IT'S WAY TO THE BOTTOM 
UNDER THREE ICONS AND IT'S THE ON THAT LOOKS LIKE A DESK 
YEAH THAT ONE 
THERE ARE Y. S 
YOU JUST PRESS YEAH JUST CLICK 
THAT'LL BE FINE 
UM YEAH SO THAT THING YOU CAN GO BACK PREVIOUS 
PARDON 
UH WELL 
OKAY 
YOU 
DOUBLE CLICK ON IT 
WITH THE RIGHT WITH THE LEFT HAND ONE 
THERE WE ARE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
EXCELLENT 
SO UM 
YES ABSOLUTELY 
UH I CAN NEVER TELL WHICH WAY TO TURN THESE THINGS 
LEFTY LOOSEY RIGHTY TIGHTY RIGHT 
LEFTY LOOSEY RIGHTY TIGHTY 
OH YES 
MM 'KAY 
UM I HAVE NOTHING IN MY SCREEN 
JUST A SEC 
HERE WE ARE 
OKAY YEAH IT'S FINE 
OKAY REQUIREMENTS 
WE HAVE A COUPLE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT I WAS JUST E MAILED RIGHT BEFORE THE MEETING AND THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN IN UM IN MIND SO WE'RE CREATING THIS 
WE DIDN'T BRING IT UP YET OR AT ALL IN THE MEETINGS AS FAR 
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA WORK WITH TELETEXT BECAUSE UM WELL IT THAT'S BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE INTERNET 
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA WORRY ABOUT UM WE'RE NOT GONNA WORRY ABOUT THAT 
UM 
IT IN 
WE D COULD WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN IT 
HOW 
OKAY 
INTERESTING 
OKAY UM WELL WE'RE NOT GONNA THE MANAGEMENT HAS DECIDED WE'RE NOT GONNA WORK WITH THAT 
UM 
OKAY UM AND WE'RE ALSO GONNA W LIKE YOUR QUESTION EARLIER UM WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO BE IT FOR TELEVISION VIDEO OR ETCETERA 
JUST FOR TELEVISION 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON 
UM OTHERWISE BECOMES TOO COMPLEX WE WANNA GET THIS TO UM VERY QUICKLY 
WE ONLY HAVE A A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME 
UM AND FINALLY THERE'S MORE MARKETING I THINK UM OUR CORPORATE IMAGE HAS TO BE RECOGNISABLE 
SO WHILE WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY WE NEED TO USE OUR COLOUR AND OUR SLOGAN I IN THE NEW DESIGN 
LOOKS LIKE YEAH KIND OF A YELLOW AND BLACK AND WE HAVE THAT THE EMPHASIS ON THE R. S ON UM MM-HMM 
BUT IT'S YEAH WE PUT THE UM 
FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
SO WE GOTTA KEEP THAT IN THAT IN MIND 
YEP 
YEP 
YEAH OR UH MAYBE SOME BUTTONS COULD BE YELLOW 
LIKE WE CAN WE CAN PLAY AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE BIT 
UM 
OKAY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT OUR FUNCTIONS AND OUR TARGET GROUP 
WE NEED TO DECIDE WHO OUR TARGET GROUP IS 
YOU UM IN YOUR ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT MARKET UM OF THE MARKETING YOU IDENTIFIED THAT DIFFERENT GROUPS WANTED DIFFERENT THINGS ARE HAD CERTAIN PREFERENCES 
FOR EXAMPLE THAT UM THAT OLDER PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR UM VOICE RECOGNITION BUT YOUNGER PEOPLE DID 
UM AND SO WHO ARE WE AIMING THIS IT 
MM-HMM 
IT'S GONNA BE TWENTY FIVE EURO REMEMBER SO UM IT HAS TO BE AVAI MARKETABLE TO UM WHOMEVER IT IS 
WELL AT LEAST RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS UM DECIDING ON JUST THE REMOTE ITSELF IS IT WILL PROBABLY BE SOLD SEPARATELY TWENTY FIVE EURO BY ITSELF 
NOW THOSE ARE THAT'S ALL SPECIFIC FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
ARE WE GONNA USE THAT IS ONE OF OUR FUNCTIONS 
MM-HMM 
MM 
TO PRODUCE IT YES 
MM 
THAT'S A GOOD THING TO KEEP IN MIND 
UPGRADE 
WELL WE CAN LOOK FOR WE CAN LOOK AT UPGRADE OR WE CAN LOOK AT UM USER FRIENDLY 
SIMPLIFICATION SO 
UH-HUH MM 
AND WE ALSO NEED TO TALK ABOUT IF WE'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE THE VERY SIMPLE ONES ARE ALSO HAVE THE OTHER ONES JUST SEPARATE SOMEHOW OR 
KIND OF PULL OUT OF THE SIDE 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T IMPEDE UM THE CHIP TRANSMITTING INFORMATION ABOUT UM THAT'S GONNA BE MOSTLY TECHNOLOGICAL THING 
UM 
OKAY UM SO WHAT ARE WE EMPHASISING 
I WHAT IN THIS PROJECT 
SIMPLICITY AND FASHION 
OKAY THESE ARE VERY GOOD GOALS I THINK UM THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IN WITH EVERYTHING WE DO 
SIMPLICITY AND FASHION AND YEAH OR USABILITY SPECI HOWEVER YOU WANNA SAY THAT 
WHICH INCLUDES UM AN EMPHASIS ON MAKING THE INFRA RED VERY FUNCTIONAL IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AROUND A LOT 
UM 
I THINK IT'S A LOT TO DO WITH BATTERY BUT THAT'S JUST MY 
MM-HMM 
SO OUR TARGET GROUP WE'RE SAYING FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE 
SO VOICE RECOGNITION WHICH I KIND OF I KIND OF FEEL LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT NECESSARY IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
LIKE IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR A T. V. BUT NOT FOR THE REMOTE C YOU KNOW 
SEEMS A LITTLE BIT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AND IT MIGHT BE TOO EXPENSIVE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
UNDER SIXTY FIVE OKAY THAT'S A GOOD START 
UM 
I'D SAY WE'RE UH CAN WE NARROW IT DOWN TO MAYBE UM 
TEENAGERS AND FAMILIES 
'CAUSE THAT WOULD GO UP TO LIKE FIFTY 
OKAY SINGLE 
IT'S IT'S HARD TO NARROW IT DOWN 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO MAYBE IT'S MORE USEFUL TO DO DO TO DEFINE OBJECTIVES LIKE FASHION AND SIMPLICITY THAN TO FIND SPECIFIC TARGET GROUP AS FAR AS AGE IS BECAUSE 
YEAH THINGS IS DIFFERENT WILL APPEAL TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT 
OKAY 
UM UH THERE'RE A COUPLE FUNCTIONS DO WE WANT SOMETHING IS THAT DO WE WANT SOME KIND OF THING TO FIND OUT IF IT'S LOST 
LIKE A BUTTON ON A T. V. YOU CAN PRESS AND IT'LL RING OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW LIKE OR BEEP 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY WE HAVE TO WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR MINUTES LEFT TO DEFINE OUR FUNCTIONS 
SO LET'S DO THAT QUICKLY 
UM SO WE WANT SOMETHING TO KEEP IT FROM GETTING LOST 
AND WE WANT 
UM 
WE WANT LARGE BUTTONS FOR THE ESSENTIAL THINGS 
LARGE ACCESSIBLE BUTTONS FOR THE ESSENTIALS 
WE WANT A POSSIBILITY TO ME TO GET UM 
A POSSIBILITY TO GET THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS 
MM-HMM 
UM YEAH HIDDEN AWAY 
AND WE ALSO WANT TO TO BE FASHIONABLE WHICH I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S A FUNCTION IS MUCH AS A UM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY DO IT 
ANY OTHER ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS THAT WE NEED 
BATTERY 
DO WE NEED A LONG LIFE BATTERY 
BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL 
YEAH I WOULD IMAGINE 
JUST 'CAUSE IT IS AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE THE 
CHARGING 
MM-HMM 
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT UM SPACE IN LIVING ROOMS TOO LIKE 'CAUSE THEY'RE I MEAN WOULD YOU PUT IT ON TOP OF THE T. V. 
I DON'T KNOW JUST THINK OKAY THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD IDEA WE'LL KEEP IT 
THINK IT'S 
AND MAYBE FUN 
OKAY 
UM 'KAY WE'RE GONNA CONCLUDE NOW HAS EVERYONE SAID OTHER FUNCTIONS AND 'KAY 
UM AFTER THE MEETING WE'RE GONNA EACH COMPLETE A SKS UM A QUESTIONNAIRE AND A SUMMARIES SUMMARY 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SUMMARISATION 
UM AND THEN WE'LL HAVE OUR LUNCH BREAK 
AFTER THAT WE HAVE THIRTY MINUTES OF INDIVIDUAL WORK 
UM I'LL MAKE SURE TO PUT UP UM THE MINUTES AND THE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND INCLUDING THESE POWERPOINT SLIDES 
IF EVERYONE COULD DO THAT AS WELL THAT'D BE GREAT 
UM YOU EACH HAVE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS I. UM I. D. INDUSTRIAL DESIGN YOU'VE YOUR COMPONENTS CONCEPT USER INTERFACE THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT MARKET TREND WA WATCHING 
AND SO AS PER LAST TIME YOU'LL GET SPECIFIC INCRAT INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR PERSONAL COACH E MAILED TO YOU 
AND HOPEFULLY I HOPE NEXT TIME YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ACCESS MORE OF THE WEB SITE THAT THEY THEY SEEM TO TELL YOU THAT YOU COULD 
IT'S KINDA FRUSTRATING BUT UM 
BE EASIER TO NOTE ANY FRUSTRATIONS OR ANY UM ISSUES THAT CAME UP ON YOUR UM IN YOUR UM SUMMARY 
MM 'KAY 
GREAT SEEING Y'ALL 
LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE UM LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A SECOND ONE KIND OF OF MINE THAT'S THAT I DIDN'T DO 
IT'S FROM LIKE AN EARLIER PROJECT I THINK SO UM 
UNDER THE SHARED FOLDER I DON'T KNOW IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE UNDER YOURS AS WELL 
PROJECTS 
OKAY 
YOU DON'T HAVE MAN 
SO 
MM 
OKAY 
WELL I'LL FIGURE THAT IT IN THE MEANTIME 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DISCONNECT ROSE 
YEAH 
I I THINK YOU JUST HAVE TO PUSH IT IN REALLY HARD 
UH GET IT 
MM NEITHER HAVE I 
ALRIGHT 
HMM 
'KAY 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 'KAY 
OKAY GREAT 
HMM 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT COULD BE OUR SELLING POINT 
RIGHT 
HMM 
RIGHT I REALLY CAN'T SEE WHAT I'M DOING SO DOES ANYONE HAVE A 
UH UH LOOK AT THAT SHOWING UP ALREADY 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT UM 
NO HOW DO I PLAY AGAIN 
OH 
OKAY 
SO THIS IS ARE WORKING DESIGN PRESENTATION 
UM I HAD A BIT OF SOME ISSUES WITH THIS BECAUSE I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND EVERYTHING I NEEDED BUT I GUESS THAT'S WE'RE STILL IN EARLY STAGES 
UM SO YEAH THIS IS THIS 
THOUGH THE THE THING ABOUT WORKING DESIGN IS THE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS A WORKING DESIGN IS FIGURE OUT HOW THE APARATA APPARATUS CAN FULFIL ITS FUNCTION 
UM ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT KEPT COMING UP FOR ME IS THAT A COFFEE GRINDER 
IT WORKS BECAUSE IT CONVERTS ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO GRINDING THE BEANS AND THEN YOU PUT THE BEAN THROUGH A FILTER AND THAT FILTERS IT 
AND THEN YOU GET COFFEE AT THE AND THAT'S NICE AND HOT BECAUSE OF THE COMBINATION OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY AND THEN THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BROUGHT IN TO MAKE IT WORK 
DON'T KNOW IF I'M EXPLAINING THAT VERY WELL BUT HOW DO I GOT TO THE NEXT IS UH 
SO UH THE METHOD IS UM WORKING DESIGNERS FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE IT FULFIL THIS PRACTICAL FUNCTION 
WHAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND HOW DO WE CONVERT ALL THE ELEMENTS TO MAKE THAT DONE 
SO WHA THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE POINTS 
IT WHICH YOU NEED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN 
SO YOU MAKE A SCHEMATIC OF THE WAY THAT THE THE ENERGY IS CONVERTED 
TSH TOWARDS THIS PRACTICAL FUNCTION 
AND THEN I THINK THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS GONNA BE WORK ON EACH TASK SEPARATELY 
SO UM 
OH 
OH 
SO THE FINDINGS THAT I GOT UH VERY JUST VERY BRIEFLY IS THAT YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF THE WAY THAT THE INFORMATION IS PROJECTED TO THE RECEIVER AND IN MY OPINION INFRA RED IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT 'CAUSE YOU DON'T NEED A SIGHT LINE 
SO THAT'S ONE THING WE'RE GONNA WORK ON 
UM THE USER INTERFACE IS CRITICAL HERE 
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN A REMOTE CONTROL HAPPEN THROUGH THE CHIP THAT CONTROLS THAT CONVERTS THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY INTO DATA 
WHICH THEN GOES THROUGH THE INFRA RED IS THE THE CHIP THAT UH I THINK ONE IS DESIGNING IS GONNA BE CRUCIAL 
AND REALLY AT ALL COMES DOWN TO THE AT THE USER BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONE THAT'S CONTROLLING MOST OF THE WORKING DESIGN 
SO THE COMPONENTS THAT WE FOUND HERE ARE THE ENERGY SOURCE YOU KNOW THE BATTERY OR WHATEVER THAT'S GONNA M MAKE IT WORK THEN THE CHIP 
WHICH CONVERTS THE DATA THE USER THAT'S CONTROLLING THE CHIP AND THE INFRA RED BULB THAT'S GONNA LET US MOVE THE DATA AT THE RECEIVER 
SO YOU HAVE FOUR MAIN COMPONENTS AND THEY ARE DESIGNED SORT OF LIKE THIS 
YOU HAVE YOUR ENERGY SOURCE RIGHT THERE WHICH THEN UM BRINGS 
UH ENERGY OR INFORMATION TO THE CHIP WHICH IS ALSO CONTROLLED BY THE USERS 
YOU HAVE ENERGY GOING TO THE USER WHO'S CONTROLLING THE CHIP OOH 'S NOT WHAT I WANTED TO DO UH UH 
PREVIOUS 
SORRY ABOUT THAT GUYS 
OH 
NO NO NO NO NO 
OKAY LET'S JUST GET BACK TO MY SCHEMATIC HERE 
W YEAH YEAH 
I THINK IT'S FROZEN 
HERE 
DON'T SHOW ME THAT TIP AGAIN 
THERE WE ARE 
SORRY ABOUT THESE GUYS 
I'M KIND OF PATHETIC WITH THINGS LIKE THIS 
UM ALRIGHT 
SO YOU HAVE YOUR ENERGY SOURCE YOUR USER INTERFACE WHO'S CONTROLLING THE CHIP THE CHIP ALSO USES THE ENERGY 
AND THE CHIP THROUGH THE EASE OF THE USER INTERFACE IS GONNA CONTROL THE SWITCH WHICH WILL WORK YOUR INFRA RED BULB 
WHICH WILL THEN BRING THE DATA AT THE RECEIVER 
SO HOPEFULLY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR EVERYONE IN MY KIND OF GARBLED WAY 
THIS IS THE THE PARTS OF THE WORKING DESIGN THAT NEED TO BE FIGURED OUT 
AND PERSONAL PREFERENCES BESIDES THE FACT THAT I CAN'T SPELL WE NEED A LONG LASTING ENERGY SOURCE PEOPLE DON'T WANNA BE CHANGING IT A LOT 
WE NEED A CHIP THAT WORKS WELL WITH THE USER INTERFACE THAT ISN'T TOO COMPLICATED 
WE NEED A STRAIGHTFORWARD INTERFACE LIKE ONE WAS SAYING SIMPLE NOT OVERWHELMING IT WITH INFORMATION AND WE NEED A RELIABLE AND CLEAR INFRA RED SIGNAL 
SO THAT YOU'RE NOT WAVING YOUR REMOTE AROUND AND HAVING TO GET FRUSTRATED AND GO DO IT BY HANDS 
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR THE WORKING DESIGN 
ROSE DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GIVE ME A HAND WITH THIS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S GONNA STICK ON YOUR HEAD 
OH NO SIGNAL 
OKAY 
UH IT'S A BRITISH THING 
NO 
SO 
LOTTERY NUMBERS AND SPORT SCORES 
BUT IF YOU EVER USE THE T. V. SAYING LIKE GO TO PAGE ONE SIXTY ON CEEFAX NOW THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT 
I HAVE AN IDEA WHY WE DON'T HAVE TO BUT 
'KAY 
MM 
OKAY SO WE WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD 
AND SO YELLOW 
OKAY 
WELL IF WE'RE GONNA SAY THAT FUNCTION UM FASHION WE PUT THE FASHION IN IN ELECTRONICS THEN YOU AUTOMATICALLY 
I THINK A SORT OF YOUNGER GROUP THAT THAT'S WHO'S GONNA BE ATTRACTED TO THIS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY UH A POPULATION W QUITE A LITTLE BIT OF DISPOSABLE INCOME FOR US IN TECHNOLOGY ANYWAY 
SO THAT MIGHT BE A FAIRLY GOOD TARGET GROUP FOR US 
MM 
TO PRODUCE IT YEAH 
HMM 
BUT RIGHT 
WELL BUT WHY ARE WE WHY ARE WE AIMING FOR A TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT 
EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS EASE OF US AND SIMPLE AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN MORE TECHNOLOGY IN FACT IT COULD USE IT COULD MEAN NOT 
IF THEY MIGHT BE OVERWHELMED WITH WITH REMOTES THAT HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS AND TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY 
YEAH SIMPLIFICATION 
THEY COULD HAVE A CRAP REMOTE THAT CAME WITH THEIR T. V. THAT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO USE OR MAYBE TO BREAK OR MAYBE THEY'RE JUST MISSING IT 
HMM 
OH 
OH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
MM 
GOOD POINT 
YEAH 
YEAH MM 
THE BATTERY AND THAT I THINK THAT THE CHIP TAKES THE DATA AND PRESENTS IT WILL WITHOUT SORT OF SCATTERING 
YEAH 
I THINK SO 
THE QUALITY UH QUALITY OF ALL THE COMPONENTS REALLY I MEAN WE CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING SHODDY WORK 'CAUSE IT'S 
GONNA BE VISIBLE DOWN THE LINE 
MM MM 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
I 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT I TH I THINK REGARDLESS WE'RE WE'RE AIMING FOR THE UNDER SIXTY FIVE OR SOMETHING 
OR LIKE SINGLE PROFESSIONALS OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIGURE OUT RIGHT NOW 
YEAH 
THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH IT PROBABLY 
MM 
MM 
YEAH THAT'LL PROBABLY BE GOOD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
BATTERY BATTERY SO 
YEAH BUT I THINK THAT GOES IN WITH SIMPLICITY AND SO IF IS REALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
IT I THINK IT DOES 
I DON'T I DON'T THINK OF A WAY YOU CAN OPERATE A CHIP AND CONVERT THAT MUCH DATA WITHOUT WITHOUT ONE 
BUT YOU COULD MAYBE HAVE IT IN A LITTLE CHARGING STATION LIKE A MOBILE PHONE OR LIKE A LITTLE CRADLE FOR YOUR IPOD 
YOU COULD WE COULD MAYBE DO THAT INSTEAD 
SO YOU DON'T UH YOU GOT LIKE A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY 
I DUNNO THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO LESS PEOPLE LOSING IT OUT OF IT IT STAYS IN ONE PLACE 
MM 
YEAH 
THAT'S JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD 
YEAH WHO KNOWS 
OKAY 
SOUNDS GOOD 
YES I JUST ADD THAT 
HOPEFULLY IT IS THERE FOR PEOPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
TECHNICAL 
SO IN THERE WE HAVE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS PRESENTATION WORKING DESIGN PRESENTATION AND THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I HAVE NO 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I HAVE AS WELL R ROSE SO 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM SHALL WE GO ON THE ORDER THAT YOU JUST ADD IT 
I DUNNO 
HOW DO I HOOK MY SCREEN UP 
WHERE DOES IT GO 
MM-HMM 
HMM I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO MOVE THIS BUT 
WHERE'S FUNCTION 
NO SIGNAL 
OH WAIT 'S SCREW IN 
PUSH THE SCREW 
MM ALRIGHT 
I'VE NEVER ATTACHED TO ANYTHING 
ALRIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO UM THE REPORT THAT WAS ONLINE OR IF I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO IS 
BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS 
NO 
ALRIGHT 
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT PEOPLE SPECIFIED WHEN THEY WERE ASKED 
UM I GUESS REAL REACTION DID SOME MARKET RESEARCH 
THEY HAD A HUNDRED SUBJECTS AND THEIR USABILITY LAB AND THEY WATCHED THEM WATCH T. V. AND RECORDED THE FREQUENCY THAT THEY USED PARTICULAR BUTTONS AND THE RELEVANCE THAT THESE BUTTONS HAD 
WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THEY ANALYSED PEOPLE'S DESIRES AND NEEDS 
FOCUSING ON THEIR DESIRES UM PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT THEY THOUGHT REMOTES WERE UGLY 
SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE A HUNDRED SUBJECTS NOTED THAT AND THAT THEY MORE IMPORTANTLY THOUGH 
EIGHTY PER CENT SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR A FANCIER LOOKING REMOTE 
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING BEYOND WHAT FANCY MEANS BUT THAT'S PARTICULARLY OF USE IT SO I THINK 
UM ALSO THEY DID SOME QUESTIONS ON VOICE RECOGNITION AND FIND THAT THE DESIRE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION WAS INVERSELY RELATED TO GO 
SO YOUNGER PEOPLE WERE MORE INCLINED TO WANT SOMETHING WITH VOICE RECOGNITION 
WHEREAS THE OLDER PEOPLE IN THE LIKE SIXTY AND ABOVE SEGMENT OR SO DID NOT REALLY THINK THAT THEY WOULD PAY MORE MONEY FOR VOICE RECOGNITIONS 
UM PEOPLE ALSO HAD CERTAIN FRUSTRATIONS THAT I THINK THAT WE COULD TRY TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WITH 
OUR DESIGN 
THAT BEING PEOPLE K UM FRUSTRATED WITH LOSING THEIR REMOTES 
I THINK OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE MENTIONED THAT THAT WAS THEIR BIGGEST FRUSTRATION 
PEOPLE ARE ALSO FRUSTRATED WITH THE DIFFICULTY IT IS TO LEARN HOW TO USE A REMOTE AND I THINK THAT TIES BACK TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE JUST THAT THERE'S TOO MANY BUTTONS 
IT JUST NEEDS TO BE EASY TO USE 
IT ALSO MENTIONED SOMETHING CALLED R. S. I. AND I WAS HOPING SOMEONE MIGHT BE ABLE TO INFORM ME IS IT WHAT R. S. A. S BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT 
OH 
THERE WE GO 
WOW 
PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THAT 
SO I GUESS SORT OF THE CARPAL TUNNEL TYPE THING PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THAT UM THE REPETITIVE SO I GUESS CAUSED A STRAIN 
UM LOOKING AT THE NEEDS PEOPLE SPECIFIED THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS THAT PEOPLE'S REMOTES ARE NOT MATCHING THEIR OPERATING BEHAVIOUR 
PEOPLE ARE ONLY USING TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTONS THAT THEY HAVE OFFERED TO THEM IN THEIR REMOTE 
AND WHAT PEOPLE DO MOST OFTEN IS CHANGING THE CHANNEL AND CHANGING THE VOLUME 
PEOPLE ALSO ZAP LIKE TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL BUT UM SIXTY FIVE PER CENT DURING AN HOUR OF US 
SO WE REALLY JUST NEED TO FOCUS ON ON THOSE VOLUMES AND CHANNEL CHANGERS RATHER THAN THINGS LIKE THE AUDIO SETTINGS 
THE SCREEN SETTINGS AND THE CHANNEL SETTINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE USED MUCH MORE INFREQUENTLY AND PROBABLY JUST COMPLICATE WHAT'S GOING ON 
SO I THINK THAT SOME THINGS THAT WE MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF AN L. C. D. SCREEN WAS BROUGHT UP ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY DETAILS ON 
WHAT PEOPLE'S PREFERENCES ON THAT WERE SO I DUNNO KNOW IF THAT'S COMING TO ME LATER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT SOMETHING FOR US TO CONSIDER ALSO JUST THE PHENOMENON THAT LESS IS MORE WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE OR WHAT WE WANNA MAKE EASIEST TO USE 
MAKE SURE THAT 
YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE AN AUDIO SETTING ISN'T GIVEN AS MUCH IMPORTANCE AND VISIBILITY IN THE REMOTE IS SOMETHING LIKE CHANNEL CHANGING THAT'S USED A LOT MORE OFTEN 
AND BASICALLY IN ORDER FOR US TO WIN OVER TO THE CONSUMER WE JUST NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
THAT IT HAS A FANCY APPEAL AND THAT IT'S NOT UGLY AND THAT IT FEELS LIKE THE WAY THEY'RE GONNA USE IT 
SO IT DOESN'T GIVE THEM ANY HAND INJURIES OR THINGS LIKE THAT 
HMM 
YEAH HAVE I UNSCREWED IT 
HERE WE GO 
AND I THINK THAT'S IN THE SHARED IF I DID IT RIGHT IF ANYONE WANTS TO LOOK AT IT 
NO 
A FASHION FASHION REMOTE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO WAIT DID IT LET YOU GO ON THE INTERNET OR WAS THAT JUST WHAT IT LET YOU SEE 
OKAY 
'CAUSE I WAS LIKE GOOGLING AND THEN I'M LIKE WAIT IT WON'T LET ME GOOGLE 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD ONE IT'LL STICK WITH YOU 
WHAT'S TELETEXT 
OH 
UH SO 
MM-HMM 
OH 
THAT EXPLAINS A LOT 
THAT'S GOOD 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES I DO THINK WHO'S GONNA HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY THAT ALSO THAT ONE 
THE ONLY BREAK DOWN THAT I WAS GIVEN IN TERMS OF AGE WAS THE VOICE ACTIVATION AND BASICALLY THERE'S A BIG JUMP 
AFTER THIRTY FIVE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE OF IT HAS VOICE SO IT'S LIKE BASICALLY FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE THAT THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
I DUNNO I'M GONNA BE GIVEN ANY OTHER NUMBERS BROKEN DOWN IN TERMS OF AGE LATER 
BUT IF THAT'S SORT OF THE ONLY QUALITY THAT WE HAVE THAT IS DIVIDED INTO AGE THEN WE WOULD WANNA STICK BETWEEN THE FIFTEEN AND THIRTY FIVE RANGE 
BUT WHAT ELSE ARE WE GONNA PUT I MEAN NOT THAT I'M REALLY GUNG HO ABOUT IT 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU CAN PUT IN A REMOTE TO MAKE IT TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THOUGH 
SO LIKE OTHER THAN JUST MAKING IT LOOK GOOD 
HOW IS IT I MEAN IT CAN LOOK REALLY GREAT AND STILL HAVE THE SAME UP ONE DOWN BUTTONS AND WHY'S ANYONE GONNA BUY A NEW REMOTE 
MM-HMM 
IF SOMEONE'S LOOKING TO BUY A NEW REMOTE DON'T THEY WANT LIKE AN UPGRADE 
I DUNNO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
CAN YOU LIKE I MEAN THIS MAY BE TOO COMPLICATED BUT I WISH I HAD SOMETHING TO EXPLAIN IT LIKE IF IT WAS JUST A SIMPLE 
EITHER THIS WAY OR THIS WAY THAT HAD LIKE THE MAIN BUTTONS AND THEN YOU COULD LIKE PULL SOMETHING TO 
KIND OF AND LIKE YOU GET THE REST THE BUTTONS BUT THE REST OF THEM LIKE WANT ONE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING 
MM-HMM 
'CAUSE THEN 'S LIKE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANNA EVER LOOK AT THEM 
NEVER EVEN HAVE TO USE THEM AND IF YOU LOOK GET THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL THAT COMES WITH IT AND YOU JUST DON'T EVEN READ IT THEN YOU'LL NEVER EVEN KNOW THAT THESE THINGS CAN PULL OUT 
AND YOU'RE A HAPPY PERSON AND EVERYONE ELSE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE LIKE TWO REMOTES ON THAT HAS THE EASY ONES AND ON THAT HAS 
MORE COMPLICATED ONES BUT 'S ALL STILL IN ONE 
YEAH 
I THINK SIMPLICITY FASHION 
MM-HMM 
WHAT CAN YOU DO IT LIKE MAKE THE INFRA RED MORE FUNCTIONAL LOOK WHY WOULD IT NOT BE 
I'M JUST WONDERING 
OKAY 
SO 'S JUST THE QUALITY OF THE CHIP 
OKAY 
WELL I DUNNO HOW USEFUL THAT NUMBER SO IF WE'RE NOT DOING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I DON'T 
AND OF THE WHOLE IDEA SO YOU'RE USING A REMOTE THEN WHY WOULD YOU HAVE VOICE 
LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND THEN IT'S LIKE YOU WOULDN'T NEED A REMOTE YOU'D JUST TALK TO YOUR T. V. 
MM YEAH 
MAYBE I MEAN IF I GOT UM MORE NUMBERS I'LL E MAIL YOU BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING IN TERMS OF AGES 
BUT THIS DOESN'T DIVIDE UP ANYTHING AND THERE WAS ONLY A HUNDRED SUBJECTS ALSO WHICH ISN'T I MEAN 
REALLY ISN'T THAT REPRESENTATIVE 
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A HUNDRED SUBJECTS THAT THE THEY THEN CAN SUBDIVIDE INTO AGE GROUPS THAT MEANS THERE'S VERY FEW IN EACH AGE GROUP IS 
TWENTY TO LIKE FIFTY FIVE 
I DUNNO 
WELL MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE TO DEFI DEFINE THE TARGET GROUP BY THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF AGE MAYBE WE CAN DEFINE IT BY LIKE THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF 
LIKE UH TO HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE TO SPEND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE 
WELL OBVIOUSLY IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE WHO OWNS A TELEVISION AND LIKE HOW RECENTLY HAVE THEY BOUGHT THEIR TELEVISION LIKE THAT SORT OF THING 
YEAH 
OH 
I MEAN LIKE I SAID BEFORE 
FIFTY PER CENT OF OF THE FOUR OF LIKE FRUSTRATION SOMEONE CAN HAVE THAT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE AND HALF THE PEOPLE SAID THAT HAPPENED AND WE ALL MENTIONED IT BEFORE WE KNOW ABOUT IT 
AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING SOMETHING SAY THAT SORT OF GOES ALONG WITH IT IS IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE A RANDOM THING TO SORT OF ADD ONE 
IT WOULD BE RELEVANT TO LIKE THE OVERALL GOAL I THINK SO 
HMM 
IN YOUR COFFEE TABLE IT'S NOT LIKE AN EYE SORE THAT KIND OF THING 
YEAH 
SO YOU NEVER HAVE TO CHANGE THE BATTERY 
MM 
IT'S GOOD 
DID YOU UM WERE YOU ABLE TO LIKE PUT YOURS IN THE GROUP FOLDER 
OKAY 
YEP 
WHERE IS THAT 
YOURS IS 
I ONLY HAVE THREE I JUST HAVE LIKE OR THREE 
YEAH 
NO BUT THAT'S 'CAUSE I THINK YOURS IS IN THE E MAIL SEPARATE LIKE IT'S NOT IN THE SERVER 
BUT IF I OPEN IT AND THEN SAVE IT PROBABLY WILL BE THERE 
OH WAIT NEVER MIND YOU CAN'T SAVE IT AT THE 
OKAY 
YEP 
WELL THERE'S A WEE A WEE PLUG JUST JUST THAT IN THERE 
OH THAT'S IT YEP 
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PRESS FUNCTION F. EIGHT I THINK IT IS IN YOUR LAPTOP 
THAT'S IT 
REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
SO IF YOU 
CHEERS 
HERE WE GO 
RIGHT SO I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE TECHNICAL TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL UM 
WE NEED TO START BY CONSIDERING WHAT A REMOTE CONTROL ACTUALLY SO 
IT'S A DEVICE THAT ALLOWS US TO PRODUCE CERTAIN EFFECTS ON OUR TELEVISION SO I IT'S BASICALLY A COMMUNICATION DEVICE 
WE WE TELL THE REMOTE CONTROL WHAT WE WANT TO DO IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE TELEVISION SAYING CHANGE THE CHANNEL 
CHANGE THE VOLUME UH YEAH ADJUST THESE SETTINGS ADJUST THE BRIGHTNESS 
UM HOW DO WE ACTUALLY GO ABOUT DESIGNING A NEW TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL 
FIRST THING TO DO IS IT CAME UP WITH THE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS 
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT OUR FINAL PRODUCT IS GONNA BE LIKE SO WE NEED A A COOLER IDEA OF EXACTLY WHAT THIS PRODUCT DOES 
UH HOW IT WORKS AND WHAT THE END USER IS GONNA WANT FROM THIS PRODUCT 
UM 
UH A WAY I'D SUGGEST THAT WE COULD GO ABOUT THIS IS BY DESIGNING UH SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROTOTYPES OF USER INTERFACES FOR THIS PRODUCT 
UM AND THEN UH TRYING TO GET SOME FEEDBACK UH BUT 
UH HOW WELL THIS PARTICULAR PROTOTYPES WORK UH SORTA FIND OUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF 'EM 
UM USING A REMOTE CONTROL IS IS QUITE A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE 
UM 
AND DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PEOPLE SORT OF PREFER DIFFERENT THINGS 
UM WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE A A FAIRLY STANDARD PIECE OF EQUIPMENT 
WHEN A USERS USING A REMOTE CONTROL UH OR SHE EXPECTS THE BUTTONS TO BE IN CERTAIN PLACES 
SO IN SOME SENSE WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO AIM FOR A DEVICE WHICH IS FAIRLY CONVENTIONAL IN DESIGN UH SO THAT WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY SHOCKING PEOPLE 
BUT I THINK WITHIN THAT THERE IS ALSO ROOM FOR US TO INTRODUCE NOVEL IDEAS UH NEED TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT 
SOMETHING THAT STANDS OUT 
UM ALSO IN IN DESIGNING THE USER INTERFACE WE NEED TO CONSIDER PRACTICALITIES 
UH THE FIRST OF THIS IS IS TECHNOLOGICAL YE UH WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF TECHNOLOGY IS IT IS 
THE SECOND IS IS ECONOMIC UH WE NEED TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN FEATURES AND PRICE 
SO SO YOU MENTIONED THINGS LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD WOULD ADD TO THE PRICE UH BUT IT WOULD ALSO IM IMPROVE THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT 
SO I HAD A LOOK ON THE ON THE WEB UH TO SEE IF I COULD FIND A FEW EXAMPLES OF EXISTING TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROLS 
IN ANALYSING THESE WE CAN CONSIDER WHAT WHAT THINGS WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THEM 
UH WHAT THINGS DO THEY GET RIGHT WHAT'S BAD ABOUT THEM WHAT'S WRONG WITH 'EM 
UM HOW WE CAN IMPROVE ON THE DESIGNS THAT THAT THAT I FOUND AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE OUR PRODUCT STAND OUT FROM FROM THE LARGE MAJORITY OF REMOTE CONTROLS 
HERE'S TWO EXAMPLES UH PROBABLY AT THE EXTREME ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM 
UM IN THE LEFT HERE WE'VE GOT UH AN ENGINEERING BASED DESIGN FOR A REMOTE CONTROL SO IT'S NO THAT'S GOT LOTS OF BUTTONS 
IT'S IT'S FULLY FEATURED EVERYTHING YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY WANT TO DO IS THERE YOU KNOW IT'S GOT FORWARD 
BACKWARDS UP DOWN CHANNEL NUMBERS VOLUME UH FREEZE FRAME 
YEAH IT'S IT'S FULLY FEATURED AND IT MIGHT TAKE A WHILE TO GET TO LEARN TO USE IT 
BUT ONCE YOU'VE LEARNED IT YOU CAN YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH YOUR T. V. 
THE IN IN THE RIGHT AS A LOT MORE BASIC 
IT'S JUST GET THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE T. V. CHANGING THE CHANNEL PLAY STOP VOLUME 
IT WOULD BE A LOT QUICKER TO LEARN TO USE IT BUT AGAIN THE IT'S IT'S SWINGS AND ROUNDABOUTS 
THERE ARE DISADVANTAGES YOU CAN'T USE IT EASY TO TO FREEZE THE TELEVISION PICTURE 
UH THERE'S A LOT OF FEATURES THAT ARE MISSING FROM THAT REMOTE CONTROL 
SO WE'VE GOT TO TO FIND OUR FIND A WAY OF STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO 
UM SO I SAID BEFORE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE SUBJECTIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WANT WANT DIFFERENT THINGS 
UM PERSONALLY WA WHAT I WANT FROM A REMOTE CONTROL IS A DEVICE THAT'S SIMPLE 
IT IT'S EASY TO USE UH IT'S GOT BIG BUTTONS FOR DOING THE THINGS I DO MOST OFTEN CHANGING THE VOLUME CHANGING THE CHANNEL 
IT IT DOES EVERYTHING THAT I NEED TO TO UH SO I SAID BEFORE 
I'M QUITE LAZY I DON'T WANNA WALK ACROSS THE ROOM JUST TO ADJUST MY TELEVISION 
I ALSO WANT SOMETHING THAT THAT LOOKS COOL UM AND THAT THAT FEELS GOOD THAT'S ERGONOMICALLY DESIGNED 
I THINK THERE'S THERE'S CERTAINLY A MARKET FOR TECHNOLOGY THAT LOOKS COOL 
AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHY COMPANIES LIKE APPLE'VE 'VE 'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS 
UH THAT WAS JUST IN THE IDEA ON THE COMPANY WEB SITE YEAH 
WHAT'S UP 
LEFTY LOOSEY 
OH 
NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE THAT'S GOOD 
I'LL THINK OF THAT EVERY TIME NOW 
YOU DON'T HAVE IT IN THE STATES 
UH I DIDN'T REALISE 
UM YEAH IT'S LIKE A 
I SUPPOSE IT'S KIND OF SIMILAR TO A VERY VERY BASIC WEB BROWSER 
UM YOU HAVE LIKE YOU HAVE UH NUMBERS ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL UH YOU AND YOU TYPE IN THE PAGE NUMBER YOU WANT 
SO LIKE YOU TYPE A HUNDRED ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL AND THIS THIS KIND OF INDEX APPEARS IN THE TELEVISION SCREEN WITH JUST SOME SOME TEXT AND SOME VERY BLOCKY LOOKING GRAPHICS ON IT 
AND YOU JUST TYPE NUMBERS TO GO TO DIFFERENT PAGES AND IT GIVES YOU INFORMATION 
MOSTLY RATHER BORING STUFF LIKE WHAT'S ON T. V. NEXT AND SHARE PRICES AND THAT KIND OF THING 
YEP NEWS HEADLINES 
IT'S EARL IT'S PRETTY OLD TECHNOLOGY 
IT'S LIKE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
RIGHT 
SO WHAT'S OUR CORPORATE IMAGE LIKE 
IT'S IT'S KIND OF YELLOW COLOUR WITH UH WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
IT'S LIKE DOUBLE R. 
YEAH 
SO IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BE SOLD SEPARATELY FROM THE TELEVISION OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT COMES WI WITH A TELEVISION 
'CAUSE THAT WOULD AFFECT THE WAY THAT WE MARKET IT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT OKAY 
YEAH 
UM 
I I WOULD SAY NO BECAUSE IT'S GONNA ADD TOO MUCH TO THE PRICE 
ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE MARKETING TO USE A SEPARATE PRODUCT PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE PAYING UH 
WELL UH WE'VE GOT A PRICE LIMIT OF WAS IT TWELVE TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS FOR TO PRODUCE IT 
AND I WONDER IF WE CAN GET VOICE RECOGNITION INTO THAT TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE TOO MANY OTHER COMPROMISES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE REMOTE THERE ARE REMOTE CONTROLS LIKE THAT YEAH 
LIKE SOME T. V. S THEY HAVE A SORT OF UH A SLIDING SCREEN ON THE REMOTE CONTROL IF IT THAT HIDES ALL THE COMPLICATED BUTTONS 
SO IF YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING COMPLICATED LIKE PROGRAMME YOUR TELEVISION OR OR TEN OUT 
THEN YOU YOU OPEN UP THIS LITTLE HATCH OR OR SLIDE THE SCREEN DOWN AND THERE'S ALL THE ALL THE SPECIAL BUTTONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA YEAH 
YEAH 
SO SIMPLICITY AND FASHION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S YEAH IT'S PRETTY IT'S PRETTY HIGH TECH 
IT'S FOR LIKE THE ULTIMATELY LAZY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T EVEN BE BOTHERED TO PICK UP THE REMOTE 
YEP 
I THINK THE PRODUCT APPEALS ACROSS A QUITE A BROAD RANGE OF AGES 
I MEAN WE WE SAID SIMPLICITY IS IS ONE OF THE FEATURES SO IT'S GOING TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE MAYBE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH TECHNOLOGY 
YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO GET SCARED BY HAVING LOTS OF BUTTONS AND THAT MIGHT BE OLDER PEOPLE 
BUT THEN WE'VE ALSO GOT FASHION WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY APPEALS TO YOUNGER PEOPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH UM FOR A AN INCOME GROUP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHICH ARE KIND OF HIDDEN AWAY IN SOME WAY OR 
WELL NOT HIDDEN BUT THEY'RE UH 
THEY'RE NOT AS PROMINENT AS THE MAIN FEATURES 
WE SHOULD MAYBE INVESTIGATE WHETHER IT NEEDS A BATTERY AT ALL 
I SUSPECT THE REMOTE CONTROL DOES NEED A BATTERY BUT 
I DUNNO IF YOU CAN 
YEAH 
YEAH WITHOUT THE ENERGY YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S POSSIBLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
I G YEAH 
TIME IS IT 
OKAY 
LOVELY TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN 
UM IT'S OUR CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING AND IT'S STARTING AT APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND SO WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES FOR THIS ONE AGAIN AND SO WE'LL GO JUST AFTER THREE O'CLOCK 
UM OKAY OUR AGENDA WE'RE GONNA DO AN OPENING I'M GONNA REVIEW THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING 
THEN WE'LL HAVE YOUR THREE PRESENTATIONS UM AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS AND FINALLY WE'LL CLOSE 
SO OPENING 
UM THESE ARE OUR MINUTES FROM OUR THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 
WE DECIDED OUR TARGET GROUP IS THE FOCUS ON WHO CAN AFFORD IT 
BECAUSE WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL APPEAL AND WE SAID IT'S FOR ALL AGE GROUPS DIFFERENT UM FUNCTIONS OF IT 
OUR MAIN OBJECTIVES WERE SIMPLICITY AND FASHION 
AND SO UM NO SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OR SOMETHING TO KEEP THE REMOTE FROM GETTING LOST LARGE BUTTONS FOR THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS 
A POSSIBILITY FOR EXTRA FUNCTIONS LIKE A SLIDING A SLIDING PIECE AND A LONG LIFE BATTERY OR A CHARGING STATION 
OKAY NOW THREE PRESENTATIONS 
I'D LIKE TO DO IT IN THIS ORDER FIRST DO THE CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION OF COMPONENTS 
PROPERTIES AND MATERIALS UM AND THEN THE CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION OF USER INTERFACE AND FINALLY TREND WATCHING 
MM 
'KAY 
FUNCTION F. EIGHT IT 
THERE WE GO 
MM 
HMM 
MM 
YEAH I WONDER 
MM-HMM 
JUST AN INTERESTING MARKETING KIND OF ELEMENT 
UH JUST A REAL QUICK QUESTION UM THE WEIGHT OF THESE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS HAVE YOU AN IDEA OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM 'KAY 
THANK YOU PERFECT 
UM IF YOU MADE NOTES YOURSELF YOU CAN PUT THIS ONE OR UM UNDERNEATH OUR UH UH IN YOUR BOOK THEN DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT 
'KAY NOW WE'RE UM CONCEPTS CONCEPTS OF USER INTERFACE 
YEAH UM 
THIS ONE'S SO MUCH TIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE 
OKAY 
NOPE 
THERE WE GO 
HERE YOU ARE 
MM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
I DO THINK THAT UM ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FEATURES FOR A REMOTE IS USING A MENU AND SEEING WHAT'S ON 
UM AND SO LIKE FAVOURITE CHANNELS IS IS APPLICABLE 
BUT I THINK TH THAT YOU DO NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF FUNCTION WHERE IT'S UM YOU HAVE TO YOU CAN USE THE TITLE OF THE SHOW OR POSSIBLY A DESCRIPTION OF IT 
LIKE I I KNOW I SEE THAT OFTEN ENOUGH 
WELL IF IT IF IT WAS A L. L. C. D. ON THE ON THE REMOTE I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD OF THAT YOU'D BE ABLE TO USE A 
OKAY 
OKAY 
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE MORE SPECIFICALLY A DIGITAL BOX MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO MARKET 
MARKETING 
EIGHT 
OOPS IT'S NOT PLUGGED IN QUITE ON WELL ENOUGH 
THERE WE ARE 
MM 'KAY 
S SWEET 
OKAY DO WE HAVE ANY S SOME QUESTIONS FOR THIS LET'S SEE UM 
UM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS HOW TO POSSIBLY USE THIS 
UM HOW TO HOW TO USE A FRUIT OR VEGETABLE OR UM ARE THE SPONGY MATERIAL AT ALL 
LIKE COULD WE MAKE A S LIKE COULD WE MAKE A SPONGY REMOTE 
IT WOULD BE EASIER ON THE HANDS 
IT'S KIND OF AND THEN IT WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO PROTECT LIKE THE CHIP AND ALL THAT I DUNNO 
BUT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
F FOR SURE OR MAYBE LIKE 
UM COUPLE MAIN ONES BEING LIKE I DUNNO LEMONS OR STRAWBERRIES OR SOMETHING 
COULD THEY BE SMELLY 
I DON'T KNOW 
OR CARROT SHAPED MM 
LIKE LARGE BUTTON THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING OF YEAH 
MIGHT WOULD YOU THINK YOU YOU DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE ABLE TO HOLD IT 
'CAUSE I THINK THE REASON THEY'RE LONG AS YEAH 
HARDER TO PUSH 
I USUALLY HOLD IT IN ONE HAND 
MAYBE 
BUT THEN THE BUTTONS WOULD HAVE TO BE VERY SMALL 
DON'T YOU THINK 
BUT I MEAN IN ORDER TO GET IT ALL OF THEM YOU KNOW 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SPACE WITH EACH OTHER 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IT'S A SCROLL YEAH IT'S A WHILE 
THE ONE I HAVE DOESN'T HAVE THE FOR ONE I LIKE AROUND IT I DON'T THINK 
MM 
OKAY UM WE HAVE WE'VE ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES LEFT SO I'M I'M GONNA 
CONTINUE WITH MY PRES PRESENTATION 
UM I'VE NO MORE SLIDE BEFORE WE CLOSE BUT IN THAT SLIDE IS WHEN WE NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THESE THESE KINDS OF THINGS 
SO I'LL JUST BRING THAT UP AND SHOW YOU ALL 
BEFORE WE MOVE ON 
UM 
YEAH AND THEN LIKE THE THE COVERS COULD BE SPONGY LATEX WHEREA BUT THE ACTUAL MODEL COULD BE TITANIUM 
AH HMM-HMM HMM 
OKAY UM COMPONENTS CONCEPT 
ENERGY CHIP ON PRINT 
THAT'S THE THE THIS IS THE AGENDA THEY GAVE ME 
SO CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS REAL QUICK 
MM-HMM 
I THINK IT'S AWESOME 
I THINK IT'S REALLY COOL 
OKAY 
IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE REALLY OPTIONS 
OKAY 
UM OKAY THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE CASE 
UM UH B I GUESS MAYBE IF WE DECIDED ON LIKE A SIMPLE A REGULAR OR AN ADVANCED CHIP MAYBE 
IT WOULD BE NICE FOR CHANGING THE VOLUME BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW USEFUL IT'D BE FOR CHANGING THE CHANNEL 
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER NUMBERS OR 
WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT FOR THE MEETING SO 
SO HAVE A SCROLL FOR VOLUME 
IF 
UM 
I THINK WE WILL I THINK WHEN WE GO ON TO THE UNE USERFACE 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DECIDE THE INTERFACE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DECIDE UM WHETHER WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SCROLL ARE NOT 
OKAY LET'S DO CASE 
I'M A LITTLE UM I'M A LITTLE HESITANT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT PROTECTING THE STUFF ON THE INSIDE 
UM 
YEAH I WOULD BE MORE OKAY WITH LIKE A TITANIUM ACTUAL THING AND THEN MAYBE LIKE A MOBILE PHONE KIND OF THING 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
GE O 
OKAY 
SO WE UH WE DO WANT LATEX 
OKAY 
LATEX 
UM AND PROBABLY AN COLOURS MAYBE FRUITY VEGETABLE COLOURS 
FRUITY COLOURS 
OKAY UM LET'S GO TO THE OF USER INTERFACE THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE CHIP I SUPPOSE 
WELL WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS RIGHT 
YEAH 
UM OKAY INTERFACE THE TYPE AND THE SUPPLEMENTS 
SO PUSH OR SCROLL RIGHT 
OR BOTH 
MM-HMM 
AND IF WE HAD A SEC ON ON SCREEN UM KIND OF THING THAT YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH LIKE YOU CAN USE YOUR BUTTONS TO SCROLL THROUGH THINGS 
I THINK THAT YEAH 
FOR CHANNEL SURFING I THINK A SCROLL AN ACTUAL LIKE AN IPOD'S KIND OF SCROLL THING WOULD BE TOO FAST I DUNNO 
MM-HMM 
SO THAT OKAY WITH YOU 
HOW YOU FEELING 
MM-HMM 
IT MIGHT BE COOL ENOUGH 
OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA GO WITH UM TYPE PUSHBUTTONS AND THEN SUPPLEMENTS HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT 
UM I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT ELSE WE'RE GONNA LOOK UH UH THE UM THE ADDITIONAL BUTTONS WE CAN SEE 
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE A MENU BUTTON IS THAT WE CAN ACCESS ON SCREEN THINGS THEN 
OKAY UM SO WE'RE DOING ON ON SCREEN MENU THAT WE CAN SCROLL THROUGH 
PRE SET CHANNELS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA NEED UM NUMBERS ONE THROUGH ZERO RIGHT 
WELL BUT IN ORDER TO PRE SET A CH UH I GUESS YOU CAN JUST HOLD IT DOWN WHEN YOU GET IT IN WHEN YOU'RE SCROLLING THROUGH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY UM FINISHING THE MEETING NOW 
UM OUR NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES UM YOU EACH HAVE THINGS TO DO LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
PRODUCT EVALUATION AND YOU TWO ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON A PROTOTYPE USING MODELLING CLAY 
YOU'LL GET SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR PERSONAL COACH 
UM DID WE DECIDE ON A CHIP 
LET'S GO WITH A SIMPLE CHIP 
OKAY 
WE ARE DONE 
THANK YOU EVERYONE 
UH I D THESE ARE ALREADY IN OUR SHARED FOLDER SO 
MM YEAH 
OKAY 
THAT WOULD BE UM 
ALRIGHT 
WELL 
ALRIGHT 
UM I'M VERY EXCITED BY THIS ONE ACTUALLY GUYS I UH HAD A LOT OF FUN DOING IT 
COMPONENTS DESIGN 
THIS IS WHERE YOU LOOK AT WHAT DOES IT TOOK TO MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL AND WHAT SHOULD WE MAKE OUR SPECIFIC REMOTE CONTROL OUT OF 
UM 
SO WE NEED TO EXAMINE EACH ELEMENT SEPARATELY BUT WE'RE DESIGNING A FULL THING SO YOU WANNA KEEP IT INTEGRATED AS A WHILE 
THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF REMOTE CONTROLS IN GENERAL AND THEREFORE OURS AS WELL 
OR THE CASE THE BUTTONS THE CIRCUIT BOARD WITH THE CHIP AND THE BATTERY 
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE HAD SORT OF ADDRESSED BEFORE 
BUT I'M GONNA TAKE EACH IN A LITTLE BIT SEPARATELY HERE SO WE FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE MADE OF AND WHAT THEY SHOULD LOOK LIKE 
THE CASE UH THE OPTIONS THAT I'VE GOTTEN FROM HEADQUARTERS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO UM THERE'S THERE'S THE SHAPE OF A CASE 
WE COULD DO A FLAT SH A FLAT CASE A CURVED CASE OR MAYBE EVEN A DOUBLE DOUBLE CURVED CASE 
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY PICTURES OF WHAT THIS EXACTLY LOOKS LIKE YET JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND 
BUT THOSE ARE THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE FROM MANUFACTURING AND WE CAN MAKE OUR CASE OUT OF PLASTIC 
THE UM THE MAIN BASE WILL BE PLASTIC BUT WE HAVE ALL THESE SORT OF FASHION AND TECHNOLOGICAL ELEMENTS WE CAN ADD ONE 
WOOD LATEX TITANIUM RUBBER OR OTHER COLOURED TYPES OF PLASTIC 
THAT WOULD BE OUR CASE 
UM BUTTONS FOR BUTTONS WE HAVE UM PUSHBUTTONS WHICH IS WHAT REAL REACTION USES THE MOST OFTEN 
BUT WE ALSO HAVE SCROR SCROLL WHEELS WHICH CAN HAVE INTEGRATED PUSHBUTTONS OR WE COULD GO ALL HIGH TECH AND HAVE AN L. L. C. D. SCREEN 
UM CIRCUIT BOARD AND CHIP WE CAN HAVE A SIMPLE IN A REGULAR ONE OR AN ADVANCED ONE DEPENDING ON WHAT ARE THERE NEEDS ARE 
AND THEN BATTERY I THINK SO WHERE THINGS GET MOST EXCITING 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LONG LIFE BATTERIES HERE 
UM WE CAN WE CAN HAVE YOUR SORT OF BASIC DOUBLE A. BATTERIES BUT WE ALSO HAVE THESE OPTIONS OF UM USING A KINETIC BATTERY 
LIKE ARE USED IN HIGH TECH WATCHES WHERE YOU JUST HAVE TO MOVE IT A LITTLE BIT TO GET TO TO POWER UP 
UM SO SIMPLE MOVEMENTS LIKE PUSHING BUTTONS WOULD RECHARGE THE BATTERY 
OR A SOLAR BATTERY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SLIGHT UM COMPLICATIONS WITH SOLAR BATTERIES SO NO WE CAN'T USE A LATEX CASE IF WE HAVE A SOLAR BATTERY 
OR UM SOMETHING THEY ONLY DESCRIBED USE THE TYPE OF BATTERY YOU FIND IN TORCHES FROM ABOUT FIFTY YEARS AGO FLASHLIGHTS 
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THAT IS BUT THAT'S THE DESCRIPTION THAT I RECEIVED SO THAT'S WHAT I'M PASSING ON IT YOU 
SO THESE ARE OUR OPTIONS 
UM PERSONAL PREFERENCES THAT I WAS THINKING THROUGH HERE'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL THROUGH FASHION AND SIMPLICITY 
SO IF WE'RE GOING FOR FASHION IN OUR CASES 
I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE GONNA WANNA LOOK AT IS A CURVED OR A DOUBLE CURVED CASE PROBABLY WITH A VARIETY OF DESIGN ELEMENTS 
MAYBE TITANIUM MAYBE SOME WOOD 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THAT BETTER WHEN I GET SPECIFICS OF THE ACTUAL MATERIALS BUT THAT'S SORT OF WHAT I HAVE IN MIND 
AND WE WANNA GO FOR SIMPLICITY 
PROBABLY PUSHBUTTONS BUT I'M SORT OF INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA OF A SCROLL SCROLL WHEEL IF ANYONE HAS ANYTHING 
ANY IDEAS ON THAT 
I MEAN I KNOW THE IPODS AND THINGS RIGHT NOW HAVE TOUCH SCROLL UM BUTTONS WHICH ARE EXACTLY LIKE WHAT THEY'RE DESCRIBING 
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE WANNA LOOK INTO 
AND I'M REALLY INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA OF A KINETIC BATTERY 
SOLAR I DON'T THINK WOULD BE SUCH A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE HOW OFTEN ARE YOU SURE THAT YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WILL GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LIGHT 
BUT THIS IDEA OF THE KINETIC THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPLACE AND THAT A SIMPLE JUST SHAKING IT AROUND WILL MAKE IT WORK 
I THINK THAT THAT UM WOULD BE A VERY INTERESTING THING 
BUT I THINK WE'D ALSO WANNA GO FOR E A SIMPLE CHIP OR REGULAR CHIP TO KEEP OUR COSTS DOWN 
UH WE REALLY ONLY NEED A REGULAR OR ADVANCED CHIP IT IF WE'RE GONNA START USING AN L. C. D. 
SO I THINK WE WANT TO BE AWARE OF NOT MAKING THINGS OVERLY T 
TECHNOLOGICAL IF THEY DON'T NEED TO BE 'CAUSE THAT'LL KEEP OUR MANUFACTURING PRICE WAY DOWN 
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE FOR OPTIONS 
UM I'D APPRECIATE ANYONE'S INPUT BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M USING FOR THE FEATURE OF THE THE LOOK OF THIS THING 
I'M NOT SURE 
I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY SPECIFIC 
VISUALS OF THIS YET 
THIS IS WHAT I'M SORT OF 
YEAH 
I'M NOT SURE BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS I GOT ANY PICTURES 
I KNOW IF WE DO HAVE A DOUBLE CURVED CASE IT CAN'T HAVE ANY TITANIUM ON IT 
BUT THE TITANIUM THEY WERE QUITE THEY'RE MARKETING QUITE HARD TO USE AS BEING USED IN THE SPACE PROGRAMME IS THAT COULD BE QUITE INTERESTING 
SPACE AGE REMOTE 
JUST ALL THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND 
YEAH 
THAT'S ABOUT ALL I HAVE TO DO GUYS 
I HOPE I DIDN'T GO THROUGH THAT IT QUICKLY 
YEAH NO NO IDEA NO IDEA 
UM 
I'M ASSUMING 
THAT A KINETIC BATTERY ISN'T GONNA TAKE UP THAT MUCH WEIGHT AND THAT A TITA TITANIUM IS VERY LIGHT I KNOW 
UM BUT THERE THEN THAT'S REALLY BASIC I MEAN THAT'S ALL I HAVE GOTTEN SO FAR 
ALRIGHT 
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS 
NO 
OKAY 
I HAVE SAVE THIS IN THE UH SHARED PROJECTS IF ANYONE WANTS TO LOOK AND I HAVE C CONSIDERABLE NOTES ON THE TOPIC AS WELL 
IF ANYONE NEEDS ANY MORE INFORMATION 
OH 
JUST IN MY NOTEBOOK BUT IF ANYONE HAS ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS DON'T HESITATE TO EMAIL UM OR SOMETHING 
ALRIGHT 
UH I GUESS I CAN 
I KNOW 
GO OH GEEZ 
HMM 
HMM 
SO YOU'D BE ADVOCATING AN L. C. D. THEN 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
WELL 
OR YOU ARE YOU TAKE 
YEAH 
NO I THINK I THINK WE'RE TALKING MENU LIKE CONTRAST AND TUNING THE V. C. R. OR SOMETHING IF I'VE UNDERSTOOD YOU CORRECTLY RATHER THAN MEN SO WHAT'S ON 
OH GOOD POINT 
YEAH 
NO SIGNAL 
UP THERE WE GO 
OKAY 
THAT THERE'S ALL KINDS OF SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION IN THAT ONE THOUGH 
IF IT'S LATEX IF IT'S LATEXY 
UM MENU 
NO UH I IF THE MY UNDERSTANDING OF A LATEX CASE IS THAT IT'S IN FACT HARD TO PROTECT STUFF INSIDE 
BUT THAT IT'S COVERED WITH THE LATEX WHICH IS SPONGIER AND SOFTER ON YOUR HANDS 
IT'S THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE USED I MEAN WE WE GET THAT THING EARLIER FROM YOU ABOUT UM NOT WANTING TO IT 
R. R. REPETITIVE STRESS INJURIES AND THINGS AND AND 
YEAH SOMETHING GRIPPABLE I MEAN WE DON'T WE DON'T WE DON'T WANNA GO SPONGY MAYBE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I THINK THAT GIVEN THE LIST OF MATERIALS I W I WAS FORWARDED IT'S THAT SEEMS DOABLE 
COULD WE GO IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COLOURS 
WE COULD COLOUR CO ORDINATE THEM LI 
THE BUTTONS COULD BE FRUIT SHAPED 
UH WELL IT'S QUITE EASY TO USE SHAPE THING LIKE CARROT ISN'T IT 
OR MAYBE THE BUTTONS COULD BE SHAPED LIKE DIFFERENT FRUITS 
B YEAH 
IT'D BE HARDER TO F BE UH BUTTONS I THINK 
IT'D BE HARDER TO PRESS BUTTON 
UM 
I 
YEAH THAT'S TS HOW I TEND TO DO IT 
NO JUST THUMB SIZED 
JUS 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
RIGHT 
I WHEN I'M WHEN I'M PRESSING BUTTONS ON MY IPOD THAT'S HOW I DO TO HOLD IT AND PRESS THE FOUR 
YEAH 
YEAH OR ONE AND SO MY THUMB OR MY POINTER FINGER IN THE TOUCH SCROLL WHEEL 
YEAH 
IT WEL WELL YEAH IT WOULD I MEAN EACH VERSION OF IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT 
OH YEAH YOU HAD ONE OF THE IN BETWEEN ONES WHEN THEY WEREN'T DOING THAT ANYMORE 
TS AND YOU PRESS THE CENTRE BUTTON THAT'S THAT'S YOUR ALL PURPOSE SELECT BUTTON RIGHT THERE 
SINCE IT'S THE IN IN THE CENTRE THAT'S NOT MARKED YEAH 
YEAH 
UH UH IT 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK AN L. C. D. SCREEN MIGHT BE GOOD IN THEORY BUT NOT IS USEFUL IN PRACTICE 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
UM 
UH WE PROBABLY HAVE TO GET GOING DON'T WE 
'KAY 
COULD 
COULD WE UH COULD WE HAVE CHANGEABLE COVERS LIKE FOR YOUR MOBILE 
IN DIFFERENT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COLOURS YEAH 
EXACTLY 
AND YOU COULD CO ORDINATE WITH YOUR HOUSE OR WHATEVER 
ALL THESE OPTIONS 
OH 
OH 
YEAH 
MM 
OPTIONS 
UH UH UH UH YES 
RIGHT I HAD SORT OF SKIPPED OVER THAT HOPING IT WOULDN'T GET 
BE NECESSARY BUT UM 
ALRIGHT SO UM DECISIONS WHAT THE OKAY DECI DECISIONS ON ENERGY I'M THINKING IS BASED ON THE BATTERY 
UM I DUNNO WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THIS KINETIC BATTERY IDEA 
UM I 
YEAH 
YEAH 
RIGHT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY YEAH ANY MORE INFORMATION ON COST OTHER THAN IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A REGULAR BATTERY 
BUT UM BUT IF WE'RE USING A ONE I A CHEAPER CHIP THEN IT'LL EVEN IT I THINK 
UM CIRCUIT BOARDS 
UM YEAH I GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF INFORMATION ON HOW CIRCUIT BOARDS ARE PRODUCED 
THEY'RE THEY'RE THIN FIBREGLASS WITH COPPER WIRES ETCHED ON TO THEM AND DO I THINK THEY'RE QUITE EASILY PRINTED ON BY MACHINE 
WHICH IS CHIP ON PRINT IS WHERE THE MACHINE PRINTS ON THE WIRES AND SOLDERS IT ALL TOGETHER FOR US 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU AS FAR AS DECISIONS 
I WASN'T REALLY GIVEN ANY OPTIONS I WAS JUST GIVEN THAT THIS IS HOW THEY'RE DONE 
UM 
YEAH I CAN'T CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU 
I CAN I CAN TELL YOU A WHOLE LOT ABOUT HOW IT WORKS 
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY DECISIONS ON 
YEAH 
I'M SORRY I DID F 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
WELL OKAY HERE'S THE HERE'S THE THING IN THE CHIPS THAT I THAT I GOT 
UM SIMPLE REGULAR ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT 
THE CHIP ON PRINT INCLUDES AN INFRARED SENSOR SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT 
UM 
'KAY THE PUSHBUTTON IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE PUSHBUTTONS THEY REQUIRE A SIMPLE CHIP BUT A SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRES A REGULAR CHIP AND AN L. C. D. REQUIRES ADVANCED 
DO WE WANT A SCROLL WHEEL OR DO WE JUST WANT PUSHBUTTONS 
OH 
YEAH TH IT'D BE IT'D BE HANDY FOR GOING THROUGH IF THERE WAS ON ON SCREEN MENU OF YOUR CHANNEL CHOICES THEN YOU CAN SCROLL DOWN ON THE SCROLL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
OF OUR FOR ALL THOSE SECRET FUNCTIONS 
WHEN YOU GET IN THE ON SCREEN MENU OF ALL YOUR FUNCTIONS THAT YOUR REMOTE COULD DO FOR YOU WITHOUT THE BUTTONS AND YOU COULD HAVE A SCROLL WHEEL TO GO THROUGH THIS MEANS 
RIGHT 
SO WE COULD EITHER GO WITH A SIMPLE OR A REGULAR CHIP DEPENDING AND MAYBE WE COULD TABLE THAT DECISION FOR LATER 
I DON'T KNOW 
OKAY 
WELL LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT WHILE WE TALK ABOUT THE CASE 
UH I'M KINDA LIKING THE IDEA OF LATEX IF IF SPONGY IS THE ONE THING 
OKAY 
OH YEAH EVERYTHING I'VE 
NO UH WHA WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE SEEN JUST NOT RELATED TO THIS BIT OF LATEX CASES BEFORE 
SO THAT THERE'S UH LIKE A HARD PLASTIC INSIDE AND IT'S JUST COVERED WITH THE LATEX 
NOT TOO THICK A LAYER OF LATEX JUST ENOUGH TO BE GRIPPABLE LIKE BIKE HANDLES OR OR ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE SEEN LIKE THAT 
THE INSIDE IS HARD 
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT PROTECTING THE CIRCUIT BOARD I THINK THAT THAT'S DONE FOR US 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH AND WE WANT A CURVED CASE YEAH 
OR A DOUBLE CURVED 
YEAH OKAY 
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE 
GOOD POINT 
YEAH 
I SAY PUSHBUTTONS AT LEAST UNLESS WE GET ANY INFORMATION BUT I HAVE AN IDEA HOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE A SCROLL WHEEL IS THEN THEN A PUSHBUTTON 
BUT IT'S GOTTA BE SOME MORE EXPENSIVE SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO PUT OUR MONEY INTO THE STUFF LIKE THE KINETIC BATTERY AND THE COOL CASE 
BECAUSE 
YEAH 
OH 
ALRIGHT 
SO WHAT ARE WHAT ARE ARE BUTTONS GONNA BE 
ON OFF 
SO LIKE ONE THROUGH FIVE EURO 
NO 
MM 
YEAH UP DOWN 
OH 
SIMPLE CHIP 
OKAY COOL 
CLAY 
FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX 
SO DOUBLE CURVED LIKE WOULD BE LIKE TWO HANDS KIND OF THING 
OKAY 
'CAUSE I'M IMAGINING LIKE DOUBLE CURVED IS LIKE YOU KNOW 
LIKE TWO SIDES THAT CURVE AND THEN LIKE ONE CURVE WOULD JUST BE LIKE A SINGLE VERTICAL ISH KIND OF LOOKING THING BUT I'VE NO IDEA 
SOUNDS GOOD 
THANKS 
WAIT BUT IS THAT SEPARATE FROM WHAT HE WAS SAYING 
SHOULD I PLUG THAT ONE 
MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT SO IT IN 
OR WHAT F. DO YOU HAVE TO PRESS FIVE 
I JUST KEEP PRESSING LOTS OF 'EM 
WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW RELEVANT ALL OF THIS GONNA BE 
IF ANYTHING THA THAT THEY GAVE ME 
ALRIGHT 
OH YEAH 
OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA LIKE A LITTLE BIT AT TREND WATCHING 
BASICALLY I WAS GIVEN UM AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THAT WAS A MARKET INVESTIGATION ON REMOTE CONTROLS THAT WAS RECENTLY CONDUCTED 
AND THEN ALSO SOME FASHION WATCHERS IN PARIS AND MILAN COMMENTED ON SOME THINGS THAT ARE GONNA BE GOING ON THIS YEAR 
SO FIRST UM THEY HAD PEOPLE THEY RANKED UM THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND RIGHT NOW I D THEY'RE SAYING THAT CURRENTLY THERE'S A FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL PREFERENCE 
BUT THAT REALLY OVER THE NEXT YEAR IT IT THAT'S GONNA BE SWITCHING IT FANCY LOOK AND FEEL REMOTES SO THAT JUST GOES BACK TO 
THE WHOLE DESIRE OF OUR C REAL REACTION COMPANY WANTING TO FOCUS ON FASHION AND SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE STRESSING WHEN WE'RE TALKING 
WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS LIKE SIMPLICITY AND EASY TO USE IDEA 
THEY'RE SORT OF WANTING US TO REMEMBER THAT THE NUMBER ONE THING FOR EVERYONE IS THAT IT'S FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
AND SO THESE ARE RANKED THE TOP ONE IS DOUBLY IMPORTANT TO THE SECOND ONE 
WHICH IS DOUBLY IMPORTANT TO THE THIRD ONE IS JUST TO TAKE THAT WEIGHT INTO ACCOUNT 
THE SECOND THING THAT WAS MENTIONED AS IMPORTANT WAS THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS 
THAT WOULD BE LIKE IF WE USE SOMETHING LIKE THE SPACE MATERIAL OR THE L. C. D. SCREEN THINGS LIKE THAT 
AND THEN USE OF US WAS THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT WHO IS REALLY 
NO MATTER WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS THE MOST IN FANCY LOOK AND FEEL ACCORDING TO THIS 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE AGREE WITH THAT 
AND THEN THE FASHION WATCH TALKS ABOUT THAT THIS YEAR'S TOP TREND FOR CLOTHES 
SHOES AND FURNITURE IS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND THE THAT THERE'S A PREFERENCE FOR SPONGY TIGHT MATERIAL 
AND SO THAT BRINGS US TO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
WHO WANTS A SPONGY REMOTE OR IN WITH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PADDING 
PERSONALLY I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT I WANT ONE THAT'S GONNA GO OUT OF STYLE OR GO STALE EXCUSE THE PEN UM IN A YEAR IS 
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS COMING FROM US AS YOU KNOW TREND WATCH MARKET RESEARCH I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT WE NECESSARILY WANNA TAKE AWAY 
ALSO CONSIDERING THAT THE D RESEARCH B HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT BY REAL REACTION I'M A LITTLE HESITANT AS IT LIKE 
HOW THESE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN WORDED AND IF NECESSARILY THIS WHOLE FASHION TO TECHNOLOGY Y EDAS EASE OF US IS NECESSARILY THE RIGHT RANKING 
PERSONALLY LIKE I MIGHT REVERSE IT BUT IF WE'RE WORKING FOR THIS COMPANY THEN I GUESS NO MATTER WHAT WE HAVE TO STRESS FASHION THE MOST 
BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE A SPONGY MATERIAL 
YEAH 
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF NOTES TO SHARE IF YOU WANT THEM THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT UP 
SO YEAH 
YEAH WHAT CAN I POSSIBLY ENLIGHTEN ON 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SO SOMETHING M M INSTEAD OF A NECESS YEAH GRIP I'M THINKING GRIP MORE THAN LIKE SINKING INTO YOUR HANDS 
YOU KNOW I AND I THINK I'M ENVISIONING MORE LIKE 
YOU KNOW THE MATERIAL THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU SIT ON LIKE A BICYCLE SO THAT IT DOESN'T HURT WHEN YOU'RE SITTING DOWN FOR A LONG TIME 
LIKE I'M IMAGINING THAT SORT OF THING I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THAT MATERIAL'S CALLED 
OH GOOD 
WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA OF LIKE A ROUND REMOTE 
INSTEAD OF LIKE A VERTICAL UP AND DOWN ON 
LIKE IN TERMS OF HOLDING IT 
LIKE THAT'S A F SHAPE OF A FRUIT 
JUST TO TO IT IN A LITTLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 'CAUSE OTHERWISE YOUR FINGERS CAN'T MOVE AROUND 
BUT I LIKE I 
I LOVE THE IDEA OF THE WHOLE LIKE THE IPOD 
'CAUSE THE 
IT'S LIKE FIVE 'CAUSE THERE'S NO NO THE MIDDLE 
I THINK WHY IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR US IS 'CAUSE LIKE YOU COULD HAVE THE SAME WHEEL SORT OF EFFECT FOR LIKE CHANNEL FLIPPING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE COULD BE LIKE FOR VOLUME 
LIKE JUST THE IDEA OF LIKE THIS IS FEW BUTTONS FOR MAIN THINGS BUT THEN HOW YOU COULD GO BACK TO THE MENU AND LIKE 
I DUNNO IF WE WOULD WANT IT IN THE SCREEN THERE ARE IN THE ACTUAL T. V. 
I KIND OF UM WANTING TO SAY IN THE T. V. 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE CHANGING THE BRIGHTNESS DON'T YOU WANNA USE IT HAPPENING KIND OF 
AND THEN YOU COULD STILL HAVE THAT AVAILABLE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
IF I GOT ANY MORE INFORMATION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES I'LL LET YOU KNOW 
WELL THERE WE GO 
THE IPOD PACKAGING IS UM LIKE WAS IS THAT WAS LIKE HALF THE FINE 
IT'S LIKE THE WAY TO ALL COMES ALL CUTE 
LEMONS 
YEAH I MEAN IT WOULD 
IT TOTALLY TAKE CARE OF OUR PROBLEM OF NOT WANTING TO CHANGE BATTERIES 
COSTS 
BUT OVER TIME 
YEAH IT'S A 
BUT IF YOU C IF YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH THE CHANNELS AND THEN THE VOLUME WOULD JUST BE 
AND THE VOLUME WOULD JUST BE LIKE THE SAME WAY FORWARD AND BACKWARD AS I'M JUST THINKING LIKE IT WOULD MAKE TOO MUCH LIKE SLEEKER SORT OF LOOKING 
AND OTHERWISE NO MATTER HOW MAY BUTTONS WE HAVE WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE YOU KNOW 
BLACK WITH RED STICKING OUT AND THE NO IT'S GONNA INEVITABLY SORT OF START LOOKING LIKE THIS GROUP OF SORT OF UGLY ONES THAT WE SAW STACKED UP 
UH COULD TO BE HARD AND THEN SOMETHING AROUND IT 
I'M THINKING CURVED OF SOME SORT 
YEAH 
AND LET'S LOOK SO IF WE GET ANYTHING ELSE 
I MEAN I'M NOT LIKE HARD SOLD ON THE SCROLL WHEEL IT'S MORE JUST TO GIVE IT A DIFFERENT KIND OF LIKE 
BUT IF IT'S GONNA BE IN A LATEX TYPE THING AND THAT'S GONNA LOOK COOL THEN THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT THAN THE SCROLL WHEEL 
LIKE A RADIO TYPE SORTA SITUATION 
WOW 
YEP 
UH-HUH 
DON'T THINK SO 
JESUS 
ALRIGHT SO I'M GONNA DESCRIBE THE THE CONCEPT OF THE USER INTERFACE OF THIS DES DEVICE 
UM WE'VE TALKED ABOUT UH THE TWO ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF THE USER INTERFACE 
WE WANT TO TO BE SIMPLE AND WE WANT TO TO BE FASHIONABLE 
UM 
THREE WE'VE ALSO GET TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A DEVICE THAT SERVES AS A USEFUL PURPOSE 
UH WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT IS IS A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE IDEA OF THE DEVICE OR AND MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDE THAT WE'VE INCLUDED ALL OF THIS AND THAT WE ACTUALLY END UP WITH A DEVICE THAT IS GOING TO BE USEFUL TO PEOPLE 
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CHOICES FOR A DESIGN CONCEPT UM AND SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT I'LL SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF UM 
BUT ESSENTIALLY WE NEED TO CHOOSE HOW HOW IS THIS DEVICE GOING TO WORK 
HOW HOW WHAT KIND OF MODEL IS THERE GOING TO BE FOR USER INTERACTION WITH THIS DEVICE 
UH ONCE WE'VE CHOSEN A A CONCEPT FOR IT WE CAN THEN DESIGN THE FEATURES AROUND THE CONCEPT 
MAKING SURE THAT WE GOT ALL THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS ON THE DEVICE AND UH THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS AND THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES 
AND OF COURSE WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE IT LOOK COOL 
SO BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT WE DON'T WANT 
UM WE DON'T WANT LOTS OF BUTTONS UH COMPLICATED FEATURES 
WE WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS NICE AND SIMPLE 
HERE'S A A FAIRLY SIMPLE DEVICE 
THIS IS AN AN IPOD FROM PEOPLE 
UM I THINK THE MAIN THING TO NOTICE ABOUT IT IS IT JUST HAS FOUR BUTTONS 
IT'S VERY MINIMALISTIC IN ITS DESIGN 
UH YOU USE THESE FOUR BUTTONS TO ME TO MOVE AROUND A RANGE OF SETTINGS ON THE SMALL L. C. D. SCREEN 
UM THE THING I LIKE ABOUT THIS IS THAT 
IT'S VERY VERY QUICK TO ACCESS THE MAIN FEATURES 
UH YOU CAN JUST ABOUT MAKE IT UH THAT THE BUTTON THREE BUTTONS ARE UH PREVIOUS TRACK NEXT TRACK AND PLAY PAUSE 
THEY'RE THE MAIN THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE IPOD THE THINGS YOU WILL USE A ALL THE TIME 
UM THEN IF YOU WANT TO DO ANYTHING MORE ADVANCED 
YOU GO INTO THE LITTLE MENU ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND YOU USE THE BUTTONS JUST TO SCROLL AROUND AND AND FIND THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES THAT YOU WANT 
SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD A GOOD KIND OF MODEL THAT WE COULD HAVE 
UM 
HERE'S A ANOTHER EXAMPLE 
THIS IS UH IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA AND I THINK I IT LOOKS PRETTY COOL 
UM IT'S CERTAINLY GOT NOVELTY VALUE 
UH IT'S NICE AND COLOURFUL IT'S NICE AND BRIGHT 
UH IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN KIND OF FEEL YOUR WAY AROUND 
THE BUTTONS ARE ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND AND YOU CAN SORT OF YEAH IF YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. ON THE DARK OR WHATEVER 
YOU CAN WORK OUT WHICH BUTTON'S WHICH AND BASICALLY YEAH IT'S THE IT'S FINE 
SO I I LIKE I LIKE THIS IDEA OF JUST HAVING BUTTONS FOR THE FEATURES THAT YOU USE MOST OFTEN 
SO YOU'D NEED A FEW BUTTONS TO SELECT YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS 
I MEAN MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY WATCH T. V. 
THEY HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY CHANNELS IN THEIR T. V. AND THEY WATCH OF 'BOUT FOUR OF THEM AT THE MOST 
SO YOU HAVE BUTTONS FOR YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL CHANGING THE VOLUME 
WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU DO ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. AND THE BUTTON TO SWITCH IT OFF IN CASE YOU GET BORED 
UM OTHER FEATURES THINGS LIKE ADJUSTING THE BRIGHTNESS TUNING THE T. V. UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU DO WITH A T. V. 
UM BUT THOSE ARE THESE ARE ALL NECESSARY FUNCTIONS 
UH YOU CAN'T HAVE A T THERE'S ONE POINT HAVING A TELEVISION THAT YOU CAN'T TUNE OR THAT YOU CAN'T SET THE CONTRAST 
SO WE NEED TO FIND A WAY OF INCLUDING THESE SOMEHOW 
UM AND ONE OTHER SUGGESTIONS I'D MAKE US TO ONE IS TO INCLUDE IN A MENU SYSTEM A BIT LIKE IN THE IPOD 
SO WE'D EITHER HAVE A SMALL L. C. D. DISPLAY ON THE DEVICE ITSELF 
OR UH HAVE A DOES A MENU DISPLAY THAT COMES UP ON YOUR TELEVISION AND CAN BE BE CONTROLLED THROUGH THE DEVICE 
AND THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO ACCESS ACCESS THE ADVANCED FEATURES UH WHILST KEEPING A VERY SMALL AND SIMPLE SET OF BUTTONS FOR THE FEATURES THAT YOU USE MOST OFTEN 
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ONE WAY TO GO YES 
UM I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES IF YOU IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY IT'S IT'S NICE 
BECAUSE IT'S IT IT LETS YOU JUST SORT OF SIT THERE AND SET AND CONTROL YOUR TELEVISION FROM YOUR ARMCHAIR 
THERE ARE DISADVANTAGES AN AN L. C. D. DISPLAY WOULD HAVE TO BE QUITE SMALL 
'CAUSE WE'RE WE'RE I WILL WE'RE I ASSUME WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING QUITE A SMALL DEVICE 
UM IT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO HAVE UH A KIND OF BACKLIGHTING IN IT 
'CAUSE YOU TEN YOU TEND TO WATCH T. V. ON THE DARK BUT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE YOUR L. D. D. L. C. D. DISPLAY 
THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO HAVE A ONE ON SCREEN DISPLAY ON YOUR TELEVISION THAT YOU CONTROL THROUGH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
OH 
A BIT LIKE A BIT LIKE HOW THEY HAVE THIS UM DIGITAL BOXES WHERE YOU YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS AND IT COMES UP WITH YOUR THIS THING OF WATCH LO WHAT'S ON EACH CHANNEL 
I MEAN THAT THAT'S ALSO A GOOD IDEA 
IT'S IT CAN IT DOES HAVE IT'S PROBLEMS AS WELL 
IF YOU'VE GOT A SMALL T. V. AND YOU'RE SITTING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A ROOM IT'S HARD TO READ THE LITTLE TEXT THAT COMES UP 
UH BUT THAT'S A THAT'S A DESIGN DECISION THAT WE CAN MAKE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE FEATURES YES 
BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING TO BEAR IN MIND IS THAT IF WE PUT A DISPLAY ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
THE C UH COMMUNICATION IS NO WAY AS YOU CAN'T HAVE THE TELEVISIONS AND INFORMATION BACK TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AT LEAST I DON'T THINK YOU CAN 
UM I'M NOT SURE 
SO THAT GOING ON 
OKAY 
UH THAT SHOULD BE ALRIGHT ACTUALLY 
A KIND OF THING THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I SEE IT SUPPOSED TO BE SHAPED LIKE A VEGETABLE 
UH LIKE UH I DUNNO LIKE UH CARROTS OR SOMETHING 
MAYBE OR 
KIND OF LIKE A POTATO 
YEAH 
DEPENDS 
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU USE A REMOTE DO YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR THUMB USUALLY 
OR YOUR FINGERS 
OR MAYBE YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S SHAPED LIKE A MOBILE PHONE SO YOU YOU HOLD IT IN ONE HAND AND YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR THUMB 
YEAH 
MAYBE 
BUT IF YOU'VE ONLY GOT LIKE FOUR OR FIVE BUTTONS ANYWAY THEN IT'S IT'S NOT AS MUCH A PROBLEM PERHAPS 
SO YOU HOLD IT IN ONE HAND AND YOU PRESS YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR THUMB AND 
AND YOU FIND THAT WORKS QUITE WELL 
SO THAT THE BUTTON ON AN IPOD IS IT WHAT IS IT IS IT JUST FOUR BUTTONS OR IS IT LIE MORE LIKE A SCROLL THING 
RIGHT 
UH I SEE RIGHT YEAH 
OH OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S QUITE A GOOD DESIGN 
YEAH 
I THINK IT COULD BE DIFFICULT IN PRACTICE YEAH 
ALSO Z YEAH 'CAUSE YOU WOULD BE Z LOOKING DOWN TO THE L. C. D. SCREEN THAN BACK UP TO YOUR T. V. AND PEOPLE DON'T WANNA DO THAT 
LIKE TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT FRUITS 
YEAH IT'S POSSIBLE 
I THINK MAYBE THE THE PACKAGING IT SHOULD BE LIKE A LEMON AND THE THE PACKAGING IS LIKE THE PLA 
SO INSTEAD OF OPENING THE BOX YOU JUST KIND OF PEEL IT AND THE REMOTE CONTROL'S INSIDE 
DON'T KNOW 
YEAH UM I THINK IT'S GOOD AS AS LONG AS WE CONSIDER THE THE COST AND THE UH HOW RELIABLE IT IS 
BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOOD 
AL ALL CIRCUIT BOARDS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME I THINK 
UH IT'S FAIRLY FAIRLY STANDARD 
UM 
I DON'T THINK WE IN REALLY NEED THE SCROLL WHE WHEEL 
I MEAN IT MIGHT BE NICE FOR CHANGING THE VOLUME 
UH BUT 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD REALLY WORK 
YEAH YOU REALLY NEED BUTTONS FOR CHANGING A CHANNEL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK YEAH I THINK A SCROLL WHEEL WOULD BE NICE BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY 
UM 
YEAH 
'KAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
YEP 
UM 
AND I THINK IF WE WANNA KEEP OUR COSTS DOWN WE SHOULD JUST GO FOR PUSHBUTTONS 
'CAUSE THEN WE CAN HAVE A A SIMPLE CHIP AND IT'S SIMPLER IT'S IT'S CHEAPER TO MAKE PUSHBUTTONS THAN TO USE A SCROLL BUTTON 
SO IN TERMS OF UH IN TERMS OF UH ECONOMICS IT'S PROBABLY BETTER TO HAVE PUSHBUTTONS 
YEAH YEAH IT'S UH IT'S IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
INTERESTING 
YEP 
UH WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SUPPLEMENTS EXACTLY 
UM 
YEP 
YEAH 
UM ONE 
YEAH 
ON OFF UH VOLUME FAVOURITE CHANNELS UH AND MINE 
YEAH YEAH BUT YEAH LIKE YEAH A BIT LIKE RADIO PRESETS 
UM 
UH WE WOULDN'T EVEN NEED THE NUMBERS 
I THINK MAYBE NUMBERS SEEMS IS KIND OF OLD FASHIONED 
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN JUST AND YOU NEED SOME KIND OF I DUNNO 
SORT OF UP DOWN KIND OF BUTTON BUT THE VOLUME CONTROL COULD DOUBLE FOR THAT FOR EXAMPLE 
COOL 
YEP 
CLAY 
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT 
OKAY UM 
WELCOME TO OUR DETAILED DESIGN MEETING 
I'M PRETTY EXCITED 
LET'S START IT'S APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN FORTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OKAY UM THE AGENDA WE'RE GONNA DO AN OPENING AND THEN UM I'LL TALK ABOUT THE MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING 
WHAT WE D DISCUSSED UM THEN WE'LL HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION AND A LOOK AT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA 
WE'LL LOOK AT THE FINANCES AND FINALLY A D A PRODUCTION EVALUATION AND CLOSE 
SO STARTING OFF WITH THE UM LOST THE LAST ONE UH I DON'T HAVE TO HERE UM BUT WE TALKED ABOUT ENERGY 
WE'RE GONNA USE A KINETIC BATTERY UM WE WANT TO USE A SIMPLE CHIP BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA NEED A A SHUFFLE UM 
WE'RE GONNA NEED A SCROLL UM 
WE'RE CHOOSING A LATEX CASE WE IN FRUITY COLOURS THAT'S CURVED AND UM WE'RE USING PUSH BUTTONS UH WITH A SUPPLEMENT OF ONE ON SCREEN MENU 
AND IT SOUNDED LIKE WE HAD SET UM LIKE EIGHT OR NINE BUTTONS INCLUDING FIVE PRE SET CHANNELS 
OKAY 
LET'S DO THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN PRESENTATION FIRST 
LIKE A LITTLE LIGHTNING IN IT 
THE LITTLE LIGHTNING BOLT ON IT VERY CUTE 
THE V THE RHOMBUS RHOMBUS 
UM ON OFF 
OKAY 
YEAH WE TURN IT OFF 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
VERY INTERESTING 
I THINK THAT ONE'S MY FAVOURITE 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
NOW THAT WAS ONE THING THAT WE BROUGHT UP OVER EMAIL 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU PICKED UP YOUR EMAIL ABOUT UM THE OF THE UM AFTER THAT WE CONSIDERED FOR IT INTO GETTING LOST 
MM-HMM 
IT'S REALLY 
WOULD TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ME JUST HAVE AN EXTERNAL DEVICE THAT LIKE I DUNNO 
YOU TAPE TO YOUR TO YOUR T. V. UM THAT WHEN YOU PRESS IT YOU UH A LITTLE LIGHT BEEP GOES OFF 
DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE CONCEPTUALLY POSSIBLE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
THAT'S TRUE MM 'KAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY THAT'S A FAIR EVALUATION 
GETTING LOST 
UM WE SO WE DO WE'VE DECIDED NOT TO WORRY ABOUT THAT FOR NOW 
OKAY 'CAUSE WELL THE DESIGNS ARE VERY BRIGHT SO YOU'RE RIGHT THEY'RE GONNA STICK IT BUT UM 
MM-HMM 
COULD WE MAYBE HAVE LIKE AN EXTRA BUTTON ON THE TAPE FREE ON OFF 
SO THEN WE WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE LIKE A DUAL FUNCTION 
SURE 
UM UH WHY DON'T WE DO A PRODUCT EVALUATION USING YOUR CRITERIA IF YOU'VE DEVELOPED SOME 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
DO YOU NEED THOSE ARE JUST WRITE ON THE WHITE BOARD 
OKAY 
IT'S KIND OF LIKE UH LIKE A JOYSTICK KIND OF THING YOU KNOW KINDA PUSH IT 
'KAY 
MAYBE A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THAT 
UH IT DOES IT'S KIND OF LIKE 
THERE IT COULD HAVE A STEM LIKE THAT 'CAUSE I DO L KIND OF LIKE THE STEM 
YEAH 
IT ALMOST HELPS YOU GE KEEP A GRIP TOO 'CAUSE IT GOES IN BETWEEN FINGERS 
I LIKE THIS ONE 
VARIETY OF COLOURS ARE NICE 
I THINK I'M LEANING TOWARDS THE POTATO 
MM-HMM 
I AM WORRIED ABOUT LIKE UM USING A MENU 
UM IN THAT LIKE I WITHING MENUS THERE ARE SUBMENUS AND SEE HOW DO YOU GET BACK TO THE MAIN MENU 
BUT THAT HAS A MENU BUTTON SEPARATE FROM A SELECT BUTTON WHEREAS IF THIS ONE'S BOTH THE MENU AND THE SELECT BUTTON 
OKAY 
COULD THESE BE USED FOR GOING TO SUBMENUS OR 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
WELL AS LONG AS WE HAVE THAT IN MIND SO WE'RE DESIGNING IT STILL MM 'KAY 
I THINK SO 
I I KIND OF THINK IT'S IT'S UNIQUE ENOUGH THAT I'D GIVE IT A ONE OR A TWO 
OKAY 
I WILL GIVE IT A ONE 
UM FUNCTIONAL 
I THINK IT'LL GET EVERYTHING DONE I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE CONFUSING AT FIRST UM I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GONNA BE A LATER ON 
OKAY THEN I'M GONNA GIVE IT A TWO 
DID YOU GIVE A FUNCTIONAL 
OKAY 
WELL THE KINETIC BATTERY 
BUT THEY'LL NOTICE IT AFTER LIKE A YEAR THEY'LL BE LIKE HEY I HAVE NEVER CHANGED THE BATTERY 
MM 
JUST THE MATERIAL 
THINK I'M GONNA GO WITH THE FAR AS WELL 
I REALLY LIKE THAT KINETIC BATTERY THOUGH 
MM 'KAY 
UH LET'S SAY TWO 
GIVE IT A ONE 
MM 
'CAUSE THERE WOULD BE LESS IMPACT MAYBE 
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH CORPORATE COLOUR 
WE DIDN'T KEEP THAT ONE UM WELL IF WE I KNOW IT WOULD MAKE IT A LITTLE LESS C A LITTLE MORE CONFUSING 
BUT IF WE HAD ALL THE BUTTONS IN BLACK AND A DESIGN IN AND THE OUTSIDE IN YELLOW 
THAT'D BE OUR CORPORATE ONE AND WE COULD ALSO HAVE ALTERNATIVE COLOURS ON A MORE CONSERVATIVE ONE ONE THAT'S MORE FRUITY 
UM AND CAN WE HAVE LIKE AN R. R. INSCRIBED ON THE BOTTOM OR SOMETHING 
OKAY 
FORTY SO FRUITY 
I THINK I IT'S KIND OF MANGOEY TOO 
YES 
MM 
NO 
MM-HMM 
YES 
IT'S GONNA BE HARD 
AND IF IT'S REPETITIVE MOVEMENT IT IS GONNA BE ONLY FOUR BUTTONS THAT YOU'RE CONSTANTLY PUSHING BUT UM 
I LIKE HOW IT FITS IN THE HAND THOUGH SO I I'D GO WITH A TWO 
MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
I THINK I'D GIVE IT A FOR IT 
IT'S A PRETTY HIGH LEARNING CURVE IT'LL BE EASY ONCE YOU'VE DONE IT BUT 
W W I THINK WE CAN KIND OF SAY WE ADDRESSED IT WITH COLOUR BUT 
MM-HMM 
MM I'D GIVE IT A FOUR 
SMALL IT 
THERE 
IT'S TOTALLY FASHIONABLE 
I'D GIVE IT A ONE 
MANGO 
I DO LIKE UH THE LITTLE MARTIAN ONE 
NO 
MM-HMM 
I THINK AS LONG IF WE OFFER IN A ONE AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT COLOUR ARRANGEMENTS 
UM YEAH THAT'S GOOD 
SO I'LL GIVE IT A A TWO 
WELL UM WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T ADDRESS THE FACT THAT IT DOES NEED TO BE HAVE A CORPORATE LOGO 
SO LET'S LET'S MAKE SURE WE KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT WE UH THAT ONE OF OUR COLOURS CONCEPTS IS CORPORATE AND HAS AN R. R. ON IT 
ALL OF THEM SHOULD HAVE R. R. YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
LOVELY 
OKAY NOW WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT FINANCES 
UM I HAVE AN EXCEL SHEET THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA CALCULATE THE COST UM 
SO LET ME EXIT OUT OF THIS FIRST 
OKAY UM 
I KNOW 
LET ME ONE MORE SPACE 
GONNA ZOOM IN REAL QUICK 
OKAY 
HAND DYNAMO 
WE'RE USING KINETIC BATTERY RIGHT 
UM AND WE'RE HAVING ONE PER 
NO OKAY 
UM ELECTRONICS 
SIMPLE 
MM 'KAY 
UM THE CASE 
IT'S VERY CURVY SO OKAY 
THE WOOD 
I MEAN THE RUBBER 
MM-HMM OKAY 
YEAH WE'RE USING WE'RE GONNA NEED AT LEAST TWO SPECIAL COLOURS 
UM 
I DUNNO WHERE IT YEAH 
SO LET'S YOU SAY THREE 
YEAH I DUNNO 
THAT I TH I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE UNDER YOURS 
WE'LL JUST SAY THREE 
MM-HMM 
MAYBE THE R. R. WILL BE ONE COLOUR AS WELL SO YEAH 
INTERFACE WE'RE DOING PUSH BUTTONS 
AND HOW MANY BUTTONS DO WE HAVE 
SIX 
ANYTHING ELSE 
UH BUTTONS UH SO UM 
SO THE CASE MATERIAL WILL JUST HAVE ONE COLOUR RIGHT BUT THEN THE BUTTONS WILL BE ONE SPECIAL COLOURS 
WE'RE SAYING PER UNIT 
OKAY SO EACH UNIT WILL ONLY HAVE ONE COLOUR IN THERE BUT THE CASE IS 
COULD HAVE UP TO THREE I MEAN THE BUTTONS COULD EA COULD BE UP TO THREE COLOURS 'CAUSE THAT HOW IT'S DESIGNED THERE 
SO 
SPECIAL FORM 
THEY'RE ALL KIND OF JUST PUSH BUTTON RIGHT 
SPECIAL MATERIAL 
OH 
UH D I HAVE TO DO IT PER BUTTON DO I 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN 
YEAH WHAT CAN WE REDUCE 
LET'S SEE WHAT THAT WOULD DO 
IT'S ONLY GONNA BRING US DOWN TO THIRTEEN POINT THERE ANYWAY 
OKAY UM ARE WE SURE THIS IS DOUBLE CURVED 
MAYBE IT'S SINGLE CURVED WE HAVE AN IDEA 
WELL IT'S NOT THE YEAH 
OKAY IT'S THE KINETIC BATTERY THAT'S KIND OF EXPENSIVE BUT WE HAVE A SIMPLE CHIP SINGLE CURVE 
CASE MATERIAL IS RUBBER AND IT'S A SPECIAL COLOUR BUT THAT'S IMPORTANT 
SIX BUTTONS WE HAVE TO HAVE SIX BUTTONS 
WHAT 
NO OKAY MAYBE NOT 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT JUST HAPPENED 
NOW IT'S TWELVE 
TWELVE POINT FIVE 
SO WE'RE OKAY I THINK 
YEAH 
OKAY WE'RE ALL SET 
UM SAVE 
I SAVED THAT IT OR UM OUR BIG SHARED FOLDER SO YOU KNOW 
UM OKAY BACK TO AGENDA 
UM ARE THE OR THE COSTS UNDER TWELVE FIFTY EURO 
YES 
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE PROJECT EVALUATION 
PROJECT PROCESS 
SATISFACTION WITH FOR EXAMPLE THE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY LEADERSHIP TEAMWORK THE MEANS ANY NEW IDEAS FOUND 
SO I GUESS WHAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT HERE IS JUST EVALUATING HOW WE CREATED THIS PROJECT THE INFORMATION WE GET IN THE NEWS 
HOW WE SAID IT IF WE WERE ABLE TO UM YOU KNOW IS OUR CREATIVITY WITH THE INFORMATION 
UM HOW HOW WELL I GUESS I LOAD IT UM THE HOW WELL WE WORKED TOGETHER AS A TIME UM THE DIGITAL PENS THE WHITEBOARD 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I THINK WE ALL MADE UM VERY SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DOMINATED IT WHICH I THOUGHT WAS REALLY GOOD 
LIKE EACH OF US WAS ABLE TO ME LIKE EACH OF YOU HAD YOUR INFORMATION AND I UH I TRIED TO FACILITATE IT WITHOUT LIKE TAKING OVER UM 
I LIKE OUR LITTLE FINISHED PRODUCTS 
REALLY CUTE 
I KNOW LET'S THINK IF IT LIKE A LITTLE JINGLE 
UM 
OKAY UM NEW IDEAS FOUND 
DEFINITELY 
OR OR AT LEAST BE C P CREATIVE ENOUGH TO THINK OF TOGGLE SWITCHES MM 
ETCETERA 
UH I'M SO EXCITED 
MM-HMM 
I TH YEAH THAT'S AWESOME 
UM OKAY CLOSING 
OR THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET 
SO THE PROJECT EVALUATED 
NOW THERE'S THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY 
UM SO THIS IS THE GREAT PRODUCT KIDS I THINK WE'VE CREATED SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING AND THAT WE HAVE A MARKET FOR IT 
UM ESPECIALLY IF WE CAN PRODUCE IT AT TWELVE POINT THREE WHICH WE HOPE UM 
YEAH 
MAKE SURE IN YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE TO PUT DOWN CRITICISMS OF 
BOTH THE PROCESS AND THE UM THE FINAL RESULTS AND 
I DO LIKE THE MARTIAN REMOTE 
IF WE COULD CHOOSE MORE THAN ONE THAT WOULD BE MY SECOND CHOICE 
ALTHOUGH THE TOG TOGGLE 
I'M AFRAID I WOULD 
IT'S COOL 
I THINK I WOULD BREAK IT 
OH YEAH IT'S KIND OF A PENGUIN 
MM MM 
MM 'KAY CONGRATULATIONS 
UM 
ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY 
ALRIGHT 
UM ANYBODY HAVE I GOT MORE MASTER CLASSES ANYBODY ELSE WANNA LOOK TAKE A MASTER'S CLASS 
YEAH BUT CHECK IT IT 
SO LIKE THERE ARE ALL THOSE LIKE LINKS THEY DON'T GO ANYWHERE 
BUT ALL THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND YOUR KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT 
UM JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU DO 
OH 
IT IS 
YES DEFINITELY I'M VERY SAID THAT I DIDN'T GET ANY LINKS TO THE CORPORATE WEBSITE 
WOW 
YES 
I LOVE EXCEL IT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PROGRAMS 
I SEE MM 
SPONGY 
I I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE TRICKY HAVING TO HAND AROUND THIS THING 
WE HAD A LOT OF THE UM OTHERWISE THE TECHNOLOGY TODAY WAS KINDA COOL 
MM-HMM 
NO 
ALTHOUGH I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD HAVE VERY L AT LEAST FOR UM I 
MM 
MM-HMM 
AND WITH AND WITH THE POWERPOINT THAT WE CAN ALL LIKE IT 
LIKE YOU CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS PRETTY MUCH ON POWERPOINT SO THAT'S NOT AS NECESSARY TO HAVE 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NOW WHEN YOU WERE UM CREATING YOUR UM PROTOTYPES HERE DID YOU WORK TOGETHER OR DID YOU LIKE DO SEPARATE PROJECTS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
COOL 
OH THANKS 
IT'S KINDA FUN 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THIS IS WHAT WE'LL DO 
I FOUND THAT WE DID WE COULD HAVE USED ANOTHER FIVE OR TEN MINUTES 
SOMETIMES IN THE MEETINGS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I THINK THE LAST TIME WE HAD A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT QUITE ENOUGH 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE WE WE COULDN'T ANSWER EVERY SINGLE QUESTION 
UM BUT 
MM 
IT WAS INTERESTING WHAT CAME TO LOOK LATER LIKE SO I WAS DOING THE WHEN I WAS DOING THE BREAKDOWN ON THE AGENDA THAT THEY GAVE ME UM 
THAT MORE POINTS CAME OUT FROM YOUR PRESENTATION EVEN 
UM 
I'M A LITTLE I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DIDN'T DO A UM SOMETHING FOR LOSING THE REMOTE BECAUSE THAT WAS KIND OF A BIG POINT 
BUT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
CONSIDERED THE R YEAH 
WELL IT'S INTERESTING THAT THEY 
MM-HMM YEAH 
IT WAS INTERESTING THOUGH THAT THEY PUT THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE FRUSTRATION WITH LOSING THEIR REMOTE AND YET THEY DIDN'T PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION TO UM WE WEREN'T PROVIDED WITH INFORMATION TO DISCUSS THAT 
I KNOW THAT LIKE PEOPLE PEOPLE HAVE LIKE THINGS THEY CAN PUT IN THEIR KEYS THAT YOU PRESS IT AND IT'LL BEEP 
BUT I BUT I'M SURE THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME KIND OF TECHNOLOGY THAT 
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT 
MM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
TO DO YEAH IT DEPENDS ON HOW ORGANISED YOU ARE PERSONALLY BUT 
MM-HMM 
OH 
CAN'T GET ONE 
YEP 
WE SHOULD MAKE ONE THAT WALKS BY ITSELF 
OR OR LIKE SOME CRAZY LIKE ELECTRO MAGNET THAT YOU PUSH IT AND IT'LL GO ZOOM TO THE T. V. AND STICK THERE 
WELL BUT IF YOU COULD ATTACH THEM AT THE T. V. THEN YOU CAN 
MM 
OKAY 
SORRY I'M JUST UM TRYING TO UPDATE MY MINUTES 
I DECIDED TO YOU KNOW HOW I SENT YOU THE EMAIL SAYING THAT POWERPOINT MINUTES WILL BE COMPLIMENTARY RATHER THAN LIKE REPEATING THEM 
JUST GONNA MAKE I'M MAKING FULL MINUTES SO THAT IT'LL INCLUDE ALL OF THE AGENDA AND ALL THAT 
'CAUSE THAT SEEMS A LITTLE MORE USEFUL 
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE LIKE INFORMATION TO SLOTH THROUGH THERE IS 
MOST OF IT MM-HMM 
I ADDED SLIDES UM I ADDED A COUPLE SLIDES EACH TIME BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT 
MM 
WELL THE THING WAS THEY WOULD PROVIDE YOU AN AGENDA WITH IS LIKE SEVERAL POINTS BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE A SLIDE FOR EACH POINT 
AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I REMEMBER THAT I NEED TO GO THERE THAT POINT 
I KNOW PERSONALLY WHEN I DO POWERPOINT THAT'S WHAT I DO AND SO I HAD TO NICE 
EVEN IF IT WAS JUST LIKE THE TITLE OF IT LIKE THE THREE PRESENTATIONS AND I WOULD DO YOUR THREE 
THE SLOGAN ON IT 
NO NO NO 
I THINK WE JUST NEED THE UM THE R. R. YEAH 
YEAH I WAS JUST KINDA GOING BY THE WEB PAGE 'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME ANY COLOUR LIKE YELLOW GREY OR 
I DON'T REALLY LIKE YELLOW IN GENERAL 
BUT IT 
WASN'T IT INTERESTING THAT UM I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT OUR MARKET MARKETING UM EXPERT DID NOT AGREE WITH THE MARKETING UM 
THE MARKETING CHOICES YOU KNOW LIKE THAT WAS A BIT OF A CONFLICT 
PEOPLE ARE STUPID 
MAYBE LIKE I DON'T KNOW 
THAT COULD ALWAYS BE 
OH 
I'M CLAIMING IT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
RIGHT WELL WE MADE THREE DIFFERENT PROTOTYPES AND I GUESS WE'LL START WITH WITH THIS ONE 
UM WE HAVE OUR COLOURS NOT OR NOT FIXED BUT THIS IS THE GENERAL SHAPE 
UM IT'S YOU HOLD IT SORT OF THEIR LIKE LIKE THIS IN YOUR LEFT HAND OR YOU SWITCH IT OVER AND UH IT'S EASILY ADAPTABLE TO OTHER HAND 
YOU CAN PUSH THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR THUMB LIKE A MOBILE PHONE OR YOU CAN PUSH THEM WITH YOUR 
INDEX FINGER OF YOUR OTHER HAND OR EVEN I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE VARIETY YOU CAN HOLD IT LIKE THIS AND PRESS IT WITH YOUR SOME INDEX FINGER 
UH WE HAVE THE ON OFF BUTTON TO THE TOP VERY VISIBLE VERY BIG 
WE HAVE OUR UP AND DOWN BUTTONS WHICH ARE ALSO GONNA BE OR CHANNEL SELECTORS AND WE HAVE OUR LITTLE MENU BUTTON HERE 
IF YOU PUSH IF YOU'RE JUST PUSHING THESE NORMALLY THEY'RE THE MAIN BUTTONS OF UH THE VOLUME BUTTONS RATHER 
IF YOU PRESS SELECT ONCE THEY BECOME CHANNEL CHANGING BUTTONS 
IF WE PRESS SELECT THREE TIMES 
THE MENU WITH THE OTHER FEATURES AND PRO POSSIBLY ALSO WITH YOUR T. V. CHANNEL CHOICES SHOWS UP AND YOU HAVE YOUR FIVE PRESETS DOWN HERE 
UM IF PEOPLE WANNA GRAB HOLD OF THAT IS HOW IT FEELS IN YOUR HAND 
THAT'S OUR NUMBER ONE PROTOTYPE 
UM DO YOU WANNA PRESENT THE POTATO OR SHALL I PRESENT THE MARTIAN 
THAT'S THE RHOMBUS YEP 
IF YOU PRESSED AND HOLD IT MAYBE 
YEAH 
ON OFF THAT'S A POSSIBILITY YEAH 
AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE UM THE MARTIAN OR THE PEAR EITHER WAY 
UM IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A CREATIVE FEEL 
UH YOU HAVE THE ON OFF TOGGLE STEM ON THE TOP 
WE HAVE THE FIVE PRESET SEEDS 
AND THEN YOU HAVE ON THE SIDES TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE THREE DIMENSIONAL 
YOU HAVE YOUR CHANNEL CHANGING VOLUME CHANGING BUTTONS AND YOUR MENU BUTTON RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE 
SO THAT'S FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AS WELL PLUS IT'S AN INTERESTING TALKING POINT TO HAVE STANDING UP 
WE FIGURED IT COULD STAND UP LIKE THIS IN YOUR TABLE IF YOU WANTED TO IT IF I MADE THE ABOUT THE BOTTOM FLAT 
UH THE MENU SELECT BUTTON 
WE WERE WE WERE THINKING THAT 
NORMALLY WE'D GO FOR FRUITY COLOURS BUT MAYBE WE'RE ALSO THINKING THAT YOUR SORT OF MIDDLE AGED MAN FOR AN EXAMPLE CUSTOMER 
MIGHT NOT WANT A FRUITY COLOURED REMOTE IS M MAYBE WE'D HAVE ONE VERSION THAT'S A BIT TONED DOWN MAYBE WITH WITH LESS CONTRASTS ON IT 
YEAH SOMETHING STILL A LITTLE BRIGHT TO MAKE IT HARD TO LOSE BUT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
WELL WE WERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE GET THAT EMAIL AND WE THINK THAT EACH OF THESE ARE SO DISTINCTIVE 
THAT IT IT'S NOT JUST LIKE ANOTHER PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY AROUND YOUR HOUSE 
IT'S GONNA BE SOMEWHERE THAT IT CAN BE SEEN 
SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT THINKING THAT IT'S GONNA BE AS CRITICAL TO HAVE THE LESS 
I THINK 
YEAH 
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD AND THE CHIP 
TO MAKE IT MAKE A NOISE OR SOMETHING ABOUT IT WOULD TAKE A LOT MORE DEVELOPMENT THEN WE HAVE THIS AFTERNOON 
SO D DO PEOPLE HAVE A PREFERENCE AS FAR AS FILE AND FUNCTIONALITY 
UM 
MM YEAH THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GOOD 
HERE STICK TO ONE 
SO WHERE 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
OH 
HEY 
NO I KINDA LIKE IT 
THAT'S HARD TO MISS 
LIKE 
YEAH 
INTERESTING 
OKAY SO THAT WHERE PEOPLE ARE LEANING THEN THE POTATO 
I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE I MEAN THAT'S REALLY GOTTEN THE SIMPLICITY OF THE BUTTONS DOWN THAT ONE 
HMM 
WELL THAT IN THE IPOD FOR EXAMPLE YOU JUST EVERY TIME YOU WANNA GO BACK YOU HIT THE MENU BUTTON AGAIN AND IT BRINGS YOU BACK ONE LEVEL 
GOOD POINT 
MAYBE YEAH MAYBE IT CAN BE ONE OF THIS IF YOU PRESS DOWN AND HOLD 
FOR TWO SECONDS THEN IT BRINGS YOU BACK ONE LEVEL OR SOMETHING 
THE POTATO 
ARE WE LEANING TOWARDS THE POTATO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
UM I DUNNO IF IT'S IT'S CREATIVE 
I DUNNO IF FANCY AS THE WORD I WOULD USE 
I DUNNO IF ANY OF THEM ARE FANCY IN I'D SAY TWO BECAUSE C UNIQUE 
YEAH NO 
IN THE BATTERY THAT'S IT 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD NOTICE THAT THOUGH 
YEAH 
I I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S 
YEAH LOOK FANCY VERSUS CREATIVE IT'S IT'S 
DIFFERENT 
BUT DOES THAT EQUAL INNOVATIVE 
I DUNNO 
I'LL GIVE IT A THREE 
OKAY 
UM I'LL GIVE IT A ONE 
PRETTY HARD TO MESS UP 
YEAH 
UH THAT YOU COULDN'T IT'D BE HARDER TO BREAK HARDER TO LOSE 
MM 
IT IT MIGHT BE 'CAUSE THAT'S OUR CORPORATE COLOUR ISN'T IT 
WE MIGHT WANNA KEEP IT YELLOW 
YEAH 
IF WE HAD A YELLOW 
SURE 
SO IT WAS INSPIRED BY THE POTATO SO I THINK IT'S PRETTY FRUITY 
OH MANGO THAT THAT 
THAT'S A MUCH MORE TRENDY THAN A POTATO ONE 
YEAH ME TOO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'LL I'LL SAY TWO AS WELL 
BECAUSE OLDER PEOPLE THAT AREN'T USED TO LIKE TEXTING WITH THE THUMB MIGHT FIND OUT A BIT AT FIRST BUT 
THE MENU SYSTEM AND THE THE FACT THAT MULTIPLE BUTTONS ARE USED FOR DIFFERENT THINGS MIGHT BE A BIT CONFUSING 
BUT I THINK IF IT'S NO IT'S ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT IT MIGHT TAKE YOU FIVE MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO AFTERWARDS 
SO I'D I THINK I'D GIVE IT A TWO I GUESS 
OH GOOD POINT 
UM I'D SAY I'D GIVE IT UH A THREE I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON HOW TIDY YOU ARE NORMALLY 
SIMPLE TO USE OR SIMPLE IN DESIGN 
DO YOU KNOW 
RIGHT 
I'M GIVE IT A THREE I GUESS 
I DUNNO 
I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE AS FASHIONABLE SO MY ROBOT REMOTE 
OR ALIEN OR WHATEVER HE WAS 
UM TWO 
YEAH 
YEAH I'LL SAY TWO 
SHALL WE UH 
WELL I THINK ALL OF THEM SHOULD HAVE AN R. R. 
OH MY 
UH WE'RE ON USING KINETIC YEAH 
YEAH 
SINGLE 
SIMPLE SIMPLE RATHER 
UH UH UH DOUBLE CURVED 
YEAH I NEVER DID GET A PICTURE OF THIS IS I DON'T REALLY KNOW 
OUR CASE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENTS OOPS WE JUST SKIPPED BY THEM 
NO W W THE PLASTIC IS THE PLASTIC FOR THE INSIDE IS ASSUMED 
THE SUPPLEMENT IS 
UH I GUESS IT WAS RUBBER RATHER THAN LATEX 
YEAH 
UH WELL 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE USE THE BASIC COLOUR IS THOUGH 
WELL ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IN EACH COLOUR COMBINATION OR ARE WE YOU KNOW WE'LL LOOK WE'LL HAVE YELLOW AND BLACK 
SO THAT TWO SPECIAL COLOURS 
OR OR IS WHAT AND BLACK THEN TWO MORE OR 
OH 
I GUESS IT'S THERE THERE THERE 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
SIX WITH THE POWER 
YEAH 
NO 
UH WE'LL DO WE WE 
OR THE BUTTONS ONE SPECIAL COLOUR SPECIAL F 
I DIDN'T GET INFORMATION ON 
WELL DOES IT BUT IF WE'RE MAKING MULTIPLE VARIETIES OF THIS IS WHERE I'M GETTING CONFUSED 
PER UNIT OKAY OKAY 
ALRIGHT AND EACH BUTTON IS 
YEAH OKAY 
NO I THINK THEY'RE FINE 
MATERIAL WE WANT THEM RUBBER AS WELL PROBABLY YEAH 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
I THINK THEY'RE IF THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE RUBBER THEN IT THAT'S WHAT IT MATTERS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH UH 
OKAY LET'S HAVE OUR BUTTONS ALL BE ONE COLOUR 
ALRIGHT 
OH 
WE HAVE AN IDEA 
I DUNNO I DIDN'T GET ANY PICTURES 
IT'S SINGLE CURVED 
WHY NOT 
YEAH 
THAT IS IMPORTANT 
HOW DID TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE WHAT DID YOU JUST CHANGE 
IT WAS IT WAS THIRTEEN AND NOW IT'S FIFTEEN 
TWELVE POINT FIVE 
HEY HEY 
WE'RE ALL SET THEN 
SH 
ALRIGHT 
YES 
WELL 
I FELT VERY CREATIVE 
I ENJOYED MAKING THE PROTOTYPES 
YEAH 
I THINK WE COULD'VE DONE EVEN BETTER WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION LIKE WHAT'S A SINGLE CURVED CASE HOW MANY COLOURS WHAT DO COLOURS COUNT 
THINGS BUT GIVEN GIVEN WHAT WE HAD I THINK THAT WE DID WE DID REALLY WELL 
UM I THINK WE WORKED TOGETHER PRETTY WELL 
YEAH 
BUT THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THEY REALLY MY CREATIVITY SO 
DO YOU THINK WE COULD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
CAN WE MARKET THIS IS THE MANGO REMOTE 
SHOULD WE HAVE THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE PACKAGING 
I HAVE A LITTLE R. R. 
YES 
HOPEFULLY NOT WITH JUST MY FINGERNAIL AT SOME POINT ABOUT UM IT'S QUITE A USEFUL LITTLE GADGET 
ALL THANKS TO ONE FOR THE DESIGN OF THAT ONE 
MM 
WHAT DID WE FOUND FOR NEW IDEAS 
PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY BASE THEIR REMOTES ON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
I I AM REALLY NOT THE IDEA OF KINETIC BATTERIES NOW AFTER READING ABOUT THEM 
THAT WAS 
I I KNOW YOU CAN GET WATCHES THAT HIDE THEM LIKE REALLY QUITE EXPENSIVE WATCHES THAT JUST NEVER NEED A BATTERY 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS MOVING YOUR WRIST 
BUT IN OTHER THINGS I THINK IT'D BE REALLY GOOD 
YES 
YEAH 
IT STARTED BECAUSE I WANTED TO HAVE TO USE SET IS A STEM AND THEN ALRIGHT SO 
SO IT STARTED AS A PEAR BUT THEN IT STARTED LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE A MARTIAN WHEN I PUT THE 
TOOK ME TO YOUR LEADER 
WOW MAYBE I SHOULD MARKET IT AT SOME REMOTE CONTROL COMPANY NOW 
SO ARE ARE POOR LITTLE THING 
OH 
IT'S REALLY FUNNY THAT YOU GOT SPAM ON YOUR WORK EMAILS 
LET'S SEE WHAT DID I GET THROUGH THE CORPORATE WEBSITE 
IT'S JUST INSPIRATION ABOUT CIRCUIT BOARDS 
YEAH THAT IS PRETTY NEAT 
YEAH MY INSPIRATION FROM FROM LAST TIME IS THE IN INTERIOR OF A REMOTE CONTROL BEING TAKEN APART BIT BY BIT TALKING ABOUT CIRCUIT BOARDS 
I LEARNED A LOT ACTUALLY 
I COULD PROBABLY TAKE APART A REMOTE CONTROL NOW IF I REALLY NEEDED TO 
NOW I HAVE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND CHIPS AND TRANSPONDERS AND I WROTE IT ALL DOWN BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE RELEVANT 
LIKE ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE INSIDE OF A REMOTE CONTROL BUT THEN THEY'RE LIKE 
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY AND THIS YOU JUST NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE CASE 
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THOUGH 
YEAH 
THAT WAS REALLY NOT HOW I GOT EMAILS AND 
NO 
I YEAH 
IF I'D GOTTEN PICTURES OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CASE THE DIFFERENT LOOKS OF THE CASE I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY DRAWN THEM UP BUT 
YEAH WE COULD'VE PUT OUR BRAINSTORMING STUFF UP THERE RATHER THAN JUST TALKING ABOUT IT BUT WITH ONLY FOR PEOPLE IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE 
I THINK IF YOU HAD A LARGER GROUP 
YEAH 
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GONNA BE WORKING IN DIFFERENT PLACES 
WE IF WE WERE ALL GONNA STAY IN HERE ALL THE TIME THAN HAVING THE NOTES UP ON THE WHITEBOARD WOULD'VE BEEN ALRIGHT 
BUT EVERYONE NEEDS THEIR OWN LIKE SPECIFIC NOTES I GUESS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO IT WAS A BIT OF BOTH REALLY WE JUST KIND OF STARTED OUT BY EACH TAKING A COLOUR OF CLAY AND 
JUST FOOLING AROUND WITH IT AND I CAME UP WITH THAT RHOMBUS SHAPE AND UH COME UP WITH THE SORT OF POTATOEY 
MANGOEY SHAPE AND THEN JUST WANT FROM THERE REALLY 
IT WAS FUN 
AS WELL DONE WITH THE MANAGEMENT I FELT WELL MANAGED 
THAT HAPPENED TO ME ALL THE TIME THOUGH 
YEAH I WAS QUITE WORRIED AT THE END OF THE LAST MEETING THAT WE WEREN'T GETTING WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE FIRM DECISIONS 
BUT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IT REGARDLESS SO 
I'M NOT USUALLY A VERY DECISIVE PERSON IS IT HELPED TO HAVE PEOPLE SAY THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE IN FIVE MINUTES 
ESPECIALLY LAST TIME YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
AND I I FELT THE FIRST TWO MEETINGS THAT I WAS COMING IN WITH AN INFORMATION AND NOT SORT OF 
MADE ME REALLY LIKE UH I DON'T KNOW THROWING TOGETHER POWERPOINT OUT OF AN AN INFORMATION AND THEN LAST TIME IT WAS LIKE THE OPPOSITE 
I HAD AS MUCH INFORMATION AND SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT WAS SOMETHING LIKE IN ORDER TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE WOULD'VE HAD TO HAVE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CIRCUIT BOARDS AND THINGS LIKE 
YEAH 
I THINK WE WERE 
YEAH 
I THINK WE WERE JUST GETTING OVERENTHUSIASTIC WITH THE TASK 
I THINK WE REALLY GET INTO IT I MEAN I GET INTO IT IS THE DAY WENT ON AND I GOT REALLY LIKE 
UH I'M DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL I DUNNO IF THAT'S JUST UM BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK THERE ARE SOME OF THOSE LIKE INFOMERCIAL REMOTES THAT HAVE THINGS 
SO YOU WON'T LOSE THEM 
I DUNNO 
I MEAN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT AND LIKE I IN MY HOUSEHOLD AT LEAST 
THERE'S ONLY ABOUT TWO PLACES THAT THE REMOTE IS EVER 'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY ON T. V. AND 
THERE'S ONLY LIKE THREE CHAIRS 
YEAH 
YEAH OR LIKE I GUESS WHAT THE SETUP OF THE HOUSE IS IT 
BUT I MEAN 
I AM NOTORIOUS FOR LOSING MY KEYS I JUST I GUESS I'VE JUST NEVER LOST THE REMOTE 
I PUT MY KEYS IN THE REFRIGERATOR THE OTHER NIGHT AND COULDN'T FIND THEM 
'CAUSE I WAS PUTTING GROCERIES AWAY 
Y YOU'RE TAKING STUFF FROM A BIG AND PUTTING THEM IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND THEN GO BACK TO MY ROOM 
CAN'T GET IN LIKE ALL AROUND THE KITCHEN 
DEFINITELY IN THE VEGETABLE DRAWER 
SO 
MM 
BUT I GUESS IT'S 'CAUSE WE DON'T CARRY REMOTES AROUND THAT MUCH 
YEAH 
MAYBE WITH OUR LITTLE ROBOT ONE WE COULD'VE HAD HIM HAVE A ROBOT 
ALIEN PEAR WHATEVER HE IS HAVE A LITTLE VOICE LIKE I AM LOCATED 
UH A G. P. S. SYSTEM INTERNAL G. P. S. 
ALTHOUGH IF IT'S SITTING STILL FOR TOO LONG 
YES I 
OUR LITTLE 
OR JUST JUST A WHILE YOU KNOW 
JUST IF YOU LIKE YOU'D HAVE A REMOTE FOR YOUR REMOTE THAT'LL 
ZOOM 
YEAH 
HMM 
ALL KINDS OF POSSIBILITIES 
YEAH 
OH 
WOW 
'CAUSE YOU'VE HAD LIKE THE MOST TYPING AND ORGANISING TO DO 
YEAH I GUESS 
HOW MUCH OF YOUR POWERPOINT WAS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU EVERY MEETING 
OH 
OKAY 
YEAH I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT ADDING SLIDES 
'CAUSE I WOULD JUST GET SLIDES WITH TITLES ON THEM AND FILL THEM ALL IN WE DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT ADDING MORE 
OH YEAH 
RIGHT 
NO NO DEFINITELY NOT 
WE 
NO I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO I THINK THE R. AND R. ESPECIALLY IF THE YELLOW AND BLACK ONE 
OR YELLOW AND BLUE 
LEMME GO TO THE WEB PAGE 
FINISH MEETING NOW 
YEAH 
I GUESS IT I IT SORT OF A GREY ISN'T IT 
YELLOW AND GREY BUT THEN THE SLOGAN'S IN BLUE 
YEAH 
WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT COLOUR CLAY ANYWAY 
WELL WE'RE NOT SADLY GOING TO ACTUALLY BE PRODUCING THIS IS 
POTATO MANGO SHAPED REMOTES 
I CAN'T BELIEVE A WHOLE DAY SO AGAIN 
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S BEEN THAT LONG 
GET SUCKED IN 
MM I HAVEN'T GOTTEN QUESTIONNAIRE EIGHT YET 
I COULD 
COULD THE MIDDLE BUTTON OF THE ON SCREEN MENU FUNCTION IS A POWER BUTTON 
IF YOU LIKE HOLD IT DOWN THAT WOULD BE ON OFF 
SORRY WHAT'S THE YELLOW IN IN THE MIDDLE I FORGOT 
BUT IF IT'S LIKE UNDER COVERS OR LIKE IN A COUCH YOU STILL CAN'T USE IT 
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS SIMIL OR IT'S SORT OF WHAT ALREADY EXISTS SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING SORT OF LIKE NOW AND FUN 
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE NOT I'M INITIALLY DRAWN TO JUST 'CAUSE IT'S LIKE COMFORTABLE AND LOOK INTO DIFFERENT 
I SORT OF LIKE THIS ONE LIKE I I DON'T KNOW WHY IT JUST IT'S LIKE SMALL BUT STILL SORT OF LIKE CUTE LOOKING I DUNNO 
BUT I ALSO LIKE THE B THE SIDE BUTTONS ON THAT IN LIKE I THINK THAT'S KIND OF NOT 
BUT I DUNNO HOW MUCH ANY OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FASHIONABLE SORT OF COOL LOOKING THING THAT WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS ON 
OH THERE WE GO 
WELL DO WE WE LIKE I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ONE THAT WE DO IT FOR 
THAT WAS I WAS A LITTLE VAGUE ON WHAT EXACTLY I'M SUPPOSED TO DO BUT LET ME I HAVE TO LIKE WRITE SOMETHING ON THE WHITEBOARD SO 
NO I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE LIKE A POWERPOINTY THING 'CAUSE I THINK IT WOULD BE REDUNDANT 
I DUNNO 
OKAY SO WHICH ONE OR WE SORT OF ROUGHLY LOOKING AT IT ADDRESS WHETHER OR NOT IT MEETS OR SO UM NECESSITIES THE YELLOWY ONE IS THAT 
OKAY WELL WE CAN OBVIOUSLY CHANGE IT AFTER WE GO THROUGH EACH DIFFERENT ONE 
SO BASICALLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT REMOTE ACTUALLY DOES CONFORM TO THE THINGS THAT WE SAID IT WAS GOING TO 
SO WHAT WE SORT OF WANNA DO IS THAT WE EACH NEED TO SEPARATELY 
RANK EACH OF THE FOLLOWING THINGS AND THEN I'LL TABULATE AN AVERAGE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES MEET THAT 
SO WE'LL JUST GO THROUGH THEM IN IT A TIME AND WE'LL JUST GO ROUND AND EACH OF YOU CAN TELL ME IN A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN WITH ONE BEING REALLY EXTREMELY TRUE 
AND SEVEN BEING NOT TRUE AT ALL OR FALSE OF THE REMOTE THAT WE'VE CREATED CONFORMS TO THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA 
SO WE CAN DO THIS ONE FIRST 
FIRST WE WANNA KNOW IF IT MEETS THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL UM OBJECTIVE 
SO LIKE IN MY OPINION THE FOR NOW AT LEAST THE YELLOW ONE IS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE SO I'M GONNA SAY IT'S LIKE A THREE 
THAT'S JUST MY OPINION 
WHAT DOES EACH OF YOU 
OKAY WILL GIVE IT A NUMBER SORRY 
OKAY 
AND TWO AWESOME 
ALRIGHT AND SOME SORT OF SCALE FOR FUNCTIONALITY IS IT FUNCTIONAL 
I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY FUNCTIONAL I'M GONNA GIVE IT A ONE 
NO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL THERE'S SOME OTHER ONES I WILL ADDRESS THAT YEAH 
AWESOME OKAY 
UM WE WANNA KNOW NEXT IF IT'S TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
YEAH SHE SAID IT WAS NO 
UM SO IT TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
NOT REALLY I MEAN NOT AS MUCH 'CAUSE WE WE DON'T HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN WE DON'T HAVE FANCY CHIP 
OTHER THAN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE I DUNNO IF IT'S REALLY 
I KINETIC BATTERY AS A BIG ONE IS 
BUT IT BUT WE KNOW IT'S THERE 
AND IF IT'S MADE OF LIKE LATEX THAT WHOLE IDEA THAT'S PRETTY COOL 
I'LL GIVE IT A THREE 
'CAUSE IT WE COULD'VE PICKED A LOT OF FEATURES THAT WOULD'VE MADE IT REALLY 
ALRIGHT 
EVERYONE ELSE 
MM 'KAY 
NEXT IS IT EASY TO USE 
JUST SO YOU KNOW EASY TO LEARN WILL BE SEPARATE SO DON'T OVERLAP THEM 
I THINK IT'S REALLY EASY TO USE 
I'LL GIVE IT A TWO 
ALRIGHT 
UM WE NEXT WANNA SEE IF IT HAS A SPONGY QUALITY AND IF INDEED IT'S MADE OF LATEX OR RUBBER I IT'S SPONGY ALL THE WAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
NO WHAT DO YOU GIVE IT 
ALRIGHT AND THE NEXT SO DOES IT INTEGRATE SOME NOTION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
WELL SO IT GONNA BE YELLOW 
YEAH BUT IF YOU HAD LIKE A SILVERY KIND OF WHITE OR SOMETHING 
OH YEAH 
ALRIGHT SO I THINK IT IT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I OKAY I'M GIVING IT A IN THE MANGO PUT UM OVER 
WHAT ARE WHAT'S EVERYONE'S NUMBERS 
ALRIGHT UM AND DOES THE DESIGN MATCH THE APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR 
REMEMBER EARLIER WE DISCUSSED THAT PEOPLE DON'T USE A LOT OF BUTTONS THAT THEY USE THE CHANNEL FLIPPING AND THE VOLUME THE MOST 
I THINK WE REALLY TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT A LOT SO I'M GONNA GIVE IT A ONE 
DID YOU SAY ONE ROSE 
OKAY UM ALSO WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT R. S. I. AND WANTING TO PREVENT UM ANY SORT OF LIKE CARPAL TUNNELY KIND OF THING 
DO WE THINK THAT THE LATEX SORT OF GRIP APPROPRIATELY TAKES THAT INTO ACCOUNT 
I THINK I'LL GIVE IT A TWO 'CAUSE I ALMOST FEEL LIKE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO SOMETHING IS GONNA HAPPEN 
UM UM WORTH THE RISK I THINK 
'KAY 
ALRIGHT AWESOME 
AND THE EASE OF LEARNING IT 
I KNOW YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT THAT I DUNNO 
IT SORT OF REMINDS ME OF THE IPOD 
I JUST GET MEAN I STILL HAVEN'T READ THE INSTRUCTION BOOK AND I'M DOING OKAY SO AND I'M NOT GOOD AT LEARNING TECHNOLOGY 
SO I'LL GIVE IT A TWO 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT UM ALSO EARLIER WE HAD SOMETHING ABOUT LOSING IT AND SO NOW WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THAT AT ALL SO 
OKAY SO IN TERMS OF NOT LOSING TO DO YOU THINK THAT IN A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN HOW EASY OR HARD IS IT IT ALSO 
I'M GONNA I'M GONNA GIVE IT A FOUR 'CAUSE I THINK THAT YOU CAN STILL IF IT'S IN BETWEEN SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN'T USE IT 
YOU'RE KIND OF NOT GONNA FIND IT BUT ANYWHERE ELSE IT'S GONNA STAND OUT 
ALRIGHT WE ALSO SAID SIMPLICITY HOW WE HOW WELL DOES IT ADDRESS JUST BEING SIMPLE 
I THINK OVERALL 'CAUSE WE HAD SAID BEFORE OR TWO MAIN THINGS WERE SIMPLICITY AND FASHION SO THESE ARE THE NEXT TWO THINGS WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT 
SEPARATE FROM FANCY LOOK THAT SORT OF THING 
UM IT LIKE WANTS TO BE SIMPLE BUT IT'S NOT LIKE TOTALLY TOTALLY SIMPLE SO I'M GONNA GIVE IT A TWO 
ALRIGHT AND FASHIONABLE 
IT'S HOT I MEAN IT'S A MANGO COME ON 
I MEAN HOW FASHIONABLE CAN YOU MAKE A REMOTE 
I THINK IT'S BRINGING TECHNOLOGY AND FASHION TOGETHER REAL REALLY WELL 
YEAH THE TOGGLE ON OFF SWITCH IT'S REALLY APPEALING 
NUMBER 
AND DOES IT MOAT OR LIKE DEMOGRAPHIC AND SORT OF FOR INTERNATIONAL APPEAL 
THAT WHOLE THING 
JUST THAT IT WOULD SE SERVE OUR AUDIENCE 
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT DID ANYONE HAVE ANY OTHER FEATURES THAT THEY THINK WERE IMPORTANT THAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT 
AND SO WE'RE GONNA DO THAT IS IT WILL ADDRESS TO FINE 
OKAY 
THAT'S ME 
WOAH 
SIMPLE 
YEAH 
WELL DON'T WE NEED PLASTIC AND 
PROVIDED OKAY 
IT WAS RUBBER AND SPECIAL COLOUR RIGHT 
DO WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE SPECIAL COLOUR 
PER 
WELL BUT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE HAVING AT LEAST THREE COLOURS SO 
RIGHT 
WE HAVE SIX 
UH IN FIVE 
OH WAIT 
YEAH 
YEAH PER UNIT 
YEAH 
I LIKE IT LIKE THAT 
YEAH 'CAUSE IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE OTHERWISE 'CAUSE FOR THE WHOLE MAT CASE MATERIAL IT'S ONLY ONE 
IT'S I MEAN IT'S TWO TO MAKE IT RUBBER 
OH WAIT SO MAYBE 
MM I KIND OF LIKE THE BUTTONS 
IT'S SINGLE CURVED 
WE 
YEAH THEY ARE 
YEAH I MEAN IF I'D HAD MORE MARKET RESEARCH ON THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES MAYBE WE COULD'VE TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT 
I KNOW I REALLY ADD THE THE WHOLE MANGO IDEA WAS GREAT 
NO I MEAN 
I THOUGHT THE PEN WAS A LITTLE DISTRACTING FOR ME PERSONALLY LIKE ITS HEAVINESS AND LIKE JUST BEING SO CONSCIOUS OF LIKE TURNING THE PAGES I DUNNO 
THAT WAS A BIT OF A DISTRACTION 
THAT WAS THE LAST ONE LIKE I CHOSE NOT TO DO A POWERPOINT 'CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT MADE SENSE IT 
SO I LIKED THAT I HAD THE OPTION TO DO THAT AND JUST TO TAKE MY OWN NOTES AND THAT WHOLE SORT OF THING 
THEY'RE FUNNY 
I KIND OF WANT ONE 
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF A GOOD PUN THAT I COULD ADD THERE 
I LIKE THE R. R. THAT'S GONNA BE ETCHED ON 
YEAH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXISTED 
YEAH REAL REACTION 
UH THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE MY SECOND CHOICE 
I WOULD BREAK IT 
I WOULD BREAK IT 
OH THAT'S FUNNY 
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A PENGUIN LIKE WITH AN EYE 
I LIKE THAT IT STANDS UP 
HE SAID 
NOTHING WILL COME UP UNTIL AFTER OUR MEETING'S SUPPOSED TO BE OVER ITS ALL TIMED 
OH 
IN THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU SENT LIKE I DIDN'T REALISE THAT IT WAS A JOKE AND I WAS LIKE WHY DID SHE SEND THIS TO USE 
IT'S VERY IT'S VERY WORK RELEVANT 'CAUSE PEOPLE SEND SPAM A LOT 
UH HERE YOU CAN YOU CAN VIEW 
YOU CAN JUST SEE WHAT'S UP 
YEAH IT'S IT'S REALLY DEEP 
HOLD ON 
TAKES A LITTLE WHILE TO GET EXCITED TO LOAD 
THAT THE EXCEL THING IS PRETTY COOL 
HERE LIKE BASICALLY IT'S LIKE INSPIRATION BASICALLY I'M GONNA GIVE YOU TWO SENTENCES ON FASHION AND 
THAT KIND OF THING IS 
YOU DIDN'T MISS OUT THAT MUCH 
OH WOW 
THIS ONE WAS CLEAR 
I GOT A WHOLE TABLE AND EVERYTHING 
THAT'S LIKE MEAN IT WAS LIKE WOULD YOU PREFER AN L. C. D. SCREEN OR A MULTIFUNCTION REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THEN IT DIDN'T HAVE LIKE ANY KIND OF TABLE LIKE AWESOME I'M GLAD THEY ASKED THAT QUESTION AND DIDN'T REPORT THE RESULT 
YEAH 
'CAUSE WE WEREN'T LIKE VOTING ON ANYTHING AND I THINK USUALLY LIKE WHITEBOARDS ARE GOOD 
YOU KNOW LIKE CROSSING OUT IDEAS OR LIKE IF WE HAD HAD LIKE A BRAINSTORMING PERIOD 
BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOOD ORALLY 
GET CRAZY 
AND THESE MIGHT'VE MADE IS MORE WILLING TO LOOK TAKE NOTES THEN IT 
LIKE WRITE UP THEM HERE 'CAUSE WE ALL NEEDED THEM SEPARATELY KIND OF IN THE WHITEBOARDS IN THIS ROOM 
YEAH 
SORRY 
WELL THE PROBLEM WAS EVEN WHEN WE JUST WERE CREATING FROM THE EXCEL FILE 
THERE WASN'T LIKE A OPTION TO SELECT TO SOMEHOW HAVE TO INCLUDED SO THERE WAS NO WE COULD BE LIKE YEAH IT HAS TO INCLUDED 
THERE WAS ONE WAY FOR US TO HAVE 
WRITTEN DOWN THAT IT WAS REALLY THERE 
YEAH 
THAT'S LIKE SAYING YOU'RE NEVER GONNA LOSE YOUR KEYS AND I ALWAYS DO ANYWAY 
YOU'LL LOSE 'EM IN YOUR POCKET LIKE YOU JUST WILL FORGET THAT ARE YOU LIKE PUT IT DOWN SOMEWHERE THAT LIKE MADE SENSE AND THEN NOT REMEMBER 
THERE'S ALWAYS WAYS TO LOSE THINGS 
THAT'S FUNNY 
THAT'S FUNNY 
I ALWAYS DO THAT LEAVING OUT IN MY CAT AND THEN LIKE USING A DIFFERENT COAT 
YEAH 
CAN'T REALLY TAKE IT INTO THE OTHER ROOM 
OH MAN 
HERE YOU GO 
THAT REALLY COULD GET UP AND WALK AWAY 
YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE SLOGAN ON IT OR CAN IT JUST BE LIKE 
OKAY GOOD 
'CAUSE I WAS LIKE IT COULD GO AROUND THE OUTSIDE 
SO IT YELLOW AND BLUE 
UH I GUESS IT IS BLACK GREY 
GREY IS BETTER THAN BLACK DOESN'T LOOK SO BUMBLEBEEISH 
HEY NOW I UNDERSTAND THE RANDOM LIKE NEWSCLIPPINGS 
YES 
I WILL I JUST FEEL LIKE IF YOU'RE REALLY DOING LIKE A A REALLY BIG MARKET EVALUATION YOU WOULDN'T JUST HAVE LIKE ONE SET OF SOURCE 
IT'S KIND OF NO THEY WERE IS NOT BACKED UP IT WOULD JUST BE A SENTENCE LIKE WE DID A SURVEY THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE SAID 
SO MM I DUNNO 
WELL WE GOT SOME GREY AND WE GOT SOME BLUE BUTTONS WE'RE GOOD 
IF THEY EVER COME OUT WITH POTATO 
I'M GONNA HAVE TO 
YEAH 
I KNOW 
RIGHT DO YOU WANNA START 
OKAY UM 
WHAT 
WE CALL THAT IN THE RHOMBUS UH THE RHOMBUS 
UM THIS ONE IS KNOWN AS THE POTATO UH IT'S 
IT'S A HOW CAN I PRESENT IT 
IT'S AN ERGONOMIC SHAPE IS IT IT FITS IN YOUR HAND NICELY 
UM 
IT'S DESIGNED TO BE USED THERE IN YOUR LEFT HAND OR OR IN YOUR RIGHT HAND 
UM I'VE GONE HERE JUST FOR JUST FOR FOUR BUTTONS ON THIS ONE 
UM 
THE TWO BLUE BUTTONS HERE OR FOR ADJUSTING THE VOLUME 
SO YOU'VE GOT VOLUME UP AND VOLUME DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE HERE 
UM THE RED ONES ARE FOR UH CHANGING CHANNELS CHANNEL UP AND CHANNEL DOWN AND THAT'S UM MOVES BETWEEN YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS THAT YOU'VE SELECTED 
UH THIS MIDDLE BUTTON HERE BRINGS UP THE ON SCREEN MENU AND WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON THE ON SCREEN MENU YOU USE THE THREE FOUR BUTTONS TO NAVIGATE AROUND THE MENU SYSTEM AND THE MIDDLE BUTTON UH TO SELECT 
AND THAT'S BASICALLY IT THAT'S THE POTATO 
UH THAT WOULD BE ONE OF YOUR CHANNELS BASICALLY IS LIKE CHANNEL ZERO WOULD BE TO TO SWITCH SWITCH THE MACHINE OFF YEAH 
UM NOT REALLY IT WOULD MAKE IT HARD TO TURN THE MACHINE OFF TO TURN YOUR T. V. OFF 
YEAH YEAH THAT THAT'D BE ONE WAY OF DOING IT YEAH 
THAT'D WORK YEAH 
LET'S PASS 
SO THAT'S 
SO THAT'S OR THREE PROTOTYPES 
UM BASICALLY IN TERMS OF MAKING DECISIONS 
WHAT WE'D NEED TO DO SO FIRST OF ALL DECIDE ON A FROM UH WHICH OF THE THREE DIFFERENT SHAPES WE WANT 
THEN DECIDE WHAT KIND OF BUTTON LAYOUT WE WANT HOW MANY BUTTONS 
AND THEN TO CHOOSE WHAT COLOURS WE WANT TO MAKE THE BUTTONS AND IF WE WANNA PUT ANY TEXT ON THE DEVICE 
LIKE LABEL ON THE BUTTONS ARE PUT A BRAND NAME OR OR A LOGO ON IT OR WHATEVER 
WOULD 
YEAH 
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO TO LOOK LIKE A KIDS' TOY 
YEAH 
I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TECHNOLOGICALLY 
BECAUSE OF YOUR OF YOUR REMOTE'S LOST IT'S PROBABLY UNDER THE SETTEE AND ON THAT CASE YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T SEND AN INFRARED SING SIGNAL TO TO TO FIND OUT 
SO SO IT'S 
I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW IT WOULD WORK AND THEN I WONDER IF IT'S IF IT'S MORE JUST A GIMMICK THEN ANYTHING ELSE 
UH I MEAN HO HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU REALLY SERIOUSLY LOSE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL AND WOULD WOULD A DEVICE LIKE THAT ACTUALLY HELP YOU TO FIND OUT 
YEAH IT'S POSSIBLE YEAH YEAH 
PUT AN EXTRA THE BUTTON ON 
COOL 
IT MAKES LOOK MORE FRUITY AS WELL 
IT'S LIKE A DEFORMED FOOT I DUNNO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THIS IS IT'S THE UP AND DOWN BUTTONS ARE USED FOR SCROLLING UP AND DOWN FOR A LIST OF CHOICES 
YOU FIND THE CHOICE THAT YOU WANT AND YOU PRESS UH YOU PRESS THE RIGHT BUTTON UH 
YEAH 
YEAH SO THEY'RE USED FOR GOING INTO AND OUT OF YOUR SUBMENUS YEAH 
POTATO 
I'LL GO FOR TWO 
I THINK IT'S IT'S FUNCTIONAL IT'S ALSO PRETTY BASIC SO I'LL GIVE IT A TWO 
I'D SAY IT'S TECHNOLOGICALLY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT UNIQUE I MEAN IT'S IT'S JUST TO USE JUST PUSHBUTTONS UM SO I I'D GIVE IT A FOUR 
I'LL SAY NO 
I WONDER IF IT BOUNCES WHEN YOU DROP IT 
YEAH 
YEAH I'D I'D GIVE IT A ONE 
UH UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MANGOEY IS BETTER YEAH 
I LIKE MANGOES 
UH TWO 
OH NO 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH I'LL I'LL SAY TWO 
I THINK IT IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE HARDER THEN MOST REMOTES TO LEARN 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO USE THE MENU SYSTEM AND YOU HAVE TO TELL IT WHAT YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS ARE AND THAT COULD TAKE A BIT OF LEARNING AT FIRST 
BUT 
ONCE YOU'VE YEAH ONCE YOU'D LEARNED HOW TO USE IT I THINK IT IS A LOT EASIER 
SO I'D I'D GIVE IT A FOUR 
YEAH 
UM I'LL GIVE IT A FIVE 'CAUSE I IT WOULD BE EASY TO LOSE SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH 
I'LL GIVE IT A TWO 
THERE 
GUESS IT'S DOUBLE CURVED 
IT IS PRETTY CURVY 
SPECIAL COLOURS ISN'T IT 
WE'VE GOT FIVE 
UH SIX 
YEAH

LET'S ALL LET'S ALL GO FOR THE YELLOW

WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T USE THE WHITEBOARD THAT MUCH 
YEAH 
UH WE WE WORKED TOGETHER UM BUT WE WERE MAKING LIKE WE SORT OF MADE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND THEN DISCUSSED HOW THE HOW THE BUTTONS MIGHT WORK 
UM AND HOW WE COULD LIKE IMPROVE ON THE ON THE DESIGN 
I THINK WE DID WELL IN FIRST OF ALL GIVING OUR MEETINGS THE TIME AND SECOND WE ACTUALLY 
WE WE DID A GOOD JOB OF MAKING FIRM DECISIONS AT THE ENDS OF THE MEETINGS 
AND I 
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES IS THAT YOU TEND TO SORT OF HAVE MEETINGS AND THEN PEOPLE SORTA DRIFT AWAY WITHOUT ANYTHING ACTUALLY REALLY BEING DECIDED 
BUT I THINK HERE WE GOT WE GOT COLOUR AND AND DECISIVE DECISIVE POINTS AT THE END OF THE MEETINGS

GOING TO USE LIKE NORTH CAROL I'M SORRY YOU YOU JUST CAN'T GET A BETTER BURRITO THAN WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE S IN SAN DIEGO 
WELL IT'S IT'S I THERE'S OTHER THINGS TO THERE'S YOU JUST CAN'T PLACE TO LIKE I WHEN I WANT TO SCHOOL IN THE U. IN SANTA BARBARA WHICH IS CENTRAL CALIFORNIA 
THE MEXICAN FOOD IS OKAY IT'S JUST NOT GOOD LOOK AND YEAH IT'S LIKE TWO BUCKS 
LIKE LITERALLY TWO BUCKS FOR THIS MASSIVE I MISS YEAH GOOD CALL ON THAT 
UM JUST LITERALLY JUST METROPOLITAN SAN DIEGO I LOVE LIKE FIVE MINUTES FROM THE Z 
SO NORTH PARK ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT TO GET REAL SPECIFIC 
YEP 
YES 
N UNIVERSITY YEAH 
YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE LITERALLY HALF A MAIL FROM MY HOUSE 
YEAH PRETTY COOL 
SMALL WORLD SO WE WERE DISCUSSING BEFORE 
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE ALL FROM THE SAME GENERAL REGION 
RIGHT SO OKAY SUCCESS ON THE WHITEBOARD 
YOU CAN HARNESS THE AWESOME POWER A LITTLE BIT INTRODUCTIONS WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF OUR C. D. S AND THINGS WE LIKE ABOUT THE CITY YOU KNOW I THINK WE'LL 
UM RIGHT SO MOVING ON IT NOT FUN STUFF UH PROJECT FINANCE 
UM BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS SELL THIS REMOTE FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
UM 
THIS IS WHAT THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT HAS TOLD ME THE C. F. I. BUT I DON'T KNOW 
I'M NOT SOLD ON THIS IT'S PRETTY DEAR I MEAN TWENTY IF THAT'S LIKE YOU KNOW 
FORTY BUCKS FOR A REMOTE 
IT WOULD HAVE TO PRETTY MUCH LIKE DO MY LAUNDRY FOR ME 
UM SO WHAT WE CAN MAYBE WORK ON THAT A LATER BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE A LOT IN AT THE PROFIT AIMS TO MAKE FIFTY MILLION EUROS ON IT 
EUR INTERNATIONALLY 
SO UM ONE OF THE THINGS I I WAS GONNA MENTION IT YOU UM YOU GUYS THE DESIGNERS IS THAT UM TO UM WE PROBABLY NEED A REVER IT NEEDS TO BE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL PROBABLY 
UM SO SOMETHING THAT COULD DO N. T. S. C. AS WELL AS PAL AS WELL AS VARIOUS OTHER FORMATS LIKE IF IT'S GONNA CONTROL D. V. D. S BUT UM YOU KNOW I'LL LEAVE THAT IT YOU GUYS BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I I IT IS GONNA BE AN INTERNATIONAL SOLD THING 
UM BUT WE WANNA TRY TO MAKE IT FOR TWELVE FIFTY 
SO WE WANNA TRY TO MAKE A HUNDRED PERCENT PROFIT ON IT IF WE CAN 
UM SO RIGHT SO UM JUST TO CLOSE UP I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH TIME I'VE USED MM NEXT TIME RIGHT PROJECT MANAGER SORTED 
UM 
SO UH WE'LL MEET IN ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR OR SO UM AND I'D LIKE THE UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TO GET GE THINK ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE 
LIKE WHAT THE BASIC FUNCTION OF IT 
UM U. I. D. WELL YEAH YOU RIGHT G YOUR ASSIGNMENTS ARE UP THERE AND YOU'LL ALSO GET S ASSIGNMENTS FROM IN YOUR EMAIL AS WELL MORE SPEC SPECIFICS ON WHAT DO DO 
UM MM BASIC AND UM SO I AND YOU TO TELL US WHAT UM W WHAT THE USER'S GONNA WANT 
SO ACTUALLY IN A WAY YOU GUYS C MAYBE IN OUR NEXT MEETING CHAT A BIT ABOUT WHAT THE USER'S GONNA WANT AND WHAT THE USER CAN HAVE 
YOU KNOW LIKE UH SO 
YEAH WELL IT IS AND WE'LL DISCUSS THE TRADE OFFS IN BETWEEN UM SO YEAH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT IN YOUR EMAIL 
BUT I THINK THAT THAT IS MORE OR LESS A GOOD PLACE TO START FOR NOW UM 
AND SO MORE THINGS COME UP WE'LL HAVE MEETINGS AND YOU'LL GET EMAILS AND SO FORTH 
UM ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE GET STARTED 
YOU MEAN IT LIKE 
HMM 
YEAH 
WELL HAVE A THINK ABOUT IT 
I MEAN I'M I'M CERTAINLY OP IT SEEMS LIKE YEAH IT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S CERTAINLY DO ABLE ISN'T IT 
I MEAN UM OR IF WE CAN'T HAVE A FULL MOBILE PHONE MAYBE A REMOTE THAT HAS SOME OTHER KIND OF USEFUL FUNCTION 
THE CLAPPER 
NO I MEAN IN GOOD IDEA GOOD IDEA 
WE'LL SEE WHAT IS WHAT 
UH-HUH Y I LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE I GUESS WE WE PROBABLY HAVE SOME TIME MAYBE WE SHOULD BRAINSTORM A BIT LIKE WHAT WE WANNA DO GO BACK TO ME 
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY 
LET ME BRING UP SOMETHING ABOUT 
OUR BASIC GOALS HERE WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH 
UH PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT 
TS TS TS 
YEAH 
NOT AS MUCH 
ALL RIGHT WE'LL FIND THEM WE'RE IN OUR OWN 
YEAH YEAH LET'S DO IT LET'S DO 
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND TAKE NOTES ON THIS TOO 'CAUSE 
YEAH I MEAN UH YEAH RIGHT 
SO INITIAL IDEAS 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S SLICK ISN'T IT 
I MEAN LIKE STYLIST YEAH LIKE A JUST A YEAH 
RIGHT SO WE GOT FIVE MINUTES MORE TO CHAT ABOUT THIS PERFECT 
UM SO WE'VE GOT THIS KIND OF AN IDEA OF A TRADE OFF BETWEEN UM UH SIZE AND FUNCTIONALITY 
UM AND WE ALSO 
I'M ALSO GONNA NOT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE THIS IDEA OF UM SO YOU LIKE MAYBE LIKE AN L. LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN TYPE OF REMOTE 
I DON'T THINK ONE EXISTS 
BE A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH ALL THE OTHER UNIVERSAL REMOTES 
UM I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SUCH A THING OUT THERE 
I GUESS WE COULD DO SOME UH DO SOME RESEARCH ON OR ONE OF US COULD DO SOME RESEARCH ON IT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE UM MULTI FORMAT LIKE UM YOU KNOW PAL 
N. T. S. C. REGION ONE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
INTERESTING 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM ALL RIGHT 
SO 
I LI I'M LIKING THAT DO THIS IDEA OF A TOUCH SCREEN REMOTE WITH MULTI FORMAT FEATURES 
UM 
UM 
LET'S SEE 
MM 
UH LET'S SEE 
UM 
YEAH YEAH OKAY 
THINK THEY'RE JUST CALLED FACE PLATES 
I DON'T KNOW 
UM 
MM 
BUT IF WE'RE BUNDLING IT UNLESS WE'RE SELLING THEIR TELLY WITH THE REMOTE 
UM 
COU COULD WE NOT DO SOMETHING WHERE LIKE JUST A LITTLE LIT LIKE LITERALLY JUST A VERY SMALL KIND OF THING THAT COMES WITH THE REMOTE THAT YOU COULD PLACE SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU PRESS AND IT MAKES THE REMOTE PAGE 
KINDA LIKE HOW IN A LOT OF UM UH CORDLESS REGULAR PHONES YOU HAVE A PAGE BUTTON AND IT GOES COULD WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UM YEAH I THINK THIS MATERIAL QUALITY AS WELL LIKE I GUESS WHAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF UM UH YOU KNOW APPLE 'S BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL WITH THIS SURGICAL WHITE KIND OF BUSINESS OR THIS SLEEK KIND OF YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE DO HAVE THE MINIMUM AM AMOUNT I MEAN WE WERE TALKING FINANCES I DUNNO SELLING A A FORTY POUND REMOTE WOULD UH OR A FORTY DOLLAR REMOTE 
TWENTY FIVE EURO REMOTE WOULD BE PRETTY YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE SO MAYBE WE MIGHT WANNA TRADE OFF SOME OF THE FEATURES FOR A LOWER PRICE 
WITHOUT WITHOUT GETTING INTO THAT WHOLE LIKE YOU KNOW GO DOWN TO BARGAIN STORE REMOTE YOU KNOW BARGAIN STORE UNIVERSAL REMOTE THAT'S BLACK AND YOU KNOW M MASSIVE 
SOME KIND OF I DUNNO A BALANCE THERE IN SOMEWHERE 
BUT UM HAVE A THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO HAVE A THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO HOW WE'RE GONNA SELL IT AND UM 
MM 
TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
YEAH 
THEY'RE ALL WEAKER THAN THEY'RE ALL STRONGER THAN THE DOLLAR 
ALTHOUGH COMPUTER PARTS ALL IF YOU'RE GONNA UPGRADE YOUR COMPUTER BUY IT IN THE STATES 
LIKE UM DO YOU GUYS KNOW FRY'S 
HUGE COMPUTER UH ELECTRONICS STORE 
THEY SERVE UM RIGHT THEY USE THE S THEY WILL SELL THINGS OVERSEAS SO YOU CAN BUY STUFF IN AMERICA AND HAVE IT SHIPPED OVER FOR LIKE TWENTY THIRTY POUNDS ABOUT 
RIGHT SO UM LET'S GO AHEAD AND WRAP THAT UP HERE FOR NOW I'M GONNA PUT THESE INITIAL IDEAS THAT WE'VE GOT ON THE AMI PROJECT DOCUMENTS 
SO IF YOU GUYS WE NEED A REMINDER ABOUT WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT UM THE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW KIND OF TRADE OFFS THAT WE'VE GOT AND THE OTHER IDEAS 
YOU CAN CONSULT THEM TO YOUR LEISURE 
AND UH RIGHT SO THANKS FOR THAT 
LET'S JUST UH HEAD BACK TO WORK ON WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEF UH G UH UH GETTING INTO 
UM 
YES 
THANKS GUYS 
GUESS I SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO SET UP STRAIGHT 
UH I THINK MINE'S FALLEN OFF 
WOW 
OH YEAH THAT'S FINE 
RIGHT 
I'M NATHAN I'M FROM CALIFORNIA AND I'M HERE DOING A MASTERS DEGREE IN SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY 
I. C. L. E. 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
WOW 
NO 
SOUNDS NICE 
OH WOW 
THERE'S MORE VOMIT THERE 
ALRIGHT 
YEP 
UM 
LET'S SEE 
YEAH THAT'S THE MUSIC I GREW UP LISTENING TO 
AND SO THERE 
SOMETHING I MISS ABOUT MY HOMETOWN 
BURRITOS 
THAT COST LESS THAN EIGHT POUNDS 
I GREW UP IN SAN DIEGO BUT YEAH UM LA JOLLA P. B. 
BUT REALLY UH I LAST LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO I HAVEN'T LIVED IN CALI WELL I HAVEN'T LIVED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SINCE I WAS EIGHTEEN 
IT'S DIFFERENT 
'CAUSE IN SAN DIEGO TH THE TORTILLAS ARE COOKED ON THE GRILL AND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY STEAM THEM 
YEAH IT REALLY DOES 
MM 
YEAH 
WHERE YOU FROM IN SAN DIEGO 
OKAY 
YEAH MY GRANDPARENTS LIVED IN UM THIRTY SECOND 
CLOSE TO UH DO YOU KNOW WHERE CLARE DE LUNE COFFEE SHOP IS AND 
CAFE FORTE 
COOL 
YEAH 
WOW 
OKAY 
MM 
SOUNDS INTERESTING 
MAYBE OUR PERSONAL COACH WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT 
YEAH 
MAYBE A REMOTE WITH CHANGEABLE FACES LIKE THE FACES THAT YOU CAN BUY FOR PHONES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
S SMALLER'S BETTER 
SIMPLE 
OH RIGHT 
THAT'D BE DIFFERENT 
YEAH 
IT'S GONNA BE TOO COMPLICATED TOO CROWDED WITH BUTTONS AND THINGS 
NEEDS IT NEEDS ONE OUTSTANDING FEATURE TO SET IT APART FROM ALL THE OTHER REMOTES 
RIGHT 
I THINK MAKING IT OUT OF A NICE MATERIAL WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE AS MANY OF THOSE REMOTES THAT YOU USE THESE UNIVERSAL REMOTES LIKE IS CHIP AND LOW QUALITY 
MM 
SOMETHING UH WE'LL HAVE TO COME UP WITH A NAME PATENT IT 
LEOPARD PRINT 
I THINK IT WOULDN'T BE SUCH A BAD IDEA TO HAVE A LIKE A LOCATOR DEVICE 
MAYBE A SIMPLE BUTTON THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR TELEVISION TO HELP YOU FIND YOUR REMOTE 
MM 
TRUE 
YEAH 
I THINK SO 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
'S TRUE 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
HOW'RE WE PLACED IN TERMS OF THE ALRIGHT 
TO FILL 
THAT'S WHY 
SURE 
MM 
I'M RON 
I UH ONCE UPON A TIME STUDIED IN VICTORIA AND I AM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
GO FOR IT 
ALRIGHT 
THINK I'M JUST GONNA PUT DOWN ON UH IN C. D. 
ANYBODY 
NO 
NO 
AFRO BEAT ORCHESTRA VERY COOL 
YEAH 
FIFT S THEY LIKE FIFTEEN MEMBERS FROM BROOKLYN 
UM AND I'M HOPING TO GO TO THE CONCERT IN BELGIUM IN BRUSSELS IN APRIL FIRST 
YEAH 
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE IN BRUSSELS ANYWAYS 
UM THING I LOVE ABOUT EDINBURGH 
LOVE UM 
I JUST CAME FROM GLASGOW AND I'M UM HAPPY TO SAY THAT THERE'S THE THERE'S THE SAME QUANTITY APPROXIMATELY 
UM 
I W 
DOES UH YEAH 
READY 
MINGING 
NICE 
UH-HUH 
NICE 
NICE 
I ASSUME THAT WE'RE BUILDING A STAND ALONE UH REMOTE CONTROL WE CAN'T KIND OF BUILD IT INTO OTHER UH PRODUCTS 
FOR INSTANCE LIKE A MOBILE PHONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OR OR YOU KNOW CAN WE PRODU CAN WE SELL A REMOTE CONTROL PHONE FOR TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OR LESS 
YEP 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
NICE 
HOT 
NOW ARE WE ALSO DISCUSSING KIND OF OUR INITIAL IDEAS AT ALL HERE 
SO DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY INITIAL IDEAS 
BUT I'M THINKING I'M THINKING KIND OF P. D. A. UH DESIGN IS TOUCH SCREEN DESIGN RATHER THAN BUTTON IS THAT YOU CAN KIND OF FLIP AROUND ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS 
IT CONFUSING 
MM-HMM 
POSSIBLY 
I'M PRETTY SURE THERE IS 
I MEAN I I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS A P. D. A. THAT UH JUST POINTS AT HIS TELEV ANY TELEVISION HE WANTS AND IT'LL FIGURE OUT THE THE SPECIFICATIONS OF IT AND WILL CONTROL TO UM SO I TH I ASSUME THAT THAT CAN BE DONE WITH UH KIND OF AROUND THE WORLD 
OH 
I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE UH MULTI PLATE 
NO NO 
I LIKE 
WE SHOULD C WE SHOULD COME UP WITH A FUZZY ONE AS WELL 
FOR THOSE COLD WINTER DAYS 
WELL IF WE BUNDLE IT IS A PHONE THEN YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL IT 
IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT THEN WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING THAT JUST KIND OF RINGS FROM THERE WILL THERE USED TO BE THOSE WHISTLING DEVICES BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ANNOYING 
THE 
YEAH 
THAT'S COOL 
I THINK WE COULD DESIGN INTO THAT 
CURVES 
WE'RE TALKING TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OR TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
SLIGHT DIFFERENCE I GUESS 
NO 
THANK YOU 
OKAY 
GOTTA PLUG YOU ONE 
VERY NICE 
FOR YOUR FIRST POWERPOINT IT'S LOVELY 
FINE 
IT NEEDS YEAH 
COOL 
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE IN OKAY 
THERE YOU GO 
RIGHT 
DOES THAT MEAN I'M UP 
I THINK SO 
OKAY 
UH THAT WOULD BE PERFECT 
THANK YOU 
SLIDE SHOW UP AND RUNNING 
OR NOT 
OH 
OH THERE WE GO 
PERFECT 
OKAY 
SO THIS IS UM 
UM BASICALLY I WAS LOOKING THROUGH SOME MARKETING REPORTS THAT WE'VE GOT AND WE HAD A USABILITY TEST WHERE WE WERE ACTUALLY SORTA LIKE WATCHING A HUNDRED PEOPLE USE T. V. REMOTES AND SO WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE USING AND THEN THEY FILLED OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK AND WHAT THEY DON'T ABOUT THEIR GENERAL T. V. REMOTE CONTROL PRACTICES 
UM PRETTY MUCH THROUGH TESTING WE WERE FINDING OUT THAT MOST OF THE TIME EVERYBODY'S USED TO USING CHANGING THE CHANNEL TURNING IT ON USING THE VOLUME 
UM THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME THAT'S ALL THAT'S GOING ON THE OTHER FUNCTIONS HAPPEN 
FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY'RE IMPORTANT BUT THE PRIMARY USES ARE REALLY REALLY BASIC 
UM AND SO BIG COMPLICATED REMOTES LIKE ONE WE SAW IN THE LAST PRESENTATION ARE REALLY NOT THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S USE 
THEY'RE NOT USING A LOT OF IT THEY DON'T NEED TO 
THEY EVEN FIND IT FRUSTRATING WHEN THERE ARE ALL THESE BUTTONS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH 
AND UM WE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT UH FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR PEOPLE THERE THE WORST THING ABOUT A REMOTE IS HOW OFTEN THEY LOSE IT 
AND THEN THEY CAN'T FIND IT IN THE ROOM 
SO I THINK WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH A PAGER OR SOMETHING WILL REALLY COME INTO PLAY WITH A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE 
UM THERE'S ALSO A SURVEY ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKED ABOUT REMOTES AND PRETTY MUCH THEY ALL THINK THEY'RE HIDEOUS AND NOT VERY USEFUL 
AND THE YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHICS ARE ALL REALLY INTERESTED IN VOICE RECOGNITION OPTIONS 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE READY TO LOOK INTO TECHNICALLY THAT'S UP TO THE DESIGN PEOPLE BUT IT IS IS SOMETHING WORTH THINKING ABOUT 
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC'S OBVIOUSLY THE ONE THAT'S GONNA KEEP GROWING SO IF THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE'RE HEADED IN IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT 
UM BUT BASICALLY IT REALLY SEE THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS AND GETTING TO TO LOOK NICE WHICH ARE 
THE STANDARDS 
SO IT'S A GOOD START FOR US 
AND TO UNPLUG THIS 
AND IT BACK 
THERE YOU GO 
OH RIGHT 
WE'RE NOT CATERING TO THE PENSIONERS OF THE WORLD I DON'T THINK SO 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
OH 
THAT COULD WORK 
I LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
SOMETHING VERY BASIC 
RIGHT 
SO THAT ONLY GONNA BE WITHIN OUR TWO HUNDRED FOOT RANGE THEN 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
OK 
YEAH 
TRUE 
MAKING IT JUST AN OPTION 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
ARE WE STILL THINKING ABOUT THIS SCREEN SORRY 
GO AHEAD 
THE UH IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS TOUCH PAD SCREEN THING IT WOULD BE STILL DO WE KNOW IF THAT'S AN OPTION TECHNICALLY RIGHT NOW IT THAT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WE'RE DOING OKAY 
'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE AN INTERESTING OPTION ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEN YOU COULD HAVE LIKE YOUR PRIMARY SCREEN JUST BE THIS YOU KNOW FOR OUR FIVE BASIC FUNCTIONS 
YOU CAN HAVE 
MENU OPTIONS OR SOMETHING TO HAVE ALL THESE OTHER COMPLICATED VOICE RECOGNITION SETTINGS 
THINGS THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE EVERY DAY AND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA USE BUT IT IS AN OPTION THERE FOR THIS HI TECH MARKET THAT SORT OF OR IS THE SLEEK THING WE'RE GOING FOR 
TRUE 
WORTH LOOKING INTO 
YEAH 
TRUE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
JUST THE CASING 
MM 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
MM 
RIGHT 
WELL IN THE PUBLICITY OF A FACE PLATE ON A PHONE SO YOU HAVE TO IT AND ROUND 
IT IS SORT OF EMBLEMATIC WHEREAS YOU'RE JUST SIT AT HOME AS UNLESS SOMEBODY COMES OVER TO WATCH T. V. 
TRUE 
TRUE 
TRUE 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
TRUE 
'CAUSE IT WOULD HAVE A DOCKING BASE 
YEAH 
CAN WE AFFORD THAT 
AND WILL SOMEBODY BUY IT IF WE DON'T 
RIGHT 
FOR TWELVE EUROS 
IT IS 
FAIR ENOUGH 
THE BASICS 
MM 
'KAY 
MM 
AND UH 
YEAH THE THE FASHION DO 
YEAH 
RIGHT AND THEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH PORTS AND CORDS AND 
YEAH 
FOR NOW 
YEAH 
NICE 
UM 
WELL BUT IF WE'RE GONNA USE A TOUCH SCREEN WHERE IT'S GONNA COME IN LIKE IN YOUR CELL PHONE IT'LL HAVE YOUR YOUR CARRIER PROVIDER NAME COME UP FIRST LIKE WHILE IT'S LOADING AND THEN IT GOES AWAY 
PERHAPS IT COULD BE LIKE A TEMPORARY 
COMES IN EVERY TIME YOU TURN IT ON AND THEN THAT'S IT 'CAUSE IT IS A BIT MUCH TO HAVE TO LIKE ENGRAVED ON THE BACK OR SOMETHING I THINK 
YEAH 
YOU 
YEAH YOU WOULD THINK 
BUT 
IF IT COMES FROM ABOVE 
YEAH 
MM 
WE'RE GOOD 
YEAH 
ALL SET 
OKAY 
COOL 
RIGHT 
SO UM BASICALLY I'M JUST GONNA GO OVER REAL QUICKLY UM SOME NEWS I'VE JUST GOT FROM THE BOARD ON HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS UM REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THEN I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO YOU GUYS TO MAKE BRIEF PRESENTATIONS UM ON WHAT YOU'VE FOUND AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A BIT OF DISCUSSION 
SO BASICALLY UH WHAT I'VE JUST FIND OUT FROM THE BOARD I DUNNO IF YOU GUYS GET THIS EMAIL AS WELL BUT IT NEEDS TO BE TELEVISION ONLY 
SO NO WE'RE NOT DOING D. V. D. WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE IT'S JUST GONNA BE A TELEVISION REMOTE 
UM IT ALSO NEEDS TO HAVE THE COMPANY COLOURS INCLUDED IN IT 
UM SO THAT'S RED AND BLACK 
AND IT HAS TO HAVE THE SLOGAN CASE YOU GUYS FORGET THE SLOGAN IT'S WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
UM AND NO TELETEXT 
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TELETEXT IS BUT I'M ASSUMING YOU GUYS DO SO WE DON'T WANNA INCLUDE THAT UM IN THIS PARTICULAR DESIGN 
FOR REASONS THAT I DON'T REALLY KNOW 
THERE'S BUT IT'S THE BOARD SO THERE YOU GO 
SO BASICALLY UM GIVEN THOSE GUIDELINES WHICH WILL HAVE SOME EFFECT ON HOW WE DESIGN WE'LL DISCUSS IT LATER I MEAN 'CAUSE IT'S TELEVISION ONLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO CHANGE OUR UH UM 
WELL WE CAN S SACRIFICE MORE FUNCTION FOR A BETTER TELEVISION REMOTE 
ANYWAY 
SO I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UH TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE A PRESENTATION ON 
OH RIGHT YEAH 
YEP 
MIGHT HAVE TO HIT FUNCTION F. EIGHT ABOUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA COME UP 
YEP 
COOL 
BRILLIANT 
'KAY 
MM 
'KAY 
FAIR ENOUGH 
'KAY 
SO SO THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN USE MO MODERN TYPES OF POLYMERS 
OR MO MODERN TYPES OF PLASTICS THAT MAYBE DO HAVE SOME KIND OF AESTHETIC VALUE UM LIKE OF A WHITE LIKE IF WE TALK ABOUT LIKE WELL LIKE IN THE LAPT ON THESE LAPTOPS AND OTHER ONES THEY USE A A PRETTY NICE 
YOU CAN DO I SEE THERE SOME KIND OF NICE COLO DER QUALITY PLASTIC THAT WE CAN WORK WITH 
OKAY OKAY 
GREAT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NATHAN 
UM IF NEXT WE CAN HAVE THE UM USER INTERFACE DEVELOPER GO AHEAD AND MAKE A BRIEF PRESENTATION THAT'D BE GREAT AS WELL 
SO PLUG YOURSELF IN HERE 
MM 
UM HIT FUNCTION F. EIGHT REAL QUICKLY HOLD DOWN 
MM 
THERE YOU GO 
SWEET 
YEAH SORRY I COULDN'T GET THAT GO TO USE BEFORE 
OH YEAH LOOK AT THAT 
MM-HMM 
NICE 
OKAY 
GREAT 
THANKS FOR THAT RON 
'KAY YEP THAT'S YOU 
GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT 
THAT'S GREAT 
THANK YOU SARAH 
RIGHT 
SO UM YEP I'LL JUST UH SWITCH THAT BACK HERE 
I'LL FINISH UP WITH JUST A BIT OF DISCUSSION PLAN ON FOR THE NEXT PHASE 
RIGHT SO I THINK WE'VE COVERED MOST OF THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THROUGH THIS UM THROUGH YOU GUYS'S PRESENTATIONS UM WE'VE GOT UH YOU THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SUGGESTS UH ARE PRETTY MUCH EMPHATICALLY SUGGESTED THAT WE NEED TO GO WITH PLASTIC 
UM SARAH SHE'S RECOMMENDED THAT WE GO FOR SIMPLER FUNCTIONS SO FEWER FUNCTIONS UM BUT WE NEED TO DECIDE WHO ARE WE SELLING THIS IT 
YOU USE YOUR STATS SUGGESTED THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE UNDER THIRTY FIVE WANTED THOUGHT ABOUT VOICE CONTROL 
UM SO DO WE WANNA GO FOR THAT OR DO WE WANT TO GO FOR AN OLDER DEMOGRAPHIC 
AND MY THOUGHT SO UM WE'VE GOT W IF WE'RE GONNA GO FOR A SLEEK LIKE I MEAN WE ARE PUTTING THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS UM 
YES 
SO MAYBE THIS WE SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC 
UM 
SO 
UH WE NEED TO WONDER UH UH ABOUT HOW WE MAKE IT BETTER AND SMALLER AND FASTER UM THINK WE'RE CONSTRAINED TO PLASTICS VERY WELL WE'VE GOT THIS IDEA 
RON WAS SAYING WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT UH REVOLUTIONISING THE WAY IT'S LOOKING UM 
WHICH MIGHT BE EASIER GIVEN THAT WE'RE GOING FOR SIMPLER FUNCTION AND THAT WE'RE ONLY GOING FOR A TELLY 
UM SO UM 
HOW THE THIS VOICE OPERATION THING SO I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA UM ASSUMING THAT IT'S DOABLE 
UM AT LEAST FOR THE BASIC CONTROLS MAYBE WE CAN BALANCE IT THAT WAY YOU KNOW WE CAN SEE 
OKAY YOU CAN'T SAY RECORD ALIAS TONIGHT TO SEVEN P. M. BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY UM VOLUME UP 
MM 
RIGHT 
THE DIFFICULTY WH WOULD BE IN UM I THINK LIKE I YOU COULDN'T SPEAK INTO THE REMOTE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND 
'KAY YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT PICKS UP 
A VOICE FROM FAR AWAY 
IF IT'S HIDDEN UNDER THE COUCH BUT THEN AGAIN YOU HAVE THIS W THIS WEE THING YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A LITTLE CHIP OR WHATEVER THAT HAS THE PAGE BUTTON 
MAYBE THAT COULD BE VOICE ACTIVATED TOO 
YEAH 
OR AN ISOLATED MAGNET OR SOMETHING LIKE OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T INTERFERE I DON'T KNOW THAT'D BE THE TECHNICAL THING BUT YEAH I LIKE THAT 
I LIKE THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE PAGING SYSTEM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
ABSOLUTELY 
MM 'KAY UM WELL YEAH I GUESS WE'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE UM IN A LA SLIGHTLY LATER STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT UM BUT YEAH I KNOW THAT'S PERFECTLY VIABLE QUESTION 
MM 'KAY UM SO I'M SEEING THAT WE'RE GONNA JUST BASICALLY FOCUS ON THIS YOUNG DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP UM TO TO THEM 
BUT THEN IN A SENSE THAT ITS BELLS AND WHISTLES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS THEM BUT BASICALLY WE'LL MAKE A SLEEK SIMPLE FUNCTIONED UM UH REMOTE CONTROL 
UM I THINK THIS VOICE RECOGNITION THING IS A WE'VE GOT A MARKET FOR IT UH I DON'T THINK THERE'S TOO MANY 
WE'D MORE OR LESS BE CORNERING THE MARKET IN IT AS WELL WE DON'T HAVE MANY UM 
I APPEAR TO HAVE LOST MY MICROPHONE 
MM 
RIGHT UM WE DON'T HAVE MANY PEOPLE ARE THERE'S NOT VERY MANY COMPETITORS OUT THERE THAT DO THAT IS COOL 
UM RIGHT 
I GUESS WE'VE C WE'VE TOUCHED ON MOST OF THIS 
THE IDEA OF A PAGING FUNCTION A TOUCH SCREEN AND FACE PLATES 
UM 
THE THING WITH I SEE WOULD THERE NOT BE A WE'D HAVE TO MAYBE SACRIFICE THE FACE PLATES FOR A TOUCH SCREEN 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
YEAH 'CAUSE THEN UH YOU WOULD HAVE TO WHO ALL IT'S NOT LIKE WITH CELL PHONES LIKE WHERE YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW NOKIA MODEL X. AND THEN TEN PEOPLE MAKE FACE PLATES FOR IT 
WE'D BE JUST RE MODEL OF PHO OF IT REMOTE CONTROL 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT WELL WE CAN WE CAN DISCUSS THAT ONE FURTHER WHEN WE THINK ABOUT UM WHETHER THE WHEN WE DO COSTS AND SO FORTH UM 
TRUE 
OF PLASTIC IS DEAD CHEAP AND IF WE'RE MAKING THE WHOLE THING OUT OF PLASTIC ANYWAY UM YEAH WE'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE LATER UM BUT YEAH WE WILL HAVE TO EVALUATE WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT 
UM I THINK WE'VE HAD A BIT OF DISCUSSION ALREADY IN THIS THING IN IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THAT CAME UP ON THESE PRESENTATIONS 
YEAH YEAH OKAY 
UM 
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD BE BEST 
LET'S BASED ON WHAT SH ON WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE ALL USED TO UM LET'S GO FOR A PLASTIC 
BUILT OR UH BE PLASTIC CASED 'CAUSE THA THA THAT'S EASY ON THE COST 
TRY TO LOOK FOR SOME KIND OF HIGH QUALITY RECYCLED PLASTIC AS YOU RECOMMENDED AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA 
WITH A TOUCH SCREEN FOR THE BASIC FUNCTIONS 
UM 
AND WE'LL YEAH THE LET'S PROVISIONALLY LET'S GO FOR A TOUCH SCREEN ON WITH SEVERAL SUBMENUS UM FOR POSSIBLE EXTRA STUFF THAT ONE BASICALLY PUT THE CHANNEL AND THE ONE AND OFF SWITCH ON THE TOUCH SCREEN 
UM DO WE HAVE 
MM WAIT A MINUTE IT OCCURS TO ME THAT IF WE HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RECHARGE THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS 
YET AT THE SAME TIME THAT MIGHT HELP FOR THIS WHOLE COMPLAINT OF IT BEING LOST 
MM-HMM 
BUT THEN AGAIN THAT COSTS AS WELL 
HMM 
DO THEY 
OKAY 
WELL I I DON'T THINK YEAH I CAN'T SEE ANYBODY BUYING A LAP A REMOTE CONTROL THAT THEY HAVE TO PLUG IN SO WE'D HAVE TO USE SOME KIND OF NEW BATTERY TECHNOLOGY 
OKAY SO LET'S GO WITH A UM TOUCH SCREEN 
WITH UM SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW WITH WITH SOME KIND OF CUTTING EDGE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY 
YEAH WELL HEY YOU KNOW WELL IT'S IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO 
IF NOT WE CAN ALWAYS DEFAULT TO JUST DOING A A WELL PRESENTED PLASTIC SIMPLE YOU KNOW SO YOU KNOW 
WELL YEAH I MEAN YOU CAN PUT THE WE COULD I I DUNNO I MEAN I SUPPOSE WE COULD PUT THE THE BASICS ON THE CENTRE EASIEST YOU KNOW 
YOU KNOW PEOPLE KNOW THE CHANNEL AND VOLUME FUNCTION MAKE THEM LARGE AND EASY TO GET IT AND THEN THE THE OTHER THE OTHER BITS AND BOBS YOU KNOW GO THROUGH MENU UM WE WE'LL DO THE AESTHETICS 
OKAY SO WE'LL TOUCH SCREEN AND THE BATTERY FOCUS ON UM UH PRESENTATION 
UM IT'S THE UH WITH THIS VOICE RECOGNITION OPTION AS WELL UM JUST USE FOR THE SIMPLE FUNCTIONS THE UM THE ON OFF CHANNELS VOLUME UM 
AND UM A SMALL PAGING FUNCTION 
EVEN IF YOU CAN'T DO VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE PAGING YOU KNOW JUST SOME KIND OF SIMPLE BUTTON THAT'S JUST A I GUESS ANOTHER INFRARED SIGNAL TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WHILE TO EMIT SOME KIND OF PAGING 
JUST A BEEP 
UM RIGHT SO ANY COMMENTS 
THOUGHTS BEFORE WE BREAK INTO GO INTO THE NEXT ROUND OF INDIVIDUAL WORK ON THIS 
W IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IF YOU WERE GOING TO DO A SKIN YOU'D NEED TO HAVE SOME WAY FOR PEOPLE TO DOWNLOAD OR IMPORT SKINS INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH I THINK PERHAPS GOOD IDEA BUT YEAH I THINK THAT THAT IN M MIGHT JUST BE UM 
AND THEY JUST YEAH I THINK THAT ONE MIGHT JUST BE OUT OF THE RANGE FOR THIS PARTICULAR A P. D. A. WOULD THEY WOULD MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FOR A P. D. A. 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE USING IT TO CONNECT UP TO THINGS ANYWAY BUT 
I DUNNO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK 
HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I KNOW I DO IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD SUFFICE TO HAVE JUST THE R. R. IN THERE 
JUS 
BUT APPARENTLY NOT 
SO 
YEAH 
WELL FAIR ENOUGH 
UM AND YEAH THAT WOULD HELP THE BATTERY LIFE IT AND IF IT THE REMOTE THEY DO HAVE TO PRESS A BUTTON FOR THE REMOTE TO TURN ON 
BUT THEN AGAIN WHO WANTS TO TURN ON A REMOTE CONTROL 
KIND OF IF I 
UH TO WAKE UP KEY OR GO INTO LIKE A DORMANT MODE 
OKAY 
OH YEAH I LIKE THAT I LIKE THE IDEA OF UM PUTTING THE LOGO ON THE BOOT UP SCREEN NICE 
UM 
UM COOL IS ANY LAST THINGS BEFORE WE BREAK 
ALRIGHT 
FAIR ENOUGH 
SOUNDS GOOD 
I'M GONNA SAVE THE A COPY OF THIS IN CASE YOU GUYS NEED ANY REMINDERS 
I'M GONNA SAVE A COPY OF THIS AND THE MINUTES THAT I'LL DO IT IN A SECOND AND PUT THEM IN THE SHARED FOLDER FOR LATER REFERENCE 
BRILLIANT 
THAT'S FAB GUYS 
COOL 
OKAY 
SO D I UNPLUG THIS BUT HERE 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
THAT'S PAGE ONE OF MY PRESENTATION 
SO THE UH METHOD 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW REMOTE CONTROLS WORK AND RES UH SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THIS PROJECT 
UM REMOTE CONTROL WORKS AS FOLLOWS 
THIS IS ALL PRETTY BASIC STUFF YOU GUYS 
UM SENDS MESSAGE TO ANOTHER SYSTEM 
SO THERE'S AN ENERGY SOURCE INVOLVED IN THAT LIKE A BATTERY OR SOLAR POWER SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES THERE'S AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT 
WHICH IS THE MICROCHIP UM AND THAT ACTUALLY COMPOSE THE MESSAGES AND USUALLY THE WAY A A REMOTE CONTROL WORKS IS IT SENDS INFRARED BITS TO ANOTHER SYSTEM 
A USER INTERFACE CONTROLS THE CHIP BASICALLY THAT'S THE CASING AND THE BUTTONS AND UM ACCORDINGLY THE MESSAGES AS WELL 
SO MY FINDINGS 
UM I JUST ADD A PRELIMINARY STUDY HERE AND UH I FOUND THAT TOO MUCH METAL IN REMOTE DESIGN COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE INTERFERENCE WITH THE ABILITY OF THE REMOTE TO SEND COMMANDS 
AND TOO MUCH METAL CAN CAUSE REMOTES TO BEHAVE UNEXPECTEDLY BY RECEIVING FALSE SIGNALS 
ME TOO MUCH METAL IS USED SOMETIMES AND PEOPLE PICK UP RADIO SIGNALS AND THE LOOK 
AND THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF THE REMOTE CATCHING ON FOR AND INJURING THE CUSTOMER JUST THINK OF THOSE LAWSUITS THAT'D BE REALLY BAD 
THEREFORE I SUGGEST PRIMARILY PLASTIC CONSTRUCTION 
UM COMPONENTS 
JUST SOME IDEAS THAT I HAD UM ENERGY SOURCE 
IT'S KINDA HIP TO BE ECO FRIENDLY SO I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD DO SOMETHING WITH SOLAR POWER WITH AN ALKALINE BATTERY BACKUP 
UM THE USER INTERFACE I WAS SINCE WE CAN'T USE METAL I WAS THINKING MAYBE A HIGH GRADE RECYCLED PLASTIC 
THE CHIP UM SILICON BASED CHIP I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY WAY AROUND THAT WE CAN'T REALLY BE DIFFERENT IN THAT RESPECT 
UM THE SENDER WELL I'M THINKING INFRARED 'CAUSE IT IS THE INDUSTRY STANDARD 
MULTI CHANNEL THAT'S A WORD I MADE UP I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT MEANS 
UH PAL AND N. T. S. C. COMPATIBLE AND UH PROBABLY A TWO HUNDRED FOOT RANGE 
UH AND THE RECEIVER OF COURSE IS ANY NUMBER OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES 
UM BUT IN THIS CASE IT'LL ONLY BE T. V. S 
UM PERSONAL PREFERENCES I REALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD USE PLASTIC AS OPPOSED TO METAL UM 
THE COMPANY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD THIS KINDS OF LAWSUITS WHICH ADM ADMITTEDLY IS GONNA COME TO THE COST OF A CERTAIN AESTHETIC VALUE 'CAUSE WE WERE THINKING 
RIGHT 
YEAH THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM 
UM FOR EXAMPLE THE PLASTIC THEY HAVE IN YOUR LAPTOP THERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO 
THAT'S THE END OF MY PRESENTATION 
SO IT PLUGGED IN WELL 
THERE IT GOES 
COMPUTER ADJUSTING 
MM 
MM 
RIGHT 
I THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO UH COMBINE THE LOCATOR DEVICE AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY 
WITH A SIMPLE COMMAND LIKE LOCATE 
AND THEN IT COULD START TO BEEP AND 
THEREFORE BE FOUND 
OH YEAH I THINK THAT'S VERY DOABLE 
MM 
IT'S A GOOD POINT 
YEAH 
MM 
I WAS THINKING UH 
UH GO AHEAD 
YEAH 
GOTTA WONDER THOUGH IF WE'RE ADDING SO MUCH TECHNOLOGY TO THIS ONE REMOTE 
ARE WE STILL GONNA BE ABLE TO MEET AT TWELVE POU OUR TWELVE FIFTY EURO YOU KNOW GOAL FOR SELLING THESE THINGS 
IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO HANDLE ALL THESE FUNCTIONS WITH JUST ONE MICROCHIP 
THE MICROCHIP IS PROBABLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART OF THE THE WHOLE MECHANISM 
SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER 
BACK TO THE UH THE COST THE MATERIAL 
WE HAVE TO ASK WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO INCLUDE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FACE PLATES WITH THE PACKAGE 
THAT'S SOMETHING I W FOR SAY WE'RE INCLUDING THREE OR FOUR FACE PLATES IT'S GONNA DRIVE THE COST UP 
AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS IF WE DO INCLUDE THEM ARE WE REALLY IN A POSITION TO EVALUATE THAT MARKET 
WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY TESTS ON FACE PLATES AND WHETHER 
SO IF THERE IF THERE'S EVEN INTEREST OUT THERE 
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IT SOUNDS KIND OF LIKE A GIMMICK THAT WOULDN'T REALLY GO ANYWHERE 
YEAH 
CAN WE AFFORD TO INCLUDE ONE OF THIS 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
SINCE WE'RE DOING UH TOUCH SCREEN 
DO WE WANNA LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO INPUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SKINS FOR THE YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL INTERFACE PART OF IT AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
OR IS IT JUST GONNA BE IN TOUCH SCREEN FOR EVERYBODY 
WHAT WHAT WOULD BE IN THAT TOUCH SCREEN 
'CAUSE YOU SAID EARLIER THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT COMPANY COLOURS AND UM 
LOGO OR SOMETHING OR MOTTO I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID 
'S TOO MUCH 
THINK WE JUST NEED TO COME UP WITH A NICE BLACK AND RED INTERFACE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN 
THAT'D BE OKAY 
MM 
TRUE 
PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA WANT THEIR REMOTE TO BOOT UP AND TO SEE FLASHING THINGS COME ON 
THEY JUST WANT TO TO BE ONE AND READY TO GO 
THE 
WELL SO 
HERE WE HAVE A UH MY TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN PRESENTATION 
UM AS A FEW OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE NEED HERE 
UH WE N BASICALLY NEED TO OPERATE AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE 
IT NEEDS TO BE UNIVERSAL UM AND POSSIBLY UH OPERATE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVICES ALTHOUGH WE NOW UH FIND THAT UH THAT THAT'S NO PROBLEM 
UM SO SOME OF MY FINDINGS 
UM BASICALLY WANNA SEND MESSAGES UH IT A TELEVISION SET 
UM THAT WOULD BE ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS UH SUCH AS SWITCH ON THE TELEVISION 
UH SWITCH TO THE NEXT CHANNEL THAT SORT OF THING I THINK WE'RE ALL QUITE UH 
QUITE UH INTELLIGENT AND KNOW KNOW WHAT A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL DOES 
UM NOW SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS I FOUND IS A A COMPLICATED REMOTE CONTROL SORRY THAT WE CAN'T QUITE SO MY RED THERE VERY WELL BUT UH THIS REMOTE CONTROL HAS MANY FUNCTIONS UM SO IT CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT IT UH IT IS QUITE COMPLICATED AND MOST USERS WILL FIND IT UH FIND THAT THEY WON'T USE MOST OF THE FUNCTIONS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THEM AND DON'T WANNA TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT 
SO YOU ALSO NOTICE IT'S QUITE A BORING DESIGN 
UM 
ANOTHER REMOTE CONTROL SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IT'S A SIMPLER REMOTE CONTROL UH MANY LESS BUTTONS BUT HE HAS MANY FEWER FUNCTIONS 
UM M MUCH EASIER FOR THE USER TO MANIPULATE AND SO 
UM IT ALSO HAS A BIT OF A CHEAP LOOK AND IT'S ALSO QUITE BORING 
SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
REVOLUTIONISE THE IDEA OF UH A REMOTE CONTROL 
UM SO ATTAIN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF A COMPLICATED DEVICE BUT AS A SIMPLE FORMATTED DISPLAY UH FOR THE USER TO TO WORK WITH 
AND I WAS GONNA ADD ANOTHER UH SLIDE HERE BUT I DIDN'T QUITE HAVE TIME THERE 
UM 
JUST INCORPORATING SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY LIKE UH HAVING MULTIPLE FACE BUT IT'S UH 
I CAN PLUG YOU ONE 
SOUNDS GOOD 
A LITTLE STICKY PAD TO STICK ON TOP OF YOUR UH TELEVISION 
AND YOU JUST SAY SOMETHING TO NOT THAT AND IT 
FINDS YOUR 
THE OTHER THING SO WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE SIMPLICITY OF A REMOTE CONTROL AND KIND OF PUT THE MORE COMPLICATED THINGS INTO A VOICE CONTROL 
SO IT COULD BE SOLD TO BOTH THE YOUNGER MARKET AND THE OLDER MARKET 
AND THE YOUNGER MARKET COULD USE KIND OF THE VOI VOICE CONTROL METHOD AND THE OLDER MARKET MIGHT MIGHT K EXACTLY AND MIGHT CONSIDER THE OLDER MARKET COULD USE THE SIMPLER DESIGN WITH THE TRADITIONAL BUTTONS AND WHAT NOT 
'S DEFINITELY AN OPTION TECHNICALLY 
I'VE LOOKED INTO UH COSTS OF UH TOUCH SCREEN METHODS AND WHAT NOT 
THEY SEEM TO BE UH YOU KNOW ALMOST AS CHEAP AS A BUTTON METHOD AT THIS POINT 
UM I'M NOT SURE THAT'S SINCERELY CORRECT 
I THINK IF YOU KIND OF TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF A MOBILE PHONE THAT UH TRYING TO PASS A PORTION OF THE DEVICE IS NOT INTERCHANGEABLE WHEREAS THE SURROUNDING PORTIONS ARE INTERCHANGEABLE 
WE COULD HAVE THE CASING THE THE FACE PLATES 
WELL HOPEFULLY SOME PEOPLE HAVE PEOPLE COMING OUT OVER IT W IT HANG OUT TO YOUR HOUSE AND MOST PEOPLE HAVE THEIR TELEVISIONS IN THE LIVING ROOM 
OH 
SURE 
WELL HAVE WE CONFIRMED THAT WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD WITH A UH TOUCH SCREEN UM 
INTERFACE 
SO THIS NEW LITHIUM BATTERIES THEY LOST TWENTY YEARS EVEN WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN 
THIS NEW ONES 
BE INTERESTING 
WE PUT FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS 
YEAH 
UH I I'M I'M AN AGREEMENT WITH THAT I'M WONDERING HOW WE'RE GONNA GET UH WE PUT FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS INTO THIS DEVICE 
I'M HOPING FOR A SUBLIMINAL MAYBE HALF A MILLISECOND SO IT TURNS ON 
MM-HMM 
WELL ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THE SCREEN AND IT AUTOMATICALLY GOES ON 
YEP 
GOES INTO A SLEEP MODE 
I'VE PUT MY FILES IN THE SHARED FOLDER AS WELL 
THAT WENT WELL THANK YOU 
PERFECT 
GO AHEAD 
NICE 
MM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
NICE 
INTERESTING 
MM 
GOOD CALL 
CHOOSE IT 
WELL I'D SAY SHOP AROUND BUT WITH OUR TIME CONSTRAINTS IS THAT REALLY A FEASIBLE OPTION 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
UM 
IT'S AN OPTION 
UH BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S I'VE GOT SOME RESEARCH ALREADY IN LIKE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND TRENDS IN CASING RIGHT NOW WHICH ACTUALLY MIGHT EVEN COME INTO PLAY BEFOREHAND 
IT MAY HELP US DECIDE FOR NOW 
TEMPORARILY ANYWAY 
I GUESS SO 'CAUSE I FOUND SOME INTERESTING THINGS 
YOU WAITING FOR ME 
I KNOW WHAT A TEASER AIN'T IT 
UM 
RIGHT 
SO CURRENT MARKET TRENDS 
SCREEN 
UM BASICALLY I WAS LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET RIGHT NOW AND WHAT'S GOING ON ON THEIR DESIGN FIELDS 
IT IS SORT OF WHAT'S WHAT'S TRENDY WHAT'S NEW WHAT'S HAPPENING 
UM REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT NOW BASICALLY EVERYBODY SAYS THEY WANT NEWER FANCIER MORE EXCITING THEY'RE SICK OF THIS BORING 
NORMAL FUNCTIONAL UM THAT WE NEED INNOVATIVE DESIGN OPTIONS AND THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EASY USER INTERFACE 
UM THE CHALLENGE IS THAT CURRENT TRENDS RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE BOARD ON FASHION IN FURNITURE 
IN TECHNOLOGY IS A VERY ORGANIC FRUIT AND VEGETABLE KIND OF THING 
NOW I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW TOMATO SHAPED REMOTE CONTROLS OR ANYTHING 
BUT I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE MAYBE IT IS UM NATURAL COLOURS LIKE IF WOOD IS AN OPTION THAT WHOLE ORGANIC SLEEK CLEAN 
V LINE THING MAY BE SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO 
DIFFERENT SKIN OPTIONS OR IF WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS TOUCH PLATE THING OR TOUCH FACE SCREEN INTERFACE UM 
MAYBE HAVING THE B IMAGES BE SPECIFIC LIKE YOU COULD CHOOSE YOUR MENU BULLETS TO BE 
A DIFFERENT SHAPE OR OKAY INTO THE EXAMPLE I WOULD CHOOSE 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT TO SORT OF AND THE APPARENTLY THE FEEL OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF YOURS IS SPONGY 
UH NOT SOMETHING I I'VE COME UP WITH A THOUGH IF WE CAN GET AROUND IT GETTING PILOTING I THOUGHT MAYBE A CASING OPTION LIKE UH 
NOT LIKE A SKIN BUT LIKE A HOLDER ALMOST IF YOU COULD DO LIKE UM LEATHER OPTIONS OR WOOD OPTIONS OR SOMETHING 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING WAY TO GO 
UM YEAH SO SOMETHING TO SIT ON FOR NOW 
SO OVERALL I THINK WE SHOULD STICK WITH WHAT WE'RE FINDING EVERYONE'S LOOKING FOR EASY TO USE 
TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE AND THIS FANCY NOW I THINK PERHAPS THE DOUBLE CURVE THING AND MAYBE THIS RUBBER OPTION IS OUR BEST WAY TO GO FOR RIGHT NOW 
UM 
YEAH 
UM 
WELL I DO BUT THEN OF THE TOUCH SCREEN THING ISN'T GONNA WORK OUT FOR SO THAT'S REALLY A NON ISSUE 
TRUE 
VERY TRUE 
VERY TRUE 
VERY MUCH SO 
UM 
WE COULD 
I THINK THAT GOES AGAINST THE WHOLE FANCY SOMETHING A NEW LINE BUT WORTH A SHOT 
UH IT COULD BE IT COULD BE UM 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I KNOW 
NO PROBLEM 
MM 
YEAH 
VERY TRUE VERY TRUE 
MM 
HMM 
OKAY 
MM RIGHT 
MM 
NICE 
MM 
MM 
I THINK IT'S ARE MOST MARKETABLE FEATURE JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO NOW AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS SHOWING UP ON OTHER PLACES 
BUT CAN WE REALLY AFFORD IT 'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE A REALLY MAIN COST SOURCE THEN RIGHT 
PER 
PIECE 
I KNOW 
AND OUR GOAL WAS TO BE UNDER TWELVE FIFTY OR WE HAVE TO BE UNDER TWELVE FIFTY 
DO WE REMEMBER 
OKAY 
CAN WE JUSTIFY IT 
RIGHT 
THOUGH I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY FOR I MEAN IF YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR AN EXPENSIVE HIGH CLASS REMOTE YOU'RE GONNA EXPECT TO TO DO SOMETHING 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
SO IF WE CAN CUT SOME CORNERS 
RIGHT 
WELL AND WE CAN LOOK INTO THIS OTHER MANUFACTURING OPTION AND MAYBE WE CAN GET 'EM SOMEWHERE ELSE CHEAPER 
RIGHT 
IT'S A STARTING POINT ANYWAY SO 
MM 
YEAH 'CAUSE WITH VOICE RECOGNITION 
I MEAN REALLY THIS IS PRETTY BELLS AND WHISTLES KINDA REMOTE 
I THINK WE'D HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN 'EM DEFINITELY 
PRICE WISE 
TRUE 
WE'VE ALREADY GOT IT 
PRETTY MUCH 
RIGHT AND THEY SAID THEY WANTED VOICE RECOGNITION 
COURSE MAYBE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OF THIS WHOLE TOUCH SCREEN OPTION 
BUT DEFINITELY WE KNOW THE MARKET IS THERE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION IS TO SAY WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND WE'RE NOT GONNA USE IT EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW IT'LL SELL 
IS A CALL I DON'T THINK I CAN GIVE THE HIGHS UPS 
LIKE REALLY I CAN'T GO ON AND SAY NO WE'RE GONNA JUST IGNORE EVERYTHING WE KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL WE ALREADY HAVE RESEARCH BACKING VOICE RECOGNITION AS YOU KNOW 
FISCALLY SOLVENT 
BUT UH I I I PERSONALLY WOULD TEND TO ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT IF THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA SELL I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO GO WITH AND MAYBE WE CAN TABLE THIS TOUCH SCREEN FOR OUR NEXT MODEL 
MM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
AND WE'RE STILL NOT THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS BATTERY ISSUE NEARLY AS MUCH THERE WE CAN STICK WITH WHAT WE'VE ALREADY GOT 
IN A LOT OTHER WAYS TO 
I THINK IT'S OUR LOWER RISK OPTION WHICH FOR RIGHT NOW WE CAN HAVE IT IN THE MARKET SOONER WHICH IS ALL IN ALL OUR BEST OPTION 
SO AND WHEN ARE WE GONNA HAVE BASIC PROTOTYPES COMING UP NEXT THAT'S YOU GUYS'S NEXT STEP RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WELL WHAT IF PEOPLE WITH LIKE THE T. V. ON THEIR BASEMENT LIKE WHAT IF WHA WE CAN'T GUARANTEE SUNLIGHT EVERYWHERE SO HAVING A SECONDARY SOURCE IS PROBABLY 
YEAH 
TRUE 
TRUE 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
OH 
INTERESTING 
I IF IT'S GOT VOICE RECOGNITION IT CAN BE TECHNICALLY ANYWHERE IN YOUR ROOM AND STILL DO ITS JOB 
TRUE AND I PROBABL I THINK WE'RE BANKING ON SELLING IT IT MORE THAN JUST VOICE RECOGNITION PEOPLE 
LIKE WE WANT TO TO WORK FUNDAMENTALLY AS A BASIC MANUAL TOO RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
YEAH 
WITH THE B YEAH 
MM-HMM 
TRUE 
WAY TO GO 
YEAH I'M THINKING OF THE AIRPORT PORTAL YOU KNOW LIKE THAT LITTLE POD LOOKING THING 
RIGHT 
THAT WOULD BE KINDA NEAT 
TERRACOTTA BOWL OR SOMETHING 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH WHICH IS THE NEXT BIG THING SO THAT'S NOT GONNA HURT US THERE 
RIGHT 
HANDY 
OKAY 
MM 
RIGHT 
WELL WHEN THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE ONLY USING THE MOST PRIMARY FUNCTIONS IN A DAILY BASIS 
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULD COMPLETELY RULE OUT MAJOR FUNCTIONS THEY SHOULD BE SECONDARY AT LEAST IF NOT FUNCTIONALLY THEN VISUALLY LIKE THIS SHOULDN'T BE 
TAKE PRECEDENCE YEAH 
RIGHT 
AND THEY SLIDE 
WELL AND DO WE WANNA CONSIDER LIKE AN IPOD SCREEN WHICH ISN'T A TOUCH SCREEN BUT YOU'RE STILL SCROLLING THROUGH MENU OPTIONS IN UP 
TRUE WE'RE STILL NOT MAKING IT EASIER THAN 
TRUE 
FAIR ENOUGH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IT'S JUST A SCROLL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
PROBABLY 
RIGHT 
MM 
WELL NO IT'S BASIC JUST LIKE FOUR DIRECTIONS THAT ARE THAT CAN USE AS MENU OR CHANNEL AND VOLUME OR HOWEVER YOU WANNA DO IT 
ARE REALLY VERSATILE AND EVERYBODY'S ALREADY GOT THEM AT SOME EXTENT ON THE REMOTES THEY ALREADY OWN SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE DEALING WITH EVERYBODY RELEARNING THINGS 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING ANYBODY'S GONNA WANNA BUY A NEW FOR 
MM 
RIGHT PARTICULARLY IN TECHNOLOGICAL FIELDS SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE HEADED 
OH 
UH IT WASN'T IN THE WAY BUT YEAH WHATEVER 
NO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH GET IN THERE 
YEAH TOTALLY 
COOL 
COOL 
THAT'S GREAT 
ALRIGHT LET ME JUST POWERPOINT THIS UP 
RIGHT SO UM THIS MEETING WILL BE ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
DON'T ASK ME IS PRECISELY WHAT CONCEPTUAL DESIGN SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED TO DO 
UM THINK IF IT 'S KIND OF UH TURNING THE ABSTRACT INTO SLIGHTLY MORE CONCRETE 
NO THIS MEETING IDEALLY WE'LL COME TO SOME FINAL DECISIONS ON WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FOR THE PROTOTYPE 
UM 
RIGHT SO UM APOLOGIES FOR THE LAST MEETING IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT I DID NOT MAKE THE ROLES CLEAR ENOUGH 
UM SO I WILL ATTEMPT TO DO IS MORE ACCURATELY IN THIS PARTICULAR MEETING 
UM FAIR ENOUGH THANKS FOR THE INPUT 'S ALWAYS GOOD 
UM 
SO BASICALLY ALL WE'RE GONNA DO IS HAVE SOME PRESENTATIONS AGAIN MUCH LIKE LAST TIME UM AND GONNA GO THROUGH YOU 
UH WHOEVER WANTS TO GO FIRST IS F FINE BY UM UM AND WE'LL COLLATE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT UM WHAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE LAST MEETING POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS 
AND THEN WE'LL MAKE SOME MORE DECISIONS ON UM BASIC UH FROM UP OR DO ON HOW WE WANT THIS REMOTE CONTROL TO LOOK AND WORK 
SO PERFECT 
SO WITHOUT THE FURTHER ADO WHOEVER WANTS TO GO FIRST IS FOR IT 
ALRIGHT NATHAN TAKE IT AWAY 
IT IS NATHAN RIGHT 
I'M NOT CALLING YOU THE WRONG NAME OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
GOOD 
NICE 
MM 
HMM 
WHAT KIND OF THE THICKNESS ARE WE LOOKING AT 
OKAY BRILLIANT 
HMM 
HMM 
UM MAYBE IS THERE AN OPTION THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT OFF OR ONE IS A PERSON CAN SELECT LIKE 
YEAH I LIKE THE IDEA IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
CAN WE DO MARKETING PILOTING TOO 
TRY TO SEE WHAT KIND BEFORE WE LAUNCH CAN WE SEE HOW THEY'RE RECEIVED 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY PERFECT 
GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NATHAN 
THAT'S PERFECT SO I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE FOR YOU TO TAKE IT FROM HERE 
FASCINATING COMPELLING EVEN 
TOMATOES 
SLICK SLICK 
INTERFACE UH THE INTERFACE GRAPHICS FOR THE UM 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH IT'S LIKE YEP IT'S UBIQUITOUS ISN'T IT 
GREAT THANKS FOR THAT SARAH 
RON 
YEAH 
LOT OF SINGLE PEOPLE IN THE UM IN THE OR IN THE REMOTE CONTROL RESEARCH TEAM AT THE 
MM 
MM 
YEAH I CAN SEE 
MM 
GREAT 
GREAT WONDERFUL RON COOL 
LOT OF GOOD IDEAS GOOD FACTS TO HAVE 
THAT'S WHAT THEY AND IT'S LIKE A LITTLE DONGLE IT JUST STICKS UP THIS FURTHER AS YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND UP EVERY TIME 
JUST CONNECT TO MY KINGDOM 
RIGHT SO GOOD TO KNOW ALL THAT STUFF THANKS GUYS UM 
NOW WE KIND OF HAVE TO COME TO SOME DECISIONS UM 
I FIGURE WE CAN JUST GO DOWN THE LINE AND ALL THREE OF US CAN HAVE A CHAT ABOUT IT 
UM 
BASED ON WHAT NATHAN PRESENTED AS FAR AS THE UM VARIOUS COSTS AND BENEFITS UM I THINK 
I DUNNO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THE TOUCH SCREEN AT THIS POINT 
'KAY 
'KAY 
MM-HMM 
TO PRODUCE EACH ONE 
MM 
HMM 
WELL 
THERE IS IT'S JUST TO USE A QUESTION OF AND HOW MUCH CA O DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO INCREASE THE PRICE TO MAKE MONEY 
UM FROM TWELVE FIFTY IF WE D WANNA GET OUR FIFT UH HUNDRED PER CENT PROFIT MARGIN UM THAT WOULD MEAN SELLING IT FROM TWENTY FIVE 
IF YOU MULTIPLY SEVENTEEN FIFTY BY TWO THAT'S THIRTY FIVE 
SO 
FROM THE BOARD UM WELL 
THAT'S TRUE I MEAN 
AND THAT'S IT BE FOR THE UM THE PER CENT OF THE MARKET WE'RE NOT GOING FOR MASS ANY YOU KNOW 
MASS SALES ANYWAY WE'RE GONNA MAKE I MEAN WE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SELLING EIGHT ZILLION OF THESE THINGS 
WE JUST COULDN'T NOT FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS SO 
WE COULD PROBABLY MAYBE SHRINK THE PROFIT MARGINS RATHER THAN SELLING FOR TWENTY FIVE SELL 'EM FOR THIRTY BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HAVE FINANCE DEAL WITH 
UM I SAY THAT WE PROVISIONALLY GO WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN OR WH Y WH WHAT WAS YOUR THOUGHT ON THE MATTER RON 
MM 
NO WE COULD HAVE A IS VERY SIMPLE TOUCH SCREEN YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS THE OPPORTUNITY 
IF IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE IPOD OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW W W YEAH I GUESS WE CAN PLAY AROUND WITH IT A BIT 
ALRIGHT LET'S LET'S SAY THAT OKAY SO THE TOUCH SCREEN WILL BE OUR UM OUR MAIN SELLING POINT HERE 
SO 
THE VOICE REC THING I MEAN IF IF WE'RE LOOKING AT BOTTOM LINE 
NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT UPPING THE COST TO SEVENTEEN TO GET THE TOUCH SCREEN ON I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO DROP THE VOICE REC 
YEAH 
HMM 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IN IT NATHAN 
BUT THE VOICE REC 
MM 
YEAH 
I CAN'T SEE HOW IT WOULDN'T I MEAN THERE'S YOU KNOW THE OLD APHORISM YOU CAN HAVE TOO FAST 
YOU CAN HAVE TO CHEAP OR YOU CAN HAVE TO QUALITY PICK TWO OF THREE 
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T HAVE ALL THREE 
IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE 
WELL IF WE'RE GONNA PICK BETWE E ALRIGHT SO WE HAVE TO PICK BETWEEN ONE OF THE TWO 
UM 
OTHERWISE YEAH WE JUST TO JUST BECOMES COST PROHIBITIVE 
WHAT WHICH WHICH DO WE SUSPECT WE SHOULD HOLD O WE SHOULD HOLD ON IT 
'KAY 
WHAT DOES THE COST LOOK LIKE RON 
SO IT CHEAPER TO DO THE V. R. OR TO DO THE UH TOUCH SCREEN 
NATHAN 
MM 
RIGHT 
MM 
OKAY 
SO I'M GETTING ALRIGHT SO MORE OR LESS YOU GUYS THINK THAT O O OF THE TWO OF 'EM THE VOICE RECOGNITION WILL BE BETTER 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SORTED 
WE WILL MEET THE TOUCH SCREEN IN FAVOUR OF VOICE RECOGNITION 
YEAH WELL WE'LL WE'LL SIC WE'LL SORT OUT WHAT TO WHAT IF WHAT ELSE WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT FOR THE PROTOTYPE BUT YEAH THAT'S OUR NEXT STEP 
IT'LL BE A DEVELOPING OF PROTOTYPE 
YES 
WE'LL JUST RUN THROUGH IT YEAH YEAH UM 
YOU DISCUSSED EITHER A LITHIUM OR A SOLAR POWER 
WOULD THE SOLAR POWER BE ENOUGH TO FUEL A VOICE RECOGNITION 
OR THIS KINESTHETIC ONE WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH TO FUEL A VOICE RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL 
MM 
MM 
YEP 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK RON 
OKAY 
HMM 
YEAH 
WELL WE HAVE TO HAVE BUTTONS ON IT IT AS WELL 
BUT THAT'S DONE 
THAT'S NO BOTHER I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE CATALOGUE FROM PLACES LIKE WITH SHARPER IMAGE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT HAVE OR LIKE UM WHO IS IT 
APPLE MAKES THIS REALLY PRETENTIOUS SPEAKERS WITH THE THE SUB WOOFERS YOU KNOW LIKE COLOUR AND GLASS AND YOU KNOW AND THEN THEY GET THIS LITTLE PYRAMIDAL TYPE OF UM SPEAKERS 
I MEAN WHY NOT HAVE A LITTLE ROUNDED KIND OF THING IT COULD STILL HAVE THE BASIC BUTTONS ON IT 
UM 'CAUSE WE'RE GOING FOR BASIC FUNCTIONALITY PRIMARILY AS WELL 
AND MAYBE A MENU BUTTON AND SO FORTH 
YOU KNOW UM AS A CHANNEL BUTTON TO SCROLL THROUGH THE MAIN IDEA IF THEY WANT TO RECORD PROGRAMMES OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW I MEAN WE CAN SORT THAT IT 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
I MEAN A NICE ALTHOUGH WE DO UM WHO UH SO I'M RECALLING THAT SHE MENTIONED THAT WE N NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE SURGICAL WHITE KIND OF BRUSHED ALUMINIUM THING AND GET BACK TO IT BUT YOU COULD HAVE A VERY TASTEFUL UM WOOD COLOURED OR EARTH TONE KIND OF UM 
STILL I MEAN YEAH ALONG THOSE LINES 
YEAH I LIKE THAT I LIKE THAT DO A LOT 
UM LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO AS FAR AS THAT GOES 
AND THE UH THE MATERIAL LIKE THE PLASTICS AND SO FORTH WE WERE DISCUSSING THAT BEING UH USING LIKE A RUBBER KIND OF SOFTER FEEL 
UM YOU KNOW LI LIKE IF YOU FEEL THE THE TOP ON THIS PEN IT'S A BIT GIVES JUST A BIT 
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WHERE IT'S UH A A MORE ADVANCED F FORM OF PLASTIC THAT HAS SOME KIND OF A TACTILE RESPONSE TO IT 
MM 'KAY 
YEAH LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO A SQUISHY NON REMOTE CONTROL LOOKING REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT IT BE FOR YEAH I MEAN 
YOU JUST C YOU COULD JUST PUT IT LITERALLY PUT IT IN THE THE ON THE COFFEE TABLE NEXT TO THE TELLY AND SAY VOLUME UP 
YEAH I LIKE IT I LIKE THE IDEA THAT'S GOOD 
UM AND WE'VE SORTED OF DISCUSSED COSTS UM 
I GUESS WE'LL A THAT'S GONNA BE UH A THING IF WE RUN A BIT OVER BUDGET THAT MIGHT BE OKAY UM 
WE'LL HAVE MORE OF AN IDEA WHEN THE PROTOTYPE 
HAVE MORE OF A WE'LL HAVE MORE OF AN IDEA LATER ON 
UM 
AND WE JUST YEAH GO FROM THERE 
UM SO WE'VE REVISITED THE TOUCH SCREEN AND MORE OR LESS RULED THAT IT UM 
I THINK SO WE'RE MORE OR LESS CAN WE WHO WHO WE'RE MORE OR LESS IN AGREEMENT THAT WE WANT TO HAVE A UM A SIMPLE KIND OF FUNCTION 
YOU KNOW NOT TOO COMPLEX 
LIKE MAYBE HAVE MAIN THINGS 
MM 
YES 
YEAH WE'VE ALSO GOT THE THE UM THE THING IF IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A NON REMOTE LOOKING REMOTE HOW DO WE YEAH 
BU BUT NO I MEAN WE COULD DO A SLIDE OR A COMPARTMENT YOU KNOW 
LIKE IF IT SAY IT'S A LIT LITTLE VAGUELY OVOIDAL TYPE OF THING IT'D BE EASY TO HAVE A COMPARTMENT IN THERE 
OR YOU KNOW 
A B A B A A SERIES OF YOU KNOW THERE ARE FOUR BUTTONS WITH A MENU BUTTON AND THEN A SIDE ONE IS UP AND DOWN TYPE OF THING 
LIKE IN UM LIKE IN A D. V. D. PLAYER 
YOU KNOW YOU USE THE MODERN D. V. D. PLAYERS'LL JUST HAVE UM A MENU BUTTON ON THE SIDE AND THEN FOR BUTTONS AROUND THEM AND YOU CAN JUST KIND OF MANOEUVRE THROUGH THE MENU LIKE THAT 
WELL IT SEEMS LIKE I DUNNO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE COULD JUST DO THE UM STICK WITH THE RUBBER 'CAUSE SINCE WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE USING SOME KIND OF UM RUBBER FOR THE OUTSIDE CASE WE MIGHT AS WELL STICK WITH THAT UM 
MM 'KAY UM 
WE'VE ALREADY KIND OF COVERED THIS AS WELL 
THAT SEEMS TO BE SELLING UM AND WE WE'VE MORE OR LESS AGREED THAT WE WANT TO KAR TARGET THIS YOUTH MARKET UM 
ESPECIALLY NOW WITH EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS BEING SUCH A LARGE QUANTITY OF THE POPULATION 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UM 
YEAH ALRIGHT WELL 
MORE OR LESS COVERED WHAT WE NEED TO COVER I THINK OF IN IN ANY FINAL THOUGHTS BEFORE WE THINK ABOUT DOING THE PROTOT MOVING ON TO THE PROTOTYPE 
RIGHT 
I WAS JUST GONNA STEP ON IT UM I WASN'T 
OH MY BAD UM SORRY 
THE UM YEAH OKAY I WAS JUST GONNA ASSIGN TASKS IN THE NEXT B ANYTH ANY OTH ANY OTHER FINAL THOUGHTS BEFORE WE GO AHEAD AND COOL 
UM 
YEAH 
WELL THEN AGAIN COLOURS WOULDN'T BE SO HARD TO DO YOU COULD HAVE UH A YOU KNOW A UM UH KIND OF A NATURAL WOOD COLOUR 
LIKE A STAINED WOOD AND UM I DON'T KNOW OLIVE GREEN OR SOMETHING 
THAT WOULDN'T BE AS MUCH OF A PROBLEM TO INCORPORATE INTO THE COLOUR OF THE THING 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD ID OKAY SO LET'S WORK ON UH MULTIPLE CASE COLOURS 
BUT YEAH STICK WITH THE SAME KIND OF KINDA YEAH THE SAME BASIC NON REMOTE KIND OF REMOTE DESIGN 
COOL 
ALRIGHT SO WE'LL HAVE THE NEXT MEETING ABOUT HALF AN HOUR UM 
I WANT THE UH I'D LIKE NATHAN I'D LIKE YOU TO WORK ON JUST THE BASIC LOOK AND FEEL WHAT CAN WE ACCOMPLISH 
UM GIVEN THOSE PARAMETERS THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA SORT OF HAVE THIS KIND OF UH NON REMOTE REMOTE 
UM WHAT OUR OUR BROAD CONSTRAINTS BEFORE WE DEVE DESIGN A PROTOTYPE 
AND UM RON IF YOU CAN 
FIGURE OUT HOW PROBABLY BEST TO LAY OUT THIS IDEA OF THIS SIMPLE DESIGN WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION BUILT IN AND ALSO THIS KIND OF DROP DOWN OR IS IN THE SIDE KIND OF MENU OPTIONS SIMPLE 
SOMEHOW WORK OUT HOW WE CAN GET THIS ALL AS IN THE SAME PLACE 
UM AND IF YOU CAN CHECK PRODUCT EVALUATION WITH UM SOME PILOTS AND STUFF 
UM I AND YOU GUYS TO WORK TOGETHER ON MAKING A PROTOTYPE UM USING UM PROTOTYPE BUILDING MATERIALS UM 
AND ALSO UM SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR COACHES AS WELL 
SO THAT'S WHAT TO START WITH FOR NOW IS THAT ALRIGHT YOU GUYS FEEL CLEAR ABOUT THIS 
ALRIGHT 
I GUESS WE'LL JUST HIT THE BRICKS 
THANKS GUYS 
'KAY 
I'LL GO FIRST 
NO NATHAN'S FINE 
IT'S EITHER NATHAN OR PARTICIPANT TWO 
OH 
OKAY 
UM 
BASICALLY WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS UM COMPONENT DESIGN AND IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT WE MAY BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED USE IT WHAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE OF WHAT OUR MANUFACTURER OFFERS 
SO BASICALLY WHAT I'M GONNA BE DOING IS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THAT 
UM COMPONENTS OF A REMOTE CONTROL OKAY 
WE'VE ALREADY KIND OF GONE OVER THIS BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET INTO MORE DETAIL AND PROBABLY HAVE TO REACH SOME CONCLUSIONS SOME TIME SOON 
ENERGY SOURCE UM OUR MANUFACTURER OFFERS A VARIETY OF ENERGY SOURCES YOUR STANDARD BATTERY SOLAR CELLS 
OUR MANUFACTURER DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LITHIUM SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK IF WE DO GO THAT ROUTE WE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE 
UM AND ALSO THERE'S A KINETIC ENERGY POSSIBILITY 
BASICALLY IT'S LIKE A UM THE IDEA OF MOVING THE REMOTE WOULD CREATE ENOUGH ENERGY TO KEEP IT RUNNING 
SO THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WOULD BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ILLUMINATE A TOUCH SCREEN 
SO WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT 
UM THE CASE WE HAVE A FEW OPTIONS PLASTIC RUBBER OR WOOD 
UM AND THEN AS FAR AS THE WAY IT'S SHAPED WE CAN DO STANDARD BORING FLAT 
WHICH WE PROBABLY DON'T WANNA DO CURVED OR VERY SEXY DOUBLE CURVED 
UM I IMAGINE THAT WE COULD SPECIFY 
UM I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE CONVENTION OF 
THREE OR FOUR MILLIMETRES 
YEAH 
UM THE BUTTONS THERE ARE MULTIPLE SCROLL BUTTONS AVAILABLE FROM OUR MANUFACTURER 
BUT IT IS THIS WE'D HAVE TO USE MORE CHIPS UM AND THAT WOULD COST IS MORE 
AND IF WE DO GO WITH THE RUBBER DOUBLED CURVED CASE UM WE'LL HAVE TO USE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS BECAUSE THE OTHER BUTTONS AREN'T COMPATIBLE WITH THAT 
UM AND JUST A LITTLE NOTE THERE TOUCH SCREEN EQUALS MANY CHIPS WHICH EQUALS MANY EURO 
UM ONE THING THAT I NOTICED WAS THAT MOST REMOTES OPERATE ON A INFRARE ON THE INFRARED PART OF THE SPECTRUM 
SO YOU NOTICE WHEN YOU PUSH A BUTTON ON A REMOTE YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING COMING OUT OF IT BUT IN FACT THERE IS LIGHT COMING OUT OF THE REMOTE AND YOU KNOW THE TELEVISION CAN DETECT THAT 
AND IF YOU WERE TO RECORD IF YOU WERE TO MAKE A VIDEO RECORDING YOU COULD ACTUALLY IS THE LIGHT 
UH ONE THING THAT I THOUGHT MIGHT BE INTERESTING WAS IT AS PART IS VISIBLE LIGHT COMING OUT OF THE REMOTE JUST KIND OF US A FUN GIMMICK 
SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY IS SOMETHING COMING OUT OF THE REMOTE WHEN YOU PUSHED IT 
COURSE IT'D HAVE TO BE A PART OF THE SPECTRUM THAT WOULDN'T DAMAGE THE HUMAN EYE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
I AM SURE THAT WE COULD DO THAT 
UM OF COURSE 
YEAH JUST AS A FUN GIMMICK 
JUST TO SET US APART A LITTLE BIT 
UM AND THEN ON TO THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT WE'RE GONNA USE ALSO KNOWN AS THE CHIP 
UH WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY WAY AROUND THE T. A. ONE ONE EIGHT THREE FIVE 
UM FINDINGS OKAY WE'RE VERY LIMITED BY WHAT OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURERS CAN OFFER 
UM AND MY QUESTION AT ALL OF YOU S SHOULD WE LOOK AT OTHER MANUFACTURIES OR SHOULD WE JUST MAKE DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE 
'S A BIT OF A CHALLENGE QUESTION 
RIGHT THAT'S MY CONCERN TOO 
UM IF WE DO GO THE LITHIUM BATTERY ROUTE THEN WE'LL HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURER 
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS I'LL JUST THROW MY CARDS ON THE TABLE UH I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO THE SOLAR BATTERY ROUTE 
JUST TO KINDA KEEP WITH THE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY THEME THAT WE HAVE GOING ON 
UH I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE VISIBLE LIGHT SIGNALLING 
THAT'S SOMETHING TO SET US APART AND UH I WAS THINKING ABOUT I WAS THINKING OF WAYS THAT WE COULD PRODUCE THE REMOTE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CASE MATERIALS TO SUIT DIFFERENT TASTES 
SO WE'RE NOT SO CONFINED BY ONE STYLE AND SAY SOME YOU KNOW 
SAY OR THE ONE IF WE JUST GO WITH ONE AND IT DOESN'T GO OVER WELL THEN WE'RE IN A BAD SITUATION 
OH YEAH YOU'RE WELCOME 
MM 
MM 
HMM 
I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THIS UM 
SO FAR AS THE RUBBER THAT WE CAN SEE WE CAN USE A RUBBER AS PART OF THE CASE IT HAS A CONSISTENCY OF THOSE STRESS BALLS 
MM 
I LIKE THE IDEA OF OF RUBBER TOO BECAUSE IT'S TENDS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH BEING DURABLE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DROP AND IT DOESN'T MATTER 
'CAUSE AS MANY YOU GO TO USE MANY HOUSES THESE DAYS AND YOU SEE BROKEN REMOTE CONTROLS 
TAPED WITH DUCK TAPE AND WHAT HAVE YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM IF YOU SAID RUBBER 
MM 
NO 
YEAH 
MY ESTIMATE IS THAT IN ORDER TO INCORPORATE TOUCH SCREEN TECHNOLOGY IT'S GONNA COST US UPWARDS OF SEVENTEEN FIFTY EURO PER REMOTE YEAH THAT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE THOUGH 
I KNOW 
IT'S FINE 
I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH THAT 
THAT'S JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IT IS PENDING FURTHER EMAILS 
RIGHT 
IT IS THE NEW IT WOULD BE IN A CLASS OF ITS OWN 
IT'S TRUE 
WE COULD INITIALLY GO WITH WHAT WE HAVE AND IF WE CAN FIND THEM CHEAPER LATER ON 
YEAH 
I THINK IF WE WE DO BOTH THE OBVIOUSLY PRODUCTION COSTS ARE GOING TO GO AWAY UP UM BUT IT DOES PUT IT INTO IT'D BECOME THE ROLLS ROYCE OF REMOTE CONTROLS BASICALLY 
IT WOULD BE VERY NICE 
YEAH 'CAUSE YOU YOU JUST UPPING THE NUMBER OF CHIPS THAT YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH EACH DIFFERENT FUNCTION 
I WOULD HAVE TO SIDE WITH THAT I THINK THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS SIMPLER 
WE ALREADY HAVE THE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY IN HOUSE IT'S READY TO GO IT'S PACKAGED IT'S 
UM THIS IS JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD KEEP IN MIND 
BUT I THINK THE VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD THEY'RE BOTH MM THEY'RE BOTH GONNA PUSH THE COSTS UP 
BUT UM 
SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY IN HOUSE FOR THE VOICE RECOGNITION WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO DO IS MUCH DESIGN WORK AND SOMETIMES THE DESIGN WORK IS WHAT PUSH THE COSTS UP 
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
YEAH 
ARE WE GOING TO TALK NOW BUT UM THE MATERIALS THAT WE'RE GONNA USE FOR THE CASE AND ALL THESE THINGS 
OKAY 
UM THE SOLAR POWER DEFINITELY WOULD BE BUT I THINK JUST TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GETTING ANNOYED 
'CAUSE SOMETIMES SOLAR POWER FAILS AND THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THAT WE SHOULD INSTALL A SMALL BACKUP BATTERY 
JUST TO COVER THOSE MOMENTS WHEN FOR WHATEVER REASON THE REMOTE HASN'T BEEN EXPOSED TO 
IT'S TRUE 
YEAH IT WORKS BUT THE SAME AS A SOLAR POWERED CALCULATOR AND YOU KNOW HOW THIS THIS DON'T REALLY REQUIRE THAT MUCH LIGHT 
UM BUT OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE MORE LIGHT THAN A CALCULATOR BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF LIGHT 
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE OUT TAKING A SUNBATH FOR A FEW HOURS A DAY OR ANYTHING 
HMM 
WHY WHY MOVING AWAY FROM HAND HELD WHY 
WHAT'S THE UH DO 
HMM 
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE THAT ARE PEOPLE THAT BY A REMOTE OR THEY ALWAYS GONNA WANNA USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION OR IS IT JUST SOMETHING THAT THEY DO SOMETIMES 
RIGHT 
I THINK I THINK YOU'RE ON IT SOMETHING BECAUSE WE NEED TO ESCAPE THE TRADITIONAL SHAPE OF A REMOTE 
MAYBE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS NICE IN A TABLE SO WOULD BE GOOD EVEN THOUGH AND HAND HELD THE SAME TIME 
YEAH THESE ARE NICE 
MM 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
JUST KIND OF THE SQUISHY FEEL 
SORRY ABOUT THE UH LACK OF INFORMATION ON COST I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN PROVIDED THAT INFORMATION BY OUR MANUFACTURERS AND I'M JUST HAVING TO GUESS 
RIGHT 
IF 
IF WE'RE NOT GOING THE TOUCH SCREEN ROUTE THEN WE CAN UM JUST INCORPORATE MAYBE SOMETHING THAT FOLDS OUT LIKE WHAT YOU OFTEN SO ON THESE KINDS OF REMOTES SO THE MOST BASIC FUNCTIONS UP HERE AND SOMETHING THAT SLIDES DOWN TO REVEAL THE YOU KNOW MORE COMPLICATED THINGS 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
SO ARE WE GONNA ARE WE TALKING WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF BUTTONS WE'RE GOING TO USE ARE WE GOING TO USE SCROLL BUTTONS 
RUBBER BUTTONS 
UM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
SO HAVE WE DECIDED THAT WE ARE GONNA GO WITH DIFFERENT STYLE CASES FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
OR ARE WE JUST GOING TO GO WITH ONE 
THERE'S AN IDEA 
RIGHT 
AH EXCELLENT YEAH 
THAT SOUNDS GOOD 
MISTER PARTICIPANT TWO THAT IS 
INTERESTING QUESTION 
YES 
DID YOU 
I LIKE IT I LIKE IT 
YES 
FABULOUS 
WE CAN HAVE A DUCK TAPE CASING 
IT COULD GO WITH THE GRANOLA CROWD 
PHEW 
COMPUTER'S ADJUSTING 
ONE MOMENT PLEASE 
SO INTERME INTERFACE CONCEPT BY YOUR FAITHFUL USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
SO YUR USER INTERFACE GUYS SO BASICALLY ASPECTS OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT WE CAN USE OR HERE OR OTHERWISE UH PERCEIVE 
UH COMMANDS AND MECHANISMS THAT BASICALLY USER USES TO CONTROL THE OPERATOR OPERATING SYSTEM 
HERE'S A D SERIES OF DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS THAT OR IT IN THE MARKET TODAY 
I THINK WE'RE DEFINITELY TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THIS KIND OF A LOOK 
UM SO 
THE FOLLOWING ARE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UH INTERFACE UH CONCEPTS 
UH VOICE RECOGNITION WE WE UM ACTUALLY HAVE SOME NEW UH INFORMATION FROM OUR RESEARCH DESIGN TEAM BUT UH I'LL GET OUT THAT IN A MOMENT 
UM SO CURRENT VOICE RECOGNITION STARTS UP TO ABOUT EIGHTY SPEECH SAMPLES 
UM AND BASICALLY YOU RECORD YOUR OWN VERBAL LABELS C AND CONNECT THEM AT THE REMOTE CONTROL 
NOW OUR DESIGN TEAM RESEARCH TEAM 
HAS BEEN ABLE TO UH SET UP A SYSTEM IN WHICH UH YOU CAN TOUCH THE REMOTE CONTROL VOICE C RECOGNITION SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO ME WITH STANDARD RESPONSES 
LIKE YOU COULD SAY GOOD MORNING UH REMOTE CONTROL AND IT'LL SAY IN A SEXY FEMALE VOICE GOOD MORNING JOE 
UM 
IN FACT WE ALREADY HAVE THIS FOR A COFFEE MAKER LINE 
IN THE REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT 
UM ANOTHER CONCEPT IS WHAT UH PEOPLE HAS COME UP WITH 
THE SPINNING WHEEL WITH UH L. C. DISPLAY LIKE IN THE UH IPOD WHICH I AM SURE MOST OF YOU KNOW BUT 
UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE SCROLL BUTTON WITH INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTON KIND OF LIKE A MODERN A BIT BULKY 
A BIT CRAZY I DON'T THINK THAT'S WE'RE NECESSARILY GOING FOR 
AND UH SOME SPECIAL COMPONENTS UH DOES LOOK UH BLOCKING 
HAVING THE ABILITY TO BLOCK CHANNELS FROM YOUR FOR YOUR CHILDREN UM AND UH DEDICATED BUTTONS FOR FOR COMMONLY USED UH CHANNELS AND EVEN UH IDEAS LIKE SECURED OR HIDDEN PROGRAMMING BUT UH I AGAIN IF WE GO WITH TOUCH SCREEN I DON'T THINK THAT'S A BIG ISSUE 
UM 
AND UH THIS IS KIND OF THE UH THE BIG DADDY OF REMOTE CONTROLS HERE 
UH THE JUMBO UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MISPLACE OR ELSE 
UM 
AGAIN PROBABLY NOT WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR US I I MEAN MY IDEAS HERE AND KIND OF WHERE I THINK WE'RE HEADING IS SOMETHING SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN A REGULAR IPOD UH WITH A HARD CLA C UH PLASTIC CASING ALTHOUGH I THINK SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE'VE COME UP WITH OUR DEFINITELY UH VERY GOOD IDEAS 
UH CHANGEABLE CASINGS UH OUR DESIGN TEAM WAS POSSIBLY TALKING ABOUT INCLUDING AN EXTRA FACE PLATE WITH THE PACKAGE TO KIND OF SET THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN CHANGE IT AND YOU CAN TRY CHANGING IT AND KIND OF GET USED TO THINKING ABOUT MAYBE BUYING ANOTHER ONE WHICH CAN ADD VALUE TO OUR UH BOTTOM LINE 
UH TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE UM POSSIBLY HAVING GO TO BUTTONS BEING UH STUCK INTO THE SYSTEM SO THOSE DON'T MOVE AWAY FROM THE SCREEN 
UH THE IMPORTANT ONES LIKE POWER VOLUME AND JUMP BETWEEN CHANNELS 
UM 
AND OF COURSE OUR VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM WHICH I'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ALREADY AND UH THE EASE OF RECOGNISABLE COLOURS AND SHAPES TO DO RECOGNITION OF THE FEATURES UM THAT ARE AROUND SO 
RED FOR POWER UM ARROWS FOR DIFFERENT VOLUME UPS AND DOWNS AND CHANNELS UPS AND DOWNS AND WHAT NOT 
AND UH PERHAPS EVEN ADDING IN SOME STUPID LITTLE JOKES WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION DO LIKE PERH MM FOR INSTANCE MY TOASTIE MAKER THAT I GOT FROM MY BANK 
HAS JOKES WHEN IT'S READY 
AND UH THAT IS ABOUT IT 
UH YOU GUYS ARE ALWAYS THE DAMPERS ON THESE PROJECTS 
YOU INDUSTRIAL DESIGNERS 
WHERE DO YOU GUYS COME UP WITH THESE NUMBERS 
I'M THINKING THAT'S UH DEFINITELY A GOOD IDEA AND I ALSO THINK THAT WE COULD PROBABLY COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF A CHEAPER UH MEANS TO TO GO ABOUT THIS KIND OF PRODUCTION 
MY MY TIME IN THE UH IN THE THIRD FLOOR SUGGESTED THAT UH 
YEAH 
I MEAN I THINK THAT WE REALLY HAVE TWO MAIN SELLING POINTS I THINK THAT OUR CASING AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
TO BE HONEST WE HAVE THE CAPA WE HAVE THE DESIGN IN HOUSE 
I MEAN WE'VE WE'VE COME UP WITH THIS WITH THIS NEW VOICE WE'RE USING IT FOR OUR COFFEE MACHINES ALREADY 
I CAN PASS YOU IN THAT EMAIL FROM MY UH GUY IN UH GUY DOWN THE HALL 
SOUNDS GOOD 
I MEAN WE WE HAVE TO R REFLECT BACK ON WHAT OUR MARKET RESEARCH DID SAY 
DOES HAVING BOTH REALLY UP OUR COSTS 
WELL MY UP SO 
UM I DEFINITELY HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT LAST COMMENT 
IT'S YOU NEED ME OUTSIDE A LITTLE HERE 
CALCULATOR 
I'M WILLING TO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN USED 
UH I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH THAT UM ANOTHER IDEA'S COME UP IN MY HEAD 
IF WE'RE REALLY NOT UH HANDLING THE REMOTE CONTROL TO A GREAT EXTENT WE COULD POSSIBLY GET AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF HAVING A HAND HELD REMOTE CONTROL AND MAYBE KIND OF HAVE A ROUND REMOTE CONTROL THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A PAPERWEIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
KIND OF A SLEEK LITTLE UH NOT THING THAT SITS IN YOUR TABLE OR SOMETHING 
JUST A THOUGHT 
WELL IF YOU DON'T NEED TO PICK IT UP IT COULD KIND OF BE A SELLING POINT 
I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT FOLLOWING APPLE'S LEAD ON A LOT OF THESE THINGS 
MM-HMM 
EXACTLY 
THINK THEN WE'RE HITTING OUR COST ISSUE AGAIN 
I THINK IT A CERTAIN EXTENT WE HAVE TO STICK WITH UH KIND OF UH A LITTLE BIT TRADITIONAL IN TERMS OF THE BUTTONS AND THEN AND THEN MAKE OUR UNIQUE FEATURE OUR CASING AND WHAT NOT AND OUR VOICE COMMAND 
WELL WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY DOING 
WHAT WERE 
SURE 
AND AGAIN COPYING IMAC'S KIND OF FOR IPOD MAC APPLE'S UH COLOUR SCHEME 
FABULOUS 
OKAY 
UH I TOTALLY 
YEAH 'CAUSE I MOVED IT 
'S PUT IT OVER HERE 
THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT 
HUH 
YEAH THAT'S NOT YOU 
OH 
FAIR ENOUGH 
MM 
RIGHT 
APPROPRIATE OKAY 
MM 'KAY 
IT IS AN OPTION 
OH 
I SEE 
NICE 
DO WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT UM ROT FACTORS 
OH OKAY THERE'S PRESERVATIVES INVOLVED WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY OKAY 
FAIR ENOUGH 
NO BUT 
IT'S A COUPLE YEARS OFF AT LEAST 
OKAY 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 'KAY 
RIGHT 
DO WE HAVE UM THERE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD SKINS 
COVERS 
NO PLAY NOW OR OR THESE ONES GONNA BE DEVELOPED LATER ONCE WE SEE HOW THE COUPLE WE HAVE G GO OR 
DO WE KNOW WHERE WE STAND ON THAT YET 
UH I WASN'T EXPECTING A PROTOTYPE I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAD ANY IN MIND YET 
OKAY 
JUST VENEER REALLY YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
AND THE WHOLE THING 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
THERE'S 
OKAY 
MM 'KAY 
OKAY VERY COOL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEP 
IT'S STILL AN OPTION IF WE NEED TO 
VERY COOL NICE JOB 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM COME ON TO SIXTEEN 
YEAH 
MM K 
TRUE 
NAH 
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T WANNA GET RID OF THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENTAL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE SOLAR CELL IS A BIG PIECE OF THE WAY WE'RE MARKETING THIS IS LIKE A NATURAL 
NEW THING BUT HONESTLY IF WE CUT THAT ONE PIECE OUT WE'RE ACTUALLY COMING IN UNDER BUDGET IF I'VE DONE MY MATH CORRECTLY 
I MEAN 
WHICH IT'S YEAH THAT'S WHAT SETTING US INTO THIS YOUNG MARKET I MEAN THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED FROM US 
I DON'T KNOW 
AND I MEAN YOU KNOW PERHAPS WHEN THE CELL TECHNOLOGY COMES DOWN IN PRICE WE CAN BRING THAT BACK INTO THE GAME BUT IT LOOKS LIKE TO THIS POINT THAT MAY BE OUT OF OUR LOGO 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S OUR BEST OPTION 
MM 
IT KIND OF YEAH 
MM MM 
YEAH 
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE ARE 
THAT WOULD BE UM 
UM CARD 
NO PROBLEM 
CAN YOU REACH THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU 
I DIDN'T EVEN DO THAT ONE ON PURPOSE EITHER DAMN 
OKAY UM 
BASICALLY I WAS JUST EVALUATING UM FROM WHAT WE KNOW OF HOW OUR PRODUCT'S WORKING RIGHT NOW WITH THE CRITERIA THAT WE SIT AT THE BEGINNING OF THESE ARE THE THINGS WE NEEDED TO DO 
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT LIKE LIKE WE FEEL THEY'RE IMPORTANT 
UM SO I WAS LOOKING AT BASIC DESIGN THINGS DOES IT FULFIL ITS FUNCTIONS AS A REMOTE 
SO THE DESIGN WHAT WE WANTED TO TO DO 
I ARE TECHNOLOGIES UP TO WHERE WE HOPED THEY WOULD BE AND DOES IT FULFIL THE AESTHETIC QUALITIES THAT OUR ORIGINAL MARKET RESEARCH WAS LOOKING FOR 
UM 
BASIC QUESTIONS LIKE YOU KNOW DOES IT TURN ON 
DOES IT RESPOND TO VOICE RECOGNITION 
AND OVERALL IN GENERAL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COMING UP TO PRO 
UM THE ONLY THING IS WITH WITH THE PULL OUT PANEL THAT IS CAN TO TAKE SOME ADJUSTING BECAUSE IT'S A NEW SORT OF INTERFACE 
UM THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS COMING UP ROUGH BUT THEN ONCE YOU GET USED TO TO IT DOES MAKE A LOT OF SENSE 
SO I THINK OVERALL WE'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
SO 
YEAH 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING OVER WELL SO 
WE'RE WE'RE GOOD YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S I THINK EVENTUALLY IF WE DO UM BRANCH OUT WITH THIS PRODUCT MAYBE WE DO HAVE A HIGHER BUDGET OPTIONS AND IF IT GOES OVER WITH THIS MODEL WE CAN LOOK INTO UM WIDER RANGE VOICE RECOGNITION LIKE FROM OTHER ROOMS OF THE HOUSE AND STUFF 
BUT FOR NOW WHAT WE'VE GOT IS WORKING ON THE RANGE WE NEED TO FOR US IT'S ALL GOOD 
THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM UM 
YEAH 
YEAH IT IS A SET BACK BUT 
OKAY DO YOU NEED THE CORD BACK 
SO IN WITHIN THE TIME OR 
OKAY 
IT IS NOW YOU'RE IN CHARGE SO THERE YOU GO 
WHATEVER 
UM 
I THINK THEY'RE STARTING BLOCKS YEAH 
UM YOU KNOW I THINK IN GENERAL FOR A DAY'S WORTH OF WORK WE ACTUALLY WERE RELATIVELY PRODUCTIVE 
CONSIDERING THE LITTLE AMOUNT OF INPUT WE HAD GOING ON 
UM AND THE TECHNOLOGY HAS DEFINITELY BEEN A HELP IT'S REALLY BEEN INTERESTING TO TRY TO ALL THOSE NEW STUFF 
NO WE DIDN'T 
WE COULD NOW IF THAT'D MAKE UP FOR IT BUT REALLY AND I FEEL LIKE IF YOU GUYS HAD BEEN DESIGNING IN HERE PERHAPS THAT WOULD HAVE CHANGED BUT BECAUSE OF ROOM CONSTRAINTS 
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
YEAH I THINK I WAS TAKING NOTES MORE OFTEN THAN USUAL JUST 'CAUSE I LIKED THE PEN YEAH 
MM 
I AM DISAPPOINTED I DIDN'T GET A NOTE BACK FROM MY PERSONAL COACH 
YEAH BUT I DIDN'T GET A RESPONSE SO WE'LL SEE 
OKAY THAT WOULD BE KINDA CREEPY 
WELL WHAT KIND OF COACHING IS THAT REALLY 
WHAT IF I REALLY NEEDED SOMETHING 
I THINK SO 
AND EVEN THEN WE DID GET A DECENT PRODUCT TURNED OUT ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT EVERYTHING WE WANTED TO TO BE 
ORGANIC REALLY 
AND HIGHLY RESOURCEFUL TEAM MATES MIGHT I DID WHICH IS ALWAYS A PLUS 
MM YEAH I'M IMPRESSED 
NICE 
ALL FOUR OF THESE LITTLE CONTAINERS 
YEAH 
YOU COULD HAVE DEVELOPED MULTIPLE SKINS REALLY HAD YOU HAD MORE COLOURS 
UH WELL 
THEY WERE GOOD 
YEAH 
TRUE 
DO YOUR OWN 
THOUGH I DID FEEL LIKE THE THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION DROPPED OFF SEVERELY OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY 
I MEAN MAYBE IT'S JUST UM BUT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY GET ANY INFORMATION FOR THE LAST PRESENTATION AT ALL 
NOTHING I DIDN'T EVEN GOT AN EMAIL LIKE THAT WAS IT 
SO YEAH I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS SLIGHTLY LACKING BUT THEN YOU KNOW FILL IN THE BLINKS IN YOUR OWN LEVEL OF CREATIVITY UPPED 
WHATEVER 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH THAT WASN'T VERY MUCH 
MM 
YES 
HMM VERY MUCH SO 
YEAH ALREADY HAVING THE FORMATTED STUFF HELPED A LOT 
VERY MUCH SO 
HMM 
YEAH 
THAT'S KIND OF A GOOD THING THOUGH YOU KNOW GIVE THE REST OF US SOME STRUCTURE TO WORK WITH SO HEY 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE MOMENTS WHERE IT JUST GET OUT OF HAND AND I KNOW WE WERE ALL LYING THROUGH OUR TEETH OTHER THAN THAT 
I COULD ONLY IMAGINE 
YEAH 
TOTALLY 
I THINK SO 
THOUGH WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY I MEAN OTHER THAN MINOR DISCUSSION AT MEETINGS THERE WASN'T EXCEPT FOR THE ACTUAL BUILDING 
BUT I FEEL LIKE IF THIS WAS A TEAM PROJECT THERE ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE OF THE COLLABORATIVE LIKE BRAINSTORMING 
SO THE BOARD WELL AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN SIX MONTHS' WORTH OF WORK INTO LIKE THREE HOURS' WORTH OF MEETINGS 
THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH THAT IS KIND OF 
MINE WAS THE MICS 
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE GETTING UP AND DOWN AND DEALING WITH ALL THESE WIRES I WAS AFRAID I WAS GONNA BREAK SOMETHING ACTUALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TRUE BUT IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO ME AS AN OPTION I MEAN I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD HAVE BUT I KNOW THAT I CONSCIOUSLY DIDN'T 
TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL IT LOOKS REALLY PROFESSIONAL 
I KNOW 
I KNOW I FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO BE PROFESSIONAL SO I DIDN'T LIKE DRAW ALL OVER MY PAPER AND STUFF 
OKAY WELL NOT ENTIRELY BUT STILL I DOODLED LESS THAN I USUALLY DO 
I GUESS 
UM 
IT DID IT JUST SAY IN AN EMAIL THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS THAT 
THAT SLIDE WAS LIKE THAT 
WELL 
UH I THINK THEY STILL DO THEIR JOB 
I AM THINKING OUTSIDE THE LITTLE SQUARE BOX THOUGH WITH LITERALLY IN LIKE FROM I DON'T 
YEAH 
IT'S STILL GOTTA BE TECHNICALLY CAR SHAPED OR IT WON'T FIT IN THE ROAD YOU KNOW 
DON'T KNOW 
KIND OF 
UH HOW LONG WAS OUR MEETING SUPPOSED TO BE 
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE LEFT 
MM 
YEAH 
AT THE BEGINNING IT STARTED OUT AND I FELT ACTUALLY LIKE UNDER PRESSURE LIKE THE FIRST COUPLE WERE TAKING A LOT OF WORK AND I WAS LIKE HAD LIKE ALL THIS BRAINSTORMING I WAS DOING AND THEN SUDDENLY I WAS LIKE WELL IT'S JUST ANOTHER TWO MINUTE PRESENTATION THAT YOU GUYS DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT ANYWAY SO TYPE AWAY 
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE WE ALL SORT OF KNEW WHERE WE WERE HEADED WITH IT IS IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT MATTERED ANYMORE 
MM-HMM 
WHATEVER 
YEAH 
VERY MUCH YEAH 
SO I ONLY GOT BLANK ONES 
MY SLIDES WERE ALL BLANK THEY'D HAVE A TITLE MAYBE AND THEY WERE JUST EMPTY 
LIKE WITH THOSE WORDS ALREADY ON IT 
NO 
I WONDERED WHY YOURS ALWAYS LOOKED IS MORE COMPLICATED 
I THINK I ADDED A SLIDE IN TIME 
HEY WITH THE WHOLE NEW BACKGROUND BEING INNOVATIVE YEAH THAT WAS CLASS 
MM 
I WANNA KNOW HOW OUR PRODUCT WOULD FOR 
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE OUT THERE 
I THINK IT WOULD TAKE EXTENSIVE MARKETING OKAY AN APPLE WITH A RED BUTTON ON TOP EVEN I AM SCEPTICAL 
BUT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE 
YEAH 
I KNOW IT IS 
MM 
I I NOTICED THAT 
BY ACCIDENT 
WELL HUH 
AN INTERESTING DAY ALL IN ALL I WOULD SAY 
I KNOW 
YEAH 
'CAUSE IT'S SUCH A FUNCTIONAL ITEM 
MM 
MM 
WE GET TO TO BE 
LIKE CUTTING CORNERS 
KIND OF THOUGH IT WAS REALLY TECHNICALLY AN EVALUATION OF THE PRODUCT INTO THE PROJECT IN GENERAL 
WHICH I'M NOT SURE IS THE SAME THING AT THE TIME THAT JUST I MADE MORE SENSE BUT I COULD SEE IF THEY WERE REALLY ASKING ABOUT IS 
YAY 
MAKE IT SOUND ELOQUENT 
OH 
I HAVE TO DONE I'VE I'VE DONE TRANSCRIPTION BEFORE AND IT'S REALLY RIDICULOUS HOW MANY WORDS PEOPLE SAY LIKE JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR SENTENCES LIKE THAT THAT MEAN NOTHING 
THERE'S A GUY STUDYING IT HERE YEAH HE'S STUDYING UMS AND AHS OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
THAT'S A GOOD WORD FOR IT 
JUST ADD SOME PREFIXES SOUNDS CLASSIER 
I YEAH PRETTY COMPULSIVELY DURING MEETINGS LIKE YEAH 
YEAH WE ARE ADDICTS 
MM 
YEAH 
I YEAH 
TRUE 
I YEAH 
BUT IT'S NOT REGULAR I MEAN MY GRANDPARENTS HAD IT IN THE EIGHTIES AND I GET IT IN NINETY FRA BUT STILL 
UH-HUH 
MY UM GRAMMY DOES COMPUTER SCIENCE BACK IN THE STATES AND SO THEY HAD UM AN I. D. A. AND GOV NETWORK 
THERE'S BASICALLY THE FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURES BUT IT WASN'T UH HOUSEHOLD TO HOUSEHOLD YET BECAUSE IT HADN'T BEEN 
PARTITIONED OFF AND STUFF YEAH THAT WAS HIM 
APPARENTLY DOES THAT INCLUDE LIKE CHAMPAGNE OR SOMETHING EXCITING 
I THINK SO 
I THINK THAT'S A CLOSER 
I HAVE AN IDEA 
SO SO THAT A CLOSE 
OKAY THAT'S THE END OF THE MEETING 
THANK YOU GENTLEMEN 
I FEEL LIKE I'M SIGNING OFF 
ALL SET 
COOL 
ALRIGHT TO USE POWERPOINT TIME 
I'VE DONE MORE POWERPOINTS IN THIS PARTICULAR EXPERIMENT THAN I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE BEFORE THIS EXPERIMENT WHICH IS KIND OF FUN 
SO UH HERE WE HAVE OUR DETAILED DESIGN MEETING WHERE WE WILL UM LOOK AT THE PROTOTYPE AND UM RIGHT SO UM 
I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT THIS WHOLE SECOND BULLET POINT IS BUT IN MY THAT MY COACH WAS SENDING TO ME 
IT MEANS I'M SUPPOSED TO READ THE MINUTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
I THINK 
I DON'T KNOW 
OTHERWISE IT'S JUST SAYING I'M THE SECRETARY AND I'M THEREFORE I'M TAKING THE MINUTES 
SO SO JUST TO GO UM JUST REAL BRIEFLY TO GO OVER MINUTES FROM LAST MEETING 
UH I WILL OPEN THEM SLOWLY NO 
WAIT FOR TO WAIT FOR IT 
NO 
THAT'S HOW THE 
WAIT 
THIS IS THIS IS VERY HIGH POWERED STUFF HERE DOUBLE CLICKING THERE WE GO 
SO UM BASICALLY THE MORAL OF THE STORY FROM OUR LAST MINUTE UH LAST MEETING WAS THAT UM WE THAT WE HAD MEETINGS FROM UH WE HAD PRESENTATIONS DONE BY THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
UH OR FROM NATHAN AND RUN AND FROM SARAH ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO HERE UM AND WHAT 
SORT OF LIMITATIONS WE'RE OPERATING WITH UM UH EXCUSE ME WHAT LIMITATIONS WE'RE OPERATING UNDER 
WHAT KIND OF RISK WE'D BE LOOKING AT WITH SOME OF THE VARIOUS APPROACHES WE WERE DISCUSSING AND WE ESSENTIALLY CAME OUT THE CONCLUSION THAT WE SHOULD DEVELOP A REMOTE WITH UH VOICE RECOGNITION 
U. I. THAT HAD A VAGUELY NON REMOTE LIKE SHAPE UM BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO USE IT IS A REMOTE SINCE YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR VOICE 
THAT WOULD INCLUDE SOME MOSTLY JUST THE SIMPLE DESIGN FEATURES FOR A TELEVISION OPERATION BUT WITH A SLIDE OR A FOLD IT BY FAR MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS FOR USERS 
UM AND UH THE UH UH THE U. I. D. AND THE I. D. WERE ASKED TO GO AHEAD AND START DEVELOPING A PROTOTYPE FOR US TO LOOK AT 
SO 
THAT'S SORTED BACK TO THE MENU 
MEET HERE UM GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT AWAY GUYS 
MM-HMM 
NICE 
PERFECT 
OH RIGHT 
UH WELL DONE YEAH YEAH OH OK 
EDIBLE TELEVISIONS IT'S A WAVE OF THE FUTURE 
BRILLIANT 
BRILLIANT 
COOL 
NO NO I THINK THAT'S 
RIGHT YEAH THANKS GUYS THAT'S VERY VERY GOOD WORK 
I LIKE IT BRILLIANT 
UM WHAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS NOW IS THE FINANCE OF IT UM I GOT UM YOU'VE GOT YOU PROVIDED A NUMBER THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS QUITE NICE 
UM THE TROUBLE IS I WAS JUST GIVEN THIS BY FINANCE 
UM IT'S A SPREADSHEET OF THE PARTS AND I'VE JUST TENTATIVELY PUT ON WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE UM 
I'M JUST GONNA CLEAR THIS OUT REAL QUICKLY BUT IT LOOKS LIKE 
SO WE'LL JUST IF WE CAN JUST ITEMIZE WHAT'S ON HERE WE'VE GOT THIS IT'S A SOLAR CELL THING RIGHT 
WITH A BACK UP BATTERY 
WITH THE B OKAY 
UM AND 
CLEVER CLEVER WELL DONE 
UM SO I GUESS THAT WOULD MEAN WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A UM 
IT'S A AS A SPEAKER AND A SENSOR AT THE SAME TIME ISN'T IT 
OKAY 
UM AND THE CASE IT'S MORE OF A SINGLE CURVED CASE I GUESS WOULD BE THAT BE THE GENERAL 
UM AND WE'VE GOT A RUBBER SKIN MATERIAL BASICALLY THROUGHOUT 
UM 
PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE 
UM WITH THESE OTHER DROP DOWN SO MAYBE WE'VE GOT TWO PUSH BUTTON INTERFACES DON'T WE 
UM 
AND UM A SPECIAL 
I GUESS IT'S UH WE'VE GOT A SORT OF A WOOD MATERI A RUBBERY TYPE MATERIAL THAT THROUGHOUT YEAH 
YEAH IT'S IT'S QUITE UNIQUE 
I LIKE IT YEAH IT'S 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE 
A BIT OVER BUDGET UM 
SO WHAT WE COULD DO PERHAPS A SIMPLE FIX WOULD MAYBE TO SWITCH AWAY FROM THE SOLAR CELLS 
UM OR TAKE OUT THE BACK UP BATTERY 
OH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
WHAT'S DIFFICULT WE HAVE ALL THESE THINGS INTEGRAL TO THE AIM AT THE DESIGN OF IT THAT WE JUST CAN'T BACK TO F NOW 
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SEEMS LIKE WE'D HAVE TO GO BACK TO 
SQUARE ONE 
IN A WAY 
UM IF WE WERE GONNA TRY OUT AND NO BUT WE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO UNDO MOST OF IT UM 
IT'S THERE ARE 
'CAUSE WE CAN'T REMOVE THE PUSH BUTTONS 'CAUSE THEY'RE UM AND WE CAN'T GET RID OF THE UH I MEAN REMOVING THE CHANGING THE CASE WOULDN'T BE AS MUCH OF A 
MM MM UM NOR WOULD CHANGING THE CASE MATERIALS 
UM 
SO YEAH THAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE THE ONLY THING 
SO THAT WOULD BE THE IT'S A MAJOR CHANGE BUT 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT SO WE'RE IN AGREEMENT ON THAT 
RIGHT 
MOVING ALONG SWIFTLY 
UM SO I GUESS NOW WE JUST GO TO THE PROJECT EVALUATION 
WHICH I WILL ALLOW SARAH TO TAKE OVER 
UH OF COURSE SORRY 
WHOOSH 
THAT'D BE GREAT 
BRILLIANT 
HMM 
UM YEAH I WAS JUST GO ON 
WELL THEY DON'T OWN TELLYS ANYWAY DO THEY 
RIGHT 
SO UM THIS ONE'S A BIT UNCLEAR TO ME TO BE PERFECTLY FAIR UM 
I GOT THIS SLIDE FROM THE COUCH AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CONNECTED TO 
UM SO I GUESS WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS UM OUR PROJECT PROCESS UM AND THAT IS GONNA GO INTO MY REPORT 
SO I GUESS THIS IS THE POINT WHERE WE GO UM UH OUT OF ROLE IT LOOKS LIKE AND TALK ABOUT OUR SATISFACTION FOR ROOM FOR CREATIVITY AND SO FORTH AND HOW THAT ALL WORKED 
I GUESS UM 
I THINK SO YEAH 
I THINK IT'S 
I MM-HMM I THINK SO 
I THINK HOPE I'M NOT SCREWING UP AN EXPERIMENT 
BUT I TRUST THAT SHE WOULD JUMP IN IF I WAS IS OKAY FAIR ENOUGH 
UM RIGHT UM SO ANY THOUGHTS 
YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU GUYS FEEL ABOUT THE PROCESS 
MM-HMM 
NO NO WHITEBOARD 
WAS PRETTY COOL TACK THOUGH 
ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT COACH INEFFECTIVE 
VERY NATURAL LOOK 
THAT'S THE BRILLIANCE OF THEY HAD A P THEY HAD A PEELER IN HERE 
YEAH I THINK YEAH OR I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE REALLY CREATIVE ACTUALLY I MEAN 
INCLUDING THE USE THE MULTI COLOURED WAVE PATTERN 
WHAT DID YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THE THE THE ROLES 
THAT'S TRUE I I GOT THIS SPREADSHEET 
OF WHAT TO DO 
MM MM 
COOL 
SHE SAID I I I SH ACTUALLY MADE A COMMENT OFF BOY YOU'RE GETTING INTO THIS AND I REALLY I THINK IT'S TRUE I DID GET I I FELT LIKE I GET AWAY IT INTO IT 
I FELT LIKE I SLIPPED INTO IT A LOT 
I DUNNO 
THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE YEAH PROJECT PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
I USUALLY ORGANISE CRAP IT'S ONE THING TO DO YOU KNOW SET UP A PARTY WITH YOUR FRIENDS YOU KNOW 
BUT YOU GUYS FELT THAT YOU COULD KEEP THE YEAH SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF KIND OF LIKE LIKE THE ROLE AND THE OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
MAYBE IN IN LEGOS YOU KNOW 
BE FINE WITH LEGOS TOO LIKE MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL OR SPACESHIP 
WE USED TO HAVE SPACESHIP LEGOS DID YOU GUYS EVER USED TO BUILD SPACESHIPS WITH LEGOS EVERYBODY KNOWS BEST SPACESHIPS EVER 
UM YOU GUYS FELT LIKE THERE WAS ENOUGH TEAMWORK IN ALL 
HMM 
NO I NO I DUNNO I D I I DUNNO I DON'T I I WAS JUST I 
IT'S TRUE HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
COURSE I'M I'M CONSCIOUS OF THE IDEA OF THE PROJECT MANAGER ASKING IF YOU GUYS FEEL LIKE THERE'S A TIME YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE 
KIND OF LIKE LIKE HMM 
TO DO 
BUT YEAH 
INTERESTING 
IT'S KIND OF FASCINATING WASN'T IT 
I MEAN THE WHOLE PROCESS OF 
I DON'T KNOW 
I I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A R I TH 
MM 
NOR I 
I WANNA USE THE OUTPUT FILES FROM THIS UM FROM THE DIGITAL PAPER 
I WANNA SEE WH WH WHAT MY MY HANDWRITING LOOKS LIKE DIGITIZED BECAUSE MY HANDWRITING IS CRAP 
I MEAN JUST TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN P. D. F. FORMAT OR SOMETHING 
IT I I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT THE DE BRIEFING IS GONNA BE LIKE 
YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT IS THE UH 
WHAT EXACTLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE 
I DUNNO I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE NEW IDEAS FOUND I SEE BUT 
WELL THAT'S THE THING I GOT I IN THE EMAIL I GOT THIS POWERPOINT FILE BUT THIS SLIDE WAS JUST THERE MM-HMM 
I DIDN'T CHANGE THIS ONE AT ALL 
UM EACH 
YEAH WELL 
W I KINDA LIKE THE 
YEAH YOU CAN'T 
YEAH 
DOES KINDA MAKE YOU WONDER I MEAN HOW MUCH CAN YOU DO WITH A REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S LIKE INVENTING A NEW CAR 
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN 
YEAH 
HMM 
UM 
'KAY 
SO THIS WAS OTHER COSTS 
I DUNNO 
I THINK THIS IS 
FORTY ISH I I I MM WE SHOULD GO ON A BIT YEAH BUT THE PROJECT EVAL UM 
I DUNNO BUT YOU GUYS BUT I FELT LIKE 
A BIT 
UNDER STIMULATED ON THE WHOLE THING 
LIKE WHAT LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT AM I REALLY DOING YOU KNOW WHAT IS 
YEP 
HEY 
MM 
I ACTUALLY DIDN'T DO THAT AT ALL THOUGH EVERY SINGLE ONE I A ALL THE PRESENTATIONS I EITHER ADDED SLIDES OR EDITED 'EM 
I D 
OH 
WHAT 
REALLY 
DID THEY NOT HAVE THEY DIDN'T LIKE UH MINE YEAH THEY DIDN'T COME LIKE THIS 
LIKE WITH THIS WAS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
THIS IS WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE LITERALLY JUST LIKE THAT 
INTERESTING 
UH-HUH HUH-HUH 
INTERESTING 
ANY OTHER THOUGHTS COME TO MIND 
YEAH BUT 
BUILDS 
MM 
INTERESTING 
OH YEAH I'D SAY SO 
MM I KNOW 
IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYTHING FLOWED PRETTY LOGICALLY 
YOU KNOW FROM THE THE THE BASICS TO THE CONCE ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE CONCEPTS THING THE WHOLE CONCEPTS PHASE I DON'T THINK I REALLY UNDERSTOOD LIKE THE CONCEPT 
WELL THE IDEA OKAY THE NOTION OF YEAH I MEAN I IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE A CONCEPT OF A MUG'S MATERIAL IT'S JUST TO SEE WHAT IT IS 
YOU KNOW 
MAYBE I RATHER THAN CONCEPTS I IT SHOULD BE THE THOUGHT IF WE SH I I THOUGHT OF I THOUGHT OF RATHER THAN IN TERMS OF CONCEPTS I THOUGHT OF IT IN TERMS OF UM LIKE 
PROPOSED IDEA 
AND THEN THE FINAL WOULD BE LIKE THE THE ACTUAL SPECIFIED PROTOTYPE OR WHATEVER I DUNNO 
BUT 
ALL IN ALL IT'S KINDA INTERESTING 
NO JUST THIS CLOSING ONE 
NO WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT THE COSTS WEREN'T REALLY WITHIN BUDGET BUT WE COULD SEE YOU KNOW DO IT 
WE DID THE PROJECT EVALUATION BASED ON UM SARAH'S EVALUATION OF ON OFF SWITCHES AND 
MM 
TRUE 
YEAH 
'CAUSE WE DO WE HAD A THU THINK ABOUT IT 
UM 
YEAH 
AND IT'S ALL RECORDED WOO HOO 
YEAH WHAT I'M GONNA I'M GONNA PUT UM I'M SUPPOSED TO DO THIS FINAL REPORT THING AT THE END SO I'LL PUT ALL THAT INTO THE FINAL REPORT AS WELL 
OR SO MUCH AS SEEMS LIKE MAYBE NOT LIKE THE ARTICLES AND STUFF 
LIKE BECAUSE AND IF AND SO FORTH BUT I'LL PUT MOST OF IT IN THE REPORTS 
NICE 
OH YEAH 
THERE'S A WHOLE BRANCH OF PSYCHOLOGY THAT LOOKS INTO THAT PSYCHOLINGUISTICS 
YEP THEY'RE CALLED UM DISFLUENCIES 
YEAH WE LIKE OUR FANCY PHRASES AND TERMINOLOGIES FOR THINGS 
EXACTLY UH I WILL SAVE THIS INTO THE 
PROJECT DOCUMENTS 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
YEAH I KNOW 
COME ON GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION 
WELL TO BE FAIR WE'RE WE'RE HOOKED WE'RE ALL HOOKED ON THE INTERNET SO I MEAN I DO THE 
I KNOW IMAGINE WE WANT THE FIRST TEN Y FIFTEEN YEARS OF OUR LIVES WITHOUT THE INTERNET 
IT'S ONLY IN THE LAST TEN THAT WE'RE LIKE WHERE'S THE INTERNET 
I MEAN YOU KNOW IT JUST IN THE PAST FIVE WE'VE GONE FROM TWENTY EIGHT EIGHT MODEMS TO BROADBAND ALL THE TIME 
NO WE HAVE BUT I NOT IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S IS NO YOU KNOW UH UBIQUITOUS 
MM 
YEAH THAT'S OUR LAST STEP 
CELEBRATION 
'KAY I GUESS WE CAN PROBABLY CALL THAT MEETING AT ONE AND FOR THE MOST PART 
COOL 
WHERE DO YOU FIND THAT 
SO THIS ONE OF THOSE MEDIA PLAYER 
WE UH 
THE DEFAULT TRACK 
I THOUGHT IT WAS DAVID BURNS LOOK INTO THE EYEBALL 
THAT'S ONE THAT SEEMS TO BE SHIPPING WITH IT UH SHIPPED WITH FOR A WHILE MAYBE THIS IS THE NEW VERSION 
YEAH I GUESS WE'LL CALL THAT A A DONER 
FAB 
YEAH 
OH REALLY 
OKAY 
WELL 
UH WE HAVE ASSEMBLED OUR PROTOTYPE UM 
WHAT'S IT BE USED BUT IT 
UM WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE WENT OVER IN THE LAST MEETING UM 
SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO CONSIDER ARE THAT WE DECIDED NOT TO GO FOR THE TOUCH SCREEN WHICH YOU CAN USE AND OPTED FOR SOME VERY LARGE BUTTONS FOR THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS 
UM 
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE ON OFF BUTTON AND WE HAVE THESE BUTTONS TO GO THROUGH THE CHANNELS UM AND THEN TWO VOLUME BUTTONS DOWN HERE 
DO UH WE DECIDED THOSE WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT UH BUTTONS 
AND THEN FOR THE MORE ADVANCED UH FUNCTIONS THERE IS A SLIDE OUT PANEL HERE UM AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS GOING ON 
BUT THIS ACTUALLY CAN SLIDE BACK IN AND PROVIDES A VERY NICE AESTHETIC WHEN IT'S ALL PUT AWAY UM 
SO FAR AS THE UH WHOLE VISIBLE LIGHT THING WE DECIDED TO GO WITH THE MULTIPLE COLOURS COMING OUT WHY NOT 
OF COURSE IF THAT'S ANNOYING FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT FUNCTION CAN BE TURNED OFF 
UM 
GO AHEAD 
THAT'S THIS HERE 
UM I WORRIED ABOUT THE MATERIALS IT IS UH THE ENTIRE THING IS COVERED IN A RUBBER COATING SO IT'S VERY DURABLE UH 
IT'S NOT GONNA BREAK LIKE SOME TYPES OF PLASTIC THAT'S DROPPED 
UM AND OF COURSE AS YOU CAN USE AND IF YOU TOUCH IT IT DOES HAVE THAT NICE SQUISHY FEEL 
FACT I DUNNO IF YOU NOTICED BUT I WROTE THE UH THE COMPANY'S NAME IN THE TELEPHONE SCREEN I THOUGHT THAT WAS KINDA NICE 
THIS WAS ACTUALLY AN APPLE ON THE INSIDE 
THIS 
YEAH 
WE GOT A BIT AHEAD OF OURSELVES I KNOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MAKING TELEVISIONS AT THIS POINT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT 
RIGHT 
UH WE DID YEAH 
THIS COST WILL TO PUT THIS INTO UM PRODUCTION WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT WHAT WAS OUR GOAL 
IT WAS TWELVE FIFTY EURO UM AND THIS ACTUALLY COME ON IT ABOUT ELEVEN NINETY NINE 
UM SO I WAS QUITE PLEASED WITH THAT 
ONE THING THAT WE DIDN'T DO UM OBVIOUSLY WE HAD A CHOICE WITH THE BUTTONS WHETHER TO USE SCROLL BUTTONS ARE STANDARD RUBBER BUTTONS 
BUT WE JUST WENT FOR A CLASSIC RUBBER BUTTON AND UM SINCE WE DID THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO USE AS MANY MICROCHIPS WHICH WAS QUITE NICE AND THAT'S WHAT HELPED KEEP THE COST DOWN 
SO EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A LOT OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY UM FOR EXAMPLE THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
IN A LOT OF WAYS IT'S JUST A SIMPLE REMOTE AND UM I THINK IF WE SHOPPED AROUND FOR OTHER MANUFACTURERS UM WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET EVEN CHEAPER 
AND 
OH NO WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THAT YET HAVE WE 
HMM 
YEAH 
ANY QUESTIONS 
UM DO YOU WANNA ANSWER THIS ONE OR DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER TO 
YEAH YEAH 
UM WELL AS YOU CAN USE THIS IS JUST A MOST SUPERFICIAL LAYER AND UM IT'D BE VERY EASY TO PUT ANOTHER LAYER OF SOMETHING ELSE LIKE 
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT QUITE A A FACE PLATE 
IT'S MORE LIKE A PSEUDO FACE PLATE BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH THAT IN THE FACTORY IT COULD WE COULD VERY EASILY PUT A DIFFERENT NO NO IT 
IT LOCKS INTO PLACE SUCH THAT YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY PERMANENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
IF WE WANNA GO THE OTHER WAY IT'S JUST A MATTER OF A COUPLE OF ADJUSTMENTS AND WE COULD GO THE FACE PLATE WAY OF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
YEAH 
OH 
OH 
RIGHT UH WE DIDN'T REALLY TOUCH ON THAT BUT IT IT'S IN THERE YEP 
YEAH YEAH 
IT'S JUST MAKING USE OF THE SAME SPACE AND THE SAME MATERIALS BUT 
YEAH ONE BIG CURVE I GUESS YOU COULD SAY 
YEAH MM-HMM 
YEAH SPECIAL 
AND SO I GUESS YOU HAVE TO MARK SPECIAL COLOUR AND SPECIAL FORM AS WELL DON'T YOU 
'CAUSE IT I IT IS VERY UNCONVENTIONAL I LIKE TO THINK IF IT AS UNCONVENTIONAL 
OH 
HUH DOESN'T MATCH UP DOES IT 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
I MEAN WE COULD TAKE WE COULD TAKE THE BATTERY OUT OF IT YOU USE AND IT'D PROBABLY WORK NINETY NINE PER CENT OF THE TIME BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SET UP A CALL CENTRE FOR THAT ONE PER CENT OF THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE CALLING AND SAYING OH LIKE MY REMOTE ISN'T WORKING WHAT AM I GONNA DO 
PEOPLE'D BE REAL UPSET 
I THINK IN THE LONG RUN IT'S BETTER TO KEEP THE BATTERY 
IT'S HARD TO SCRAP THE WHOLE CELL BATTERY IDEA 'CAUSE THAT'S SO INTEGRAL TO THE THEME THAT WE HAVE 
YEAH 
HMM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
I GUESS WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO THAT 
IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA GET BELOW OR UH GOAL ISN'T IT 
OF TWELVE FIFTY 
YEAH 
GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO 
MM 
REALLY GOOD 
SIX 
WE DID 
I AM BIT DISAPPOINTED ABOUT LOSING THE SOLAR PANEL BUT IT'S OKAY 
MM 
I KNOW 
TRUE 
OKAY 
RIGHT SO IT'S JUST KIND OF A OPEN MIC KIND OF THING OR 
'KAY 
YEAH 
ARE WE CONSIDERING THESE POINTS HERE 
OKAY 
NO 
YEAH IT'S TRUE 
MM 
DEFINITELY 
SO YOU WRITE YOUR PERSONAL COACH 
WHAT IF YOU GOT A RESPONSE TWO OR THREE MONTHS FROM NOW 
THAT'D BE WEIRD 
YEAH 
THAT'S VERY NATURAL 
YEAH 
AND TO PROVE THAT WE WEREN'T WASTEFUL WE DIDN'T WASTE A SINGLE BIT OF PLAY DOH WE USED VERY BUT 
YEAH I GUESS 
MY IN MY ONE CRITICISM IS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH COLOURS TO WORK WITH WE ONLY HAD FOUR WASN'T ENOUGH 
I KNOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN AMAZING 
HMM 
YEAH IT'S F KIND OF FUN IT WAS 
I THINK IT WAS PRETTY CLEVER 'CAUSE WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO GET IT FOR OFF TRACK BECAUSE THE INFORMATION CAME IN AT THE RIGHT TIME AND KIND OF FILLED IN THE GAPS ENOUGH 
AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAD ENOUGH ROOM TO KIND OF JUST MAKE THINGS UP WHICH WAS KIND OF FUN 
YEAH 
MM 
YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT WAS FUN 
I THINK THE MOST HELPFUL THING OUT OF EVERYTHING WAS GETTING THE THE POWERPOINT SLIDES ALREADY PUT TOGETHER FOR YOU 'CAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THERE'S NO WAY WE COULD HAVE GOT ALL THAT DONE IN TIME 
IT WAS REALLY GOOD YEAH 
IT'S KINDA FUN 
YEAH 
LITTLE DIFFERENT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU DON'T 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WONDER WHY IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE GET SO MUCH INFORM WHAT WAS IT THAT KEPT US FROM GOING TO THE THE BOARD 
YEAH THAT'S IT 'CAUSE THE MICS ARE ALSO AND EACH TIME YOU GET UP IT'S IS A POSSIBILITY OF TRIPPING OVER SOMETHING OR GETTING TANGLED OR 
YEAH THAT'S IT 
USUALLY I WOULD DO A LOT MORE DOODLING TOO BUT I DIDN'T BECAUSE 
NEW IDEAS 
HMM 
I GUESS WE'RE IN THE RIGHT TRACK 
NO NINE 
I THINK THEY'RE FINE ACTUALLY 
YEAH MAYBE A AS A CIRCLE WOULD BE ALRIGHT DIFFERENT 
ARE WE BACK INTO PROJECT MOOD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
DEFINITELY WHEN WHEN I FIRST FILLED OUT THE QUESTIONNAIRE I WAS MARKING IT PROBABLY HIGHER IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH I HAD TO HOW MUCH I STRESSED OVER IT AND THEN BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE LAST ONE I WAS LIKE 
YOU KNOW NOT VERY MUCH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
DID YOU REALLY 
I JUST GOT BLANK ONES AND 
UM IT 
I DELETED SLIDES 
THAT WAS PRETTY COOL IT WAS A HIGH MOMENT OF THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT 
I THINK IT WOULD FAIL I THINK 
IT'D BE A HUGE DISASTER ESPECIALLY IF IT LOOKS LIKE THAT 
I DON'T WE KIND OF DESIGNED IT IT LIKE LITTLE BIT LIKE A FACE 
IT'S A HAPPY FACE 
YEAH IT'S UH 
I WANNA USE A 
YEAH 
HMM 
SO WE HAVE MORE SLIDES OR 
MM 
HMM 
I 
IT'D BE SO COOL IF WE GOT A COPY OF THE RECORDING 
REALLY 
FILLER WORDS OR 
DISFLUENCIES 
I FIND MYSELF HITTING THE SOUND AND RECEIVE BUTTON ON THE EMAIL A LOT JUST OUT OF BOREDOM LIKE C COME ON GIMME SOMETHING 
IT IS SCARY 
YEAH 
IT'S CRAZY 
SO 
SHOULD 
HAS TO BEEN FORTY MINUTES OR WHATEVER 
THIS HAS BEEN LONG ENOUGH 
SO THAT THE ONLY SONG YOU HAVE 
THAT'S AWESOME 
MAYBE I HAVE A DIFFERENT ONE 
READY FOR THIS 
OH MAN 
NO IT'S IMPORTANT TO WE TALKED A QUITE A BIT ABOUT UH YOU KNOW THE THE INTERCHANGEABLE UH FOCUS AND WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS COME UP WITH A BIT OF A NATURAL LOOK HERE UM IF WE CALL IT FRUITY IF YOU WILL 
UM 
RIGHT UM 
OF COURSE THAT'S UH INTERCHANGEABLE AND UH I THINK IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE FOR THE UH FOR THE REGULAR PRODUCT IN THE ON THE ON THE ON THE FIRST PACKAGING TO BE SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE SUBDUED BUT THIS IS KIND OF SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE UM AND SO YOU CAN SEE IN THE TELEVISION THERE UH WE HAVE THE UH VOICE DETECTOR DEVICE UM IN THE TOP THREE 
UM 
SO THAT THAT WILL WORK QUITE WELL WITH WITH REGARD TO FINDING THESE UH CONTRAPTION 
UM WHAT OTHER THINGS DO WE SEE HERE WELL UM IF YOU GIVE IT A TOUCH IT DOES HAVE ACTUALLY A BIT OF A SPONGY FEEL 
UM SO I THINK THAT WILL WORK WELL WITH REGARDS TO OUR MARKET 
UM AND UH LET'S AS WELL CLEARLY THERE'S GONNA BE SOME MORE COLOURS AND WHAT NOT AVAILABLE 
UM UH DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD TO THAT 
IT'S ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO NOT THAT THE TELEVISION UH YOU KNOW IF THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT I IT ACTUALLY IS EDIBLE INSIDE 
UM IT'S ENCASED IN A NEW UH TYPE OF UH 
POLYMER YEAH 
IT'S FINE 
HMM 
IT'S POS A POSSIBLE NEW PRODUCT 
UM BUT I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT SUMS UP THE MAIN FEATURES OF OUR OF THE REMOTE 
UM I DUNNO IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR IF WHETHER THAT UH WHETHER WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ANY UH OTHER MARKETING AREAS OR ANYTHING OF THAT ENTIRE 
UM DID WE COME IN UNDER BUDGET 
MM-HMM 
MM 
DID WE TALK ABOUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH OPTION 
SO UH SO UH YEAH IN THE BACK HERE YOU ALL NOTICED THESE ARE HERE WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH UH CONSOLE AND UH I THINK IT'S NICELY DESIGNED INTO THE INTO THE OVERALL LOOK 
UM BUT BASICALLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH INCORPORATES UM THE LATEST DESIGNS THAT OUR RESEARCH TEAM HAS BEEN ABLE TO CUFW UH COME UP WITH 
BASICALLY UH QUITE SIMILAR TO THE COFFEE MAKER UM DESIGN THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER AND UM 
I THINK THAT HE HAS GIVEN A PROVEN UM SO IF SO AND WHAT NOT 
AND UH ALLOWS FEATURES LIKE THE REMOTE ACTUALLY TALKING BACK TO THE USER UM SO 
WELL WE DIDN'T QUITE HAVE ENOUGH MATERIAL UH 
UH I SEE RIGHT UM 
RIGHT 
ACTUALLY THIS BOTTOM RED RING HERE JUST UNCLIPS AND THEN YOU PUT A A NEW A NEW UH A NEW PLATE ON TOP OF THAT 
SO I MEAN THERE ARE I WE DEFINITELY PRICED OUT A SPONGY EVEN SPONGIER NON NATURAL LOOK UM MATERIALS WHICH I THINK WORKED OUT FINE 
WE ALSO CONTINUED IN WITH THE IDEAS THAT F FOLLOWING UH APPLE'S COLOUR SCHEMES WITH THE KIND OF THE UH LIGHT ORANGE AND THE GREEN 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION ARE ACTUALLY DOUBLES AS UH IS THE SOLAR CELL AREA 
YEAH 
I MEAN I THINK THAT UH IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT BEING ONE OF OUR MAIN SELLING FEATURES BEING ENVIRONMENTAL AND WITHOUT THE BATTERIES AND WHAT NOT 
ALTHOUGH IT DOES STILL HAVE A BATTERY SO I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE SELL AS IN THAT 
I MEAN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SWAY ME ON THE IDEA THAT WE ARE MAIN SELLING POINT COULD BE ALREADY THIS VOICE RECOGNITION THING I MEAN THAT'S WHAT SETS US APART RIGHT 
AND THE REALITY AS YOU KNOW FOR ME FROM AN IDEOLOGICAL STAND POINT I'D LIKE TO STICK WITH THE UH THE SOLAR CELL 
BUT I UH KIND OF HAVE TO THROW MYSELF IN THE ON THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE MODEL HERE AND UH YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK THAT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO COME TO A COMPROMISE HERE AND MAYBE MOVE AHEAD WITH THE PROJECT 
WITHOUT THE SOLAR CELL 
SAVINGS 
NO I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD COMPROMISE YOU BROUGHT FORWARD SARAH 
YEP 
THEY LIKE THAT SPONGY FEEL 
AND THE PAGING FUNCTION WORKS WELL THAT'S GOOD TO HERE WE WORKED HARD ON THAT ONE 
WE WE MIGHT HAVE UH WE MIGHT HAVE LOST THAT GRANOLA MARKET AGAIN THAT WE'RE 
I GUESS THAT'S TRUE 
WE DIDN'T USE THE WHITEBOARD AT ALL 
AND 
UM ALSO HAD I NOT BEEN INTRIGUED ABOUT THE PEN I DON'T THINK I WOULDA SAID IT AT ALL I DIDN'T WRITE BARELY ANYTHING 
OH 
I SEE I DON'T NO I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 
WE COULD DO WHATEVER BASICALLY WHAT WE WANTED UNTIL THE BUDGET CAME DOWN ONE IS UM 
WITH THE NATURAL LOOK 
I THINK THE TEAMWORK WAS GOOD AS WELL 
WELL I THINK THAT WAS I THINK THAT WAS AN ISSUE I KEPT FINDING WITH REGARD TO WELL NO BUT ALSO YEAH WHEN I WAS REPORTING ABOUT WHAT EACH OF US WAS DOING I WAS OFTEN CONFUSED AS TO WHAT YOU WERE DOING UM AND THEN I ALSO FELT LIKE YOU KNOW A LOT OF OUR DISCUSSION WOULD CENTRE AROUND N SPECIFICALLY WHAT MY TASK WAS BECAUSE THAT WAS KIND OF THE INTERFACE PORTION WHICH WAS WHAT THE WHOLE PROJECT WAS ABOUT UH BUT AND THEN ON THE AND I THINK OUR JOBS KIND OF MELDED TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT MORE 
WHICH WAS FUN 
MM-HMM 
AND I THINK YOUR LEADERSHIP WAS QUITE GOOD 
ONE IS IS THAT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE TAKEN ON THAT KIND OF ROLE 
I HAD TO ADMIT AS SOON AS WE WE STARTED I MEAN AS SOON AS WE GET THE PLAY DOH 
THE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF REALLY TRYING TO STICK WITH REALITY WENT TO THE WINDOW 
POSSIBLY 
OH YEAH STILL HAVE 'EM 
YEP 
I MEAN I THINK HAD THE ISSUE BEEN MORE SERIOUS WE PROBABLY WOULDA BRAINSTORMED MORE DURING OUR MEETINGS AS A TIME 
WELL I DUNNO WHAT I WOULDA SHOWN IN THAT BOARD 
I MEAN IT'S JUST LIKE THE PAPER I DON'T KNOW WHAT I REALLY NEEDED THE PAPER FOR 
UM BECAUSE I'VE GOT THIS LAPTOP 
STANDARD I JUST SAID IT 'CAUSE IT'S LITERALLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF UM 
SO SO THIS ALL WE NEED TO GET THROUGH 
SO IT 
ANY NEW IDEAS WITH REGARD TO REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS 
WHAT IS THAT 
OR LIMITED ABILITY TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX 
WHY 
HUH I THINK IT WAS THE REAL 
YEAH 
THINK IT WAS ALSO REALISATION OF YOU BASICALLY JUST COPY AND PASTE WHAT'S GIVEN TO YOU INTO YOUR PRESENTATION WHICH HE WASN'T IS CLEAR TO ME TO THE BEGINNING 
UH I ADDED LIKE FIVE SLIDES IT BUT I 
YEAH MINE TOO 
NO 
I ADDED MANY SLIDES EVERY TIME YEAH 
UM 
EVEN YOU 
ACTUALLY THAT LOOKED A LOT MORE LIKE A TONGUE FROM PREVIOUS TO UH FOR SOME OTHER DESIGN UH MODIFICATIONS 
I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THE UH INCORPORATION OF SOME TIN FOIL FROM A UH RANDOM KIT KAT BAR THAT HAPPENED TO BE CONSUMED 
SO AGAIN I REITERATE MY QUESTION OF HOW DIFFERENT WE ARE COMP COMPARED TO THE OTHER GROUPS ESPECIALLY BETWEEN CULTURE GROUPS AND WHAT NOT 
MM 
WHAT THE HOUSE AND THE 
MM 
THAT'S SCARY YEAH 
WELL JUST AROUND THAT EIGHT OR OR NINE PEOPLE THAT ARE 
DID I THINK WE'VE HAD INTERNET FOR LIKE EIGHTEEN YEARS

UM WE'RE GONNA MAKE A PROJECT PLAN AND THEN HAVE SOME TIME FOR DISCUSSION AND CLOSE UP THE MEETING 
OKAY HERE IS OUR PROJECT 
WE'RE GONNA MAKE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S UM ORIGINAL TRENDY AND ALSO USER FRIENDLY 
AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO IT IS EACH OF US IS GOING TO UM WE'RE GONNA HAVE DISCUSS THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN FIRST 
HOW IS IT GONNA BE USED WHAT'S THE ACTUAL GOAL HERE IT HAS TO OPERATE T. V. BLAH BLAH BLAH 
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO INDIVIDUAL WORK ON THAT AND THEN MUTE 
SAME THING WITH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
JUST THE BASIC OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO INDIVIDUAL WORK MEET 
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE THE WHOLE PROCESS FOR TODAY 
AND THEN THE DETAILED DESIGN JUST MORE IN DEPTH GET THE ACTUAL SCHEMATICS OF THE REMOTE 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
FIRST WE'RE GONNA START OFF BY USING OUR TOOLS 
AND THE WHITEBOARD THING DO YOU GUYS WANNA GIVE THAT A TRY EVEN THOUGH THE INK WASN'T WORKING OR DO YOU WANNA DO IT IN HERE 
ALRIGHT LET'S GO FORWARD THEN

I DON'T KNOW EVEN MUCH ABOUT GIRAFFES BUT I JUST LEAVE THE WAY THEY LIKE 
THEY'RE JUST SUCH ODD CREATURES YOU KNOW 
I I LIKE THAT THEY'RE AS UNIQUE AND INDIVIDUAL I GUESS 
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOUR OR ANYTHING THOUGH 
ONLY SEEN A COUPLE IN ZOOS 
YEAH BUT YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE WAY THEY LIKE 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
GUESS WE'RE GETTING STRAIGHT BACK INTO BUSINESS HERE 
UM THE SELLING PRICE FOR OUR REMOTE IS GOING TO BE TWENTY FIVE EURO AND OUR PROFIT AIM IS FIFTY MILLION EURO 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS AN INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT MARKETED IN THE STATES IN EUROPE IN SO 
AND UM OUR PRODUCTION COST TO MAKE THAT PROFIT IS GONNA BE A MAX OF TWELVE FIFTY EURO PER REMOTE 
OKAY 
SO WE'RE GONNA TALK FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
UM HERE ARE SOME TOPICS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DISCUSS 
EXPE OUR EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS UM OUR FIRST IDEAS ABOUT THIS NEW REMOTE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN BRING TO THE TABLE FOR THIS PROJECT 
SO 
YEAH 
YOU WANNA START US OFF 
ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING TO OFFER 
RIGHT 
TIVO 
THEY'RE NEVER UNIVERSAL 
THAT'S RIGHT

YEAH 
SOMETHING FROM SAM'S CLUB 
YEAH 
YEAH 
'KAY AND UM ANOTHER THING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THE DO THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT HOW IT FEELS IN YOUR HAND 
IF IT'S JUST FLAT AND KIND OF BRING THE THOSE DON'T NOBODY WANTS TO BUY THOSE ANY MORE 
THEY WANT THE ERGONOMIC ONES 
YEAH 
ONES THAT ONES THAT LIKE HIGH TECH TOO 
RIGHT 
SO THAT PEOPLE LIKE MY MOTHER CAN USE IT 
YEAH 
'KAY 
ANYBODY HAVE ANY EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS THAT THEY CAN REMEMBER THAT 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
DO SOME OF THEM AS TRIPLE A. IS THOUGH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
BUT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE SIZE OF IT IT 
WELL WE AS LONG AS WE KNOW THAT ISSUE IS 
HERE WE CAN 
TRIPLE A 
BUT IT'S OKAY WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT IT NOW JUST AS LONG AS WE REMEMBER BATTERY TYPE AND SIZE AS IMPORTANT 
HEY 
ANYTHING ELSE 
ALRIGHT 
MOVING ALONG 
UH WE'RE CLOSING THE MEETING 
NEXT MEETING IS GONNA START IN THIRTY MINUTES 
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO 
UM THE I. D. WHICH IS WHO 
OKAY YOU'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT THE WORKING DESIGN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS 
OKAY 
AND U. I. D. THE TECHNICAL FUN FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
MAKING SURE IT DOES EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED THE REMOTE TO DO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT OPERATING ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS 
OKAY 
AND THE MARKETING PERSON THAT'S COURTNEY IS GOING TO DO THE USER REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION 
I GUESS THAT MEANS SPECIFYING UM WHAT EXACTLY THE USER IS GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR 
RIGHT 
I WOULD THINK SO 
OKAY 
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET MORE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS EMAILED TO YOU IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE 
OKAY SO DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING THEY WANNA SAY BEFORE WE CLOSE THE MEETING 
OKAY 
THIS MEETING IS OFFICIALLY OVER 
YEP 
I THINK WE SHOULD FORGO THE WHITEBOARD SINCE WE CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE WHAT WE'RE WRITING 
ARTISTIC SKILLS NIL 
I DRAW LIKE 'EM IN GRADE FIVE 
I'LL GO 
I DRAW A KITTY 
IT'S PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL THAT'S A CAT BUT I LOVE CATS 
I LOVE CATS BECAUSE THEY'RE INDEPENDENT UH THEY PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHAT THEY WANT THEY GET IT THEY MOVE ON 
I'M ALLERGIC TO CATS TOO 
I STILL CAN'T SLEEP WITH THEM IN MY ROOM 
YAY 
OR YOU TRYING TO SUGGEST SOMETHING 
WELL WE WANNA MAKE A MULTIFUNCTIONAL REMOTE RIGHT 
ONE REMOTE FOR EVERYTHING 
UM 
I THINK THEY'LL BE PHASING V. H. S. OUT SHORTLY 
OKAY 
SO WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COVER ALL THE DIFFERENT VARIANCES IN SIGNALS 
WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING WITH THE CURVATURE LIKE THAT MATCHES THE CURVATURE OF A HAND 
WHAT KINDA BATTERY WOULD WE WANT TO USE 
BECAUSE BATTERY CHANGING IS USUALLY OKAY 
YEAH 
CAN YOU WITH A SMALL LITHIUM BATTERY 
JUST DO IT IN THE ARROW 
FINE 
NO I KN I KNOW 
YEAH 
OH 
IN MY NEXT LIFE 
UM I DRAW A BADGER

IT WAS CRAZY 
YEAH 
COOL 
OH OKAY 
NO THAT'S GOOD 
YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO I MEAN IF YOU LIKE 'EM 
RIGHT 
YEAH TIVO 
IT NEEDS TO BE COMPATIBLE 'CAUSE UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROLS ARE NEVER UNIVERSAL 
AND WHAT WE NEED AN INSANELY GOOD INSTRUCTION BOOKLET BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO RECONFIGURE ALL YOUR CONTRAPTIONS TO GO WITH THE REMOTE ANYWAYS 
THEY WANT LIKE THE FLASHY LIGHTS 
UH LIKE THIS CAME FROM LAS VEGAS 
MM YEAH 
DOUBLE A. 
YEAH SOME S TRIPLE A. S 
SO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE 
YEAH IF WE WANT TO TO BE MORE THAN THAN WE'D PROBABLY WANNA GO WITH A TRIPLE A.

UM GONNA COME TO A DECISION ON THE FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA CLOSE UP THE MEETING 
AND WE'RE GONNA DO THIS ALL IN ABOUT FORTY MINUTES 
OKAY 
FIRST I WANT TO DISCUSS THE GOALS OF THIS MEETING 
FIRST WE NEED TO DETERMINE THE USER REQUIREMENTS AND THE QUESTION THAT WE CAN ASK OURSELVES IS WHAT NEEDS AND DESIRES ARE TO BE FULFILLED BY THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DETERMINE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THE APPARATUS 
WHAT ACTUALLY IS IT SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT DO PEOPLE PICK UP THE REMOTE AND SO IT FOR 
AND THEN LASTLY WE'RE GOING TO DETERMINE ITS WORKING DESIGN HOW EXACTLY WILL TO PERFORM ITS FUNCTIONS THAT'S THE WHOLE TECHNICAL SIDE OF 
'KAY I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A MINUTE 'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE MAKING SOME NOTES 
'KAY 
UH WELL LET'S GO AHEAD AND BACK PREVIOUS 
SO WHAT I WANNA DO RIGHT NOW IS HEAR FROM ALL THEIR IF YOU IN YOUR RESEARCH THAT YOU JUST ADD

NOW THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED OKAY 
DO YOU WANT ME TO RUN IT OR YOU WANNA OKAY 
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
ALRIGHT 
NOW WE HAVE COURTNEY WITH THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
OKAY WHAT DO YOU M UH I'M SORRY 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY UM THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL WITH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER LIKE THEY HAVE TO PRESS THE BUTTONS 
OKAY 
OH RIGHT 
THE BUTTONS 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
IT WORKS 
READY FOR THE NEXT SLIDE 
HMM 
IT'S OKAY 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
COULD BE YEAH 
OH 
I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD GUESS THOUGH 
YEAH 
IT'S OKAY 
OKAY 
NEXT SLIDE 
USER FRIENDLY 
AND SO JUST TO JUST TO CLARIFY BY SPEECH RECOGNITION YOU MEAN THEY WOULD SAY CHANNEL FIVE AND THE THING WOULD GO TO CHANNEL FIVE 
OKAY 
OH THAT'D BE LOVELY 
DIDN'T THEY UM DIDN'T OUR RIVAL COMPANIES MANUFACTURE A REMOTE THAT YOU WOULD PRESS THE BUTTON ON THE T. V. AND IT WOULD THE REMOTE WOULD BEEP SO IF YOU HAVE LOST IT 
MM 
OH YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
WE COULD DEFINITELY INCLUDE THAT IF WE WANTED TO 
IF IT'S WITHIN OUR PRICE 
OKAY 
ARE WE READY FOR OUR LAST PRESENTATION AMBER 
OKAY 
THERE WE GO 
'KAY 
OH MY BAD 
OKAY 
READY 
THAT'S OKAY 
HMM 
SO THIS WOULD BE THE FRONT 
SO THE RED WOULD BE THE FRONT OF THE REMOTE THOUGH RIGHT 
OKAY 
THE L THE LIGHT UP KIND OF YEAH 
HMM 
IT'D PROBABLY BE LIGHTING UP THE KEY TOO RIGHT 
'KAY 
THE BUTTONS 
OKAY 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
'KAY NEX R READY 
'KAY ANY P 'KAY 
ANYTHING YOU WANNA ADD FOR PERSONAL PREFERENCES THOUGH YOU IF YOU SAID ALREADY THAT WE NEEDED A LARGE ON OFF BUTTON YOU THINK 
ANYTHING ELSE 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY LET'S TALK ABOUT ALL OF OUR 
WE'LL COME TO DECISION LATER BUT ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT WE NEED TO INCLUDE LET'S UM WRAP UP THIS ONE AND I'M GONNA GO BACK TO MY POWERPOINT 
'CAUSE WE NEED TO DISCUSS THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS WHICH YOU MIGHT'VE ALREADY SEEN FLASHED UP ON THE SCREEN A BIT EARLIER 
WAIT COME BACK 
ALRIGHT 
SORRY LET'S GO THROUGH THIS 
ALRIGHT 
HERE WE GO 
NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS 
FIRST IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE A T. V. REMOTE 
WE'RE TRYING NOT TOO OVER COMPLICATE THINGS 
SO IN D. V. D. NO TIVO NO STEREO 
IT'S NOT GONNA BE MULTI FUNCTIONAL 
HEY 
AND WE THE NEED TO PROMOTE OUR COMPANY MORE SO WE NEED TO SOMEHOW INCLUDE OUR COLOUR AND OUR COMPANY SLOGAN ON THE REMOTE 
WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUR NAME OUT THERE IN THE WORLD 
OKAY 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT TELETEXT IS 
IN STATES WE DON'T HAVE TO BUT UM IT'S LIKE THEY JUST HAVE THIS CHANNEL WHERE JUST HAS NEWS AND WEATHER KIND OF SPORTS 
IT'S VERY UM BLAND LOOKING IT'S JUST TEXT ON THE SCREEN NOT EVEN YEAH JUST BLACK WITH JUST TEXT 
YEAH 
KIND OF 
YEAH IT'S THE WHOLE SCREEN 
SO ANYWAY 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
BUT IT'S BECOMING OUT DATED NOW BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET 
NOBODY NEEDS TO GO TO THE TELETEXT CHANNEL TO CHECK THE NEWS 
AND WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOUR NEWS CHANNELS NOW TO USE THESE ARE OUR NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS 
ALRIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YES 
IT'S PART OF THE LOGO 
OKAY 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW IS COME TO SOME DECISIONS DEFINITIVE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON 
BUT UM THE TARGET GROUP AND THE FUNCTIONS AND JUST DEFINITE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO AND THEN WE'LL CLOSE UP THE MEETING 
SO 
ALRIGHT 
WHATEVER 
OKAY 
SO OUR TARGET GROUP AS YOU MENTIONED UM OLDER PEOPLE 
WOULD IT JUST BE UNIVERSAL FOR EVERYONE YOU THINK 
BECAUSE I THINK EVEN IF SOMETHING HAS LARGE BUTTONS AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT CHILDISHLY LARGE LIKE EVEN TECHNICALLY 
NON TECHNICALLY CHALLENGED PEOPLE ARE GONNA USE IT 
I MEAN THEY WANT SOMETHING USER FRIENDLY SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY SO WE WANT ME FOR OUR TARGET GROUP WOULD WE SAY 
I MEAN YOUNG AND OLD ALL AGE RANGES ALL UM NOT KIDS OBVIOUSLY RIGHT 
OR KIDS 
OKAY SO WE'RE GOING TO GO ANYWHERE FROM KIDS TO ADULT IN THE AGE RANGE UM WHAT ABOUT 
TECHNIC TECHNICAL UM SPECIFICATIONS LIKE HOW HOW TECHNICALLY LITERATE ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE USING OUR REMOTE 
OKAY 
RIGHT OKAY 
SO SO THEY NEED AN TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE TO OPERATE 
OKAY 
AND WE ALSO NEED TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THIS JUST TO GET IT ALL IT ON PAPER 
SO WE SAID IT NEEDS TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE T. V. NEEDS TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL TURN ON AND OFF JUST BASIC SIMPLE STUFF LIKE THIS 
SO IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING JUST SAY IT AND WE'LL ADD TO TO MY MEETING MINUTES 
MM-HMM VOLUME 
RIGHT 
AND WE WANNA KEEP UM I'LL MAKE A NOTE HERE THAT WE WANNA KEEP THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS DOWN 
CORRECT BECAUSE PEOPLE ONLY USE TEN PERCENT 
'KAY 
HEY WHAT ELSE 
UM 
I THINK SO 
WHAT DO YOU 
A FINDING KIND OF DEVICE OR YEAH HO HOMING DEVICE 
MM 'KAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
HMM 
WOULD THAT ADD TO OUR COSTS AT ALL I WONDER 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
I I THINK WE CAN MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THAT LATER 
UH WE'LL STILL PUT THAT IS A POINT THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS 
SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE BATTERY SOURCE 
POWER SOURCE RATHER 
SO IT GOING TO HAVE A CHARGER OR IS IT GOING TO BE RUN STRICTLY OFF BATTERIES 
AND WE ALSO NEED TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE YOU MENTIONED OF SPEECH RECOGNITION IF WE WANT THAT 
MM 
YOU COULD UM WE COULD HOOK IT UP 
OH 
MM-HMM 
AND IF AND IF WE INTRODUCED IT WHEN THEY'RE THIS AGE THEY'RE GOING TO PROBABLY ALWAYS BUY A REMOTE THAT HAS 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
AND THE SPEECH RECOGNITION COULD BE PART OF THE LAST AND FOUND DEVICE TO 
IF WE SAID FIND REMOTE LOCATE REMOTE OR SOMETHING 
A CERTAIN PHRASE 
THEN IT COULD BEEP 
I DUNNO 
JUST THROWING IT OUT THERE 
WELL 
OKAY ANYTHING ELSE WE WANNA DISCUSS 
UM 
HOW HOW YEAH HOW WOULD YOU LEAVE THIS IT 
UNLESS YOU COULD SAY THE CHANNEL 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
AND ALSO REMEMBER THAT IN THIS DAY IN AGE WE NEED YOU KNOW LIKE A HUNDRED BUTTON IT 
I USED TO HAVE A REMOTE THAT DID NOT EVEN GO UP PAST LIKE FIFTY 
SO I COULDN'T WHENEVER I GOT CABLE I HAD TO GET A NEW T. V. 
MM 
GET YOUR OWN REMOTE OR DIGITAL CABLE 
'KAY 
UM 
I GUESS WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS THE PROJECT FINANCING LATER MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN FIT ALL OF THE STUFF THAT WE WANT IT IN OUR BUDGET 
UM 
'KAY 
AND DON'T FORGET WE NEED TO INCLUDE THE COLOUR 
OF OUR COMPANY AND THE LOGO 
I'M GUESSING 
AND THE R. R. 
WE COULD JUST HAVE THE LOGO IN YELLOW OR MAYBE A YELLOW LIGHT FOR THE KEYS 
RIGHT 
SO WE'VE SIMPLIFIED WE DON'T NEED ALL THESE UM PLAY FAST FORWARD REWIND 
OR ONE MENU BUTTONS 
SO WE'VE PRETTY MUCH PARED IT DOWN TO ON OFF VOLUME MUTE CHANNEL UP AND DOWN UM THE NUMBERS 
YEAH 
UM CAN WE GO BACK TO I'M GONNA LOOK REALLY QUICKLY BACK TO THIS 
EXAMPLES AND SO IF THERE IS ANYTHING 
WHICH ONE IS YOURS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS ARE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT 
OKAY 
THE T. V. 
I THINK THAT THAT'S FINE JUST FOR THE T. V. 
I MEAN HOW OFTEN DOES THE AVERAGE USER NEED TO DO THAT KIND OF STUFF 
HMM 
COULDN'T WE DO THAT ALL THROUGH ONE BUTTON SOMETHING A MENU BUTTON THAT POPS UP WITH A MENU ON THE T. V. THAT SAYS 
YOU KNOW AUDIO VIDEO WHATEVER LANGUAGE YOU KNOW 
FOR THE MENUS 
THAT'S TRUE 
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS MAYBE YOU KNOW 
YOU RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT 
THAT ONE 
RIGHT 
IN THE MIDDLE PERHAPS 
YEP 
GOOD 
ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE THEY'D LIKE TO BRING UP ON THIS MEETING 
OKAY 
GET OUT OF HERE 
LET'S GO BACK TO THE MEETING CLOSURE THEN AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT 
MM 
ALRIGHT 
AFTER THIS MEETING WE'RE GONNA BE SENT A QUESTIONNAIRE AND SUMMARY AGAIN WHICH WE NEED TO REPLY TO THAT E MAIL 
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE LUNCH BREAK 
AND AFTER LUNCH THIRTY MINUTES OF INDIVIDUAL WORK TIME 
UM I'M GONNA PUT THE MINUTES I PUT THE MINUTES FOR THE FIRST MEETING ALREADY ON THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER IF YOU'D LIKE TO REVIEW THEM 
AND I'M GONNA TYPE UP THE MINUTES FOR THIS ONE AS WELL 
UM HERE'S WHAT WE'RE EACH GOING TO DO 
THE I. D. IS GOING TO WORK ON THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT UM U. I. D. THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOME TREND WATCHING 
'KAY 
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH 
AND IF ANYBODY HAS ANYTHING THEY WOULD LIKE TO ADD 
NO 
OKAY WELL THIS MEETING IS OFFICIALLY OVER 
THANK YOU ALL 
DID YOU SEND IT 
OKAY 
GREAT 
WE ONLY USE TEN PER CENT OF OUR BRAINS 
YEAH 
DO WE REALLY NEED TO TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT R. S. A. S 
YEAH I'M JUST TRYING TO MOVE IT 
'KAY 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE THERE WORKING DESIGN 
'KAY 
UH I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO COMPLETE THIS ONE 'CAUSE SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT I WAS GIVEN WERE FRUSTRATING 
OH OKAY SO METHOD METHOD OF OUR DESIGN I THINK I JUST START LISTING TH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO PUT INTO THIS 
WE NEED A POWER SOURCE WE'RE GONNA NEED A SMART CHIP IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT MULTI FUNCTIONAL 
UM EXTRA FUNCTIONS WILL PROBABLY NEED AN ADDITIONAL CHIP 
THERE THAT ARE THE SMART CHIP WILL HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY SMART 
USUALLY A SMART CHIP IS JUST A CHIP THAT'S BEEN PROGRAMMED AND DESIGNED SO THAT IT CAN COMPLETE A FAIR RANGE OF FUNCTIONS 
I WOULDN'T THINK SO 'CAUSE WE COULD PROBABLY GET IT FROM LIKE IN BULK FROM A A NEWER COMPANY 
AND THEY TEND TO SELL THEIR CHIPS PRETTY CHEAP 
UM YEP NOTHING HERE 
UM POWER SOURCE I FIGURED BATTERIES 'CAUSE THEY'RE EASILY AVAILABLE 
TYPICALLY A REMOTE HAS OTHER TWO DOUBLE A. S OR FOUR TRIPLE A. IS SOMETIMES THREE 
UH IT REALLY KINDA DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE ACTUAL REMOTE ITSELF 
UM A LARGE ON OFF BUTTON DEMOGRAPHICALLY WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS AN OLDER GENERATION OF PEOPLE USE A LARGE ON OFF BUTTON WOULD PROBABLY BE GOOD 
SELECTION BUTTON FOR VARIOUS ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES AS YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL PERMIT YOU TO SELECT THE D. V. D. PLAYER OR THE T. V. OR THE STEREO SYSTEM 
UM SMART CHIP THAT PERVERTS UH THAT PERMITS SORRY UNIVERSAL APPLICATION AGAIN 
SOMETHING THAT'LL ALLOW US TO SKIP OVER BETWEEN DEVICES AND THAT'S KINDA IT 
UH THIS IS MY FIFTY SECOND DESIGN 
POWER SOURCE OVER HERE 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SWITCH OBVIOUSLY BETWEEN THE POWER SOURCE AND THE REST OF IT AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED THE SWITCH 
UM EXTRA BULB COULD JUST BE FOR FLASHINESS UM SUBCOMPONENT WHICH WOULD BE LIKE A WAY OF DIVERTING THE POWER IT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE THE DEVICE 
UM THE CHIP AND OF COURSE THE INFRA RED BULB SO IT CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE VARIOUS DEVICES THAT IT NEEDS TO TALK TO 
THIS IS JUST LIKE A ROUGH SCHEMATIC 
SO THIS IS THE INTERNAL WORKINGS 
YEAH 
YEAH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO STORE IT THAT INFRA RED 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN THE BATTERY STARTS DYING IN YOUR REMOTE CURRENTLY 
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY STARE AT THAT BULB AND GO OKAY WHEN I PUSH THIS BUTTON IS IT WORKING 
WE CAN SKIP THAT WHOLE THING 
YEP 
SO YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE DARK 
YEAH THAT'S IT 
I THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS 
OKAY 
YOU CAN ALSO GOT THE KIND OF THE T. V. GUIDE US 
IT'S THE ENTIRE SCREEN IS JUST RUNNING INFORMATION AT RANDOM 
SEEMINGLY 
OKAY 
SO DO WE HAVE TO INCLUDE THE COMPANY COLOUR WITHIN THAT 
MM WELL EVEN IF WE KEPT THE REGULAR STANDARD SIZE OF REMOTE 
IF WE REDUCED THE BUTTONS DOWN TO THE ONES THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THEY USE THE MOST OFTEN AND A COUPLE EXTRA 
'CAUSE THEY'RE SAYING THEY ONLY USE TEN PER CENT OF THEM THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE FAIRLY DECENT SIZED BUTTONS 
MOST OF THEM WILL INTUITIVELY PICK IT UP THOUGH 
HOW 'BOUT LITTLE IT IN BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY THAT YOU ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT IN 
DO WE WANT THIS THING TO BE ABLE TO BE FOUND EASILY 
AND 
LIKE IF THIS IS GONNA GET LOST UNDERNEATH THE COUCH HOW ARE WE GOING TO ACCOMMODATE THE QUICK ABILITY TO FIND OUT 
WHAT IF WE GIVE IT A CHARGER 
AND IN THE CHARGER JUST LIKE A PHONE LIKE YOU GOT A PORTABLE PHONE AND IT'S GOT A CHARGER AND IF YOU DO LEAVE YOUR PHONE SOMEWHERE 
YOU PUSH THE BUTTON TO FIND OUT AND IT FINDS TH THE PHONE BEEPS FOR YOU 
IT'S USEFUL FOR THE REMOTE PHONE 
YEAH 
RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES ARE CHEAPER USUALLY 
YEAH 
I THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND THAT TOO FOREIGN 
IT'S WHEN WE GET SATELLITE 
YEAH 
YEAH 'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY MATERIAL PRICING INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ME TO THE MOMENT SO 
R. THE DOUBLE R. 
OR IS THE L 
YEAH YELLOW COULD BE AND IT COULD DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HUGE 
MM-HMM 
I HAD SOMETHING BUT I FORGOT 
I DON'T MIND GOING FIRST 
YEAH IT'S IN THE SHOULD BE IN THE AMI PROJECT 
YOU KNOW YOU COULD YOU COULD DO IT YOURSELF ACTUALLY 
PUT IT IN PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH 
SURE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM WELL THE FUNCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL IS WHAT UH WE'VE BEEN INFORMED 
SO BASICALLY TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET FOR EXAMPLE 
SWITCH IT ON SWITCH IT OFF GO TO THIS CHANNEL GO TO CHANNEL NINE TURN THE VOLUME UP ETCETERA 
UM SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS IS JUST UM FOR EXAMPLE THE WHAT IT NEEDS TO INCLUDE IT'S THE NUMBERS 
YOU KNOW ZERO TO NINE SO YOU CAN MOVE IT A CHANNEL THE POWER BUTTON ON SLASH OFF 
THE CHANNEL GOING UP AND DOWN 
VOLUME GOING UP AND DOWN AND THEN MUTE 
A MUTE FUNCTION 
AND THEN FUNCTIONS FOR V. H. S. D. V. D. FOR EXAMPLE PLAY REWIND FAST FORWARD STOP PAUSE ENTER 
AND ENTER WOULD BE FOR LIKE YOU KNOW THE MENUS 
AND THEN OTHER MENUS FOR D. V. AS WELL AS T. V. 
WHETHER THAT MEANS LIKE UM WE CAN GO AND DECIDE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SCREEN THINGS LIKE THAT ALL THE MORE COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS OF MENUS 
AND WE CAN DECIDE IF THAT'S WHAT WE WANT ME IF WE WANT TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE REMOTE 
IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD STAY IN THE T. V. ITSELF FOR EXAMPLE 
THESE ARE TWO EXAMPLES 
UM AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE LEFT IT'S GOT A LOT MORE BUTTONS 
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN READ IT BUT IT SAYS STEP GO TO FREEZE 
UM SLOW REPEAT PROGRAM MUTE AND SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE BUTTONS AND SO IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF US AN EXAMPLE 
AND THEN ON THE RIGHT IT'S A LOT MORE SIMPLER IT'S GOT VOLUME IT'S GOT THE PLAY THE LIKE CIRCLE SET WHICH IS PLAY 
REWIND BUT IT'S ALSO WHAT IS FAST FORWARD IS ALSO LIKE NEXT IN A MENU 
SO YOU HAVE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE D UH DUPLICATING 
AND YOU HAVE A MUTE BUTTON AND THEN THE NUMBERS AND THE EJECT AND THE POWER BUTTON 
SO THAT GIVES YOU TWO DIFFERENT KINDS A MORE COMPLEX AND MORE SIMPLE VERSION 
OKAY 
AND THEN LASTLY IT'S JUST THE QUESTIONS THAT WE WANT TO CONSIDER LIKE WHAT FUNCTIONS DO WE WANT TO TO INCLUDE 
AND HOW SIMPLE COMPLEX IT SHOULD BE 
AND WHAT FUNCTIONS IT NEEDS TO COMPLETE 
UH WHAT ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE INSULATION PROCESS 'CAUSE YOU KNOW 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALSO HAS TO BE CONSIDERED AND IT'S GONNA BE HOPEFULLY A ONE TIME THING 
WHEN YOU SET IT UP IT SHOULD BE SET TO GO 
BUT WE HAVE TO INCLUDE THE FUNCTIONS THAT CAN ALLOW TO TO SET UP I IN THE FIRST PLACE 
SO THAT'S IT 
MM 
LEFT 
WAIT 
AND THAT MEANING WHAT 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS 
LOST 
SO 
WAIT IS THAT LIKE YOUR 
ERGONOMICS LIKE YOUR HAND MOVEMENTS OR SOMETHING 
LIKE 
CHANNEL VOLUME POWER 
IT'S LIKE IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT 
IT JUST SAY WHERE ARE YOU NEED THING BEEPS YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
IT'S KINDA LIKE WHAT THE REMOTE PHONE USED TO DO 
YOU KNOW LIKE GO TO THE BASE 
YEAH 
WORKING DESIGN 
HELP ME 
WELL HOW MUCH EXTRA WOULD THE ADDITIONAL CHIP BE 
SO THAT GONNA PUSH US OVER OUR PRODUCTION COSTS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S GONNA BE WHAT'S COMMUNICATING WITH THE T. V. BUT THE OTHER BULB I THINK 
SO GOOD TO JUST TO INDICATE I'M DOING SOMETHING IT'S SORT OF LIKE A REASSURANCE 
YEAH 
JUST 
WELL SHOULD TO BE LARGER BUTTONS IN GENERAL YOU KNOW LIKE UH THE EXAMPLES THAT I HAD THEY WERE SWI QUITE SMALL 
SO SHOULD WE TRY AND GO FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS L LARGER BUTTONS 
OVALS 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
I KNOW 
YEAH IT'S LIKE BLACK BLACK AND WHAT KIND OF 
IT'LL GIVE YOU THE SPORTS 
EXCEPT THE ENTIRE SCREEN 
YOU CAN PICK SPORTS YOU CAN PICK THE NEWS YOU ENTERTAINMENT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE 
YEAH 
COMPANY COLOUR BEING YELLOW 
MM-HMM 
IT'S GONNA MAKE IT NICER 
YEAH 
WE SHOULD GO FOR THE LOWEST DENOMINATOR 
HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED 
WELL IT'S CHANNEL ON OFF BUTTON VOLUME MUTE 
UM 
OH RIGHT YEAH OKAY 
TRACKING 
BUT YOU GOT A BASE 
WELL IF YOU HAVE THE BASE YOU COULD START PUTTING IN A CHARGER AND THEN YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF BATTERY 
YEAH 
WELL THEN WE COULD IF WE HAVE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN WE CAN START AIMING AT A LIKE ANOTHER KIND OF MORE HANDICAPPED DISABLED UH DEMO DEMOGRAPHIC 
WELL 
WELL THEN THEN DO YOU PUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION DO YOU PUT THE OR LIKE RECEIVER ON THE ACTUAL TELEVISION 
IN THE BASE OR IN THE ACTUAL REMOTE 
'CAUSE THEN YOU'VE ALREADY GOT REMOTE IN YOUR HAND WHY YOU JUST GONNA SPEAK TO THE REMOTE 
WHEREAS IF YOU JUST SPEAK IN GENERAL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE REMOTE IN YOUR HAND AND LIKE TALK TO IT 
STILL FIFTEEN MINUTES 
UM 
WELL DO WE WANNA INCLUDE THE NUMBERS LIKE ZERO THROUGH NINE 
CAN WE CONCEIVE OF LEAVING THEM OUT 
YEAH LIKE YOU HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE ZERO 
WELL I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IF YOU CAN LOOK WELL I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S JUST A WAY OF LEAVING THEM OUT 
THE COLOUR BEING YELLOW 
AND HOW DO WE 
CAN'T MAKE IT ENTIRELY 
WELL IF YOU HAVE LIKE A HANG ON 
IF YOU HAVE THESE SORT OF STRIP KIND OF DOWN TO THE BOTTOM THE BASE OF IT JUST LIKE YELLOW WITH THE R. R. 
RIGHT YEAH 
TWO EXAMPLES 
YEAH 
UH IT'S A YEAH 
WELL THE OTHER OPTION IS SORT OF LIKE DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LIKE FARTHER AWAY 
YOU JUST HAVE THESE SORT OF BOX INSET WHERE IT'S LIKE THE BUTTONS THAT YOU DON'T USE AS MUCH BUT OCCASIONALLY YOU WILL SEE 
AND SO IT'S LIKE 
I DON'T WELL I DON'T KNOW 
RIGHT 
WELL THAT COULD BE ONE YOU COULD JUST DOUBLE UP WITH LIKE THE CHANNEL OR THE VOLUME BUTTONS 
CHANNEL IS JUST UP AND DOWN 
AND THEN ADD A 
YEAH 
SO WE JUST HAVE TO LIKE ADD A MENU BUTTON THEN FOR THE VARIOUS THINGS NEEDED 
INCLUDING V VOICE RECOGNITION IF WE HAVE ANY LIKE SETTINGS FOR VOICE RECOGNITION NOW 
INCLUDED IN THE MENU 
DO YOU WANT US TO DO OUR POWERPOINTS NOW OR 
I CAN GO 
YEAH YOU SHOULD RUN IT 
MM YES 
YES OKAY SO WE TESTED A HUNDRED SUBJECTS IN OUR LAB AND WE JUST WE WATCHED THEM AND WE ALSO MADE THEM FILL OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE 
AND WE FOUND THAT THE USERS ARE NOT TYPICALLY HAPPY WITH CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT THINK THEY'RE UGLY 
EIGHTY PERCENT WANT THEY'VE ARE WILLING TO SPEND MORE WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR US UM IF WE MAKE IT LOOK FANCIER 
AND BASICALLY WE WE JUST NEED SOMETHING THAT REALLY I MEAN THERE'S SOME OTHER POINTS UP THERE BUT THEY IT NEEDS TO BE SNAZZY AND IT BUT YET SIMPLE 
SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO 
AND WE NEED WE NEED TO TO BE SIMPLE YET IT NEEDS TO BE HIGH TECH LOOKING 
SO 
LIKE 
THEY LIKE I GUESS SO THE BUTTONS A LOT 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
IT'S FROM MY UH RESEARCH 
MY TEAM WASN'T VERY CLEAR 
THAT'S OKAY 
I I THINK IT'S LIKE THE ENGINEERING VERSUS USER 
WHEREAS LIKE THE ENGINEERING SHE SHOWED THAT THE ENGINEERING ONES ARE MORE COMPLEX AND USERS DON'T REALLY NEED ALL OF THE BUTTONS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THERE 
BECAUSE THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS REALLY 
GOOD POINT 
IT'S A NECESSARY EVIL 
MM-HMM 
AND SO PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY TYPICALLY LOSE IT AS YOU YOURSELF KNOW BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY LOSE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL ALL THE TIME 
MUCH LIKE ANY SMALL APPLIANCE LIKE A CELLPHONE AND THEY WE NEED SOMETHING SIMPLE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE 
WELL THIRTY FOUR PERCENT SAY THAT IT'S JUST TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW ONE 
AND WE DON'T WANT TO GO WE DON'T WANT TO VARY TOO FAR FROM THE NORMAL STANDARD REMOTE 
BUT I MEAN THEY DO NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IT AND R. S. I. I'M NOT VERY SURE WHAT THAT IS 
YES IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL WORLD 
SH 
UH POSSIBLY 
OH YEAH THAT'S WHAT MY WEB SITE SAID I 
DON'T KNOW 
YEAH I WOULD ASSUME SO 
I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW TO USE REMOTE CONTROL EXPERTS 
BUT ALSO IS IS THE CHANNEL 
THE VOLUME AND THE POWER BUTTONS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT IN OUR COMPANY WEBSITE YOU CAN FIND LIKE THE SPECIFIC STATISTICS CONCERNING TO HOW MUCH EACH BUTTON IS USED 
BUT THOSE ARE THE DEFINITELY THE TOP ONES 
YES 
AND SO PERSONALLY I THINK THAT WE NEED A MODERN EYE CATCHING DESIGN BUT IT IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE SIMPLE 
SO SAYING FROM Y YOUR SLIDE YOUR PRESENTATION THE ENGINEERING VERSUS THE USER SPECIFIED REMOTES I THINK THAT WE SHOULD GO WITH SOMETHING THAT'S MORE USER FRIENDLY 
WHERE THE ENGINEERING ONES THE BOXES TEND TO MAKE IT LIKE MORE COMPLICATED THEN IT REALLY SEE 
UM THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PRODUCT REALLY NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS IT LIKE WHAT TYPE OF BUTTONS DO WE REALLY NEED ON IT 
AND IT NEEDS TO BE OPEN IT A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMERS SO EVEN THOUGH WE NEED A SMALL NUMBER OF BUTTONS 
WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE IN LIKE ARE MOST PEOPLE GOING TO BE USING IT FOR A D. V. D. PLAYER 
A TIVO WHAT WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE USING TOO FAR AS WELL AS THE AGE RANGE 
SO WE NEED A HIP BUT NOT A CORNY MARKETING SCHEME FOR PROMOTING OUR PRODUCT 
AND ALSO WE FIND OUR TEAM FOUND THAT SPEECH RECOGNITION SO IT'S LIKE AN UP AND COMING THING THEY REALLY CONSUMERS ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN IT 
AND SINCE OUR FINDINGS FOUND THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE MONEY FOR A REMOTE FOR IT TO BE MORE HIGH CLASS WE COULD CONSIDER IT 
I GUESS SO YEAH 
YEAH I GUESS WE CAN INTERPRET IT LIKE WE CAN JUST TRY TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPEECH RECOGNITION WITHIN OUR REMOTE PROGRAMME 
OH THAT'S FINE 
WHAT EXACTLY IS A SMART CHIP 
SO WHAT EXACTLY WE ARE LOOKING AT IS THIS LIKE THE FRONT OF THE REMOTE 
OH OKAY 
LIKE THAT WE KNOW THE BATTERY'S WORKING 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH AND THAT'S GOOD 
WE SHOULD MAKE IT GLOW IN THE DARK 
MM 'KAY 
I THINK WE SHOULD 
LIKE I THINK THAT WOULD BE IN A S IN LIKE ONE FOR THE DESIGN SORRY UM 
I THINK WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GO WITH BUTTONS THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE A NORMAL REMOTE 'CAUSE MOST REMOTES HAVE SMALL SQUARE BUTTONS 
I THINK WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE MAYBE BIGGER AND ROUND LIKE BUBBLES 
WHAT IS IT 
LIKE RUNNING ALONG THE BOTTOM 
WAIT IS IT LIKE THE WEATHER CHANNEL WHERE IT'S GOT LIKE THE TICKER RUNNING ON THE BOTTOM OR SOMETHING 
SO IT'S LIKE A SEPARATE CHANNEL FROM LIKE WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING 
OKAY 
NO KIDS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO USE A REMOTE I WOULD THINK 
THEY GOTTA CHANGE BETWEEN DISNEY CHANNEL CARTOON NETWORK 
YEAH I THINK WE NEED TO ALL 
UM I WOULD SAY WE SHOULD SAY DUMBER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON 
YEAH 
AND CHANNEL 
YEAH 
THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES 
YEAH 
SURE YEAH 
I AND WE WE NEED A LIKE HOMING DEVICE 
BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR A REMOTE THAT'S MORE HIGH TECH 
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE'LL REALLY GO FOR THAT THOUGH 
BECAUSE 
YEAH 
I WOULD THINK SO BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE TO DEVELOP A BASE 
HMM 
RIGHT 
DO WE 
WELL TH THERE'S THE PEOPLE WHO DESIRE SPEECH RECOGNITION THERE'S THE DIFFERENT DEMOG DEMOGRAPHICS HAVE DIFFERENT DESIRES I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS GE 
IT WOULDN'T COPY ONTO THE THE THING 'CAUSE IT'S BLACK BUT ALL THE DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS HAVE DIFFERENT DESIRES FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
SO BASICALLY OLDER PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE 
IT'S REALLY THE PEOPLE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE 
I FEEL THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY WATCH A LOT OF T. V. THOUGH 
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT GET ADDICTED TO SOAP OPERAS AND 
JUST SITCOMS AND STUFF 
RIGHT 
SO 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
WAIT ON THE REMOTE ITSELF 
WELL WE DEFINITELY NEED THIS 
YEAH 
YOU DEFINITELY NEED 
WAIT 
I FEEL LIKE A Y I FEEL LIKE A YELLOW ONE WOULD BE TOO GARISH 
OR PUT LIKE STRIPES OH YEAH YELLOW LIGHTS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AUDI AUDIO SETTINGS AND SCREEN SETTINGS WE NEED THOSE LIKE AUDIO SETTINGS MONO STEREO 
PITCH SCREEN SETTINGS LIKE BRIGHTNESS COLOUR OR DO WE JUST WANT THAT ACCESSED ACCESSED FROM THE TELEVISION ITSELF 
YEAH 'CAUSE WE NEED TO WE DEFINITELY NEED TO HAVE BUTTONS FOR LIKE SUB TITLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
IT'S 'CAUSE THE FOREIGN FILM MARKET IS EXPANDING AND STUFF 
AND LIKE ON TELEVISION LIKE I KNOW IF K LIVING IN LOS ANGELES IT'S TONS OF SPANISH NETWORK TELEVISION IF IT HAS ENGLISH SUB TITLES IT'S DEFINITELY HELPFUL 
SO WE NEED UP DOWN AND USED TO USED BUTTONS 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY YEAH 
SUCH AS YEAH THE ON THE ONE OVER THERE IN THE LEFT THE ENGINEERING CENTRED ONE 
UH I JUST GOT AN IDEA FOR A DESIGN 
OKAY 
UH TIME 
HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD LUNCH 
OKAY WE'RE BACK FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING 
UM LET'S GET STARTED 
'KAY HERE IS THE AGENDA FOR TODAY'S MEETING 
UM WE'RE GONNA OPEN IT AND I'M GONNA KEEP THE MINUTES AS PROJECT MANAGER 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS ON FROM EACH OF YOU AGAIN 
AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO COME TO DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA CLOSE IT UP 
AND WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES AGAIN 
'KAY AND JUST TO REITERATE UM AFTER THIS MEETING THE TIME WILL REACH A DECISION ON THE CONCEPTS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
LET'S GO AHEAD AND START OFF WITH YOUR PRESENTATIONS 
WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST 
OKAY 
UM COURTNEY WOULD YOU MIND STARTING US OFF 
OKAY 
TREND WATCHING 
'KAY 
MM 'KAY 
MM 
MM 
RIGHT 
YES 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
PEOPLE DON'T BUY A NEW REMOTE EVERY AS OFTEN 
OKAY 
HMM 
VERY GOOD 
I LIKE IT 
OKAY READY FOR THE NEXT SLIDE 
OP MM 'KAY 
GREAT 
GREAT PRESENTATION 
READY 
'KAY 
WHICH ONE IS IT

INTERESTING 
MM 
'KAY 
NO OKAY 
MM 
HMM 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU FOR THOSE INFORMATIVE PRESENTATIONS 
LET'S GO BACK TO ME NOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS 
WHERE WERE WE 
SURE 
MM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
MM 
HMM 
PROGRAMME 
IF IT'S WITHIN OUR PRICE TO GET THAT KIND OF CHIP THAT WOULD YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
OKAY THAT KIND OF BRINGS US TO THIS LET'S LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DECIDE WHAT KIND OF ENERGY SOURCE WE WANT TO HAVE FIRST AND FOREMOST 
UM 
DO WE WANNA GO FOR BATTERIES OR A STAND LIKE THE ON THAT WE SAW ILLUSTRATED EARLIER 
THE BASE THE CHARGING BASE WITH RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES 
HMM 
YEAH AND WE DON'T HAVE MULTIPLE THINGS THAT IT HAS TO CONTROL IT JUST HAS TO CONTROL THE T. V. 
IT'S NOT GONNA BE A HUGE UNIVERSAL REMOTE 
WHAT SIZE BATTERY AND 
RIGHT 
I AGREE IT'S EITHER GONNA BE BIGGER WITH A BASE OR SMALLER WITH JUST 
A BATTERY LIKE THIS GUY 
ALRIGHT SO WHAT DIRECTION DO YOU WANT TO GO ON 
YOU WANNA VOTE 
I'M KIND OF I'M KIND OF LEANING IN THE DIRECTION OF THOSE KIND OF 
BIGGER AND THE BASE 
THAT JUST SEEMS SO CLUNKY AND 
OKAY 
HMM 
OKAY SO WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL DO WE WANT TO BE MADE OUT OF 
NO 
UH WHAT DID YOU UH SORRY GO AHEAD 
RIGHT 
WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND 
MM 
I I THINK WE SHOULD JUST FOCUS ON ON DESIGN AND ONE CONCEPT RIGHT NOW 
REMOTES 
IF THIS WAS A SUCCESSFUL REMOTE WE MIGHT THEN PRODUCE A HIGHER END VERSION OF IT I THINK 
OKAY SO WE WANNA GO FOR PLASTIC OR WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND FOR MATERIALS 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
THEY COULD BUY CASES MAYBE 
IF THEY WANTED 
I THINK IT'S GOOD TO SELL A BASIC THING AND THEN SELL 
OPTIONS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY AND WHAT KIND OF CHIP WOULD WE NEED FOR THIS GUY 
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO VOICE I THINK WE SHOULD JUST DO UM THE RECOGNITION FOR WHEN IT'S LOST YOU KNOW 
COULD WE YEAH 
HMM 
RIGHT 
OH DEAR 
OKAY 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE VOICE ACTIVATED IN THE FACT THAT YOU WOULD SAY CHANNEL UP AND IT WOULD WORK RIGHT 
JUST A OKAY ALRIGHT 
NO 
MM 'KAY 
UH AND WHAT SIZE BATTERIES DOUBLE A. TRIPLE A. 
TWO 
COULD IT RUN OFF OF TWO 
THEY'RE MORE EXPENSIVE THOUGH IT 
MM 
THOUGHTS ANYBODY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
SO WE'VE COVERED THAT FIRST CATEGORY USER INTERFACE CONCEPT MEANING DESIGN 
OKAY 
I KI I KIND OF LIKE YOUR IDEA ABOUT THE RETRO PHONE DIAL AND THAT THE CENTRAL BUTTON COULD HAVE MAYBE OUR LOGO ON IT 
IT MIGHT BE THE FOUR WAY SCROLL IT 
I MEAN IF YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
UH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN 
I THINK SO 
YEAH I LIKE THAT 
'KAY 
MM 
CAN WE 
SO THAT YOU'RE JUST NOT HOLDING IT AND IT CHANGES THE CHAN 
MM 
YEAH 
HMM 
'KAY ANY OTHER IDEAS 
OH YEAH 
LATEX COVERS 
WE 
I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD DO IT IN A B BUTTON ITSELF THOUGH 
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO CHANGE THE COVERS I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THE ON OFF BUTTON 
SOMETHING SOME THE MENU BUTTON I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA PUT OUR COMPANY LOGO IN THERE AND SOMEBODY COULD JUST GOT 
ANOTHER ONE 
ARE THEY ALL GONNA HAVE OUR COMPANY LOGO ON THEM 
EVERY COVER 
YEAH 
IF WE WANT TO TO BE VISIBLE AND 
UM ARE ALL THIS THIS ONE THAT YOU SHOWED WHERE THEY WERE UM S MET SILVER METALLIC LOOKING 
BUT THOSE ARE PLASTIC RIGHT 
THEY'RE NOT TITANIUM 
I KIND OF LIKE THAT LIKE 
UH BUT OR IF IT WAS REALLY YEAH FOR THE BASE OR IF WE'RE GOING FOR THE RETRO LOOK 
I THINK LIKE A REALLY SHINY BLACK WOULD BE COOL 
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS 
GUN METAL GRAY 
THERE YOU GO GUN METAL GRAY 
WHY 
MM 
RIGHT 
IN THE BACK 
IT D VISIBLE VISIBILITY THOUGH 'CAUSE IF IT WAS ONLY IN THE BACK REALLY THE ONLY TIME YOU'RE GONNA USE IT IS WHEN YOU DROP IT OR WHEN YOU'RE CHANGING THE BATTERY 
I CAN FIND IT AGAIN 
OKAY 
AND YOURS WAS CALLED INTERFACE CONCEPT 
THIS ONE 
WELL FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T GET IT IT JUST GO TO THAT SLIDE DIRECTLY 
MM 
OKAY YES YES 
OKAY 
LIKE A LITTLE CUT OUT KIND OF 
OKAY 
ANYBODY SEE ANYTHING THAT THEY LIKED IN THESE ONES 
MM 
MM 
YELLOW I LIKE THAT IDEA 
MM 
MM 
I LIKE THE YELLOW ILLUMINATION IDEA VERY GOOD 
OKAY 
ANY OTHER IDEAS OR THOUGHTS 
WE ALL SEEM TO BE FAIRLY IN AGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT WE WANNA DO WITH THIS PROJECT IS 
'KAY 
I THINK THERE WILL BE TIME FOR THAT LATER 
I'M GUESSING 
'KAY WELL WE'RE GONNA WRAP THIS UP 
UM NEXT MEETING IS GONNA START IN THIRTY MINUTES 
AND HERE'S WHAT WE'RE EACH OF IS GOING TO DO 
THE I. D. IS GOING TO DO THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN THE U. I. D. THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF I MEAN THE FINAL SAY ON WHAT BUTTONS GET PUT WE'LL ALL TALK ABOUT IT 
BUT I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO RIGHT 
I GUESS 
'KAY 
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO SOME PRODUCT EVALUATION 
OKAY AND RIGHT NOW THE I. D. AND U. I. D. YOU TWO ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON A PROTOTYPE USING MODELLING CLAY 
YEAH 
OKAY AND YOU SHOULD ALL BE GETTING AN EMAIL PRETTY SOON 
ALRIGHT 
WELL THANK YOU FOR A VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETING 
JUST TRYING TO MOVE MINE RIGHT NOW 
THEY WANT EVERYTHING BUT SIMPLY 
OKAY 
YEAH THE 
I I CAN 
I CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THAT ISSUE I THINK WITH UH MY PRESENTATION 
OKAY 
MENU WILL ALWAYS READ COPY OF SOMETHING OR THREE 
I I COPIED MINE BEFORE I SENT IT OVER 
HMM 
OKAY MY TURN 
WOAH 
IT'LL BE COPY OF COMPONENT DESIGN 
YEAH 
TH THAT LOOKS LIKE IT 
'KAY 
SO BASIC REMOTE OPERATION RUNS AS FOLLOWS PRESS BUTTON MAKES CONNECTION WITH THE POWER SOURCE AND THE REST OF THE CIRCUIT 
CHIP SENSES THE CONNECTION CHIP PRODUCES A MORSE CODE INFRA RED SIGNAL SPECIFIC TO THAT BUTTON 
SO YOU PRESS THE BUTTON IT PRODUCES UH A SIGNAL THAT'S ENCODED SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT BUTTON 
TRANSISTORS AMPLIFY THAT SIGNAL AND IT GOES TO THE T. V. 'S CENTRE WHICH INTERPRETS THE SIGNAL RESPONSE ACCORDINGLY CHANGES CHANNEL ETCETERA 
SO THAT BEING SAID NEXT SLIDE PLEASE 
FINDINGS UH WHICH WERE THE REQUIRED MATERIALS FOR THE BASIC INTERNAL CONSTRUCTION SO ALL THE REALLY SIMPLISTIC FUNCTIONS THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED WE NEED RUBBER FOR BUTTONS 
ALUMINIUM FOR BATTERY Y CONTACTS INTEGRATED CIRCUIT WHICH CONSISTS OF A DIODE TRANSISTOR 
RESONATOR RESISTORS AND A CAPACITATOR ALL THESE BASIC THINGS THAT MAKE A CIRCUIT FUNCTION 
UM FIBREGLASS AND THEN COPPER WIRE TO CREATE THE ACTUAL CIRCUIT BOARD ITSELF 
NO L. E. D. WHICH IS A LIGHT EMITTING DIODE UM CONTACT DISCS FOR THE BUTTONS 
PLASTIC FOR THE CASING AND A POWER SOURCE WHATEVER POWER SOURCE WE'VE ACTUALLY DETERMINED WE WANT 
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE 
THANK YOU 
UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES UH TO SAVE MONEY FOR THE COMPONENTS THE REMOTE SHOULD BE MASS PRODUCED AND BASIC MATERIALS SHOULD BE BOUGHT EN MASSE 
UM IF WE FIND ANOTHER COMPANY WHO CAN PRODUCE THE REQUIRED CHIPS CASING L. E. D. 
ANY ADDITIONAL MATERIALS WE DECIDE WE REQUIRE AT A LESS EXPENSIVE ROUTE THEN WE OURSELVES ARE PRODUCING WE SHOULD GO FOR IT 
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE 
UM JUST TALKING TO THE M MANUFACTURING DIVISION 
THEY SUGGESTED POWER OPTIONS SOLAR CELLS HAND DYNAMO AND KINETIC POWER SO YOU SHAKE IT AND IT INCREASES THE POWER 
UM I'M NOT SURE HOW THE HAND DYNAMO WORKS THEY HAVE YET TO GET BACK TO ME ON THAT 
SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE 
SUGGESTED CASING OPTIONS 
OKAY 
WE CAN OFFER OPTIONS FOR CASING SUCH AS STRAIGHT CURVED DOUBLE CURVED YOU KNOW VERY SPECIFIC TO THE CUSTOMER 
OPTIONS FOR MATERIALS PLASTIC RUBBER TITANIUM WOOD 
I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S GONNA GO FOR A WOOD ONE BECAUSE SPLINTERS 
YEAH 
UM CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS DO APPLY HERE THOUGH 
UH LATEX YOU CAN'T DO SOLAR POWER WITH A LATEX ONE 
SO IF THEY WANT SOME A SOFT SQUISHY RUBBER THEY CAN'T HAVE THE SOLAR POWERED OPTION 
DOUBLE CURVED YOU CAN'T DO TITANIUM 
UM THAT WOULD BE TWO CURVATURES SO IT WOULD ACTUALLY IF YOU THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND YOU CURVE HERE AND YOU CURVE HERE 
SO YOU COULD HAVE TWO CURVES THAT MATCH THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND TO MAKE IT MORE COMFORTABLE TO HOLD 
NOW IF YOU WANTED THAT YOU CAN'T DO TITANIUM 
AND UH SO YOU FUNCTIONS WHAT FOR THE BUTTONS SCROLLING FUNCTION COULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO USE INSTEAD OF ACTUAL BUTTONS THEMSELVES 
I THINK I HAVE ONE MORE SLIDE 
NO I DIDN'T 
UM THE MANUFACTURING DIVISION ALSO HAS SAID THAT UM THEY HAVE SEVERAL TYPES OF CHIPS AND THEY'VE JUST DEVELOPED A SAMPLE SENSOR OR SAMPLE SPEAKER CHIP 
WHICH WE COULD UTILISE 
UM PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP AND SCROLL REQUIRES MORE COMPLICATED CHIP 
SO DEPENDS ON WHAT WE DECIDE WE WANNA DO 
IN ADDITION TO THAT IF WE'RE OFFERING ALL THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO THE CUSTOMER FOR PRODUCING THEIR REMOTE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MULTIPLES OF EACH TYPE 
LIKE A DOUBLE CURVED IN RUBBER UM YOU KNOW EACH OPTION SHOULD HAVE A CERTAIN SELECT NUMBER PRODUCED WITH ALL THESE OPTIONS 
SO WE'LL HAVE TO MIX IT UP MAKE SURE WE PRODUCE ENOUGH OF EVERYONE 
BUT THAT COULD ALSO DRIVE UP THE PRICE OF THE ACTUAL REMOTE ITSELF IF THEY KNOW THAT WE ONLY PRODUCED FIVE THOUSAND YOU KNOW DOUBLE CURVED WOODEN REMOTES 
AND THAT'S ALL I GOT 
WELL WE ARE MAKING THE CHIP 
SO I MEAN 
BUT I GUESS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT W WHAT OUR PRODUCTION COST IS FOR THE CHIP ITSELF ANYWAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I I THOUGHT OFFERING SOME OF THESE OPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT MATERIALS THAT IT COULD BE MADE OF DIFFERENT 
YOU KNOW I THINK WE'D HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE POWER OPTIONS MAYBE 
SO THAT WE COULD REDUCE COST 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I THINK THE P 
THAT'S TRUE 
IF WE DO A VOICE ACTIVATED LOCATOR THOUGH WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT A MORE SUBSTANTIAL CHIP 
SO 
HONESTLY I THINK THE CUSTOMER WOULD BE KIND OF IRRITATED BY THE FACT THAT IT HAS A BASE IF WE DID DO A NICE SMALL COMPACT 
MM YEAH 
YEAH 
'KAY SO 
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT SO IF YOU FORGOT TO TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR POCKET AND IT GOES IN WASH 
YOU KNOW IT HAPPENS 
I'VE HAD THREE WATCHES GO THAT WAY IT 
PIECES EVERYWHERE 
WELL WE HAVE LOTS OF OPTIONS 
I DON'T THINK WOOD IS A VIABLE OPTION 
HOWEVER WELL WE ONLY WANNA SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO RIGHT 
'CAUSE I WAS THINKING IF WE WANTED TO GET THE HIGH IN MARKET THEN YOU COULD PRODUCE A FEW IN TITANIUM MAKE THEM A RARITY SO TO SPEAK 
YEAH 
WELL THE ORIGINAL 
OKAY 
YEAH 
GOOD PLAN 
HONESTLY I'D RECOMMEND LIKE UM UH SINCE WE'RE GOING WITH BATTERIES INSTEAD OF SOLAR POWER I'D RECOMMEND MAYBE A UH SOFT LIKE LATEX 
BECAUSE WE COULD PRODUCE YOU KNOW HOW CELLPHONES HAVE THOSE OVERLAYS THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR 
WE COULD DO UH IN THAT FITS IN WITH THE TRENDS OF THE YEAR IS BECAUSE THIS YEAR IS ALL FRUIT GOD ONLY KNOWS WHY 
UM WE COULD DO OF A CHERRY COVER FOR THIS YEAR AND THEN I IF NEXT YEAR IS STRIPES OR SOLIDS YOU KNOW 
THEY COULD COME BACK 
AND BY THE EXTRA CASE 
SO WE COULD DO LIKE A B A HARD BASE PLASTIC AND THEN WE COULD GIVE TWO LATEX COVERS TO START 
HOW COMPLICATED ARE WE GONNA GO WITH THE VOICE ACTIVATED 
WELL WE COULD GIVE IT A SPECIFIC CODE YOU KNOW REMOTE MISSING 
YEAH SO THAT WOULD JUST IRRITATE ME 
SO I THINK HAVING A KEY PHRASE IS MUCH BETTER 
NO 
THAT WOULD BE LIKE A MID CLASS UM YEAH 
SO WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO FOR 
WELL IF THEY'VE JUST DEVELOPED THE SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER IT'S A BRAND NEW CHIP 
WHY NOT INTRODUCE IT IN THIS WAY 
I THINK WELL WE COULD DO OR DO TWO ARE WE COULD DO ONE SMALL LITHIUM 
'CAUSE YOU KNOW THE LITHIUM BATTERIES ARE DOING QUITE WELL IN MOST OTHER ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS RIGHT 
SO THEY'RE MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE NOW 
AND THEY ALSO HAVE A LONGER BATTERY LIFE THAN MOST BATTERIES 
BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE TO REPLACE IT EVERY FIVE YEARS 
WELL HOW ABOUT A UNTIL YOU GET ONE BATTERY WHEN YOU BUY IT 'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE WE CAN GET THEM PRETTY CHEAP IN BULK 
YEAH 
IN THE SIMPLE ONES THAT YOU SHOWED US THERE WAS IN THAT HAD THE SCROLL BUTTONS ON THE SIDE 
WHICH I THINK IF WE MAKE IT CURVED LIKE A HAND LIKE A HAND SHAPE LIKE IF WE PUT THE THE SCROLL BUTTON ON THE SIDE THAT COULD BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL 
WELL IF IT'S JUST UP AND DOWN 
VOLUME OR CHANNEL 
I DON'T KNOW 
MM YEAH 
WE SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE IT THAT YOU HAVE TO DEPRESS IT TO ACTIVATE IT THEN 
'CAUSE OTH OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT JUST HOLDING IT AND GOING LIKE THIS YOU KNOW 
OKAY 
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT LOGO ALWAYS STICKS OUT WHEN WE PUT THE LATEX COVERS ON 
SO WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK HAVE A LITTLE SQUARE OR SOMETHING IS THAT THE OUR LOGO'S AVAILABLE 
YEAH I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST BE ICKY 
SO I THINK MAYBE PUTTING IT IN A BUTTON IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA 
FOR OUR BASE ONE 
IT'LL WEAR OFF 
THERE'S NOTHING SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO PUT THE LOGO ON THE FRONT OF THE ACTUAL 
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS WE'RE USING A LATEX OVERLAY SO IT ACTUALLY WOULD GO OVER TOP OF EVERYTHING AND HAVE HOLES FOR THE BUTTONS 
SO I WAS THINKING MAYBE INSTEAD OF DOING THAT WHAT WE COULD DO IS LEAVE A SPACE FOR WHERE THE LOGO SHOULD BE 
YEAH 
GREAT 
PLAY DOH 
WONDERFUL 
OH 
OKAY HANG ON 
SO IF IT'S THERE 
I DON'T KNOW 
HANG ON 
INTERFACE CONCEPTS NO 
EITHER REFRESH IT OR IT SH OH WAIT MAYBE I DIDN'T PUT IT THERE 
HANG ON 
SORRY HANG ON 
DON'T KNOW 
OKAY 
OKAY UM LOOKING AT THE INTERFACE CONCEPT IT'S GONNA BE MOSTLY EXAMPLES OF POSSIBILITIES OF WHERE WE CAN GO WITH THIS 
UH IF YOU WANNA START THE NEXT SLIDE 
UM UH CAN'T REALLY SEE BUT THERE'S TWO POSSIBLE WAYS ON THE R LEFT 
IF YOU SEE IN THE ON THE SIDES OF OF THE REMOTE YOU HAVE THE SORT OF SCROLL DOWN SO YOU HAVE THAT OPTION RIGHT THERE 
AND THEN ALSO THERE'S THE IDEA OF THE BASE 
THAT'S SORT OF LIKE AN IDEA THERE 
AND THEN ON THE RIGHT WE HAVE WHAT'S REALLY BIG TREND RIGHT NOW IT'S THE IPOD 
IT'S BECOMING REALLY AND SO YOU HAVE THESE SORT OF VERY VERY SIMPLISTIC MENU SECTION UH WITH THE ROUND BUTTONS 
AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE THE BOTH KIND OF TRENDY AND HIP BUT ALSO VERY SLEEK AND 
UM AND VERY SIMPLE BUT TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED 
SO IF YOU WANTED TO DO THAT THE IF WE COULD FIND A WAY OF SORT OF LIKE USING THAT IDEA IN A REMOTE CONTROL THEN SORT OF 
LOOK INTO IT BUT ANYWAY NEXT 
UM THERE'S THE IDEA OF LIKE BEING ABLE TO DO IT BY FEEL AS WELL AS BY UM BY SIGHT 
YOU'D YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN THE DARK YOU DON'T WANNA BE LOOKING AT THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THE PICTURE PARTICULARLY IS POINTING OUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP VOLUME BUTTON IT'S A V. 
AND SO YOU YOU'RE KIND OF FEELING A V. LIKE VOLUME UP 
WHAT IT REALLY IS IS A V. AND WHAT IT YOU THINK IT IS IS DOWN BECAUSE THE DOWN ARROW 
AND SO IT'S LIKE A SORT OF A CRITICISM YOU'D PROBABLY TURN THAT O THE OTHER WAY UP 
UM BUT THEN YOU HAVE YOU COULD EITHER DO IT BY RAISED TYPE WHICH COULD BE YOU KNOW IFFY UM SORT OF OLD FASHIONED IN A WAY 
THERE THAT ARE JUST HAVE TO BUY SHAPE FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC TRIANGULAR SHAPE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE UP AND DOWN ARROW 
AND THEN THE ROUND ONES YOU SORT OF FEEL BY YOU KNOW THAT'S THE SECOND ONE DOWN THAT SORT OF THING 
SO IT'S SORT OF LOOKING INTO HOW WE WANTED TO TO DO IT BY FEEL 
OKAY 
UM THIS IS SORT OF AN EXAMPLE OF GOING FOR A S CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC 
UM THIS IS PARTICULARLY GEARED TOWARDS CHILDREN 
UM IT'S VERY CUTE AND WE COULD PROBABLY CHANGE IT IT YELLOW BRIGHT YELLOW FOR LIKE A THE FOR THE COMPANY LOGO 
UM AND YOU HAVE THE SHAPES AND IT'S VERY SIMPLISTIC AND FRIENDLY LOOKING 
UM AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IS JUST TO PRO AB AB YOU PROGRAM CERTAIN 
CHANNELS THAT ONLY THESE CHILDREN WOULD WATCH SO IT'S LIKE THEY CH WATCH YOU KNOW THE C. BEEBIES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UH KEEP THEM AWAY FROM OTHER CHANNELS 
SO THAT'S LIKE ANOTHER OR UM I MEAN THESE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES SORT OF LOOKING AT IT 
YOU HAVE THE WIDER SECTION FOR THE MAIN CONTROLS THERE 
UH YOU COULD SEE HOW MANY BUTTONS THERE ARE 
AND THEN ON THE LEFT YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE ROUND BUTTONS AND A SIMPLER DESIGN 
IN THE BOTTOM WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T NEED THAT BECAUSE IT'S MORE FOR LIKE A D. V. D. FUNCTION WHICH WE ARE NOT GONNA BE USING 
UM 
SO AGAIN IT'S SORT OF LIKE JUST GIVE YOU IDEAS AND THEN DOWN TO THE BOTTOM YOU HAVE THE LEGS AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COULD PUT THE R. R. 
REAL REACTION 
AND THEN FINALLY THESE ARE LIKE THE SORT OF SOME EXAMPLES BUT ALSO SOME MORE JUST POSSIBILITIES THAT WE COULD GO WITH 
NONE OF THEM I'M PARTICULARLY KEEN ON BY THE WAY 
BUT IT'S SORT OF LIKE JUST TAKING ASPECTS OUT OF THAT AND SAYING 
WELL IT IF THIS ONE WE LIKE YOU KNOW THE ROUND SECTION OF UM BE OUR WE'D LIKE THE THE BUTTON SIZE IN THIS 
RIGHT 
THAT'S IT 
RIGHT 
LET ME JUST ADD ONE MORE THING THAT I COULDN'T SAY BEFORE AND THAT'S JUST THAT THERE'S THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY'VE DEVELOPED ON THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
UM 
RIGHT EXCEPT THAT IT'S SORT OF ODD AND I'M NO NOT EXACTLY SURE WHY THEY ARE EXPLAINING IT IN THE WAY THEY ARE 
UM THERE'S A SAMPLE SENSOR AND THERE'S A SAMPLE SPEAKER UNIT FOR US 
YOU WOULD SAY LOOK GOOD MORNING COFFEEMAKER AND IT WOULD RESPOND GOOD MORNING JILL BUT 
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW IT'S GONNA WORK 'CAUSE DO YOU PROGRAMME DO WE PROGRAM THE RESPONSES AND THE QUESTIONS 
SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE USER THEN HAS TO ASK THE SPECIFIC QUESTION AND CAN'T CHANGE IT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE RECOGNISED 
OR CAN TO BE ALTERED IN A CERTAIN WAY OR DOES THE ACTUALLY USER PROGRAM IT TO SAY A CHANNEL MEANS THIS 
RIGHT SO IT'S GOT LIKE A LIMITED MEMORY AND PROGRAMME IT 
SO IT'S SORT OF IFFY BUT THAT'S KIND OF WHAT YOU'D SAY 
I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE FIRST I WANNA KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE BEFORE 'CAUSE IF IT'S SOMETHING REALLY REALLY SMALL 
THEN IT'S SORT OF HARDER TO IMAGINE A BASE FOR IT THAT WAS UP QUITE A S SUBSTANTIAL SIZE SORT OF STANDING UP 
RIGHT 
WELL THE OTHER THING IS LIKE EVEN IF IT'S GOT A FEW BUTTONS SO WE WANT TO TO BE BIGGER THAN THIS 
'CAUSE IT STILL FITS IN YOUR HAND SO YOU STILL WANTED SOMETHING THAT'S COMFORTABLE AND SUBSTANTIAL BUT NOT NECESSARILY FULL OF BUTTONS 
OR YOU GONNA LOSE IT EASIER 
YEAH 
SO I THAT'S THE OTHER THING IT'S LIKE 
YOU KNOW 
ARE WE GONNA HAVE CERTAIN CHIPS THAT ARE GONNA REQUIRE BIGGER SIZE PERIOD 
BUT LIKE YOU KNOW IF WE GOT MORE COMPLICATED THEN IT'S GONNA V BE HAVE TO BE BIGGER IT JUST ACCOMMODATE THE CHIP SIZE 
SO WE SH 
YEAH 
I'M A AWAY FROM 
THE BASE 
YEAH 
SMALLER AND SMALLER YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YOU'RE KIDDING 
OH WATCHES I'VE BUT I'VE NEVER WASHED A CELL PHONE 
WELL TITANIUM IS I WAS SAYING THAT TITANIUM IF WE'RE BEING RESTRICTED THEN 
I WOULD PROBABLY LEAN AWAY FROM THAT 
YEAH 
THAT'LL YEAH EXACTLY 
THE SELLING POINT YEAH 
ARE WE RESTRICTED BY THIS 
TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE WHEN IT LEAVES OUR SALESROOM THEN IT'S ALL GONNA BE CHERRY COLOURED OR IS IT GONNA BE THE KINDA THING WHERE PEOPLE COME BACK AND SWAP IT 
OKAY 
THE WHAT THE TOP FACE RIGHT 
YEAH 
A TRACKER YEAH 
WELL MY LITTLE SISTER GOT FOR CHRISTMAS SHE GOT ONE OF THOSE KEY FINDERS THAT'S LIKE A KEY RING 
AND YOU HAVE TO WHISTLE IN A CERTAIN FREQUENCY FOR IT TO WORK 
AND THEN SHE WOULD LAUGH AND IT WOULD START GOING OFF ON HER PURSE AND YOU COULDN'T TURN IT OFF 
SO IT BECAME HIGHLY IRRITATING 
BUT THEN IT 
HMM 
OKAY 
WELL THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE ENERGY IS INDEED 
AS LONG AS WE SELL IT WITH IT 
RIGHT THAT'S WHAT I MEANT 
WHAT'S IT GONNA YEAH WHAT'S IT GONNA LOOK LIKE 
UM 
WELL MY ISSUE WITH THAT IS F TO GET TOO BIG THOUGH 'CAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE CIRCLE AND THE BUTTON ON THE MIDDLE 
THEN USE IT GONNA GET WIDER THAN YOUR YOUR HANDS ARE BECAUSE WE AND THEN WOULD THE BUTTONS BE TOO SMALL IF IT WAS ENOUGH TO FIT IN IT 
YEAH 
BUT IS THAT FOR WHICH 
DO WE HAVE BOTH SIDES 
WELL THE OTHER OPTION IS ONE INSTEAD OF A SCROLL YOU JUST HAVE THE BUTTONS UP ON THE SIDE WHICH ARE IN THE SIDE 
UM WHAT COLOUR 
WELL I SORT OF LIKE HAVING THE A YELLOW STRIP AT THE BOTTOM WITH THE R. R. LIKE THAT 
AND THAT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF IT 
WHICH BUTTON 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'M JUST REALLY WARY OF THE PUTTING ANYTHING IN A BUTTON 
WHAT'S THE BUTTON WELL WE WE THEN WHAT'S THE BUTTON DO AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS WHAT THE BUTTON DOES 
I GUESS 
JUST LOOKING AT EXAMPLES Y YOU JUST DON'T EVER USE THE LOGO ON A BUTTON IT'S ALWAYS ON THE ACTUAL CASING 
BUT YOU DON'T BUT UH YEAH YOU DON'T USE IT 
WELL HANG ON 
THE OTHER OPTION IS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN USE IT BUT IT'S LIKE IF 
YEAH IT'S LIKE THE SECOND TO LAST SLIDE 
INTERFACE YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
OKAY IT'S THE VERY RIGHT ONE 
YOU SEE AT THE BOTTOM IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO USE BUT YOU HAVE LIKE A D SORT OF S DIVISION BETWEEN THE BOTTOM LIKE 
WHERE THE LOGO IS AND IF WE HAVE THE REPLACEABLE SECTION IT'S LIKE THE TOP 
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REPLACE THE ENTIRE TOP 
AND SO YOU HAVE THAT ONE PIECE THAT STAYS AND THE REST JUST SORT OF CLIPS IN 
IF C YOU ENVISIONING IT 
AND SO THAT STAYS THE SAME WHEN YOU HAVE THE LOGO AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS IS SLIP THAT KINDA CLIPS IN AND THAT'S THE ABOUT THAT CHANGES 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT 
THAT'S LIKE YOU KNOW A A CELLPHONE IT'S LIKE THE THE SCREEN IS ALWAYS JUST LEFT OPENED 
AND SO WHAT WE ARE GONNA DO IT LIKE BRIGHT YELLOW WITH THE R. R. 
YELLOW 
YEAH 
UH THAT ONE 
UM 
OH HANG ON LET ME CATCH UP 
DID WE FINALISE WHAT BUTTONS WE'RE INCLUDING OR WE JUST EVERYTHING THAT WE SAID BEFORE 
YEAH 
FINE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY SO TREND WATCHING 
UH SINCE WE DO PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS IT IS KIND OF IMPORTANT HOW OUR PRODUCT LOOKS 
SO I GUESS WE CAN GO AHEAD AND GO TO THE NEXT 
SO WHAT THEY WANT 
RIGHT NOW CUSTOMERS WANT FANCY VERSUS FUNCTIONAL 
UM BASICALLY ABOUT FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT OF WHAT THEY LOOK OF THE PRODUCT THAT THEY WANT DESCRIBING LIKE THE IN ORDER OF HOW MUCH THEY WANT 
FIFTY EIGHT PER CENT OF THE DECISION OF WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LOOK FANCY VERSUS FUNCTIONAL 
AND THEN IT HAS TO ALSO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE AND YET EASY TO USE 
SO THE CUSTOMER BASICALLY IS CONFUSED 
THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT 
THEY WANT US TO TELL THEM 
YES 
EXACTLY 
SO WE CAN GO TO NEXT 
OKAY 
SO IN MILAN AND PARIS RECENTLY THE TRENDS HAVE BEEN SHOWING THAT CLOTHING SHOES AND FURNITURE ARE BASICALLY JUST COVERED WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLE PATTERNS 
SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO GO WITH THAT UM AND ALSO THE SPONGY FEEL IS IN IN CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR 
I DON'T KNOW REALLY 
I MEAN I GUESS THE SPONGY COULD RELATE TO THE BUTTONS IF WE WANT TO RATHER THAN LIKE A HARD CLICKY BUTTON THAT YOU FIND IN LIKE SOME MOBILES AND STUFF 
YOU'D WANT LIKE A SOFTER TOUCH 
I MEAN DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
YEAH 
UM 
BUT IS FOR THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLE PATTERNS I DON'T KNOW IF WE REALLY WANT TO GO WITH THAT BECAUSE IT IS JUST A TREND 
AND OUR PRODUCT WE WANT TO STAY AROUND FOR MUCH LONGER THAN JUST A FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YEAH 
I MEAN THAT COULD JUST BE A SPRING THING RIGHT NOW 
OKAY 
AWESOME 
UM SO DESIGN PREFERENCES UM WE NEED EASY TO READ LIKE LARGE BUTTONS CLEARLY LABELLED SO THAT I MEAN 'CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT THAT BEING A PROBLEM 
UM AND THEN ALSO BUTTONS ILLUMINATING UPON TOUCH YOU SAID THAT IN YOUR DESIGN WITH THE BULB 
UM AND THAT COULD LOSE IT IN WITH THE COLOUR SCHEME 
UH WE NEED THE REAL REACTION LOGO AND COLOUR SCHEME OBVIOUSLY 
THAT'S ONE OF OUR KEY GOALS WE WANNA PROMOTE OUR PRODUCT 
AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF DESIGNS AND I CAME UP WITH SOMETHING 
ACTUALLY RIGHT HERE 
SO WHAT WE COULD DO IS SOMETHING LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED TELEPHONE LIKE THIS 
WHERE WE PUT THE BUTTONS AROUND LIKE WE'D PUT A BIG ON OFF BUTTON OR SOMETHING ELSE IN THE MIDDLE 
I MEAN IT COULD BE THE ARROWS OR WHATEVER FOR CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AND THEN PUT THE NUMBERS AROUND IN LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED DIAL SHAPE 
'CAUSE THEN IT'LL APPEAL TO OLDER GENERATION AND LIKE SAID RETRO'S COOL 
SO IT'S CLASSICALLY RETRO 
SO I MEAN THAT'S JUST AN IDEA OF YOU GUYS LIKE IT 
AND YEP 
AND THAT'S IT 
THAT'S CUTE 
YEAH 
I HAVE FOUR OF THOSE REMOTES 
OKAY 
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING THOUGH YEAH 
NO SPLINTERS WOULD 
WHAT IS THAT 
MM 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
UH THIS THE THING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER 
YEAH LIKE USING THE MENU TO BE LIKE ENTER YOUR NAME INTO THE SCREEN LIKE IN THE MENU OPTIONS 
SO THAT WAY THE REMOTE READS IT 
I FEEL LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD BE 
I DON'T KNOW W IT WOULD BE TOO HARD TO REALLY I MEAN WE COULD DO IT BUT 
TECHNOLOGY 
AND IT IS A GROWING TREND THE HIGHER TECHNOLOGICAL LIKE 
TH I MEAN JUST LIKE THE MORE ADVANCED IT IS 
THE BETTER IT'LL SELL 
YEAH 'CAUSE WE NEED TO KNOW HOW BIG IT'S GONNA BE AND HOW HEAVY 
UH THE BASE YEAH 
WE 
WE NEED TO DECIDE WELL SO WE CAN FIGURE HOW BIG IT'S GONNA BE LIKE EXACTLY WHAT BUTTONS WE WANT AND EXACTLY 
IT COULD BE LIKE THIS 
YES 
I'D WELL UH 
THIS ONE IS REALLY COMFORTABLE LIKE I LIKE THE SIDES WHATEVER BECAUSE 
BUT IF WE HAVE THE UM THE LOCATOR THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT 
SO WE CAN MAKE IT SMALL IF WE HAVE A L LOCATING DEVICE 
HMM 
TWO DOUBLE A. S 
FOR THIS SIZE 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
SMALLER WITHOUT YEAH 
I THINK IF WE HAD A A LOCATING DEVICE WITH THE SMALL ONE I THINK THAT SEEMS WAY MORE ADVANCED 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE I MEAN IF EVEN LOOKING AT CELLPHONES RIGHT NOW THOSE TRENDS THE SMALLER THE HOTTER IT IS YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
OUCH 
A PHONE WHOA THAT WOULD WOW THAT WOULD HURT 
YEAH WOOD 
YEAH 'CAUSE IF IT'S GONNA COST IS MORE TO PRODUCE A CHIP TITANIUM WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE 
YEAH 
WE COULD DO THAT BECAUSE ALL OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PEOPLE ARE DEFINITELY WILLING TO SPEND MORE OF 
GOOD PLAN 
OH 
YEAH WHO KNOWS 
O OR WE COULD LIKE TAKE OFF THIS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE THE SOFT LATEX DEFINITELY IS SQUISHY 
THAT'S ONE 
WELL I MEAN SQUISHIER THAN LIKE YEAH JUST A HARD PLASTIC 
'CAUSE THAT UH WHAT TO TYPE OF YEAH FOR VOICE ACTIVATION WOULD TO BE LIKE A CERTAIN TERM WHAT WE WOULD SAY LIKE 
BECAUSE PEOPLE COULD JUST BE TALKING AND WE DON'T WANT IT GOING OFF ALL THE TIME 
SO UH 
OH 
UH SO I'M UH I'M STRANGELY ATTRACTED TO IT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE BIG 
BECAUSE IT'S I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST SO HIGH TECH 
UH THEN MAYBE VOICE 
MAYBE VOICE ACTIVATION WON'T BE GOOD 
YEAH NO NO NO WE JUST WANT TO TO BE A FINDER 
BUT DO CAN YOUR CON THE DEPARTMENT MAKE 
OH BRILLIANT THEN 
YEAH GOOD POINT 
I THINK TRIPLE A. IT'LL BE LIGHTER 
I MEAN MORE MORE COME IN A PACKAGE 
YEAH 
THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
WE COULD THINK ABOUT IT AND COME BACK TO TO NEXT MEETING 
WE STILL HAVE ONE MORE MEETING 
YEAH IT COULD BE WHATEVER AS LONG AS THERE'S SOMETHING BIG IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE LIKE THE OLD PHONES 
THERE'S LIKE THAT JUST LIKE PIECE OF METAL OR LIKE A PICTURE OR SOMETHING ON THE MIDDLE 
OH THAT'S TRUE 
GOOD POINT 
SO SCROLL BUTTONS ON THE SIDE AND THEN BUTTONS ON TOP 
BUT WE DEFINITELY IF WE HAVE SCROLL THINGS IN THE SIDE WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO HAVE 'EM LABELLED 
YEAH LIKE IN THE SIDE OF IT 
UH IF IT'S JUST UP AND DOWN 
WELL YOU COULD DO SOME ON BOTH SIDES 
YEAH 
THAT'S SQUISHY 
THAT'S SQUISHY 
HAVE BUTTONS 
YEAH THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH OR LIKE A GUN METAL GREY 'CAUSE THEN IT COMBINES THE SILVER AND THE BLACK 
YEAH BUTTONS WEAR OFF 
HMM 
BUT WE WANT TO TO BE SEEN 
WE NEED TO TO BE SEEN 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
SOME OF THE 
WELL SOME OF THESE BUTTONS THOUGH OR BLUE BASED 
UM WELL A LOT OF THESE BUTTONS OR BLUE BASED 
WELL KIND OF 
UM AND THEN IF V WE DO HAVE THEM ILLUMINATE UPON CONTACT THEY COULD ILLUMINATE YELLOW 
LIKE IF WE LIKE THE IN ALL THE WAY IN THE LEFT UH YOU C YOU CAN USE IT IN YOUR COMPUTER BETTER 
UM WHERE THE BUTTON IS ACTUALLY BLUE BUT THE NUMBER ITSELF IS CLEAR OR WHITE OR WHATEVER SO IF YOU PRESSED IT WOULD ILLUMINATE YELLOW 
SO WE'D HAVE BLUE AND YELLOW FOR THE TOUCH BUTTONS 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
UM IT 
OKAY 
UM HERE'S THE AGENDA FOR OUR LAST MEETING 
UM AFTER THE OPENING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION THEN WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS THE EVALUATION CRITERIA AND THE FINANCING OF OUR REMOTE 
THEN WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE THE PRODUCT AND I THINK THE WHOLE PRODUCTION PROCESS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA CLOSE IT UP AND WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES SO 
LET'S GET STARTED 
OH NO LET'S HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION 
RIGHT 
HMM 
YEAH 
GREAT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
AND DID YOU DETERMINE UM THE CURVATURE OF THE BOTTOM PART OF IT FOR THE HAND SO IT GONNA BE A SINGLE OR A DOUBLE 
SINGLE 
SINGLE SOUNDS GOOD 'CAUSE IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH TO REALLY CONSTITUTE A DOUBLE 
GREAT 
GREAT 
I THINK YOU ADD AN AWESOME JOB 
IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND IT'S EVERYTHING THAT WE DISCUSSED 
GOOD JOB 
ALRIGHT WHAT'S NEXT IN OUR AGENDA 
UM WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS THE EVALUATION CRITERIA AND THAT'S WITH COURTNEY 
RIGHT 
MM 
RIGHT 
SQI 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
'KAY 
I'LL WAIT 
ARE WE GOING TO AND I SAY WE INDIVIDUALLY RATE WHAT DO YOU SAY 
JUST REALLY 
WHY NOT 
WE HAVE OKAY 
UM EASY TO USE 
I VOTE SIX 
UH TWO 
UH HELLO WE'RE GREAT 
UM ONE 
NO 
UM IT VERY CHIC 
NO I GIVE IT A ONE 
UH AND UM IT'S A PROTOTYPE RIGHT 
WELL NOW I'M 
SO THE AVERAGE IS ABOUT A TWO 
TWO OR THREE 
TWO POINT FIVE 
IMAGINE SINCE WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THAT 
AND IT'S I IT IS VERY ERGONOMICALLY DESIGNED 
IT'S GONNA BE CURVED 
YEAH 
I THINK SO IT 
'KAY 
TWO 
ALRIGHT AVERAGE IS TWO 
SO IT TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
OH SORRY I'M TAKING OVER YOUR JOB HERE 
GO RIGHT AHEAD 
YES 
RIGHT 
WE WERE ABLE TO DO IT WITH THAT KIND OF CHIP 
YEAH RIGHT 
THAT WAS 'KAY 
AND WE DISCUSSED THAT BEING INCLUDED 
WELL WE DON' HAVE THE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T SAY CHANNEL AND IT CHANGES THE CHANNEL CHANNEL EIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I'D GO FOR A THREE OR FOR ONE THAT ONE IS OKAY LET'S GO FOR A THREE POINT FIVE 
ALRIGHT AND THE LAST CRITERIA IS IT IS IT UM 
WELL WE'VE COVERED THAT WITH THE TRENDY 
SURE 
CAPABLE 
VERY CAPABLE 
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
'KAY THERE WE GO 
SO 
NEXT 
IT DOES 
VERY GOOD 
ALRIGHT LET'S GO BACK TO THIS 
NO THAT'S IT 
HMM 
OOPS 
OKAY SO NOW UH WE'RE MOVING ON TO FINANCE OKAY 
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET AND WE'RE GOING TO FILL IT IN TOGETHER BASED ON WHAT COMPONENTS WE'RE INCLUDING IN OUR REMOTE AND SO IF IT'S UNDER TWELVE FIFTY EURO 
IF SO WE CAN PROCEED IF NOT WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD A LITTLE BIT 
'KAY 
SO LET ME BRING THAT UP 
HERE WE GO 
ALRIGHT 
UM IT'S NOT HAND DYNAMO IT'S POWERED BY BATTERY SO WE GIVE IT A 
NUMBER OF COMPONENTS YOU PLAN TO USE 
DO I JUST PUT QUANTITY BEING ONE BATTERY OR 
YEAH 
BUT IF IT'S A DO YOU WANNA GO FOR THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE A FINAL CALL ON IF IT'S A LITHIUM OR DO WE WANNA GO TRIPLE A. S 
'CAUSE TRIPLE A. IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO MORE THAN ONE BATTERY 
UH LET'S JUST GO FOR A LITHIUM 
WHAT DO YOU SAY 
I THINK UH I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO PURCHASE THIS ARE GONNA BE TECHNOLOGICALLY RIGHT 
OKAY DOWN TO THE ELECTRONICS UM SECTION 
WE'RE GONNA NEED THOSE KIND CORRECT IF WE DO THE VOICE SENSOR IS ONE OF THIS 
IT IS A SINGLE CURVED IS ONE OF THIS 
OH 
WHAT'S THAT 
YEAH THAT'S CORRECT 
'KAY DOWN HERE CASE MATERIAL 
PLASTIC 
'KAY 
DOWN HERE INTERFACE TYPE 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE INTEGRATED SCROLL SCROLL WHEEL 
ISN'T UH THESE ARE JUST REGULAR BUTTONS 
THIS 
OKAY SO WE CAN JUST GO UM 
RIGHT I THINK SHE'S I THINK WHAT COURTNEY'S TALKING ABOUT SO DO WE NEED TO PUT TWO HERE 
RIGHT 
I DON'T KNOW THEY MIGHT PUT AS WELL LET'S JUST 
TWO OR WOULD TO BE THERE 
OKAY AND WE'RE GONNA BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS THE BUTTONS ARE IN UH OKAY 
ARE THEY 
OH RIGHT 
MM 
WELL WE'RE UNDER COST THEN 
ALRIGHT 
NO WE'RE UNDER 
TWELVE POINT FIVE IS OUR LIMIT 
WE'VE GOT ELEVEN POINT TWO 
ALRIGHT 
WE CAN GO TO 
I DUNNO WHAT I JUST ADD 
OKAY 
NOW WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT PROCESS UM AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE SATISFIED WITH THE WHOLE PROCESS AND THE RESULT 
UM DID WE HAVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 
DID WE HAVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP UM TEAMWORK AND THE MENUS 
MEANING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE USED TO PRODUCE OUR LITTLE GUY THERE AND IF WE FOUND ANY NEW IDEAS 
NOW QUESTION IS HOW DO WE DO THIS 
DISCUSS SURE 
ALRIGHT 
WHO WANT WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST 
HMM 
HMM 
AND HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WHOLE THE WHOLE PROCESS THOUGH 
RIGHT AND WE GOT SAY OVER 
WHAT HOW TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED IT SHOULD BE AND ALSO HOW FASHIONABLE WHICH I KIND OF LIKE WE YEP 
YOU KNOW IT 
UM WHAT ABOUT UM THE TEAMWORK ASPECT 
HOW DID YOU GUYS ENJOY MAKING THE MODEL THE PROTOTYPE 
I THINK YA' DID 
DID YOU WORK WELL TOGETHER IN THERE AND 'KAY 
OH MY GOD AND WE'VE ALL BEEN A PRETTY CONGENIAL TEAM HERE I THINK 
WE HADN'T HAD ANY MA FALLINGS OUT 
IRRITATING 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I HAVE TO KNOCK THAT ONE DOWN A COUPLE NOTCHES 
YEAH DIGITAL PENS 
THEY WERE FINE 
RIGHT LAPTOPS ARE EXTREMELY HANDY WIRELESS 
AND THAT WE HAVE A SHARED NETWORK WHERE WE CAN PUT ALL OF THE 
BIG BROTHER 
'KAY HAVE WE FOUND ANY NEW IDEAS THROUGH THIS PROCESS 
FOR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS COOL AND ALSO HAS WHAT I WANT TO TO BE DO TECHNOLOGICALLY 
AND THAT'S YOUR RIGHT BRAIN TAKING OVER W WANTING THE ARTISTIC THE FASHIONABLE THE HOPE YOU KNOW 
IF WE ALL JUST WANT IT AND BOUGHT USEFUL THINGS I DON'T THINK I MEAN THAT'S NOT WHAT TECHNOLOGY 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
JUST THE MAC FONT BOTHERS ME EVEN 
BUT I DO LIKE IPODS GO FIGURE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
COLOURS 
EXACTLY 
I MEAN HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT IT AND BOUGH A NOKIA PHONE BACK WHEN WE WERE LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL 
JUST SO THEY COULD GET THE CHANGEABLE FACE PLATES 
OKAY 
ANYWAY SO THAT IS DEFINITELY TO WORK 
YEAH 
FASHIONABLE CHIC PEOPLE WILL 
HMM 
THERE YOU GO MARKETING 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY WE'RE GONNA WRAP THIS UP NOW 
UM THE COSTS ARE WITHIN THE BUDGET WE EVALUATED THE PROJECT AND NOW WE'RE GONNA COMPLETE THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG GIANT PARTY APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO THIS IS 
ALRIGHT THANK YOU TIME YOU ADD A GREAT JOB IT WAS LOVELY WORKING WITH YOU 
MM 'KAY YOU READY 
YOU YOU READ THAT STUFF SINCE YOU WRITE IT 
I'LL BE THE VANNA 
NO 
THEY'RE JUST BUTTONS 
ON OFF SWITCH WILL BE HERE AND SO YOU'VE NOTICED ON OUR PROTOTYPE UM THEY'VE ENDED UP WITH A CURVATURE KIND OF 
BY CONCAVE SORT OF THING EXCEPT FOR YOU KNOW CAN'T SEE UNDERNEATH 
SO I'M HOPING THAT WHEN WE GET TO PRODUCTION WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THEM LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY 
NICE TO STICK YOU KNOW STICK YOUR FINGER IN 
UM THE TWO SQUARED BUTTONS OR OR TWO PROBABLY LEAST USED MENU 
MUTE AND THEN THESE ARE THE NUMBERS IS OUR CHANNEL AND OR VOLUME WILL BE IN OTHER SIDE 
I'D SAY A SINGLE 
YEAH IT'S ONLY ACTUALLY THE SIZE OF MY HAND 
WHOOHOO 
YEAH IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO INCORPORATE THE COVER WITH THE CHERRY FRUIT ON IT 
YES 
I'D SAY TWO AS WELL 
AT THE MOMENT NO 
OKAY 
I'LL GIVE IT A TWO BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT LIKING THAT WAY 
NEITHER ARE ALL O ALL THE CUSTOMERS WE HAVE THREE 
UH THE SHAPE OF IT ACTUALLY DOES UH 
I'D SAY A TWO 
WE COULD DO IT WITH THE CHIP YES 
IT WASN'T WE HAVE NO REFLECTION OF IT IN THE PROTOTYPE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TWO DIMENSIONS REALLY 
IT 
YEAH 
THERE AND IN HALF 
IT'S CAPABLE OF BEING SQUISHY AND FRUITY 
HOW DID YOU GET THAT IN THERE 
THE SLIGHTLY RESEMBLING A GIANT DELICIOUS COOKIE 
THAT WAS GOOD 
YEP 
MM 'KAY 
YEAH IT'S 
YEP 
WELL THAT'S THE PUSH BUTTON IT RIGHT THERE 
INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL OR PUSH BUTTON 
WE'RE REALLY HAVING JUST PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE 
BUT IT THAT JUST COVERS THE TYPE OF BUTTON WE'RE HAVING 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING A SCROLL ON THE SIDE IT'S STILL PUSH BUTTON 
PUSH BUTTON 
BUT WE JUST HAVE PUSH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
LET'S CALL IT THE 
OKAY 
GRAND 
SO WE CAN GO TO PRODUCTION 
GO BACK 
PREVIOUS 
WE THINK WE GOT STIFLED FOR CRI CREATIVITY BY THE COMPANY ITSELF IN RESTRICTING US ONLY TO USING A T. V. REMOTE INITIALLY 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
WELL IN THERE WAS THERE WAS SCRATCHING AND FIGHTING BUT NO 
IRRITATING 
THE MEANS THE WHITEBOARD DIDN'T WORK 
A AND OUR FRIEND HERE REALLY FEELS STRONGLY ABOUT THE INTERNET 
I REALLY APPRECIATED THOSE YEAH 
THE EASE OF THE LAPTOPS FOR RECEIVING EVERYTHING 
IT WAS WIRELESS TO USE 
AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE SEXY DUAL MICROPHONES EVERYONE GETS IT WERE 
THE TORONTO DISTRICT SCHOOL WOULD ONLY USE HIS MACS WITH THEIR KIDS 
WELL I IPODS ARE NOW QUITE TRENDY AND THEY COME IN DIFFERENT COLOURS 
YEAH 
NOT UM 
I DIDN'T HAVE A PHONE 'TIL UNIVERSITY 
THAT'S OKAY 
WE CAN CREATE A COMMERCIAL WHERE THEY THINK THAT ALL THEIR NEEDS WILL BE MUTE 
THIS WILL HELP THEM FIND THE ONE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
AND SO THE SERPENT SAYS IS OUR REMOTE 
WHOOHOO 
MARGARITAS FOR EVERYONE 
YAY 
THANKS TO THE PROJECT LEADER 
NOW WE KNOW W 
UM USER 
YOU ARE UM 
OKAY 
WELL SINCE OUR MATERIALS AREN'T EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE GOING FOR I'M JUST GONNA TRANSLATE WHAT THIS ALL MEANS FOR YOU 
THE BASE IS GONNA BE GUNMETAL GRAY WHICH IS WHAT WE HAD DECIDED AND IT'S GONNA BE PLASTIC 
UM THEN THERE'S THE LATEX COVER WHICH IS WHAT YOU USE AS READ 
UM BECAUSE IT CAN BE REPLACEABLE WE JUST KINDA WENT WITH THE COLOUR 
UM AND THEN THE BUTTONS ARE ACTUALLY KIND OF POKING THROUGH RATHER THAN ON TOP 
UM AND THE BUTTONS WILL BE A L MUCH LIGHTER BLUE ALMOST SEE THROUGH 
IT'S JUST SORT OF A VERY PALE BLUE AND A LIGHT UP YELLOW 
THE WHOLE THING LIGHTS UP IF YOU PRESS ANY BUTTON RATHER THAN IT JUST THAT ONE BUTTON WILL LIGHT UP 
UM AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM WE HAVE OUR LOGO 
UM BRIGHT YELLOW SORT OF DESIGN WITH THE R. R. WHICH WILL ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE OUR LOGO 
AND THEN ON THE SIDE YOU HAVE THE BUTTONS 
THEY'RE ONE BUTTON BUT THEY KIND OF PUSH UP AND DOWN 
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE SCROLLING 
RIGHT YEAH 
AND THEN YEAH THE BUTTONS 
THUMB SHAPED 
YEAH 
AND THEN THE LAST THING IS JUST THAT IT'LL BE BLACK LABELLING ON TOP JUST WHICH WE DIDN'T DO 
SINGLE 
RIGHT 
OH THANK YOU 
FEEL GOOD MEANING WHAT 
PHYSICALLY OKAY 
YEAH 
TRUE OR FALSE EASY TO USE 
YEAH 
YEAH TWO 
MM I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT FASHIONABLE 
I'D GIVE IT LIKE THREE OR FOUR 
BUT THEN I'M NOT FASHIONABLE SO 
DON'T USE MY OPINION 
DOES IT FEEL GOOD 
YEAH IT'S GONNA BE THICKER 
DEPTH 
I'LL GIVE IT A ONE 
OH RIGHT THE 
RIGHT 
YEAH I GO FOR 
SQUISHY AND FRUITY 
IT'S JUST TRENDY BASICALLY 
OKAY 
IT'S PLASTIC 
AND SPECIAL COLOUR 
NO WE DON'T HAVE THE SCROLL 
BUTTONS 
UH LIKE THE TWENTY NINE MEANS LIKE YOU HAVE BOTH SCROLLS AND 
PUSH BUTTONS 
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SCROLLS 
TWO INTERFACES IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD WE S SAY 
OKAY FINE 
YEAH 
AND THEN SO YEAH 
WE'RE OVER 
OKAY 
UH I SEE 
WE DIDN'T HAVE A WHITEBOARD 
YEAH 
AND IN INTERNET 
I THINK WE DID WELL 
YEP 
GOUGES 
IRRITATING 
AND IN INTERNET 
MISSUS 
I D 
THERE'S SO MUCH AVAILABLE 
LIKE IT'S INFORMATION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL THAT'S WHY I DON'T LIKE UH MACS OR APPLES JUST 'CAUSE I LIKE IT IT AND I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY A VERY GOOD COMPUTER 
BUT I LIKE IT IT AND I'M TAKEN BACK TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 'CAUSE THEY LIKE THE SAME 
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY DID WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THAT'S SO OLD FASHIONED TO ME 
EXACTLY SO I ASSOCIATE THEM WITH LIKE REALLY LOW TECH REALLY CHEAP BAD 
YEAH 
BUT THE MY BUT MY AN ISSUE IS JUST LIKE THE WHOLE IT'S FOR T. V. ONLY 
I WAS LIKE WHO'S GONNA BUY A REMOTE JUST FOR THE T. V. UNLESS THEY'VE LOST THEIRS 
YOU'RE KIDDING 
NO NO 
NO MARKETING HAS TO ACTUALLY CREATE THE DESIRE FOR IT 
OR THEY'LL BE SEXY WITH IT 
OH RIGHT 
LET YOU ALSO 
YEAH NO 
GOOD 
I WANNA FIND OUR OF OUR REMOTE WORKS 
OH 
WHOOHOO 
THAT'S NICE 
GOOD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK IT'S A BEAUTIFUL 
YEAH 
GOOD JOB YOU GUYS 
THESE ARE REALLY GOOD 
OKAY IT'S A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD UH TALK ABOUT 
IT'S UNDER EVALUATION 
ALRIGHT 
UM SO THESE ARE THE CRITERIA WE'RE GONNA ASK IS IT EASY TO USE 
SO IT FASHIONABLE UH YEAH I GUESS WE SHOULD WRITE THIS DOWN SO WE CAN REFERENCE THEM 
LIKE DOES IT FEEL GOOD LIKE YEAH PHYSICALLY 
THAT'S JUST FOR CURRENT TREND 
IT DOESN'T REALLY COUNT YOU GUYS

YEAH WELL THEN THAT'S COVERED 
AND SO WE N K EVERYBODY HAVE THAT 
YEAH SHE'S GOT IT

AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN REPRESENT IT IN HERE 
YOU 
YEAH SO 
THEN YES THEN I WOULD WELL IT ISN'T WHAT ELSE WOULD IT AND FOR IT TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
AND IT DOESN'T COVER ANYTHING OTHER THAN T. V. SO I'D PROBABLY GIVE IT A THREE 
EVEN THOUGH IT AS FAR JUST A T. V. REMOTE IT'S UH VERY ADVANCED 
BUT IT IS JUST A T. V. REMOTE 
WELL YEAH SO I'D GIVE IT A TWO 
UH IT'S VERY CAPABLE OF BEING SQUISHY AND FRUITY 
YEAH 
OKAY NEXT 
SO UM OUR OUR MODEL SLIGHTLY RESEMBLING A GIANT DELICIOUS COOKIE APPEARS TO BE A WINNER AND UH HOPEFULLY WE'LL SELL MILLIONS 
GOOD JOB TEAM 
WHAT 
IT IT DOES 
THANKS 
TWO 
YEAH 
YEAH LET'S LET'S DO A LITHIUM 
WE'RE GON THAT'S AGAIN 
NOLOGICALLY ADVANCED YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
WE PLASTIC 
AND SPECIAL COLOUR 
BUT IT'S 
YEAH BUT I SEE I 
BUT WELL WE WE ACTUALLY WE'LL NEED TWO WON'T WE 
NO FOR THE TOP AND THEN ONE FOR THE USE AN E FOR EACH SIDE 
OKAY 
LIKE BECAUSE THERE'S LIKE AN INTERFACE RIGHT HERE AND THEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE IN THE SAME PLANE WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTON 
THERE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE ADDITIONAL SIGNALS ON THE SIDES 
SO SO THAT GONNA BE AN EXTRA IN IN EACH SIDE 
OR THREE BECAUSE OF IN IN EACH SIDE AND ON ON TOP 
I MEAN IT'S FINE 'CAUSE IT COMES TO THE SAME AS TWENTY NINE 
WELL LESS THAN TWENTY NINE EVEN 
THEY'RE A SPECIAL COLOUR 
UM THEY'RE UH THEY'RE A SPECIAL FORM 'CAUSE THEY'RE INDENTED 
AND THEY'RE A SPECIAL MATERIAL 
WE'RE UNDER 
I THINK WE JUST DISCUSS IT 
OH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
NO YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
'CAUSE I'D FORGOTTEN THAT THAT WASN'T OUR DECISION YEAH 
OH OVERALL I MEAN I THOUGHT WE DID A GOOD JOB LIKE 
WE GET TO CHOOSE BASICALLY WE HAD CONTROL OVER MINUS IT BEING JUST MERELY A T. V. REMOTE WE GET TO CHOOSE WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WITH IT 
AND WE'RE A FASHION FORWARD TECHNOLOGY COMPANY 
MEANS THAT ONE FIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I MEAN MEANS YOU GUYS BEING WHA WHAT IS TO THE SURVEY ANNOYING OR WHAT IS IT 
IRRITATING YEAH 
WOW THAT'S A IT'S DEFINITELY A STRONG ONE 
YEAH 
YEAH AND IN INTERNET 
AND THE DIGITAL THE DIGITAL PENS WERE THEY WERE PRETTY COOL 
YEAH THEY WERE FUN EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I COULD DO WITH THEM BUT THEY ARE AWESOME 
YEAH 
AND THESE THINGS WHOA 
YEAH 
AND BIG BROTHER 
YEAH 
UM WE ARE REALLY GONNA SELL THIS 
TO DO 
MM-HMM

OH YEAH 
YEAH NO IPODS THEY WANT ALL THOSE WORDS FOR PRESENTATION EVEN THE PLUGS 
OH YEAH EVERYBODY 
MINE IS AMBER 
OH

THAT IS A PIECE OF WORK 
WOW 
MARKETING DIRECTOR SAYS YEAH 
FASHIONABLE PEOPLE WILL BUY IT 
UH I WILL CREATE DESIRE 
WE COULD HAVE LIKE AN ADAM AND EVE TYPE COMMERCIAL AND THAT'S THE FIG LEAF 
MM 
THAT'LL SELL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU IT 
UH I'M KATIE I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND I'LL JUST BE I GUESS PRESENTING ABOUT THE THE INTER WORKINGS OF OUR LITTLE REMOTE CONTROL AND UH YEAH 
OOH 'S HORSES NO PARTICULAR REASON WHY 
UM 
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS IT'LL ACTUALLY PICK UP THE SIGNALS FROM KIND OF ANYWHERE AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LIKE CONTORT YOURSELF AND TWIST YOUR REMOTE CONTROL TO GET TO THE T. V. TO ACTUALLY PICK UP THE SIGNAL 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
MM 
MM 
MM 
UH I THINK IT'S IT'S REMOTE CONTROLS ARE KIND OF A UNIQUE OBJECT 'CAUSE IT'S YOU DEPEND ON THEM AS MUCH 
BUT YOU DON'T I I IT'S YOU SORT OF JUST ASSUME THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA WORK 
YOU DON'T THINK OF THEM AS A COMP LIKE A COMPUTER CAN BREAK DOWN AND YOU'RE KINDA LIKE UH WELL FAIR ENOUGH THERE'S ALL THESE COMPLEX THINGS GOING ON 
IT'S GONNA SOMETHING'S GONNA GET MESSED UP EVENTUALLY 
THEY THEY JUST NEED TO BE VERY VERY DEPENDABLE BECAUSE PEOPLE SORT OF TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED AND THEN IF YOUR REMOTE CONTROL BREAKS IT'S 
GOD FORBID YOU ACTUALLY GET UP AND MANUALLY CHANGE THE CHANNEL TO JUST IT NEEDS TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE VERY ALWAYS DEPENDABLE 
UH I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT TOO SMALL I 'CAUSE I THINK IT NEEDS TO IT CAN'T BE TOO BIG LIKE YOU WERE SAYING BIG ONE AND HUGE AND UM AWKWARD 
BUT ALSO IF YOU MAKE IT TOO SMALL KINDA LIKE YOU KNOW HOW MOBILE PHONES ARE GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER UM 
IT'S JUST GONNA END UP UNDER A COUCH CUSHION SOMEWHERE AND UM YEAH 
BUT IS YES DEPENDABLE AND HAVE A GOOD MEDIUM RANGE SIZE 
MM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
WELL YOU COULD COME UP WITH LIKE NOVELTY ONES LIKE THEY'VE DONE WITH THE THE MOBILE PHONES 
YOU CAN GET LIKE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW SCENES FROM DIFFERENT MOVIES AND STUFF ON THE REMOTE CONTROL AND SORTA STAGGER THE RELEASE OF THEM AND GET PEOPLE LIKE UH I WANT THAT COVER ON IT NOW AND THAT'LL KEEP THEM SPENDING MONEY 
THANK YOU 
I'M KENDRA AND I'M THE US USER INTERFACE DESIGNER AND UM I HAVEN'T HAD A WHOLE LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS KIND OF THING BEFORE BUT I'M UM SO I'LL BE 
WORKING ON THE DESIGN 
RIGHT 
YEP I'M JUST OPEN IT BEING CREATIVE 
UM PROBABLY A DUCK I JUST I LI I LIKE THE WAY THEY LOOK AND THEY'RE JUST NICE ANIMALS AND I LIKE HOW THEY CAN FLY OR SWIM OR WALK AROUND OR WHATEVER 
WELL I THINK I FIND A LOT OF THEM REALLY COMPLICATED TO USE WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT BUTTONS AND UH IT'S HANDIEST WHEN YOU HAVE ONE THAT WORKS BOTH THE D. V. D. PLAYER OR WHATEVER AND THE T. V. AS WELL 
UM 
BUT THAT IT'S EASY TO IF YOU CAN SWITCH BACK AND FORTH INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PRESS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS AND SO I THINK IT'S IS BEST WHEN THEY'RE CLEARLY LABELLED AND YOU CAN SEE WHICH BUTTONS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE 
YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
I THINK SOMETHING THAT'S COMFORTABLE TO HOLD BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU GET THE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE JUST THIS BIG 
RECTANGULAR THINGS AND UH THEY'RE KIND OF AWKWARD TO HOLD ONTO IS SOMETHING THAT'S MORE COMFORTABLE THAT FITS IN A PERSON'S HAND BETTER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT MAYBE THEY COULD BE CONCAVE INSTEAD OF STICKING UP TO HAVE THEM BE KIND OF DOWN SO YOU COULD FEEL THEM 
BETTER 
OH YEAH 
LIKE A LIKE A MOBILE PHONE 
YEAH 
WELL MOST I THINK MOST OF THE REMOTE CONTROLS NOW OR THREE JUST BLACK OR GREY 
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD GO WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT OR BE ABLE TO I WAS JUST THINKING OF UM WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH MOBILE PHONES NOW HOW YOU CAN GET THE DIFFERENT UM WHAT ARE THEY CALLED 
LIKE THE FACE PLATES THAT YOU CHANGE SO WE COULD HAVE MAYBE I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT 
WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE THE FACE PLATES OR HAVE KIND OF A VARIETY SO PEOPLE CAN GET DIFFERENT DIFFERENT THINGS 
HAVE TO KIND OF LIKE HOW THEY WANT TO DIFFERENT COLOURS THINGS LIKE THAT PROBABLY JUST PLASTIC BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS THE LIGHTEST 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
RIGHT W WELCOME TO THE THE FIRST MEETING OF UH REAL REACTION'S UH UM DEVELOPMENT MEETINGS FOR OUR OUR NEW TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL 
UH THIS FOLLOWS OUR VERY SUCCESSFUL ENTRY INTO THE THE CONSUMER MARKET OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO UM WHICH WE WANT TO TO BUILD IN 
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE UH THE THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE UH THE LATEST UH UH FEELINGS IN IN CONSUMER DESIGN AND AND DEMAND AND UH WE WANT TO MAKE THIS THE THE VERY BEST PRODUCT TH THAT'S POSSIBLE FOR EVERYBODY 
UH IN THAT EVERYBODY WANTS UH IT A GOOD PRICE FOR THE CONSUMER AND IT A GOOD PRICE FOR THE COMPANY 
UH AND IT THAT AND WE NEED ALL TO WORK TOGETHER UH TO DO THAT 
UM AND UH BE IN IN PARTICULAR ORDER BECAUSE EV EVERYBODY IS UH JUST AS VITAL TO THIS PROJECT UM I'LL JUST GO AROUND THE THE TABLE ANDREW 
MARKETING UM M KENDRA WITH THE UH UM DESIGNING THE THE THE USER INTERFACE UH UH AND KATE WITH THE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN 
UM 
WHAT'S UH THE THE THE THE PROJECT IS IS HERE TO DO IS IS IT TO GET THIS THIS PROJECT UP AND MOVING 
EV EVERYBODY IS IS FREE TO UH SAY WH WHATEVER THEY WANT UH EVERYBODY HAS A CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE AND UH 
EVERYBODY FEEL FREE TO INTERRUPT ME TO ANY TIME TO TO SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY

RIGHT KENDRA 
RIGHT AT LEAST MEANS YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY PRECONCEIVED IDEAS SO 
YEP GOOD 
OKAY VERY VERY QUICKLY 
UM THIS I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS MEETING TOO STRUCTURED BECAUSE THE THE WHOLE IDEA IS THAT IT'S A UM YOU KNOW A THINK TANK 
EVERYBODY SAYS WHAT THEY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY 
UH AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE CONSTRAINED BY UH KIND OF CONVENTION OR UH UH SLIDES ON SCREENS OR OR ANYTHING ELSE UM BUT UM BRIEFLY UM TH TH THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO 
THE THE REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS TO BE ORIGINAL 
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT UH THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS DON'T HAVE IS THAT AS SOON AS PEOPLE USE IT THEY THINK UM YES THAT'S DIFFERENT 
UH I WANT ONE UM AND THAT GOES ALONG WITH BEING TRENDY UH UH YOU KNOW TH I WANT IT 
UH SCENARIO 
USER FRIENDLY SO SO WE ALL KNOW 
REMOTE CONTROLS CAN BE UH UH VERY USER UNFRIENDLY SO WE WANT TO MAKE OURS ONE THAT PEOPLE CAN PICK UP AND THINK UH YES THAT'S IT'S OBVIOUS HOW THAT WORKS 
UH AND THEY ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THE PRICE AND THINK UH YEAH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I MAY NOT NEED ANOTHER REMOTE CONTROL BUT UH IT'S SUCH A NICE ONE I'M GONNA HAVE NO 
AND LAST BUT NOT LOST OR INDEED FIRST OF ALL IT IT MUST MAKE THE COMPANY MONEY 
AND WE MAKE THE COMPANY MONEY BY PRODUCING WHAT THE CONSUMER WANTS 
THE UH THE FURTHER WORK TO BE DONE IS I TH UM THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UH WHAT IT UH WHAT IT MUST ACTUALLY DO 
THE UH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN UH HOW WE ACTUALLY PRESENT THAT AT THE CONSUMER AND THE THE THE DETAILED DESIGN I SEE UH HOW WE GET THAT INTO PRODUCTION 
UH NOW THE THE MAIN DESIGN TOOL THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO USE IT THE MOMENT IS IS THE WHITE BOARD AND UH UH LET US VERY QUICKLY DO WHAT I WHAT IT SAYS ON THE ON THE ON THE PROMPT SLIDE HERE 
UM 
IN FACT I SUGGEST TO AVOID EVERYBODY UNTANGLING THEMSELVES FROM THE UH THE THE WIRES THAT WE DON'T DO THAT UM 
SO I I EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT WHITEBOARD SO SO WE'LL UM UH WE'LL DO A VIRTUAL DRAWING ON THE IN IN THE WHITEBOARD IF IF YOUR YOUR OWN UH UH FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
BUT LE LET'S GO AROUND THE TABLE YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL

SORRY 
INDEED ABSOLUTELY YES THA THAT'S ME 
OKAY AND UH WE WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND HERE THAT THE UH WE WANT TO SELL THIS FOR FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO UM 
WE WANT TO M MAKE AN OVERALL PROFIT FOR THE THE COMPANY OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT SELLING A LOT OF THIS UM AG ACROSS THE THE ENTIRE PLANET AND AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A GROSS PROFIT OF FIFTY PERCENT 
IT NEEDS TO COST TWELVE EUROS FIFTY TO MAKE 
UM SO WE'RE NOT ONLY LOOKING AT A A VERY TRENDY ORIGINAL PRODUCT WE'RE LOOKING AT MAKING IT IT A VERY GOOD PRICE 
UM OKAY UM WOULD ANYBODY LIKE IT LIKE TO TO START BY GIVING THEIR O UM SORT OF QUICK VIEWS OF OF CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
NO 
ANY ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT BUTTONS OR ANY OTH OTHER WAY OF APPROACHING THE P THE UH THE PROBLEM 
OR ANYBODY ELSE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS 
ARE THERE YOU KNOW BAD ONES THEY'VE USED ARE GOOD ONES THEY'VE USED OR ONES THAT THEY'VE LOST AND NEVER FOUND AGAIN 
UM WHAT IS WH WHAT'S ON ON WHAT PARTICULAR STYLE FEATURES OR YOU THINKING ABOUT 
UH-HUH 
YEAH D NO I MEAN DO YOU THINK THERE'S A RISK OF IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE REMOTE CONTROL PEOPLE WON'T USE IT IS A REMOTE CONTROL UM AND UH 
UH-HUH 
ANY OTHER THOUGHTS ABOUT UM THE THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF A OF REMOTE CONTROLS 
I MEAN THE THE THING THAT I IMMEDIATELY COMES TO MIND IS COMPUTER MOUSES WHICH UM I MEAN YOU YOU GET ALL SORTS OF SHAPES IN THE SHAPES AND SO YOU KNOW SOME QUITE FANCY ONES UM THEN THE SAME FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHICH LOOK NICE BUT AREN'T PARTICULARLY COMFORTABLE 
UM ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT BUTTONS OR FLAT SCREENS OR UH UH 
YES I MEAN THE ONLY THING IS IF IF YOU'RE WATCHING TELEVISION IN A IN A A DARKENED ROOM UM YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO UH 
F FIND THE BUTTON BUTTONS EASILY 
YEAH THAT'S UH MUST ADMIT I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN ONE WITH CONCAVE BUTTONS THAT'S UH CERTAINLY BE DIFFERENT 
UM DO WE NEED TO TO UH I CAN'T THINK OF ANY OUR REMOTE CONTROLS THAT I KNOW IF THAT ACTUALLY LIGHT UP AT ALL 
DO WE DO WE WANT UH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO 
ANDREW HAVE YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS YET BUT HOW WE MIGHT MARKET SOMETHING WHICH THERE ARE ALREADY MILLIONS OUT THERE AND THAT WE WANT TO UH UH UH TO TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE 
UM THE PLANET WITH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY YEAH YEAH WELL I D I THINK IN ANY UH ANY FACETS THAT WE IDENTIFY W W UM AND IT UM FOR FOR ALL OF 
UM OKAY WELL FIRST THOUGHTS ON UM 
THE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN SIDE 
INDEED 
YEAH 
OKAY AND UM COLOURS MATERIALS 
KENDRA ANYONE 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
OKAY THAT'S UH 
AGAIN I DON'T THINK THAT'S EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE 
IT'S UH THE SORT OF THE SORT OF THING THAT WOULD GET PEOPLE UH THINKING YES THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVEN'T GOT AND UH 
MIGHT AND SO 
UH ANDREW ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT UH HOW WE MIGHT MARKET INTERCHANGEABLE FRONTS IN IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK 
MM MM 
RIGHT OKAY I THINK WE'VE GOT UM A GOOD IDEA NOW 
WE UH MEETING IS UH 
NEEDS TO BE K UH WRAPPED UP FAIRLY QUICKLY 
SO UH UM WE'VE GOT THIRTY MINUTES TO 
START LOOKING AT THE AIM AT THE DESIGN IN MORE DETAIL 
UM 
THEN WE'LL WE WILL RECONVENE IN IN THIRTY MINUTES AND TRY TO GET SOME OF THESE IDEAS UH 
UH MORE FORMALISED 
OH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
OH MY NAME'S ANDREW I'M A I'M THE MARKET RESEARCH 
PERSON FOR THIS UH FOR THIS MEETING AND THIS UH PROJECT FOR CREATING THIS NEW REMOTE CONTROL AND UH YEAH I'LL BE UH PRESENTING INFORMATION STATISTICS ON WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO WANT TO UH GET FROM THIS NEW DESIGN 
WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO LOOK AND FROM A FASHION POINT OF VIEW AND THE PRACTICALITY POINT OF VIEW 
UM BADGER 
UH IT'S IT'S GOT NICE CONTRAST WITH BLACK AND WHITE AND UH I FEEL THEY'RE UNDERDOG KIND OF STATUS AND THEY'RE THE 
MAKE MOBILE PHONES AND T. V. REMOTES TO MAKE T. V. REMOTES 
YEAH 
THINK A LOT OF THE TIME REMOTES THAT CAME WITH T. V. PLAYERS AND T. V. S AND D. V. PLAYERS LIKE THEY AREN'T 
LIKE IN OUR THAT'S PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THEY'RE VERY BORING VERY PLAIN 
LIKE IT'S VERY A VERY LIKE UM MAKING A A STYLISH REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE A VERY LIKE 
EASILY PUT IS ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE CURRENT COMPETITION 
UM 
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LOOKS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE UH SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU THINK UH WHAT'S THIS 
LIKE THIS PEN DOESN'T REALLY LIKE LIKE A PEN BUT IT MAKES YOU THINK UH 
SO SORRY THAT'S A BIT VAGUE 
UH I SUPPOSE SUPPOSE THAT'S UP TO THE MARKETING IT 
TO MAKE MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF THE PRODUCT 
MM 
YEAH 
WELL FROM THE MOUSE DO YOU COULD REMOTE IS A PIECE OF PLASTIC WITH THE BIG RUBBER BUTTONS STICKING OUT OF IT WHICH YOU PRESS 
WHEREAS IF YOU WANT COULD ALL BE FLAT AND THE BUTTONS ARE VERY KIND OF ALMOST SUBTLE THAT INSTEAD OF BEING RAISED OUT OF THE DEVICE UH YOU PUSH INTO DEVICE YOU SEE 
LIKE A MOUSE BUTTON 
I SUPPOSE 
EASILY YEAH YEAH 
MM 
MM YEAH THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
MM-HMM UM ESPECIALLY IF WE TRY TO SELL WHAT TWO MILLION OF THEM 
OH SORRY FOUR MILLION OF 'EM BUT UH 
I THINK IF WE IF WE MARKET IT IS IS NOT IS NOT WELL THIS YOU C YOU COULD EITHER MARKET IT IS THE POINT OF VIEW WE COULD HAVE THE TWO WE COULD HAVE PARALLEL MARKETING S SCHEMES WHERE YOU'VE GOT ONE WHERE IT APPEALS TO PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HAVE THE NEW DEVICE THAT LOOKS COOL 
IS FASHIONABLE AND LIKE YOU JUST IT'S IT'S LIKE UH IT'S IN THAT RATHER THAN OR I WAN I WANT RATHER THAN A KIND OF A NEED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEVICE 
BUT THAT MIGHT CONSIDERING THE ACT WHAT THE DEVICE AS FAR AND THE NATURE OF SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE RESPOND TO HAVING A DEVICE THAT THEY JUST LOOKS NICE 
THEREFORE THEY WANT TO USE MAKE IT PRACTICAL AT THE SAME TIME 
I THINK IT'S THIS IS GONNA HAVE TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE THAT WANT DEVICE THAT CAN ENHANCE THEIR LIVING ROOM UH BUT ALSO A DEVICE THAT UH 
IS PRACTICALLY SOUND 
SO UM I DUNNO WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH WHICH ANGLE WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR BOTH 
IF YOU 
MM 
UM WELL WE COULD EITHER MARKET IT TOGETHER BY GETTING CONTROL IN A SET COLOUR OR WITH LIKE YOU BUY IT WITH SEVERAL 
UH LIKE 
YOU GO YOU GET THE F UH THE FACE PLATES WITH IT WHEN YOU BUY OR IS A SEPARATE THING 
BUT UH MAYBE THINKING OF THAT IT'S CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF THE DEVICE 
MAYBE A SECOND THING LIKE A SECOND CAMPAIGN TO MARKET NEW FACIALS FOR YOUR TO YOUR MIGHT GO A BIT ASTRAY SINCE IT IS THE KIND OF THING WHERE YOU YOU GENERALLY GET ONE AND THEN FORGET ABOUT IT 
UNLESS YOU WERE TRYING TO 
MM 
UH IT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
MM 
YEAH TRUE 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
UP 
WELL THE ONLY PROBLEM I CAN THINK OF WITH THAT SO IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANNA BE BOTHERED LEARNING HOW TO USE NEW REM REMOTE CONTROLS 
IF YOU JUST KIND OF TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE USED TO KNOWING THAT'S GONNA BE QUITE A CHANGE 
IT MIGHT 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT LOOK AT THE IMPORTANCE OF THEM 
THE VOLUME SETTINGS 
YEAH 
THEY'RE NOT USED OFTEN BUT THEY ARE QUITE IMPORTANT WHEN THEY'RE USED 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
HMM 
UH YOU HAVE TO HIT LIKE FUNCTION AND F. SOMETHING 
F. EIGHT 
DUNNO 
OH YEAH IT'S GOING 
OH YEAH THEY MIGHT BE MOVABLE 
OH YEAH THEY'RE ALL THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED TO ANYTHING IN THE TABLE YOU JUST LEAVE 'EM ON AND WALK AROUND WITH 'EM 
MM 
MM 
YES MM 
WHICH ONE DOES THIS PLUG INTO 
THAT ONE 
I CAN'T DID YOU COULD YOU USE IT IN YOU SCREEN WHEN IT 
THAT'S NOT COOL 
UH WELL 
ANYWAYS 
UM ALRIGHT YEAH SO UM I'LL JUST DO MY PRESENTATION ON THE WORKING DESIGN UH 
OH THERE WE GO 
OKAY UM JUST TO THE UM YEAH THE WHOLE SORT OF METHOD OF HOW THE REMOTE CONTROL WORKS 
UH THE BASIC FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO ANOTHER SH SYSTEM THE THE T. V. OR THE D. V. D. PLAYER OR WHATEVER 
UM AND IT DOES THIS UH BY WELL 
YOU NEED TO START OFF YOU NEED AN ENERGY SOURCE AND THIS ENERGY SOURCE WILL FEED INTO AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIP AND THE CIRCUIT CHIP IS THE PART THAT ACTUALLY COMPOSES THE DIFFERENT MESSAGES UH WITHIN THE REMOTE UM WHICH WILL THEN BE SENT TO THE UH THE TELEVISION 
THE D. V. D. TO TELL THAT WHAT TO DO 
UM AND YOU NEED A USER INTERFACE 
WHICH CONTROLS THE CHIP AND THIS THE MESSAGES AND UH THE USER INTERFACE SO THAT'S BASICALLY JUST YOU KN THE S SORTA DESIGN OF THE ACTUAL REMOTE WHICH YOU HOLD ON YOUR HANDS AND WHAT BUTTONS WILL BE ON IT 
UM 
OH SHIT 
OKAY 
UH JUST GENERAL FINDINGS 
UH WHAT WE NEED UH TECHNICALLY SPEAKING FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL IS SOME SORT OF ENERGY SOURCE 
UH SOME SORT OF USER INTERFACE WHICH I THINK WE'VE MOSTLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE USER INTERFACE AND THE DESIGN OF THAT 
UM A CIRCUIT CHIP WITHIN THAT IT UH CONTROL AND SEND THE MESSAGES AND UM A SENDER AND RECEIVER 
AND UM OOPS 
UH-HUH 
THIS IS JUST SORT OF A LITTLE SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
UH THIS JUST KINDA REPRESENTS THE ENERGY SOURCE WHICH FEEDS INTO THE CIRCUIT CHIP UH WHICH MAYBE THEN WE COULD HAVE THAT FEED INTO A SWITCH WHICH WOULD SEND SIGNALS F TO ME A SUBCOMPONENT AND ON IT A LIGHT BULB BETWEEN US IT'LL LIGHT UP ONCE WE START ONCE YOU START PRESSING BUTTONS 
UM ALSO SEND SIGNALS TO THE UM INFRARED BULB WHICH WILL BE THE PART THAT ACTUALLY WHAT 
SENDS SIGNALS TO THE THE TELEVISION 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR HAPPY LITTLE T. V. WATCHER THERE 
AND SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES I I JUST THINK WE NEED SORTA BIG UH ENERGY SOURCE THAT WON'T DO IT 
UH PERHAPS SOME SORT OF RECHARGEABLE BATTERY OR A BATTERY DOCK YOU COULD PLACE TO ONE 
SO IT'D CONSTANTLY BE CHARGED SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO UH BE WORRYING ABOUT IT RUNNING OUT OF BATTERIES AND NOT CHANGING CHANNELS FOR YOU 
UH A WIDE RANGE UH SENDER RECEIVER SO THAT YOU CAN HIT THE BUTTONS FROM BASICALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ROOM AND THE CHANNEL'LL STILL BE CHANGED 
UH ALSO DEFINITELY A USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE UM AND I THINK WE'VE ALL SORT OF MENTIONED ADDING A A LOCATING DEVICE ON IT 
SO WHEN IT DOES GET STUCK UNDER THE COUCH CUSHIONS AS THEY INEVITABLY DO YOU CAN FIND THEM EASILY 
AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT 
MM 
MM 
MM 
JUST HAVING ONE THAT'S GUARANTEED AT LEAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS 
OH COOL 
YEAH FAIR ENOUGH 
MM MM 
MM YEAH 
MM MM 
MM 
'CAUSE I ONLY REMEMBER TO CHARGE MY CELL PHONE UH WHEN BATTERY DIES 
AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH YEAH 
YEAH WHEN IT TURNS ITSELF OFF THAT'S WHEN I PLUG IT IN YEAH 
YEAH THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
MM 
THEY USUALLY HAVE THE LITTLE LIGHT UH SOURCE I DUNNO WHAT THE HECK THEY'RE CALLED THE BUT YEAH THE LITTLE CELLS THAT 
YEAH 
MM 
MOST OF THEM DON'T THEY HAVE SORT OF A COMBINATION OF THE TWO 
LIKE WHEN THERE IS LIGHT THEY'LL WORK OFF THE LIGHT AND IF THERE ISN'T 
THEY'LL KICK INTO THIS BATTERY SO WE CAN MAYBE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEREAS THERE IS A BATTERY 
BUT IF THERE'S ENOUGH LIGHT THEN IT'S USING THE LIGHT SO THAT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY DRAINING THE BATTERY ALL THE TIME 
BUT YOU WILL HAVE THE BATTERY THERE FOR WHEN YOU NEED TO 
MM 
MM 
UH IT DEPEND IF IT'S UH DEPENDS WHO WHO'S USING IT WHO'S JUST SITTING THERE CLICKING CLICKING CLICKING CLICKING YEAH 
YEAH THEN THEY'RE CLICKING A LOT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
YEP 
HMM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
COOL 
SORRY 
IT COULD BE UH UH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY UH MAYBE LIKE THE FLIP PHONES THAT THEY USE 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW MO MOBILE PHONES THAT FLIP IT AND THEY HAVE THE LIKE TEXTING AND THEN THE NUMBERS ON ONE SIDE 
SO YOU COULD HAVE THE MOST USED BUTTONS ON TOP AND FLIP IT IT OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
THAT MIGHT BE THE 
MAYBE I 
YEAH 
HAVE A BIG KIND OF LIKE THE SATELLITE BOX OR THE CABLE BOX AND HAVE TO JUST GO ON THE T. V. AND THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IN THE ROOM YOU ARE 
YOU WON'T LOSE IT 
NO 
OH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
OKAY WELL I CAN DO MINE 
YEAH LET'S SEE IF I CAN MAKE THIS WORK 
UM 
OH 
SO IT DOING 
OKAY 
OH OKAY 
OKAY SO THIS IS JUST ABOUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
SO THE METHOD 
I LOOKED ONLINE FOR EXAMPLES OF OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND THEN JUST KIND OF WAS TRYING TO BRAINSTORM SOME POSSIBLE DESIGN IDEAS AND UM IDENTIFY WHAT THE NECESSARY THINGS ARE 
WHAT PEOPLE ARE WHAT YOU REALLY WANNA HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL DO 
UM AND THEN THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS THAT I FOUND 
THERE'S A USER CENTRED ONE AND AN ENGINEERING CENTRED ONE WHICH I WILL HAVE PICTURES OF AND THEN WE KINDA HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH IN THIS SHOULD BE 
SO THESE ARE THE TWO DIFFERENT ONES 
THIS ONE UM THIS IS THE USER CENTRED IT HAS UH QUITE A FEW MM UH UM FEWER BUTTONS AND THEN THIS IS THE ENGINEERING CENTRED 
WHICH HAS A LOT MORE BUTTONS AND PROBABLY THIS IS IN THAT PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT ABOUT HAVING TOO MANY BUTTONS THAT YOU DON'T SEE 
SO BASICALLY WHAT A REMOTE CONTROL SO SO YOU IT'S TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET 
YOU KNOW TURN ON OFF SWITCH THE CHANNELS AND THE VOLUME AND THINGS SUCH AS THAT 
AND SO FOR THIS PRODUCT IT'S GONNA BE TELEVISION ONLY AND THEN IT HAS TO HAVE THE UH LEGS 
FOR THE COMPANY AND THE COLOURS 
AND SO FOR MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES I THINK THIS ONE IS EASIER TO USE AND HAS QUITE A YOU KNOW FEWER BUTTONS 
UM WE WANT SOMETHING THAT SENDS MESSAGES EASILY TO THE TELEVISION AND I WAS KIND OF WONDERING ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE THAT THEY HAVE 
IT LOOKS KIND OF NARROW AT THE TOP AND I WAS THINKING MAYBE IF IT WERE WIDER AT THE TOP THEN THAT WOULD BE EASIER 
UM AND SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT'S GONNA MAKE OUR PRODUCT DIFFERENT 
E THE UNIQUE STYLE MAYBE HAVE TO LIGHT UP SO IT'S VISIBLE ON THE DARK 
UM THE CHANGEABLE FACE PLATES AND THE LIGHTING UP AND VISIBLE I WAS WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVI LOSING IT 
MAYBE TO HAVE A BUTTON ON THE TELEVISION THAT YOU PRESS AND IT MAYBE IF IT MAKES A NOISE OR LIGHTS UP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO IT'S EASIER TO FIND IF SOMEONE HAS HIDDEN UNDER THE COUCH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO THAT'S MY PRESENTATION 
YEAH 
IF THEY PROBABLY CLIP TO YOU 
OH 
HMM I THINK IT'S ALL THREE 
OH 
OH YEAH 
THAT'S KIND OF STRANGE 
YEAH PEOPLE ARE PRO I WOULD THINK THAT PEOPLE MIGHT FORGET I MEAN PEOPLE FORGET TO PUT THEIR CORDLESS PHONES BACK IN THERE IS 
YEAH 
UM 
DO THEY MAKE BATTERIES THAT LAST THAT LONG 
YEAH THEY HAVE THAT LITTLE SOLAR 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH SOME PEOPLE ARE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
PER HOUR 
WOW 
THAT'S A LOT 
YEAH 
THOUGH I THINK WITH DIGITAL T. V. LIKE I KNOW IN MY CABLE BOX 
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE CHANNEL CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT IF YOU JUST PRESS IT LIKE THAT 
SO YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE THE MENU AND GO THROUGH THE DIFFERENT 
CHANNELS THAT WAY INSTEAD OF 
UH UH 
YEAH 
UM 
UH I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION 
SO ARE WE DOING JUST THE TELEVISION OR ARE WE DOING IS NOT D. V. D. PLAYERS WE OKAY OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY WELCOME TO THE SECOND MEETING OF THIS UH DESIGN GROUP 
UM 
I'LL BRIEFLY GO THROUGH THE UH 
NOTES OF THE OF THE LAST MEETING 
UH JUST DONE IN IN NOTE FORM AND I HAVEN'T ATTRIBUTED ANYTHING TO INDIVIDUALS 
BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING STRICTLY AS A TEAM HERE AND UH N NOBODY'S WORKING EQUALLY SO UH 
UM WE WE SO WE SAW THAT THE THE PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS WERE THE UH BE A BORING SHAPE AND BORING COLOUR 
UM AND AND WE SO WE SAW THAT THE UM WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO WAS IT TO MAKE SURE THE DEVICE UM CONTROLS SEVERAL TIMES 
THAT SWITCHING WAS EASY 
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T NEED TO POINT THE THING TO UH ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR UM THAT IT NEED TO BE CONTOURED TO MAKE IT INTERESTING 
THAT THE KEYS MIGHT BE CONCAVE SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE THAT WE KNOW IF 
UM SHOULD HAVE INTERCHANGEABLE FASCIAS SO PEOPLE CAN PERSONALISE IT UM ILLUMINATED SO THAT PEOPLE CAN USE IT IN DARK ROOMS 
UM AND THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO USE AS IN ADDITION TO THEIR EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM AND THAT IT SH IT SHOULD JUST ALWAYS WORK WHENEVER YOU UH UM 
MM UH IS IT 
AND THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO SMALL MM THAT IT IT GETS LOST 
UM 
NOW UH 
UH I'LL SHORTLY ASK FOR FOR THREE THREE PRESENTATIONS 
UH BEFORE I DO THAT HOWEVER 
I WILL GO THROUGH SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS THAT UM THE THE MANAGEMENT HAVE PLACED IN S AND UH WILL BE CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED AT THE FIRST MEETING 
UM THE UH 
THE UM THE MANAGEMENT HAS HAD IT'S OWN THOUGHTS ON THIS AND UH TH THEY DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH WITH WHAT WE UH WE THOUGHT 
UM AND AND THEN WE'LL SEE A RESULT OF THAT WE WILL THEN TALK THROUGH THE THE FUNCTIONS THAT WE USE THE THE DEVICE UM ACTUALLY B CARRYING OUT 
AND WE HAVE UH FORTY MINUTES TO DO THIS ONE AND I UH 
ANYWAY 
OKAY 
NOW 
THE ON THE NEW REQUIREMENTS OR UM THE THE MANAGEMENT TEAM IS THAT UM TELETEXT IS NO LONGER OF ANY IMPORTANCE GIVEN THE UH THE RISE OF THE INTERNET 
UM AND AND THEY WANT TO ONLY TO COVER TELEVISIONS 
UM NOW 
WHAT IS NOT Q QUITE CLEAR FROM THEIR DIRECTIVE IS WHETHER THEY MEAN TH THEY DON'T WANT TO TO COVER TELETEXT OR WHETHER THEY DON'T WANT TO TO COVER 
YOU KNOW 
VIDEOS D. V. D. S UM SATELLITE BOXES WHICH UH I MEAN WE SAW AS BEING FUNDAMENTAL TO THE UH AT THE EXERCISE 
THE UM THE ACTUAL WORDING OF THE DIRECTIVE IS THAT IT SHOULD COVER TELEVISION ONLY 
UM AND ON THAT BASIS UM I I THINK WE WE NEED TO BEAR THAT IN MIND 
UM BUT POSSIBLY UH KEEP IT THE BACKS OF OUR MINDS THAT THE REALITY THAT PEOPLE EVEN WHEN THEY UH NO LONGER THEY DON'T LOOK AT TELETEXT ANYMORE 
THEY CERTAINLY DO LOOK AT OTHER THINGS 
UM THE DEVICE HAS TO INCORPORATE THE COMPANY LOGO AND COLOURS 
UM THE THE LOGO UH BEING TO BE THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN THERE THE THE THE TWO R. S IN GREY AGAINST UH A YELLOW BACKGROUND 
UM NOW THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME OF OUR IDEAS ABOUT MAKING IT ATTRACTIVE TO THE TO TO THE MARKET 
BUT UH D DO INTRODUCE SOME SOME CONSTRAINTS IS IT HOW WE MIGHT DO THAT 
UM IT ALSO HAS TO BE SIMPLE WHICH AT SOME EXTENT GOES ALONG W WITH THE FIRST ONE 
AND THAT WE'VE ALREADY SAID THAT IT MUST BE SIMPLE 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT ANYWAY 
UM BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO TO BE SIMPLE TO GET TO TO THE MARKET QUICKLY WHICH UM 
MM UH AS AS AS THEIR CHOICE BUT UH UM WE WE NEED TO TALK THAT THROUGH 
UM OKAY SO UH 
AFTER THE MEETING IT'LL BE SUMMARISED AND UH 
UM NOTES SENT TO AND UH ETCETERA 
OKAY SO WE'LL FIRST OF ALL MM HAVE INDIVIDUAL REPORTS FROM EVERYBODY 
UM AGAIN I THERE IS IN ORDER OF PRECEDENCE HERE UM SO I I I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU TO WHO WHO WHO THINKS THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO GO FIRST 
P FINE 
OH SORRY YOU CAN INDEED 
UH IF YOU CLICK ON THE UM UH THE ON THAT THAT LOOKS LIKE A PROJECTION SCREEN ON THE ONE AT THE RIGHT OF THAT 
THAT ONE 
MM 
MM 
GOSH MUST BE SOME TELLY ADDICTS OUT THERE IF THEY GET R. S. I. FROM THEIR TELEVISION REMOTE IS ALL I CAN SAY 
MM 
RIGHT 
MM 
YEAH I MUST SAY THAT UM THE UH I C CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT UM IF YOU KNOW PHONE SERVICE I WAS USING THE OTHER DAY 
BUT THAT HAD SORTA SPEECH RECOGNITION WHICH WORKED UH REMARKABLY WELL SO THAT IS NEEDED A UH 
UM 
A THOUGHT AND IT TO CATS TOO UH 
I WAS WAS GONNA SAY YOU CAN'T GET A LOT OF R. S. I. J JUST GET JAW ACHE 
OKAY SORRY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I MEAN 
YEAH 
MM 
HMM-HMM 
SHOULD WE ACTUALLY BUT THE BULLET HERE 
IF PEOPLE REALLY DON'T USE THESE BUTTONS AT ANY EXTENT AT ALL UM REMOVE THEM ALTOGETHER 
WE WE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE WE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH UM 
I WONDER WHETHER WE COULD GET THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH NO BUTTONS AT ALL IF WE WENT FOR VOICE RECOGNITION GIVEN THAT UM THE 
UM NOW THE THE AGE STRUCTURE WE WERE LOOKING AT UM I MEAN WE WE HAD USAGE BY AGE STRUCTURE 
WHAT WE DIDN'T HAVE WAS WHAT PROPORTION OF PEOPLE USING REMOTES WERE IN THIS PARTICULAR AGE GROUPS 
NOW DO WE KNOW WHETHER THEY 
FORTY NO SORRY FOR FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE AGE GROUP UH TO PUT MYSELF RIGHT ON THE MIDDLE OF IT 
UM U USE REMOTE CONTROLS TO A GREAT EXTENT 
YES WE 
THAT WOULD 'VE SPEECH RECOGN RIGHT 
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT UM WELL AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW THE RELATIVE PROPORTION THE RELATIVE NUMBERS ON THE AGE GROUPS 
IF WE WANTED SOMETHING 
DIFFERENT TRULY DIFFERENT THAN THE BUTTONLESS REMOTE CONTROL WE WOULD BE TOO 
BUT IF YOU JUST LIFT IT UP AND SAY CHANNEL ONE OR B. B. C. 
IT C WELL IT I CAN I CAN SEE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS WITH THAT IN TERMS OF THE YOU KNOW 
THE SOUND FROM THE TELEVISION BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY ACTUALLY ON THE TELEVISION SAYS UH UH YOU KNOW 
A. T. V. AND YOU'RE WATCHING B. B. C. THEN THEN IT MIGHT UM CHANGE ITSELF IS IT PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE UM POSSIBLY ACTUALLY NEED A BUTTON ON IT 
JUST TO ACTIVATE IT 
OR OR SOMETHING JUST TO IDENTIFY THAT YOU'VE LIFTED IT UP AND IT'S SO 
AND AND THEN JUST SAY UH I DON'T KNOW A THOUGHT AND AND THEN UH I MEAN THAT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE UH TRULY DIFFERENT 
UM 'CAUSE UH YOU KNOW AUDIO SETTINGS NOUGHT POINT EIGHT PERCENT 
I MEAN IF THEY WEREN'T THERE 
WOULD PEOPLE MISS THEM 
VOL VOLUME YES UM THE W WE NEED TO S IDENTIFY THINGS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY AND AND AND IT'S A FUNCTION OF FREQUENCY AND RELEVANCE 
AND UM I WOULD SAY IGNORING IG IGNORING POWER FOR THE MOMENT 
UM THE CHANNEL AND VOLUME AND THE W W GIVEN GIVEN THAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO IGNORE TELETEXT 
UH CHANNEL AND VOLUME OR THE ONLY ONES THAT 
UH WOULD APPEAR TO BE ESSENTIAL 
UM 
SO WE IF WE CAN DESIGN SOMETHING THAT THAT LOOKS INTERESTING 
KNOW OR LOOKS DIFFERENT 
UM INCORPORATES THE THE LOGO AND AND THE COLOURS AND UM WE CAN STILL HAVE OUR INTERCHANGEABLE FASCIAS EVEN IF IT'S THE YELLOW AND GREY UM 
AND UH I DUNNO BUTTONS ARE ARE BUTTONS AS AN OPTION 
DO PLEASE 
MM-HMM 
YOU CER CERTAINLY COULD 
DEPE UH I DEPENDS WHETHER UM IF WE WANT TO MAKE THIS 
SO SIMPLE THAT ANYBODY CAN WALK INTO THE ROOM AND LIFT IT UP AND SAY 
B. B. C. ONE 
UM OKAY I MEAN YOU COULD 
PRINT ACTUALLY PRINT IT IN THE UH 
DEVICE ITSELF 
UM 
SO TH THIS I TH THAT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A PROBLEM I THINK 
UM AND I I I SEE SO I SUPPOSE ONE UM 
COULD MAKE IT SO DESIRABLE THAT IF PEOPLE LOSE IT THEY IMMEDIATELY GO OUT AND BUY ANOTHER ONE 
ANYWAY SORRY CARRY ON 
DO YOU WANT TO JUST CARRY ON WITH 
OR NO NO NO UH B I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR REPORT THERE 
MM OKAY 
MM-HMM 
SO SO WE COULD WE COULD MAKE IT DUAL FUNCTION VOICE RECOGNITION AND STILL HAVE BUTTONS ON IT UM 'CAUSE WE'RE 
CERTAINLY COULD 
YEAH YEAH 
TH I MEAN THE THE ADVANTAGE OF DOING AWAY THE BUTTONS ALTOGETHER IS IT MAKES THE THING CHEAPER 
NO IT COU CERTAINLY OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY FOR MAKING IT UH YOU KNOW VISUALLY VERY DISTINCTIVE 
UM 'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A OBLONG BOX 
MM YEAH 
OKAY WHO SORRY HAVE YOU HAVE YOU FINISHED THERE ANDY 
YEP YEP 
UM GIVEN THAT WE'VE ALREADY HAD A EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION UH 
OH THERE WE GO 
ALRIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
OKAY CAN I UM I'M ACTUALLY GONNA USE THE UM IT'S GONNA CAUSE GREAT TECHNICAL PROBLEMS OVER HERE 
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA USE THE 
YES RATHER THAN THE UH THE THE TRADITIONAL IN FACT UM I WON'T EVEN GO THAT FOR 
UM SOMETHING LIKE THIS SHAPE YOU KNOW 
SORT OF SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN THAT'S SORT OF A MORE VERTICAL SHAPE 
UM THAT YOU YOU SORT OF HOLD ON YOUR HAND UM WELL I'M TRYING TO THINK 
UH UH UH L UH L SUCH AS I MEAN UM SOMETHING YOU HOLD UP LIKE THAT POSSIBLY WITH A COUPLE OF BUTTONS LIKE THAT 
BUT WITH THE THE ENTIRE TOP WITH THE YOU KNOW THE UH THE INFRARED OR WHATEVER SOURCE 
UH SO THAT YOU KNOW IT'S 
FLYING OFF IN ALL DIRECTIONS SO THAT UH UM UH AGAIN THE N NEED TO LOOK AT THE THE THE TECHNICALITIES OF UM 
ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THAT IN TERMS OF WHETHER THE YOU KNOW THE POWER REQUIREMENTS OF THE UH SUCH A SOURCE 
UM YOU KNOW COMPROMISE THE OR OR AND FOR UH YOU KNOW IT IT BEING 
UM MM PERMANENTLY 
UH YOU KNOW AVAILABLE 
UH WHETHER WHETHER DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY UM I MEAN THE ALL ALL THOSE REMOTES ARE PRESUMABLY INFRARED AND LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME 
UH WE WE POSSIBLY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT IT IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT UM YOU KNOW SHORT RANGE 
NOT LIKE THE OLD UH RADIO REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE YOU'D CHANGE NEXT DOOR'S TELLY WHEN YOU CHANGE YOURS 
UM 
BUT UH UH I THINK BASICALLY I IF WE'RE GOING FOR I IF MINIMUM NUMBER OF BUTTONS AS OUR PRIORITY THEN WE SHOULD USE I SAY 
OR KNOW REALLY ABOUT THE BULLETS AND AND REDUCE THE BUTTONS TO ABSOLUTE MINIMUM YOU KNOW POSSIBLY WITH BACKUP CHANNEL AND VOLUME BUTTONS AND ON OFF 
UM AND NOTHING ELSE 
UM SO THAT IT CAN AL IT COULD UH ALMOST END UP LIKE THAT BUT AGAIN EXCEPT THAT UM YOU KNOW THE RISK OF LOSING IT 
UM ANYWAY OKAY UM SO KATE WH WHAT ARE YOUR UH YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS 
OKAY 
UH IT SEEMS SEEMS TO UM THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS TO MAKE BEFORE WE UM I THINK YOUR POINT ABOUT THE THE BIG ENERGY SOURCE IS UH A VERY VALID ONE 
UM I DON'T SUPPOSE WE'VE GOT ANY STATISTICS ON THE THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS PARTICULARLY SORT OF INDEPENDENT ONES 
UM GIVEN 
YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU BUY THESE DAYS WHICH YOU KNOW HAVE A A A LITHIUM WHATEVER BATTERY ONE 
THAT'S UH YOU KNOW NEVER NEEDS REPLACING 
UM PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE THE THE DISPOSABLE REMOTE CONTROL UH UM YOU KNOW IN SOME SORT OF TYPICAL USAGE 
YOU KNOW THE THE THE BATTERY WILL LOST 
KNOW FIVE TEN YEARS 
BY WHICH TIME I MEAN WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE THE DIGITAL TELEVISION 
WILL BE TAKING OVER IN THAT TIME SCALE 
UM 
UH UH P PERHAPS WE SHOULD KNOW REDUCE THE UH YOU KNOW 
THE SORT OF MOVING PARTS EVEN MORE BY NOT EVEN HAVING A BATTERY COMPARTMENT AND UH 
YEAH AND IF IF ANYBODY MANAGES TO RUN IT DOWN WE'LL WE'LL GIVE 'EM A NEW ONE 
UM IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT IT SAVES IN COST AND YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A WELL IT'S ACTUALLY A MARKETING GIMMICK 
I MEAN IT'S HARDLY A GIMMICK IT'S UH IT'S TOTALLY PRACTICAL 
UH SO I TH THANK YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF A RECHARGEABLE ONE IS UM 
UH UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY HIGH TECH AND IT SORT OF JUST RECHARGES ITSELF IF IT'S ONE BY YOU KNOW MAGNETIC WAVES OR WHATEVER IF IF IT 
YEAH 
OR ARE PEOPLE REALLY GONNA USE IT THOUGH 
UM 
I I TH I THINK 
YEAH 
IT'S UM I MEAN I KNOW THAT SOMEI TIMES MY MY WIFE GOES OUT ON THE MORNING AND SAYS UH I SHOULD HAVE PUT THE PHONE ON TO CHARGE AND THEN THEN SHE'S HAD THIS FAR AS LONG THAT IF SHE HASN'T WORKED THAT IT BY NOW 
UM 
WHEN IT YEAH WH WHEN IT'S DIED IS A PROBLEM 
YEAH YEAH YEAH SO UH UM WHAT IS WH WHAT WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THE UM THE THE PERMANENT MM BATTERY 
SO THE UH YOU KNOW W W WE ARE REALLY GOING FOR THE ULTIMATE IN EX UH EXTERNAL SIMPLICITY HERE 
UM YOU KNOW CUT COST WITHIN THE 
MANUFACTURING AND UH 
YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE A HIGH TECH INTERIOR THEN THEN THAT THAT SHE MY WILL BE COST EFFECTIVE 
I MEAN TH TH CERTAINLY 
UM I CAN'T THINK IF ANYTHING OFF THE S TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY THINGS THAT YOU BUY 
I MEAN CALCULATORS FOR EXAMPLE 
SOME WELL SOME IDEA I MEAN TH TH BUT THERE ARE BATTERY ONES THAT UM ARE YOU KNOW SORT OF PERMANENTLY SEALED 
IN IN FACT I'D 
YEAH UH UH 
YEAH I I MEAN TH TH THIS NEEDS GOING TO INTO THE TECHNOLOGY A BIT 
I MEAN THE THE ACTUAL TIME THAT A REMOTE CONTROL IS ACTUALLY OPERATING 
I WOULD THINK SO 
I IS IS PROBABLY YOU KNOW ONE MORE THAN MINUTES IN ITS ENTIRE LIFE 
UM 
IF BUT I SAY IF IF PEOPLE ARE GETTING R. S. I. FROM IT THEN UH THEN UH THEN THEN PERHAPS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WRONG MARKET IN 
RIGHT 
UH I MUST ADMIT I HADN'T UM I'D I'D MISSED THAT 
THAT DOES SOUND EXCESSIVE 
YEAH 
WELL THAT'S RIGHT 
AND AND I I DON'T I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER THE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER THE USE THE SIGNAL LASTS AS LONG AS YOU ACTUALLY KEEP THE BUTTON PRESSED 
OR WHETHER IT'S JUST A 
SORTA TENTH OF A SECOND NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU PRESS IT FOR I DON'T KNOW I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW 
UM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
RIGHT SO I'VE GOT A MESSAGE TO SAY FIVE MINUTES I DUNNO HOW LONG AGO THAT APPEARED 
UM 'CAUSE WE'RE WE'RE GETTING UM RIGHT SO I'D I NEED TO SUM UP VERY QUICKLY HERE UM 
WE'RE LOOKING AT EXTREME SIMPLICITY 
WE'RE LOOKING AT A 
RADICALLY DIFFERENT SHAPE 
POSSIBLY ONE BUTTONS AT ALL UM BUT IF YOU CAN INCORPORATE UM 
CHANNEL CHANGE AND VOLUME BUTTONS UM IN INTO THE DESIGN THEN THEN THAT'S FINE 
UM IN THE I MEAN THE THE ROLE OF THE OF THE UM THE USER INTERFACE DES DESIGNER BECOMES B YOU KNOW MORE IMPORTANT HERE 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHAPE IS NO LONGER ON 
A UH UM A SERIOUS CONSTRAINT 
BUT WE CLEARLY ONLY NEED THE THE MAIN BUTTONS ALTHOUGH UH IF CLEARLY ONLY NEED THE MAIN FUNCTIONS 
UM I DON'T SEE WHY WE SHOULDN'T GO FOR VOICE RECOGNITION UM AND THE THE ONLY BUTTONS THAT I THINK WE NEED OR CHANNEL CONTROL 
VOLUME CONTROL AND ON OFF 
UM IT NEEDS TO INCORPORATE THE CORPORATE LOGO UH THE THE GREY AND YELLOW COLOUR SCHEME AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T INTRODUCE UM INTERCHANGEABLE 
UH COVERS 
UM UH DO IS DOES THAT ACCURATELY SUMMARISE WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED 
RIGHT 
SO UH 
YEAH 
WE ARE DOING JUST THE TELEVISION 
NO 
I THINK THAT'S QUITE CLEAR FROM THE THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN NO 
RIGHT 
OH YEAH WELL TH THAT'S NO I SEE THAT'S NO I SENT YOU 
WHICH WHICH WAS MY INTERPRETATION OF UH OF THE UH WHAT CAME DOWN FROM FROM HEAD OFFICE 
UM 
THAT'S THAT THAT THAT THAT'S THERE UH THEIR VIEW 
OKAY SO UH WE CAN ALL GIVE SOME THOUGHT IT THAT UH FOR FOR THE NEXT MEETING THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
UH I DON'T MIND 
UH CAN I STEAL THE CABLE 
CHEERS 
I GOT A HOW DO I START THERE 
THAT ONE 
COOL 
WELL THESE ARE FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS FROM THE OUR OUR GUYS DOWN ON THE THE RESEARCH LAB 
TOOK HUNDRED PEOPLE AND COVERED ALL THE ASPECTS OF WHAT UM IS NEEDED BY PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY WANT TO USE 
UM EVERYTHING KINDA FROM FUNCTIONALITY AND HOW INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONS OR HOW MU HOW HOW OFTEN THEY'RE USED AND HOW MUCH THEIR NECESSARY AND STUFF 
AND GENERAL OPINIONS ABOUT CURRENT CURRENT REMOTES 
SO THAT SO WE KINDA NOTICED SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE FIND THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY 
SO SOME KIND OF A NEW STYLE SHOULD BE INCORPORATED THAT'S LESS UGLY 
UH ALONG WITH UM LOOKING LESS UGLY IF IT LOOKS BETTER EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY'D SPEND MORE MONEY ON IT 
WHICH IS A A PLUS FOR US IF WE CAN MAKE IT LOOK BETTER IT'D BE UH 
MORE COST EFFECTIVE 
AND WE CAN PUT THE PRICE UP 
CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER 
I CAN EMPL I KINDA TAKE THAT IT MEAN SO UM 
THEY 
THEY DON'T UH THEY YEAH 
THEY ONLY AS THEY ONLY WORK FOR THE TELEVISION OR YEAH LIKE AS IN IN MY FLAT I'VE GOT SIX REMOTE CONTROLS FOR A STEREO SYSTEM 
A DIGITAL BOX A D. V. D. PLAYER A VIDEO PLAYER AND T. V. 
IF IT WAS UH I MEAN THE MY BEHAVIOUR IS TO USE MULTIPLE THINGS TO THE SAME TIME AND MULTIPLE REMOTES AREN'T REALLY MATCHED WELL TO MY BEHAVIOUR 
UH AGAIN SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT IS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS SAY THEY ZAP A LOT 
I TAKE IT MEAN THAT THEY JUST THEY USE IT A LOT THEY USE IT REGULARLY RATHER THAN STANDING UP AND 
MANUALLY CHANGE CHANNELS OR VOLUME 
AND UH 
YEAH UH I THINK THE BIG ISSUE IS FIFTY PERCENT USERS ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS 
'CAUSE UH WH IF WE GOT A REMOTE THAT LIKE WELL WE'LL HAVE SOME BUTTONS TAKEN OFF BY THE LACK OF TELETEXT 
BUT UH UH AND WE'RE GOING TO USE UH IN THE UH THAT SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS LIKE AUDIO SETTINGS AREN'T H HARDLY EVER USED AND USED VERY AREN'T CONSIDERED RELEVANT BY THE USER 
SO I THINK MAYBE FEWER BUTTONS WHICH ALSO MAKE THE DESIGN LOOK SLEEKER I DUNNO 
UH UM YEAH AND 
UH FRUSTRATIONS OF LIKE PEOPLE LOSING REMOTE CONTROL 
I DUNNO MAYBE SOME KIND OF SYSTEM IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON ON THE T. V. OR MAYBE THAT'S B IT WOULD HAVE TO INCORPORATE 
BUT LIKE SOME KIND OF SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN OF US SOMETHING ELSE TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL 
MAYBE LIKE IT'LL BEEP OR SOMETHING 
AND UM YEP THE UH TIME TAKEN TO LEARN NEW REMOTE CONTROLS SO 
UH DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT TOO COMPLICATED EASY TO USE FOR UH NEW LIKE FIRST TIME USERS AND STUFF 
AND UH REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD MAKE IT MORE COMFORTABLE AND MAKE UM POSSIBLY EVEN SO HAVE TO MAKE IT 
YEAH FEWER BUTTONS LIKE I WAS SAYING ABOUT THE WHOLE MICE THE MOUSE IDEA OF IT FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE 
MAYBE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HOLD IT IS SUCH 
BUT UH YEAH 
IT ALSO ASKED ME IF WE WOULD IF PEOPLE WOULD PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION AND YOUNGER PEOPLE SAY THEY WOULD 
AND UH THERE WAS ANOTHER SECTION ON OR IN THE REPORT FOR UH L. C. D. DISPLAYS BUT THE DATA WASN'T THERE IS 
I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS FOR THAT WERE SO 
MAY BE INCREMENTALLY EMITTING BUT YEAH 
AND UH IT WOULD CUT OUT THE R. S. I. AS WELL IF YOU 
YEAH UM UH YEAH SO POSSIBLY THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS POSSIBLY SOMETHING COULD ADD INTO THE DESIGN 
OH I'VE GOT SOME OTHER THINGS I COULDN'T FIT INTO THIS PRESENTATION 
UM 
YOU USE THIS OKAY 
ALMOST NO 
IT'S SORRY IT'S A BIT 
I'LL READ IT TO YOU 
UH FUNCTIONALITY UH LIKE PEOPLE'S OPINIONS ON FUNCTIONALITY THE RELEVANCE TO THE REMOTE AND HOW OFTEN THEY'RE USED 
SO UM 
LIKE THE POWER 
USING THE USING THE D SWI THE POWER SWITCH TO SWITCH ON T. V. S A HIGH RELEVANCE OF NINE BUT IT'S NOT FREQUENTLY USED 
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
WHEREAS CHANNEL SELECTION WHICH IS VERY HIGH RELEVANCE IS USED THE MOST 
SO UM WE CAN MAYBE EVEN START TO CUT DOWN ONE OR I WAS POSSIBLY EVEN THINKING OF A DESIGN THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE BUTTONS ARE HIDDEN FROM EVERYDAY USE 
MAYBE LIKE UH A FOLDING LEDGE OR SOMETHING 
SO THAT WE CAN MAYBE GO INTO THE CHANNEL SETTINGS AND THE AUDIO SETTINGS WHICH ARE LOW RELEVANCE AND RARELY USED 
AND KEEP THE V VOLUME SELECTION AND CHANNEL SELECTION VERY EASILY 
OH YEAH 
YEAH LIKE THE ON THAT LIKE SLIDES BACK AND THE BUTTONS ARE CONCEALED UNDERNEATH 
JUST REMOVE THEM COMPLETELY 
OH YEAH 
UM IN THIS IS FOR PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
OR EVEN I MEAN YOU COULD EVEN JUST HAVE TO LEFT ONE 
YOU COULD JUST PUT IT DOWN ONCE ON TOP YOUR T. V. AND NEVER HAVE TO 
YEAH 
B. B. C. ONE 
OH YEAH 
MM MM 
RELEVANCE OF TWO OUT OF TEN YEAH 
YEAH 
STAND OUT 
UH I JUST HAD A THOUGHT ACTUALLY SORRY TO INTERRUPT 
UH YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT UM IT COULD TECHNICAL PROBLEMS OF LIKE UH SOMEONE ON THE TELEVISION SAYING A CHANNEL NUMBER AND IT CHANGED WE COULD MAYBE HAVE LIKE AN ACTIVATION 
WORD 
'CAUSE I'VE SEEN I'VE SEEN THOSE USED ON COMPUTERS BEFORE WHERE YOU JUST YOU ADDRESS THE REMOTE YOU ADDRESS THE COMPUTER AND THEN GIVE IT A COMMAND 
UH I SEE 
OH YEAH I SEE 
MM-HMM YEAH 
I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING OF THE POINT OF VIEW OF PEOP YOU COULD STILL LIKE ALSO THIS REMOTE 
MM 
OH NO I I INTERRUPTED YOU SORRY 
OH OKAY 
UM WELL I WAS JUST KINDA WRAPPING UP THERE 
YEAH I WAS THINKING UM YEAH MAYBE SUCH THINGS ARE RELEVANT 
WE COULD MAKE THINGS MUCH MORE IF I THINK THE THE EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WOULD SPEND MORE IN UH A REMOTE UH THAT LOOKS BETTER 
COMBINED WITH UH DECREASE THE R TAKE OUT THE LIMITED FUNCTIO FUNCTIONS THAT WE DON'T REALLY AS MUCH 
ALRIGHT TAKE OUT TELETEXT BUT IS FOR CHANNEL SETTINGS AND STUFF IT MIGHT IT MIGHT UM TURN PEOPLE SOMEWHE PEOP SOME PEOPLE THAT WANT THE WHOLE FUNCTIONALITY AWAY 
BUT SINCE IF WE'RE MARKETING A MORE KIND OF FASHIONABLE APPROACH THEN IT'D IT WOULD BE FASHION AND FASHION OVER PRACTICALITY 
UH WE COULD YEAH 
WE C YEAH 
WE COULD EVEN HAVE TO USE LIKE A YEAH THE BUTTONS CONTROL THIS AND THE VOICE FUNCTIONS CONTROL THE OF THINGS THAT YOU WOULD DO ALL THE TIME 
SO 
SO UH YEAH IF WE COULD UH POWER ON AND CHANNEL SELECTION AND AND VOLUME SELECTION WOULDN'T HAVE TO REALLY 
YEAH AND PROBABLY IT WOULD LOOK BETTER AS WELL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LINED WITH NUMBERED BUTTONS AND 
OH YEAH YEAH THAT'S EVERYTHING 
DO YOU WANT THE CABLE 
F. EIGHT 
UH GIVE IT ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS OR SO 
YEAH 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
IT COULD HAVE LIKE UH KNOW LIKE A CORDLESS PHONE IN YOUR HAS TO US GOT LIKE A BASE THAT SITS THERE ALL THE TIME 
I SUPPOSE YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WE LOOK LIKE THIS UM THIS UH MARKET RESEARCH THING SAYS NUMBER OF TIMES PER HOUR THAT IT'S USED CHANNEL SELECTION A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT 
TIMES PER HOUR 
YEAH 
BUT THEN AGAIN IF YOU THINK IT OF THE AMOUNT OF YOU KNOW AMOUNT OF SO IT'S LIKE 
THAT'S IT'S LESS THAN A SECOND UM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH LIKE IN THE EMAIL OF TELEVISION ONLY 
IN FACT THEY'RE IN THE CONSTRAINTS EMAIL THAT I GOT 
DIDN'T YOU MENTION THE TELETEXT JUST TELEVISION ONLY 
OH OKAY 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
UM 
UM UP THERE WE GO 
'KAY I'LL JUST BE TALKING ABOUT THE COMPONENTS DESIGN 
AND 
OKAY BASICALLY I JUST UH LOOKED AT WHAT EXACTLY DO REMOTES DO 
UH BASICALLY THEY WAIT FOR YOU TO PRESS A KEY OR GIVE A VOICE COMMAND AND THEN THIS IS TRANSLATED UH NOT UH LIGHT SIGNALS WHICH ARE THEN SEEN BY THE T. V. 
UH THE MATERIALS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO LOOK AT UH THE TWO BIG ONES ARE THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIP AND THE BATTERY AND THE ONE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIP UH WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A A DIODE TRANSISTOR OR RESONATOR 
UH TWO MORE RESISTORS AND A CAPACITOR AND THE BATTERY WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A RESISTOR AND A CAPACITOR 
UM 
UH BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'LL PRESS A NUMBER OR GIVE A VOICE COMMAND AND THIS CREATES A A CONNECTION WITHIN THE THE REMOTE THAT ALLOWS THE CHIP THE CHIP THEN SENSES THIS CONNECTION AND PRODUCES A SIGNAL IN A MORSE CODE FORMAT 
THIS SIGNAL'S SENT TO THE TRANSISTOR WHICH AMPLIFIES IT AND THEN SENDS IT IN AT THE LIGHT EMITTING DIODE AND UH WHICH IS THEN TRAI CHANGED INTO A INFRARED LIGHT WHICH IS SENT TO THE T. V. AND SORT OF SEEN BY THE T. V. AND WHICH UH CHANGES THE CHANNELS 
UM 
OH 
OH COOL 
UH SO SO FOR HOW WE SHOULD END UP UH USING THIS IN OUR REMOTE UH T COUPLE OF MAIN QUESTIONS OR THE BUTTONS 
UH YOU THE FEWER BUTTONS YOU HAVE I GUESS THE FEWER INTERNAL CONNECTIONS AND INTERNAL CODES YOU'RE GONNA NEED 
UM 
HOWEVER UH TO N NOT HAVE BUTTONS ARE TO USE A VOICE COMMANDS INSTEAD OF BUTTONS MIGHT MAKE THESE CONNECTIONS MORE DIFFICULT AND UH REUSE THE PRODUCTION COST 
THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT 
ALSO WE HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE COMPANY CONSTRAINTS 
AND THE COMPANY HAS INFORMED ME VIA EMAIL THAT UH THEY'RE EXPERTS AT PUSHBUTTONS AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST UH COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF PRODUCING IT 
UM ALSO WITH BATTERY CONNECTIONS THE COMPANY HAS SOME LIMITS ON THE BATTERIES WE CAN SEE 
SO I WAS THINKING PERHAPS A COMBINATION OF SOLAR CELLS WITH A BACK UP BASIC BATTERY AND SOMEHOW BETWEEN THE COMBINATION OF THAT TWO WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT UH WILL LOST THE THE LIFETIME OR THE FIVE TO TEN YEARS AND WE COULD STILL KEEP THAT ORIGINAL IDEA 
UM WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE CHIPS UH V CUSTOM DESIGNED VERSUS OFF THE SHELF 
AND THE CUSTOM DESIGNED WILL GIVE US MUCH MORE FLEXIBILITY AND ENABLE US TO INCORPORATE THE VOICE FUNCTION THAT WE ALL UH SEEM TO HAVE AGREED UPON 
UM HOWEVER THAT'S GONNA COST MORE 
BUT UH THE OFF THE SHELF IS GONNA BE UH CHEAPER AND IT'S GONNA BE ALLOW US TO PRODUCE IT QUICKER AND GET OUT THERE FASTER 
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE LESS FLEXIBLE WITH THE FEATURES ESPECIALLY THINGS LIKE UH VOICE ACTIVATION 
WHICH HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN USED MUCH ON REMOTES SO THERE'S NOT REALLY CHIPS OUT THERE THAT WOULD BE EASY TO UH TO CONVERT 
SO IF WE WERE UH DEFINITELY GONNA GO WITH THE THE VOICE OPTION WE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO DESIGN UM OUR OWN CHIP 
AND THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT UP 
MM 
UH YEP SORRY 
YEP 
MM 
UM I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY PRICE INFORMATION ON 
UM IT A LOT LONGER THAN ON OFF THE SHELF CHIP 
UH W YEAH WE DID THE THE PROBLEM IS THE THE THE VOICE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT REALLY HIGHLY DEVELOPED 
IT'S SORT OF STILL STILL IN AN EX EXPERIMENTAL FORM 
UH IS IT WOULD UH IT'S HARD TO PREDICT THE TIME 
MM 
WE JUST TO TO INCORPORATE THE VOICE ACTIVATION IN IT IS IS SORTA THE TRICK 
ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE VOICE CHIP ON THEIR THEN IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE THE WORLD THE THE SKY IS YOUR LIMIT 
BUT IT ACTUALLY THE THE BIG STEP IS IT ACTUALLY GET THE VOICE ACTIVATION CHIPS IN THERE AND WORKING 
UH BITS OF IT YEAH 
YES AS WELL 
MM 
UH IT'S FUNDAMENT WELL I MEAN I GUESS IT IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE DISCUSSED UH SINCE THE THE SORT OF THE BEGINNING 
SO I TH I THINK IN ONE OR IN OUR MINDS IT'S IT'S FUNDAMENTAL 
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THE UH THE UPPER ECHELONS OF THE COMPANY WOULD NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THAT SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO 
HM 
MM MM 
MM 
NO THAT SOUNDS GOOD 
MM 
COOL 
UM 
YEAH I I WOULD SAY WE D YEAH 
UH NOPE THAT WAS IT THAT WAS IT 
OKAY 
YEAH IT'S THINKING ABOUT IT 
YEAH 
MM 
OH 
UH I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME COST REALLY 
I I MEAN I THINK IT'S JUST SORT OF THE THE THERE'S A LOT OF SLIDE BUTTONS OUT THERE 
I THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SORT OF CONNECTION 
MM YEAH 
MM 
MM 
Y YEAH 'CAUSE I'VE DEFINITELY PICKED UP REMOTES AND LIKE MEANT TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL AND TURN THE VOLUME 
OR VICE VERSA SO IT'D BE KINDA GOOD TO HAVE THEM BE FEEL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
YOU'D KNOW WHAT YOU WERE FIDDLING WITH 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 'CAUSE IF YEAH IN THAT KINDA POSITION THE FINGERS WOULD BE BETTER FOR PRESSING AND THE THAT FOR ROLLING JUST THE WAY IT WOULD 
MM YEAH YEAH YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
WELL THAT CAN KINDA IT INTO OUR CHANGING UH FACE THINGS 
LIKE WE COULD HAVE THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE THEME THIS YEAR AND UH WHATEVER HAPPENS NEXT YEAR WE CAN HAVE THE FACE PLATES YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM YEAH THAT WORD I DUNNO WHAT THAT IS BUT YEAH 
MM 
OH YEAH IT'S GOOD AS WELL 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
I 
I THINK IT'S EASIER SOMETIMES TO HAVE THEM BUY CHANGEABLE COVERS FOR IT THEN TO BUY A WHOLE NEW ONE 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE INVESTING IN A WHOLE NEW PRODUCT 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
OH YEAH 
I LIKE THAT 
THAT ALL C ALSO KIND OF ENCOURAGES 'EM TO BUY NEW COVERS AND YEAH 
UM 
OH YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
WELL THAT THAT'S JUST IT WITH THE COVERS 
YOU'RE SORT OF TRICKING 'EM INTO CONTINUING TO SPEND THEIR MONEY ON OUR PRODUCTS WITHOUT MAKING 'EM FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING RIPPED OFF HAVING TO BUY A NEW PRODUCT 
SO YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
MM YEAH 
MM 
AND THAT'S THE SORT OF THING ONCE YOU GET THE MOULD SET YOU CAN JUST WHIP OUT DIFFERENT COLOURS DIFFERENT PICTURES VERY VERY QUICKLY 
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY EXACTLY 
YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
I DUNNO THAT WE SHOULD MAKE THE WHOLE THING YELLOW I KINDA THOUGHT WITH A YOU'D HAVE LIKE A YELLOW CIRCLE WITH THE R. R. ON IT SOMEWHERE ON IT 
BUT I'D YELLOW SEEMS A BIT OF A STRONG COLOUR TO MAKE THE NOT LIKE THE THING ON 
BUT I MEAN JUST LIKE WHAT ARE GREY OR BLACK OR SOME SORT OF BLAH COLOUR 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU'D WANT IT NARROWER THAN A MOUSE THOUGH 'CAUSE IT A MOUSE YOU'RE KINDA JUST RESTING ON IT YOU WANT SOMETHING YOU CAN DEFINITELY GRIP 
SO MAYBE IT'D BE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND FIDDLE AROUND WITH IT AND PRESS IT 
MAYBE ALMOST LIKE A HAIRBRUSH 
LIKE YOU COULD GET THE ABOUT THE WIDTH OF THAT AND OF THE PEN AND THEN IT WIDENS UP TOP AND YOU CAN FIDDLE AN YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH COOL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
BUT DO YOU KNOW THIS SHAPE ALSO KIND OF LES LEND ITSELF TO TO VOICE 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE YOU'RE HOLDING IT AND YOU'RE FIDDLING 
BUT YOU CAN ALSO BRING IT UP LIKE THAT AND IT'S MICROPHONE ESQUE YEAH YEAH 
MM 
BU 
MM 
WELL YOU CAN STILL I INCORPORATE THE VOICE WITH WITH LESS BUTTONS 
I MEAN UH OF THE POWER BUTTON WAS ALSO SOMEHOW LIKE A MENU BUTTON YOU COULD PRESS THAT AND OR DO VOICE COMMANDS 
AND EITHER VOLUME THING COULD ALSO BE TO SCROLL THROUGH OTHER OPTIONS LIKE YOU AND YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH BRIGHTNESS AND AND SC AND THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN MINIMISE THE BUTTONS AND STILL HAVE THIS 
YOU KNOW BRIGHTNESS AND TINT AND STUFF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT THE TELEVISION WOULD BE THE DISPLAY THAT THINGS LIKE THAT USUALLY C POP UP IN A TELEVI LIKE YOU HIT MENU AND MENU WILL COME UP ON TELEVISION AND HAVE LIKE TINT BRIGHTNESS 
AND YOU'D USE THE SCROLL SCROLL THROUGH IT YEAH 
YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW THAT WORKED THOUGH BUT YEAH 
YEAH MM 
MM K YEAH 
YEAH 
COOL 
PLAY WITH PLAY DOUGH 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM DOES ACTUALLY YEAH YEAH 
MM DIFFERENT TO FEEL YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEP YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH MM 
MM 
YEP SOUNDS GOOD 
'KAY 
'KAY 
I 
I JUST HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT 
UM DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF THERE ARE JUST A FEW COMMANDS 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU UM CAN PRE PROGRAMME IN LIKE NUMBERS ONE THROUGH TEN AND PRE PROGRAMME SAY YOU KNOW 
NINE CHANNELS AND THEN JUST USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO SAY CHANNEL ONE AND THEN YOU'VE PROGRAMMED IN SAY B. B. C. FOR US YOUR CHANNEL ONE 
SO YOUR FAVOURITE IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FAVOURITES UM AND THAT WE 
OKAY 
THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OF COURSE MOBILE PHONES DO TEND TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS OR SOMETHING 
AS OPPOSED TO THE TWENTY EUROS TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL ANOTHER THOUGHT I UH SORRY GO AHEAD 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL I KINDA THINK IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PART OF IT THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE TO FOR THE WHOLE THING 
AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AT THE WHOLE TIME 
ANYWAY I'M I'M INCLI KINDA INCLINED TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD JUST GO FOR IT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I THINK SO 
OKAY 
LET'S SEE 
OH 
YES 
SO IT GONNA WORK 
OKAY 
OKAY SO I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND UM WHAT YOU KNOW THE INTERF USER INTERFACE OR JUST ASPECTS THAT ARE SEEN BY USERS 
UM COMMANDS AND MECHANISMS FOR THE OPERATION AND THERE'RE JUST KIND OF A VARIETY OF CHOICES 
UM FINDINGS 
IS A LOT OF TIMES THEY TEND TO LOOK CLUTTERED AND THESE WERE JUST A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF UM DIFFERENT KINDS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE UNUSUAL 
THERE'RE SOME SPECIAL ONES AVAILABLE LIKE THIS ONE RIGHT HERE WHICH IS MARKETED TOWARDS CHILDREN 
UM DIFFERENT DESIGNS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ONE WE NEED TO WATCH TOO FAR AS A V. IN VOLUME BECAUSE PEOPLE SOME 
BRING A LITTLE PICTURE OF WHAT I THOUGHT OURS COULD LOOK LIKE 
SO JUST KIND OF MINIMISE THE CLUTTER 
AVOID TOO MANY BUTTONS AND ALSO UM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID IS A SLIDE BUTTON LIKE YOU HAVE IN A MOUSE 
THAT POSSIBLY WE COULD USE THAT IN THE SIDES FOR VOLUME FOR EXAMPLE HAVE THE SLIDE BUTTON ON THE SIDE 
AND THEN YOU CAN PRE PROGRAMME THE CHANNELS THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND THEN THE VOICE RESPONSE SAMPLE LOCATOR 
JUST BECAUSE I IN FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M USING A MOUSE I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SLIDE IT UP AND DOWN SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR VOLUME IT JUST BE ABLE TO KIND OF ROLL IT AND THEN HAVE THE UP AND DOWN AND THEN TH THIS IS MY GREAT LITTLE DRAWING 
Y YES YES 
YEAH 
THE ONLY ADVANTAGE I WAS THINKING OF IT HAVING THE BUTTONS LIKE THE BUTTONS ON ONE SIDE FOR THE CHANNEL 
AND THEN THE SLIDER IS THAT IF YOU'RE JUST HOLDING IN YOUR HAND AND YOU PICK IT UP 
IT'S EASY TO ONE IS KNOW OKAY THIS IS JUST THE VOLUME AND THIS IS THE CHANNEL 
YEAH 
THAT WAS 
YEAH 
UM WELL I WAS THINKING KIND OF JUST FOR THE VOLUME BUT WHAT WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK 
WE COULD 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'M JUST GONNA PASS THIS LONG 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH LIKE THE KINDA YOU GET IN LIKE HAND WEIGHTS 
YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF SPONGY YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
WOAH 
WHAT IF WE INCLUDED THE BATTERIES IN THE COVER 
SO UM LIKE 
YEAH SO CAN I SEE THAT THING 
JUST THIS IS EXAMPLES 
SO IF 
YEAH I GUESS THAT'S 
TRUE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH JUST ANOTHER FIVE EURO TO GET 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH LIKE THEY HAVE FOR MOBILE PHONES THAT ARE JUST FRUITS AND ANIMAL PRINTS AND COLOURS 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH LIKE ONE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL NO 
WELL I WAS SORT OF MM KINDA PICTURING LIKE MAYBE UM A SHAPE THAT'S ALMOST LIKE A MOUSE 
SO THAT YOU KNOW 
WHEN THEY HOLD IT IT'S BECAUSE A MOUSE IS PRETTY COMFORTABLE TO HOLD ON YOUR HAND UM MAYBE WE COULD MAKE IT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SHAPE SO THEY COULD HOLD ON IT IT 
BUT THAT WAY THEY CAN HAVE THE VOLUME ON THE SIDE AND THEN THE CHANNEL BUTTONS AND 
HAVE THE POWER WHEREVER SOMEWHERE 
I MEAN THAT WAS JUST AN IDEA THAT I HAD 
YEAH 
YEAH MAYBE 
KIND OF A C 
YEAH 
SORT OF A COMBINATION 
YEAH 
YEAH SO YEAH KIND OF MAYBE MAYBE A LITTLE WIDER THAN THIS 'CAUSE THIS IS PRETTY COMFORTABLE TO HOLD AND THEN IF YOU HAD 
YEAH THEN WIDER UP HERE 
AND THEN IT WOULD HAVE A L UH WIDER THING TO UH HAVE THE LIGHT 
THE INFRARED LIGHT AT THE T. V. AND JUST KINDA CHANGE CHANNELS AND ADJUST THE VOLUME AND THE POWER COULD BE WHEREVER UP UP THE TOP OR SOMETHING 
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THAT 
OH YEAH 
IT IS A VERY GOOD POINT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND JUST SAY 
YEAH I SUPPOSE I SUP 
SO I GUESS WE COULD HAVE A MENU BUTTON AS WELL 
WE COULD HAVE THE CHANNELS AND THE POWER AND THEN A MENU BUTTON AND THEN THE VOLUME 
SO HAVE FOUR BUTTONS AND THE VOLUME INSTEAD OF OTHER BUTTONS AND THE VOLUME 
YEAH THAT'S IN THE T. V. YEAH 
YEAH AND THEN YOU 
YEAH PRESS THAT IS IT YEAH THAT MIGHT WORK 
YEAH IT'S LIKE UM YEAH IT'S LIKE THE MOUSE WHERE YOU JUST KINDA CLICK IT 
YOU JUST PRESS IT 
YEAH AND YOU COULD JUST CLICK THAT IT IS IF YOU HAD LIKE THE MENU THEN YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH AND THEN CLICK IT TO SELECT 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK SO IT 
YEAH AND ESPECIALLY FOR MAKING THEM IS LIKE DIFFERENT AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LIKE THIS OR LIKE THIS 
YEAH KINDA LIKE THIS WHOLE 
SO YOU COULD USE LIKE THIS AND IT WOULD GO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT THIS THIRD MEETING OF THE UH UH DESIGN GROUP 
UM I THINK WE UH MADE SOME DEFINITE PROGRESS AT THE LAST ONE UM AND COME UP WITH SOME INTERESTING UH UH W SUGGESTIONS FOR OUR OUR NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
UM I'LL AGAIN VERY QUICKLY UH JUST PRESENT SOME NOTES OF THAT MEETING 
UM THE THE THE PROBLEM WITH EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS WE FELT WAS THAT THEY'RE UGLY UM AND THAT PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO PAY A PREMIUM FOR SOMETHING BETTER 
UM THEY'VE GOT LOTS OF BUTTONS ON THEM THAT UH PEOPLE DON'T USE AND FIND DIFFICULT TO LEARN 
UM AND PEOPLE LOSE THEM 
AND 
WE WE THOUGHT THAT F FOR OUR OUR NEW UH UH REMOTE CONTROL THAT EVERYBODY WILL WANT TO RUSH OUT AND BUY 
UM THAT WE'RE WE SHOULD LOOK AT SPEECH RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RA RATHER THAN BUTTONS 
AND THAT IF WE HAVE ANY BUTTONS THEY SHOULD BE VERY FEW OF THEM AND ONLY FOR THESE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED THAT THAT PEOPLE USE 
THAT UM WE WANT TO GO FOR UH A LONG LASTING BATTERY THAT WE GO WE GUARANTEE FOR THE LIFE OF THE UH UH THE PRODUCT AND A SHAPE THAT WILL BE INSTANTLY RECOGNISABLE 
I. UM SO UH A TRENDY REMOTE CONTROL AND AND B. IS UH A REAL REACTION PRODUCT 
SO THAT WE UH WHEN PEOPLE ARE UH HAPPY WITH THAT THEY WILL THEY WILL WANT TO BUY UH EVERYTHING ELSE FROM US 
OH 
OKAY 
SO AGAIN UM 
I'LL WE'LL HAVE THE THREE THREE PRESENTATIONS FROM THE THE THE OTHER IF YOU AND THEN UH WE'LL WE'LL MAKE A A FINAL A FINAL UH DECISION 
UM AND THE THE DECISIONS THAT WE NEED TO TO MAKE TODAY FINALLY 
OR UM WHAT ENERGY SOURCE WE WANT TO SEE WHETHER I IT IS PRACTICAL TO USE UH UM 
A A A LONG LASTING ONE 
AND UH I I THINK OUR DISCUSSION WAS AROUND THE FACT THAT UH IF WE'RE GONNA GO FOR UH A LONG LASTING POWER SUPPLY 
THEN BASICALLY IT'S UH SEALED FOR LIFE AND UH IF ANYBODY DOES MANAGE TO RUN ON DOWN WE'LL WE'LL GIVE THEM ANOTHER ONE 
AND UH IT IT'LL BE UH YOU KNOW PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED AS PART OF THE THE THE ADVERTISING LITERATURE THAT IT'S UM UM 
YOU KNOW FOR LIFE GUARANTEED FOR LIFE 
UM NOW THE THE THE INTERNAL CHIP UM AND UH THIS IS WHERE I AND UH UH KATE'S EXPERT ADVICE AND GIVEN THAT TH THIS HAS TO TO GO TO MARKET AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE UM D D DO WE GO FOR A CUSTOM DESIGNED CHIP 
OR OR DO WE BY ON OFF THE SHELF AND AND PROGRAMME IT OURSELVES 
UH I MEAN I'M I'M I'M 
NO NOT AN EXPERT ON THESE THINGS BUT PRESUMABLY THERE MUST BE LOADS OF 'EM ALREADY ON THE MARKET THAT WE CAN MODIFY 
BUT UH THAT THAT'S UH THAT'S YOUR AREA OF EXPERTISE 
AND THEN THE UH YOU KNOW THE THE OVERALL DESIGN OF THE CASE UH IS IS IS KENDRA'S FIELD AND UH 
WE WE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS LAST TIME IS IS IT UH HOW WE MIGHT GO FORWARD AND WE'LL WE'LL FINALISE THOSE 
UH DA TODAY 
UM AND THE THIS IS ALL LINKED IN WITH THE THE THE USER INTERFACE WHETHER WE P UM 
GO FOR VOICE BUTTONS OR OR A BIT OF BOTH 
OH 
AND THEN UH YOU KNOW IF FOR THE NEXT MEETING KATE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE THE THE USE THE LOOK 
FEEL AND DESIGN KENDRA THE UH 
UH HOW THE THE USER ACTUALLY USES IT AND AND ANDREW OF COURSE THE THE PRODUCT EVALUATION 
AND UH KATE AND KENDRA WILL BE PRODUCING A A MODEL FOR US TO UH TO LOOK AT 
UH SO IF IF WE CAN HAVE THE THE THREE PRESENTATIONS AGAIN PLEASE AND UH UM P PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO START AH OK 
KATE 
UH I'M SORRY UH SORRY 
OKAY SO HOW UM SORRY CAN YOU UH JUST PUT THAT ONE BACK UP AGAIN PLEASE 
UM 
UH D D D OKAY I MEAN UH INEVITABLY A B A CUSTOM DESIGN CHIP IS GONNA BE MORE EXPENSIVE 
DO WE DO WE KNOW UH BY HOW MUCH 
AND AND DO WE KNOW HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE IT UH DEVELOP A A CUSTOM CHIP 
RIGHT OKAY 
RIGHT I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE A A DECISION HERE 
UH GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WANTS THIS IN THE MARKET QUICKLY AND CHEAPLY 
THAT WOULD APPEAR TO UH EFFECTIVELY CONSTRAIN US TO AN EXISTING CHIP AND THUS THEREFORE CONVENTIONAL BUTTON TECHNOLOGY 
UM UH NOW BEFORE WE GO ROUND EVERYBODY ELSE DOES ANYBODY UM 
UH HAVE ANY HAVE ANYTI HA ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT 
CASE UH I MUST SAY I FOUND OUT SLIGHTLY SURPRISING GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW MOBILE PHONES INCORPORATE VOICE ACTIVATED DIALLING 
SO UH UM I MEAN I D D FOR SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WELL NO I MEAN IT'S IF YOU YOU 
SPEAK SOMEBODY'S NAME AND IT'LL DIAL THE NUMBER FOR YOU 
SO UH B I MEAN TH THIS THIS INFORMATION IS FROM IS THIS IS THE INTERNAL COMPANY INFORMATION IS IT 
SO UH 
YEAH MM TRUE AGAIN BUT IF IT'S WITHOUT ANY WITHOUT ANY UH P PRICE INFORMATIONS THAT'S UH DIFFICULT TO UH 
UH DECIDE 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT 
IT'S LIKE IT'S IT'S YOU CAN'T 'CAUSE MOBILE PHONES ARE EXPENSIVE YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S THE VOICE RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS 
BUT WE DON'T KNOW 
UM 
I MEAN UH 
I SEE I I MEAN IF GIVEN THAT THE UM THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT WELL DEVELOPED AND AND GIVEN THAT IT'S IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE 
UM THE THE THE DOUBLE RISK 
UH PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO UH STICK TO UH TO BUTTONS SINCE THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS PRESENT A PRODUCT THAT DOESN'T WORK 
UM 
THOUGHTS 
I MEAN DO WE DO WE THINK THAT THE VOICE TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE PROJECT 
I MEAN I THINK WE 
MM 
YEAH I I I I I THINK THAT'S UH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM RIGHT OKAY 
YEAH IT SHOULD BE 
RIGHT OKAY SO 
FINE 
OKAY 
I IT WILL HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION UM UH IF IF THAT MEANS UH OF THAT MEANS WE CAN'T AFFORD BUTTONS BUT I MEAN B B SECOND QUESTION 
DO WE NEED THE FIVE BUTTONS FOR CHANNEL CHANGE UP DOWN VOLUME UP DOWN AND ON OFF 
JUST AS A A BACKUP OR JUST SO THAT PEOPLE CAN UH J J JUST SIT THERE PRESSING BUTTONS 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
SORRY D DID YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING 
NO 
OKAY 
SHALL WE MOVE RAPIDLY ON IT UH KENDRA 
UH UM RA RAPIDLY MOVE THE CABLE OVER 
MM 
OH GOOD 
MM YEAH IT'LL GET THERE 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
UH-HUH 
ALRIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
SORRY Y Y YEAH IF I CAN INTERRUPT YOU 
WELL D P 'KAY DO YOU WANNA SAY ANYTHING ABOUT UM SLIDE CONTROLS 
I MEAN I THINK THE REASON EVERYBODY USES PUSHBUTTONS IS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE SI SIMPLE CHIP AND RELIABLE 
OKAY FAIR ENOUGH FINE 
YEAH 
GOOD GOOD 
YEAH 
SO THERE THERE THERE'S OTHER BUTTONS ON A SLIDER 
THREE BUTTONS CHANNEL UP CHANNEL UP DOWN AND 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
UM 
MM-HMM 
THIS ONE ON THE ONE SIDE AND ONE YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OR YEAH UH TH TH TH I MEAN TH THIS IS WHAT THE WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH IS THE THE ACTUAL SHAPE THAT PEOPLE CAN INS INSTANTLY PICK IT UP AND AND KNOW KNOW UH KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO 
OKAY SO WE WE'RE LOOKING AT SLIDERS FOR BOTH A UH VOLUME AND CHANNEL CHANGE 
IF ONE SORT 
JUST FOR THE VOLUME UH 
FINGERS YEAH 
I MEAN IT'S IT'S 
IT YEAH I MEAN IT IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT UH TO UH ET AL ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT IT AT THE TWO OR CLEARLY DIFFERENT 
UM THAT THERE'S NO NO POSSIBILITY OF UH CONFUSING THE TWO 
SO OKAY 
RIGHT SO UH THAT'S SORRY IS THAT THAT ALL YOU WANT TO SAY AT THE UM OKAY FINE 
MM RIGHT 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
WELL I I MEAN I TH I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING OUGHT TO ADDRESS ALL THREE OF THIS 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
MM I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT THAT'S DIFFERENT CERTAINLY 
WHAT 
YEAH 
OH 
OH 
ALSO MEANS YOU CAN DROP IT WITHOUT DAMAGING IT 
I I MEAN IT ITS UH I THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA IT'S LIKE THE OLD SWATCH WATCH WHERE UH UM NO ONLY BATTERIES EVER GOT CHANGED IN THIS 
'CAUSE PEOPLE JUST BOUGHT A NEW ONE WHEN IT WENT OUT OF FASHION BUT IT'S JUST NEVER BEEN SOON AS A A FASHION ITEM BEFORE 
UM THAT'S YES IF IF IF THEY'RE MADE IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY 
W I MEAN WE WE CAN UH UH B BUT I MEAN MY FEELING IS THAT CURRENT POWER SOURCES ARE SUCH THAT FOR RELATIVELY LITTLE COST YOU CAN MAKE IT LOST 
YOU KNOW A LONG TIME 
UM BUT IF WE ALSO MAKE IT CHEAP ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE EITHER CHANGE THE COVER EVERY YEAR OR EVEN BUY A NEW ONE EVERY YEAR THEN IT IT'S IT'S EVEN BETTER 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
I NO I KNOW THE ONLY P I MEAN THE THE THE THE IMMEDIATE THING THAT COMES TO MIND WITH THAT IS THAT IT TO TO YOU YOU'VE THEN GET THE CONNECTION AND YOU'VE IMMEDIATELY GOT A SORT OF UNRELIABILITY 
WHEREAS THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING IT PLUMBED IN IS THAT THAT THE WHOLE THING IS ALL YOU KNOW 
COMPLETELY SOLDERED TOGETHER AND IT TO TO YOU KNOW TOTAL RELIABILITY BUT I MEAN I D I I UH 
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND UH UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM 
I TH I SEE I THINK IF WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN THAT ROUTE THEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UH EVEN IF IT COSTS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THAT 
UM JUST BUILDING THE WHOLE THING IN IN THAN HAVING GETTING CHEAPER PRODUCTION COSTS UM AND 
YOU KNOW GIVING PEOPLE THE OPTION OF BUYING A NEW UH A A COMPLETE NEW THING 
THE ADVANTAGE OF A REPLACEABLE COVER IS THAT EVEN IF THEY DON'T IT DOESN'T HAVE A COVER ON IT ALL IT WILL STILL WORK UM TOTALLY 
UM THEN IF YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE LOSE THE COVER 
I MEAN THEY THEY MIGHT BE WELL INCLINED TO GO OUT AND SPEND HOWEVER MANY EUROS ON A IN A NEW ONE UM RATHER THAN A A COMPLETE NEW R REMOTE 
YEAH I MEAN IT SO IT'S UP IT IT'S UP TO 
YEAH IT'S IT'S UP TO OUR MARKETING PEOPLE TO TO ME TOO MA TURN IT INTO A A FASHION ITEM 
UM AND YOU KNOW AS AS EXTERNAL FASHIONS CHANGE THEN WE GOT NEW NEW COVERS ON THE MARKET AND YOU KNOW READILY AVAILABLE 
AND UM 
THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT YEAH YEAH 
SO UH I SEE UH OKAY 
UM RIGHT SORRY 
UM WE HADN'T FINISHED YOUR 
IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE PROMINENT DIS DISPLAYED ON THEIR UM COFFEE TABLE TO SAY THIS SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT UM 
UM THIS IS FASHIONABLE 
I YOU KNOW I'M I'M I'M WITH IT I'M UP TO DATE 
AND YOU KNOW THE THE THE DESIGN THAT I'VE GOT AND AND IT COULD BE A A HOME MADE DESIGN 
UM YOU KNOW THIS SAYS THIS IS NOT JUST A A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL THIS IS YOU KNOW A FASHION ACCESSORY 
UM 
SO I MEAN THE THE THE BASIC SHAPE I SEE SO WHAT WE UH I MEAN GIVEN THAT WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW ON ON ON OFF BUTTON PRESUMABLY 
TWO BUTTONS FOR UH CHANNEL CHANGE AND ONE SLIDER AND BASICALLY NOTHING ELSE UM WE WE NEED TO DECIDE ON THE JUST THE BASIC SHAPE OF THE THING 
AND KNOW WHETHER WE GO DOWN THE FRUIT AND VEG ROUTE AND I DON'T SUGGEST WE MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A BANANA 
BUT UM KNOW SORT OF THE THE ORGANIC 
YOU KNOW CURVED LIKE YOU KNOW IT TO DELIBERATELY GET AWAY FROM THE UH UM UH YOU KNOW 
THE THE THE THE SQUARE LOOK OF MOST UM CURRENT UH REMOTES AND 
YOU KNOW WHETHER WHETHER THE YOU KNOW THE THE FIXED PART OF IT IS THE CORPORATE YELLOW 
UM 
MM OR UH 'CAUSE THERE'S CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THE THE CORPORATE LOGO NEEDS TO BE PROMINENTLY UH DISPLAYED SO THAT PEOPLE USE THE LOOKED AT IT AND SAY RIGHT 
THAT'S A REAL REACTION REMOTE CONTROL I WANT ONE OF THIS 
YEAH UH THE THE UH OR OR B 
YEAH I'D I'D UM YEAH 
OH NO I D I I AGREE I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SIMPLY IT'S SIMPLY REQUIRED TO INCORPORATE THE THE THE THE CORPORATE LOGO PROMINENTLY UM 
WELL TH THIS IS THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT YES YOU KNOW 
I'M I'VE GOT A A REAL REACTION UH REMOTE CONTROL TO GO WITH MY REAL REACTION COFFEE MAKER OR OR WHATEVER 
AND UH THEN PEOPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE DEMAND MORE REAL REACTION STUFF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I MEAN I'VE UH YEAH 
UH IN THAT WELL THERE'S THE SAME MY MY IDEA WAS SOMETHING A B PROBABLY YOU KNOW A BIT FATTER THAN THIS ABOUT SORT OF THE THAT SORTA SHAPE IS THAT YOU CAN JUST SORT OF HO HOLD IT 
W IT I MEAN WELL IT'S SORT OF IT'S IT'S SORT OF UH A A MOUSE BUT HELD 
YOU KNOW SO IT'S YOU SORTA HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND LIKE THAT I WITH YOU KNOW AND FIDDLING WITH THE BUTTONS 
OKAY YEAH YEAH 
IT'S A VERY GOOD POINT 
I THINK WE DO I THINK WE DECIDED THAT WE WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING DOWN BOTH ROUTES 
THAT UM THE W ONE WE NEED THE THE MANUAL CONTROLS AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE OF THAT FROM ABOUT THAT UH YEAH 
THEN YOU JUST BRING IT UP TO YOUR MOUTH AND JUST SPEAK TO TO YEAH YEAH 
I TH I TH HONEST UH MY PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT IF IT'S NOT OTHER PEOPLE WOULDN'T IS IT ANYWAY UM 
IT'S CUR IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE I MEAN 
BUT THEY W WE'RE GOING BEYOND W W GIVEN THE STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY WE WANT SOMETHING THAT WE KNO WE KNOW WILL WILL WORK UM 
OH 
YEAH 
IF WE WE'RE I MEAN I'M GETTING A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THOSE FACILITIES AVAILABLE 
UH UH UH 
OKAY IF WE IF WE'RE GOING DOWN THAT ROUTE THEN 
WE NEED SOME SORT OF DISPLAY 
DO WE NEED SOME SORT OF DISPLAY 
WE ACTUALLY IS THE TELEVISION OKAY 
OKAY OKAY OKAY 
YEP 
MM YEAH 
OKAY WE GOT FIVE MINUTES TO GO ON THIS MEETING 
SO UM I D I THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY VERY CONVENIENTLY JUST UH COME TO UH A GOOD POINT TO USE TO SUM UP UM 
SO UM B B KATE AND KENDRA NOW GO AWAY AND UH PA PLAY PLAY WITH A BIT OF PLASTICINE OR PLAY DOUGH 
WHATEVER IT IS IN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC 
UM AND ACTUALLY PUT WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED INTO SOMETHING UH I WAS GONNA SAY CONCRETE 
BUT THAT'S A SLIGHTLY INAPPROPRIATE WORD AIM AT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WE CAN USE AND UM ANDREW N CAN GO AWAY AND TH TH THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN UH ACTUALLY MARKET THIS IS A CONCEPT AND NOT J NOT JUST A UH UM A A SIMPLE REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH CERTAINLY OF COURSE 
I THINK I THINK WE DECIDED THAT WE'RE GONNA FOR FOR SIMPLICITY OF YOU KNOW 
MANUFACTURING AND UH MAINTENANCE THAT WE WILL GO FOR A A LONG TERM BATTERY SOURCE UM 
I YOU KNOW IN THE BASIS THAT UM THAT YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING FOR MAKING IT A FASHION STATEMENT 
THEN UH PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO CHANGE IT ANYWAY UH BEFORE I IT RUNS OUT AND UM MAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT WE WE CAN AIM FOR A BATTERY THAT WILL LAST MOST PEOPLE FOR UH WE'LL SAY AT LEAST FIVE FIVE TEN YEARS AND THAT WE'LL WE WE WILL GUARANTEE IT FOR FOUR FIVE YEARS UM 
WE'RE HAVING A 
A CUSTOM CHIP BUT GIVEN THE THE WE'VE CUT THE FUNCTIONS DOWN UM THAT WILL HOPEFULLY NOT BE TOO PROBLEMATIC 
BUT GIVEN THAT UM TECHNOL TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS IMPORTANT THAN WE NEED TO I'LL SAY IT AGAIN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATE 
UM AND UH WE WE KNOW WE MUST RESIST ANY EFFORTS TO UH TO TRY AND WATER THAT DOWN UM 
I I INTERCHANGEABLE CASE SEEMS TO BE UM UM IMPORTANT TO THE CONCEPT 
UM IT IT SHOULD BE CHEAP YOU KNOW IF IF WE AVOID ANY YOU KNOW ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS 
AND UH I YOU KNOW I IF WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME WAY OF OF ALLOWING PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY PERSONALISE IT UH TO WHATEVER THEY WANT 
THEN UH I MEAN UH UH THIS IS TOTALLY NOW 
WE DO WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
THAT OUT WHAT EXTENT PEOPLE DO IT OR NOT BUT IF THEY'VE AT LEAST GET A A GOOD SELECTION OF UM COVERS THAT THEY CAN USE ANYWAY 
AND UH AND IF IF WE CAN KEEP THEM YOU KNOW ROLLING THEN UH YOU KNOW 
SO THEY CAN GET THEM IN THE SUPERMARKET WHEN THEY GO DOWN TO ME A ANY OF THE FAMOUS SUPERMARKETS I WON'T MENTION ANY MENTION ANY NAMES 
UM IT'S UH IT'S GOOD FOR THE SUPERMARKET AND IT'S GOOD FOR US AND IT HOPEFULLY MAKES THEM FEEL BETTER 
UM THE THAT I MEAN THAT'S ONE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SO FEW BUTTONS THAT IT THAT ACTUALLY MAKES THAT REDUNDANT 
YEAH YEAH 
AND THE YOU KNOW THAT THAT SOLVES ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF BE OF BATTERY LIFE 
'CAUSE THAT WOULD WELL THAT WOULD CLOBBER THE BATTERY LIFE USE ONE 
I MEAN GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE BUTTONS WE'RE HAVING IT'S ACTUALLY UH UH UNNECESSARY I THINK 
SO UH AS WIDE CER CERTAINLY WIDER ANGLE THAN THAN CURRENT IS THAT IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT YOU KNOW 
ANYWAY LIKE YOU'RE LIKELY TO AND UH IT'S UH YOU KNOW I I IT WILL WORK MOST OF THE TIME UM 
NOT LIKE MY MY MUM WHO POINTS AT AT THE CEILING AND WONDERS WHY THE THE THE THE TELEVISION DOESN'T WORK 
UM YEAH I MEAN I D I TH I SORTA ENVISAGED THAT IF IF THIS WAS THE THE THING 
THEN SORT OF THE THE WHOLE OF THE TOP WOULD BE THE UH THE INFRARED UH 
UM SO 
YEAH 'CAUSE I MEAN THE R REALITY IS PEOPLE ARE THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THE TELEVISION WHILST THEY'RE USING IT 
THE CHANCES ARE SO IF IF THEY'RE HOLDING IT ANYWAY 
TH THEY'RE REASONABLY LIKELY TO BE HOLDING IT TO USE IT THEN UH THEN THAT THAT'S THE SORT OF COVERAGE THAT WE WANT 
UM OKAY D WE'RE ALL CLEAR WHERE WE GO FROM HERE 
OKAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND I'LL SEE SO YOU ALL AGAIN IN THIRTY MINUTES 
ALSO LOTS OF MOBILE PHONES HAVE GOT A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THEM NOT JUST THAT IS 
WOULD 
UH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY MAYB MAYBE IT SH 
LIKE UM 
MAYBE WE CAN LIKE CUT CORNERS SOMEWHERE ELSE TO BRING IN OVER COST 
OH YEAH IT'S THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT TO USERS THAT THE DEVICE SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
FROM UH MY PRESENTATION SHOW US 
UH TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
MM 
WELL IF YOU GO IF YOU IF YOU GOT A CHANNEL UP DOWN WE CAN HAVE A SLIDER IN THAT AS WELL 
BECAUSE IF IT IF YOU IN IF YOU NOTICE ON THE THING TO TO KIND OF LIKE HAS GOT KIND OF IF YOU YOU KNOW IT IS KIND OF LIKE STICKS 
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN UP LIKE N NOT IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
SO IT KINDA GOES UP ON THEN YOU LIKE YOU CAN KEEP ROLLING IT UP BUT IT'S LIKE LIKE LIKE LIKE A COG OR SOMETHING 
SO YOU KINDA TAKE IT UP ON IT A TIME 
DO 
OH 
UH YOU COULD YOU COULD USE L AS LIKE A MOUSE YOU COULD 
YEAH LIKE THE SHAPE OF IT ALMOST LIKE A MOUSE WITH A 
DEP 
I DUNNO IF IT DEPENDING ON THE FINAL SHAPE OF IT 'CAUSE YOU COULD HAVE LIKE 
I DUNNO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN C CONTROL THE VOLUME WITH YOUR THUMB AND THEN YOU COULD CONTROL THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR FINGERS 
OH YEAH YEAH 
HERE WE GO 
OH YEAH THIS IS MY REPORT ON TREND WATCHING 
THE DATA'S COME OFF INTERNET UH FROM EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR US IN THE TOP THREE THINGS WANTED BY THE CONSUMER 
AND WE GOT REPORTS FROM PARIS MILAN ON NEW FASHIONS 
AND UH 
THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THE L THE LIKE IT HAS TO LOOK FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
UH INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL 
THIS IS A SET WELL I WAS GONNA SAY YEAH TWICE AS IMPORTANT IS THE SECOND ASPECT WHICH IS THE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOV INNOVATIVE UM SIDE OF IT 
SO UH AND THE THIRD BEING EASY TO USE IS PROBABLY A GIVEN WE HAVE TO TRY AND INCORPORATE SO UH 
UH EXACTLY YEAH 
I SEE THAT OUT OF SEQUENCE 
OH YEAH SORRY 
OH YEAH AND UH FROM THE FASHION WATCHERS FROM MILAN AND PARIS HAVE SAID FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE AN IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHES AND FURNITURE AND SHOES 
ET CETERA 
OH SORRY CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE 
AND UH 
A SPONGY MATERIAL TO BE USED IN THE ON THE OUTSIDE 
YEAH 
BUT UH I WAS GONNA SAY UM YEAH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES UH IMPORTANT TO THIS YEAR UM IMPORTANT TO FURNITURE I'M JUST GONNA SAY 
UH OF LIKE IT'S ONE OF OF FASHION IF WE'RE GOING FOR THE IT LOOKS FANCY THEN FASHION IS OBVIOUSLY THE LINE WE GOTTA BE GOING THROUGH 
BUT FASHIONS DO DON'T LAST VERY LONG 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH WE CAN HAVE A SP LIKE A SPONGY SKIN ON IT AND THEN WE CAN JUST WHIP THAT OFF AND 
A KIND OF YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
THAT'S C COOL 
UM YOU HAVE WE COULD 
IF WE COULD SAVE DEPENDING ON THE COST OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF YOU KNOW 
COULD WE HAVE UH A CHEAPER B CHEAPER POWER SOURCE AND THEN JUST HAVE IT ANNUALLY RENEWED 
INSTEAD OF HAVING A TEN YEAR GUARANTEE 
WITH INTERCHANGEABLE COVERS COULD JUST BUY A NEW ONE EVERY YEAR A NEW ONE WHEN NEW FASHIONS COME OUT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OR WELL BUT LIKE UH LIKE MORE THAN JUST THE BATTERY LIKE A COMPLETE DIFFERENT LIKE YOU'VE ONLY GOT LIKE 
YOU KNOW LIKE THE UH THIS BIT'S THE BUT YOU KEEP AND THIS IS THE EXPENSIVE BUT THIS IS LIKE THE CHIP AND THIS IS THE MICROPHONE 
AND THEN THIS IS THE POWER SOURCE AND THE BIT EVERYONE SEES 
AND THEN 
YEAH YOU PROBABLY ARE RIGHT 
UM UH DON'T WORRY IT'S ALL SAID I WAS JUST GONNA SAY OH YEAH 
ARE WE GONNA MAKE THIS IS PART OF LIKE LIKE UH A PART OF THE F LOOK AT AT THE FASHIONS APPLY TO FURNITURE 
SO ARE WE GONNA MAKE THIS PART OF THE FURNITURE 
YEAH 
THIS IS FASHIONABLE WITH 
OH YEAH 
AND MAKE THAT A FASHION SYMBOL AS WELL 
YEAH THAT SOUNDS 
UM I'M JUST I'M SUDDENLY REALISING THAT YEAH WE'RE DISCUSSING HOW MUCH HOW GOOD IT'S GONNA BE TO CHANGE CHANNELS TO WE STILL CAN JUST TELL IT IT 
I MEAN ARE WE ARE WE STARTING TO GET AWAY FROM THE THE VOICE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT 
YEAH MAYBE WE CA LIKE WE LIKE WE'RE LEAVING OUT THE BUTTONS FOR THE THE F LESS FREQUENTLY USED STUFF 
BUT MAYBE WE COULD INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE VOICE 
MM I SUPPOSE BUT IT THERE IS THE OFF CHANCE THAT YOU KNOW THE THE BRIGHTNESS IS WRONG IN YOUR T. V. OR THE CONTRAST NEEDS CHANGING 
HMM YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
WELL I MEAN IN A NOT LIKE A MOUSE THE OR THE SCROLLING BUTTON 
SO ACTUALLY A BUTTON AS WELL YOU COULD PRESS IT YOU COULD PRESS THAT AND HAVE TO USE A MENU BUTTON 
OH YEAH 
UH CAN I JUST GOT SOME THINGS CLEAR JUST FOR MY SAKE 
OR ENERGY SOURCE IS GONNA BE 
LONG TERM 
COOL 
OH 
AND WE'RE HAVING A CUSTOM CHIP 
AND INTERCHANGEABLE CASE 
MM MM-HMM 
AND UH ARE WE GONNA HAVE IT IL BEING ILLUMINATED FROM INSIDE ONTO THE BUTTONS ARE 
COOL 
ARE WE HAVING TO THAT IT'S ANY ANGLE OR IS IT JUST 
SO WOOD IS POSSIBLE 
MM-HMM 
OH OKAY WE BASICALLY HAVE THE SAME KINDA LAY OUT HERE IT'S JUST UM YOU HOLD IT LIKE THIS AND IT GETS KINDA MOULDED OUT THE AT THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND 
BASICALLY 
UM IN THE LEFT WE'VE GOT THE SCROLL FOR THE VOLUME 
IN THE RIGHT WE HAVE BUTTONS FOR THE CHANNELS UP AND DOWN AND THAT KINDA SO YOU CAN HOLD IT AND SCROLL 
OR YOU CAN HOLD IT AND AND PUSH 
UH THIS IS THE POWER KEY UM IT'S KINDA LIKE THE BIGGEST SO YOU KNOW HOW TO TURN ON 
OH THAT'S THE LITTLE MENU OKAY 
THIS IS THE INFRA RED SECTION SO YOU G IT'LL BE SENDING RAYS AND IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW POINTING IT LIKE THAT IT CAN SEND IT 
OR IF YOU HOLD IT UP LIKE THAT IT'LL SEND IT 
UH WE GOT A MICROPHONE THERE WHICH FOR ALL THE VOICE COMMANDS SO YOU CAN YOU KNOW TALK TO TO LIKE THAT AND IT'LL STILL UNDERSTAND 
UM THE LOGO IS DOWN DOWN THERE UM AND HAS THE COVER ON IT AND YOU CAN SEE LIKE IT JUST KINDA GOES THE RED BIT'S THE COVER AND IT KINDA GOES OVER EVERYTHING AND THEN THERE'S HOLES FOR THE BUTTONS TO COME THROUGH 
UM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT IT'S ALSO E E EASIER TO PUT ON VERSUS LIKE MOBILE COVERS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO SCREW THEM IN AND STUFF AND YOU KINDA SOMETIMES HAVE TO GET SOMEONE TO DO THAT FOR YOU 
THIS IS VERY MUCH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO STRETCH IT OVER YOURSELF AND IT'LL BE FINE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LI THAT'LL BE THE COVERS AS WELL YEAH YEAH 
YEAH IT COULD STAND YEAH 
WELL WE COULD BROADEN THE BROADEN IT IT A BIT IS IT WOULD STAND LIKE THAT 
YEAH STANDING

SO THEY KINDA JUST STRETCH OVER 
YEAH 
WELL I I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BUT YEAH THEY'RE KIND OF IT'S JUST KIND OF A RUBBERY AND THAT WAY YOU KNOW SPONGY LIKE IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WANTED AND IT JUST SORT OF STRETCHES OVER AND THAT WAY I THINK PROBABLY HELPS PROTECT IT A LITTLE BIT TOO AS WELL AND

YEP 
OKAY GOOD YEAH 
YEP RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
I MEAN TH IT'S IT'S A DETAILED POINT I JUST WONDERED I MEAN HO HOW WELL PEOPLE PUT THIS DOWN I WONDER 
RIGHT 
OKAY FOR SOME STRANGE RE REASON I HAD IT IN MY MIND THAT THEY'D PUT THEM DOWN VERTICALLY BUT UH UH 
YEAH 
OH NO BECAUSE PARTICULARLY IF THEY'VE DIF IF THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO USE A YOU KNOW AS A FASHION ITEM UH I MEAN IT IT'S UH IT IT'S JUST I MEAN IT'S JUST A MINOR DETAILED POINT 
BUT UM SO YOU SAY YOU CAN JUST MAKE THE BASE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER AND UH 
YEAH AND UH IT JUST NEEDS ANOTHER UH ANOTHER LOGO SOMEWHERE IS IS IS IS ALL IT GIVES GIVES PEOPLE THE OPTION AND IF IF SAY IF THEY'VE GOT THEM UM BECAUSE ACTUALLY HAVE SEVERAL UPON THE UH 
YEAH WELL 
YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S UH BUT UH IN THE THE THE OVERALL UH THE OVERALL CONCEPT IS UH YEAH YEAH NO NO I MEAN THAT'S THIS UH 
YEAH 
BUT UH YEAH BUT IN THE ABOUT THE YEAH TH TH TH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH I MEAN IT IT'S UH WOULDN'T WOULDN'T DO THAT INDEED YEAH 
BUT THE THE ABOUT THE YEAH THE B THE THESE WERE ALL MINOR MINOR UH MINOR DETAILS 
I THINK THE UH THE BASIC CONCEPT I I IS IS ABSOLUTELY BANG ON AND THE I IT CERTAINLY MEETS OUR CRITERIA OF BEING UH IF YOU KNOW LOOKING DIFFERENT 
UM SO GOOD THAT'S THAT THAT'S EXCELLENT 
UM RIGHT LET US UM 
WHAT'S ON THE NEXT ONE 
OH RIGHT YES LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE UM 
F FINANCE 
UM NOW 
WE'RE GIVEN A A COLOUR DESIGN BRIEF UH 
IF I GOT THE UH SPREADSHEET UP 
OH RIGHT 
OH 
GOOD THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO MAKE THESE THINGS SIMPLE IS THAT THE UH THE THE THE BOSS CAN UNDERSTAND 
NOW I'VE UM THIS IS THE COMPANY'S UH UH COSTING FOR FOR VARIOUS UH UH ASPECTS OF DESIGN AND I I I'VE TREATED SOME OF THESE SLIGHTLY UH LIBERALLY GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS PLACED ON SO 
UM I WOULDN'T KNOW FOR ONE FOR INSTANCE IF IF THEY REQUIRE US TO HAVE IT IN THE CORPORATE COLOURS 
THEN THAT IS NOT A SPECIAL COLOUR THAT'S A THAT'S A STANDARD COLOUR 
UH SO WE'RE JUST SIMPLY ON BATTERIES THE THE ON THE THE ONE DECISION I'VE HAD TO MAKE IS THAT UM 
WE'RE WE WILL HAVE TO FIND A AS A REGULAR STANDARD CHIP TO TO DO THIS WITH AND I I UM I'M I'M I'M CERTAIN THAT THEY THEY ARE AROUND SO 
UM THAT I DON'T THINK IS A A SERIOUS PROBLEM 
THE UH THE THE VOICE SENSOR IS IS EXPENSIVE BUT WE WE MADE A A BASIC DECISION THAT THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL TO THE AT THE DESIGN IS THAT THAT HAS TO STAY 
UM THEN AGAIN THE THE THE THE SHAPE OF THE CASE MEANS THAT IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE TO UH UM 
L TO MAKE 'CAUSE OF THE THE THE THE DOUBLE CURVES BUT IN THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE OF OUR OVERALL FASHION CONCEPT UM WE WE SHOULD EXCEED THE THE SALES TARGETS 
UM IT'S SIMPLY MADE OF PLASTIC IS TH THAT'S UH THAT'S NO PROBLEM AND UH UM JUST BECAUSE THE WHOLE THE COLOUR OF THE THE WHOLE THING THAT'S UH UH THERE'S SOME COST THERE 
UM AND UH 
WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT A SCROLL WHEEL W W WE GOT PUSH BUTTONS AND AND A SIMPLE UH UM 
SLIDER SO UM AND THE AND THE THE BUTTONS ARE UH UH WELL I D DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE SPECIAL COLOUR 
ANYWAY THE THE COSTINGS UH COME ON IT EXACTLY ON TARGET AT TWELVE POINT FIVE UH BUT I TH I THINK WE HAVE A A VERY STRONG CASE TO ARGUE THAT UH WHAT WHAT WE'VE GOT IS IS IS IN INNOVATIVE AND UH AND DIFFERENT THAT UM ANY ANY SLIGHT COMPROMISE WE HAVE TO MAKE AN ON COST IS IS OFFSET BY THE UH YOU KNOW THE 
UH YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE CONCEPT OF IT BEING A A FASHION ACCESSORY AND AND HAVING THE THE INTERCHANGEABLE COVERS IS UH UM YOU KNOW THE F F OF THE MANAGEMENT EXPECT US TO BE TECHNO AGAIN FAIL AGAIN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE UM THAT THEY THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT WE WE CAN'T OPERATE ABSOLUTELY WITHIN UH THE CONSTRAINTS THAT THEY GAVE 
SO UH W W WE PRESENT THIS IS THE UH THE COMPANY'S UH THE THE COMPANY'S WAY FORWARD AND UH UH I I THINK WE CAN ARGUE THAT WE WE HAVE UH COME ON ON ON BUDGET 
UM 
OKAY UH 
SO UM 
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO UH UH ANDREW DO YOU WANT WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT UM 
THE UH YEAH THE EVALUATION WHERE WHERE YOU KNOW WELL WHERE WHERE WE'RE WHERE WHERE WE'RE IT 
THE THE THE WELL TH I MEANT THE PRODUCT 
YEAH 
OH SORRY YEAH UM MM 
MM 
MORE LOUD CLICKS ON THE MICROPHONE 
SEVEN BEING A NICE ROUND NUMBER TO WORK OUT 
TRUE 
NO FOR TRUE AND SEVEN FOR FLASE 
YES 
WELL I THINK MOST DEFINITELY 
YES THE VOICE TECHNOLOGY INDEED 
I DON'T SEE WE COULD'VE MADE OUT ANY EASIER 
TOTALLY 
NO 
YEAH 
FIND EASILY 
YEAH I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S 
YEAH 
DOES IT TAKE LONG TO LEARN TO USE 
SHOULDN'T 
LESS BUTTONS SO IT MUST BE 
SO YEAH M UM 
I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE I MEAN UH OLD OLDER PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AMONG THE BUTTONS ANYWAY WILL ACTUALLY PROBABLY LIKE THE LOOK LIKE THE VOICE BUT SO 
AND IT'S IT'S IT'S WELL I DON'T THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY 
CHARGING A PARTICULAR PREMIUM ANYWAY IN THE END SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT WILL APPEAL F FOR DIF FOR DIFFERENT REASONS BUT IT'S IT'S UH YEAH YEAH SO I I YEAH I 
YEAH SO I THINK WE CAN REASONABLY SAY IT'S ANOTHER ANOTHER ONE WHY NOT

UM IT'S IT'S IT'S WITHIN BUDGET UM I IT'S UH YES IN IN ANY MINOR POINTS WE WE WE ARGUE

UM WELL DEVICE APPEAL TO ALL AGE GROUPS 
YEAH UH THAT'S A GOOD CALL YEAH 
WELL WE HAD THE WE HAD THE DATA SAYING THAT OLD PEOPLE WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO PAY EXTRA MONEY BUT THE FUNCT THE INCREASED FUNCTIONALITY 
THE E EASE OF USE OF THE DEVICE MIGHT MAKE UP FOR THAT 
MM 
UH CAN YOU JUST CLICK THE MY MOUSE TO MOVE ONTO NEXT PAGE 
OH YEAH AND WHAT HE DID WE MAKE THE MANAGEMENT'S 
UM 
OKAY 
SO UH ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN 
ELEVEN DIVIDED BY ELEVEN'S ONE IS EQUALS AVERAGE OF ONE 
AND THAT ROUGHLY CONCLUDES MY EVALUATION OF THE OF THE PRODUCT

COMPUTER ADJUSTING 
OH 
OH 
OKAY 
SO 
RIGHT 
YOU READY BACK THERE 
OH OKAY 
WELCOME EVERYONE 
UM THIS IS THE KICK OFF MEETING FOR THE DAY 
UM WE'RE THE NEW GROUP UH TO CREATE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR REAL REACTION 
SO YOU CAN USE OUR AGENDA IS IT OPEN UP THE MEETING UM BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER 
UM HAVE A LITTLE TURNING ON TOOLS UH CREATE A PLAN DISCUSS THINGS AND AND WE ONLY HAVE TWENTY MINUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TOTAL 
OKAY 
THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL IS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY 
THAT STEPH IS YOUR PART IS THE USER FRIENDLINESS 
THE ORIGINALITY UM IS GONNA TAKE ALL OF US 
UM THE TRENDINESS WE'LL PROBABLY GO LIKE IT FOR SOME MARKETING RESEARCH INFORMATION FROM YOU SARAH 
UM AND WE'LL GET IN WITH IT 
OKAY SO WE'LL HAVE A FUNCTIONAL DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK UM WITH MEETING AND THEN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN IT AND THEN DETAILED DESIGN 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
EVERYBODY'S SUPPOSED TO TRY TO THE WHITEBOARD 
KATE WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO FIRST OF YOU CAN EITHER BRING YOUR THINGS WITH YOU I GUESS 
AND WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT WE'LL TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOOK THESE THINGS IN AS WELL 'CAUSE WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WALK AROUND 
UH I DO NOT THINK SO I THINK IT'S JUST TO TRY TO THE WHITEBOARD 
OH 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
GREAT 
AND THE CHARACTERISTICS 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
FANTASTIC 
SINCE YOU'RE HANDY AS WELL WHY DON'T YOU DO YOURS NEXT STEPH 
I THINK IT'S TO GET IS USED TO USING THE PEN 
OH NO 
A MOUSE Y 
OH 
ARGH 
RAT 
NOT A MOUSE A RAT 
AND YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL 
OH 
OKAY 
KATE 
UH A FISH 
OH OKAY 
FINE 
FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS 
'KAY 
SO THEY HAVE TEAM ELEMENTS 
I'M AFRAID I'M WITH STEPH 
AND I THINK YOUR PEN'S RUNNING OUT OF WHATEVER 
BUT I'M AFRAID I TAKE THE COWARD'S WAY IT AND THE CAT'S LOOKING THE OTHER WAY 
HE'S HIDING 
UM CATS ARE SOMETIMES VERY INDEPENDENT 
MY PARENTS HAD CATS 
UH AND THEY CAN MM DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT IS BEST 
OKAY 
NOW UM WE HAVE TO GET DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY OF HOW TO MAKE THIS AND THIS REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO BE SOLD UM WE'RE TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
WITH A PROFIT AIM ULTIMATELY OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS 
THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT HOW MANY UM WE HAVE TO SELL IN AN INTERNATIONAL SCALE 
UM WOULD BE AN AWFUL LOT OF THIS WOULD BE LIKE WHAT 
A HUNDRED MILLION OF THEM UM TO MAKE TWENTY FIVE EUROS ON EACH ONE AND TO MAKE A TOTAL PROFIT OF FIFTY MILLION 
UM THE PRODUCTION IS IT ONLY COST TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS PER ITEM 
NOW IF THEY COST TWELVE AND A HALF YOU'RE SELLING IT FOR TWENTY FIVE YOU'RE MAKING TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS EACH 
UM AND WE'RE TO MAKE A PROFIT OF FIFTY MILLION THAT'S IT UH CAN YOU DO THE MATHS AND HOW MANY ARE WE SELLING 
MARK UP 
OKAY 
YES 'CAUSE OUR MARKET UM IS INTERNATIONAL AND YOUR PROBLEM IS HAS TO DO WITH MARKETING IF YOU KNOW 
YOU GOTTA KNOW HOW MANY WE'RE GOING TO BE SELLING TO KNOW HOW BIG A MARKET YOU HAVE TO TARGET AND WHO IS THAT 
TO GIVE YOU A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OKAY 
THAT'S FIFTY MILLION EUROS 
IN ORDER TO MAKE FIFTY MILLION EUROS AND YOU'RE ONLY GETTING TWELVE AND A HALF EACH 
THAT'S A LOT OF SELLING 
TWO FOR 
TO BE FIFTY BE FOUR MILLION 
YOU'D HAVE TO SELL FOUR MILLION 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
EXPERIENCE WITH A REMOTE CONTROL 
ANY OF YOU USE OF REMOTE CONTROL FOR A TELEVISION OR D. V. D. OR SOMETHING 
YOU'RE BOTH NODDING ALL THREE 
WELL 
I'VE SEEN SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE FAR MORE THAN ONE DEVICE TO A TIME 
BUT I ALSO HAVE HEARD ABOUT THEM NOT WORKING WELL OR NOT WELL CO ORDINATED AND YOU WIND UP WORKING WITH THIS ONE FOR THE THESE THREE AND THEN THIS ONE OVER HERE FOR ANOTHER 
AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS TALK TO EACH OTHER 
DON'T KNOW 
OKAY 
ARE THERE ANY UM IDEAS FOR THE REMOTE 
WHAT WOULD TO BE FOR AND WHAT GROUP WOULD BE B FOUR 
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT ONE 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
UM I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS VERY QUICK BUT THE 
I THINK THAT'S THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IS THE FIRST ONE THAT'S KATE FOR THE WORKING DESIGN 
AND USER THAT'S YOU S STEPH FOR THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN AND FOR MARKETING THE USER REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION 
I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF WE HAVE TO HELP EACH OTHER AND WORK THROUGH THIS IS A GROUP 
AND I THINK WE ALL YOU KNOW 
WE LIKE OUR KITTY CAT AND OUR RAT AND OUR FISH BUT I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO LIKE EACH OTHER UM TO GET THIS DONE 
UH IS IT SAYS WE'RE GONNA GET INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTIONS BUT UH I DON'T THINK THEY ALLOWED A LOT OF EXTRA TIME 
SO I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF LOSS OF THIS AND MORE TO DO WILL SET IS NO GOOD STEAD 
DO YOU ALL AGREE 
ALRIGHT 
UM THEN I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO PROLONG IT AND IF WE SHOULD FINISH THIS MEETING AT ONE RIGHT NOW AND GO INTO OTHER THINGS 
ALRIGHT SO THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST MEETING 
THANK YOU ALL 
OH YEAH IF I CAN PICK UP WITH ALL THESE BITS AND PIECES HANG ON 
OH RIGHT SO YOU WANT AN ANIMAL AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL 
DO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE WHAT ANIMAL TO USE 
UM 
ONLY ANIMAL I COULD THEN I COULD DRAW 
ITS A SORT OF BUNNY RABBIT CAT 
YOU CAN TELL IT'S NOT A BUNNY RABBIT BY THE EARS 
UM I SUPPOSE IT SHOULD HAVE A MOUTH AS WELL SORT OF 
RIGHT YEAH 
UM THE FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CAT UM THE WHISKERS I THINK UM BECAUSE THEY'RE THE EASIEST TO DRAW 
IN FACT I'LL GIVE IT SOME MORE 
UH AND THE TOOL 
YES 
UM SURE IT'S NOT TO TEST OUR ARTISTIC 
IT'S A MOUSE 
NO IT'S NOT A MOUSE 
IT'S A WOMBAT 
A WHITE 
A WEBBED FOOT 
WEBBED F OH RIGHT 
GOSH WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF FISH 
THAT'S EVEN EASIER TO DRAW THAN CAT 
THAT THAT THAT'S THE SORTA PRODUCT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THAT WILL WORK FOR A IN A HOME ENVIRONMENT FOR A T. V. S AND 
I THINK IN THAT WORKS WOULD BE GOOD 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
ARE WE ALL GONNA DRAW A CAT 
THAT'S NOT A MOUSE Y NO 
IT'S A RATTY 
A RATTY 
IT'S CLOTHES 
THAT'S IT'S CLOTHES 
IT'S A RATTY WITH A WITH A WITH A VERY LONG TAIL 
I LOVE WHISKERS 
UH THEY'RE INTELLIGENT AND THEY'RE CHEEKY AND 
OH FANTASTIC PETS AND VERY FRIENDLY 
AND THEY SIT ON YOUR SHOULDER AND WHISPER THE ANSWERS TO YOUR HOMEWORK IN YOUR EAR WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR HOMEWORK 
A SHARK 
IT IS TRUE THAT YOU ALWAYS SIT AROUND YOU KNOW YOU'RE SITTING ON YOUR SOFA AND YOU WANNA CHANGE SOMETHING THERE'S FIVE DIFFERENT REMOTES 
AND ONE FOR THE D. V. D. AND ONE FOR THE VIDEO AND ONE FOR CABLE AND ONE FOR WHATEVER ELSE 
BUT I PRESUME THIS IS IT I PRESUME THIS IS JUST FOR TELEVISION 
I THINK IN IN B BRIGHT COLOURS WOULD BE GOOD 
I THINK IN THAT DOESN'T HAVE LOTS OF SUPERFLUOUS FUNCTIONS 
LIKE I'VE GOT ONE AT HOME THAT HAS 
WELL APART FROM THE OBVIOUS CHANNELS CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN VOLUME 
YOU KNOW SUBTITLES MUTE THERE'S A LOTTA BUTTONS THAT I'VE GOT AN IDEA WHAT THEY DO LIKE 
MM 
OOH CLOSING THE MEETING 
THAT WAS QUICK 
MM-HMM 
SO THIS OKAY 
I KNOW 
THANKS 
MM THIS IS VERY REPRESENTATIONAL FISH 
UM I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE SLEEK AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF FREEDOM BUT THEY ALSO DO AN UH SWIM IN GROUPS SO 
DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE ONE 
OH YEAH 
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF THAT'S THE UM 
OF FIFTY PERCENT IS NORMAL 
B YEAH 
UM I WOULD THINK WOULD BE MORE LIKE SIXTY PERCENT 
BUT UM LET ME I HAVE TWO THOUGHTS 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT 
AND AND YOUR QUESTION IS HOW MANY DO WE HAVE TO SELL 
AT TWENTY FIVE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S ME 
SO THAT'S FOUR MILLION OF THEM 
YEAH 
AND IF WE MAKE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
FOUR MILLION 
HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
Y YEAH 
WE COULD MAKE A HELLO KITTY 
THEMED REMOTE 
YEAH 
WE COULD TOTALLY GO FOR THE JAPAN A MATION 
WELL I MEAN THERE'S ALSO THE CACHET THAT UM UH THE JAPANESE MAKE GREAT PRODUCTS 
ELECTRICAL THEIR INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IS VERY GOOD 
YEAH 
WELL THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BEING SOMEWHAT COMPUTER LITERATE 
WE TEND TO ME GO TO MENUS AND THEN MAKE CHOICES YOU KNOW 
SO IF IT'S LIKE AN UH VOLUME BUTTON YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO ON AND SAY MUTE OR OR VOLUME 
WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE LIKE THE L THE NUMBERS IF WE ALSO HAVE UH UH CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN 
MM 
WE CAN MAKE IT SMART LIKE AN IPOD YOU KNOW MAKE EVERYTHING MENUS 
OKAY 
UH IT FELL OFF 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR YEAH WE'RE READY 
OKAY 
WELCOME TO THIS SECOND MEETING 
UM IT'S NOW QUARTER AFTER TWELVE AND WE'RE GIVEN FORTY MINUTES UM FOR THIS MEETING 
THIS IS A MEETING IN FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 
UM AND I WANNA WELCOME YOU ALL AND THANK YOU ALL FOR DOING SOME RESEARCH IN BETWEEN 
UM I DID TAKE THE MINUTES FROM THE FIRST MEETING AND I'LL SHOW THEM TO YOU IN A MOMENT 
UM I KNOW EACH OF YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION AND UM IN THINKING ABOUT THE FORTY MINUTES 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE ONLY LIKE THREE MINUTES FOR THE PREVIOUS MINUTES UM EACH OF YOU HAVING ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES OR MAYBE A LITTLE MORE 
MAYBE A LITTLE LESS FOR YOUR PRE PRESENTATIONS AND A LITTLE DISCUSSION 
BECAUSE THERE'S I HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE WERE SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME UH DECISION ON WHAT FUNCTIONS IT WILL HAVE 
OKAY 
SO THIS AP EVERYBODY AGREE WITH THIS 
OKAY 
UM AND AFTER THE MEETING THERE'LL BE THINGS TO BE DONE AND SO YOU CAN USE IT SAYS WE GET TO GET LUNCH 
UM AND THEN SOME MORE INDIVIDUAL WORK AND THEN PUTTING MINUTES AWAY AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS 
UM BUT UH NOW FOR THE MINUTES OF THE FIRST MEETING 
AND GO TO THAT ONE 
UM SO YOU CAN USE IT WAS THIS EARLIER TODAY 
UM KATE STEPH SARAH AND MYSELF IN OR FOUR CAPACITIES WERE PRESENT 
I OPENED THE MEETING THE PRODUCT WAS DEVELOPED UH AND REVIEWED AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL END OF IT 
UM AND IT HAD SOME IMPLICATIONS UM THE FOUR MILLION SALES TARGET AND NEW IDEAS OF NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS 
BRIGHT COLOURS AND SOME OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE JAPANESE 
AND WE CLOSED EARLY AS YOU COULD THEN PROCEED WITH YOUR RESEARCH AND GETTING YOUR REPORTS TOGETHER FOR TOD THIS MEETING 
ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS MINUTES 
ARE THEY COMPLETE DID THEY DISCUSS EVERYTHING THAT WE COVERED LAST TIME 
'KAY 
DID I MISS SOMETHING 
YEAH 
I'M AFRAID I INCORPORATED THAT WHEN I SAID WHO WAS PRESENT BUT YES WE DID 
AND WE DID A LITTLE BIT OF UH TEAM BUILDING OF UH OF MAKING THE PICTURES BUT I DIDN'T THINK THESE WERE APPROPRIATE TO THE MINUTES NECESSARILY 
SO UM AS A GROUP I THINK WE'VE ARE THEY'RE ACCEPTING THE MINUTES 
AND UH OKAY 
YEAH 
GOOD 
UM THEN WE'LL MOVE TO THE THREE PRESENTATIONS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM WE NEED TO MOVE THIS 
WHO WANTS TO GO F FIRST 
THAT'S AS FAR AS IT GOES 
SHE SAID WE DIDN'T NEED TO SCREW IT IN 
IT'S DOING ITS THING 
THERE WE ARE 
NOW IN BETWEEN IS THE PROJECT MANAGER 
THEY SENT ME AN EMAIL FROM THE POWERS THAT BE UM THAT TELETEXT IS OUTDATED UM AND THE INTERNET IS COMING IN AS IMPORTANT 
BUT THAT THEY WANT THIS REMOTE CONTROL IT ONLY BE FOR T. V. UM WITH INCORPORATING THE CORPORATE IMAGE COLOUR AND SLOGAN 
MM 
HMM 
OKAY 
MM 
SO THAT A LARGE ENOUGH TARGET MARKET TO TARGET IT 
NO REAL NUMBERS DOES THE NINETY ONE PERCENT AND THE SEVENTY SIX PERCENT TRANSLATE TO EX NO EXCESS OF THE FOUR MILLION 
OR EIGHT MILLION 
HMM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT WHETHER THEY'RE EARLY ADOPTERS ON THAT SCREEN THAT'S LOOKING AT AGE GROUPS 
LEAP 
HMM 
MM 
OKAY YOU HAD THE OTHER POWER CHANNEL 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
AND WE'LL TURN TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION 
I THINK SHE SAID WE DON'T NEED TO SCREW IT IN JUST STICK TO ONE 
AND THEN PRESS WHAT 
F F. N. AND F. EIGHT 
NEXT TO THE CENTRAL BUTTON ON THE BOTTOM AND THEN F. EIGHT AT THE TOP 
AND THEN WE BE PATIENT 
TADA 
THERE WE ARE 
YAY 
OKAY 
T. V. ONLY 
UGH 
HMM 
MM 
AND EXCEED THE REQUIREMENTS THEY'RE EXPECTING OF US 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
ANY UH THING ELSE YOU WANNA ADD 
OKAY 
YEAH 
LET'S HEAR WHAT KATE HAS TO SAY 
HMM 
I THINK THE WHAT THAT IN IN THE RIGHT SO AS WELL AS LESS CLUTTERED 
IT'S THERE BUT IT'S 
YEAH 
HMM 
OKAY 
HMM MM 
HMM 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
BUT THOSE THINGS AS LONG AS WE CAN GET THOSE COMPONENTS 
THE BLACK THAT THAT RECTANGLE FOR THE USER INTERFACE IS WHERE THE USER COMES ONE OF WHAT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE 
WHAT DO THE BUTTONS LIKE LIKE 
UH WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE 
THAT'S WHERE THE USER INTERFACE IS REALLY COMING INTO ITS OWN 
THE TECHNICAL AND SO WHAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE IN THERE BUT ALSO IT HAS TO BE EASY ENOUGH TO CHANGE OR REPAIR IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG 
FOR EXAMPLE THE BATTERY ENERGY SOURCE OR UM WHAT IF THE CHIP 
FOR WHATEVER REASON BREAKS DOWN AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME DO YOU JUST REPLACE IT 
UM SO THERE ANY UM BECAUSE IT MAY BE IN THE SAME AREA WITH SEVERAL OTHER USER INTERFACES LIKE FOR D. V. D. S MOVIES WHATEVER 
UM DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE A 
A WAY OF BEING SEGREGATED FROM THE OTHERS IN A DIFFERENT FREQUENCY OR SOMETHING 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OH 
MM 
WHAT THEY COST 
OKAY 
MM 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
OH YEAH 
MM 
IT WOULD HAVE TO SOR STORE UP THE ENERGY 
AND THEN USE IT 
SOLAR CAN DO THAT 
UM YEAH THAT WOULD BE TOO HEAVY AND IT'D COST TOO MUCH 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
AND THE DOCK COULD LOOK VERY FANCY AND THAT COULD BE YOUR INSPIRATION OF HAVING IT LOOKING DECENT 
HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
ARE WE AGREED IS IT WHAT OUR TARGET GROUP IS THOUGH 
PRETTY MUCH IS THAT WE'D BE LOOKING FOR THE YOUNGER END 
MM 
I I IS USUALLY PUT MORE MONEY THAN BRAINS 
MM 
YEAH 
OR DO WE USE MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES TO THE MENU THROUGH THE MANUFACTURER 
WE SELL AT THE MANUFACTURER AS THE REMOTE THAT GOES WITH IT 
WHAT WOULD BE A MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING IT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
PROBABLY NOT 
UM THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IS MAKE DECISION ON OUR FUNCTIONS 
OR FUNCTIONS WE'VE AS FAR DECIDED I THINK THAT POWER CHANNEL VOLUME MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE 
UM IT HAS TO HAVE AN ENTER KEY AND OF COURSE THE NUMBER KEYS 
IT HAS TO HAVE BIG USER FRIENDLY BUTTONS AND SH N DEFINITELY WE WANNA BE INSPIRED THAT THE CURRENT 
STYLES ARE JUST PLAIN AWFUL 
SO THAT AGREEABLE TO EVERYONE 
MM-HMM 
THROW SOME LIGHT ON THAT 
UM ACTUALLY WE'RE YOU KNOW WE ARE ALMOST A HALF HOUR OUT OF THE FORTY MINUTES SO WE HAVE TO GET CLOSE TO FINISHING 
OH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
ENTER POWER IS A S UH UM A SUM SIMULTANEOUS KEY 
SO THAT OKAY WITH YOU 
WOULD THAT UH-HUH 
THEN YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE ON OFF TE OFF OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
SO I GUESS EASY TO USE IS THE OTHER THING THAT WE WANT 'EM TO BE ABLE TO DO 
SO YOU SAID YOU KNOW DON'T MAKE IT TOO HARD FOR THE GRANNY 
I JUST JOINED THAT SET LAST WEEK 
UM FIRST GRANDCHILD ARRIVED 
UM SO ARE WE AGREED THEN OF THESE THINGS 
AND LET'S GO BACK TO AGENDA AND HOOK ME UP 
MM 
THIS OUGHTA BE FINE 
IT PROBABLY WON'T GO THE FIRST TIME IT'LL PROBABLY BE LIKE A G MESS 
COME ON 
UH AT LEAST IT OFF HERE 
OH 
NO IT WAS UP THERE BUT I COULDN'T USE IT DOWN HERE 
THIS TIME IT SHOULD BE BOTH 
THERE WE GO 
UM YOU HAVE TO KEEP DOING THE FINANCE THE THE F. N. AND F. EIGHT TO FIVE MINUTES TO FINISH THANK YOU A LOT FOR TELLING ME 
UM RIGHT WE'RE READY TO CLOSE 
UM WILL BE COMPLETED Q QUESTIONNAIRE UM THEN WE'LL HAVE SOME TIME FOR INDIVIDUAL WORK TO CONTINUE OUR RESEARCH UM AND I'LL PUT SOME MINUTES OF THIS MEETING TOGETHER 
UM YOUR INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENTS ARE FOR 
UM KATE TO DO THE COMPONENTS FOR 
YOU STEPH TO DO THE USER INTERFACE AND FOR YOU THE TREND WATCHING 
UM AND EACH OF US WILL GET HELP FROM OUR COACH 
ARE WE AGREED TO GET OURSELVES TOGETHER AND THEN HAVE LUNCH 
OKAY 
THEN THAT'S THE END OF THIS MEETING 
AND I HOPE THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR HERE TO TELL HER THAT'S THE END 
OKAY 
WELL I THINK I WENT OVER THE FUNCTIONS AND WRITE THEM DOWN AND MARKED THEM 
UM THAT'S WHAT I WENT OVER AND NOBODY WAS OBJECTING TO THEM 
OKAY 
UM THE TELETEXT IS OUTDATED THE INTERNET IS IMPORTANT 
IT'S ONLY TO BE FOR A T. V. AND IT MUST INCLUDE THE CORPORATE IMAGE 
COLOUR AND SLOGAN UM WHICH I THINK IS MORE ON THE USER UH RANGE WITH STEPH 
IT DOESN'T TELL ME 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OOPS 
UH I THINK SO WE WE WE TALKED ABOUT THE THE INDIVIDUAL ROLES THAT WE EACH HAD AS WELL 
OKAY 
OY BIG LOOP UNDER THE TABLE 
COULD CAN I ASK WHERE THESE FIGURES COME FROM IS THIS MARKET RESEARCH WE'VE 
MM-HMM 
UM 
HOW D I'M WONDERING HOW HOW OU HOW OUR TARGET PRICE COMPARES WITH THE THE TYPICAL PRICE OF THESE THINGS 
I EXPECT AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SHOULD KNOW THAT 
BUT IF WE'RE AIMING TO TO BUILD THIS THING FOR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY UM SO THAT A LOT OR A LITTLE 
SH SURELY HE'S IN THE WRONG AGE GROUP 
UH MUST BE W ONE OF A S SMALL POPULATION 
AND IF YOU WANT TO TO GO INTO SLIDE SHOW MODE IT'S THAT LITTLE BUTTON THERE 
I YOU CAN IF YOU LOOK AT AT THAT THAT JUST SETS IT UP TO DO A P A UP ON THAT IN THAT IN THERE 
LEFT LEFT A BIT LEFT A BIT THAT ONE YEP 
AND THEN YOU JUST PRESS THE CLOCK WHEN YOU WANNA GO ON 
CHEERS 
MM I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT A DISPLAY ON MY SCREEN 
STILL I'LL DO WITHOUT THAT 
OKAY UM NOW I WANNA BRING US DOWN TO EARTH AGAIN I'M AFRAID AND TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL PRACTICALITIES OF HOW THE THING NEEDS TO WORK 
UM UH AND THIS IS THE METHODOLOGY I SAID IN PREPARING FOR THIS MEETING 
UM BASICALLY I'VE BEEN DOING A LITTLE BIT OF WEB BASED RESEARCH AND IF I HAD A DESIGN TEAM I WOULD'VE BEEN DISCUSSING MY IDEAS WITH 'EM 
BUT THE THE NET RESULT IS THAT I'VE COME UP WITH A FIRST CUT FOR THE WORKING DESIGN THAT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU 
SO LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT THE BASIC FUNCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL IS 
IT'S FOR SENDING A MESSAGE UM TYPICALLY UM VIA INFRARED 
AND THE THE BASIC COMPONENTS WE'VE GOT TO BUILD IN FOR OUR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY EURO UM AN ENERGY SOURCE THE USER INTERFACE AND 
WHICH WILL UM IN INCORPORATE UM AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT THAT ACTUALLY COMPOSES THE MESSAGE UM BASED ON WHAT THE WHICH BUTTONS THE USER PRESSES 
WE TURN THAT INTO A MESSAGE UM AND THEN WE NEED A SENDING MECHANISM TO SEND IT AT THE RECEIVER 
NOW I WOULD HAVE HOPED I THINK THAT'S MY ONLY SLIDE ACTUALLY YEAH 
I WOULD HAVE HAVE HOPED TO ME 
DO YOU A PRETTY POWERPOINT SLIDE OF UM MY FIRST CUT DESIGN 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE TECHNOLOGY DEFEATED ME SEE IF YOU'LL BEAR WITH UM I'LL DO IT IN THE WHITEBOARD 
SO WE WANT AN ENERGY SOURCE 
WHICH IS THERE 
AND WE'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT BE 
UH WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT WIRES ON THIS THING 
UH TYPICALLY IT WOULD BE A BATTERY BUT I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS 
UM AND 
THEN WE HAVE THE THE USER INTERFACE 
OOPS 
AND THE MAIN COMPONENTS IN THERE ARE THE 
THE THE THE CHIP THAT ACTUALLY HAS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE MACHINE THAT TRANSLATES BUTTON PRESSES INTO A MESSAGE WHICH IT THEN 
TRANSFERS TO SOME SENDING MECHANISM WHICH ENCODES IT 
AND SENDS THE MESSAGE TO THE RECEIVER 
SO THESE ARE THE BASIC THINGS THAT WE'VE GOT TO GET ONE FOR OUR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY 
THANK YOU 
MM-HMM 
WELL I MAY BE WRONG HERE BUT I'D BEEN THINKING OF THIS DEVICE IS BEING A A CHEAP MASS PRODUCED DEVICE 
WE'RE TRYING TO SELL FOUR MILLION OF 'EM UM THAT'S THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S ALMOST IN IN EVERY TENTH HOUSEHOLD OR WHATEVER IT IS 
UM AND I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT IS BEING A REPARABLE THING 
YOU JUST IF IT GOES WRONG YOU CHECK IT IT AND THAT'S WHY I'M A BIT CONCERNED 
I LIKE THE IDEA OF SPEECH RECOGNITION THAT'S A GREAT IDEA 
BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED WE CAN PUT IT INTO THIS BOX FOR THE PRICE THAT WE NEED GONNA NEED TO HIT 
UM 
I'M I'M I'M HOPING THAT MY PERSONAL COACH IS GONNA GIVE ME SOME ADVICE ON THAT IF YOU'RE ASKING ME BUT 
YEAH 
WELL I UH THINK THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING IDEA ABOUT UM I'M NOT A VERY GOOD INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHAT THESE THINGS COST 
I'LL DO SOME RESEARCH FOR THE NEXT MEETING 
WELL SOLAR MAY NOT BE IS GOOD WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. ON THE NIGHT BUT 
YEAH I GUESS 
WE MAY BE TALKING QUITE HEAVY THEN 
MM-HMM 
SO DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT MAKE THAT A SELLING POINT OF IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND WE COULD AFFORD TO DEVELOP 
MM 
YEAH I WAS WONDERING THAT BECAUSE I G I AGREE THAT THERE THERE'RE PEOPLE WITH UH HOW CAN I PUT IT 
MORE MONEY THAN SENSE AND WHO ARE LIABLE TO BUY SOMETHING NEW BUT 
BU BUT WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY WAS 
ALTHOUGH THEY THEY MAY BE BUYING UM YOU KNOW PERSONAL MUSIC DEVICES AND ALL THAT ARE THEY NECESSARILY BUYING T. V. REMOTE CONTROLS 
BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY LIVE IN A HOUSEHOLD THAT HAS A T. V. IF THEY'RE AT THE LOWER END OF THE AGE RANGE I DON'T KNOW 
MM 
I THINK WE'VE GOT A BIG HILL TO CLIMB HERE HAVEN'T WE 
I MEAN WE'VE GOTTA PERSUADE PEOPLE WHO'VE GOT A REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE IT CAME WITH THE TELLY THAT THEY SHOULD BUY OUR PRODUCT INSTEAD 
RIGHT GOOD POINT 
YEAH YEAH OKAY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH GOOD POINT 
MM-HMM 
DO YOU WANT THE GIZMO 
UH HOW DOES THAT WORK 
HOW IS IS HOW DOES THAT WORK HOW DO YOU AVOID SWITCHING THE THING OFF WHEN YOU ACTUALLY WANNA PRESS ENTER 
OKAY YEP MM-HMM 
IT'S NOT GETTING A BIT COMPLICATED 
COULD GRANNY DO THOSE ARE ARE WE JUST NOT AIMING AT GRANNY 
MM 
OH 
HOW DO YOU DO THAT 
HOW DO YOU MAKE TO DO BOTH 
OH OKAY IT TOGGLES THROUGH YEAH 
YEAH 
SOUNDS GOOD 
OKAY 
SO WE'RE STILL ONE MEETING AREN'T WE 
OKAY 
YES 
YEAH I D 
UH NOT REALLY MEANT TO TOUCH THOSE MICROPHONES 
UH IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ONE DOES IT 
THAT'S FINE 
UH IT DEFINITELY NEEDS UH A LOT MORE RESEARCH ON LIKE HOW MUCH MORE IT WOULD BE AND ANY 
YOU KNOW EXISTING EXAMPLES AND WHAT REACTIONS TO THEM HAVE BEEN AND THAT SORT OF THING 
YEAH PRESS THEM 
YEAH HERE WE GO 
CAN I NOT JUST UH 
DO EACH ONE IN ORDER 
THAT 
THAT 
THAT 
RIGHT TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
UH WELL I THINK FIRST OFF BASICALLY I DO AGREE WITH WHAT SARAH HAS DEFINED AS AS UH YOUR PERSONAL 
I THINK WE NEED UH A MORE STREAMLINED VOLUME WITH NO EXTRANEOUS FUNCTIONS 
SO MY METHOD WAS TO LOOK AT THE EXISTING REMOTES AND WHAT FUNCTIONS THEY HAVE 
AND WHAT WE ALL NEED TO DISCUSS IS WHETHER WE WANT THESE FUNCTIONS 
UH PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS WHAT EXISTING REMOTES HAVE 
IF WE CAN BUILD IN THIS WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I'D THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL BUT IT'S ALSO SOMETHING WE CAN DISCUSS 
UM AND AND I PRESUME WE CAN MISS OUT THE FUNCTIONS REALLY IT IT A VIDEO OR D. V. D. REMOTE CONTROL 
IF THIS IS ONLY GONNA BE A YOU KNOW SATELLITE CABLE T. V. 
REMOTE CONTROL 
SO THESE ARE TWO MODELS OF EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS 
UH THE IN IN THE LEFT 
SEEMS TO BE A FAIRLY 
UH STANDARD UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL 
IT HAS FAST FORWARD STOP PLAY ALL RELATING TO MOVIES 
IT ALSO HAS SEEMS TO HAVE CHANNEL UP AND CHANNEL DOWN WHICH IS WHICH IS MORE WHAT YOU'D EXPECT FROM A 
YOU KNOW LIKE A SKY OR CABLE REMOTE CONTROL WHERE YOU'VE GOT HUNDREDS OF CHANNELS INSTEAD OF A MERELY TERRESTRIAL ONE 
UH BUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF THE IN IN THE RIGHT 
WHICH HAS TO ALSO HAS PLAY STOP AND PAUSE AND EVERYTHING I DON'T THINK WE NEED THEM AT ALL 
I THINK WE JUST AND CHANNEL SELECTION 
VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN AND 
I THINK IN AN ENTER FUNCTION WHERE YOU CAN ACCESS IT'S NOT LIKE TELETEXT BUT ALONG THE SAME LINES ACCESS THINGS IN THE SCREEN 
OH 
NOT RELATED TO THE INTERNET ON THAT YOU MENTIONED BECAUSE THAT'D BE FAR OUTSIDE OUR BUDGET AND WHAT WE WANT THIS TO DO 
SO IT REALLY EXCEED THE REQUIREMENTS 'CAUSE THE REQUIREMENTS REALLY ARE JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE CHANNELS AND FUNCTIONS WHICH 
SO MORE A TEXT ON THE SCREEN THING THEN UH THEN ACTUAL BUTTONS O I WAS THINKING SOMETHING SOME SMOOTH 
SLEEK LITTLE REMOTE CONTROL WITH BIG USER FRIENDLY BUTTONS AND UH A MENU THAT YOU CAN ACCESS 
UH BUT THEN I DO THINK WE NEED TO DISCUSS THE SPEECH 
UM RECOGNITION POSSIBILITY 
NO 
BUT WE COULD GO BACK TO THE PICTURES OF THE 
UH WHAT'RE THEY CALLED 
THE PICTURES OF THE REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND POSSIBLY DISCUSS WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THEM BUT MAYBE SHOULD HEAR WHAT KATE HAS TO SAY FIRST 
OKAY THEN 
DEFINITELY LESS CLUTTERED AND I MEAN BUT STILL IT'S 
SORRY I WAS JUST I'LL JUST UH RESUME SOMETHING ELSE I WAS GONNA SAY 
THE THE STYLE OF THIS IS TERRIBLE 
I I I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO UH 
NOT ONLY POSSIBLY EVEN MATERIALS LIKE THE TYPE OF PLASTIC SAID ABOUT EVERYTHING INCLUDING SIZE AND SHAPE OF BUTTONS 
POSITIONING OF BUTTONS THE ACTUAL SHAPE OF THE HAND HELD DEVICE COLOURS 
JUST EVERY E YEAH EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THIS HAS TO BE REVOLUTIONISED 
BUT 
SO THAT'S THAT FOR NOW 
WHOOP 
ISN'T THAT YOUR JOB 
OH RIGHT 
YEAH 
IT DOES IT DOES SEEM SO IF WE'RE JUST TO DO SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE AND MASS PRODUCED 
THE WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THESE EXISTING MODELS JUST MAYBE 
A LITTLE BIT MORE INSPIRED 
BUT BASICALLY JUST THE SAME 
ALTHOUGH WHAT WHAT UH SUDDENLY CAME INTO MY HEAD IS YOU KNOW HOW THEY ALWAYS TAKE TWO A. A. BATTERIES WHICH WHICH IS REALLY NOT VERY EFFICIENT AT ALL 
COULD TO BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE UH YOU KNOW LIKE A RECHARGEABLE INTERNAL BATTERY LIKE WELL LIKE AN M. P. THREE PLAYER DOES 
WITH THAT YOU COULD JUS OR A MOBILE PHONE OR WHATEVER 
YOU COULD YOU KNOW YOU JUST PLUG INTO A POWER SOURCE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND THEN IT'S RECHARGED FOR AGES AND AGES AND AGES 
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY WITH REPLACING A. A. BATTERIES WHICH ARE 
YOU'D NEVER AND UH BATTERIES WOULD YOU UH YEAH 
AND IT'S NOT STUCK DOWN THE BACK OF THE SOFA 
BUT THEN AGAIN I D I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS WITHIN OUR PRICE RANGE OR NOT 
WELL IT IS JUST SO ANNOYING HOW 
NO BUT JUST A RECHARGEABLE INTERNAL BATTERY WOULD PROBABLY I MEAN IT MIGHT COST MORE AT AT FIRST TO DEVELOP NEED TO INSTALL 
BUT FOR LONG TERM SO IT'LL BE AS MUCH MORE CONVENIENT AND ECONOMIC THAN FIDDLING AROUND TRYING TO REPLACE CHUNKY A. A. BATTERIES AND NOT HAVING ANY IN YOUR KITCHEN DRAWER AND 
YOU KNOW IF 
MM 
SORT OF HAVE ITS LITTLE DOCK THAT YOU COULD PUT IT IN 
STILL I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S QUITE WITHIN OUR PRICE RANGE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S PROBABLY MORE WHAT IT IS 
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY RESOLUTIONS BY THE END OF THE DAY OR WE 
YEAH 
SORRY I WAS MILES AWAY 
I WAS RE I WAS READING THE CHART TO BE HONEST 
WHO'S GOT AN IPOD THEN 
YEAH THINGS LIKE SCREEN SETTINGS AND AUDIO SETTINGS I WOULD GENERALLY 
DO THEM IN THE ACTUAL TELEVISION ITSELF LIKE HERE YOU HAVE A 
YOU KNOW A LITTLE FLAP TH WITH A LITTLE CONTROL PANEL ON THE ACTUAL BOX ITSELF 
I I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT USING A REMOTE CONTROL IS 
UM I WOULD SAY THAT THEY ARE DEFINITELY LESS RELEVANT 
YES 
WE DIDN'T COME TO ANY SORT OF DECISION ON THE FUNCTIONS THOUGH 
ALRIGHT WELL THAT'S FINE THEN 
MM 
SORRY WHAT WHAT ACTUALLY OR THIS IS THAT THE YELLOW AND BLACK 
FROM THEIR I'LL JUST USE IT FROM THEIR WEBSITE 
OKAY 
YES 
MM-HMM 
OKAY I ACCEPT THE MINUTES 
SO THAT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY 
OKAY 
EXCELLENT THANK YOU 
OKAY 
OKAY THAT LOOKS GOOD 
ALRIGHT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
UM 
ONE OF THE THE BIGGEST ISSUES I FOUND ABOUT UM FROM LAST MEETING WAS THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO SELL FOUR MILLION OF THIS UM 
REMOTE CONTROLS AND I THINK THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY TAKE REAL REACTION IN THE DIRECTION OF OF SIMILAR 
OF HANDHELD TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN USED AND ARE USED BY MANY OF US AND IT KIND OF BRING THE REMOTE CONTROL INTO THE USE SAME REALM AS AN ACCESSIBLE UM USEFUL ELECTRONIC DEVICE 
AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT IS LOST IN THE COUCH AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
SO UM MY MAIN GOAL HERE IS TO RE ENVISION THE REMOTE CONTROL IN IN THIS CONTEXT AND TO THINK ABOUT MENU FUNCTIONALITY AND CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND THE FACT THAT IT COULD BE INTERACTIVE WITH OTHER TOOLS 
UM SOME OF THE RESEARCH UH IN THE MARKET HAS SHOWN THAT PEOPLE REALLY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH REMOTE CONTROLS AS THEY ARE NOW 
AND UM THAT MEANS WE DO NEED TO 
MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WHAT KEYS ARE ARE BUTTONS ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL TO PERHAPS KEEP AND AND WHAT ONES TO DISCARD 
AND IF WE DEVOTE SOME ENERGY INTO THIS I THINK THE UM RECENT PRODUCTIONS OF REAL REACTION 
TH I GO EVERYWHERE POWER AND THE HIGH DEFINITION D. V. D. PLAYERS ALTHOUGH IT MAKES IMMEDIATE SENSE TO HAVE OUR REMOTE CONTROL INTERACT WITH THIS 
I THINK WE CAN ALSO SO THIS IS A PLATFORM TO MAKE IT INTERACT WITH OTHER TOOLS 
AND UM IN FACT I THINK THE HIGH DEFINITION D. V. D. PLAYERS AND ALL OF THIS WILL COME ALONG IN THE UH WILL ONLY BENEFIT FROM THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK 
FROM OUR WELL DESIGNED TOOL 
SO AGAIN MOST UH USERS REALLY DISLIKE THE CURRENT LOOK AND FEEL OF REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM FIFTY PERCENT I THINK OF ALL THESE UH NUMBERS THE MOST IMPORTANT IS FIFTY PERCENT OF USER SAY THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS 
AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS AND IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS THERE ARE A LOT OF UH TELEVISION D. V. D. 
STEREO REMOTE CONTROL USERS OUT THERE EIGHTY PERCENT WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY ON A REMOTE CONTROL THAT LOOKS FANCY 
UM IT WAS MARKET RESEARCH AND THERE WERE A HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE ROOM SO EIGHTY OUT OF A HUNDRED SAID THEY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL I THINK WE CAN I I THINK WE CAN REALLY FOCUS ON THIS REMOTE AND AND AGAIN BRING THE REAL REACTION UM BRAND IN ONE AND AND GET SOME POSITIVE MARKETING FOR OUR OTHER TOOLS 
EVEN IF WE DIRECTLY DON'T UM ADVERTISE FOR THE I GO EVERYWHERE LINE 
IS AN INTERESTING UM ELEMENT WAS THE WOULD YOU PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION QUESTION 
SO THIS MARKET RESEARCH UH UH QUESTIONNAIRES LOOKED INTO YOUR YOUR UH CONCERN ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND S SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO 
FIND OUT INFORMATION ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION 
NOW 
THE EARLY ADOPTERS THOSE OF US WHO GREW UP WITH TECHNOLOGY AND UH LUCK LUCKY FOR US HAVE THE UH CASH TO TO PAY FOR IT 
THE YOUNG AGE GROUP WITHOUT THE MORTGAGES AND RESPONSIBILITIES NINETY ONE PERCENT OF THEM WOULD PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
VERY INTERESTING I I LOVE THIS UP TO THE GROUP TO DECIDE IF WE WANNA USE THIS UH F AND YOU KNOW 
THE THE DESIGNERS BUT NINETY ONE PERCENT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE 
WELL I I I THINK ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF GROWTH I THINK THIS WOULD BE A VERY SMART GROUP TO TARGET 
I MEAN IS THREE QUARTERS OF THE NEXT AGE GROUP TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE ARE INTERESTED 
AND UH WITH THE TECHNOLOGIES IMPROVING IF WE CAN GET THIS UH 
YEAH 
IT 
UM YES 
YES 
BUT WOULD YOU PAY MORE AND DOES IT WORK AND SO IT APPROACHABLE AND AND DID I KNOW THAT IT WAS IT WAS NO THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION 
I DON'T KNOW OF SPEECH RECOGNITION SHOULD BE UM SHOULD BE INCLUDED BUT I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING I THINK THAT MAYBE SHOWS MORE ABOUT UH 
BEING OPEN TO TECHNOLOGY 
SHALL I GO BACK 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
I MEAN I I I UH DID NOT RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT BUT I THINK THE COMPETITION 
SUSSING OUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING AND WHAT'S ON THE PIPELINE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE UM THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT DO YOU WANT AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND AND THAT WASN'T RESPONDED TO BUT UH SOME OF THE LARGER 
REMOTES DO HAVE SCREENS WHERE YOU CAN NAVIGATE YOU KNOW 
SO IT TURNS INTO SOMETHING UH PERHAPS YOU ALL HAVE SEEN UH THE OSBOURNES WHERE OZZY OSBOURNE IS IS ATTEMPTING TO MANAGE HIS SUPER ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WITH SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A UH A SMALL TRAY 
YOU KNOW IT'S I A AND I THINK YOU KNOW 
NO NO YOU KATE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THERE 
BUT I THINK THE KEY IS TO GET THE EARLY ADOPTERS PEOPLE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH TECHNOLOGY AND AND UH THEY'LL BE 
UH MM 
EXACTLY 
I YES 
AND I'M MAKING AND I'M MAKING THE THE UH UH LEAP THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE FAMILIAR YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE L ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH TECHNOLOGY THAN THAN OLDER PEOPLE 
OR COMFORTABLE YOU KNOW UM SO 
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS AN ATTRACTIVE STREAMLINED REMOTE CONTROL AND TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY REDUCTIONIST POWER CHANNEL VOLUME AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS IS UH 
UP TO THE DESIGNERS 
AND THIS IS THIS IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE MARKET RESEARCH 
THANK YOU 
THAT'S MY CONTRIBUTION 
OR IF 
YEAH 
MAYBE AFTERWARDS WE COULD DO A UH WHITEBOARD WITH THAT YOUR THE IN IN THE RIGHT AS A AS A 
BOSS 
WHITEBOARD SESSION 
MM-HMM 
THE ERGONOMICS THE WAY IT FITS IN YOUR 
YEAH 
DO WE HAVE UM 
KI SOME IDEA OF HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO CREATE A DEVICE THAT HAS THIS BASIC ELEMENTS 
BECAUSE THEN 
IN THE CHIP COMPOSER MARKETING 
UH IN THE CHIP COMPOSER SENDER 
I I DON'T BELIEVE I KNOW UM 
OKAY 
B BECAUSE THEN WE WOULD HA HA FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH WE HAD TO PLAY WITH IN TERMS OF USER INTERFACE AND THIS LOOK AND FEEL IDEA 
MM-HMM 
INSPIRED 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL THAT HAS ANOTHER ELEMENT WHICH IS IF EVERY TIME YOU'RE DONE USING THE REMOTE YOU PUT IT IN A CHARGER THEN YOU THEN IT HAS A PLACE 
YEAH BUT IT ALSO HAS A PLACE IS EXACTLY 
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
WELL IT'S BETTER THAN MY IDEA ABOUT SOLAR PROBABLY 
YEAH YEAH 
DEPEN 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
DEFINITELY 'CAUSE I'M THINKING IN TERMS OF UM UH 
THE 
LESS AND BREAKAGE OF UM REMOTES HOW MUCH OF THAT IS IS TO DO WITH IT NOT REALLY HAVING A UH A HOME 
A UM A NEST A PLACE TO LIVE EXACTLY 
SO IF YOU CAN DOCK TO UM YOU KNOW YOU COULD S ARGUE THAT THIS IS 
EXACTLY 
MM 
'CAUSE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER COMPONENT LIKE ANOTHER PIECE OF HARDWARE 
MM 
WELL I I BROUGHT UP SOME EXACTLY BUT I THINK YOU RAISED SOME GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT ARE THERE ENOUGH OF THESE PEOPLE OUT THERE 
OR ARE THEY MAKING PURCHASING DECISIONS 
YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE 
YEAH EXACTLY 
UH UH UH I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF THAT KATE 
GOOD GOOD COMMENT 
YEAH 
IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO KNOW UM UH WHO YOU KNOW WHO'S ACTUALLY BUYING TELEVISIONS AND ARE WE IN A UH UH SO 
REGION WHERE PEOPLE HAVE MORE THAN ON TELEVISION IN A HOME 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND AND SOME OF OUR D. V. D. PLAYERS INCIDENTALLY HAVE THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR OWN DEPARTMENT BUT MOREOVER WE NEED TO 
TO GO FOR THE THE MANUFACTURERS 
MM 
DO WE NEED UM LET ME 
BR ACTUALLY UM 
THE ENTER KEY I HAVE A CHART HERE THAT I DIDN'T INCLUDE 
UM 
YEAH WHICH MIGHT 
THE YEAH TH THOSE ARE 
FELT LIKE HAD A LOT OF CHARTS 
OKAY 
I I MY ONLY COMMENT SO I THINK MAYBE UM WE COULD SOMEHOW INCLUDE AN ENTER KEY IN LIKE A POWER KEY OF POWER POWER WAS ENTER AND POW THAT WAS MY ONLY JUST REALLY IN TERMS OF STREAMLINING 
UM 
EXACTLY 
AGAIN YOU KNOW THINKING OF MENUS OR 
UM 
WELL IF YOU'RE PRESSING ENTER THE THE THING WOULD ALREADY BE ONE AND SO MAYBE UM WHEN YOU PRESS POWER INITIALLY IT TURNS OUT ON 
PRESS POWER AGAIN AND SO THAT IS AN ENTER UM SO YOU PRESS POWER AFTER YOU'VE UM WELL I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU TO TURN IT OFF YOU'D HAVE TO PRESS POWER TWICE IN SUCCESSION 
AND MAYBE POWER FOLLOWS SOMETHING LIKE A CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN POWER AND THEN THAT WOULD MAKE THAT CHOICE 
WELL 
OR YOU YEAH 
OR SOMETHING THAT HAS A A TURNING DIAL WHERE TO THE FOUR AND SO ONE OR OFF 
YEAH I DON'T UM I WISH 
ANYWAY UH THAT WAS THE ONLY COMMENT ABOUT UM SOME OF THE THE DECISIONS 
PEOPLE HAVE MADE WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT 
IT'S DEFINITELY CHANNEL VOLUME POWER 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
OKAY WELL 
THANKS FOR LOOKING AT THAT 
MM-HMM 
WE DON'T WANNA OUTSMART 
CONGRATULATIONS 
DO 
OH YOU'RE FINE 
IT'S FINE 
I THINK YOU HAVE TO CYCLE THROUGH 
OKAY 
UM AND YOU'D MENTIONED I I WAS JUST GONNA SAY COULD YOU REITERATE THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 
BECAUSE IT THEY WERE IT HAS TO BE FOR A T. V. JUST TO KEEP MYSELF 
YEAH I THINK I'VE 
OKAY 
MM 
RIGHT 
THANK YOU 
HI KATE 
OKAY CARRY ON 
ALRIGHT UM THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD MEETING THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING 
UM OUR AGENDA SHOULD BE UM THAT WE'RE OPENING THE MEETING I HAVE THE MINUTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING ARE IN THE SHARED F DRIVE AT THIS POINT 
UM AND WE SHOULD EACH HAVE A PRESENTATION TO MAKE 
UM WE HAVE CERTAIN DECISIONS TO MAKE AND WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES TOTAL 
IT'S TWENTY FIVE AFTER TWO AT THE MOMENT IS FORTY MINUTES SO FIVE AFTER THREE UM WHICH I'LL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE CLOCK FOR US 
OKAY 
UM THERE ARE THE DECISIONS WE HAVE TO TURN IT BUT WE'LL COME BACK TO THEM IN A MINUTE AFTER I TAKE US TO THE 
MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
RIGHT UM SO WE REMEMBER I OPENED THE MEETING THE FOUR OF US WERE PRESENT THE MEETING THE FIRST MEETING'S MINUTES WERE REVIEWED AND APPROVED 
UM SARAH YOU PRESENTED A MARKETING RESEARCH REPORT UM WHICH PRETTY MUCH REP REPRESENTED THAT FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS UH IT HAS TO BE HAND HELD 
POWER CHANNEL VOLUME NUMBER KEYS POSSIBLY A SPEECH RECOGNITION 
AND THEN STEPH DID A SECOND PRESENTATION UM THAT THESE FUNCTIONS PLUS STREAMLINING THEM WITH BIG USER FRIENDLY KEYS THAT WERE EASY TO USE 
I THINK ALL OF US AGREED WITH THESE THINGS 
KATE PRESENTED A WORKING DESIGN OF GOING AFTER GOING OVER THE BASICS ON THE WHITEBOARD UM THAT IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MASS PRODUCED DEVICE 
BECAUSE OF THE TWELVE AND A HALF PENCE COST 
UM BUT WE DID TALK ABOUT POSSIBLY USING RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES AND HAVING A DOCKING PLACE AS A SELLING POINT 
UM AND THE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT IT FOR BE FOR T. V. ONLY UM AND THAT TO INCLUDE THE OL S SLOGAN AND COLOUR OF THE UH CORPORATE DESIGN BE INCLUDED 
UM 
THE CORPORATE IMAGE 
SO WE AGREED THAT THE TARGET MARKET WOULD BE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE WITH MORE MONEY THAN SENSE THAT WERE DECISION MAKERS 
ALTERNATIVELY IT WOULD BE A MANUFACTURER TO ENCLOSE IT WITH THE T. V. BUT IT STILL SHOULD MEET THOSE PARAMETERS 
UM AND THAT THE FUNCTION WE AGREED WAS VOLUME POWER NUMBERS ENTER CHANNELS A WAY TO MOVE BETWEEN CHANNELS EASY TO USE AND HAND HELD 
UM TO THAT POINT WE AGREED THAT SARAH WOULD LOOK AT THE CURRENT COST OF COMPETITION WHAT WHAT DO THE CURRENT ONES SELL FOUR 
UM AND STEPH WAS GONNA LOOK AT EC ERGONOMICS 
KATE WAS GONNA LOOK AT COST AND FEASIBILITY OF THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES THAT WE DISCUSSED 
AND I WAS TO TYPE UP THIS MINUTES AND WORK ON THE FINAL REPORT 
SO THIS A FAIR PRESENTATION OF WHAT OUR LAST MEETING WAS 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
SO WE'RE READY TO CLOSE THAT AND GO BACK TO OUR 
THAT ONE 
RIGHT 
WE'RE UP TO THE POINT OF THE 
GO BACK 
UM THE THREE PRESENTATIONS 
SO WE'RE GOING TO PULL THE PLUG IN UM AND TURN IT SARAH 
SO THAT OKAY 
SO THAT ALRIGHT WITH EVERYBODY ELSE 
ESPECIALLY SINCE KATE ASKED TO BE LOST 
SARAH I'M SORRY IF I MISSPELLED YOUR NAME I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS S. I. R. U. OR S. I. R. H. 
YOU RESPOND TO WHATEVER YOU GET HUH 
OKAY 
UM DID YOU DO YOUR HIT 
OH THERE TO USE 
TO DO 
MM 'KAY 
'KAY 
MM 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE THE UH COVERS THAT THEY USE FOR THE REMOTE YOU KNOW YOUR TO YOUR CELL PHONE 
MM 
HMM 
UH-HUH MM 
NO MOST FAMILIES DON'T ISN'T THE REMOTE IS A REMOTE 
MM 
MM 
WELL ACTUALLY SOME HOUSEHOLDS DO HAVE THREE AND FOR T. V. S AND THEY WOULD HAVE A REMOTE FOR EACH ONE IS 
HMM 
HMM 
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE DEVICE ITSELF OR THE C OR A COVER FOR THE DEVICE THAT WOULD BE AN INTERCHANGEABLE COV COVER IS A SEPARATE 
PRODUCT 
PERHAPS PERHAPS THAT DOES THAT PARTICULAR SUGGESTION NEEDS TO GO BACK TO MANAGEMENT AND PERHAPS GO TO ANOTHER GROUP TO ACTUALLY DESIGN IS A SEPARATE PRODUCT 
WE WOULD THAT BE AGREEABLE 
DO YOU WANNA BE NEXT OR YOU WANT KATE TO GO NEXT 
OKAY WE'LL MOVE THE 
MM 
MM 
ALRIGHT 
REMEMBER WE ONLY HAVE FORTY MINUTES 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
HMM 
THANK YOU KATE 
YES 
THERE WE GO 
DO IT AGAIN 
KEEP DOING IT UNTIL YOU GET IT ON BOTH YOU GET OUT THERE YOU GET TO YOURS WITHOUT THAT ONE AND THEN YOU GET IT WITH BOTH 
YEAH 
THIS TIME IT SHOULD COME UP BOTH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
HMM 
MM 
HUH 
IT'S A SELECTION WHEEL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OR CALL IT A OR CALL IT A BANANA AND HAVE IT IN YELLOW 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 'KAY 
I WANNA THANK YOU ALL FOR ALL YOUR PRESENTATIONS 
WE HAVE ABOUT TEN MINUTES LEFT IN WHICH TIME WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS 
UM AND I THINK YOU ALL HAVE BEEN SELF STIMULATING OF WORKING TOGETHER 
UM WE NEED TO COME UP WITH SOME SPECIFICS OF THE COMPONENTS UM THE MATERIALS 
THINGS LIKE MAKING THE DECISION ON THE ENERGY UM AND THE CASE AND THE INTERFACE TYPE THINGS 
SO LET'S 
MM 
RIGHT 
THEY WANT US TO DECIDE 
WHAT FORM OF ENERGY ARE WE GOING TO USE 
WHICH THE CHOICES THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED WERE PRETTY MUCH BATTERY KINETIC OR SOLAR 
UM THIS IS WHERE KATE'S EXPERTISE COMES IN AND OUR DECISION MAKING WILL BE A LITTLE BIT GUIDED BY KATE AT THIS POINT 
THE 
YOU WERE SAYING THAT THE KINETIC WOULD BE USEFUL 
THAT AS YOU JUST HAVE TO MOVE TO SOME AND YOU'D BE ABLE TO USE IT UM AS OPPOSED TO A BATTERY THAT YOU HAVE TO EITHER PUT IT IN A RECHARGER OR UM KEEP REPLACING THE BATTERIES 
UM 
OR SOLAR THAT YOU'D HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH IT IF IT'S A DARK DAY THAT IT'LL DIE ON YOU NEED ONE WAY TO DO IT 
THAT'S THE DAY YOU WANNA USE THE T. V. 
UM SO WHAT'S OUR PLEASURE HERE WHAT WOULD BE THE COST CONSEQUENCES OF EACH OF THE OTHER 
OKAY 
MM 'KAY 
WHAT'S THE UH FEELINGS OF THE GRIP ON THE KINETIC 
HMM 
HMM 
SO THE CONSENSUS SEEMS TO BE AS THE KINETIC IF IT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE 
IT COSTS 
MM 
MM 
MM 
HMM 
YEAH 
THANKS FOR THE REMINDER FOR FIVE MINUTES TO FINISH THANKS 
UM THE NEXT THING THAT THEY WANTED US TO DO WAS LIKE TO CHIP ON PRINT IS A DECISION 
OH 
OKAY 
WHAT ABOUT THE C YEAH 
UH THE WAY WE UH-HUH 
OH OKAY 
UM WHAT ABOUT THE CASE 
I THINK THEY'RE TALKING THERE BUT DO WE WANT WOOD PLASTIC TITANIUM OR RUBBER AND I THINK WE'VE DISCUSSED NOT HAVING TITANIUM 
NO IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE UM AND SECOND IT WON'T DO THIS DOUBLE UM CURVES 
UM WE'VE SORT OF ELIMINATED WOOD 
WE SAID PLASTIC OR RUBBER 
WHAT'S THE PLEASURE 
WHAT ABOUT YOU 
COVER 
UH-HUH 
PLASTIC INSIDE 
HMM 
OKAY 
UM THE NEXT PART THEY WANT IS THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT 
I'M SORRY TO PUSH Y BUT WE ONLY HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES TO FINISH WITH 
OKAY AND IT SAYS INTERFACE 
WHAT TYPE AND WHAT SUPPLEMENTS 
OKAY UM 
THAT'S THAT 
UM THIS IS GONNA SOUND WEIRD BUT THE NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES 
WHEW 
AND THEY ACTUALLY WANT A LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN USER INTERFACE DESIGN YOU CAN LOOK AND SO THIS AS WELL SO I CAN 
MARKETING THEY WANT PRODUCT EVALUATION 
OH 
OH MY I'M SORRY 
OH OKAY 
SORRY ABOUT THAT 
MISSED THAT ONE 
THIS OUGHT TO BE FUN TRYING TO GET THIS THING TO WORK 
UH TO DO 
YES BECAUSE I CAN'T EVEN AS MINE 
NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS 
YEAH RIGHT 
UM THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN IS FOR KATE UH STEPH GETS THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN YOU GET PRODUCT EVALUATION 
UM THE TWO IF YOU GET TO PLAY WITH A PLA MODELLING CLAY UM TO DO A PROTOTYPE 
UH AND EVERYBODY GETS INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTIONS ON THE USUAL WAY 
ANYTHING ELSE WE NEED TO DO 
GO TO IT 
AND THAT'S THE END OF THIS MEETING 
THAT'S FOR HER BENEFIT 
JUST JUST CARRY ON 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SORRY 
I'M GLAD TO USE THE MARKETING BUDGET IS BEING AS WELL SPENT ON 
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
DON'T YOU 
YEAH I I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME TROUBLE WHEN WE GET DOWN TO THE COMPONENT DESIGN IN THIS 
SPONGY IS GONNA BE DIFFICULT I'M AFRAID 
YEAH I MEAN BASICALLY WE CAN MAKE THESE THINGS OUT OF WOOD TITANIUM PLASTIC OR RUBBER 
I SUPPOSE RUBBER IS THE CLOSEST TO SPONGY YEAH 
I WAS THINKING TITANIUM MYSELF 
YEAH 
WE WE WOULD TO BE HELPFUL IF UM I DESCRIBED THE COMPONENTS A BIT 
BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD GIVE YOU M MAYBE BRING THIS DISCUSSION BACK TO EARTH OF WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY DO 
RIGHT WELL I I I THINK SOME OF THIS UM YOU'RE GONNA BE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH SOME OF THE THINGS I HAVE TO TELL YOU 
BUT I'M AFRAID THIS IS THE REAL WORLD 
SO UM 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE THE BASICS OF HOW THESE DEVICES ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK IN ORDER TO OPERATE 
AND I'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH THE M MANUFACTURING DIVISION WHO HAVE TOLD ME WHAT'S ACTUALLY AVAILABLE 
YOU KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART IN COMPONENTS SO AND SOME OF THE EXCITING NEW THINGS THEY'VE GOT 
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S QUITE WHAT YOU WANT ME 
NOW THIS ISN'T A VERY GOOD OVERHEAD BUT THIS IS JUST TO SHOW YOU THIS IS THE INNARDS OF A REMOTE CONTROL UM 
I REALLY NEED A PEN OR SOMETHING ABOUT UH DOES MY MOUSE WORK 
NO 
UM UH YEAH CAN YOU USE MY LITTLE MOUSE POINTER 
RIGHT 
THIS IS THIS IS THE A A A REMOTE THAT'S BEEN OPENED UP AND THAT'S THE THE BACK OF THE INTERFACE 
AND THIS IS A PUSH BUTTON ON SO YOU USE THIS LITTLE LITTLE BUTTONS HERE 
THEY'RE LITTLE RUBBER RUBBER BUTTONS THAT GO THROUGH ONTO THE THE BOARD AT THE BACK AND THEY PUSH THESE BUTTONS HERE 
UM AND WE THAT'S THE BASIC CONSTRUCTION THAT WE'VE GOT TO GET TO ACCOMMODATE 
WE GET TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT PUSHES THE LITTLE BUTTONS THAT UM TALK TO THE CHIP THAT ENCODES THE MESSAGE THAT SENDS THE THE MESSAGE TO THE RECEIVER 
SO UM I WAN I WANNA GO THROUGH NOT NOT JUST ADDRESSING THE UM UH THE THE POINTS THAT YOU MADE 
SARAH ABOUT UM DOING MY PRESENTATION ON THE ORDER I WROTE IT 
SO FIRST OF ALL UM I WANNA TALK ABOUT WHAT POSSIBILITIES WE'VE GOT FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE 
UM WE CAN HAVE YOUR BOG STANDARD DOUBLE DOUBLE A. BATTERIES IN A REPLACEABLE UM LITTLE COMPARTMENT 
WE CAN HAVE A HAND SORRY A WIND UP YEAH WHICH I THINK IS QUITE AN INTERESTING CONCEPT FOR A SORRY FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT I IT MAYBE IS DOESN'T QUITE GO WITH THE UM THE FRUIT AND VEG 
UM IN THAT IN THAT I THINK IS QUITE INTERESTING IS THE KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE 
WHERE UM YOU YOU ACTUALLY GET THE ENERGY BY MOVING THE DEVICE WHICH IS QUITE A IN A NICE AND NOT IN 
YOU HAVE TO IT MEANS THAT IF IT'S SITTING THERE FOR A LONG TIME IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK 
BUT YOU HAVE TO SORT OF THROW IT BETWEEN YOUR HANDS EVERY NOW AND THEN IT'LL WORK 
ARE WE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT SOLAR POWER BUT I THING THAT WE AGREED THAT THAT'S NOT SO GOOD IN THE DARK 
NOW I'M AFRAID THIS IS THE OPTIONS WE'VE GOT AN ON THE CASE 
IT CAN BE MADE OF PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD O IF YOU LOOK OR TITANIUM 
UM AND THE NEAREST WE'VE GOT TO SET IT SPONGY THERE I GUESS SO RUBBER BUT UM 
I'M GONNA COME BACK TO THE ADVANTAGES OF TITANIUM AND BASICALLY IT CAN HAVE A FLAT SURFACE A CURVED SURFACE OR A DOUBLE CURVED SURFACE 
BUT I THINK IF WE WANNA USE STANDARD COMPONENTS WE'RE GONNA HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH ANYTHING MUCH BEYOND THAT 
OKAY WHAT DOES THE INTERFACE LOOK LIKE 
UM WELL PUSH BUTTON THAT'S THAT'S THE ONE WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH 
UM WE CAN HAVE SCROLL BUTTONS AND THE THE SCROLL BUTTON CAN INCORPORATE A PUSH 
SO YOU CAN HAVE TO LOOK ON A MOUSE WHERE YOU CAN USE IT TO GO UP AND DOWN 
CHANGE VOLUME OR CHANNEL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND PUSH IT 
SELECT SOMETHING 
UM YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE SCROLL BUTTONS UM THIS IS MAYBE GETTING A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED BUT UM IT'S AT THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE 
AND WE CAN ALSO INCORPORATE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY ON THE REMOTE BUT THIS WILL INCREASE THE COST 
UM THE ELECTRONICS THAT ACTUALLY MAKES THE DEVICE WORK WE'VE BASICALLY GOT THREE 
SIMPLE REGULAR ADVANCED AND THE PRICE GOES UP SO WE CHOOSE EACH OF THIS 
IF WE WANT THE NICE CHIP ON THE SIMPLE THEN WE CAN ONLY HAVE PUSH BUTTONS 
ALL THE OTHER FANCY INTERFACE DESIGNS GO TO THE WINDOW I'M AFRAID 
UM PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR A REGULAR CHIP AND YOU CAN HAVE SCROLL BUTTONS 
IF YOU WANT THE ADVANCED CHIP TO OBVIOUSLY COSTS MORE ABOUT IT THAT'S WHAT YOU AND IF YOU WANT THE L. C. D. DISPLAY 
AND THE MANUFACTURING DEVISION TELL ME THAT THEY HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED UM SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER DEVICES 
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS BUT I THINK THEY THINK IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT AND WE MIGHT WANT TO INCORPORATE IT SOMEWHERE 
UM OU OUR REAL EXPERTISE IS IN PUSH BUTTONS I HAVE TO SAY BUT MAYBE YOU THINK THAT'S OLD TECHNOLOGY 
AND WELL I I THINK WE'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS 
WE CAN EITHER GO FOR A REALLY CHEAP MODEL KEEP ALL OF THE COSTS DOWN 
UM WHICH MEANS A FLAT PLASTIC CASE WITH AN ORDINARY BATTERY AND SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS 
ARE WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS A BIT NICER I THINK IT UM WON'T NECESSARILY L UH LOOK LIKE A PINEAPPLE BUT UM 
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE A GOOD THING 
SORRY 
UM BUT IT COULD HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND IT COULD HAVE MULTIPLE SCROLL BUTTONS 
AND IT COULD HAVE THE THE COMPANY'S NEW DEVELOPMENT OF THE UM SAMPLE SENSOR AND SPEAKER 
SO THANK YOU 
YEAH I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE 
UM 
MANUFACTURING DIDN'T ACTUALLY GIVE ATTACH ANY PRICES TO ANY OF THIS I'M AFRAID 
YEAH MM-HMM 
BANANA 
WE WE COULD WE COULD DO UM A DOUBLE CURVED RUBBER IN WHICH WOULD ALLOW UM SAY A BANANA 
BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY I SEE FROM MY NOTES THAT IF WE DO THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A PUSH BUTTON IS THE INTERFACE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING FANCIER 
YEP 
I IF YOU DO F. UH F. N. F. EIGHT AGAIN IT'S IT'LL 
I THINK IT YEAH YOU YOU WILL DO ONE 
HMM 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH I'D I'D CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT IDEA 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE FANCY SHAPES IN IT AS WELL WE CAN'T FOR EXAMPLE HAVE A DOUBLE CURVED CASE IN TITANIUM UNFORTUNATELY 
AND THE THE HAVING THE THE THE SCREEN ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA 
'CAUSE UM OTHERWISE WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING UP THE PRICE NOT ONLY FOR PUTTING BUILDING THE L. C. D. NO BUT FOR THE ELECTRONICS AS WELL 
THERE IS THAT 
DO YOU WANT SCROLL BUTTONS ON THAT AS WELL 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
I THINK I THINK THAT'S A G NICE CLEAN DESIGN IT'S PLAYING TO OUR STRENGTHS WHICH ARE IN PUSH BUTTON TECHNOLOGY 
YEAH 
BUT WE CAN IMPLEMENT IT WITH SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS WHICH IS MUCH CHEAPER 
IN FACT 
OH THAT'S REALLY NICE 
HMM 
MM 
WE WE COULD ACTUALLY DO IT IN RUBBER INSTEAD OF PLASTIC IF YOU'D RATHER IF YOU FEEL OF YOU LIKE THE SPONGY 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
OH UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE COSTING INFORMATION 
I I IN TERMS OF WORKABILITY I I THINK THE THE TWO FRONT RUNNERS ARE THE STANDARD BATTERY OR THE KINETIC 
BUT I'M SORRY I DON'T FIGURES ON THE DIFFERENCE IN COST 
AND AND HOW MUCH YOU DO HAVE TO KEEP IT MOVING 'CAUSE I'M CONSCIOUS THAT WATCHING T. V. CAN BE QUITE A SED SEDENTARY ACTIVITY 
YEAH 
TRUE YEAH M MORE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY 
OH RIGHT OKAY I'D THAT THAT'S SOMETHING I MAYBE SHOULD HAVE COVERED 
UM 
CHIP ON PRINT IS JUST A MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUE UM AND I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT I THINK BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE I HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE 
I I IT IT'S JUST THE WAY THAT THE THE THE UH THE THE WAY IT'S C IT'S ACTUALLY BUILT AND YOU YOU PRINT ONTO THE CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE YOU MIGHT PRINT ONTO PAPER 
WELL IF IF SARAH'S KEEN ON A SPONGY FEEL 
THE THE RUBBER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE SAME AS YOU HAVE ON THIS LITTLE STRESS BALLS SO IT'S YEAH 
YEAH 
I'D I'D NEED TO TALK TO MANUFACTURING AGAIN ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S ACTUALLY POSSIBLE BUT I AGREE IT'S UH SOUNDS LIKE A NICE IDEA OF IT IS 
I SHOULD I SHOULD OR 
WHICH I THINK TECHNICALLY IS JUST PUSH BUTTON AND UH I'D CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT THAT THAT BRINGS THE COST DOWN QUITE A LOT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE IN EX THE COMPANY'S AN EXPERT ON 
YOU KNOW I THINK THE THE COMPANY'S S NEXT PROJECT SHOULD TO DESIGN A BETTER OVERHEAD DEVICE THAT SWITCHES IMMEDIATELY 
YEAH 
YES 
YEP 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YES 
SO WHEN YOUR DAD'S SITTING THERE OVERRIDING YOUR DECISION 
GOING ON WE'RE GONNA WATCH THIS YOU CAN BRING TO YOUR OWN REMOTE AND BE LIKE ZAP NO WE'RE GONNA WATCH THIS 
YEP 
AND SO FAR 
SO FOR UM WELL BUDGETING AS WELL IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT INTERCHANGEABLE 
COMPONENTS 
SO THIS AT THE MARKET 
I WAS THINKING TITANIUM I WAS THINKING IT'S JUST I HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY PICTURES OF IPODS AND THEY'RE ALSO MINIMALIST AND SHINY 
YEAH BUT IT'S KIND OF POINTLESS ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
LET'S DELEGATE 
YEAH MAYBE 
OR 
I THINK POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE MORE USEFUL IF KATE WENT NEXT 
UM 
YOU CAN EVEN HAVE THEM IN DIFFERENT FLAVOURS AS WELL 
SO THAT IF YOU JUST WANNA SIT THERE AND CHEW ON THE REMOTE IT COULD BE LIKE PEAR FLAVOUR YEAH 
SCRATCH AND SNIFF 
A WIND UP 
BEAR BEAR IN MIND IT HAS TO BE THE COLOURS AND STYLES OF THE COMPANY 
SO WHAT I HAD BEEN THINKING WAS SOMETHING CHUNKY AND YELLOW AND PLASTIC WITH BLACK BUTTONS WITH A LOGO ON IT 
BUT UM 
I I DON'T KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS TO KEEP IT EXACTLY THE COLOURS OF THE REAL REACTION COMPANY 
IT'S JUST WHAT I'D UNDERSTOOD WE'D BE DOING 
THAT'S BEFORE I HEARD ABOUT ALL THIS HOT TIPS ABOUT THE FUTURE FRUIT WISE 
SHALL WE WAIT 'TIL I'VE 'TIL I'VE SHOWED YOU WHAT WELL MY EXTENSIVE PRESENTATION ON WHAT SORT OF INTERFACES ARE AVAILABLE 
YOU DID SEEM TO INCLUDE JUST ONE MORE DETAIL WHAT I'VE GOT THOUGH 
SO SO MINE'S A BIT POINTLESS 
RIGHT 
F. N. AND F. EIGHT DID YOU SAY 
I DON'T HAVE IT ON MINE THOUGH 
SHOULD I DO IT AGAIN 
RIGHT THEN 
I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENT INFORMATION THEN WHAT KATE SAYS JUST 
THAT MY METHOD WAS TO LOOK AT THE WELL MY MY INSPIRATIONS 
WHICH WAS A BIG COLLECTION OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT MODELS OF REMOTE CONTROLS AND OTHER THINGS THAT IS A SIMILAR SORT OF THING INCLUDING M. P. THREE PLAYERS UH 
LIKE YOU KNOW HI FI REMOTES NOT JUST TELEVISION AND THESE THINGS 
UH HAVING A THINK ABOUT THE FEATURE OF EA THE FEATURES OF EACH ONES 
UM WHAT FUNCTIONS WE ACTUALLY AND AND THEN HOW TO GROUP AND ARRANGE THIS IN THE ACTUAL 
THE ACTUAL PLASTIC OR RUBBER HAND HELD PIECE 
OH I'VE BEEN ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THE IPOD STYLE SCROLL WHEEL WHICH 
WELL I COULDN'T FIND A THE PICTURE OF THE IPOD WE ONLY LINKED TO A WEB BROWSER 
SO I COULDN'T COPY AND PASTE IT BUT IT HAD A SIMILAR THING AT THIS THING IN THE RIGHT 
IT HAS UH SCROLL WHEELS WITHOUT WITHOUT A DISPLAY BUT THEY THEY SCROLL LIKE A COMPUTER MOUSE 
SO I WAS THINKING THAT UH UM A REALLY SIMPLE 
A REALLY SIMPLE INTERFACE WITH JUST A COUPLE OF SCROLL THINGS ON IT UM AND THEN INSTEAD OF A DISPLAY THE DISPLAY COULD APPEAR IN THE TELEVISION SCREEN 
LIKE I GUESS AN EXISTING 
SKY OR CABLE ONE DOES 
LIKE YOU KNOW YOU PRESS ENTER AND IT COMES UP WITH WHAT'S SHOWING ON THAT CHANNEL TO THE MOMENT 
AND YOU CAN DO YOU CAN SCROLL ALONG AND IT'LL SHOW YOU WHAT'S ON ON THE NEXT HALF HOUR 
AND YOU SCROLL UP AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S ON THE OTHER CHANNELS WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING 
THE SAME CHANNEL ON THE SCREEN 
UH BUT I'M ALSO EQUALLY TAKEN WITH THIS CHUNKY PLASTIC KIDDIE REMOTE 
UM WHICH IS REALLY NICE AND FUN AND GOOD TO HOLD AND NICE BIG EASY BUTTONS TO PRESS BUT STILL QUITE SIMPLE AND QUITE COST EFFECTIVE 
SO 
WHAT SEEMS KIND OF IDEAL FOR ME WOULD BE IT JUST HAVE 
A FAIRLY SIMPLE UH NOT FANCY BUT NOT TOTALLY MINIMALIST I MEAN JUST PRETTY SIMPLE PLASTIC 
PROBABLY I WAS THINKING YELLOW AND BLACK JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE COMPANY'S COLOURS WITH VERY VERY FEW BUTTONS 
BUT THAT WOULD CORRESPOND TO A SCREEN THAT WOULD APPEAR IN THE TELEVISION SCREEN LIKE YOU KNOW 
JUST SMALL ALONG THE BOTTOM INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF HAVING THE IPOD STYLE DISPLAY SCREEN ON THE ACTUAL REMOTES WHICH IS FOR TOO EXPENSIVE 
AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT A SCREEN SITTING THERE IN FRONT OF YOU YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE TO APPEARING UH IN THE SCREEN IN FRONT OF YOU 
IT DOESN'T OBSCURE MUCH OF THE ACTUAL PICTURE YOU'RE WATCHING 
AND SO ON THAT YOU CAN JUST MUCH ON THE SAME WAY AS AN EXISTING SKY REMOTE SCROLL ALONG SCROLL UP AND DOWN 
AND UH AND I DEFINITELY SUPPORT UH THE EASE OF PLASTIC AND OR RUBBER 
I MEAN TITANIUM WOULD BE GREAT BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE A BIT TOO EXPENSIVE AND IT KINDA SPACEY 
IF WE'RE K TRYING TO KEEP IT 
COLOURFUL AND SLIGHTLY ORGANIC THEN I THINK TITANIUM'S TOO 
FUTURISTIC 
YEAH 
WHEREAS A PLASTIC'S SO CHEAP AND SAY AND MOULDABLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
UH THEN 
AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT POINTLESS AS WELL I THINK 
LIKE WHEN WHEN WHEN YOU'VE GOT WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE SCREEN THERE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANYTHING FANCY JUST A LITTLE MENU SHOWING YEAH 
A MENU YOU GO INTO ONE MENU AND THEN IT CAN HAVE YOUR DIFFERENT OPTIONS WHETHER YOU WANNA CHANGE THE SETTINGS OR THE 
YOU KNOW YOUR INFORMATION ABOUT PROGRAMME THAT'S ONE AT THE MOMENT 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S TO TAXING TO UH 
S ENGINEER 
UM 
BUT AS FAR ACTUALLY ARRANGING THEM LET ME GO BACK TO THE 
AT THE PICTURE OF THE KIDDIE ONE 
AND I QUITE LIKE IT 'CAUSE IT'S JUST SMOOTH AND HAND HELD AND IT'S GOT THESE EASILY REACHABLE BUTTONS THAT QUITE NICELY UH SPACED OUT 
SO SOMETHING A BIT LIKE THAT WITH 
BUTTONS ARRANGED IN A 
KIND OF CIRCLE 
UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT 
I I WAS THINKING NOT ACTUALLY SCROLL LIKE A LIKE MOUSE SCROLL BUT YOU KNOW A I CAN'T QUITE D UH DESCRIBE IT 
YOU SEE 
IN THE IN IN THE RIGHT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM IS THE MOUSE 
YEAH SO WHERE THE MOUSE IS LIKE THIS IS STYLE THING WHERE YOU C HAVE UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT 
AND ENTER IN THE MIDDLE SO YOU PICK YOUR MENU AND THEN YOUR DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND WHEN WHEN YOU CLICK ON EACH ONE 
IT YOU CAN GO INTO A NEW MENU FOR THAT 
I'M GETTING A BIT UH SPECIFIC HERE 
REALLY WE'D HAVE TO USE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU BUT 
IF I DON'T THINK I CAN GET IT UP ON THE SCREEN 
UH HERE WE GO 
RIGHT 
WELL THE IPOD SPINNING WHEEL IS UH REALLY COMPLICATED 
IT DOES SCROLL BUT IT IS HUGELY COMPLICATED 
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT 
THEM THEY'RE TERRIBLE 
BUT THEY ALL HAVE THIS THIS FEATURE OF THIS UH 
IT'S NOT QUITE A SCROLL WHEEL BUT 
IT'S A KIND OF SELECTION IN THIS CIRCLE WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
YEAH LIKE UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT 
WHICH IS GOOD 
AND THEN AND THEN 
YEAH SO I MEAN THERE A CHANNEL UP AND DOWN VOLUME UP AND DOWN 
NEXT APPEARING PROGRAMMES UP AND DOWN UH AND THEN ALSO WHEN YOU GET INTO THE DIFFERENT MENUS ON THE SCREEN 
IT'S GOT YOUR THINGS LIKE SETTINGS AND CONTRAST UP AND DOWN 
SO ALL YOU REALLY AND SO THESE FOUR BUTTONS WITH THE ENTER IN THE MIDDLE 
AND THAT'S IT 
LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS ONE 
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MISPLACE OR L OR ELSE 
MIGHT TAKE UP YOUR WHOLE LIVING ROOM 
POSSIBLY 
YEAH 
THAT ALSO AS POSSIBLE 
JUST 
UH JUST SOMETHING ELSE I NEED TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IS HAVE YOU HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE ON A REMOTE 
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE VOLUME UP AND DOWN BUT THEY BOTH SAY V. ON THEM WHICH WHEN YOU FIRST LOOK AT IT 
YOU EXPECT THAT TO BE THE DOWN BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A DOWNWARD POINTING ARROW BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE V. TO INDICATE THAT IT'S THE VOLUME IS 
UH WE DO NEED TO AVOID LITTLE AMBIGUITIES LIKE THIS 
BUT WE WOULDN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC VOLUME UP AND DOWN 
IF WE'RE HAVING THE SCROLL WHEEL THEN IT'S GONNA DOUBLE UP IS ALL THE OTHER UP AND DOWN FUNCTIONS 
BUT THEN THAT'S COMPLICATED 
IT SOUNDS GREAT 
I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS IT BEFORE ABOUT IT SOUNDS FANTASTIC 
SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE G A REALLY GOOD ECONOMICAL IT WOULD MAKE THE WHOLE THING A LOT LIGHTER MORE CONVENIENT 
YEAH 
'CAUSE IT'S REALLY A QUITE ATTRACTIVE THOUGHT ISN'T IT 
IT'S LIKE YEAH A GOOD SELLING POINT 
BUT IT DOES DEPEND HOW MUCH 
I MEAN HOW MUCH IT COSTS AND HOW MUCH MORE DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH IT NEEDS 
DO YOUR EXERCISES WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING THE T. V. 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING AS WELL 
DO YOU NOT THINK IT MIGHT NEED 
LIKE A KIND OF 
A HARD PLASTIC INNER SHELL WITH THE ACTUAL DELICATE WORKINGS INSIDE AND THEN A KIND OF SPONGY 
YEAH S THICK SPONGY COVER IS IT FEELS LIKE THE WHOLE THING'S SPONGY BUT ACTUALLY YOU'RE NOT DAMAGING ANYTHING BY SQUEEZING IT 
BECAUSE I MEAN YOU COULD JUST GET CARRIED AWAY WITH THE WITH THE TAC 
YEAH 
WELL YOU DO GET A BIT CARRIED AWAY WITH THINGS THAT ARE TACTILE YOU JUST WANNA STROKE THEM AND SQUEEZE THEM AND 
JUST COPY THE IN IN THE LEFT 
NO UM A SCROLL 
WELL LIKE FOUR BUTTONS UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT WITH ENTER IN THE MIDDLE THAT WILL CORRESPOND TO A MENU ON THE SCREEN 
YEAH I'D LIKE PUSH BUTTONS WITH 
SO PUSH BUTTONS 
NO IT'S STILL IT'S STILL PLUGGED IN ON MINE ACTUALLY 
NOW IT'S GONE AGAIN 
OH YES 
GREAT 
I DON'T THINK SO 
PLAY DOH 
I RESPOND TO THREE 
NO WORRIES 
OKAY FIRST THING I WANT TO ADDRESS IS UM ONE OF THE POINTS THAT FLORENCE BROUGHT UP WHICH WAS UH CURRENT COST OF THE COMPETITION DEVICES 
SIMILAR TO THE ONES THAT STEPHANIE UH SHOWED US AND AND THEY'RE UH TWENTY TO SIXTY EUROS DEPENDING ON UH BRANDING 
SOME OF THEM THAT HAVE A HIGHER BRAND RECOGNITION OR IN THE MORE EXPENSIVE AND 
BUT I THINK THAT WITH THE CURRENT UM PRICE THAT WE'RE SEARCHING FOR WE'RE WELL WITHIN EVEN IN THE LOWER END OF THE UH OF THE MARKET 
BUT I'M GOING TO MOVE ON IT MORE INTERESTING UM MORE VIBRANT THINGS 
SO I INVESTIGATED THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET IN GREATER DETAIL AND MY UH THE THEME OF WHAT I WAS TO WORK ON WAS UH TREND WATCH 
AND 
I KNOW THAT YOU ALL OR A DISTANCE FROM CUTTING EDGE MARKETING RESEARCH SO YOU KNOW I'M JUST GONNA TRY TO CLOAK IT IN REALLY PROFESSIONAL TERMS HERE 
WHAT'S HOT FRUIT AND VEG 
SPONGY 
AND THIS IS ALL OVER THE CATWALKS PARIS MILAN AND I'M TALKING ABOUT CLOTHING FURNITURE SHOES 
THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING CHANGE FROM PAST YEARS BECAUSE IT AS MUCH MORE ORGANIC UM SOME WOULD SAY APPROACHABLE 
AND I THINK IF WE'RE TO REFASHION OUR VIEW OF WHAT WE WANT IN A REMOTE CONTROL WE SHOULD PERHAPS THINK ABOUT INCORPORATING TECHNOLOGICALLY INTERESTING FABRICS 
AND SOME OF THE BOLD COLOURS NOT A SIMPLE 
HANDSET 
SO 
I ALSO DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON UM 
WHAT AGAIN OR THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES IN UH DECISION MAKING ABOUT UH PURCHASING 
FANCY 
FUNCTIONAL IS IT 
AND OF THE FANCY AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE TERM I'M I'M THINKING POLISHED ELEGANT YOU KNOW KIND OF INNOVATIVE BUT A CUT ABOVE 
THIS IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT IS THE NEXT FINDING WHICH IS TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
THIS IS INTERESTING 'CAUSE I THINK IN THE LAST MEETING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IS BEING AS IMPORTANT 
BUT MAYBE WHAT'S INNOVATIVE IS HAVING IT SIMPLE WITH UM WITH UH TECHNOLOGICALLY SUPERIOR FABRICS OR UH YOU KNOW DESIGNED AN INTERESTING SUBSTANCES 
SO IF SO 
AGAIN PRETTY LOW I MEAN IT'S THE TOP THERE BUT EACH OF THE UH FANCY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE OR FOR MORE IMPORTANT 
SO 
I THINK WE SHOULD CLOAK THE STREAMLINED REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE IN A SERIES OF FRUIT FRUIT THEMED SLEEVES 
Y YEAH YOU KNOW 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
I WAS THINKING THOUGH THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING SOMETHING UH LIKE PATTERNED YOU KNOW SO YOU KNOW SOMETHING SIMILAR TO A SUMMER DRESS 
YOU KNOW IT WOULD HAVE LIKE FRUIT AND VEG IS THAT WE ACTUALLY MAKE THIS SPONGY 
THEY COULD BE INI INITIALLY I THOUGHT WE COULD START WITH KIND OF UM FRUIT THAT WOULD SUIT KIND OF UH A LONG UH HAND HELD 
SO BANANA PINEAPPLE AND PRO 
UM IT COULD ACTUALLY THE SLEEVE COULD TAKE UP A LOT OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE REMOTE CONTROL WE'D JUST NEED TO GET REDUCTIONIST ON IT 
THEY COULD BE INTERCHANGEABLE THEY'RE SPONGY THAT GOES BACK TO ERGONOMIC 
AND THE YOUNGSTERS LOVE 'EM FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY EVERYONE CAN HAVE THEIR OWN 
SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS CHANGING 
THIS CONCEPT 
EVERYONE HAS A T. V. REMOTE BUT THEN WE DID IN THE FACT THAT THEY COULD EACH HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL FRUIT 
THAT'S WHAT'S HOT ON THE CATWALKS 
SO THIS IS MY 
THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING 
Y YEAH 
BUT I THINK I THINK WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW US PERHAPS A PERSON IN THE FAMILY WHO HAD THE MOST OPINION ABOUT IT WE ALL NEED A REMOTE 
BUT THE PERSON WHO IS REALLY PERHAPS ACTIVE IN PERSONALISING 
I'M THINKING THE TEENAGER 
THE SOMEONE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE WOULD GO OUT AND GET THIS ADDITIONAL THING THE SAME WAY AS YOU MENTIONED THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET THE CELL PHONE COVERS 
YEAH 
WE NEED PLUS I THINK 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THIS IS AN IDEA AND I I YOU KNOW THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE RESEARCH HAS UH HAS SHOWN 
SO I REALLY OPEN THIS UP TO UH ANY OTHER FEEDBACK 
THIS SPONGY FRUIT AND VEG 
THANKS 
ALRIGHT 
I I JUST HAVE MY OR AT THE MARKET GUYS 
IS SPONGIEST YEAH 
THAT WOULD ADD 
MM-HMM 
THEY ARE AND THEY THEY WOULD FULFIL THE UH FIRST UM PRIORITY WHICH IS FANCY 
I THINK MANY OF US WOULD ASSOCIATE THIS WITH FANCY 
SOMETHING ELSE WE COULD DO IS UH 
CALL IT SOMETHING THAT'S FRUIT AND VEG 
ORIENTED 
WE COULD CALL IT UH 
THE NAME 
WELL IT WOULD BE UH A A VERY SIMPLE PRODUCT THAT WOULD HAVE A SPONGY SLEEVE THAT WOULD BE INTERCHANGEABLE 
SO 
THAT YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE 
AND THEN WE COULD KEEP IT TITANIUM 
YEAH 
OR S OR SMELLY 
SCRATCHY 
UH WELL I WAS REALLY THINKING A LOT ABOUT THE A. UH THE IMAC KIND OF GEL GEM TONE 
IT'S HOT ON THE STREETS GUYS 
MM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 
THAT SOUNDS GOOD 
ANY DO YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WOULD BE A COST DIFFERENCE 
UM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF OF THIS COULD OF THE FANCY MODEL COULD BE DONE IN TWELVE EUROS FIFTY 
HMM 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M BEING QUITE SERIOUS WHEN I SAY THAT THAT UM THE THINGS I MENTIONED ARE HOT 
BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING MIGHT BE TO CHOOSE ONE 
YOU KNOW IF IF WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS IS UM SOME OF THESE THINGS AREN'T JUST F AREN'T FEASIBLE 
MAYBE WE COULD SOMETHING ABOUT NAMING WE COULD CALL IT YOU KNOW BLACKBERRY 
THAT'S UH 
ALRIGHT WELL LET'S SEE THEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT YEAH I'M TRYING TO STREAMLINE MINE A LITTLE BIT 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
MM 
THANK YOU KATE 
MM 
UH I THINK UM 
FLORENCE RESOLVED IT BY 
F. EIGHT AGAIN 
MAYBE 
MM 
HMM 
IT'S A DUPLICATION 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IT UH M MAKE IT 
UH NICE 
UM HMM 
MM 
WOW 
DO YOU THINK WITH UM 
IT SEEMS THAT THAT UH YOU GUYS ARE QUITE KEEN ON THE PLASTIC PERHAPS THE SOMETHING REMINISCENT OF THE CHILD'S REMOTE 
DO YOU THINK WE COULD PUT IT IN A IN A FRUIT COLOUR 
AND HAVE TO ABSTRACT 
YOU KNOW WE COULD CALL LIKE A FRUIT NAME BUT IT WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE ABSTRACT 
MM-HMM 
I'M JUST JUST THROWING IT DOES 
YEAH 
I'M THINKING MAYBE WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABSTRACT IF THE 
DESIGN CONSTRAINTS ARE SO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NICE 
GOOD POINT 
I'VE USED KINETIC IN TERMS OF WATCHES AND IT'S VERY VERY UH HANDY YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE 
UM THAT IT'S THERE 
IT'S 
MM-HMM 
IT COULD IT IN WITH THE FANCIFUL DESIGN IS UH YOU KNOW THROW THE BANANA YOU KNOW JUST GOTTA KEEP IT MOVING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT I COULD MARKET THAT IS A UM AS A A I WAS THINKING ACTUALLY A A COST SAVER DOWN THE ROAD IN TERMS OF BATTERY YOU KNOW 
MM-HMM 
YOU KNOW KIND OF THE 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING 
I'M SOLD 
MM 
KIND OF LIKE AN INTERNAL EGG 
YEAH 
AND WITH SPORTS ON TELEVISION 
YOU KNOW 
I SEE 
THEN I'LL JUST SAY I SUPPORT EITHER FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW I SUPPORT EITHER DECISION THAT THE DESIGNERS MAKE ONE THAT 
NO WE CAN'T ACTUALLY 
THAT'S WHY I WAS LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER 
MM 
SOUNDS GOOD 
THAT'S REALLY ALL I GOT GUYS 
UM ALMOST THERE'S NO MORE THING I HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ATTACHMENT WILL OPEN 
UH UH 
OKAY 
WE'LL OPEN THAT WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT 
IN THE MEANTIME 
CLOSING THINGS DOWN OKAY 
LET'S SEE WHAT THIS THING DOES 
DOES IT CAME UP TOGETHER OR DISAPPEAR ONE OF THEM OR WHAT 
UH WE COME UP TOGETHER WE'RE GOOD 
OKAY 
ARE WE READY TO START 
OKAY 
IT'S NOW QUARTER OF FOUR 
THIS IS A F ANOTHER FORTY MINUTE ONE IS IT WILL NEED TO FOR TWENTY FIVE 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
OUR AGENDA IS IS BEFORE FOR ME TO OPEN THE MEETING FOR US TO GO OVER THE PREVIOUS MINUTES 
THEN FOR THE TWO IF YOU TO PRESENT YOUR PROTOTYPE AND FOR YOU TO GO UM SARAH PRESENT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA 
WE THEN HAVE A FINANCE ASPECT WHICH IS A SPREADSHEET AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET 
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ALL THINKING OF UH MY 
UM BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY GIVEN A FORTY MINUTE TIME PERIOD TO GET IT ALL IN INCLUDING THE PRODUCTION EVALUATION 
SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A VERY FAST TRACK 
OKAY 
UM AND SO YOU CAN SEE THAT'S WHAT WE DO NEXT IN THIS THING 
SO THE FIRST THING I HAVE TO DO IS CLOSE THIS IS THAT I CAN GET IT 
WHERE IS IT 
I NEED TO OPEN MINE 
NOT THE AGENDA 
NO THAT TH I WANT THE MINUTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MINUTES 
THAT SHOULD BE THREE MINUTES 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH FROM MEETING THERE IS IT ALRIGHT WITH YOU IF I DON'T SWITCH TO TO SHOW JUST USE IT IS IS 
'CAUSE THIS WAY I CAN MORE EASILY FLIP IT 
OKAY UM OBVIOUSLY ALL OF US WERE HERE FOR THE LAST MEETING WE REVIEWED THE PREVIOUS MINUTES BEFORE THAT UM EACH OF YOU MADE YOUR PRESENTATIONS 
UM WE DISCUSSED THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES BASED ON WHAT WAS PRESENTED IN THESE PRESENTATIONS 
THE MARKET TREND OF FRUIT AND VEG MM SPONGY UH FANCY AND ELEGANT MORE THAN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE AND THAT MORE THAN EASY 
UM WE DECIDED CHIP ON PRINT WOULD BE USED 
UM WE WOULD USE PLASTIC WITH A RUBBER CASING I THINK WAS THE CONSENSUS POWERED BY KINETIC ENERGY 
THERE WAS ONE DECISION MADE IN THE CURVATURES OR DOUBLE CURVATURE OR STRAIGHT 
UM PERHAPS THE PROTOTYPE WILL GIVE US AN INKLING OF THAT 
UM LOOKING LIKE A SCROLL BUT IT'S REALLY A PUSH BUTTON TECHNOLOGY EXCUSE MY SPELLING 
UM THAT WAS ACTUALLY ONE IS 
THAT IS UH BEHIND THE SCENES IS PUSH BUTTON WHICH WE UH ACCORDING TO KATE HAVE A VERY GOOD UH GRASP ON DOING THAT IN PRODUCTION 
UM WE DECIDED THAT SEPARATE FASHIONABLE COVERS COVERING YOUR FRUIT AND VEG MIGHT BE A SEPARATE PRODUCT THAT COULD BE SUGGESTED TO MANAGEMENT 
UM AND SO SUGGESTED UM YELLOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS WITH THE COMPANY LOGO 
A SLOGAN AND IMAGE MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO USE 
UM WE DID HAVE A FEW PRODUCTION ISSUES AND COORDINATION OF THE VARIOUS BITS AND WE HAD SOME CONFLICT OF IDEAS AND COST CONSTRAINTS AND WE RAN OUT OF TIME 
UM WE HAD TO FOLLOW THAT UP AND PREPARE FOR THE LAST ONE 
AND UH WE CLOSED AS TO RUN OUT OF TIME 
SO THAT A FAIR PRESENTATION OF WHAT HAPPENED 
OKAY BACK TO THIS MEETING 
UM WE'RE DOWN TO THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION 
OVER TO YOU 
UH TWO 
OH 
UH-HUH 
'KAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH I SEE THE ON OFF'S IN THE BACK 
AND THEN YOU CAN USE YOUR THUMB 
I COULD USE THIS THING UNLESS IT'S REINFORCED HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE 
YOU KNOW YEAH 
HMM 
OKAY 
THE NEXT TIME SO EVALUATION 
UH IF THAT'S IF YOU'RE FINISHED 
OH SORRY 
TRY AGAIN 
HMM 
WELL WE WILL SOON UNFORTUNATELY 
COME ON 
NO 
ELEGANT 
ELEGANT 
MM 
YEAH 
THE CHUNK 
I THINK BETWEEN THE TWO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE TWO IS TRUE 
IT'S MORE TRUE THAN FALSE ABOUT A TWO 
MM-HMM 
TRENDY 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
EXCESS BUTTONS 
NO 
BETTER MORE INTUITIVE BUTTONS YES 
NO 
I LIKE IT 
MM-HMM 
YES THE INSTINCT SAYS TRUE 
YEAH THAT'S NOT A CHEAP THING TO GET 
HMM 
I THINK WE'RE GOOD 
OKAY 
WE'RE A LITTLE OVER HALFWAY THROUGH THE MEETING AND THE NEXT BIG THING IS THE FINANCE 
OKAY 
YEP 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
AND SO YOU CAN USE IT SAYS THE SAME THING IT HAD NOT LOST ITSELF THANK GOODNESS 
AND WE'RE GOING TO RAISE WHAT'S CALLED A SP A SPREADSHEET THAT THEY PROVIDED TO ME 
UM 
AND 
IT SAYS FILL IN THE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS YOU PLAN TO USE IN YOUR DEVICE 
HAND DYNAMO BATTERY KINETIC SOLAR CELLS 
OKAY 
YEAH 
UM 
WHAT'S A HAND DYNAMO 
OH SHOOT FORGET THAT 
KINETIC IS UM AND HOW MANY OF THIS WILL WE NEED PER WE ONLY NEED ONE 
OKAY 
ELECTRONIC SIMPLE CHIP ON PRINT AND WE'LL NEED ONE OF THIS 
OKAY AND WE ONLY NEED ONE OF THIS 
OKAY THE CASE WILL BE UNCURVED AND FLAT OR A SINGLE CURVE OR A DOUBLE CURVE 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT SINGLE CURVE 'CAUSE OF THE THE CHUNKINESS 
IT'S THAT'S UH UH NO 
AND THAT'S 
OH THAT'S THE THE ON THAT GOES LIKE THIS 
RIGHT 
ONE SINGLE CURVE 
OKAY CASE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENTS 
PLASTIC WOOD RUBBER TITANIUM SPECIAL COLOUR 
WE HAD THE SPECIAL COLOUR 
AND DID WE SAY PLASTIC 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WE'LL COME BACK IF WE CAN AT THE RUBBER BEING ADDED TO THE MOMENT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE 
INTERFACE BUTTON PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE USING ISN'T IT 
WHOOPS DON'T WANT THAT NOT YET 
UM 
NO IT JUST SAYS PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE 
BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS THEY'LL BE IN A SPECIAL COLOUR OF BLACK 
AND THE BUTTONS 
WHA WHAT IS THE BUTTONS MADE OF RUBBER 
SO WE NEED ONE OF THEM 
AND ARE THEY ANY SPECIAL FORM 
'CAUSE THE RATE WE'RE GOING WE CAN PUT THE RUBBER ON TOP 
OH 
OKAY 
UM 
LET'S PUT THAT RUBBER ON THEN OF THE CASE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENT 
UH WE ONLY NEED ONE OF THEM 
UM AND THE TOTAL COST HAS BEEN CALCULATED AS NINE POUNDS TWENTY OUT OF THE TWELVE AND A HALF WE WERE ALLOWED 
WE'RE ON 
THAT'S SO 
OKAY I'M GOING TO SAVE THIS INTO OUR 
DESKTOP PROJECT DOCUMENTS 
OKAY 
SO OUR PROJECT DOCUMENT BIT 
YEAH 
THERE WE ARE 
THAT'S THE ONLY EXCEL DOCUMENT THAT WILL BE IN THERE IS IT'S THERE FOR ALL OF US 
OKAY SO ARE THEY UNDER TWELVE FIFTY 
YES GO TO THE PROJECT EVALUATION NEXT SLIDE 
RIGHT 
UM THE PROJECT PROCESS SATISFACTION WITH FOR EXAMPLE THE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 
YEAH LEADERSHIP 
TEAMWORK 
MEANS OF HAVING WHITEBOARD THE DIGITAL PENS AND ALL THAT KIND OF GOOD THINGS 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
SO WE WENT OVER ALL THESE THINGS AND WE'RE SATISFIED WITH ALL THE ABOVE 
UM DID WE FOUND ANY NEW IDEAS 
SO WE ACTUALLY WORKED WELL AS A GROUP 
RIGHT 
OR THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET 
YES 
SO THE PROJECT EVALUATED 
YES 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
AND WE'VE THEREFORE WE HAVE TO DO THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND DO THE MEETING SUMMARY I HAVE A FINAL REPORT TO PRESENT UM AND THEN WE'RE DONE 
WE DONE GOOD AND WE'RE FINISHED IN TIME 
I BELIEVE THAT IS THE END OF OUR MEETING 
THANK YOU MELISSA 
I KEEP FORGETTING WHETHER I'VE DONE THIS 
YEP 
TO DO 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
UM WELL I DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH TO ADD 
UM THE THE CASE OOPS THAT'S THE UH ON OFF BUTTON JUST COME OFF OUR PROTOTYPE 
THE THE CASE CAN BE THERE UM SPONGY RUBBER OR HARD PLASTIC 
WE'RE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE ABOUT A COMBINATION OF THE TWO BUT IT CAN BE EITHER OF THIS 
WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT 
UM AND SO FOR THE THE ACTUAL COMPONENTS UM UH STEPH JUST SAID THIS IS A QUITE A CHEAP DEVICE TO MANUFACTURE 
WE HAVE SIMPLE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS UM WHICH PROVIDE ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY WE NEED 
UM THE UM THE ADD THAT ACTUALLY DOES THE UM INFRARED IS TO THE END 
IT'S THE STALK OF THE BANANA OR IT'S JUST THE THING AT THE END OF THIS VERSION 
UM SO THAT'S FOR MATERIAL 
COLOUR WELL UH STEPH'S THE EXPERT IN COLOUR 
UM WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR RESTRICTIONS ON THAT 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT TO SAY REALLY 
A BANANA 
WOULD YOU CARE TO EXAMINE THE PROTOTYPES SEE HOW THEY FEEL IN THE HAND 
YES THAT'S SO THAT YOUR INDEX FINGER AUTOMATICALLY GOES STRAIGHT TO IT 
AND IT WAS PARTLY WE THOUGHT THE DESIGN LOOKED BETTER 
BUT IT COULD BE MOVED IF IF MARKETING FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE ON OFF BUTTON ON A DIFFERENT PLACE 
HMM 
AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE DESIGN THERE'S NOT A LOT TO WRONG THE COMPONENTS ARE CHEAP TO MAKE 
MM-HMM 
YES A PLAIN SIMPLE CLEAN DESIGN 
WELL WE HAVE GOT IS TRENDY FURTHER DOWN BUT 
ELEGANT I DON'T KNOW IF I'D CALL THEM ELEGANT 
STYLISH YEAH 
YEAH I'D 
I D I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AIMING AT WITH THIS CONCEPT 
I THINK WE'RE USING SIMPLE COMPONENTS THAT ARE GONNA BE ROBUST BUT NOT PARTICULARLY INNOVATIVE 
VERY 
YEAH 
WE HAVE THE WORRY ABOUT HOW ROBUST IT WILL BE IF IT'S IT'S CURVED IS A BANANA BUT SPONGY 
I THINK YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
SO THAT'S FALSE 
NO 
YEAH I THINK THEY'RE DIFFERENT AREN'T THEY 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK OUR INSTINCT IS THAT IT SHOULD BE PRETTY CHEAP TO DEVELOP 
WE HAVEN'T GOT A LOT OF EXPENSIVE COMPONENTS IN THERE 
I'D PUT IT IT IN I THINK BUT I DUNNO WHAT DO YOU 
YEAH TRUE IT MIGHT BE THE YEAH YEAH TRUE 
TRUE 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
THAT WAS THE CRANK WIND UP CRANK ON THE SIDE 
JUST ONE 
UH UH YEAH I THINK WE CAN DO IT ALL WITH SIMPLE 
JUST CHECKING THAT 
YEAH SIMPLE 'CAUSE WE'VE JUST GOT PUSH BUTTONS SO WE CAN DO IT ALL WITH SIMPLE WHICH IS THE CH SHOULD BE THE CHEAPEST 
YEP 
YEAH THAT THAT ONE IS SINGLE CURVE ISN'T IT 
UM DO WE HAVE 
I I THINK YOU IT MEANS YOU REVERSE THE CURVE 
YEAH 
YEAH I D I DON'T THINK WE NEED THAT FOR THREE OF THEM YOU CAN DO A BANANA ONE SINGLE CURVE YEAH 
YEAH CAN WE DO SOME WHAT IFS 'CAUSE IT MAY I MEAN I I STILL QUITE LIKE THE IDEA OF COMBINING PLASTIC AND RUBBER MYSELF 
BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE COST I GUESS 
YES 
YEP 
DO WE NEED TO SAY HOW MANY BUTTONS ARE 
OR DO IS IT JUST ONE 
'KAY 
UH THEY'LL BE RUBBER YEP 
ACTUALLY DOES THE DOES SPECIAL MATERIAL MEAN THAT PLASTIC IS NOT A SPECIAL MATERIAL 
'CAUSE I THINK THEY CAN BE PLASTIC 
YEAH 
THEY COULD BE PLASTIC WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT A DOUBLE CURVED CASE 
IT'S JUST ONE ISN'T IT 
WHAT WE'RE ON 
MORE PROFIT 
DO YOU DO YOU NEED TO DOUBLE CLICK ON THAT IT OPEN IT 
YEAH YEAH THE PLAY DOH WAS BEST I THOUGHT 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK WE'RE A GOOD TEAM ACTUALLY 
I'M NOT SURE ALL THE WIRES ARE REALLY GREAT THOUGH 
I THOUGHT SO 
YES 
YES 
OH HANG ON WE HAVEN'T HEARD 
MM-HMM 
ABSOLUTELY AND IT'S KEPT US WITHIN BUDGET 
AND THEN WE GET THE PRODUCT LAUNCH PARTY 
PRODUCT LAUNCH PARTY 
ABSOLUTELY 
YES 
ALRIGHT 
WELL 
YEAH WELL YOU SEE EACH MADE IN WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH YELLOW DOUGH 
THIS IS THE ONE 
THAT I MADE 
IT IS UH CURVED EASY TO HOLD HAND HELD NICE AND SMALL WITH BIG EASY BUTTONS 
THIS IS 
LIKE A SCROLL BUT THEY ARE PUSH BUTTONS AND THEY ENTER TAKES YOU INTO THE DIFFERENT MENUS 
OF COURSE WE NEED SOMEONE WHO'S EXPERIENCED WITH THE TELEVISION 
I MEAN THIS IS THE INFRARED THING THAT'S GONNA ZAP AT THE TELEVISION 
UH I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO MAKE THAT BUT I'M SURE IT WILL WORK 
UH THIS IS ON OFF SWITCH 'CAUSE I THINK WE DO AND THAT AND I THINK IT GIVES IT A NICE BALANCE 
AND IT'S GONNA HAVE THE LOGO IMPRINTED ON IT UH IN THERE 
UM SO FOR WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY MADE OF WELL THE FUNCTION OF THESE BUTTONS IS UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT ON THE DIFFERENT MENUS 
UH POSITION I PRESUME THAT JUST MEANS 
RIGHT RIGHT ON IT EASY TO USE 
THE MAIN FEATURE OF IT IS JUST A SIMPLE DESIGN SIMPLE LACK OF UH BUTTONS ALL OVER THE PLACE 
RIGHT 
FROM 
CURVED KIND OF SMOOTH HAND HELD MAKES IT FEEL NICE TO HOLD 
UH MATERIAL I THINK KATE'S GONNA TACKLE THAT QUITE A BIT BUT I THINK WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT OPTIONS 
BECAUSE WE DID MAKE A ANOTHER ONE WHICH WE UH SO ON THE SHAPE OF BANANA IT'S JUST IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS YELLOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS 
LIKE JUST LIKE THIS BUT IN THE SHAPE OF A BANANA 
WHICH IS ALSO NICE AND EASY TO HOLD AND FEELS GOOD AND HAS A SIMILAR SORT OF SCROLL PUSH BUTTON TECHNOLOGY 
JUST A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DESIGN 
ALSO WITH ON OFF SWITCH AND INFRARED UH I HAD ENVISIONED IT IN HARD SMOOTH PLASTIC 
SO LIKE UH WELL I DUNNO WHAT'S IT LIKE 
I GUESS LIKE AN EXISTING REMOTE CONTROL BUT MOLDED AND SMOOTH 
WHEREAS OTHERWISE WE'D THOUGHT LIKE WITH THIS ONE OR MIX AND MATCH 
JUST WE WERE GONNA SEE WHAT YOU THOUGHT THE UH A MORE SPONGY RUBBER COVER WITH SPONGY BUTTONS 
SO WE HAVE THE TWO OPTIONS WE CAN FOLLOW EITHER THE SMOOTH HARD PLASTIC OR THE SPONGY RUBBER DEPENDING ON COST RESTRAINTS 
AND WHAT WE 
WELL WHAT CONCLUSION WE REACH WHEN WE DISCUSS IT 
UH MATERIAL YEAH THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT MATERIAL 
CAN I SCROLL DOWN IN THERE AND SO WHAT ELSE 
WELL COLOUR I THINK I DEFINITELY HAVE A PREFERENCE TOWARDS BRIGHT YELLOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS 
BECAUSE THAT'S THE COMPANY COLOURS BUT IF ANYBODY'S GOT ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS I'M QUITE WILLING TO CONSIDER THEM AS WELL 
SO IT JUST DEPENDS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THESE IDEAS AND IF I'M YEAH MAYBE KATE YOU BETTER SAY WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THEM 
I THIN AS FAR AS FOR THE FRUIT OR ORGANIC THEME I GUESS THIS ONE IS OBVIOUSLY FRUIT SHAPED 
THIS ONE HAS AN BANANA YEAH 
THIS ONE HAS AN OBVIOUS CONNECTIONS TO FRUIT BUT BECAUSE IT'S AROUND AND MOLDED 
IT KINDA MAKES YOU THINK SORT OF ORGANIC TOUCHY FEELY KIDDIE IT'S MORE LIKE YEAH 
YOU'D EXPECT TO TO BE LIKE A CHILD'S SORTA TOY REMOTE CONTROL INSTEAD OF A REAL IN WHICH I QUITE LIKE THAT SORT OF IMAGE 
'CAUSE IT'S VERY BIG AND CHUNKY AND CHILD FRIENDLY AND 
HOLD THEM YOU SEE YOU KNOW 
CURVATURE IS IT TO YOUR LOOKING 
IF YOU DON'T WANNA TIRE OUT YOUR THUMBS AFTER ALL 
YEAH 
BREAKING OH RIGHT 
WELL YOU SEE THAT'S WHY HARD PLASTIC WOULD BE QUITE A GOOD THING FOR IT BECAUSE THEN IT'D JUST BE RIGID 
YEAH WE REALLY LIKE WE REALLY LIKE THAT DESIGN I MEAN IT LOOKS JUST LIKE A LOGO THAT ARRANGEMENT OF THE KEYS 
LIKE A C LIKE A COMPASS POINT YOU KNOW JUST UP 
DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT AND WE THINK WE COULD MAKE THAT QUITE A GOOD FEATURE 
AND IT'S LIKE THE THE IPOD SCROLL WHEEL BUT BETTER 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH I MEAN IT THAT'S WHAT IT MAKES ME THINK OF MOBILE PHONES 
I WAS TRY I WAS THINKING MOVING YOUR THUMB LIKE THIS WHAT DOES THAT REMIND ME OF 
IT'S TEXTING 
HMM 
YEAH 
I MEAN THE THING SO WE DO NEED TO DEVELOP OUR TECHNOLOGY IF I MEAN ACTUALLY HOW TO PROGRAM THE MENUS AND WHAT SORT OF 
YOU KNOW TEXT BOX IS GONNA APPEAR TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN BUT WE DO DEFINITELY THINK THAT IT'S A VIABLE OPTION 
OH YEAH WE'RE FINISHED 
YEAH WHAT ABOUT PRICE IS THAT GONNA GO IN THERE AS WELL 
PRICE OF MATERIALS 
NOT THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT WE CAN WE CAN PRETEND 
IT DEPENDS WHAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY FANCY REALLY 'CAUSE WHEN I THINK OF FANCY 
I THINK IF IT'S GOT LOTS OF EXTRA SORT OF FRIPPERIES AND YOU KNOW LIKE 
BAROQUE CURLINESS AND WHICH 
I'D CALL THIS QUITE UH MINIMALIST 
SIMPLE AND PLAIN BUT I MEAN I DO IS WHAT IT IS HEAVILY RELIANT ON APPEARANCE INSTEAD OF PURE FUNCTIONALITY IS IN THAT RESPECT IT IS QUITE FANCY 
I THINK JUST MAYBE WE NEED A DIFFERENT WORD OTHER THAN FANCY I'D SAY MAYBE AESTHETIC 
LIKE STYLISH OR AESTHETIC 
FANCY 
DID YOU JUST BREAK THE PEN 
WELL DO WE'LL JUST CALL IT FANCY THEN 
YEAH I THINK WE N WE NEED TO THEY'RE BOTH YELLOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS IT'S JUST THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MORE DOUGH TO REPRESENT UH THAT 
BUT IF YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE BANANA SHAPE WITH THESE BITS AS BLACK 
SO WHAT WE ARE REALLY NEED TO DECIDE IS WHETHER WE WANT THE ACTUAL BANANA SHAPE 
OR JUST A A PURELY BLOB OR SOME SORT OF ABSTRACTION IN BETWEEN THE TWO THAT ISN'T THAT IS MORE CURVED 
LIKE A BANANA BUT THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY RECOGNISABLE AS A BANANA YOU KNOW WITH THE GROOVES AND THE STALK AND STUFF SO 
SO THAT'S MAYBE NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DECIDE JUST RIGHT NOW IS IT 
JUST SOMEWHERE A LONG THE SCALE OF IN BETWEEN THESE TWO 
YES 
OH YES 
WELL MAYBE ONLY A TWO OR A THREE THEN 'CAUSE IT'S NO WE STILL HAVEN'T DECIDED ABOUT SPECIFIC SPONGINESS OR SPECIFIC 
YEAH I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT'S GONNA WORK BUT 
NO 
NO 
WELL IT IS QUITE IT IS QUITE QUIRKY I THINK 
IT COULD BE QUITE A GOOD BRAND LIKE 
A GOOD LITTLE OBJECT 
UH WE ALSO AND TH THINK ABOUT THE ENERGY 
SO AT THE KINETIC ENERGY 
IF IT'S IT IS GONNA BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WITH THE KINETIC ENERGY 
YEAH BUT WE HAVEN'T 
COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THAT SIDE OF IT YET SO WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY SURE ABOUT THAT BUT YEAH 
YEAH 
I WOULD SAY MAYBE A TWO 'CAUSE WE STILL WE NEED TO UH GET SOMEBODY ONE WHO IS GOOD WITH THE PROGRAMMING FOR THE MENUS 
AND THINGS 
I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST LIKE I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE EV YOU KNOW IN A NORMAL CHUNKY REMOTE EVERY BUTTON RES I MEAN MINUS SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
WHEREAS THIS ONE HAS ONLY GOT THE FOUR BUTTONS AND THEY ALL THEY MEAN EVERYTHING DEPENDING ON WHAT MENU YOU'RE IN 
UH WE NEED SOMEBODY TO DEVELOP THAT 
YEAH 
JUST PUTTING IN EXCESS BUTTONS 
SO FAR AS IF WE'RE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE I'D SAY IT IS QUITE INNOVATIVE 
BECAUSE THERE AREN'T REALLY MANY THAT HAVE THIS MAIN IDEA INSTEAD OF ALL THE EXTRA BUTTONS 
I MEAN I KNOW WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING INVOLVING INTERNET OR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
BUT BUT WE ARE AT THE UPPER END OF THE PUSH BUTTON MARKET 
WELL JUST KINETIC THEN 
IT'S THE WIND UP 
WHAT DOES DOUBLE CURVED MEAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
OH NO WE DON'T NEED THAT 
NO 
SINGLE CURVED I'D SAY 
I 
I JUST WANNA SAY PLASTIC 
IT'S JUST BUTTON 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL YEAH LIKE THE COMPASS POINT ONE 
YEAH THEY COULD BE PLASTIC 
GREAT 
YES 
YEAH 
AND PLAY DOH 
YEAH WELL 'CAUSE I MEAN IT'S SO HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU MEAN JUST WITH WORDS AND POINTING AT PHOTOGRAPHS AND SAYING 
WELL WE QUITE WANT THIS BUT IMAGINE IT ROUNDER 
SO MUCH BETTER JUST TO GO AND 
YOU KNOW THIS IS IT THIS IS WHAT WE WANT 
YEAH 
SPONGY 
AND I'D NEVER HEARD OF THE KINETIC ENERGY BEFORE SO 
GOOD WORK IS A DESIGN TEAM BECAUSE WE 
OH YES 
YES 
YEAH 
AND THE THE ONLY FALSE ONE IS BECAUSE WE'VE CHOSEN 
TO KEEP A SIMPLE OLD TECHNOLOGY WHICH OF IT WORKS PERFECTLY WELL I SEE ONE POINT IN IMPROVING ONE OF IT WORKS SO 
YEAH 
SO WE DO COUNT AS I THINK EXCELLENT OR NO 
BRING IN THE ICE SCULPTURES 
YEAH 
THAT'S WHAT I SAID ICE SCULPTURES 
SO THAT THE END OF THE MEETING 
RED 
AGENDA THREE 
MM 
I LIKE THE FACT THAT ON BOTH OF THEM THE KEYS PLAY SUCH A PROMINENT ROLE 
IT'S REALLY KIND OF A 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BUT IT'S ALSO LIKE TEXTING YOU DON'T 
YEAH 
IT'S ALSO IN TERMS OF UM BEING LOST IT'S IT'S QUITE IT LOOKS QUITE DIFFERENT 
YOU KNOW I I D I HAVE SEVERAL FOUR REMOTES 
AND THEY ALL LIKE THE SAME UNTIL YOU GET UP CLOSE AND YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW THIS IS REALLY IDENTIFIABLE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO OKAY 
UM 
SHALL I TAKE YOUR UH POWER 
OH 
OKAY 
THIS IS GOING TO BE A HEAVILY INTERACTIVE EVALUATION 
AND THE METHOD HERE IS TO EVALUATE THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL IN TERMS OF THE USER REQUIREMENTS AND THE HOT TRENDS INTRODUCED BY THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT 
SO THIS MEANS WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER THE PRIORITIES THAT WERE RAISED BY UH THE CONSUMERS 
A AS WELL AS INCORPORATE ALL OF OUR INSIGHT INTO THIS UH EVALUATION EXERCISE 
SO I'M GOING TO GO AND SO THE WHITEBOARD AND I'VE MADE A LIST OF CRITERIA TO LOOK AT 
AND SO I'M GONNA I'M GONNA LEAVE THIS UP AS THE LAST THING 
BUT FOR THE EVALUATION IT'S GOING TO BE ONE IS TRUE AND SEVEN IS FALSE GOING OVER THESE DIFFERENT CRITERIA 
SO ONE TRUE SEVEN FALSE AND I'M GONNA NOW IS THE UM THE BOARD 
OKAY 
SO UM 
FANCY 
TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
EASY TO USE TRENDY 
BUTTONS 
EXCESS BUTTONS GOOD BUTTONS 
UGLY 
SELLABLE 
AND THERE 
AND IN FACT I HOPE THAT UH YOU ALL INTRODUCE SOME ADDITIONAL TERMS 
BECAUSE THESE ARE THINGS THAT UM HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP SOME OF THEM SEEM RATHER CLOSE LIKE THEY OVERLAP 
MM YEAH PRICE 
WE'LL PUT PRICE UP TO THE TOP 
UM 
OKAY SO 
DID YOU SAY 
OH OKAY SO 
WHA HOW DO WE FEEL IN TERMS OF USE THIS FANCY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I YEAH SO ON THAT RESPECT I THINK WE'LL GO WITH THAT RESPECT 
YEAH 
ELEGANT 
YEAH IN THESE AREN'T THE EXACT TERMS THAT THE UM 
YEAH 
ELEGANT 
WE'RE GON LET'S SEE ELEGANT ALTHOUGH THE THE THE PEOPLE THE WORD IN THE START S SO 
YEAH 
NO THAT UM 
YEAH UH THE UH IS FANCY 
SO LET'S LET'S TAKE IT AT THE NEXT LEVEL 
WELL OKAY SO IN TERMS OF ELEGANT FANCY 
WE'LL CALL IT I. F. UM DO WE DO WE THINK THAT PERHAPS AND MAYBE WE SHOULD SAY THE YELLOW 
SHOULD WE GO WITH THE YELLOW IN TERMS OF I THINK THAT'S A REALLY SUPERIOR THEY'RE BOTH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IS A BANANA 
I THINK THAT MANY OF US ARE ABSTRACT ENOUGH TO LOOK AT THE YELLOW ONE AND SAY WE'LL CALL IT THE BANANA 
AND OF THE TWO I REALLY LIKE I AM I LIKE THE BANANA BUT I I DO LIKE THE CHUNK 
NO BUT I MEAN IN TERMS WE HAVE TO EVALUATE ONE OF THEM 
UNLESS DO YOU GUYS WANNA EVALUATE BOTH 
OKAY 
SO WE SAY TRUE 
UM 
TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
YEAH 
SO WE'LL SAY WE'LL SAY UH FALSE 
EASY TO USE 
ONE IS THAT INAPPROPRIATE 
OKAY 
OH PARDON ME 
UM 
TRENDY S AND I SAY SPECIFICALLY SPONGY FRUITY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO TWO 
UM 
ARE THERE EXCESS BUTTONS 
THAT IS FALSE 
UM GOOD WELL DESIGNED BUTTONS INTUITIVE BUTTONS 
TRUE 
UGLY 
PEOPLE DON'T RESPOND WELL IT UGLY 
SELLABLE UH QUIRKY YOU KNOW SOMETHING PEOPLE LIKE UH YEAH 
YEAH I DO IT 
OH YEAH 
AND I WAS I WAS THINKING OF OTHER THINGS UM IN TERMS OF UH COULD WE SAY IT'S COST SAVING 
WITH THE 
YEAH WITH THE ENERGY 
IT IS GOING TO BE KINETIC 
YEAH WE'LL C WE'LL SAY IT'S A COST SAVING ENVIRO 
UH SO YES 
WELL YOU'RE STILL IN THE PLAY DOH STAGE 
ANYTHING ELSE 
INCLUDING PRICE DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT PRICE OR OTHER FEATURES 
OKAY 
SO TRUE ONE OR SHOULD I GO TO TWO OR THREE 
OKAY 
UM 
THERE 
ANYTHING ELSE YOU GUYS CAN THING OF 
AND I'M GONNA ACTUALLY CHANGE A COUPLE OF THIS IS THEN I'M GONNA INSTEAD OF UGLY I'M GONNA SAY IT'S ATTRACTIVE AND THEN MAKE THAT TRUE 
SO THAT 'CAUSE I HAVE TO DO AN AVERAGE 
AND THEN UM EXCESS BUTTONS 
EXACTLY 
WOW WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL 
YEAH B YOU KNOW IS IT DOESN'T RUIN THE POLARITY 
MM-HMM 
OR L. C. D. 
YEAH 
WELL IF YOU GO UH LET ME KNOW IF IF ANY OF THIS UM IF YOU IF YOU ALL CAN THINK OF ANY OTHER UM THING TO CHANGE HERE IF YOU THE IF YOU THINK I SHOULD CHANGE THE INNOVATIVE OR ADD OTHER FEATURES 
IF NOT I'LL AVERAGE THOSE 
OKAY 
SO 
UM OKAY HOW ABOUT IF I UH PASS THIS BACK TO YOU AND I'LL UH FIGURE OUT THE AVERAGE HERE 
THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE'S HELP WITH THAT 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX 
YEAH 
SURE 
YES 
YEAH 
YEP 
I THINK WITH THE MARKETING ELEMENT OF UH FRUIT SHAPED I I MEAN I THAT REALLY OPENED MY YES 
I I ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF THOUGH 
YES 
I CAN GIVE YOU A NUMBER UM IT'S UH THE AVERAGE EVALUATION SCORE IS ONE POINT EIGHT EIGHT 
SO IT MEANS WE YOU KNOW I CAN I CAN SPELL IT IT 
THERE WERE SIX TRUE OR ONES FOR UM PARDON ME 
TWO IS ALMOST TRUE OR CLOSE TO TRUE IS THAT WAS FOUR POINTS 
AND THEN UH ONE FALSE SEVEN POINTS SO SEVENTEEN DIVIDED BY NINE WE'RE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO 
I WOULD SAY THAT'S EX EXCELLENT 
IN TERMS OF UH UH HOW MUCH WE ADHERE TO THE IDEALS OF THE UH MARKET PLACE 
TO MAINTAIN OLD TECHNOLOGY EXACTLY 
YEAH YEAH 
YES 
OKAY 
NICE 
SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT 
YEAH 
UM I ONE THING I WANT TO DO IS UH I THINK THE MEETING'S DONE 
YEAH 
UM ONE THING I W I WANNA DO IS SAVE EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT FILES BECAUSE I DON'T THINK EVERYTHING IS SAVED 
THE RIGHT FILES 
FINAL MEETING MARKET 
I'M ALSO 
I'M THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY TOOL TRAINING 
I DON'T MIND 
UM 
LET'S SEE 
GOOD JOB I GOT POCKETS TODAY 
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW DO YOU THINK OR 
OH 
RIGHT HERE WE GO 
OKAY 
I THINK THAT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS THE CAT 
LITTLE SMILEY CAT THERE 
UM AND THIS WOULD BE 
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY INDEPENDENT UH THEY'RE VERY INTELLIGENT COMPARED TO DOGS MAYBE 
UM AND THEY CAN BE VERY VERY AFFECTIONATE 
SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK SO BUT I KNOW VERY AFFECTIONATE CATS 
UM 
UM AND THEY CAN LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES 
SHALL I RUB THAT IT ACTUALLY 
THAT'S QUITE GOOD 
CAN I JUST CHECK 
SO THIS JUST A TELEVISION REMOTE 
BECAUSE A LOT OF UM 
SYSTEMS ARE KIND OF T. V. VIDEO COMBINED NOW OUR T. V. D. V. D. COMBINED 
AND ONE OF THE MOST ANNOYING THINGS AS HAVING LIKE FIVE REMOTES ON THE HOUSE 
SO IF YOU'VE GOT A COMBINED SYSTEM IT COULD BE A COMBINED REMOTE 
OR IS IT JUST A TELEVISION THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING 
COMES TO YOUR WHISTLE 
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE BACK TO THE START 
UM IF YOU GRAB THE KIND OF UH SLIDE AT THE LEFT AND PULL IT DOWN 
I'M NOT EXACTLY CLEAR ON WHAT WE'RE DESIGNING THE REM REMOTE FOR 
SO THIS A MUN MULTI FUNCTIONAL ONE OR DO WE DECIDE THAT OURSELVES AS WE GO AWAY AND WORK ON IT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
RIGHT SO 
START OF THE FIRST MEETING 
OH 
RIGHT SO AGENDA OF THE FIRST MEETING 
WHERE WE UH 
WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE MINUTES FOR THIS MEETING 
WE UH OR TO GET ACQUAINTED 
SO DOES EVERYONE WANT TO SAY WHO THEY ARE 
THAT SEEM SENSIBLE 
AND I'M ALASTAIR AND I'M THE PROJECT LEADER 
ALRIGHT OKAY SO TOOL TRAINING 
UM 
PROJECT PLAN 
SO DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY UH THOUGHTS 
SO AT THE TOOL TRAINING THAT UH IS REQUIRED 
NEITHER AM I 
UH I SEE SO WE SHOULDN'T REALLY BE 
OH RIGHT OKAY SO 
SO WE HAVE THE PROJECT TEAM WHICH IS IT UM BASICALLY TO COME UP WITH A NEW R REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE 
UH WE HAVE UH THE STARTING BASE WAS THE ORIGINAL WHICH HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE NOW FOR A PERIOD OF TIME 
AND UH OR DO IS IT UH 
TO MAKE THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE UH MORE USER FRIENDLY THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE AND IT TO BE TRENDIER 
TO BE WITH IT AND THEREFORE TO UH TO GET A BIGGER MARKET SHARE AND BIGGER AUDIENCE 
SO UM METHOD OF DOING THIS IS UH SPLIT UP AS YOU CAN IS NOT UH 
THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THE CONCEPTIONAL DESIGN AND THE DETAILED DESIGN 
SO UM 
IN EACH OF THIS UH PHASES WE'LL UH BASICALLY BE HANDING OVER IT YOURSELVES THE DESIGNERS OF THIS UH 
THIS DEVICE 
AND UH HAVING UH MEETINGS IS THAT WE CAN UH DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY UM COME UP WITH A 
BETTER BETTER INST IMPLEMENT THEN WE HAD BEFORE 
AND THEREFORE UM HAVE A SUCCESSFUL UH CONCLUSION TO THE DAY 
UM 
AND YOU'LL BE DOING UH VARIOUS DESIGNS UH THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO MEET THIS AND 
SO WE'VE GOT TOOL TRAINING 
TRY OUT WHITEBOARD 
OH 
SO WE WILL UM 
RIGHT SO EVERYONE'S TO UH SUPPOSEDLY UH DRAW THEIR FAVOURITE ANIMAL OVER IN THE WHITE BOARD OVER THERE 
I GUESS THIS IS UH MAKE SURE THE WHITEBOARD WORKS 
SO UH I DON'T KNOW WHO WISHES TO GO FIRST 
DO YOU WISH TO GO F HAVE A FIRST BASH AT UH WHATEVER 
UH UH 
BUT NOW YOU YOU HA YOU'LL MOVE IT FROM THE MICROPHONE AND THE CAMERA 
I TAKE OUT THAT 
I WOULD I WOULD GUESS SO 
OR 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 
I MEAN YOU DESIGNERS ARE MEANT TO COME UP WITH THESE SORT OF THINGS 
NEXT 
I DON'T SEE SO THERE'S ANY AND IT 
THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE 
I MEAN WHATEVER 
EXACTLY 
WE'VE HAD MORE TIME TO PREPARE OVER THIS SIDE SO WE'VE ALL STUCK OUR BITS AND PIECES IN OUR POCKETS 
THE THREE PENS ARE UNDERNEATH 
YOU GET MARKS FOR ARTISTIC IMPRESSION 
SO YOU'RE JUST DOING THE FACE 
RIGHT UM 
WELL I'VE NOT ACTUALLY HAD TOO MANY PETS UH OVER MY UH TIME 'CAUSE IT BE HONEST WITH YOU UH 
I'M NOT TOO KEEN ON THEM ANYWAY 
NOT TO WORRY 
SO WHAT MY DAUGHTERS HAVE GOT TO THE MOMENT IS THEY'VE GOT UH A FEW FISH AND SO HOPEFULLY UM WON'T PROVE TOO DIFFICULT TO DRAW 
OH 
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT MY ARTIST ARTISTIC WORK IS USELESS AS WELL 
ANYWAY UM 
AND UH ONE OF THE BEST UH THINGS ABOUT FISH IS THAT THEY DON'T REALLY TAKE UH TOO MUCH LOOKING AFTER BECAUSE UH WITH MOST OF THE ANIMALS IF YOU'RE GOING AWAY ON HOLIDAY OR WHATEVER 
YOU'VE GOTTA SPEND MONEY OR GET A FRIEND OR WHATEVER TO LOOK AFTER THEM FOR YOU 
WHEREAS IF YOU GOT FISH 
YOU JUST GOTTA PUT THE FOOD IN A A A DRIPPER FEED WHICH FEEDS THEM OVER THE UH COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT YOU'RE AWAY AND UH 
CHANGE THE WATER EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS AND BY IN A FEW PLANTS SO 
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY KEEP DYING UH FISH OR UH OR NOT OUR OUR OUR REASONABLE PETS IN THAT UH THEY'RE LOW MAINTENANCE 
RIGHT 
OKAY UH IF WE'RE STILL ALL WITH US 
RIGHT OKAY SO 
WORK HAS BEEN DONE IN UH 
THIS UH PROJECT WHERE BY UM TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS UH THE UH EXPECTED UH SELLING PRICE 
THAT INFORMATION HAS COME FROM OUR MARKETING MANAGER HERE 
SO WE'RE LOOKING TO SELL INTERNATIONALLY NOT JUST IN EUROPE 
WE'RE LOOKING AT UM HAVING OUR PRODUCTION COSTS LIMITED T UH TWELVE AND IN HALF EURO PER UNIT 
AND THEREFORE MAKING A PROFIT MARGIN OF UH WELL NOT ACTUALLY A PROFIT MARGIN IT'S UH BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE OVERHEADS AND VARIOUS OTHER COSTS AT UH TAKE UH FROM UH 
FROM THAT TO GIVE YOU YOUR PROFIT MARGIN PER UNIT 
AND SO DEPENDING WHAT THE UH THE OVERHEAD UH COSTS ARE WILL DETERMINE UH HOW MANY UNITS WE'RE UH LOOKING TO SELL OR PROJECTING TO SELL AT THIS POINT IN TIME 
SO UM 
EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTE CONTROL FIRST IDEAS 
NEW REMOTE 
SO I GUESS WE'RE LOOKING AT UM HAVING A DISCUSSION AT THIS POINT IN TIME TO HELP UH YOU UM FOLKS DESIGN OUR OUR NEW MODEL IS IT WERE 
SO UH ANY ANY THOUGHTS 
OKAY SO SO BASICALLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME UM WE'RE LOOKING FOR A DEVICE THAT IS UM ROBUST AND 
AND THEREFORE UH WON'T GET DAMAGED TOO EASILY 
UM WE'RE LOOKING FOR A DEVICE 
THAT IS UH WHAT WAS THE OTHER THINGS YOU SAID THERE 
EASY TO USE 
SO 
AND SO 
OKAY 
OH 
MM-HMM 
UH I W UM BASICALLY I'LL GET BACK TO YOU IN THAT 
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME SENSIBLE 'CAUSE AS YOU RIGHTLY SAID THERE'S NOTHING MORE ANNOYING THAN HAVING THREE OR FOUR DEVICES LITTERED ABOUT THE UH ABOUT THE ROOM 
AND UH 
IS A DEVICE FOR 
FOR ALL REMOTES 
HMM 
BUT IS IT IN A SENSE IT'S OUR UM MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE 
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH THE THE THE ONE DEVICE AND THEN HAVE FEW BUTTONS ON IT IT 'CAUSE YOU WANT YOU WANT SIMPLICITY AS WELL 
YOU WANT ANY IDIOT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT 
WHILST AT THE SAME TIME YOU WANT SO YOU RIGHTLY SAID IN REMOTE FOR ALL 
AND SO THESE ARE PROBABLY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE OPTIONS THAT UH HMM YOU COULD ARGUE THAT EXPERIENCE OF USING DEVICES AND SIMILAR DEVICES SO PEOPLE GET MORE AND MORE USED TO USING REMOTES 
THEREFORE THEY'RE MORE WITH HANDLING THEM THEREFORE YOU CAN MAKE THEM MORE COMPLICATED AS TIME GOES ON 
BETTER INSTRUCTIONS 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UM WELL WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE END OF THE MEETING 
SO UH WE HAVE TO UH START WINDING UP 
UM SO THERE NEXT MEETING IN THIRTY MINUTES 
SO UM 
RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT I. D. THE COME ON WHERE'S MY 
OH THERE WE GO 
YEAH 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR 
RIGHT 
SO WE'VE GOT FUNCTION 
UH WHAT HAPPENED TO THE 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
SORRY ABOUT THAT 
OKAY SO WE'VE GOT UM THE WORKING DESIGN 
FOR I. D. 
FOR U. I. D. THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
MARKETING THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION 
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSON BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH 
SO 
ARE WE ALL CLEAR WHAT OBJECTIVES WE'RE LOOKING TO MEET IN THE NEXT THIRTY MINUTES 
AND I GUESS I'LL TRY AND WRITE UP SOME MINUTES OF UH THIS MEETING TO UH TO GIVE IT TO YOU FOR THE NEXT MEETING 
TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT'S TRUE 'CAUSE DURING DURING THE COURSE OF OUR DAY WE MIGHT MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON INFORMATION OR MEETINGS THAT WOULD CHANGE WHERE WE'RE GOING 
BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT UH SHALL WE MAKE IT JUST A T. V. 
OKAY 
SO WE WILL DEPART 
WE WILL STAY HERE AND UH AND BREAK OFF 
AND I'LL DO MINUTES AND AND WE'LL SEE YOU IN HALF AND HERE 
OKAY 
RIGHT SO 
OKAY 
I'M NICK 
I AM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
TOOL TRAINING 
YEAH 
YES 
OKAY 
YOU'VE LOST UH YOUR MICROPHONE THERE 
OKAY YEAH 
I'LL I'LL 
SHALL I SEE IF I CAN GET ACROSS WITHOUT JUST TANGLING EVERYTHING 
OKAY 
THERE'S NO 
DIDN'T THINK OF THAT 
'KAY UH PENS ARE OVER HERE 
I'LL TRY THE RED PEN 
OKAY 
UM 
I'M GONNA GO FOR THE BEAR WHICH I'M BE ABLE TO DRAW VERY WELL BUT 
I'LL HAVE A BASH AT IT 
OH 
UH UH I LOST IT THERE 
I THINK I'VE JUST KNOCKED THE MICROPHONE 
UM 
WE'LL GO THEN WE'LL GO FOR A A S SMALL SMALL BEAR 
UM AND I LIKE MY ANIMAL THAT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE A BEAR BECAUSE UM 
I DUNNO MAYBE BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY CARTOON CHARACTERS MADE UP AFTER THE BEAR LIKE THE JUNGLE BOOK CHARACTERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
GREAT 
YES 
UM I WITH SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THE BUTTONS WERE A LITTLE SMALL SO THEY'RE QUITE HARD TO PRESS SO MAYBE WE MAKE SOMETHING WITH UH 
EASY TO PRESS BUTTONS 
SO THAT IS THE MAIN FUNCTION 
YES 
UM SORT OF EASY TO USE IS THE BUTTONS ARE ACCESSIBLE 
SO EASY TO USE AND SO 
YES 
SORRY YOU GO 
YOU GO 
YEAH 
YES 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE COULD UM HAVE BETTER INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE REMOTE 
OR ARE WE JUST DOING THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF OR SORT OF THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WOULD COME WITH IT 
'KAY 
OR NOT 
SLIDE FOUR 
OKAY 
YES 
'KAY YES 
I THINK YOU JUST SAID AT THE START IT WAS A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST STICK TO THAT UNLESS WE GET TOLD OTHERWISE 
'KAY 
OKAY THAT'S GREAT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I'M ROBIN 
I'M THE MARKETING MANAGER 
MM-HMM OKAY 
I DUNNO 
YOUR MICROPHONE'S JUST 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
WE CAN HAVE HAVE A WHOLE MENAGERIE 
RIGHT 
HELLO 
UM I'M GONNA GO FOR THE EDGE AND I'M GONNA DRAW ONE BADLY AS WELL 
OH 
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A DACHSHUND OR SOMETHING 
RIGHT 
THERE'S MY DOG 
UM I LIKE DOGS BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY LOYAL 
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS HAPPY SO WHENEVER WHENEVER YOU'RE FEELING SORT OF A BIT A BIT DOWN OR TIRED THEY'RE ALWAYS COMING UP AND THEY'RE ALWAYS UM QUITE EXCITED 
SO UM YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH A DOG 
AND THEY'RE ALSO GOOD FOR EXERCISE AS WELL 
YOU CAN SORTA GET IT AND THEY THEY SORTA NEVER GET TIRED 
AND AND WHEN THEY'RE TIRED THEY'RE QUITE CUTE AS WELL SO 
OKAY THAT'S WHY I LIKE DOGS 
GREAT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
I'VE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
UM ONE OF THE THINGS UM WE FOUND FROM THE MARKET RESEARCH IS THAT PEOPLE OFTEN GET CONFUSED BY THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS ON THEM AS WELL 
'CAUSE THERE'S QUITE OFTEN LOTS AND LOTS 
AND UM SOMETIMES UH THEY SORT OF REMOTE CONTROLS DEFEAT THEIR OWN PURPOSE BECAUSE YOU'RE SAT IN THE CHAIR AND THE REMOTE IS SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE ROOM 
SO WHEREAS IN THE PAST YOU'D HAVE TO GET UP TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL NOW YOU HAVE TO GET UP TO SORT OF PICK UP THE REMOTE 
SO SO I DON'T WE NEED TO SORT OF MAYBE THINK ABOUT HOW UM WE COULD MAYBE UH DEVELOP A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH MOVES AROUND THE ROOM 
I DON'T KNOW 
THAT'S THAT'S MAYBE SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE WHEN YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR TELEVISION BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I MEAN 
WE'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH UM ABOUT SORT OF YOU KNOW WHAT THE CUTTING EDGE SORT OF HAND HELD DEVICES OR 
AND A LOT OF THEM SORT OF SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE LIKE THEY'RE LIKE MINI LAPTOPS 
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD DEVISE A SYSTEM WHERE WHERE YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY SORT OF HOLDING A A MINIATURE COMPUTER WHICH IS CONTROLLING ALL YOUR YOUR SORT OF YOUR TELEVISION 
YOUR STEREO AND WHERE YOU KNOW IF YOU BUY A NEW THING THEN IT SORT OF YOU CAN LINK TO TO THAT AS WELL MAYBE 
OKAY 
IF YOU JUST CLICK RETURN IT SHOULD BE OKAY 
IT'LL GET RID OF THE MESSAGE 
IF YOU HIT JUST HIT RETURN AND IT SHOULD GET RID OF THE MESSAGE 
OH YOU'VE GOT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY COOL 
OKAY CHEERS 
YEAH 
NO 
WHAT IS IT 
I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO DO UM CONTROL F. EIGHT 
SHIFT F. EIGHT 
OH THERE IT'S DOING SOMETHING 
I THINK IT'S THAT LITTLE 
RIGHT 
THANK YOU 
MINE'S NOT QUITE AS COMPLICATED IS ALL THAT 
DID I PRESS FUNCTION 
YEAH 
OH 
UM 
OKAY SO I'M GONNA TALK A BIT ABOUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
I'M ALSO THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER SO YOU KNOW 
UM SO THE UM BASIC METHOD OF THIS IS TO SEND A SIGNAL FROM THE REMOTE TO THE TELEVISION SET IS THAT A DESIRED FUNCTION IS PERFORMED 
UM AN EXAMPLE OF THE FUNCTION COULD BE TO CHANGE THE VOLUME UP OR DOWN UH IS OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TWO DIFFERENT BUTTONS FOR THAT 
UM TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL THREE BY PRESSING THE NUMBER THAT YOU WANT OR BY CHANNEL UP OR DOWN 
UM TO SWITCH THE TELEVISION IN OUR OFF MAYBE A STANDBY BUTTON 
UM HERE OR TWO EXAMPLE REMOTES 
UM BY THE LIKE IF IT THEY BOTH HAVE UM KIND OF PLAY AND FAST FORWARD REWIND FUNCTIONS 
SO I THINK THEY INCORPORATE A KIND OF VIDEO FUNCTION WHICH WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
UH BUT AS YOU CAN USE THE LEFT REMOTE IS QUITE UM QUITE BUSY LOOKING QUITE COMPLICATED 
UM WHEREAS THE RIGHT REMOTE AS MUCH SIMPLER IT LOOKS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY 
UM SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE WOULD BE THE RIGHT REMOTE 
SO IT'S GOT NICE BIG BUTTONS IT'S GOT A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF BUTTONS 
UM THEY'RE NICE KINDA CLEARLY LABELLED 
UM I LIKE THE EASE OF THE KIND OF UM SYMBOLS LIKE THE TRIANGLES AND THE SQUARES AND THE ARROWS AS WELL AS THE WORDS IN THE UM KIND OF PLAY FUNCTIONS AND ALL THAT 
SO IT'S VERY VERY USER FRIENDLY AND IT'S GOT A LITTLE SPLASH OF COLOUR 
COULD MAYBE DO WITH SOME MORE CLEAR 
UM 
HMM 
DO WE GET IT IS THAT 
WELL YOU BE PRESENTING THAT IN A BIT 
HMM 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE CIRCULAR SECTION 
LIKE ALL OF THAT BOTTOM BIT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT YOU NEED NINE NUMBERS 
I MEAN HOW OFTEN DO YOU S SEVEN EIGHT AND NINE 
I THINK JUST ONE TO SIX AND THEN CHANNEL UP AND DOWN SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
LIKE HOW OFTEN DO YOU HIT NINE 
HMM 
UM SOME REMOTES HAVE KIND OF FAVOURITE OPTIONS WHERE IF YOU ALWAYS FLICK FROM CHANNEL ONE TO CHANNEL SIX 
UM IF THAT'S A FAVOURITE YOU JUST LIKE BY PASS TWO TO FIVE 
HMM 
MM 
UM 
BUT I THINK A LOT OF UM LIKE CABLE AND SKY AND STUFF THAT WOULD BE TEND TO ONE CHANNEL 
AND THEN YOU'D HAVE ANOTHER REMOTE FOR ALL OF THOSE CHANNELS 
LIKE TO GET TO FIFTY FIVE AND THE HIGHER NUMBERS 
YEAH 
BUT I SUPPOSE NINE'S NOT REALLY EXCESSIVE 
I SUPPOSE IT DOES MAKE A GOOD PATTERN 
OKAY 
UM I THINK THAT'S JUST FOR A VIDEO SO WE WOULDN'T NEED ANY OF THAT AT ALL 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO IS EVERYONE HAPPY WITH THAT 
RIGHT WELL THAT'S THE END OF MY PRESENTATION 
DO A LOT OF UM 
THERE'S KEY RINGS UM THAT YOU KIND OF WHISTLE IT OR CLAP AT I CAN'T REMEMBER AND THEN THEY WHISTLE BACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THAT'D PROBABLY BE REALLY SIMPLE THEY'RE CHEAP 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK IT'D BE REALLY EASY AND IT'D BE A BIG ADVANTAGE IF WE DID HAVE SOME SORT OF UM KIND OF WHISTLE BACK KIND OF FUNCTION 
'CAUSE THAT'LL SOLVE KIND OF THE FRUSTRATION OF LOSING IT 
YEAH 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
AND THAT WOULDN'T PUT OFF THE KIND OF OLDER GENERATION EITHER 
'CAUSE EVERYONE CAN WHISTLE OR CLAP AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE KIND OF SCARED OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY 
'KAY WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED THAT WE DON'T NEED A TELETEXT BUTTON HAVEN'T WE 
SO THAT ONE OF THE 
HMM 
RIGHT 
YEAH I THINK SO SO ZERO TO NINE 
HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH LIKE THE VOLUME OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 'CAUSE YOU DO AND UM KIND OF BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST AND EVERYTHING AS WELL 
MY DAD WAS WATCHING A FILM THE OTHER WEEK AND IT WAS TOO DARK SO I HAD TO GO THROUGH IT AND TURN THE BRIGHTNESS UP 
WELL IF WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT SLEE SLEEK AND SEXY AS WELL 
HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE REMOTES WHERE KIND OF UM THE BOTTOM BIT SLIDES DOWN SO THERE'S KIND OF UM EVERYTHING ELSE REVEALED 
SO YOU DON'T USE IT THAT MUCH YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE IT ALL THE TIME 
BUT IT'S ALL THEIR IF YOU NEED TO 
LIKE A HIDDEN PANEL 
HMM 
AND THAT'LL BE BETTER FOR THE OLDER GENERATION AS WELL 'CAUSE WELL MY DAD DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE GOT IT KINDA FLICK THROUGH A MENU 
BUT UH CAN PRETTY MUCH READ A BUTTON IF IT'S DISPLAYED PROPERLY 
YEAH 
AND THE VOLUME 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK THEY'RE HANDY 
I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY LIKE UM 
NOT AN ISSUE TO RAISE HERE BUT UM THE WHOLE THING BUT NOT USING YOUR STANDBY UH BECAUSE OF THE LIKE WASTE OF ELECTRICITY 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE ADVERTS 
LIKE IF YOU BOIL THE KETTLE THAT'S FULL THAT'S A WASTE 
IF YOU LEAVE YOUR TELLY ON STANDBY IT POWERS BLACKPOOL FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME 
LIKE WE SHOULD MAYBE TRY TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM STANDBY 
YEAH IT'S MAYBE TOO MUCH OF A BIG ISSUE FOR HERE 
OH OH DANGER SIGN 
YEAH BUT A LITTLE BIT SMALLER 
COMPROMISE 
RIGHT 
NO MUTE 
SO 
AND THEN 
MM-HMM 
UH THERE'S AUDIO FUNCTIONS 
YEAH 
I THINK THEY NORMALLY DO 
YEAH 
SO I THINK UM 
THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF LIKE DOLBY SURROUND STUDIO SURROUND SORT OF THINGS 
UM MAYBE FOR THE YOUNGER MARKET 
UM I THINK THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN CONTROLS IN THIS KIND OF LIKE HIDDEN PANEL 
OH NO I MEAN UM LIKE THERE'S KIND OF INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS FOR THEM LIKE IN THE T. V. REMOTE 
BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FOR I'VE NEVER USED THEM 
I JUST KNOW THEY'RE SOMETHING TO DO WITH DOLBY 
RIGHT UH 
SO UM 
SO WHERE'S THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION 
SORRY 
MICROSOFT POWERPOINT RIGHT 
RIGHT OKAY 
SO 
RIGHT 
OKAY SO WE'VE GOT UH 
SO WE'VE GOT NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 
UM 
SO BASICALLY WE'VE GOT THREE THINGS AND WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES IN WHICH TO UH FOR THIS MEETING TO UH TO DISCUSS THE VARIOUS OPTIONS 
UM 
THREE PRESENTATIONS 
I SEE RIGHT 
THAT'S NICE TO KNOW ON FROM EACH OF YOU 
UM NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 
UM SO DO WE WANT TO DO THE PRESENTATION FIRST OR DO WE WANT TO ME 
W I I GOT UM OR OR THREE THINGS BASICALLY UM RELATING TO THE REMOTE BEING ONLY FOR T. V. 
WE DISCUSSED THAT LAST TIME AND AN ACTUAL FACT THAT WAS PR PRETTY WELL WHAT WE COME UP WITH ANYWAY 
SO IN FACT IT ACTUALLY IF WE WON'T BE FORESTALLED IN A SENSE 
UM WE'VE GOT UH TELETEXT OUTDATED 
UM DID YOU GET ANY INFORMATION ON THAT 
RIGHT AND THE CORPORATE IMAGE WAS THE UH FINAL THING 
SO I I GET THAT AN EMAIL FROM 
UM 
RIGHT OKAY 
SO 
I GUESS IF WE GO AHEAD WITH THE UH WITH THE THREE PRESENTATIONS 
SO WE'LL START WITH YOURSELF ON THE BASIS THAT UH 
SORRY YEP 
OH 
IT GOING 
OKAY 
UH THERE'S THE RUBBER ON THE RIGHT I THINK 
IT'S MAGIC 
SO THE THE TOP BIT'S THE POWER SOURCE YES 
SO THE BATTERY IS THE ON THE SENDER 
OKAY 
SO NOW MORE DESIGN 
THAT'S WHAT WE LOOK AT HERE 
SO TO CONTROL FUNCTION EI OH THE OTHER YOU GO 
WELL THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THERE 
UM WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN UM LOGO AND COLOUR SCHEME 
SO BASICALLY WE'D HAVE TO UH WE'D HAVE TO BE PUTTING THAT ONE UM THE THE PRODUCT 
I HAVEN'T AS YET NO 
BUT UH I GOT UH I GOT AN EMAIL THAT BASICALLY USED TO UH MAKE SURE THAT UH WHATEVER DEVICE WE COME UP WITH AT THE END OF THE DAY HAD TO INCORPORATE UM THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN 
SO UH I'M GUESSING THAT UH UH I NOTICE ON THE BOTTOM THERE IT'S GOT UH 
WHAT'S THAT 
I. P. O. G. I. E. THAT MIGHT BE THE CORPORATE COLOUR SCHEME ALTHOUGH THE ONLY THE ONLY COLOUR I CAN SEE IN THAT IS THE RED 
WILL BE UH W 
WELL THE THE ON THE WELL UH FOR FOR GENERAL TELEVISION PURPOSES OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE CHANNELS ON TO FIVE TO THIS POINT IN TIME 
AND WE'D HAVE TO HAVE SOME ROOM FOR UH FUTURE SUCH CHANNELS 
BUT BUT 
BUT WELL POSSIBLY BUT THE THE OTHER THING IS THAT WITH UM THE CURRENT EXPANSION OF UH CHANNELS UH IN THE PROCESS OF TAKING PLACE 
CERTAINLY THE BUTTON UP AND DOWN BUT UH I MEAN HOW MANY CHANNELS DO WE HAVE TO UM ACTUAL TELEVISION CHANNELS DO WE HAVE TO UH PREPARE FOR 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT UH 
IT'S FOREVER EXPANDING AND AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT ALTHOUGH YOU'VE ONL YOU'VE GOT THE FIVE STANDARD 
YOU'VE GOT THE B. B. C. HAVE COME UP WITH A FURTHER SIX AND UH THERE'S UH I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY CHANNELS THERE ARE IN UH WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT UH SKY AND VARIOUS OTHER UM VARIOUS OTHERS 
SO I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULDN'T YOU KNOW RATHER OKAY 
OF THE TIME OF FLICKING FROM ONE OUT THERE BUT PRESUMABLY IT'LL TAKE A SECOND 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STOP IT 
MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE A FAST FORWARD ON THE ON THE CHANNELS THAT WE AND THEN YOU COULD DISPENSE WITH MORE OTHERWISE 
Y YOU'D WANT YOU'D WANT TO GET FAIRLY QUICKLY TO THE CHANNEL THAT YOU WANTED 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I SEE I SUPPOSE IN A SENSE YOU COULD HAVE UM IF YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED CHANNELS THEN IF YOU HAD SORT OF AN EASY WAY OF GETTING RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO ON IT A HUNDRED 
YOU COULD GO ON IT ON TO TEN 
TEN TO TWENTY AND THEN HAVE A SECOND BUTTON TO GET YOU TO THE ACTUAL CHANNEL YOU WANT AND THAT WOULD CUT DOWN YOUR TIME 
ANYWAY 
WHATEVER 
OKAY 
OKAY 
LIMIT THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS USER FRIENDLY 
YEAH 
WELL THAT'S TRUE YEAH YOU COULD GET FIFTY BY FIVE AND A ZERO OR WHATEVER THAT THAT MAKES SENSE 
YEAH 
DOES 
SO WE SEE WHAT WAS THE CIRCULAR THING THAT YOU WERE 
IF IT'S JUST FOR T. V. WHICH IS WHAT IT IS TO THE MOMENT 
MM-HMM 
WELL WE'VE WE'VE GOT UM THAT IT'S REMOTE FOR T. V. ONLY OTHERWISE PROJECT WOULD BECOME TOO COMPLEX WITH UH WHICH WOULD ENDANGER THE TIME TO MARKET WAS ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS 
I'M I DON'T KNOW D DID YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION BEHIND THE MARKETING OR WAS I MEANT TO GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION 
RIGHT 
RIGHT OKAY SO BASICALLY TIME TO MARKET SEEMS TO BE IMPORTANT THEREFORE SPEED OF DELIVERY 
WE'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT ANOTHER FOUR HOURS LEFT 
YEAH I THINK SHE SAID TWENTY SECONDS TO ME 
WHAT WAS THAT LAST W BUT THERE 
SPEECH RECOGNITION RIGHT OKAY 
BUT THAT WAS ONLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT PREFERRED IT OLDER PEOPLE DIDN'T 
WELL THAT'S RIGHT 
SOUNDS REASONABLE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO 
WELL IF YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID HAVING A SECOND PRODUCT 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU COULD HAVE A SECOND PRODUCT THAT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT PITCH WHICH WOULD SET THE REMOTE OFF TO SAY HERE I AM SORT OF THING 
YOU KNOW WITHOUT SOUND RECOGNITION 
BUT IF YOU 
I KNOW 
UM I WAS GONNA SAY A SHARP NOISE YOU KNOW A CLAPPING OF HAND OR WHATEVER 
YOU'D WANT TO TRY AND AV JUST HAVE THE ONE PRODUCT THAT IF 
YEAH 
UM I DUNNO UM TALKING ABOUT VO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'VE GOT VOICE RECOGNITION THEN YOU CAN DO IT IN THAT WAY BECAUSE IT'LL RECOGNISE THE VOICE AND YOU CAN GIVE IT A COMMAND 
A SET COMMAND WHATEVER THAT HAPPENED TO BE 
BUT YOU'VE THEN GET THE POINT IF IF YOU'RE NOT GOING WITH UH VOICE RECOGNITION THEN 
MM 
SO UH ANY SUGGES WELL ANY CONCLUSIONS 
WELL IF IT DOES THEN WE CAN'T 
IT'S THAT SIMPLE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT UH THE THE OTHER UM PRIMARY UM UH REQUISITES FROM UH 
FROM AND EMAIL UH THAT WAS SENT TO ME WHEREBY WE HAD THE DESIGN LOGO WAS IN WHICH WE'VE ALREADY MENTIONED 
WE'VE GOT UM THE REMOTE WAS ONLY FOR THE TELEVISION AND NOT FOR BECAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE IT TOO COMPLEX AND WE HAVE TO GET TO MARKET QUICKLY 
AND THE UH THIRD THING WAS THAT UM TELETEXT UH AS FAR AS UH THE MANAGEMENT IS CONCERNED 
UM IS BECOMING DATED UH DUE TO THE POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET 
SO THAT MEANS THAT UH SO THESE ARE THE SORT OF OTHER UM EXTRA PARAMETERS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN THIS UH PROJECT 
SO WE'RE BEING FOCUSED EFFECTIVELY DIRECTLY TO A TELEVISION AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MANAGEMENT IS UH WANTING US TO GO DOWN A NARROW PATH AND NOT OPENING OUT 
SO ANYTHING THAT UH IS TO BE ADDED 
SUCH AS VOICE RECOGNITION ET CETERA HAS TO BE VERY SIMPLE AND HAS TO BE VERY QUICK BECAUSE TIME TO MARKET IS IS CRITICAL 
SO 
IT WOULD 
BUT PROBABLY QUICK AND SIMPLE IS PRIMARY RATHER THAN 
ADDED EXTRAS 
ADDED EXTRAS WOULD BE NICE BUT THE PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IS TO GET THE PROJECT FINISHED WITHIN UH THIS SHORT TIME WINDOW 
WHICH EFFECTIVELY NOW IS SORT OF FOUR HOURS 
SO AND IF AND WE'VE GOTTA GET TO THE END 
UH D D I THINK I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'VE GOTTA GET TO THE END AND THEN GET TO THE END WITH UM ADDED EXTRAS IF POSSIBLE 
OKAY 
RIGHT OKAY UH SO I NEED TO 
RIGHT 
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE HAVE LEFT OF OUR UH TIME 
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS ON UH THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS 
AND HOW WE WERE PLANNING TO PROCEED SO THAT AT THE NEXT UH MEETING 
EACH PERSON THAT'S GOT A A A TASK TO DO IS CLEAR FROM THIS MEETING WHAT THAT TASK IS 
WE'LL ALSO KNOW W WHEN THE NEXT MEETING SO I UM SO WE'LL KNOW HOW LONG WE'VE GOT TO COMPLETE THAT TASK 
AND THEN WE CAN REPORT BACK TO THE NEXT MEETING AND SAY RIGHT OKAY YES 
WE'VE ACHIEVED THESE ARE WE HAVEN'T ACHIEVED THIS THIS IS HOW FAR WE'VE PROGRESSED 
DOES THAT MAKE REASONABLE SENSE 
SO WE HAVE TO COME EFFECTIVELY AT THE DECISION ON THE REMOTE FUNCTIONS SO THAT YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING 
AND IF DUR BETWEEN THE TIME OF THIS MEETING FINISHING AND THE NEXT MEETING STARTING 
IF YOU GET ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT UH ONLY YOU HAVE TO THAT POINT IN TIME YOU'D THINK WOULD BE RELEVANT TO OTHER PEOPLE IN TERMS OF THEIR DES DECISION MAKING UM PROCESS 
THEN WE SHOULD COMMUNICATE THAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING 
DO IT VIA THE EMAIL SO THAT RATHER THAN COMING YOU KNOW IF YOU GET THE INFORMATION JUST BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING THAT'S FINE 
COME ALONG WITH IT IN THE NEXT MEETING WE CAN DISCUSS IT THEN AND TAKE WHATEVER ACTION IS APPROPRIATE 
BUT IF YOU GET IT WILL BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING 
LET EVERYBODY ELSE KNOW 'CAUSE THAT MIGHT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR UH ON WHAT THEY COME UP WITH EFFECTIVELY AT THE NEXT MEETING 
OKAY 
RIGHT SO THERE 
I WOULD GUESS SO 
YEP 
I W WELL UH I 
SOMETHING SIMPLE 
UH OF OF OUR PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IS TO GET OUT THERE IN TIME TIME'S SHORT 
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO MEET THE MAJOR CONCERNS OF THE CONSUMER SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT IS A SELLING POINT FOR THE PRODUCT SOMETHING THAT'S QUICK AND SIMPLE 
SO SOUNDS GOOD 
WELL SO MAYBE A CLAP RATHER THAN A WHISTLE WOULD BE IN THE BASIS THAT IF WE'VE GOT IF WE'RE CATERING TO THE WHOLE AGE RANGE 
YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S EASY TO DO NOW SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T LIKE WHIS UH WELL I I I DON'T KNOW 
WELL IF YOU THINK THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN WHISTLE THAN CLAP THEN THAT'S FINE THEN GO FOR THAT OPTION 
BUT IF I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD CLAP RATHER THAN WHISTLE SO UH SO CLAP OPTION 
OKAY 
OH 
EF EFFECTIVELY THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING THAT UH OF UH IF PEOPLE ARE NOW USING THE INTERNET THEN YOU DON'T NEED TELETEXT 
SO SO TAKE OUT TELETEXT 
YEAH 
NO 
BUT TH BUT THAT'S RELYING ON THE TELEVISION MARKET CHANGING IT AN AUTOMATIC AND IF IT IS TO THE MOMENT THAT'S FINE 
BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DEVICE THAT CATERS 
'CAUSE OTHERWISE IT WOULD MAKE IT UH YOUR DEVICE WOULD BECOME INOPERABLE 
OR ONLY OPERABLE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE IDEA IS TO HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET WHICH IS AND IT'S ALSO UM IT'S THE THE PRODUCT WE'VE GOT IS SOMETHING THAT'S IT TH I WOULD HAVE SAID THE LOWER END OF THE EASE OF THE COST SCALE 
SO WE'RE NOT REALLY GOING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S UH 
TERRIBLY HIGH TECH 
POSSIBLY 
THAT'S RIGHT 
OKAY WELL 
MM 
SO YOU UH THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA 
SO YOU KEEP UM RIGHT WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE WE WIND UP THIS MEETING SO I'VE BEEN TOLD 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT THE SAME 
OKAY 
SO SO KEEP UM KEEP DETAILED FUNCTIONS UM HIDDEN AT THE BACK 
OH 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S RIGHT 
DATA FUNCTIONS HIDDEN IT BACK 
CAN BRING IT WHEN NEEDED 
THAT'S RIGHT SO WE'RE DIS SO YOU'VE GOT WHICH ONES ARE GONNA BE IN THE FRONT AND WHICH ONES ARE GONNA BE IN THE BACK 
WE HAVE TO DECIDE 
I GUESS SO 
SO IN FRONT 
NUMBERS 
VOLUME 
SORRY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
SO SO ARE YOU HAVING THE STAND BY IN THE FRONT THEN 
WELL 
CHANNEL UP AND DOWN 
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT 
WHAT WAS THAT SIXTEEN 
VOLUME BUTTON 
HOW MANY VOLUMES 
RIGHT OKAY 
POWER BUTTON STAND BY CHANNEL UP AND DOWN 
SO SO THAT IT 
OKAY 
THAT'S SIXTEEN BUTTONS YOU RECKON 
AND THEN AT THE BACK 
OKAY 
SO ON THE BACK 
IT'LL HAVE BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST ANYTHING ELSE 
YOU'RE ALSO GONNA HAVE THE CHANNEL TUNER AS IT WERE 
TUNER WOULD THAT HAVE UP AND DOWN 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM UP VOLUME YEAH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL YOU MIGHT GET SOME RESEARCH 
OKAY 
RIGHT SO I'LL DO THE MINUTES OF UH THIS MEETING 
AND WE'LL MEET BACK TO I'M NOT SURE 
UM FORTY MINUTES I BELIEVE IS THE TIME 
COME ON 
WE HAVE A I GUESS WE HAVE A PRESENTATION EACH 'CAUSE I'VE GOT NO 
UM 
MM-HMM 
UH WE DIDN'T NO 
I D I DIDN'T PERSONALLY 
OKAY THAT'S FINE 
I'LL JUST UM I'LL GRAB THE WERE TO THE BACK OF THIS ONE 
I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW IT 
CONTROL 
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE QUITE WORKING AT THE MOMENT 
ALT FUNCTION F. EIGHT 
AGAIN NOT DOING ANYTHING 
OH 
PRESSED ABOUT FIVE TIMES NOW 
OKAY THAT'S ME 
OKAY UM I HAVE TO GO AGAIN 
HOPEFULLY THAT SHOULD BE AT THIS TIME 
OKAY I THINK WE'RE THERE 
THAT'S GOOD 
OKAY UM 
OKAY I'M GONNA BE LOOKING AT THE WORKING DESIGN 
UM OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM I'VE JUST GOT THREE SECTIONS FIRST IS THE RESEARCH I MADE IN THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF UM 
AND THEN THAT INVOLVES THE COMPONENTS REQUIRED IN IT AND THE SYSTEMS UH DESIGN OF THE ACTUAL THE ACTUAL REMOTE 
UM SO HAVING RESEARCHED THE EXISTING MODELS WITHIN THE MARKET UM I FIND MY RESEARCH OFF THE INTERNET 
UM I'VE ESTABLISHED WHAT THE COMPONENTS REQUIRED FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO FUNCTION ACTUALLY OR 
AND THEN ALSO THE METHODS IN WHICH THOSE COMPONENTS INTERACT TOGETHER FOR THE REMOTE TO ACTUALLY DO WHAT YOU WANT TO TO DO AND HOW IT CONNECTS WITH THE TELEVISION 
UM THE BASIC COMPONENTS ARE AN ENERGY SOURCE WHICH I GUESS UM IN MOST EXISTING MODELS WOULD BE A BATTERY SUPPLY 
WHETHER THAT'LL BE SORT OF TWO BATTERIES FOR BATTERIES UM IT MAY VARY 
WE THEN HAVE THE USER INTERFACE WHICH IS BASICALLY THE LIKE THE THE BUTTONS ON THE ACTUAL REMOTE 
UM THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS USED FOR CHANGING CHANNEL UH CHANNEL UP AND DOWN VOLUME THINGS LIKE THAT 
UM THERE'S ALSO A CHIP INSIDE THE REMOTE WHICH DOES ALL THE COMPUTER TYPE THINGS 
AND THEN THE SENDER WHICH UM 
IS USUALLY I'VE FOUND AN INFRA RED DEVICE WHICH SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE ACTUAL TELEVISION 
UM AND THE LAST PART IS RECEIVER WHICH IS IMPORTANT IN THE SYSTEM BUT IS NOT ACTUALLY PART OF THE REMOTE ITSELF BECAUSE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY FOUND IN THE TELEVISION 
UM I'M GONNA HAVE TO ACTUALLY DRAW ON THE BOARD BECAUSE UH IT WAS A LITTLE TRICKY ON POWERPOINT TO GET THIS WORKING SO 
I'LL JUST GO THROUGH THERE 
SO UM UM DO WE HAVE A CLOTH TO WIPE THIS DOWN WITH OUR 
UH I'LL J 
UH I SEE 
OH OKAY 
I'LL GET RID OF THE BEAR 
OKAY THAT'S GREAT 
OKAY SO WE START OFF WITH A M BATTERY SUPPL UH IN A POWER SUPPLY WHICH WE'D PROBABLY GET IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE THE BATTERY 
UM 
WE THEN HAVE 
A PARTICULAR BUTTON WHICH MAY BE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THERE'S LOTS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS 
UM BUT THIS IS HOW THE BASIC SYSTEM WORKS 
UM THAT SENDS AFTER YOU PRESS THAT THAT SENDS THE MESSAGE TO 
THE CHIP WHICH UM THEN SENDS 
IT SORT OF INTERPRETS WHICH BUTTON YOU'VE PRESSED AND THEN SENDS THE APPROPRIATE MESSAGE TO THE SENDER 
UM 
SO THAT'S 
THAT'S THE REMOTE IN ITSELF THAT'S THE COMPONENTS OF THE REMOTE AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER 
SO THIS IS THE UH USER 
INTERFACE 
UM THIS IS THE CHIP ITSELF WHICH THEN AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE INFRA RED 
SENDER 
AND THEN ON THE SEPARATE THING WE HAVE ON THE 
IN THE TELEVISION 
WE HAVE A 
A RECEIVER 
AND THE SENDER SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE RECEIVER 
'KAY 
OH YES THAT'S THE POWER SOURCE 
UM 
GOING ON IT PERSONAL PREFERENCES I'VE SAID THAT BATTERY SEEMS THE BEST OPTION FOR THE ACTUAL REMOTE JUST BECAUSE OF THE SIZE 
YOU DON'T WANT A A CABLE ATTACHED TO THE REMOTE OTHERWISE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT REALLY A REMOTE 
UM AND THEN THE SENDER AND INFRA RED UM HAS BEEN USED QUITE SUCCESSFULLY 
OF THE BATTERY'S ON REASONABLE POWER THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO WORK FAIRLY WELL 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE POINT DIRECTLY AT THE TELEVISION ITSELF 
UM 
YES 
'KAY AND THAT'S IT FOR THE MOMENT 
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO GET RID OF THE THE EXTRA BUTTONS HERE 
THE THE SORT OF CIRCULAR SECTION BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE FOR A VIDEO AS WELL 
SO WE COULD DISPENSE WITH THAT LITTLE BIT AS WELL AND JUST GET IT DOWN TO JUST THE NUMBERS AND THE VOLUME 
POSSIBLY 
JU YEAH YEAH YEAH J YEAH JUST THIS LITTLE BIT IS THAT I THINK THAT'S STILL UM A VIDEO REMOTE PART 
SO MAYBE WE COULD GET RID OF THAT AS WELL 
IT'S JUST PEOPLE ARE USED TO USING THAT SO IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THEM THEN THEY MIGHT THINK IT'S 
HMM 
OKAY YEAH 
I SUPPOSE WITH NINE YOU'VE GOT THE THE LIKE THE LAST ONE WHICH MAKES THE TENTH MEANS YOU UH IT'S LIKE UH MULTIPLES YOU CAN PUT THEM TOGETHER SO YOU CAN MAKE ANY NUMBER 
SO WITH THAT WE'D KIND OF BY PASS ANY PROBLEMS WITH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
'CAUSE THAT FACILITATES HAVING ALL THE NUMBERS YOU COULD EVER NEED 
UM 
SO WE COULD GET IT DOWN TO WHAT 
SO WE GET OUT HOW MANY BUTTONS HAVE WE GOT 
WE'VE JUST GOT TEN ELEVEN TWELVE TH WE GOT FOURTEEN THAT WE NEED 
I GUESS 
UM WHICH ISN'T REALLY TOO MANY 
THAT'LL BE QUITE EASY TO MAKE A USER GUIDE FOR A FOURTEEN BUTTON REMOTE 
'KAY 
'KAY 
OH YES YES THAT SEEMS GOOD 
I THINK IF YOU JUST GIVE IT A SECOND TO MAYBE CATCH UP 
I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE BY THE END OF TODAY 
MM 
NO WHAT I MAYBE THINK SO UM 
IT SEEMS THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE QUITE ADVANCED FOR THAT AND THEY MIGHT END UP COSTING MORE THAN OUR TWELVE FIFTY BUDGET FOR 
FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
UM 
AND POSSIBLY THE THING ABOUT THE ABOUT THE REMOTE BEING LOST WE COULD HAVE YOU KNOW WITH YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU ALSO THAT AND YOU CAN RING IT 
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOME KIND OF SENSOR WHICH IS KEPT SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN SOME KIND OF BUZZER SYSTEM BETWEEN THE TWO 
SO YOU CAN PRESS A BUTTON WHICH IS ALWAYS KEPT IN ONE PLACE AND THEN IT MAYBE BUZZES TO SOMEWHERE ELSE WHEREVER THE REMOTE ACTUALLY SO 
THAT IS TRUE YES 
HMM 
SO I GUESS IT'D BE SOMETHING WE COULD LIKE ATTACH TO THE OR LIKE THE SAME TECHNOLOGY COULD BE PUT INSIDE THE 
INSIDE THE REMOTE 
YEAH 
YEAH IF WE IF WE COULD HAVE IT IN THE ACTUAL REMOTE LIKE EVERYTHING IN IN ONE DEVICE 
YOU COULD HAVE AN OPTION TO TURN IT OFF 
OR 
PERHAPS UM 
SO THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE T. V. KIND OF SPEAKING AT THE REMOTE AND CHANGING ITS OWN CHANNELS 
MM 
'KAY 
YES 
HAS TO BE SIMPLE ENOUGH TO 
I SUPPOSE IF WE COULD GET SOMETHING IN WHICH WAS QUITE QUICK AND SIMPLE THAT WOULD GIVE US AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHER REMOTES 
UM 
'KAY 
MM-HMM 
YES 
UM 
YES THAT SEEMS RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE JUST IN THE WHISTLE BACK FUNCTION TO THE MOMENT AND IF SOMETHING COMES BACK 
I'D GO MORE YEAH OF MORE FOR CELP 
DID WE DECIDE ON HAVING THE TEN UM THE TEN NUMBERS AND THEN THE THE LITTLE DIGIT NEXT TO TO WHICH KIND OF ENABLED YOU TO PUT THEM TOGETHER 
OKAY TEN NUMBERS AND THEN SOME KIND OF DEVICE TO ALLOW UH 
I'LL PUT DELAY TO ALLOW UM MULTIPLE NUMBERS 
OR MULTIPLE DIGITS 
DID WE DECIDE ANYTHING ABOUT UM THE OTHER FUNCTIONS 
SO ON SETTING THE AUDIO AND TUNING IT AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
YOU HAD AN HAD AN IDEA ABOUT THE MENU 
BUT JUST THINKING UM PEOPLE PROBABLY I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE YOU ONLY HAVE TO PROBABLY TUNE IN THE T. V. ONCE 
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TUNE IT THAT ONCE 
SO AND IF FINALLY THE T. V. BREAKS YOU GOT A NEW ONE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TUNE IT 
YOU CAN'T REALLY AVOID THAT 
EXCEPT THE NEW DIGITAL MARKETS WHICH DO IT BY THEMSELVES 
SO THAT'LL BE ONE 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
SO HOW WOULD THIS MENU FUNCTION WORK 
WOULD YOU MAYBE HAVE LIKE AN MENU BUTTON THEN YOU'D USE THE OTHER BUTTONS MAYBE THE NUMBER BUTTONS TO ACTUALLY DO THE SEPARATE FUNCTIONS 
OKAY 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE THE INDIVIDUAL NUMBERS AND THEN A MENU FUNCTION AND MAYBE SORT OF A SLIGHTLY MORE ADVANCED UM INSTRUCTION BOOKLET TO COME WITH IT 
TO GUIDE PRESU UH I THINK IT'D BE QUITE HARD JUST FOR PEOPLE TO GRASP UM JUST OFF LIKE THE MAIN IS DIFFERENT BUTTONS YOU MAYBE HAVE TO HAVE LIKE SOME BETTER INSTRUCTIONS OF HOW THAT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK 
RIGHT OKAY UM 
THAT ALSO GOES BACK TO THE ORIGINAL DESIGN WHEN WE SAW THOSE TWO 
AND THERE WAS THE IN IN THE LEFT HAND SIDE WHICH HAD ALL LIKE THE DOUBLE FUNCTIONS AND STUFF WHICH KIND OF LOOKED TOO BUSY AND HAD TOO MUCH ON IT 
SO 
THAT IS THAT IS A GOOD IDEA ACTUALLY 
SOR SORT OF A SECOND 
OKAY 
UH NOT QUITE BUT I GUESS 
KEEP THE OTHER BUTTONS BUT HIDE THEM AWAY 
SO 
SO UM WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE TO WORK OUT WHAT'S GONNA BE IN THESE OTHER FUNCTIONS AS AS WELL 
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE TWO SEPARATE TWO SEPARATE LISTS I GUESS 
SO SH 
SHOULD WE DECIDE ON THE NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN 
SO ON THE 
BUT THE NUMBER 
UM THE VOLUME UP AND DOWN 
SHALL WE HAVE A MUTE BUTTON AS WELL 
A MUTE BUTTON AS WELL 
YEAH 
OR 
BUT THEN THEY MIGHT NOT BUY IT IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT NO 
'CAUSE PEOPLE MIGHT JUST BE TOO FICKLE AND NOT WANT TO CHANGE 
WE CAN SEND IT A FLIER WITH THE DEVICE SAYING THAT YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE IT ON STAND BY 
I THINK YOU PROBABLY SHOULD 
UM ARE WE GONNA HAVE THE CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AS WELL AS THE NUMBER BUTTONS 
OKAY SO WE'LL HAVE UM 
SO WE'VE GOT TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THERE 
SO THERE ANYTHING ELSE 
UM 
MAYBE IF WE'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF TIME 
ONE OF US SHOULD COME UP WITH A LIST OF THIS AND THEN GET BACK TO THE NEXT MEETING JUST TO THE START AND SAY WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BE 
SO TUNER UP AND DOWN I GUESS 
UM UP TUNE ONE WAY TUNE THE O I I DUNNO I DUNNO POSSIBLY 
OH YEAH AND THE AND A ENTER BUTTON JUST TO SELECT 
YEAH OKAY 
UM I GUESS WE'RE KEEPING IS IT SIMPLE 
WE DON'T REALLY NEED ANY OTHER AUDIO FUNCT UH FUNCTIONS BECAUSE IT'S JUST VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN 
UM 
DO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CONTROLS IN THEIR ACTUAL PRODUCTS THAN OR DO YOU HAVE TO DO IT VIA THE REMOTE 
YEAH I SUPPOSE IF WE'VE GOT THERE IF THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN CONTROLS THEN WE CAN AVOID IT FOR OURS JUST TO KEEP IT SIMPLE 
OH OKAY 
RIGHT 
UM 
MAYBE UNLESS SOMETHING COMES UP THEN WE SHOULD I THINK 
WELL SHALL WE LOOK INTO THAT AND JUST GET BACK TOGETHER 
'KAY 
YEAH I'VE GOT ON IT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
THERE'S USUALLY A LITTLE THING IN THE TOP RIGHT FOR THE UH HANG ON IT'S JUST COMING IN 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM 
I'M NOT SURE 
I HAD I'VE HAD SOME MARKET INFORMATION BUT NOT FROM THE COMPANY NO 
OKAY 
'KAY 
I'M GONNA PULL THIS OFF 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER GO 
YEAH THERE WE GO 
RIGHT WE'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH INTO THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT PEOPLE WANT OUT OF THEIR REMOTE CONTROL 
AND FIRST OFF WE SHOULD STATE THAT THE THE REMOTE CONTROL'S FOR CONTROLLING THE T. V. 
AND UM HOW DO PEOPLE USE IT 
WE ASKED THEM SORT OF WHICH BUTTONS WERE USEFUL FOR THEM 
UM HOW DO HOW DOES A REMOTE CONTROL LOOK AND FEEL FOR THEM AND WHAT IMPROVEMENTS WOULD WOULD THEY LOOK AT REMOTE CONTROL 
AND WE DID THAT BY SORT OF GIVING THEM A QUESTIONNAIRE THAT WE'D PREPARED AND ASKING THEM TO FILL IN THE ANSWERS 
AND THREE QUARTERS OF THEM FOUND THAT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE UGLY AND THAT A SORT OF EVEN HIGHER PROPORTION WOULD SPEND MORE FOR A SORT OF USE UH A FANCIER REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THAT OF ALL THE BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
THE SORT OF SETTING BUTTONS FOR SORT OF THE PICTURE PICTURE AND BRIGHTNESS AND THE AUDIO SETTINGS UM THEY WEREN'T USED VERY OFTEN AT ALL 
PEOPLE CONCENTRATED ON THE CHANNEL BUTTONS AND THE VOLUME BUTTONS AND THE POWER BUTTONS 
UH WE ALSO ASKED THEM ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION UH FOR REMOTE CONTROL 
AND YOUNG PEOPLE WERE QUITE RECEPTIVE TO THIS 
BUT AS SOON AS WE GOT SORT OF OVER BUT NOT A THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY AGE FORTY FIVE AGE GROUP AND OLDER 
PEOPLE PEOPLE WEREN'T QUITE SO KEEN ON SPEECH RECOGNITION 
THERE'S A LOT MORE TH THERE'S A LOT LOT MORE OLDER PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THEY WANTED TO OR NOT AS WELL 
UM WE ALSO ASKED WHAT FRUSTRATED PEOPLE ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS AND THE NUMBER ONE FRUSTRATION WAS THAT THE REMOTE WAS LOST SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE ROOM AND THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND OUT 
AND THE SECOND SECOND BIGGEST FRUSTRATION WHAT THAT IF THEY GOT A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO LEARN UM ALL THE BUTTONS AND ALL THE FUNCTIONS AND TO FIND YOUR WAY AROUND IT 
OKAY SO 
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES FROM THE MARKETING IS THAT WE NEED TO COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF SLEEK SORT OF GOOD LOOKING HIGH HIGH TECH A DESIGN WHICH LOOKS HIGH TECH 
BASICALLY 
UM AND THAT WE SHOULD COME UP WITH FEWER BUTTONS THAN MOST OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MARKET 
AND WE SHOULD SORT OF CONCENTRATE ON THE CHANNELS AND SORT OF POWER AND ALSO VOLUME AND THAT SORT OF THING IS IS ALSO SAID 
UM WE COULD MAYBE COME UP WITH A MENU A SORT OF A AN L. C. D. MENU FOR OTHER FUNCTIONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT 
UM AND MAYBE WE COULD THINK ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION AS WELL BECAUSE UM SORT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
PERHAPS THE ONES THAT ARE GONNA BUY BUY OUR NEW PRODUCT IF WE AIM AT IT SORT OF YOU KNOW SORT OF A HIGH TECH DESIGN 
THAT THAT MIGHT BE THE MARKET THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
AND WE COULD MAYBE THINK ABOUT USING SPEECH RECOGNITI RECOGNITION IS A WAY TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL IF IT'S LOST IN A ROOM 
RATHER THAN SORT OF UM HAVING TO TO SPEECH RECOGNITION TO CHANGE THE CHANNELS 
'CAUSE THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THAT IN THAT THE TELEVISION MAKES NOISE IS IT COULD END UP TALKING TO ITSELF AND CHANGING ITS CHANNEL 
OKAY UM AND THAT'S THE END OF THE SLIDE SHOW 
THAT'S IT 
COOL 
UM ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION 
YEAH 
YOUN YOUNG PEOPLE PREF YEAH 
THEY S THEY SAID THAT THEY'D BE INTERESTED IN A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH OFFERED THAT POSSIBILITY AND SO YOU GO UP THROUGH THE AGE GROUPS 
PEOPLE GET LESS AND LESS INTERESTED IN SORT OF A A REMOTE CONTROL THAT YOU COULD TALK TO USE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH WE'D HAVE TO THAT WOULD MEAN WE'D HAVE TO PUT TWO PRODUCTS TOGETHER AS WELL WHICH WHICH AGAIN WOULD PROBABLY BE A BIT EXPENSIVE BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UM WOULD TO TAKE QUITE A WHILE TO SORT OF DEVELOP THE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
CONSIDERING 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO 
BUT FIVE MINUTES 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEP 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO DO WE NEED TO DECIDE ON THE FUNCTIONS NOW 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AND 
YEAH AND THAT WAS THAT WAS THE NUMBER ONE SORT OF FRUSTRATION THAT PEOPLE SAID SO 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE IN THE MARKET THAT DOES THAT IS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO NOT EVERYONE CAN WHISTLE CAN THEY THOUGH 
NO CLAPPING I THINK CLAPPING YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TAKING OUT TELETEXT OKAY 
MM 
I THINK NOWADAYS YOU CAN JUST GET ONES WHERE IT GIVES YOU A SORT OF A SECOND OR TWO TO PRESS ANOTHER NUMBER 
SO YOU CAN PRESS ANY TWO AND IT'LL SORT OF PUT THEM TOGETHER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH WE COULD POSSIBLY PUT AN L. A SORT OF A L. C. D. MENU ON ABOUT THAT AGAIN IS PROBABLY AN EXPENSE THAT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I SEE I SUPPOSE UM 
IF PEOPLE ARE BUYING REMOTES THEN THEY'RE PROBABLY BUYING IT TO REPLACE ANOTHER REMOTE 'CAUSE ALL MOST TELLIES COME WITH REMOTES SO 
I MEAN WE'RE MAYBE TALKING ABOUT REPLACING REMOTES FOR SLIGHTLY OLDER TELEVISIONS SO WE MAYBE NEED TO KEEP THE THE TUNING FUNCTION IN 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
OH 
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THE SORT OF HAVING PEOPLE HAVE A BOOKLET 'CAUSE IN THE SECOND MOST ANNOYING THING THAT PEOPLE FOUND WAS HAVING TO LEARN THE NEW ONE 
SO MAYBE NEXT TO EACH OF THE BUTTONS 
YOU KNOW EACH OF THEM COULD HAVE A NUMBER AND THEN ALSO A FUNCTION WRITTEN NEXT TO IT IS YOU'RE BASICALLY PRESSING 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THE THE 
THE DETAILED ONES WOULD BE SORT OF BRIGHTNESS UH SORT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
AND PROBABLY A POWER ON AS WELL 
DUNNO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM 'CAUSE YEAH THE MARKET RESEARCH SAID THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO JUST ZAP AROUND AND FLICK SO 
UM 
NUMBERS IS TEN VOLUME IS 
TWELVE TH YEAH SO ONE UP ONE DOWN 
AND A MUTE YEAH 
THAT'S SIXTEEN ISN'T IT YEAH 
I DON'T THINK SO NO 
YOU'VE GOT 
BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THEN MAYBE SORT OF AN ENTER BUTTON FOR 
SORT OF SO YOU KNOW SAYING THAT YOU WANT THAT PARTICULAR THING TUNED IN 
SO YOU GO UP AND DOWN AND THEN TO PICK IT FINDS SOMETHING AND THEN YOU WANNA PRESS ENTER TO SELECT IT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
THANKS 
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY A BETTER ONE TO DISCUSS IT STRAIGHT AWAY 
UM I HAVE A LOT OF THE INFORMATION THERE 
IT MIGHT NOT BE VERY CLEAR 
UNLESS YOU WANT TO PLUG IT BACK ON IT YOURS 
I THINK THE SCROLL WHEEL UM 
YEAH AND IF WE'RE GOING FOR SLEEK AND SEXY I THINK A SCROLL WHEEL IS MAYBE A BIT KINDA BULKY 
I I'VE GOT UM PICTURES WELL I'VE SEEN PICTURES WITH IT KIND OF STICKING OFF THE SIDE OF IT AND THEY DON'T REALLY LOOK GREAT 
YEAH A SIMPLE PUSHBUTTONS 
HMM 
BUT 
BUT THE WAY THAT I INTERPRET THAT UM IT DOESN'T SEEM TO SEND IT A SIGNAL TO THE TELLY 
IT JUST IT'S LIKE A PARROT JUST REP REPLY REPLYING TO YOUR MESSAGE 
SO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD AFFECT OUR CIRCUIT BOARD 
YEAH 
AND I DON'T THINK YOU COULD REALLY PERFORM ANY OF THE REMOTE FUNCTIONS WITH IT 
'CAUSE THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY'VE GIVEN THERE IS GOOD MORNING COFFEE MACHINE GOOD MORNING JOE 
IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO SAY LIKE WHERE ARE YOU REMOTE 
HERE I AM JO 
BUT I THINK THAT'S MAYBE AS FAR AS THAT ONE COULD GO 
YEAH JUST AS A FUN WAY TO FIND OUT 
AND IT SAYS THAT I THINK IT SAID THE COST OF THAT ISN'T TOO MUCH 
UM I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO FIND IT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'D UM 
YEAH I THINK SO 
MM-HMM 
I THINK 
I'LL JUST JUST CHECK WHAT IT SAID 
ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK IT REALLY SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT THE COST BUT IT SAYS THAT IT'S ALREADY ON THE COFFEE MACHINES SO 
LIKE IT'S ALREADY KIND OF 
UM 
UH THAT WAS QUICK 
UM OKAY SO VERY BRIEF PRESENTATION UM 
FROM LOOKING AT THE REMOTES THAT ARE OUT THERE AT THE MINUTE NONE OF THEM ARE PARTICULARLY UM SLEEK AND SEXY 
UM I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GET THE EXAMPLES OF THE SCROLL BUTTON THERE UM BUT THERE'S SOME CURVED CASES THAT YOU CAN USE UH A RANGE OF SIZES UH 
ALL OF THEM HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS EITHER UM THEY SEEM TO JUST HAVE THE RUBBER BUTTONS 
DOES THAT MOVE IT 
IT JUST SEEMS TO BE SKIPPING ON WITHOUT IS DOING ANYTHING 
UH IT'S ALRIGHT 
UM 
THERE WASN'T MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT JUST RAMBLING 
UM SOME OF THE UH REMOTES THAT I LOOKED AT ONE OF THE MODELS DA DID ACTUALLY HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION WHERE YOU COULD UM 
WHERE IT WAS CONNECTED TO THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS 
AND UH IT WAS QUITE UH A SWISH MODEL WHERE IT CAN CONTROL UH FOUR DEVICES T. V. CABLE SATELLITE VIDEO D. V. D. D 
UM SO THAT'S A BIT OF COMPETITION THERE 
SO 
I MEAN MAYBE IT'S BETTER NOT TO TRY AND COMPETE WITH THAT SORT OF THING AND JUST TO MARKET IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT UM 
LIKE DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT AS A KIND OF FINDING YOUR LOST CONTROL RATHER THAN TRYING TO COMPETE WITH THE FUNCTIONS 
UM THE SCROLL BUTTONS SO YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED UM 
THERE'S EXAMPLES OF THIS BUT THEY DON'T LIKE AS SLEEK AS OTHER MODELS 
AND THERE'S NO REAL ADVANTAGE AND BECAUSE IT IMPACTS ON THERE IN THE MATERIALS AND THE PRICE IT'S NOT GREAT 
UM 
YEAH 
TH THERE WAS A SPECIALIST TYPE OF REMOTE THAT WE COULD THINK ABOUT UM 
THERE WAS CHILDREN'S REMOTE 
WHERE UM THEY JUST HAD A VERY LIMITED RANGE OF BUTTONS AND THEY WERE B UH BRIGHT AND COLOURFUL AND UM YOU YOU COULD PROGRAM THEM IS THAT THEY COULD ONLY LOOK AT CERTAIN CHANNELS 
UM BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S REALLY IN OUR FIELD 
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IT THERE 
HMM 
HMM 
OKAY 
RIGHT WELL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BE AWARE OF 
UM 
I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY UM VERY GOOD VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE 
AND BECAUSE OURS MIGHT NOT COVER THE SAME FUNCTIONS THAT THE LEADING BRANDS DO IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO MARKET IT IS A UM FINDER FUNCTION 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES MIGHT NOT BE COMPATIBLE 
HMM 
YEAH 'CAUSE I THINK YOU PROGRAM UM THIS ONE YOURSELF LIKE TO SAY LIKE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO YOUR QUESTION 
HMM 
MAYBE UNLESS SOMETHING ELSE COMES UP 
UM YEAH I THINK UM I THINK WE'VE DECIDED THAT IT'S GONNA INCREASE THE COST AND GIVE AN REAL KINDA EXTRA BENEFIT AND IT'S GONNA DECREASE FROM THE SLEEKNESS OF IT 
HMM UM AND JUST TO BE AWARE THAT THERE ARE KIND OF SPECIALIST FUNCTIONS AND SPECIALIST REMOTES BUT WE PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THIS LIKE SUCH AS THE CHILDREN'S REMOTE 
YEAH 
UM THERE WAS A MENTION JUST IS KIND OF A WARNING ABOUT BUTTON DESIGN 
UM JUST TO AVOID AMBIGUITY 
SO TO GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF SAY YOUR VOLUME BUTTONS FOR UP AND DOWN THEY MIGHT BOTH HAVE A V. ONE FOR VOLUME 
UM LET'S THINK HOW THEY DID THIS 
I'M JUST GONNA CHECK SO I DO THIS RIGHT 
UM 
WHAT DID THEY SAY 
UM I THINK THE THING WAS THAT IF YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS TO HAVE TRIANGULAR BUTTONS 
UM SOMEBODY MIGHT LOOK AT THIS ONE AND SAY UH WELL THIS TRIANGULAR BUTTON IS POINTING UP AND THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT THEY USE 
ACTUALLY THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT CAN IT 
UH WELL NO THEY MIGHT SEE 
YEAH THEY MIGHT USE THIS POINTING DOWN AND THINK RIGHT THAT'S GONNA TURN THE VOLUME DOWN 
WHEREAS THE ACTUAL BUTTON'S POINTING UP AS THE FUNCTION IS TO TURN THE BUTTON UP 
SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PUT IN THE BUTTONS AND BE CAREFUL OF THE SHAPE THAT YOU MAKE THEM BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE KIND OF TWO UM 
CONTRADICTING KIND OF SHAPES 
YEAH 
UM AND I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY FOR THAT 
UM SO WHAT WAS THE DECISION ON THE UM DESIGN OF THE VOLUME BUTTON 
OH OKAY 
I THINK IF YOU START MAKING THE BUTTONS FRUIT SHAPED IT MIGHT MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED TO USE 
YEAH 
MAYBE JUST ONE BUTTON SAY THE STANDBY BUTTON IS QUITE KINDA SEPARATE FROM ALL THE OTHER FUNCTIONS 
MAYBE THAT COULD BE A LITTLE APPLE 
AND THEN THAT WOULDN'T GET IN THE WAY OF LIKE KINDA ONE TO NINE AND IT WOULDN'T CONFUSE THE NUMBERS 
HMM 
SO 
BUT I SUPPOSE AS LONG AS IT'S QUITE A SUBTLE DESIGN UM EVEN IF THE DESIGN KIND OF CHANGES 
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE RUBBER CASES AS WELL AS BUTTONS 
AND THAT YOU CAN MAKE THEM CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED AND THAT WOULD BE THE KIND OF SLEEK AND SEXY LOOK 
OH RIGHT THAT FITS DOESN'T IT 
RIGHT 
AND THAT WOULD FIT IN WITH WHAT WE WANT WOULDN'T IT FOR THE SPONGY FEEL TO HAVE EVERYTHING RUBBER 
HMM 
YEAH AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE UH BUT YOU STILL WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE LOGO ON EVERY NEW CASE 
BUT YOU COULD HAVE LIKE PINK CASES FOR GIRLS AND RED ONES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
HMM 
BUT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO USE THE UM COMPANY COLOUR SCHEME AREN'T WE 
WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THAT YET 
IT MIGHT AND WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO BOTH BUT IT MIGHT CLASH WITH CERTAIN THINGS 
HMM 
WELL IF IT'S FOR YOUNG PEOPLE UM LIKE THE PHONE GENERATION 
THAT SORT OF THING'D PROBABLY GO DOWN WELL AND THE MARKET RESEARCH HAS BEEN IN THAT SIDE OF THINGS HASN'T IT 
OKAY SO IF WE JUST WENT FOR ONE COLOUR OF A RUBBER CASE 
DID WE DECIDE ON THE RUBBER CASE 
THE SPONGY FEEL OR DID WE THINK THAT THAT MIGHT GO AS A TREND 
UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT UH THE CURVATURE OF THE CASE 
THERE'S FLAT THERE'S SINGLE CURVED AND THERE'S DOUBLE CURVED 
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THESE THINGS LIKE LIKE 
WELL IT SAYS THAT 
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE 
UM I'LL SHOW YOU 
THE REMOTES THAT I'VE GOT 
SO HOW UH 
LET'S JUST GET THAT BIGGER 
SO HOW UH THE ONE UH I'M NOT PLUGGED IN UM I 
THAT DOESN'T HELP 
SHALL I JUST TURN IT AROUND FOR TIME 
HMM 
UM IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR UP THERE BUT YOU CAN USE SOME OF THEM HAVE GOT KIND OF BULGES 
LIKE THE SECOND ONE AND THE AND ONE UH WHERE THERE'S A CURVE THERE 
I'M NOT EXACTL I DON'T KNOW OF A DOUBLE CURVE SO MAYBE IT COMES UP SLIGHTLY OR 
BUT UM IT IS A KINDA SLEEKER LOOK IF YOU'VE GOT CURVES IN THERE 
DEFINITELY A SINGLE MAYBE A DOUBLE 
SHALL WE GO FOR SINGLE CURVE JUST TO COMPROMISE 
YEAH 
AND THE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS RUBBER CASE 
UM AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE COLOUR SCHEME OUR LOGO YET DO WE BUT POSSIBLY A STICKER 
YEAH 
YEAH AND AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION WE CAN SEE THAT CAN'T WE JUST TO FIND OUT 
WITHOUT AFFECTING THE CIRCUIT BOARD 
YEAH THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULDN'T DO TOO MUCH HARM IN A COUPLE OF YEARS 
UH WHAT SORT OF SHAPE DO WE WANT 
YEAH SO IT'S NOT TOO WACKY 
UM I THINK AN APPLE WOULD BE A GOOD RECOGNISABLE SHAPE 
IF YOU START GETTING INTO KINDA AUBERGINES AND THINGS IT GETS A BIT WEIRD 
VOTE 
SHALL WE VOTE ON IT 
ANYONE GOT ANY SUGGESTIONS 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
OH 
WELL IT COULD BE RED 
YEAH 'CAUSE WE WANNA INCORPORATE A BIT OF COLOUR IF WE CAN ONCE WE FIND OUT UM 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT SEEMS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD 
'CAUSE MOST OF THEM WILL JUST BE KIND OF MAINLY CIRCULAR OR LIKE VERY PLAIN 
UH JUST TO KEEP THE SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS SIMPLE 
UH JUST THE UH SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING 
RIGHT 
OKAY SO 
RIGHT WELL UM FROM THE LAST MEETING I WAS TRYING TO SEND YOU THE MINUTES 
BUT UH IT DIDN'T WORK OUT TO WELL SO MAYBE IN SORT OF UM 
QUICK SUMMARY OF THE LAST UH MEETING I CAN 
QUICKLY GIVE YOU 
WHAT WE WHAT WE HAD 
OH RIGHT SO 
WISHING I HADN'T CLOSED THE DAMN RIGHT SO WE HAD THE FACT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE THE LOGO UH THE COMPANY LOGO ON ITS UH COLOUR SCHEME INCORPORATED INTO THE THE DEVICE THE REMOTE DEVICE 
WE HAD UH MADE OUR DECISIONS ABOUT UH 
MADE OUR DECISIONS ABOUT UH 
THE DEVICE ITSELF THAT IT WAS GONNA BE SIMPLE TO MAKE IT UH 
ENABLE US TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT IN TIME 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE UH EFFECTIVELY TWO PAGES A FRONT PAGE WHICH HAD THE UH FEATURES THAT THE UH THE CUSTOMERS MOST WANTED 
AND THEN THE UH THE BACKUP FEATURES IN THE SECOND PAGE IS THAT IT COULD UH 
MEET THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS 
AND THE CUSTOMERS WOULDN'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM TOO OFTEN ONLY USE AND WHEN REQUIRED 
SO 
SO BASICALLY WHAT DECISIONS UH HAVE WE UH MADE 
UH HAVE THREE BEEN ANY UH CHANGES 
RIGHT 
THREE PRESENTATION YEAH 
SO YEAH FINE 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
WHAT WOULD BE THE COST D DO WE KNOW 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WITH THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS YOU WERE GOING FOR THE 
MM-HMM 
BUT ARE WE GOING F R RIGHT 
SO ARE WE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION NOW IN A SENSE THAT THIS IS THE POINT AT WHICH WE'RE DISCUSSING THAT ISSUE 
SO WOULD IT NOT BE BEST TO RATHER THAN I MEAN ONE WAY IS TO DO EACH OF THE PRESENTATIONS AND THEN MAKE DECISIONS GOING BACK TO THE VARIOUS PRESENTATIONS SO THEY WERE 
THE OTHER WAY WOULD BE TO DO THE PRESENTATION AND THEN MAKE THE DECISION AT THAT POINT IN TIME 
'CAUSE IT THAT POINT THEN YOU'VE GOT THE DETAILS UP THERE 
SO IF WE WANTED TO KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT THE SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRED THE REGULAR AND WHAT REQUIRED ADVANCE 
THEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO USE THAT DOWN THEN WE COULD MAKE THE DECISION AT THAT POINT IN TIME AND THEN THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THAT ISSUE 
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE 
MM-HMM 
IN THE SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRED THE REGULAR IS THE 
HMM 
OKAY 
THE DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP THE DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP WHICH IN TURN IS MORE EXPENSE 
OKAY 
DOWN 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
SO 
SO WE'RE GOING FOR UP OKAY 
SO SO UM 
SIMPLE PUSH BUTTON 
MM-HMM 
SO IF WE GO FOR THE SIMPLE PUSH BUTTON IS EFFECTIVELY WE'RE GOING FOR THE SIMPLE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD ARE WE 
OR ARE WE GOING FOR THE REGULAR 
MM MM 
BUT IS THERE ANY OTHER I MEAN OKAY THAT'S TRUE FOR THE FOR FOR THAT ELEMENT BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL EL ELEMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION 
AND SO IF THERE IS AN ELEMENT THAT REQUIRES THE MORE EXPENSIVE NO 
OR SAY THE REGULAR ONE OR THE MORE ADVANCED THAN THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE SAME FOR ALL OF THEM 
SO 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
NO 
MM MM 
OKAY 
SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD 
SIMPLE PUSH BUTTON 
OKAY 
W W KINETIC 
YOU WERE YOU WERE WANTING TO GO FOR THE KINETIC POWER SUPPLY 
MM-HMM 
AND HOW DOES IT GOT UH CHARGED UP 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION WAS ARE WE GOING FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
NO 
'CAUSE THAT REQUIRED THE ADVANCED 
I HAD SPEECH RECOGNITION REQUIRES ADVANCED REQ REQUIRE 
OH 
SO OKAY 
SPEECH RECOGNITION YOU RECKON THEN AS AS SIMPLE 
AND SO WE WOULD WANT TO ONE IS AN EXTRA BECAUSE IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO COST TOO MUCH 
WOULD THAT BE 
IN FACT IT WOULDN'T REALLY COST ANYMORE WOULD IT 
AND THEN HAVE TO CHANGE ALL CHANGE EVERYTHING AT THE LAST MINUTE 
OKAY 
SO 
SORRY 
YEAH I'VE FOUND THAT TRY AND GET IT BACK 
SO YOU WERE SAYING THE SCROLL BUTTONS 
MM-HMM 
WELL WE'RE TO GO FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET RATHER THAN A LOCAL MARKET ABOUT THAT THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY PRECLUDE THE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN OFTEN DO WITH PRODUCTS AS YOU CAN UH MAKE SMALL MODIFICATIONS 
SO YOU HAVE YOUR BASIC MODEL WHICH YOU WOULD SELL AT WHATEVER 
AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE ADDITIONAL FEATURES IN YOU KNOW LIKE A YOU'D HAVE MODEL ONE 
MODEL TWO AND MODEL THREE AND THEREFORE YOU CAN SUB DIVIDE YOUR MARKET UP 
BUT THAT'S REALLY WHERE YOUR FIELD SO 
ANYWAY YOU COULD ADD ONE FOR AN EXTRA PACKAGE 
BUT IN THIS BASIC ONE I'M RECKONING THAT WE'RE GOING FOR THE BASIC MODEL TO BE DISCUSSED HERE AND THAT UH YOU WOULD HAVE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDING AN EXTRA FEATURES AT EXTRA COST TO TAKE CARE OF SPECIALIST MARKET SEGMENTS 
SO THAT IS IS WHAT ARE WE DECIDING TO DO HERE 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
UH THE F YEAH THE FINDER FUNCTION RATHER THAN AS A SPEECH FUNCTION TO FIND YOUR REMOTE 
OKAY 
HMM 
SO YOU'D HAVE A FINDER FEATURE RATHER THAN A VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE 
AND YOU WERE TALKING 
MM 
AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SCROLL BUTTONS 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT SO WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE THE THE RUBBER BUTTONS WAS THAT RIGHT 
OKAY 
IS NOT TO BE FOCUSED ON 
GOOD IN IN FLIP IT AROUND IN NINETY DEGREE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES AND HAVE IT UP AND DOWN 
AN UPSIDE DOWN V. 
SO THAT WOULD SHOW THAT VOLUME WAS GOING UP WHEREAS THE ONE UNDERNEATH WOULD USE THE VOLUME GOING DOWN 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YOU COULD HAVE VOLUME UP AND VOLUME VOLUME UP DOWN AND LIKE THAT 
AND 'CAUSE THE IDEA WAS TO HAVE LIMITED UM IT WAS TO HAVE SIZABLE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ON IT 
LIMITED NUMBER OF BUTTONS 
'CAUSE IT WAS SIXTEEN BUTTONS WASN'T IT THAT WERE 
OKAY 
YOU KNOW YOURSELF 
WELL YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL HOW YOU SHAPE YOUR BUTTONS 'CAUSE YOU'RE CAN MIS DIRECT PEOPLE 
AND I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THE FUNCTIONALITY 'CAUSE THE PEOPLE GET CHEESED OFF BY THINGS BY HAVING TO READ INSTRUCTIONS ET CETERA SO 
OKAY 
NOW 
YEAH 
STAND BY BUTTON 
NO THA THAT THAT INCORPORATES THE TREND WHILST AT THE SAME TIME NOT CONFUSING PEOPLE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FUNCTIONALITY 
BUT WHAT ARE THEY GONNA BE NEXT YEAH 
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA BE NEXT YEAR 
BUT BUT TH BUT OKAY BUT YOU YOU CAN INCORPORATE THE TR IF YOU IF YOU CHANGE ALL THE BUTTONS THEN YOU'VE GOT THE PROBLEM THAT THIS YEAR'S FRUIT AND VEG 
NEXT YEAR'S UH I WAS GONNA SAY ANIMALS OR ELEPHANTS ARE WE WHATEVER 
THAT MEANS YOU'RE CONSTANTLY CHANGING YOUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULE AND YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE DIFFERENT MOULDS AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST 
WELL 
UH D D BUT IF MM-HMM 
WELL 
YEP 
WAS THAT IN THE SORT OF FASHION SENSE THAT THIS OR WAS THE SPONGY FEEL WAS THAT UH SORT OF FASHION 
IT WAS WASN'T IT 
SO THE 
MM-HMM 
RUBBER BUTTONS REQUIRE RUBBER CASE 
UH SO YEAH 
THE UM THE MAIN PROBLEM IS HOW F HOW FREQUENTLY DO THE FASHIONS CHANGE 
'CAUSE IN ESSENCE IN THE PRODUCTION YOU WANT THINGS TO STAY YOU WANT TO BASICALLY MINT THEM OUT 'CAUSE IF YOU'VE GOT FASHION CHANGES AND THAT YOU'RE INCORPORATING 
THEN IT MEANS THAT YOUR STOCK IS UM AS LAST YEAR'S STOCK AND THEREFORE YOU'RE SELLING IT ARE HAVING TO SELL IT IT A DISCOUNTED RATE WHICH YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DO 
WHEREAS IF YOU KEPT THE PRODUCT THE SAME BUT YOU COULD HAVE A DIFFERENCE FROM YOUR TO YOUR 
UH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU COULD INCORPORATE A FASHION STATEMENT IF YOU LOOK RATHER THAN CHANGING THE WHOLE KIT AND CABOODLE 
YOU'RE JUST CHANGING ONE ASPECT LIKE LIKE THE STANDBY BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE THEN YOU COULD MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT 
WELL YOU MIGHT BE LIMITED IN SPACE THAT YES 
WELL YOU TWO ARE OBVIOUSLY GONNA FIND THAT OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY WHEN YOU MOVE OVER TO YOUR KIT MODELLING STAGE IS IT UH HOW MUCH PL HOW MUCH HOW MUCH HOW PLIABLE IS PLASTICINE 
HMM 
SO YOU'RE TALKING THERE BUT UH CHANGING 
CHANGING THE CASING 
YEAH YOU YOU COULD DO A COLOUR CHANGE 
SO THEREFORE YOU WOULD YEAH YEAH I MEAN THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT THEY DID WITH THE WITH THE MOBILE PHONES WAS TO HAVE SOME IN BLUE 
SOME IN RED SOME ONE RATHER THAN ALL IN BLACK OR YOU KNOW WHICH FOR DO YOU WANT AS LONG AS IT'S BLACK 
BUT UH SO 
YES UH THAT'S TRUE UH THAT MIGHT NO 
WELL NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE YOUR COMPANY UH WE'RE WE'RE MEANT TO BE FINISHING UP 
YOU COULD HAVE YOUR COMPANY BADGE AND LOGO 
I MEAN A LOT OF UM COMPUTERS FOR INSTANCE LIKE LIKE IN THE ONE YOU'VE GOT THREE 
IT ACTUALLY HAS A SORT OF UM STICK ON BADGE SO WHAT YOU WOULD AL ALL YOU WOULD REALLY NEED 
WHETHER IT YOU KNOW WHETHER THE CASING BE W ANY COLOUR COULD BE ANY COLOUR 
BUT THAT BADGE WOULD THEN HAVE TO STICK IT ON TOP OF IT IS THAT UH IN A SENSE 
WITH A WITH A LOGO LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S IN A WHITE BACKGROUND 
THE ONLY COLOUR THAT IT MIGHT NOT STICK IT AS WELL ONE WOULD BE A WHITE CASING 
'CAUSE YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE SORT OF YOU'RE BADGING IT 
AND IN FACT A LOT OF COMPANIES GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO MAKE THEM AND LITERALLY JUST BADGE THEM THEMSELVES WITH THEIR OWN UH BADGE OVER THE TOP 
AND IN FACT THE WAY THEY'VE GOT THAT THERE EVEN IF YOU HAD THAT IN A WHITE WHICH IS THE PREDOMINANT COLOUR OF THE UH THE WINDOWS BADGE 
YOU'D STILL BE ABLE TO USE IT CLEARLY FROM YOU KNOW A WHITE CASING UH PRODUCT 
SO 
IT'S UH IN IN THE HOUSE ISN'T IT I SUPPOSE 
SO DON'T CHANGE CASE 
CHANGE CASE COLOUR 
AND WE'RE SORT OF SAYING NO IT THAT 
YEAH 
SOUNDS REASONABLE 
IF YOU'RE GOING FOR FASHION TRENDS LIKE THAT THEY'LL NEED TO YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE INTERCHANGEABLE CASES SO THAT YOU COULD OR 'CAUSE OTHERWISE SOMEONE'S GONNA HAVE TO BUY A COMPLETE NEW REMOTE RATHER THAN JUST A CASE 
OKAY 
NO ONE THING TO CONS ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT IN SOME WAYS YOU WANT ME BY HAVING A FAIRLY STANDARD CASE IT MEANS THEY CAN ALL FIT TOGETHER ON TOP OF EACH OTHER THEREFORE FOR STORAGE PURPOSES IN SHOPS AND THE LOOK AND IT MAKES IT SURE THAT YOU CAN IF YOU CAN STORE THEM UP ON TOP OF EACH OTHER 
WHEREAS IF YOU DO UM FANCY THINGS WITH IT YOU THEN GOTTA PUT IT IN A C A A PACKAGING BOX THAT THAT DOES THAT 
AND THE COST OF PACKAGING COULD BE QUITE IMPORTANT VIS A VIS THE TOTAL COST OF THE PRODUCT 
SO BUT 
NO 
MM YEP 
OH RIGHT 
SO SO DO YOU WANNA GO FOR CURVES MORE CURVES 
WE'RE MEANT TO BE IF WE'RE MEANT TO BE FINISHING THIS MEETING IN ABOUT A MINUTE OR SO 
OKAY CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED 
SO IT'S SINGLE CURVED 
YEP 
YES 
YEP 
SO WE'VE GOT SPONGY FEEL BUTTONS AS WELL HAVE WE 
AS WELL SO ARE WE ARE WAS THAT 
SO IT'S RUBBER BUTTONS SO IT'S NOT REALLY SPONGY FEEL BUTTONS IT'S JUST RUBBER BUTTONS 
WITH A RUBBER CASE RIGHT 
AND THE STANDBY BUTTON IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT 
OKAY SO WHAT WHAT SHAPE OR WE MAKING THE STANDBY BUTTON 
A PEOPLE 
OH OH SORRY 
A RED APPLE 
SO IT 
SORRY WHAT WAS THAT LAST THING AGAIN THREE 
RIGHT MUCH OPTION ON THAT 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING FOR A SINGLE CURVE AND 
ALRIGHT 
RIGHT SO SHAPE OF BUTTONS SIMPLE 
OKAY 
SO THAT'S THAT I GUESS 
WE SHOULD NOW GO AWAY AND GET THESE THINGS SORTED OUT 
I GUESS YOU TWO OR ON PLASTICINE DUTY OR WHATEVER 
OKAY SO UM 
OKAY 
I THINK WE ALL HAVE A PRESENTATION AGAIN SO IF WE GO THROUGH THIS AND THEN UM 
SHALL I GO FIRST AGAIN 
I SEE THIS A LITTLE MORE SMOOTHLY THAN THE LAST ONE 
OKAY RIGHT LET'S GET STARTED 
UM 
BASICALLY THE UH FOR THE UM I'LL BACK ACTUALLY 
FOR THE COMPONENTS DESIGN UM NEXT STEP IS BASICALLY THE THE WAY THE REMOTE'S GONNA WORK IS STILL THE SAME IDEA AS BEFORE 
WE STILL HAVE THE USER INTERFACE WHICH IS ALL THE BUTTONS WE'RE GONNA INCORPORATE 
THEN THERE IS A CHIP AND STILL THE SENDER 
SO UM YES INCLUDING THE POWER S SUPPLY AS WELL 
UM I'LL GO ON TO MY FINDINGS ON EACH OF THESE AREAS 
UH FIRST ON THE POWER SUPPLY WE HAVE THE OPTION OF JUST THE STANDARD BATTERY 
UM 
THERE'S A DYNAMO 
ANY OF YOU THINK OF KIND OF LIKE THE THE OLD TORCHES WHICH YOU WIND UP UM 
THERE'S A KINETIC OPTION WHICH OF ANY OF YOU'VE SEEN THOSE NEW WATCHES WHICH YOU KIND OF YOU POWER UP BY WAVING AROUND 
UM IT JUST REQUIRES A SMALL AMOUNT OF MOVEMENT WHICH WOULD MEAN THE BATTERIES WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE REPLACED 
UM THAT'S AN OPTION BUT I THINK THAT WAS GONNA COST A LITTLE MORE 
AND THEN THERE'S SOLAR CELLS 
UM AS A FINAL OPTION 
FOR THE BUTTONS WE HAVE UM AN INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTON WHICH IS UH JUST TO SAY ALL ALL THESE ARE UM SUPPLIED BY REAL REACTION 
SO I GUESS FOR THE EASE OF FOR QUICKNESS AND SO WE SHOULD TAKE THEM FROM AT LEAST LIKE ONE OF THESE OPTIONS 
UM SO FOR THE BUTTONS THERE'S AN INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTON WHICH I GUESS SO JUST THE SAME AS THE STANDARD ONES 
THIS SAYS IT'S UH SIMILAR TO UH THE BUTTON ON THE MOUSE FOR A NORMAL FOR LIKE UH LIKE MODERN COMPUTER 
UM THERE'S A SCROLL WHEEL 
WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE NEW MOUSE HAS JUST GOT LIKE THE CENTRE SECTION WHICH YOU CAN SCROLL UP AND DOWN WHICH MAY BE FOR THE VOLUME 
YOU COULD DO DO THAT 
UM AN ISSUE FOR THE BUTTONS SO DEPENDING ON WHICH MATERIAL WE USE 
IF WE USE RUBBER BUTTONS THEN IT REQUIRES A RUBBER CASE SO WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION 
UM MOVING ON TO THE PRINTED S 
UM THAT'S IN THE NEXT I TH I THINK TH THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE COST 
THAT THAT RELATED TO THE ACTUAL BUTTONS BUT IT DOES AFFECT THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD 
UM WHICH IS THE NEXT SECTION 
BASICALLY FOR THE CIRCUIT BOARD WHICH IS THE MIDDLE IT'S JUST USE IT DOWN THERE THE CHIPS LIKE THE LIKE THE WORKINGS OF THE ACTUAL UM OF THE REMOTE 
THE FIRM SUPPLIES A SIMPLE A REGULAR AND AN ADVANCED UM CIRCUIT BOARD 
AND THERE'S DIFFERENT PRICES ACCORDING TO EACH 
SO IF WE'VE GOT THE SCROLL WHEEL FOR ONE OF THE BUTTONS 
THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SLIGHTLY MORE ADVANCED CIRCUIT BOARD THEN IF WE JUST HAD A STANDARD UM PUSH BUTTON 
UM IN FINAL THING WE COME UP WITH WAS SOME INFORMATION ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
THERE'S A SMALL UNIT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE COMPANY UM WHICH OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE AN EXTRA COST BUT IT WOULDN'T AFFECT THE SIZE OF THE REMOTE TOO MUCH 
UM AND I GUESS THAT WOULD REQUIRE A MORE ADVANCED CIRCUIT BOARD SO THERE IS AN EXTRA PRICE ON THAT SENSE 
THERE IS THE SORRY AN EXTRA COST IN THAT SENSE 
UM GOING TO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
UM I THOUGHT POSSIBLY FOR POWER WE COULD USE KINETIC UM WHICH IS THE IDEA OF THE WATCHES UM THAT YOU MOVE YOU MOVE THE REMOTE AROUND TO POWER IT UP 
AND THIS WOULD AVOID BATTERIES RUNNING OUT HAVING TO REPLACE BATTERIES AND SUCH LIKE 
UM FOR THE BUTTONS I THOUGHT WE'D PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH JUST HAVING THE STANDARD UM PUSH BUTTONS RATHER THAN THE SCROLL WHEEL 
UM AND FOR THE CIRCUIT BOARD AGAIN DEPENDS ON WHICH FEATURES WE WANT IN THE ACTUAL IN THE REMOTE 
SO IF WE WANTED THE SCROLL WHEEL AND WANTED THE VOICE RECOGNITION UM THEN WE'D HAVE TO GET A A MORE COSTLY CIRCUIT BOARD 
AND THAT'S IT 
UM I IT KIND OF DEPENDS UM IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION WE'D HAVE TO PROBABLY GET AN ADVANCED ONE 
I'M GUESSING 
UH BUT I DON'T KNOW SO THAT IS SOMETHING I'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO 
UM THAT'S A THAT'S A DECISION FOR ALL OF US 
UM 
YEAH YEAH 
WE DECIDE 
YEAH 
UM 
MAYBE WE 
UM 
YES 
SO THERE 
UM 
WE COULD DO YEAH 
UM YEAH WE SHOULD 
SO I SAY IT ONLY SPECIFIED THAT WE NEED A MORE ADVANCED CIRCUIT BOARD FOR THE SCROLL WHEEL 
IT DIDN'T THE VOICE RECOGNITION CAME AS A SEPARATE PIECE OF INFORMATION 
UM 
YEAH IF IF YOU DOWN UM 
IT'S JUST THIS BUT AT THE BOTTOM WHICH I'VE HIGHLIGHTED 
BUT THE SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRES A MINI M MINIMALLY A REGULAR CHIP WHICH IS IN THE HIGHER PRICE RANGE 
ALSO THE DISPLAY'S FOR SOMETHING ELSE WHICH WE DECIDED AGAINST 
UM BUT THAT BUT 
AND NOT THAT THE PUSH BUTTON JUST REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP IS THAT WOULD KEEP THE PRICE DOWN 
'KAY 
SO MAYBE JUST A SIMPLE PUSH BUTTON AND THAT WOULD CUT COSTS ON THE 
DID EVERYONE GET THIS IN THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
THE UM IT WAS BASICALLY WHAT WE SAID BEFORE THE IDEA THAT YOU RECORD IN A SET 
MESSAGE AND THEN IT PICKS UP THAT MESSAGE UM AND REPLIES TO YOU 
SO IT IS BASICALLY THE CONCEPT WE DISCUSSED BEFORE 
UM BUT THEN WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHETHER IT WOULD REQUIRE A MORE COMPLICATED CIRCUIT BOARD 
I'M GUESSING IT WOULD ABOUT GOT LIKE THE DEFINITE INFORMATION 
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO ON WHAT WE'RE CERTAIN OF RATHER THAN 
UM IF IT'S JUST THE PUSH BUTTON THEN IT JUST NEEDS THE SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD 
SO MAYBE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING SEPARATE YEAH 
OKAY SO WE'D HAVE A SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD AND THAT WOULD BE AN EXTRA THAT WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO IT 
UH THAT MAKES SENSE 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE SO WE'D STICK WITH THE SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD AND THEN THINK OF THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS AN EXTRA 
AN EXTRA POSSIBILITY 
OKAY 
UM 
UM YEAH I I THOUGHT SO JUST FOR JUST FOR EASE OF NOT HAVING TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES 
UM 
IT'S UM I THINK IT WORKS ON THE BASIS THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF BALL BEARINGS INSIDE 
IT'S UM IT'S SOME IN WATCHES WHICH YOU YOU KIND OF YOU SHAKE IT POWER IT UP 
SOMEHOW THE MECHANISM INSIDE POWERS UP THROUGH MOVEMENT 
SO YOU'D YOU'D MOVE THE REMOTE AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THAT POWERS IT UP TO USE IT 
OH YEAH I THINK DID WE DECIDE IT DIDN'T AFFECT THE CIRCUIT BOARD IT JUST AFFECTED 
IT WAS JUST 
OH NO THA THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT MAYBE MAYBE IT DOESN'T 
UM I THINK I MIGHT HAVE GOT THAT WRONG 
IT'S IT'S JUST IN ADDITION THING IT'S UM YEAH 
'KAY 
'KAY SHALL I PASS ON IT YOU NOW 
I ASSUME IT WOULD COST EXTRA BUT 
MAYBE WE MAYBE WE'LL FIND OUT HOW MUCH THAT DOES COST AND HAVE TO DECIDE SLIGHTLY LATER 
IF YOU RIGHT CLICK AND THEN GO INTO A PREVIOUS SLIDE 
OKAY RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
IN THE PRICE YEAH 
'KAY 
I GUESS I GUESS WE'RE GOING FOR THE BIGGEST MARKET MAYBE NOT BUT 
WAS IT WAS IT SPECIFIED THAT WE WENT FOR THE BIGGEST 
SO MAYBE THE CHILDREN'S REMOTE SHOULD BE LIKE A A NEXT STEP BUT MAYBE I DUNNO FOR OURS MAYBE WE SHOULD 
YEAH 
SO YOU ALSO USED FOR GOING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET UM THAT SOME SOME MAYBE OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
SO SO SO UM 
YEAH YEAH 
IT W IT WOULD MAKE IT QUITE COMPLICATED WHERE UM OURS AT LEAST KEEPS IT FAIRLY SIMPLE AND THEN THE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES YES 
SO MAYBE WE COULD HAVE LIKE 
YEAH 
YEAH I I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
SO MAYBE WE COULD HAVE VOLUME WRITTEN ON THE SIDE AND THEN UP AND DOWN ON THE ON THE BUTTONS THEMSELVES 
POSSIBLE 
MM 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WE GET IT DOWN TO NOT TOO MANY 
UM 
ARE WE ARE WE GONNA GO THROUGH THE DESIGN OF ALL THE BUTTONS AT THE MOMENT OR ARE WE GONNA IT 
YEAH MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE YOURS FIRST 
'KAY 
WELL I DUNNO I I GUESS MAYBE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES MAY BE POPULAR AT THE MOMENT BUT SO WE KNOW HOW FICKLE THE FASHION MARKETS OR MAYBE 
I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS REALISTIC THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET ISN'T THE KIND OF THING WHICH TAKES ONE 
THESE KINDS OF FASHION TRENDS 
IT SOMETHING WHICH IS MAYBE MORE UNIVERSAL 
WE C MAYBE CAN IMPLY A FRUIT SHAPE POSSIBLY 
MAYBE THE SPONGY FEEL IS SOMETHING WE COULD THINK ABOUT UM 
MAYBE STILL WITH A RUBBER DESIGN WE COULD 
UM 
OH YEAH YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS WERE IF YOU HAD RUBBER BUTTONS THEN YOU HAD TO HAVE A RUBBER CASE 
UM UH NO NO NO SORRY IT'S IF YOU USE THE UH RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED CASE THEN YOU MUST USE RUBBER BUTTONS 
THAT'S THE WAY AROUND 
IF YOU HAVE THE RUBBER CASE THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RUBBER BUTTONS TO GO WITH IT 
WHICH MAKES SENSE 
UM 
YEAH 
I SUPPOSE WE MAYBE OR LIMITED IN THE FACT THAT WE STILL HAVE TO PUT THE LOGO ON THE ACTUAL WOULD OR NOT 
YEAH 
YES YES 
MAYBE WE COULD THINK OF THE THE CASES LIKE CHANGING WITH THE FASHIONS LIKE THE NOKIA PHONES WHERE YOU COULD TAKE THE CASING OFF THE OUTSIDE 
BUT WHETHER THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO INCORPORATE IN PRODUCTION WHETHER THAT WOULD JUST INCREASE THE COSTS MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED 
YEAH THE A THE ACTUAL THE SORT OF THE LIKE FROM THE OUTSIDE IS WHERE THE BUTTONS WOULD STAY THE SAME 
AND THE GENERAL FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE WOULD STAY THE SAME BUT YOU COULD CHANGE THE THE WAY IT LOOKED 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
SO IT IS A POSSIBILITY UM 
OH OKAY YES THAT IS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
AND WHETHER WE'D HAVE A BIG ENOUGH MARKET TO HAVE THIS KIND OF LIKE SECONDARY MARKET OF SELLING THE CASES 
MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER 
YEAH 
YEAH I SUPPOSE WHERE YOU YOU KEEP THE REMOTE HIDDEN UNDER THE SOFA MOST OF THE TIME 
YEAH LESS LIKELY TO 
SO THEN THE THE THAT WOULD 
YEAH 
IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE THAT WE WE'D JUST MAYBE STICK WITH THE STANDARD RUBBER CASE AND THEN HAVE THE STANDARD RUBBER BUTTONS AS WELL 
UM 
UM 
MAYBE 
MAYBE CURVES GIVE IT LIKE THE SLIGHTLY MORE AESTHETIC FEEL 
BUT THE DOUBLE CURVE WOULDN'T REQUIRE US TO PERFORM MIRACLES WITH THE PLASTICINE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
SO SHALL WE GO THROUGH QUICKLY AND JUST WORK OUT WHAT WE'VE DECIDE ON IF WE HAVE TO KIND OF 
'KAY SO SHALL WE QUICKLY 
WE'LL GO FOR SINGLE CURVE YEAH 
SINGLE CURVE 
SO DID WE DID WE DECIDE ON THE KINETIC POWER SUPPLY 
THE ONE YOU MOVE AROUND 
OKAY 
UM 
UH WE C YEAH YEAH WE'LL STILL HAVE THE ARE WE GONNA GO FOR THE SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD JUST TO KEEP THE COST DOWN 
I TH I THINK WE CAN BY BY NOT HAVING ANYTHING TOO COMPLICATED 
UM 
UM 
AND SO WE COULD ALWAYS DECIDE AGAINST OUT OF SOMETHING COMES UP THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THAT WE SEEMED TO LEAVE IT 
YEAH IT WAS JUST 
'KAY 
WE WILL GO FOR THE A A A APPLES APPLES 
OKAY 
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ARE YOU GONNA WORK ON KEEPING THE BUTTON DESIGN QUITE SIMPLE 
JUST LIKE THE 
JUST WORKING OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FOR THE NEXT TIME 
UM 
YEAH 
'KAY 
AND J YEAH JUST KEEPING THE SORT OF THE LABELLING THEM LABELLING OF THEM FAIRLY SIMPLE AS WELL 
FAIRLY SORT OF SELF EXPLANATORY 
OKAY 
SO THAT THE END 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO ARE WE GOING FOR THE WE ARE WE GOING FOR THE SIMPLE ONE OR WE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 
I SUPPOSE WE NEED WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT CIRCUIT BOARD THAT REQUIRES MAYBE BEFORE WE M MAKE A DECISION 
OH YEAH I SUPPOSE SO YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
JUST 
JUST JUST FOR THE CALL AND FIND THING 
'CAUSE IT'S SO IT'S SEPARATE ISN'T IT IT'S NOT PART OF THE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AND OURS IS QUITE A CHEAP DEVICE SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT INTO IT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
I'VE I'VE GOT SOME THINGS TO SAY ABOUT POSSIBLE DESIGN THINGS FROM 
TREND WATCHING 
COOL 
RIGHT UM I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME TRENDS 
NO NO SORT OF BASICALLY FASHION ON TOP OF DOING THE UM RESEARCH INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET THE THE ONE THAT'S THE ONE I TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME 
THAT WE'D SORT OF ASKED PEOPLE ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS AND WHAT WHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THEM WHAT WAS BAD WHAT THEY SAID 
AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN LOOKING AT SORT OF OF SORT OF FASHIONS AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE WANTING OUT OF CONSUMER GOODS AT THE MOMENT 
SO WE'VE HAD PEOPLE IN PARIS AND MILAN WATCHING THE UH FASHION TRENDS 
SO 
SO JUST TO SUMMARISE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WHICH CAME OUT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET INVESTIGATION 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS THAT THE THING SORT OF LOOK AND FELT FANCY RATHER THAN JUST FUNCTIONAL 
AND SECOND THERE SHOULD BE SOME TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION 
AND THEN THIRD AND L LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER TWO THREE SHOULD BE AN EASE OF US AS WELL 
AND APPARENTLY THE FASHION TRENDS ARE THAT PEOPLE WANT SORT OF CLOTHES AND SHOES AND THINGS WITH A FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THEME 
UM BUT UM THE FEEL OF THE MATERIAL SHOULD BE SPONGY WHICH IS CONTRARY TO LAST YEAR APPARENTLY 
I PRESUME IT MUST HAVE BEEN NOT NOT SPONGY LAST YEAR 
SO 
WE NEED TO EMPHASISE THE FANCY DESIGN WITH ONE IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL ABOVE ALL ELSE 
AND THEN ALSO TRY AND ADD IN TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMAT INNOVATION WHICH COULD BE OUR SORT OF FIND THE THING WITH A HAND CLAP 
AND THEN WE NEED TO UM SORT OF MAKE IT EASY TO USE THAT'S AS A THIRD PRIORITY 
SO PERHAPS UM FEWER FEWER BUTTONS AND FUNCTIONS SO WE'VE SO WE'VE DISCUSSED 
AND THEN MAYBE FIND A WAY TO INCORPORATE THESE TRENDS SO THAT WE SORT OF CAPTURE PEOPLE'S IMAGINATIONS 
SO MAYBE WE COULD MAKE THE BUTTONS SHAPED LIKE FRUIT AND VEG OR THE THE BUTTONS COULD BE SPONGY UH SOMEHOW 
MAYBE WE COULD MAKE THEM OUT OF RUBBER RATHER THAN SORT OF HARD PLASTIC 
AND THEN SORT OF EVEN WACKIER THAN THAT WE COULD MAYBE HAVE A FRUIT OR VEGETABLE SHAPED REMOTE 
SAY IN THE SHAPE OF A BANANA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
RIGHT SO THAT'LL BE TOO 
MAYBE A BANANA OR COURGETTE OR SOMETHING 
HOW HOW FAR WE ACTUALLY WANT TO GO ALONG AND SORT OF FOLLOW THE TRENDS 
DO WE THINK THE TRENDS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THIS TYPE OF GADGET OR OR YOU KNOW DO THEY NOT MATTER THAT MUCH 
YEAH 
MAYBE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I'M NOT 
YEAH 
I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT WHAT THE SORT OF TIMESCALE WE'RE THINKING OF SELLING THE PRODUCT OVER SO 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S POSSIBLY IT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN IT'S PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THE LIKE THEY WANT THE FANCY LOOKING THING BUT I'M 
YEAH 
I'M NOT CONVINCED ON WHETHER HAVING CHANGEABLE COVERS WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WOULD BUY INTO 
I THINK WITH THE MOBILES 
IT'S THE YOU KNOW IT'S A COMMUNICATION DEVICE PEOPLE SO YOU WITH IT ALL ABOUT AND 
I IF IT 
YEAH 
I THINK 
MM-HMM 
WELL IT WAS DIFFERENT LAST YEAR 
THE TREND WAS DIFFERENT LAST YEAR APPARENTLY 
IT WAS NOT NOT SPONGY FEEL 
BUT 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE TREND WILL CHANGE 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT 
LIKE SORT OF HAVING ALL FRUIT SHAPED KEYS THAT THAT PROBABLY WOULD GO OUT OF FASHION VERY QUICKLY 
WHEREAS JUST THE FACT THAT IT WAS A RUBBER CASE IS PROBABLY LESS LESS OF SOMETHING THAT 
Y YOU'RE GONNA END UP HATING IN A YEAR YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
WHEN YOU SAY D WHEN YOU SAY DOUBLE CURVED WHAT WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN 
OKAY 
NO YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED TO ME ANYMORE 
THAT SHOULD COME UP 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO WORK OUT 
SHALL WE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH I THINK THAT THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
RUBBER 
RUBBER BUTTONS AND CASE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
AND THEN ARE WE GOING FOR SORT OF ONE BUTTON SHAPED LIKE A FRUIT 
OR VEG 
DON'T KNOW MAYBE JUST 
YEAH 
THAT'S OR RUBBER BUTTONS YEAH 
YEAH 
REASONABLY SPONGY I GUESS YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
PEOPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
PEOPLE PEOPLE A A Q QUITE A BIG ONE AS WELL 
A BIG APPLE 
OH 
COULD BE A RED APPLE YEAH 
EITHER DON'T MIND 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
LOOKS LIKE IT 
WELL WE'VE MADE OUR PROTOTYPE ANYWAY 
WE CAN HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT THAT 
MM-HMM 
Y NO IT'S A SLIGHTLY CURVED AROUND THE SIDES 
UM IT'S ALMOST CURVED LIKE UP TO THE MENU DISPLAY AS WELL 
AND THE LITTLE LINE AT THE BOTTOM INDICATES THE ABOUT THE PANEL THAT YOU PULL DOWN 
AND THE EXTRA FUNCTION BUTTONS ARE BELOW THAT PANEL ON THE LITTLE LINE 
AND WE'VE GOT THE STICK ON THE BUTTON WITH THE COMPANY LOGO ON 
YEAH IT'S A BIT MORE FUN ISN'T IT 
AND IT'S KINDA NOT REALLY IT A KIND OF YOU THINK PEOPLE YOU THINK COMPUTERS LIKE APPLE MAC 
YEAH AND CHERRIES ARE FUN SUMMERY 
OH THAT'S THE MUTE 
IT IT'D PROBABLY HAVE TO BE LABELLED MUTE 
BUT UM WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING SMALL ENOUGH TO WRITE 
YEAH 
UH WE JUST CHOSE SIMPLE SHAPES FOR ALL THEM 
UM THE IMPORTANT ONES ARE THE VOLUME ONES 
SO WE MADE THEM A BIT BIGGER 
THE MUTE COULD POSSIBLY BE A BIT SMALLER 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AND WE CHOOSE A V. PLUS AND V. MINUS 
WELL THE COLOURS WOULDN'T LIKE THAT'S THEY WOULDN'T BE TOO IMPORTANT BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY WHITE PLAY DOH 
SO THAT'S WHERE THE COLOUR BUTTONS CAME FROM 
OH THAT'S IT 
MAYBE IF YOU JUST MINIMISE THAT IN IN THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE LITTLE BOX 
YEAH 
SO 
UM 
DO WOULDN'T YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE SIMPLE CHIP THERE AS WELL 
YOU KNOW HOW YOU TURN THAT IN IT A ZERO WOULDN'T THE CHIP AND THE SAMPLE SPEAKER BE SEPARATE THINGS AS YOU NEED BOTH OF THEM 
I THINK THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
BUT I DO THINK UH THE V UH VOICE RECOGNITION THING WOULD BE MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THE FACT THAT IT'S GOT ONE BATTERY 
YEAH I'D MAYBE GIVE IT A 
A TWO 
ONE'S TRUE 
AND A FOUR IS NEUTRAL 
YEAH 'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT THE DOUBLE CURVE SO WE CAN'T LIKE SAY IT'S COMPLETELY TRUE 
BUT IT'S PRETTY CLOSE 
WE'VE GOT ALMOST EVERYTHING WE CAN 
YEAH 
YEAH I SUPPOSE THAT MIGHT BE IN THE TECHNICAL INNOVATION BIT 
MAYBE A THREE 
I WOULD GIVE IT MORE THAN A FOUR 
HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE WOULD TO MAKE IF WE MADE THE CASE IN PLASTIC 
BECAUSE WE DID SAY THAT WE DON'T WANNA FOLLOW THE FASHION TOO MUCH 
OF THE BUTTONS OR RUBBER THAT MIGHT BE SPONGY ENOUGH 
AND THEN IT STAND THE TEST OF TIME BETTER 
MM-HMM 
WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S RUBBER IS IT IS ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
YEAH TWO OR THREE 
I'D BE HAPPY WITH A TWO 
YEAH 
YEAH I WOULD SAY SO AS WELL 
YEAH IT'S GOT THE CHERRY AND THE SPONGINESS 
MAYBE TWO 
YEAH THAT'S A BIT ROUGH AT THE AMOUNT 
UH WELL IT'S GOT THE SAME UM SPEECH FEATURE IS THE COFFEE MACHINE 
YEAH TWO OR THREE 
WELL THE LOGO WOULD BE MORE UM RECOGNISABLE IN THE ACTUAL THING 
IT'S JUST THAT THE PEN WOULDN'T REALLY WRITE ON THAT PAPER 
BUT UM 
I THINK THE LOGO WOULD DEFINITELY BE RECOGNISABLE 
AND IT DOES HAVE ATTRIBUTES THAT THEIR PRODUCTS DO 
TWO 
YOU 
GO FOR IT 
WHAT DOES WHAT DO ALL THEM NUMBERS MEAN THEN 
DO WE ADD THEM UP AND RATE OR ANYTHING 
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO RE RATE IT 
UH IT'S ONE 
YEAH I THINK THAT'D BE FINE 
BECAUSE THAT WAS JUST A TREND AND WE DO HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS ANYWAY 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK WE SHOULD JUST IMAGINE WHITE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
YEAH THE VOLUME ONES SHOULD STAND OUT A BIT 
REAL REACTIONS 
YEAH I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD MAKE IT ANY MORE 
UM APART FROM MAYBE 
DOING THE WHOLE THING IN THE KINDA LIGHT SHADE OF BLUE LIKE THE CASING 
BUT THEN WHAT COLOUR WOULD YOU MAKE THE R. S 
NO I JUST WE GET THE LOGO OFF THE WEB BROWSER 
MM-HMM 
UM I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD REALLY NEED TO BE 
I THINK IF THEY WERE JUST ALL SMALL ROUND BLUE BUTTONS IT'D BE FINE 
NEEDS TO BE AN ENTER BUTTON BUT COULD JUST BE THE SAME AS WELL 
MM-HMM 
SHOULDN'T WE MAYBE ALSO A POINT IN FASHION GO TO A THREE 
'CAUSE WE'VE LOST THE OVERALL SPONGY FEEL 
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT THAT IT JUST HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL 
ALRIGHT 
DID WE DECIDE WHAT THAT WAS WHICH BUTTON IT WAS 
IN THE VOLUME ONES 
RIGHT 
UM CAN I JUST CHECK IF THAT'S A CHERRY OR AN APPLE 
DID WE DECIDE AGAINST THE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF APPLE MAC 
AND DID WE MAKE IT A CHERRY OFFICIALLY 
RIGHT 
SO WERE WE AIMING FOR A CERTAIN TARGET ON THAT SCALE 
RIGHT 
SO DO WE HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DISCUSS 
HUH 
YEAH 
I THINK IT MAYBE COULD HAVE BEEN A SLIGHTLY MORE CREATIVE PROJECT 
I MEAN A REMOTE CONTROL ISN'T THE MOST UM 
KIND OF FANCY THING THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE DESIGNING 
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER EXAMPLE AT THE AMOUNT 
WELL IT'S A DIFFERENT APPLICATION OF IT 
YEAH 
WELL LEADERSHIP'S A BIT OF A FUNNY ONE ISN'T IT 
BUT WE CAN'T REALLY ALL FAIRLY COMMENT ON LEADERSHIP BECAUSE YOU ARE THE PROJECT MANAGER 
YOU WERE THE OLDER 
SO OUR EXPERIENCE OF LEADERSHIP WASN'T REALLY 
SO MUCH AS YOURS 
YEAH VERY NICE 
BUT I MEAN I D I DON'T I'M NOT SURE I SEE THE VALUE IN THIS 
I MEAN THEY RECORD WHAT YOU'RE WRITING AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT 
WHERE DO YOU GET THE RECORDING 
DO YOU PLUG THE COMPUTER OR SOMETHING 
RIGHT 
I THINK YOU WATCH A VIDEO OF IT KIND OF 
VOICE UM RECOGNITION THING 
PRETTY MUCH 
SO SO WHY NOT SAVE THAT 
DO YOU WANT TO REPLACE EXISTING FILE ONE 
I ACTUALLY TRIED TO TRANSFER IT TO MY DOCUMENTS BUT 
SPREADSHEET 
YEAH BUT I'VE TO UH RIGHT I'LL JUST OR DO IT 
THAT'S THE EASIEST WAY 
RIGHT 
OR RIGHT 
UM ALL THESE THINGS HAVE COST IMPLICATIONS 
AND SO WHEN I DON MY THING ON COST A I HAD ASSUMED THAT THE ONLY UH BUTTON THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT COLOUR WOULD BE THE UH THE RED APPLE BUTTON 
SO HOWEVER I'VE NOW 
BUT UM YEAH SO UH BUT THERE WOULD BE A COST IMPLICATION ON THAT 
AND UH SO I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHETHER WANTED TO PUT IN ALL THESE COLOURS WOULD BE UH OPEN TO DEBATE I SUPPOSE 
AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION 
RIGHT OKAY SO UM 
AND THE SECOND ONE UNDERNEATH WOULD BE THE IDEA FOR THE 
RIGHT OKAY 
SO WE'VE GOT UM DETAIL DESIGN MEETING 
RIGHT 
SO SO WE'VE GOT 
PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION WHICH WE'VE JUST DONE EVALUATION CRITERIA UM AND FINANCE 
SO I GUESS WE WE HAVE TO EVALUATE IF THAT MEETS THE VARIOUS UH ASPECTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR UH FROM UM OUR PREVIOUS MEETING 
SO OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SECOND LAYER BUT UM OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD 
BUT OTHER THAN THAT WE GET THE RED APPLE 
WE GET THE BUTTONS AND THE ONLY THING THAT HAS REALLY CHANGED IS THE USE THE COLOURATION OF THE BUTTONS 
AND THE BUT AFTER THE EVALUATION CRITERIA IS UH IS THE FINANCE 
AND THE AND THE COST IMPLICATION 
THE ONLY SNAG ABOUT THIS IS THAT UH 
THE COST IS PROBABLY KIND OF IMPORTANT 
SO UM AND THEN THE PRODUCTION EVALUATION IS IT HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE TO UH TO MANUFACTURE 
UM 
AND WHETHER IT WOULD UH 
RIGHT 
SO UH AS FAR AS THE THE FINANCE OF IT WOULD BE CONCERN WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COST YOU THE PRODUCTION COST 'CAUSE YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST UH CONSIDERATIONS WAS TO BE AN IDEA UNDER UM UH TWELVE FIFTY OR TWO AND A HALF UH TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS 
SO THERE'S NO REDESIGN 
SO THAT SHOULD UH RIGHT SO SEEMS TO ME THAT THE THING THAT I HAVE TO DO IS 
SO QUICKLY FIND THAT UH 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
OKAY SO BY THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT UH THE SIMPLE CHIP AND THE UH KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE WE'VE GOT A SINGLE CURVED 
CASE 
WE'VE GOT A RUBBER UH CASE MATERIALS SUPPLEMENTS 
SO WE HAD DECIDED THAT WE'RE HAVING RUBBER BUTTONS AND 
OKAY 
W THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS 
WELL ORIGINALLY I THOUGHT THERE WOULD JUST BE UH IN IN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS THE IN RED APPLE 
BUT IS THE USE THE REAL W THE REAL QUESTION THEN WOULD COME ON 
DO YOU MAKE ALL THE BUTTONS 
O 
WELL SO WE'VE GOT ONE SPECIAL BUTTON FORM WHICH WAS THE PEOPLE 
EVERYTHING ELSE IS GONNA BE A STANDARD 
WE'VE GOT SPECIAL MATERIAL RUBBER WOOD TITANIUM ET CETERA AND THAT SO I WAS ORIGINALLY 
I WAS THINKING RUBBER WASN'T SPECIAL BUT ACCORDING TO THIS MAYBE IT IS 
SO 
AND THE OR I MEAN EFFECTIVELY WE'VE GOT SIXTEEN BUTTONS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE IN THERE 
W I DON'T KNOW IS IS IS THE SORT OF ANSWER IS THAT MEANT TO BE ALL SIXTEEN BUTTONS AND THEREFORE I MEAN 
WHAT'S THE P THE OPTION WAS MAYBE NOT TO HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS BUT JUST TO HAVE THE ON THAT WAS SOFT AND SPONGY AND THEREFORE 
WHEREAS IT WOULD BE THE SPECIAL COLOUR WOULD BE FOR THE SO YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE THE ONE SPECIAL BUTTON THAT WAS RUBBER 
WHEREAS THE REST WOULD BE HARD PLASTIC 
MM 
I WOULD EVERY DESIGN CHANGE IS UH I DUNNO UM OKAY UM 
IF WE JUST HAD ALL THE BUTTONS AS STANDARD EXCEPT FOR THE IN RED APPLE THEN THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT I GUESS 
WE'D HAVE ONE SPECIAL COLOUR AND ONE SPECIAL BUTTON FORM 
AND WHEN 
I PLUGGED THAT IN LAST TIME REMEMBER IT HAS TO BE UNDER TWELVE AND A HALF 
SO FAR AS I KNOW THAT UM THAT TAKE CARE OF THE UH OF THE VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS 
AND OF WHAT HAPPENED 
NOW RIGHT 
OKAY SO BUT THE POINT WOULD BE THAT IF WE UH 
IF WE JUST DID SPECIAL SORRY YOU WERE SAYING THAT IT WOULD BE THAT IN THAT YOU WOULD PUT IN IN THERE 
OKAY 
SO IT WILL USE IT IS IS NO IT'S NINE POINT SEVEN I'VE GOT 
OKAY 
SO THAT WOULD 
THAT WOULD WORK OUT FINE OF UH 
UH AS ASSUMING YOUR CORRECTION OR ARE ASSUMING THAT THAT ONE CHANGE COVERS ALL THE BUTTONS THAN THAT WOULD BE FINE 
AND THERE'S NOTHING ELSE AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THAT WE WE HAD UH PLANNED TO PUT IN 
UH-HUH 
WELL HOLD ON 
UM IF WE 
OKAY THAT GIVES US TWELVE POINT SEVEN 
BUT REMEMBER THAT THE IDEA WAS TO KEEP IT THE COLOUR OF THE UH I IS IS JUST TAKE OUT THE SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE PEOPLE AND 
AND GO FOR BATTERY INSTEAD 
THAT WOULD GIVE YOU ONE LESS 
BUT YOU RECKON THAT I I MEAN THE THING IS THAT YOU WANTED TO A APPEAL TO APPEAL AND NOT HAVE TO REPLACE BATTERIES 
MM-HMM 
BUT WHICH DO YOU THINK OUR WHICH DO WE THINK SO THE MORE IMPORTANT OF THE OPTIONS 
IN A SENSE AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT A TOTAL WHICH WE NEED TO REDUCE DOWN BY ONE POINT TWO 
AT LEAST 
REMEMBER THAT WAS A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT 
THE OTHER OPTION IF WE'RE PLANNING ON JUST GOING FOR SOMETHING CHEAP AND CHEERFUL WOULD BE TO M MAKE IT ORIGINALLY WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT A SIMPLE PRODUCT 
MM-HMM 
MAKES SENSE 
SORRY DO YOU WANT THAT BACK UP 
RIGHT 
OKAY BUT REMEMBER THE MAIN THE ONLY REASON WE WERE PLANNING ON HAVING THE VOICE RECOGNITION WAS IS THAT THEY COULD FIND THE REMOTE IF IT GET LOST 
GO FOR ONE 
YEP 
OKAY 
YEAH WHY NOT NOT M M MAYBE NEARER THREE 
TWO THREE 
WELL IT'S JUST THAT UH SAYING SOMETHING REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN WE'VE GOT SOLAR POWER 
WE'VE GOT UH VARIOUS OTHER THINGS YOU COULD HAVE AND WE'RE NOT GOING FOR THESE OPTIONS 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
NO 
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT WE WE TAKE THAT IT IT 
DIDN'T YOU 
OR 
WELL WAIT A MINUTE 
NO THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN WE DO HAVE KINETIC 
THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE TO REDUCE DOWN FROM THERE TO GET IT DOWN TO TWELVE POINT FIVE 
AND ONE WAY OF DOING THAT WOULD BE TO TAKE OUT THE KINETIC 
SO IT'S VERY MUCH DEPENDANT ON WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR OPTIONS 
AND IF YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING FOR THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER 
THEN BECAUSE THAT THE OTHER FUNCTIONS WE'VE GOT ONE OR OR MORE AT THE THE SPECIAL MATERIAL THE RUBBER WOOD TITANIUM ET CETERA 
IF YOU GO FOR THAT TH THAT'S AT THE HIGH END 'CAUSE THAT'S POINT SIX WHEREAS DOWN TO UH JUST SPECIAL COLOURS UH IS POINT TWO 
NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO LOSE ONE POINT TWO IS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU'RE GOING FOR THE SAMPLE SENSORS SPEAKER 
YOU'RE BASICALLY THAN HAVING TO GO FOR THE CHEAPER OPTIONS ON EVERYTHING ELSE 
AND AND THE SIMPLE WAY TO DO IT WOULD BE TO HAVE A BATTERY TO HAVE YOUR UH SAMPLE SENSOR SPEAKER 
AND THEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT UH TAKE IT UH POINT TWO WHICH WOULD BE COME FROM THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS CATEGORY 
UM INTERFACE TYPE UM WELL PLASTIC RATHER THAN RUBBER 
THAT THAT THAT WOULD MAKE THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE 
YOU COULD EITHER YOU COULD HAVE TO IF YOU HAVE A IN PLASTIC RATHER THAN RUBBER THAN THAT WOULD UH ENABLE YOU TO GET YOU COULD KEEP KINETIC THEN 
YOU COULD KEEP YOUR SAMPLE SENSOR AND YOU'D BE LOOKING TO TAKE TO POINT TWO 
SO YOU COULD UH FIDDLE THAT DOWN YOUR SPECIAL FORM AT THE BOTTOM OR YOUR SPECIAL COLOUR AT THE BOTTOM 
AND THAT WOULD ENABLE YOU TO TO DO IT 
YEAH 
YOU 
WELL OKAY BUT 
IT'S RUBBER IS IT IS YES 
WE GOT WE'VE WE'VE GOT THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN AND WE'VE GOT IT IN AT THE MOMENT AND IF AND BASICALLY WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE DOWN FROM THAT 
BUT THE CURRENT ONE YOU'D SAY WOULD BE FANCY WOULD BE TOO 
MM-HMM 
I WOULD'VE SAID ABOUT A TWO AS WELL 
OH 
THE NEXT ONE WELL I CAN JUST USING BUT 
EASY TO USE 
I WOULD'VE SAID YES 
I WOULD GO FOR A ONE ON THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME 
UM INCORPORATES ELEMENTS OF FASHION TO ATTRACT BUYER 
WELL YEAH IT CERTAINLY HAS SOME 
YEP 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEP 
YEAH I WOULDA SAID TWO WOULD SEEM REASONABLE 
THE PRODUCT AS A RECOGNISABLE REAL 
OR UH REACTION PRODUCT 
OH 
SO 
OKAY 
SO WE'RE GOING FOR A 
TWO THREE 
SURE 
RIGHT OKAY 
TWO 
RIGHT COME ON 
THAT'S THAT DECIDED 
RIGHT 
SO 
SO WE'RE NOW ON IT CHANGING IT TO GET TO TO FIT IN WITH THE BUDGET REQUIREMENTS AND THEN 
BUT A TWO 
TWO 
YEP 
TWO B TWO B TWO YEAH 
YES 
WELL YOU CAN ALSO ONE POINT TWO AND STILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS 
OKAY WELL I PUT IT BACK IN 
YES I WOULD'VE THOUGHT SO 
OKAY SO WHAT WAS TO CONTROL UH F. EIGHT WASN'T IT 
OH 
OH 
HOW KINDA 
RIGHT OKAY 
SO YOU CAN SEE THERE THAT THE IF YOU WANT TO KEEP KINETIC RIGHT 
YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE EITHER OF GOING DOWN TO BATTERY WHICH WOULD SAVE YOU ONE 
YOU'VE GOT 
THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND AND SAMPLE SPEAKER WHICH IS YOUR BIG ITEM 
THAT'S RIGHT 
WHICH GETS YOU 
YES 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY SO 
SO WE'RE GOING FOR PLASTIC YES 
YEP 
WELL UH WE UH THERE WAS DEBATE AS TO HOW YOU WOULD COUNT THEM 
YOU GOT SPECIAL COLOUR 
WELL ORIGINALLY I WAS ASSUMING WE HAD THE RED APPLE AND THEREFORE THAT WAS THE SPECIAL COLOUR 
WELL WE'VE GOT SPECIAL FORM 
NOW THAT WOULD BE ONE BUTTON AND THE QUESTION WAS WAS THAT ALL BUTTONS OR IS THAT JUST ONE BUTTON 
'CAUSE OUR PLAN REALLY WAS TO HAVE ONE BUTTON ONLY WITH A SPECIAL IS IS NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SAME 
THE OTHER THING WOULD THEN BE SPECIAL MATERIAL RUBBER WOOD TITANIUM 
ALRIGHT 
SO SPECIAL COLOUR YOU WANT THERE IN THERE 
OKAY 
THAT MAKES SENSE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT I THINK 
SO SPECIAL COLOURS TWO 
AND WE'VE GOT SPECIAL FORM IS THE AN APPLE 
THE REST ARE ALL STANDARD ALTHOUGH YOU COULD ARGUE THAT SHOULD MAYBE BE YOU WERE MAKING THESE BUTTONS DOWN THE BOTTOM 
I WAS PRESUMING BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES ARE WERE YOU 
WAS THAT THE IDEA 
UH-HUH 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT OUR WELL 
RIGHT 
YEP THAT MAKES SENSE 
YEP 
I WOULDA SAID SO 
YEAH 
SO YOU'D MAYBE PUT FASH FAN UH FASHION OUT THERE RATHER THAN TWO 
REAL REACTION PRODU I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
YEP I WOULD USE 
YOU MEAN IF 
WELL YOU COULD ARGUE YOU MIGHT DO IT ONCE A YEAR YOU WOULD CHANGE BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE MAKING A RED APPLE 
SO NEXT YEAR YOU COULD MAKE NEXT YEAR'S MODEL THE SAME BUT HAVE TO USE A A YEAH WHATE WHATEVER A LEMON 
YEAH L A LEMON LEMON OR SOMETHING 
AND THAT 
AMOUNT 
YEAH WE'VE THE MAIN THING WE'VE CHANGED REALLY SEE THE CASING ISN'T IT 
WE'VE 
WELL AS HAS CERTAINLY STAYED 
YEAH 
AND THE SPEECH FEATURE 
HOW IT WOULD PLAY IT YEAH 
OH 
WELL BUT YOU'VE GOT THE COMPANY LOGO IN THERE WHICH WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE A STICK ON BADGE 
SO YOU'RE IN A SENSE YOU'RE COMPARING THE PRODUCT WITHOUT THE COMPANY LOGO 
AND THEN YOU BUT YOU'VE GOT THE SPACE FOR IT TO STICK TO ONE 
DON'T THINK SO 
BUT BUT I BUT IN THE SENSE THAT AS YOU SAW WITH UM THE WINDOWS LOGO BADGE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
THERE'S VIRTUALLY N THE WAY THAT YOU FROM YOU KNOW THE WINDOWS BADGE ON THERE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COLOUR TO USE 
AS LONG AS OUR COMPANY'S LOGO IS FRAMED W IN THE SAME WAY IS THAT WITH A LIKE A BLACK OUTLINE 
FACT THEY'VE GOT BLACK AND WHITE OR BLACK AND SILVER 
SO BASICALLY EVEN IF YOU HAD A SILVER THE SAME COLOUR OF SILVER ON YOUR DISPLAY 
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT EFFECTIVELY A DOUBLE EDGING ON THE UH IN THE LOGO IT MEANS THAT IT SPLITS OFF WHAT YOUR LOGO IS FROM THE FROM THE PRODUCT 
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A SNEAKY WAY OF DOING IT 
YOU COULD PUT IN ANOTHER WELL IN THIS ONE YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT THREE COLOURS OF BUTTONS 
WELL WE DECIDED THAT THE BLUE ONES WERE THE UM THE STANDARD COLOUR 
SO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT UH UM WE'RE ASSUMING THAT ALL THE BUTTONS ON THE SECOND PANEL THE HIDDEN AWAY PANEL WOULD ALL BE STANDARD 
WHICH 
UM MY OR MAY NOT BE THE CASE 
WELL YEAH 
BU BUT BUT HE WAS THE WAS THERE NOT A BUTTON THAT YOU WERE THINKING OF IN THE UM IN THE OTHER OPT YOU KNOW 
IN THE SECOND PAGE IS IT WERE THAT UH YOU WERE THINKING OF MAYBE HAVING AS A DIFFERENT COLOUR 
YEAH WELL 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
SO WE JUST ADD THAT TO PROFITABILITY IN EFFECT 
RIGHT SO WE'RE MEANT TO FINISH UP IN FIVE MINUTES 
MM-HMM 
SO WE'RE OKAY THIS WAY AROUND 
UNTIL THE DESIGN TEAM COMES IN AND SAYS GET OFF 
BUT YOU ARE THE DESIGN TEAM 
SO WHAT ABOUT ARE WE ON IT 
YEAH 
I TH I TH UH 
RIGHT OKAY 
OH DRATS I'VE BOTCHED THAT HAVEN'T I 
RIGHT OKAY UM 
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE 
RIGHT OKAY UM 
MM 
RIGHT OKAY UM RIGHT 
SO WE GOT 
SO WE'VE DONE THE 
THE FINANCE BIT AND THE EXCEL PROJECT AND THE WE'VE DONE THE REDESIGN 
SO WE'RE NOW ON IT PROJECT PROCESS 
NOW SATISFACTION WITH FOR EXAMPLE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY LEADERSHIP TEAMWORK MEANS ET CETERA WHITEBOARD DIGITAL PENS ET CETERA 
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY NOW UH IN A SENSE 
NO AT THE EVALUATION OF THE COURSE RATHER THAN THE EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT IS M MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT 
SO WHAT DID YOU AND REMEMBERING THAT NOBODY'S JUST OVER THE CURTAIN 
SO UM 
SO 
I SUPPOSE THE EASIEST WAY OF DOING IT IS TO PUT SOME NOTES DOWN WHICH I WILL DO 
SO UH I THINK I HAVE TO FINISH THAT PAGE 
RIGHT OKAY SO 
PROJECT EVALUATION 
SO UM 
CREATIVITY 
DID YOU FEEL YOU GOT A CHANCE TO EXPRESS YOURSELVES WELL ENOUGH 
WELL UM 
INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS 
HOW DO YOU MEAN 
NO YOU IN YOUR OWN 
UM 
MM THE ONLY THING YOU FOUND IS IN A MANUFACTURING PROCESS 
YOU WOULD NORMALLY YOU GO TO A MEETING YOU DECIDE RIGHT YOU DO THIS YOU DO THAT YOU DO THAT 
THEN YOU GO AWAY 
YOU FIND OUT INFORMATION 
YOU THEN COME BACK 
YOU THEN DISCUSS IT 
YOU THEN GO AND CHANGE THINGS AROUND AND THEN GO BACK 
SO 
WHEREAS THIS TIME YOU'RE REALLY GETTING IT FROM A DATABASE SOURCE IS IT'S NOT UH WELL UH ANYWAY 
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO PUT DOWN 
I'VE PUT SEEMED OKAY 
CREATIVITY SEEMED OKAY 
UM UM FLOW OF INFORMATION IN IN ANY GIVEN SUBJECT GIVEN SUBJECT UM SOMETIMES DISJOINTED 
UM 
HAVE COULD HAVE USED A DIFFERENT 
EXAMPLE PEL TO INCREASE CREATE 
CREATIVITY 
YOU HAVE TO DO IT WITHIN A SET TIME FRAME IS THE OTHER THING IS 
I TH I UH DO 
BUT THE OTHER THING IS THAT UH THEY'RE I'M GUESSING THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO USE THIS UM SOFTWARE TO TO DEMONSTRATE HOW YOU COULD UH DO A PROJECT 
I MEAN M MY WIFE AT THE MOMENT FOR INSTANCE IS UH ACTING AS A COMPUTER UM FOR UM YOU NORMALLY 
YOU GOT A PROBLEM IS YOU GO TO YOUR TUTOR AND FIND OUT INFORMATION TO SEE HOW TO GET IT FIXED 
SO WHAT SHE'S DOING IS SHE'S HAVING TO SPEND A DAY TO THE COMPUTER TERMINAL AT ONE AND SO THAT ANY STUDENT THAT COMES ALONG CAN UH ASK WHATEVER QUESTION 
AND THEN YOU ARE THE IDEA IS THAT THE WHICHEVER UH PERSON'S AT THE OTHER AND CAN POINT THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
SHOW THEM WHERE TO EITHER GIVE THEM DIRECTLY GIVE THEM HELP OR SECONDLY POINT THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
THERE AT THE LIBRARY OR UH OR OR COME BACK OR GO AND SEE JOE BLOGGS OR WHATEVER 
SO UH AND THAT WAS A PROJECT I SUSPECT SIMILAR TO THIS 
BECAUSE THEY THEY WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO DEBUG THE UH COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO ENABLE UM TO ENABLE IT TO WORK 
AND OF COURSE YOU HAD THE MACHINE CRASHING AND VARIOUS THINGS GOING WRONG 
SO 
ALRIGHT SO WE'VE GOT UH 
NEW IDEAS FOUND DID WE FOUND ANY NO 
ALRIGHT 
LEADERSHIP TEAMWORK 
DOES 
YOU'VE GOT VOICE RECOGNITION COMPUTERS THAT'S NOT REMOTE CONTROLS 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO HOW DO YOU RECKON TEAMWORK WENT 
IT UH G UH REASONABLY WELL 
OKAY 
BUT BUT ARBITRARY 
MM-HMM 
SO WE'RE UM WE'RE MEANT TO COMMENT ON LEADERSHIP AND THE MEANS E. G. WHITEBOARD DIGITAL PENS ET CETERA 
AND AND NOW I NEW IDEAS FOUND WAS THE THE OTHER THING 
NOW I'D MUCH RATHER BE IN MARKETING BUT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET THIS UH COMPUTER TO WORK AS WELL SO I WOULD HAVE LIKED 
HOWEVER UM ALRIGHT UH MEANS IS WHITEBOARD UM IS REALLY IT'S UH EQUIPMENT 
OH 
RIGHT 
NEW IDEAS FOUND IS ONE OR TWO 
UM 
AND UH 
VOICE 
HE WAS IT VOICE ACTIVATED UM 
RECOGNITION 
RIGHT SO UH ARE THE COSTS WITHIN BUDGET YES 
SO THE PROJECT EVALUATED YES 
UH DON'T FORGET TO COMPLETE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY 
THEN CELEBRATION 
YEAH 
UH SO WE DON'T OR IS REALLY 
I TRIED TO SAVE THIS THE LAST TIME TO TWELVE POINT THREE AND IT DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE SAVED ANYWHERE 
MIND YOU THE THE FIGURE LAST WAS WAS DIFFERENT BUT IT SHOULD BE POSS 
WE ALSO HAVE A APPLE SLASH CHERRY DESIGN AT THE TOP 
YEAH YEAH WE MIGHT GET A 
FOR THE M. 
THEY'RE THINKING 
FOR THE FIRST TIME WELL IT WAS HARD TO GET THE UH UM THE ACTUAL LABELLING ON THE INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS 
HUM YOU SEPARATE OFF IN COLOUR THE VOLUME RELATED BUTTONS FROM THE CHANNEL RELATED BUTTONS 
SO YOU'VE GOT THE VOLUME AN ORANGE ONE DESIGN THERE AND THE THE CHANNEL IS IN BLUE 
YEAH SIS 
YES WE'LL HAVE THE SLIDE AWAY 
BOTTOM 
MM-HMM 
YES YES 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
THIS THIS IS A YES THIS IS OUR PRESENTATION OF THE PROTOTYPE 
MM-HMM 
COULD WE GET THIS IN THE BOARD JUST SO WE CAN USE OR DO YOU MEAN DO YOU HAVE THE FIGURES THERE 
'KAY ALICE 
SO SH 
'KAY THIS SHOULD BE THEN 
MM-HMM 
HAVE A PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE 
UM 
UM 
YEAH 
AND THEN WE'D HAVE 
SO THAT'S NINE POINT IN THERE IS WE'VE GOT SOME 
'KAY 
JUST GIVE US A BIT OF 
I SWITCHING AROUND THIS THE UM IN THE ELECTRONICS WE GET THE SAMPLE SENSOR 
AT THE MOMENT WE'VE JUST GET THE SIMPLE CHIP WHICH COSTS ONE 
UM I GUESS THE SAMPLE SENS SAMPLE SPEAKER WOULD BE THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING WHICH PUTS UP TO FOUR 
WE SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY OVER OUR BUDGET BUT IF WE GATHER SOMETHING ELSE DOWN TO SLIGHTLY LOWER STANDARD 
AND MAYBE GO WITH THE ON THE SPECIAL FORM BUTTONS THEN WE COULD HAVE THE SPEECH 
SO UH MAYBE IF WE GET RID OF LIKE THE MAYBE ONE OF THE SPECIAL COLOURS 
KEPT THEM ALL THE SAME COLOUR THEN WE COULD HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION WITHOUT 
YEAH YEAH 
UM 
UH POSSIBLY YEAH YEAH MAYBE 
MAYBE UM WE'D BE GIVING UP ON THE KINETIC 
UM 
WE SHOULD YEAH THAT WOULD SAVE AS ONE THOUGH WE'D STILL BE SLIGHTLY OV 
YEAH YEAH 
WELL SINCE IT'S THE THROUGH THE WHOLE TECHNOLOGY TYPE THING UM YOU WERE SAYING IN THE MARKET RESEARCH THAT PEOPLE LIKE KIND OF INTERESTING GADGETS IN THEM 
UM WHETHER THEY WOULD FIGURE THE THE S UH SAMPLE SENOR AND THE SAMPLE SPEAKER VOICE RECOGNITION BE SORT OF A WORTHWHILE THING TO HAVE 
AND THEN STILL HAVE THE BATTERIES OR WHATEVER THEY WOULD PREFER NOT UH YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
THE THE PROBLEM WAS THE BATTERY'S RUNNING OUT AND LOSING THE UM LOSING THE REMOTE 
SO YOU GOTTA DECIDE WHICH OF THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THEM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY WELL WE HAVE A SINGLE CURVE WHICH WAS MAYBE LIKE THE FEEL OF THE PRODUCT'S QUITE GOOD 
SO UH 
UM THEN WE HAVE THE RUBBER KINDA SPONGY FEEL WHICH WAS IN AT THE TIME 
UM SORRY THAT'D BE CONSIDERED FANCY 
SO MAYBE MAYBE A TWO 
YEAH 
UM DECIDING BETWEEN THE KINETIC POWER OR UM THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
AND IF WE HAD THREE OF THIS FOR OUR BUDGET THEY BOTH SHOW A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF SPEECH RECOGNITION 
UM 
BUT NOT THE KINETIC 
LIKE THE POWER 
NO WE C C YEAH WE CAN'T AFFORD BOTH 
IN MY SO MAYBE ABOUT NEUTRAL PLUS IT IT IT'S GOT SOMETHING ABOUT IT HASN'T GOT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
'KAY 
OKAY 
UM 
MM-HMM 
SO IT SAYS IF WE MAKE A SLIGHTLY MORE FANCY THEN WE LOSE POINTS INNOVATION 
AND IF WE MAKE IT MORE INNOVATIVE INNOVATIVE THEN WE LOSE POINTS ON IT BEING FANCY SO 
YEAH YEAH 
UM 
IT DOES YEAH 
YEAH M M YEAH IT WAS JUST DOING IT QUITE WELL 
UM I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOSE SOME OF THIS BUT THE MOMENT IS IT STANDS IT'S UM 
UH THE SENSOR USING ALL OF ITS ALL OF ITS PRODUCTS ALL OF ITS BUTTONS AND IT'S GOT A FAIRLY BIG LABEL ON THE BOTTOM SAYING 
WHERE IT COMES FROM 
OKAY 
ALSO IT'S KIND OF SPONGY RUBBERINESS IS MAYBE BIT MORE KINDA COMFORTABLE THAN KINDA SLEEK AND NOW GO 
UM IT DEPENDS WHICH WAY YOU LOOK AT IT 
MAYBE A KIND OF THREE 
UH DO 
YEAH SO IT'S 
SO SHOULD WE GOT IS OUR DEFINITE WAS IT THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN WAS THE DEFINITE PRICE RULE IF HAS 
OKAY SO WE NEED TO 
SO I GUESS THIS IS THIS THE LAST STAGE ONCE WE SORT OUT THE FINANCES PART OF IT 
YEAH YEAH WE'LL MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS AND THEN IS HOW ARE RATES ARE GOING 
OH ACTUALLY WE JUST HAVE A PLASTIC CASE THEN WE ALSO TWO POINTS WHICH GETS SO UM 
NO RIGHT WITHIN THE BUDGET RANGE 
SO THAT'S ELEVEN POINT SEVEN AND THEN WE COULD MAKE SURE WE DEFINITELY HAD ALL THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS 
POSSIBLY YEAH 
UM 
AND THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE ALL THE TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS 
SO WE'D ALSO A LITTLE BIT ON THE MAYBE KIND OF 
OH YEAH AND THAT WOULD NOW B YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WITHIN THE BUDGET 
UM 
DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE DO WE JUST HAVE ONE SPECIAL UH SPECIAL FORMS DOWN HERE 
UM 
AND WE WE'VE WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER WE'VE GOT NOUGHT POINT EIGHT LEFT SO WE'VE GOT ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER 
YEAH UM 
BUT TH BUT BUT BUT THE 
I THINK MAYBE THE SPECIAL COLOUR WE'VE GOT THREE NOW JUST BECAUSE THE VOLUME BUTTONS ARE DIFFERENT 
I GUESS WE'D HAVE THE ONES WHICH ARE ABLE TO THE MOMENT WOULD WOULD JUST BE THE STANDARD COLOUR 
YEAH WHICH I THINK WE SHOULD YEAH THEY'LL STILL BE FUN FOR THE FOR THE PRICE 
OKAY UH THAT'S PROBABLY IT 
NO UH 
MAYBE THAT'LL BE A SECOND SUPPLEMENT 
THEN THERE'S A SP A SECOND SPECIAL FORM 
UM 
WELL YOU GET YOU GET TWELVE 
SO I THINK THAT SHOULD STILL BE OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S TWELVE POINT THREE SO WE'RE STILL 
WITHIN BUDGET ON THAT 
UM 
SO DECIDE WE'VE LOST A LITTLE BIT ON THE FASHION AND LOST A BIT ON THE FANCY KINDA SIDE OF IT 
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING WE'VE KEPT THE OTHER ATTRIBUTES TO THE 
THAT'S WITHOUT 
YEAH 
AND ESPECIALLY IT DEFINITELY COULD FITS THE THE REAL PRODUCT WHAT WAS THE WHAT'S THE COMPANY NAME 
OR YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
I MEAN IT STILL SEEMS DEFINITELY FIT THAT UP SO THAT'S LIKE IF THAT'S THE NEW AGE KIND OF UM INNO INNOVATIVE 
C TYPE COMPANY THEN UM HAVING THE KINETIC FEATURE AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS P QUITE HIGH UP ON 
UM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SO IT'S A 
WHATEVER FRUIT WAS IN FASHION NEXT YEAR 
THAT YEAH THAT WAS UH THAT WAS JUST ABOUT ALL 
I THINK WE'VE SAVED QUITE A BIT BECAUSE WE'VE JUST GET THE PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE WHICH IS BY FOR THE CHEAPEST 
UM 
SO MAYBE IN A SENSE NOT HAVING THAT MAYBE WE'VE LOST SOME MAYBE LOST SOMETHING ON THE INNOVATION SIDE 
I DUNNO 
AND THAT IS LIKE THE MOST STANDARD TYPE OF BUTTON 
YEAH 
AND EVERYTHING ELSE HAS STAYED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS 
YEAH PLEASE IF ANYTHING THAT IS SPECIAL FORMS MAKES IT SLIGHTLY EASIER TO 
IT IS 
UM WELL WE'VE STILL GET THE KINETIC ENERGY 
UM 
YEAH THE SPEECH FEATURE 
I THINK WE'VE CUT JUST ABOUT THE SAME 
WE'VE MAYBE LOST 
HASN'T IT IT'S HARD TO TELL HOW THE RUBBER THE RUBBER CASING WOULD REALLY AFFECT 
UM 
BUT I THINK MORE THE THE FEATURES OF THE ACTUAL CONTROL WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN MAYBE THEN THE THE ACTUAL AESTHETICS BUT 
BUT OTHER WAY I THINK WE'VE MADE OUT FAIRLY CLOSE TO WHAT 
JUST THE THE COMPANY LOGO 
SO MAYBE THERE'S LIKE A SET DESIGN WHICH WE GET PRINTED OFF 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
I'M STILL NOT QUITE SURE WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT 
YEAH 
UM 
YEAH MAYBE WE'VE UM 
MAYBE FOR THE THE ONE THEY'RE GONNA USE ALL THE TIME WE MAKE IT LOOK GOOD AND UM FIT THE KIND OF IDEA OF WHAT THEY WANT 
AND THEN FOR THE MORE FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS 
WE DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT AND JUST HAVE THAT IS LIKE A PLUS IT'S HIDDEN AWAY ANYWAY YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE IT AT THE START 
YEAH 
'KAY 
OH 
THAT'S GOOD 
DEFINITELY LEMON SHAPED 
YOU HAD TO HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS IF YOU HAD THE RUBBER CASE 
SO I THINK WE CAN WE'RE OKAY 
THEN WE SAY IT'S FINE SO IT'S ALL GOOD 
JUST IN CASE WE NEED THAT POINT TWO FOR LAWSUITS AND SUCH LIKE 
AND WE SEEM TO HAVE LOST SOMETHING ON EACH CRITERIA 
WE HAVEN'T COMPLETELY LEFT ANYTHING TO USE 
IS AN OVERALL PRODUCT WHICH HAS TO BE QUITE CHEAP WE'VE JUST ABOUT ACHIEVED 
EVERYTHING

WE SHOULD JUST GO THROUGH THIS QUICKLY AND THEN 
UM YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I SUPPOSE AND THEN BE GOING TO AND FINDING MORE INFORMATION EACH TIME AND THEN DIFF THINGS WILL BE RELEVANT 
SO THIS GO TO KINDA KIS FITS THE PURPOSE THAT IT WAS SOMETHING EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT AND THEN 
SOMETHING WE CAN AT LEAST LIKE IT AND THINK HOW WE CAN IMPROVE ON 
ONE OF THESE THINGS 
LIKE UH COMPANIES CAN HAVE LIKE A RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND 
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS BUT I GUESS THAT SOMETHING GOT SENT TO AND HAVE LIKE A BRIEF TO KIND OF 
YEAH 
WELL SH WE LOOK AT THE LAST SLIDE SEE IF IT'S GOT ANYTHING ELSE 
I THINK THERE'S NO NO MORE TO GO 
IT WAS QUITE GOOD WITH THIS UM THE WHITE BOARD HAVING THAT AND THE DIGITAL PENS 
LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MADE OUT A LITTLE EASIER 
VOICE RECOGNITION ESPECIALLY NOT COULD 
YEAH 
YEAH SO IT'S JUST LIKE THE SAME PRODUCTS BUT JUST PUT TOGETHER ON A DIFFERENT WAY 
UM 
YEAH I GUESS WE ALL HAD SEPARATE IDEAS AND THEN DISCUSSED THEM 
SO IT'S NOT JUST FOR US IT'S FOR THE EXPERIMENT AS A WHOLE SO 
SHOULD WE QUICKLY LOOK AT THE LAST SLIDE 
SH 
SO THAT EVERYTHING 
NO YOU'LL HA HAVE TO OPEN IT UP FROM ELSEWHERE 
YEAH YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THAT WINDOW 
'CAUSE THAT'S THE SAVE ONE ISN'T IT IS 
AND THEN FIND OUT

THAT'S THE PRO 
OKAY 
WE SHOULD PLUG IT IN 
DO YOU WANNA PLU DO YOU WANNA PLUG IT IN INTO THE THE BACK OF THAT ONE 
WE COULD DO IT SO WE DO GO ALONG THE PRODUCTION COSTS LOOKING AT THE PROTOTYPE 
WELL DO WE'LL DO IT IN THE PROTOTYPE SO DO TWO IS HOW MUCH TO USE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I THINK YOU JUST DO IN DON'T YOU FOR THE 
I THINK I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S JUST A ONE 
ALSO 
I TH I THINK I THINK THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENT I IS JUST A SUPPLEMENT FOR ALL THE BUTTONS MADE IN A DIFFERENT MATERIAL RATHER THAN PER BUTTON 
I DON'T KNOW THOUGH 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YOU'VE JUST GONE OFF THE WINDOW INTO ANOTHER ONE

MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WE HAVE TO HAVE TO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SHALL WE SHALL WE EVALUATE THE PROTOTYPE SO WE'VE GOT IT NOW FIRST AND THEN SORT OF MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED AFTER 
OKAY 
RIGHT UM I HAVE A LITTLE THING 
SO WE'VE ALL GOT A NOTE IF IT'S THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN ISN'T IT WITH EVERYTHING WE WANT ONE 
YEAH I JUST HAD A PRESENTATION IT 
DO 
MM-HMM 
MM 
RIGHT OKAY UM 
THIS IS ABOUT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA THAT WE USE FOR THE THE PROTOTYPE WE'VE GOT HERE 
AND SO THE METHOD IS THAT THE DESIGN TEAM MAKES A PROTOTYPE AND WE EVALUATE THE PROTOTYPE AGAINST SOME CRITERIA THAT WE'VE FORMULATED 
AND THESE ONES ARE GONNA BE IN RESPONSE TO SORT OF MARKET RESEARCH AND ALSO FINANCE I GUESS 
AND DO THAT IN A SCALE FROM SAY TRUE BEING ONE AND FALSE BEING SEVEN IS IF IT'S NEITHER TRUE NOR FALSE THEN THAT'S FOR 
SO I GOT A SET OF CRITERIA JUST BASED ON THE MARKETING THAT WE NEED TO ADD IN A FINANCIAL ONE AS WELL AT THE END 
UM SO 
WE HAVE TO SAY WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR FALSE THAT THE PRODUCT LOOKS AND FEELS FANCY 
UM 
THE WHETHER THE PRODUCT DEMONSTRATES TECHNICAL INNOVATION 
WHETHER IT'S EASY TO USE 
WHETHER IT'S INCORPORATING SORT OF THE FASHION ELEMENT TO ATTRACT THE BUYER 
AND WHETHER IT'S A SORT OF RECOGNISABLE REAL REACTION PRODUCT 
AND I HAVE TO GO UP INTO THE WHITEBOARD AND DO THIS APPARENTLY SO I'LL GO OVER HERE 
RIGHT 
SO THE FIRST ONE IS UM DOES THE PRODUCT LOOK AND FEEL FANCY 
SO IF WE DO A SORT OF A ONE 
SO 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IF BUT I THINK WHAT IS ONE FALSE OR IS IT IN TRUE 
I FORGOT 
ONE'S TRUE AND OKAY 
SEVEN'S FAL FOUR IS NEUTRAL OKAY 
SO 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
I GONNA PUT UNDERNEATH SO I'VE GOT SOME MORE SPACE 
IS FALSE IS SEVEN TRUE IS ONE AND 
SO UH SAY ABOUT A TWO FOR FANCY YOU THINK 
OKAY 
OKAY WELL DO YOU DO AN AVERAGE AT THE AND I DON'T KNOW 
UM 
UH-HUH 
THIS THIS IS JUST THIS IS JUST FOR LIKE THE LOOK 
DOES IT SORT OF LOOK FANCY RATHER THAN FUNCTIONAL 
SO 
YEAH SO THAT IS SHE SHOULD WE GO FOR A A TWO ON THAT 
'KAY 
AND I MEAN HOW MUCH DOES THE PRODUCT DEMONSTRATE TECHNICAL INNOVATION DO YOU RECKON 
D YEAH 
OKAY 
SO WHAT ABOUT THE PR THE PROTOTYPE IS IT SO WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION ON IT HAVEN'T WE 
BUT NOT THE KINETIC 
ALRIGHT SO 
SO IT DOESN'T IT'S PRETTY THE PROTOTYPE IS IT IS ISN'T SORT OF UM FULFILLING THE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
RIGHT OKAY 
MM-HMM 
SO 
I'M JUST GONNA CHECK MY EMAIL 
I'M JUST GONNA CHECK EXACTLY WHAT IT SAID IN THE EMAIL FOR ME 
THE PRODUCT 
OKAY 
BUT I 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I JUST READ THE EMAIL AGAIN AND IT SORT OF SAYS IT'S EVALUATE THE DESIGN SORT OF USE IT SO I THINK 
SO I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT FINANCE AFTER WE'VE SORT OF EVALUATED THAT DESIGN 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE'RE DOING IT IN THE WRONG ORDER OR SOMETHING OR 
SO I MEAN DOES THIS AND TO GO UP A BIT OR SOMETHING 'CAUSE WE'VE GOT BOTH THE 
BOTH THE UM 
THE SPEECH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM FOR FOR INNOVATION SO WE'VE GOT THE SPEECH THE SPEECH THING AND 
DO YOU RECKON A TWO 
OKAY 
TWO 
AND THE NEXT ONE SO I'LL HAVE TO GET IT BACK UP NOW 
OKAY 
UM 
SAY ABOUT A THREE MAYBE 
IT'S A TWO 
YEAH THIS IS 
THIS 
YEAH 
SO THIS IS ABOUT SORT OF THE CORPORATE IMAGE OF LIKE NEW SORT OF SLEEK TECHNOLOGY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING 
AS WELL AS HAVING THE LOGO ON AND ALL THAT 
SO SORT OF 
SO IT SORT OF A RECOGNISABLE PRODUCT 
DOES IT FIT IN WITH OUR OTHER OTHER PRODUCTS WHICH UH ARE SORT OF COFFEE MAKERS AND SPACECRAFT 
WHAT DO YOU 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
SO 
TWO OR THREE 
YEAH 
TWO OR THREE 
HOW

OKAY 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH WE S YEAH I THINK WE SORT OF ADD THEM UP IS SORT OF IT ON AVERAGE IS GONNA BE I'M JUST GONNA DO THIS IN MY HEAD 
NO POINT EIGHT ISN'T IT OR SOMETHING 
I THINK ANYWAY 
SO YEAH PRETTY CLOSE TO A TWO 
SO 
SO IT'S I MEAN IT'S PRETTY GOOD AT THE MOMENT BUT IT'S GONNA GET WORSE ISN'T IT 
BUT WE'VE GOTTA TRY AND MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GET TOO BAD 
YEAH 
DO YOU WANNA PLUG IT INTO YOURS AS WE CAN GET UP THE 
THE FINANCES 
I'M NOT SURE 
YEAH 
IT'S COME ON ALREADY 
MM 
YEAH 
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT COLOURS YEAH 
YEAH 
I WAS I WAS THINKING THAT BECAUSE MAYBE MAYBE THE SORT OF RUBBER CASE IS A BIT LESS IN SORT OF THE CORPORATE IDENTITY THAN THE SORT OF YOU KNOW SLEEKER PLASTIC CASE 
ALSO A LITTLE BIT ON THE FASHION YEAH BUT 
AND THEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I THIN I THINK YOU YOU YOU JUST NEED TWO FOR THE SPECIAL COLOUR 'CAUSE IT'S JUST TWO SUPPLEMENTS YOU KNOW 
AN ORIGINAL COLOUR AND THEN SORT OF TWO SUPPLEMENTS I THINK MAYBE 
OKAY 
SO WE ONLY ONE WE ONLY NEED TWO FOR THAT 
'CAUSE I MEAN THESE THESE ARE MOULDED 
THE ONE COLOUR'S GONNA BE MOULDED OUT OF A PIECE OF PLAS UH OF RUBBER ISN'T IT 
RIGHT 
YEAH THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY SO THE 
SO SHALL WE DO A WELL UM 
YEAH 
YEAH SO 
OH 
SO IT'S W IF WE'VE IF WE'VE PUT IN FOR ANOTHER SPECIAL FORM IN A BUTTON THEN MAYBE THEY COULD BE A DIFFERENT SHAPE 
LIKE WE GOT A CHERRY ON 
MAYBE OTHER ONES COULD BE SOMETHING ELSE SHAPED 
I DON'T KNOW 
THAT WOULD BE POSS SEEING AS SEEING AS IT'S CHEAPER TO MAKE THEM A DIFFERENT 
SEEING AS WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW WE'VE MADE OUT A A SPECIAL FORM 
SO AND THAT WOULD SORT OF MAYBE KEEP US CLOSE IN THE SORT OF THE FASHION TYPE IN 
AND IT WOULD SORT OF YOU KNOW KEEP IT QUITE FANCY AS WELL I DON'T KNOW 
WELL YOU COULD 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN THE VOLUME BUTTONS COULD BE LEMONS OR SOMETHING MAYBE 
OKAY 
SO WE'VE WHAT HAVE W WHAT HAVE WE RID OF 
WE GET RID OF 
THE PLASTIC 
SO AT THE RUBBER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT UH 
SO I MEAN WE'VE GOT WE GET RID OF THE RUBBER CASE BUT 
WE'VE NOW SO WE NOW SORT OF GOT AN EXTRA FORM AND AN EXTRA COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS 
SO MAYBE IN TERMS OF SORT OF FANCINESS AND FASHIONABILITY WE'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME MAYBE 
SO I MEAN WE COULD MAYBE PUT TWO AGAIN ON THEM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE SORT OF INNOVATION 
DO YOU THINK 
OKAY 
AND THEN THE CORPORATE IDENTITY 
YEAH 
WHETHER WHETHER THAT'S CONSIDERED TO BE SORT OF 
PART OF THE CORPORATE IDENTITY I DON'T KNOW

YEAH 
SHALL WE SAVE THE POINT TWO FOR PROFITABILITY THEN 
HMM 
YEAH 
I MEAN IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT I MEAN YOU WANNA PICK UP THE CONTROLLER AND JUST HIT A BUTTON QUICKLY TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR VOLUME 
SO IF IT'S DEAD OBVIOUS THEN THAT'S FINE 
BUT IF YOU'RE OPENING THE PANEL AND YOU'RE LOOKING AND YOU'RE TUNING THEN YOU'RE PAYING A BIT MORE ATTENTION 
SO IT MAY BE SORT OF DIFFERENT COLOUR BUTTONS ISN'T IS IMPORTANT 
'CAUSE YOU YEAH 
SO 
YEAH I MEAN SO WE'VE DROPPED THE COST BUT 
SOME SORT OF FUNCTION 
THE CRITERIA 
IT'S ALRIGHT

YEAH 
WELL WE WERE FINDING OUT VARIOUS THINGS IN 
NO BE IN BETWEEN THE MEETINGS AND THEY DIDN'T THE ONE MEETING DIDN'T ALWAYS FOLLOW ON FOR THE OTHER ONE 
YOU KNOW SORT OF WE HAD THINGS THROWN IN AT THE SECOND MEETING WHERE 
YOU KNOW YOU'D LOOKED AT THE REMOTE CONTROLS AND SEEN THE CURVINESS 
BUT IN THE FIRST ONE YOU'D ALSO LOOKED AT SOME REMOTE CONTROLS AND LOOKED AT THE BUTTONS 
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT WOULD BE IN SEPARATE MEETINGS THAT YOU'D DO THAT 
YOU KNOW YOU'D SORT OF YOU'D PROBABLY PRESENT IT IT IN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THE THING ITSELF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BUT THINK LIKE IT WAS A BIT RESTRICTIVE JUST TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO DESIGN A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL IN A WAY 
I MEAN IT DEPENDS WHAT SORT OF BUSINESS YOU'RE IN I GUESS 
I MEAN THIS ONE SEEMS 
FROM THE WEBSITE IT LOOKS IT'S QUITE INNOVATIVE BUT WE'RE COMING UP WITH SOME BUCKET SHOP PRODUCT AREN'T WE THAT'S YOU KNOW FIFTEEN QUID 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR PRODUCTS IN THEIR WEBSITE HERE REAL REACTION I MEAN IT'S ALL PRETTY HIGH TECH AND CUTTING EDGE 
AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE DID FIND A NEW IDEA I MEAN SORT OF A KINETIC REMOTE CONTROL 
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE OF THEM BEFORE 
BATTERIES I THINK 
SO 
MM YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
THAT WENT OKAY YEAH 
MM-HMM YEAH 
I DON'T THINK SORT OF THE BUDGET UM ALLOWED US TO DO ANYTHING

I MEAN THEY'VE GOT ALL THESE SORT OF YOU KNOW 
HIGH DEFINITION D. V. D. AND 
PORTABLE SEVEN INCH D UM LIGHTWEIGHT COMPUTER SCREENS AND UH I'M THINKING DO YOU KNOW ONE CHEAP REMOTE CONTROL DOESN'T REALLY FIT IN 
SURELY THEY THEY SHOULD PRODU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT WORKED 
COMPUT COMPUTERS COULD BE A BIT DIFFICULT TO TIMES BUT 
I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE THERE'S A LITTLE UM EACH 
THERE'S A LITTLE THERE'S A LITTLE CHIP I THINK YOU MUST PLUG IT INTO SOMETHING AND IT PRODUCES A 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER IT JUST PRODUCES A BIG IMAGE OF SORT OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE WRITTEN OR SOMETHING AND PAGE AFTER PAGE 
YEAH 
KINETIC POWERED REMOTE CONTROL 
UM 
WHAT WAS THE OTHER ONE 
VO YEAH 
VOICE RECOGNITION YEAH 
SO 
ALMOST 
TO FILL IN THESE FILL IN THESE QUESTIONNAIRES 
OH NO 
HMM 
I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TWO QUESTIONNAIRES AND A REPORT ON THE LAST MEETING

UM WE WANT THIS TO BE A MARKETABLE PRODUCT THAT CAN BE TRENDY UM A COMPLETELY NEW STYLE IS THAT 
UM CAN REALLY APPEAL TO A IT A GENERATION THAT DOESN'T WANT A SIMPLE PLAIN KIND OF UH CHANNEL CHANGER 
AND UM IT NEEDS TO BE USER FRIENDLY FOR UM MAYBE FOR AN EXAMPLE

THAT UM THAT UM IN A WAY IT LOOKS KIND OF AWKWARD 
BECAUSE IT'S ON SPINDLY LEGS AND IT UH BUT IT CAN REALLY OVERCOME HARSH TERRAIN

UM OR NOT MEET OUR BUDGET BUT MORE UM LIKE WHAT KIND OF UH SELLING RANGE WE'LL BE LOOKING AT 
UM WANNA MAKE THIS UM SELLING PRICE OF TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
AND SO WE HAVE TO UM COME UP WITH A WAY TO TO CREATE A A UH REMOTE CONTROL WHERE UM 
WE CAN LIKE THE PRICE TO CREATE IT WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS 
UM WE'D LIKE TO ME 
IT UH MAKE FIFTY MILLION EURO 
I'M ASSUMING THAT'S WHAT THE M. MEANS 
UM AND MAKE IT FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET 
UM ONE THING WE'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT INTERNATIONALLY IS IN THE DESIGN OF UM LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF UH V. C. R. S 
THINGS LIKE THAT DEPENDING ON WHICH COUNTRY YOU ARE 
ANOTHER THING FOR THE DESIGN TEAM TO THINK ABOUT 
UM WE WANT TO TO COST UH ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM OF TWELVE EURO AND FIFTY CENTS 
I'M BAD AT MATH 
'KAY 
UM SO NOW THAT UM THAT IS UNDERWAY UM 
IT IS DISCUSSION TIME 
SO THIS IS TIME FOR US TO BRING OUR INITIAL IDEAS ANY UM 
SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE SO FOR A UM YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS

DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY INITIAL THOUGHTS 
MM-HMM 
SO WHAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD UH DUE TO REMEDY THAT 
YEAH 
IT'S A GREAT IDEA 
IT'S A GREAT IDEA 
ALRIGHT 
ANYTHING ABOUT UM THE LOOK OF THE UH REMOTE CONTROL THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE IDEAS ABOUT

ANY IDEAS WILL DO THAT YOU HAVE TO THIS POINT 
CAN HOLD IT 
YEAH 
WELL IF IT'S A TRENDY ORIGINAL UM ASPECT WE'RE GOING FOR 
I MEAN YOU'RE THE DESIGNERS YOU C YOU CAN UM DECIDE WHAT KIND OF UM DIRECTION YOU WANNA GO ON

THAT'S USEFUL 
SO YOU JUST HAVE LIKE THE NUMBER BUTTONS POWER BUTTON T. V. VIDEO BUTTON 
COULD BE SHAPED LIKE A CONCH YOU KNOW 
BE LIKE A SHELL SHAPED REMOTE 
INTERFACE 
UH INDUSTRIAL 
MARKETING EXPERT 
UM I STARTING NOW 
ANYTIME 
OH SORRY 
'KAY UM 
ALRIGHT WELCOME BACK FRO TO THE SECOND MEETING 
AND UM I HOPE YOU HAD A PRODUCTIVE LAST THIRTY MINUTES 
UM AND UM I'LL BE TAKING MINUTES IN THIS ONE AND UM BEING HOOKED UP TO THE POWERPOINT FOR THIS MEETING ISN'T VERY NECESSARY FOR UH MYSELF 
BECAUSE IT'LL BE MORE ABOUT UH WHAT YOU GUYS ARE BRINGING TO THE MEETING TODAY 
UM SO THE FIRST PRESENTATION WE'LL BE LOOKING AT IS POPPY'S PRESENTATION 
AND UM 
SO SORRY 
SO UM TAKE IT AWAY POPPY 
IT'S IT'S PLUGGED IN 
SO UM 
NO PROBLEM 
I'M SURE IT'S FINE 
RIGHT UM ONE QUESTION 
THIS UM SELF DESTRUCTIBLE UH METAL IT ALLOWS FOR RECYCLING MATERIALS 
SO THAT UM SOMEONE COULD HAVE THIS PRODUCT FOR AS LONG AS THEY FELT THAT THEY WANTED TO 
AND THEN ONCE THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THEN THAT COMPANY CAN BREAK DOWN THE PART THE PARTS BETTER 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WOULD WE BE THE COMPANY THAT WOULD BREAK DOWN THESE ARE UH METALS 
OR WOULD WE CONTRIBUTE TO ANOTHER GROUP 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GREAT IDEA 
ONE THING WE HAVE TO CONSIDER IS OUR UH ONE HUNDRED PERCENT UM TURNOVER GOAL THAT WE HAVE FOR OUR FINANCIAL SECTOR 
UM SO WE'LL HAVE TO INVESTIGATE HOW MUCH THAT WILL COST US COST THE COMPANY UM 'CAUSE IT SOUNDS VERY LABOUR INTENSIVE 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HIRE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND IT MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
WE'LL STILL HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS 
ALRIGHT 
I LIKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL APPROACH 
UM WE'LL HAVE TO USE OF THAT CAN MEET OUR FINANCIAL GOALS AS WELL 
I'M SORRY COULD YOU THESE WERE UM 
OKAY 
SO THESE ARE WHAT UM WE'LL C CONSTRUCT THE REMOTE 
THESE ARE ALL THE 
ALRIGHT 
GREAT 
ALRIGHT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AND UM THE NEXT PRESENTER WILL BE TRUE 
YEAH 
FUNCTION F. EIGHT 
SORRY 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
DOES EVERYONE AGREE WITH THIS 
DOES ANYONE OBJECT AND AND FIND THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY TO GO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
SOUNDS GREAT 
ALRIGHT WELL UM ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR PRESENTATION GENEVIEVE 
FABULOUS 
EXCEPT YOU'RE NOT HOOKED UP TO THE GREAT 
NO PROBLEM WE CAN 
I'M SORRY WHAT WAS THAT LAST THING THAT YOU JUST SAID 
MM-HMM 
I'M SORRY THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY 
YOU MEAN THAT THEY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY ON A FANCY LOOKING REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT SO IT MIGHT BE VERY APPEALING IF UM WE HAVE VERY CONCISE BUTTONS 
AND ANOTHER THING WITH UM LOTS OF SURFING WE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK ON SOMETHING THAT COULD BE UM A LOT MORE DURABLE 
BECAUSE I FOUND WITH UM CHANNEL CHANGERS THAT UM A LOT OF THE NUMBERS GET RUBBED DOWN IF THEY'RE PRINTED ON THE BUTTON 
YEAH 
IT'S UM NO IT'S A BUTTON THAT YOU PRESS AND THEN YOU UH LIKE A MENU POPS UP 
I HAVEN'T SAID IT BEFORE BUT 
MM 
THAT'S RATHER SAD 
YEP 
I AGREE WITH UM IF WE'RE TARGETING YOUNG ADULTS THEN IT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK INTO 
UM FINANCIALLY AND AND FUNCTIONALLY 
UM AND ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE UM TRYING TO BE TRENDY GO WITH FASHIONS THINGS LIKE THAT 
UM GOES LIKE FROM THIRTY FIVE TO SIXTY FIVE WHICH SHOW LOWER NUMBERS PROBABLY WON'T BE IS CONCERNED 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
AND SOMETHING THAT MIGHT FURTHER COMPLICATE IT IS THAT THE T. V. MAKES NOISE ITSELF 
WONDER IF IT WOULD HAVE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR A SIMPLISTIC DESIGN IF WE NEED TO DECIDE IF THAT IS OUR UM INTENTION IS IS A SIMPLISTIC DESIGN 
UM BECAUSE IF IF IT IS THEN I THINK VOICE UM VOICE ACTIVATED 
YEAH AND THAT WOULD SORT OF NEGATE THE WHOLE REMOTE CONTROL THING 
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE CAN ACTIVATE THE TELEVISION WITH THEIR VOICE THEN THEY WON'T BE USING A THEY WON'T BE TALKING INTO A REMOTE I'M SURE 
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT AN L. C. D. SCREEN IS 
I HAVE AN IDEA STILL 
I'M SORRY 
UH IN THE REMOTE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
AND IF ONE OF THE LARGEST UH ARE MOST COMPLAINED ABOUT THING IS THAT IT TAKES AS LONG TO GET TO KNOW HOW TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL 
I'M SURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN OUR REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE JUST FURTHERING THAT PROBLEM 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
BEFORE WE GO INTO UH MORE DISCUSSION ON WE WANT THIS DESIGN TO LOOK LIKE I'VE RECEIVED SOME INFORMATION FROM THE MANAGEMENT THAT WILL AFFECT SOME OF OUR DECISIONS 
UM FOR ONE THING BECAUSE HAVING CONTROLS WITH D. V. D. V. C. R. THAT SORT OF THING WOULD REALLY COMPLICATE THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM WE'VE DECIDED NOT TO INCLUDE THEM AND MAKE IT A SPECIFIC JUST A SPECIFIC TELEVISION UM FUNCTION 
WHICH IS GOOD AS AS WE'VE SORT OF DECIDED THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH THAT ANYWAY 
UM FOR MANY REASONS 
SO UM WE HAVE THAT DECISION SORT OF MADE FOR US 
ANOTHER THING THAT MIGHT UM AFFECT OTHER DECISIONS IS THAT UM THE MANAGEMENT FEELS THAT TELETEXT IS OUTDATED BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE USING THE INTERNET NOW 
AND SO UH WE WON'T CONCERN OURSELVES WITH UM NAVIGATING THE TELETEXT OPTION 
YEP 
OKAY SURE 
YEAH I D 
I'M LOOKING AT LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW 
THANK YOU 
UM WELL I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR OR POSSIBILITY OF USING THE INTERNET WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT UM THEY WERE JUST PRETTY MUCH SAYING THAT THE TELETEXT WOULD NOT BE USED 
ALRIGHT AND ANOTHER THING 
THIS IS FOR THE DESIGN THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT IS THAT UM WE WANNA CREATE UM 
MORE OF A SENSE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS IS FROM OUR COMPANY 
SO UM ALL THE REMOTE CONTROLS MUST HAVE OUR UM WE'LL INCORPORATE OUR LOGO AND CLEAR IN IN SOME WAY 
SO UM PERHAPS UM OUR LOGO ON THE BOTTOM OR WHEREVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT WOULD LOOK GOOD 
UM IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE COLOUR OF OUR UM OF OUR COMPANY ABOUT ANOTHER THING IS THAT UM 
WE NEED TO WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THAT COLOUR AND AND LOGO DECIDED UPON 
UM I'M ASSUMING THAT WE ALREADY HAVE NO BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS MEETING I I WASN'T OFFERED A 
LIKE A TYPE OF LOGO OR COLOUR SO IF THAT COULD BE UM SOMEWHERE IN THE DESIGN IS THAT WE CAN BE RECOGNISABLE 
THE LITTLE R. R. YELLOW THING 
OKAY 
REAL REACTION 
OKAY 
UM YES THESE ARE THE CHANGES 
UM SO NOW WE NEED TO DISCUSS UM 
AND COME TO A DECISION ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS OF OF HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE 
I'M JUST GOING TO LOOK AT MY NOTES FOR A SECOND 
UM WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON A TARGET GROUP AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO UM WE ALREADY KNOW THAT IT'LL JUST BE FOR THE TELEVISION 
IT'LL IT WON'T HAVE TELETEXT 
BUT UM YOU KNOW WE COULD DISCUSS UM THESE OTHER OPTIONS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP GENEVIEVE 
SO THAT HOW MOST PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THAT 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT ANOTHER THING IS THAT IF WE'RE REACHING AN INTERNATIONAL CROWD UM 
I KNOW FOR ONE THAT IN NORTH AMERICA THERE IS IN SUCH THING IS TELETEXT IS IT'D BE REALLY SUPERFLUOUS 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES BESIDES THE U. K. 
DO YOU KNOW IF ANYWHERE ELSE HAS TO 
ALRIGHT 
IT WAS A MANAGEMENT DECISION SO IT'S IT'S PRETTY MUCH OUT OF OUR HANDS AT THIS POINT 
'KAY 
SO I GUESS WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING RATHER SIMPLE 
YEAH 
I THINK WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GO AHEAD WITH THE ALARM SYSTEM DO THAT YOU HAD 
'CAUSE I'M SURE THAT COULD BE INEX INEXPENSIVE BECAUSE WE COULD USE THE SAME KIND OF INFRARED 
THE SAME SIGNAL THROUGH THAT AND IT COULD JUST LIKE MAKE A LITTLE BEEPING NOISE 
IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE TO DO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I LIKE THAT IDEA 
YEAH 
THE BUTTON UH 
MINOR DETAIL THERE 
YEAH IT WOULD HAVE TO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THEN IT WOULDN'T IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE IT WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE SAME RECEPTION ON THE REMOTE C CONTROL I GUESS 
BUT THE ACTUAL DEVICE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ITS OWN INFRARED SIGNALLER 
OKAY 
MAYBE UM 
PROBABLY I MEAN 
THAT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT YOU'LL HAVE TO SORT THAT IT 
YEAH YOU'LL HAVE TO YEAH YOU'LL HAVE TO INVESTI DO SOME RESEARCH ON THAT ALRIGHT 
GREAT 
UM ALRIGHT AND I'M SURE THAT UM 
UM THE GLOW IN THE DARK FLUORESCENT WHATEVER SYSTEM UM AS A GO AHEAD 
SO EVERYONE INTERESTED IN THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
BUT I MEAN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
COULD WE SOMEHOW WE COULD MAY POSSIBLY SORRY 
INCORPORATE THEM BOTH SO THAT THE BUTTONS COULD MAYBE BE IN THE SHAPE OF THE NUMBERS THEMSELVES AND BE MADE OUT OF SOME GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL 
'CAUSE I D I DON'T THINK THAT GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL UM LIKE THE ACTUAL SOFT PLASTIC UM COSTS THAT MUCH MORE THAN THREE COLOURS 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT 
UM FOR THE MEETING BUT I THINK WE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS LIGHT SUBJECT A LITTLE BIT MORE BEFORE WE CLOSE 
UM WHAT WAS I MISSED THE LAST MOMENT READING THAT 
WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT WITH THE LIGHTING UP BUTTONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
SO IT COULD BE ANY BUTTON THAT WOULD BE PRESSED 
YEAH 
OKAY SO THAT'S PROBABLY FEASIBLE 
SO DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD DO THE LIGHTING UP THING AND THE GLOW IN THE DARK THING AND THE SHAPE OF THE NUMBERS 
DO WE HAVE TO KIND OF DECIDE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THIS 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
AND IT COULD IF IT'S THAT SOFTER RUBBER MATERIAL IT'LL BE MAYBE UM UH 
BETTER FOR PEOPLE WITH UM ALSO ON WHAT'S IT CALLED R. S. I. WHAT WAS IT THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
YEAH 
YEAH INSTEAD OF LIKE HARD BUTTONS 
OKAY 
UM DID WE WANT TO GO FOR THE GLOW IN THE DARK LOOK 
OR DID WE WANT TO GO FOR THE LIGHTING UP INSTANTLY 
LIKE SHOULD WE DO BOTH 
ARE WE CAN HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER 
BECAUSE IT MIGHT FOR FOR OUR DESIGN PURPOSES I MEAN THE LIGHTING UP THING MIGHT BE BETTER BECAUSE GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL HAS A FUNNY KINDA COLOUR 
AND IT MIGHT NOT GO WITH DIFFERENT LIKE FACE PLATES THAT WE MIGHT COME UP WITH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
SO WE'VE DECIDED ON LIGHTING UP THINGS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT WITH THE SAME THING I MEAN 
IF YOU TOUCH THE BUTTON AND THEN IT COULD BE IT COULD BE LIT UP AS WELL 
SO ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT 
OKAY 
COOL 
UM 
ALRIGHT 
SO I THINK THAT UM 
THAT COMPLETES MOST OF OUR UM ARE MORE UH PRACTICAL DECISIONS 
AND NOW IT'S UP TO DESIGNING 
AND UM MAKING SURE THAT THIS CAN BE FEASIBLE 
AND DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY 
LIKE AN IPOD OR SOMETHING 
OKAY 
LIKE A CELLPHONE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
ACCESSORIES 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD INCORPORATE THAT 
'CAUSE THAT WOULDN'T BE VERY EXPENSIVE AT ALL 
YOU'D JUST GOT ONE MOULD 
THROW SOME PLASTIC ON IT YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
WELL THAT MIGHT BE COM PROBLEMATIC WITH UM COPYRIGHT ISSUES 
SO IF IT TAKES OFF THEN WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL TRY THAT IT 
RIGHT 
WE'LL HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH 
LIKE SO IF YET THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH UM THE WAY IT'LL LOOK 
UM DOES IT NEED TO BE REACHED A D DO WE NEED TO REACH A DECISION ON THAT RIGHT NOW 
BECAUSE WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS 
OKAY 
SO IT DOES IT NEED TO BE UH DECIDED ON NOW 
OR SHOULD WE 
OKAY 
GOOD 
ALRIGHT THEN 
ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO SAY BEFORE WE CLOSE 
ALRIGHT WELL 
LET'S HAVE LUNCH AND WE'LL DISCUSS THIS LATER 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THAT'S OKAY 
THAT'S OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM DO I NEED TO PLUGGED IN 
F. OKAY 
FUNCTION F. EIGHT 
SORRY ABOUT THESE GUYS 
'KAY 
SO NO 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
I WILL TAKE THIS TIME JUST TO APOLOGISE 
I I ONLY UH RECEIVED MY EMAILS LATER ON 
'CAUSE I WAS TOO BUSY CARRIED AWAY DOING MY OWN THING WHICH IS NOT OBVIOUSLY NOT A VERY GOOD PART OF A TEAM WORKING THING 
BUT THERE WE GO 
UM SO I WAS LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT THE WORKING DESIGN 
AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO DO AND WHAT THE REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS TO DO 
AND IT NEEDS TO UM ALLOW A PERSON TO HAVE A PORTABLE DESI DEVICE SO THEY CAN CONTROL THE TELEVISION FROM WHEREVER THEY ARE 
THEY DON'T NEED TO ACTUALLY MANUALLY TOUCH THE TELEVISION SET 
SO IT GIVES THEM MUCH MORE FLEXIBILITY AND ALLOWS THEM TO BE WHERE THEY WANT TO BE 
UM FROM 
UH IN A FUNCTIONAL SIDE OF THINGS WE FIND OUT THAT WH FROM OUR PREVIOUS MEETING 
WE DECIDED THAT THERE'RE CERTAIN POINTS THAT WILL MAKE OUR PRODUCT UNIQUE 
UM ONE IS THE VISIBILITY IN THE DARK WHICH WAS UM GENEVIEVE'S IDEA 
SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE COULD BRING THIS ONE UM TECHNICALLY 
AND WE COULD USE ILLUMINATED BUTTONS WHICH WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH WHEN WE'RE USING A MOBILE PHONE OR UM SOMETHING FAM FAMILIAR 
A AUTOMATICALLY UM LIGHTS UP AT FIRST TOUCH 
ARE WE COULD USE FLUORESCENT MATERIALS WHICH WOULD JUST UM TAKE IN THE LIGHT DURING THE DAY 
AND THEN AS SOON AS THEY GO OFF THEY WOULD GLOW IN THE DARK 
UM ALSO WE COULD USE UM AN ALARM 
SO IF WE LOST THE UM REMOTE CONTROL PERHAPS THERE COULD BE A BUTTON ON THE TELEVISION SET ITSELF 
WHICH YOU COULD PRESS AND THEN AN ALARM FROM THE HANDSET WOULD SOUND WHERE IT WAS HOPEFULLY IN THE ROOM 
MAYBE BEHIND A CUSHION OR SOMEWHERE 
UM SO THAT WOULD WORK 
UM UP 
GO BACK THERE 
UM ANOTHER THING I THINK WE D MISSED IT IN IN THE LAST MEETING WAS THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OUR DESIGN 
UM FROM PREVIOUS RESEARCHES I'VE CARRIED OUT ON OTHER PROJECTS UM WE'VE LEARNT ABOUT SMART MATERIALS WHERE UM UM SPECIFIC ALLOYS OF METALS HAVE A SHAPE MEMORY 
SO THEY CAN BE HEATED AND UM AND COOLED AND THEY CHANGE THE SHAPE OF UM THE METAL 
SO FOR EXAMPLE A SCREW THAT'S HOLDING SOMETHING TOGETHER COULD EXPAND AND IT WOULD FORCE ALL THE COMPONENTS APART 
SO UM THE BENEFITS OF THIS FOR OUR PRODUCT WOULD BE THAT WHEN IT CAME OUT THE END OF ITS PRODUCT LIFE 
IF IT WAS HEATED UM EVERYTHING WOULD SPRING APART 
SO ALL THE UM INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS COULD BE EASILY SEPARATED 
AND THEN SOME COULD BE REUSED SOME COULD BE RECYCLED AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR PRODUCTS NOW 
ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE THERE'S MUCH UH RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THE UM COMPANIES WHO ARE COMING UP WITH LIKE NEW DESIGNS 
'CAUSE ALL WE ALL KNOW THAT OUR RESOURCES ARE BEING LIMITED AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS 
YEAH 
UM 
AND THEN 
YEAH 
YEAH THEY WOULD UM YOU WOULD MAKE THE THE PRODUCT AS YOU NORMALLY WOULD 
APART FROM THE THE BITS THAT HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER WOULD BE MADE OUT OF THIS SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY 
AND THAT'S THE PART THAT WOULD UM ALLOW ALL THE OTHER PARTS TO BE SEPARATED AT THE END 
I MEAN THE USER WOULD RETURN THE P PRODUCT AT THE COMPANY 'CAUSE IT'S THE PRODUCT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO GET RID OF WHAT THEY'VE MADE 
UM AND THEN THE COMPANY COULD THEN JUST SO MAKE USE OF THIS SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS TO SPLIT UP THE COMPONENTS 
AND THEN EITHER REUSE SOME BITS AND OTHER BITS WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY GONNA WEAR OUT WITH TIME 
OR NOT USABLE THEY MIGHT BE LIKE BE ABLE TO PUT INTO SCRAP METAL 
SOMETHING LIKE THE CASE IF IT'S SCRATCHED OR SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT TO ERASE IT 
BUT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO MELT IT DOWN AND ERASE IT AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE 
YOU COULD WE COULD PROBABLY EMPL EM EMPLOY A A SIDE COMPANY OR SOMETHING TO DO THAT FOR US 
BUT IT WOULD BE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GET THAT DONE AND TO DISPOSE OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE MADE 
FOR A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE AT LEAST 
NOT VERY INTO A HUNDRED PERCENT OF EVERYTHING WE PRODUCE BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I THE FACT OF THE SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS IS THAT THEY THEY DON'T NEED TO BE MANUALLY DE UM DECONSTRUCTED 
LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO INDIVIDUALLY UM UNSCREW ALL THE SCREWS 
BECAUSE OF THESE OTHER PROPERTIES ARE SMART MATERIAL 
ALL YOU NEED IS JUST THE HEAT SO THEY SELF DESTRUCT THEMSELVES 
SO I SUPPOSE IT DOES AND LIKE HIGH CONTACT YEAH YOU KNOW HIGH UH QUALITY MACHINERY AND VERY SPECIFIC MACHINERY BUT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM ALSO 
THERE IS UM COMPONENTS 
THIS'LL BE HOW TO UH WELL ACTUALLY WORK 
BUT I HAVEN'T PUT THIS PLAN TOGETHER YET 
THERE WE GO 
SORRY SHOULD I GO BACK 
THIS WOULD ACTUALLY SHOW THE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM 
ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T COME UP WITH THE FINAL CIRCUIT YET 
SO I JUST PUT ALL THOSE COMPONENTS IN 
YEAH 
I IT JUST SHOWS WHAT SORT OF ENERGY SOURCE 
IT COULD BE A BATTERY LIKE RECHARGEABLE PROBABLY 
UM AN' YEAH WELL HOW THE INFRARED WILL ACTUALLY BE SENT THROUGH THE CHIP TO BE RECEIVED BY THE CHIP ON THE TELEVISION SET ITSELF 
OKAY 
SO NOW IS IT F. EIGHT AGAIN TO ESCAPE 
OR ESCAPE 
THERE WE GO 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
THERE YOU GO TARA 
FUNCTION F. EIGHT 
THE ONE AT THE TOP 
UM I WAS JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE WHAT WHAT GENEVIEVE SAID BEFORE ABOUT HAVING LIKE SOME HIDDEN CONTROLS LIKE HAVING THE OUTER CASING 
AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY UM I D WELL WELL WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE ABOUT IT BEING A MORE PROFITABLE SIMPLISTIC DESIGN 
I SUPPOSE HAVING THAT WOULD COMPLICATE IT A LOT MORE 
AND LIMIT THE DESIGN 
DO YOU THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
THE SINGLE FUNCTION 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
IT'S LIKE THE NEWS 
OR LIKE INFORMATION 
THE AND WHAT'S ON 
IT'S LIKE 
IT'S LIKE VERY BASIC INTERNET 
SORT OF UM 
YEAH IT'S JUST INFORMATION THAT UM LIKE TELEVISION TIMETABLES WHAT'S ON WHAT'S ON NOW WHAT'S ON NEXT ONE EVERY CHANNEL AND 
YEAH 
TO GET THE RIGHT RECEPTION AND PICTURE I SUPPOSE 
REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
I THINK 
UH I'M GUESSING THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
I'M NOT 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT IS 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
AND IF THERE WAS CONVERSATION IN THE ROOM AT THE SAME TIME ALTHOUGH IN THEORY IT DOESN'T TEND TO BE WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING TELEVISION 
BUT COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THE SPECIFIC UH DESIGN 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
WHAT WHAT WOULD APPEAR IN THE SCREEN 
LIKE LINKED IN WITH THE TELETEXT OR SORT OF LIKE ONE 
TELETEXT AT YOUR FINGERS WITHOUT HAVING TO ACCESS THAT THROUGH THE TELEVISION 
MM YEAH 
COULD BE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
COMPLICATED JUS COMPLICATING THINGS EVEN IF MM 
OKAY 
CAN I JUST INTERRUPT 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLUG IN YOUR HAVE YOU GOT A POWERPOINT OR NOT 
OKAY 
THANKS 
WERE THEY WAS THE MANAGEMENT SUGGESTING USE OF THE INTERNET RATHER THAN TELETEXT OR JUST AVOIDING BOTH ALTOGETHER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
JUST 
OKAY 
WORK ON THAT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
MORE RESEARCH REQUIRED I THINK 
BUT IF WAS IT A MANAGEMENT DECISION THAT WE'RE HAVING OKAY 
SO 
OKAY 
'KAY 
MINIMAL 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
THE SAME SIGNALLING 
I MEAN 
OR VIBRATE JUST THE SAME AS A MOBILE PHONE 
LIKE YOU JUST A A BUZZ OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
IF DO YOU MEAN THE THE LINK BETWEEN THE WELL IF THE BUTTON WAS ACTUALLY ONE 
OH YEAH 
MAYBE YEAH YEAH 
MAYBE SOMETHING ADHESIVE THAT YOU COULD LIKE STICK ONTO THE BACK OF ANY SET THAT WOULD BE UM YEAH NOT VERY OBTRUSIVE 
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING SMALL THAT'S YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
PRO PROBABLY 
UNLESS IT COULD BE OKAY 
UM UNLESS SOME WAY IT COULD HAVE SOME UNIVERSAL CONNECTION TO LIKE THE SOCKET THE SAME SOCKET THAT THE T. V. 'S SUPPLIED FROM 
I MEAN THE POWER FOR THE T. V. 
SO MM MORE RESEARCH INTO THAT ONE 
YEAH 
YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LIKE A RAISED 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
AND ALSO YOU UH HEATHER YOU MENTIONED BEFORE UM LIKE HOW IT SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY 
UM SO LIKE BIG B UM BUTTONS FOR PEOPLE YOU ARE VISUALLY IMPAIRED 
THE GLOW IN THE DARK OR LIGHT UP WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE ANYWAY 
SO LIKE YOU SAY TACTILE MIGHT BE BETTER BECAUSE IT'D BE MORE AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
NO IT'S NOT THESE DAYS 
I MEAN IT'S QUITE EASILY ACCESSIBLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO SELF TIMED LIGHTING 
UM I 
YEAH 
SO SELF TIMED 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK THE SHAPE OF THE NUMBERS IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
AND I THINK THAT'S UN UNIQUE AS WELL 
I MEAN I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT 
AND SO YOU'RE SAYING LIKE NUMBERS CAN WEAR OFF IF THEY'RE JUST SORT OF LIKE PAINTED ON YOU KNOW PRINTED 
DURABLE 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH AND WE COULD YEAH THERE ARE NOW LIKE LOADS 
OR A HUGE RANGE OF DIFFERENT COLOURS THAT IT COULD LIGHT UP IN AS WELL WHICH COULD LIKE LINK IN WITH THE COMPANY COLOURS 
LIKE IT COULD BE ABLE OR GREEN OR YELLOW OR LIKE WE'VE JUST LIMITED IT WITH THE JUST ORDINARY PHOSPHORESCENT SO 
YEAH 
EVERY TIME TH THAT IT LIT UP YOU C THAT COULD LIGHT UP AS WELL 
OR OR THE WHAT 
YEAH 
SO 
OKAY 
LIKE YOU CAN HAVE CHANGEABLE UM MOBILE COVERS OR SOMETHING 
YEAH OR OKAY 
YEAH 
PERSON 
YEAH 
WELL THAT'S GREAT 
INTERCHANGEABLE 
UM ALSO 
YEAH 
INTERCHAN 
AND ALSO POSSIBLE I MEAN UH WE COULD GAIN OUT OF THAT BY ADVERTISING CERTAIN T. V. SHOWS OR 
YEAH 
BUT IF WE THERE IS YEAH 
WE COULD UM THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR WE DIDN'T BRING THAT UP AGAIN 
YEAH 
UM I'VE 
OKAY 
LET'S 
I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY LEAVE THAT 'TIL LATER ON THEN 
NO 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
F. EIGHT W 
FUNCTION F. EIGHT 
THANKS 
CAN YOU SEE 
DO YOU THINK 
SO IT UH FUNCTION EIGHT YEAH 
OH RIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
I'M THE USER UM 
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
UH THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN OF THE APPARATUS IS THE EFFECT THE APPARATUS SHOULD HAVE 
UM IN THIS CASE IT'S THE FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION TELEVISION SET 
BY TAKING INSPIRATION FROM OTHER SIMILAR DESIGNS WE'LL TRY AND COME UP WITH AN ORIGINAL TRENDY REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS SELLABLE INTERNATIONAL 
THERE'RE TWO FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OPTIONS 
A MULTIFUNCTIONAL REMOTE CONTROL WHICH CAN BE USED FOR SEVERAL ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES 
AND A SINGLE FUNCTION REMOTE CONTROL USED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE TELEVISION 
SORRY 
UM A SINGLE FUNCTION JUST FOR THE TELEVISION ITSELF 
YEAH 
UM MULTIFUNCTIONAL CONTROLS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO USE IS THE MULTITUDE OF BUTTONS CAN BE CONFUSING 
A SINGLE FUNCTION REMOTE CONTROL IS SIMPLER TO USE BUT IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS FOR YOUR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES 
UM I THINK THAT A SINGLE FUNCTION REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE PREFERABLE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO USE 
IT'D BE MORE COMPATIBLE WITH A RANGE OF TELEVISION SETS MAKING IT MORE INTERNATIONALLY SELLABLE 
UM IT WILL MAKE AN ORIGINAL DESIGN MORE OBTAINABLE AS WE HAVE LESS FUNCTIONAL NECESSITIES TO INCLUDE IN THE DESIGN 
AND IT WOULD BE MORE PROFITABLE AS IT WOULD BE MORE SIMPLISTIC 
AND LESS FUNCTIONS WOULD HAVE TO BE INCLUDED 
SO IT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO MAKE 
AND PROBABLY MORE SELLABLE JUST BECAUSE IT'S MORE COMPATIBLE WITH A OR A WIDER RANGE OF DEVICES 
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS 
WELL IT'S JUST THAT WHEN WE'RE CREATING IT WE'RE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT UM COMPATIBLE WITH DIFFERENT BRANDS OF DEVICES 
AND IT WOULD BE EASIER TO MAKE IT COMPATIBLE WITH JUST DIFFERENT BRANDS OF TELEVISION DEVICES RATHER THAN OTHER ENT YEAH OTHER ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND WITH THIS WE'LL HAVE MORE ROOM IN THE BUDGET PROBABLY TO MAKE A MORE ORIGINAL DESIGN 
WE'LL HAVE MORE MONEY TO GO INTO THE DESIGN SIDE OF IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S UM 
IT HAS T. V. HAS LIKE INFORMATION IT HAS INFORMATION ON HOLIDAYS THE NEWS ENTERTAINMENT 
NO L YEAH 
YEAH 
AND YOU HAVE PAGE NUMBERS LIKE FOR THE MENU AND YOU PRESS THE PAGE NUMBERS WITH YOUR REMOTE AND IT IT'LL COME UP 
VERY BASIC INTERNET YEAH 
BUT YOU HAVE YEAH 
BUT YOU HAVE NO INTERACTION BACK WITH IT YOU KNOW 
LIKE THE INTERNET YOU CAN SEND EMAILS AND YOU'VE NO INTERACTION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH PROBABLY JUST TUNING IN THE CHANNELS WOULD TO BE 
TUNING THEM IN AT THE VERY START 
YOU KNOW IF YOU GOT A NEW T. V. SET YOU TUNE IN ALL THE CHANNELS DO YOU THE DO YOU THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
REPETI UH 
YEAH YEAH 
I THINK IT IS 
YEAH 
MOBILE PHONE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
COULD IT IT IT WOULD BE GOOD IF IT HAD THE ACTUAL PROGRAMME THAT WAS ONE AND WHAT WAS NEXT 
BUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE 
YEAH 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD YEAH 
YEAH 
MIGHT BE QUITE EXPENSIVE TO DO THAT THOUGH 
AND WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS MIGHT NOT HAVE TWENTY FIVE EUROS TO SPEND ON A REMOTE CONTROL 
LIKE THEIR PRIORITIES MIGHT NOT BE A FANCY REMOTE CONTROL WHEN THEY'RE JUST STARTING OUT AND YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
EARLY TWENTIES THAT'S THE KIND OF AGE GROUP 
TWENTIES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK IT WOULD BE ANNOYING THOUGH IF I DON'T USE TELETEXT THAT MUCH 
BUT IF IT WAS IN YOUR T. V. YOU'D WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT IF 
YOU'D YEAH 
SO SO IT JUST OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
RIGHT 
I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
OKAY THEN 
YEAH 
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO UM PUT THE LITTLE DEVICE ANYWHERE 
'CAUSE UH ISN'T OUR REMOTE CONTROL FOR 
ALL T. V. S SO 
YOU'D UH 
YEAH WITH THE BUTTON THAT YOU PRESSED 
YEAH 
C 'CAUSE THEN IT WOULD ONLY BE A APPLICABLE TO ON T. V. SET IS IT WOULD NEED TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD STICK SOMEWHERE OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WOULD IT AND A BATTERY THEN 
YEAH 
I I LIKE THE LIGHT UP SUGGESTION 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTER 
'CAUSE YOU KNOW THE WAY FLUORESCENT LIGHTS LOSE THEIR BRIGHTNESS AFTER CERTAIN TIME SO 
I WOULD GO FOR 
WELL JUST THE NUMBERS COULD BE EMBOSSED COULDN'T IT 
LIKE RAISED 
YEAH 
COULD BE RAISED 
JUST LITTLE ARROWS THAT YOU COULD FEEL MAYBE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT I THINK THAT'S GOOD YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO I WOULDN'T SAY SO 
THAT'S GOOD YEAH THAT A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
YEAH 
FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED YEAH 
YEAH 
IF 
I WAS THINKING THOUGH IF IT WAS GLOW IN THE DARK YOU COULD PUT THE UM REAL REACTION SYMBOL AS GLOW IN THE DARK AND THEN IT WOULD BE CONSTANTLY ADVERTISED 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
INTERCHANGEABLE THING 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
YEAH 
YEAH AND THEN THAT WOULD BE UH MORE PROFITABLE LIKE AS A SIDELINE TO THE REMOTE AS WELL 
YOU COULD BUY EXTRA 
YEAH 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
NO 
OH YEAH 
IF WE 
NO 
OKAY 
OH 
FUNCTION F. EIGHT 
THAT LOOKS RIGHT 
I'M SORRY WHAT WAS THAT LAST ONE 
MULTIFUNCTIONAL AND 
EACH UH I SEE 
'KAY 
SO SO FAR AS WE KNOW UM A SINGLE FUNCTION TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL IS IS USABLE INTERNATIONALLY 
RIGHT 
D. V. D. S AND V. C. R. 
OKAY 
YEAH I THINK I AGREE WITH THE SINGLE DESIGN THING FOR NOW BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MUCH THAT IF WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A UNIQUE 
USER FRIENDLY DADADA AND IT'S ALSO MULTI ALSO MULTIFUNCTIONAL UM WE'RE GONNA GO OVER BUDGET FOR ONE THING 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
YES I UM 
UH I'M NOT HOOKED UP BUT OTHER THAN THAT COMPLETELY READY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OH 
I JUST LOST MY MICROPHONE 
JUST A MOMENT 
OKAY 
SO I'LL BE DISCUSSING THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
UM AND I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BRIEFING ON WHAT THAT MEANS EXACTLY 
UM IF YOU ALL REMEMBER FROM THE EMAIL WE GOT BEFORE ARE VERY FIRST UH KICK OFF MEETING WITH THE COFFEE MACHINE 
THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THAT WAS TO PRODUCE HOT COFFEE QUICKLY 
UM SO WHAT I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS THE EQUIVALENT FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
UM SO BASICALLY WHAT NEEDS AND DESIRES ARE TO BE FULFILLED 
UM I'VE DONE SOME MARKETING RESEARCH A LOT OF INTERVIEWS WITH REMOTE CONTROL USERS UM AND SOME INTERNET RESEARCH 
AND I'LL SHOW YOU MY FINDINGS 
UH AND FIRSTLY I WANTED TO REMIND YOU ABOUT OUR COMPANY MOTTO AND PURPOSE 
SO WE BELIEVE IN PROVIDING INTERNATIONAL MARKET WITH FASHIONABLE PRODUCTS 
UM HENCE OUR MOTTO WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
SO I THINK THAT SHOULD BE OUR PRIORITY HERE 
UM AND WE SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKING AT TRENDS IN CLOTHING AND INTERIOR DESIGN 
NOT JUST AN ELECTRONIC FASHION 
SO THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT FITS IN THE HOUSEHOLD 
UM WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TOWARDS TRENDS IN BOTH CLOTHING AND INTERIOR DESIGN 
ANY TRENDS THAT ARE GOING ON ON ON THE PUBLIC EVEN MEDIA YOU KNOW WHO'S FAMOUS 
WHAT T. V. SHOWS ARE BEING WATCHED UM TO INFLUENCE OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY SO THE FINDINGS 
UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS OF REMOTE CONTROLS FIND THEM UGLY 
WHICH IS A QUITE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER 
UM THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DIDN'T SPECIFY IF THEY LEAVE THEM OR FIND THEM YOU KNOW NEUTRAL 
EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY 
CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER 
YEAH THEY'RE WILLING THEY'RE WILLING TO SPEND MONEY ON A REMOTE CONTROL WITH PERSONALITY 
AS OPPOSED TO YOUR BASIC YOU KNOW OVAL BLACK ALL SAME SIZE BUTTON REMOTE CONTROL 
UM SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT 
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IGNORED IN THE HOUSEHOLD 
UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF REMOTE CONTROL USERS SAID THAT THEY ZAP A LOT 
ZAPPING MEANING THEY GO THROUGH CHANNELS A LOT 
THEY'RE YOU KNOW THUMB MASTERS 
UM AND FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS SAY THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS 
THAT A VERY SMALL AMOUNT 
THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING 
YES 
AND ACTUALLY TO GO WITH THAT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU SOME STATISTICS ON THE UH RELEVANCY OF THE BUTTONS HOW MUCH THEY'RE USED 
AND UH HOW IMPORTANT THE UH USERS FIND THEM 
SO THE POWER BUTTON OBVIOUSLY IN IN HERE IS ONLY USED ONCE 
HOPEFULLY THE PERSON'S NOT TURNING ON AND OFF THE T. V. 
UM BUT THE RELEVANCE OF THAT BUTTON IS NINE OUT OF TEN 
SO PEOPLE WANNA BE ABLE TO TURN ON THE T. V. WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM AS OPPOSED TO STANDING UP AND TURNING ON THE TELEVISION SET 
CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES AN AVERAGE PER HOUR 
THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT 
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTON 
UM SO OBVIOUSLY WHEN COMMERCIALS COME ON THEY'RE CHANGING IT IS SO YOU SAID WE WANT A DURABLE BUTTON THAT'S NOT GONNA RUN DOWN 
RELEVANCE OF THAT BUTTON OR USERS FOUND WAS UH TEN TEN OUT OF TEN 
UH DITTO FOR VOLUME SELECTION IS TEN OUT OF TEN 
AND IT'S USED AN AVERAGE FOUR TIMES AN HOUR 
NOT AS MUCH AS CHANNEL SELECTION BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT 
UM AUDIO SETTINGS IS USED AN AVERAGE ZERO POINT EIGHT TIMES AN HOUR 
RELEVANCE IS TWO 
SCREEN SETTINGS WHICH MEANS BRIGHTNESS COLOUR ETCETERA ZERO POINT FIVE TIMES AN HOUR 
UM AND RELEVANCE OF ONE POINT FIVE 
WE'RE GETTING TOO SPECIFIC STATISTICS HERE 
TELETEXT UM NOW I'M NOT TOO CLEAR ON WHAT THAT IS 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HELP ME 
FLIPPING PAGES 
SO THAT 
SO LIKE A RUNNING BANNER UNDERNEATH 
OH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
LIKE TELLS YOU THE WEATHER AND OKAY 
RIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
WELL I GUESS I'M NOT WITH IT BECAUSE I WASN'T BUT IT'S IT'S BEING USED FOURTEEN TIMES AN HOUR 
UM AND HAS A OR A HIGH RELEVANCE OF SIX POINT FIVE 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA WANT TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON AND INCLUDE IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
UM CHANNEL SETTINGS 
ZERO POINT ZERO ONE TIMES AN HOUR 
RELEVANCE OF THREE 
CHANNEL SETTINGS 
P SORRY 
CHANGING THE CHANNELS 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM SO IT'S NOT USED VERY OFTEN BUT PEOPLE STILL FIND IT RELEVANT 
OKAY 
UM BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS OF UH THE PEOPLE THAT WE INTERVIEWED 
REMOTE CONTROLS ARE OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE 
SO THAT WAS ALREADY DISCUSSED BY POPPY 
HOW WE COULD HAVE A AN ALARM SYSTEM IS THAT PEOPLE CAN FIND OUT 
UM TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IT SHOULD BE VERY USER FRIENDLY YOU KNOW 
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT TO DO VERY QUICKLY 
UM REMOTE CONTROLS ARE BAD FOR R. S. I. 
OH 
SO THAT WHAT IT IS 
PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS AND SUCH 
UM MAYBE OR 
DESIGNERS CAN LOOK INTO THAT 
UM BUTTONS THAT DON'T REQUIRE YOU KNOW VERY FIRM PUSHING IF THEY RESPOND 
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO LOSE VIDEO YOU KNOW BUTTONS RESPONDING TO THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH AS WELL 
THAT'S A PROBLEM 
OKAY 
DID YOU GUYS UH GET THAT ONE DOWN 
UM OKAY HERE'S SOME IDEAS FOR YOU 
A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE PUBLIC WOULD PAY FOR VOICE RECOGNITION IN THE REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO I'LL SHOW YOU SOME NUMBERS HERE 
UM SO THE YOUNGEST AGE GROUP FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE 
NINETY ONE POINT TWO PERCENT SAID THAT THEY WOULD PAY EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE VOICE RECOGNI VOICE RECOGNITION INCLUDED IN THEIR REMOTE CONTROL 
UM AND YOU CAN SEE THAT NUMBER DECREASES A BIT WITH OL S INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE IS THE LOWEST AMOUNT 
UM THAT WOULD ARE WILLING TO PAY EXTRA 
SO I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AGE GROUP WE'RE WE'RE TARGETING END OF END OF VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETHING WE WANNA LOOK INTO 
AND IF WE HAVE THE BUDGET FOR IT 
UM IF WE ARE TARGETING YOUNG ADULTS IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD PAY OFF 
SEEING AS NINETY PERCENT OVER NINETY PERCENT WOULD PAY FOR IT 
MM-HMM 
SO THAT THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER FIELD OF RESEARCH 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'D BE IF WE'D STILL HAVE A REMOTE OR IF YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR TELEVISION AND SAYING CHANGE CHANNEL 
UM AND DEPENDING ON HOW MANY MEMBERS YOU HAVE IN HOUSEHOLDS 
SO IT UM IT MAY BE TOO COMPLICATED FOR US BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND ANYWAY 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IT LOOKS LIKE 
MM-HMM 
IT'D BE LIKE THE ULTIMATE REMOTE 
UM OKAY 
AND THE THE LAST THING HERE WAS A AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
SO I MEAN VOICE RECOGNITION MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO EXTREME FOR US 
NOT PRACTICAL 
UM AN L. C. D. SCREEN THOUGH MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN SHIFT THROUGH PAGES KIND OF L THE WAY THIS POWERPOINT IS WORKING 
SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE SO MANY BUTTONS TO DEAL WITH 
OH SORRY JUST JUST A SCREEN LIKE A COMPUTER SCREEN 
SO ARE LIKE UM 
YEAH 
OR LIKE AN ALARM CLOCK 
YOU'D HAVE AN L. C. D. VERSUS JUST A A NORMAL CLOCK 
UH JUST LIKE AN ELECTRONIC SCREEN 
AS OPPOSED TO JUST BUTTONS 
THERE WOULD BE LIKE A LITTLE LIKE AN YEAH 
LIKE IN THE TOP OF A CELLPHONE THE THE LITTLE L. C. D. SCREEN 
UM NOW THAT'S I I DUNNO EXACTLY WHAT EXACTLY WE'D PUT IN THERE 
I GUESS THE CHANNEL THAT YOU'RE IN THE V THE VOLUME SETTING 
MM-HMM 
WELL I GUESS THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ALL TAKE BACK TO OUR RESPECTIVE RESEARCH 
UM AND FINALLY WHOOPS MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES AND THOUGHTS 
UM I THINK OUR PRIORITY REALLY SHOULD BE UNIQUE DESIGN 
UM WE WANT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WANT IN THEIR HOME 
EVERY REMOTE CONTROL LOOKS THE SAME AS UH IN MY OPINION IT SHOULD BE UM USER FRIENDLY AND UNIQUE 
SO THE OTHER STUFF MIGHT BE A LITTLE IT A LITTLE TOO GADGETY FOR SOME PEOPLE 
UM I TH MYSELF VOICE RECOGNITION KIND OF SCARES ME OFF 
SO IF WE'RE IF WE'RE AIMING TO MAKE THIS AN INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED PRODUCT UM AND FOR ALL THE OTHER THING IS LIKE AGE MARKET 
I MEAN IF WE WANTED TO CONCENTRATE ON FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLDS WE COULD GO FOR THE FANCY STUFF 
BUT IF WE WANNA MAKE FIFTY MILLION AND AND HAVE EVERYONE WANT THIS REMOTE CONTROL WE SHOULD MAYBE 
STICK TO THE BASICS 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
AND WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR RESEARCH 
I MEAN YOU KNOW A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WOULD SAY YEAH I'D PAY EXTRA FOR VOICE RECOGNITION UNTIL THEY REALISE THAT'S THREE MONTHS ALLOWANCE 
UM SO I I THINK I THINK THE OLDER GENERATIONS WE SHOULD BE CATERING TO A BIT MORE 
YEAH 
YEP 
OKAY 
THAT'S IT FOR THE MARKET RESEARCH 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE CAN DO THE 
THERE YOU GO 
UH COME BACK SCREEN 
HMM 
IT'S PROBABLY R. R. R. IN YELLOW 
YEAH I THINK 
OKAY SO I ARE WE GOING TO WRITE OFF THE L. C. D. OPTION 
YEAH 
OKAY 
IS AN L. C. D. NO TELETEXT AND NO VOICE RECOGNITION 
YEAH 
NEVER HEARD OF IT 
UM WELL I GUESS JUST FROM MY FINDINGS IT LOOKS LIKE WE WANNA MINIMISE BUTTONS 
UM 
AND THE WHAT WAS THE WORD THEY SAID 
F FINDABILITY IS IMPORTANT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
IN THE BUTTONS 
IT DOESN'T IT COULD IT COULD BE A TACTILE THING AS WELL 
UM RIGHT IF WE IF WE'RE MINIMISING BUTTONS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM ACTUALLY LARGER 
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ON IT 
SO YOU KNOW LIKE UP ARROW DOWN ARROW FOR FOR VOLUME 
UM AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO FOR FOR CHANNELS 
SO 
THE NUMBERS THEMSELVES 
BUT THEN THE LOOK UP BUTTON AND DOWN BUTTON FOR THE CHANNEL CHANNEL CHANGING 
YEAH 
I JUST THOUGHT THAT IT IT MIGHT BE SUCKING MORE BATTERY POWER OF THREE OF IT IS A LIGHT UP 
I'M NOT SURE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I GUESS THE OTHER OPTION REFERRING TO THE BATTERY THING SO YOU KNOW HOW CELLPHONES WILL IT LIGHT UP FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS OR SOMETHING 
WHEN YOU'RE S AND THEN IT GOES SO IF IF YOU'RE LIKE CHANGING THE VOLUME DURING A MOVIE 
I KNOW I'M THINKING OF MOSTLY WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVIE YOU TURN ALL THE LIGHTS OFF RIGHT 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TURN ON THE LIGHTS TO TURN IT DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S SUDDENLY AN EXPLOSION AND IT'S GONNA WAKE UP THE BABY 
UM SO IF YOU TOUCH THE BUTTON TO KIND OF REACTIVATES IT 
IT LIGHTS UP FOR 
NO SELF TIMER 
YEAH 
UH JUST IF IT WAS KINDA THE SAME WAY THAT A CELL YOU KNOW HOW A CELLPHONE WILL LIGHT UP FOR ABOUT TEN 
FIFTEEN SECONDS WHEN YOU TOUCH A BUTTON AFTER HAVING NOT TOUCHED IT FOR A WHILE 
UM IF INSTEAD OF A CONSTANT LIGHT UP ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL IF IT LIGHTS UP FOR TEN SECONDS WHEN IT'S TOUCHED AGAIN 
YEAH AND YOU YOU TOUCH IT AND IT JUST KIND OF LIGHTS UP A BIT AND IT GIVES A FAINT GLOW 
SO IF YOU HAVE ALL THE LIGHTS OFF IN YOUR LIVING ROOM YOU'LL YOU'LL TEMPORARILY SEE IT 
BECAUSE USUALLY YOU'RE NOT FOOLING AROUND FOR IT FOR MORE THAN WHAT TEN SECONDS 
SO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OH RIGHT THE 
MM-HMM 
I WAS GONNA SAY 
EXACTLY 
AT THE IT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS TACKY GLOW IN THE DARK 
IT'S KIND OF LIKE EIGHTIES NEON STYLE 
UM WHEREAS WE'RE TRYING TO BE TRENDY AND FASHIONABLE 
SO 
MM-HMM 
MM 
THAT'S TRUE 
WHAT UM OH SORRY 
YEAH WELL I WAS JUST GONNA THROW OUT THERE THE THOUGHT ABOUT UM PERSONALISING THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM IT YOU 'CAUSE YOU MENTIONED FACE PLATES 
SO I I DUNNO IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT 
DIFF YOU KNOW LIKE FIVE DIFFERENT FACE PLATES 
I DUNNO IF THIS WILL START MAKING IT MORE COMPLICATED BUT IT COULD INCREASE THE POPULARITY OF THE OF THE REMOTE 
UM 
YEAH 
EXACTLY LIKE AN IPOD 
EXACTLY 
OR OR LIKE MOBILE PH 
AND I DUNNO IF WE'D WANT TO GO WITH LIKE T. V. SHOW THEMES OR SOMETHING 
LIKE A BART SIMPSON FACEPLATE 
BUT 
MM-HMM 
EXACTLY 
YOU COULD START IT WITH THEIR AND IF IF WE HATE TOO BIG THEN WE CAN ADD SOME IN 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
SO EVERYONE READY TO START 
OKAY 
GREAT 
WELL WELCOME TO THE THIRD MEETING OF CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
I'LL JUST GET THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION UP AND RUNNING 
OKAY 
UM IN THE AGENDA FOR THIS UM FOR THIS PARTICULAR MEETING WE'LL HAVE YOUR THREE PRESENTATIONS ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE SINCE OUR LAST MEETING 
AFTER WE COME UP WITH UM SOME GENERAL IDEAS OF OUR DESIGN 
AND UM THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME KEY DECISIONS ON 
IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPT AND HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT WHAT UH MATERIALS WE'RE GONNA USE AND THAT SORT OF THING 
THE MEETING WILL BE FORTY MINUTES LONG 
AND UM WE WILL ONCE AGAIN HAVE POPPY AS OUR FIRST PRESENTER 
ALRIGHT AND I WILL SWITCH UP POWERPOINT 
OKAY 
UM 
ARE THEY ALL INCLUDED LIKE MANDATORILY OR OR OR THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS 
YEAH 
MM 
UM 
WHAT IS A HAND POWERED DYNAMO 
JUST VERY VERY NICE IN A WHILE 
JUST VERY NICE IN A WHEEL OR CONSTANTLY 
ALRIGHT 
IT'D BE KIND OF STRANGE TO ALWAYS BE CRANKING IT I THINK 
NO 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
UM ONE THING WITH THE SCROLL BUTTONS THOUGH 
IT IT WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN L. C. D. UM 
DISPLAY AND THE GLOW IN THE DARK THING 
MIGHT BE DIFFICULT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
UM ONE CONCERN WITH THE RUBBER CASING IS THAT IT WOULD BE RUBBER ENCAPSULATING ALL OF THESE CHIPS AND DIODES AND DELICATE TECHNOLOGY IS 
LIKE IS THE EXTERIOR 
THIS IS THE ONE THING THAT'S PROTECTING ITS INNARDS 
YEAH 
ANOTHER THING IS IT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT IF IT'S A RUBBER EXTERIOR TALKING ABOUT PUTTING IN INTERCHANGEABLE PLATES 
UM SO IT I DON'T SEE HOW A LIKE A RUBBER PLATE GOING ON TOP IT WOULD STAY THERE 
LIKE IF IT WAS SORT OF LIKE A CLIP ON PLASTIC PLATE 
IT WOULD WORK THAT WAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
SO MAYBE THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT SOUNDS GOOD 
I UM SO IT POSSIBLE TO PUT DESIGNS ONTO THIS TYPE OF RUBBER 
OKAY WE'LL JUST SAY YEAH 
YES JUST WHY NOT 
ALRIGHT 
I LIKE THE KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE IDEA 
UM I DON'T KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WILL UM BE MOVING A REMOTE AROUND A LOT 
BUT I THINK THAT IT'S WORTH IT KINETETY KINETIC UM 
ENERGY SOURCE 
IT COULD MAKE ONE WE COULD HAVE ANY KIND OF STYLE 
IT WOULDN'T BE AS HEAVY OR BULKY AND 
YEAH 
JUST FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU CAN WATCH A T. V. ON THE DARK THEN 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE IMPRACTICAL THOUGH 
YEAH 
LIKE PEOPLE DON'T WANNA HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OR JUST LIKE PICK IT UP WHEN YOU'RE GONNA USE IT 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
COOL 
'S THAT THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION 
ALRIGHT 
THANK YOU 
YEAH 
THAT'S ME 
OH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 'CAUSE I'M SORRY 
UM BECAUSE COMMAND INTERFACE REQUIRES YOU TO TYPE TEXTUAL COMMANDS AND INPUT TO A KEYBOARD SO THE NUMBERS ARE SORT OF LIKE A KEYBOARD 
YOU'RE PRESSING THE NUMBERS FOR ME FOR WHAT YOU WANT 
YEAH WE'LL BE DOING 
YEAH 
IT'D BE MORE A COMMAND INTERFACE AND THEN 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
I THINK THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT L. C. D. TYPE THINGS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
OH YEAH LIKE HOW THE BUTTONS 
YEAH AS A BUTTON THOUGH 
SO IT'S A KEYBOARD IN THE SHAPE OF IT RIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I LIKE THAT IDEA 
YEAH 
I'M SURE I LIKE KINETIC ENERGY WOULD PROBABLY DIP INTO THE BUDGET 
A BIT MORE TO YEAH 
MM-HMM 
DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD KEEP ALL THE BUTTONS IT IN SOME COLOUR JUST TO KEEP IT GIVE IT A SIMPLISTIC LOOK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LIGHTING UP EFFECT 
UM WELL UM I THOUGHT WE HAD UM DECIDED THAT WE WOULD IF YOU TOUCHED ONE OF THE BUTTONS THEY'D ALL LIGHT UP 
AND SO IF THEY WERE BLACK IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO LIGHT UP 
IF THEY WERE WHAT THEY WOULD GLOW PROBABLY 
IF THEY WERE MADE OUT OF RUBBER 
OH 
WHERE WOULD THE LIGHT COME FROM 
YEAH 
YEAH AND WELL RUBBER IS A MORE TRANSLUCENT PRODUCT IT SO WE HAVE THAT TAKEN CARE OF 
OH 
MM 
WELL IF THEY'RE RAISED UP BUTTONS 
SO THAT YOU CAN FEEL THEM 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT BEING MORE 
UM A LOT MORE TANGIBLE 
UM IT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT TO DO 
IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE STICKING UP 
IF IT'S FLAT THAN LIKE O LIKE IN A CELLPHONE OR A MOBILE PHONE 
IT'S LIKE ALL VERY FLAT AND YOU JUST HAVE TO SORT OF PRESS DOWN ON THESE TINY LITTLE BUTTONS BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
IF IT'S D BLUE WE CAN DO 
YEAH SOUNDS GOOD TO ME 
ALRIGHT THANK YOU 
THAT MEANS YOU'RE UP 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IS THE ONLY 
OR THAT I FOUND RATHER JARRING 
EVERYTHING ELSE WE CAN REALLY WE CAN REALLY 
UM DO ACCORDING TO OUR PLANS ALREADY GIVEN THE MARKET 
BUT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SEEMS A VERY STRONG IDEA FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT THEY STILL NEED TO ME FIT INTO PEOPLE'S DECOR THOUGH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TONE IT DOWN 
YEAH LIKE MORE LIKE PHOTOS OF FRUIT IN IN OUR PRODUCT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH UM 
ALRIGHT GIVEN THAT INFORMATION 
WE NEED TO START MAKING SOME MORE SPECIFIC DECISIONS 
SO I'LL NEED TO UM HOOK UP THE POWERPOINT AGAIN 
BUT IT'S STILL AROUND RIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE THIS POP UP NOW 
ALRIGHT 
HERE WE GO 
OKAY SO WE HAVE TO UH DECIDE NOW EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO 
SO ENERGY WE UH 
OH NO I CAN'T WRITE IT IN WHEN IT'S IN THIS SETTING 
DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO TAKE IT OUT OF 
UM YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM SO BACK TO DECISIONS 
ENERGY WE'VE DECIDED ON KINETIC RIGHT 
OKAY SO THAT'S GOOD 
HMM 
BUT WOULD A BACKUP REALLY BE NECESSARY 
I MEAN WILL PEOPLE JUST USE THE BATTERY IF THERE'S NO IF THERE'S 
IF THERE IS BACKUP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THERE'S LIKE NO REASON WHY IT WOULDN'T WORK RIGHT 
YEAH 
IT COULD EVEN BE ONE OF OUR SELLING POINTS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT THE NEXT UM DECISION IS CHIP ON PRINT 
I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS 
RIGHT AND WE WERE GOING FOR MORE SIMPLISTIC STYLE RIGHT 
YEAH 
I THINK WE DECIDED ON THE PUSHBUTTONS RIGHT 
YEAH 
WOULD WE NEED A MORE ADVANCED ONE FOR UH THE LIGHTING THE INTERIOR LIGHTING SYSTEM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
THAT'S CALLED MEDIUM OR REGULAR 
'KAY 
OKAY AND CASES 
UM DOES THIS IS THIS DEPENDENT ON SHAPE OR WHAT IT'S MADE OF OUR WHAT 
YEAH 
WELL I GUESS PLASTIC AND COATED IN RUBBER 
PLASTIC WITH RUBBER 
COATING AND INTERCHANGEABLE 
UM 
YEAH INTERCHANGEABLE PLATES 
OKAY 
USER INTERFACE CONCEPT 
THIS IS YOUR TIME TO SHINE 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
COMMAND INTERFACE 
DID YOU SAY COMMAND LINE 
OKAY 
LINE INTERFACE 
ALRIGHT AND SUPPLEMENTS 
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT 
UM 
MM-HMM 
UM WHAT OUR OUR CHOICES HERE 
YOU MEAN LIKE WE'LL HAVE THE NUMBERS OF THE CHANNELS AND WE'LL HAVE THE CHANNEL CHANGER AND VOLUME AND POWER 
UM 
YEAH 
LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD GO INTO LIKE ADJUSTING LIGHT LEVELS THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE DIFFERENT TELEVISIONS WILL HAVE 
UM YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH IT WAS HARDLY EVER USED REALLY 
YEAH 
AND MOST TELEVISIONS WILL COME WITH A REMOTE 
YEAH 
'KAY WELL WE KNOW WE WANT NUMBERS 
YEAH IT DOES 
YEAH AND DIFFERENT TELEVISIONS 
LIKE W I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN MAKE A REMOTE THAT WOULD BE UNIVERSAL AT ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF 
CHANGES LIKE THAT 
VOLUME 
YEAH 
OH 
WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO FINISH OUR MEETING 
CRAP 
OKAY UM LET'S DO THIS FAST 
UM 
SHOULD WE HAVE AUDIO 
IT ONLY COMES UP ON MINE USUALLY 
YEAH I DON'T I IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE INTERNATIONAL UH PEOPLE I THINK 
UM IF WE HAVE AUDIO BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW OTHER TELEVISIONS WORK 
BUT WE KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS THIS AND IT'S THE SAME 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
GOOD 
AND OKAY IN CLOSING 'CAUSE WE ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES 
WE'LL BE MEETING AGAIN IN THIRTY MINUTES 
UM 
YOU'LL BE WORKING POPPY WILL BE WORKING ON THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN 
WAIT A MINUTE 
SO THAT RIGHT 
YEP AND UM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN IS THIS IS WHERE THE TRENDY STUFF COMES IN 
AND YOU'LL BE EVALUATING THE PRODUCT 
UM 
POPPY AND TARA WILL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER USING MODELLING CLAY 
AND UM YOUR PERSONAL COACH WILL GIVE YOU THE REST OF THE INFORMATION OF WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN 
ALRIGHT 
SO ANYONE ELSE HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
FIVE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LOTS OF YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
'KAY WE'LL STICK TO THE FRUIT AND VEGGIE THEME THEN 
ALRIGHT 
AND UM WE'LL RECONVENE IN THIRTY MINUTES 
'KAY 
BYE 
I'LL SEE YOU LATER 
UH WHAT DID I JUST DO 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
SHOULD BE JUST LOADING 
OKAY 
OH ALTHOUGH I CAN'T USE IT IN MY SCREEN 
THAT SAYS GO HERE 
OKAY 
I'VE BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH INTO THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT WE COULD USE UM WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO SEE IF IT ACTUALLY MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW THE REMOTE CONTROL IS ACTUALLY MADE 
AND WHAT IS IT HAPPENS INSIDE THE CASING WHICH IS MORE YOUR FIELD 
UM THES MAIN INTERNAL FEATURE IS A CIRCUIT BOARD WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE ELEC ELECTRONICS AND ALSO THE CONTACTS WITH THE POWER SOURCE 
WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY A BATTERY SO WE'RE ABOUT IT IS 
UM THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPONENTS OF UM 
THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHERE WE'LL BE GETTING THEM FROM WHAT THEY'LL BE MADE OF 
UM INCLUDING THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE CHIP 
WHICH IS WHERE ALL THE MAIN INFORMATION IS UH CONTAINED 
UM DIODES TRANSISTORS RESONATORS RESISTORS AND CAPACIT CAPACITORS ALL NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AS WELL 
UM AND ALL THEIR POSITIONING IN THE CIRCUIT 
UH THIS THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT OPTIONS THEY'RE ALL SEPARATE APART FROM THE CHIP 
WHICH WE WILL PROBABLE DECIDE WHETHER WE BUY A SIMPLE A REGULAR ADVANCED 
WE CAN GO INTO THAT LATER 
UM ALL THE OTHER THINGS ARE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS THAT WE'D HAVE TO GET IN SEPARATELY AND WORK AT THE MOST 
LIKE EFFECTIVE UM CIRCUIT INCLUDING ALL THE WIRES AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT 
AND THE L. E. D. OF COURSE THAT'S A LIGHT EMITTING DIODE 
SO WE COULD SO WE'VE GOT FLEX FLEXIBILITY WITH COLOURS AND THINGS WITH THAT AS WELL 
OKAY THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE 
WE COULD USE A BASIC BATTERY BUT THAT BRINGS WITH IT LIKE THEY NEED TO BE RECHARGED AND THE BULK THE SIZE OF IT AS WELL 
AND THEY'RE NOT SO GREAT TO DISPOSE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY 
THERE'S A HAND POWERED DYNAMO WHICH IS A SORT OF THING THAT WAS USED FOR TORCHES FIFTY YEARS AGO 
A BIT OUT OF DATA 
KINETIC ENERGY IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN RECENTLY DEVELOPED 
UM WHERE YOU MANUALLY CHARGE UP THE POWER 
LIKE YOU WIND UP SOMETHING 
SORRY 
YEAH 
VERY NICE IN A WHILE I THINK 
BUT IT'S 
YEAH 
IT WOULD BE LIKE GOING A STEP BACK IN TIME 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD REALLY BE WITH KIND OF CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY 
WHEREAS KINETIC ENERGY IS A NEW IDEA THAT'S BEING USED BY SOME WATCHES AND OTHER DEVICES WHERE YOU JUST SHAKE THE DEVICE AND IT GIVES IT POWER 
I MEAN THE KINETIC ENERGY IS TRANSFORMED INTO POWER TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT WORK 
UM OR THERE'S SOLAR POWER WHICH WE'VE BEEN CONSIDERING INSIDE A BUILDING WHICH IS WHERE IT'S GONNA BE USED MIGHT NOT BE QUITE IS USEFUL 
BUT GOOD TO LOOK INTO RENEWABLE ENERGY ALWAYS THE WAY 
UM LOTS OF CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE CASE LIKE WHAT SORT OF SHAPE IT WOULD BE CURVED OR FLAT 
THAT'S GOT A LOT TO DO WITH THE ERGONOMICS 
LIKE HOW IT'S COMFORTABLE AND S SITS IN THE HAND 
WE DON'T WANT SOMETHING THAT'S HUGE AND YOU CAN'T PICK UP 
OR TOO SMALL 
OR TOO SLIDY 
I KNOW I'VE HAD A REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE WHICH YOU COULDN'T TELL WHICH WAS THE FRONT AND THE BACK 'CAUSE IT HAD SO MANY BUTTONS ON 
AND THE SHAPE WAS SO SYMMETRICAL THAT I'D BE PRESSING LIKE A VOLUME BUTTON INSTEAD OF THE ONE BUTTON 
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY IS WHICH WAY AROUND IT IS 
UM WE ALSO CAN CHOOSE WHAT MATERIALS UM THE WE COULD USE METAL WE COULD USE RUBBER WHICH MIGHT BE MORE UM IDEAL FOR THE ANTI R. S. I. 
IT'S LIKE THE SAME SORT OF RUBBER THAT'S USED IN STRESS BALLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT'S VERY LIKE SOFT NOT SO STRESSFUL ON YOUR HANDS 
WOOD 
UM AGAIN STEPPING BACK IN TIME AGAIN THREE 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S QUITE UP TO DATE WITH WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE 
UM TITANIUM IS NOT GONNA BE POSSIBLE EVEN THOUGH IT JUST IT BEYOND OUR BUDGET REALLY 
BUT WOULD'VE BEEN MAYBE FOR FUTURE PROJECTS 
UM RIGHT OUR CHOICE FOR BUTTONS AS WELL 
WE'VE DEVELOPED SOME WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY WITH OUR RESEARCH TEAM HAVE FOUND SOME UH NEW MULTIPLE UM OPTION SCROLL BUTTONS 
I THINK THAT WAS BROUGHT UP FOR UM THEY'RE BASICALLY QUITE A FLEXIBLE DESIGN MODERN YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS 
YOU CAN JUST SLIDE UP AND DOWN 
I'M SURE WE'RE ALL QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THIS ONE MOBILES OR COMPUTER LAPTOP PADS 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
AND THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN ADVANCED YEAH 
IF WE HAVE YEAH 
WE'RE GOING ON IT THAT LATER WITH THE ADVANC WITH THE L. C. D. THAT MEANS WE'D NEED A REALLY ADVANCED CHIP 
AND IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THAT'S GONNA BE IN OUR BUDGET 
UM ALSO WE'VE GOT THE INTEGRATED PUSHBUTTON WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE MOST FAMILIAR WITH 
IT'S THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD 
BUT YOU CAN IN LIKE INCORPORATE THAT WITH A SCROLL BUTTON AS WELL 
GOT DECISIONS TO MAKE THERE 
AND THIS IS WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING BEFORE 
LINKED IN THE DIFFERENT DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF BUTTONS WE HAVE AND THE INPUTS 
UM SIMPLE WOULD GO WITH THE PUSHBUTTON 
UM REGULAR YOU COULD LINK WITH THE SCROLL BUTTON 
AND THE ADVANCED WE'D HAVE TO GO WITH A L. C. D. S DISPLAY 
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
I THINK WE COULD GO FOR THE KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE 
I DON'T I THINK THAT'S QUITE UM AN ADVANCED KIND OF TECHNOLOGY 
IT'S NOT BEEN SEEN BEFORE SO IT COULD BE QUITE A A NOVELTY FACTOR ATTRACTIVE AS WELL 
AND ALSO ENERGY SAVING 'CAUSE YOU'RE PRODUCING THE ENERGY YOU DON'T NEED AN EXTERNAL SORT OF BATTERY SUPPLY OR SOLAR PANELS 
YOU JUST GIVE IT A SHAKE 
SOUNDS BRILLIANT TO ME 
RUBBER CASING I THING WOULD PROBABLY THE BEST IF WE'RE GOING FOR THE ANTI R. S. I. AND LIKE MORE CHOICE WITH UM AESTHETICS 
LIKE IT COULD BE PRETTY MUCH ANY COLOUR WE WANT 
UM AND GIVES YOU YEAH MORE FLEXIBILITY THERE 
AND PROBABLY THE REGULAR CHIP AS OPPOSED TO THE SIMPLE 
THEN WE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE THE SCROLL AND THE PUSH BUT AN L. C. D. 'CAUSE WE PROBABLY CAN'T AFFORD THAT ONE 
MM-HMM 
I THINK THAT WOULD UH THERE WOULD BE IN IN SORT OF MORE INTERNAL CASING 
AND THE RUBBER WOULD JUST BE THE WHAT'S IN CONTACT WITH THE HUMAN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE IF THE UM IF IT WAS JUST KIND OF A MORE OF A RUBBER COATING WHICH WAS ON IT A CASE 
SO IT WAS KIND OF THE WHOLE THING WOULD BE REMOVABLE 
YEAH 
LIKE I CAN'T THINK OF WHAT 
YEAH 
OR LIKE ONE YOU CAN GET SORT OF OUTER CASING FOR IPODS AND SOMETHING THAT'S JUST IT'S PROTECTIVE AS WELL 
IT IT STOPS IT I MEAN IT WOULD REDUCE THE IMPACT IF IT WAS DROPPED OR SOMETHING 
AS WELL 'CAUSE IT WOULDN'T DAMAGE ITSELF SO EASILY 
I THINK I MAYBE A MIXTURE OF BOTH THERE MAYBE 
YEAH 
AND THEN YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO FAR AS I KNOW 
IT SHOULD BE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LIKE AS A BACKUP FOR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SOME ALTERNATIVE JUST IN CASE SOMETHING WENT WRONG 
THAT'S TRUE 
I JUST THOUGHT OF THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAY MAYBE THAT COULD BE THE BACKUP 
INSTEAD OF A BATTERY 
LIKE SOLAR BACKUP 
YEAH 
I SUPPOSE SO BUT SOME 
BUT THING IS IT'S NOT YOU DON'T NEED THE SOLAR ALL THE TIME 
IT CAN BE STORED 
IT CAN BE LIKE YOU CAN HAVE THE SOLAR ENERGY AND THEN IT CAN STORE THAT ENERGY AND SO IT 
IT JUST NEEDS TO BE IN LIGHT FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME PER DAY 
LIKE A FEW HOURS A DAY 
THAT'S TRUE 
IT COULD EASILY 
YEAH 
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE REALLY ANNOYING IF YOU GET TO THINK UH NO I FORGOT TO CHARGE MY REMOTE TODAY 
LIKE IF THE KINETIC THING I THINK WHAT'S BEST ABOUT THAT IS THAT IT'S INSTANT ENERGY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOU KNOW YOU CAN SHAKE IT A FEW TIMES OR WHATEVER 
AND IT WORKS 
YEAH 
INSTEAD OF YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO CHARGE AND 
OK OKAY 
YEAH 
THERE WE GO 
IT WASN'T ON MINE EITHER 
I DON'T KNOW WHY 
I THINK I JUST I JUST SAID THE MOUSE IN THERE 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
SO I SUPPOSE SOMETIME AFTER YOU 
MM 
I SEE I SUPPOSE WHERE UM MM IN SOME BUTTONS YOU WOULD HAVE LIKE THE POWER WOULD BE S SOME KIND OF SYMBOL 
AND IF YOU WANTED TO GO ONTO TELETEXT OR I KNOW WE'RE NOT HAVING THAT BUT I MEAN A SIMILAR THING YOU 
THEY HAVE THERE'S A LOOK LITTLE PICTURE WITH A SCREEN WITH LINES ACROSS IT 
WHICH I SUPPOSE IT'S THAT SORT OF THING LIKE THE THE SYMBOL ON THE BUTTON 
BUT IF WE'RE HAVING A SIMPLIFIED DISPLAY ANYWAY WE THAT WE PROBABLY WON'T HAVE TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON THAT 
IT'LL BE MORE THE ON THE NUMBERS AND THE VOLUME 
I SUPPOSE WE NEED TO THINK OF SYMBOLS FOR LIKE THE VOLUME DISPLAY AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
I 
FOR INP 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
THAT'S IN LIKE THE BUTTONS WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT LIKE COLOURS FOR DIFFERENT CHOICES AND THINGS 
IT CAN BE A BIT YEAH OVERWHELMING 
YEP 
OH 
I'D ASSUME LIKE AN INTERNAL LIGHT THAT COMES THROUGH 
SO THERE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE TO BE SOME PARTS MAYBE TRANSPARENT AROUND THE BUTTONS OR SOMETHING 
YEAH YEAH 
IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO MM-HMM 
L YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE 
I MEAN THE UH THE DIMENSIONS OF IT 
'CAUSE IF IT'S JUST LIKE CONSTRUCTED IN THE SAME WAY IS LIKE THE FRONT COVER OF A MOBILE PHONE 
YOU CAN LOOK TAKE OFF THE HARD COVER AND THEN THERE'S THE LIKE SAY THE BUTTONS 
AND THEN YOU GET TO THE CIRCUIT 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD MATTER THAT THE BUTTONS WERE BIGGER THROUGH THE THE TOP CASING 
I'M SURE YOU COULD OF WORK OUT TO TO FIT IN THE CASING WITHOUT CAUSING TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY 
I'M SURE THAT'D BE FINE 
OKAY 
YOU'RE NOT PLUGGED IN YET 
MM 
IT IS STRANGE 
WELL 
WE 
I THINK WE POSSIBLY COULD TAKE A MORE ABSTRACT DESIGN 
LIKE LOOK AT THE BASIC SHAPES OF DIFFERENT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
AND THEN JUST REALLY LIKE STRIP IT DOWN TO LOOK REALLY BASIC SHAPES 
I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING ON THE SHAPE OF A STRAWBERRY BUT IT COULD HAVE THE CURVES OF A STRAWBERRY OR SOMETHING 
OR A STRAWBERRY SEED OR A LIFE 
OR JUST LIKE YOU KNOW REALLY MAKE IT A QUITE ABSTRACT IF THAT'S FITS IN MORE WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING 
INSTEAD OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES JUST IF YOU LOOK AT IT STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S A BIT YEAH 
IT DOESN'T IS QUITE FIT IN WITH THE TRENDY WELL OBVIOUSLY IT DOES IF THAT'S THE CURRENT THEM 
BUT MAY MAYBE WE COULD GO MORE DIRECTLY I DON'T KNOW 
BUT INITIALLY I DUNNO 
I THINK IF WE JUST SORT OF TONE IT DOWN A BIT 
YEAH AND LIKE NOT NOT YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
I DIDN'T FOR THE FIRST ONE 
BUT I HAVE NOW 
YEAH 
UH HOPEFULLY 
PROJECT DOCUMENTS I THINK 
OKAY 
'KAY 
KINETIC YEAH 
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A BACKUP 
OR DO WE JUST 
I THINK MAYBE WE COULD JUST GO FOR THE KINETIC ENERGY AND 
BE BOLD AND INNOVATIVE AND HOPE THIS WORKS AND WELL HOPE THAT IT WORKS 
I THINK YEAH 
I THINK ONE 
I I THINK WE SHOULD JUST LIKE TAKE UH ADVANTAGE OF LIKE USING THIS TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL 
GO FOR IT 
IT COULD BE FULLY KINETIC ENERGY 
YEAH 
SO EVERYONE HAPPY WITH THAT 
YEAH 
UM IT WAS WHETHER WE WENT FOR THE SIMPLE THE REGULAR OR THE ADVANCED CHIP 
AND THAT LINKED IN WITH WHAT BUTTONS WE WOULD GONNA HAVE SO 
YEAH IT WAS IS THAT WAS WITHOUT THE L. C. D. 
SO THAT MEANS WE'RE NOT DOING THE ADVANCED 
SO IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE WANTED THE SCROLL BUTTONS ARE JUST THE PUSH BUTTONS 
UH SO THAT'S THE SIMPLE 
YEAH POSSIBLY 
SO IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE THE REGULAR CHIP THAT WE'RE GOING TO AND 
SO IT'S A MEDIUM 
SO REGULAR CHIP 
REGULAR SORRY 
REGULAR CHIP 
LIGHTING 
YEAH IF WE BECAUSE OF THE LIGHTING THAT WE'VE DECIDED TO PUT IN AS WELL 
SO THE 
I THINK THIS IS JUST LIKE GONNA BE THE A VERY OUTER CASE WHICH WE WILL DECIDE ON RUBBER 
RUBBER 
YEAH 
PLASTIC RUBBER COAT 
INTERCHANGEABLE YEAH 
STILL GOING FOR THAT 
YEAH 
YOUR SCREEN 
WAS IT 
OUCH 
THE POWER 
VOLUME 
MY YEAH 
TONE CONTRAST AND THINGS 
THAT'S A BIT 
YEAH IT WAS MINIMA WELL IT WASN'T THE L 
YEAH 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
YEAH AND SURELY THAT WOULD BE LIKE QUITE SPECIFIC TO THE INDIVIDUAL TELEVISION SO 
MM 
I THINK MOST OF THAT COMES LIKE IN THE I INDIVIDUAL TELEVISION SET ITSELF DOESN'T IT 
I'M SURE IT HAS ITS OWN BUTTONS AS YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO HAVE TO ONE REMOTE 
YEAH 
SO WE'RE JUST GOING FOR POWER CHANNELS VOLUME 
MM 
I'VE 
YEAH THAT'S IT 
WE CAN JUST GO FOR MAKE IT A SELLING POINT THAT IT IS JUST THE BASIC 
YEAH UH I BRILLIANT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UM I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE WHOLE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE ASPECT 
ARE WE USING SO THAT WAS THE MOST POPULAR THING THAT CAME UP OUT OF YOUR MARKET RESEARCH 
I TH I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP IT THAT RATHER THAN MOVING IT ANIMALS OR SOMETHING 
BECAUSE EVEN IF THAT MAY NOT SEEM OBVIOUS TO SEE IF THAT'S WHAT THE SURVEYS BROUGHT IT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO ALONG WITH THAT 
UM SO I SUPPOSE THAT'LL COME OUT IN OUR DEV DESIGN DEVELOPMENT 
BUT YOU'RE HAPPY TO GO AHEAD WITH THE FRUIT AND VEG 
Y YEAH 
WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THIS DOES YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TRICKY 
A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER 
HM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE 
LIKE PLASTIC WITH RUBBER KIND OF ON TOP 
WELL THERE'S THERE IS A CERTAIN PHONE THAT HAS LIKE A RUBBER CASING B LIKE A NOKIA IT IS 
IT'S YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THE 
BACKUP 
YEAH 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD YEAH 
MAYBE WE COULD YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT UM SOLAR POWER MA MAYBE NOT WORKING INDOORS BUT A LOT OF CALCULATORS YEAH HAVE SOLAR POWER 
SO MAYBE THAT COULD BE INCORPORATED SO 
YEAH 
D D THOSE CALCULATORS YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I SUPPOSE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THANKS 
OH 
IT'S NOT IN MY SCREEN 
WHY 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHY 
OH OKAY 
SO IT THAT ONE 
UM I'M JUST GONNA GO THROUGH THE INTERFACE CONCEPT WITH YOUS NOW 
UH FIRST OF ALL I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT A USER INTERFACE IS 
IT'S THE ASPECTS OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM WHICH CAN BE SEEN OR OTHERWISE PERCEIVED FOR EXAMPLE HEARD OR FELT MAYBE OR BY THE HUMAN USER 
AND IT'S ALSO THE COMMANDS THAT THE USER USES TO CONTROL ITS OPERATION AND TO INPUT DATA 
UM THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF USER INTERFACES 
THERE'S THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE WHICH EMPHASISES THE EASE OF PICTURES FOR OUTPUT AND A POINTING DEVICE FOR EXAMPLE A MOUSE FOR INPUT CONTROL 
SO THAT'S SORT OF LIKE THE SCROLL THING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
YEAH 
I'M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THE PICTURES THAT MAYBE THAT'S AN AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
OR MAYBE IT'S 
THE THE BUTTONS OR PICTURES OR SOMETHING 
DO YOU THINK IT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO YOU MUST FOR THE GRAPHICAL USER YOU MUST NEED SOME KIND OF PRESENTATION FOR THE GRAPHICS 
LIKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO I THINK IT'S TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL SYMBOLS THAT ARE IN THE THAT'S IN THE BUTTONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND PRO 
WELL IT COULD BE A WEE SCROLLER THING AND SOMETHING COULD COME UP ON THE SCREEN 
YEAH 
BUT UM 
I THINK WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THE COMMAND INTERFACE ANYWAY TO MAKE IT MORE SIMPLISTIC 
BUT THE WE COULD INCORPORATE SOME OF THE GRAPHICAL USER UM POINTS IS NO JUST TO MAKE IT UM UM NICER TO LOOK AT MAYBE 
LIKE I CAN'T THINK OF AN EXAMPLE BUT 
SORT OF LIKE LITTLE PICTURES RATHER THAN 
LIKE A LITTLE SOUND 
INSTEAD OF SAYING VOLUME LIKE A LITTLE SPEAKER OR SOMETHING 
YEAH SOMETHING YOU 
YEAH M PERHA YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE 
UM THE C UH WE'VE DECIDED THAT THE COMMAND INTERFACE WOULD BE THE MOST USEFUL FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IT WOULD BE LESS COMPLICATED AND THE CONTROLS WOULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY 
UM THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE CHEAPER TO DESIGN IS THAT WE'D HAVE MORE MONEY ON THE BUDGET IT 
UM TARGET THE DESIGN AREA OF THE INTERFACE 
YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE TRENDY AND ORIGINAL 
WE'LL HAVE MORE MONEY IF WE KEEP IT SIMPLE 
YEAH 
SEEING AS IT'S QUITE A NEW TECHNOLOGY 
UM 
WE WE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE'RE DESIGNING OUR M MORE USER FRIENDLY REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT A LOT OF INTERFACES CONSIST OF A CLUTTER OF BUTTONS THAT UM THAT OTHER FUNCTIONS COLOURS AND FORMS AREN'T ALWAYS HELPFUL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THAT ALL INTERFACES ARE DIFFERENT 
SO UM THAT DOESN'T IMPROVE THE EASE OF THE PRODU PRODUCT AS WE NEED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND 
AND MAYBE LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES OF OTHER INTERFACES THAT CAN BE TOO COMPLICATED FOR PEOPLE TO USE 
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS 
MM 
BUT UM 
YEAH 
IN THE PHONE THAT I WAS THINKING OF AS WELL WHEN YOU CHANGE THE UM COVERS OF AT THE 
THE LITTLE BUTTONS THAT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT CONTRO CONTROL STUFF OR BEHIND THE RUBBER 
SO YOU CAN CHANGE THE BUTTONS WHEN YOU'RE CHANGING THE FOCUS 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
'CAUSE IT'S JUST THE WEE CONTROL YEAH THING THAT'S BEHIND IT 
SO 
I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE ON ONE COLOUR 
EACH FACE COULD HAVE ITS OWN COLOUR OF BUTTONS MAYBE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S EVERYTHING THEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OR BANANA SHAPED 
YEAH 
WHERE DO YOU HAVE TO SAVE IT IT 
OKAY 
JUST ESCAPE I THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HOPE SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I DON YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S FOR THE LIGHTING YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH PLASTIC COAT 
WE DECIDED ON THE COMPONENT 
I I I'M SORRY I'VE LOST MY UM 
POWERPOINT THING SO I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S C IT'S THE COMPONENT 
THE COMMAND INTER 
THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
I THINK THAT AS WELL WE HAVEN'T REALLY MADE ANY DECISIONS ABOUT 
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT THE CLUSTER OF BUTTON FUNCTIONS COLOURS AND FORMS IN THE IN CONSISTENT USE 
LIKE WHAT WHAT OUR IDEAS TO COMBAT THESE PROBLEMS 
YOU KNOW HOW UM DIFFERENT INTERFACES ARE VERY DIFFERENT 
AND CAN BE CONFUSING BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERENCE AND BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT CLUSTERS OF BUTTONS THAT THEY HAVE 
WE HAVEN'T REALLY DECIDED WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT 
WELL IT'S JUST UM 
W WHERE WHERE SHALL WE LOCATE THE BUTTONS 
WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONS WE SHALL WE HAVE 
IS PRETTY JUST JUST THE BASIC BUTTON FUNCTIONS 
YEAH 
YEAH EACH TELEVISION 
YOU DON'T CHANGE THAT OFTEN YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT W IT WOULD SEEM SILLY IF WE'D HAVING ANYTHING ELSE JUST HAVE AN IDEA BUTTON THOUGH 
DO YOU KNOW 
BUT WE 
YEAH 
THAT COULD BE A SALES PITCH 
SIMPLE AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT I 
WHAT I WAS THINKING WHAT DO YOUS THINK OF THIS 
UM HAVING THE NUMBERS KIND OF LOOK INTO A BUNCH OF GRAPES BUT YOU KNOW LIKE PURPLE AND KIND OF IN A TRIANGLE 
LIKE GRAPES 
LIKE THAT'S KIND OF FORTY OR SOMETHING 
THAT'S JUST 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YES 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
LIKE THE SKIN 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO THE ACTUAL REMOTE WOULD BE HARD PLASTIC AND THE CASINGS RUBBER 
OKAY 
AND THE BUTTONS OBVIOUSLY OR RUBBER 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
I GUESS IT'S A BIT SCARY 'CAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE 
SO IT SEEMS WE'D HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH ON IT 
OR I DUNNO IF YOU COULD HAVE A BATTERY PACK 
YEAH SO THERE'S THERE IS A ONE BATTERY BECAUSE MOST REMOTES SO TWO BATTERIES I BELIEVE 
SO IF IT WAS RUNNING OFF OF ONE BATTERY AS A 
RIGHT 
ALTHOUGH IT NEEDS SOME LIGHT DOESN'T IT 
SO IF WE'RE DOING YEAH 
IF WE'RE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK SOMETIMES IT'S JUST SHOVED UNDER UNDER A CUSHION AND YEAH 
YEAH 
SO IT'S JUST DRAF GRAPHICAL FOR THE POINTING ASPECT 
THE INFRARED IS LIKE THAT'S CONSIDERED A 
OKAY 
SO WHEN IT SAYS POINTING DEVICE THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
I THINK IF WE GO WITH THE UM DESIGN PLATE THING WE'LL HAVE TO 
JUST BECAUSE OF COLOUR CLASHING AND IF WE WANTED TO USE AND 
AND WE MIGHT I MEAN DEPENDING ON WHAT COMES OUT OF THE DESIGN WE MIGHT HAVE TO STICK TO JUST BLACK BUTTONS 
YOU MEAN DIFFERENT COLOURS FOR THE LIGHTING OR 
MM-HMM 
UH I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
WELL YOU 
UH SO YOU'RE PICTURING THE LIGHT IS COMING FROM THE BACK 
I KINDA PICTURED IT IS KIND OF COMING FROM THE SIDES AND LIGHTING IT UP FRONTWARDS 
BUT BUT I GUESS YOU MEAN FROM THE BACK 
OKAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
OH 
YEAH 
THEY THEY INSERT OVER 
OKAY 
IT 
OKAY SO THAT MY TURN THEN 
ALRIGHT 
I HAVE A SHORTER REPORT FOR YOU TODAY 
UM TO TAKE A WHILE TO GET THIS UH 
OH 
OH 
THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT 
OKAY SO UM THIS REPORT IS ABOUT UH TREND WATCHING 
UM BASICALLY SO WE CAN LIVE UP TO OUR OUR UH PURPOSE OF HAVING A VERY FASHIONABLE REMOTE CONTROL 
SORRY 
THERE WE GO 
UM SO JUST SO YOU KNOW MY METHOD WAS MAINLY WEB WEB BASED RESEARCH THIS TIME AROUND 
I ALSO SPOKE WITH FASHION EXPERTS IN MILAN NEW YORK AND PARIS 
AND I LOOKED AT THE DESIGN REPORTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS HERE AT REAL REMOTE 
UM JUST SO C WE CAN WORK OFF OF THEM IS HOW FASHIONS HAVE CHANGED 
UM SO I'LL LIST THE OTHER MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS THAT I'VE COME ACROSS 
UM AND THEY THEY'RE EACH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ON THAT COMES AFTER IT 
UH THE FIRST ONE IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL 
UM THIS SHOULD BE OUR PRIORITY AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING 
THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT A REMOTE SH THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
SO I THINK WE'VE DONE A LOT OF TALKING ABOUT THAT JUST WITH LIGHTING AND THE BUTTONS AND THE 
FACE PLATES 
UM SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP ON TRACK WITH THAT 
AND THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASY TO USE 
IS PRETTY BASIC THERE 
AND THE RECENT FASHION UPDATE UH ACCORDING TO FASHION WATCHERS IN PARIS AND MILAN 
SO THAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE 
UM ALSO IN CONTRA UH IN CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR THE FEEL OF THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY 
AGAIN WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT WITH RUBBER VERSUS HARD PLASTIC BUTTONS 
UM 
SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES HERE 
UM OF COURSE SO WE WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE PERSONAL FACE PLATES IN THIS MEETING AND I'D LIKE TO STICK TO THAT 
THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLE THEMES I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO WORK FOR US 
IT SOUNDS SOMETHING THAT YOU'D USE ON KITCHENWARE 
I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANNA DO IT ON REMOTES 
IT COULD BE ONE OF THE OPTIONS 
MAYBE FOR THE TELEVISION THAT PEOPLE HAVE ON THEIR KITCHEN 
UM THE TEMPORARY LIGHT UP IDEA SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE GONNA STICK TO THAT 
AND THEN UH TYING IN A TRENDY LOOK WITH USER FRIENDLINESS 
MM-HMM 
IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO IT'S EVERYWHERE 
SO MAYBE WE I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PURSES WITH OLIVES ON THEM YOU KNOW 
BUT I I THINK I THINK IF WE STICK TO T. V. BASED YOU KNOW MAYBE T. V. SHOWS OR 
OR COLOUR SCHEMES 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
THE 
THE ESSENCE OF STRAWBERRY 
YEAH 
I GUESS YEAH 
ONE THING I WAS THINKING THOUGH SO I DUNNO IF YOU ALL REMEMBER FROM OUR KICKOFF MEETING WE TALKED ABOUT OUR FAVOURITE ANIMALS 
SO MAYBE THERE COULD BE ANIMAL BASED YOU KNOW 
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A HOUSE CAT 
OR OR A DOG 
UM THAT MIGHT BE GETTING YOU KNOW TO SPECIFIC AND WE SHOULD SEE WHAT THE SUCCESS OF THE FIRST FACE PLATES OR 
BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND 
AND DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS 
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD 
OKAY 
THERE YOU GO 
HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN SAVING YOUR POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS TO THE OKAY 
THE POWERPOINT 
SO 
SO IF IT'S NOT WORKING THEY JUST HAVE TO SHAKE IT A BIT AND THAT REVITALISES IT 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
UH SO REGULAR NOT SIMPLE 
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT 
THINK IT WAS CALLED COMMAND INTERFACE 
COMMAND INTERFACE 
MM-HMM 
THAT WAS ON UM 
ONE OF MY PRESENTATIONS 
BUT HOW OFTEN IT WAS USED 
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT 
I W 
SHOULD I BRING IT UP 
THE CH T 
SCREEN SETTINGS WAS SAID UM ZERO POINT FIVE TIMES AN HOUR 
SO TW TWICE EVERY ONCE EVERY TWO HOURS 
UM AND IT WAS CONSIDERED A ONE POINT FIVE RELEVANCE ON A SCALE OF TEN 
THAT'S BRIGHTNESS COLOUR TONE ALL THAT 
MM-HMM 
THE OTHER ONE WAS AUDIO SETTINGS 
MONO STEREO PITCH 
I MEAN I SOMETIMES IS THAT 
SOME T. V. S WILL HAVE THE OPTION OF LIKE LIVING ROOM STYLE MOVIE STYLE 
UM AND THAT THEY SAY THAT'S USED ZERO POINT EIGHT TIMES AN HOUR WHICH IS ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT HIGH 
LIKE ALMOST ONCE IN HERE 
UM RELEVANCE OF TWO 
WELL THAT DIDN'T SUM UP ON MINE 
OH 
YEAH I GUESS THAT IT AFFECTS THE MARKETING 'CAUSE IT 
MM IT IS A GOOD SALES PLOY TO SAY AREN'T YOU ANNOYED WITH REMOTE CONTROLS THAT HAVE ALL THESE BUTTONS 
THIS ONE HAS CHANNEL VOLUME AND YOUR CHANNE AND YOUR POWER 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
NOW DO YOU GUYS NEED WANT AN IDEA OF HOW MANY UH ARE YOU GONNA COME UP WITH CASING IDEAS 
LIKE F FIVE DIFFERENT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YOU CAN HAVE SOME FUN WITH THE BUTTONS IT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
I GUESS WHAT YOU I IDEALLY YOU'D KIND OF THINK OF AGE MARKETS AS WELL 
SO IT'S A SOMETHING THAT WILL YOU KNOW PEOPLE TO THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS 
SOMETHING THAT YOUR GRANNY WOULD WANT AN HOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
UM AND INTERNATIONAL TASTES AS WELL SO 
NOT EASY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
HERE WE GO 
ALRIGHT THE AGENDA FOR THE UH 
ALRIGHT 
UM THE AGENDA FOR THIS MEETING IS UM WE'LL INITIALLY HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION BY OUR TWO DESIGNERS 
AND THEN WE WILL EVALUATE IT GIVEN THE CRITERIA THAT UM THAT WE GIVE 
GIVE IT 
AND UM TALK ABOUT OUR FINANCES WHETHER WE WERE UNDER OR OVER OUR BUDGET 
I HAVE A UM A SPREADSHEET WHERE WE CAN CALCULATE UM OUR PRICES FOR EVERY ASPECT OF OF WHAT WE'VE MADE GIVEN OUR OPTIONS 
AND UM EVALUATE THE PRODUCT AS A GROUP 
AND UM 
SO FIRST WE'LL HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION 
DO YOU NEED THE UM POWERPOINT FOR THIS 
ALRIGHT 
NO 
A MANGO 
OKAY 
OH 
OKAY 
OOPS 
YEAH 
NOTICE YOU HAVE A NUMBER TEN BUTTON 
OKAY 
NO PROBLEM 
OH 
OH 
YOU PRESS A PLUS BUTTON 
OH OKAY 
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT KIND BEFORE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
I 
BUT 
WOULD YOU HAVE TO GO ZERO PLUS ONE OF YOU WANTED TO GO TO CHANNEL ONE OR TWO 
YEAH BUT I MEAN IF YOU PRESS IT'LL GO TO THAT CHANNEL RIGHT AWAY 
'CAUSE YOU GOTTA PRESS THE PLUS AFTERWARDS 
YEAH I KNOW BUT IF IF I WANNA GO TO SAY NUMBER LIKE SIXTY FIVE CHANNEL SIXTY FIVE 
IF I PRESS THE SIX IT'LL GO TO CHANNEL SIX 
AND THEN I'LL PRESS THE PLUS AND THEN IT'LL GO TO SIX AND THEN PUT THE FIVE AND IT'LL GO TO SIXTY FIVE 
I TH 
UM 
YEAH IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM 
BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING LIKE AS LONG AS WE REALISE THAT'S WHAT IT'LL DO 
YEAH 
C. AND V. 
RIGHT WHERE UM WHERE'S THE POWER BUTTON 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
ERGONOMIC DEFINITELY ERGONOMIC 
THE SPON YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT OF A STRESS BALL FEEL 
YES 
I WOULD 
MY GOODNESS 
THERE YOU GO 
GENEVIEVE 
YEAH 
AND SOMETHING HMM 
OH RIGHT 
YEAH 
IT LOOKS MORE 
THINK LIKE VANILLA AND BANANA WOULD 
OKAY YEAH 
KINDA CHRISTMAS YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
COOL 
ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
GOOD WORK EVERYONE 
ALRIGHT 
AND SO NOW THAT WE'VE WE HAVE A PROTOTYPE UH WE NEED TO GO OVER THE FINANCES AND SEEING IF THIS PROTOTYPE MATCHES UH WHAT OUR BUDGET CAN HANDLE 
SO I HAVE 
SOMETHING I'M GOING TO 
OH WAIT A MINUTE 
DO YOU NEED TO DO A PRESENTATION FIRST 
YEAH 
I'M GONNA CHECK THAT IT FOR A SECOND 
WHAT TIME IS IT ANYW 
OH YEAH SORRY YOU'RE RIGHT 
EVALUATION CRITERIA IS NEXT ONE LINE 
YEAH 
JUST PRESS UM FUNCTION EIGHT AGAIN 
AND THEN AGAIN I THINK 
NO MORE TIME 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OH 
YEAH 
THE LIKE AS A LITTLE BIT MORE PLAYFUL 
UH DEFINITELY DIFFERENT YEAH 
UH YOU WERE ONLY GIVEN RED AND BLACK 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S MANGO 
IT'S MANGO 
YEAH 
I WOULD SAY TWO 
PERSONALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'D SAY MAYBE THERE 
YEAH WE WANT IT SIMPLE 
YEAH 
I THINK SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
THE 
THE PLUS NUMBER THING 
YEAH COLOUR WILL DEFINITELY BE A FACTOR 
I THINK THAT THE LOGO COULD BE SMALLER 
AND MAYBE NOT SUCH A PROMINENT WAY 
MAYBE LOOK AT THE BOTTOM KIND OF 
UH IT JUST HAD TO BE IN THERE I GUESS 
I LIKE THE PEOPLE IF IT BEING LIKE A BIG GLOB IN YOUR HAND 
MAYBE IF THE BOTTOM WAS JUST SORT OF FLAT AND THEN THE REST IS LIKE 
ROUND 
IT WOULD STILL BE COMFORTABLE I THINK 
WE C WE COULD HANDLE IT I THINK 
AH IT'D FALL OVER ALL THE TIME THOUGH 
IT'D BE ANNOYING 
'KAY WE'RE DONE DESIGNING 
COME ON 
I THINK IT WAS ANOTHER COLOUR AND IT WAS LIKE I THINK IT'D LOOK OKAY 
I THINK MAYBE A TWO 
SURE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
DURABLE 
BUT YOU'RE OUR MARKETING EXPERT 
OH 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
I WOULD GIVE IT A TWO STILL THOUGH 
MM 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE HAVE THE ALARM SYSTEM 
I THOUGHT THE LIGHT FROM THE INSIDE WAS GONNA LIGHT UP 
OR OR WAS IT GONNA MAKE A NOISE 
YOU PRESS THE BUTTON IT MAKES A NOISE RIGHT 
YEAH 
AWESOME 
AWESOME 
I THOUGH W IT WAS GONNA MAKE A NOISE 
OKAY 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH TOTALLY 
NO PROBLEM MM 
TOTALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH SO IT'S JUST LIKE CHANNEL SIX SIX ENTER 
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESS ZEROS 
AND THEN LIKE TWELVE ENTER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK SO 
IT'S LIKE RIGHT ON THE 
YOUR THUMB MIGHT GET A LITTLE BIT UH 
YEAH 
BUT IT IS SOFT 
AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THE UM 
THE POWERPOINT SLIDE THING SAID WOULD BE GOOD FOR R. S. I. SO MAYBE IT IS ABOUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES WE DID 
WELL YEAH THE COLOURS ARE YELLOW AND GREY 
SO IT COULD BE GREY ON THE BANANA ON 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
HM 
I WOULD SAY SO 
BUT MAYBE MORE LIKE TWO 'CAUSE THERE'S NO LIKE PICTURES OF FRUIT IT'S JUST SORT OF NAMING TO BUY A FRUIT 
WITH THE WITH THE COLOURS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S FASHIONABLE IN ITSELF TO HAVE INTERCHANGEABLE PLATES 
BE LIKE 
YEAH 
MAYBE IF IT WAS SCENTED 
YEAH WE HAVE MONEY FOR THAT 
UM 
ALRIGHT SO BASED ON THIS EVALUATION DO WE AVERAGE THEM OUT SORTA THING 
OH 
I WOULD SAY TWO 
NO POINT NINE OR SOMETHING 
I DON'T KNOW THESE THINGS 
UM BETWEEN ONE AND TWO 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
I'M ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW 
YEAH IT IS ONE POINT NINE 
OH 
GO HEATHER PAULS 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT NOW WITH THAT OVER AND DONE WITH OUR NEXT STEP IS IT IS IF WE ARE UNDER BUDGET 
AND UM MY COMPUTER'S FROZEN 
AND NOW IT'S NOT 
OKAY 
SO 
UM IN OUR SHARED FOLDER IF EVERYONE COULD GO THERE RIGHT NOW UM 
I'M GOING TO UM STEAL A CABLE 
UM IT'S IT'S UM 
IT'S AN EXCEL FILE 
OH 
YEAH 
'KAY THERE WE GO 
UM PRODUCTION COSTS 
AND UM I HAVE TO ACCESS THAT AS WELL 
ONE MOMENT 
'KAY SO FAR I'VE ADDED WHAT I THINK OR WHAT IS GOING ON 
GREAT 
IT'S BLINKING AT UM 
IT'S LOCKED FOR EDITING 
READ ONLY 
I'M GONNA OPEN UP A SECOND ONE THEN 'CAUSE IT'S LOCKED FOR EDITING 
I HAVE THE ORIGINAL IN MY UM 
MY EMAIL ACCOUNT 
I DUNNO 
NO 
NO I WAS HOPING THAT YOU GUYS COULD 
UM THERE WE GO 
OKAY HERE WE GO 
SO WE NEED TO TALLY UP HOW MUCH ARE WE OUR PRODUCT WILL BE COSTING 
SO UM IF YOU CAN LOOK UP TO THE SCREEN 
UM THE LARGE SCREEN UH I GUESS LOOKING AT YOUR OWN IT AND TELLING ME WHICH ONE YOU THINK 
OKAY WE'RE USING KINETIC WHICH IS QUITE A LARGE EXPENSE AT THREE EUROS 
UM WE'RE USING A REGULAR CHIP 
UM IT'S CUR IT'S DOUBLE CURVED AS ITS CURVED ALL AROUND 
THAT'S ANOTHER THREE 
WE'RE ALREADY AT FIVE 
UM WE'RE USING PLASTIC AND RUBBER IS 
GOOD THING PLASTIC AS FAR WE'RE AT EIGHT 
UM 
SO 
YEAH 
I GUESS WE SHOULD DO IT JUST FOR ONE KIND 
SO IT'S LIKE SPECIAL COLOUR WELL WE'LL HAVE TWO COLOURS RIGHT 
WELL ONE COLOUR FOR THE CASE ONE COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS 
SO WE CAN 
UM WE HAVE PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE SO THAT'S INEXPENSIVE 
AND UM WE HAVE A SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE BUTTON AND WE ALSO HAVE A SPECIAL FORM 
AND A SPECIAL MATERIAL 
WHICH PUTS IS JUST BARELY UNDER BUDGET 
HURRAY 
YEAH 
GOOD WORK GUYS 
SO UM OUR OPERATING COST US TWELVE TWENTY EUROS 
AWESOME 
AND BACK TO OUR POWERPOINT 
SO WE'VE 
'KAY 
YES WE ARE 
SO WE NEED TO DO A PRODUCT EVALUATION AGAIN WHICH IS PROBABLY UM 
I DUNNO 
A DIFFERENT EXTENSION OF A 
HMM 
YEAH 'CAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LEADERSHIP TEAMWORK 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT SO UM 
DO YOU GUYS FEEL LIKE THERE WAS ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 
PUSHED FOR CREATIVITY 
YE OKAY 
SO IT'D BE LIKE 
AND MORE TIME AND 
MATERIALS 
BUT YOU WERE ALLOWED M CREATIVITY 
I THINK SO SO LIKE BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE CREATIV 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
GREAT 
LEADERSHIP 
SO THIS UM BEING LIKE GUYS DO YOU LIKE UM 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OOP OKAY 
TEAMWORK 
I THINK WE WORKED GREAT AS A TIME 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT HOW WERE OR MINUS 
WE NEEDED MORE PLAY DOH COLOURS 
YEAH 
BUT OVER 
EVERYTHING ELSE WAS SATISFACTORY 
SO THAT GOOD 
YEAH 
NEW IDEAS FOUND 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
EACH OTHER'S 
MM 
OKAY 
WELL WITH THAT ACHIEVED OUR LAST SLIDE IS OUR CLOSING SLIDE 
YES OUR COSTS ARE WITHIN BUDGET 
IT'S EVALUATED GENERALLY POSITIVELY 
AND UM DON'T FORGET TO COMPLETE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY 
THEN WE CELEBRATE IN SUCH A WAY THAT I HAVE AN IDEA 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY BYE 
OKAY 
UM YEAH 
I JUST GOT A FEW SLIDES SO SHOW THEM 
THANK YOU 
DO YOU WANT TO PRESENT IT 
YEAH HERE WE ARE 
MANGO SHAPE 
THE L. E. D. 
SO IT'S PALM HELD 
YEAH 
YOU JUST NEED THE NIGHT 
SO ONE PLUS ONE WOULD BE ELEVEN OR 
YEAH BECAUSE IF YOU IN YOUR AVERAGE UM REMOTE IF YOU PRESS ONE TWICE YOU JUST GO TO UM OUR UH SAY YOU WANTED CHANNEL TWELVE 
YOU PRESS ON AND THEN YOU GO TO CHANNEL ONE AND THEN TWO THEN YOU'D JUST GO TO CHANNEL TWO INSTEAD OF TWELVE 
SO IF YOU DID LIKE ONE PLUS TWO YOU COULD GO TO CHANNEL TWELVE OR TWO PLUS TWO IS CHANNEL TWENTY TWO 
OH 
WELL I DON'T MIND WE CAN FURTHER DEFINE THAT 
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT'D BE A PROBLEM THAT IT WENT TO CHANNEL SIX FIRST ONE LIKE IN THE WAY TO CHANNEL SIXTY FIVE 
BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S NOT AS SNAPPY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IF YOU DON'T PUT IT 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
UM 
AND CHANNEL WHICH IS SO YOU COULD JUST GO LIKE THAT WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT LIKE 
IT'S THE BIGGER R. 
SO IT'S JUST LIKE 
WE DECI 
YEAH UM WE WENT FOR LIKE A A CIRCULAR DESIGN FOR THE NUMBERS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT'S KIND OF A MORE NATURAL MOVEMENT THAN JUST GOING LIKE THAT WITH YOUR THUMB 
UH E ERGONOMICS ARE ALL CONSIDERED 
YEAH 
IT COULD CAUSE ANOTHER TYPE OF REPETITIVE STRESS INJURY THOUGH 
BUT YEAH NO I MEAN IT'S A DIFFERENT MOVEMENT SO YEAH 
UM AND THE FEEL OF IT I MEAN WE'VE MADE THIS OUT OF PLAY DOH 
WHICH IS REPRESENTING THE YOU KNOW THE RUBBER AND THE SPONGY RUBBERNESS 
UM 'CAUSE IT WAS SAID BEFORE IN THE MATERIAL SPECIFICATION THAT THIS THI THIS ANTI R. S. I. UM MATERIAL IS OFTEN USED IN STRESS BALLS SO THIS HAS GOT A YOU KNOW A BIT OF GIVE IT IT 
AND IT JUST FEELS FEELS DIFFERENT 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO FEEL IT YOURSELVES 
HOW IT FITS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND 
THANKS 
AND YOU 
OKAY SO FOR THE COLOURS WE WERE PRESENTED WITH UM A LIMITED RANGE OF COLOURS FOR THIS PROTOTYPE 
BUT WE'RE THINKING THAT SEEING AS WE'RE HAVING IT IN INTERCHANGEABLE CASING ANYWAY 
THAT THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A REPRESENTATION OF THE TRUE COLOURS THAT WE WOULD NECESSARILY USE 
OR THE COMBINATION 
UM AND WE'RE THINKING TO CARRY ON WITH THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE THEME 
THE COLOUR UM COMBINATION JUST COULD JUST BE NAMED AFTER DIFFERENT FRUIT LIKE BANANA COULD BE BLACK AND YELLOW 
WATERMELON RED AND GREEN OR VANILLA MIGHT BE THE MOST POPULAR IF IT JUST UH BLENDS IN MORE SETTLED CREAM INSTEAD OF THE OTHERS ARE ALL A BIT GARISH 
BANANA'S MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR COLOUR SCHEME LIKE THE COMPANY THE YELLOW AND BLACK 
SO THAT FOR CORPORATE IDENTITY THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE MOST STRENGTH 
I MEAN WATERMELON YOU KNOW UM PROBABLY APPEALING TO THE YEAH SEASONAL 
APPLE GREEN BROWN MORE KINDA TRENDY YOU KNOW KHAKI 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM YEAH WE THOUGHT OF THE COMPONENTS IT WAS DEFINITELY UM A FOCUS OF ERGONOMICS AND JUST A SINGLE HA HANDHELD DEVICE 
I MEAN YOU DON'T NEED TO USE BOTH HANDS ONE HAND TO HOLD THIS AND TYPE IN WITH THE OTHER YOU CAN JUST USE YOUR THUMB 
UM SO WE SAID THE RUBBER'S PROBABLY USED FOR COMFORT AND ANTI R. S. I. AND THAT'S ABOUT IT 
MM-HMM 
MM GO 
FEEL I THINK 
WE'VE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE RUBBER COATING AND 
YEAH 
I THINK THE COLOUR HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT 
I MEAN THE THE COLOURS WE WERE GIVEN FOR MAKING THE PROTOTYPE AREN'T THE COLOURS THAT I THINK WE WOULD'VE NECESSARILY CHOSEN 
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF UH UH AT ALL SLEEK RED BLACK AND YELLOW AND ORANGE 
UM 
BUT IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IN LIKE A IS JUST A MAYBE UH A KIND OF PALE METALLIC Y FINISH OR SOMETHING 
WELL I KNOW KNOW IT'S FOR RUBBER 
I MEAN DIFF IF YOU CAN VISUALISE THIS ONE NICE COLOURS I THINK IT WOULD LOOK QUITE FANCY 
UH WELL POTATO MANGO FRUIT AND VEG 
POTATO'S FINE 
POTATO'S FINE 
YEAH 
TOTALLY 
IT'S REALLY ADAPTABLE 
FOR THE 
FANCY 
I UH TWO THREE 
YEAH AND THE EASE OF THE RUBBER 
FOR THE ANTI R. S. I. 
THE L. E. D. S ISN'T PARTICULARLY INNOVATIVE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY SCROLL BUTTONS IT'S ALL PUSHBUTTONS 
THERE'S AN L. C. D. CONTROL SO IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE REST OF THE MARKET IT'S SORT OF PROBABLY HALFWAY 
IN SOME ASPECTS IT IS LIKE WE SAID 
YEAH 
THOUGH IT WAS OUR SPECIFICATION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND PERHAPS THE TRAINING NO BUT 
MM 
AGAIN I THINK THE COLOUR COMES INTO THIS 
OKAY 
NOT IN 
DON'T WORRY 
I SUPPOSE I'VE GOT QUITE BIG HANDS 
THING IS LIKE THAT IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE PARTICULARLY 
YEAH 
OH YEAH IT'S LESS UM WHAT'S THE UH 
UH IT'S GOT HIGHER CENTRE OF GRAVITY LIKE THAT 
I WOULD DEFINITELY GO FOR THAT RATHER THAN LIKE YOUR AVERAGE PLAIN OLD REMOTE LIKE THAT BUT DEFINITELY IN ANOTHER COLOUR I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THESE COLOURS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THE KINETIC ENERGY SHAKER STYLE Y WHOO OOH NO 
BUT YOU KNOW THOSE'LL BE FIRMLY ON 
MM YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
GOOD POINT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
DOES THIS PROTOTYPE MATCH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE AVERAGE USER 
YEAH 
BECAUSE YEAH BECAUSE THE MOST ACCESSIBLE BUTTONS ARE THE VOLUME AND THE AND THE CHANNEL CHANGING 
AND IT'S JUST YOU WON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK DOWN TO FIND THEM 
THEY'RE CLEARLY THERE EASY TO USE 
SIMPLE 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
IT 
YEAH L LIGHTS ON AND OR FLASH AS WELL 
BUT I MEAN IT'S NOT OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUS FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE PARTICULARLY IS AN ALARM 
YEAH 
BUT WHEN THE ALARM'S NOT YEAH 
IF YOU 
YEAH 
YOU COULD USE YEAH 
WELL THE THING IS IF IT WAS HAD AN ALARM SYSTEM I MEAN 
WHEN IT WHEN IT LIGHTS UP SO W I MEAN IT COULD LIGHT UP WHEN THE ALARM WENT 
BUT IF IT WAS HIDDEN UNDERNEATH THE CUSHION OR SOMETHING THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY POINT 
SO YOU CAN'T USE THE ALARM BUT IT WOULD LIGHT UP 
YEAH 
ALARM BUT YOU CAN'T USE AN ALARM INSIDE UH THE ALARM SYSTEM ITSELF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT W YEAH 
SORRY 
YEAH 
SORRY HEATHER 
THAT WASN'T VERY CLEAR 
YEAH I THINK JUST BECAUSE IT'S WE'VE DECIDED TO REDUCE IT DOWN TO THE BASIC BUTTONS I THINK THAT IN ITSELF MAKES IT AS MUCH EASIER TO USE 
MM 
AND OR SIXTY SIX ENTER Y 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD 
YEAH 
GOOD 
OH 
MM 
OH 
INJURY 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING 
WE MAY HAVE TO DO SOME MORE RESEARCH INTO OTHER STRAIN INJURIES THAT WE DON'T KNOW BUT 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
I THINK WE'RE GETTING THAT'S TRUE 
MM 
I THINK YEAH I THINK IT 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
I THINK THIS IS THE 
THE FACTOR THAT WE'VE BEEN LEAST SUCCESSFUL IN CONFRONTING 
YEAH 
FOR I THINK 
WELL I DON'T WHAT DO WHAT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
LIKE UM THE COLOUR SCHEME NAMES AND STUFF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT IS 
THE THING SO I THINK IF SOMEBODY SAW THAT AND YOU SAID WHAT WAS THAT INSPIRED FROM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D INSTANTLY SAY MANGO 
OH YEAH 
THERE WE GO 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT 
UM 
OKAY 
IT'S 
BETWEEN ONE AND TWO 
SO THAT'S PRETTY FANTASTIC 
MM 
IT SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE MORE AROUND TWO 
DO WE HAVE AN ONLINE CALCULATOR 
OKAY 
OH WOW 
WELL DONE 
WELL THAT'S EXCELLENT 
PRODUCTION COSTS 
IT SAYS IT 
I THINK IT JUST MEANS THAT WE CAN'T ADD ANY MORE TO IT NOW 
HAVE YOU HAVE YOU COMPLETED IT 
OH RIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
DOUBLE DOUBLE CURVED YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
IF 
CONGRATULATIONS GUYS 
OF THE ACTUAL PROJECT RATHER THAN THE PRODUCT 
A PROJECT 
SO SO YEAH 
SO WHA HOW WE ACTUALLY WENT ROUND UH ABOUT DOING IT 
I THINK WE WERE PUSHED 
I MEAN WE WEREN'T REALLY GIVEN A LOT OF TIME OR MATERIALS YEAH TO GO ABOUT OUR DESIGN TASK 
SO I THINK WE COULD'VE DONE WITH A BIT MORE TIME 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL WE WERE JUST LIMITED BY RESOURCES REALLY NEED LIKE IF WE HAD DECIDED TO USE THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
AND LIKE SOLAR POWER BACKUP AND EVERYTHING THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD THAT 
SO THAT DID LIMIT 
CREATIVITY 
JUST RESOURCES 
BUT YEAH 
THE FRUIT AND VEG IDEA 
YEAH WE DID 
WE'VE UH SEEING AS WE'VE COME OUT WITH WHAT WE INTENDED 
A PEAR UM A PRODUCT WITHIN THE BUDGET 
I THINK THAT'S A SIGN OF GOOD LEADERSHIP AND ALSO OUR PERSONAL COACH HELPED US ALONG THE WAY AS YOU KNOW 
I THINK IT'S BEEN FINE 
YEAH 
GOOD TIMING 
AND PROJECT MANAGER OF COURSE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
YEAH AND MORE PLAY DOH 'CAUSE THAT WAS ALL THE RED WE HAD 
SO EVEN IF WE WANTED TO MAKE A BIGGER PROTOTYPE WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
YEAH 
IT COULD BE REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR THE COMPUTER 
I THINK THE ONLY THING WAS HAVING TO REMEMBER IT YOU KNOW TO TICK THE KEYS BUT I THINK I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO STRUGGLED WITH THAT 
MM 
UH UM IT 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK WE'VE ALL LEARNT STUFF FROM EACH OTHER LIKE THE ON UM YEAH 
JUST ABOUT EACH DIFFERENT 
GET NEW IDEAS FROM EACH OTHER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SORRY 
OH YEAH 
WELL MM DID IT CAME INTO THE UNIT I DUNNO IF WE COUNTED THAT IN THE COSTS 
YES 
OH 
FANTASTIC 
OKAY BRILLIANT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
UM 
THIS IS WHAT WE COME UP WITH 
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE DESIGN 
IT'S UM BASED ON A MANGO 
YEAH 
AND WE 
YEAH 
AND WE HAVE THE COMPANY LOGO HERE AND THIS WILL BE THE 
INFRARED HERE AND THIS'LL BE THE POWER POINT THE ON OFF BUTTON KINDA YEAH 
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE LITTLE R. S 
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE POWER 
AND UH WE JUST HAVE A SIMPLE DESIGN 
WE WANTED TO ALL TO BE 
ACCESSIBLE FROM YOUR THUMB YEAH PALM HELD AND ALL THE 
BUTTONS ARE ACCESSIBLE FROM YOUR THUMB 
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
UH THAT WAS A MISTAKE WASN'T IT 
RIGHT ONE THAT'S A ZERO 
TAKE THAT ON OFF 
SORRY 
I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE NUMBERS 
AND THIS IS JUST IF YOU'VE GOT LIKE ELEVEN EURO TWELVE EURO 
THIRT THE PLUS 
YOU CAN GO IN THERE OR SOMETHING 
YOU PRESS THAT FIRST AND THEN YOU GO IN THERE YEAH 
WELL WE JUST THOUGHT WE HAVE ALL THE NUMBERS HERE SO WE WANTED SOMETHING REPRESENTATIVE OF NUMBERS LARGER THAN TEN AND 
SO THE PLUS AND THEN YEAH 
NO NO THE ALL THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ALL THESE NUMBERS 
THESE NUMBERS UM 
THESE NUMBERS ALL WORK INDEPENDENTLY UP TO NINE 
YEAH 
OH NO 
UH THE PLUS IS ONLY FOR IF YOU'RE GOING PAST THE NUMBER NINE 
YOU UP 
OH 
NO YOU PRESS THE PLUS FIRST 
I I WILL IT DOESN'T WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEE I WOULD'VE THOUGHT YOU PRESSED THE PLUS FIRST AND THEN THE SIX FIVE 
BUT SHE SAYS PLEASE PRESS WHICH WHAT DO YOU THINK IS SIMPLER 
IT'S A 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OOPS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
A CHANNEL 
JUST SO WE CAN FLICK 
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE LITTLE R. S 
YEAH SO IT'S ALL ACCESSIBLE 
WITHOUT M TAKING YOUR HAND OFF THE REMOTE 
AND IT MIGHT ACTUALLY HELP WITH THE REPETITIVE STRESS INJURY AS WELL 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OF PLAY DOH YEAH 
'CAUSE IT'D BE QUITE SUBTLE AND 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
THE POMEGRANATE'S KINDA GIRLY AND FUNKY KIND OF AND THEN THE VANILLA'S MORE FOR THE MORE SOPHISTICATED CUSTOMER WHO JUST WANTS SOMETHING THAT FITS IN WITH ALL DECOR 
YEAH 
MM 
WELL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH IS NOT VERY SLEEK AND WE DON'T WANNA GO FOR BLACK BECAUSE MOST REMOTE CONTROLS ARE BLACK OR GREY 
SO WE WANT TO TO BE STAND OUT THAT WAY ANYWAY 
YEAH 
A METALLIC Y FINISH WE WERE THINKING 
POLISHED 
OKAY 
YEAH 
WE WE WERE WE WERE THINKING ABOUT YEAH 
I W I'D SAY TWO I THINK 
FANCINESS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
I'LL GO FOR OTHER AS WELL 
NO 
WOULDN'T BE SIMPLE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH VERY 
I THINK ONE FOR THAT 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH THAT'S THE ONLY THING YEAH 
IT'S DEFINITELY 
YEAH 
BUT THE 
REMEMBER THE MANAGEMENT SAID THAT IT IT HAD TO BE PROMINENT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE JUST THOUGHT OF THEIR NOW 
WHAT WHERE'S IT GONNA SIT ON YOUR LIVING ROOM 
SO IT NOT GONNA FALL OFF THE ROOM OF THE SOFA 
YEAH 
BUT THEN IT WOULDN'T SIT AS COMFORTABLY IN YOUR HAND 
YEAH 
UH THAT WOULD BE NICE 
YEAH 
THERE 
YOU WOULD THOUGH 'CAUSE IT'S BUT IT'S MORE INTERESTING THAN OTHER REMOTES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK WE HAVE TO MARKET IT IN THE RIGHT WAY THAT UM TO SAY THAT IT IS SIMPLISTIC 
SO PEOPLE DON'T JUST USE IT AND THINK UH THIS IS IS SIMPLISTIC I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
WE HAVE TO MARKET IT 
AND THE KINETIC ENERGY PART 
YEAH 
DON'T SHAKE 
UH IN THE PLUS 
YOU'RE IS THE ZERO 
MAKE A NEW ONE 
I THINK THEY'RE ABOUT TEN PO TEN POUND AREN'T THEY 
ABOUT TEN POUNDS 
FIFTEEN 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
I THINK IT DOES VERY WELL 
THE ZAP YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH THE B WHEN YOU PRESS THE ALARM SYSTEM THE LIGHTS BEHIND THE END IT'LL VIBRA 
IT'LL BE AGAIN IN THE MARKETING 
YEAH 
THE LIGHT IT WILL 
BUT 
BUT BOTH 
YEAH 
UH THAT WOULD BE BRILLIANT 
I'D BE TEMPTED TO 
YEAH 
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IN THE MARKET 
YEAH BUT YOU STILL COULDN'T USE IT 
IT WOULD JUST BE A LITTLE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OR SOMETHING 
SO THE PLU THE PLUS W ONCE THAT'S WRITTEN DOWN ON THE PAGE THAT'LL BE REALLY SIMPLE WON'T IT 
YEAH 
THAT KIND OF ANNOYS ME THOUGH WHEN IT'S ZERO SIX WHEN YOU HAVE TO PRESS I DON'T KNOW WHY 
OH OKAY 
RIGHT 
ALRIGHT AYE 
YEAH 
I'D SAY WE YEAH NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
BUT IF YOU'RE ZAPPING YEAH 
I DON'T THINK IT WILL F 
YEAH THE BIOLOGY 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I I'D SAY T TWO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO WE WE CAN'T REALLY DO THAT BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BANANA THEME WE CAN'T HAVE IT IS BEING YELLOW 
IT WON'T STAND OUT 
SO NO IT'S NOT ALWAYS GONNA BE THE SAME COLOUR 
GRAY YEAH 
YEAH COULD BE GREY 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT WE DIDN'T EVEN OR 
YEAH 
PERHAPS A METALLIC OR OR LIKE THAT'S GREY AND IT WOULDN'T BE THAT EXPENSIVE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF METAL 
NO 
THAT ISN'T RUBBER 
OKAY 
FOLLOWING THAT BRIEFING WE DID 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK WE YEAH I THINK ONE 
WELL THAT WAS OUR BRIEF AND WE FOLLOWED THE BRIEF 
WELL WE HAVEN'T GOT A BIG BANANA BUT 
OH YEAH 
NO 
NO 
UH THAT WOULD BE CLASS 
YEAH 
TWO 
IT'S 
YEAH 
CLOSE TO TWO 
YEAH 
I GOT 
YEAH 'CAUSE WE'VE A FREE TO BRING DOWN 
UH YOU 
YEAH 
UH SHOULD'VE ADDED FIVE 
THIS IS 
YAY 
SO THAT THE PROJECT DOCUMENT 
YEAH 
OH RIGHT 
WHAT ABOUT A SPECIAL COLOUR 
ARE WE USING THAT 
YEAH 
AND A SPECIAL MATERIAL 
YEAH 
THAT'S GOOD 
YEAH 
THE UM 
OR MATERIALS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
CREATIVITY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH IT C IT MIGHT'VE BEEN BIGGER 
YEAH 
I'M ACTUALLY NOT SURE IF I'VE SAVED MY PRESENTATIONS 
YEAH 
THROUGH DISCUSSION 
YEAH 
AND WE WERE A ABLE TO MODIFY EACH OTHER'S IDEAS 
TO FIT IN WITH OUR AREAS OF EXPERTISE 
IF IF IT IF IT 
IF IT CAN BE AFFORDED 
YEAH 
YAY 
YEAH 
I'M SORRY 
WHAT WAS THE WHERE'S THE L. E. D. 
OH 
OKAY 
UH THERE'S AN E OKAY 
OKAY 
SIXTY 
WELL TH THERE IS A THERE'S A DELAY ON REMOTES I THINK 
WHERE YOU CAN HAVE IT IT'S LIKE A FIVE SECOND INPUT TIME 
SO AS LONG AS YOU HIT THEM DADA 
IT SHOULD BE FINE 
AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT A BIG PAUSE BETWEEN THE T HITTING THE TWO BUTTONS 
WAS THERE IS IN THE TOP THERE IS VOLUME AND 
CHANNEL UP VOLUME UP 
OKAY COOL 
YEAH 
IT'S THE R. 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES 
UH IT'S NICE 
UH I THINK I KILLED THE FIVE 
I DID 
I KILLED THE FOUR 
OH GOOD 
UH IT SMELLS GOOD 
BRAVO 
YOU WANT THE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ORDER IT GOES ON 
I HAVE NO 
EVALUATION CRI OKAY 
THAT'S ME 
HELLO 
OH THERE WE GO 
OKAY 
COME IN MY COMPUTER 
COME ON 
SORRY MY COMPUTER'S GIVING ME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES 
SHOULD I PRESS IT AGAIN 
LAST TIME I DID THAT IT SH 
OKAY 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
OH 
STILL NOT THERE 
OKAY NOW I THINK FOR THIS ONE I COULD WOULD YOU GUYS PREFER USE THE WHITEBOARD OR MAYBE MAYBE I'LL JUST DO IT IN RIGHT ON THE SCREEN WHERE YOU CAN USE IT 
UM WE'RE GONNA BE DOING AN EVALUATION REPORT TOGETHER BASED ON THE PROTOPTYPE THAT WE'VE JUST SEEN 
UM AND LOOKING LOOKING BACK TO MY NOTES FROM OUR BOTH OUR CONCEPTUAL AND OUR FUNCTIONAL MEETINGS 
UM I MADE A LIST OF WHAT OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS AND GOALS WERE UM BACK TO OUR KICK OFF MEETING THIS MORNING 
UM AND WE'LL EVALUATE IS IT WHETHER WE'VE IS DONE WHAT WE SET IT TO DO 
UM AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT IN A ONE TO SEVEN SCALE WHERE ONE IS TRUE AND SEVEN IS FALSE 
SO BASICALLY THE LOWER P THE LOWER THE POINTS THE BETTER 
OKAY SO QUESTION NUMBER ONE 
DOES THE REMOTE WHOOPS 
SORRY 
UH I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE UM I'LL DO IT IN THE WHITEBOARD 
I CAN'T CHANGE IT SO I'M G I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO PUSH IT DOWN ONCE 
I'LL WRITE DOWN OUR SCORES UP ON THE 
OKAY SO NUMBER ONE 
DO WE HAVE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
YEAH I GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR DEFINITION OF FANCY BUT IT'S DEFINITELY DIFFERENT 
IT'S NOT YOUR TRADITIONAL YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I KINDA I LIKE THE POTATO LOOK 
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT 
IT'S WHAT 
OH SORRY THE AMONG THE MANGO LOOK 
YEAH IT IS FRUIT OR VEGETABLE DEPENDS ON YOUR MOOD 
SO I MYSELF WOULD SAY A ONE OR A TWO 
IT'S A TWO 
OKAY AND UP 
ONE BEING TRUE 
SO 
TWO 
OKAY ACTU THAT'S PRO THAT'S GONNA GET CONFUSING LIKE THAT 
OKAY SO QUESTION NUMBER TWO WAS IS IT TECHN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
SO I KNOW WE HAVE THE KINETIC ENERGY WHICH IS VERY INNOVATIVE 
SO IF THE RUBBER THE EASE OF THE L. E. D. 
ISN'T 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
AND I THINK I MEAN IT IT'S TOUGH TO SAY BECAUSE WE WERE WE DIDN'T WANT TO TO BE ANY MORE INNOVATIVE THAN THIS 
BECAUSE THEN THAT WOULD'VE DEFEATED THE PURPOSE 
SO I MEAN I WE'LL PUT THERE BUT I THINK WE ACTUALLY REACHED OUR GOAL 
WE DIDN'T WANT TO ANY MORE THAN THAT 
OKAY QUESTION NUMBER THREE 
UH WELL TO BE EASY TO USE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH I THINK IT'S YOU CAN'T REALLY GET CONFUSED WITH THAT 
I MEAN THERE'LL BE SO WE HAVE TO WORK AT THE UH NUMBER THE PLUS SYSTEM 
BUT ONCE THAT'S FIGURED IT IT SHOULD BE FINE 
NUMBER FOUR 
SO THIS A GOOD LOOKING REMOTE 
REMEMBER THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY 
MM-HMM 
WHOOPS 
SHOULD JUST NOT TOUCH IT 
THIS TIME IT'S THE OTHER I KILLED 
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF IT SHOULD BE LIKE FLATTER 
OR 
WELL 
YEAH THE BOTTOM COULD BE LIKE CH CHOPPED A BIT 
OH 
THAT'S TRUE 
MAYBE IT COULD IT COULD BE IN THE BOTTOM SO YOU WOULDN'T LOO LIKE IF IT'S FLAT HERE IS IT SITS UP 
LIKE THAT 
IF IT'S WEIGHTED MAYBE 
DETAILS DETAILS 
OKAY 
SO SO THIS A GOOD LOOKING REMOTE 
WOULD WE WANNA SHOW IT OFF TO OUR FRIENDS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I MEAN I G YEAH IT'S PERSONAL TASTE BUT 
YEAH 
OKAY SO SHOULD WE SAY TWO FOR THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH QUESTION NUMBER FIVE 
WHAT'S UM WELL PEOPLE BE WILLING TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE EUROS ON THIS PRODUCT 
REMEMBER THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WERE WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL LOOKED FANCY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AT THE MARKETING WILL HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH IT 
SHAKE IT AND THE BUTTONS FALL OFF 
NO I GUESS I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROL INDUSTRY HOW MUCH YOUR AVERAGE SELLS FOR BUT I KNOW I AM AREN'T I 
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY BATTERIES 
SO ON THE LONG TERM THIS CAN ACTUALLY SAVE YOU MONEY 
SO WE'LL MARKET IT THAT WAY IT 
SO YEAH I THINK WITH A GOOD MARKETING SCHEME UM AND THE PERSONALISATION OPTIONS IT'LL 
YEAH 
OKAY NUMBER SIX 
CAN SOMEONE READ IT IT 
OR 
UM YEAH 
SO THAT WAS MAINLY THAT THE STATISTICS WE SAID 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I GUESS THE I THINK THE KEY WORD THERE IS AVERAGE 'CAUSE THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE THAT SIDE THE UH VIDEO INPUT AND SOUND AND STUFF 
BUT THEY'RE NOT YOU AND I REALLY 
SO 
OKAY SO NO 
OKAY 
NUMBER SEVEN 
C HEATHER COULD YOU PUSH IT DOWN 
WELL THIS REMOTE CONTROL BE EASY TO FIND WHEN LOST 
REMEMBER THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS LOSE THEIR REMOTE REGULARLY 
NOW IS THERE THE USE THE ALARM SYSTEM STILL WAS IT IMPLEMENTED 
IT TURNS INTO A DUCK AND STARTS QUACKING 
HERE I UM 
UM 
OKAY 
WE UH YOU'RE JUST EXPLAINING WHY IT'S NOT IN THE PROTOTYPE 
BUT YEAH IT'LL BE THERE 
SO WE CAN WE COULD SAY THAT 
WE CAN GIVE IT A ONE BECAUSE COMPARED TO EVERY OTHER REMOTE EVER M EVER MADE THIS ONE WILL BE EASIER TO FIND 
OKAY 
UM 
QUESTION NUMBER EIGHT 
WELL TO BE EASY TO LEARN HOW TO USE THIS REMOTE WHEN BRAND NEW 
REMEMBER THAT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF USERS USUALLY FIND TOO DIFFICULT 
SO IT HAS TO BE YEAH IT'S EAS THEY'LL PICK IT UP AND THEY'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO 
THE PLUS THING NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON 
YEAH 
WELL 
DO 
DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE FOR THE MIDDLE ONE TO BE IN JUST AN ENTER BUTTON 
SO THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUSH TWO BUTTONS EVERY TIME AT LEAST 
YOU COULD JUST PRESS SIX ENTER OR ONE TWO ENTER 
YEAH 
UM OKAY SO WE CAN WE'LL SAY YES IT'S UH NO 
OKAY 
QUESTION NUMBER NINE 
UH WELL IT MINIMISE THE EFFECTS OF R. S. I. WHICH WAS REPEATED STRAIN INJURY 
UM WHICH AFFECTED OVER A QUARTER OF USERS 
SO 
IT'S SOFT AND 
AND PEOPLE COULD 
MM-HMM 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER OPTIONS THERE ARE 
COULD I MEAN YOU COULD HOLD IT IN YOUR LEFT HAND AND DO IS YOUR INDEX FINGER 
BUT THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY OTHER OPTIONS UNLESS IT'S LIKE A KEYBOARD 
SO I THINK WE DID AS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN WITH A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO ONE OR TWO DO YOU THINK 
TWO OKAY 
OKAY NUMBER TEN 
DID WE SOMEHOW INCORPORATE THE COMPANY COLOUR AND LOGO 
NOW IS THE COLOUR GONNA BE THERE EVEN IF IT'S LIKE VANILLA 
SO THE YELLOW 
MM-HMM 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE COLOUR'S SOMETHING THAT WE 
BUT I MEAN THE YELL YEAH D YELLOW'S UGLY THOUGH DEPENDING ON THE 
SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO TALK TO OUR EXECUTIVE MANAGERS AND SO IF WE CAN GET AWAY WITH JUST THE R. R. 
OKAY 
YEAH 
AND THE BUTTONS ON THE MIDDLE 
OKAY 
SO DO YOU THINK THAT'S MORE OF A THREE THEN 
THREE FOUR 
FOUR 
WELL WE HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR IT IS W BUT WE CAN STILL PUT A 
A FOUR 
OKAY AND FINAL QUESTION 
UM DID WE STAY TRUE TO OUR MOTTO AND PUT THE FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS 
CURRENT TRENDS OF FRUITS AND VEGGIES DESIRE FOR SPONGINESS 
YEAH 
NO UH ARE THE PLATES INTERCHANGEABLE 
I THINK I MISSED A FEW THEY ARE 
SO YOU CAN HAVE BANANA AND KIWI AND OKAY 
OKAY SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF IN THE MAKING IT LIKE MAYBE IT'LL BECOME MORE 
MM-HMM 
YES WE DO 
SO I WH WHAT WAS I GONNA PUT FOR THAT 
A TWO FOR FASHION 
OKAY SO OUR AVERAGE THREE FIVE SIX EIGHT TEN ELEVEN 
TWELVE THIRTEEN FIFTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE DIVIDED BY ELEVEN 
SO 
BETWEEN OKAY 
UM 
YEAH THAT'S VERY GOOD 'CAUSE THE HIGHEST WE COULD GET IS NO 
DOES THAT SEEM RIGHT THEN 
OKAY 
SORRY 
OR YOU GONNA DO THAT 
OKAY 
UH IS IT LOCKED 'CAUSE I'M ON IT 
OR OKAY 
MM 
'S GOOD 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AND THE CONCEPTUAL AND FUNCTIONAL 
LIKE WE WERE VERY CREATIVE IN IN COMING UP WITH AN IDEA I GUESS BUT UM 
WHEN WE CAN DOWN TO IT 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
GOOD LEADERSHIP I THINK WE STAYED ON TASK 
MM-HMM 
AND THE TIMING WAS GOOD 
WE NEVER WERE PUSHED FOR TIME OR SAT AROUND DOING NOTHING SO 
WAS GOOD TEAMWORK 
I THINK WE ARE WELL SUITED TO OUR ROLES 
OH REALLY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THE COMPUTER PROGRAMMES ARE GOOD 
THE 
YEAH 
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING 
YEAH 
THEY'LL PROBABLY STILL BE THERE 
UM 
I'M NOT SURE NEW IDEAS FOUND 
YEAH WELL I GUESS WE REALLY IT WE BOUNCED OFF OF EACH OTHER WHICH WAS COOL 
LIKE BASED ON MARKETING STUFF AND THEN YOU'D SAY SOMETHING ABOUT INTERFACE AND YEAH WORKED WELL 
MM-HMM 
UH DOES IT HAVE SMART MATERIALS BY THE WAY 
DOES IT HAVE SMART MATERIALS 
OH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BY WATCHING T. V. 
MM 
CONCLUSION 
DADADA 
UH UH UM 
OKAY 
I AM CORINNE WHITING AND I WILL BE THE MARKETING EXPERT AND ON EACH OF THE THREE PHASES I WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT ROLE 
IN THE FUNCTION DESIGN PHASE I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION 
AND THIS MEANS WHAT NEEDS AND DESIRES ARE TO BE FULFILLED AND I'LL BE DOING RESEARCH TO FIGURE THIS IT 
IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE I WILL BE DEALING WITH TREND WATCHING AND I'LL BE DOING MARKETING RESEARCH ON THE WEB 
AND THEN FINALLY IN THE UM DETAILED DESIGN PHASE I WILL BE DOING PRODUCT EVALUATION AND SO I WILL BE COLLECTING THE REQUIREMENTS AND RANKING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS TO SEE HOW WE DID 
MM 
ERASE IT 
MM 
OUCH 
LIKE A TRACKING DEVICE 
MM 
BE GOOD 
LOT MORE MODERN 
MAYBE LIKE USER FRIENDLY LIKE A LITTLE 
YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN USE BOTH HANDS LIKE A LITTLE KEYBOARD TYPE THING 
MM 
MM 
MM 
ALSO SINCE WE'RE PARTNERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL REMOTE CONTROL ASSOCIATION MAYBE WE WANNA MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT WOULD GLOBALLY APPEAL 
THAT'S MORE ON THE RESEARCH AND ABOUT THE MARKETING 
YEAH 
AND MAYBE AS FAR AS DESIGN GOES MAYBE WE COULD HAVE DIFFERENT ONES FOR DIFFERENT TARGET AUDIENCES 
'CAUSE MAYBE ONE WON'T APPLY TO ALL OF THE COUNTRIES WE'RE TARGETING 
FUTURISTIC 
MM-HMM 
'KAY I'LL DRAW SOMETHING 
WHAT 
MY IDEA WAS JUST TO HAVE TO BE KIND OF LIKE A 
KEYBOARD TYPE SHAPE YOU KNOW LIKE VIDEO GAMES L SO 
BUT MAYBE I MEAN THAT WOULD BE KINDA BIG AND BULKY 
WE COULD ALSO TRY TO DO THE HINGE THING IS IT COULD LIKE FLIP IT THAT WAY 
I DON'T KNOW 
THAT'S MY IDEA 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
TRUE 
MM 
THAT'S FINE 
YOU'RE THE BOSS YOU'RE ALLOWED TO 
YEAH 
LOOKS COOL THOUGH 
YEAH 
MM 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT WE HAVE A WARNING TO FINISH 
YEAH 
MM 
GREAT 
OKAY 
OH THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK 
OH ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM ALRIGHT 
I'LL JUST PUT THAT THERE 
UH SO YOU ALL KNOW WE'RE HERE TO CREATE A BRAND NEW FANTASTIC REMOTE 
UH I'M NICK DEBUSK I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER 
UH WE'LL JUST GET STARTED WITH EVERYONE KIND OF LETTING EACH OTHER KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOUR WHAT YOUR ROLE IS UM 
GO AHEAD 
'KAY 
OKAY 
UM SO WE'VE GOT OUR OPENING OUR OUR AGENDA IS THE OPENING UH ACQUAINTANCE WHICH WE'VE KINDA DONE 
UH TOOL TRAINING PROJECT PLAN DISCUSSION AND THEN CLOSING 
UH GRAND TOTAL OF TWENTY FIVE MINUTES WE HAVE HERE 
UM SO WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
UM WE WANT TO TO BE SOMETHING ORIGINAL 
UM OF COURSE WE'RE A NOT ONLY A ELECTRONICS COMPANY BUT A 
FASHION UM CONSCIOUS ELECTRONICS COMPANY SO WE WANT TO TO BE TRENDY UM AND WE WANT TO TO BE EASY TO USE 
UM 
WE'VE GOT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DETAILED DESIGN UM WHICH BASICALLY IS IS THE OTHER IF YOU UM 
AND 
WE UH WELL UM FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UM 
UM DO WE HAVE UM 
ANY IDEAS OF OF MAYBE D LET'S JUST THROW OUT SOME IDEAS OF WHAT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL WE WANT TO HAVE 
AND THEN WE CAN GO INTO HOW WE'RE GONNA DESIGN IT AND 
AND HOW WE'RE GONNA DO THE DETAILING ON IT 
SO WE WANT TO TO BE UM A T. V. REMOTE OR I I MEAN DO WE WANT TO TO TO DO OTHER THINGS BESIDES JUST BE A A TELEVISION REMOTE 
'KAY 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
I I THINK YEAH YEAH R UNIVERSAL REMOTE 
UM THIS IS MY FIRST UH GO AROUND WITH CREATING A REMOTE CONTROL SO I THINK WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT HERE 
UM 
OKAY 
SO WE SHOULD WE SHOULD SET OUR REMOTE CONTROL UP TO WHERE IT HAS A UH 
LIKE A TRACKING DEVICE OR OR LIKE A A 
IT MAKES A NOISE THERE'S A BUTTON ON THE T. V. THAT YOU PRESS AND 
'KAY 
YEAH 
DO WE WANT SO THEY'RE KINDA LIKE ALONG AND RECTANGULAR 
DO WE WANT SOMETHING CRAZY 
YOU KNOW WE WANT SOMETHING NEW THAT'S GONNA STAND OUT 
A UM A MODERN IS OUR REMOTE SHOULD BE 
'KAY 
UM 
OKAY SO YEAH SO WE WANT TO TO BE STURDY WE WANT TO TO TO HOLD UP AT SOMEBODY'S CHILD YOU KNOW 
THROWING IT ACROSS THE ROOM OR SO YOU SAID PEOPLE KINDA THROW IT 
SO BALL SHAPED UH YOU KNOW IF IT WERE BALL SHAPED MAYBE THEN IT 
'KAY 
UM SO WE WANT TO TO BE MODERN FUN STURDY 
UM 
SO OUR FORM AND OUR FUNCTION 
UM WE WANT TO TO BE UM 
EASY TO FIND 
UM 
WHAT ELSE 
IT WHAT ELSE DO WE WANT TO TO TO DO 
SO WE WANT TO TO BE UNIVERSAL 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SELL FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE EUROS UM 
AND 
YOU KNOW GOALS FOR PROFITS ARE I THINK SOMEWHERE AROUND UH FIFTY MILLION EUROS WHAT THEY WANNA MAKE ONE TO USE 
'KAY 
SO MARKETING YOU KNOW HOW MAYBE UH 
MARKETING YOU COULD USE FIND OUT WHAT IS THE MOST UNIVERSALLY UM APPEALING REMOTE CONTROL OUT THERE 
'KAY 
UM 
DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY IDEAS FOR WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE 
MAYBE WE COULD DRAW IT UP ON THE ON THE BOARD OVER THERE 
SOME IDEAS 
WE WANT TO TO BE A B A BALL YOU KNOW WE'LL DRAW UP WE'LL DRAW UP THE BALL AND MAYBE THE UM WHERE THE BUTTONS ARE LOCATED 
UH-HUH 
HOW WOULD WE GO ABOUT UM 
MAKING YOU KNOW GETTING RID OF OUR WEAK POINTS 
WHAT I MEAN WOULD WE JUST HAVE A FLAT SPOT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BALL 
NOT TO PUT YOU IN THE SPOT BUT 
WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR TITLE WAS AGAIN 
YOU'RE THE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
OKAY 
YEAH 
IT'S NOT NOW IT'S NOT INNOVATIVE IT'S YOU KNOW EVERYBODY DOES LONG REMOTE BECAUSE IT'S EASY IT'S IT'S STABLE UM 
SO IF ONE GO AHEAD 
SOMETHING WITH A GROUP 
YEAH 
BECAUSE EVEN I SUPPOSE EVEN WITH THE BALL 
IT'S IT MIGHT NOT BE THE EASIEST TO HOLD ONTO UM 
SO PERHAPS THE THE JOYSTICK THE THE KEYBOARD IDEA MIGHT WORK BETTER 
BUT THEN AGAIN PEOPLE LIKE TO USE ONE HAND TO FLIP AND ONE HAND TO HOLD THEIR SODA SO MAYBE MAYBE WE 
I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST SHOOTING EVERYTHING DOWN HERE 
UH UM 
YEAH 
OKAY SO UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIVE MINUTES HERE TO COME UP WITH OUR UM REMOTE CONTROL DO AND START ROLLING WITH IT 
UM WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROL AND UM WE'VE GOT A COUPLE IDEAS UM 
LET'S SEE HERE 
WHAT IF WE HAD WHAT IF WE HAD NOT ONLY UM SAY WE WENT WITH THE BALL THE BALL FUNCTION UM 
BUT MAYBE WE GIVE IT SORT OF GRIPS ALONG THE SIDE SO UM TO MAKE IT EASIER TO HOLD ON IT 
SO 
YOU KNOW UM SO SO IT'S EASIER TO HOLD ONTO THAT WAY 
COURSE THAT'LL THEN REMOVE SOME OF OUR OUR BALL 
UNLESS THIS UNLESS THIS PART WERE RAISED SO SAY THE COVER FLIPS OVER AND COVERS THAT PART 
SO THE GROUP IS 
NO THAT WOULDN'T WORK EITHER UM 
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT FLAT ON THE BOTTOM THEN THAT ELIMINATES OUR BALL ANYWAYS 
SO IF IT WERE FLAT ON THE BOTTOM AND THEN HAD THE 
SORTA GRIPS ON THE SIDE HERE I GUESS 
UM 
AND THEN 
FLAT UH 
AND THEN WE HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE HINGE 
SO IF WE'RE FLAT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GONNA ROLL AWAY IT'LL STAY WHERE WE WANT 
MM THAT'S TRUE 
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO FLIP OPEN 
WE JUST HAVE A BALL 
OKAY SO THEN WE FORGOT THE BALL 
IT LOOKS COOL BUT IT'S REALLY NOT IT'S NOT FUNCTIONAL UM 
SO WE'VE GOT OUR SORT OF KEYBOARD KIND 
WHAT IF WE FLIPPED IT AROUND HERE IS THAT IT WERE UM 
SORRY THAT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE WHAT YOU HAD THREE 
UM SO IT'S UP AND DOWN YOU HOLD IT THIS WAY 
COURSE THEN IT'S IT'S LIKE THE RECTANGULAR AGAIN ONLY WITH A COUPLE OF JUTTING OUT POINTS 
BUT IT'S ONE HANDED UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A CORD LIKE JOYSTICKS DO 
SO IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE TO TO WHERE IT WOULD WORK WITH A LIKE A SENSOR ON OTHER SIDE 
SO THAT EITHER WAY YOU'RE POINTING AT IT WOULD WORK 
MORE EXPENSIVE AND YEAH 
'KAY 
UM 
TRUE 
'KAY 
ARE WE OUT OF TIME 
OKAY WELL JUST TO FINISH UP SHOULD WE USE GO WITH THIS PLAN START MAKING SOME 
ARE GOOD IDEAS WHAT ARE NOT 
OH 
MUST FINISH NOW IS 
AND THEN MARKETING WILL LOOK AND SO WHAT UH WHAT PEOPLE WANT 
OKAY 
AND PROJECT MANAGER WILL DESIGN A BETTER MEETING FOR NEXT TIME AROUND BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PREPARED 
AND UH ALRIGHT GOOD MEETING 
HIYA I'M RYAN 
UM I'M THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
UM LIKEWISE I'VE THREE DIFFERENT ROLES FOR EACH STAGE OF DESIGN 
UM THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IS LOOKING AT THE TEX TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF A REMOTE CONTROL 
UM IN THE CONCEPT DESIGN THE USER INTERFACE HOW THE USER REACTS WITH THE THE PRODUCT 
AND THE DETAILED DESIGN UM SORT OF LIKE THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
WHAT THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR UH THINGS LIKE FASHIONS WHAT MAKES WHA HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT SPECIAL 
THAT'S ABOUT IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL UH S FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS JUST JUST YOU KNOW CHANGE CHANNELS AS ITS MAIN FUNCTION 
OH RIGHT 
I SUPPOSE YOU C TRY MAKE IT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE FOR COULD WORK ON ALL SORT OF ELECTRICAL 
PRODUCTS IN IN ONE PERSON'S HOUSE 
BUT YOU KNOW THEY ALL SORTA HAVE THE SAME ROLE CHANGING CHANNELS VOLUMES AND THEN PROGRAMMING 
I THINK THEY ALL WORK ON THE SAME PRIN PRINCIPLE AS WELL SORTA LIKE I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW 
BUT IS IT JUST INFRA RED 
SO THAT STANDARD 
Y YEAH 
UM ONE THING I THOUGHT OF WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL SO YOU ALWAYS LOSE 'EM 
SO IF THERE'S A G A WAY OF FINDING IT QUITE EASILY I THOUGHT THAT'D BE QUITE GOOD QUITE A GOOD FEATURE 
UH YOU CAN GET THIS OKAY WELL YOU COULD WHISTLE OR MAKE A NOISE AND IT'D BEEP 
YEAH 
GENERALLY ALL REMOTES ARE SORT OF QUITE SIMILAR IN THEIR APPEARANCE 
JUST LONG 
YEAH 
BLACK USUALLY 
YEAH 
I THINK SO 
MAYBE SORTA SPHERICAL OR SOMETHING 
A BALL 
YEAH 
PEOPLE I THOUGHT MAYBE 
BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS TEND TO THROW A REMOTE CONTROL BUT THE PLACE IT IN ANOTHER IF IT WAS IN A BALL 
AND MAYBE THE ACTUAL CONTROLS ARE INSIDE OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT COULD BE CASED ON THE OUTSIDE AND IT EVERYTHING COULD BE INSIDE 
YOU 
SMALL 
I'D I COULD DRAW SORTA THE BALL IDEA 
MY ORIGINAL IDEA WAS JUST SIMPLY 
SORT OF A SPHERE WHERE MAYBE YOU 
THIS IS WHERE IT'S CONNECTED TOGETHER AND THEN WHEN YOU OPEN IT IT IT COULD FOL IT COULD BE MAYBE FLIP 
LIKE A FLIP PHONE AND THEN WHEN YOU FOLD IT AT THE MIDDLE 
MAYBE A HINGE THAT'LL HAVE TO BE THE STRONGEST PART OF IT 
IF THAT IF WE DID AS A HINGE OR IF IT WAS JUST TWO PARTS AND THEN YOU'D HAVE 
JUST SORTA Y Y YOU KNOW YOUR BUTTONS 
THING IS INSIDE I THINK SOMETIMES REMOTES HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS SO MAYBE USE SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE UM SO FEW BUTTONS INSIDE IS POSSIBLE 
UM I DUNNO WHAT'S THE IDEA FOR 
JUST SOMETHING MAYBE IF YOU UH IF IT HAD LIKE IF SOME KIND OF 
LIKE LIGHT OR SOMETHING OR LIGHTS AROUND IT 
IT'S LOOKING A BIT LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF STAR WARS AT THE MOMENT THOUGH TO BE FOR 
BUT YEAH 
THAT WAS THAT WAS A SORTA SIMPLE IDEA I HAD AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU COULD BUT 
RIGHT IT WOULD ALMOST BE LIKE A BALL 
SO THAT WAS JUST JUST AN IDEA I HAD 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ANYBODY ELSE HAS OTHER IDEAS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE F YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S G THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
THE DO IT DIDN'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY BE OF A HINGE THAT WAS JUST AN IDEA THOUGH 
YEAH 
WELL I I SUPPOSE THAT THINGS BECOME DESIGN 
BUT I MEAN I 
I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF LIKE THE DESIGN OF OTHERS 
I CAN'T THINK IF ANYTHING OTHER THAN A LONG RECTANGLE FOR REMOTE MAYBE SMALL SORT OF FATTER ONES 
BUT THERE'S NOTHING BEING DONE SORT OF OUT OF LEFT FIELD YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK DEFINITELY DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
IS A GOOD IDEA 
I MEAN MAYBE DESIGN SOMETHING THAT'S SORT OF LIKE UH I SUPPOSE NOT EVERYBODY'S EVERYBODY'S HAND'S THE SAME BUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAYBE FIT IN THE HAND EASIER 
YEAH WITH A GROUP 
IT STILL MIGHT BE HARD TO IT STILL NOT THE HO EASIEST THING TO HOLD YEAH 
LIKE YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S D YEAH 
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY GOT TO BE A A ONE HANDED A ONE HANDED JOB 
YEAH 
BUT THEN MAYBE TO GO BACK TO THE AT THE IS SOMETHING ALONG THOSE THINGS THEN 
YEAH 
PUT IT 
EVEN IF YOU DESIGNED IT IN SOME IN A WAY THAT YOU KNOW ISN'T A RECTANGLE BUT STILL POINTED IN A DIRECTION THAT HAD DEFINITE POINTS 
SO IF THAT'S YOUR THING AND YOU GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT INSTEAD AND THERE'S YOUR SO YOU KN YOU KNOW WHICH WAY YOU'RE GONNA POINTING OUT 
UM 
DOES IT SAY WHAT DOES IT EASY FOR IN IT SAYS ON THEIR WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR THE NEXT MEETING I THINK 
IT 
RIGHT 
I'M MANUEL AND I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER IN IN THIS PROJECT UM 
IN THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN PHASE I'M I'LL BE DEALING MOSTLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS 
UM WE'LL DISCUSS WHAT THE PROG WHAT FUNCTIONS THE THE PRODUCT HAS TO FULFIL AND SO AND SO NO 
UM I SUPPOSE WE'LL WORK PRETTY MUCH TOGETHER ON THAT ONE 
UM UM IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN UM I'LL BE PRO MOSTLY DEALING WITH PROPERTIES AND MATERIALS UM OF OUR PRODUCT 
AND UH THE DETAILED DESIGN IN THE DETAILED DESIGN I'LL BE CONCERNED WITH THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF 
UM SO WE'RE PRETTY MUCH WORKING TOGETHER OBVIOUSLY IN THE DESIGN FRONT HERE 
OKAY 
MM 
MM MM 
RIGHT 
SO 
MM 
WELL THERE ARE OF COURSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS YOU CAN'T HAVE TO BE ANY FORM AND FULFIL ALL FUNCTIONS AT THE SAME TIME 
SO THERE ARE ALWAYS THE SAME RESTRICTIONS WE HAVE TO APPLY HERE 
UM HOWEVER UM ONE QUESTION IS HOW STABLE IS THAT THING SUPPOSED TO BE THAT REFERS TO THE MATERIAL PRETTY MUCH UM 
WHAT ARE WE GONNA BUILD THAT THING OUT OF 
HOW STURDY IS IT GONNA BE 
DO WE WANT TO TO LAST LONGER OR RATHER HAVE PEOPLE 
WHATEVER HAVE TO BUY ONE EVERY HALF A YEAR 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
NO PROBLEM YOU'D GET WITH THIS DESIGN SO UM THE BALL IS A NICE IDEA BECAUSE IF IT'S STABILITY REALLY BIT OF COURSE 
SINCE IT'S A BALL IT'LL ROLL SO WE'D HAVE TO HAVE TO FLAT ON ONE SIDE AT LEAST DOWN HERE SOMEWHERE TAKE AWAY THAT PART 
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES 
ALSO ALSO YOU RISK THE HINGES HERE 
THAT'S THAT'S ME A PROBLEM 
THAT'S THAT'S INTERESTING OF COURSE BUT THAT'S OF COURSE A WEAK POINT YEAH 
E NO NO UH UH 
NO NO 
UH I'M YOUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SO I B WELL THE POINT IS 
THAT 
WELL MAYBE I DUNNO 
THE SHAPE IS PERHAPS NOT THE MOST IDEAL 
SO AS STABLE IS IT IS THERE MUST BE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN UM STABILITY AND DESIGN HERE IS 
MM 
WELL WITH THE ONE HANDED DESIGN YOU ALSO HAVE THE THE PROBLEM OF THE SIZE W 'CAUSE YOU KNOW FROM CELL PHONES THEY CAN BE TOO SMALL 
SO IF THE REMOTE IS TOO SMALL IT IF IT'S SMALL IT PROBABLY LOOKS BETTER BUT 
MAY NOT BE THE S FUNCTIONAL 
SO FOR THAT THERE'S 
SO 
THE QUESTION IS ALSO I DUNNO D DO YOU REALLY ALWAYS WANT TO OPEN THAT THING WHEN YOU HAVE TO USE IT 
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO LIE AROUND OPENED ALL THE TIME ANYWAY SO I DON'T KNOW OF A LID IS A GOOD IDEA 
FROM STABIL STABILITY POINT OF VIEW UH IT CERTAINLY IS 
BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO FACE IT AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE MORE OF THESE THINGS BREAK BY ACCIDENT UH THE MORE WE SELL 
SO IT'S DON'T MAKE IT TOO STABLE UH 
AT THE OTHER DESIGN 
IT LOOKS COOL 
UH FUNCTIONAL 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
QUESTION IS WHAT MAKES THOSE GAME PADS FUNCTIONAL 
W I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE FORM FOR FULL HAND 
SO IT'S A ROUND SHAPE UNDERNEATH THAT MAKES IT COMFY RIGHT MAKES IT ONCE SO THAT'S THE ESSENTIAL PART 
EXCEPT FOR THAT I THINK WE'LL NOT PROBABLY NOT GOT A GET AWAY FROM SOME LONGER DESIGN 
'CAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE TO KNOW WHICH WAY AROUND TO POINT THIS THING 
YOU KNOW ALL THAT DIF BATTERIES RIGHT AND 
BATTERIES GO WEAK AS WELL SO UM AFTER A WHILE YOU HAVE TO PAINT IT TOWARDS THE UH 
TOWARDS THE EQUIPMENT YOU WANNA CONTROL WITH IT RIGHT 
SO HAVE TO ME 
SHOW WHICH IS THE FRONT WHICH IS THE BACK 
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD DO THAT 
O OF COURSE THE MORE TECHNOLOGY YOU STICK ON THAT THE MORE IT'LL COST US 
COURSE YOU CAN DO THAT 
I MEAN OF COURSE IT'LL BE EVIDENT AFTER A WHEEL OR IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT'LL IT'LL BE EVIDENT WHICH WAY AROUND TO PAINT IT 
SINCE YOU HAVE THE THE NUMBERS AND THE AND THE THE BUTTONS AND STUFF 
BUT UM IT'S RATHER ABOUT AN INSTINCTUAL THING 
LIKE YOU JUST GRAB IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE LIKE TO TO YOU KNOW WHICH WAY AROUND TO PAINT IT 
OTHERWISE THE DESIGN OF OR THE THE POINT OF PUTTING TWO SENSORS ON BOTH SIDES UM WOULD PROBABLY WORK 
MM 
LET'S 
OBVIOUSLY 
ALRIGHT 
HM 
YEP 
SURE 
WHAT WAS IT 
FUNCTION 
F. EIGHT 
WELL 
HOW DO I GET IT 
OH RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT 
THAT ONE 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
WELL THIS IS MY REPORT WHICH IS GOING TO BE BASED PRETTY MUCH IN A SURVEY THAT I WAS SENT 
OH GOSH I'VE NO IDEA 
GO 
OKAY 
SORRY I ACTUALLY NEED 
IT IS SOMETHING ELSE IN MY SCREEN 
YEAH 
AND THEN 
AGAIN 
NO I WANT SOMETHING ELSE ON MINE 
SO THAT POSSIBLE 
OKAY BUT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE THAT 
SORRY GUYS 
SO SO THERE NO WAY I CAN GIVE YOU THE SLIDESHOW AND 
HAVE SOMETHING YEAH 
YEAH 
UH WELL 
YEAH 
IT'S OKAY 
OKAY 
UM SO FIRST OF ALL THE METHOD THAT I SAID WAS BY DOING SOME MARKETING RESEARCH BY UM DOING RESEARCH ON SOME INTERVIEWS THAT WERE CONDUCTED 
AND THEN SOME INTERNET RESEARCH 
AND I WAS SENT A REPORT THAT WAS I THINK THERE WERE A HUNDRED REMOTE USERS THAT THEY INTERVIEWED 
AND SO I WILL SHOW YOU SOME OF THE RESULTS FROM THAT WHICH I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL 
UM OKAY HERE ARE SOME OF THE FINDINGS 
THEY SAID THAT THE USERS DISLIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THEIR CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS FIND THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS TO BE UGLY 
WHICH IS A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER I WOULD SAY 
AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE USERS WOULD BE WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY IF THEY COULD GET A REMOTE THAT WOULD LOOK FANCY 
SO I THINK THAT EARLIER WE WERE NOT SOMETHING WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVING TO BE A MODERN COOL LIKE I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY IMPORTANT 
UM THEY SAY THAT CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER 
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS SAID THEY ZAP A LOT 
AND IF ANYONE COULD CLARIFY WHAT THAT MEANS 
ZAP DOES THAT JUST MEAN LIKE CHANGING THE CHANNEL 
OKAY 
UM AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE USERS SAY THAT THEY'RE ONLY USING TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS ON THEIR REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE THEY KEPT TRACK OF THE FREQUENCY PER HOUR ON USING CERTAIN BUTTONS 
AND SOME OF THEM IT LOOKS LIKE BARELY NEED TO BE INCLUDED AT ALL 
OF COURSE CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED THE MOST FREQUENTLY 
AND THEN TELETEXT WAS THE NEXT 
VOLUME AND THEN POWER 
AND THEN AUDIO SETTINGS AND SCREEN SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS WERE PRACTICALLY NEVER USED 
SO I THINK WE COULD DEFINITELY ELIMINATE OR SOMEHOW COMBINE A LOT OF THE FUNCTIONS INTO ONE BUTTON 
UM THE BIGGEST USER FRUSTRATIONS SO WE SAID FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE FIND THAT THEIR REMOTES ARE LOST SOMEWHERE 
AND SO I THINK A TRACKING DEVICE OF SOME SORT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA 
THEY USED TO TAKE THIRTY FOUR PERCENT SAID IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW REMOTE 
AND TWENTY SIX PERCENT SAID THAT THE CONTROLS ARE BAD FOR R. S. I. 
WHAT IS IT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
AND SO BAS OKAY 
UM SO FAR AS SPEECH RECOGNITION GOES UM THE YOUNGER GROUP LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL FOR IT 
FROM THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE AGE GROUP OVER NINETY PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD PAY MORE 
AND IT KIND OF JUST WENT DOWN INCREMENTALLY 
THE GROUPS AT THE OLDER THEY GET IT LOOKS LIKE THE LESS WILLING THEY ARE TO PAY 
SO MAYBE WE COULD DISCUSS THIS AND THINK AND DECIDE IF WE THINK IT'S WORTH INVESTING IN THIS 
AT LEAST IF WE'RE TARGETING THE YOUNGER GROUPS 
AND SO IN CONCLUSION 
SOME THINGS THAT I DREW FROM THESE ARE THAT I THINK WE WERE CORRECT 
WE DEFINITELY NEED TO FOCUS ON A NEW MODERN APPEARANCE SINCE SO MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE UGLINESS OF THEIR REMOTE CONTROL 
UM A MULTIFUNCTIONAL REMOTE COULD BE A GOOD THING TO EXPLORE 
SO YOU ONLY HAVE ONE RATHER THAN FIVE DIFFERENT REMOTES SITTING ALL OVER YOUR ROOM 
UH WE NEED TO SIMPLIFY THE REMOTE AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS GET RID OF THE ONES THAT DON'T SEEM TO BE SERVING MUCH PURPOSE 
AND THEN LASTLY I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE WE COULD DISCUSS THE IDEA OF SPEECH RECOGNITION 
AND THAT'S IT 
OH YEAH 
SORRY DID YOU GUYS GOT TIME TO WRITE EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEEDED 
'KAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
ANOTHER THING ABOUT THESE FIGURES IS NINETY ONE PERCENT OF THE YOUNGEST AGE GROUPS SAID THEY'D DO IT BUT PROBABLY A LOT OF THEM THAT'S ACTUALLY THEIR PARENTS MONEY 
LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GO OUT AND PURCHASE THIS THEMSELVES A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
GETS OLD YEAH 
MM 
MM 
ROLLS AWAY YEAH 
NOT REALLY 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH NOT YET BUT MAYBE BY THE NEXT MEETING WE'LL HAVE SOME INFO ON THAT 
MM 
MM 
POWER 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
UH-HUH 
MAYBE YOU COULD BUY LIKE A SPECIAL LEFT HANDED VERSION OF THE REMOTE 
SPECIAL ORDER 
YEAH 
MM 
HMM 
COULD BE GOOD 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OH 
OKAY 
THANKS FOR COMING OUT THIS MEETING 
SO HOW WE DOING IN OUR REMOTE 
WE HAVE SOME WE HAVE SOME IDEAS AND SOME UH 
DOES FOR WHAT PEOPLE WANT 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT LET'S JUST GO OVER THE AGENDA REAL QUICK FOR THIS MEETING 
SO IF I CAN'T GET THINGS UH MOVING ALONG HERE A LITTLE BIT BETTER 
UM I'LL GO OVER WHAT WE WENT OVER LAST TIME WHICH SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG 
THEN I BELIEVE EACH OF YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION 
UM I'VE WAS SENT A A COUPLE MORE REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR REMOTE WHAT THEY WANT 
UM THEN WE CAN COME TO A CONCLUSION ON UH WHAT WE WANT THE REMOTE TO DO UM AND HOW IT'S GOING TO DO IT HOPEFULLY 
AND UH THEN WE'LL HAVE THE CLOSING 
UM WHICH WE'LL HAVE FORTY MINUTES FOR 
UH LET'S SEE THE LAST MEETING WE WENT OVER UM 
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT 
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR LEADING THE MEETINGS KEEPING THE NOTES UH AND COMING UP WITH THE FINAL PRESENTATION 
UM CORINNE IS OUR MARKETING EXPERT 
SHE'S GONNA FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT UM THE CONSUMER WANTS 
UM RYAN IS OUR USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
AND MANUEL IS THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
SO YOU'RE GONNA COME UP WITH THE IDEAS RYAN AND YOU'RE GONNA PICK 'EM APART 
UM WE DECIDED OUR REMOTE UH WE WANT TO TO BE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE UH THAT EVERYONE WOULD WANT 
UM WE WANT TO BE MODERN UM FUN DIFFERENT 
UH IT NEEDS TO BE STURDY UM EASY TO FIND SO WE GONNA HAVE THAT LOCATOR FUNCTION 
UM AND WE WANT TO BE DIFFERENT 
UM AND THEN WE WENT OVER A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT IDEAS 
BALL SHAPED PHONE 
THE KEYBOARD SHAPE 
UM WE DECIDED THAT IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE ONE HANDED 
SOMETHING WE COULD USE WITH ONE HAND 
UM AND THAT WAS OUR LAST MEETING 
SO UM WHY DON'T UM DO EACH OF YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION 
OKAY 
I'LL HAND IT OFF TO YOU NEED UM 
DOES ANYONE DO YOU WANNA GO FIRST 
SO WE CAN MAYBE SEE WHAT UH WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT 
TO GO TO THE NEXT ONE 
YEAH YOU CLICK ON THAT GUY 
YEAH 
HIT F. EIGHT AGAIN 
I THINK 
YEAH 
YOU WANT TO TO BE ON BOTH SCREENS OR JUST JUST YOURS 
YEAH BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO HIT ESCAPE 
AND THEN YOU CAN 
YEAH 
OH HIT F. EIGHT AGAIN 
I KNOW 
I DID THE SAME THING 
AND THEN IT SHOULD COME UP 
HERE SHORTLY 
'KAY 
I THINK UH GIVE US THE SLIDESHOW AND SOMETHING ON YOUR SCREEN 
MM 
I'M NOT SURE 
YOU COULD MAYBE MINIMISE THAT SCREEN AND THEN 
HAVE THEM BOTH UP TO THE SAME TIME I THINK 
'KAY 
VERY NICE 
NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME IDEAS OF WHAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT WHAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON 
OH 
WAIT CAN I LOOK AT THAT REAL QUICK 
WHAT WAS YOUR LAST CONCLUSION ON THAT ONE 
FOCUS ON UH TH I 
THE IMAGE OF IT 
'KAY 
GOOD 
GOOD 
SO WE COULD THE THE THE MORE COMPLEX WE MAKE IT OF COURSE THE MORE EXPENSIVE 
BUT PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THEY WOULD WELL YOUNGER GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THEY WOULD PAY MORE FOR A SPEECH RECOGNITION REMOTE 
SO 
POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE WORTH THE INVESTMENT 
I AGREE 
WELL 
I MYSELF I FOUND WHEN YOU UH WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE SPEE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
LIKE UH YOU CALL ON THE PHONE AND YOU TRY TO CHANGE YOUR TELEPHONE OR POWER OR SOMETHING 
SOMETIMES THEY HAVE A A SPEECH RECOGNITION IN THE OTHER AND AND YOU SAY ONE FOR THIS 
AND YOU FIND YOURS LIKE YOU SAID SAYING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER 
I FIND MYSELF ESPECIALLY IF I'M IN A CROWD OF PEOPLE LOOKING REALLY SILLY 
SO MAYBE IF YOU'RE SITTING ON YOUR COUCH WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THEN 
YOU KNOW YOU 
VOLUME UP 
VOLUME DOWN 
CHANGE THE CHANNEL YOU KNOW CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN 
I I DON'T KNOW 
MM-HMM 
IT'S A IT'S A GIMMICK FACTOR THAT THEY LOOK AT FIRST AND 
OKAY 
UM 
LET'S SEE HERE 
YEAH I GUESS SO 
TRADE YOU 
NOW I WAS SENT A COUPLE OF 
THINGS TO MODIFY OUR UH NEW REQUIREMENTS 
UM THE REMOTE'S ONLY GONNA BE FOR THE TELEVISION 
WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE WE ALREADY DECIDED Y YOUR YOUR RESEARCH SHOWED THAT UH NOT ONLY USE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE MORE COMPLICATED 
IT'S MORE COST MORE COSTLY 
AND YOUR OR UH RESEARCH SHOWED THAT YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN USE IT 
I THINK UH YOU SAID FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ONLY USE HALF THE OR TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS 
SO IF WE REMOVE THE UNIVERSAL REMOTE THEN THAT SOLVES THAT PROBLEM 
UM NO TELETEXT 
UM 
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT 
UM BUT WE DO HAVE TO USE THE THE COMPANY WANTS US TO INCORPORATE THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND OUR SLOGAN WHICH IS WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
AND OUR CORPORATE COLOURS OR GREY AND YELLOW 
AND WE COULD PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH BLACK IT BUT 
SO THESE ARE THE OTHER UM THE OTHER NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT I WAS TOLD 
WE NEED TO USE 
UM FROM ALL ALL THREE OF YOUR UH PRESENTATIONS I THINK THAT WE WERE IN THE RIGHT TRACK A LOT IN OUR LAST MEETING 
UM 
WE WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD 
UM WE WANT SOMETHING THAT'S SIMPLE 
WE WANT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN FIND EASILY 
UM 
AND THE SPEECH RECOGNITION I I GUESS IS KIND OF UH GIVE OR TAKE 
IT'S GONNA COST MORE 
SO THE YOUNG THE YOUNGER PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY LIKE IT 
BUT UM IT'S 
PROBABLY I WOULD SAY PROBABLY NOT WORTH THE INVESTMENT AT THIS POINT IN TIME 
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST DO AWAY WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION 
UM 
AND THAT WAY WE CAN FOCUS ON OUR FORM 
THAT'D BE THAT'D BE GOOD IF WE WERE GOING WITH OUR OUR BALL 
OR OR WITH YOU KNOW I GUESS WITH ANY FROM THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE THE CHARGER 
FOR YOU KNOW WE COULD USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES IN THE REMOTE 
AND THAT WOULD BE OR SOLAR 
OR YOU KNOW HOWEVER HOWEVER YOU WANTED TO GO ABOUT AT THE HOLDER COULD ALSO BE THE CHARGING UNIT 
UM 
WITH THE LOCATOR BUTTON 
UM AND IF IT WERE THE BALL YOU'D NO LONGER HAVE TO HAVE A FLAT SPACE ON IT 
UM LIKE IF WE STILL HAVE THE HOW TO HOLD ON IT IT AND 
IT'S GONNA ROLL AWAY 
UM 
SO I GUESS AFTER THE MEETING WE'LL HAVE SOME QUESTIONNAIRES 
AND UH 
AND SOME SUMMARIES FOR FOR WHAT'S GOING ON 
UM THEN WE'LL TAKE LUNCH 
THEN WE CAN COME BACK AND UH WORK ON OUR INDIVIDUAL WORK 
UM 
I'LL DO THE MINUTES 
UH LET'S SEE 
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY IN YOUR WAY FOR UH 
WORKING WITH THE COMPONENTS 
UM CHIPS THE WHAT CHIPS WE NEED AND WHAT UH 
YOU KNOW HOW TO POWER IT AND WHATNOT 
USER INTERFACE CONCEPT WE WANT TO TO BE SOMETHING SIMPLE 
UM 
MINIMAL NUMBER OF BUTTONS 
I GUESS OR I GUESS OUR MAIN UM 
MAIN THING THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON UNTIL THEN IS PROBABLY DECIDING ON A CERTAIN LIKE YOU KNOW 
DID YOU HAVE TIME EARLIER TO TO WORK ON THAT 
DID YOU GUYS FEEL YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME IN BETWEEN OUR MEETINGS TO GET EVERYTHING DONE THAT YOU NEED TO GET DONE 
'KAY 
MM-HMM 
UM 
SHALL WE MAYBE SHOOT FOR A A SPECIFIC UH TARGET GROUP 
THAT WAY WE COULD L I MEAN 
IF IT WERE IF WE WERE SHOOTING FOR YOUNG GUYS THEN IT'S UM A CERTAIN LOOK AT THE REMOTE 
OR GIRLS OR OLDER PEOPLE 
UM 
WOULD THAT YOU THINK THAT WOULD HELP US FIND ME A SPECIFIC FORM 
THAT WE WOULD WOULD WANNA PICK IT 
'KAY 
SO 
UM WE KNOW THAT THE REMOTE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE WE'LL JUST SAY WE'VE GOT A COLOUR SCHEME FOR IT 
UM YELLOW AND YOU KNOW YELLOW IT'S NICE AND BRIGHT WITH THE BUTTONS BEING GREY OR BLACK 
AND OUR SLOGAN PASTED SOMEWHERE ON IT IN THE THE BOTTOM OR THE YOU KNOW 
UM 
MAYBE WE COULD SKETCH A SO BASICALLY 
ALL OF OUR REMOTES ALL OF OUR TYPICAL REMOTES NOW OR JUST KIND OF A RECTANGULAR SORT 
YOU KNOW 
UM MAYBE WE COULD FLARE IT OR SOMETHING 
YOU KNOW 
SO IT'S MORE OF COURSE THIS WILL LOOK LIKE A BONE THEN 
GO AHEAD AND ERASE THIS 
UM 
HOPE EVERYONE MEMORISED THAT UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH EVERYBODY'S GOT A MOBILE PHONE RIGHT 
EXCEPT FOR ME NOW 
OH 
BUT THEY ARE ALL YOU KNOW MOBILE PHONES UM THEY'VE KIND OF TAKEN A TURN IT WHERE THEY'RE REALLY SMALL 
UM WHICH MAY DEFEAT OUR PURPOSE FOR BEING ABLE TO LOCATE OUR REMOTE ALL THE TIME 
BUT THEN AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT YOU KNOW LIKE THE FIRST MOBILE PHONE THAT WAS THIS BIG AND YOU HAD A HANDBAG TO CARRY IT AROUND ONE 
UM 
SO WE'VE GOT BASICALLY WHAT 
REMOTES LOOK LIKE NOW IS KIND OF WHAT WE'RE 
WHAT WE'RE STUCK WITH 
UM 
MAYBE WE COULD GO WITH A SQUARE OR SOMETHING 
UM 
UM YOU KNOW WITH MINIMAL NUMBER OF BUTTONS 
I GUESS YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW ONE THROUGH NINE 
FOR TYPING IN YOUR CHANNELS 
OH YOU'VE GOT 
VOLUME UP AND DOWN 
CHANNEL UP AND DOWN 
POWER 
USUALLY AT THE TOP 
UM A MUTE 
THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL YOU AND I THINK 
UM 
A MENU BUTTON MAYBE 
SO YOU KNOW 
IF YOU 
IF WE WANT THE REMOTE TO DO OTHER THINGS LIKE UM OR I GUESS THE T. V. TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE TINT AND THE COLOUR AND YOU KNOW ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS THAT ARE BUILT INTO T. V. S 
WE JUST HAVE THAT UNDER ONE STANDARD MENU BUTTON WHERE YOU GO IN PRESS THE MENU BUTTON SCROLL UP AND DOWN TO SELECT IT 
UM 
'KAY SO 
UM 
MM-HMM 
LIKE A WHEEL ON YOUR MOUSE 
SORT OF 
'S A GOOD IDEA 
MM-HMM 
LIKE G YEAH 
LOOKS GOOD 
AT THE THUMB 
YEAH 
YEAH SO EVERYONE WHO IN HERE'S RIGHT HANDED LEFT HANDED 
YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT HANDED 
YEAH 
SO I'M LEFT HANDED BUT I SEE I CAN SAY THAT MOST THINGS ARE DESIGNED FOR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE 
LIKE THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE 
OR ENGLISH 
MAYBE 
WE 
I WOULD SAY I MEAN IT SHOULD BE PROBABLY DESIGNED FOR A RIGHT HANDED P PERSON 
UM BUT THAT'S THAT'S GOOD 
THAT'S W I THINK WE'VE GOT A KIND OF A GOOD PLAN THERE 
UM 
AT LEAST FOR WHAT BUTTONS WE'RE GONNA USE 
UM 
SO WE'VE GOT UH 
I LIKE THE SCROLL THE SCROLL ACTION AND THE 
YEAH 
KINDA LIKE HOLDING A 
YEAH 
SO TWO REMOTES IN ONE 
BUT THEN WOULD BE EASIER TO LOSE 
ONE OR THE OTHER 
IT ACTUALLY USE YOUR COFFEE TABLE 
OKAY 
WELL WE NEED TO FINISH UP HERE 
UM 
SO FOR THE NEXT 
SO FOR THE NEXT UM BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING WE UH SH SHALL WE WORK ON YOU'RE WATCHING TRENDS TO SEE WHAT WHAT KIND OF NEW INFORMATION WE'VE GOT GOING ON 
UM 
MANUEL YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON THE COMPONENTS FOR FOR WHAT WE'RE GONNA USE 
LET'S GO WITH OUR OUR UH ROUNDED 
KIND OF FIT IN YOUR HAND LET'S EXPLORE UH THE THE UH POSSIBILITY OF HAVING THE TWO PIECE 
SO ONE FOR THE THE QUICK ZAPPING UM AND POSSIBLY ONE YOU KNOW WITH JUST THAT ROUNDED PART THAT FITS INTO YOUR HAND 
UM 
AND RYAN YOU WORK ON UM HOW HOW WELL THEY'LL WORK WITH THE USE WITH THE USER 
SO BOTH OF THOSE CONCEPTS 
AND UH OKAY I THINK WE MADE SOME GOOD PROGRESS HERE 
SO YOU ONE 
I DUNNO 
I G I GUESS WE'LL TAKE LUNCH 
NO BUT UH HALF AN HOUR 
OR I GUESS WE'LL BE TAKING LUNCH SHORTLY AND THEN THEN IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER THAT WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE ANOTHER MEETING 
OKAY 
DO 
UH W YES SO I'VE LO I'VE DONE THE ROLE THAT I WAS ASKED TO DO ANYWAY 
I THINK 
SLIDE SHOW 
JUST PRESS THE ARROW KEYS I THINK 
USUALLY GOES TO IT 
SO SO IT JU JUST JUST JUST USING IT YEAH 
A REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
JUST REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
I THINK 
THAT'S WHAT I GUESS 
YEAH 
HAVING JUST LISTENED TO WHAT CORINNE JUST SAID I'LL DRAW ON SOME OF THE THINGS AS WELL 
SOME THINGS THAT SORT OF RELEVANT TO WHAT I WANNA SAY 
'KAY SO I'M JUST GONNA YEAH APPROACH THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
UM THE METHOD I SAID WAS TO EXPLORE THE UH TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF A REMOTE CONTROL 
AND IT S SIMPLEST APPROACH THAT I COME TO USE IS TO CHANGE PROGRAMME AND OPERATE AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE REMOTELY 
I MEAN THAT'S AN OBVIOUS THING TO SAY BUT IT'S NOT ATTACHED TO THE DEVICE THAT YOU WANT TO CONTROL 
UM I HAD SOME THINGS SENT TO ME 
NOT VERY MUCH 
TO LOOK AT SIMILAR DEVICES 
UM DEFINED IN SOME THEM 
AND THEN THE PERSONAL PREFERENCES THAT I WILL SUGGEST 
UM WE DISCUSSED A UNIVERSAL ONE 
UM LIKE IT'S JUST BEEN BROUGHT UP AGAIN THEN 
BUT I THINK A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL IS ACTUALLY QUITE A DIFFICULT OBJECT TO DESIGN 
AND PO POSSIBLY WITHIN MAYBE THE BUDGET THAT WE DO IT UM BECAUSE YOU'D NEED TO KNOW ALL THE SPEF SPECIFICATIONS OF A ALL THE LIKE ELECTRONIC COMPANIES 
I'M NOT SURE HAVE YOU EVER COME ACROSS A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL YOURSELF 
BUT YOU HAVE TO I THEY'RE A NIGHTMARE TO USE 
YOU HAVE TO SET THEM RESET THEM TO EVERYTHING 
UM AND THAT WOULD ONLY ADD BUTTONS 
WHEREAS I THINK THE UM SO TO TAKE AWAY BUTTONS 
SO I THINK IT'D BE BETTER MAYBE TO CONCENTRATE ON MAYBE JUST A UNIVERSAL ONE FOR T. V. S 
UM OR MAYBE JUST ONE THAT YOU COULD WE COULD DESIGN AND THEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
MANUFACTURERS COULD USE IT TO SIT AT THEIR SPECIFICATIONS OF OF THE UM SO TO GET SOMETHING THAT'S UNIQUE IN DESIGN 
UM 
OKAY HERE HERE'S JUST TWO PICTURES OF REMOTE CONTROLS 
THEY'RE JUST SIMPLE T. V. REMOTE CONTROLS 
BUT ONE IS UH USER CENTRED 
THAT IS THE IN IN THE LEFT 
AND YOU CAN STRAIGHT AWAY AS THERE'S LESS BUTTONS 
AND THE OTHER ONE IS ENGINEER CENTRED WHERE THAT'S MORE UH SPECIFIED FOR THE SORT OF THE ELABORATE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IT'S TRYING TO CONTROL UM 
WHICH APPEALS MORE AT THE PRODUCT THAT WE WANT AND ON WHAT THE HAVE SAID AND THE MARKET RESEARCH AND STUFF PROBABLY LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE USER CENTRED 
FEWER BUTTONS SIMPLER TO USE AND IF TEN PERCENT UM SO HIDDEN WAY OF TEN PERCENT IS WHAT'S SAID 
MAYBE THE OTHER FIFTY PERCENT THE BUTTONS THAT ARE USED VERY RARELY LIKE PROGRAMMING 
THEY COULD BE HIDDEN MAYBE UNDER SOME REMOTE CONTROLS YOU MIGHT HAVE COME ACROSS HAVE MAYBE A LITTLE FLIP THE THING WHERE THEY'RE HIDDEN AWAY 
AND THE MAIN BUTTONS ARE THE ONES YOU ARE THE ONES YOU COME ACROSS 
UM AND FINALLY UM UH SORT I'VE SORT OF COVERED THAT OUR PRODUCT I THINK SHOULD BE USER INTERFACE ORIENTATED 
UM 
LIKE I USED TO CONCENTRATE ON T. V. REMOTE CONTROL A UNIVERSAL REMOTE MIGHT BE TOO COMPLEX 
UM AND SO WHAT TO THE MAJOR FINDINGS MARKET RESEARCHERS HAVE SAID IT'S THE IMAGE AND THE APPEARANCE THAT PEOPLE DI DISLIKE 
SO THAT WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON SOMETHING THAT WOULD SET A TREND 
AND THEN AND CHANGE THE FASHION OF REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND THAT'S IT 
NO SOMETHING ON THE IMAGE OF IT 
UH THE OF THE ACTUAL DESIGN 
I THINK SPEECH RECOGNITION WAS 
UH ONE OF THESE THINGS WHERE UM THEY HAVE TO BE REALLY GOOD FOR THEM TO WORK 
'CAUSE SOMETIMES YOU FIND YOURSELF JUST SAYING THINGS OVER AND O IF IT'S IN YOUR PHONE 
AND YOU NEED TO SORT OF TAKE INTO LIGHT LANGUAGES AND THEN DIFFERENT DIALECTS I SUPPOSE AS WELL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND W I DON'T KNOW IF WOULD WOULD YOU WANT TO KEEP SAYING STUFF IF YOU WERE WATCHING STUFF 
IF YOU WERE WATCHING SOMETHING WOULD YOU SORT OF BE WANTING 
YEAH 
I THINK 
AS WELL IT'D BE J THE GIMMICK FACTOR FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE 
BUT PRACTICALLY I DON'T THINK IT'S 
YEAH 
IT'LL WEAR OFF 
DO YOU WANNA PUT YOUR CORD BACK IN 
I DID HAVE HAVE A THOUGHT ABOUT THE SORT OF THE TRACKING THING 
SO THAT IF IT CAME WITH MAYBE A HOLDER 
OR HOLSTER WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT 
UM THAT YOU YOU SHOULD PUT IT BACK IN 
YOUR REMOTE 
BUT IF YOU DON'T PUT IT BACK IN YOU PRESS SOMETHING LIKE A LITTLE BUTTON ON THAT 
AND THAT JUST SORT OF SENDS OUT A BEEP TO FIND WHERE IT IS OR SOMETHING 
JUST BY INFRARED 
THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO COMPLEX I WOULD'VE THOUGHT 
YEAH IT WOULD BE QUITE GOOD 
THE BALL COULD SIT ON A 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'LL YEAH I'LL HAVE A LOOK TRY LOOK AT THE ACTUAL APPEARANCE IN THE NEXT BREAK 
I TH I I D STILL THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS ULTIMATELY ONE HANDED 
THE BALL IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA 
AND EVEN SOMETHING THAT'S HELD LIKE THAT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT 
SO THAT I THINK IT STILL HAS TO BE A VARIATION 
NO MAYBE A 
A RECT ON A RECTANGLE BUT MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY USE 
BORING AS PLAIN AS A RECTANGLE 
DO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MIGHT COPE WITH LIKE THE TREND WATCHING 
I FIND ANYTHING MORE ON THAT 
YEAH 
BOTTOM PERHAPS YEAH 
YOU I MEAN IT MIGHT BE TO LOOK AT SORT OF THE THE SHAPE AND TREND OF LIKE THINGS LIKE MOBILE PHONES 
AND THE SHAPES THAT THE THEY'VE BEEN GOING 
THEY'VE GONE FROM BIG BRICK BLOCK THINGS WHICH IS A REMOTE CONTROL IS IT SORT OF SLINKY SMALL THINGS 
YEAH 
YES SO 
AT THE THUMB YEAH 
MAYBE THE BUTTONS COULD LIKE UH 
DECREASE ONE IS THE BIGGER ONES YOU KNOW THEY COULD ACTUALLY BE BIGGER IN SIZE THAN THE ONES THAT OR LESS IMPORTANT THE SMALLER HERE 
YEAH 
BEHIND 
DEFINITELY 
JUST LIKE O ON A SORT OF SIDE VIEW 
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW IT WOULD SORT OF FIT IN THE HAND BETTER 
SO YOU KNOW YOU JUST SORT OF HAVE YOUR HAND 
YEAH 
RIGHT ON THE AND YOUR THUMB WOULD BE UP HERE TYPE THING 
YEAH THAT'S ALSO TRUE 
INSTANTLY SORT OF ALWAYS GOING FOR THE RIGHT HANDED PERSON 
BUT I MEAN THE OLDER SO 
RIGHT HANDED YEAH 
I MEAN I'M JUST JUST THINKING MAYBE 
IF IT WAS UM 
CIRCULAR 
UM 
WITH THE SORT OF THAT SORT OF THE SORT OF EARLY DO WE HAD WITH THE WAY THAT WAS MORE LIKE THAT 
WHEREAS THIS IS JUST A ONE HANDED THING THAT YOU SORT OF ALMOST WRAP ROUND THE THUMB 
SO YOU'D HAVE YOUR YOU'D PUT YOUR HAND NOT THERE WITH THE THUMB THERE 
AND THEN YOUR THUMB WOULD DO YOU'D HAVE ALL THE BUTTONS SORT OF AROUND HERE 
AND THAT I THINK COULD WORK 
IN ANY HAND 
IF YOU JUST HAD TO LIKE WRAPPED ROUND THERE 
LEFT OR RIGHT 
MINIMISE ITS SIZE 
IT COULD BE YOU KNOW REALLY QUITE SMALL 
YEAH 
ZAPPING FUNCTIONS 
YEP 
YEAH 
HOW WELL IT'LL WORK YEAH 
YEAH 
EIGHT 
F. EIGHT 
JUST JUS YEAH 
CABLE THERE 
THANK YOU 
OKAY 
GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE WORKING DESIGN OF THE INTERIORS BASICALLY WHICH IS WHAT DICTATES THE DESIGN THE BOTH THE INTERFACE BASICALLY AND THE OUTER APPEARANCE BECAUSE THIS IS ALL THE STUFF THAT NEEDS TO GO IN THERE 
RIGHT 
SO UNFORTUNATELY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO 
DO THIS LITTLE PRESENTATION FOR ME OBVIOUSLY WERE TOO DRUNK TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH IT IS UM I'M GOING TO DO A LOT OF THE STUFF ON THE BOARD 
UM JUST 
THIS IS THE BASIC 
BASIC PREMISE OF A REMOTE CONTROL 
UM THE BASIC FUNCTION IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO ANOTHER SYSTEM 
OKAY SO MUCH IS CLEAR 
AN ENERGY SOURCE FEEDS AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LIKE A CHIP THAT CAN COMPOSE MESSAGES 
OFTEN IN THE FORM OF INFRARED BITS 
THIS IS THE MOST MOSTLY USED 
UM THERE'S UH ALSO SOME SOUND SYSTEMS BUT INFRARED IS 
THE BETTER OR THE MORE MORE USED SYSTEM 
UM PARTS ARE CHEAPER AS WELL 
A USER INTERFACE CONTROLS THE CHIP AND ACCORDINGLY THE MESSAGES 
THIS IS WHERE MY PEOPLE SCREWED UP BASICALLY 
SO I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT IN THE BOARD RATHER 
UM WHAT WE HAVE IS DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT OBVIOUSLY NEED TO GO IN THERE 
WE'LL START WITH AN ENERGY SOURCE 
RIGHT 
UM WHICH IS USUALLY A BATTERY RIGHT 
SINCE IT'S NOT FEASIBLE TO ADD A CABLE TO THAT 
THIS ENERGY SOURCE OF COURSE IS CONNECTED TO 
THE 
THE USER INTERFACE ITSELF 
UH WHICH CAN BE BUTTONS WHATEVER WHICH IN FACT 
CONTROLS A CHIP 
RIGHT 
THIS IS THE USER INTERFACE AND THERE WE HAVE THE CHIP 
UM THE WAY THIS GOES NORMALLY IS THAT THIS CHIP THEN CONTROLS AN INFRARED LAMP 
THAT SENDS OUT THE SIGNAL 
OF COURSE THE SIGNAL DIFFERS ACCORDINGLY 
UM DEPENDING ON WHAT THE CHIP TELLS THE INFRARED LAN LAMP 
AND 
OF COURSE THAT'S CONTROLLED THE CHIP ITSELF IS CONTROLLED BY THE USER INTERFACE 
THE WAY YOU NORMALLY NORMALLY DO IT IS THAT YOU ADD A LITTLE DEVICE SUCH AS A LAMP 
AT THE WHOLE THING AS WELL SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S WORKING BASICALLY 
YOU PRESS SOMETHING YOU GOT A RESPONSE 
WHICH IS ALSO COMPARATIVELY UM IMPORTANT IN ONE OF THESE DEVICES 
NOW THIS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE OR WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE DISCUSSED ARE THESE TWO COMPONENTS MOSTLY 
THE 
THE UH ENERGY SOURCE FOR ONE THING CAN BE ALTERED 
WHAT WE PROBABLY CANNOT ALTER IS OF COURSE THE INFRARED THE SENDING DEVICE BASICALLY THE INFRARED LAMP 
WE CANNOT CHANGE THE CHIP WHICH CONTROLS THE INFRARED LAMP 
RIGHT 
THESE TWO OR COMPONENTS THAT WE HAVE TO USE AND THESE ARE DICTATED BY THE WHOLE FUNCTION OF THE WHOLE THING 
UM THE LAMP CAN BE PUT INTO THE DOES THE DEVICE 
IT C IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THERE 
THIS CAN BE DISCUSSED AS WELL 
THE USER INTERFACE 
THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ALSO DISCUSS 
UM SO WE'VE HEARD 
UH SPEECH RECOGNITION IS THE HYPE OBVIOUSLY IN THE MOMENT 
SPEECH RECOGNITION UM INTERFACE WE DON'T KNOW THAT 
OR IF WE JUST DO THE USUAL BUTTON THING 
ARE WE HAVE A TOUCH PAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DISCUSS 
AND OF COURSE THE ENERGY SOURCE 
BATTERIES 
SOLAR CELLS 
WHO KNOWS 
OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS A QUESTION WHETHER THIS THIS COMPONENTS ARE IN FACT AVAILABLE CHEAP ENOUGH DEVELOPED ENOUGH 
BUT THAT'S LIKE I SEE I SUPPOSE RATHER UP TO MARKETING AND NOT TOO 
AT THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN DEPARTMENT 
EXPENSIVE IT'S GONNA BE GET UH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
OH RIGHT 
GO 
MM-HMM 
WELL YOU STILL DO 
YOU SEE YOU STILL 
W YEAH 
YOU PUT IT ON IT IN THE COUCH TABLE 
WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING IT'S GONNA ROLL OFF 
SO THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE REALLY 
RIGHT 
THAT'S 
MM 
RIGHT 
HM 
THAT'S THE CLASSICAL DESIGN 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
TALKING OF WHICH MAYBE A SCROLLING FUNCTION IS NOT NOT TOO BAD 
IT'S 
TALK ABOUT MAYBE F LOOK AT THAT FROM THE SIDE THERE MAYBE 
WHICH IS TECHNICALLY THE EASIEST OPTION 
WOULD PROBABLY BE LIKE A SCROLLING LITTLE SCROLLING WHEEL LIKE THIS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH SORT OF LIKE THAT 
YOU CAN EVEN 
IF WE'RE COMING FROM MICE WE CAN EVEN ADD A CLICK FUNCTION WHERE YOU IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE INFORMATION YOU JUST PRESS IT DOWN 
RIGHT 
ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO THE ERGONOMICS OF THE WHOLE THING IF YOU WANNA MAKE IT SQUARE FOR THE LOOKS OF IT 
THEN MAYBE TO MAKE IT MORE COMFORTABLE TO HOLD THE WHOLE THING YOU ADD A LITTLE BULGE DOWN HERE 
JUST WHICH MAYBE FROM AN ENGINEERING POINT THIS COULD BE HOLDING THE THE BATTERIES AND SO NO 
I KNOW 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING IT HERE FEL LOOK AT IT FROM THE SIDE 
IT'S LIKE THAT 
RIGHT 
OH 
THEN YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND LIKE THIS 
AND MAYBE YOU BRING THE BUTTONS NEARER TO THE OR THE IMP MORE IMPORTANT BUTTONS NEARER TO THE AT THE SIDE 
RIGHT 
MM 
RIGHT 
YOU CAN ALSO HAVE TO MAYBE TALKING ABOUT MOBILE PHONES AGAIN SLIDING OPEN 
WITH THE LESSER USED FUNCTIONS ON THIS PART AND THEN IT SLIDES INTO THAT PART 
AND IT 
MM WELL I WAS JUST THINKING THIS THIS OF COURSE CAUSES 
CAUSES A PROBLEM UM FOR LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE ACTUALLY 
SO 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
RIGHT 
THAT MINIMISES IT SIZE WISE AS WELL 
MM 
THEN THERE'S MAYBE 
ANOTHER POINT OF MAKING IT A TWO IN ONE KIND OF THING 
IF WE HAVE A SMALLER 
A SMALLER DEVICE THAT ACTUALLY FITS INTO THE BIG ONE 
YOU GIVE IT THE FULL FUNCTIONS IN HERE AND JUST A COUPLE OF FUNCTIONS IN THERE 
LIKE YOUR ZAP ZAPPING DEVICE IS JUST U CHANNELS UP DOWN UH VOLUME AND ON OFF 
THAT'S IT 
MAYBE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
MEANS THE BIG ONE HAS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BIG 
AND PERHAPS HEAVY SO YOU CAN'T MOVE IT AROUND 
MAKE IT A PIECE OF FURNITURE 
YES 
YES THERE YOU GO 
OR A STATUE OR SOMETHING 
RIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
YEP 
OKAY 
YEP 
CAN I HAVE YOUR CABLE PLEASE 
THANKS 
OKAY SO I WAS LOOKING AT TREND WATCHING 
UM UNFORTUNATELY I WASN'T GIVEN TOO MUCH INFORMATION 
I WAS GIVEN A BRIEF EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND THEN AN UPDATE ON SOME RECENT FASHION TRENDS THAT WE MIGHT LIKE TO LOOK AT 
AND THEN I'LL JUST TELL YOU SOME PERSONAL PREFERENCES THAT I GOT FROM THAT 
UM OKAY THE MOST IMPORTANT FINDING WAS THAT THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL SEEMS TO BE TWICE AS IMPORTANT TO THE USERS USE THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN 
WHICH I THINK WE'VE KIND OF ALREADY DISCUSSED BEFORE 
UM THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT FINDING WAS THAT THE REMOTE SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
AND AGAIN THESE ARE ALL THINGS WE'VE KIND OF ALREADY COME UP WITH IN OUR OWN ABOUT THIS JUST BACKS IT UP 
AND THIRDLY THE REMOTE WOULD BE EASY TO USE 
SO FAR AS FASHION UPDATE WE'VE LEARNED THAT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE 
SO THAT MIGHT BE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE TO INCORPORATE THIS INTO OUR REMOTE BUT WE CAN TRY 
UM AND ALSO AS OPPOSED TO LAST YEAR THIS YEAR THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY ONE FILE 
OKAY SO FROM THAT UM SO WE'VE ALREADY SAID WE NEED TO FOCUS ON A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
UM I THINK WE'VE ALREADY DISCOVERED THAT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO GO AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL RECTANGULAR DESIGN 
BUT I THINK THAT EVEN IF IT'S VERY SUBTLE WE NEED TO KIND OF TRICK OUR CONSUMERS 
SO THEY AT LEAST GET THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE GETTING SOMETHING THAT'S NEW AND MODERN AND SLEEK AND 
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE SHAPE OR THE COLOURS ARE ALL OF THAT 
UM FOR TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE TRACKING DEVICE 
WE BROUGHT UP THE IDEA OF HAVING TWO PIECES WHICH WE COULD DISCUSS FURTHER 
AND MANUEL HAD SUGGESTED UM THE ENERGY SOURCE AND THE USER INTERFACE DISCUSSING SOME OF THIS UM THAT WE COULD CHANGE A LITTLE BIT 
WE NEED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE HAVE LIMITED BUTTONS WHICH I THINK THE TWO PIECE IDEA MIGHT BE REALLY BENEFICIAL FOR 
UM WE NEED TO INCORPORATE THIS FASHION TREND OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I GUESS THE TWO OPTIONS OR IF WE HAD OUR REMOTE IN THE SHAPE OF A FRUIT OR VEGETABLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
OR WITH EXTERIOR DESIGNS 
BUT MY QUESTION IS I MEAN THE STEREOTYPICALLY SPEAKING YOU KIND OF PICTURE MALES WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY'D FEEL ABOUT HAVING FRUITY LOGOS ON THE OUTSIDE 
SO MAYBE WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S SOMEWHAT REMOVABLE OR I DON'T KNOW DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR FEMALE MALE TARGET GROUPS 
AND THEN THE SPONGY FEEL 
I GUESS WE COULD LOOK AT MOBILE PHONES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT'S IT THERE 
C AND LOOK AT DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIAL THAT MIGHT PLEASE OUR USERS WHO WANT SPONGY FEELING REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO THAT'S THAT 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WHEN YOU BY YOUR REMOTE YOU CAN BUY 
VARIOUS COVERINGS 
PERSONALISE YOUR REMOTE 
MM-HMM 
DUNNO 
SPONGY 
YOU PROBABLY NOT YEAH 
MM 
NO 
HMM 
MM 
LIKE A COVERING 
YEAH 
THE WE CAN HAVE THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THE SPONGY PARTS SO THEY CAN REMOVE IT 
MM 
MM 
BRIGHT CITRUS COLOURS YEAH 
OH YEAH 
YELLOW AND GREY 
I THINK HAVING A SHAPE COULD BE A LITTLE RIDICULOUS LIKE 
WELL WE KINDA D YEAH 
AND IF IT'S YELLOW 
GREY BUTTONS YEAH 
MM 
OH 
NICE 
COULD LOOK LIKE A FRUIT BOWL 
'KAY 
SO SO THE TWO PIECE IDEA TO 
OR HAVE WE NOT DECIDED 
OH RIGHT OKAY 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
WELL WHAT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID LIKE PUTTING THE 
FINGER GRIPS JUST ON TOP OF THE PLASTIC 
YEAH 
SO THEN FOR THE SCROLL ARE WE GOING FOR THE IPOD TYPE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
SO EVERYONE HERE 
OKAY 
THIS IS OUR CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING 
AND 
I'LL JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES AND UH GO THROUGH THE PREVIOUS MINUTES 
UM THEN EACH OF YOU WILL HAVE YOUR PRESENTATION UM AND THEN WE WILL NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ON THE CONCEPT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE UH FORTY MINUTES FOR FINISHING UP 
UM 
I'LL GO THROUGH THE MEE THROUGH THE MINUTES FIRST 
UM WE JUST REFRESHED OUR OUR UH GOAL OF MAKING THE FINEST REMOTE CONTROL AVAILABLE 
UM WE DECIDED THAT ARE WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO USE COMPANY COLOURS COMPANY LOGO 
UM AND 
OUR MARKETING EXPERT UH GIVE US SOME I UH INFORMATION FROM INTERVIEWS WITH A HUNDRED DIFFERENT REMOTE USERS 
UM WITH SOME STATISTICS THAT BACKED BASICALLY WHAT WE WERE THINKING BEFORE 
PEOPLE THOUGHT THEIR REMOTES WERE UGLY UM 
UM 
THAT REMOTES ZAP A LOT 
UM THEY ONLY USE UH A FINITE AMOUNT OF BUTTONS 
UM AND THAT THEY OFTEN LOSE THE IT'S EASY TO LOSE A REMOTE 
UM WHICH WERE ALL THINGS WE WERE THINKING WE WOULD WANNA MAKE IT SIMPLE 
UM 
AND UH SOME SORT OF LOCATOR 
THERE A BUTTON OR TRACKING DEVICE 
UM 
AND THAT IT SHOULD LOOK DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S OUT THERE 
UM 
KIND OF MIXED MIXED RESPONSE ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
THE YOUNGER PEOPLE SAID THEY WANTED TO OLDER PEOPLE DID NOT 
UM UH I THINK WE DECIDED THAT 
UM THE EXPENSE WAS NOT NECESSARILY WORTH IT AND THAT IT WAS PROBABLY A GIMMICK THAT UM WOULD INCREASINGLY WEAR ON THE CONSUMERS' NERVES 
UM 
THEN THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER UM EXPLORED SOME OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE 
UM THE SIMPLE VERSUS THE UM THE COMPLEX 
THE SIMPLE ONE BEING BETTER FOR A USER THE COMPLEX BETTER FOR AN ENGINEER 
UM 
UM AND SOME PERSONAL PREFERENCES THAT WERE FOUND IN THAT WOULD BE THAT IT SHOULD BE A USER ORIENTED REMOTE SOMETHING SIMPLE 
UM AND THAT WE DIDN'T WANNA GO WITH A UNIVERSAL REMOTE BECAUSE UH INCREASING COST AND INCREASING COMPLEXITY 
UM WE WOULD JUST HAVE A T. V. REMOTE 
UM AND THAT WE SHOULD ALSO FOCUS ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE REMOTE 
HAVE TO USE BE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT 
AND FINALLY OUR UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UH GIVE US A RUNDOWN OF HOW THE REMOTE WILL WORK 
UM FROM ENERGY SOURCE UM UH WHAT WE WOULD USE 
BATTERIES BECAUSE WE DON'T WANNA HAVE A A CABLE 
UM 
HOW THAT WOULD POWER THE REMOTE AND THE LAMP 
IF WE WERE TO TO HAVE NO 
UH UM THE USER INTERFACE THEN WOULD CONNECT IT A CHIP WHICH WOULD WORK WITH THE INFRARED CONTROLS UH TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO THE T. V. 
UM 
I BELIEVE THEN WE COME UP WITH A COUPLE OF IDEAS FOR WHAT WE THINK THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE WILL BE 
UM 
UM SOMETHING THAT WILL FIT INTO UH EASILY INTO SOMEONE'S HAND 
AND WITH A JUST A FEW BUTTONS 
JUST THE BASICS 
AND WITH A SCROLLING UM FUNCTION ALSO 
OKAY AND I WILL LEAVE THAT LEAVE IT TO THAT 
SO 
MARKETING 
WE'RE WATCHING TRENDS 
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU CAN HAVE THIS 
A BANANA SHAPE 
SO POSSIBLY LIKE A UH SORRY JUST TO BUTT IN FOR A SECOND 
POSSIBLY UH LIKE A COVER LIKE THEY HAVE FOR MOBILE PHONES 
YOU HAVE ONE WITH A FLAG AND ONE WITH A BANANA AND NO THAT'S A SPONGY 
FEEL IT IT 
YOU CAN 
MM VARIOUS COVERS 
WE COULD LEAVE THAT AT THE COVER DEPARTMENT 
WE ALL KNOW THEY'VE GOT NOTHING TO DO ALL DAY 
NOTICE THE GIANT DOG BONE SHAPE 
ALSO GOOD FOR ANIMALS 
WHAT'S THE APPROXIMATE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE TITANIUM 
WORKS WELL IN ARIZONA BUT IN EDINBURGH NOT SO 
NO I THINK I THINK BATTERIES ARE PROBABLY THE WAY TO GO 
YEAH 
SO THE RU WAIT THE RUBBERY WE CAN SHAPE IT HOWEVER WE WANT 
OR THE RUBBERY WE CANNOT 
'KAY 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
SO THAT ONE OPTION A PLASTIC SHELL WITH A RUBBERY COATING ON TO CERTAIN SPOTS 
WHAT ABOUT A SMALL 
IT AT THE REMOTE 
YELLOW AND GREY 
GRAPEFRUIT 
I WOULD SAY IF I WERE TO MAKE A DECISION I WOULD PROBABLY PUT THE FRUIT ASPECT AT THE LOWER LOWER END OF THE SPECTRUM OF OF IMPORTANCE 
UM 
WELL PERHAPS THE IMPLIED SHAPE WILL BE ENOUGH TO LURE THAT FRUIT MINDED REMOTE BUYER 
IT'S IT'S YELLOW 
IT'S CURVED 
IT'S SORT OF COUPLE OF COUPLE OF GREY STRIPES 
WE COULD PUT THE GREY STRIPES ON THE BOTTOM IS THAT THAT PERSON COULD TURN IT OVER 
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE A BANANA JUST SITTING ON THEIR TABLE 
RATHER THAN RATHER TH 
MAYBE THE HOLDER IF WE WERE TO HAVE A HOLDER IT COULD BE SHAPED LIKE A FRUIT 
COULD BE IT COULD BE AN APE OR A FRUIT BOWL 
HEY WE COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS HERE 
DO YOU HAVE MORE TO YOUR PRESENTATION 
OH 
OKAY 
I'M GONNA PLUG IN HERE REAL QUICK 
IF I COULD 
LIKE I SAID WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ON 
A COUPLE OF THOSE ITEMS HERE 
UM WE 
WE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UH SO THESE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT WE DO NEED TO MAKE BY THE END OF THIS MEETING 
UM FOR OUR COMPONENTS CONCEPT WE NEED TO COME UP WITH THE ENERGY SOURCE UM THE CHIP ON PRINT AND THE CASE 
PROBABLY CASE UM MATERIAL 
AND PROBABLY A SHAPE ALSO 
UM AND THEN FOR THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT THE TOP WHAT WHAT THE TYPE SO 
AND WHAT KIND OF SUPPLEMENTS WE'LL HAVE 
UM 
ENERGY SOURCE I THINK WE'VE I THINK WE'VE DECIDED BATTERIES ALTHOUGH NOT EXCITING ARE PROBABLY OUR BEST BET 
AND WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES 
'KAY 
SO 
UM I GUESS WE SHOULD PICK THE CASE THEN 
IF WE GO WITH THE PLASTICKY CASE OR THE THE PLASTIC CASE UM 
THEN THE CHIP ON PRINT IS STILL KIND OF WE COULD HAVE THREE OR 
WE COULD HAVE A COMPLEX ONE OR A A NON COMPLEX 
BUT DID WE DECIDE THAT THE RUBBERY FEEL WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO USE 
OKAY 
SO WE WOULD WE WOULD HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
'KAY 
SO I GUESS THE CASE WOULD BE PLASTIC WITH 
PERHAPS THAT'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH RUBBER TO QUALIFY AS BEING PART OF IT 
IT'S MORE OF A SO IT'S MORE OF A SUPPLEMENT MAYBE 
WHICH WILL REQUIRE A MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP ON PRINT RIGHT 
'KAY 
SO 
I GUESS THAT IS THAT IS THAT BUT IT 
SO WE HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TO DO IN THIS 
UM OKAY SO WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER MEETING IN THIRTY MINUTES 
UM 
HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA BE GOING ON 
UM 
UM RYAN YOU'LL BE WORKING ON THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
UM 
MANUEL YOU'LL BE WORKING ON THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN 
CORRINE WE'LL WANT A PRODUCT EVALUATION 
AND THE TWO IF YOU GET TO PLAY WITH THE UH MODELLING COMPONENTS AND UH 
MAYBE AND AND GET IS A PROTOTYPE 
WHICH SHOULD GO ALONG WELL WITH YOUR LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN AND YOUR INTERFACE 
SO THAT BASICALLY JUST BE WORKING ON THE PROTOTYPE UH WE'LL ACCOMPLISH YOUR OTHER TWO ACTIONS 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
LET'S DO IT 
YEP 
UH IT WAS SORT OF BANANA SHAPED 
THIS LIKE YEAH SORT OF SPONGY ONES 
WHAT'S IT CALLED 
CUST YOU PERSONALISED YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WHY CAN'T I SEE THE CRAZY 
UM YEAH I TALKING ABOUT THE INTERFACE CONCEPT AND HOW THE CUSTOMER RELATES TO WELL AS THE CONSUMER WILL USE THE ACTUAL DEVICE 
UM SO I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE STUFF I WAS SENT ME TRY AND GET SOME INSPIRATION 
BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT OUR OWN IDEAS THAT WE HAD 
UM I WAS SENT SOME INFORMATION FROM THE COMPANY SAYING THAT THEY 
THE TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT HAVE DEVISED A NEW SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WHERE YOU CAN PROGRAM QUESTIONS INTO SUCH DEVICES 
THEY GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A COFFEE MACHINE WHERE YOU PROGRAM A QUESTION YOU PROGRAM THE ANSWER AND THE MACHINE RESPONDS ACCORDINGLY 
UM OKAY 
THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS OF A USER CAN USE PRODUCTS L LIKE A REMOTE 
UM THERE'S A GRAPHICAL USE WHERE YOU YOU LOOK AT PICTURES AND 
WELL IN A SCREEN 
A COMMAND LINE WHERE YOU OBVIOUSLY TYPE THINGS IN AND YOU GOT A RESPONSE 
UM AND THEN IT JU THAT'S JUST TO POINT AT THE SORT OF INCONSISTENT U SORT OF USE OF INTERFACE ON REMOTES 
YOU CAN'T REALLY IS THAT PICTURE WELL BUT THERE'S VARIOUS DIFFERENT REMOTES ONCE AGAIN WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS ON MAKING IT MORE COMPLICATED 
SO THEN I HAD A LOOK AT NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE IN THE MARKET 
NOT NECESSARILY REMOTE CONTROLS BUT ONES THAT YOU'LL RECOGNISE 
UM THIS IS THE VOICE THERE IS A VOICE RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL WHICH CAN CONTROL MUS MULTIPLE DEVICES 
I HAVE A THERE IS A PICTURE 
YOU SURF YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS UH WITH YOUR VOICE 
STORE UP TO EIGHTY SPEECH SAMPLES CONTROLS FOUR DEVICES T. V. CABLE SATELLITE V. C. R. D. V. D. AND DO 
AND YOU CAN RECORD YOUR OWN V VERBAL LABELS THAT ARE CONNECTED TO REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS 
SO THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE 
UM THE IN IN THE LEFT IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DREW UP ON THE BOARD ON THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
WHERE THERE HAS SCROLL DOWN FUNCTIONS ON THE SIDE 
YOU CAN SORT OF JUST MAKE THIS IT 
AND THEN ON THE RIGHT SO OBVIOUSLY AN IPOD WHICH IS YOU KNOW POSSIBLY ONE OF THE SIMPLEST THINGS TO USE IT THERE 
AND REALLY SEE AND ALL THAT IS IS JUST A A NICE BIG SCROLL MENU THAT YOU YOU SORT OF GO THROUGH 
THAT IS A 
POSSIBILITY 
AND NOTHING'S SIMPLER REALLY 
UM THEN THERE'S THINGS LIKE THIS WHICH IS A A A KID'S REMOTE 
WHERE THE THE PARENTS HAVE THE FACILITY TO CONTROL AND PROGRAM WHAT CHILDREN CAN WATCH BEFORE 
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL TO O ONLY ALLOWS THEM TO ACCESS THE CHANNELS THAT THEIR PARENTS WANT THEM TO WATCH 
AND UM IT MEANS THAT THE CHILDREN HAVE A NOVELTY OF HAVING THEIR OWN REMOTE CONTROL 
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF HAVING ONE REMOTE CONTR YOU KNOW LIKE WE JUST HAD TWO COMPONENTS 
MAYBE IT CAN HAVE MORE COMPONENTS YOU KNOW DIFFERENT REMOTES 
UM THE POINT MADE OUT THE END THERE HERE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SORT OF BE NEED TO BE CLEAR ON YOUR UM DEVICES 
SO IT WHAT YOU KNOW THINGS YOU SEE 
SOMETIMES AN ARROW POINTING DOWN WHICH MAY SUGGEST VOLUME DOWN COULD BECOME CONFUSED JUST AS A V. FOR VOLUME 
JUST LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH WOULD NEED TO BE MADE CLEAR ON THE DESIGN 
UM I THINK D CARRYING ON FROM WHAT I'VE ALREADY USED A USER FRIENDLY REMOTE WITH MINIMUM BUTTONS 
MAYBE WE'VE AS SUGGESTED THESE TWO PART THING 
WHERE IF IT WAS TO HAVE A SPEECH RECOGNITION THING YOU COULD MAYBE CONTROL THAT IN THE IDEA TO OR PROGRAM ALL THAT IN THE CONTROL BUT 
AND THEN JUST HAVE THE SIMPLE SORT OF HAND HELD THING THAT WE SORT OF DEVISED EARLIER AS THE ACTUAL REMOTE 
UM I DON'T IT COULD BE A GRAPHICAL DISPLAY 
THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTRO THE ACTUAL CONTROL PORT MAYBE COULD HAVE LIKE AN IPOD WHERE YOU JUST SORT OF CONTROL THROUGH THE MENUS 
STUFF LIKE GETS MORE AND MORE COMPLI COMPLICATED 
AND THEN THE THE HAND HELD BIT SHOULD BE ERGONOMICALLY DESIGNED 
AND THAT IS IT 
WHY UM I 
OH YEAH 
JUST 
WHERE ARE WE 
OH 
JUST TO SORT OF SHOW YOU 
UM THEY'VE EVEN GET THINGS LIKE THAT 
HUGE THINGS 
WHICH IS JUST FOR YOUR GR NINETY YEAR OLD GRANDMA YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THAT YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
THINGS 
WHY'S MY SCREEN CRAZY 
MM 
WOULD YOU HAVE TO LEAVE IT BY THE WINDOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WOULD THE SORT OF SPONGY AND THE THE PLASTICKY THING YOU YOU CAN GET THIS MOBILE PHONES THAT INITIALLY HAVE A TO USE PLASTIC BUT THEN THEY HAVE SORT OF A A AS A COVER ON IT WHICH IS JUST SORT OF SOFT AND STUFF 
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD STILL BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE YOU KNOW IN PLASTIC 
BUT THEN WHERE DO PEOPLE HOLD IT 
JUST ALL BE SORT OF SPONGY 
SO YOU USE THE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A A GRAPHICAL DISPLAY ON IT LIKE A SCREEN 
LIKE THE IPOD 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
COULD WE NOT YOU KNOW HAVE A SHAPE WITH A SCROLL AND THE SCREEN 
AND THEN J JUST SORT OF THAT INITIAL SHAPE WE HAD JUST WHICH IS UH SORT OF BANANA ESQUE 
SO THAT'S THING IF WE DID IT YELLOW 
AND UM YOU KNOW YOU JUST P STICK ON JUST SORT OF RUBBER THINGS THAT THAT SORT OF GRIP THE THUMB BIT 
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY THEY'RE JUST IN THE EXTERIOR 
THEY WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY TO THE ACTUAL SHAPE OF THE THING 
YEAH 
MM 
YOU COULD JUST SELL IT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS AS WELL I SUPPOSE 
IN DIFFERENT YE YELLOWS 
I DON'T SUPPOSE WE HAVE TO STICK TO C 
STICK TO THE COLOURS YEAH 
MM GRAPEFRUIT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND IF IT IF IT WAS DONE YELLOW WHICH IS A COMPANY COLOUR 
YEAH 
IN THE THE GR THE RUBBERY GRIPS COULD BE GREY 
YEAH 
IT COULD AND THEN YOU COULD ACTUALLY UH PUT THE BANANA SHAPED THING IN THE FRUIT BOWL 
IN THE COFFEE TABLE AND THEN PEOPLE WOULD ALWAYS KNOW WHERE IT WAS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL WE SORT OF 
RID OF THAT BECAUSE GONNA USE A BATTERY 
AND THE BASE STATION MIGHT NOT BE NECESSARY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
JUST JUST MAYBE YEAH 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK SO 
ALRIGHT 
THAT'S INDUSTRIAL DESIGN FOR CRANES STUFF LIKE THAT 
MAKES SENSE MAKES SENSE 
OH 
WELL LET'S SEE 
I'M GOING TO BORE YOU WITH A 
COUPLE OF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INTERIOR 
JUST TO TO MAKE IT MORE OBVIOUS WHAT WE HAVE TO FIT IN THERE AND THAT WE DO HAVE TO FIT THE STUFF IN THERE 
I'VE MORE INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE MATERIALS UM AS WELL 
WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT DO 
UM BUT LET'S JUST WAIT FOR THIS TO LOAD UP AND I'LL SHOW YOU 
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE 
OKAY 
THE DETAILS OF THE COMPONENTS' DESIGN SO YOU CAN USE THEIR WHAT WE HAVE IS THE BOARD MAIN BOARD OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
THE UNDERSIDE THAT'S PRETTY CHEAP PIECE OF OF TECHNOLOGY REALLY TOP LEFT SIDE YOU CAN USE THE CHIP 
WHICH IS THE WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS WAS IS THE DEVICE TO RECOGNISE THE SIGNALS THE INPUT 
AND IT PASSES IT ON IT A ROW OF UM FURTHER TRANSISTORS AND STUFF LIKE THAT IN THE RIGHT SIDE THAT ACTUALLY AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL 
WHICH LATER ON AS BEING AS BEING TRANSFERRED IT A INFRARED LAMP WHICH 
THEN UM OF COURSE SHINES INFRARED LIGHT ONTO THE TELEVISION WHICH THEN WILL RECOGNISE WHAT SIGNAL UM IT'S GETTING AND WELL DO WHAT YOU TELL IT 
UM 
SO MUCH FOR THE THE WORKINGS OF THE 
OF THE UH 
REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF 
ITS JOB IS TO WAIT FOR YOU TO PRESS A KEY THEN IT TRANSLATE THAT KEY PRESS INTO INFRARED LIGHT SIGNALS UM THAT ARE RECEIVED BY THE TELEVISION 
WHEN YOU PRESS A KEY UM YOU COMPLETE A SPECIFIC CONNECTION 
THE CHIP SENSES THE CONNECTION AND KNOWS WHAT BUTTON YOU PRESSED 
IT PRODUCES A MORSE CODE LINE SIGNAL SPECIFIC TO THAT BUTTON 
RIGHT 
PRETTY CLEAR 
TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIES THE SIGNAL AND THEN SENDS THE M SENDS THE SIGNAL TO THE L. E. D. WHICH TRANSLATES THE SIGNAL INTO INFRARED LIGHT 
THE SENSOR ON THE T. V. CAN USE THE INFRARED LIGHT AND USING THE SIGNAL REACTS APPROPRIATELY 
THIS IS THE CIRCUIT BOARD FROM THE OTHER SIDE 
UM THE LOWER PART OF IT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THAT PROPERLY 
WITH THE GREEN GREENISH BOARD SO SO WHAT WE WHAT WE SAW IN THE FIRST THE FIRST SLIDE JUST FLIPPED OVER 
UM YOU CAN USE THE CIRCUIT BOARD ITSELF 
THAT'S THE CHEAPEST UH WAY TO MAKE ELECTRONIC CONNECTIONS BASICALLY IN THE MARKET 
UM WHAT YOU DO SO YOU HAVE DON'T HAVE CABLES BUT YOU HAVE THE CONNECTIONS ACTUALLY IN THIS IN THESE LINES IN THE ON THE BOARD 
THESE ARE THE ACTUAL KEYS THAT ARE BEING PRESSED 
THEY CLOSE THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT 
THAT THEN SENDS THE SIGNAL TO THE CHIP ON THE OTHER SIDE 
THAT WOULD BE BEHIND HERE 
UM WHICH HE SENDS IT OVER TO THE TRANSISTORS AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT 
AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL AND ALL THAT IS BEING SENT TO THE INFRARED LAMP UP THERE 
NOW SO YOU CAN USE THIS IS THE THE RUBBER BUTTON VERSION OF IT 
UM THE WAY IT WORKS IS THAT YOU HAVE THE KEYS HERE 
THE RUBBER BUTTON HAS A LITTLE METAL UH PLATE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH CLOSES THE CIRCUIT HERE 
AND THUS GIVES ON THE SIGNAL 
NOW THIS IS THE SIMPLE VERSION 
UM WE ARE TALKING UM THIS THIS THE SIMPLE AND CHEAPEST VERSION AT THE SAME TIME 
WE ARE TALKING SOMETHING MORE COMPLICATED OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE AS WELL 
AND NOT ONLY THAT 
UM WE ARE ALSO RESTRICTED IN THE EASE OF OUR OUTER SHELL OR IN THE MATERIAL THAT WE COULD USE FOR OUR OUTER SHELL 
UM I'VE GOTTEN SOME INFORMATION THAT 
WE COULD USE FOR THE CASE MATERIAL PLASTIC 
RUBBER AS WELL 
UM RUBBER THAT IS USED IN THIS ANTI STRESS BALLS 
SO IT'S PRETTY SQUISHY 
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD SERVE THAT PURPOSE 
UM WE COULD ALSO USE WOOD OR TITANIUM 
OH FYA I DON'T HAVE AN INFORMATION ON THAT 
HOWEVER OUR COMPANY OBVIOUSLY CAN PROVIDE US WITH UH WITH THE TITANIUM IS I ASSUME I'M I WAS GIVEN AN OKAY TO USE IT 
IT CERTAINLY IS AN EXPENSIVE MATERIAL I'M AWARE OF THAT BUT I WAS GIVEN AN OKAY 
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS TO CERTAIN MATERIALS 
NOW LET'S FIRST GO THROUGH THE LAST WITH THE MATERIALS 
SO W WHAT WE CAN USE IS PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD AND TITANIUM 
CAN ALSO MIX THESE 
UM SO FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE UM WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT SHORTLY IN THE OTHER MEETING 
UM WHAT WE COULD S S OR WHAT I WAS OFFERED OR WHAT WE COULD USE AS A BASIC BATEER BATTERY 
RIGHT 
UH A DYNAMO 
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH 
UM WE COULD USE SOLAR CELLS 
OR A DEVICE THAT WAS NOT N NOT FURTHER SPECIFIED THAT PROVIDES KINETIC ENERGY 
SUCH AS LIKE WATCHES YOU KNOW 
WHERE YOU JUST MOVE THEM 
M MOVE THE THE ACTUAL DEVICE AND THIS PR UH PROVIDES IT WITH WITH UH SOME ENERGY 
SO UM OBVIOUSLY 
I PERSONALLY HAVE TO SAY THAT DYNAMO IS OUT OF THE QUESTION REALLY 
YOU DON'T WANNA WIND UP YOUR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE YOU CAN USE IT RIGHT 
UM SOLAR CELL IS INTERESTING 
MAY FAIL THOUGH EVERY HOUR AND THERE 
MM 
YEAH 
OR YOU KNOW YOU LOSE IT IT LIES BEHIND THE COUCH FOR A WEEK AND YEAH MM 
ALWAYS THE EYE 
BUT EXACTLY 
UM THE KINETIC ENERGY THING UM MIGHT WORK UM BUT THE SAME PROBLEM 
YOU LEAVE IT LYING AROUND AND YOU FIRST HAVE TO SHAKE IT BEFORE IT IT STARTS TO WORK 
SO I'D SAY WHAT WE'RE STUCK WITH REALLY IS UM THE BASIC BATTERY 
WHICH ALSO MAKES A BASE STATION BASICALLY OBSOLETE 
WE DON'T NEED THAT THEN 
UM 
HOWEVER 
OR INTERFACE OPTIONS ARE PUSH BUTTONS 
IN WHICH UH IN THE PRODUCTION OF WHICH ARE IN MANUFACTURE OF WHICH UM OUR COMPANY IS EXPERT 
UM 
HOWEVER WE'VE DISCUSSED THAT SCROLL WHEELS ARE A BETTER OPTION 
AND THEY ARE POSSIBLE 
WE HAVE AN OKAY FOR SCROLL WHEELS 
OKAY 
UM HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO THE SCROLL WHEEL OF THE IPOD 
I'VE ONE BIG OBJECTION AND THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO FIT AN L. C. D. INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL AS WELL 
THIS HOWEVER MAY EXCLUDE CERTAIN UM MATERIALS 
IF YOU HAVE A SQUISHY UH KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL THEN AN L. C. D. SCREEN MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE MOVEMENT 
HENCE WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT IN THERE 
SO UM 
THERE'S ALSO RESTRICTIONS TO WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHIP 
IF WE HAVE A MORE SOPHISTIC UH SOPHISTICATED SCROLL WHEEL RATHER THAN THIS VERY BASIC UH SET UP THAT WE THAT I'VE JUST PRESENTED 
UM THE CHIP HAS TO BE MORE IS MORE SOPHISTICATED AND THIS MORE EXPENSIVE AS WELL 
I DON'T HAVE ANY DETAILS TO WHEN IT COMES TO THE COST BUT UM IT WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE 
I'D RATHER SAY DROP THE TITANIUM AND THEREFORE LET'S HAVE A MORE SOPHISTICATED CHIP BUT THAT'S NOT UP TO ME TO DECIDE REALLY 
SO THAT'S FOR THE FOR THE SCROLL WHEEL 
UM IT LIMITS OUR CHOICE AND SQUISHY IS HIP SO I'D SAY 
RATHER NOT GO FOR FOR THAT 
LET'S SEE NOW 
UM UM SOLAR CELLS CANNOT BE USED IN A CURVED OR LATEX UM SURFACE OR UM REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM UM SINCE WE HAVE DECIDED OUR AGAINST SOLAR CELLS I ASSUME RIGHT 
OR IS ANYBODY STILL ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
UH WHICH MAKES IT VERY CONVENTIONAL BUT THEREFORE TRADITIONAL I ASSUME 
UM 
UM 
WITH THE TITANIUM UM WE CANNOT MAKE IT A CURVED DESIGN 
WE WOULD JUST BE ABLE TO MAKE IT FLAT AND 
AND UM YEAH A STRAIGHT DESIGN PRETTY MUCH 
WHICH I ASSUME WOULD EXCLUDE UH SOME OF THE MORE SOPHISTICATED VERSIONS 
YOU CAN HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
UM BUT THEREFORE IN RUBBER WILL BE USED 
ALRIGHT 
SO PLASTIC YES TITANIUM YES BUT THIS WILL OF COURSE INFLUENCE THE FORM 
WITH PLASTIC AS I UNDERSTAND IT YOU CAN SEE ANY FORM 
UM LATEX 
SO TRICKY 
OR RUBBER AND UM 
AND TITANIUM ALSO SEEMS TO BE TRICKY WHEN IT COMES TO THE FORM 
SO THE WAY TO GO SO IF YOU WANT A SCROLL WHEEL YOU EITHER MAKE IT FLAT AND ANGULAR UH ADD AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND UM 
THEN YOU CAN BASICALLY CHOOSE EITHER PLASTIC OR TITANIUM 
OR WOOD EVEN 
UM IF YOU WANNA MAKE IT A PARTICULAR SHAPE IS PLASTIC 
ADD AN L. C. D. SCREEN ADD A SCROLL WHEEL THAT'LL BE FINE 
OR MAKE IT JUST PUSH BUTTONS 
BASICALLY PLASTIC GIVES YOU THE B BIGGEST VARIETY OF OF OPTIONS 
MAYBE NOT THE NICEST FEEL 
OR NOT MUCH ORIGINALITY REALLY 
WITH RUBBER WE COULD UH SH PRETTY MUCH SHAPE AT THE WAY WE WANTED TO BUT WE CANNOT ADD SCROLL WHEELS AND WE CANNOT ADD AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
THAT'S THE TRICKY THING 
SO CERTAINLY CAN BE DONE YES 
UM YEAH 
IF THAT DOESN'T AFFECT THE FUNCTIONAL SIDE OF IT ALL 
LIKE SAY JUST THE UNDERSIDE OR SO THEN IT CAN BE DONE 
I ASSUME 
YEAH 
SO 
THE FRUIT DESIGN UM 
HOW ABOUT UM AFFECTING THE SURFACE OF THE ACTUAL UM REMOTE CONTROL 
SAY WE DON'T MAKE IT UP A PARTICULAR FRUIT SHAPE OBVIOUSLY BUT UH GIVE IT LIKE THE SURFACE OF 
AN ORANGE BANANA WHATEVER 
YOU NAME IT 
JUST DESIGN WISE 
MM 
NICE ONE 
WELL WE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO STICK TO THE COMPANY COLOURS THOUGH THAT'S YELLOW AND GREY 
SO WHAT HAVE WE LEMON BANANA IS 
GRAPEFRUIT IS WHAT WE'D GO FOR WHEN IT COMES TO THE OUTER APPEARANCE PERHAPS 
BUT MM 
WELL WE HAVE TO BANANA SHAPED ALREADY KIND OF 
SO 
RIGHT 
I IT'S YELLOW 
WELL SO WHY NOT ADD A COUPLE OF GREY STRIPES AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A BANANA 
THERE YOU GO 
IT COULD BE ONE UP 
YEAH 
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT 
I INFORMED YOU ABOUT THE MATERIALS WHAT THE INTERIOR HAS TO LOOK LOOK AND WHAT THE LIMITATIONS TO CERTAIN MATERIALS ARE IN THERE YOU GO 
SURE 
HANG ON 
THERE YOU GO 
WELL WE CAN STILL DESIGN A TWO PIECE UH REMOTE UM WITHOUT HAVING A BASE HAVING ONE OF THEM BE A BASE STATION 
BUT JUST HAVE TO BE AN OPTIONAL EITHER BIG REMOTE WITH LOTS OF FUNCTIONS ARE YOU TAKE OUT THE SMALLER PIECE 
WE CAN STILL DO THAT 
HOWEVER OF COURSE THIS WOULD BE LIKE DESIGNING TWO REMOTES PRETTY MUCH 
SO UM WHICH THEN AS I UNDERSTAND IT WOULD PROBABLY LIMIT THE 
LIMIT AGAIN THE THE THE EASE OF CERTAIN MATERIALS BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE 
SAY LIKE HAVE A SCROLL WHEEL AND UH ON BOTH OF THEM OR HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND SO ONE IS NO 
YOU'D PROBABLY HAVE TO STICK RATHER WITH A JUST TRADITIONAL RUBBER BUTTON 
DESIGN WHICH WE SAW THERE 
BUT COULD BE DONE OF COURSE 
RIGHT 
OKAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHIP ON PRINT AS I SAID THE THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES YOU WANT 
UM THE FANCIER THE CHIP HAS TO BE AND THE MORE EXPENSIVE 
UH IF YOU WANT JUST A NORMAL BUTTON VERSION THE CHIP ON PRINT IS GONNA BE 
A CHIP ON 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
AS LONG AS THE PLA UH THE RUBBER IS NOWHERE NEAR THE CONTROLS YES 
UM MORE OF A L LAMINATION PERHAPS 
YES 
IT DOES 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE 
KIND OF A BANANA 
I D 
OKAY 
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HELP ME DO AN EVALUATION OF THE CRITERIA 
UM 
OKAY 
SO FIRST I'LL JUST DISCUSS SOME OF THE CRITERIA THAT I FOUND 
JUST BASED ON THE PAST TREND REPORTS THAT I WAS LOOKING AT EARLIER 
AND THEN WE'LL DO A GROUP EVALUATION OF THE PROTOTYPE 
AND THEN WE WILL CALCULATE THE AVERAGE SCORE TO SEE HOW WE DID 
UM SO THE CRITERIA WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT ARE THE COMPLAINTS UM THAT WE HEARD FROM THE USERS WHO WERE INTERVIEWED EARLIER 
SO 
WE'RE GONNA BE DOING IT BASED ON A SEVEN POINT SCALE 
AND ONE IS GOING TO MEAN TRUE THAT WE DID ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT 
WITH SEVEN BEING FALSE WE DID NOT ACHIEVE THAT 
OKAY 
SO FOR THE FIRST ONE WE NEED TO DECIDE DID WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF THE USERS WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT AN UGLY REMOTE 
MM 
MM 
YEAH I THINK THE COLOURS DETRACT A LITTLE BIT 
THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
UM OKAY SO DO YOU THINK SINCE WE 
THIS WAS A A SIGN CRITERIA DO YOU THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT IT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE THEN 
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THERE 
FOUR 
FIVE 
FAR AS FAR 
OKAY 
OKAY THE SECOND ONE 
DID WE MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR NEW USERS 
NO 'KAY 
OKAY 
UM DO THE CONTROLS NOW MATCH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USERS 
I'D SAY THAT 
SO NO 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY UM THE FOURTH ONE 
HOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF A REMOTE BEING EASILY LOST 
ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINTS 
WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE IT 
OKAY 
THAT'S TRUE 
MM 
ANNOYING ALARM OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
SO 
ARE WE ADDING ONE OF THIS 
TWO FEATURES 
GONNA SAY OKAY 
SO WE'RE BACK TO A ONE 
OR A TWO 
TWO 'KAY 
OKAY 
ARE WE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
FROM IPOD YEAH 
BUT FOR REMOTES YEAH 
TWO 
THERE 
BUT HOW MANY REMOTES DO YOU SEE LIKE THIS 
NOT SO MANY 
REALLY 
OKAY 
THAT'S GONNA HURT US 
OKAY 
UM SPONGY MATERIAL 
'KAY 
AND LASTLY DID WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
I'D SAY WE DID 
'KAY 
ALRIGHT 
NOW WE JUST GOTTA CALCULATE 
SIX EIGHT TWELVE SIXTEEN 
SEVENTEEN DIVIDED BY S 
WELL I HAVEN'T DONE MATH IN YOURS 
WHAT TWO I DUNNO 
OKAY WE'LL SAY TWO POINT FOUR TWO 
RIGHT 
HOW DOES THAT LIKE 
IT'S BEEN A WHILE 
OH NO 
THEY JUST TOLD ME TOO 
PICK MY OWN CRITERIA AND HAVE YOU GUYS EVALUATE IT BASICALLY 
SO THAT'S THAT 
OH MY GOD 
OKAY 
YEAH WE'LL GO WITH THAT 
NOT TOO SHABBY 
RIGHT 
OH 
BRIGHT YELLOW 
IT'D LOOK REALLY LOVELY 
YEAH 
LEAVE IT BLANK 
PERFECT 
WHAT'S THE BLUE PART 
OH THAT'S THE BATTERIES 
OKAY 
LOOKS MORE LIKE A BANANA 
TRYING TO FILL IN SOME TIME THERE 
GOOD TEAMWORK 
MINUS YOUR POWERPOINT FIASCO 
NO I KNOW 
I'M YEAH 
INCOM 
MM 
KINDA 
WE MIGHT HAVE A WHEEL THOUGH 
YEP 
SOON AS I 
GET THIS 
OKAY 
THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING 
UM I'LL GO AHEAD AND GO THROUGH THE MINUTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
UH AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION 
UM THEN WE WILL UM DO AN EVALUATION 
UH OR WE'LL SEE WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE UNDER THE CRITERIA FOR THE EVALUATION 
THEN WE'LL GO THROUGH THE FINANCE AND SO IF WE FALL WITHIN THE BUDGET 
UM THEN WE'LL DO THE EVALUATION AND THEN WE CAN FINISH UP AFTER THAT WITH UM ANY CHANGES THAT WE'LL NEED TO MAKE 
OR HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WILL FALL RIGHT ON LINE 
UM LET'S SEE MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING 
UM WE LOOKED AT UH THE THE TRENDS 
WE HAD UH THE FASHION TRENDS THAT PEOPLE WANT A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
IT WAS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS ANYTHING ELSE 
UM THEY LIKED FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IN THE NEW STYLES 
UM AND A SPONGY FEEL 
SO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO INCORPORATE THIS INTO OUR PROTOTYPE 
UM THEY WANTED LIMITED BUTTONS AND SIMPLICITY 
UM THEN WE LOOKED AT THE UH THE METHOD FOR COMING UP WITH OUR OWN REMOTE 
UM LOOKING AT OTHER OTHER DEVICES 
UM THE IPOD WE REALLY LIKED THE LOOK OF THAT 
UM WE ALSO HAD UH THE KID'S REMOTE FOR A SIMPLE IDEA 
UM A TWO PART REMOTE WHICH WAS WHAT WERE WERE ORIGINALLY LOOKING AT 
UH AND THEN UM THERE WAS TALK OF SPEE UH SPEECH RECOGNITION UM BECOMING MORE UH PREDOMINANT AND EASIER TO USE 
BUT I THINK WE'VE STILL DECIDED NOT TO GO WITH THAT 
THEN WE LOOKED AT THE COMPONENTS UM 
THE MATERIALS FOR THE CASE THE DIFFERENT ENERGY SOURCES THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHIPS 
UM AND MADE A DECISION ON WHAT WE WERE GOING TO USE TO MAKE OUR REMOTE 
UM AND BASICALLY 
HOW WHAT WERE MAKING FOR THE PROTOTYPE 
SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT TO THAT AND LET YOU GUYS TAKE OVER 
THE PROTOTYPE YEAH 
DO YOU NEED A THIS 
OKAY 
VERY NICE 
MM-HMM 
WHAT ABOUT WHAT'S THAT BUTTON 
AH 'KAY 
'KAY 
WOULD YOU LOOK AT UH 
WELL DONE 
WELL LUCKILY WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT 
OR NOT LUCKILY 
UM DO YOU HAVE A MARKETING PRESENTATION FOR US 
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE 
SO IF THEY THINK THAT WHAT IS IT THERE IS UGLY THEN YES I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY MOST DEFINITELY 
IT'S BRIGHT 
IT STILL HAS YOUR TRADITIONAL BLACK 
YEP NOT ANGULAR 
MM 
YEP 
YEAH SOMETHING MORE MODERN TO GO A A MODERN COLOUR TO GO WITH THE MODERN FORM 
YEAH 
I WOULD SAY 
FOUR 
VERY NON COMMITTAL FOUR 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO SCROLLING THROUGH AND SELECTING A FEW 
I THINK THAT'S A ONE 
SO IF WE INCORPORATE SPEECH RECOGNITION INTO IT THEN IT COULD 
AND IT IS QUITE BRIGHT AND 
OH 
YEAH 
BUT IF WE DO GO WITH THE WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN IT THEN RE SCALE GOES UP QUITE A BIT I THINK 
PROBABLY TWO 
YOU KNOW 
IF WE ELIMINATE THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE THAT IT'S NOT GONNA BE LOST THEN 
I'D SAY TWO 
WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION WHICH OF COURSE MAY 
BE CHANGED DEPENDING ON BUDGET 
WHICH WHICH MAY BE CHEAPER THAN SPEECH RECOGNITION IF IT WERE JUST A 
SOME SORT OF PROXIMITY 
PRAY THAT YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALLY LOSE THAT PIECE 
OKAY 
TWO 
IT'S 
BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF YELLOW THERE'S NOT A LOTTA YELLOW 
COURSE THAT WASN'T REALLY WE WERE KINDA FORCED TO TAKE THAT COLOUR 
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ARE THAT INNOVATIVE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH 
IF WE ADDED THE SCREAMING FACTOR THEN WE GO UP 
UM I WOULD SAY WE'RE PROBABLY IT FOR 
WE HAVE SOME SPONGY YEAH 
NO 
YEAH 
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY GOT WHAT THESE PARTS ARE THE GROUPS AND PERHAPS THE BACK SIDE THE BOTTOM THE UNDERNEATH ON THE BACK 
PROBABLY A FOR IT MUST 
POSSIBLY EVEN A FIVE 
IF YOUR FASHION IS B IS CARMEN MIRANDA YOU BETCHA 
IT'S TRUE 
SEVEN IS 
TWO POINT 
TWO POINT FOUR 
SOMETHING 
AND WHAT WHAT IS THE ACCEPTABLE CRITERIA 
SO THERE LIKE A SCALE THAT WE HAVE TO HIT 
ALRIGHT THEN 
OKAY 
WELL LET'S SEE 
NOW WE GET TO DO THE BUDGET NUMBERS 
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE GONNA HAVE A BUDGET 
BUT WE DO 
OKAY 
SO I HAVE HERE ONE 
YEAH 
WE WANT A FIFTY PERCENT PROFIT ON THIS 
UH YOU CAN'T REALLY IS THAT VERY WELL 
TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS IS WHAT SUPPOSED TO COST US 
OKAY SO 
WELL LET'S SEE 
THE OF THE 
WONDER IF I CAN MAKE THIS 
WHAT THE 
UH IT WON'T LET ME DO THAT 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT SO AT TOP I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS CAN READ THAT ARE NOT 
I CAN'T 'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE MY GLASSES ON BUT SO WE'VE GOT THE ENERGY SOURCE 
THERE'S UH FOUR FIVE SIX CATEGORIES 
WE HAVE ENERGY SOURCE ELECTRONICS CASE 
THEN WE HAVE CASE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENTS INTERFACE TYPE AND THEN BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS 
OKAY SO 
UH FIRST OF ALL ENERGY SOURCE WE PICKED BATTERY 
UM AND HOW MANY BATTERIES DO WE THINK THIS WILL PROBABLY TAKE 
PROBABLY 
SOME E EITHER TWO OR FOUR 
TWO 
LIKE IT 
EXCELLENT 
THIS IS CONSUMERISM 
ALRIGHT SO FOR THE ELECTRONICS OUR CHOICES ARE SIMPL SIMPLE CHIP ON PRINT REGULAR CHIP ON PRINT ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER 
'KAY WE HAVE ONE OF THIS 
'KAY THEN THE CASE IS A 
PROBABLY IT'S DOUBLE CURVED 
CASE MATERIALS ARE PLASTIC 
UM I GUESS IT'S TWO SINCE ONE FOR THE TOP ONE FOR THE BOTTOM 
SO THAT RIGHT OR IS IT JUST ONE 
MAYBE IT'S ONE BECAUSE OF THE 
'KAY 
I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER 'CAUSE THE PRICE ON THAT ONE IS ZERO WHICH IS NICE 
SPECIAL COLOUR 
INTERFACE TYPE 
WE HAVE PUSHBUTTON SCROLL WHEEL INTERFACE INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSHBUTTON AND AN L. C. D. DISPLAY 
SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY 
AND THEN IS TO THE INTEGRATED OR IS IT 
YEAH 
'KAY 
BUTTON SUPPLEMENT 
SPECIAL COLOUR 
UM SPECIAL FORM 
SPECIAL MATERIAL 
OR TITANIUM 
THEY COST US ALL THE SAME 
WELL WE ONLY HAVE ONE BUTTON IS REALLY WE SHOULDN'T BE CHARGED WE SHOULDN'T BE CHARGED ANYTHING FOR THE THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS 
UM 
OKAY 
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THAT ONE BLANK BECAUSE WE RUN ON A L. C. D. AND SCROLL 
SO OUR TOTAL IS FIFTEEN POINT FIVE 
WHICH I BELIEVE SO 
BY THREE EUROS OVER 
SO THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN UM A BANANA SHAPED REMOTE IS IN THAT YOU SHAKE 
YEAH 'CAUSE THE 
WELL 'CAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE BOTH RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
SO WE MAY NOT AND THE L. C. D. DISPLAY 
WELL THERE WE GO 
TWELVE POINT FIVE 
OKAY 
SO WE JUST REMOVE OR 
SCREEN HERE 
BESIDES LOOK AT WHAT THE L. C. D. DOES IT OR LOVELY REMOTE 
BACK TO THE DESIGN ROOM BOYS 
OKAY SO THE COSTS UNDER TWELVE POINT FIVE EURO 
WAS NO 
WE REDESIGNED IT 
NOW IT'S YES 
NEXT SLIDE 
PROJECT EVALUATION 
UH PROJECT PROCESS SATISFACTION WITH FOR EXAMPLE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY LEADERSHIP TEAMWORK MEANS NEW IDEAS FOUND 
UM 
SO 
I GUESS THAT 
LET'S SEE HERE 
I THINK THAT PERHAPS THE PROJECT EVALUATION'S JUST SUPPOSED TO BE COMPLETED BY UM 
BUT 
I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS 
UH UH WHAT DID YOU THINK OF OUR PROJECT PROCESS 
GOOD 
YEAH I THINK 
WE ST WE STARTED OFF A LITTLE LITTLE WEAK 
OR LEADERSHIP WAS QUITE WEAK IN THE BEGINNING 
UM UM 
BUT IS THE DAY WENT ALONG WE HAD MORE IDEA OF WHAT WE WERE DOING 
UM ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 
THERE WAS THAT 
UM I 
THINK WE TRIED A LOTTA DIFFERENT THINGS AND UM 
I THINK IT WAS IM INTERESTING AS YOU GUYS BROUGHT UP MORE UM INFORMATION AND STUDIES THAT WE WERE RIGHT ONE WITH A LOT OF THESE THINGS 
UM YOU GUYS WORKED TOGETHER WELL AS A TIME 
AND UM THE MENUS 
WHICH WAS THE WHITEBOARD AND THE PENS 
I HAD SOME PROBLEM WITH THE PEN I THINK ABOUT MINUS YOUR P 
WELL 
HAVE A WE HAVE A LIST OF EMPLOYEES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE FIRED 
OKAY 
NO NEW IDEAS FOUND 
UM 
YES FOR THE REMOTE 
MAYBE N NOT F FOR 
TECHNOLOGY 
ALRIGHT 
CLOSING 
COSTS ARE WITHIN THE BUDGET 
PROJECT IS EVALUATED 
UM COMPLETE THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY 
THAT'S IT 
AND I STILL HAVE TO DO MY MINUTES FOR THE LAST MEETING 
ACTUALLY 
UM SO THERE WILL PROBABLY BE ANOTHER 
QUESTIONNAIRE COMING UP 
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK WITH THE MAIN BOSS WHETHER WE CAN WHAT GOES ON AFTER THAT 
BUT THAT'S THE END OF OUR MEETING 
THE PROTOTYPE DISCUSSION 
NO 
THERE IS OUR REMO THE BANANA 
UM YEAH BASICALLY WE WE ST WENT WITH THE COLOUR YELLOW 
UM WORKING ON THE PRINCIPLE OF A FRUIT WHICH WAS MENTIONED IT'S BASICALLY DESIGNED AROUND A BANANA 
UM BUT IT WOULD BE HELD IN SUCH A FASHION WHERE IT IS OBVIOUSLY IT WOULDN'T BE THAT FLOPPY 'CAUSE THIS WOULD BE HARD PLASTIC 
THIS WOULD BE LIKE THE RUBBER THE RUBBER GRIPS 
SO THAT'S SO THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY HELP WITH GRIP OR LIKE THE ERGONOMICS OF IT 
UM BUT ALL THE CONTROLLING WOULD BE DONE WITH THESE SCROLL WHEEL 
YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION A LITTLE BIT 
AND THIS HERE REPRESENTS THE SCREEN WHERE YOU WHERE YOU'D GO THROUGH 
AND THE THE SIMPLEST FUNCTIONS WOULD BE UM ALMOST IDENTICAL TO AN IPOD WHERE THAT ONE WAY CH THROUGH CHANNELS THAT WAY THE OTHER WAY THROUGH CHANNELS 
VOLUME UP AND DOWN 
AND THEN TO ACCESS THE MORE COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS YOU'D YOU SORTA G YOU PRESS THAT AND GO THROUGH THE MENUS 
IT'S THAT THAT SIMPLE 
THAT JUST REPRESENTS THE INFRARED UH BEAM 
THAT'S A SIMPLE ONE AND OFF SWITCH 
UM I DON'T KNOW WE COULD USE THE VOICE 
IT THAT BLUE BITS SHOULD BE YELLOW DO THAT THAT'D BE WHERE THE BATTERIES WOULD BE I SUPPOSE 
AND UM THAT'S ABOUT IT 
IT'S SO SIMPLE AS YOU WE COULD MAKE IT REALLY 
SO THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD 
YEAH 
DOESN'T MAKE MUCH MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE 
YOU COULD WORK LEFT HANDED OR RIGHT HANDED I SUPPOSE 
AT THE ACTUAL THING MIGHT BE SMALLER 
YEAH 
JUST THE ONE AND OFF 
YEAH 
IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S FLIMSY 'CAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF HEAVY PLAY DOH BUT 
AND WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD FALL INTO THE COST EVERYTHING I SUPPOSE 
WITH THE SCROLL AND THE L. C. D. 
YEAH 
I WOULD 
IT'S BRIGHT 
IT'S 
IT'S CURVED 
IT'S NOT THERE'S NO SHARP 
ANGLES TO IT 
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT WAS THE MAIN UM ONE OF THE MAIN AIMS THAT WE HAD 
OH YEAH 
'CAUSE WE'VE WE'VE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO BASICALLY FOUR CONTROLS MOST COMMON WHICH ARE CHANNEL AND VOLUME 
AND THEN THE OTHER ONES ARE JUST A MATTER OF JUST GOING JUST SCROLLING FURTHER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S BRIGHT YELLOW 
BRIGHT YELLOW'S HARD TO LOSE 
BUT UM IF WE WERE T IF WE WERE THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
THAT WE COULD MAYBE JUST SO THAT SOLELY FOR THE THE FINDING THING 
THAT WAS WHAT WE'D WE'D MENTIONED 
JUST JUST TO USE TO FIND OUT WHEN IT WAS LOST 
BUT LIKE I SAID LIKE I DON'T THINK YOU'D ALSO SOMETHING IS YELLOW SO EASILY 
AND IT'S NOT GONNA FALL LIKE A RECTANGLE WOULD SLIP DOWN BEHIND THINGS 
THAT'S GONNA BE A DIFFICULT SHAPE IT 
YEAH 
MAYBE IN THE MIDDLE AGAIN THREE OR FOUR OR SOMETHING 
I MEAN YOU KNOW LOO LOSING THINGS AS ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN ALSO I MEAN A MILLION WAYS 
YOU CAN PICK IT UP AND WALK AWAY WITH IT AND THEN YOU'VE LOST IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH TRUE 
BUT I MEAN DO JUST THOSE WHISTLING CLAPPING KEY RINGS YOU HAVE 
THEY'RE CHEAP 
SO IT CAN'T BE THAT 
EXPENSIVE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
STICK IT IN THE T. V. 
YEAH 
TWO 
I'D SAY SO 
UH DON'T GET MANY MO REMOTE CONTROLS WITH 
SCREENS ON 
YEAH IT'S STOLEN TECHNOLOGY 
BUT WE HAVE 
IF 
'CAUSE IT'S STOLEN 
NO MAYBE NOT 
YEAH SO MUCH AS AS NEEDED I THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IN THE 
YEAH 
BU WHAT WE WERE TOLD AND THEY'D SAY YEAH DEFINITELY 
SO THAT SOME LONG DIVISION 
JUST I'M SURE THERE'S A 
NO I CAN'T DO LONG VERY IMPRESSIVE 
YEAH SO 
YOU'D BEEN GOING A LONG TIME DIVIDING THAT 
IT'S TWO POINT FOUR TWO EIGHT FIVE IS IT JUST KEEPS GOING ON 
TWO POINT FOUR TWO BASICALLY 
CHARGE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED QUID FOR IT 
WE'RE ADVANCED CHIP OR WE 
YEAH YEAH 
SO 
THAT'S 
YEAH 
AND THEN 
I'D SAY THE INTEGRATED 
MM 
REMOTE CONTROL 
NO THAT'S GETTING A BIT 
TINY 
YEAH 
I'D IGNORE THAT 
IF IT W 
WHAT IF WE COMPLETELY TOOK OUT THE THE ONE SINGLE BUTTON WE'VE GOT NO 
AND JUST HAD A SCROLL WHEEL INTERFACE 
AND THE L. C. D. DISPLAY 
I SUPPOSE THE L. C. D. C. DISPLAY'S THE ONE THAT'S PUSHING IT UP A BIT THOUGH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU COULD MAYBE TAKE OUT THE L. C. D. DIS DISPLAY EVEN IF IT IF IT COMES UP ON THE COMPUTER ITSEL ON THE T. V. ITSELF 
UH THAT IS POSSIBLE YEAH 
THERE WE GO 
SCREEN 
MAKE IT A BIGGER DIAL 
EASIER TO USE 
EVEN EASIER TO USE THEN 
THAT WAS JUST WE RAN OUT OF YELLOW 
THERE YOU GO 
EVEN SIMPLER 
YEAH 
FOR ALL THOSE FRUIT LOVERS OUT THERE 
YEAH 
I THINK WE DID YEAH I THINK WE DID QUITE WELL 
UM 
YEAH 
RIGHT FROM THE START OF THE DAY 
WE SORT OF KNEW WHERE WE WERE GOING STRAIGHT AWAY I THOUGHT 
YEAH 
WE'VE USED THE WHITEBOARD 
TECHNOLOGY USED 
EXCELLENT 
CAN TRY TO PLUG THAT IN THERE BUT 
RIGHT 
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THREE 
THAT'S PLASTIC 
PLASTIC COVERED WITH RUBBER 
WE MIGHT 
UH DID SOME MORE UNDERNEATH HERE 
MAYBE GIVE IT GIVE IT A FORM 
I MEAN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HOLD IT LIKE THAT BUT UM JUST IF YOU GRAB IT 
TAKE IT FROM SOMEWHERE SO YEAH YOU HAVE SOME RUB YEAH 
EXACTLY USE BOTH 
MIGHT AS WELL THINK ABOUT 
TH THINK ABOUT THE BUTTON AS WELL 
LIKE EITHER PUT THEIR NO NO NO OTHER SIDE OR 
NOT DO IT AT ALL 
IT'S A QUICK ON OFF BUTTON 
THAT'S ME 
YEAH I THINK IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT 
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIDDLE WITH THAT 
RIGHT 
UM THAT'S NOT UM I'D SAY A BIT SMALLER WOULD PROBABLY BE NICE 
YOU WANNA PLAY WITH THAT OVER THERE 
THERE YOU GO 
RIGHT 
I'D SAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE ERGONOMICS THE FORM AND STUFF YES THAT'S DEFINITELY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN YOUR AVERAGE 
HOWEVER THE COLOUR WE DON'T HAVE A SAY IN THAT 
THAT HAS BEEN THAT HAS BEEN DICTATED PRETTY MUCH BY THE COMPANY 
SO UH TO ANSWER THAT HONESTLY I WOULD RATHER SAY LIKE UH 
WE HAVE NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEM COMPLETELY WITH THE UGLY REMOTE BECAUSE THE COLOUR IS UGLY DEFINITELY 
'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT THAT 
I MEAN I MUCH PREFER SOMETHING LIKE BRUSHED CHROME WITH THAT FORM 
BUT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
IT'S DIFFERENT 
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR UH 
THREE FEET HUGE L. C. D. DIS DISPLAY ON YOUR LIVING ROOM THAT'S HANGING FROM THE WALL TO BE CONTROLLED WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S VERY INTUITIVE I THINK YEAH 
SO GIVE IT A ONE 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
SO THAT'S A ONE 
SOMETHING THAT BIG AND THAT YELLOW YOU JUST DON'T LOSE ANYMORE 
OOPS 
WELL WHAT 
SO 
MM 
OH YEAH 
YOU PROBABLY 
MM 
YOU YOU COULD ADD AN EXTRA FEATURE ACTUALLY 
WHICH MAKES THIS THING 
RAISE HELL WHEN YOU REMOVE IT TOO FAR FROM THE TELEVISION 
WE COULD ADD THAT BUT THAT'S NOTHING WE HAVE THOUGHT OF AS FAR 
YES 
IT'S IT'S 
UM THE IT'S BASED ON THIS ANTI ANTI THEFT TECHNOLOGY FOR SUITCASES AND STUFF WHERE YOU HAVE ONE PIECE THAT'S ATTACHED TO YOUR LUGGAGE ANOTHER PIECE THAT STARTS BEEPING 
THAT CAN'T COST MUCH 
SO THAT CAN ALSO EASILY BE INTEGRATED BECAUSE THESE THINGS ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO TO HEAD 
SO YOU HAVE ONE PIECE YOU HAVE TO GLUE SOMEWHERE BEHIND YOUR STICK TO BEHIND YOUR T. V. AND THE OTHER 
RIGHT 
THAT'D BE TOUGH THEN 
WELL ALSO YOUR REMOTE WOULD UH ALARM YOU IF SOMEBODY STOLE YOU TO YOUR TELEVISION YEAH 
RUN OFF WITH IT WITHOUT TAKING THE BEAUTIFUL REMOTE CONTROL 
LET'S ADD ONE OF THESE FEATURES AND SAY YES 
TWO 
OH 
IT'S ALL JUST 
IT'S ALL JUST STOLEN TECHNOLOGY WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT 
YEAH NOT REALLY 
RIGHT 
YEAH WELL YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF SORT OF 
IT'S NOT A ONE THOUGH 
ONE WOULD BE THE WHOLE THING 
TO FOLD AND STUFF 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S A FOR IT MUST 
Y YES 
MORE 
WELL THE RECENT FASHION IS RATHER DISPLAYED ON THE ON THE L. C. D. AND THE WAY YOU OPERATE IT THEN THE FORM AND THE COLOUR BUT IT DEFINITELY IS 
I'M IMPRESSED 
I CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT A CALCULATOR 
FIFTY PERCENT YOU'RE KIDDING 
UP 
IT'S TOO MUCH 
UM 
OH 
BATTERY 
TWO 
IT FOR IT'S GONNA BE TOO HEAVY SO THAT THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM 
PEOPLE CAN CHANGE IT EVERY MONTH 
THEY WON'T KNOW UNTIL AFTER THEY BOUGHT IT 
THAT'S THE ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT YEAH 
DOUBLE CURVED YES 
PLASTIC 
NO NO 
NO THAT'S JUST ONE 
IT'S JUST ONE UM SINGLE MOULD WE CAN DO THAT 
EXACTLY RIGHT 
THAT'S NOT A SPECIAL COLOUR 
IT'S A SPECIALLY UGLY COLOUR BUT IT'S NOT SPECIAL 
SO 
YES UNFORTUNATELY 
WE COULD OF COURSE MAKE THE BUTTONS WOOD 
SAY MAHOGANY OR SO 
MM-HMM OR TITANIUM 
UH JUST 
YEAH THAT'S TOO MUCH 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE 
SO WE'LL GO FOR THE HAND DYNAMO HUH 
I MEAN LET'S LET'S FACE IT IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE SOFTWARE ON THE ON THE TELEVISION 
YOU CAN HAVE THE THE INFORMATION THAT THIS THING TRANSMITS BE BEING DISPLAYED ON THE ON THE SCREEN 
SO SO YEAH LET'S TAKE AWAY THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
WE MAY NOT NEED TO 
THERE YOU GO 
PERFECT 
OKAY THE 
SO WE CAN JUST 
TAKE AWAY A HECK OF A LOT OF THE OTHER YOU GO 
CONTROL 
OH THAT'S JUST YEAH 
THERE YOU GO 
OOPS 
THERE YOU GO 
NO MORE CRITERIA 
FAIR ENOUGH 
GREAT 
YEAH 
JUST HALF A DAY YOU HAVE A REMOTE 
THERE YOU GO 
SUPER SUPER 
WELL THAT'S NOT MY FAULT 
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE I WORK FOR UH THAT WORK FOR UM UH THEY'VE JUST YOU KNOW 
HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL BELIEVE ME 
YES YES 
UH I GUESS I START WITH MY PRESENTATION 
WE HAD TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE WORKING ON THIS 
SO WE'LL SHOW YOU TWO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PRESENTATIONS 
FEEL FREE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OBVIOUSLY 
UM THE FIRST ONE WAS DONE BY MYSELF BRUNO MARIANNE AND NIKOS 
AND THE RATIONALE THAT WE HAVE I'LL SHOW YOU THE LAYOUT IN A SECOND WAS THAT FULL PROFESSORS WOULD GET PRIVATE OFFICES 
ADMINISTRATION IS CLOSE TO THE PROFESSORS OFFICES SO IT'S EASIER FOR THE SECRETARY TO SPEAK TO EVERYONE 
THE FAX IS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE SINCE IT'S MOSTLY USED BY GISELLA WHO'S THE SECRETARY 
FOR NOISE REDUCTION PURPOSES WE'VE MOVED EVERYONE WHO HAS OFFICE HOURS TOGETHER AND WE'VE ALSO PUT THE NETWORK PRINTER AND THE PHOTOCOPIER IN THE HALL 
UM SO I'LL JUST SHOW YOU HOW THAT WORKS 
BASICALLY YOU CAN SEE GISELLA SORT OF THEIR IN THE MIDDLE WITH THE FAX MACHINE AND MAGGIE AND SUSAN 
WHO ARE THE TWO FULL PROFESSORS IN OUR DEPARTMENT HAVE THE PRIVATE OFFICES 
AND THE PHOTOCOPIER AND THE PRINTER ARE SORT OF IN THE HALL ON THE SIDE THERE ACROSS FROM MAILBOXES 
UM JUST TO GO BACK MOST PEOPLE ARE GROUPED IN PROJECTS 
AND WE HAVE TWO FIFTY PER CENT PEOPLE WHO ARE HALF TIME IN GENEVA HALF TIME TO THE I. P. F. L. IN LAUSANNE 
AND THEY UM THEM WE'VE PUT IN THREE PERSON OFFICES SO THAT IN THE OTHER PERSON OFFICES IT'S NOT CONSTANTLY THREE PEOPLE 
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF GIVE THERE 
AND THE READING ROOM OR THE LONG AS SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THAT WE HAVE AS IN A CENTRAL POSITION 
SO BASICALLY WE'VE GOT ANDRE AND NANCY AT THE TOP 
UM THEY DON'T ACTU THEY WILL BE STARTING A NEW PROJECT TOGETHER OF UM IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN 
LIKE I SAID SUSAN AND MAGGIE IN THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICES 
NIKOS AND YALINA WHO WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT AT THE BOTTOM 
THE READING ROOM IS IN THE MIDDLE 
UM MARIANNE AND BRUNO OR AT THE BOTTOM 
UM AS WELL MARIANNE WORKS CLOSELY WITH PIERRETTE AND THE OTHER MARIANNE 
WE HAVE TWO MARIANNES IN OUR DEPARTMENT 
AND DAVID IS A HALF TIME 
SO SO I SAID THE HALF TIMES OR IN THE OTHER PERSON OFFICES 
AND IN THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE MARIA MARTIN AND MYSELF WHO ALL WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT 
AND MARTIN IS FIFTY PER CENT 
UM GISELLA WE'VE GIVEN HER TWO PERSON OFFICE FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS BECAUSE THERE'S A SPARE PLACE THERE 
SO IF WE WANT TO PUT A STAGIEUR OR SOMEONE WHO JUST COMES IN FOR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME 
WE FIGURED IT WAS OKAY IF THEY WERE IN THE ADMIN OFFICE WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT NOISY BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY THERE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME 
UM AND AGAIN THE PROXIMITY TO THE OTHER OFFICES 
UM SO I GUESS THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR OUR PROPOSAL 
UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ANDRE TO GO THROUGH HIS FIRST OR IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME 
SHE'S IT'S DO YOU WANNA EXPLAIN HOW IT IT WORKS OR 
MARTIN IS FIFTY PER CENT 
PIERRETTE THERE'S TWO SORT OF STATUTES OF PROFESSOR 
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY WHERE THERE'S 
YEAH 
THERE'S A PROFESSEUR D'ECOLE AND THE 
BUT THE IDEA IS MAGGIE AND SUSAN ARE SORT OF THE SENIOR 
UM PROFESSORS ON STAFF SO THEY GET THE THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICES 
UM THE DEPARTMENT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE GROWING BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ONLY WORK PART TIME 
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING P. H. D. S OR MASTER STUDENTS WHO WON'T NECESSARILY BE THERE FOR A LARGER EXTENT OF TIME 
SO FOR EXAMPLE YALINA AND THE FINNISH MARIANNE ARE MASTER STUDENTS FOR RIGHT NOW 
SO WHETHER THEY DECIDE TO STAY AND DO A P. H. D. WE'RE NOT SURE YET 
UM NIKOS IS WORKING UM AS A RESEARCHER 
SO FOR HIM IT'S THE SAME THING 
THERE'S I THINK THE ONLY CONSTANT PEOPLE ARE SUSAN MAGGIE ANDRE 
UM GISELLA PIERRETTE UM AND ALL THE REST ARE THREE P. H. D. STUDENTS OR MASTER STUDENTS 
AND AGAIN MARTIN AND DAVID ARE HALF TIME WITH THE I. P. F. L. IS 
THAT'S PROJECT DEPENDENT AS WELL 
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN AS MUCH SPACE SO WE WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE 
UM SUSAN WANTED A PRIVATE OFFICE SHE HAS A PREFERENCE FOR PRIVATE OFFICES 
OTHER THAN THAT IN IN REALLY HAD ANY TIGHT CONSTRAINTS FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD 
NO ONE'S EXPLICITLY SAID THAT THEY NEEDED TO AVOID ANYONE ELSE 
UM 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
NO THEY WERE FINE WITH IT IS 
AND THEY'RE BOTH NICE VIEWS 
YEAH THEY'RE WINDOWS YEAH 
OR SORRY THE THICK LINES ARE WINDOWS ACTUALLY 
WE HAVE FAIRLY BIG WINDOWS IN THE ROOM YEAH 
SO THERE'S LOTS OF LIGHT COMING IN 
AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR PUTTING THE READING ROOM WHERE IT WAS IS THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF LIGHT COMING IN 
SO IF PEOPLE JUST GO SOMEWHERE TO SORT OF RELAX AND 
HAVE A QUIET PLACE TO SIPS SIT THEY HAVE A LOT OF LIGHT AND 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH WELL I MEAN IT DEPENDS IF YOU LIKE LOOKING AT OVER THE OLD TOWN AND THE CATHEDRAL 
THAT SORT OF GOES BOTH WAYS BUT YEAH WE'VE GOT TWO MOUNTAIN VIEWS 
SORT OF IN THAT SAID THAT SIDE AND THEN THE LAST PART LOOKS ON THE OLD TOWN 
BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE SIXTH FLOOR YOU CAN ACTUALLY IS EVERYTHING 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK BUILDINGS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN WAS IT SIX OR EIGHT FLOORS 
YEAH 
THE PURPLE THING IS THE MAILBOXES 
AND THESE ARE FIXED WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS 
SO 
UM OR 
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
IF WE CAN GET STUFF LIKE THAT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA 
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT LIKE THEM 
AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE PEOPLE THRE SHARING LIKE THREE PEOPLE IN A ROOM WITHOUT ANY PARTITIONS AND 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT NOISY BUT PEOPLE SORT OF GET USED TO IT AND ADMITTEDLY IT'S MOSTLY ASSISTANTS THAT ARE STUCK IN ROOMS LIKE THAT 
SO IT'S JUNIOR PEOPLE BUT 
WELL DO YOU WANT TO DO YOUR PRESENTATION AND 
OKAY 
SO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT REALISTICALLY WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THAT MANY VISITORS COMING IN 
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS AND WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF STAGIEURS BUT THAT'S IT 
NO FOR A PROFESSOR YEAH BUT 
UH IN A WAY OF THAT'S YOUR ARGUMENTATION THEN PUT A VISITING PERSON WITH A SENIOR 
RESEARCHER AT LEAST IF NOT A PROFESSOR RATHER THAN TWO STUDENTS 
IF YOU'RE GONNA ARGUE THAT THE VISITORS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPORTANT AND THEY SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN SPACE 
THEN PUT THEM WITH ANOTHER RESEARCHER RATHER THAN TWO STUDENTS 
FAIRLY REGULARLY THERE'S AT LEAST ONE OR TWO PEOPLE IN THERE 
I MEAN IT'S A YEAH 
IT'S A FAIRLY NEW THING IN THE DEPARTMENT BUT IT'S BEING USED PRETTY REGULARLY OR SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTED 
JUST SORT OF QUIET SPACE OUT OF YOUR OFFICE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE OFFICE FURNITURE 
THE OFFICE CHAIRS IT SORT OF HAS COMFORTABLE SOFAS AND ARMCHAIRS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE YOU CAN JUST GO AND RELAX 
AND OR IF YOU WANNA READ SOMETHING FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME IN A MORE COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT 
AND BECAUSE WE DO A LOT OF READING AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT DOES GET USED FAIRLY OFTEN 
WE SORT OF HAVE AN OPEN POLICY WHERE IF THERE'S NO NO NO THERE AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION THEN THAT'S FINE 
BUT YOU CAN'T DISPLACE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THERE READING JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE A MINI MEETING OR WHATEVER 
YEAH 
YEAH THEY'RE 
YEAH 
WHICH IS SORT OF WHY IN OUR PROPOSAL WE HAD TO COMPLETELY AS A SEPARATE ROOM 
SO IF YOU REALLY WANT PEACE AND QUIET YOU SHUT THE DOOR AND WHEN THE DOORS ARE SHEET 
LIKE UNLESS SOMEONE'S MAKING NOISE RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR IT REALLY IS FAIRLY QUIET 
MM-HMM 
MM 
I MEAN SUPPOSE IF THE END REALLY ARISES AND IT COMES OUT A POINT WHERE WE DO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THEN YOU CAN GET RID OF THE LOUNGE 
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE FURNITURE EITHER DISTRIBUTE IT BETWEEN VARIOUS OFFICES OR PUT IT INTO STORAGE SOMEWHERE 
NO NO NO 
NO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IT STARTED OFF SORT OF US A DISCUSSION AT THE COFFEE TABLE 
WHERE PEOPLE WERE COMPLAINING THAT SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON THEY JUST WANTED SOMEWHERE TO GO OFF AND 
NO HAVE SOME QUIET TIME AND THAT'S WHERE IT CAME FROM 
THERE ARE BOOKSHELVES IN THERE BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A LIBRARY 'CAUSE EVERYONE AT THE MOMENT 
EVERYONE HAS A BOOKSHELF IN THEIR OFFICE AND WE JUST GO ON AND BORROW BOOKS FROM EVERYONE ELSE 
IT'S MORE REALLY ABOUT HAVING A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO SET UM WHERE IT'S NOT AN OFFICE ENVIRONMENT IT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE AN OFFICE 
SO IT'S JUST 
YEAH YEAH AND PEOPLE CAN COME W ONE WITH THEIR STUFF OR LEAVE A NEWSPAPER OR A MAGAZINE LYING AROUND FOR OTHER PEOPLE 
WE'VE GOT A BULLETIN BOARD WHERE YOU CAN PASTE UP ARTICLES THAT YOU THINK OUR BE INTERESTING FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT 
I D 
WELL SHE SHARES AN OFFICE IS WHICH IS WHY WE WERE THINKING THAT IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM TO S KEEP HER WITH A SPARE PERSON 
BECAUSE THAT'S THE W THE SITUATION IT IS RIGHT NOW 
AND IF YOU'RE A STAGIEUR AND YOU'RE COMING AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY EXPECT TO HAVE A FULL BLOWN OFFICE IF YOU ARE ONLY THREE FOUR ABOUT TWO MONTHS 
YEAH 
GISELLA HAS A FIXED SCHEDULE FOR WHEN SHE'S THERE BUT DAVID AND MARTIN ARE SORT OF THEY IF IT FLUCTUATES 
LIKE THEY CAN'T SAY THAT THEY'LL BE THERE MONDAY TUESDAY AND HALF OF WEDNESDAY AND NOT THE REST OF THE TIME WHICH IS PART OF THE PROBLEM 
I MEAN THEY CAN'T S SPECIFY WHEN EXACTLY THEY'LL BE THERE 
SO OUR RATIONALE FOR PUTTING THEM IN A THREE PERSON ROOM IS IS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN THEY'RE THERE AND WHETHER THEY'RE THERE FOR CERTAIN HOURS OR NOT 
IT'S JUST THERE THERE'S TWO OR THREE PEOPLE IN THOSE ROOMS AND SOMETIMES THERE'S LESS SOMETIMES THERE'S MORE BECAUSE WE ALSO DON'T WORK FIXED HOURS 
IT'S NOT LIKE WE WORK YOU KNOW NINE TO FIVE OR WHATEVER 
EVERYONE SORT OF KEEPS THEIR OWN HOURS 
YEAH 
WE HAVE PIERRETTE AND MARIANNE IN THE SAME 
YEAH 
FOR VISITORS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK BECAUSE IT'S A FAIRLY NEW THING IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SAY AT THIS POINT 
I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE LIKE IT NOW THAT IT'S THERE 
THEY SORT OF USE THE VALUE OF IT AND THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO USE IT WIPED OUT ENTIRELY DEFINITELY 
YEAH 
AND THAT'S THE DANGER IS 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
SURE 
EITHER WAY 
OKAY WELL SINCE THIS ONE'S UP KEEP THIS ONE ONE 
EASILY GO AHEAD 
MM-HMM 
DOUBLE ROOMS 
MM 'KAY 
PIERRETTE AND MARTIN 
MM-HMM 
HERE 
IT 
THERE'S TWO MARIANNES ONE IS SWEDISH ONE IS FINNISH 
SO WE JUST CALL THEM THE SWEDISH AND THE FINNISH 
OOPS 
ON BOTH START WITH S. BUT 
UH IT WAS BRUNO RIGHT 
YEAH 
MM 'KAY 
AN HOUR 
OKAY 
WELL FOR UM MARTIN IF YOU DIDN'T MIND WORKING WITH MARTIN WE CAN SWITCH NANCY AND MARTIN HERE 
OOPS 
YEAH 
OH 
WRONG KEYBOARD 
SO WE CAN SAY THAT THIS IS SORT OF FOR BUT THEN AGAIN YOU GET THE MORE FORMAL VISITOR ONE WITH A BUNCH OF STUDENTS IN A CROWDED ROOM 
WELL YOU CAN SAY THAT THIS ONE IS FOR LET'S SAY STAGIEURS OR INTERNS 
UM 
YEAH 
WELL YOU CAN MOVE MAGGIE AND BRUNO 
NOT THIS ROOM 
MOVE GISELLA MOVE THE OTHER SPARE PLACE TO THE BIG ROOM BUT THEN THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THERE 
WE'RE NOT TERRIBLY NOISY I THINK IT'LL BE FINE 
YEAH 
AND I UM IT IN COMMON WITH MORE 
AND WE WORK ON SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SCHEDULES TOO 'CAUSE MARIA AND I TEND TO WORK EARLIER AND NANCY TENDS TO WORK LATER 
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SURE 
UM SO YOU WANT TO DO 
THAT'S GONNA BACK FOR ONE UM 
YEAH 
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU EITHER GET SMALLER DESKS 'CAUSE THE ONES THAT WE HAVE NOW WON'T FIT 
NO 
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE TOO MUCH 
WELL MARIA IS FULL TIME 
SO JUST LIKE THAT 
OKAY 
I DON'T THINK SHE CARES 
ACTU BRUNO DID MENTION THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN A ROOM WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE 'CAUSE HE DID THAT BEFORE AND HE DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT 
SO MAYBE 
I DON'T KNOW I CAN SWITCH WITH HIM AND WE CAN PUT HIM AND NANCY TOGETHER 
I DON'T MIND IT DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME 
OKAY 
YEAH 
WELL THE GENDER BALANCING WE HAVE MORE WOMEN THAN MEN IN OUR DEPARTMENT ANYWAYS SO 
NO 
OKAY 
DO YOU SEE ANY CONSTRAINTS FROM ANY ADMINISTRATIVE SIDES 
GOOD QUESTION 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO BASICALLY WE'RE MOVING INTO A NEW SPACE BUT IT'S 
ONLY MARGINALLY BETTER THAN THE OLD ONE 
MM SURE YEAH WE CAN DO THAT 
MM 'KAY 
SURE 
OKAY 
SO I'LL SAVE THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
THE FINAL COPY 
I'LL CIRCULATE IT TO EVERYONE ALONG WITH THE NUMBERS THAT YOU GUYS WANTED TO USE IN TERMS OF THE SPACE 
OKAY 
GREAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO YOU S SO PIERRETTE IS A PROFESSOR BUT SHE'S ONLY SHE'S ONLY FIFTY PER CENT TIME 
SO THAT WHY SHE'S IN A THREE PERSON OFFICE 
UH-HUH 
I SEE 
MM-HMM 
AND WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT WHAT DO YOU FORESEE HAPPENING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS 
LIKE BEYOND THIS UM B BEYOND THIS CURRENT GROUP OF PEOPLE DO WE DO WE KNOW IF ANY CHANGES COMING 
SO THE DEPARTMENT GROWING 
OR IS IT IS IT GOING TO BE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE 
YEAH 
AND HAVE YOU HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE ANY OF THESE PEOPLE TO ASK THEM IF THEY HAVE ANY 
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS 
OH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IF PEOPLE THEY NEEDED TO BE NEAR OR PEOPLE THEY WOULD NEEDED TO AVOID OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
BUT YOU'VE GIVEN PEOPLE CHANCE TO SAY THAT IF THEY REALLY NEEDED TO 
OKAY GOOD 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IT SAYS MOUNTAINS 
SO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE VIEW 
YEAH 
SO IT'S THE BEST VIEW 
YOU GIVE THE READING ROOM THE BEST VIEW 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UH TWO MOUNTAIN VIEWS 
UH AND THAT'S OLD TOWN 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
NO OKAY 
WHAT'S THAT PURPLE THING THERE 
OH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH UH 
IN THE LOUNGE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO IT'S NOT A PLACE FOR DISCUSSION 
AND IT'S IT'S IT'S A QUIET PLACE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM I SEE 
AND SO I THERE'S ONE OR YOU PLANNING SOME KIND OF PARTITION BETWEEN THE LOUNGE AND THE OFFICES OR OR HOW ARE YOU GONNA KEEP THOSE THINGS I THINK SHOULD ASK THE QUESTION TO YOU 
HOW ARE YOU GONNA KEEP THEM SEPARATE 
'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE 
FAIRLY SEPARATE FUNCTIONS 
BOOK CASES OR SOMETHING OR YEAH 
HMM 
BUT IT WON'T BE UH AN ACOUSTIC SEPARATION 
SO IF IF THE THESE ARE STUDENTS THERE 
SO IF THEY'RE NOISY THAT COULD DISRUPT THE QUIET OF THE LOUNGE 
UM 
BUT 
IS A SEPARATE ROOM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BUT YOU'VE ALSO PUT THE LOUNGE IN A A VERY K KIND OF A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA WHERE THE MAILBOXES ARE THE PRINTER AND THE RESTROOMS 
SO THAT'S ME 
THAT MAY ALSO THE THAT MAY BE GOOD FOR 
MEETING PEOPLE AND BUMPING INTO PEOPLE BUT IT'S MAYBE AGAINST THE IDEA IF IT'S A VERY SUPPOSED TO BE AN ISOLATED QUIET SPOT 
SO I D MM YOU KNOW 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
WELL MAYBE IF IT IF IT HELPS US PACK MORE PEOPLE INTO THE OFFICES BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRIVATE LOUNGE 
MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING 
SAVES US MONEY 
BUT UH 
OH YEAH I GUESS THAT'S LET'S SEE WHAT IS THAT 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
BUT YOU'RE SAYING IT DOES GET USED 
SO YOU'VE IT'S IT'S NOT A COMPLETELY EXPERIMENTAL CONCEPT 
YOUR YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS A LONG AND IT GETS USED A LOT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO CAN YOU JUST SUMMARIZE BRIEFLY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUR TWO PROPOSALS THE KEY DIFFERENCES 
OH SH SHARED 
YEAH THE SHARED LOUNGE THE THE ASSISTANTS WITH THEIR PROFESSORS 
ONE TWO CASES 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
SO THAT'S OKAY 
YEAH 
SO YEAH 
T. V. TO THE LOUNGE THE ADMIN ROOM SEPARATE 
NOT SHARED 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO YOU BASICALLY ACHIEVE THAT BY GIVING LESS SPACE TO THE READING ROOM I THINK 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
SO I GUESS WHAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS HOW IMPORTANT IS THE READING ROOM AT YOUR GROUP REALLY 
SO IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S A VERY VALUED THING THAT HAS TO BE PROTECTED UM 
OR IS IT OKAY TO L MAKE IT BE KIND OF THIS SPARE SPACE THAT GETS USED UP A LITTLE BIT WHEN YOU AND WHEN YOU HAVE SOME EXTRA VISITORS OR THINGS LIKE THAT 
I THINK THAT'S 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT I SUPPOSE ONCE OUT OF IT GETS EATEN AWAY A LITTLE BIT TOO IN SOME POINT IT BECOMES UNUSEFUL AND THEN YEAH 
SO IT 
MM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SWEDISH UM 
UH I SEE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OH 
OKAY 
JUST S. UH IS JUST TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE OKAY 
I'VE HEARD OF THAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PUT FOUR PEOPLE IN THAT OFFICE DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE PLANNING ON FOUR DESKS 
YOU NEED SPACE FOR FOUR DESKS 
YEAH 
DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE 
YEAH 
MM RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
AND SO YOU CAN FIT THAT YOU THINK 
MM-HMM 
MM 
NO 
MM 
YOU MEAN MAYBE YOU SHOULD BREAK THE WALL BETWEEN THE MEN'S ROOM AND THE WOMEN'S ROOM 
SORRY 
NO 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
SO YOUR PERSON TO SQUARE METER RATIO WITHIN THE N UNIVERSITY NORMS 
OVERALL 
WE DON'T WE DON'T I MEAN 
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE COMING IN USING THIS LAVISH READING ROOM AND AND AND EVERYONE HAVING THEIR OWN OFFICE IF THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE HAVING IN THE OTHER PLACES 
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT UM F FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A SPARE READING ROOM LIKE WE WERE SAYING BEFORE 
OVERALL YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS DOESN'T HAVE EXCESSIVE SPACE PER PERSON 
MM-HMM 
MM RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
MM BU 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
WELL 
IT'S GOOD IN CASE I EVER HAVE TO DEFEND IT 
YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD TO HAVE SOME NUMBERS IF YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOME NUMBERS UH 
SOME 
AND MAYBE UH RELATIVE TO SOME OTHER COMPARABLE DEPARTMENTS 
THAT'S IT'S IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THAT 
BUT IF YOU BOTH AGREE WITH THIS PLAN AND YOU THINK YOUR GROUP WILL BE HAPPY THEN UH FINE WITH UM 
I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YEAH 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
WELL THANK YOU 
NO PROBLEM 
THANK YOU 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OH ACTUALLY MARTIN IS FIFTY PER CENT TIME 
YEAH 
NO 
UH BECAUSE YOU WOULD SAY THAT SHE'S AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
BUT UM YEAH MAYBE THAT'S 
YEAH THERE ARE FULL PROFESSORS AND ASSISTANT PROFESSORS IF YOU WANT 
AND YEAH IT'S TRUE THAT SHE'S AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR BUT UH WELL 
WE SO MAYBE WE CAN MOVE A LITTLE BIT AROUND JUST TO GIVE HER UH 
WELL ALSO AT LEAST MAYBE NOT A UH AN OFFICE ALONE BUT AT LEAST WITH JUST ONE PERSON INTO TWO 
WE'LL SEE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH NO MOUNTAINS OR JUST IN THE FOR SO THAT'S NOT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UM WELL UH I CAN THINK OF SOME REACTIONS FROM THE PEOPLE WI SO MAYBE I CAN WELL OR 
YEAH WELL TELL ME ABOUT SOME OF THE CONSTRAINTS AND WELL FIRST OF ALL I MUST SAY THAT THERE ARE ALSO QUITE A LOT OF COMMON POINTS 
SO UM IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO YEAH PLEASE 
THANKS 
PERFECT 
SO UM YEAH ACTUALLY WE UM WELL BASICALLY THE THE GROUP WHO PRODUCED THIS UH PROPOSAL IS MADE BY SUSAN 
MARTIN DAVID AND UH AND MYSELF 
AND WE ALSO WELL SUSAN VOLUNTEERED TO ASK MAGGIE AND PIERRETTE ABOUT HOW THEY THEY FELT ABOUT SHARING OFFICES AND 
SO SO YOU CAN AS WELL UM SUSAN GETS OBVIOUSLY THE SAME OFFICE WHICH IS QUITE A GOOD THING 
UM THEN THINGS STARTED MOVE A BIT 
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M ALSO IN THE SAME POSITION 
BUT THE MOST OBVIOUS CONSTRAINTS THAT UH WE WE FOUND HERE WAS THAT IT WAS PROBABLY VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE A LONG UH JUST A LOUNGE IN ONE ROOM 
BECAUSE IT WOULD BLOCK US TWO FULL WORKING PLACES 
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S TRUE THAT THE GROUP I AGREE DECIDED TO IT HAD TO HAVE A LONG 
WE PROPOSE TO PUT THE LOUNGE UH IN THE ROOM AT THE THE UPPER SIDE ONE ON THE RIGHT 
UH SO LET TWO PEOPLE SHARE THIS WITH UH SORT OF A YEAH A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE A SOFA MAYBE AND UH AND SOME BOOKS 
SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A CALM PLACE 
PEOPLE ARE NOT THERE TO TALK VERY OLD BUT THEY CAN SIT AND RELAX AND UH STILL LOOK AT AT THE MOUNTAINS 
UM ALSO SO THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCES I THINK MAYBE ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 
UH THE OTHER ONE IS THE ADMIN OFFICE 
SO IT'S GISELLA FIFTY PER CENT BECAUSE SHE'S ONLY HALF TIME AND UH THE FAX MACHINE 
UM GISELLA ACTUALLY HAS A LOT OF PHONE CALLS TO MAKE AND UH IT'S TRUE THAT HER ACTIVITY IS QUITE NOISY WHEN SHE'S THERE 
UM IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT SHE HAS QUITE A LOT OF FILES FOR MOST OF THE THE PROJECTS ACTUALLY THAT WE MANAGE 
SO IT APPEARED AT LEAST IT WILL IT OR GROUP 
THAT EVEN IF SHE'S HERE ONLY HALF TIME 
SH SHOULD HAVE AN OFFICE BY HER OWN BECAUSE IT WOULD BE QUITE DISTURBING FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO TO WORK ON THE THE SAME OFFICE 
UH GISELLA HAS HAS NO OBJECTION AGAINST SHARING THE OFFICE 
WE THOUGHT IT WAS MORE FOR THE THE CALM OF THE THE PEOPLE 
IT'S TRUE THAT THIS BLOCKS ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOMS BUT UH IN THE OTHER HAND 
UH MAGGIE HAS NO OBJECTION UH SHARING AN OFFICE WITH HER ASSISTANT 
AND THIS APPEARED TO BE TRUE ALSO OF PIERRETTE 
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT PIERRETTE SHARING AN OFFICE WITH TWO PERSONS BUT AT LEAST ONE PROBLEM IN PIERRETTE SHARING HER OFFICE WITH UH MARIANNE 
THE THE SWEDISH ONE WHO IS SORT OF HER ASSISTANT 
UM SO THIS IS WHY WE YEAH WE PUT MAGGIE WITH WITH BRUNO 
AND THEN THE THIRD MAIN DIFFERENCE UH WOULD BE THE THE NUMBER OF VISITOR PLACES OR FREE PLACES 
UH YOU NOTICE A NEW NAME IN THE REM UH AT THE CENTRE UPPER UPPER SIDE 
SO THAT'S PAOLA 
IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S SOMEONE COMING NEXT YEAR SUSAN REMINDED ME THIS UH OF THIS POINT AND I COULD NOT REALLY IGNORE IT 
UH SO UM THAT SHE'S AN ITALIC SHE WILL ARRIVE IN ABOUT TWO MONTH 
AND THE TWO UH VIS ONE AND VIS TWO OR THE VISITOR PLACES 
YOU HAD NO I THINK CALLED FREE SPACE OR SPARE SPARE PLACE 
UM WE DIDN'T REALLY REACH A VERY GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE TWO ROOMS 
SO THE THE TWO AT THE CENTRE UH WHERE IS WRITTEN PAOLA YALINA THE TWO VISITORS AND THEN MARIA PLUS DAVID 
SO I THINK THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF SPACE HERE TO UH SWITCH A LITTLE BIT AMONG THE PEOPLE JUST TO MAKE SOME KIND OF SMOOTH OCCUPANCY RATE 
IS NOT TO HAVE AN EMPTY ROOM WHEN WE HAVE NO VISITORS UM AND UH THEN A VERY FULL ROOM WHEN EVERYBODY IS IS HERE 
SO I THINK WE'RE WE ARE QUITE WILLING TO SPLIT AND PUT SAY MAYBE ONE VISITOR WITH MARIA AND DAVID UH FIFTY PER CENT IN THE OTHER ROOM WITH THE SECOND VISITOR 
SO THAT IT SMOOTH IS 
WELL YEAH 
EXACTLY SO THE VISITORS OR UH BASICALLY STAGIEUR AND IT HAPPENS THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TWO OF THEM EVEN IF IT'S ONLY FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTH 
MARTIN SEEMED TO INSIST THAT WHEN WE HAVE A VISITING PROFESSOR FOR INSTANCE 
WE CANNOT REALLY PUT HIM WITH GISELLA BECAUSE WELL THEY WOULDN'T FEEL VERY NICE THEY THEY MADE A JOKE ABOUT THAT 
SO WE SHOULD MANAGE SOME KIND OF DECENT SPACE 
IT'S TRUE THAT THIS ONE OR TWO LAST ONE OR TWO YEARS WE DIDN'T HAVE UH A VISITING PROFESSOR 
BUT UM 
YEAH SO UH I THINK YEAH THESE ARE THE OTHER MAIN POINTS 
SO ONE IS THE PLACE OF THE LOUNGE 
UH THE OTHER ONE IS THE UH THE PLACE OF THE ADMIN OFFICE WITH GISELLA 
AND THE THIRD ONE IS THE NUMBER OF VISITOR VISITING PEOPLE AND UH WELL HOW MANY OF THEM WE WANT TO ACCOMMODATE AND WHERE WHERE WE PUT IT 
THIS I THINK ARE THE OTHER MAIN DIFFERENCES 
OTHERWISE WE PRETTY MUCH AGREE ON UH ON PLACING PEOPLE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM SORRY 
I I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S TRUE I THINK YEAH THEY ARE ARE QUITE OPEN IT AT THIS 
MARTIN ALSO REMINDED US THAT UH IS QUITE NOISY 
UH HAS A LOT OF UH PHONE CALLS TO MAKE EVEN IF IT'S HERE IF HE'S HERE ONLY FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TIME 
UM SO YEAH I I I DON'T MIND THIS 
BUT UH THAT'S SOMETHING BUT IT'S TRUE YEAH WE COULD ALSO TRY TO PUT A VISITOR AND THE PROFESSOR 
UM MARTIN MADE ANOTHER POINT 
IT WAS THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES PROFESSOR HAVE TO PROFESSORS HAVE TO DISCUSS SENSITIVE MATTERS ABOUT PROJECTS AND FINANCING 
AND THEY SOMETIMES MIGHT FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DISCUSSING THIS WITH THEIR WELL IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR P. H. D. STUDENTS 
LIKE SAYING OH I I HAVE TO REDUCE HER IT FROM EIGHTY PER CENT TO FIFTY PER CENT 
THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING SO I I MEAN ALL THESE ARE CONSTRAINTS 
I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW YOU WOULD LIKE US TO PROCEED FROM FROM HERE OR IF YOU ALREADY HAVE QUESTIONS OR REACTIONS ON THIS ONE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH UM 
WELL MM-HMM 
YEAH W YEAH THAT'S TRUE THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS 
UM WELL WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT REALLY POSSIBLE TO BUILD WALLS BUT WE NOTICED THAT THIS ROOM ACTUALLY HAS TWO DOORS 
SO UH WE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE WE COULD PUT SOME KIND OF WELL SEPARATION 
I YEAH MAYBE JUST YEAH FURNITURE OR JUST UH SOME KIND OF SCREEN 
NO IT'S NOT SOUND PROOF 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WELL IT WAS ACTUALLY THIS PRESSURE FROM FROM MY GROUP THAT OLD AT THIS TO SQUEEZE A LITTLE BIT UH THE PLACE OF THE LOUNGE 
NOW HOW FOR INSTANCE WOULD THE UNIVERSITY FEEL ABOUT A ROOM THAT WOULD BE ONLY USED AS A LONG 
WOULD THEY FEEL IT'S TOO EMPTY AND THAT WE HAVE TOO MUCH SPACE 
ARE WE USE OTHER ONE PROBLEM 
THE D DO YOU USE A PROBLEM WITH HAVING A L A ROOM JUST FOR A LONG OR NO 
SO WE COULD HAVE A SEPARATE ROOM IS A LONG AS LONG AS UH WE PICK THE OTHER OFFICES 
MM 
PERSONALLY I I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS 
SO UM THAT'S THAT'S FINE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO I THINK MAYBE WE CAN AGREE ON ON THE LOUNGE IN A SEPARATE ROOM IF WE CAN MANAGE TO TO FIND SPACE ELSEWHERE 
WHAT ABOUT GISELLA HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT PUTTING HER IN A SEPARATE OFFICE 
WHICH IS THE CASE NOW I THINK 
WELL SHE HAS AN EXTRA YEAH 
WITH A VISITOR SPACE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF VISITOR YOU ARE EXACTLY 
SO WE COULD SAY SOME KIND OF LOW KEY VISITOR 
THIS IS UH VERY NICE 
MM-HMM 
ACTUALLY GISELLA FIFTY PER CENT MEANS THAT SHE'S THERE HALF TIME UH GENERALLY IN THE MORNINGS 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM I THINK IT'S WHAT I TRIED TO TO DO BEFORE IT'S THE SHARED LOUNGE UH THE 
UM 
DO YOU HAVE ASSISTANTS WITH PROFESSORS 
YEAH 
NO I THINK THIS IS QUITE ACCEPTED AND IT'S A BIT THE CASE 
NO I THINK IT'S UH THE LOUNGE UH THE ADMIN ROOM 
NO 
YEAH AND THE NUMBER OF SLOTS FOR VISITORS AND FOR THIS NEW STUDENT WHO ARRIVES 
BECAUSE HAVING JUST ONE SPARE PLACE THIS WAS PROBABLY THE STRONGEST DISAGREEMENT IN MY GROUP 
PEOPLE SAID UH WE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST TWO OR THREE SPARE PLACES JUST FOR YOU KNOW GROWING OR SOMETIMES YOU HAVE THREE INTERNS THAT ARRIVE 
SO EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT PERFECT PLACES 
UM 
YEAH THAT'S YEAH THAT'S HOW WE DID IN IN OUR PROPOSAL YEAH 
OH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH MM-HMM 
BUT THEN WE NEED TO SQUEEZE IN IN ONE OF THE OTHER PERSON ROOMS SOME EXTRA VISITOR SPACE AND UH I I THINK SO 
IF IF WE WANT TO KEEP THE READING ROOM 
UH I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE BY PLAYING A LITTLE BIT WITH THE FURNITURE 
UM SO YEAH 
I THINK ANOTHER POINT HERE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU YOU FEEL ABOUT IT AS WELL 
THE FACT THAT MARTIN IS USED UH WOULD BE QUITE NOISY FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TIME 
SO MANY PHONE CALLS 
SO I WOULDN'T PUT HIM IN THAT BIG OFFICE EVEN IF HE'S FIFTY PER CENT BUT HE'S STILL A PROFESSOR HERE AND WE GOT HIM FROM E. P. F. L. 
SO THAT I I THINK I MEAN IF WE NEED TO REACH A SOLUTION NOW I I WOULDN'T MIND WORKING FROM YOUR PLAN AND DOING SOME CHANGES 
OR IF YOU PREFER WORKING FROM MENU AND DOING OTHER CHANGES 
SO UM 
OKAY YEAH 
DEPENDS HOW HOW EASY YOU CAN WRITE ON IT 
OKAY SO LET'S KEEP THE READING ROOM 
UH ALSO I THINK PIERRETTE PIERRETTE AND MARTIN P SHOULD DESERVE AT LEAST I THINK OFFICES WITH ONE PERSON NOT WITH TWO 
OH 
YEAH 
WE WE NEVER ASKED THEM IT COULD BE ABOUT UM IN THE OTHER SIDE THEY HAVE 
I THINK IN REAL PROJECT IN COMMON SO I WONDER 
WH I I THINK I WOULD PREFER AND PROBABLY MY GROUP WOULD PREFER 
TO USE THEM WITH THE RESPECTIVE ASSISTANTS AND I THINK PIERRETTE PLUS MARIANNE IS A VERY GOOD COMBINATION 
WHY NOT SWITCHING THEM FROM YEAH THAT OFFICE 
YEAH SWITCH THE WHOLE GROUP 
YEAH MARIANNE SWEDISH AND THEN PIERRETTE 
BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO MARIANNES 
AND BOTH FAMILY NAMES START WITH S. T. A. 
NO 
NO NOT TRUE 
THE JUST S. 
YES 
MM-HMM 
NOW LET'S DO SOMETHING WITH MARTIN TOO 
UM 
YEAH MAYBE WE CAN WRITE IT DOWN SAY VIS VIS ONE 
DAVID IS FIFTY PER CENT AND VISITOR ONE SHOULD YEAH OR SPARE OR IT'S FINE 
MM-HMM 
GISELLA 
YEAH MM-HMM 
I THINK THAT'S CLOSER TO WHAT I SAID 
WELL BECAUSE ACTUALLY WE HAVE THIS PROJECT IN COMMON 
YOU KNOW CALL I. M. TWO 
UM YEAH I THINK IT'S AND SO D COULD WE UM 
MM-HMM 
WELL I THINK YEAH ALWAYS GISELLA BUT I THINK THERE IS NO WAY TO UH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SORT OF SECOND UH 
UM YEAH 
SO YOU WOULD PUT GISELLA IN A ONE PERSON ROOM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WE COULD YEAH EVEN PUT 
WE COULDN'T PUT MAGGIE AND BRUNO TOGETHER 
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE CASE 
MM-HMM 
NO LET'S LEAVE IT LIKE THIS FOR THE MOMENT 
HOW DO YOU FEEL BECAUSE YOUR OFFICE WELL THREE PERSONS AND YOU ARE ALL FULL TIME IN THERE IS YOU WITH NANCY AND MORE 
UH-HUH 
YEAH AND YOU HAVE PARMENIDES IN COMMON WITH NANCY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND DO YOU THINK WE COULD PUT A VISITOR WITH NIKOS AND YALINA 
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ALSO IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR YOU KNOW YALINA'S THAT WE SAID IN OUR MEETING 
YALINA'S MASTER THESIS SHOULD BE DEFENDED IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS 
SO WE COULD AT LEAST THINK IT'S SORT OF AN OPEN PLACE 
ARE WE COULD GET THAT OFFICE FOR YOU AND NANCY AND PUT NIKOS AND UH YALINA WITH MARIA AND A VISITOR 
WHAT ABOUT THAT 
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE A CALMER SPOT 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT A VISITOR ACTUALLY HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH PAPER SO FOR INSTANCE MAYBE THEY DON'T NEED UH 
WELL UH THE PLACE TO PUT THEIR FILES YOU KNOW A SMALLER DRAWER 
THEY JUST NEED A A DESK AND PROBABLY JUST ONE DRAWER UNDER UNDERNEATH 
YEAH PROBABLY NOT 
I THINK IT WOULDN'T BE UH YALINA AND MAYBE WE COULD THINK OF A VISITOR TOO HERE 
SO THAT 
THINK SO 
BECAUSE REMEMBER THERE IS ALSO THIS PAOLA ARRIVING UM IN THE NEW PROJECT 
SO YOU KNOW SUSAN INSISTED THAT UH 
WE SHOULD BE 
AND IT IT'S AL ALSO IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR BECAUSE NIKOS AND YALINA ARE WELL 
NIKOS IS UM RESEARCH STUDENT YALINA WILL FINISH HER MASTER THESIS SO IT'S 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH PAOLA OR MM-HMM 
OR MAYBE PAOLA WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S QUITE OKAY 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANY PREFERENCE OF MAGGIE BEING ALONE OR WITH BRUNO OR NO 
YEAH 
UM DAVID MENTIONED ALSO THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF GENDER BALANCE 
UH I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A STRONG CONSTRAINT BUT I THINK WE ARE DOING PRETTY WELL 
WELL SO 
I'M NOT SURE THAT WAS WHAT WAS MEANT BUT 
OH 
OKAY THAT'S FINE IF HE MENTIONED THIS TO YOU THAT'S QUITE NICE 
AND OKAY YEAH I'M WITH MARTIN 
NOT VERY BALANCED 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S WHY OKAY IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SHARING THE OFFICE WITH MARTIN THAT'S FINE 
OKAY YEAH THAT LOOKS GOOD 
SO AGNES WITH MARIANNE AND DAVID 
YEAH SO YOU HAVE I. M. TWO IN COMMON 
THAT'S NICE AND UH IS FIFTY PER CENT SO THAT MEANS THE OFFICE IS NOT VERY CROWDED 
OKAY THE OTHER ONE IS A BIT CROWDED BUT THAT'S OKAY 
GISEL 
MM-HMM 
UM I I THINK FOR THE MOMENT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL WHAT WAS USED IN IN MY GROUP ACTUALLY SUSAN WHO KNOWS PROFESSORS FROM OTHER UM OTHER FACULTIES 
WELL SHE NOTICED THAT MOST OF THEM HAVE ROOMS ALONE 
SO THIS IS TRUE FOR SUSAN AND MAGGIE BUT NOT TRUE HERE FOR PIERRETTE AND AND AND MARTIN 
SO WE CAN ALREADY ARGUE THAT UH WE'RE SQUEEZING IN EVEN THE THE PROFESSORS 
IT'S TRUE THAT THE READING ROOM BUT YOU KNOW WE FOUGHT SO MUCH TO HAVE TO SO LET'S UH LET'S TRY TO HAVE TO THREE 
AND I THINK PUTTING FOUR PEOPLE IN A THREE PERSON ROOM IS ALREADY A SIGN THAT UH WE ARE ALREADY QUITE UH QUITE FULL 
SO UM I THINK YEAH IT'S NORMALLY THE NOMINAL CAPACITY OF THIS I THINK IT'S UH EIGHTEEN PEOPLE 
UM EIGHTEEN OR OR SEVENTEEN 
AND WE'RE ONLY FIFTEEN IF YOU DON'T COUNT PAOLA AND SOME VISITOR'S PLACE 
AND I THINK IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT TO HAVE SPACE FOR VISITORS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE NO VISITORS OR IF YOU CANNOT TAKE A NEW 
WELL INTERN DURING THE SUMMER YOU'RE VERY MUCH HANDICAPPED 
SO I THINK WE'RE YEAH NO WELL THE REACTION OF MY GROUP WAS THAT THIS WAS ALMOST FULL ALREADY SO I WILL WE TRIED IT 
I THEN 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SO I THINK YEAH 
WHAT WE COULD SAY ABOUT THE READING ROOM IS THAT WE WE SQUEEZE QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN IN THE OTHER OFFICES SO I THINK IT'S OKAY 
UM 
MM-HMM 
PERFECT JUST SAVE IT PLEASE 
MAYBE IT'S ANOTHER NAME 
JUST SAY OKAY IT'S FINE 
OKAY 
SO MY GROUP ALSO ASKED TO CIRCULATE THE FINAL PROPOSAL JUST TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO MAJOR PROBLEM 
AND THE NUMBERS 
AND WE'RE DONE 
THANK YOU SIRS 
YES 
YEAH MARTIN 
MORE 
OH

YEP 
THANK YOU 
OH YEAH 
YOU DON'T PUT YOUR HEADSET MICROPHONE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I HAVE ACTUALLY YEAH THE WE CAN USE THE REPORT HERE AND THE DEMO 
AND THE GOAL OF UH THIS MEETING IS TO PRESENT THE VIDEO SHOT DETECTOR TO OLIVIER OKAY 
OKAY 
SO YEAH IT WAS MY PROJECT UM DURING MY INTERNSHIP AT IDIAP UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF JEAN MARC 
AND SO YOU SAW AS YOU SAW IN THE EMAIL I SENT UH OKAY 
I DIDN'T SEND THIS VIDEO IS THE NEW ONE 
I JUST UM UH PROCESSED FROM YOUR IMAGES 
YEAH 
BUT UH LET'S LET'S START BY THE VIDEO FROM FRIDAY 
CINETIS DEMO ONE 
YEAH 
SO THIS WAS UH 
OKAY 
YEAH HERE IN THE LEFT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS BUT UH AS APPLIED 
SO THIS DETECTOR UH DETECTED THE THIRTY SHOTS 
AND IF YOU CLICK ON UH PLUS BUTTON YOU CAN EXPAND IT AND SO THE KEY FRAMES THAT ARE IN FACT UH FIVE EXTRACTED FRAMES FROM THE SHOT 
BUT I THINK THE UH IS IT SO IT'S T EXTRACTED UH WITHOUT UH USING SUB SHOTS UH IT'S SIMPLY UH FIVE DOWN SAM YEAH DOWN SAMPLING 
UM SO I WE CAN USE THE VIDEO ACTUALLY UH THE ENTIRE VIDEO CAN OPEN WITH REAL PLAYER 
I HOPE IT WILL WORK 
SO WE DON'T HAVE THE THE SOUND AND IT WON'T BE GRABBED THE VIDEO WON'T UH I DON'T KNOW IF UH 
OKAY IT'S NOT GOOD QUALITY 
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
NO NO NO NO NO NO 
IT'S IN REAL MEDIA SO IT'S VERY COMPRESSED 
OH OKAY 
UH TEN YEAH 
AND THEN THERE'S UM 
OKAY 
YES 
AND THIS ONE YEAH IT'S A DISSOLVE IT'S A DISSOLVE SO IT DOESN'T DETECT YEAH 
WHEN I SAW THE M. WITH M. PLAYER IT'S A DISSOLVE YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS ONE IF WE USE WAS CORRECTLY UH YOU SEE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT THERE IS A MENU 
BUT OKAY BECAUSE THERE IS NO MOTION IN FACT BETWEEN THE TWO SHOTS 
YEAH OKAY OKAY 
THE COW 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH MAYBE TO EXPLAIN THIS METHOD WAS USING UH A SIMPLE UH UH DISTANCE BETWEEN UH CONSECUTIVE HISTOGRAMS 
AND WE DIDN'T USE MOTION FEATURES AT ALL FOR THAT THAT'S WHY I W 
YEAH OKAY 
ENOUGH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WITH A SLIDING WINDOW 
I CAN SHOW YOU UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW IF WE C WE WANT TO MAKE UH IS THE WHITEBOARD OR HERE IT'S UH IT WAS UH IT DOES IT'S INFRA ONLY TH THIS PART BUT UH SHOT BOUNDARY DETECTION AS IN FRENCH UNFORTUNATELY 
BUT UH TH THIS IMAGE SHOWS THE RESULTS USING MOTION WHEN YOU USE IS THE MOTION FEATURES AND HERE IN THE RIGHT SO WHEN USING THE HISTOGRAM UH DISTANCE 
AND THE THE MOTION FEATURES CAN BETTER SHOW WHAT'S GOING ON WHEN THERE IS SUCH A DIFFICULT UH TRANSITION WHILE WITH THE HISTOGRAM UM 
YEAH IT JUST SHOWS THAT THERE IS A SHOT UH CHANGE AT THE END BUT EVEN FOR DISSOLVES 
I DON'T HAVE EXAMPLES HERE BUT UM THERE IS NOT A STRICT UH TRANSITION 
UH IT'S CONTINUOUS FOR DISSOLVES 
DISSOLVES IS UH YEAH 
YEAH 
NO NO NOW IT'S UH WELL FOR THE VIDEO YOU SAW IT W IT'S BHATTACHARYA 
YEAH 
OKAY SET THE BEGINNING 
SO THERE IS THE IDEA IS HAVING A SLIDING WINDOW 
UM WE HAVE ALREADY ALL THE DATA THAT IS IN THE GRAPH 
AND THEN TO DETECT UH THE THE THE THE CHANGES WE WE DO A CALCULATION UM WITH POINTS UNDER THIS SLIDING WINDOW WITHIN THIS SLIDING WINDOW 
AND UH WE CALCULATE SO WHAT DO WE HERE 
UM 
NO IF WE WANT TO DETECT THAT UH THESE POINTS IN THE MIDDLE IS HIGHER THAN UH 
THE 
EXACTLY YEAH 
ALPHA 
ALPHA TIMES THE MAXIMUM OF THE OTHER ONES 
THE C 
BUT IF YOU ARE IN THE MAXIMUM ALREADY NEED TO THIS POINT WE CHECK SIMPLY IF UH THIS VALUE IS ALPHA TIMES THE THE MAX OF THE OTHER POINTS 
LET'S SAY THESE POINTS HERE 
UM I MAYBE FOR EACH IT'S IT SIX BUT UH YEAH BUT UH FOR BHATTACHARYA IT'S FOR THE TESTS I DID IT TWO POINT FOUR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
NO 
MM 
UH I IN THE THE FIRST SHEET 
YEAH I SAW THAT IT WAS DETECTED AS A SHOT YEAH 
YOU WANT TO SEE NOW 
OKAY 
BUT HE DIDN'T OKAY 
IT IS UH OKAY 
THIS IS IDIAP LAPTOP AS YOU CAN U OKAY 
SO HERE IN FACT AFTER TWELVE UM I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S I THINK IT'S TWELVE FRAMES 
YEAH 
OH YEAH MAYBE YOU'RE BURNING BUT 
OH THERE IS AN UH UH 
I DIDN'T UH UH I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO THE THE REAL MEDIA 
BUT UM YEAH IT'S COMPLICATED 
YEAH HERE WE CAN SEE THAT YEAH 
IT TWO POINT FOUR 
MM 
AND THEN THERE IS TRANSLATION ON THE RIGHT YEAH 
MM MM MM 
I CAN USE UH THERE IS ANOTHER PROGRAMME THAT CAN SEE 
UH THE N. UH 
IT'S I THINK IT'S IF THERE THERE ARE FIVE NORMALLY 
IF WE PUT EXPAND ALL 
YEAH 
THE OTHER ONE I HAD PROBLEMS CONVERTING UH UH THE VIDEO INTO D. V. X. 
AND THEN UH SO I SAID THE PROGRAMME FROM UH SOFTWARE FROM SEBASTIEN P. P. I. P. M. TO A. V. I. 
BECAUSE YEAH ONE THING UH MAYBE WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IS THE LIBRARY UH 
IT'S UH IT DOESN'T UH COMPILE ANYMORE ON DEBIAN MACHINES AND YEAH SOME MAYBE SOME WORK HAS TO BE DONE IN THIS 
I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS UH IMAGE DOESN'T APPEAR THIS IS THE UM UM THE FROM THAT IS UH UH EXTRACTED TO BE THE SHOT KEY FRAME HERE 
THIS ONE IS THIS IN THE MIDDLE ONE 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHY IT DOESN'T APPEAR BUT IT JUST UH A SIMPLE PROBLEM IN THE GET FRAME 
BUT WHAT I CAN SHOW YOU NOW IS A LITTLE PROGRAMME IF WE WANT TO BE UM VERY PRECISE ABOUT SO IT'S UM GET FRAMES 
OKAY C. G. I. HERE 
AND WE WERE INTERESTED IN AROUND WHAT DO DO YOU WANT 
AROUND SIX SEVEN SECONDS 
OKAY 
UH IF WE DO NEXT 
OH 
YEAH 
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG 
SO IT DETECTS 
YEAH IN FACT YEAH THAT'S WHY I SAID IT'S IT'S A FRAME NUMBER 
UH W I DON'T KNOW WHY YEAH YEAH YEAH 
IT'S A FRAME NUMBER 
THIS IS A FRAME NUMBER THIS IS ONE SECOND BUT I I KEPT THE FRAME NUMBER 
IT'S TWELVE FRAMES ZERO SECONDS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO IF WE DO EVERY SECOND UH I DO THE MIDDLE FRAME IS UH THIS ONE THOUSAND 
OKAY 
DO YOU TH IT'S ANOTHER KIND OF BROWSING PAGE 
BUT UH TO BE MORE PRECISE ABOUT UH TO TO CHECK MAYBE TH THIS YEAH EXACTLY YEAH YEAH 
ANYWAY YOU GO BACK TO ONE FRAME AROUND OF ONE SIXTY FOR INSTANCE I DON'T KNOW 
AND AND THERE IS YEAH THAT'S IT YOU KNOW 
PREV 
OKAY 
YOU SEE THAT THERE IS UH OKAY IT'S NOT A SHOT CHANGE IT'S A MOTION ACTUALLY HERE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH I S YEAH 
YEAH 
WHEN YOU HAVE YEAH THE THE GOAL RESULTS UH THEN YEAH IN FACT IT'S NOT A SHOT CHANGE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THIS WOULD UM BE MADE UH MANUALLY ACTUALLY 
WHEN YOU SAY FROM THIS SHOT AT THIS SHOT IS USING A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE SOMEONE WHO WOULD DO MANUALLY FOR EACH VIDEO 
METHOD YEAH 
YEAH MM 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
THIS IS THE IN IN THE D. V. D. 
MAYBE OKAY WE CAN UH AS A LITTLE BIT OF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE 
WELL NO IT'S OKAY 
OKAY UH IN FACT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT 
BUT NOW I UNDERSTAND BETTER THAT CINETIS WANTS THIS KIND OF METHOD TO HELP THEM TO RESTORE AND TO APPLY THE ALGORI SOME ALGORITHMS TO TO TO MAKE A BETTER MOVIE 
OKAY 
IT'S NOT FOR THE CLIENT FOR THE USER WHO WILL UH MAYBE OKAY 
OKAY 
ALSO BUT OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OH OKAY 
OKAY 
OH OKAY YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BECAUSE UH DID THE MOVIE SO HE WANTS TO OKAY TO ARCHIVE HE WANTS TO OKAY 
THIS IS YEAH ANOTHER MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
AND THIS COULD BE DONE BY THROUGH INTERNET 
MM 
MM-HMM 
FROM THE CLIENT POINT OF VIEW AND FROM THE PREPARATION OF THE MOVIE D. V. D. MM 
OKAY I WILL PLAY YEAH 
WE HAD AN ARROW HERE OR WHAT 
IT'S 
THE 
IF I GO TO MEAN THERE IS SOMETHING 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS 
AN OLD MENU UH THERE IS ONE MENU ON THE D. V. D. 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO THIS IS THE SAME VIDEO A THE THE U. V. I. NUMBER ONE 
AND IN THE ON THE D. V. D. I SAW THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER STUFF 
I DUNNO 
THIS ONE 
THE SAME 
OKAY 
OOPS 
OH OKAY 
OH 
THERE ARE TWO FILES 
OKAY I UNDERSTAND 
OKAY 
RUN THE OKAY 
UM 
YEAH ALMOST 
I WOULD MAYBE A LESS A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN UH A BIT MORE THAN REAL TIME MAYBE 
I WILL HAVE TO CHECK BUT IF IT'S FIVE MINUTES VIDEOS IT'S LIKE DONE IN YEAH QUICKLY 
OKAY 
COMPONENTS OPEN C. V. 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OPEN C. YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THAT WE'LL SEE THE WHITEBOARD 
SO IN FACT YEAH THE INTERFACE IS QUITE IS QUITE SIMPLE TO USE 
UM FOR INSTANCE YOU USE UM IN THE UH IN THE U. R. L. I PUT OKAY I I DISCO THERE IS M. M. M. DOT IDIAP DOT C. H. SLASH V. C. G. I. BIN 
SLASH VIDEO BROWSER 
OKAY UH SLASH VIDEO BROWSER THREE FRAMES 
THREE FRAMES DOT H. T. M. L. 
AND THEN THIS C. G. I. PROGRAMME ASK THE MM PARAMETER C. VIDEO AND M. EQUALS CINETIS OKAY DEMO ONE 
IN FACT UM I JUST EXPLAIN HOW TO PUT THE DATA ON M. M. M. BUT IT'S QUITE SIMPLE 
WHEN YOU LOG INTO M. M. M. IS WITH A C. C. S. S. H. FOR INSTANCE UM SO YOU JUST PUT IT'S WORKING LIKE THIS M. M. M. DATA 
VIDEO BROWSER 
OH OKAY SLASH 
AND THEN 
THIS IS THE NAME OF THE NEW DIRECTORY YOU WILL CREATE 
DEMO ONE 
AND THERE STANDS THERE IS COUPLE OF THINGS WELL IT'S UH 
THIS NAME IS I WILL SAY THIS IS VIDEO NAME IS VIDEO NAME 
DOT A. V. I. YOU JUST BECAUSE WE NEED THE U. V. I. IS THAT WE CAN UH 
YEAH WE CAN DO THE THE GET FRAME 
OTHERWISE IT'S NOT NECESSARY 
UH UH F AND ALSO FOR THE 
YEAH AND THIS IS NO NO NO UH THIS IS DONE IN THE FLY 
WITH GET FRAME 
SO YOU NEED THAT YOU AND UH THE X. M. L. V SO IT'S VIDEO NAME 
AND I COULD DATA DOT X. M. L. BUT IN FACT IT'S JUST A SIMPLE CONVENTION I WE COULD HAVE PUT NOTHING BUT I JUST PUT DATA 
TH IT'S A CONVENTION 
DATA AND THEN VIDEO NAME 
OKAY IT'S R. M. NINE DOT R. M. FOR OTHER STUFF 
BUT IN FACT YEAH WHEN I THINK NOW WE COULD HAVE UH 
ONLY WITH UH EXTENSION YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE 
THE NAME IS ONE OF IN FACT YEAH SO SO YEAH 
YEAH SO THE SAME AS THE DIRECTORY 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN VIDEO NAMING ALSO BUT IT'S THE SAME AS A DIRECTORY 
AND THAT'S IT ACTUALLY 
WHEN YOU YOU U YOU DO THAT 
I DID THE SAME FOR KAYAK YOU SAY KAYAK IN FACT NOW IT'S KAYAK AND THEN YOU CAN SEE 
AND THIS OUTPUT YEAH SO YOUR THIS OUTPUT UH THIS FILE IS AN OUTPUT FROM THE MM THE SOFTWARE THE SHOT BOUNDARY DETECTION SOFTWARE 
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE FORMAT YEAH 
YEAH UH ACTUALLY WE 
OH YEAH I DON'T YEAH WE CANNOT USE 
IT'S YEAH IT'S UH THE VIDEO SCENE SHOT 
IT'S HIERARCHICAL IN X. M. L. AND KEY FRAME TIME STAMP AND THE END FROM THE TIME STAMP AND THE VIDEO LOCATION HE KNOWS HOW TO GET THE FORM 
EACH OF THESE FRAMES 
AND IF WE DO IN FACT I DON'T KNOW YEAH IT'S MOZILLA FIREFOX VIEW PAGE SOURCE OKAY VIEW FRAME SOURCE 
AND EVERY FRAME IS STORED INTO UH A B A BACKUP IN FACT EVERY FRAME UM IT'S M. M. M. WHO MANAGE THIS AUTOMATICALLY 
SO THAT UM WHEN UH YOU ASK FOR THIS FROM IN FACT WE CAN OKAY I JUST VIEW FRAME SOURCE 
WHEN I VIEW IMAGE WHEN I SAY VIEW IMAGE 
WHEN I SAY VIEW IMAGE ON THIS FRAME 
P WE GO THERE AND THIS IS UM IN FACT IT'S A PERL PROGRAMME THAT OUTPUTS IN FA INSTEAD OF OUTPUTTING H. T. M. L. OR TEXT IT OUTPUTS UH J. PEG 
FROM THE VIDEO WITH A TIME STAMP IT OUTPUTS A J. PEG 
THIS IS QUITE UH NICE 
AND 
YEAH 
AND THIS IMAGE SO I THIS IMAGE IS OUTPUT UH OUTPUTTED TO THE CLIENT 
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S WHAT I DID UH 
HERE 
IN THE OTHER APPLICATION YEAH 
YEAH I DUNNO 
YEAH HERE 
I IF THERE ARE YEAH THE M. M. M. DEVELOPERS SO I'M PART OF THAT BUT UH WE COULD WE COULD UH YEAH IT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
UM I WANTED TO SAW IT IS TO DO IS SAY SOMETHING ELSE 
UM UH YEAH AND THE IMAGES ARE SENT TO YOUR BROWSER THE CLIENT TO THIS BROWSER 
BUT ALSO KEPT IN UH A DIRECTORY IN UH IN M. M. M. 
EXACTLY A CACHE 
I SAY BACKUP BUT IT'S A CACHE 
UM THAT'S THAT'S HOW IT WORKS 
NO NO NO IT'S OKAY 
UM FOR THE COUCH UH 
WE HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE ON M. M. M. IS THE THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM UH YEAH FOR A NEW WINDOW 
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH 
AND IT DETECTS OKAY 
YEAH 
SO YOU GO INSIDE THE GET FRAME FUNCTION YOU SEE WHERE IT I IT SAVES IT 
AND THEN THERE IS A SPECIAL NAMING CONVENTION AND YOU CAN REMOVE THE BUT I IT'S C YEAH IT'S TRUE 
NO 
BECAUSE THERE IT'S IN CACHE SO THAT IF I PUT ANOTHER VIDEO WITH THE SAME NAME THEY TH THEY WILL HAPPEN AGAIN 
THEY WILL UH APPEAR THIS FRAMES WILL APPEAR 
YEAH YEAH EX IF YOU HAVE THE SAME DECOMPOSITION BUT 
BUT UH YEAH IN M. M. M. F NOW WE DON'T HAVE SUCH MANY VIDEOS SO 
BUT IF YOU PUT YEAH IN ANOTHER DIRECTORY UH THEN IT WOULD WORK OR OR A NEW NAMING CONVENTION WITH UH SPECIAL UH YEAH CODE UH 
YEAH M. M. M. CACHE 
YEAH 
BUT IT IT CAN GO ON THE BROWSER CACHE ALSO 
THE FIRST TIME IS DONE ONLINE 
YEAH YOU CAN SEE HERE YEAH 
UH THE FIRST TIME IS DONE O 
YOU KNOW YOU SEE THAT 
WELL HERE IT'S IT WAS CACHE BECAUSE I ALREADY PRESSED PREVIEW BUT NOW IT'S IN THE FLY 
SO IT'S QUITE QUICK 
THIS 
AND THEN IF YOU CAME YEAH 
BECAUSE THE IMAGES ARE ALREADY GENERATED 
AND MAYBE THEY ARE IN THE COUCH OF THIS BROWSER THIS COMPUTER 
SO OKAY 
THAT'S WHY IT'S YEAH IT WAS UH USED WITH UH YEAH SEBASTIEN UH DID THE C. FUNCTION AND UH YEAH 
AND UH THE THE IS CALLING THIS UH C. UH EXECUTABLE AND IT WAS USED WITH M. M. M. SERVER WITH PIERRE A AND THE BEGINNING WHEN YEAH 
UM YEAH YEAH 
UH THE MOVIES OR 
IN FACT UH W W WE COULD YOU KNOW OKAY YOU KNOW ALL THESE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE THAT YOU USE UH OKAY 
IN FACT OKAY 
MM YES 
YES WE COULD DO THAT 
WE COULD PUT UH CINETIS SLASH HERE AND THEN A CINETIS SLASH IS THE S YEAH IT WORKS 
BUT THE UH THE THE POINT IS THIS INTERFACE IS UH I THINK SIX OR SEVEN FILES ONLY 
X. M. L. UH WELL IT'S PER C. G. I. THAT OUTPUT X. M. L. AND X. S. L. 
SO IT'S IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL TO TO TO MAKE A NEW LIKE A CINETIS BROWSER OR YOU KNOW VIDEO BROWSER 
YEAH WE WE WE COPY ALL THE FILES AND THERE IS UH JUST ONE UM ONE PARAMETER ONE UH STRONG 
THAT WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE THIS DATA IS AND WE COULD PR CREATE A M. M. M. DATA VIDEO BROWSER UH CINETIS OR SOMETHING ELSE 
Y IT'S UH EX EXTENSIBLE AND UH SO 
YEAH 
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT I IT'S NOT UH IT WAS UH YOU KNOW TH THIS IS WORKING THE EXPAND ALL ABOUT UH THIS IS UH 
YEAH TO DO LIST OR SOMETHING 
IN A VIDEO ANNOTATION ON A VIDEO STRUCTURE CO CORRECTION 
BUT I IT'S NOT EASY ON THE WEB WITH H. H. T. M. L. PAGES TO TO DO UH SUCH CORRECTIONS LIKE UH VIDEO STRUCTURE CORRECTIONS FOR INSTANCE 
FOR THAT YOU AND IT'S POSSIBLE MAYBE UH ON INTERFACES LIKE FLASH OR JAVA 
UH BUT STILL UH I I I THERE IS UH IT TAKES BAS MORE WORK AND BUT I YEAH YEAH I MEAN IT'S GOOD GOOD POINT 
WELL UH YOU WE CAN MAKE FOR FOR INSTANCE FOR T. S. R. T. S. R. UH VIDEOS 
ALESSANDRO UH ASKED ME TO DO THE SAME THING AND W I PUT UH WE HAD UH LIKE A PASSWORD CONVENTION 
SO THIS IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE FOR THESE VIDEOS 
SO IT'S NOT UH 
WELL F YEAH IT IS THERE IS ON POSSIBLE PRODUCTIONS FOR THESE VIDEOS 
MAYBE WHAT I SAY I'M VERY TIRED 
BUT UH IF PO YEAH IT'S DEMO AND UH NO CAN SAY YOU HAVE TO GUESS THE NAME IT BUT UH YEAH 
BU Y YEAH A GOOD POINT UH ABOUT PASSWORD PROTECTION ISSUES UH ARE THE PRIVACY ISSUES UH 
OKAY 
UH UH YEAH ALL THE FRAMEWORK IS READY WITH A T. R. S. T. S. R. VIDEOS SO 
USUALLY WHAT WE DO SOMETIMES UH OKAY JUST TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT PASSWORD PROTECTIONS 
SOMETIMES 
INSTEAD OF HAVING UM 
A PURELY SECURE DIRECTORY WE P WE WE PUT A CO CODE NUMBER LIKE UH SO THAT IT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS INSTEAD OF VIDEO M UH NAME EQUALS KAYAK THEN WE WOULD HAVE UH ZERO SIX SEVEN UH FIVE EURO 
YOU KNOW TWO 
AND THEN THIS DIRECTORY FROM OUTSIDE WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE THAT OKAY NOT ONLY THE VIDEO NAME THIS U. R. L. IS NOT ACCESSIBLE 
BUT ALSO WE SHOULD TAKE CARE THAT IN FACT M. M. M. IT'S AN M. M. M. DATA VIDEO BROWSER AND THIS IS ACCESSIBLE FROM OUTSIDE 
WE SHOULD TAKE CARE THAT THIS DIRECTORY OR IN FACT THIS DIRECTORY IS NOT LISTABLE YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT LIST FROM OUTSIDE UH WITH UH F. T. P. OR H. T. T. P. 
YEAH SIMPLE THINGS WITH PRIVACY ISSUES ABOUT UH I THERE ARE SOME METHODS AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THINGS PRIVATE 
I YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING BUT I WOULD SAY THAT FOR THE C. CODE UH 
YEAH I I I JUST WANT WOULD LIKE TO STRESS SOMETHING IS THAT UM YEAH 
IF YOU WANT WANT TO USE THE NEW VERSIONS ETCETERA 
I THINK UH WE NEED TO GO A LITTLE BIT THROUGH THE CODE AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TO TO HELP IT IT FOR INSTANCE THE CLASSES ABOUT VIDEO STRUCTURE 
ETCETERA TO PUT THEM YEAH 
AND 
YEAH IN FACT IT'S NOT THERE IS NO TOSH I IT WAS CALLED VISION LIB TO READ UH TO TO EXTRACT ONE FROM EACH FRAME OF A VIDEO 
YOU KNOW 
SO IT W FROM SEBASTIEN IT WAS IN THE TOSH LIBRARY 
BUT UH IT'S NOTHING W TO DO WITH TOSH AND IT'S USING UH UH THE OPEN C. V. AND UH SOME CLASSES FROM UH JEAN MARC UH FOUR 
YEAH BHATTACHARYA DISTANCE ETCETERA 
IMAGE PROCESSING 
IMAGE PROCESSING AND STUFF 
WE CAN FORGET TOSH YEAH 
YEAH 
UM SO IT'S FOR THIRTY SO WE NEED AN HOUR IT'S IT'S GOOD 
JUST IF YOU WANT YEAH 
THIS IS THE PARAMETERS OF THE OF THE C. PROGRAMME BUT UH USAGE 
VIDEO ONE OKAY 
UH THE OUTPUT FILE X. M. L. 
OUTPUT FILE DIST IT'S THE DISTANCE UM BETWEEN EACH HISTOGRAM 
SO THAT IF THE X. M. L. UH YOU FEEL THERE IS NOT ENOUGH UM UH SHOTS YOU CAN INSTEAD OF REPROCESSING THE VIDEO YOU YOU REPROCESS THIS FILE 
AND ALSO SOME OTHER STUFF IS FOR INSTANCE ALPHA THRESHOLD WE TALKED ABOUT IS SET IT TWO POINT FOUR AND UH YEAH 
SO THE UH THE THE STEP WE ALWAYS USE ONE AND IT SHOULD BE ONE BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S STUCK BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE FRAMES 
YEAH BUT UH IT DOESN'T W YEAH IT IT'S BETTER TO TO KEEP IT IN 
YEAH 
SO DETECTION LATENCY IS ABOUT THE UM IT'S HALF OF THE WINDOWS THA YEAH SLIDING WINDOW 
OPTION FOR KEY FRAME EXTRACTION OKAY 
UH SUB THRESHOLD YEAH 
LEAVE IT IT IN YEAH 
OH YEAH 
MAYBE I I WILL UH I WILL GIVE YOU THIS FILE IN UH AS A RHY IT'S A KIND OF RHYTHMIA YEAH 
I JUST FOR PREPARING THIS UH NICE DISCUSSION 
UM UM I'M QUITE HAPPY TO TO TO DO THAT I IT'S GOOD WHEN YOU DO UH SOMETHING THAT THERE IS SOMEONE USING IT 
BUT UH BUT 
AT LEAST YEAH WITH THE INTERFACE IT'S QUITE FUNNY TO TO USE UM DO THAT THE Q QUICKLY YOU CAN DO SOMETHING IN ONE YEAH 
IN THIRTY OUT OF THE VIDEO I TEN IS TEN MINUTES IN THIRTY MINUTES 'CAUSE IT'S N NOT A LOT OF THINGS TO CHANGE 
OR EVEN IT CAN DO IT UH IT CAN WE CAN DO IT QUITE AUTOMATICALLY 
IT CAN BE DONE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YEAH IT 
SO THE REAL MEDIA SO UH YEAH A PARALLEL THING THAT FROM THE U. V. I. YOU CONVERT IT INTO REAL MEDIA AND IT IS DONE ON WINDOWS 
OH 
YEAH 
MM THERE IS A A THE FOR ONE IS OKAY 
YOU CAN USE THE FOR WE HAVE A LICENSE HERE AT IDIAP BUT UH THE IF YOU WANT TO PAY 
YOU PAY FOR OPTIONS SUCH AS UH RESIZE OR CROPPING BUT IN FACT MAYBE WE DON'T NEED THAT AND UH IT'S CALLED ELIX PRODUCER 
YEAH I FORGOT YEAH YEAH UH ELIX PRODUCER AND AND THAT'S IT 
YOU CAN YOU CAN I IT IT I 
YES 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
AND YEAH WITH REAL MEDIA 
WELL THIS IS YOU CAN BUY OR YOU CAN ORDER FOR FOR AN INTERNET 
NO NO NO NO FOR THE REAL MEDIA 
AND UM YOU DIDN'T SEE ABOUT THE OR THE REAL MEDIA UM SO CALLED VIA A REAL SERVER 
SO IT'S R. T. S. P. THE CONNECTION AND I IT'S STREAMING VIDEO STREAMING SO IT'S NOT H. T. T. P. 
SO THAT IT CAN PLAY UH SMOOTHLY AND BUT WE ARE STILL UH INVESTIGATING FOR THE VIDEO FORMATS 
BECAUSE UM I IT'S NOT SUPPORTED FOR INSTANCE UH UH IN JAVA IN JAVA APPLICATIONS UH ETCETERA 
REAL MEDIA 
YEAH 
REAL MEDIA SO THERE ARE MANY ISSUES ABOUT THAT BUT YEAH 
IT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT WAS A SINGLE VIDEO STRUCTURING BUT IT'S UH OTHER LEVEL UH IT CAN UH IT'S QUITE UH IT'S RESEARCHED YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH LAST THING UH THIS IS A KIND OF UH X. M. L. THAT IS OUTPUTTED 
SO SO IT'S UH THE STRUCTURE IS SUCH AS UH V VIDEO SEGMENTATION WITH UH VIDEOS IN BEGIN AND THEN FOR EACH SHOT YOU HAVE AN I. D. WELL THIS IS THE TERMS FROM M. PEG SEVEN CONVENTION 
BUT ANYWAY 
SHOT BEGIN AND AND 
UH A SH THE SHOT KEY FRAME THAT IS THE MIDDLE HERE 
UH SUB SHOT 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
TWELVE FRAMES 
AND IN FACT THAT'S WHAT I OUTPUT IN UH IN THE YEAH I THINK YOU IN THE INTERFACE 
AND THERE IS ONLY ONE SUB SHOT BECAUSE UH W YEAH 
THERE WAS THERE WAS PROBLEMS WITH DETECTING THE SUB SHOTS ETCETERA 
BUT UH YEAH WELL 
YEAH I TR WELL UH NOT WITH THIS ONE BUT YEAH 
I TRIED TO CODE SOME STUFF UH IT BUT UH I'M NOT SO CONFIDENT IN THE WAY UH IT IS UH CODED 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT W YEAH EVEN WE SHOULD UH FOR INSTANCE FOR THE VIDEOS UH FOR THE SPECTRAL CLUSTERING FOR THE CLUSTERING 
HERE UH I STORE THE CONSECUTIVE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE HISTOGRAMS BUT WE COULD UH STORE THE MATRIX THAT'S YEAH 
AND THEN UH YEAH 
AND I THINK I THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE THINGS WITH UH SPECTRAL CLUSTERING 
BUT BUT THE UH WITH UM THERE IS ONE PARAMETER THAT IS VERY C WHA I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IS THE PARAMETER UH 
YEAH 
NO NO NO NO THE ON THE THE GAP TO FIND THE THE GOOD NUMBER OF CLUSTERS IS IS SENSITIVE UH 
YEAH ANYWAY 
IT'S IT'S A BIT LATER ON THE ON THE REPORT 
SO ANYTIMES YEAH I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TO TO HELP YOU WITH THAT 
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN WE CAN GO 
SO WE ARE HERE IT JUST MAKE THE POINT 
WELL MAKE THE POINT YEAH 
MAKE THE STATUS ABOUT THE SHOT DETECTION 
IT AS YOU HAVE APPLIED THE SHOT DETECTOR TO SOME OF THE CINETIS VIDEO OR AT LEAST ONE AND UH SO WE CAN BASICALLY MAYBE JUST COMMENT ON ON THIS 
MAYBE QUICKLY REMIND WHAT THE SHOT DETECTOR IS HOW THE SHOT DETECTOR IS WORKING BASICALLY 
UH WE MIGHT BE ABLE ANYWAY TO GIVE YOU SOME REFERENCE 
I MEAN YOUR REPORT IT'S IT SHOULD BE DESCRIBED THERE ARE YEAH YEAH 
YOU HAVE THE REPORT 
OKAY 
TO OLIVIER YEAH 
OH OKAY YES THE KAYAK WI I WAS NOT EVEN WITH THE OTHER ONE OKAY 
BY THE WAY I WAS UH GOING TO ASK SO I HAD SEEN THE VIDEO I YOU UH DID UM A DOWNSAMPLING OF THE VIDEO RIGHT 
I MEAN 
FOR UH BROWSING I MEAN 
OKAY YEAH 
SO THIS IS HIERARCHICAL NORMALLY AS YOU HAVE SCENES AND SHOTS BUT 
BECAUSE FOR INSTANCE WE COULD PROBABLY YOU KNOW 
LIKE GROUP ALL THE INITIAL ONES INTO ONE SCENE AND MAYBE AFTER WHEN THERE'S SOME THINGS INSIDE IT IS SHOULD BE ANOTHER SCENE SO 
WHICH ARE EXTRACTED I THINK UH 
DOWNSAMPLING 
YEAH 
YEAH THE QUALITY SO THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING THAT 
IT IT'S NOT THIS THAT YOU PROCESSED RIGHT 
OKAY OKAY 
SO HERE WE USE THAT WE THE SHOT AT EIGHTEENTH AND AFTER TWENTY TWOS AND AFTER AGAIN 
AND UH IF WE GO DOWN I MEAN MAYBE IN TERMS OF SHOT HERE WE CAN SEE THAT 
RIGHT I MEAN SO NOW WE SEE SHOT SEVEN I SUPPOSE YEAH 
OH YEAH OKAY SHOT NINE CURRENTLY SHOT TEN PROBABLY 
ELEVEN EURO TWELVE 
NO ELEVEN 
OR IN THIS IS TEN INDEED OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH THIS ONE IT'S ELEVEN TWELVE 
OR FOURTEEN SECONDS 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH IT'S INSIDE AND YEAH 
IT'S REALLY A DISSOLVE OR IS IT REALLY LIKE SO YOU HAVE THE FEELING THAT IT'S BOTH 
OKAY 
BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT STANDARD MAN MADE MOVIES BECAUSE I WOULD SAY MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLE COULDN DIDN'T DO ANY DISSOLVE 
YEAH I COULD SEE HERE I MEAN THAT IT WAS LIKE HORSE IT WAS ONLY ONE SINGLE ONE 
NO YEAH YEAH 
THIS IS THE ONE I I HAD SEEN YEAH 
BUT SO I SAID I MEAN UH WITH EVEN THE MOTION DETECTOR WHEN IT'S BLACK IT'S THERE IS NOT SO NO STRUCTURE 
SO YOU DON'T ESTI YEAH BUT YOU DON'T REALLY ESTIMATE MOTION 
WELL THERE IS NO STRUCTURE 
THERE IS NO TEXTURE IF YOU WANT TO SAY SO AND THIS IS THIS IS NOT SO GOOD FOR THE MOTION 
UH BUT FOR INSTANCE OF COURSE BETWEEN THE HORSE AND UH AND UM THE C THE C UH UH YEAH 
UH THE COWS YEAH MAYBE WE COULD HAVE DETECTED THINGS 
BUT IT'S NOT EVEN EASIER BECAUSE THE BACKGROUND IS QUITE SIMILAR AND UH IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT THAT SURE 
SO IT'S YEAH 
THE HISTOGRAM SO WE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH IT 
SO IT'S IT'S SCRAMBLED SO YOU CAN SCRAMBLE THE IMAGE AND YOU GET THE SAME HISTOGRAM 
SO THERE IS NO STRUCTURE INDEED EASE OF COURSE WHEN YOU LIKE THE HORSE AND THEN YOU CAN USE AS A COW THE COWS 
OF COURSE YOU HAVE A BLACK ON THE TOP AND UH YOU HAVE ALSO UH MAYBE EIGHTY PERCENT OF LIKE GREEN UH 
WHICH IS EVEN NOT GREEN THERE BUT UH UH GRASS 
YOU HAVE STONES AND UH SO EITHER OF COURSE ARE DIFFERENCES BECAUSE IN THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE HORSE BUT IT'S BLACK 
SO YOU HAVE MORE SKY WHICH IS BLACK ON THE RIGHT SO YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS 
SO IT'S A GLO IT'S GLOBAL IT'S A GLOBAL HISTOGRAM SO YEAH 
BUT IT'S WHEN FOR THIS I WOULD FOR THIS APPLICATION I COULD IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD WERE QUITE HIGH 
UH AND IT'S A THRESHOLD BUT STILL IT'S ADAPTIVE RIGHT IF I REMEMBER WELL YEAH 
SO 
BECAUSE OF COURSE IF YOU JUST COMPUTE THE YEAH 
IF YOU HAVE THE REPORT BECAUSE IF YOU COMPUTE THE UM DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO HISTOGRAMS I THINK THIS WAS BHATTACHARYA 
RIGHT 
SO NOW WE KNOW 
AND UH SO IF YOU TAKE UH THESE TWO WITH THE WITH THE BHATTACHARYA UH THEN OF COURSE YOU SHOULD JUST DO A THRESHOLD 
WHEN THERE IS MOTION YOU WILL USE A LOT OF THINGS CHANGING IS BY USING AN L. R. T. T. THRESHOLD 
IF YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A CONTINUOUS CHANGE OF THE D DISTANCE YOU DON'T DO A THRESHOLD 
IT'S ONLY IF YOU HAVE AN IDENTIFIED PEAK WHICH IS UM FIFTY PERCENT OR MAYBE UH TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN THE THE NEXT SECOND VALUE IN THE WINDOW 
THEN YOU SAY IT'S IT'S A SHOT 
RIGHT I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S CONTINUOUS FOR DISSOLVE YEAH 
BUT IN ANYWAY IT'S DIFFICULT I MEAN IN THE IN IN IN GENERAL 
BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE SOME DISSOLVE YOU COULD IMAGINE THEY ARE PART OF OF OF A SCENE AND UH SO 
BUT OF COURSE WHEN YOU HAVE CUTS YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE EASY TO DETECT RIGHT I MEAN LIKE SOMETHING YEAH 
SO UH YEAH SO WITH THE MOTION BASICALLY THE MOTION TRIED TO ESTIMATE WELL THE MOTION BETWEEN TWO FRAMES 
RIGHT OF MY IMAGE IS THERE BUT AFTER IT'S THERE AND IT LOOKS AT HOW MANY POINTS C ARE WELL MATCHED 
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT LIKE SOMEBODY SPEAKING AND SO AND SO BEFORE THE SH BEFORE THE SHOT YOU CAN SEE THAT USUALLY THERE ARE LIKE NINETY PERCENT OF THE POINTS AT LEAST 
RIGHT WHO HAVE SOME MOTION SO UH 
BUT THEN AFTER SUDDENLY IF YOU GO FROM ONE FRAME AND YOU TRY TO MATCH ALL THE POINTS HERE WITH LIKE A TRANSLATION 
PLUS THE ZOOM PLUS MAYBE SOME ROTATION 
YOU C YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING WELL RIGHT 
SO BASICALLY YOU WOULD USE THAT THE NUMBER OF POINTS MAYBE ONLY TEN PERCENT OF THE POINTS YOU CAN MATCH WELL SO IT'S EASY TO DETECT 
AND UH AFTER YOU CAN SEE THAT INDEED BECAUSE IT'S A LONG SHOT AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FLAT PLANE 
YOU CAN DO A VERY GOOD REGISTRATION THROUGH THE NUMBER OF POINTS 
IS VERY HIGH I MEAN THE NUMBER OF POINTS THAT ARE MATCHING 
UH AND HERE YOU BASICALLY HERE WITH A HISTOGRAM UH YOU CAN USE IT VERY FLAT 
BUT OF COURSE YOU SHOULD GO FROM THIS HISTOGRAM TO THIS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY GREEN 
YOU HAVE THIS BIG UH MEASURE WHICH IS HERE UH THE CHI TWO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS WHAT YOU IMPLEMENT IS USED IN THE NO IT'S 
IT'S BHATTACHARYA 
OKAY 
YEAH SO YEAH AND YOU HAVE MAYBE A AN IMAGE WITH A UM ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD I THINK 
YOU HAD SOMETHING LIKE THIS RIGHT 
JUST TO EXPLAIN UH HOW 
YEAH UH 
YEAH YOU SEE LIKE HERE 
ALPHA TIMES THE MAXIMUM OF THE OTHER ONES 
OF THE OTHER ONES 
SO THE OF COURSE IF IT'S YOU ARE NOT A MAXIMUM YOU ARE NOT GOING I INSIDE THE WINDOW YOU ARE NOT THE MAX 
ANYWAY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE TO BE ABOVE UH ALPHA TIMES THE MAX OF THE OTHERS RIGHT UH BECAUSE ALPHA IS LOW LOWER THAN ONE 
OH 
LIKE FOR INSTANCE YEAH 
LIKE FOR INSTANCE HERE I I SEE SIX BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WAS FOR BHATTACHARYA OR FOR UH CHI S CHI TWO 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
TWO POINT FOUR YEAH SO IT'S A BIT LESS BECAUSE THE AMPLITUDE AS MUCH SMALLER YEAH 
OH YEAH 
SO YOU CAN UH IT WAS NOT SO JUST I MEAN BECAUSE THE MOTION I MEAN IT WAS UH IN THE SHOT WE'VE SEEN 
F BECAUSE OF ESPECIALLY WITH CHI TWO SQUARE IT OR THE AMPLITUDE IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN WITH BHATTACHARYA RIGHT 
UH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT COULD GO TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND WHEN IT'S THERE IS NOTHING IT'S CAN BE ZERO 
WITH BHATTACHARYA IT'S BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE IS YOU HAVE NOT AS MUCH AMPLITUDE 
UM BUT UH STILL UH IN SOME OF THE V THESE VIDEOS FOR INSTANCE EVEN IF WE GON GO NOW IF WE WANT IT 
BUT NOW FOR THE KAYAK CASE I DON'T KNOW 
UH AT SOME POINT TARGETING TWO KAYAKS AND IT'S MOVING QUITE FAST TOWARDS TO OTHER PEOPLE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE IF IT WAS DETECTED AS A SHOT TRANSITION OR 
YEAH YEAH 
IT WAS IT IS A SHOT OKAY 
I WAS UH WONDERING YEAH YEAH MAYBE 
BUT HERE FOR INSTANCE YOU UNDERSTAND SO WE CAN SHOW THIS TOMORROW TO UH AT THE PEOPLE TO THE CI CINETIS MEETING I MEAN IT 
RIGHT 
YEAH OKAY YEAH WE NEED A CONNECTION THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH I CAN BRING MY LAPTOP IF NECESSARY YEAH YEAH 
I'LL I'LL BRING IT OKAY SO IT'S IT'S DONE 
WELL YEAH BUT NORMALLY THERE IS A A BURNING IF YOU C MAYBE YOU CAN PLAY THE SHOT OR 
IT'S STRANGE I MEAN MAYBE YOU PLAY YEAH IF YOU PLAY THE THE VIDEO WELL INSI AT THE BEGINNING I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING 
UH YOU DIDN'T GENERATE THE KEY THE REAL MEDIA 
OKAY 
WELL NO I MEAN HERE I CAN SEE THAT IT WAS IT WAS DETECTED AS A SINGLE SHOT 
OKAY 
I WAS BECAUSE HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MOTION UH HERE IS UH YOU KNOW UH SO UH DOING A ZOOM IN THE TWO KAYAKS HERE 
YEAH AND THEN HE'S DOING QUITE A FAST TRANSITION FROM THIS TO ANOTHER ONE 
AND I WAS WONDERING WHETHER SO IF YOU WILL THOUGH OF COURSE IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S MAINLY WATER 
SO MAYBE THE COLOUR IS INDEED UH QUITE BUT YOU KNOW AS A KAYAK IS ENTERING QUITE FAST I MEAN YOU CAN HAVE QUITE MAYBE GOOD DISTANCE 
BUT I SEE THAT IT SEEMS TO BE HOW MANY SHOTS DO YOU HAVE INDEED DE DE DETECTED 
SIX YEAH THE ONE IS UH MAYBE SO YOU DID IT WITH WITH WHAT BY THE WAY 
IT'S WITH THE IMAGES I GIVE YOU ARE OKAY 
UH TO REGENERATE AN I. V. I. FILE OKAY YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN INITIALLY I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE IS A A SHOT DETECTED 
OH OKAY SO THE OKAY SO THE HERE IS AN IMAGE NUMBER 
IN YOUR PROGRAMME 
OH OKAY OKAY YEAH 
OKAY OKAY SO THEN THIS 
SO BUT IT'S IN SECONDS OR IT'S 
OKAY 
OKAY YEAH OKAY OKAY SECONDS PLUS NUMBER 
OKAY SO BASICALLY WHAT HAS BEEN UH YEAH EXTRACTED IS YEAH THIS POINT RATHER THAN OKAY SO THIS IS NORMAL OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY LIKE TRANSITION SOMETHING THAT IS OKAY 
YEAH IT'S MOTION YEAH IT'S NOT A CAT 
YEAH BUT I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE IT COULD HAVE BEEN 
BUT IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S MAINLY WATER WHEN WE USE THINGS SO IT'S YEAH IT'S NOT SUCH A BIG UH BUT YEAH 
SOMETIMES I MEAN YOU CAN HAVE VARIOUS THINGS HAP I MEAN JUST THINK ABOUT MORE ACTION MOVIE AND THING LIKE THIS 
WELL SOMETIMES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SO FOCUS USUALLY THERE IS NO PROBLEM 
PEOPLE SAY THIS IS A CUT THIS IS NOT A CAT BUT LIKE FOR DISSOLVE EVEN SOMETIMES 
YOU KNOW 
PEOPLE MAY IT'S PEOPLE MAY HAVE SOME TROUBLE I MEAN THIS IS A DISSOLVE THIS IS NOT THIS SHOULD THIS SHOULD BE LABELLED AS A TRANSITION OR NOT 
SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY YEAH BUT IT'S PART OF THE THING OR UH FOR INSTANCE IN LIKE IN UM ALSO IN UH 
COME ON UH ADVERTISING USUALLY 
BECAUSE THE SHOTS ARE VERY SHORT IN ADVERTISING USUALLY IT'S UH VERY FAST AND SO SOMETIMES 
YEAH WHEN YOU HAVE AN INCRUSTATION LIKE LAST TIME WHAT WHAT SHOULD YOU SAY IT'S IT'S YEAH IT'S A CHANGE OF 
BUT UH 
YEAH I MEAN IT'S A S SOMETIMES VERY DIFFICULT 
A AT LEAST WHAT I CAN SEE THAT CURRENTLY LIKE FOR CINETIS UH FOR INSTANCE IF IT'S TO DO COLOUR CORRECTION OR FOR INSTANCE IF IT'S TOO BLACK 
IT A BIT WHITER I THINK THIS TYPE OF THINGS SHOULD BE FINE 
BECAUSE BASICALLY IT'S EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT REAL SHOTS THEY ARE NOT SO INTERESTED IF IT'S NOT REAL SHOT 
MAYBE AFTER THEY HAVE THIS AND THEY MAY SAY OKAY JUST BY LOOKING AT LEAST THE SUMMARY 
SO MAYBE FOR THE SUMMARY WE COULD DO BETTER UH KEY FRAME EXTRACTION FOR INSTANCE 
BUT BY JUST LOOKING AT THE KEY FRAMES AND SO NO THEY MAY SAY OKAY 
FROM THIS SHOT AT THIS SHOT WE APPLY LIKE UH SPECIFIC UM COLOUR ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM OR RESTORATION ALGORITHM OR UH TO IMPROVE UH THE BRIGHTNESS AND SOMETHING LIKE THIS RIGHT 
AND UH SO I THINK FOR THEM THIS IS FINE UM AFTER I YEAH 
WELL MAYBE AFTER I MEAN THEY WOULD SH OKAY UH THEY WOULD GO DIRECTLY AND SAY SELECT THE SHOTS FROM HERE IT HERE 
AND THEY WOULD SAY YOU APPLY THIS ALGORITHM YEAH 
SO OF COURSE WE COULD TRY TO MAKE SCENE CLUSTERING AND SO NO BUT I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT THIS IS NECESSARY FOR THEM AT THIS POINT 
BECAUSE UH IF THEY HAVE A SIX MINUTE MOVIE IF THEY HAVE THIRTY SHOTS 
FOR THEM IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO LOOK AT FROM HERE IT HERE I APPLY THIS AND THEY CAN DO IT QUITE QUICKLY 
AND THEY HAVE TO DO IT ON TO DO IT ANYWAY 
BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME MIGHT BE UH TO SELECT THE TYPE OF RESTORATION ALGORITHM OR THE TYPE OF THINGS 
SO THIS MIGHT TAKE MORE TIME THAN HAVING TO CLICK TWO TIMES IN TWO SHOTS RATHER TH TH THEN UH HAVING DIRECTLY A SCENE RIGHT 
SO SO I THINK FOR THEM UH THIS TYPE OF THINGS IS GOING TO BE USEFUL UH AT LEAST FOR THIS TASK 
IF THEY WANT TO DO STABILISATION IT MAY NOT BE EASIER IF THAT 
UH THIS IS THE RIGHT SEGMENTATION FOR SOME OF THIS BUT IS ABOUT THIS IS ANOTHER POINT WHICH FOR MOTION STABILISATION 
SO I SAID SEVERAL TIME WE ARE NOT WE DID NOT COMMIT TO PROVIDE ANYTHING 
BUT OF COURSE IF WE CAN PROVIDE THINGS WE'LL DO IT BUT UH YEAH 
SO DO YOU HAVE UH MORE QUESTION OR UH DO YOU HAVE A 
WELL I JUST I I I IT'S I THINK THIS IS 
YEAH BUT AFTER I MEAN IT MAY BE MORE LIKE A GUY UM I NOT I IN AN INTERFACE A GUY INTERFACE 
I MEAN WHERE I MEAN IF SECOND SELECT FROM SHOT ONE TO SEVEN 
UH THIS IS A SAME SEG THEY MAY DO THE GROUPING BY THEMSELVES QUITE BY LOOKING AT THIS IT MAY TAKE W W LESS IN ONE MINUTES 
AND I THINK IT'S ANYWAY IF IT'S TOO SUMMARISED AFTER THEY MAY WANT TO GO INSIDE UH IT IS WHETHER THERE IS NOT SPECIAL THINGS I MEAN SO 
UH BECAUSE AFTER IT DEPENDS I MEAN IF YOU GIVE ONLY ONE KEY FRAME PER SHOT AFTER I MEAN IT'S ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY IMAGES 
IT'S QUITE FAST RIGHT AND SO I THINK AND THE HIERARCHICAL THING IS GOOD 
BECAUSE STILL YOU CAN CHECK IF YOU HAVE SOME AMBIGUITIES YOU ARE NOT SURE YOU COULD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AT LEAST YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
WELL ULTIM ULTIMATELY I THINK THIS IS THE TYPE OF THINGS BUT AT THIS POINT WE UH YEAH 
I I HOPE UH THAT UH IF IT'S A BIG SUCCESS UH THEY WILL ASK IDIAP TO TO PROVIDE SOMETHING LIKE THIS OF COURSE WITH SOME MONEY OR AT LEAST TO PAY A STUDENT OR SOMEBODY FOR DOING IT 
BUT UH YEAH 
OF COURSE THIS WAS ULTIMATELY I THINK ONE WAY OF UH IF YOU COULD PROVIDE LIKE CHAPTERS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
INDEED YOU COULD PROVIDE LIKE THE U. V. I. AT THE CLIENTS 
AND UH MAY ASK FOR SPECIAL SERVICES OR UH AND EVEN IT JUST TO WATCH THE MOVE TO HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO DIFFERENT PARTS AND SO NO 
BUT IT'S UH I MEAN UH THIS LABELLING MIGHT BE MORE EASY TO DO FOR THE CLIENT BY THE CLIENT 
BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE I MEAN UH WE WANTS TO HAVE THIS AND THIS AND UH RIGHT SO 
YEAH YEAH HE MAY WANT TO ORGANI YEAH YEAH 
OTHERWISE I MEAN THIS BIT OF BIT OF COURSE IT MIGHT BE EASY TO DO A VERY SIMPLE SOFTWARE 
WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE USER TO SELECT JUST THE SHOTS AND GIVE NAMES 
AND AFTER IT WOULD GENERATE AUTOMATICALLY SOME INDEX AND UH AS A I SUPPOSE THE CLIENT MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SUCH A SUCH A THINGS IF HE COULD UH GENERATE AUTOMATICALLY IN THE D. V. D. 
BUT FOR AND YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT BEFORE SENDING IN THE D. V. D. 
YOU COULD ALLOW HIM TO L TO WATCH THIS TYPE OF INTERFACE AND UH WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SELECTION 
SAY THIS IS THIS THIS IS THIS THIS IS THIS THIS IS THIS AND WHEN HE WOULD RECEIVE THE D. V. D. 
UH WOULD INDEED UH GET ALREADY THE CHAPTERS THAT HE DECIDED TO PUT THERE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
AND I THINK THIS MAY IT IT'S GOOD THAT THIS IS A DEMO LIKE THIS 
BECAUSE I'M SURE THAT THEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED INDEED BECAUSE I IMAGINE THAT SOME PEOPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OH YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS UH THIS IS A VERY GOOD UH AND A YEAH 
BUT UH 
SO THIS IS A KIND OF SERVICE I DON'T KNOW THERE THEY GIVE IT FOR FOR AND UH 
BUT UH 
BUT YOU SEE THAT SOMETIMES EVEN HERE IT'S A BIT LIKE UH IT'S FOR INSTANCE IF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LIKE SOME MOTION COMPENSATION 
UH Y I IT COULD BE PROPOSED 
BUT FOR INSTANCE HERE IT I W IT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC TO HAVE MOTION 
SO I HERE IT'S FINE TO DO MOTION COMPENSATION BUT STABILISATION RATHER THAN YEAH 
BUT 
FOR INSTANCE HERE IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S 
EFFECTS 
OKAY 
OH OKAY SO MAYBE LIKE HERE FOR INSTANCE IT IS A JUST REPRODUCED TWO TIMES UH 
YEAH 
SO THIS IS VI OKAY 
THIS VIDEO IS ABOUT FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES RIGHT 
OH OKAY SO THIS IS NOT THE ON THAT HAS BEEN UH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
IT'S IT'S IT'S REAL TIME RIGHT 
I MEAN THE PROCESSING 
YEAH 
A BIT MORE THAN REAL TIME 
WELL ANYWAY YEAH 
YEAH NORMALLY IT COULD IT COULD GO FASTER 
BUT I PROBABLY IT'S PROBABLE THAT EVEN FOR THE PROJECT YOU WOULD DO SOME OF THE REPROGRAMMING 
I MEAN IT ESPECIALLY IF UH WE NEED TO INTERFACE NEW UH UM YEAH OR FOR JUST READING 
I MEAN THE THE D. V. X. AND THING LIKE THIS IS IT'S UH UH SO TOMOR ANYWAY FOR THIS WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY YET 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SURE WHAT THEY WANT TO WHAT THE USER'S TOOLS FOR READING D. V. D. AND SO ONE IS 
AND SO BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS IS IS DIFFICULT NOW YOU HAVE UM ALREADY LOOKED AT THE HISTOGRAMS AND OPEN C. V. COMPUTING DISTANCES AND SO NO 
SO IF WE WANT TO DO A SPECIAL THING THAT PROBABLY RUNS FAST IT MAY BE EASIER TO DO IT DIRECTLY AND UH YEAH 
BUT UH BUT YEAH THE INTERFACE IS VERY IS THE INTERFACE USES THE OUTPUT OF YOUR PROGRAMME 
ESSENTIALLY OKAY 
OKAY 
MM 
YOU CAN DO THE GET FRAME 
BUT OTHERWISE IT'S NOT NECESSARY 
OH YEAH NO NO NO 
YE OKAY 
OH NO NO YOU AND YOU NEED TO GENERATE THESE IMAGES RIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY YEAH 
YEAH 
IS A DIRECTORY YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
X. M. L. YEAH 
IN THE SHOT 
AND IT'S A SIMPLE FORMAT I SUPPOSE LIKE UH LIKE YOU HAVE SCENES AND SHOTS AND UH OKAY SO SOME TIME STAMPS 
YEAH 
SO BUT YOU'RE YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN IT IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO 
AND WHO HAS A RIGHT TO PUT WHO HAS A RIGHT TO PUT DATA ON THE M. M. M. 
OKAY 
OKAY YEAH 
YES 
OH OKAY YEAH 
YEAH IF YOU 
IF YOU HAVE THE SAME UH DECOMPOSITION RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT IT MAY HAPPEN THAT UH FOR NINETY FRA NINETY PERCENT OF THE FRAME IT'S DIFFERENT 
SO YOU USE IT FINE BUT SUDDENLY YOU HAVE ONE OTHER FRAME THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS AND WHERE IT COMES FROM 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
UH YOU MEAN BAC BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IT'S THE M. M. M. CACHE 
OKAY 
SO THIS MEANS THAT WHEN IT'S DONE IF I GO ON MY COMPUTER AND I DO THE SAME IT'S NOT GOING TO ENTER IN MY COACH 
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE ALREADY THERE IN M. M. M. OKAY 
SO IT'S THE IT'S SO IT'S NOT DONE IN IT'S SO IT'S NOT DONE ONLINE 
THE FIRST TIME YEAH BUT AFTER IT'S TO TAKE OKAY 
OKAY OKAY 
I THOUGHT IT WAS EVERYTHING WAS GENERATED ON THE FLY TH SO 
OKAY 
OKAY YEAH 
OKAY SO 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SO COULD YOU SAY UH VIDEO NAME CINETIS SLASH SOMETHING 
OR NOT 
YOU THE OKAY 
YOU THINK IT WOULD WORK OKAY 
HMM 
MM EVEN IF YOU WOULD R CHANGE A C. G. I. FOR INSTANCE 
LET'S ASSUME THAT WE SAY WE DON'T DO ANY SCENE THING THEN WE COULD REMOVE LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE SCENES RIGHT 
I WAS THINKING THAT HERE IT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE ONLINE VIDEO STRUCTURE CORRECTION 
UH WHICH MEANS THAT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OH 
THIS IS WISH WISHABLE UH FUNCTIONS 
OKAY TO DO THIS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
NO I WAS THINKING 
NO BECAUSE I WAS THINKING IF IT'S THERE I MEAN WE COULD USE IT UH UH WE COULD UH YOU SEE BUT UH YEAH 
NO NO 
FOR FROM OUTSIDE WE CAN VIEW THEM 
YEAH FROM HIM I WAS ABLE TO ACCESS THEM 
NO 
OKAY 
NOBODY ACTUALLY IT HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED SEVERAL TIMES AND PEOPLE THERE ARE SOME LAWYERS THAT ARE PUTTING IN 
BUT YEAH 
YOU 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH NO NO YEAH 
NO 
BUT YEAH IT'S GOOD TO 
YEAH IF WE I YEAH 
IT MIGHT BE GOOD INDEED IF WE START D BUILDING SOME EXPERIMENTS LIKE THIS STILL TO HAVE A PASSWORD 
RIGHT YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH YEAH WHAT'S YEAH YEAH 
YEAH IT WAS DONE INDEED F TO BE MORE GENERAL THAN JUST TO DO THE SHOT DETECTION 
SO THAT'S WHY THE CODE IS A BIT MORE COMPLEX I THINK CURRENTLY 
UH BUT UH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
JUST 
YEAH 
OH OKAY YEAH YEAH 
YEAH IT WAS THE SAME THE SAME ONES IS THE ONE YOU SAW UH IN MY CODE YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY YEAH 
YEAH OH OKAY 
YEAH I THINK IT'S IT'S GOOD YEAH 
OKAY THAT'S GOOD YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WHY IS AFTER I MEAN IF THERE IS A SHOT YOU DON'T KNOW BETWEEN BECAUSE YOU DROPPED ONE FRAME 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IS THE SH UH THE DO THE SHOT 
SLIDING WINDOW 
YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW I'M I'M SURE THAT THEY WILL BE WELL I HOPE THEY WILL BE A F SOMETHING LIKE THIS YEAH 
THE OUTPUT 
YEAH 
THIS GENERATES YEAH 
UH HOW DO YOU GENERATE THE REAL MEDIA YEAH 
OKAY 
UH O O OH YEAH YOU MEAN THE JAVA FRAMEWORK UH WHAT UH MIKE PRESENTED 
WE CANNOT PLAY UH REAL MEDIA OKAY 
OKAY 
FORMATS FORMATS YEAH 
OKAY SO I THINK THIS WAS GOOD TO USE THE THE TOOL AND UH TOMORROW WE ARE GOING TO RE SAY MOST OF THE THINGS 
BUT SHORTER I IF I BELIEVE RIGHT I MEAN IT'S BAD TO EXPLAIN 
AND I THINK MAYBE LATER W YEAH WE WE CAN START DOING SIMPLE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH THE FULL UH 
YEAH UM THIS MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO SEE TOMORROW 
OF COURSE MAYBE THERE WAS THE UH ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SHOTS OR IT'S A LOT 
BUT UH AFTER I MEAN AT THIS POINT WE DO WE HAVE NOTHING WE CAN DO UNLESS THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH IT RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK I THINK SO IT'S IT IT'S GOING VERY BE VERY TO BE VERY GOOD FOR THEM TO VISUALISE HOW YOU CAN ORGANISE THINGS AND MAYBE WHAT THEY CAN DO 
HOW THEY NEED IS THIS IS IMPORTANT 
MM-HMM YEAH 
YEAH INITIALLY YEAH 
WELL WE DIDN'T BECAUSE YOU TRIED TO DO SOMETHING 
OKAY 
YEAH LIKE FOR INSTANCE IF WE NEED TO FIND SUB SHOTS 
USUALLY IT IT FOR INSTANCE IS BETTER TO HAVE THE WHOLE SHOT TO DECIDE ON HOW TO BUILD THE SUB SHOTS 
BUT IT'S TRUE THAT MAYBE I IF YOU STORE ALL THE DISTANCE AT THAT THE DISTANCES WE COULD DO SOME BASIC STUFF 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S THE THING YEAH 
UH THE THE GAP YOU MEAN OR NO 
OH NO YOU MEAN IN THE BHATTACHARYA DISTANCE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO 
IT'S OKAY

NO 
UH I HAVE LOOK AT THE DEMO FILM AND IT'S ABOUT UH 
FORTY MINUTES AND BUT UH 
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS SO IT'S YEAH 
YES 
AND UH I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A REAL SAMPLE D. V. D. 
BECAUSE UH THIS WILL MAKE BUT UH FIVE SECONDS FOR EACH SHOT SO I THINK IT'S VERY SHORT 
NO 
I IF THIS IS IT OR AT IT TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THE COLOUR LIGHT AND UH THEY HAVE A LOT OF UH SHOTS 
HMM 
YEAH OKAY 
OH OKAY

YES 
SORRY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH UH I THINK I THINK THEY MADE SOME UH SPECIAL EFFECT ON THIS D. V. D. 
OH THERE IS TWO OR THREE TIME UH YOU SEE YOU USE THE SAME UH SOME KIND OF UH SCENE UH JUST UH TWO OR THREE SECONDS 
YEAH 
HMM 
NO THERE'S NO MENU 
THERE IS JUST AN UH ONE CHAPTER AND ONE MENU 
YEAH YES 
YES 
OH 
UH I THINK IN THE VIDEO THERE'S TWO THERE'S TWO VIDEO ONE IS A REAL VIDEO AND THE OTHER IS A JUST UH INTRODUCTION WHEN YOU HAVE THE MENU 
NO IT'S UH THIRTEEN MINUTES 
NO BUT YES THIS IS THE SAME BUT UH THERE WAS A PROBLEM WHEN DO THE GRAB FROM THE D. V. D. AT THE FILES 
SO THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE MAKE TWO TWO FILES 
BUT NOW I HAVE ONE FILE ALSO IN THE SO YOU CAN PROCESS AGAIN IN TIME 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM

BUT IN THE ON THE ON THE SERVER THE ORIGINAL IS A F VIDEO FILM 
OKAY 
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN CHANGE YOU CAN CHANGE A NUMBER TO TAKE WHICH ONE OKAY 
OKAY UNDERSTAND 
IN THE OTHER YEAH YEAH 
OKAY PERFECT 
NO THIS ONE OKAY 
YEAH I THINK IT'S NOT WELL DONE YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
BUT UM 
YEAH 
OKAY OKAY THERE IS LI LOCAL CACHE 
OKAY OKAY 
OKAY OKAY 
OKAY 
SO IF WE FOR EXAMPLE NOW WE HAVE THE C THE THE CASE THAT THIS VIDEO IS NOT CORRECT BECAUSE UH I HAVE MAKE UH EVENT GRABBING 
SO UH WE NEED TO REMOVE THE COUCH FOR THIS VIDEO OR THIS IS AUTOMATIC 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WHAT I MEAN SO I I I I I IF I IF I PUT THE SAME VIDEO WITH THE SAME NAME INSTEAD OF THIS ONE 
THEY SHOULD UH DIFFERENT 
OH OKAY 
WE NEED TO REMOVE THEM 
YEAH OKAY

BUT IT'S FAST 
OKAY 
YEAH UNDERSTAND 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UH I JU JUST UH A QUESTION ON THE THE ORGANISATION OF THE M. M. M. 
SO YOU DON'T HAVE UH A PART FOR SPECIFIC UH PROJECT 
VERY FOR EXAMPLE IF WE MAKE A LOT OF UH FILM UH FOR CINETIS UH ALL ARE IN THE TOP 
I MEAN UH ALL THE FILM ARE YOU YOU YOU DON'T HAVE A SEPARATION FOR THE FILM FOR CINETIS OR FOR THE PROJECT AND SO 
WELL YOU SAY VIDEO NAME EQUAL ALL ARE IN THE SAME LEVEL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
TO MAKE 
OKAY 
IF WE NEED TO MAKE SOME SPECIAL THING IN THE BROWSER IT'S TOO 
OKAY 
YEAH OKAY IT'S OKAY 
OKAY GREAT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WORK IN PROGRESS 
YEAH 
INPUT 
NO 
YEAH UH 
MM 
YEAH MAINLY THE T WEBPAGE OR FOR OUTPUT

HMM 
YES 
YES 
YES 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH THE THE BROWSER 
HMM 
HMM 
YES 
YES 
UH IS JUST UH LAST QUESTION MAYBE UH SO THIS MAKES A X. M. L. FILE 
OKAY 
THIS IS THE THE PROGRAMME IT TO GENERATING THE X. M. L. FILE AND THE THE SHOT 
AND UH WITH THE KAYAK YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS YOU DON'T HAVE THE REAL MEDIA SO THIS IS ANOTHER THING 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO YOU HAVE SOME SPECIAL TOOLS FROM UH FROM REAL MEDIA 
OKAY 
HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
HMM 
HMM OKAY OKAY 
OKAY I HEARD IT 
OKAY 
BUT UH ANYWAY YOU AND YOU NEED TO HAVE WINDOWS TO MAKE THIS 
SO I WILL ASK YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE OKAY 
OKAY OKAY UNDERSTAND 
OKAY 
BUT THIS IS THIS IS MADE BY A PROGRAMME DONE OUTSIDE IDIAP 
OKAY 
THIS IS YES RIGHT OKAY 
THIS INTO UH IDIAP PROGRAMME 
OKAY OKAY 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 
UM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
OKAY 
YES 
I THINK FOR TEST I CAN TAKE THE REAL DEMO AND MAKE THE THE FULL PROCESSING 
SO I WILL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
HMM 
OKAY 
MM OKAY 
I HAVE SOME INFORMATIONS 
OKAY 
AND UH IN THIS IN THIS THE BEGIN AND AND THE NUMBER IS THE FOR EXAMPLE THE END IS ZERO DOT TWELVE TWELVE IS UH THIS FROM IT YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WHAT WHAT 
OKAY 
OH 
OKAY 
MM 
JUST WHAT WHAT 
HMM 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
IT'S OKAY 
NO 
YEP 
UH YOU CAN BE SITTING HERE ITSELF AND DO THE PRESENTATION 
NOW YOU NEED THE DIFFERENT METHOD FROM HOW FROM GAMMAS YOU CAN GENERATE THE POSTERIORS 
OKAY 
UH I WAS JUST UM LET'S TALK ABOUT LITTLE BIT THIS PRESENTATION ITSELF THE SLIDE NUMBER SIX 
OKAY HOW YOU FEEL IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE TAKING THE CONTEXT OF THE WHOLE UTTERANCE 
HOW IMPORTANT IT COULD BE 
SO IT INTO A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU'RE HAVING LESS CONTEXT 
INSTEAD OF HAVING CONTEXT FROM ONE TO CAPITAL D. WHICH IS FOR THE WHOLE UTTERANCE WHICH DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE IN GENERAL 
SO WHAT IS A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU CAN CUT THE CONTEXT INSTEAD OF HAVING THE CONTEXT FROM 
THAT'S RIGHT 
MIGHT BE LEFT OR RIGHT EVERYTHING THERE BUT NOT THE WHOLE CONTEXT 
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A FACT THAT WHEN YOU ARE HAVING AN UTTERANCE 
SO IT IN UTTERANCES LINK UP FULL SENTENCE OR SOMETHING AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE MUCH BREAKS IN IT 
SO ON THAT SENSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT YOU ARE GOING TOO MUCH ON THE PAST AND THEN YOU ARE TRYING TO COMPUTE SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT RELATED 
MM-HMM 
KIND OF LET'S SAY DO IS USUALLY HUNDRED MILLISECONDS OR ONE SECOND 
YEAH NUMBERS IT MIGHT BE OKAY BECAUSE MOST OF THE SENTENCES MIGHT BE THREE SECONDS OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
THAT UM THAT MATCH OF CONTEXT TO COMPUTER COMMAS 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEM THEN MY STORY THEY ARE THE WORST I THINK 
YEAH 
I CANNOT GENERATE POSTERIORS 
SO THERE IS 
I DON'T HAVE THE C. FILES ALSO PRESENTLY WITH UM 
YEAH 
NO 
MY SAID THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 
YEAH AND THEN I THIN I WOULD HAVE TAKEN TWO YEARS EXTENSION 
YEAH IT WAS IT WAS PRETTY SCARY BUT LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
ICSI MM-HMM 
BECAUSE EVEN UM PETR HAS LOST A LOT 
HE'S HAVING ONLY THE RESULTS WITH HIM 
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE FILES THE REAL THE ROLE IS ONES 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE EVEN TO DOWNLOAD THAT MUCH OF DATA 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GET THE L. P. P. L. P. FEATURES AND 
OKAY 
BECAUSE THO THOSE FILES ARE ALSO VERY BIG THEY ARE NOT SINGLE FILES 
SO THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY BREAK 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH P. L. P. NUMBERS NINETY FIVE DATABASE SO THERE FINE 
YEAH 
EVERYTHING IS LOST 
AND UH IF IF YOU REALLY ASK ME EVEN THE STRUCTURE WHICH WAS THERE REAL EVERY POINT BY POINT HOW P. L. P. S WELL GENERATED 
THAT INFORMATION IS ALSO NOT THERE 
YEAH BUT THE PARAMETERS WHICH ARE EXACT 
HOPEFULLY NINETY FIVE PERCENT I KNOW ABOUT THAT FIVE PERCENT 
AND THEN WE WE NEED TO TURN THE NEW RATES BECAUSE M. L. P. TRAINING NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THEN ONLY THE NEXT STEP WILL HAPPEN 
SO IT'S IT'S PRETTY PRETTY HOL HOLDING S STUPID 
WHETHER WE CAN REPLICATE THE RESULTS WHATEVER RESULTS YOU ARE SHOWING WHETHER WE CAN REPLICATE THEM OR NOT 
PRESENTLY IT'S IT'S NOT KNOWN 
YEAH 
YOU 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO NO NO NO HE IS USING DIFFERENT SETUP I THINK 
HE DOESN'T USE OUR SETUP 
DO YOU USE OUR SETUP FOR THE NUMBER OF STATES 
FOR THE GAMMA ESTIMATION 
OKAY MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO NO THESE THINGS I'M ALSO HAVING BECAUSE THEY WERE DONE TWO YEARS BACK 
ANYTHING WHICH IS DONE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IS THE ONE WHICH IS 
NOTHING 
TH THERE'S ALSO IN COM COM DATABASE YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
IN THE THESE THINGS ARE NOT DISTURBED 
NOTHING RELATED TO THE DATABASE HAS BEEN DISTURBED 
EXCEPT THE SWITCHBOARD 
NO THEY'RE THERE 
NO NO IT WAS IT WAS PRE WRITTEN THERE 
IT'S IN THE DATABASE ITSELF 
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
YEAH SO IT THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM 
NO I DIDN'T DO IT MYSELF 
NO NO NO 
MEANS TO L YEAH THAT PART IS LESS UH SCARY 
YEAH 
SO THE THINGS WHICH ARE RELATED TO YOUR P. L. P. CAN BE DONE I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT SUCH A MAJOR PROBLEM 
SO YOU THE M. L. P. NEEDS TO BE TRAINED AND UH P. L. P. FEATURES 
SO IT'S KIND OF ONE AND A HALF DAYS WORK KIND OF TO GENERATE THE NEW FILES 
YEAH THAT WILL AGA MEANS IT'LL LIGHT UP THAT'S IT 
BUT ALL ALL OF IT IS DOABLE IN THREE FOUR DAYS TIME 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
AND IF I DON'T HAVE TO GENERATE ANY NEW RESULTS I'M ALSO IN THE OTHER SIDE THEN 
BUT IF I NEED TO GENERATE NEW RESULTS THEN AND ANYWAY THERE IS EMOTIONAL LOSS SO SCRIPTS AND CODE EVERYTHING WRITTEN THAT IS 
NO 
YEAH YEAH 
BECAUSE IT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MEANS LOSSES ARE EMOTIONAL AS WELL SO WHATEVER IT IS THERE 
AND BLA BLA BUT IT'S TRAGEDY 
SO 
SO RAID FIVE YOU HAVE TOLD TO THE 
MM-HMM 
NO ONE DISK THERE IS NO PROBLEM 
MM-HMM OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
WAS IT INSURED ANY IDEA 
NO NO INSURANCE CAN TAKE CARE OF UH MEANS ANYTHING CAN BE INSURED IN THIS WORLD NOWADAYS 
MM-HMM 
BUT IT STILL MINUS ONE THING WHICH IS A MYSTERY TO ME WHE WHY TEMP ONE AND TEMP TWO WERE RESIDING ON THE SAME HARD DISK PHYSICAL 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
YEAH SO IT MEANS 
SO THAT 
MM-HMM 
NO NO NO WHAT I'M SAYING MEANS TEMP ONE AND TEMP TWO COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS ALTOGETHER 
I'M SAYING THEY COULD HAVE KEPT DIFFERENTLY 
NO RAID ON BOTH THEY SYSTEMS WAS THE PROBLEM 
HARD DISK THERE THERE WERE ALREADY FIVE HARD DISKS RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE SCARED OF TEMPS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO NO NO NO NO 
NO NO NO 
I CHECKED OVER THE NOT IT'S NOT THE WAY 
YOU DO YOU SEND THE THINGS TO THEM THEY WILL SEE IF THEY CAN RECOVER 
THEN ONLY THEY'LL ASK YOU THAT THIS IS THE QUOTATION 
BUT IF THERE IS NO NO IF THEY CANNOT RECOVER THEY THEY WILL SEND IT BACK 
MM-HMM 
NO NO NO FIRST THEY'LL GIVE YOU A QUOTATION 
TH THEY WON'T GO WE UH WITHOUT THAT 
IT'S NOT MEANS IT'S A WRONG INFORMATION 
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING WHAT THEY SAY THAT SOUND IS THE THING WE'LL LOOK AT THE THINGS 
IF IT IS RECOVERABLE WE WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS THE QUOTATION AND IF IT IS NOT RECOVERABLE WE WILL SEND IT BACK TO YOU 
BUT MEANS OF AND UH I IF THEY THEY CANNOT RECOVER IT THEN THEN WHAT THEY WILL THEY WON'T CHARGE ANYTHING FROM YOU FOR THE INSPECTION 
BUT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
MEANS LOOKING AT UH HOW MUCH FAILURE HAS HAPPENED 
ACCORDINGLY THEY WILL TELL YOU WHETHER THEY CAN RECOVER OR NOT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO HOW MUCH SO FOUR TERA FOUR THOUSAND GIGABYTES 
OKAY 
NOT MUCH 
SO IT RAID ONE HAS MORE COMPARED TO RAID FIVE 
NO RAID ONE IS HAVING EXACTLY F FIFTY PERCENT CAPACITY IS UTILISED 
IT'S COPY 
TWO COPIES OF THE SAME THING WILL BE EXISTING 
THAT IS A RAID ONE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
RAID FIVE IS TWENTY PERCENT 
NO 
SO RAID ONE IS EXACTLY IT'S MEANS THAT'S LOT OF WASTAGE OF RESOURCES BUT IT'S MORE TOLERANT 
AND THERE IS ONE KIND OF OR ANYTHING NOTHING EXISTS THERE 
SO THE DISK WHICH HAS CRASHED THAT CANNOT BE RECOVERED 
THAT UH DISK WHICH HAS NOT CRASHED IT CAN BE RECOVERED COMPLETELY 
MEANS OF BOTH THE DISK HAVE CRASHED FOR THE SAME DATA YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANYTHING 
IF ONE DISK HAS CRASHED CRASHED THEN YOU CAN RECOVER EVERYTHING 
YEAH IT'LL BE IN THE OTHER DISK 
SO THAT IS RAID ONE 
IF YOU ARE GIVEN A CHOICE YOU WANT TO TAKE RAID ONE OR RAID FIVE OR A SIMPLE LAPTOP 
MM-HMM 
IT WHAT ARE THE EXPERIMENTS YOU NEED TO DO 
WHAT ARE THE NEW EXPERIMENTS YOU ARE HAVING IN YOUR MIND 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BUT DO YOU FEEL THAT IS PAPER MATERIAL 
BUT THE ONE WHICH YOU HAVE REPORTED MEANS YOU WANT TO REPORT SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT 
OH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO MIGHT BE WHAT I CAN DO I CAN GIVE YOU THE SETUP AND YOU CAN YOU CAN GENERATE FROM BOTTOM TRAIN M. L. P. TEST M. L. P. 
MM I WAS USING THIRTY NINE YES 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
SO WHAT IS THIS RESULT 
THIS IS RELATED TO YOUR UM M. L. M. A. 
OH OKAY MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WHAT IS A TRIPHONE GAMMAS 
OH OKAY 
YOUR YOUR M. L. P. 
OKAY 
BUT THOSE GAMMAS WILL BE SOME IS UH S NORMALISED SCALE LIKELIHOODS RIGHT 
THEN THE THEY'RE THROUGH THAT DATA UH FROM THROUGH 
OKAY 
UH NOT UH SCALE LIKELIHOODS 
POSTERIORS 
FROM 
G. M. M. UH M. L. P. SCALE LIKELIHOODS 
YOU'RE YOU ARE HAVING POSTERIORS THERE RIGHT 
YOU DIVIDED BY THE 
OKAY 
OKAY SO IT'S SCALE LIKELIHOODS 
OKAY 
AND FULL NETWORK WHAT WAS THE R CH ARCHITECTURE 
OH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DISCUSS 
ONE DAY AFTER THE CRASH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S ALL BE BECAUSE IF YOU 
YOU COME ON WRONG DAY FROM IRAN 
YOU SHOULD HAD COME ON IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY 
ANYWAY 
UH THEY'LL GET A SHOCK OF THEIR LIFE 
MIGHT BE THE ONE KIND OF LIKE IF THEY HAVE READ THEIR MAILS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH EVERYTHING IS LOST YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT IT'S A MAJOR LOSS NO DOUBT 
THE DATA IN WHICH WE WANT TO RUN THE SCRIPTS IS NOT THERE 
IF THEY CAN YEAH IF THEY CAN GIVE ME MY C. FILES THEN ALSO IT'S OKAY 
YEAH BECAUSE I DON'T NEED TO GENERATE FEATURES ALSO YEAH 
YEAH IT'S AMAZING 
I NO I DON'T NEED ALL MY P. FILES JUST EITHER OF THEM 
YEAH 
NOWADAYS IT'S NOT THE CASE 
THEY PHYSICALLY ALSO SEPARATE THE THINGS 
OR IT'S SPRINKLERS 
THEN WHAT IF THEIR SPRINKLERS DON'T WORK 
OH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
THEY WON'T KEEP IT IT IN PLACE YEAH 
PHYSICALLY AT DIFFERENT PLACES YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
C. D. S OR NOT ENOUGH THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
BECAUSE IN C. D. IS HOW MUCH 
IT'S NOT EVEN IN G. B. 
SO THEN C. D. S OR NOT ENOUGH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DATAS OR YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
OKAY MM-HMM 
I DON'T KNOW 
NO NO UH W HE WAS HAVING LOCKED MANY THINGS IN THE PROPER PLACES 
BUT IN TEMP HE WASN'T HAVING LOT OF IMPORTANT THINGS YEAH 
ALL THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH HE WAS RUNNING 
MM-HMM 
UH LIKE WHAT 
BUT WHAT WE'LL DO WITH THE SWITCHES 
NO NO NO NO NO 
OKAY THAT WAY IT MIGHT BE ABOUT THE SITUATION IS THAT HE HE HE WAS GENERATING HIS OWN P. L. P. FEATURES FROM HIS OWN SCRIPTS 
HE WAS NOT USING USING DOCTOR SPEECH 
YEAH 
SO HE WAS LIKE HE HE WAS SO I'D BORROWED FEW OF THE THINGS FROM HIM 
THE F. F. T. ROUTINE AND UH READING THE SIGNAL WAVE FORM 
THESE THINGS I BORROWED FROM HIM AND I CHANGED AND THEN I PUT IT IN MY ALL PROGRAMMES SO 
I I KEPT THE BACKUPS BUT THOSE BACKUPS ARE THE THEM'S ALSO IN TEMP 
I DIDN'T I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS THIS WAY IT CAN CRASH BECAUSE I THOUGHT MAYBE I CAN DO A MISTAKE AND WIPE OUT THE THINGS 
AND THEN THERE IS NO BACKUP 
SO I CANNOT BLAME ANYBODY BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE WHOLE BACKUP CAN ITSELF CRASH 
YEAH 
SO NOW IN IN MY LIFE I WILL NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING WHICH IS TEMP 
WHETHER IT IS TEMPERATURE OR WHETHER IT IS TEMPORARY 
BECAUSE JUST FEW FEW DAYS BACK I TAKE A BACKUP OF MY LAPTOP FEARING THE SAME THING 
BUT THEN I DIDN'T REALISE THAT I SHOULD TAKE A BACKUP OF 
P. L. P. S HARDLY ANYTHING YEAH 
OH 
FROM POSTERIORS TO S FORCED ALIGNMENT 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THREE YEARS TWO TO THREE YEARS YEAH 
NOT IN ALL CASES THAT'S THE PROBLEM WHICH PEOPLE ARE FACING 
BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS WRITTEN THEN AND THERE ITSELF 
MEANS EVEN IF THE OPTIMISATION HAS BEEN DONE THEY DID THE OPTIMISATION THERE AND THEY THEY WORKED ON THAT STARTED WORKING ON THAT 
THEY DIDN'T WRITE IT WITH PEN OR SOMETHING IN A PAPER OR SAYING THAT OKAY THIS IS THE BEST OPTIMISATION 
YEAH 
BECAUSE IF I CHANGE MY CONFIGURATION AND YOUR RESULTS ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE 
OKAY 
SO HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE SPENT 
OKAY SO THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH 
YEAH 
OKAY THANK YOU 
HAVE A GOOD DAY 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU CAN GO BACK UP TO THE AFTER YOU KNOW 
UP TO 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YOU CAN THEN YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF MOST DID IT ON WHAT NUMBERS AND ONE OF COUPLE OF C. T. F. EXPERIMENTS RIGHT 
NO NO NO NO NO I UH PROBABLY MIGHT 
OH 
YEAH BUT THE WAVE FILE IS TH THAT'S IN THE TEMP ONLY RIGHT 
SO SO THE ONLY THING IS THAT I CAN RECOVER IT BACK FROM BERKELEY 
NO EVERYTHING WE WE OF THE IF THEY SAY THAT WE CANNOT RECOVER IT THEN I CAN QUICKLY GET IT BACK FROM ICSI IN A COUPLE OF DAYS 
I CAN PUT ALL THE SYSTEM BACK HERE 
BUT UH 
MM YEAH 
YEAH A LOT OF TIME ON IT I CAN DOW OBVIOUSLY DOWNLOADING IS ANOTHER THING 
THE ONLY THING IS THAT I HAVE TO DO IS THAT THEY HAVE UH DATA ON UH IN PARTICULAR STRUCTURE 
SO I HAVE TO FIRST OF ALL YOU KNOW ORGANISE CREATE TAR FILES AND THEN I CAN GET IT BACK HERE 
YEAH THAT I CAN GET ALL THESE THINGS 
ALL THE ALL THESE UM YEAH 
YEAH BUT TH THOSE FILES CAN BE RECOVERED EASILY ONLY THING IS THAT UH NOW IF THEY HAD TO SAY THAT WE CANNOT RECOVER IT 
UH UH IN UH IN UH DAY ONE O ONE TWO DAYS LIKE THIS WEEK I CAN WAIT AND SO 
IF THEY CANNOT RECOVER IT THEN I CAN JUST GOT ALL THE DATA FROM ICSI AND PUT BACK THE C. T. S. SYSTEM 
NO WE CANNOT DO 
YEAH 
EVERYTHING THAT 
NO NO 
NO NO BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE DOWN ON THE DATABASE SECTION 
YEAH EXCEPT SWITCHBOARD BUT THE SWITCHBOARD ALSO WE HAVE TO BUT ONLY THING IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE DATA WE NEED YEAH 
NO NO IT IS DEAD 
BECAUSE IT WAS THAT NOW 
NO NO IT W O ORI ORIGINALLY DONE 
NO NO IT IS EVEN IN D. V. D. FORM WE HAVE TO THAT THE 
NO EXCEPT UH EXCEPT TIME 
HOW MUCH TIME WE WANT TO SPEND AGAIN TO GET 
YEAH IT'S 
MM 
MM-HMM 
THEY ARE THEY'RE IT'S IT'S IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOU GOT THREE DISK GONE 
THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET IT WILL LIKE FINE IF IT'S ONE DISK IT'S FINE BECAUSE AT LEAST ONE IS HAVING THE UH MIRROR MIRROR 
SO IT WILL RECACHE ON THE MIRROR 
UM BUT UH OF THE OTHER DISK ARE AGAIN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT 
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WENT LIKE USUALLY WHILE AS SOON AS ONE DISK FAILS IT SHOULD BE REPLACED ACTUALLY AND UH I DUNNO 
MAYBE YEAH OTHERWISE IT UH IT'LL GO ON DESTROYING OTHER DISKS 
SO I SEE THE ONE SO THEY I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HAPPEN YOU KNOW SUCH A THING LIKE USUALLY AS SOON AS ONE FALSE 
IT ACTUALLY NOTIFIES THE YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR OR MAKES CERTAIN KIND OF UM ONES 
OH YEAH IT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW IT HAS TO BE REPLACED 
SO WE UH IF IT THE DISK IS NOT REPLACED THEN IT W IT'LL FAIL 
IT UH THEN THEN IT UH THERE'S A INTERNAL RECOVERY IF IT JUST RE REPLACE THE DISK THERE 
IT'S IT IT CAN INTERNALLY IT CAN QUICKLY RECOVER EVERYTHING INTO THAT DISK 
UH SO SO IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A MM MM UH UM IF YOU HAVE 
IT'S KIND OF LIKE ESSENTIALLY IF IT IS LIKE HUNDRED TWENTY HUNDRED HUNDRED G. B. DATA SPACE 
THEN IT ESSENTIALLY WILL HAVE A HUN TWO HUNDRED G. B. ONLY STU VISIBLE DATA OF IT YOU 
BUT THEN IT CAN WE AS SOON AS THEY REPLACE ONE OF THIS HARD DISK I IT CAN IT CAN FROM THE OTHER ONE IT CAN RECOVER EVERYTHING IN THAT 
INTER INTERNALLY IT CAN DO THAT KIND OF THING BUT IF THE THE OF THE OTHER DISKS FAIL 
THEN IT'S IT'S IT'S YEAH A REALLY DIFFICULT JOB I DON'T KNOW HOW IT CAN BE RECOVERED 
PROBABLY THE MM NO WAY THAT THEY EXTEND THE HERE THE HARD DISK TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS 
AND THEY DO LIKE SECTOR BY SECTOR BLOCK BY BLOCK THEY TRY TO RECOVER 
BUT THAT'S IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE 
UH THE SIMPLE YES THE SIMPLE THING MIGHT COST YOU MINIMUM TEN THOUSAND EUROS FIFTEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS INSURED 
I DON'T THINK INSURANCE COMPANY WILL GIVE 
MM-HMM 
NO IT DOES BECAUSE IT WAS NOT TEMP IN TEMP TWO BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME MM IT HAS THREE G. B. THREE DISKS HARD DISK CATEGORY 
AND SO YOU CAN GO UP TO FOURTEEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT CAN BE IN THE SAME YEAH 
BUT IS IT TRIES TO PUT IF YOU IT TRIES TO UH QUICKLY PUT THINGS UH OF THIS WAY THAT IS THAT AND BUT ONLY THING THAT ONLY ONE HAS THE MM UM BACKUP 
KEEP TAKING UP THE BACKUP THERE 
SO IT PUTS EVERYTHING MM QUICKLY IT CAN DECIDE WHEREVER IT WANTS TO PUT SO IT'S FASTER TO DO THAT WAY 
MM 
NO I THINK THAT UH SOFT NAME THEY WERE GIVEN THE 
YEAH 
BUT THEN WHAT ARE THE EASE OF RAID THEN 
NO BUT THAT IS WHAT THE RED CAN ALLOW YOU TO HAVE KEEP UP TO FOURTEEN HARD DISK 
IT CAN ALLOW 
YEAH SO IT THEY HAVE FIVE AND YOU CAN GO UP TO FOURTEEN IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THERE 
AND IT CAN STILL WORK AND IT TAKES THE AND THE WAY TO LOOK LIKE IT IT'S STILL TOLERANT YOU KNOW 
THE WAY TO TO USUALLY IT DOES IT IF YOU IN THIS CRASHES BEFORE UH I UH UM IF IT UH REPLACE QUICKLY THAN ONE PROBLEMS 
OTHERWISE UNSAVED DATA WILL START THE FIRST THING IS TO GET LO LOST 
MM THAT'S THE THING 
I UM 
TEMP IS NO WELL IT'S A I THINK THEY CAN THEY CAN THEY CAN DO 
BECAUSE THE THE SOME SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THAT EXPERT THERE ARE COUPLE OF EXPERTISE SO THEY LEARNED ITSELF 
SO 
IF THEY CAN EASILY RECOVER IT WILL 
TO DO THIS KIND OF THING YOU KNOW 
YEAH IT DEPENDS ON THE JOB 
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE SMALL HARDWARE THING THEY MIGHT DO IT IT THEN YOU KNOW FIVE THOUSAND EUROS AND ALL 
BUT IF IT'S VERY MUCH DETAILED WORK 
THEY WILL JUST I AT THE SYSTEM THE THE WHOLE THING STARTS LIKE THIS THAT YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND SIGN A FORM AND THEN ONLY THEY WILL START TOUCHING YOUR HARD DISK 
YEAH 
NO NO BE IN THE THEY WILL 
NO NO THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY LIKE YOU DO IT THEN SEND OUT THE HARD DISK THEN THEY WILL SAY OKAY WE CAN DO IT 
AND THEN IF YOU DO IT WITH ONLY WITH ONLY YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THEN WHAT DID THEY ESTIMATE OF THAT 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT IS YEAH 
NO IT IT IS UP TO YOU KNOW 
AND IN FACT IF THEY THEY CAN GO A LOT BUT YOU KNOW 
THEY CAN GO BLOCK BY BLOCK AND LOOK INTO IT AND TRY TO RECOVER BUT UM THAT MATTHEW WILL WANT TO GO OR NOT SO THE QUESTION 
YEAH 
AND IT'S LIKE FORTY TERA 
FOUR TERA THAT'S FORTY TERA 
YEAH 
FOUR THOUSAND G. B. S 
YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG 
MM UM 
YEAH UH 
MM YEAH IT'S A 
AND HEMANT HOW UH HOW DO YOU WANT TO GO ABOUT IT 
MM 
NO I WILL SAY HOW DO YOU LIKE TO GO ABOUT WITH ICAS 
MM 
YOU DID IT IN ONLY ONE 
AND THEY WERE THEN 
YEAH 
UH IS THE TRIPHONE M. L. P. AND GET UH 
NO 
NO I I GAVE YEAH 
YEAH IT YEAH 
NO NO 
OH YEAH SCALE LIKE UH SCALE LIKELIHOO FROM UH TO UH M. L. P. 
YEAH WELL YEAH SO I JU I D D I DID TRY TO YEAH THA THAT'S HOW YOU DO THAT 
NO BUT I THINK WHAT I THINK THERE IS STILL SOME DATA WHICH IS RECOVERABLE 
AT LEAST THEY COULD GIVE US TIME TO I THINK THAT UH THE MOST OF THESE THINGS SHOULD BE THERE 
I CAN HOPE IT ALREADY IF THEY COULD 
NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE BUT YOU COULD READ NO 
YEAH 
SO DANIEL AS WELL IN ITALY 
YEAH 
UH THAT AS FAR WILL LOSE ALL THE DATA YOU KNOW 
PHYSICALLY UH YEAH 
YEAH PHYSICALLY IT IS UPDATED 
NO I THINK THERE IS SPRINKLER OR SOMETHING AROUND HERE I HOPE SO 
YEAH IN FACT THEY DISTRIBUTED THE WHOLE THING AROUND 
THEY MAY NOT HAVE TO ONE ONE PLACE 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT I CAN RECOVER 
NO BUT 
FOR EXAMPLE F PHONEBOOK I CAN RECOVER EVERYTHING ON PHONEBOOK BECAUSE I HAVE IT IN THE C. D. 
I WROTE IT ONCE TIME TO COPY IT TO MY HOME AND SO I HAVE ALL THE DATA OF MY C. D. 
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I HAD I COPIED ALL THE NUMBERS THAT ARE IN THAT IS 
DATA ITSELF 
THE WHOLE FEATURE TO EVERYTHING 
FEATURES SEGMENTATION EVERY LABEL FILE EVERYTHING IS THERE 
I COULD RECOVER IT BACK FROM THERE ACTUALLY BUT 
TEMP 
NO 
NO I UH 
NOT 
ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT THE NUMBERS I THINK I PRETTY MUCH CAN RECOVER ALL THE EVEN THE F TRIPHONE EXPERIMENTS 
BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE KEPT THOSE LABELS ALL THESE THINGS IN THE SPEECH DIRECTORY 
A P. FILE OF IT 
SO IT'S EASIER TO TO ALL BACK ALL THOSE LABELS AND EVERYTHING YEAH 
P. L. P. SHOULD BE THERE 
I OR SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE P. L. P. ALSO SOMEWHERE THA 
NO MM THE THE EXTRA WORK ON IS LIKE YOU KNOW CONVERTING THE SEGMENTATIONS FROM MONOPHONE TO TRIPHONE THIS KIND OF THING 
THEN THE ALL THE SCRIPTS ARE THERE IN THE TEMP FILE THAT KIND OF THING 
I UH LIKE NO NO NO NO NO 
NO WHAT YOU DO IS LIKE YOU HAVE THE SEGMENTATION TO TURN THAT FOR MONOPHONES RIGHT 
YOU CAN UH YOU CAN CONVERT THE SAME THING INTO TRIPHONE SEGMENTATION BECAUSE THERE IS MONOPHONE AND TRIPHONE THEY ARE NOT DIFFERENT 
EXCEPT THAT YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GIVE A DIFFERENT LABEL TO THEM P DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT 
SO IT'S EASIER TO CONVERT THAT SEGMENTATION DIRECTLY HERE RATHER THAN NOW UGH YOU KNOW 
YOU SAY THE POINT THAT IF YOU LOSE ONE UH SO UH IS THE THING IS THAT I HAVE TO RECOVER MEANS I HAVE TO RECOVER THROUGH THE PHO NO MONOPHONE SEGMENT SEGMENTATION TO TRIPHONE SEGMENTATION 
THE WHOLE THING 
YEAH IT'S OKAY 
TH THAT UH NUMBERS IT'S VERY FAST AS IT'S NO PROBLEM 
YEAH SO IT'S YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT RIGHT NOW YOU THE THING IS THAT RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW ALMOST WHAT IS THE UH LIKE THE WHICH WILL GIVE YOU THE BEST IS ALSO YOU CAN CONT INSTEAD OF RUNNING IT HMM 
YEAH 
ANYWAY MM LET'S RECOVER IT 
UH LET'S HOPE THE BEST 
I THINK I THINK WE HAVE SPENT 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
FINE 
OKAY FINE 
IT'S ALL WE HAVE TO LEAVE FAST 
OKAY 
OKAY SO SHOULD I START 
OKAY 
SO I THINK IT'S BETTER TO FIRST HAVE A PRESENTATION OF MY WORK AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS UH WITH THIS CRASH IN TEMP IN TEMP UH WHAT WE CAN DO UH FOR MY FEATURE TO TO CONTINUE MY RESEARCH 
BECAUSE APPARENTLY I I WILL HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OKAY 
SO I WILL START WITH THE PRESENTATION OF MY WORK 
MM 
OKAY 
I START LIKE THIS THEN 
OKAY SO IT'S UH MY G WORK IS GENERALLY ABOUT UH USING POSTERIORS IN UH SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS AND UH SOMEHOW ENHANCING THE ESTIMATION OF POSTERIORS 
GETTING NEW POSTERIORS WHICH ARE HAVI WHICH ARE MORE INFORMATIVE BY SOMEHOW INTEGRATING SOME EXTRA KNOWLEDGE LIKE UH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PROBLEM AND THEN USE THIS POSTERIOR ESTIMATION UH UH METHOD UH FOR DESIGNING HIERARCHICAL UH SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
SO ON THIS HIERARCHICAL ARG ARCHITECTURE I WILL BE ABLE TO UH INTEGRATE THE EXTRA KNOWLEDGE AT THE PROPER LEVEL OF HIERARCHY 
AND I WILL BE AL ALSO UH ABLE TO UH COMBINE DIFFERENT KIND OF UH KNOWLEDGE OR SOURCES UH SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE I HAVE 
UH WELL AS YOU KNOW UH GENERALLY POSTERIORS ARE ESTIMATED USING UH NEURAL NETWORKS AND MORE SPECIFICALLY M. L. P. S IN A SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
SO UH TIME LIMITED WINDOW OF A SPEECH SIGNAL IS UH REPRESENTED BY SOME CEPSTRAL FEATURES 
WHICH ARE THEN PROCESSED BY AN M. L. P. AND IT GIVES US SOME EVIDENCE AS IN THE FORM OF POS PHONE POSTERIORS 
THEN WE USE THIS PHONE POSTERIORS AS FEATURES OR AS SCORES FOR FOR EITHER JUST DECODING OR DO UH UH AN IDEA TRAINING AND INFERENCE TRAINING AND THEN DECODING 
UH BUT WE KNOW THAT UH IN THIS UH IN THIS CASE WE ARE NOT ABLE TO INTEGRATE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION UH UH LINE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION 
AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO INTEGRATE THE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE WE CAN HAVE ABOUT PHONE IS OUR BUT 
UH WORDS IN THE POSTERIOR ESTIMATION SO THE MAIN MOTIVATION IS IT IS IF WE CAN INTEGRATE THIS KIND OF EXTRA KNOWLEDGE ON THE POSTERIOR ESTIMATION 
SO WHAT IS PROPOSED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS IT IS A UH WHAT WE FORMALLY USE AN H. M. M. FORMALISM WHICH IS CALLED GAMMA UH STATE POSTERIOR 
UH I UH AS A POSTERIOR FOR UH TRAINING UH OR DECODING SO IT'S UH WELL AS YOU KNOW IT'S A STATE POSTERIOR PROBABLILITY IN A H. M. M. 
WHICH IS DEFINED AS THE PROBABILITY OF BEING IN A SPECIFIC H. M. M. STATE IT A SPECIFIC TIME HAVING THE WHOLE OBSERVATION SEQUENCE AND THE MODEL 
SO WHOLE OBSERVATION SEQUENCE MEANS HAVING COMPLETE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION AND THE MOD UH AND THE MODEL CAN ENCODE SOME KIND OF PRIOR KNOWLEDGE FOR US BY MEANS OF UH TOPOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS 
UH WELL YOU KNOW IT'S UH THIS GAM UH GAMMA POSTERIOR IS WRITTEN IN TERMS OF FORWARD AND BACKWARD H. M. M. RECURSIONS 
AND ACTUALLY ONE WAY TO USE THIS UH GAMMA POSTERIORS AS UH USING THESE POSTERIORS IS SOME KIND OF NEWER SCORES FOR DECODING 
SO ON THIS CASE IT WILL BE UH SIMILAR TO HYBRID METHOD 
UM THE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE DO ONE MORE STEP UH MAYBE I CAN EXPLAIN IT BETTER THERE 
SO WE DO ONE MORE STEP HERE AND WE UH HERE BY MEANS OF ANOTHER H. M. M. WE INTRODUCE SOME KIND OF UH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION 
WE GET BETTER EVIDENCES THAN WHAT I W INITIALLY HAD HERE 
AND THEN WE DO THE UH DECODING AND THE END IS MORE INFORMATIVE POSTERIORS UH UH INSTEAD OF THIS ONE 
SO WE ARE EXPECTING TO UH THE SYSTEM TO PERFORM BETTER AND MORE ROBUST TO NOISY CASES 
HERE YOU USE UH SOME RESULTS UH AND HOW UH HOW WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF INTRODUCING UH REASONABLE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE 
SO DIFFERENT UH ROWS IN THIS TABLE ARE SHOWING DIFFERENT LEVEL OF NOISE AND ALSO CLEAN SPEECH AND DIFFERENT COLUMNS ARE SHOWING DIFFERENT KIND OF POSTERIORS OR GAMMA POSTERIORS 
SO UH THE THE FIRST COLUMN IS SHOWING THE UH OUR BASELINE SYSTEM 
WHICH IS GETTING ESTIMATE OF POSTERIORS OUT OF M. L. P. UH AND THEN D USING THESE POSTERIORS FOR DECODING 
AND THE OTHER COLUMNS ARE SHOWING THE PERFORMANCE OF UH DIFFERENT KIND OF GAMMA 
SO UH GAMMA WHICH IS ESTIMATED USING UH INFORMATION ABOUT MINIMUM DURATION OF PHONEMES ABOUT 
POSSIBLE TRANSITION BETWEEN PHONEMES AND SOME KIND SOME UH MORE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE LIKE UH WHICH WE LIKE UH WHICH WORD IS COMPOSED OF WHICH PHONEMES AND UH G UH GRAM GRAMMATICAL KNOWLEDGE AB UH ABOUT TRANSITION BETWEEN WORDS AND THINGS LIKE THIS 
SO SO YOU SEE INTRODUCING MORE REASONABLE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE UM WELL UH HELP TO HAVE BETTER PERFORMANCE IN ALMO IN ALMOST ALL THE CASES 
AND HERE I COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE GAMMA BASE SYSTEM WITH THE STANDARD H. M. M. G. M. M. SYSTEM 
WHICH IS BASED ON UH DOING DECODING UH USING UH LIKELIHOOD IS THE SCORES 
AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT OUR SYSTEM IS UH IS USING POSTERIORS FOR DECODING 
SO SO YOU S SO UH IT'S WORKING UH BETTER THAN THE STANDARD H. M. M. G. M. M. SYSTEM 
AND FINALLY THE CONCLUSION IS UH UH HERE WE SAW HOW WE CAN GET UH SOME MORE INFORMATIVE POSTERIORS BY INTRODUCING EXTRA KNOWLEDGE LIKE PRIOR AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION 
AND THEN USING THIS UH UH P POSTERIOR ESTIMATION METHOD TO DESIGN HIERARCHICAL UH SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM WHICH WE'RE WHICH WHICH THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A BETTER 
MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE ROBUST SYSTEM 
SO IF YOU WANT NOW WE CAN DISCUSS ABOUT UM UH THE CRASH AND THE LESS OF DATA 
SO UH WELL I LOST ALL THE POSTERIORS I WAS I UH I USED AS INPUT UH FOR MY SYSTEM 
SO THE GAMMA ARE SOMEHOW ESTIMATED OR COMPUTED ON TOP OF POSTERIORS 
AND NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY POSTERIOR AND UH PROBABLY THE SCRIPTS GENERATING THAT POSTERIOR SO WHAT I CAN DO OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
GAMMA FULL MODEL BUT UH WHAT ABOUT OTHER ONES AND WHAT ABOUT THE F POSTERIOR BECAUSE BECAUSE I I UH YOU KNOW 
I CANNOT UH STOP MY RESEA I I MAY DO SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW IN FUTURE WITH THIS UH AND WELL I NEED POSTERIORS OUT 
YEAH 
OH NO NO I DON'T HAVE THEM THERE WERE ALL UNDER TEMP 
Y Y WE HAVE THAT BECAUSE YOU UH STORED THEM 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE MAYBE SOME OTHER UM UH P. H. D. STUDENT SHOULD BE HARD TO WORK ON YOU KNOW THE GENERATING GAMMA 
SIX OKAY 
LESS CONTEXT WHAT YOU MEAN 
OH 
YES 
YEAH 
YOU MEAN A SMALLER CONTEXT INSTEAD OF THIS 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH B WELL EVEN THEY CAN HAVE SOME INFORMATION WHICH ARE NOT SO MEANINGFUL OR UH WHICH ARE NOT RELATED 
YEAH WELL BUT THEN I WILL HAVE THE PROBLEM TO FIND THE OPTIMUM AMOUNT OF CONTEXT 
HOW MUCH CONTEXT SHOULD I TAKE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
THAT'S REASONABLE 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND AND YOU DON'T HAVE UH SCRIPTS FOR 
OH OKAY YOU DO YOU HAVE JUST YOUR NO 
AND WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE YOUR 
MM 
YES 
NO YEAH I UH FOR C. T. S. PETR UH STILL I THINK HAVE UH DIDN'T UH ALSO ANYTHING SO 
OH 
OKAY 
MM 
MM JUST UH P UH P UH POSTERIOR ESTIMATED USING P. L. P. FEATURES FOR NUMBER WHICH I THINK WE CAN WE CAN RATE IT 
UH P. L. P. THEY'RE ALSO LOST 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YES 
UH NOWADAYS NOT THAT ONE 
THERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR UH VERIFYING THESE RESULTS BECAUSE WELL FOR THESE RESULTS YOU KNOW 
THE THE CONFIGURATION SHOULD NOT WELL I ALSO SAVED THE CONFIGURATION SOMEWHERE IN THE TEMP 
SO EXACTLY HOW MANY STAYS FOR DECODING AND WHICH KIND OF LANGUAGE MODEL AND THINGS LIKE THIS 
I I THINK I CAN REMEMBER ALMOST ALL OF THEM BUT IF IT'S IT'S A BIT UH UH STRESSFUL 
YEAH BUT HE HE DOESN'T 
UH YOU UM YES 
LOST 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH SO SO SO THE CONCLUSION THERE IS NO MAJOR PROBLEM EXCEPT REGENERA YEAH WHICH TIME FOR I GUESS 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
WELL I ALSO HAD THE OF GENERATED POSTERIORS OR GAMMAS OR THINGS LIKE THIS WHICH I SHOULD REGENERATE 
I HAVE THE UH SCRIPTS BUT UH WELL IT TAKES TIME IT'S C. P. U. AND REGENERATING ALL THESE THINGS BUT OKAY IT'S OKAY 
SO THERE IS NO MAJOR PROBLEM EXCEPT TIME 
DEADLINE OF TWO WEEKS FOR ICAS 
HMM 
HMM 
IT 
OH 
WELL I I THINK WE AFTER THIS MEETING WE CAN IT WE CAN TRY TOGETHER TO REGENERATE THIS 
WELL UH P. L. P. S I THINK TH THEY SHOULD BE FIRST REGENERATED THEN POSTERIORS AND IF BY THE END OF WEEK WE COULD HAVE POSTERIORS 
THEN IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT I CAN EASILY REGENERATE THE GAMMAS AND DO ALL THE EXPERIMENTS AGAIN 
MAYBE IT'S A 
UH MAINLY THE OTHER WOULD BE SOME EXPERIMENT TO CHECK HOW THE SYSTEM IS ROBUST AGAINST THESE UH TUNING FACTORS LIKE UH LANGUAGE MOD UH LANGUAGE MODELLING 
SCALING FACTOR LANGUAGE SCALING FACTOR AND INVERSION PENALTY 
THIS WILL BE THE MAIN NEW ISSUE AND UH WELL 
YEAH THE NEW THING IN THE PAPER AND WELL SOME 
NO NO THESE CASES BUT 
WELL ACTUALLY ACTUALLY THIS W THIS WAS NOT IN THE PAPER 
I PUT IT IN THE PRESENTATION BUT IT'S NOT IN THE PAPER 
UH THE PAPER WAS JUST FOR CLEAN SPEECH BUT SINCE I HAD THE RESULTS BEFORE AND I CANNOT COPY THESE THINGS 
BECAUSE I IT UH I TALKED WITH HERVE AND HE SAID OKAY 
ACTUALLY THE NUMBERS ARE NOT UH VERY REASONABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST THIRTEEN P. L. P. FEATURES AND UH WE HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST SOMETHING WHICH IS KNOWN FOR PEOPLE 
I MEAN THEY ARE EXPECTING SOMETHING AROUND NINETY EIGHTY SEVEN OR UH SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
UH SO I ANYWAY I HAD TO RE TO READ ALL THE EXPERIMENTS BUT NOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT 
BECAUSE BEFORE I HAD POSTERIORS AND NOW WE HAVE TWO MORE STEPS P. L. P. S AND AND AND POSTERIORS SO 
YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH UH 
UH UM I WANTED I WANTED TO EXTEND THIS UH WELL ACTUALLY THE PAPER WE WANTED TO WRITE WAS UH FOR ICAS WAS SOMETHING RELATED TO MULTI STREAM GAMMA 
BUT OKAY OKAY 
UH WELL I I WILL EXPLAIN 
SO THE MY PLAN WAS TO HAVE TWO STREAMS AND I I I WILL 
YEAH 
I SEE I I THOUGHT THAT OKAY I ONE STREAM WILL BE P. L. P. AND THE OTHER WILL BE DELTA P. L. P. S 
SO THIS WAS ONE PART OF EXPERIMENT IS SINGLE STREAM AND THEN I WANTED TO COMBINE DELTAS WITH THIS AND HAVE ANOTHER TABLE IS THAT WAS WHY 
BUT ACTUALLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS AND THE STUDY IS NOT SH I IT'S NOT SHOWING UH STRONG RESULTS 
ANYWAY RESULTS ARE NOT VERY IMPORTANT BUT THEY SHOULD BE WITHIN A RANGE OF UH ACCEPTABLE NUMBERS 
SO THEN UH FOR NOW I THINK IT'S BETTER TO INSTEAD OF DOING P. L. P. AND DELTA P. L. P. 
I CAN UH HAVE SINGLE STREAM OF THIRTY NINE P. L. P. S AND THEN COMBINE THEM WITH TRAPS JUST TO HAVE 
YEAH THIRTY NINE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
NO NO IT'S INTERSPEECH 
THE OKAY 
THESE NUMBERS ARE FULL P. L. P. THIRTY NINE OKAY 
BUT JUST TO MAKE THINGS CLEAR ON THE PRESENTATION TO SHOW MORE STEPS 
TRY YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
EVEN 
EVEN IF YOU 
NO 
THE 
YEAH 
IT'S AMAZING THAT EVERYTHING WAS UNDER TEMP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SILEYE WILL BE BACK AND HE'S NOT IN VACATION BUT HE'S IN ITALY 
HE FLIES TO SENEGAL DIRECTLY 
MM 
MM 
AND WHAT IF WE HAVE SOME DAY A FOUR IN IDIAP WE WILL LOSE ALL THE DATA 
MM I MEAN BUT THEY HAVE WELL I I THINK W THEY CAN AND YEAH THEY CAN DO YOU KNOW STORE IT SOMEWHERE 
BUT YOU KNOW HERE WE CAN EASILY HAVE A FOUR BECAUSE THE EVERYTHING IS MADE OF WOOD I THINK AND IT'S SMALL AND 
ANYWAY THE GOOD THE CONCLUSION IS TO HAVE A BACK UP AND UH AND C. D. AT HOME 
MM 
YEAH 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
REVERSE 
OKAY 
THANK YOU THINK YOU 
YOU IT 
A LAPEL IS ALSO THERE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S BETTER 
UH YOU GO TO THE TABLE YOU HAVE THREE LIKE THE BIG TABLE YOU TOLD AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS 
SO WHICH I THINK I HAVE ALL THE GAMMAS NO 
ESPECIALLY GAMMA FULL MODELS I HAVE 
YEAH POSTERIORS 
AND POSTERIORS 
EVEN YOU HAVE THESE THREE STATE PERFORM GAMMAS ALSO YOU HAVE ALL THIS 
HUH 
OH OKAY 
SO NOW YEAH NOW YOU CAN WRITE ANOTHER PAPER IF YOU CAN 
GAMMAS TO POSTERIOR 
I TWO HUNDRED 
TWO HUNDRED MILLISECOND 
SO BUT FOR NUMBERS I THINK IT MAY BE OKAY NUMBERS HARDLY YEAH 
ONE TWO 
EVEN LESS THAN THAT YEAH 
JUST FEW WORDS LIKE SO BUT IF FOR OR SOMETHING 
LIKE IF IT'S REALLY LONG SENTENCE OF TEN SECONDS OR SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT REALLY NEED AS MUCH CON 
I KNOW IT'S REALLY COMPUTATIONALLY VERY INTENSIVE ALSO LIKE IF YOU SEE 
IS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE POSTERIORS OR FROM YOU ONLY 
ASK 
UH YOU KNOW 
BUT L FOR YOUR CASE YOU DON'T NEED REALLY COMPLICATED POSTERIOR YOU JUST NEED SOME P. L. P. S AND THEN 
NO BUT BUT UM HE'S HE MAY BE LINKING TO MATTHEW I GUESS BECAUSE MATTHEW GOT THE WAV FILES 
BUT YOU GET THE ALL THE WAV FILES SO 
YEAH SO THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING LIKE 
OH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
SO IF HE GOT FEATURES THEN IT'S OKAY OTHERWISE IF HE HAS TO GENERATE AGAIN HE CAN'T GENERATE 
YEAH 
SO 
BECAUSE 
YEAH 
BUT THE P EVERYBODY HAS FEATURES IN TEMP ONLY MOST OF THE TIME ALL THE C. T. S. FEATURES OR C. T. S. WAV FILES SO 
SO FORGET ABOUT C. T. S. AT LEAST NOW I THINK BECAUSE IT'S AGAIN 
IT TAKES AT LEAST ONE OR TWO WEEKS 
BUT SEGMENTATION 
BUT YOU SAY DO YOU NEED TO DO SOME SEGMENTATION ALSO ON TOP OF THAT IS 
THEY'RE 
YEAH THE WE CAN WAIT AT LEAST ONE OR TWO WEEKS FOR THIS BECAUSE IT'S 
BUT STILL I THINK WE CAN'T REALLY DO THESE THINGS BEFORE ICAS BECAUSE YEAH 
SO MAYBE WE CAN CONCENTRATE WORK ESPECIALLY ON NUMBERS NOW AND THEN WE CAN GO TO C. T. S. 
SO ON NUMBERS CASE WHAT DO YOU REALLY NEED LIKE 
YEAH BASICALLY YEAH WE WE NEED TO GENERATE AGAIN P. L. P. S BUT WAVE FILES ARE THERE 
YEAH P. L. P. S 
BUT YOU'RE GENERATING P. L. P. S FROM 
UM 
MM 
BUT AT LEAST YOU IF 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT YOU CAN DEL 
BUT AT LEAST YEAH YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO VERIFY THEIR WA 
SO SO P. L. P. S ARE THESE ARE ALL THIRTEEN JUST ONLY P. L. P. IS NOT DELTAS AND DEL 
YEAH 
BUT IF YOU GET SOMETHING FROM HEMANT OR MATTHEW THEN I HAVE THIS NUMBER OF STAGE 
LIKE WE HAVE THEN YOU KNOW LIKE IT'S ONLY FOR ONLY CLOSE UH D. C. L. K. C. L. THEY HAVE 
NO HE HE GOT FROM YOU ONLY 
OH 
I THINK SO YEAH SO THEN I HAVE THIS NUMBER OF STAGES 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
SO 
OH 
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY P. FOR THIS P. L. P. S IN P. L. P. S OR P. FILES FROM P. L. P. 
SO BU WHAT ABOUT THIS NOISE LEVELS LIKE WE HAVE NOISE WAV FILES IN DA DA COM DATABASES 
SO WE HAVE DIRECTLY F WAVE FILES WITH UH PARTICULAR ONES 
AH OK SO 
NO BUT BUT I THINK UH DO 
BUT 
HMM 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS LIKE ALL THESE I THINK IT MAY NOT BE THERE IN DATABASE I GUESS 
OH OKAY 
YOU CALLED THE NOISE X. DATABASE 
OH OKAY 
EVEN WITH UH S. AND R. S 
OH OKAY THEN IT'S OKAY 
OH 
SO Y Y IT'S NOT THAT YOU ALL THE ONE 
YEAH WITH S. AND R. DIFFERENT S. AND R. S 
YEAH SO AT LEAST WE HAVE WAVE FILES SO NOW WE CAN GENERATE ANYTHING IN THE P. L. P. S OR IS AT LEAST 
YEAH 
THIS 
BUT FOR ALL THESE S. AND R. S SO THAT'S ALSO AGAIN 
HMM 
IN THE THING IS LIKE YOU CAN'T REALLY WRITE THIS K I SUPPOSE UH THE CODE IS THE REAL PROBLEM SCRIPTS IS OKAY LIKE YEAH 
EVEN SCRIPTS ALSO THE CONFIGURATIONS OR YOU DO IF YOU FORGOT SOMETHING SOME FACTOR OR SOMETHING IT'S REALLY 
WHICH DISK 
UH THREE DISK 
MM-HMM 
SO IT SHOULD BE REPLACED BY 
AH OK 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
IT WILL OR 
UH IT WILL HAVE MEASURES LIKE 
OH 
HMM BUT LIKE THIS 
BUT EVEN THIS MAYBE REALLY HUGE DATA ALSO 
I THINK MAYBE SOME COMPANIES DEFINITELY DO INSURE YOU CAN'T REALLY HAVE SO MANY BACKUPS 
WHICH JUST PARTITION THESE UH 
HMM 
BUT 
YEAH 
BUT UH W W 
HMM 
YEAH IN TEMP 
UH SO THEN THEN 
HMM 
BUT IS IT REALLY COSTLY THE SYSTEM SO 
HMM 
MAYBE AT LEAST THEY WILL GIVE SOME NUMBER OTHERS LIKE THEY CAN 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH AT LEAST THEY THEY WILL KNOW M BEFOREHAND I THINK UH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM BUT EVEN LIKE HOW MUCH IMPORTANT DATA L SOMETIMES IT'S JUST M. P. THREES OR SOMETHING SO YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO 
FO FOUR TERA NO 
FOUR TERA IT'S LIKE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH FOUR THOUSAND GIGABYTES 
YEAH IT 
BUT NOW WE GOT SOMETHING LIKE UH MORE THAN FIFT 
NO RAID FIVE IS BETTER I THINK 
IT L TO LEVELS 
OH OH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
BUT RAID FIVE IS THAN THAN TWENTY PERCENT COPY ONLY 
OH 
IT'S NOT THE OTHER WAY 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH IT WILL BE THEN THE OTHER DISK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AGAIN 
SCALING 
AND ALSO MAYBE LIKE THIS NOISE IS HE WAS 
MM THIS IS NOT IN THE PAPER ACTUALLY DO 
THIS IS 
HMM 
YEAH 
AT LEAST NOW UH CAN KNOW A FULL SYSTEM SETUP FROM 
YEAH 
SO NOW MAINLY LIKE UH THIRTY NINE P. L. P. 
YOU WERE ALWAYS THIRTY NINE NO 
NOT SURE BUT THEN WHY DID THESE FEATURES YOU GIVE ME LIKE THEY'RE THIRTEEN 
YOU TRUNCATED THEM OUT 
NO NO NO NO THIS THIS THESE ONES LIKE THE 
OH OKAY 
HMM 
OH 
OH OKAY 
DELTAS 
OH OKAY 
AH OK 
HMM 
YEAH THESE RESULTS ONLY YOU REPORTED IN INTERSPEECH NO LIKE UH THIRTY NINE P. L. P. RESULTS 
OH 
UH THEY WERE BUT THEY WERE LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OR SO 
NOW EVEN THE CLEAN SPEECH YOU ARE GETTING 
NO NO THIS IS JUST 
OH NO NO HE GAVE SCALE TO UM THEN I GENERATED GAMMAS 
EVEN UH 
NO NO NO NO 
TH THEY'RE DIFFERENTLY 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE I HAVE TRIPHONE G. M. G. M. M. S AND H. M. M. S 
SO UH GIVE ME SCALE LIKELIHOODS OF TRIPHONES 
SCALE LIKELIHOOD 
SCALE LIKELIHOODS 
FROM TRIPHONE MEMORY 
HMM 
SO THEN AGAIN I WILL PASS THROUGH FULL NETWORK 
THEN I CAN GENERATE TRIPHONE GAMMAS 
IT'S LIKE 
IT'S NO NO IT'S UH IT'S JUST G. M. M. WORD MODELS 
YOU HAVE ALL THE CONNECTIONS TO BETWEEN ALL THE WORDS LIKE HMM 
SO THEN FIRST THING IS LIKE WE NEED TO GENERATE P. L. P. S AND THEN 
ALL THESE S. AND R. S P. L. P. S 
HMM 
NO IT WAS THERE IN UH LIKE UH YESTERDAY MORNING ALSO LIKE EVEN 
SO I WAS RUNNING SOME EXPERIMENTS AND THEN IT WAS OKAY BUT IT'S READABLE ONLY SO I CAN'T WRITE ANYTHING SO 
YEAH SO BUT WE DON'T KNOW LIKE WE THOUGHT LIKE I THOUGHT IT'S RECOVERING SO MAYBE BY TOMORROW I'LL GET EVERYTHING IS 
UH SO IF YOU WANT A COPY AGAIN YOU'LL HAVE 
BUT YEAH STILL SOME PEOPLE ARE IN VACATION SO THEY WILL REALLY 
PEDRO PEDRO ALSO 
HMM 
BUT EVEN ALL OVER THE RECENT ITERATION ITERATE TRAINING SET IN TEMP 
BECAUSE LIKE WE WE SEE HOW MUCH WE CAN COPY BECAUSE IT'S REALLY SO MANY ITERATIONS AND EVEN WE THOUGHT OF REALLY COMPLETING MINIMAL EXPERIMENT ALSO MM 
BUT AT LEAST YEAH A SCRIPT ARE THERE EVERY SCRIPTS LOOK AT LEAST SCRIPTS ARE THERE BUT SO IF IF THEY CAN DECIDE 
YEAH IF THEY CAN DECODE AT LEAST HEMANT'S P. FILES THEN HEMANT CAN 
YEAH 
BUT C. FILES YEAH 
EVEN IF THEY GIVE YOU P. FILES IT'S REALLY BETTER EVEN YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO RU RUN ALL THE 
YEAH YEAH YOU JU JUST ONLY LIKE RECENT P. FILES AT LEAST 
NO NO NO 
YEAH 
BUT STILL I THINK I IT DEPENDS 
UH IN EDINBURGH THEY HAD THAT BIG FIRE AND THEN 
EVEN EVEN SA SEVERAL UH DA BUILDINGS AND ALL THE COMPUTERS IN THAT BUILDING THEY ALL BURNED 
BUT THEY HAVE LIKE THREE BACKUPS IN THE UNIVERSITY IS ALL THESE PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T REALLY AFFECT MUCH 
NO IT'S THE UNIVERSITY SO MAYBE IT'S REALLY BIG SO THEY CAN AFFORD FOR 
YEAH THEY YEAH YEAH THEY WANT TH THEY'LL HAVE BACKUP IN DIFFERENT AND ALSO IN IN SOME IN UNDERGROUND 
SO THAT LIKE FILE PROOF OR SOMETHING YEAH 
YEAH MAYBE 
NO C. D. S OR NOT ENOUGH LIKE ONE 
YEAH HOW MUCH UH 
HMM 
HMM 
BUT WHAT ABOUT HOME DIRECTORIES OR UH ALSO KEPT EVERYTHING IN UH TEMP 
YEAH 
BUT UH UH DID MOSTLY ON NUMBERS ON 
SO AT LEAST IF WE CAN RECOVER WE WE CAN READ SOME OF HIS STUFF OR SOMETHING 
DID YOU LOCATE IT 
IT IS HIM OR HOME SPEECH OR SOMETHING 
LIKE FOR ANY FEATURES OR ANYTHING OR THREE 
NO NO UH UH MAYBE UH MIGHT BE USING SOME P. L. P. FEATURES OR SOMETHING TO THEY ARE DIFFERENT 
WE DON'T KNOW IT 
UH HIS OWN 
OH OKAY SO HERE HE GOT UH HIS OWN 
YEAH 
OH 
HEY 
HMM 
UH THEN IT'S GOOD YOU KNOW LIKE WE DON'T REALLY NO 
SO BUT YOUR P. L. P. IS ALSO LIKE 
MM-HMM 
THEN WE JUST NEED TO RUN YOUR NEURAL NET ONLY YEAH BUT P. P. P. L. P. S OR LIKE HARDLY FEW MINUTES LI 
MM 
WHICH WHICH SCRIPTS 
AND THEN 
BUT BUT YOU STILL NEED TO RUN ALL THE NOTES ON L 
IT'S 
NO BUT IT'S IT'S NOT I THINK AT LEAST IT TAKES TWO HOURS OR THREE HOURS I THINK 
YOU CAN'T PARALLEL ALSO THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO FOR EXAMPLE OF UH WANT REPEATED ALL THESE RESULTS THEN UH J UH AND IT IS ALL MA HEMANT'S P. L. P. CONFIGURATION THEN THAT'S REALLY 
YEAH THE RESULTS WILL BE 
THEN YOU DON'T YOU DON'T KNOW UH UH WELL 
YEAH FOR THIRTY FIVE FORTY MINUTES TO USE 
OH OH THANK YOU 
IT'S ALL 
OOPS 
MM-HMM 
THE RAPPLE ALSO 
NO 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
WITH THE LINK HERE ONE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OF THE VALUE YEAH MM-HMM 
MM OF THE PREVIOUS R UH PAGE RANK OR OF THE 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
MM 
OKAY 
MM UH-HUH 
SO WAIT UH I DON'T GET IT 
YOU YOU HAVE TWO REPRESENTATION IN WHICH COMES FROM THIS LINK UH STUFF AND ONE OF THIS ONE IS NOT BASED ON P. L. S. I. IT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YOU 
A T. YEAH OH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OH OH OKAY 
YEAH YEAH IT'S OKAY 
MM MM MM 
YEAH 
ARE THEY USE THE PERPLEXITY ON THE THE LIKELIHOOD TO SAY OH GOOD THIS LIKELIHOOD IS UH SO IT'S SMALLER THAN THE OTHER 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH IT'S THE SAME 
I IT'S MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT UH THIS HUMAN CATEGORISATION IS RELATED TO THE ON THAT IS DISCOVERED UH MM 
MM 
OH YEAH 
NO BUT 
BUT I HAVE THE FEELING I NO 
BUT IN THIS CASE YOU YOU HAVE TO USE UH THE LABEL ON YEAH 
YOUR ALSO 
BUT HOW DOES IT ENTER IN THAT 
I I YOU HAVE TO TURN YOUR UH 
YOUR TRAINING DATA 
YEAH BUT THE POINT IS THAT YOU SHOULD CHANGE IN A WAY THAT TO TAKE THE LABEL INTO ACCOUNT OR NOT 
OKAY 
OKAY OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM MM 
NO BUT WE 
BUT I 
NO 
TH TH THERE IS NOT UH V UH PERFECT UH CLUSTERING CLUS WH WHAT IS THE HOW DO YOU JUDGE UH WHAT IS A GOOD CLUSTERING 
AND YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY COMPAR UH 
YOU'RE COMPARING THEM 
OH OKAY OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
ALSO LIKE A BASELINE YEAH 
YOU UM YOU STILL NOT COMBI 
NO NO BUT IT'S ANOTHER 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM MM 
IN FACT I I HAVE SEEN A PAPER ON I. C. M. L. WHERE THE GUY WAS TRYING TO LEARN WHICH WORD UH UM ASPECTS OF CLUSTERING 
SO I GIVE YOU I GIVE THE REAL USERS MM THE PERSON UM A BUNCH OF MARBLES AND THEY BEGIN TO SAY OKAY 
AND THEY HAVE TO DIVIDE IT IN FIVE GROUP AND IN THE AND IT'S NOT L IT'S IT'S ALWAYS DIFFERENT AT THE CLUSTERING EACH PEOPLE HAS 
BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE 
BUT NO BUT THERE IS UH SOME CHARACTERISTIC THAT ARE FOR TRANSPARENCY COLOUR 
WHICH ARE UM FEATURES THAT MADE THE CLUSTERING THAT CAN BE EXTRACTED EVEN IF THE CLUSTERING IT'S ALWAYS DIFFERENT 
SO SO THAT'S ONLY TO SAY THAT UH IT'S IT CAN BE REALLY INFINITIVE CLUSTERING 
MM-HMM 
SAY ANOTHER ANOTHER EXAMPLE APART FROM UH THIS UH SEARCH 
UH I DON'T GET IT EXACTLY 
WHAT YOU MEAN THEN DON'T DON'T USE A GOOGLE PAGE BECAUSE IT'S UH TO UH S ROOT BUT UH ANOTHER PAGE MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
UH IT'S NOT THAT 
PEOPLE BEING YOUR ALGORITHM 
THAT'S THE POINT 
MM 
IT'S GETTING 
MM-HMM EXACTLY 
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TO FIT YEAH 
MM 
YOU HAD ONL TWO TOPICS 
OR NO 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IT WAS LINKI MM-HMM MM-HMM 
SO IT WAS A A GOOD POINT FOR YOU 
MM MM-HMM MM 
LIKE THIS YEAH MM MM MM OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM MM 
MM MM PROBABLY NOT YEAH 
MM MM 
MM MM 
MM 
YEAH MM 
AND 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UM THIS ALPHA I CAN TO BE DEPENDENT OF THE OF THE DOCUMENT 
AND HOW MANY TEXT SO ON IT 
OR SOMETHING UH YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM SO MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH OF COURSE 
YEAH MM 
YEAH YEAH W W I THINK WE'VE AGREE ON THAT YEAH 
MM MM 
MM 
MM PROBABLY HEURISTIC IT WILL BE EASIER TO COMPUTE BECAUSE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM YEAH MM 
MM 
MM 
DID YOU MANAGE TO TO DIVIDE THE LINK UH PROPERLY OR 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
L. D. A. 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM PYRAMID YEAH 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
MM MM 
'KAY 
MM MM 
ONE TWO MONTHS YEAH 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHETHER YOU'VE GOT THESE THINGS IN RIGHT OR NOT 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE IN RIGHT OR NOT 
FEELS WRONG 
OKAY SO I DON'T NEED THAT 
OKAY 
SO DAVID CAME IN IT UM AND TO SAY UH I SOMETHING WE'D BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A WHILE WAS SOME STUFF I'D BEEN WORKING ON ABOUT USING THESE TOPIC MODELS WITH UH WITH NETWORKS 
WITH AN THINGS WITH LINKS BETWEEN THEM DOCUMENTS THAT ARE LINKED 
OH NO UH IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S RELATED TO RAPPLE 
BUT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT TH THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW 
UH JUST BECAUSE I CAME UP WITH SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON 
BUT UH THE AT THE TIME BASICALLY I'D BEEN TRYING TO USE P. L. S. I. AND THESE TYPES OF MODELS ON WEB PAGES 
AND THAT CAME UP WITH UH A BIG PROBLEM IN THAT MOST WEB PAGES HAVE VERY VERY LITTLE TEXT ON THEM 
BUT YOU CAN TELL WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT BASED ON THE OTHER TEXTS ON THE SET 
THE TEXTS ON THE THINGS THEY'RE LINKED TO SEE WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW WAS CAN YOU COMBINE THE TOPIC MODELS THAT THE PAGES 
THAT HAVE LOTS OF TEXT ON THEM 
WITH SOMETHING ELSE THAT THAT TELLS YOU WHAT A PAGE THAT HAS AN ARE VERY LITTLE TEXT ON IT BASED ON THE LINKS YEAH 
IS QUITE SIMPLY IF YOU HAVE A PAGE ONE WHICH IS LIKE A HOME PAGE 
AND THAT'LL MAYBE HAVE FIVE LINKS AND A PICTURE ON IT AND THEN BECAUSE IT LINKS TO PAGE TWO AND PAGE THREE 
CAN YOU TELL WHAT THIS IS ABOUT 
YEAH SO I STARTED LOOKING AT UH GOOGLE PAGE RANK WHICH KINDA DOES THIS BY SAYING WELL 
THE LINKS GO THE OTHER WAY IT SAYS IF THIS PAGE IS ABOUT FISH OR IN GOOGLE 
THEY SAY IF THIS PAGE IS GOOD IN SOME WAY AND IT LINKS TO THESE OTHER PAGE 
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS THEN THAT PAGE IS MORE LIKELY TO BE GOOD 
AND IT'S JUST PAGE RANK IS JUST A SIMPLE ALGORITHM FOR DOING THIS OVER THE WHOLE BIG NETWORK 
SO I WANTED TO COMBINE THE TOPIC MODELS THAT TELL YOU BEFOREHAND WHAT YOU THINK THIS PAGE AND THIS PAGE OR BUT WITH THIS TO MAYBE GET A BETTER IDEA 
SO THE IDEA IS SAY YOU'VE GOT SOME TEXT ON A PAGE 
THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE PICTURE ABOUT WHAT IF WHAT THE PAGE IS REALLY ABOUT AND THE LINKS POINTING AT THAT PAGE ARE ALSO PART OF THE PICTURE 
SO I BASICALLY CAME UP WITH AN ALGORITHM THAT'S JUST A I IT PLUGS P. L. S. A. UH PLUGS PAGE RANK INTO P. L. S. I. 
RIGHT SO PAGE RANK YOU BASICALLY JUST DO UH SAY 
YOU BASICALLY TAKE THE HOW GOOD THIS PAGE IS WHICH IS X. AND HOW GOOD THIS PAGE IS WHICH IS Y. 
AND YOU THEN SAY THIS PAGE IS BASED ON UH HOW DO YOU DO THIS 
BASED ON THE THE LINKS COMING INTO IT UH IT'S JUST A LIKE A SUM OVER ALL THE THE LINKS OF UH WELL X. LINK I GUESS 
O OF OF THE VALUE 
UH UH THE BUT IT'S NOT IT'S 
YEAH 
IF IF SO IF THIS IS PAGE RANK OF X. PAGE RANK OF Y. 
I THINK THIS IS ROUGHLY IT OFF HAND 
PAGE RANK OF Z. 
SO YOU SAY PAGE RANK OF Z. IS EQUAL TO UH ONE OVER A CONSTANT TO NORMALISE IT 
UH SOME OVER ALL THE LINKS INTO Z. OF PAGE RANK 
OF THE LINK 
YEAH TH IT'S LIKE THAT YEAH 
SO SIMILAR IDEA 
IF YOU GOT A VECTOR THAT SAYS WHAT THE TOPICS ARE SAY YOU'VE LEARNED FROM P. L. S. A. A D A DISTRIBUTION OF TOPICS FOR EVERY PAGE 
SO IF YOU SAY A PROBABILITY OF TOPIC ONE FOR UH FOR PAGE UH Z. 
UH IS EQUAL IT AND YOU CAN USE THE SAME SORT OF THING 
RIGHT SO NICKING A WHOLE BUNCH OF MATHS FROM HOW YOU WORK OUT PAGE RANK UH IT COMES UP WITH UH JUST UH AN ITERATIVE ALGORITHM 
WHICH IS JUST UH THE CURRENT PROBABILITY OF TOPIC ONE GIVEN Z. SO THAT'S PROBABILITY OLD PLUS UH 
I YEAH PLUS THAT AND THEN YOU NORMALISE BETWEEN THEM AS YOU SAY ALPHA AND ONE MINUS ALPHA 
YEAH 
SO WE BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE ONE MINUS ALPHA SAY LINK CONTRIBUTION YOU CAN CALL THIS I GUESS 
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT A PAGE IS PARTLY FROM ITS TEXT THAT YOU'VE GOT ON THE PAGE AND IT'S PARTLY FROM WHAT THE LINKS SAY IT'S ABOUT 
SO THAT ALPHA THING IS HOW MUCH DO YOU TRUST THE TEXT ON THE PAGE AND HOW MUCH DO YOU TRUST THE LINKS 
SO THAT ALPHA COULD BE DIFFERENT FOR EVERY PAGE 
SO WHAT I DID THEN WAS TRY THIS IN A BIG DATABASE OF WEB PAGES 
UH AND I HAD SOME RESULTS FROM THAT BUT THEY WERE ALL IN TEMP TWO SO THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW 
UH BUT IS IT IS NOT REALLY IMPORTANT I CAN REGENERATE THAT 
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THIS GIVES YOU A NEW VECTOR OF TOPICS FOR EVERY PAGE 
SO YOU'VE GOT TWO VECTORS YOU'VE GOT THE ON THAT YOU'VE JUST GOT FROM P. L. S. A. OR WHATEVER MODEL AND YOU'VE GOT THE ON THAT YOU GET FROM THIS 
UH HOW DO YOU TELL WHICH ONE'S BETTER 
I HAD NO WAY TO EVALUATE THIS WILL 
HOW DO YOU TELL THAT THIS PAGE BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE TOPICS ARE 'CAUSE THEY'RE LEARNED AUTOMATICALLY UH SO 
IT IT IS YEAH BECAUSE UH B YEAH YOU INITIALISE IT WITH UH ACTUALLY THI THIS IS KINDA WRONG 
THIS IS NOT OLD BUT START THIS IS HOW YOU THIS IS HOW YOU YOU START IT OFF 
SO THIS THIS IS WHAT P. L. S. A. GIVES YOU TO START WITH AND THEN YOU ITERATE THIS AND IT BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S IT EXACTLY YEAH 
EXACTLY YEAH SO YOU'VE NOW GOT YOU'VE GOT P. L. S. A. GIVES YOU TWO PROBABILITIES RIGHT 
SO IT GIVES YOU A PROBABILITY OF A TOPIC GIVEN A DOCUMENT WHICH IS Z. GIVEN D. AND A PROBABILITY OF A WORD GIVEN A TOPIC 
SO THIS IS THE SAME FOR BOTH MODELS 
YEAH 
WELL YEAH WHAT YOU DO IS YOU'RE TAKING THIS AND ITERATING OVER TO THE PROBABILITY OF THE TOPIC GIVEN THE DOCUMENT 
UH S HAVE I MADE THAT COLOUR I'M I'M NOT SURE IF I'M EXPLAINING THIS WILL 
OKAY 
RIGHT SO YOU I YOU UM 
YEAH SO WE WERE STRUGGLING AT HOW DO YOU EVALUATE THIS 
BECAUSE UH I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THAT P. L. S. I. AND ALL THOSE KIND OF MODELS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED 
IT'S TH THEY NEVER QUANTITATIVE QUANTITATIVELY DO ANYTHING 
THEY ALWAYS SAY UH WILL LOOK AT THE CLUSTERING THERE'S HERE WE'VE GOT SOME DOCUMENTS THAT ALL APPEAR TO BE ABOUT THE SAME THING 
AND HERE'S WHERE WE GOT SOME OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT ALL APPEAR TO BE ABOUT THE SAME THING 
AND YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL EXACTLY HOW GOOD THAT AS YOU CAN JUST GOT AN IDEA THAT IT'S 
YEAH SO THA THAT'S THE FIRST THING TH THAT THING WHEN I SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THIS 
YOU SUGGESTED D USE THE LIKELIHOOD AND PEDRO CAME UP WITH A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE WHY THAT COULD BE BAD 
SO YOU HAVE UH 
YOU HAVE THE UH UH LET ME THING OF WHAT THIS WAS 
IT WAS TO DO WITH CARS BASICALLY IF YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A TOPIC THAT'S UH REPRESENTING 
COURSE AND YOU CAN TELL THAT THAT'S REPRESENTING CARS BY LOOKING AT THIS DISTRIBUTION AND IT'S THE SAME FOR BOTH 
NOW YOU WANNA TELL WHICH I I THIS PAGE UH PEDRO'S EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT WAS IS THAT IS SAYS ON THE PAGE LOTUS ELISE 
OKAY 
AND THAT UH ONE OF I CAN'T I JUST REMEMBER IT WAS A REALLY CAN YOU IG REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS 
NO OKAY 
YEAH I DIDN'T REALLY CONSIDER DOING IT ON PERPLEXITY ACTUALLY THAT TO BE HON BUT OKAY 
OKAY 
SO THAT FOR THOUGH BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WITH THIS TOPIC MODELS IS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW YOU CAN'T MAKE THEM CLUSTER 
OKAY 
HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND THAT IS IS THAT REALLY FAIR THOUGH 
CAN YOU SAY THAT OF A SET OF DOCUMENTS OF THE CLUSTERING OF THESE DOCUMENTS IS CLOSER TO THE EFFECTI WHAT YOU WHAT YOU'VE GOT THERE IS UH A CLUSTERING OF DOCUMENTS A AS YOUR DEVALUATION 
YEAH 
UH TH THOSE THOSE LABELS THE YAHOO CATEGORIES THAT'S THAT'S A CLUSTERING 
SO YOU'RE BY SAYING THAT THIS CLUSTERING IS CLOSER TO THAT CLUSTERING IS IS DOES THAT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT'S BETTER 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM OKAY 
MM 
WE UH I THINK YOUR POINT WAS THAT YOU YOU TURN THIS WITHOUT LABELLING FIRST YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
WELL TH YEAH 
THE THE THING THAT WORRIES ME ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT SAY THE REALLY REALLY REALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF THOSE WHERE YOUR DIRECTORY HAD TWO CATEGORIES IN IT 
OH GOOD AND BAD 
AND AND AND YOU RUN P. L. S. A. ON IT NOW THAT DOESN'T DO IT GOOD AND BAD IT DOES I DUNNO ENGLISH AND FRENCH PAGES 
SO THEY DON'T MATCH BUT THE CLUSTERING IS STILL VERY GOOD IN IN ONE RESPECT 
UH BUT BUT YOU YOU CAN EXTEND THAT UP EVEN IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED CATEGORIES 
P. L. S. A. CAN FIND A HUNDRED CLUSTERS THAT ARE A GOOD CLUSTERING BUT ARE COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO THE DIRECTORY 
HMM 
BUT BUT WHAT I WANNA KNOW I SEE THAT WHICH OF THEM HAS THE BETTER REPRESENTATION OF A GIVEN PAGE 
SO SO GIVEN A RANDOM PAGE UH AND THESE TWO MODELS UH AND THE W THE WORDS THAT THESE TWO MODELS GIVE WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO OKAY 
I'M I'M JUST N CONCERNED THAT THAT'S UH THAT THAT'S IT'S ANSWERING A QUESTION THAT EVALUATES IN SOME WAY BUT MAYBE NOT IN THE WAY THAT 
WELL THAT MAYBE NOT SO THE SAME WAY I WAS THINKING 
BUT MAYBE IT'S A BETTER WAY UM SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT SORRY I'M TRYING TO PROCESS ALL THIS 
OH 
YEAH I IT'S THE SAME THING LIKE IT IT DOES TELL YOU WHETHER THIS UH WHICH CLUSTERING IS BETTER FOR THIS TASK 
BUT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHICH CLUSTERING BETTER REPRESENTS THE PAGES NECESSARILY 
BUT IT IT'S IT YOU YOU COULD SAY THAT IT POSSIBLY DO IT PROBABLY DOES 
OKAY 
MM 
YEAH I 
MM 
OKAY 
MM 
I THINK MM 
OH NO I TH I'M I'M COMING ROUND IT IT ACTUALLY 
NO I'M SO I I I THINK I G UH I I GET IT 
UH I I TH I THINK IT PROBABLY AS FAR I'M JUST I I'VE GOTTEN UM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT 
BUT I THINK THAT'LL GI IF I THINK ABOUT IT ENOUGH 
UH BUT BUT YEAH THE IT IT BUT IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE SUSPECT 
BUT I THINK THAT'S JUST FROM THE WHOLE POINT THAT YOU CAN'T TELL WHICH CLUSTERING IS BE BETTER 
BUT UH WHAT I'D THOUGHT BEFORE WAS COULD YOU GET PEOPLE TO EVALUATE THIS BY BY HAND BASICALLY 
COULD YOU GIVE PEOPLE A SET OF PAGES AND LIKE SAY YOU DID IT WITH FIVE TOPICS FOR EXAMPLE 
UH NOW YOU GIVE PEOPLE FIVE SHEETS UH YOU GIVE UH A IT A A USER FIVE SHEETS OF PAPER EACH WITH 
WORDS IN VARYING SIZES REPRESENTING THE PROBABILITY OF THAT TOPIC FOR EXAMPLE 
TRY GIVE THE USER THESE PIECES OF PAPER TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT THESE TOPICS ARE THAT'S THIS P. OF W. GIVEN Z. 
AND THEN YOU GIVE THEM SOME PAGES AND SAY WHICH ONE WOULD YOU WHICH PIECE OF PAPER WOULD YOU PUT THAT WITH 
AND THEN YOU GOT LIKE AN INTUITIVE IDE UH LIKE HOW WOULD A PERSON CLUSTER PAGES GIVEN THE WHAT THESE TOPICS SUPPOSEDLY ARE 
'CAUSE I YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT'S FIXED THE THE P. OF W. GIVEN Z. WITH RESPECT TO BOTH MODELS 
SO I WAS TRUE I WAS HOPING YOU COULD USE THAT IT 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OKAY 
HMM 
OKAY 
SO 
THE THE THING ABOUT WEB PAGES I THOUGHT AS WELL IN THAT GETTING HUMANS TO EVALUATE IT IN SOME WAY IS THAT YOU HAVE MOST OF THE WEB PAGES THAT ARE UH WELL A LOT OF THE WEB PAGES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN SOME WAY OR OR OR HOME PAGES 
SO GOOGLE DOT COM DOESN'T ACTUALLY SAY THE WORDS SEARCH ON IT I THINK 
I MAYBE IT SAYS GO BUT YOU ONLY KNOW IT'S ABOUT SEARCH THROUGH THE THING ABOUT SOMEONE LOOKING AT IT CAN TELL THAT IT'S A SEARCH ENGINE 
BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT'S LAID OUT BECAUSE OF THE PICTURES ON IT AND BECAUSE OF ALL OF THAT 
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S COMPLETELY LOST IN THIS BAG OF WORDS REPRESENTATION AND I WAS HOPING THAT IN SOME WAY YOU COULD USE THAT TO EVALUATE THIS 
I HAVE AN IDEA HOW ABOUT UH YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
OKAY I THINK I KNOW IT 
BUT IT YEAH TH THIS IS EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE HAVE HERE THOUGH AND THE THAT DIRECTORY IS ONE CLUSTERING OF THE MARBLES 
AND YOU'RE HOPING THAT IT TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT I HAVE TWO CLUSTERINGS OF MARBLES FOR MY TWO MODELS 
AND I HAVE A TEST CLUSTERING OF MARBLES 
IT'S SAYING THAT ONE OF THIS IS MORE CLOSE TO THE TEST IT TO TO THE THE ON THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN 
SO THAT IT'S SAYING THAT WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY SAY 
THAT DOESN'T UH IT SAYS IT'S G BETTER FOR THIS TASK BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY SAY ANYTHING ELSE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UH AND SO AND SO IF I GET THAT RIGHT 
WHAT WHAT THE ALGORITHMS ARE STILL COMING UP WITH US IN THIS WAY YOU'RE LOOKING AT A CLUSTERING OF MARBLES YEAH 
OF EACH OF THE ALGORITHMS COMES UP WITH A DEFIN 
OH OKAY RIGHT THAT MAKES SENSE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
I'M CONVINCED I'M CONVINCED ALRIGHT 
SO IT'S GOOD 
RIGHT 
OH ALRIGHT WELL THANKS 
UM I'M TRYING TO THINK IF ANYTHING I HAVEN'T SAID ABOUT THE STUFF ABOUT THAT UH FROM LOOKING AT THE RESULTS I GET IT LOOKED QUITE GOOD 
UM JUST LIKE HAND READING THEM IN THAT ONE OF THE THINGS I DID WAS I STARTED A I A WEB CRAWL AT THE IDIAP HOMEPAGE 
IT DID NOT VERY MANY PAGES ONLY LIKE TWO THOUSAND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT ENOUGH TO GET THE PAGES THAT WERE CLOSE TO IDIAP TO HAVE A LOT OF LINKS BETWEEN THEM 
SO THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO RUN THIS LINK CLUSTERING ALGORITHM 
SO WHAT YOU FOUND IS THAT THE PAGES AROUND IDIAP THERE'S A LOT OF ENGLISH PA SPEAKING PAGES AND A LOT OF FRENCH SPEAKING PAGES 
SO OF COURSE THIS UH P. L. S. A. COMPLETELY SEPARATED THOSE IT INTO INTO CATEGORIES 
UH SO WHEN I LOOKED AT THE THE WORD LIKELIHOODS THERE WERE TWO TOPICS 
ONE WAS VERY CLEARLY ENGLISH WORDS THAT MOST LIKELY WORD WAS THE AND ONE WAS VERY CLEARLY FRENCH WORDS MOST LIKELY WORDS WAS D I THINK AND UH 
NO I HAD MANY TOPICS 
THE OTHERS LOOKED LIKE GARBAGE COULDN'T TELL WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
BUT ANYWAY UH TH THAT'S OFTEN THE CASE 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT YOU CAN TELL VERY CLEARLY THAT ONE OR TWO TOPICS ARE A B INTO THE REST YEAH 
IT IS 
OK 
HMM 
THAT WE UH ANYWAY THAT WHEN I RAN OUT ON THAT UH WHAT I FOUND WAS 
LOOKING THROUGH SOME OF THE SITES UH I LOOKED FOR THE SITES THAT THE MODELS DIFFERED ON 
THAT WHERE ONE SIDE IT WAS PROBABLY AN ENGLISH PHRASE AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS PROBABLY A FRENCH PHRASE 
AND I FIND A GOOD FEW EXAMPLES WHERE YOU HAD A SET THAT LOOKED UH WELL IN THAT I REMEMBER OFF HAND WAS IT WAS A PAGE AND IT WAS A BIG PICTURE 
AND LINKS DOWN THE SITE BUT THE LINKS WERE ALL PICTURES 
SO YOU COULDN'T THE THE WORDS WERE IN FRENCH AND THE LINKS BUT THERE WERE IN WORDS PICKED UP BY THE WHEN I DID THE CRAWL FOR THE MODEL 
AND THERE WAS A SMALL BIT DOWN HERE AND IN THIS THERE WAS UH MEANT TO BE PICTURE IN THERE 
BUT IT DIDN'T LOAD UH OUR UH B IT WAS MEANT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE 
AND IT SAID UH IN ENGLISH IT USED FOR A. FOR THIS PAGE CANNOT BE FOUND 
SO ALL THE WORDS IN THIS PAGE WERE ENGLISH BUT IT WAS VERY VERY CLEARLY A FRENCH PAGE 
SO THE FIRST MODEL SAID IT WAS IN ENGLISH PAGE 'CAUSE ALL THE WORDS WERE IN ENGLISH 
SECOND MODEL SAID VERY DEFINITELY A FRENCH PAGE BECAUSE ALL OF THESE POINTED OUT FRENCH SITES AND IT WAS ONLY POINTED OUT IT WAS SOMETHING DOT F. R. AS WELL 
IT'S 
YEAH 
SO I I FIND A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THAT WERE KINDA LIKE THAT 
MM BUT THE THE PROBLEM THAT I FOUND WHEN I RAN OUT 
UH THE THE THE THING THAT WAS A BAD POINT WAS THAT IF YOU HAVE UH SAY TRYIN I WAS TRYING TO SAY IF YOU COULD EVALUATE THIS WITH SEARCH GIVEN SOME KEYWORDS LIKE WHICH MODEL WOULD MORE LIKELY FIND YOU A P GOOD DOCUMENT 
THAT THAT SORT OF APPROACH 
UH WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT SAY YOU HAD UH 
UH TH TH THAT'S NOT TOO RELEVANT NECESSARILY BUT IF YOU HAVE SAY A TOPIC DISTRIBUTION FOR UH ONE PAGE 
AND IT VERY VERY HIGHLY SCORES IN THE P. L. S. A. FOR ONE OF THE THE TOPICS 
AND THAT'S RIGHT OKAY THIS MODEL BECAUSE IT'S AVERAGING IT OVER ALL THE PAGES NEARBY ALL OF THE TOPIC DISTRIBUTIONS BECOME MORE FLAT 
IT IT BECOMES MORE UNCERTAIN ABOUT EVERYTHING 
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S NECESSARILY A GOOD THING OR NOT YEAH 
IN IN SOME CASES IT'S GONNA BE A BAD THING B BECAUSE EV EVERY PAGE IS LINKED BY THE WAY THE ALGORITHM WORKS 
EVERY PAGE IS LINKED EVENTUALLY TO EVERYTHING ELSE IS IT EVERY PAGE HAS INFORMATION INCORPORATED IN IT 
OR I THE DISTRIBUTION LEARNED FOR EVERY PAGE HAS INFORMATION INCORPORATED IN IT FROM EVERY OTHER PAGE'S DISTRIBUTION AS WELL 
SO IT AVERAGES OUT IT FLATTENS ALL THE DISTRIBUTIONS DEPENDING ON WHAT THIS ALPHA IS 
MM-HMM 
WELL I I THINK THAT THE THING IS 
YEAH THAT THAT THERE'S A BALANCE IN THE UH FOR EXAMPLE TAKE A PAGE LIKE UH SLASHDOT 
AND IT'S LIKE A NEWS SITE UH FOR GEEKS AND YOU HAVE UH NERDS YEAH 
NEWS FOR NERDS STUFF THAT MATTERS 
UH ALL OF THE LIKE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES POINT TO THAT BUT THEY'RE ABOUT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS 
SO YOU IN EFFECT ARE LOSING INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THAT PAGE IS ABOUT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS POINTING AT IT AND THEY ALL AVERAGE TO USE 
YEAH SO THAT 
TH THAT'S MY FIRST DO WE WISE HOW I SET THIS I REMEMBER FOR THE LOTUS THING WASN'T THERE 
UM SO I THOUGHT YOU WANNA PROBABLY SET THIS ALPHA PER PAGE THERE'S PROBABLY SOME HEURISTICS 
FOR EXAMPLE THIS PAGE THERE'S NO TEXT ON IT WILL SET IT VERY LOW IN USER INFORMATION FOR THE LINKS 
PROBLEM IS THIS IS WHAT PEDRO IMMEDIATELY SAID WHAT IF YOU HAVE A PAGE THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS 
IT'S GOT A BIG PICTURE OF A CAR UH 
ANYWAY AND IT SAYS LOTUS ELISE SO YOU KNOW THAT IT'S DEFINITELY ABOUT CAR BUT IT'S ONLY GOT TWO WORDS 
SO YOU CAN'T JUST DO IT BY WORDS BECAUSE THESE TWO WORDS COMPLETELY SPECIFY INTO SOMETHING OR THREE 
UH SO YOU SUGGESTED DOING LIKELIHOOD BUT IT THAT TIME AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT MY PROBLEM WAS WITH THAT 
IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING BUT YOU'VE GOT TWO LIKELIHOODS FOR IT AS WELL 
NO MAYBE NOT 
MM 
YEAH MAYBE DO IT BY CROSS VALIDATION SOMETHING 
OKAY THERE'S 
HMM 
YEAH THAT THAT AS FAR 
YEAH OKAY 
IT YEAH D 
NO 
YEAH I SEE UH I I THINK THAT THAT'S IT EASY 
YOU CAN DO IT WITH SOME HEURISTICS AND YOU CAN LEARN IT FROM THE TASK RESULTS ON OR COMBINE THE TWO SO THA THAT'S KINDA STRAIGHTFORWARD I THINK 
YEAH 
THE THE THE THING ABOUT DOING IT THROUGH CROSS VALIDATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WITH THE TASK IS UH THE PROBLEM WITH DOING A PAGE RANK STYLE ALGORITHM IS THAT IS THAT IT GETS BETTER TO IT CONVERGES BETTER AND IT GIVES YOU BETTER RESULTS 
THE CLOSER A NETWORK IS IT BEING A SMALL WORLD NETWORK 
SO SMALL WORLD NETWORK MEAN BASICALLY SOME FAR LINKS BUT GENERALLY VERY CLUSTERED LOCALLY 
UH NOW THE THING ABOUT DOING A WEB CRAWL IS THE BIGGER YOUR WEB CRAWL 
THE CLOSER IT'LL BE AT THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE NOT IN THE INTERNET WHICH IS A SMALL WORLD NETWORK 
THE SMALLER YOUR WEB CRAWL THE LESS SMALL WORLD NETWORK LIKE IT'S GONNA BE 
SO THE MORE PAGES YOU GET THE BETTER YOUR RESULTS 
AND PEOPLE RUNNING THIS STYLE OF ALGORITHM THE PAGE RANK STYLE STUFF GENERALLY RUN IT IN ABOUT TWO MILLION EURO TWENTY MILLION PAGES OR WHATEVER 
THE THE STANFORD WEB BASE DATA SET THAT I WAS USING FOR THIS FOR FOR A BIT OF THIS UM 
THEY HAVE A A D I CAN'T REMEMBER OFF HAND 
BUT THEY HAVE UM MAYBE A BIT OVER A THETA BYTE WORTH OF WEB PAGES ON THIS A BUNCH OF SERVERS 
OH 
YEAH MAYBE WIKIPEDIA IS A GOOD THING TO DO 
WAS I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WIKIPEDIA THOUGH WAS THAT IT'S WHILE IT HAS A HIGH LEVEL OF INSIDE LINKS THAT HAS A LOT OF DIRECTORY STYLE LINKS AS WELL THAT MIGHT MESS UP TO ACTUALLY BEING A SO WH WHILE YOU HAVE 
OH OKAY THAT'S GOOD 
THAT PLUS I GUESS IT'S ACTUALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO SAY TO START WITH IS THIS A SMALL WORLD NETWORK AND THEN RUN IT IN THAT 
YOU WERE RUNNING THAT ON WHAT WE WHAT WAS IT LIKE HALF A MILLION PAGES SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO IT AND THAT WAS FOR HALF OF IT 
UH IF I REMEMBER 
OKAY 
OKAY THE WHOLE THING WAS 
MM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
I MEAN I THINK OFF HAND THINKING ABOUT THIS MODEL IT WOULD HAVE TO WORK BETTER BECAUSE TWO THINGS IN THE SAME CATEGORY ARE GOING TO BE LINKED 
SO IT IT YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S I THINK TH IT'S GONNA BE MORE TRUE IN SOME NETWORKS AND IN SOME TASKS THAN OTHERS 
AND I THINK IN THE WIKIPEDIA IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE IT'S A GOOD ONE TO TEST NO 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH IT I'LL MAYBE I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THE WIKIPEDIA STUFF ANYWAY 
I'M STUCK DOING SOMETHING ELSE FOR THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO ANYWAY SO 
UH THIS IS ALWAYS THE CASE 
UH TH THERE'S ANOTHER THING UM UH THIS WAS NEW BUT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THIS TOO MUCH 
BUT IT'S IN THE SAME LINES IN THAT UH HAVE HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THOSE UH CORRELATED TOPIC MODELS WORK 
CORRELATED TOPIC MODELS 
IT'S DAVID BLEI THE GUY THAT CAME UP WITH UH WITH L. D. A. 
HE'S GOT UH A NEW MODEL THAT'S IT'S PUBLISHED IN NIPS THIS YEAR BUT HIS CO AUTHOR PUT IT IN THEIR WEB SITE A MONTH OR TWO AGO 
SO UH YOU KNOW L. D. A. 
DO YOU ALL KNOW L. D. A. OR YEAH 
OH OKAY 
IS A L. D. A. YOU BASICALLY DRAW A A DIRICHLET WHICH SAYS LIKE WHAT TYPE OF DOCUMENT THIS IS EFFECTIVELY 
AND THEN YOU DRAW A TOPIC GIVEN THAT DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION AND THEN YOU DRAW WORDS GIVEN THAT 
ALRIGHT WELL THAT'S FOR FOR EVERY WORD AND THAT'S NICE FOR THE DOCUMENT AND THAT'S YOU'VE GOT A PARAMETER COMING OUT THIS GLOBALLY 
SO THAT THAT'S ROUGHLY WHAT THE MODEL IS PLUS OTHER LITTLE BITS 
BUT ANYWAY SO WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY THEY REWORKED THIS BECAUSE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH L. D. A. 
AND I THINK P. L. S. A. HAS THIS PROBLEM AS WELL ONE IS THAT UH THE MORE TOPICS YOU HAVE 
THE LESS UH EXPRESSIVE IT CAN BE 
BECAUSE THE TOPICS IT CLUSTER AT IT PUSHES A DOCUMENT OF IT IS PULLING A DOCUMENT INTO ONE TOPIC IT PUSHES ANOTHER TOPIC AWAY FROM THAT 
DOESN'T THAT MAKE SENSE 
SO THE TOPICS ARE NECESSARILY TRYING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER 
SO THE MORE TOPICS YOU HAVE THE MORE TH THEY'RE SORT OF SQUEEZING INTO THE SPACE OF WHAT THINGS CAN BE BUT UH AND THINGS ARE KINDA PUSHED IT 
SO ONCE YOU UM GO OVER YOU TRY TO ONE CORPUS 
AND ONCE YOU GO OVER ABOUT A HUNDRED MAYBE TWO HUNDRED TOPICS 
UH THE THE NEW YOU ADD MORE TOPICS AND IT DOESN'T GET BETTER IN ANY WAY THE MODEL DOESN'T 
THE N NEW TOPICS ARE EFFECTIVELY GOING TO JUST BE GARBAGE 
OH ALRIGHT SO WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY THEY THEY STOPPED USING THE DIRICHLET AND UH THEY'RE STARTING TO USE UH A GAUSSIAN THERE 
SO IT IT ON TO SPARE THE DETAILS BASICALLY THEY'VE THEY'VE GOT A VARIABLE HERE 
I THINK THEY CALL IT TO UH AND THEY FROM THIS GENERATE A DISTRIBUTION OF TOPICS IN SOME WAY 
BUT IT'S GENERATED FROM A GAUSSIAN SPACE FROM A FROM A A SPACE SO IT'S GIVEN A A MENU AND COVARIANCE UH AND 
YEAH UH SO WHAT IT DOES THE THIS IS THE THE ABOUT THAT TOOK ME FOREVER TO UNDERSTAND ACTUALLY UH SOME MODEL 
BUT THIS IS GIVEN A GAUSSIAN SPACE IT MAPS THAT DOWN INTO THE SIMPLEX OF WHAT A TOPIC CAN BE BUT 
THE USE THE SIMPLEX BASICALLY IF YOU'VE GOT A SAY YOU'VE GOT TWO TOPICS 
NOW SAY I I SAY YOU GOT THREE TOPICS THAT MAKES MORE EASIER TO DRAW 
UH FOR THIS IS THAT IN THAT TWO THAT THERE 
THESE ARE THE PROBABILITIES THAT THAT A DOCUMENT IS ABOUT UH THIS THAT ONE IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS ABOUT TOPIC ONE 
THAT TWO SO SO THESE GUYS ALL HAVE TO ADD UP TO N YEAH 
UH SO THAT BASICALLY MEANS THAT WHAT A DOCUMENT IS BUT ALSO IN THIS SPACE BETWEEN THEM YEAH 
SO THIS IS THE SIMPLEX 
UH SO BASICALLY A DISTRIBUTION GENERATED BY THIS GUY IS BASICALLY A POINT IN THIS SIMPLEX 
SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY'VE GOT A DISTRIBUTION THAT MAPS UH A GAUSSIAN AND SOME SPACE INTO A DISTRIBUTION ON THIS THING 
SO IT MAPS IT INTO GAUSSIAN IN THAT 
THE COOL THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT TWO GAUSSIANS YOU CAN TELL HOW CLOSE THEY ARE 
SO YOU CAN NOW TELL HOW CLOSE TWO TOPIC DISTRIBUTIONS ARE RIGHT 
SO YOU CAN HAVE SO MANY AS YOU LIKE UH AND YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY'RE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER 
SO THERE'S LOAD OF IDEAS THAT I HAD ABOUT THIS UH IN THAT IF YOU CAN TELL THAT TWO TOPIC DISTRIBUTIONS ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER 
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SPLIT A DOCUMENT INTO TWO PARTS AND SAID THAT THE TWO PARTS HAVE TO BE CLOSE IN THE DISTRIBUTION 
YOU CAN SEE HOW THE DICE AT THE DOCUMENT CHANGES FOR EXA STU STUFF BASED ON THAT 
WITH THIS IDEA WHAT IF RATHER THAN WORKING WITH THIS P. OF Z. GIVEN D. THING THAT YOU HAD FROM P. L. S. I. 
BUT WHAT IF YOU WORKED FROM THESE GAUSSIANS THAT YOU GET FOR EVERY DOCUMENT AND YOU SAID THAT IN SOME SOME FUNCTION THAT SIDE UH THAT THE GAUSSIAN REPRESENTING THIS SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE ONES LINKING TO IT 
NOW I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT ANY OF THE MATHS FOR THIS 
BUT BUT IT SHOULD BE UH STRAIGHTFORWARD I GUESS IT TO FORMULATE A BASIC IN TERMS OF THE MAIN SHOULD BE SIMILAR AND THE COVARIANCE MAYBE SHOULD BE SIMILAR AS WELL 
SO IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A BETTER MODEL AGAIN 
I DUNNO 
I'LL SEND YOU GUYS THE LINK FOR THAT CORRELATED TOPIC MODEL STUFF IF YOU WANT BUT UH I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TOO INTERESTING TO YOU 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT WELL THEN THANKS FOR HEARING ME IT AND THE IDEA ESPECIALLY 
MAYBE I CAN DO MORE WITH THIS 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH B 
BASTIEN YOU CAN'T RELEASE THIS DATA FOR FOUR MONTHS 
SO SO IT CORRECT OR NO 
HMM 
YEAH 
WELL SO WE HOPE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
UH THIS IS IS FROZEN FROZEN OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
PERPLEXITY UH 
YEAH 
UH ONE OR NO I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE THE YOU SAID I WOULD TELL YOU THAT EVALUATION SHOULD BE DONE BASED ON LIKELIHOOD OR PERPLEXITY 
WELL IT'S B YEAH IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME BUT 
I DUNNO 
YEAH ANOTHER TASK OR 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
NO NO NO I NO NO NO NO IT'S DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT IF IF YOU USE THE LATENT REPRESENTATIONS OR DISTRIBUTION OVER ASPECTS 
YOU COULD USE THIS TO SAVE TWO DOCUMENTS UH IN THE SAME DIRECTORY OR NOT 
AND THIS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THEN 
UM 
YEAH 
CLEARLY WHA W WE HAD DONE THIS 
YOU CAN TRAIN AFTER THAT UH AN S. V. M. SAYING THIS IS CATEGORY ONE OR TWO ON THE LABEL DOCUMENT 
AND THEN WE WILL HAVE AN UNLABELLED DOCUMENT AND YOU JUST SAY THIS IS DIRECTORY ONE OR TWO 
AND IF IT SHOULD IMPROVE IT IF YOU SAY THIS FEATURE EXTRACTION PROCESS IS BETTER THAN YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER CLEANER SEPARATION BETWEEN THESE TWO 
YEAH WELL BUT 
YEAH WELL BUT I MEAN IF YOU HAVE TO JUDGE IT'S WITH RESPECT TO A GIVEN TASK 
I MEAN YOU CAN'T SAY OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS GOOD BECAUSE IT'S MAXIMISING THE LIKELIHOOD OF WHATEVER 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH IT'S THE SAME 
MM-HMM 
FUS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY WAY TO SAY GENERALLY THIS THIS IS BETTER OR WORSE 
YEAH 
IT HAS TO BE OR IT HAS TO BE REALLY IT WITH RESPECT TO THIS THIS CLUSTERING MAKES SENSE OR I DUNNO 
YEAH 
YOU CAN E EVEN KEEP THE BIG OF WORDS AND DO THE COSINE COMPARISON OR 
JUST SHOWING JUST SHOWING HOW JUST FIRST HOW BETTER THIS IS WITH RESPECT TO BAG OF WORDS AND HOPEFULLY THEN HOW YOU NOW UH REGULARISED P. L. Z. GIVEN D. S 
I DUNNO JUST UH YEAH IT'S BASIC 
MM-HMM 
BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH JUST KNOW WHERE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
NO IT DOES 
YEAH 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MATCH 
YEAH 
BUT YEAH IT JUST OR 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BECAUSE THE THE LATENT ASPECTS REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO MATCH THE FINAL UH DIRECTORY CATEGORY 
IT CAN BE ANYTHING BUT IT'S JUST A WAY OF SAYING YEAH THOSE DOCUMEN DOCUMENTS ARE SIMILAR IN SOME SENSE 
SO 
SO IT JUST TO JUST SOMETIME DANGEROUS TO SAY THE THESE LATENT ASPECTS MEANS THIS 
YEAH I THINK YEAH 
GOOD GOOD GOOD 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AND THE OTHERS USUALLY DON'T MEAN ANYTHING YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
FOR YOUR MODEL MM GOOD 
NERD 
NERD 
MM 
YEAH CARS AND WEB 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WHICH ONES UH 
NO NO 
HMM 
OKAY 
WELL IN IN THREE MONTHS 
OH YEAH IT'S TOO LATE THREE MONTHS 
WE SHOULD WAIT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
IT IS THE INITIALISATION OF 
YEAH 
BUT THEN IT IS ITERATIVE 
OKAY 
SO YOU YOU SHOULD FIRST TRAIN THE P. L. S. A. STUFF THEN YOU INITIALISE THIS LINK UH SPREADING THING AND THEN YOU ITERATE OVER OKAY 
AND IT CONVERGE AND SO YOU HAVE THE BEST UH INITIAL P. L. S. I. AND P. L. S. A. PLUS THE LINK THING THEN 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
SO THE YEAH Y Y YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO EVALUATE THAT NOW 
YEAH RIGHT 
HMM 
BUT BUT MAYBE YOU YOU COULD HAVE SOME SOME OTHER LABELLI LI OR THE TASK LIKE IF IF YOU IMAGINE YOU HAVE SOME LABELLING ONE OF OF THE WEB PAGES LIKE LIKE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU YOU LOOK AT IT IT IT IT A SET OF PAGES 
AND YOU HAVE THE UM THE DIRECTORY ENTRIES OF THESE PAGES SO EASE OF LIKE YEAH OR ENTRIES 
SO YOU HAVE CATEGORIES AND AND ENTRIES SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE I DUNNO CARS S. I. V. ETCETERA 
SO WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE WOULD BE THAT TWO PAGES ON ON THE SAME UM CATEGORY SHOULD BE CLOSER THAN THAN TWO PAGES BEING SPREAD ACROSS DIFFERENT CATEGORIES 
BUT YOU YOU WOULD NOT SO THIS YOU WILL NOT SO THE YAHOO DIRECTORY OR IN THE DIRECTORY IN THE TRAINING STEP IF I IF THE MODEL OKAY 
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE JUST FOR EVALUATION 
AND THEN FOR EXAMPLE Y Y YOUR TASK WOULD BE TO SAY I HAVE SOME PAGE AND AND I KNOW WHERE IT IS IN THE ON THE ON THE DIRECTORY 
AND I HAVE ANOTHER PAGE I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO TO KNOW UH WHETHER IT IS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE FIRST ONE 
JUST BY COMPARING THEIR UH ASPECTS 
IF THEY HAVE THE SAME UH YEAH 
SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHECK IF IS IS IS THERE SOME SIMILARITY IN THE ON THE ON THE ASPECT DISTRIBUTION 
TELLS ME UH SOMETHING ABOUT UH THE SAME THE THE FACT THAT THEY COULD BE IN THE SAME CATEGORY IN THE THE THIS AND END LABEL CATEGORIES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
NO NO NO NO NO 
HOW WOULD 
SO SO SO W WHAT WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAVE BASICALLY WOULD BE TO HAVE A DIRECTORY WHICH GIVE YOU LABELS FOR SOME PART OF THE DOCUMENTS 
OKAY SO THIS IS A DIRECTORY AND THIS IS SOME SOME SOME SOME WEB PAGE OKAY 
SO THE LABELLED ONE OKAY 
AND YOU HAVE SOME PAGE WHICH ARE UNLABELLED BUT YOU HAVE LINKS BETWEEN THESE TWO 
SO WHAT WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS THAT YOU WOULD TRY AND P. L. S. I. AND AND UH AND AS A MODEL OVER THAT 
THEN THEN YOU WOULD LIKE IT FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IF WHAT COULD BE VERY SIMPLE WOULD BE JUST TO THEN TO MATCH EACH PAGES LIKE THAT 
SO LET'S SAY YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A A PAGE WHICH IS LABELLED AND YOU SAY OKAY 
THE THE LABEL PAGE TWO SHOULD GET SHOULD BE THE ONE W WHICH IT IS THE MOST SIMILAR TO OR ANY KIND OF CLASSIFICATION RULES YOU CAN IMAGINE 
AND SO AND SO YOU SAY OKAY 
WHAT WHAT'S IF I FROM FROM THIS PAGE WHICH HAVE THE SIMILAR IS IS THE THE CRITERION WOULD BE TO COMPARE THOSE TWO DISTRIBUTION 
OKAY AND THEN AND THEN YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASSIGN TO THIS DOCUMENT IT WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW THE LABELS THE SAME ONE IS THIS ONE 
AND AND HERE THAT YOU USE ONLY FOR TEST SO THIS IS YOUR 
THEN YOU CAN EVALUATE HOW WRONG YOU OR OR CU HOW CLOSE YOU ARE FROM THE REAL ASSIGNMENT THE RIGHT DIRECTORY CATEGORY 
NO THIS WAY I THINK IT'S FOR IF YOU KN IF YOU KNOW ONLY IF YOU KNOW ONLY THAT AND THAT AND WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DISCOVER IS THIS 
THIS IS A OR LIKE A REAL TASK 
LIKE LIKE IF IF IF THIS DIRECTORY UH UH COMPANY WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND THIS DIRECTORY AT NEW PAGES WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF HAVING HUMAN LABELLING 
YEAH YOU HAVE TO YOU USE THIS ONE 
YOU YOU ONLY HAVE THE LABELS FOR SOME UH SMALL PART OF THE 
SO 
SO YOU YOU WOULD TURN IT YOU THIS IS THIS IS IT AT ALL ALL THOSE LINKS ARE KNOWN 
THE LINKS BETWEEN SOME LABELLED DOCUMENT AND UNLABELLED DOCUMENT 
I D I THINK YOU CAN DO IT IS A TWO STEP PROCESS 
FIRST YOU YOU TURN UH WELL MAYBE IS IT WE COULD BE BETTER IF IF IF YOU TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT 
BUT BUT MAYBE YOU CAN YOU CAN DO JUST A TWO STEP PROCESS FIRST ONE YOU HAVE THIS UH UNSUPERVISED TASK OVER BOTH P. L. AND P. U. 
AND THEN YOU FROM THESE UNSUPERVISED STARTS YOU CAN KNOW WHICH DOCUMENT OF P. L. IS CLOSE FROM THE DOCUMENT OF P. U. OR THE REVERSE 
AND YOU CAN INFER SOME LABEL TO A DOCUMENT OF P. L. 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT BUT HERE YOU CAN YOU YOU SAY GIVEN A RANDOM PAGE OF P. U. WHICH OF THESE TWO MODEL IS MORE LIKELY TO TO TO TO TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE THE PAGE OF P. L. WHICH IS THE MOST SIMILAR 
SO YOU USE IS FROM THIS IS YOU TAKE ANY DISTRIBUTION COMPARISON THINGS 
SO SO HOFFMANN IN HIS PAPER WAS DOING JUST COSINE SIMILARITY BUT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING 
SO SO YOU JUST COMPARE UH THESE TWO DISTRIBUTIONS EASE OF D. ON AND D. TWO OKAY 
AND SO WITH THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN DETERMINE FOR EXAMPLE FOR A DOCUMENT O OF THE SET TWO AT THE MOST SIMILAR 
SO Y Y Y YOU SELECT D. ONE IS IN THIS SET WHICH IS THE MOST SIMILAR TO D. TWO ACCORDING TO THE DISTRIBUTION FROM ONE OR THE OTHER MODEL 
AND THEN AND THEN FOR THIS DOCUMENT YOU AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGN TO TO THE LABEL OF THE DOCUMENT UH NO 
AND YOU CHECK WITH THIS WHICH IS YOUR UH YOUR YOUR IF YOU ARE RIGHT OR NOT 
THIS IS WHAT WHAT THIS IS VERY RELATED TO WHAT FRANK DID WITH THE WITH THE KEYWORD UH IMAGE ANNOTATION 
SO YOU WOULD HAVE A SET OF KEYWORDS THE SET OF IMAGE LABEL WITH KEYWORDS AND UH HAS A SET OF UNLABELLED IMAGE WITH SOME 
AND IT WOULD CHECK WHETHER THE THE LABEL HE ASSIGNS SO ON THIS CASE ANNOTATION WORD UH ARE CORRECT 
AND I THINK IT'S FOR UH IT'S FOR UH STEP 
SO MAYBE THIS CLASSIFICATION RULE IS NOT THE BEST 
THERE THERE'S SOME MIGHT BE SOME WORK TO DO ABOUT THE GENERAL IDEA I THINK IT'S IT'S FAIR EVALUATIONS IT'S A TASK 
THAT CAN BE DEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO BUT ACCORDING TO THIS DIRECTORY YEAH 
YEAH 
I I I THINK IT'S W 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT'S GOOD WITH THE DIRECTORY IS THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD COVERAGE OF VARIOUS TOPIC HUMANS HUMANS CAN LABEL 
BUT THEN IF YOU WANT TO DETECT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THIS IS ANOTHER TASK 
I THINK THE TASK OF THESE LATENT MODEL IS TO DISCOVER SOME SOME SEMANTIC LIKE SOME TOPIC PROXIMITY BETWEEN DOCUMENTS 
AND HERE THIS LA THIS DIRECTORY IS DOING THE SAME THING LIKE ASSOCIATING SOME TOPICS WITH SOME DOCUMENTS MANUALLY 
SO COMPARING THEM IS IS IS IS GOOD SETUP WITH RESPECT TO THE GOAL 
I COMPARE THOSE TWO LIKE THE P. L. S. I. AND THE ONE OVER THIS SAME TASK OF ASSIGNING GOOD DIRECTORY 
I DON'T KNOW IF IF IT IF IT WILL PROVIDE GOOD RESULT RESULT OR NOT BUT IT IS CLEARLY A BENCHMARK FOR THESE TWO GOALS 
NO NO THE INFRA YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
LIKE BAG O YEAH 
YEAH YOU CAN HAVE TREE SETUPS UH YEAH 
YEAH BASIC COSINE OVER THE P. OF T. GIVEN D. S OVER ALL THESE UH EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTION 
AND THE TWO UH ASPECT UH MODELS 
WE HAVE TO REPEAT OVER AND OVER 
THIS IS LIKE ADVERTISEMENT 
NO NO IT'S JOKE 
NO IT'S JUS 
YEAH YEAH 
THIS IS REALLY YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE Z. THE THE THE ASPECT LIKE THE Z. ARE ARE ARE COME UNSUPERVISELY 
IT'S IT'S MORE LIKE IF YOU WERE GIVING THE PEOPLE YOU YOU SAID TO THEM OKAY 
UH DIVIDE ME THIS BUNCH OF DOCUMENTS INTO FIVE TOPICS AND YOU DON'T GIVE THEM THE TOPICS A PRIORI YOU KNOW 
SO THE TWO PERSON COULD COME UP WITH VERY DIFFERENT ONE IS VERY INTERESTING I NO 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
SO I I THINK I THINK IT'S YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT EVE EV EVEN SOMEONE WOULD WOULD PROVIDE VERY DIFFERENT LABELS LIKE LIKE SOMEONE WOULD SAY IT'S A PAGE IN ENGLISH 
SOMEONE WOULD SAY IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A WEB PAGE UH WH WHICH HAS VERY FEW UH INFORMATION ON IT OR ANYTHING 
SO I THINK THERE'S NO HARD CLUSTERING 
AND WHAT'S GOOD WITH THIS MODEL IS THAT THEY THEY CAN THEY THEY ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE YOU SOME SOME KIND OF WAY TO COMPARE TWO DOCUMENTS RATHER THAN TO GIVE YOU PRE DEFINED SETS OF DOCUMENTS 
THIS IS NOT HARD CLUSTERING 
THE O I I DON'T THINK IN IN ONE ASPECT OR ONE LATENT TOPIC HAS ANY SENSE BY HIS OWN 
IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE THE WORD SET AND THE WORD DISTRIBUTION THAT YOU C YOU CAN TELL SOMETHING 
IF YOU JUST TAKE ONE OF THEM ALONE 
SO YOU TAKE ALL THE P. OF Z. GIVEN D. AND ALL OF THE P. OF W. GIVEN GIV GIVEN Z. YOU YOU YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH THAT 
IT'S IT'S THE WHOLE SET 
I WOULD SAY IN ONE AND THIS IS UH IT IT SHOULD BE EVALUATED 
MEANING THAT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE UH THE THE EXAMPLE ABOUT MARBLES IS THAT THE POINT WHAT YOU CAN LEARN FROM ALL THESE SETS MADE BY PEOPLE USE THAT IS THAT THESE TWO THOSE TWO MARBLE WOULD BE CONSIDER IS MORE LIKELY TO BE IN THE SAME SETS 
BECAUSE THEY THEY SHARE SOME COMMON PROPERTIES WHICH ARE NOT SOON AS THE SAME FOR EVERY ONE 
BUT THEY SHARE SOME COMMON PROPERTIES THAT PEOPLE WILL NOTICE 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE TWO THE D ALL POSSIBLE PAIRS OF MARBLE 
YOU WOULD HAVE SOME MU MUCH MORE AGREEMENT BETWEEN PEOPLE THAN THAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE PREDEFINED SETS PEOPLE WOULD WOULD JUST CUT OUT SOME PRECISE UH POINT 
YOU KNOW WHAT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL YOU DON'T YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TWO CLUSTERING NO NO NO NO YOU DON'T YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TWO CLUSTERING 
NO NO NO NO YOU DON'T HAVE TWO CLUSTERING OF OF OF MARBLES 
WHAT YOU HAVE SO YOU SEE YOU HAVE SO YOU HAVE ONE CLUSTERING OF MARBLE WHICH IS THIS ONE 
AND THEN YOU HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE TELLING YOU I CONSIDER THOSE MARBLES IS VERY UH HAVE TO HAVE VERY SALIENT FEATURE THAT THEY SHARE IN COMMON 
I I C I WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE IN THE SAME CLUSTER 
AND YOU C AND AND AND THESE TWO S AND ONE OF THEM IS LABELLED AND THE OTHER IS NOT LABELLED 
SO YOU LOOK AT THAT YOU SAY UH SOMEONE TOLD THIS ONE WAS VERY SIMILAR 
AND THIS ONE IS USED TO BE ABLE FOR EXAMPLE I DUNNO IF IT'S THE LABEL 
SO I PUT IT IN THE BLUE BAG 
BUT BUT YOU DON'T YOU NEVER USE THE BLUE BAG YOU DON'T ASK THE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE BLUE BAG 
YOU JUST LOOK AT THE PEOPLE YOU YOU JUST HAVE THE PEOPLE TO COMPARE THOSE TWO MARBLES 
AND THEN IT HAPPENS THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN CLUSTERED 
AND AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THIS IS I REVERSE BOTH ROLE 
TH THIS IS THE PLAYERS 
I I NO NO NO NO NO 
IT COMES UP WITH NOT WITH THE CLUSTERING BUT WITH SOME WAY TO COMPARE TWO MARBLES OKAY 
SOME WOULD SAY WOULD SAY I CONSIDER THOSE TWO ONES ARE COMPLETELY DISSIMILAR AND THE OTHER ONES SAY THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR 
AND IF YOU FIND THAT IN YOUR UNL UNLABELLED CLUSTERING THOSE TWO UH BALLS UH MARBLES HAPPEN TO BE IN THE SAME UH CLUSTER 
YOU SAID THE USER ALGORITHM MIGHT BE WRONG 
BUT YOU AVERAGE THAT OVER LOTS OF DOCUMENTS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THEY MAKE SENSE ONLY USE GLOBAL OPTIMISATION THE LIKELIHOOD IS OPTIMISABLE GLOBALLY OVER THE WHOLE ASPECTS ETCETERA 
SO IT'S IT'S YOU NEVER ASK THE MODEL TO DO HARD CLUSTERING OF DOCUMENTS 
YOU JUST UH ASK UH TO TO FIND A DISTRIBUTION OVER ASPECTS SUCH THAT A DOCUMENT UH IS MORE LIKELY ACCORDING TO THE RESTRICTION THAT THE NUMBER ASPE ASPECT IS LIMITED 
AND AND SO AT THE IT JUST MAKES SENSE IN THE UH LOOKING AT THE WHOLE SET 
SO YOU I THINK ALL EVALUATION SHOULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND LOOK AT THE WHOLE ASPECT SET 
LIKE HERE YOU LOOK AT THE ASPECT SET BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT THE SIMILARITY OF TWO DISTRIBUTION 
IN ANY ST ANY KIND OF THING YOU WHERE YOU UN UNFOLD THE MODEL AND LOOK AT IT MANUALLY 
LOOKS WEIRD LIKE LIKE IN THOSE HOFFMANN PAPERS WHERE SHOW YOU COLUMNS WITH WORDS ARE THINGS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT ALSO IT DEPENDS ON THAT COULD BE A GOOD EFFECT 
BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU CAN BE IF YOU CAN IF YOU ARE UH HIGHLY RELIABLE ABOUT ONE PAGE 
BUT ALL THE PAGE LINKING TO TO OUR ACTUALLY BUT VERY DIFFERENT TOPICS 
SO YOU COULD SAY MAYBE I WAS WRONG FROM DECIDING ONLY DUE TO THE TEXT THAT THIS PAGE WAS ABOUT THIS ASPECT DISTRIBUTION 
BECAUSE BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PAGES ARE VOTING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTION 
WHILE THERE'S A BALANCE 
HMM 
YEAH 
PEDRO'S ALWAYS SPEAKS ABOUT CARS 
BUT I THINK FOR ANY KIND OF WAY YOU HAVE TO SELECT THOSE ALPHA YOU YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE EFFECT ON ON THE OR IN THE T EVALUATION TASK 
AND THEN MAYBE YOU CAN FIND SOME PATTERNS THAT ARE THEN THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THE ONCE YOU HAVE THE TASK 
YOU COULD LOOK AT AT WHICH PAGES ARE COMPLETELY MISSED BY ONE MODEL 
WHICH OTHERS ARE ARE SUCCESSFUL WITH ONE MODEL AND AND YOU CAN MAYBE INFER SOME SOME RULES AFTERWARDS 
BUT IF YOU HAVE NO TASK YOU CAN UH BLINDLY SELECT IS GOOD ALPHAS 
LIKE LIKE IF IF YOU LOOK AT UH IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR TASK AND YOU SEE THAT I DUNNO UH 
THE THE LONG PAGES FOR EXAMPLE HAVE GOOD P. L. S. A. MODEL WITHOUT FUSING LINKS 
SO THEN YOU CAN INFER SOME HEURISTICS LIKE OKAY THE ALPHA SHOULD BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE LENGTHS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
OR AT THE NUMBER OF IMAGE ON THE PAGES OR ANYTHING 
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME SOME TASK WHERE YOU CAN INDIVIDUALLY LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE ON EVERY ON EVERY PAGE 
AND AND AND AND IT IS A SECOND STEP YOU COULD INFER SOME KIND OF RULE ABOUT HOW TO SELECT ALPHAS WITH RESPECT TO THE TASK 
MAYBE IT'S V IT'S VERY SIMPLE RULES ABOUT SELECT THEM BLINDLY S MIGHT BE DEAD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT BUT BUT STILL LI LIKE THE THE THE WORK I DID ON ON HYPERLINKS LIKE I SAID UH WIKIPEDIA 
I I THINK IT'S G BECAUSE IT HAS FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL OF INSIDE LINKS BETWEEN 
YEAH 
WELL YOU CAN CATEGORISE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE IT'S THERE'S A STRUCTURE IN THE ON THE WEB PAGE 
SO YOU YOU CAN SELECT ONLY THE LINKS WHICH ARE WITHIN THE ARTICLE OR WITHIN THE CATEGORIES OR IT'S IT'S IT'S WELL STRUCTURED IT'S IT'S UH EASY TO MANIPULATE AND 
YEAH 
YOU CAN EVEN ISOLATE THE DIRECTORY FROM THE CATEGORIES OF WIKIPEDIA 
WELL YEAH ACTUALLY I I I DIVIDED IN THREE EQUAL SIZE PARTS WHICH HAVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOCUMENTS 
THERE ARE A THOUSAND DOCUMENTS 
AND WELL BUT 
WELL WHAT I DID WITH THE LINK WELL BUT THIS IS NOT THE EXACTLY THE SAME SETUP YOU WOULD HAVE 
SO ON THIS SETUP THE WHOLE LINK STRUCTURE COULD BE KNOWN 
AND THE ONLY THING YOU WE DON'T YOU WE DON'T KNOW WOULD BE THE ASSIGNATION TO UH IT A CATEGORY 
IN MY SETUP IT WAS DIFFERENT BECAUSE I I SH I COULDN'T USE THE LINKS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SETS 
BUT THIS IS NOT I DON'T WANT TO MESS YOU UP WITH THAT IT'S NOT THE SAME KIND OF EXPERIMENT 
BUT YOU COULD JUST USE THE WHOLE CORPUS LIKE THIS AND AND FOR SOME OF THEM YOU ASSUME YOU DON'T KNOW THE THE CATEGORY ASSIGNMENT 
AND THEN YOU CAN RUN THIS SET OF EXPERIMENTS OVER WIKIPEDIA 
YEAH 
BUT THIS IS THE YEAH THIS IS THE HYPOTHESIS BETWEEN THOSE UH IN THIS P. L. S. A. WITH LINK STUFF 
OH YEAH I TH 
YEAH 
BUT YOU CAN YOU CAN THINK ALSO IT OUT THERE UH TASK LIKE THAT 
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN TAKE PROCEEDINGS AND ASSUME THE CATEGORIES OR THE KEYWORDS OF THE OF THE IDEA OF THE DOCUMENTS 
AND THEN IF YOU HAVE THE ARCHIVE OF A JOURNAL YOU CAN YOU CAN USE THE L THE LINKS BETWEEN UH THE CITATION LINKS 
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A BIGGER STUFF SO WIKIPEDIA WOULD BE KIND OF VERY SMALL WITH LOTS OF ENGLI IN LINKS 
AND THEN IF YOU TAKE A JOURNAL YOU WILL HAVE LESS LINKS AND AND MORE DOCUMENTS 
AND THEN YOU WOULD BE LIKELY TO SAY THAT P. L. S. A. MIGHT BE BETTER OVER THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LINKS 
SO Y Y YOU CAN FIND EXAMPLES WHICH ARE NOT THE WEB I THINK IT'S GOOD TO WORK IN CLOSED SET 
WIKIPEDIA IS KIND OF CLOSED SET MA EVEN IF THERE'S LOTS OF OUTSIDE LINKS BUT THERE'S LOTS OF INSIDE LINKS 
YOU HAVE TO THINK IT TA TA TA TA TA TA DATABASE WHERE THERE'S LOT OF IN LINKS 
WIKIPEDIA MIGHT BE ONE CITATION FOR EXAMPLE IF IF YOU TAKE THE NIPS ARCH ARCHIVE WHICH IS AVAILABLE 
NIPS AUTHOR ALWAYS OTHER NIPS AUTHOR WHICH ARE OFTEN THEMSELVES ETCETERA 
WELL IT'S REPORTED I I WON'T SAY 
SO BUT BUT BUT BUT YEAH I THINK TH TH THIS KIND OF SETUP MAYBE WEB PAGES IT'S HARD TO FIND 
SETS OF WEB PAGES WHICH HAVE GOOD LINKS STUFF IF YOU START FROM ONE PAGE OR SOMETHING 
OKAY 
BUT IT'S DISCRETE UH IN THE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
'KAY YEAH THANKS 
OKAY YEAH 
WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD IDEAS THAT ARE RECORDED AND SOMEONE WILL 
YEAH 
BECAUSE THE DATA LIKE WILL BE RELEASED VERY SOON 
UH WHAT WHAT IS THE TOPIC HERE 
WELL I GUESS SO 
I COULDN'T 
I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE 
BUT I CANNOT 
WELL I THINK THAT I'M MORE NOW 
MUCH MORE THAN UM 
BECAUSE 
OH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
AT THE D. C. D. 
UH I CANNOT SAY IT 
AT THE HILBERT ENVELOPE YOU MEAN ONE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
WHY THAT 
I DON'T THINK SO 
YEAH I JUST RE WROTE IN IN C. PLUS PLUS 
I DIDN'T DO IS IS MUCH ON THAT 
WELL WE WE TRIED UH MANY KNOBS TO TUNE IN THE ON THAT 
BECAUSE YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT COMPRESSION FACTOR AND EVERYTHING 
SO I TRIED A LITTLE BIT LIKE UM PICK MAYBE THREE KNOBS AND TRY TO GO THROUGH THE THREE D. THREE D. CAGE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN WHICH WHICH KIND OF SETTINGS 
SO THIS WE DID 
BUT WE WE DIDN'T BECAUSE THERE WAS STILL A QUESTION THAT I DON'T REMEMBER RIGHT NOW 
BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME ESSENTIAL QUESTION 
I I DON'T REMEMBER 
I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT IT F AND BECAUSE BE BEFORE I WOU BEFORE I WE COULD U WE COULD WRITE ANYTHING I I WOULD BE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT SOMETHING IS RIGHT THERE 
I COULDN'T BE SURE ABOUT IT AT THE TIME 
SO AND ANYWAY IT IT TAKES TIME THIS THIS COMPUTATION 
IT'S IT'S VERY INEFFICIENT 
IT TAKES LIKE HUNDRED TIMES MORE THAN COMPUTING SOME M. F. C. C. S COMPUTING THESE FEATURES BECAUSE IT'S UH HUGE D. C. T. HUGE F. F. T. EVERYWHERE 
AND 
YEAH 
THERE IS NO OPTIMISATION 
WE JUST STICK TO THE TRAP 
WE WANTED TO MAKE US CLOSE TO TRAP AS AS POSSIBLE WHICH IS USUALLY ABOUT THAT WE YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE 
YEAH 
YE OKAY 
SO SO WHAT WILL LAST TIME WE WE WERE IS TALKING ABOUT WHAT ABOUT GAUSSIANS 
YOU YOU HAVE THE GAUSSIANS RUNNING SOMEHOW 
LIKE FEATURE EXTRACTION 
AND THEN THE TANDEM TRAINING C ALSO USE THE YOU ARE ABLE TO TURN THE NET NOW 
NO 
NO SO THEY ARE GOING FROM ICSI 
HUH 
YEAH 
OH 
BUT WHO WHO IS THE ONE WHO WHO IS NOW DEVELOPING THE QUICKNET AND THESE THINGS 
THE THE M. L. P. FOUR AND THESE THINGS 
BECAUSE IT'S 
IT WAS BARRY 
UH I SEE 
I SEE 
WELL STILL WE HAVE THE EXPERTS WHO WHO MADE THE SOFTWARE ON HERE YOU KNOW 
OLIVIER BORNET AND 
UH QUICKNET TRAINING 
YEAH 
YES BUT OLIVIER MAKE IT RUN ON ON THESE MACHINES AND MAKE THE UH ACROSS THE TWO G. BARRIER HERE AT IDIAP 
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T WE COULDN'T DO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
BUT UH SO UH AS AN GOOD IN QUICKNET RIGHT I SEE I GUESS 
YEAH 
UM OKAY 
SO SO 
RIGHT 
SO YOU JUST MISS THE BACK AND WHICH IS EASY BECAUSE IT'S H. T. K. IT'S EVERYONE KNOWS HERE 
OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
A AND YOU YOU JUST NEED FROM US TO HEAR W WHAT ARE THE OTHER P FRONT ENDS AND OTHER FEATURES TO TO CHOOSE OR SOMETHING 
OKAY SO HOW DO WE DO IT 
SH SH SHOULD I LOST IT 
OR 
YEAH 
WELL UH LIKE I I D I DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FEATURE EXTRACTION AND THEN THE M. L. P. 
BECAUSE AS YOU FEED SOMETHING TO THE M. L. P. WHICH ARE NOT THE WAVES 
SO AS WELL AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT 
AND THEN THE BACK AND 
BUT OKAY 
WELL SO WHAT WHAT I HAVE HERE WHAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SINCE I WAS HERE WAS M. F. C. C. P. L. P. WHICH IS ALWAYS NEEDED FOR COMPRESSING PURPOSES 
THEN TRAPS WITH W VARIOUS LENGTHS 
AND ALSO UH YOU KNOW TRAPS NOW 
WITH VAR VARIOUS LENGTHS WE WERE TRYING TO TO START THEM FROM FROM IN THE ULTIMATE LENGTH OF AN AN UH FROM UP TO ONE SECOND OR EVEN MORE 
BUT IT WAS MM SO THIS 
ALSO WE THEN WE APPLY THE D. C. T. ON THE TRAP ITSELF WHICH IS SOME SOMETHING LIKE THE GAUSSIANS 
APPLYING SOME FILT FILTERING 
BASICALLY THE TRAP 
SO THIS 
BUT THIS IS MAINLY FRANTA WHO WAS DOING THIS 
SO THIS IS RELATED TO TRAPS 
I WAS ALSO TRYING THE WARPING 
MEANS IF YOU HAVE A SECOND UM WHICH IS UH A HUNDRED AND ONE SAMPLES I WAS JUST KEEPING THE CENTRAL TEN TEN SAMPLES 
AND THEN I WAS THROWING AWAY SOME SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW 
LIKE WITH SAMPLING THIS THIS UH ONE SECOND OF THE TRAP TO SOMETHING WHICH I WHICH I UH PRESERVED ALL THE POINTS IN THE CENTRE AND JUST UH PICKED EVERY TENTH POINT AT THE BOUNDARIES 
WHICH MEANS THE TRAP UH HUNDRED AND ONE TRAP TRAJECTORY SHRANK TO SAY FIFTEEN POINTS WITH UH WITH STILL PRESERVING THE MAXIMUM RESOLUTION AT THE CENTRE AND THROWING AWAY MOST OF THE POINTS NEAR THE BOUNDARY 
SO THIS I WAS TRYING 
SO THIS I HAVE SOME RESULTS ON 
SO THESE ARE TRAPS 
THEN THE GAUSS TRAPS 
THEN TANDEM SYSTEM 
UH THE TANDEM YOU PLUS MINUS HALF 
BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S JUST A P. L. P. S 
AND THEN THERE IS A TRAINING UH WITH M. L. P. THAT'S TAKING SOME CONTEXT OF THESE P. L. P. COEFFICIENTS 
SO IT'S LIKE FEEDING THE P. L. UH P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. S W WHATEVER IT M. L. P. AND TAKING SOME CONTEXT 
THIS IS THE TANDEM 
SO THIS SET UP WE ALSO HAVE HERE 
I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT WITH THIS 
BUT MAYBE YOU SOME MORE RESULTS UH IT'S HEMANT WHO HAS THE RESULTS ON TANDEM I GUESS NO 
YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
BUT UH I THINK THE UH I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS ARE ALREADY ON THE THESIS HE'S WRITING 
SO SO SO THERE SOME SOMEWHERE 
SO THIS IS TANDEM 
UH THEN UH THEN WHAT 
AND THEN THERE IS THE F. D. L. P. 
THEN WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT 
WHICH IS WHICH I HAVE MORE EXPERIMENTS ON 
ALSO THIS WARPING AND COMPRESSIONS AND ALL THESE THINGS 
SO 
WELL IT'S BIL STILL SUB BANDS NO 
WELL YEAH 
BUT THAT YOU JUST DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ANY SUB BAND IS FOR 
AND BY THE WAY YOU DON'T DO THE OVERLAP ON THE SUB BANDS NO 
OR YOU DO 
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T DO THE OVERLAP ON THE TIME DOMAIN 
YOU SAID SOMETHI YEAH 
OKAY SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE 
HMM 
P. L. P. S 
M. F. C. C. OR TRIANGLES 
OKAY 
SO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS COMPRESSION HOW HOW DOES IT WHY IT'S OKAY 
I JUST DON'T KNOW 
UH HE'S NOW 
HE'S HE'S DOING YOU MOST OF THE THINGS 
SO 
OKAY 
WELL WHAT 
I WHAT 
I I D YEAH 
WELL THE BEGINNING OF THE 
OH YEAH 
SURE SURE SURE SURE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO UM JUST THEY IN THE UM IN THE SPEECH UH RE SYNTHESIS OR CODING WHAT YOU'RE DOING UM DID YOU TRY TO TO PLAY WITH THE KNOBS SOMEWHERE 
LIKE UH MANY UH UH V WIDTHS 
I UM NO NO 
THE COMPRESSION NUMBER OF BANDS AND LENGTHS OF THE SO WHAT YOU WHAT YOU WERE PLAYING WITH AND WHAT OTHER RESULT 
LIKE WHAT IT IS IS THAT IT SENDS THE BEST 
YEAH O OF COURSE YOU YOU LISTEN TO IT YOURSELF 
I D I'M FINE WITH THAT 
BECAUSE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
BUT 
IF YOU GO DOWN 
I SEE 
SO SO YOU WON'T SAY THAT THE L. P. C. IS NOT ABLE TO FIT IT IS THAT THE RESIDUAL WAS EASY 
WILL BE HERE 
I DON'T THINK SO 
NO NO NO NO 
OR NOT SUPPOSED 
I THINK YOU HAVE TO PUSH TO PUSH IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT REACTS TO THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH WHICH LINES 
YEAH 
OKAY OKAY OKAY OKAY OKAY 
MM-HMM 
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN 
THIS IS THE SUB BAND TIME SIGNAL 
IT'S 
YEAH 
I SEE 
OKAY 
SO 
MM-HMM 
I SEE 
I WAS THINKING THE RESIDUAL AN L. P. C. FIT OF THE HILBERT ENVELOPE NOT THIS 
I WAS NOT THINKING OF THIS AT ALL BEFORE YOU KNOW 
'CAUSE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS 
FIRST YOU HAVE TO ENCODE THIS THEN THE L. P. C. COEFFICIENTS AND THE RESIDUAL AFTER L. P. C. FIT IF YOU LOOK 
UH YOU DON'T 
THIS IS THE RESIDUAL 
YEAH 
WELL I 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THAT THAT'S NICE 
OKAY 
AND SO SO SO THE USE THE BROADER BANDS DO WHAT IN THIS PICTURE 
L LEFT LEFT 
HMM 
YEAH THAT THAT'S 
YEAH 
ALTHOUGH HERVE JUST SAID THAT WE SHOULDN'T S TALK ABOUT CONFIDENTIAL THINGS HERE 
THAT'S THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
SO SO THERE IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE THE LOWER BANDS THE THE WORSE STUFF YOU JUST SAID AND AND THE MORE BANDS THE MORE COEFFICIENTS TO TRANSMIT 
SO FIFTEEN SO BUT OKAY 
OKAY 
SO THIS 
AND THEN THERE IS A COMPRESSION 
WHAT ABOUT THAT 
SO THAT YOU GOT IS THAT YOU CAN'T MODEL TO ACTUALLY 
YEAH 
OF WHAT 
UH UH UH COMPRESSION 
'KAY 
THE SUB BAND SIGNAL 
SUB BANDS POWER SPECTRUM 
L. P. C. 
L. UH L. P. 
YEAH 
SO 
WELL YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
GO ON 
OH 
YEAH THEY ARE 
BUT THREE PAPERS 
THERE WAS UH THE S S S SAPA OR HOW IT'S CALLED THE CONFERE THEN THEN 
AND ONE IS IN IN THE AMERICA UH YES 
YEAH 
I I DON'T KNOW 
I JUST ONE 
YOU WERE 
YOU DON'T KNOW 
EVALUATION THAT'S THAT'S BAD 
'KAY 
YEAH 
ALSO I CAN UM BEFORE MARIUS LEFT HE HE HAS UH HAD ACTUALLY LEFT HIMSELF 
BUT ALL THE FILES ARE HERE 
YOU KNOW 
SO ALL THE M MATLAB IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THESE ARE HERE 
AND THERE IS ALSO ONE BIG TABLE THAT HE SAID HE SAID IT YEAH 
HE WAS ALSO PLAYING WITH ALL THESE COMPRESSION FACTORS AND LENGTHS OF THE OF OF THAT 
AND THERE IS A BIG TABLE IN AN EXCEL WHICH YOU CAN LOOK AT 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
THIS W 
OH YEAH 
BECAUSE IT TO TO TAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME 
AND UH BASICALLY UH HE WAS THE FIRST ONE TO REALISE THAT THESE THESE GUYS ARE PRETTY SLOW TO TO DO THESE THINGS 
SO UH UH UH JUST UH UH JUST UH PUT HERE THE P. MAKE ENVIRONMENT AND HE DIDN'T STICK TO ANY CLUSTER OR ANYTHING 
UH JUST PUT P. MAKE AND RUN IT IN UH IN ALL THE MACHINES HERE 
SO AT SOME POINT HE WAS USING ALL THE AVAILABLE MEMORY BY ANY MISTAKE YOU KNOW 
SO AT THE ON THE MORNING ALL THE MACHINES WERE WERE JUST STICK 
DO IN ONE COULD EVER M MOVE THE MOUSE 
SO THESE THESE RESUL YEAH 
BECAUSE HE WAS DOING EVERYTHING IN MATLAB 
SO IT WAS AGAIN TEN TIMES MORE DEMANDING THAN C. PLUS PLUS AND THEN 
MM 
BUT UH DID 
UH WRITE IT WILL 
BUT ANYWAY ANYWAY 
BECAUSE I W I IN THE CODE THAT I WROTE I WAS LIKE PLAYING ALSO WITH OF OF THE MAT MATRIX IS PARSE I REALLY DON'T USE IT ALL 
I JUST MULTIPLY FROM HERE TO HEAR FROM HERE IT HERE 
NOT TO MATRIX P MY MATRIX 
AND THEN I I JUST OPTIMISED IT A BIT 
AND ALSO BLAST LIBRARIES AND ALL THESE STA THINGS 
BUT OKAY 
UH WELL WHATEVER 
BUT THE IT 
OH 
YEAH 
BUT THERE IS A THE BACK END RECOGNIZER WHICH I WILL GIVE YOU WHICH IS TURN AROUND OF EIGHTEEN MINUTES OR WELL FROM ELEVEN AT FIFTEEN MINUTES 
NORMALLY IT WOULD TAKE HERE AND A HALF 
YEAH NO 
NO TODAY IT WAS OVER IN HERE 
IT'S JUST LIKE TEN TIMES LESS MAYBE OR FIVE TO TEN TIMES LESS 
BUT STILL STILL YOU CAN YOU CAN FIVE TIMES MORE COMPUTE 
GREAT 
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS 
I I DON'T KNOW 
I I DIDN'T TRY TO 
I DIDN'T EVEN MAIL TO TO CHERNOTSKY I MUST SAY 
UH I JUST TALKED TO ONE GIRL THERE WHICH TOLD ME THAT UH WOULD BE POSSIBLY ABLE TO FIND ME A JOB THERE 
ANY ANY JOB LIKE RELATED MAYBE TO FIELD 
BUT JOB 
NOT NOT ANYTHING ANY RESEARCH 
SO IF IF NOTHING THEN THEN I COULD BE ABLE TO GET THE JOB SOMEWHERE 
YEAH PROBABLY 
YEAH BUT IT IS BUT YEAH 
'KAY 
WE HOPE THAT YOU FIND OUT THAT EVERYTHING WAS WRONG AND THAT THE POTENTIAL AS MUCH BIGGER 
YEAH IT ACTUALLY WORK THAT IT 
NO 
BUT AFTER YOU FIND OUT THE BACK THEN IT WILL BE THAT WILL BE THE YEAH 
SO WE WILL SEND YOU THE PAPERS RELATED 
AND I WILL POINT YOU AT ALL THE CODE WHICH I HAVE 
AND YES 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH I CAN PLAY IT BACK 
SO I CAN JUST NOW TELL THE THE LOCATIONS OF ALL THE FILES AND YOU CAN REWIND 
YEAH YEAH FERRET 
UM SO 
ANY ANY MORE THINGS 
YEAH UNTIL TWENTY FOUR 
IT'S THE FRIDAY 
SO NOVEMBER YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
IT WAS YEAH THE LAST TIME IT WAS FOR ME IT WAS GOOD THE COURSE FROM MY FROM ONE SPECIAL REASON 
BECAUSE IN THE F WHEN THERE THE WERE THE FLATS IN I LOST ALL MY PAPERS FROM MY SCHOOL 
ALL THE ALL THE EXERCISE BOOKS 
UM HOW TO SAY THIS 
NOT NOT YEAH ALL THE NOTEPADS AND EVERYTHING ALL THE NOTES FROM ANY COURSES 
SO I WAS REMEMBERING WHAT I WAS LEARNED OR WHAT I WAS TAUGHT AT THE TIME 
SO SO I HAVE TO NOW BACK AT LEAST PARTIALLY 
'CAUSE ALL THE ALL THE ALGORITHMS YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT 
YEAH 
UH UH I WOULD ADD 
YEAH 
NOW 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OH 
SOME 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND ALSO IN THE ON THE L LAB LABS THE IDEA PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THEY JUST FOLLOW THE PAPERS 
IT WAS 
YEAH 
OH 
NOT AT THIS TOPIC 
YEAH BUT ANYWAY AFTER 'EM BACK I'LL BE STILL ON SKYPE AND ALL THESE THINGS 
SO NO PROBLEM TO CONTACT ME UNTIL I DON'T KNOW MY NEXT YEAR 
SO IT'S FINE 
WELL I WOULD LIKE IT YEAH 
I SHOULD 
BUT I WOULD HAVE TO STUDY HERE FOR THAT THAT LONG TIME ON 
I TH 
TWO TWO YEARS YEAH 
AND I WOULD HAVE TO STAY IN MORE 
UH WELL IT WOULD BE GOOD REASON FOR PETRA THAT I HAVE TO STAY HERE 
YEAH YEAH 
BECAUSE SHE HAS A GOOD POSITION BECAUSE SHE HAS A FRIEND WHICH IS STARTING WHO IS STARTING A LAB THERE 
AND EVERYTHING SO IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR HERE AT LEAST 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS AND THEN SHE WILL GO BACK AND THERE'S UH F FAMILY ISSUES AND ALL THESE THINGS YOU KNOW 
FOR A GIRL IT'S ALWAYS THE PEN 
BECAUSE SHE HAS TO BREAK FOR SOME TIME AT LEAST A LITTLE 
BUT HAS TO BREAK 
AND IN IN THE SCIENCE IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO TO BREAK 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT 
YEAH BUT I THINK DEFINITELY YOU ARE THE BEST PERSON HERE IT WITH UH RELATED TO AVAILABILITY OF YOU 
BECAUSE IF IF IF I WANT TO GO TO HERVE I PROBABLY CALL SECRETARY 
HE'S THERE ARE AND WHEN I CAN AND I THERE WAS IN P UH NO EV EVERY TIME I COME TO YOU YOU WERE AVAILABLE 
AT LEAST IT 
THAT'S GREAT 
YOU KNOW THE CORE WHICH WE DON'T REMEMBER ANYMORE PROGRAMMING 
WE KNOW THE DETAILS AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE GLOBAL STUFF 
UH ASK HYNEK 
ASK MY BOSS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
YEP 
SO SO JOEL IS GOING TO TALK 
THAT'S MINE 
WELL MY FROM DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW 
BUT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
LET ME JUST TELL US IS WHAT YOU KNOW ALREADY BUT UH I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR YOU ARE WITH THE S FEATURES 
OR 
SO YOU KNOW IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
MM-HMM 
BUT IT WHAT CHRISTOS WAS DOING 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WHAT YEAH YEAH 
WE SHOULDN'T SMILE 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT I'M SEEING THAT FOR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT REASON RIGHT 
SO IT'S UH SPEECH CODING 
SO UH WHAT IS THE TASK AS USUAL JUST TAKE THE SPEECH OF COURSE SOMEHOW TO ENCODE IT NOT SO SO SMALL NUMBER OF BUT AS POSSIBLE AND WITH A REASONABLE QUALITY OF COURSE 
AND AGAIN TO E UH DECIDE IT 
AND I'M USING F. D. L. P. FOR THAT STILL PLAYING WITH UH MORE LESS ONE SECOND LONG SEGMENTS 
SO JUST DIVIDING THE SPEECH INTO ONE IS ONE SECOND FRAMES DOING D. C. T. 
IT'S JUST THE STANDARD WOR OF WORK 
AND THEN DOING SOME COMPRESSION AND COMPUTATION OF YEAH YEAH YEAH SH OH YEAH 
BUT YOU ARE DOING THE SAME ONE 
YEAH B YEAH YEAH YOU TAKE THE THE D. C. T. AND YOU JUST DIVIDE IT INTO SEVERAL SUB BANDS FREQUENCY BANDS WITH A DIFFERENT UH 
I D I D 
YOU MEAN 
NO NO NO 
NO 
I DON'T DO 
YEAH JUST ONE SECOND WITH WITHOUT OVERLAPPING 
BUT IN FREQUENCY DOMAIN THERE IS A OVERLAP 
BECAUSE YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH FILTERS YOU WANT MORE LESS OR JUST TRAJECTORIES OF THOSE BANDS 
SO THERE IS OVERLAPPING 
I'M USING THOSE GAUSSIAN FILTERS OR CLASSICAL THOSE THOSE TRAPET TRAPEZOIDAL LIKE AN UH M. F. C. C. S RIGHT 
AND THEN PROCESSING EACH OF YEAH P. L. P. S 
OKAY TR TRIANGULARS 
THAT ONE 
THEN I'M DOING IS DOING UH INDEPENDENT PROCESSING OF EACH FREQUENCY BAND 
SO I'M COMPUTING THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE WHICH IS JUST THE ENVELOPE OF SOME TEMPORAL TRAJECTORY 
AND MORE OR LESS YOU CAN DIVIDE THIS INTO A HILBERT ENVELOPE HILB HILBERT CARRIER 
WE USE SOMETHING LIKE L. P. A LINEAR PREDICTION ENVELOPE 
AUTO REGRESSIVE MODEL AND EXCITATION SIGNAL 
YEAH SO THESE ARE TWO PARTS OR ITEMS YOU NEED SOMEHOW TO ENCODE IF YOU WANT AGAIN TO GET ORIGINAL SPEECH OR REASONABLE QUALITY 
AND YEAH THERE IS SOME COMPRESSION FACTOR WHICH IS AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE COMPUTING THAT AUTO REGRESSIVE MODEL FROM F. D. L. P. 
YOU CAN COMPRESS THE SPECTRUM SOMEHOW IN IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU RATHER UM PRESERVE THOSE EVEN ALSO THOSE DIPS NOT ONLY PEAKS IN THE SPECTRUM 
AND IT SOUNDS BETTER FOR SOME KIND OF SPEECH SIGNALS 
SO IT'S KIND OF LOGARITHM WHEN YOU USE LOGARITHM FOR M. F. C. C. S RIGHT 
SO IT'S AGAIN COMPRESSION FACTOR SOMETHING LIKE THE END BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO UNCOMPRESS IT AGAIN OF COURSE TO GET BACK THE SPEECH 
AND THERE THERE OTHER THINGS WHICH I'M DOING 
BUT IT'S NOT RELATED TO SPEECH RECOGNITION AS MUCH OR BUT 
WELL 
RIGHT RIGHT 
WELL IT'S YEAH 
SURE SURE I KNOW 
I MEAN IT'S MORE OR LESS THE SAME APPROACH RIGHT 
THERE IS UM UH JUST MORE RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT 
YEAH 
WITH WHAT 
YEAH YEAH 
SURE 
NUMBER OF BANDS AND 
YOU KNOW THAT'S THE PROBLEM FOR SPEECH CODING 
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE RESULTS LIKE IN SPEECH RECOGNITION 
SO OF COURSE I HAVE TO LISTEN TO AND AND AS WELL SO NOW WHAT I'M USING OUR FIFTEEN BANDS 
WHICH SEEMS TO ME FIT FIFTEEN FREQUENCY BAND WHICH SEEMS TO ME QUITE REASONABLE 
WE CAN GO DOWN TILL LIKE TWELVE AND STILL OKAY I WOULD SAY 
BUT THEN YOU START HEARING DIFFERENCE 
OR ELSE THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM 
ONCE YOU CAN GO DOWN WITH FREQUENCY BANDS THEN YOU WILL HAVE MUCH UH MORE C UH COMPLICATED DATA 
UH LET'S SAY EXCITATION SIGNAL OR THAT CARRIER WHICH YEAH BECAUSE BROAD BANDS RIGHT 
YEAH MAYBE LIKE THAT 
NO 
SO THERE IS MORE AND MORE IS UH FREQUENCY COMPONENTS LET'S SAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ONE ONE BROAD BAND 
SO 
NO 
L. P. C. WELL MAYBE 
BUT THEN YOU HAVE STILL ANOTHER PART SOMETIME SOMETHING LIKE A SOURCE AND A FILTER 
SO WHEN YOU ARE DOING SPEECH CODING OR 
YEAH 
WHY 
I DON'T KNOW NOW 
IT'S QUITE LONG 
WELL I MEAN IT'S IT'S THE SAME LIKE WHEN YOU ARE DOING L. P. L. P. SYNTHESIS RIGHT 
SO YOU'VE GOT SOURCE SIGNAL 
I DON'T KNOW 
SOURCE 
OH 
YEAH 
AND THEN THERE IS SOME FILTER WHICH IS THAT ONE DIVIDED BY A. Z. 
AND THAT'S AND THAT'S IT 
AND THE SOURCE CAN BE A NOISE SIGNAL OR IT CAN BE SOME UH SEQUENCE OF UH WHAT IS THAT 
PULSES RIGHT 
THIS IS YEAH 
SO AND IT'S MORE LESS OR LESS THE SAME WHAT I'M DOING 
SO THIS IS SOME ENVELOPE WHICH IS IN OUR CASE RELATED TO HILBERT ENVELOPE 
AND THIS IS A SOURCE SIGNAL WHICH IS HILBERT CARRIER 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
SO THIS IS NOW GOING TO BE FREQUENCY 
YEAH 
SO MORE OR LESS IF WE UH CAN WE CAN PLOT IT 
SO WHAT WE CAN USE IS SOME HILBERT ENVELOPE LIKE THIS 
AND THEN THERE IS THAT HILBERT CARRIER 
OR THIS NOT HILBERT CARRIER 
BUT THIS IS THE SIGNAL WHICH WE GOT FROM AN IDEA IN FREQUENCY BAND 
SO YOU COMPUTE D. C. T. RIGHT FROM SIGNAL 
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY 
AND WHAT WE GOT FROM THAT IS THIS HILBERT ENVELOPE RIGHT 
AND THE SECOND WHICH SHOULD BE THAT CARRIER SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
IT'S JUST REALLY CLOSE TO COSINE WE UM WE MIGHT SEE IF WE DO TO DO IT PROPERLY RIGHT 
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU ALSO HAVE TO SOMEHOW TRANSMIT OR AT LEAST TRY TO TRANSMIT IN ORDER TO GET 
RIGHT RIGHT 
RIGHT 
NO I DON'T NEED L. P. C. 
NO NO 
THIS IS A RESIDUAL FOR ME 
YEAH I'M JUST WAN I JUST WANT TO TRANSMIT THIS SIGNAL RIGHT 
IT'S AND WHAT YOU NEED IS THIS ENVELOPE AND THIS ONE CARRIER 
AND YOU AGAIN GET THE SAME SIGNAL THIS THIS THIS SHAPE DOING I. D. C. T. 
PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER 
RIGHT 
BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK FOR EXAMPLE FOR A SO IF YOU HAVE A VERY G GOOD MUSIC SIGNAL 
WHICH IS VERY UH PERIODIC YOU CAN REALLY IS SOMETHING LIKE THERE IS ONE PEAK AND 
AND FREQUENCY MORE OR LESS DOESN'T CHANGE 
IT'S UH RELATED TO UH THAT FREQUENCY OF THE BROAD BAND OR HOW IT'S CALLED 
IF YOU ADD THOSE FILTERS WHICH ARE UH WIDER AND WIDER THIS IS THAT CENTRE FREQUENCY WHICH IS SOMEHOW RELATED TO THIS ONE 
SO THEN YOU CAN TRANSMIT UH JUST F 
IT'S WORSE AND WORSE 
DON'T THEN YOU DON'T SEE ANY ANYTHING LIKE COSINE 
BUT 
RIGHT RIGHT 
EVERYWHERE 
IT SOUNDS LIKE L. P. C. WHEN YOU EXCITED BY NOISE 
IT'S BETTER I WOULD SAY 
UH BETTER QUALITY 
DEFINITELY BETTER QUALITY 
IT LOWER BIT RATE 
BUT THAT'S A PROBLEM 
SO SO 
YEAH SURE 
OBJECTIVE MEASURE WELL IT WAS SOME THIS UH DISTANCES SPECTRAL DISTANCES WELL EDINBURGH SAW PROBABLY 
AS WELL I MEAN 
I UH 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
SURE 
I SEE 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
ALSO THERE ARE PAPERS ABOUT IT THAT IF IF YOU HAVE LIKE TWELVE FREQUENCY BANDS IT'S SOMEHOW OPTIMAL 
COMPRESSION IS ONLY IT REALLY TO SOMEHOW FEED THAT UH HILBERT ENVELOPE TO YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YOU CAN MODEL IT BETTER 
THERE IS NO ECHO OR SOMETHING LIKE REVE REVERBERANCE IN THE SIGNAL IF YOU REALLY GO DOWN WITH THAT COMPRESSION FACTOR TO LIKE ZERO POINT IN SOMETHING THAT 
ZERO POINT ONE 
SO 
RIGHT 
IT'S IT'S SO RIGHT 
AND IT'S STILL YEAH 
YEAH YOU JUST PRESERVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT LITTLE BIT 
LET'S SAY AN R. S. S. 
YEAH 
I THINK HYNEK HAS GOT MA MANY PAPERS ARE SOME PAPERS OVER THAT 
SO UH 
NO I THINK I READ IT 
RIGHT MORE OR LESS 
RIGHT 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK YOU CAN REALLY TAKE THOSE PAPERS FROM UH MARIUS ABOUT F. D. L. P. 
THEY ARE THAT'S REALLY ENOUGH NO 
WHAT IS SAPA 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
JUST SOMETHING 
RIGHT 
APPROACHES 
MM-HMM 
BUT THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS FROM IDIAP I THINK 
AT LEAST TWO REPORTS FROM MARIUS SEEM TO ME 
YEAH THEY ARE MORE LESS THEY ARE SOME LIKE 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
SOMETIMES UNREADABLE I WOULD SAY 
IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT BUT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I THINK THIS YEAR A LOT UH INTERSPEECH THERE WAS ONE PAPER 
BUT IT WAS REGARDED TO SPEECH RECOGNITION SOMEHOW 
Y YEAH YEAH 
IT WAS NOT SOMETHING LIKE SPEECH CODING OR THAT D. C. T. TRANSFORMS 
NO NOTHING LIKE THAT 
SO 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
MM 
MAYBE YES 
MAYBE ONE 
I DON'T IT'S HARD TO SAY 
NOW IT'S NOT SO BAD WITH THAT IF YOU REALLY WRITE OUT OF WELL 
AND UH DID 
I THINK SO 
SURE 
OR RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHATEVER 
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT 
OH 
OH YEAH 
SURE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS CASE 
BUT STILL 
RIGHT 
YEAH AND DEFINITE 
NOVEMBER 
NOVEMBER 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TO TALK OR TO TOUCH 
IT'S JUST THAT PERCEPTUAL STUFF AND 
MM-HMM 
DO YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS YOU HAVE 
NO 
UH IT'S GRADUATE FOR GRADUATES 
WELL I THINK GUILLERMO WAS THINKING ABOUT 
AND 
HMM 
WELL I WOULD LIKE TO GO THERE BUT NOT JUST FOR CREDITS 
JUST MAYBE TO HEAR SOMETHING NEW 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
OH SURE 
A ANY 
I THINK SO 
WHY YOU ARE YOU DOING THIS 
GOOD QUESTION SOMETIME ASKING 
RIGHT 
THANK YOU 
SO YEAH WE PUT THIS STUFF IN IS THAT IS THAT WE HAVE SOME RECORD OF THE WHOLE THING WHAT UH ARE GOING TO SAY 
AND UH THE WHOLE IDEA HERE IS SAYS ALSO PUT THE LAPEL ON 
UH THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS MEETING IS THAT IT'S NOT UM WHO WILL BE TALKING ALL THE TIME 
SO SO THAT WOULD BE A BORING THAT WOULD BE DEFINITELY BORING MEETING 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SO I SEE THE P THE ACTUALLY THE REASON WHY WE GET TOGETHER SO THAT IT'S BU IT'S ABOUT THE TIME TO A. MAKE SURE THAT WHEN PETR LEAVES US UH I'M AFRAID IT MAY HAPPEN 
RIGHT 
I MEAN IT OR DID YOU DIDN'T CHANGE YOUR MIND YET 
OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND DIDN'T CHANGE YOUR MIND 
SO SO THAT WHATEVER HE'S WHATEVER HE'S BEEN DOING UH IS NOT UH FORGOTTEN AND THEN PEOPLE CAN STAY ON HIS SHOULDERS AND UH I HOPE THAT UH WON'T GET OUT ENTIRELY OUT OF UH OUT OF UH THIS PROBLEM 
BUT STILL WE WE NEED TO CONTINUE ON THIS 
SO I THINK THE JOEL WILL BE S SO MY MAIN HOPE THAT HE'S UH HE'S GOING TO PICK UP UH THE KEY WORD SPOTTING AND SOME OF THESE IDEAS AND ALSO THE REASON WHY P UH I P UH UH PETR MOTLICEK IS HERE IS THAT JOEL IS ALSO GETTING INTERESTED IN UH OPAL MODELS OF UH TEM TEMPORAL ENVELOPE 
YEAH AND OF OF COURSE PET UH PETR FOR SIGNALS 
SO BUT IT BUT PETR MOTLICEK TOO 
UH BOTH OF YOU YOU KNOW 
SO BUT BUT BUT YOU WILL BE HERE AND FROM DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW UH 
PETR MOTLICEK IS WORKING MAINLY ON SPEECH CODING 
YEAH AND UH SO SO THIS IS UM YEAH I GUESS THIS IS IT 
SO UM I I GUESS THAT REALLY YOU SHOULD BE TALKING MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE ASKING QUESTIONS 
YEAH 
YEAH I KNOW 
SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 
AND UH 
YEAH 
UH THESE WERE HO HOW IT STARTED BASICALLY BECAUSE THAT WAS UH MARIOS ATHINEOS YEAH AND DAN ELLIS 
THEY HAD A PAPER I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT IN ICASSP A. S. R. U. OR SOMETHING RIGHT 
IT WAS A A. S. R. U. BUT THAT WAS A TIME WHEN THEY WEREN'T USING VERY LONG UH UH UH D UH SEGMENTS 
IT WAS LIKE FIFTY MILLISECOND OR SOMETHING WHAT THEY WERE PLAYING WITH AT THE TIME 
YEAH I KNOW 
SO THEN I THE STORY WAS THAT THEN UH MARIOS PRESENTED THAT IT IS SOME MEETING AND WE REALISED OH 
THAT MIGHT BE CUTE THING UH FOR UH ESTIMATING UH SPECTRAL ENERGIES 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT 
AND WE'LL THE THE WAY WE'VE UH WE ARE DOING IT IS KIND OF I THINK IT WORKS BUT IT'S LITTLE BIT INELEGANT 
SOMEHOW STUPID SO SO FIRST DO THE FRAME BY BASED UH ESTIMATE 
AND THEN YOU YOU GET STICK TO HUNDRED HERTZ SAMPLING TEN MILLISECOND SAMPLING OR UH SOMETHING AND THEN YOU JUST PICK UP THE TRAJECTORY 
SO SO MARIOS WAS HERE FOR HALF A YEAR MAYBE OR EVEN MORE UH AND UH STARTED WORK WITH PETR WHO ALSO J JUST COME 
SO THEY WERE WORKING LITTLE BIT TOGETHER 
MAINLY M MARIOS WAS UH PROGRAMMING IN MATLAB AND PETR WAS PUTTING IT INTO FANCY SO YEAH AND UH BUT UH AND BUT THEN WE WERE HOPING UH UH UH THE TO PICK UP ON THAT LITTLE BIT MORE 
AND WE WE DID RIGHT 
YOU ADD A LITTLE BIT OF WORK 
YEAH 
HMM 
AND WE NEVER PUBLISHED THAT ANYWHERE RIGHT 
HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE WERE ALSO DOING A SERIOUS THING THAT WE WERE STEPPING IT BY TEN MILLISECOND RIGHT 
AT THE TIME 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
THAT WAS A REASONABLE START YEAH 
YEAH 
SO YOU MAY BE THE ONLY ONE ON THE WHOLE WORLD NOW 
BECAUSE UH BECAUSE CHI FONG IS AGAIN AND UH AND UH BARRY IS AGAIN 
SO MORGAN WAS JOKING NO WHAT HE INFORMED ME THEY ARE GONE FROM ICSI 
UH CHI FONG WENT TO T. A. AND UH AND UH UH UH B BARRY IS AT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LAB 
UH BASICALLY GOT A JOB 
UH HE GRADUATED 
AND HE'S HE'LL BE WORKING ON THINGS WHICH HE CANNOT TALK ABOUT 
UH CAN'T EVEN SAY IT IN A MICROPHONE HERE I HEARD 
IT'S UH I YEAH IT'S CLASSIFIED WORK TYPICALLY 
IT'S AND SO SO JO MORGAN WAS UH ONLY HALF JOKING 
HE WAS S SOMEBODY WAS ASKING HIM YOU WERE OR S S OR SOMEBODY WAS ASKING HIM SOMETHING 
UH ARE THERE WAS UH THERE WAS UH MATTHEW AND HE SAID WILL PROBABLY WE'LL BE COMING TO ASK YOU BECAUSE NOBODY REALLY KNOWS ANYMORE AT ICSI 
SO PLEASE STAY 
UH TH NOBODY 
THAT WAS BARRY 
AND NOW IT'S UH CL CLOSE HISTO ACTUALLY BRNO IS DOING A A LOT OF THAT NOW 
THEY PICKED UP THE SOFTWARE AND THEY PLAY WITH THE END NOTES 
SO THAT MIGHT BE THAT BRNO WILL BE AT THE SOONEST AS UH A ULTIMATE EXPERT IN IN THE WHOLE THING 
NO NO WHERE WHICH SOFTWARE 
NO THEY NE QUICKNET WAS DONE UH UH WELL QUICKNET ITSELF WAS DONE ACTUALLY LONG TIME AGO AT ICSI 
SO THAT IS 
GROUP 
OKAY 
SO WE UH HAVE TO TREAT HIM WELL 
WELL THE WHOLE IDEA THEN IS THAT THEN YOU START PLAYING WITH IT RIGHT 
AND YOU YEAH AND 
MAYBE THAT MIGHT BE THE 
ONE FRAME 
OH 
UH USED TO HAVE BEFORE HE LOST ALL THE DATA 
BUT UH WILL HAVE IT AGAIN 
YEAH 
KNOWS MORE THAN THAN THAN I D 
SO SO THAT'S GOOD 
BUT CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE UH THE THE PLA MODELLING OF TEMPORAL TRAJECTORIES 
EVEN PE PETR FOUSEK IS NOT HERE YOU PROBABLY KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT BY NOW 
NO 
THAT UH UH AP APPROXIMATING HILBERT ENVELOPE BY OPAL MODEL 
I A V A V. L. P. 
UH SO SO I SAY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ARE NOT HERE THAT THAT PETR MOTLICEK KNOWS ENOUGH ABOUT IT IT 
BECAUSE SOME P YEAH DIFFERENT UH APPLICATION DIFFERENT UH DIFFERENT SOFTWARE OR SOMETHING 
IF IF YOU MAKE A B BROADER BANDS 
BECAUSE WHEN THE BAND IS NARROW THE C EXCITATION IS CLOSE THE CARRIER IS CLOSE TO S SINUSOID BASICALLY CO SINUSOID 
YOU MAY ALMOST WANT IT DOES UH UM I B UH UH UH YEAH UH B IS THE WHITE BOARD 
I MEAN UH AND UH THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO HERE RIGHT SO THAT 
I DON'T THINK SO 
I THINK ONE WE ARE WORD 
EXCEPT 
PULSES 
THIS IS L. P. 
THIS IS A STANDARD TIME DOMAIN L. P. RIGHT 
BUT SINCE YOU ARE IN A DIFFERENT DOMAIN THIS IS UH HERE WE ARE IN TIME DOMAIN RIGHT 
BUT BUT YOU ARE YOU ARE REALLY IN A FREQUENCY DOMAIN 
SO IT UH THE LINE'S TURNING IT INTO SINES RIGHT 
AND YOU UP AND SINCE THIS THIS I MEAN BECAUSE THIS THI THIS THIS SPECTRUM IS AL HAS ALSO LINE SPECTRUM RIGHT 
I MEAN ALL COMPONENTS 
SO IF YOU ARE THEN IF WE ARE IN A FREQUENCY TH YOUR SOURCE LOOKS LIKE THIS 
AND 
IT'S UH YEAH RIGHT 
SO YOU KNOW THAT 
AND THIS IS WHERE 
AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM CURRENTLY IS THAT THE CARRIER IS ACTUALLY NOT COSINE BUT UH SOMETHING LITTLE BIT MORE UH UH INTERESTING 
AND OF THE FREQUENCY DOESN'T CHANGE OVER THE W OVER OVER THE LENGTHS OF THE UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT BUT IF F FORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF UH UH BECAUSE OF PROPERTIES OF HEARING MORE OR LESS 
FOR THE HIGHER BANDS YOU IF YOU PUT IN JUST USE SOME GARBAGE SOME NOISE IT DOESN'T REALLY UM W MATTER ALL THAT MUCH 
IT W SOUNDS LITTLE BIT WORSE 
BUT UH IT'S NOT A BIG TRAGEDY 
UH WHERE YOU REALLY W IF YOU WANT TO GO DO A GOOD VOICE SPEECH UH YOU'LL WANT TO GET THE LOWER BANDS CORRECT 
AND IF YOU PUT IN UH NOISE ALTOGETHER IT SOUNDS LIKE A WHISPERED SPEECH UH BUT YOU UNDERSTAND PERFECT 
BY NOISE 
SO NOW WE HAVE TO KILL THEM BOTH 
BECAUSE I MEAN GAVE ALL THE SECRETS AWAY 
I MEAN QUAL COMPUTERS IS GOING TO 
YES 
IF MOTOROLA OR NOKIA GETS HOLD OF THIS UH TOP THEN WE ARE IN TROUBLE 
UH HOPEFULLY IT BY THEN IT WILL BE PROTECTED AND AND EVERYTHING RIGHT 
IT'S IT'S UH IT'S ABOUT LISTEN THIS IS A SCIENCE 
I MEAN IT'S UH CONFIDENTIAL TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE NOT UH I UH PUBLISHING IT YET 
BUT WE WE WE OF OF COURSE WE WILL 
AND UH AND UH BUT UH WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT UH IF QUALCOMM HAS A INTEREST OF WHO'S FUNDING THE WORK TH THEY HAVE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO UH TO TO PATENT IT OR SOMETHING 
BUT THAT'S ABOUT ALL 
THIS IS NOT A PUBLIC UH PUBLIC UH PRESENTATION 
SO THIS I IS NOT EVEN A PROBLEM 
THE ONLY PROBLEM WOULD BE OF BUT YOU KNOW 
NOBODY CAN BEAT P PETR UH PETR MOTLICEK ANYMORE ON I MEAN IF EVEN IF IF NOKIA KNOWS EVERYTHING IF YOU IF YOU SELL IT TOMORROW WHO DID YOU WORK FOR THE THE UH UH TEXT ON 
AT H. P. H. P. 
THEY WILL TAKE HALF A YEAR BEFORE THEY WOULD EVEN REALISE WHAT IT IS 
AND BY THEN SO IT'S NOT NO PROBLEM 
OKAY 
SO THAT'S WHERE THAT'S UH THAT'S UH 
TO GET THE UH 
WHEN YOU COMP UH W WHAT YOU CAME WHEN YOU COMPRESS THE EFFECTIVELY THEY'LL WANT THE SIGNAL WHICH WE ARE MODELLING 
AND UH SO THEN YOU GET THE FITTING TO COMPRESS SIGNAL 
ESSENTIALLY IF YOU WERE IN SPECTRAL DOMAIN YOU WOULD COMPRESS THE POWER SPECTRUM 
HERE YOU COMPRESS THE THE THE THOSE TH THIS I TH WHAT FUL YEAH OF D. C. T. OF OF THE SIGNAL RIGHT 
AND SO THE W THEN YOU HAVE UH PREDICTOR IS FITTING ACTUALLY THIS COMPRESS SIGNAL 
BUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH C IT WAS COMPRESSED 
SO YOU CAN ALWAYS EXPAND IT BACK IS THAT YOU GET THE C THAT YOU GOT A FAT AT THE AT THE ORIGINAL THING 
EXCEPT THAT IF IT IS DIFFERENT 
BECAUSE UH TO UH THE BASICALLY THIS OPAL MODELING HAS A DIFFERENT PROPERTIES 
AND UH IT'S 
SO WE CAN TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT 
THIS IS AN UH SORT OF OLD TECHNIQUE WHICH UH IT 
AND IT WAS MY THESIS EVEN 
P. H. D. THESIS ACTUALLY 
A SMALL SORRY 
YEAH IT WAS S. T. L. P. WAS CALLED SPECTRAL TRANSFORM LINEAR PREDICTION 
IT WAS MY FIRST ICASSP PAPER EVER 
IT WAS UH IT NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE BOSTON 
YOU GUYS WERE STILL IN KINDERGARTEN RIGHT 
UH THIS IS TERRIBLE 
SO BUT NO NOBODY NOBODY WAS USING IT FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT IT WAS CUTE 
BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT 
AND UH AND BUT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THAT IS SINCE SINCE WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE WE ARE NORMAL L. P. C. IS FITTING UH PEAKS RIGHT 
BUT WHEN YOU ARE MODELING HILBERT ENVELOPE YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO FIT ONLY PEAKS 
YOU SOMETIMES WANT TO GET A BASICALLY GOOD ESTIMATE OF THE OF THE ENVELOPE 
SO THAT HELPS YOU 
BECAUSE IN THIS UH TH TH THIS SPECTRAL TRANSFORM ALLOWS YOU TO TO FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN HOW WELL IT FITS PEAKS 
HOW HOW WELL IT FITS DIPS AND UH AND YEAH 
AND SORT OF THE USE THIS IS G SO I THINK THAT BASICALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I MEAN YOU SHOULD BE ASKING QUESTIONS RIGHT 
SO 
YEAH 
SAPA 
AND THEN YEAH THIS IS A THOSE THEY ARE TWO APPEARS IN UH ONE IS IN SAPA ONE IS AN UH U. INTERSPEECH 
UH IN A C CHEJU 
AND ONE WAS IN THE U. S. R. U. 
IT WAS FROM VIRGIN ISLANDS 
SAPA WAS A S I I TELL YOU WHAT IT STANDS FOR STATISTIC AND DO NEED SOMETHING AD AND UH PERCEPTUAL APPROACHES 
I WAS ONE OF I WAS IN A IF WE S ORGANISING COMMITTEE 
I SHOULD KNOW 
BUT STATISTIC AND UH AND SOMETHING APPROACHES 
UH PE PERCEPTUA AND STATISTICS AND PERCEPTUAL A APPROACHES 
THAT WAS UH 
BUT THEY ARE THE SAME RIGHT SO UH SO UH AND THEN ALSO IS THERE IS SOME MORE WORK ACTUALLY CAN BE TRACED DOWN 
I THINK THERE WE UH THE READING LES ATLAS'S PAPERS ARE VERY GOOD 
BECAUSE LES ATLAS IS DOING A LOT OF WORK ON CODING IN THIS DOMAIN 
HE DOESN'T USE OPAL MODEL 
BUT HE USES D. C. T. AND THEN UH P UH IS THE S S AND IT AND ALSO IS EXCELLENT GUY 
HE'S VERY GOOD MATHEMAT MM UH VERY GOOD THEORETICIAN 
BASICALLY HE'S A HE'S AT STANFORD THE GUY 
AND UH REALLY UH LOOKS TO WRITE THINGS WELL 
SO HE'S VERY RIGOROUS UH AS OPPOSED TO USE IT UM FOR INSTANCE 
SO IF YOU READ THAT THEN IT THEN YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE NO ERRORS AND 
YEAH UH BUT UM SO WHATEVER YOU G WHATEVER YOU GET HANDS ON FROM LES ATLAS UH FOR OVER PAST FIVE YEARS UH REGARDI THIS TWO YEARS AGO 
LAST YEAR ON ONE OF THE ICASSPS HE HAD LIKE FIVE PAPERS RIGHT 
OR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS BECAUSE UH HE'S EAGER TO 
SO THAT IS 
I DIDN'T EVEN USE IT 
YEAH 
OR 
UH-HUH 
I DON'T 
TO FILL IN YEAH WITH ALL KINDS OF PARAMETERS 
UH HAS ALL KINDS OF SPEECH RECOGNITION RESULTS RIGHT 
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU START USING THE CLUSTER I REMEMBER OR SOME UH SOME PARALLEL PROCESSING 
THAT WAS A BIG THING HERE 
EVERYBODY HATED HIM FOR IT UH TEMPORARILY 
I REMEMBER 
UH-HUH 
I YEAH I REMEMBER FRANK CAME OUT UM AND SAYS IS EVERYBODY WAS COMPUTING LIKE MARIUS WE WOULD BE ALL DEAD 
BUT I SAY FRANK BUT I WANT EVERYBODY TO COMPUTE LIKE MARIUS 
AND 
WELL IT IS IMPORTANT YOU KNOW 
WHEREAS I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH WE NEVER TALK ABOUT RIGHT 
I HEAR IT HOW MUCH WORK UH DOES PUT IN UH HERE 
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE THIS THAT UH THAT THINGS SPED UP TREMENDOUSLY SINCE I COME 
I MEAN UH OF COURSE PARTIALLY BECAUSE THEY STARTED OUT BY SOME MORE UH MORE HARDWARE 
BUT ALSO BE UP SOME AT LEAST SOME PEOPLE BASICALLY KNOW HOW TO UH UH WRITE FASTER PROGRAMS 
UH THIS IS FANTASTIC 
AND USED TO BE TWO DAYS YEAH 
OH 
SO DO YOU ALREADY KNOW WHERE UH WHAT IS THE SITUATION WITH YOU 
YOU GO BACK TO PRAGUE FOR A WHILE 
AND THEN DID YOU GET ANYTHING ONE OF IN FRANCE 
I GOT SOME IDEAS BY THE WAY 
I YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
UH IT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S THE WOULD BE A PITY RIGHT 
YOU YOU C YOU TO SEE YOU DON'T IDEA OF HUNGER 
AND SO YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S NOT THE IDEA 
NO 
WE'LL WE'LL UH W WELL WE'LL TRY SOMETHING LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO 
UM 
SO JOEL YOUR MENU BASICALLY THING IS SO I TOLD YOU TO TO UH WHEN WE WERE WALKING THAT UH THAT WHATE WHATEVER PETR DID 
THAT IT DOESN'T DIE BUT IT I IT CARRIES 
AND OBVIOUSLY UH V WE VERY MUCH HOPE THAT YOU GET INTO THAT AND YOU GET EXCITED AND YOU DO IS MORE AND UH OUR UH MAYBE EVEN DIFFERENT THINGS 
BUT UH 
THAT IT ACTUALLY WORKS 
IT'S NOT THAT IT DOESN'T WORK 
OH 
YEAH 
THEN 
AND I AND THIS AND THIS IS ALL IN THE RECORD 
SO IF WE UH OF UH IF WE YOU CAN HOLD HIM TO HIS WORD 
J J YOU REWIND 
BROWSE THROUGH THE MEETING 
OKAY 
HOW WE DOING TIME WISE 
YEAH I THINK HALF HOUR IT'S FINE RIGHT 
BUT YOU WILL BE HERE UNTIL ALMOST UNTIL END OF UH 
YEAH 
SO BREAKS MY HEART 
IT'S JUST LIKE I WAS JUST START TEACHING AND THEN I N I'LL NEED AN ASSISTANT 
HMM 
YEAH MAYBE 
OH YEAH 
UH D HOPEFULLY IT'S MAKE M MAKES UH PAY PAY SOME EXTRA 
SO WE'LL SEE 
EITHER SPEECH 
UH BUT IT'S AC ACTUALLY COMPILATION OF UH REALLY COMPILATION OF TWO CLASSES I WAS GIVING AT O. G. I. WHICH IS LIKE SPEECH PROCESSING AND AND UH PERCEPTION 
AND SO I TRIED TO PUT IT TOGETHER SO THAT IT MAKES SOME SENSE 
NO 
NO 
I'VE IT'S UH I IT I SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST FOUR 
BECAUSE THIS IS A P LIKE UH GRADUATES 
BUT I HAVE ONE ALRIGHT 
GUARANTEED 
I HAVE ONE GUARANTEED THAT I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY ELSE IS UH 
UH UH 
SORRY 
I SEE I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT NEEDS TO BE FOR CREDIT OR NOT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I LIKE PEOPLE WITHOUT UH N NOT TAKING OUT FOR CREDIT BECAUSE THEN THEY JUST SIT THERE AND HAVING GOOD TIME 
BUT IT'S OKAY 
NO NO IT'S OKAY 
YEAH 
GUILLERMO IS TAKING VERY GOOD 
AND SO I'LL I. S. WHO ALREADY HAVE AT LEAST TWO 
IF UH 
YEAH WE PRO I PROBABLY GET FOUR 
AND UH IT'S POSSIBLE 
THAT'S FOR SURE 
I MEAN THAT'S 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THE NOTES NOTEBOOKS 
UH-HUH 
BUT THAT'S GOOD YOU KNOW 
IT'S UH 
I DIDN'T GET NOT TOO MANY THINGS ACTUALLY 
WE KNOW THE REASON WAS THAT AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT I WAS TEACHING WITH HERVE 
AND WE THOUGHT I WE HAVE MUCH MORE TIME 
AND SUDDENLY WE RAN OUT OF TIME BASICALLY BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT UH IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THREE HOUR LECTURE 
BUT IT WAS ONLY TWO HOUR LECTURE 
AND UH HERVE ASSUMED THAT IT'S GOING TO RUN LONGER 
OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE ASSUMED 
BUT SUDDENLY WE USE IS HE SAID WELL SO SO WHERE ARE YOU 
I SAID WELL I'M JUST SLOWLY GETTING INTO L. P. C. 
HE SAID WHY BUT I WE HAVE ONLY THREE MORE LECTURES 
I HAVE TO TEACH H. M. M. AND EVERYTHING 
SO I THE L. P. C. PART WAS LIKE I HAD TO DO IT IN AN HOUR 
AND THEN EVERYBODY WAS C TOTALLY CONFUSED I GUESS 
AND 
YEAH THEY WERE ALSO CONFUSED 
YEAH 
IT WAS TO D. B. F. L. YEAH 
BUT 
UH WE'LL SEE 
OKAY GUYS 
I THINK THAT UM THIS UNLESS SOMEBODY HAS UH STILL ANYTHING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT 
RIGHT IT'S UH JU IT'S A LITTLE BIT UP TO YOU 
YOU HAVE TO P YOU HAVE TO BACK THIS UH UH UH H SPECIALLY PETR 
BECAUSE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT AND YEAH 
YEAH 
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WILL BE DONE BY MY 
SO IT PLAN 
I THINK SO 
YEAH WE MADE A MISTAKE I TELL YOU 
I THINK IF I HAD TO DO IT AGAIN AND WE MADE A MISTAKE WE SHOULD HAVE REGISTER YOU HEAR IT I. P. F. L. 
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A DEGREE BY NOW FROM E. P. F. L. 
YEAH THAT WAS A MISTAKE 
SORRY YOURS YOU WERE OR YOU WERE HERE TO YOU WERE YOU WERE HERE HOW LONG YOU WERE HERE 
TWO YEARS 
YEAH 
WHERE ARE THE 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
SO SO SHE GETTING UH UH ANOTHER POSITION THERE 
OR WHAT IS THE RE REASON OF WHAT A BOYFRIEND HUH 
UH I SEE 
SO THAT'S GOOD 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I KNOW 
YEAH 
UM OKAY 
OTHERWISE I AM ALSO MUCH MORE AVAILABLE THAN I WAS 
I MEAN WHEN YOU CAME OUT WAS JUST LIKE CRA ONE OF THE CRAZIEST UH UH TIMES OF THIS YEAR 
UH UH IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THAT I WAS VERY PRODUCTIVE THAT I WAS DOING ANYTHING USEFUL 
BUT IT JUST LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE WRITING THESIS ALL THE TIME RE WRITING AND CHANGE THE D MAKE A LITTLE CHANGES AND UH UH AND 
YEAH HE'S VER NO HE HAS MANY MORE SP MANY MORE PEOPLE USE TO TAKE CARE OF 
YEAH 
WELL I'M TYPICALLY I TRY TO BE BECAUSE UH BECAUSE YOU KNOW I MEAN FOR US THIS IS ALSO MY LIVELIHOOD RIGHT STUDENTS 
SO I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT UH THEY NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING THAT UH AS FEEL FREE BASICALLY TO STOP BY ANY TIME AND UM YEAH AND UH IT'S NOT THAT I KNOW EVERYTHING 
BUT 
IF I KNOW I UH I THINK I SORT OF KNOW A LITTLE BIT LIKE WHAT YOU GUYS WERE DOI UH DOING RIGHT 
BUT NOT UH NOT OBVI EVERY DETAIL OBVIOUSLY 
YEAH 
WHAT YEAH YOU DON'T KNOW WHY WHY YOU ARE DOING IT ANYMORE 
YEAH 
UH BY 
YEAH 
OOPS 
OKAY I THINK MY MIC IS FALLING FALLING 
SO I THINK WE GO HUH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THANKS A LOT 
NO I'M GOING TO LISTEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
SPEECH CODING 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL THAT'S UH YEAH 
SO 
UH WELL UH SO BASICALLY I STARTED READING ABOUT THE FEATURES THAT'S TAKING THE LONG TEMPORAL AND UH TIME FRAME THAT'S UH TRAPS 
AND UH TANDEM APPROACH 
YEAH SO YEAH YEAH 
SO THEN I ALSO STARTED WITH THE THERE WAS A PAPER ON UH FITTING A EAR MODEL TO THE D. C. T. OF A SIGNAL 
STARTED WITH THAT AND SLOWLY GETTING USED TO THE STUFF 
SO 
YEAH 
UH I THINK YEAH YEAH 
IT'S UH THE PAPER BY DAN ELLIS AND C 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
U. S. R. U. 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR I GUESS YEAH 
TWO THOUSAND THREE YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
SO FAR 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THEN I CONTINUED WITH UH ANOTHER UH PAPER THAT YOU ARE MENTIONING L. P. TRAP 
SO I JUST MOVING AROUND WITH THAT DOES 
AND ALSO UH THE MAIN IDEA TODAY WHY I TOLD MAYBE IS LIKE IF YOU CAN LIST DOWN WHAT ALL THINGS ARE THERE TO BE TAKEN CARE OF 
THEN ONE BY ONE 
BECAUSE FINALLY FACE FIND I DO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE 
SO UH MAYBE AT LEAST DOWN THE THINGS OTHER THAN THE WHAT I'VE ALREADY TAKEN FROM YOU 
AND ALSO TO DISCUSS GENERALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
FEATURE EXTRACTION 
PART TANDEM TRAINING 
'KAY 
SO YEAH RIGHT NOW I HAVE THE FEATURE EXTRACTION PART WHERE I CAN GET THE PHONEME POSTERIORS AND THROUGH THE NEURAL NET 
SO THEN I THINK I NEED YEAH 
YEAH I YEAH BUT UH YEAH IT'S T. K. THROUGH FOR SOME OTHER TASK I'VE RUN IT'S T. K. 
SO I HAVE THE GENERAL FEEL 
BUT UH MAYBE I CAN TAKE THE INTERCEPTOR FROM YOU AND RUN IT ONCE IN MY TO HAVE TO 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
BASICALLY 
SO THEN I CAN CAN SHARE WHAT I C HAVE RED AND UH 
YEAH 
YES 
SO I'LL SEE THIS 
YEAH THE 
LET'S DO THE FEATURE EXTRACTION THAT WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THEN THE BACK AND FOR THAT 
THEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH SO YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TRAPS I KNOW 
BUT THOUGH WITH VARIOUS 
OKAY 
LENGTH 
OH 
OKAY 
FROM 
OKAY

MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM

OKAY 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
IT'S ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S OUR 
YEAH 
SO COMPRESSION BASICALLY YOU ARE LOOKING AT I GUESS YEAH 
MM-HMM 
CODING 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
NO THAT'S FOR COMPRESSION 
I DON'T NEED FOR FOR COMPRESSION YOU BASICALLY DON'T NEED THE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND P. L. P. 
TRIANGLE 
OH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
THE SPEECH SIGNAL YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY

MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BECAUSE 
YEAH SO MAYBE YOU CAN USE THE BOARD FOR THAT YEAH 
CAN WE REMOVE THIS WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO THIS PLACE 
OH 
PERIODIC PULSE YEAH 
BUT THIS IS UH 
YEAH 
THIS IS LIKE A RESIDUAL FOR HIM 
YEAH IN THE FOR UH FREQUENCY TO USE 
FOR ANY OBJECT YOU MEASURE YOU USE FOR UH A RECONSTRUCTED SIGNAL AND UH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
H. P. 
SO WHAT IS THE COMPRESSION FACTOR WE ARE GETTING HERE 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
YES 
MM-HMM 
TO FIT THE THE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM 
COMING BACK THOUGH 
YES 
YES 
ENVELOPE YEAH 
YEAH 
UH ONE THING I WANTED TO KNOW SO ANY UM A GOOD LITERATURE ON THESE LINES 
UH WHERE YOU STARTED WITH YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S N YEAH O UH THE UH 
I HAVE TWO WITH THE 
INTERSPEECH PAPER I

YES 
OH YEAH 
WELL REGARDING THIS F. D. L. P. 
YEAH 
HE DOESN'T SOUND 
YEAH 
YES 
YES 
SO 
YEAH 
NOVEMBER 
OKAY 
YES 
YEAH 
BE THERE I MEAN FOR CREDITS 
OR UH A TOTAL OF FOUR 
OH 
YEAH 
BECAUSE AS AS AN A. S. IT'S FOR UH CREDITS AND UH GUILLERMO IS TAKING I THINK HE'S G YEAH 
NOTEBOOKS 
MM-HMM 
WHERE WAS THIS 
NO OKAY 
YEAH 
BUT I CAN COME TO YEAH 
LATER 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
SO IN CASE I NEED SOMETHING ON THIS F. D. L. P. I'LL COME TO YOU 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
TAKES YOUR UH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YES 
YEAH THANKS 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OK OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
SO DO YOU KNOW UH WHICH WAY YOU GIVE THE FEEDBACK 
LIGHT OR I SAW SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OKAY 
HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MAYBE MORE COMPLEX YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THE 
HMM 
BUT YEAH 
AT THE BORDER BASICALLY SOME DISTANCE 
OR 
OKAY 
O OKAY 
OBVIOUSLY YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
BUT DON'T YEAH 
DON'T YOU THINK WITH A BEAM ALSO YOU HAVE LESS PROBLEMS WITH THE SHOTS 
OR YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
CONFUSING YEAH 
HMM 
OKAY 
NO IT'S A CHOICE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEP 
OKAY 
YEAH 
BUT PHYSICALLY IT'S JUST UH SOMETHING FLAT ON THE TABLE AGAIN YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH SO IT'S DIFFERENT BUT STILL UH YEAH IT'S SAME 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
HMM 
RIGHT 
HMM 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OR TOO LONG 
UH JUST KIDDING 
OKAY 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UH SO YOU UH Y YOU MIGHT HAVE MULTIPLE COLOURS 
OR YEAH 
SORRY DIDN'T GET THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
HMM 
NO IT'S QUITE CLEAR 
SO UH I GUESS YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH AN ARRAY MAYBE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OR YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S GOOD IDEA 
JUST GIVE SOME QUESTIONS UH 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YOU MEAN THE TOP OF THE WAVE FORM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OH 
OKAY 
HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
SEPARATION UH 
YEAH 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL YOU NEED A CAMERA 
OBVIOUSLY 
I MEAN WELL YOU HAVE A CAMERA 
MAYBE YOU CAN DETECT BREATHING 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT YOU COULD DO 
OR IN THE TABLE UH THERE SHOULD BE WELL 
OKAY UH 
OKAY 
MM 
WELL 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO YOU I THINK GUILLAUME SAID THAT'S OPTIC SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OR 
OKAY 
SO YOU YOU NEED A DIFFERENT YOU NEED A MICROPHONE WITH UM A DEVICE INSIDE RIGHT 
UH HOW DOES IT WORK 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM 
HMM 
IT'S ANOTHER FIRE WIRE OR NOT FIRE WIRE BUT UM 
OKAY 
BUT CONCRETELY YOU WOULD USE THAT TO GET HIGHER QUALITY SIGNALS 
YE THAT'S ALL 
YEAH 
OH OKAY OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
OKAY 
AND HOW 
HMM 
HMM 
YOU MEAN YOU MEANT EIGHT KILO UH SAMPLING FREQUENCY 
YEAH 
UH WE USE SIXTEEN 
SO THAT'S EIGHT KILO BAND WIDTH 
SIXTEEN KILO UH SAMPLING FREQUENCY 
IT IT'S NOT BAD 
UH IT'S QUITE DECENT 
UM 
MM F BEFORE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS UH TH THERE'S ALSO A POINT OF UH PRECISION OF LOCALIZATION IF YOU USE AN ARRAY 
SO IF YOU USE HIGHER FREQUENCIES YOU CAN GET MORE PRECISE LOCALIZATION 
BUT MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED TO 
UH THAT I CAN'T ANSWER DIRECTLY 
UH IT DEPENDS ON YOUR SET UP YOU KNOW 
UM YOU HAVE TO TEST BASICALLY 
UM 
YOU YOU GET UH THE ANGLE 
THE MOST PRECISE ONE IS THE ASYMMET IN THE HORIZONTAL PLANE 
THEN YOU ALSO GET ELEVATION 
BUT IT'S NOT VERY PRECISE 
IT'S MORE OF AN INDICATION 
AND RADIUS IS VERY BAD 
IF YOU USE A PLANAR GEOMETRY LIKE THIS ONE 
YEAH 
UM YOU CAN USE MULTIPLE ONES AND DO SOME UM UM TRIANGULATION 
EIGHT EIGHT 
THESE ARE ONLY SCREWS 
MICROPHONES ARE ON BOTTOM 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
A CUBE 
OKAY 
YEAH THEN YOU MIGHT GET UH BETTER DIRECTION IN ELEVATION 
BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S REALLY RELEVANT 
UM ONE 
SO 
UH IF PEOPLE MOVE FORWARD YEAH 
UH THE RADIUS 
TH THEN THE OR THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE GEOMETRY IT'S THE UM I YOU NEED MORE THAN ONE BASICALLY 
WITH ONE YOU WILL ONLY GET DIRECTION 
MICROPHONE ARRAY 
SO 
MM 
DIRECTION YEAH 
UM 
YEAH 
IT'S A DIFFERENT OPTION YEAH 
UM WE HAVEN'T TRIED THAT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE SPECIAL KIND OF TABLE 
MORE UH THIS IS NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT WE HAVE LIKE A BOX JUST BRING THE BOX AND PUT IT 
SO IT UH WE COULD NOT CONSIDER THAT 
BUT IN YOUR CASE IT COULD BE INTERESTING YEAH 
UNLESS PEOPLE PUT SOMETHING ON THE MICROPHONE 
BUT UM 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
BUT THAT I'M I THINK AFTER THE MEETING WE CAN GO AND TALK TO OLIVIER ABOUT THAT 
I'M NOT THE PERSON FOR HARDWARE 
YEAH 
YEAH I'LL T I'LL TRY TO PRESENT UH I GUESS IT CORRESPONDS TO YOUR QUESTIONS 
YEAH 
SO THE THE LOWEST LAYER WOULD BE THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS 
UM YOU ASKED ABOUT HOW TO DETECT UM ACTIVITY 
CURRENTLY YOU'RE THRESHOLDING THE T MAXIMUM OF YOUR WAVE FORM RIGHT 
UH UH 
OKAY 
AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PEAK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
OKAY 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND YOUR SECOND QUESTION UH WAS ABOUT F. F. T. WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH F. F. T. 
SO UM THE APPROACH WE'RE TAKING HERE IS TO ANSWER BOTH QUESTIONS THE SAME TIME 
WE USE F. F. T. TO DO DETECTION 
WE DON'T USE THE WAVE FORM THE RAW WAVE FORM 
SO UM 
WE SPLIT UM WE SPLIT THE SIGNAL IN SMALL FRAMES LIKE SIXTEEN MILLISECOND 
SIXTEEN 
UM EACH FRAME IS TAKING THIRTY TWO MILLISECOND OF SIGNAL JUST TO GIVE AN IDEA 
AND THERE IS A ONE FRAME EVERY SIXTEEN MILLISECOND AND THEY OVERLAP OF FIFTY PERCENT 
UM 
YEAH 
EACH SIXTEEN MILLISECOND 
WELL TH THOSE ARE DETAILS 
IT'S JUST TO GIVE AN IDEA 
UM 
WELL IT'S UH THE THE C 
BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN YOU DO F. F. T. YOU IF I'M GETTING INTO DETAILS BUT YOU YOU APPLY UM A WINDOW TO AVOID EFFECT 
SO THE BEGINNING AND THE AND IT IT I IT'S NOT CRAPPY 
IT'S JUST NOT VERY MUCH REP REPRESENTED BECAUSE YOU APPLY UM A WINDOW WHICH HAS THIS SHAPE HAVING WINDOW 
SO THEY'RE VERY YEAH 
NO I'M SAYING UH WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR SIGNAL YOU TAKE ONE FRAME YOU APPLY THE WINDOW UH AND THE WINDOW IS SIMPLY UH COEFFICIENTS YOU GIVE 
AND YOU GIVE HIGHER COEFFICIENT TO THE MIDDLE THEN AT THE EXTREME 
SO IF YOU DON'T DO OVERLAP Y YOU WILL LOSE INFORMATION TO THE BEGINNING AND THE END 
OKAY 
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO OVERLAP 
I MEAN UH IT'S UM 
HMM 
UM C. M. A. ONE 
SO IT FROM C. M. A. 
UM UH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
F. F. T. IS ONLY A TAIL 
UH UM UH WHAT WE DO RELEASE A PHASE DOMAIN ANALYSIS 
WE ONLY USE THE PHASE BETWEEN THE MICROPHONES 
UM 
YEAH BUT ALSO FOR DETECTION 
YEAH 
UM WE HAVE A WAY SO UM I DON'T THINK I SHOULD GET INTO DETAILS 
BUT BASICALLY THE BEGINNING IS YOUR SIGNAL WHICH YOU SLICE INTO FRAME 
YOU DO F. F. T. ON EACH MIC 
AND THE END SO UM A NUMBER OF UH FREQUENCY BEAMS WHICH ARE USED BY EACH PERSON TO UH EXPLAIN ROUGHLY 
SO SO WHEN YOU SPEAK SPEECH AS WIDE BAND 
SO UM THE MORE ACTIVE YOU ARE THE MORE BAND WIDTH YOU SEE 
SO YOU WILL GET A LARGE VALUE OF BAND WIDTH FOR PEOPLE WHO SPEAK 
AND UH FOR THE OTHERS IT WILL RANDOM 
IT WILL BE A SMALL VALUE 
OR JUST BACKGROUND NOISE 
AND SO UH 
YEAH 
'CAUSE NO PROBLEM IF YOU USE ENERGY BASED METHODS WHICH IS PROBABLY MORE UH THE THING YOU'VE BEEN USING AS FAR 
SO THAT IT'S NOT UM QUITE RELATED TO LOCATION 
SO YOU CAN HAVE UM UH FOR ONE PERSON YOU CAN HAVE UH A HIGH ENERGY SIGNAL WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE AND VISA VERSA 
UM I THINK IN YOUR CASE YOU'RE QUITE INTERESTED IN THE LOCATION 
SO I WOULD ADVISE TO ME IS MORE UH PHASE DOMAIN METHODS 
UM 
ONCE YOU HAVE THE FIFTY FOR EACH FREQUENCY YOU HAVE UH THE MAGNITUDE AND THE PHASE 
SO YOU CAN COMPARE THE PHASE OF THE MICROPHONES 
AND THIS IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE DIRECTION OF THE PERSON 
UM 
SOMETIMES WE USE IT BUT NOT IT'S NOT THE FIRST THING WE USE 
I KNOW IT'S A BIT COUNTERINTUITIVE 
BUT UM MAYBE I'LL GO TO TO THE BOARD 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OR RIGHT FOR A SINGLE CHANNEL IT'S NOT VERY MEANINGFUL 
BUT HERE IT'S RELATIVE PHASE BETWEEN THE MICROPHONES 
SO UH I'LL JUST TRY TO UM S SUMMARISE 
NO THAT'S WHAT I DON'T DO 
UM THIS WOULD BE VALID FOR UH LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH A SINGLE CHANNEL 
THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA 
BUT IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE MULTIPLE CHANNELS 
UM 
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE FOUR OF THEM 
WITH F. F. T. YOU CAN JUST UH SO I SAID L LOOK AT THE PHASE BETWEEN THE MICROPHONES AT A GIVEN FREQUENCY 
UM IT IS LINKED TO THIS VALUE YEAH 
UH BASICALLY THE TIME YOU'RE MENTIONING IS THIS VALUE 
AND THIS IS THE FREQUENCY 
AND THIS IS AN ANGLE IN RADIANS 
SO UH F. F. T. GIVES YOU A MEASURE OF THESE VALUES 
UH THIS I CAN POINT TO A PAPER UH I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING 
BUT WILL GIVE YOU IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR TABLE UH WHAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED HERE 
SO ONE APPROACH WHERE UM THE UH YOU DIVIDE THE SPACE IN SECTORS 
FOR EXAMPLE TEN SECTORS AROUND THE TABLE 
AND UH 
IN EACH SECTOR YOU WILL GET THE VALUE 
NO 
IT'S UH APPLICATION DEPENDENT 
FOR EXAMPLE UM 
WELL THIS IS NOT 
AND IN THIS ONE YOU COULD HAVE A LARGE VALUE 
NO NO NO THOSE ONES SMALL VALUES 
UH THESE ARE NUMBER FREQUENCIES 
WHICH WE ESTIMATE WITH SEVERAL STEPS FROM THESE MEASURES 
SO TO CONCLUDE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS UH WE ESTIMATE HOW MUCH OF THE FREQUENCY SPECTRUM YOU ARE OCCUPYING WHEN YOU SPEAK 
OR I AM OCCUPYING IN THIS DIRECTION WHEN I SPEAK 
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT UM THIS IS QUITE GOOD TO DO UH DETECTION AND LOCALIZATION AT THE SAME TIME 
BEC BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN A SECTOR SPACE THERE IS UH UH THIS MUCH ACTIVITY 
YEAH YEAH 
UM 
MORE RECENTLY UM I'VE WORKED ON UH 
UM PROLONGATING THIS WITH A MORE PRECISE DIRECTION EVALUATION TO KNOW WHERE IN THE SECTOR THE PERSON IS 
SO THAT UH THAT'S NOT MUCH WORK 
ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS THIS IS CAN BE THIS CAN BE DONE QUITE QUICKLY 
THEN YOU 
YEAH Y WELL I I SEE A VALUE 
BUT THEN YOU'LL GET TWO LARGE VALUES 
YEAH 
SO 
NO 
JUST DIRECTION 
YEAH 
WELL F YEAH I IT'S NOT UH I IT'S AN INHERENT PROBLEM TO THE GEOMETRY YOU SEE 
YOU CAN FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU USE ANOTHER ARRAY UH YOU CAN INTERSECT LINES OF DIRECTION 
OH 
MM MAYBE 
UH UH I W MM I WOULDN'T TRUST TOO TOO MUCH 
CLASSICALLY WHAT YOU DO SO YOU EXTRACT THE SIGNAL OF THE PERSON 
UM AN INTERESTING THING IS THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE NOT UH ARBITRARY THINGS 
THEY REPRESENT THE NUMBER FREQUENCIES WHERE A GIVEN PERSON IS DOMINANT 
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TWO OF THEM WHICH MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR SEPARATION 
YOU KNOW ALREADY WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THIS PROCESSING UH W WHICH PART OF THE FREQUENCIES OF THE SPECTRUM UM BELONGS TO THIS PERSON AND IT THAT PERSON 
AND THEN IT'S EASY TO SEPARATE THE SIGNALS 
UM BOTH 
IT'S IT'S MORE AN INSTANTANEOUS UM THIS IS STILL INSTANTANEOUS 
THIS IS FOR ONE TIME FRAME 
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL YOUR FREQUENCIES FOR EXAMPLE UH ZERO TO FOUR KILOHERTZ 
UM 
YOU CAN SPLIT IT AND SAY UH ALL THESE PARTS BELONG TO PERSON IN HERE 
AND UH ALL THE OTHER PARTS BELONG TO THE OTHER PERSON 
THAT'S CORRECT 
BUT THEN UH YOU CAN LOOK STATISTICALLY IT W IT WILL BE NEGLIGIBLE UM BECAUSE THE AREA OF UH OF THE DIFFERENCE LEVEL 
YEAH 
IT'S UH YOU CAN LISTEN TO TO YEAH 
AND THEN YOU CAN DO SOME UH MAYBE HIGHER LEVEL UM ANALYSIS WHERE YOU GET THE PITCH OF THE PERSON OR 
THIS 
YEAH YEAH 
AND THIS IS 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
THEN IT'S UH RANDOM 
AND THAT'S WHY YOU GET THESE VALUES UH WHICH ARE RANDOM 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THIS IS VERY RARE 
AND WHEN IT HAPPENS ONE IS ALWAYS MASKING THE OTHER IN PRACTICE 
SO UM 
YEAH 
NO NO 
BUT UH I'VE I'VE SEEN QUITE A FEW PAPERS I I'VE NO NOT DONE IT MYSELF 
I'M REALLY IN THE LOWEST LEVEL 
UM BUT UH ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS IS I SAID 
YOU CAN UH SEPARATE THE SIGNALS 
AND UM 
DO DO PROCESSING 
OH 
SO UH YOU CAN GET PITCH RATE OF SPEECH 
THAT'S QUITE EASY 
PITCH UM THE UH UH TIMBRE EN FRANCAIS 
UM SO UH FOR DIFFERENT PERSON THIS MIGHT BE QUITE DIFFERENT 
AT LEAST FOR MALE FEMALES 
AND UH RATE OF SPEECH 
LIKE IF SOMEBODY IS TALKING VERY UH IN A VERY ENERGETIC MANNER IT MIGHT BE QUITE FAST 
UH OR JUST ENERGY ALSO 
NO 
YEAH ALSO 
UM THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE WITH PEOPLE ARE BRINGING LAPTOPS 
UM 
THEY WILL BE YEAH 
THEY MIGHT BE DETECTED AS ANOTHER ANOTHER SOURCE 
UH SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO UH CLASSIFY THE SOURCES AS HUMAN OR MACHINE 
BUT AGAIN YEAH I THINK ONCE YOU USE THE SPECTRUM IF IT'S JUST PURE AND STABLE 
OH 
ALSO YEAH IF IF THERE'S NO PITCH 
SO UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO ALL WILL GO AND BE DETECTED THERE 
YEAH 
SO W WHAT YOU'RE MENTIONING IS A PAIN FOR US 
BUT FOR YOU IT MIGHT BE 'CAUSE WE'RE ONLY INTERESTING IN GETTING THE SPEECH 
BUT FOR YOU IT MIGHT BE QUITE UH QUITE GOOD YEAH 
SO I'VE TO AVOID UH FILTERING AND SOMETHING 
'CAUSE AS SOON AS YOU DO THAT UM YOU EXCLUDE SOME OF THE INFORMATION 
SO IT'S BETTER TO KEEP IT FOR THE LATEST STAGE 
SO UM UM ON TOP OF THIS THERE'S ANOTHER PART UH WHICH IS MORE LINKED TO THE TRACKING 
ALL THIS WAS FOR ONE TIME FRAME 
SO UM 
YEAH YOU CAN PLAY WITH IT 
UM IN SPEECH IT'S UH STATIONARY OVER TEN TWENTY MILLISECOND 
AND WE MAKE A STATIONARY ASSUMPTION A LOCAL STATIONARY T. ASSUMPTION UM WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO USE F. F. T. AND BLAH BLAH BLAH 
UH NOW IN SPITE OF THAT I KNOW SOME PEOPLE AS MUCH LONGER WINDOWS WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM 
BUT 
UH IT'S A BIT TOO MUCH I THINK 
UH LIKE SOME VERY SMALL WORDS LIKE YES THEY MIGHT BE TWO HUNDRED MILLISECOND 
OR THREE HUNDRED MILLISECOND 
UM 
YEAH THEY MIGHT BE BLURRED WITH UH SILENCE 
SO YES 
YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PLAY WITH IT JUST TO SAVE PROCESSING TIME LIKE IS SLIGHTLY LONGER FRAMES 
YEAH IT UM IT MUST YEAH 
UM 
SIMPLY BECAUSE I'VE USED ONE HUNDRED AS A MINIMUM LENGTH OF A SPEECH WORD 
YEAH SO 
UM 
NOW ASSUMING YOU HAVE DONE THIS FOR EACH TIME 
I IF THIS IS YOUR DETAIL OR I SHOULD USE A DIFFERENT 
UM 
IF THIS IS YOUR ASYMMET AT EACH TIME YOU GOT A DIRECTION 
SO ASYMMET IS YOUR DIRECTION IN HORIZONTAL PLANE 
IT'S AN ANGLE 
LIKE NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST 
AND 
YEAH 
NO ONE OF THIS IS UH REALLY DIFFERENT 
I'M JUST SAYING THAT UH ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS FOR A GIVEN TIME FRAME YOU CAN HAVE A DIRECTION OF THE PERSON AT LEAST IN TERMS OF SECTOR 
AND IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO GIVE A MORE PRECISE DIRECTION QUITE QUICKLY 
SO UH THIS WAS KIND OF THE LOWEST LAYER 
NOW THIS IS A LAYER JUST ABOVE IT WHICH MIGHT INTEREST YOU 
UM IF YOU REPEAT THAT OVER TIME 
YOU WILL SEE PATTERNS UM 
FOR EXAMPLE UH T TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS 
TWO DIFFERENT PERSON WILL SPEAK 
SO YOU CAN CLUSTER THOSE 
AND YOU WILL SEE THAT UH IF IT'S LONG ENOUGH IT'S SOME SIGNIFICANT EVENT 
UM THIS CAN BE DONE QUITE CHEAPLY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
A COST 
YEAH THE 
UM WELL I USE MATLAB 
SO IT'S NOT PERFECT 
IT'S LIKE THREE FOUR 
YEAH 
BUT NOT EVERYTHING IS UH UM SIMPLE LINEAR 
ESPECIALLY THIS PART 
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT LINEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT A MAXIMUM ENERGY IN A FREQUENCY KIND OF 
THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART IS HERE 
WITH MATLAB I HAVE THREE FOUR TIMES REAL TIME 
UM YOU CAN DO SUB OPTIMAL PROCESSING AND UH FOR EXAMPLE HERE I'M CONSIDERING ALL POSSIBLE PAIRS OF MICROPHONES 
UH WHICH IS TWENTY EIGHT AND THE PROCESSING IS DIRECTLY UM R PROPORTIONAL TO THAT 
SO UM YOU CAN SAVE ON THAT 
BUT THEN YOU ALSO A LITTLE BIT ON PRECISION 
ALSO I I'M USING ALL THE SMALL FRAMES WITH FIFTY PERCENT OVERLAP 
I DON'T THINK YOU REALLY NEED ABSOLUTELY TO DO THAT 
IT'S NOT THAT GOOD IN TERMS OF UH DIRECTION 
UM 
YEAH I WOULD BE CAREFUL WITH THAT 
LIKE FIVE SIX IS UH DECENT 
UH SIX I WOULD SAY YEAH 
EIGHT YEAH UH I GET DOWN NOW IT IN TWO DEGREES UH ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR 
UH SO YOU MIGHT NOT AND THAT 
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN 
MIGHT NOT BE 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO IT COULD BE SUFFICIENT TO UH YEAH DEFINE ENOUGH SECTORS AND 
NO 
NO 
SO IT'S ARBITRARY 
I IS TWENTY DEGREE SECTORS 
UH 'CAUSE I HAD TO CHOOSE A VALUE 
BUT IT'S UP TO YOU 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY YEAH 
IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE HAVING A LAPEL YEAH 
UM 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD IDEA ACTUALLY 
UM 
WELL UH 
IF YOU ARE ABLE TO CALIBRATE YOUR MICROPHONES UM THE ONES WHO ARE CLOSER TO THE PERSON WILL GET MORE ENERGY 
UM SO YOU CAN COMPARE THAT 
IT'S POSSIBLE 
SO 
YEAH 
UM 
I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT 
UM 
IN THE SIDE I'VE DONE SOME SINGLE CHANNEL WORK WHICH CAN MAYBE HELP 
UM 'CAUSE UH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE NOT DEFINITE ON THE GEOMETRY RIGHT 
YEAH 
UM UM THIS PART IS QUITE SPECIFIC TO A MICROPHONE ARRAY WHERE LIKE THEY ARE CONCENTRATED ON UH SOME PLACE LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT YOU CAN KIND OF COME BACK TO THAT ALSO 
UM 
UH F. F. T. ALSO 
YEAH YEAH 
OR RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
IT HAS TO BE IS GOOD AS POSSIBLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TRUE 
YEAH 
WE CAN ALSO CONSIDER DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONES 
YOU KNOW ONE 
UM SO YOU CAN UH THEIR PATTERN IS UH NOT UH THE SAME UH DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION WHERE THE PERSON IS 
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE WAS A DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONE POINTING THERE YOU WOULD GET MOST OF MY ENERGY BIT LESS FROM YOU ET CETERA 
YOU CAN ALSO DO MICROPHONE ARRAYS WITH DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONES 
UH M MIGHT NOT BE RELEVANT 
BUT UM 
OH 
MORE OR LESS 
IT'S IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT 
I MEAN UH I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
THEY'RE O YEAH OMNI DIRECTIONAL YEAH 
UM UH I GUESS SO 
IT'S THE SAME YEAH 
EXACTLY THE SAME YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
QUITE EXPENSIVE 
YEAH THEY ARE UM HIGH QUALITY MICS 
UH I THINK WE CAN LEAVE THIS QUESTION FOR OLIVIER 
YEAH 
NO NO 
YOU YOU WOULD UH ASSUME 
UH YOU WOULD NEGLECT IT 
THE TIME DELAY IS IS VERY SMALL 
IT IT'S ONLY USED FOR UH GETTING THE A DIRECTION WHEN YOU HAVE A MICROPHONE ARRAY 
BUT IN THAT CASE IT'S NOT RELEVANT 
UM YOU WOULD ASSUME THAT THEY ARE ROUGHLY SYNCHRONISED NOT NECESSARILY VERY PRECISELY AND UM COMPARE THE ENERGY LEVELS 
BUT I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH THAT 
UM 
NOW I DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO USE UH IT'S ALMOST OKAY 
YES 
NO 
I DON'T UH 
WELL I GUESS IT'S JUST A RESTRICTION WE TAKE 
SO SO WE DON'T UH THE M AMOUNT OF MONEY WE HAVE TO SPEND 
OTHERWISE WE COULD HAVE UH WE COULD IMAGINE TO HAVE A WHOLE TABLE OF OF UH AS WELL OF L. E. D. S 
AND THEN YOU YOU CAN REALLY START TO TO SOME REGIONS OF THE TABLE 
SO YEAH 
UH LET'S 
DOES 
YEAH I CAN JUST EXPLAIN MY PROJECT 
IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THIS ONE 
WELL IT'S ALSO ABOUT TABLES BUT THE IDEA IS OF UH UH THE SEVERAL STUDENTS COME TO A TABLE WITH THEIR LAPTOPS 
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO SHARE INFORMATION EASILY 
AND UH IN FACT W WHAT WE WE ARE DOING NOW WE PROJECT UM ANOTHER SCREEN ON ON THE TABLE 
AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE ABLE TO USE THEIR THEIR MOUSE OF THEIR LAPTOP TO GO TO THE AT THE PROJECT SCREEN THERE AND UH THE PROJECT SCREEN IS JUST ANOTHER WINDOWS MACHINE THAT IS RUNNING 
SO YOU JUST HAVE ANOTHER F COMPUTER MORE OR LESS YOU CAN SEE BUT YOU CAN USE IT WITH YOUR YOUR OWN MOUSE AND KEYBOARD 
EXACTLY 
BUT UH IN CONTRARY TO TO HAVING AL ANOTHER KEYBOARD AND MOUSE THAT ONLY ONE PERSON CAN SEE 
NOW THE DIFFERENT PERSONS CAN USE THE THE SCREEN UM AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE WITH THE MOUSE 
I'LL S STILL THE SAME SUBJECTS 
IT'S IT'S COLLABORATIVE WORK 
BUT UH 
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH UH DO PROCESSING AND UH L. E. D. 
SO 
ANYWAY UH I THINK THE THE DETAILS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT THAT IMPORTANT 
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT FIRST WE WANT TO TO HAVE SOME EVENTS LIKE TWO PEOPLE ARE TALKING OR NO NO STARTED AND ANOTHER STARTED AND UH WELL 
MORE OR LESS BROKE INTO THE SPEECH OF THE FIRST PERSON AND SO NO 
AND THEN YOU CAN START TO VISUALISE THIS UH DIFFERENT SITUATIONS 
WELL THAT'S UH I GUESS IT'S FIRST PROTOTYPE I YOU SO WE START WITH UH PEOPLE TWO PEOPLE TALK OR AND DON'T NEED DON'T THEY 
UH AFTERWARDS UH ONE COULD IMAGINE THAT YOU FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN DETECT THAT SOMEONE IS A BIT ANGRY OR IS UH YELLING 
AND W WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS WITH UH WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS ON ON TABLE YOU COULD UH DISPLAY THIS THIS UH GIVE SOME FEEDBACK 
BUT UH 
YEP 
THAT'S UH 
ONCE WE GET THE HARDWARE 
MM 
YES 
EVERYTHING FROM UM MULTI SWITCH ADMINISTRATION OF UH AUDIO AND HOW YOU CAN UH ANALYSE IT UH WHAT INFORMATION YOU CAN GET OUT OF SPEECH AND SO NO 
SO 
PROBABLY IT'S UH IT'S F BE A GOOD IDEA OF YOU HAVE IS TWO UH WITH UM WITH SOURCE LIKE UH BOOKS OR WEB PAGE CENTRE 
GIVE A LOT OF INFORMATION HOW IT IS AUDIO PROGRAMMING AND SO ON WORKS CETERA 
MAYBE YOU YOU KNOW SOME AT LEAST A GOOD BOOK THAT'S UH DEALING WITH THIS STUFF 
MM-HMM 
AND AS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS IN REAL TIME 
THAT'S UH 
NO 
YEAH BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF O SOMEONE IS STANDING THEN 
YEAH 
NO NO NO 
IN FACT UH THAT'S UH IT'S ANOTHER THING THIS OPTIC 
WELL UH UM WE HAVE 
YOU 
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT REALLY AN EXTENSION TO THE FIRST BOX JUST AN INDU INDUSTRY STANDARD UH UH PROTOCOL BETWEEN THESE TWO UH 
WELL WELL THERE'S A SPECIAL PROTOCOL TO TO DELIVER UH AUDIO SIGNALS AND UH ITS PATH THROUGH UH O UM 
WELL ACTUALLY JUST TO HAVE THE THE ICSLA E UH POSSIBLY IT TO BRANCH ICSLA 
HMM 
NO 
UH-HUH 
WELL UH SO YOU SAY THIS ONE ALREADY WORKS TO UH TO TELL THE THE DIRECTION 
UM WOULD IT ALSO WORK IF YOU PLACED UH THE MICROPHONES AT AT THE BORDER OF THE TABLE 
YOU SEE NOW YOU YOU HAVE TO QUITE CENTRAL 
AND UH WHAT HAPPENS IF IF YOU PUT THEM HERE IN AROUND THE TABLE 
WOULD IT WORK AS WELL 
YOU JUST DIDN'T TRY 
OR 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH IT IS CLEAR THIS 
NO 
MM-HMM 
NO 
YOU LOSE INFORMATION 
UM 
YEAH 
WELL THAT'S SOMETHING WITH F. F. T. IS 
AND THE PHASE 
SO THE MAGNITUDE YOU DON'T REALLY SEE 
OR AND FOR THIS UH 
WELL UH UH UH I DID A SPEECH PROCESSING UH CARS AND I'M NOT SURE IF THEY A UH THEY ALSO UM MM LEARNS THAT THAT 
WE MORE USED THE FACE THAN THE MAGNITUDE 
SO UH I GUESS THE 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
AND WHAT HAPPEN UH OF TWO PERSON ARE TALKING TO THE SAME TIME 
THIS TO JUST GOT TWO SECTORS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN OTHERS NO 
SOUNDS 
WELL UH UH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
NO IT'S MORE THAN 
NO IT'S UH 
MM-HMM 
I'LL SHOW YOU THIS AFTERWARDS 
NOW IF YOU DON'T REALLY DETECT THE PITCH CH CAN SAY THAT UH NO PERSONS 
IT'S NOT REALLY MEANINGFUL 
WELL IF YOU DO THIS 
SOMEHOW 
MM-HMM 
MM THANKS 
WELL 
OTHERWISE IT COULD ALSO JUST RELY ON THE FREQUENCY BAND SEPARATION AND DETECT THAT WAY THE DIFFERENT PERSONS AND THE THEN YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE AROUND THE TABLE THIS 
BUT UH 
WELL D DEPENDS WITH HOW YOU DO IT 
BUT IF IF YOU PLACE THE THE MICROPHONES UH N YEAH 
OH 
THAT WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE WHERE WHERE IS THE THE VOICE LOUD WITH UH ARE THE LOUDEST 
WELL IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT THING AND UH YOU DON'T REALLY GET UH A NAME FOR IT 
BUT UH 
AT THE AND IT IT DEPENDS A BIT WHAT YOU WANT 
IF YOU ARE 
I GUESS IT'S COMPLETELY OTHER APPROACH 
SO UH 
EXPENSIVE 
CA CAN YOU UH SAY A NUMBER 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY UH FOR FOR UH THE NOISE SENSITIVE TABLE PROJECT UM WE DECIDED TO ME TO TAKE THE ONES UH AS INPUT 
AND UH GIVE A FEEDBACK UH WITH LEDS ON THE TABLE 
SO THIS IS UH ONE OF THE THE POSSIBILITIES THAT WERE OFFERED TO USE 
BUT UH WE DECIDED TO DO IT D UH AT THIS WAY 
YES THE THE FIRST UH THE FIRST IDEA OF THE PROJECT UH WAS TO HAVE UM THE WHOLE TABLE COVERED BY LEDS 
BUT UH FOR THE PROTOTYPE OF THIS ISN'T THIS IS NOT THE THE WAY WE IMPLEMENT IT NOW 
BUT UH IN FACT WE HAVE A THERE WAS THE YES 
TH THERE WAS THE THE RESTRICTION THAT IF WE COVER THE L THE TABLE WITH LEDS UH SOME WON'T BE VISIBLE BECAUSE UH YOU HAVE UH YES 
SO UM IF THERE IS INFORMATION DISPLAYED UNDER THE THE SHEETS UH THE IT WON'T BE UM VERY USEFUL 
SO WE DECIDED TO HAVE TO UH YES THIRTY CENTIMETRE UH TO EACH SIDE 
WEEKS 
THIS IS FOR PRAC PRACTICAL REASON AND UH ALSO A MATTER OF TIME 
BECAUSE UH 
YES 
BUT UH TH THERE ARE O OTHER PROBLEMS LIKE UM YES THE THE INFORMATION DISPLAY ON THE SHOTS 
SO WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S 
YES 
TRUE 
AND THERE IS UH A LOT OF PROGRAMMES NOW BUT THIS IMPLEMENTATION 
SO IT'S NOT UH IT'S NOT OBVIOUS 
HMM 
STILL IN PROGRESS 
ALMOST DONE 
MM-HMM 
YES 
MM YES 
YES 
OH 
I HAVE ONE OR OR TWO QUESTION 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TO BEGIN WITH THE THE EXPLANATION ABOUT THE THE ROLES 
O OKAY 
SO UM I HAVE ACTUALLY TWO QUESTIONS THAT ARE UH JUST PRACTICAL QUESTION ABO ABOUT MY M MY IMPLEMENTATION NOW 
UH I 
NO 
SO AND THE FIRST INFORMATION IS UM BUT THE THE NOISE LEVEL 
NO NOT THE NOISE LEVEL THE SOUND LEVEL 
UH BECAUSE UH WHAT YOU GET FROM FROM THE MICROPHONES IS UH A CURVE 
AND UM A WAY THE WAY UH IT IS IMPLEMENTED NEW UH TO DETECT YES 
YOU HAVE A UH I HAVE PACKETS UH FOR UH LET'S SAY UH THIS IS UH THIS IS UH NOT UH FIXED 
BUT UH I HAVE PACKETS FOR ABOUT UM UH ALPHA SECOND 
SO IT'S UH SECOND 
AND UH IN THESE PACKETS I WANT TO KNOW THE THE SOUND LEVEL THE AVERAGE SOUND LEVEL 
SO UH THE WAY I DO IT NOW IS UH TO TO TAKE UH EACH TOP OF THE CURVES' BOTTOMS AND UH JUST MAKING LEVERAGE THIS 
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY UM THE BEST WAY TO DO IT 
BUT I DON'T KNOW UH F 
YES 
OKAY 
SO THIS IS THIS THE THE FIRST QUESTION 
YES 
BUT I THINK UH THIS IS TWO DIFFERENT PROBLEMS 
UH THE FILTERING MUST BE MUST BE DONE BEFORE 
AND AFTER THAT UH IF YOU HAVE UH A CLEANED CURVE AND YOU CAN UH JUST APPLY UH FUNCTIONALLY 
AND UH THE SECOND QUESTION WAS ABOUT UM UH FILTERING AND UH F. F. T. YEAH WHAT YOU CAN GET FROM IT 
OH 
GENERAL QUESTIONS 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
UH O YES I WILL JUST ADD SOMETHING 
UM 
SO THERE A WAY TO UH IT FROM ONE UH FROM ONE STREAM TO UH TO BUILD TWO STREAMS THAT CORRESPOND TO THE THE VOICE OF AN APPLE AND THE VOICE OF THE SECOND 
THE 
YES 
NO 
AND IT AT THIS IS NOT UH 
A SOUND QUESTION 
SOUND RELATED QUESTION 
LINE IN 
OH YES 
THE THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE THE EXTENSION AND SO UH OF THE 
NO NO NO 
OH OKAY 
AND THE FIRE WIRE PORT 
AND THERE IS AN EXTENSION FOR THIS THIS UH THIS DEVICE CONNECTED TO TO UH WITH UH OPTIC FIBRE 
YES 
OH YES 
B BECAUSE FOR NOW UH I'M JUST SAMPLING THE SOUND THAT UH EIGHT THOUSAND 
SO UH JUST UH SOMETHING VERY VERY REL I COULD UH EVEN UH GO TO LOWER 
BUT UH THIS IS JUST TO GET THE THE USE THE ONES THE SOUND LEVEL 
BUT UH IF I WANT TO RECORD THE CONVERSATION WITH UH UH A PROCESSING AFTER THE 
YES IT TO HAVE A BETTER SOUND QUALITY 
UH PERHAPS IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A X. ARRAY YEAH 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YES 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
SURE SURE 
BUT UH WHAT IS THE THE AGAIN 
IN TERMS OF UH POSITION 
UH UH UH CENTIMETRES OR UH MORE 
OKAY 
UM UH WHAT YOU GET SO UH THE REAL POSITION OR UH JUST UH THE ANGLE AT WHICH THE THE SOUND COMES 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YES SURE 
YES 
UH BECAUSE UH THERE THERE IS JUST UM FOR MICROPHONES THAT ARE EIGHT 
OKAY YES 
OKAY BUT THERE ARE IN UH IN A PLAN 
OKAY 
BECAUSE UH TO TO T. P. F. N. THERE IS A LAB THAT IS HE HAS DONE ALMOST THE SAME THING 
BUT THEY HAVE UH EIGHT MICROPHONE THAT ARE UH TO UH YES THE EIGHT UM THE EIGHT UH UH COR CORNER OF UH A CUBE YES 
THE ELEVATION NO 
BUT UH WHAT IS COULD BE RELEVANT IT'S NOT UH ALMOST IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE WITH THE THE UM 
YES THE THE POSITION THE THE RADIUS OF THE 
YES IT COULD BE 
YES OKAY 
YES 
BECAUSE UM BECAUSE I TH UM THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE THE MICROPHONE IS IT UH SO TOO LOW IT 
MM-HMM 
YES SURE 
YES BUT I THINK THE THE MOST RELEVANT PART IS THE UM THE OTHER UH THE HARDWARE THAT SYNCHRONIZE THE MICROPHONES AND THAT 
YES 
YES 
MM NOT MAXIMUM 
THE THE AVERAGE ON THE ON THE PACKETS 
OH YES THE THE I TAKE THE THE B I G WHEN I GO UP TO THE THE CURVE UH I'M UH IN THE AT THE LOCAL MAXIMUM 
I TAKE IT 
THEN THE NEXT UH LOCAL MINIMUM AND UH TAKING THIS UH THIS RANGE DOING AVERAGE ON IT 
YES 
DIFFERENCE 
DIFFERENCE IS UH SO THAT IF I JUST UH 
MM YES 
YES 
OKAY 
A YOU HAVE UH YOU HAVE FIFTEEN IMPLEMENTATIONS 
OH 
YES 
OKAY 
SIXTEEN 
SURE 
OKAY OKAY 
YES AND THEN I JUST UH BECAUSE UH WE ARE USING UM UH AN OPEN AS AN OPEN SOURCE FRAMEWORK TO DO THIS 
THERE IS UH SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW I KNOW IT UH CALLS SPHINX THAT IS DOING UH S SORRY 
YES 
DOING UM VOICE RECOGNITION 
AND UH I JUST USE IT FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE MICROPHONE AND THE ACQUISITION 
SO UH THERE IS UH ALREADY UH ONE F. F. T. UH MODULE IMPLEMENTED IN IT 
I DIDN'T TEST IT 
BUT UM 
YES SURE 
Y YES FOR THE FOR THE THE POSITION 
ALSO FOR DETECTION 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
'KAY YES 
SURE 
OKAY 
YES 
NO 
YES 
OKAY 
YOU YOU HAVE TO DETECT UH AN EVENT IN ONE MICROPHONE AND UH KNOW WHEN IT'S HAPPENED IN UH IN THE OTHER ONE 
NO 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IT'S RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF MICROPHONES AROUND 
NO 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY THIS IS A MEASURE OF THE ACTIVITY O OKAY 
TH THERE THERE IS A DISTANCE 
BUT IT'S NOT VERY UH VERY EFFECTIVE 
SO SO YOU MENTIONED 
IT'S 
AND UH FROM FROM THIS KIND OF OF INFORMATION YOU CAN UH LET'S SAY HAVE UH A FINGER PRINT OF THE USER TO KNOW UH OF THIS IS THE SAME USER SPEAKING 
SO 
NOT SURE 
BECAUSE THE THE UM 
OKAY 
WHICH 
ORANGE 
YES OKAY 
SO 
THIS IS THIS IS A BIT ARBITRARY 
BECAUSE UH PERHAPS UH PERSON TWO WILL HAVE UH SOME FREQUENCIES ON THE RANGE OF 
OKAY 
AND IF YOU RECONSTRUCT THE STREAM FROM THIS UH THIS RANGE YOU WILL UH GET SOMETHING UH THAT IS UH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
AND YOU CAN YOU CAN UM THIS WAY YOU CAN FILTER UH PERHAPS SOME RANGE THAT ARE UH JUST VERY LOW FREQUENCIES FOR UH PERHAPS UH A NOISE OR 
THE YES THE FINE 
OKAY 
YES BUT BUT THEN THIS THIS IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE UH THIS WAY YOU CAN DETECT UH IF SOMEONE IS TALKING 
IF SOMEONE HA HAS AN UH SOME NOISE WITH UH PERHAPS PUTTING HIS UH HIS CAP ON THE ON THE TABLE 
PERHAPS IF THERE IS A LAPTOP AND UH IN IN POSITION 
AND YOU CAN CLASSIF UH CLASSIFY 
AND THIS IS 
YES 
SHE' VERY GOOD 
OKAY 
YES 
YES 
AND THE THE LENGTH OF THE TIME FRAME HAS UM AN INFERENCE OF UH IN UH WHICH PARAMETERS 
OKAY 
THE OTHER I UH LET'S SAY IF YOU USE A ONE SECOND WINDOW 
UH THE IN FACT THE THE FRAME LENGTHS WILL BE UH VERY UH VERY UH I 
YES 
OKAY 
THEY THEY WON'T BE VISIBLE ON THE ON THE WAVEFO OKAY 
YES 
BUT THE THE THE THE LOUNGE UH THE LONGEST FRAME YOU WOULD USE WOULD BE ONE HUNDRED 
IT MUST OKAY 
OKAY YES 
'KAY SO YOU CAN YEAH 
OKAY 
ENTER UH WHEN USER IS 
OH YES 
AND BEFORE I FORG FORGET TO UH I HAVE ONE QUESTION 
UH YOU SAY YOU DO THE PROCESSING AFTER UH AFTERWARDS 
AND UH WHAT IS THE THE COST YES THE THE LENGTH 
NO NO OR UH BIT LONGER 
OKAY 
YES BUT MATLAB IS VERY UH VERY EFFECTIVE FOR UH MATRICES AND UH 
OKAY 
YES 
OKAY 
YES 
RELATIVE YES 
MM 
YES 
AND EVEN IF YOU USE UH FOUR MICROPHONES TO GET UH NOT GOOD 
OKAY 
OKAY 
AND EIGHT IS UH IS GOOD 
THERE I YES 
BUT UH 
YEAH 
YES ONE TWO DEGREE IS VERY VERY SMALL FOR UH FOR OUR APPLICATION 
BECAUSE WE WANT WE REALLY WANT TO DETECT UH OF THE THIS IS THE SAME PERSON THAT IS SPEAKING OR NOT 
IF THERE IS UH AN ERROR OF UH LET'S SAY UH TEN FIFTEEN DEGREES AND BUT UH IT IS UM CAPABLE OF UH USING IT IS TWO DIFFERENT PERSON 
THERE IS NOT PROBLEMS WITH THE 
OKAY AND THE NUMBER OF SECTORS IS UH IS NOT DEPENDENT OF UH THE NUMBER OF MICROPHONES 
OKAY 
IF THERE IS UH TWO TWO PERSON THE SAME SECTOR I SEE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO 
GEOMETRY IS NOT 
WE HAVE NOT UH THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT IT 
YES 
F. F. T. 
BUT THE UH UH I THINK WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE IS THE SYNCHRONIZATION OF THE MICROPHONES 
RIGHT 
OKAY UM UH I'M SPEAKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE UH WE WANTED UH TO DO THIS TABLE IN UH A MID TECH WAY LET'S SAY A CHEAP WAY 
TO HAVE NOT UH VERY EXPENSIVE TABLES 
SO I DON'T KNOW IF UM UH WHAT I'VE SEEN W IN OUR WEBSITE WAS UH THAT TH THIS INSTALLATION WAS UH A BIT EXPENSIVE 
UH BUT I'M TRYING TO UH TO TO TO SEE WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND UH WHAT IS NOT UH FOUR 
YES 
SURE 
YES SH I THINK YOU HAVE TO UH TO UH 
IT SH 
THESE ARE THESE ARE UM SOME KINDS OF UH AND THIS ONE 
YES 
OKAY 
EXPENSIVE 
BECAUSE BECAUSE UH OF THE QUALITY OF THE THE 
AND THEY ARE PLUG IN THE ON THE X. L. R. 
OR UH 
YES 
OKAY FOR THE R WE'LL WE WE'LL UH 
MM-HMM 
LET'S HAVE A BREAK 
OKAY 
SHOULD I START 
MAYBE BY PRESENTING THE PROJECT LITTLE BIT 
OKAY SO HISTORICALLY IT WAS UM UH LAST YEAR PROF DELAMBEAUX IN UH HIS C. S. C. W. CLASSES UH ASKED THE STUDENT TO DESIGN A TABLE 
AND ALL THE STUDENTS AND GUILLAUME WA WAS A STUDENT OF THIS CLASS WAS VERY EXCITED UH TO DESIGN SUCH A TABLE 
SO HE DECIDED TO ME TO MAKE MORE RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC 
SO THE GENERAL TOPIC UH SO BUT UH INTERACTIVE TABLE UM DISAPPEARING COMPUTER UM WHAT IS THE OTHER ONE 
UM UM IN UH IN THE GENERAL FI FIELD OF UH COLLABORATIVE COMPUTER SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING 
SO THE IDEA SO WE HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COLLABORATING UH IN A PEDAGOGICAL PURPOSE 
AND UH WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE PUT A COMPUTER IN FRONT OF THEM UH IT DOESN'T HELP FOCUSING ON COLLABORATION 
SO IF WE MAKE THE COMPUTING UM FUNCTIONALITIES DISAPPEARING ON ON THE ON THE FURNITURE 
IN THE WALL OR THREE THINGS LIKE THAT WE MAY MORE EFFICIENTLY SUPPORT UH COLLABORATION THAN THE THE LEARNING 
SO I ARRIVED UH IN JUNE SOMETHING LIKE THAT A COUPLE OF MONTH AGO 
UH GUILLAUME AND UH MICHAEL UH OR TWO STUDENTS THAT ARE WORKING UH FOR FOUR MONTHS TO THEIR MASTER PROJECT 
AND THEY START WORKING ON TWO UH DIFFERENT UH SUB PROJECTS 
SO GUILLAUME IS WORKING ON THE NOISE SENSITIVE TABLE 
IT'S UH WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING ABOUT UH TODAY 
SO THE IDEA IS UH OKAY WE WE HAVE ON THE LAB A NOTION ABOUT UM ROOT MIRRORING 
THE IDEA SO IF WE CAN PROVIDE A FEEDBACK TO PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER UH IT MAY HELP THEM SELF REGULATING THEIR ACTIVITY THEIR COLLABORATION 
SO COULD BE NORMATIVE OR NOT 
IN OUR OWN CASE WE WANT TO HAVE UH A TABLE THAT WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE BY BY STUDENTS 
UH TO A. P. F. L. WE ARE UH 
IT I. P. F. L. UH THE LEARNING CENTRE WILL BE BUILT IN A COUPLE OF UH YEARS 
SO THE DO WE WE WILL HAVE PLENTY OF ROOMS UH LIKE IN LIBRARIES OR MEETING ROOMS WHERE STUDENT WILL ARRIVE AND WORK 
SO IF WE HAVE THIS TABLE UH THAT IS ACCESI ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS IF THEY ARRIVE IF WE PROVIDE A FEEDBACK OF UM WHO IS TALKING 
UM INSTANTLY THE UH AT ONE MOMENT OR UH THROUGH TIME OR THE TURN TAKING 
UH MAYBE THEY WILL JUST BY USING AN EXPLICIT UH FEEDBACK OF THAT THEY WILL UM TAKE PROFIT UH IF IT AND UM 
YES 
THE IDEA IS TO HAVE UH PERIPHER PERIPHERICAL UH INFORMATION 
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON UH WHAT'S GOING ON UH WHAT IN THE FEEDBACK 
SO WE DON'T WANT HISTOGRAM OR VERY PRECISE INFORMATION 
BUT WE WILL UH HAVE LEDS THAT WILL BE DISTANT 
THERE WILL BE SIX CENTIMETRES BETWEEN EACH LED WITH A BLURRING GLASS 
THE IDEA IS TO HAVE MORE UM A KIND OF UH ART ARTISTIC UH FEEDBACK TO HAVE A KIND OF GENERAL FEELING OF WHAT'S GOING ON 
SOMETHING ABOUT 
UH AUDIENCE 
FOR PRACTICAL REASONS 
WE KEPT UH ONE PAPER SHEET 
SO UH THE FIRST SHAPE OF THE TABLE THE SHAPE OF THE TABLE OBVIOUSLY IS ONE OF THE FACTOR IN THAT WILL CHANGE THE COLLABORATION 
SO UH BUT WE DON'T WANT TO START WITH TOO MANY PARAMETERS 
SO WE START WITH A TABLE THAT IS APPROXIMATIVELY THE TAB UH OF THE TABLE WHERE WE ARE NOW 
AND WE WILL HAVE UH A SQUARE SHAPE LIKE THIS THAT WILL BE HERE AND A SECOND ONE THAT WOULD BE THERE 
SO WE WILL HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
LIKE THIS 
THAT WILL BE THE OUR FIRST UH REAL PROTOTYPE 
OKAY 
AND THE USE THIS L. E. D. MODULES ARE BEING UH DESIGNED UH NOW 
WE SHOULD HAVE THEM IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
AND UH WE WILL BE ABLE TO UH START UH EVALUATING UH THE PROTOTYPES 
UH UH ABOUT THE C. S. C. W. CLASS THAT WILL START AT THE END AT THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER 
UH IS THE STUDENT WILL BE ASKED TO DESIGN UH A TABLE 
SO TO FIND THE SHAPE UH OF THE TABLE TO GET UH WHA THE AND PUT THAT UH IN THE UM ON TABLE UH LEGS 
AND WE WILL UH SO AT THE BEGINNING WE WANTED TO PUT THIS L. E. D. MODULES UH IN THE TABLES 
BUT WE WON'T MAKE IT BECAUSE UH FOR SOLIDITY REASON OF THE TABLE 
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT VERY UH STRONG UH WOOD 
UM SO WE WILL RATHER BEAM UH THE L. E. D. ON THE TABLE 
SO WE COME BACK TO A MORE RICHER DISPLAY 
BU BUT WE WILL UM RESTRICT IT IT A SMALL UH TO HAVE THE SAME DISPLAY 
LED LIGHTS UH THAT WILL BE DISTANT UH SIX CENTIMETRES BETWEEN LEDS 
SO WE WILL SIMULATE OUR 
AND WE HAVE YEAH 
AND WE HAVE THE FEELING THAT TO HAVE THE INFORMATION EMBEDDED IN THE TABLE MAKE IT PART OF THE TABLE 
IT I DON'T KNOW WE'LL WE WE WILL TRY UH WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HE WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS PROTOTYPE 
WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT 
OKAY UH MAYBE BEFORE UH GOING ON ON THIS SUBJECT WE CAN TALK TALK A LITTLE BIT ON UH 
HUH 
SO BASED ON THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE P. F. L. STUDENT HAVE THEIR OWN LAPTOP UH THE IDEA IS THE SIMILAR IDEA UH IS IT OKAY 
PEOPLE ARE COMING IN A SHOULD BE ABLE TO VERY EASILY UH S SOME UM RESOURCES OFFERED TO THEM 
SO SO THE IDEA IS TO HELP THEM SOCIALISING ORGANISING THEIR OWN WORK 
AND UH NOT IN A CLASSROOM SETTING BUT IN A SOCIAL PLACE WHERE THEY COULD GATHER 
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
OKAY 
SO UH MAYBE WE CAN FOCUS A LITTLE UH UH BIT MORE ON THE WHAT WE HAVE DONE BUT UH THE NOISE SENSITIVE TABLE 
TELL YOU ABOUT UH WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN IN THE SO WE START SO GUILLAUME STARTED BY UH DEVELOPING THE APPLICATION THAT GET THE AUDIO INPUT 
SO WE WANT TO TO HAVE A MODULAR ARCHITECTURE TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE EACH UH LAYER SEPARATELY 
SO THE AUDIO INPUT UH IS QUITE BASIC ONE 
WE U WE USE UH SOUND CARDS TO TO GET UH THE SIGNALS AND TO DETECT IT UH ON IT UH AND WE HAVE A THRESHOLD TO DETECT UH WHEN SOMEONE IS TALKING 
AT LEAST WHEN THE NOISE IS UH TO UH S BIGGER THAT UH SPECIFIC LEVELS 
AND THEN WE GET THIS INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE TALKING NOT TALKING AND TO SAY OKAY UH 
THIS ONE IS TALKING FOR X. TIME OR UH HAS BEEN TALKING UH X. PERCENT OF THE FIVE LAST MINUTES 
OR TWO PEOPLE ARE TALKING TOGETHER 
SO THIS IS MORE SEMANTIC UH LAYER 
UH WE CALL THAT INTERACTION UH MODELS 
AND UH UH SO WHEN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS ARE TRIGGER ARE DETECTED WE TRIGGER ON THE INTERACTION EVENT 
IS VERY SIMPLE ONE COULD BE ONE PERSON IS TALKING 
SO IT'S UH THE EASY ON 
IT'S STILL IN PROGRESS 
STILL IN PROGRESS 
SO THE LAST LAYER IS ABOUT THIS VISUALISATION 
WE WE WILL UH WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE VISUAL GRAMMAR MEANING THAT WHEN WE HAVE NO INTERACTION EVENT THAT IS UH FIRED 
WE UH WILL ASSOCIATE UH A WAY OF VISUALI VISUALISING IT 
SO FOR INSTANCE IF SOMEONE IS TALKING UH WE CAN JUST HAVE A LIGHT THAT WILL CENTRE ON THE POINT THAT IS UH CLOSE TO HIM 
THAT COULD BE IN UH INSTANT UH FEEDBACK 
AND IF HE HAS BEEN TALKING MAYBE SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE LAST FIVE MINUTES SO UM 
UH UH IT IT MAY BE REFLECTED AS THE UM INTENSITY OR SIZE OF A AS A CYCLE 
CENTRE ON THE SAME POINT 
AND THEN IF THERE'S TURN TAKING WE CAN SHOW WAVES OF LIGHT GOING FROM UH UM IT YOU UH OR FROM OTHER PEOPLE 
ARE USING THE CENTRE PART OF THE TABLE TO SHOW SOME SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THE UM UH MORE GENERAL UH DYNAMIC 
OR LAUGHING 
YES 
NO UH WE CAN CHANGE INTE SO WE HAVE UH EIGHT BY EIGHT UH TWO TIMES LEDS 
EACH UH LED IS ACTUALLY THREE LEDS UM 
THE UH M. G. B. LED 
AND WE CAN CHANGE THE INTENSITY 
SO IT'S ALREADY QUITE A RICH UH FEEDBACK 
YES 
AND JUST A LAST THING 
SO THIS TABLE IS UH TWO DIFFERENT THINGS 
IT'S UH AN OBJECT THAT WILL UH G PROVIDE A FEEDBACK TO THE TERMINAL USERS PEOPLE COLLABORATING AROUND UH THE TABLE 
BUT IT ALSO A TOOL FOR US AS A RESEARCHER TO TEST UH BOTH THE INTERACTION EVENT WE WANT TO DETECT NEED TO TEST THE VISUALISATION 
SO UM WE WILL BE ABLE TO EDIT SOME UH INTERACTION RULES AND THE VISUALISATION UH GRAMMAR 
AND UH WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROCESS TO POST PROCESS SOME CONVERSATION JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND IT UH HAVE THIS UM MODELS ON FEEDBACK WORKING WHEN PEOPLE ARE USING THE TABLE 
SO I THINK IT WAS 
YES 
UM 
MAYBE WE COULD SUMMARISE THE QUESTION WE WERE THINKING ABOUT 
SO BASICALLY WHAT WE WANT WE WANT TO KNOW WHEN A. IS TALKING B. IS TALKING AND UH 
BASIC INFORMATION WE NEED 
MAYBE WE CAN UH GO THROUGH THE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND THEN YOU CAN ORGANISE YOUR OWN 
UM I WOULD JUST ADD SOMETHING 
UH WE ARE NOT INTERESTED SO MUCH IN SOUND LEVEL BUT UH IN THE LEVEL OF UH THE SOUND THAT CORRESPONDS TO VOICE 
MM MM 
OKAY IT WAS JUST A 
OKAY 
GO ON 
AND I WOULD ADD UH ONE MORE 
IT'S ABOUT UM BECAUSE WHAT WE CAN UH RECORD SO UH SOUND UH ORIGINS 
SO IN P UH IS NO SONIC POINTS 
BUT WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN SO PEOPLE 
SO THE QUESTION IS IF SOMEONE IS MOVING I'M TALKING HERE I STOP TALKING I'M GOING HERE I'M TALKING 
HOW TO DETECT THAT IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE 
IF WE WANT TO UH INTEGRATE INFORMATION TO SAY THESE PEOPLE HAS UH SPOKEN SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE TIME IN THE FIVE LAST MINUTES 
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO UH TO KNOW THAT IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE 
SO RIGHT NOW OUR PRACTICAL SOLUTION IS TO HAVE AN UH MICROPHONE CLOSE TO UM EVERY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO SET 
SO WE CAN INFER THAT OF A SOUND IS COMING IN THIS OR IT'S THE SAME 
IS KIND OF TRICK 
BUT FOR THE BEGINNING IT'S ENOUGH 
AND A LAST QUESTION THAT IS RELATED TO UH OUR LAST IF I NOT FIND ANOTHER ONE UM 
BUT PEOPLE IF SOMEONE IS LEAVING OR IF SOMEONE UH MAYBE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING EV UH QUITE COMPLEX EVEN FOR YOU 
IF SOMEONE IS STAYING HERE BUT IS QUITE OR LEAVING HOW CAN WE DETECT THAT SOMEONE IS HERE BUT QUIET 
OKAY 
I KNOW 
BUT HOW TO INTEGRATE THE INFORMATION 
OH 
NOT NOT YET 
MAYBE LATER ON 
BUT 
UH THE WAIT AND THE SET 
ARE PUTTING HIS BAG ON THE OKAY 
BUT IT WAS JUST IT IT'S A QUESTION 
I'M NOT SURE WE WILL TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT TODAY 
UH NOT DIRECTLY 
BUT IT'S UH RELATED 
SO IN A COUPLE OF DAYS WE WILL GET THIS UM UH THE FIRE WIRE UH BOX 
SO WE WILL WE HAVE CHOSEN ONE THAT HAS EIGHT UH LINE UP 
SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE LINE IN SORRY 
SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO PLUG UH UP TO EIGHT UH MICROPHONES WITH UH JACK PLUGS TO EXHALE AIR WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING WITH EIGHT MORE X. L. R. UH MICROPHONE WITH ANOTHER BOX 
SO WE UH WE HAVE THE COMPUTER WE HAVE THE THE MAIN BOX WITH THE EIGHT LINE INS 
AND IT'S FIRE WIRE 
IT IS OPTIC 
TO HAVE EIGHT MORE X. L. R. IF WE NEED TO 
BUT WE ARE NOT SURE IT TO BUY IT NOW 
BUT WE CAN EXTEND IT 
THAT'S UH 
YES 
WELL 
WE ARE NOT SURE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF MICROPHONE WE SHOULD USE 
SO WE WANTED TO UH THAT'S A FIRST THING 
SO WE WANTED TO HAVE OPEN POSSIBILITIES 
AND SECONDLY MAYBE WE WILL USE THIS BOX YOU KNOW TO GET UH DATA 
I DON'T KNOW IF ONE ANOTHER EXPERIMENT MAYBE IN ANOTHER PROJECT IF WE WANT TO HAVE COMMENTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE OR O ELSEWHERE 
UH GETTING UH HAVING THE POSSIBILITY OF USING X. L. R. MICROPHONE COULD BE UH UH COULD BE NOT 
SO EVERYTHING IS OPEN 
NO WE ARE NOT VERY INTERESTED IN 
MORE THAN ONE 
MM MM MM MM 
OKAY 
THEY WON'T HAVE NICE LIGHT UH LIGHTING IN IN FRONT OF THEM 
THEY WOULD MAYBE CAREFUL 
BUT 
OKAY 
SO MAYBE WE UH YOU COULD PRESENT A DIFFERENT WORK UH YOU HAVE DONE 
AND UH I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY ARE 
SO YOU TOLD USE IT WAS DIFFERENT PIECES MORE THAN ONE INTEGRATED DEVICE 
UH UH 
WHAT WOULD BE THE D DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DETECTING THE AVERAGE OR DETECTING THE MAXIMUM 
WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE 
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
IT'S A KIND OF FILTERING ALREADY 
SIXTY 
OKAY 
AGAIN 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
SO IT'S THIRTY TWO MILLISECOND FRAMES TAKEN EACH 
NO IDEA 
SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO WHY ARE YOU OVERLAPPING 
I HAVE A ROUGH IDEA 
BUT UH WHAT IS THE MAIN INTEREST 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AND IT'S KIND OF CRAPPY 
PRECISE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM MM MM 
SO YOU USE THE FIRST AND LAST POINT TO DETECT WHAT IS BETWEEN 
MM-HMM 
MM MM 
OKAY 
SO YOU ARE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
CORRESPONDING TO BREATH OR A LITTLE NOISE 
'KAY 
BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MICROPHONE ARRAY HERE 
STRONG BACKGROUND NOISE 
SO PHASE 
UH-HUH 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
SO THE PHASE THE TIME BETWEEN UH AUDIO SIGNALS FOR ME FOR THIS MICROPHONE ON THIS MICROPH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND DO YOU GET SOMETHING ABOUT THE UM DISTANCE OF THE GUY THAT IS TALKING OR JUST A DIRECTION 
OKAY 
MM MM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YOU MEAN THAT EACH PERSON WILL HAVE A SPECIFIC FREQUENCY BECAUSE I THE WAY HE'S TALKING OR HIS LOCALIZATION 
IT'S A KIND OF UH SPEAKING STYLES 
BOTH 
I DON'T REALLY GET YOUR LAST UH DIAGRAM YES 
SO IT'S IT IN GIVEN MOMENT STILL 
OKAY SO YOU CAN SAY THAT IF THIS FREQUENCY BELONGS MORE AT THIS PERSON AND THIS ONE MORE AT THIS ONE 
BUT SOME FREQUENCY MAY MAYBE OR NOT USED NEITHER BY UH GUY THE GUY ONE OR THE GUY TWO 
OKAY 
MAYBE THEY ARE USING THE SAME FREQUENCY 
SO YOU NEED TO USE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
AND CAN YOU DETECT IF SOMEONE IS LAUGHING OR ANGRY D UH THERE IS KIND OF SIGNATURE UH EVEN IF WE CAN'T REALLY TRUST IT UH UH IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME 
OH 
AND DO PROCESSING ON IT 
OKAY 
PITCH 
IT IS PITCH 
LI OKAY 
WHAT IS A 
EXCUSE ME 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO WHERE ARE YOU REPRESENT THE PHASE 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM MM MM 
BECAUSE IF WE ARE DISTRIBUTING THE MICROPHONE ALL AROUND THE TABLE THEN WE COME BACK TO THE ENERGY SOLUTION 
SO IT WHAT YOU SAY 
WITH THE ENERGY DISSOLUTION OR WITH UH F. F. T. IT 
OKAY 
BUT THERE ARE MANY MANY THINGS 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 
MM-HMM 
MM MM YEAH 
WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE 
YOU WILL NOT COMPARE EACH MIC WITH UH ALL THE OTHER ONE 
BUT JUST COMPARING THIS ONE WITH THE 
MM OKAY 
OKAY 
BUT WHAT ARE UH UH 
SO WHAT ARE THESE MICE FOR INSTANCE THE ELECTRET MIC 
OMNI DIRECTIONAL 
ELECTRET 
OKAY 
YES 
AND WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT COMPARING ENERGY IN THE CASE WHERE A MICROPHONE WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED ALL AROUND THE TABLE UH YOU'RE COMPARING ENERGY AND THE TIME DELAY 
BECAUSE TIME DELAY IS IS TOO SHORT TO BE COMPARED OR CAN BE NEGLECTED 
OKAY 
OKAY OKAY 
YEAH 
IT'S TIME 
COOL 
SO BE MAYBE I'LL GO BACK TO YOUR QUESTIONS 
UM 
YEAH 
UM 
YEAH 
AND THIS ALSO UM ALLOWS YOU TO SEPARATE PEOPLE 
UM AND THE QUESTIONS I DID NOT TALK ABOUT WAS UH GOING FROM LOCATION TO UH IDENTITY OF THE PERSON 
UM 
THAT IS QUITE DIFFERENT YOU YOU NEED TO USE A SIGNAL YOU HAVE SEPARATED AND UH DO THE TYPE OF ANALYSIS I MENTIONED 
UM FROM THE SPECTRUM YOU CAN TRANSFORM THE THE MAGNITUDE SPECTRUM AND UM UM BUILD MODEL OF THE PERSON 
UM 
YEAH PITCH AT LEAST 
BUT PITCH IS 
PITCH ISN'T IS NOT ENOUGH SOMETIMES 
I IT'S A FREQUENCY YEAH YEAH 
IT'S A FREQUENCY OF YOUR VIBRATION HERE 
OH 
YEAH 
AND THEN IT'S TRANSFORMED THROUGH THE MOUTH THAT'S THE USUAL MODEL 
YEAH 
I YEAH UM IT'S NOT NECESSARILY DONE EXPLICITLY BUT IT'S EQUIVALENT TO THAT YEAH 
SO AGAIN F. F. T. IS USEFUL TO DO THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS 
UM 
YEAH BUT IT'S QUITE PERSONAL 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
IT IT'S AN INFORMATION EQUIVALENT TO THAT 
IT'S MAYBE ONE YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THE WHOLE UH COMPLICATED MODELLING BUT 
NO NO 
YEAH RATE OF SPEECH IS ALSO POSSIBILITY 
UM HOW FAST YOU SPEAK THAT'S QUITE PERSONAL ALSO 
BUT IT VARIES OVER TIME UM DEPENDING ON EMOTION 
THAT ALSO MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR YOU DETECTING EMOTION 
YEAH YEAH 
AND SO YEAH YEAH SO THESE MEASURES ARE A WAY TO QUANTIFY THAT 
UH UP ON 
NO NO IT'S NOT 
WHAT WE W WHAT IS UM WHAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE IS IT UM TAKE THE DECISION FINALLY 
SO YOUR DECISION CAN BE FOR EXAMPLE UH WHO IS IT OR OF THE PERSON MOVED 
WHICH IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMPLICATED THING LIKE THE PERSON GOES AWAY THEN COMES BACK TEN MINUTES LATER SITS AT A DIFFERENT PLACE 
UH YOU WILL NEED TO BUILD STATISTICAL MODELS OF UM THE PERSON IDENTITY USING THESE MEASURES 
SO THE ONES UM HE MENTIONED UM 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO UM 
NO 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
ALL I WAS SAYING IS THAT THESE DIFFERENT MEASURES ARE A WAY TO UH EVALUATE THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON 
SO IF WITH LOCATION ALL YOU CAN DO IS EXTRACT SEGMENTS OF SPEECH FOR EXAMPLE BUT IT WILL NOT TELL YOU THAT THESE ARE THE SAME PERSON 
IT'S JUST A LOCATION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SO THAT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR EXAMPLE FOR TEN MINUTES BUT THEN THE PERSON MIGHT MOVE OR A DIFFERENT PERSON MIGHT COME 
YEAH 
IT IS 
WELL UNLESS SOMETIMES SOMEBODY GOES THERE ARE YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO IT HMM 
BUT THAT YOU CAN DO WITH LOCATION IF IT'S ONLY IN THE SHORT TERM 
NO NO THE OFF LINE YEAH 
I WOULD SAY YOU MIGHT USE THESE MEASURES IN A SIMPLE WAY OF YOU DO IT UH ON LINE 
LIKE UM TO GIVE FEEDBACK 
BUT UH Y YOU MENTIONED THAT ANOTHER SIDE OF YOUR PROJECT IS ALSO TO ANALYSE OFF LINE 
SO THERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE A 
WE HAD A STUDENT HERE HE FINISHED UH ONE OR TWO YEARS AGO BUT UH LEFT HIS SOFTWARE 
AND HIS SOFTWARE IS PRECISELY TO DO THAT IT UM CLUSTER IT UH ANOTHER LEVEL 
IT CLUSTER THESE SMALL CLUSTERS OF SPEECH UH GROUP THEM BY PERSON AUTOMATICALLY 
YOU ON FROM THE THESE MEASURES PITCH ETCETERA 
SO UM 
YEAH EXACTLY 
SO I WOULD SAY FROM LOCATION AT THE LOWER LEVEL YOU CAN GET SMALL PARTS OF SPEECH AND THEN AT THE NEXT LEVEL 
POSSIBLY OFF LINE YOU CAN UH GROUP THEM INTO UM A SPEECH SEGMENT 
I'M HOPING TO HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO TRY UM DOING THAT BEFORE I FINISH MY THESIS 
UM SO IF I MANAGE TO DO SOME UM UH PRACTICALLY USABLE SOFTWARE I'LL TELL YOU 
UH IN FIVE SIX MONTHS ABOU APPROXIMATELY 
MORE BUSY I WOULD SAY 
YEAH 
SO YOU SAID YOU WANT TO DO SEPARATION UM BUT EX EXACTLY YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UH YOU WANT TO DO VOICE RECOGNITION 
YOU MIGHT WANT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SO YEAH ONCE YOU HAVE LOCATIONS IT'S NOT A BIG PROBLEM 
UM 
MM-HMM 
NO NO YOU SHOULD SEPARATE THEM FIRST YEAH YEAH 
SO 
SO THE TYPE OF THINGS I PRESENTED CAN LOAD IT SEPARATION 
UM IT'S ONLY A VERY SMALL STEP TO ADD 
YEAH YEAH 
ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE IF YOU WANT TO UM EX EXTRACT THESE FEATURES LIKE PITCH AND UH RATE OF SPEECH OR ENERGY SIMPLY FROM EACH PERSON 
UM YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOME BA BASIC SEPARATION 
'CAUSE QUITE OFTEN PEOPLE UH DON'T REALISE THAT THEY TALK TO THE SAME TIME UM INTERRUPT EACH OTHER 
SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RECOGNISE A SPEECH FULLY AT LEAST UM YOU NEED YEAH 
IT'S OKAY 
YOU CAN EMAIL LATER 
YEAH 
UM 
SO 
YEAH 
OH 
OKAY 
A SEMANTIC CONTEXT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THEN MM 
HMM 
SO IT'S UH 
YEAH YOU COULD DETECT ONE WORD YEAH 
KEYWORD SPOTTING YEAH 
SO UM 
YEAH 
YEAH I I'LL JUST SAY UH IF YOU WANT I CAN POINT TO UM THREE PAPERS 
UM BUT NO I THINK IT'S BETTER IF I JUST SEND YOU THE LINK IT'S PROBABLY SIMPLER 
OH NO UM SO BUT THIS UM SECTOR BASED STUFF LIKE UH THE LOCALISATION AND DETECTION 
ONE IS ABOUT HOW TO TAKE THE DECISION THAT SOMEBODY'S ACTIVE OR NOT 
UM IT SOUNDS SIMPLE AT FIRST YOU THINK YOU JUST PUT THE THRESHOLD AND THAT'S IT BUT UM THE PROBLEM IS UH THE 
IT IN YOU CAN DO THAT 
THERE'S NO PROBLEM BUT I IF YOU WANT YOUR YOUR SYSTEM TO WORK IN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS LIKE CAFETERIA LIBRARY 
UM THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE QUITE DIFFERENT AS A SINGLE FIXED THRESHOLD VALUE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM 
SO 
YEAH 
SO YOU CAN DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY THIS KIND OF THINGS 
UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE DOING THAT ALREADY BUT UH 
OKAY 
SO UH I HAVE ANOTHER PAPER WHICH MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR THAT FOR A SINGLE CHANNEL UH CELEBRATION 
AND I'VE CODE ON LINE IS FOR THIS PARTICULAR ONE 
AND THE LAST ONE I WOULD SAY SO UM THE CLUSTERING UM TO UM YEAH 
THE CLUSTERING OF THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS OVER TIME IS THAT YOU CAN GET SMALL CLUSTERS OF SPEECH 
UM THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO IT BUT UH I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IN SPONTANEOUS SPEECH ALL THOSE WORDS ARE QUITE SMALL 
SO YOU NEED TO DO THAT UH ADEQUATELY YEAH 
BUT OTHERWISE YEAH I'M DONE 
HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
MANY SMALL EVENTS BASICALLY YEAH 
YEAH BASICALLY UH I MEAN IT DEPENDS UH 
YEAH EVEN IF SOMEBODY SAYS JUST YES 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU ARE NOT 
IT MIGHT BE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
Y YEAH 
YES 
UM 
SO I I'LL SEND YOU LINKS SOME OF THE PAPERS ARE LONG BUT YOU CAN JUST UM BRIEFLY LOOK YEAH 
UM WE CAN GO AND SEE OLIVIER UNLESS YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE 
HUH 
WELL WE CAN TRY 
BUT UH 
WE HAVE YEAH WE HAVE I. C. R. BUT MAYBE NOT IN THIS COMPUTER 
YEAH 
THAT IS GOOD IDEA YEAH 
IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
ONCE I I UM CODED THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART IN C. JUST TO USE AS YOU CAN HAVE A MAX OF BOTH 
FROM MATLAB YOU CALL C. AND BACK 
BUT THE DAY YOU WANT TO DO UH ON LINE REAL TIME STUFF NAH I WOULDN'T WOULDN'T TRUST IT 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
ARE ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE PITCH NO 
DON'T ASK ME HOW IT'S DONE I I KNOW THE THEORY IS YEAH 
ISN'T IT THE PITCH AND THE FREQUENCY 
THE BASE FREQUENCY OF THE 
AND IF YOU HAVE BOTH YOU CAN UM WELL YOU CAN COMPARE THOSE AT AT ONE STORED AND SO GET TO UH WHICH PERSON TO USE 
PARDON 
AND UH WELL THE THINGS THAT MAKE THE USE THE VOICE 
YEAH 
AND AND THE THE HOLES IN YOUR HEAD EVERYTHING THE THE ONES AND SO NO 
AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY UH UNIQUE FOR EV WELL ALMOST UNIQUE FOR EVERY PERSON IS 
WELL ONCE YOU GET THIS INFORMATION YOUR FREQUENCY AND UH YOUR VOCAL CONTRACT OR HOW IT'S CALLED 
UH Y YOU CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO COMPARE IT TO TO THE FRAMES HERE 
NO BUT 
NO NO NO NO 
THAT THAT THAT EVERYTHING IS DONE THROUGH THROUGH THE VOICE HERE YOU TAKE A VOICE IF SOMEONE AND THEN YOU CAN GET TO THIS INFORMATION 
IT'S IT'S NOT UP IT'S CLEAR IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT SO IT'S ENOUGH TO TO TO USE IT FOR FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES AND UH 
UM NOT NOT THAT WILL UH AS FAR AS I KNOW 
ACTUAL 
SO IT CALLED P. C. M. 
I TH UM WELL IT'S IT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGY IS YEAH 
IT'S MORE OR LESS USED THIS TO COMPRESS AUDIO 
I HAVE TO I WANT TO CHECK IT I CAN SHOW IT YOU AFTERWARDS 
WELL I DID A CARES ABOUT IT BUT UH I SHOULDN'T SAY IT TO LOAD BECAUSE UM THE PROFESSOR IS WORKING HERE AT IDIAP 
I SHOULD REREAD WHAT I SIGNED THERE IS 
WELL UH TO I'M EVEN NOT SURE IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHICH PERSON IS TALKING BECAUSE UH OF UH IF IT I THINK ABOUT A TABLE 
OR IS SOMETHING UH PHYSICAL 
UH YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW IN IN WHICH CORNER OF THE TABLE UH SPEECH IS COMING AND NOT UH WHICH PERSON PRODUCED THE SPEECH IS 
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT REALLY RELATED TO THE UH YEAH I SEE IT'S UH YOU NEED A BIT BOTH UH 
SOUND 
YOU MIGHT MIGHT WANT TO DO 
YOU NEED TO SEPARATE IT 
NO BUT I THINK ONCE YOU HAVE THE VOICE FOR A PERSON 
YOU CAN START TO DO THIS AND UH ONCE UH PEOPLE HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION OR UH FAIR ENOUGH TO IT 
MM UH 
I THINK SO 
THE LINK 
MM 
OKAY 
NO I THINK DOES THIS WORK EMAIL 
DOES IT WORK IF I PUT IN MY EMAIL AND UH 
NO IF IT'S NOT UH I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO INSTALL IT AND SO NO 
OH NO NO NO YOU USE UH I THOUGHT YOU CAN PUT IN HERE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS AND AND JUST UH DO THIS AND THEN IT MAILS ME 
YEAH YOU SEE I WANT TOO MUCH 
AND AFTER ALL MATLAB IS ALSO PROGRAMMING SO IT 
MM-HMM 
SO 
THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION 
MM-HMM 
ACTUALLY UH YOU CAN T PERHAPS JUST UH JUST 
TH THERE IS ONE FREQUENCY THAT IS THE BASE FROM FOR UH 
OKAY 
BOTH 
MM THE PITCH AND UH AND THE FREQUE 
OKAY SO AND YOU CAN MEASURE MEASURE THAT 
OR 
OKAY 
AND I SEE IT UH EXPENSIVE TO DO 
BUT IN FACT IF YOU YOU SPEAK OF UH A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT EXPENSIVE TO THE AND YOU HAVE UH SOMETHING THAT IS 
HMM 
SO YOU HAVE TO DO F. F. T. BECAUSE OTHERWISE 
MM-HMM 
YES 
YES BUT IT 
I IT IT IS UM 
IT I IT YES IT IS IMPORTANT FOR DETECTING PATTERNS 
BECAUSE UH IF YOU SAY UH LET'S SAY UH W HOW MUCH THE PERSON UM HAVE SPOKEN OVER THE THE FIVE LAST MINUTES UH 
UH IF SOMEONE COME AND YES 
YES YES 
YOU 
THIS IS UH MM 
OKAY 
SO I UH THIS IS ONLY BASED ON UH YOU GIVE UH THE SPECTRUM AND UH UH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YES 
BUT UH THE LAST ONES ARE ALWAYS THE 
MM NOT REALLY 
MM YES 
HMM UH I I SAID UH WE WANT TO TO KNOW TO ME TO DO SEPARATION JUST BECAUSE OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
I MM THIS IS NOT THE YES 
YES NO BUT BUT IN FACT WE HAVE UH YES WE ARE DESIGNING UH A NOISE SENSITIVE TABLE JUST F FROM YOUR RING 
BUT WE ARE ALSO DESIGNING UH A PROTOTYPE UM TO ANALYSE THE CONVERSATIONS 
SO UH WE MIGHT ADD THERE A LOT OF UH FEATURES 
OKAY 
AND UH I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS UH PERHAPS IF YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE SPEAKING UH SPEAKING UH AT THE SAME TIME 
UH I DON'T KNOW IF UH VOICE RECOGNITION OF AN UH SUCH A STREAM IS UH REAL 
OKAY 
YES SO THAT'S FINE 
MM-HMM 
SURE 
YES IT'S NOT UM VERY IMPORTANT FEATURE FOR NOW BUT 
MM-HMM 
YES 
AND UH UH ANOTHER WHAT UH 
UM I DON'T REMEMBER 
YES ALSO UH TO TO EXTRACT THE CONTEXT 
MM BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW THE WORDS THAT ARE SPOKEN YOU CAN LET'S SAY UH SOMEONE SAY UH HE'S ANGRY UH ABOUT THE WORD HE'S SEEN 
YES 
YOU UM YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD UH THIS KIND OF THIS IS NOT IN UH MY PROJECT BUT 
YES 
UM 
YES 
AND HAVE A SPECIAL EVENTS TRIGGER IF 
SURE 
SURE 
NO IT'S IT DOESN'T SOUND SIMPLE BUT YES YOU CAN YES 
SURE 
YES IN FACT UH FOR NOW WE ARE USING UH A KIND OF CALIBRATION BUT UH IT'S STILL UM 
YES 
YES UM UH BUT IN FACT YOU HAVE TO SIT IN FRONT OF THE MICROPHONE AND IT'S UH YEAH 
PEOPLE IN SPEAK AND PEOPLE TWO AND PEOPLE THERE AND YOU ARE JUST UH SUBTRACTING THE THE LEVEL THAT YOU YOU KEPT IN THE OTHER MICROPHONES 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY JUST UH A LAST QUESTION UM WHEN YOU MENTIONED IT 
UM IF I'M SPEAKING VERY UH HOW DO YOU SAY IT UM YES I'M JUST SPEAKING ONE WORD EVERY UH EVERY ONE SECOND 
YES A 
UH IS THE THE EVENT THAT IS DETECTED AS UM WILL BE UH A SOME OF UH SMALL PARTS 
THERE WON'T BE UH OKAY 
SO Y YES YOU HAVE TO TO REPROCESS TO UH TO SAY LET'S SAY YES 
THERE IS A VERY SMALL UM INTERVAL 
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER IT UH 
BECAUSE THIS IS YES THIS IS IN THIS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN INTERV INTERVENTION 
IT MIGHT BE 
THIS IS NOT A VERY UH EASY PROBLEM 
I'M DONE 
SURE YES 
AND YOU CAN CODE JAVA 
YOU CAN CHOOSE MATLAB 
YES SURE 
YOU HAVE TO CODE TO UH DIRECTLY AT THE MACHINE 
HMM 
MY SHEET IS VERY UH FILLED UP 
I WILL TAKE YOURS 
OKAY 
YES 
SO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TWO FIRST QUESTION 
OKAY 
AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME PEOPLE MOVING WITH THE CLUSTERING 
UH-HUH 
SO THIS ONE 
WHAT 
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T REALLY GET THE POINT OF COMPARING THE PITCH THE PITCH IS THE USE THE FREQUENCY THAT IS OKAY 
AND THE WAY YOU TRANSFORM IT UH V BY THE MATH 
YOU WERE COMPARING WHAT WITH WHAT 
UH-HUH OKAY OKAY 
SO UH 
AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT COMPARING WHAT WITH WHAT 
OKAY 
BUT YOU WANT TO HAVE THE INFORMATION BECAUSE THE THE MOUTH YOU MOVE IT 
TO SCAN T ALL THE USER 
OKAY 
OKAY SO YOU HAVE THE P THE PITCH AND YOU HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE VOICE DYNAMIC OR 
MM MM MM 
EMOTION THE INVOLVEMENT IN A DISCUSSION 
IF YOU ARE SAYING OH YEAH YEAH WE SHOULD 
OKAY 
NO C. P. U. YOU MEAN 
NOT REALLY FAMILIAR 
HMM 
OKAY SO YOU ARE THE EXPERT 
CAREFUL YOU ARE RECORDED 
OKAY 
OKAY SO ALL THIS STUFF IS DONE FROM THE F. F. T. 
ALSO LOCATION TO IDENTITY 
OH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
BUT TO GET A CLUSTER THE LOCATION THAT IS UH A PLACE WHERE UH NOISE IS REGULARLY COMING FROM 
MM-HMM 
MM MM MM 
BUT FOR INSTANCE FOR A SETTING LIKE UH HERE IT WOULD BE ENOUGH BECAUSE WE ARE NOT MOVING 
OKAY RIGHT 
BUT WE ARE UH TARGETING A PLACE WHERE WE DON'T KNOW I WHERE IT WILL BE MORE FLEXIBLE 
SO WE NEED MORE THAN JUST UH LOCATION IF WE WANT TO UH 
MM MM 
I AGREE 
MAYBE JUST 
I THINK IT MAY IT MAY BE OKAY BUT IT DEPENDS HOW LONG 
HMM 
FROM THE FROM THE LOCATION 
OH 
MM-HMM 
WHEN ARE YOU PLANNING TO FINISH YOUR 
OKAY 
MORE EXTENSIBLE 
MM 
I DON'T KNOW HOW M MAYBE WE WOULD BE MORE INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THE SAME PEOPLE MORE THAN KNOWING THAT IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE 
OR TO DETECT THAT SOMEONE IS MORE THAT WAS NOT TALKING BEFORE IS TALKING NOW 
YES 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
THAT ARE FURTHER DIRECTIONS 
PROFESSOR WAS INTERESTED TO KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT HIM 
UH SOMEONE IS TALKING ABOUT UM LET'S LISTEN 
AND LIGHTING A ONE HAS OFFICE 
OKAY SO ARE YOU DONE W WITH WHAT YOU WANTED TO PRESENTED US UH IN REGARDS WITH THESE QUESTIONS 
MM MM 
THREE PAPERS ABOUT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
IT'S NO NO PROBLEM 
NO MORE TIME FOR PROBLEMS 
OKAY 
UH UH 
MM MM MM 
SLOWLY 
MIGHT 
FOR THE FIRST APPLICATION WE WILL DO WITH UH PROTOTYPES IT WILL BE MORE ABOUT QUANTITY UH OF SPEECH OR HOW LONG 
HOW MUCH SOMEONE SPEAK ABOUT WHEN WE WILL GO TO FINAL UH DETAILS 
IF I'M TALKING AND SOMEONE SAY YES YES YES FROM TIME TO TIME TO SHOW THAT HE'S PARTICIPATING 
AND OBVIOUSLY IT MAKES DIFFERENT THAT IF SOMEONE IS TALKING AND ONE IS REPLYING NEVER UH NOR MOVING OR NOR HAVING EYES OPEN 
OKAY 
GO THROUGH THEM 
OKAY 
NO I THINK UH I THINK WE HAS ALREADY HAVE PLENTY TO READ 
TRY 
AND THE APPLICATION YOU ARE USING ALL OF THEM UH YOU EVERY TIME YOU ARE USING MATLAB OR YOU ARE PROGRAMMING EVERYTHING IS BASED BASED ON MATLAB 
MM 
MM MM MM 
OKAY 
I'M WRITING IS ONLY UM CAN READ 
IT'S UH A KIND OF SECRET LANGUAGE 
OKAY 
AT THIS PRECISE TIME YEAH 
UH YOU CAN'T ATTEND MULTIPLE SESSION AT THE SAME TIME SO 
HMM 
MM-HMM YEAH NO 
HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
BUT YEAH 
YEAH 
I LIKED THE INVITED SPEAKER UM BUT THE IMPLANT IN THE OR 
IT'S QUITE GOOD ONE 
I THINK SO YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
HMM 
HMM 
NO QUITE GOOD UH 
A BIT HOT STILL ABOUT THE B THE BEACH NEARBY IS QUITE NICE YEAH 
YOU SHOULD TRY TO I DON'T KNOW 
DID YOU GO ROUND 
BEFORE OUR AFTER YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 'CAUSE I 
YEAH I STAYED I STAYED TWO DAYS BEFORE SO UH I WANT YOU J YOU JUST TAKE THE TRAIN MAYBE THAT'S THE SAME I'M NOT SURE 
TRAIN NORTH 
HALF AN HOUR TRAIN YEAH 
YEAH 
WEST OR NORTH I DON'T KNOW UH 
NO NO NO NOT VERY FAR 
NO NO 
IT'S DIFFERENT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
WELL YOU 
WE CAN TAKE THE TRAM AND A TURN 
IT'S IT'S ALL CONDITIONED 
YEAH 
OH 
MM 
OH SORRY 
NO NO NO IT'S UH OR SO I'M NOT SURE 
YEAH 
YEAH ORIGINALLY I BROUGHT IT BECAUSE I MARKED SOME PAPERS BUT YEAH 
ONL ONLY O ONE WHICH SURPRISED ME A BIT IT WAS UH SPEAKER RECOGNITION I THINK ABOUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
THEY WERE TRYING TO MODEL UH UM COVARIANCE OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS FOR G. M. M. INSTEAD OF USING A DIAGONAL 
BUT THEN IF YOU USE A FULL IT'S TOO MUCH 
SO THEY USE SOME APPROACH WHERE THEY TO THEM AUTOMATICALLY AND UH AFTER THAT WELL 
IT'S MORE LIKE TYING IT IS STILL FULL ABOUT DIFFERENT UM COMPONENTS ARE TIED DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE MATRIX ARE TIED 
EQUAL 
OH 
NO NO YOU HAVE TO STORE A MINIMUM NUMBER A REDUCED NUMBER OF PARAMETERS 
AND THEY ARE TIED IN A LINEAR WAY ACTUALLY SORRY NOT EQUAL BUT IT DOESN'T 
YEAH EXACTLY THAT'S IT UH 
SO THEY JU YEAH 
YEAH 
INTERESTING THING IS THAT THEY APPLIED TO ONE SPEAKER RECOGNITION AND IN THE FEATURES BEFORE THEY HAD THREE DIFFERENT WAYS TO UM DECORRELATE THE FEATURES 
AND AND THIS THEY SHOWED IT UH WITHOUT THIS 
WITH DIAGONAL G. M. M. OR WITH THIS AND WITH THIS WITH UH SEMI TIED COVARIANCE MATRICES 
IT WAS A LESS MUCH LESS SENSITIVE TO UH WHICH UM DECORRELATION PROCEDURE YOU CHOOSE 
IF YOU SEE 
A A ALSO BETTER BUT OF COURSE IT DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF OF PARAMETERS YOU PUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I I THINK I THINK IT WAS EVEN SLIGHTLY BETTER YEAH 
MAYBE I CAN FIND OUT 
L. D. A. YEAH L. D. A. 
MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO USE UH A FULL COVARIANCE MATRIX 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S THIS ONE 
IT'S I IMPROVED COVARIANCE MODELLING 
YEAH 
NO BUT IN THE PROCEEDINGS YOU CAN FIND THEM 
THEY ARE BETTER YEAH 
THEY TRIED P. C. A. L. D. A. M. L. L. T. 
I I IT'S NOT REALLY ANYTHING NEW BUT UH THE MM THEY JUST APPLIED THAT IT SPEAKER I. D. 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I ISN'T IT SMALLER THE MINIMUM NO 
I DON'T KNOW I JUST 
MM 
MM 
YEAH OKAY 
BUT IT'S NOT UH AN INTRINSIC LIMITATION IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF OUR YEAH 
OKAY 
SO IT'S NOT NO IT'S NOT SYMMETRIC NECESSARILY 
'KAY 
SO HE'S MAXIMISING THAT ARE MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH UH YEAH 
HOW DID YOU COPE WITH WHAT YOU MENTIONED SOME TIME BEFORE 
THAT IF IT'S A VERY LONG SESSION FOR EACH TWELVE POINT FIVE FROM YOU WILL ACTUALLY GET THE SAME SEGMENT NOW 
SO HOW DO 
OH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
SORRY 
MM UH WHAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT WHAT NIST IS TRYING TO DO ONE 
SO 
YEAH B 
YEAH BUT THEN WE ALL OPTIMISE UH IN THE SAME TASK 
SO YOU CANNOT GET ANYTHING NEW OUT OF THAT AFTER SOME TIME 
YEAH BUT THEN YOU RUN OUT OF TIME 
NO I IDEALLY YOU'RE CORRECT UH BUT 
MM 
SO YEAH 
UH HOW HOW DO THEY HOW DO THEY EVALUATE 
I JUST DON'T KNOW 
SO THEY ASK PEOP THEY ASK PEOPLE TO SET AND LISTEN BASICALLY 
YEAH 
HMM 
OKAY 
BUT THEY DO THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MEASURE LIKE YOU HAVE AN ORIGINAL SPEECH YOU TRANSCRIBE IT AND 
OKAY 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 
SO MAYBE WELL BUT THEN WELL IN IF SOMEBODY LIKE NIST WILL HAVE ONE RECOGNISER AND YOU JUST PLUG A DIFFERENT FEATURE BUT UH IT'S DANGEROUS 
RIGHT 
MM 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HEM HEMANT IS USING DIFFERENCE 
SEEMS 
HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
WOULD BE MM WOULD BE NICE FOR AURORA MAYBE TO HAVE THAT 
AUR AURORA 
YEAH 
NO NO BUT YEAH YEAH 
MM 
HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH DAIMLER YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
YOU KNOW THEY'RE EXTREMELY SECRETIVE 
I HAD A HARD TIME JUST TO GET THE SIGNALS 
SO I ASKED OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT UH IT'S QUITE TOUGH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THEY HAVE TO YEAH 
THEY HAVE YEAH THEY HAVE TO DO SOME TEST ON THEIR MERCEDES SOME SPEECH RECOGNITION TEST MM BUT IT SEEMS NOW THEY MM AT LEAST DAIMLER 
THEY MOSTLY WORK ON DIALOGUE MANAGEMENT UH BUT NOT MUCH IN FEATURES AND RECOGNITION 
NO 
YEAH 
I D I MM 
I DOUBT THEY ARE TRYING RIGHT NOW 
I DOUBT THAT AT DAIMLER THEY ARE TRYING RIGHT NOW BUT MAYBE OTHER COMPANIES MM 
OH 
CHAN 
JORDA JORDAN COHEN 
NO NO 
MM 
BUT THERE YOU COULD SEND AN S. M. S. I THINK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UH YOU COULD DICTATE TEXT SO 
IN A PHONE YEAH 
THE PHONE THAT UH COHEN YEAH VOICE SIGNALS 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW THAT'S 
OKAY 
HMM 
SO IT'S STILL STILL REAL TIME 
HMM 
OH OKAY BUT BUT NOT MUCH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND IT'S ALWAYS THE OTHER WAY AROUND THAT'S HOW YOU PUT IT IN 
I THINK THE THE MOST OF THE BAD WORDS OR AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THE PEOPLE TRY TO PUT IN ONE 
HUH 
WOAH 
UH I CANNOT PUT IT 
OH NO NO NOT AT ALL 
WELL GENEVA THAT'S WHY I'M HERE AT IDIAP BECAUSE I ATTENDED GENEVA EUROSPEECH 
I C 
WHY WHY YOU CANNOT 
MM-HMM 
EXACTLY 
MUTE 
OKAY SO YOU ATTENDED MOSTLY POSTERS I GUESS 
SO HOW MANY PRESENTATION YOU YOU 
I REALISED IT WERE THAT THERE WERE PANEL DISCUSSIONS ONLY TO THE PLACE WHERE I COULD USE THE THE TO TO YOU KNOW 
THERE WERE SOME BOARDS SAYING THAT THERE IS SOME PANEL DISCUSSION 
UH BUT I I COULDN'T GET IN ONE KNEW WHERE IS IT WHAT IT IS WHERE IT HAPPENS AND WHY AND SO FORTH 
IT WAS COM 
YEAH 
FINALLY I FOUND ABOUT 
WELL THIS IS NOT THIS SPEECH IS NOT RESTRICTED ONLY TO PAPERS AND THESE THINGS YOU KNOW 
SO HOW DID YOU LIKE LISBON THEN 
YEAH 
YEAH WE WE WANT TO THE COSTA CAPARICA THERE WITH THE BASE 
WE WE WERE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE TAKE THE DIRECT ONE BUT WE DIDN'T 
NORTH 
OKAY SO YOU STAYED AT THE AT THE SAME COAST NOT NOT YOU DIDN'T GO TO THE ISLAND 
ACROSS THE RIVER WHERE WHERE IS THE BRIDGE AND AND THEN OKAY SO THAT WAS A DIFFERENT PLACE 
YEAH WITH HAMED UH HEMANT AND THESE PEOPLE 
THE MORE SOUTH TO THE THE HOLE THROUGH THE WATER 
HUH 
I WAS 
I WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT EVEN THE TRAMS DID HAVE A O. C. THERE 
I COULDN'T USE IT IT AT ALL 
YEAH OR RIGHT BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE SOMETHING LIKE ONE 
UH IT'S O. C. 
WELL 
IT IT WAS MUCH BETTER IF IF IF YOU WOULD HAVE TO SPEND A HERE AND A HALF THAT UH HEMANT AND THE OTHERS SPENT WHILE GOING WITH A C UH WITH A BASE IT AT THE CONFERENCE CENTRE FROM FROM THE THE HOTEL THAT WE WERE 
THERE WAS A DIRECT BUS AND IT TOOK THEM HERE AND A HALF THEN 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE BUT IT TOOK SOMETHING WHICH WHICH WAS UH DIRECT IN QUOTES 
IT WAS IN INTO THE F DIRECT AS ANYTHING ELSE BUT 
UH IT SOUNDS SOUNDS LIKE 
LET'S GO ON THIS WAS JUST A 
OF WHAT 
PRUNING OF COVARIANCE MATRIX 
BUT WHAT WHAT DOES IT MEAN TIED THEN 
OH YEAH BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO STORE THE WHOLE MATRIX AND PLUS SOME EXTRA INFORMATION WHAT IS TIED TO WHAT ARE B 
YEAH BUT 
UH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THIS BUT 
TYING 
MM 
BUT UH THE THE MAIN POINT IS IT TO UH LIKE MAKE IT FASTER THE THE THE DECODING OR WHAT 
WELL THAT'S POSSIBLE WHY WHY IT SHOULD BE I IMPOSSIBLE 
SO IT'S COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IT WITH FULL COVARIANCE MATRIX 
WHY 
YEAH COMPUTATIONALLY E EXPENSIVE BUT 
OF COURSE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF COMPUTATION BUT OTHERWISE IT'S THERE'S NO PROBLEM NO 
WITH OKAY 
OKAY SO SO HERE YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE EITHER MANY MANY THINGS TO STORE AND HUGE COMPUTATION UH 
YEAH YEAH 
NO 
UH DEPENDS 
SO 
SO THERE ARE IN RESULTS THERE 
NO 
HMM YEAH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
WHY IT HAS TO BE ONLINE 
OKAY 
LIKE EXTENDED AS IS MORE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE OKAY 
OF COURSE OF COURSE 
WOAH 
YEAH IT'S RIGHT 
THIS IS MAYBE BECAUSE OF F. F. T. A. OR THESE THINGS 
IT'S N NOT SO SMALL SO SO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT MAYBE MAYBE BECAUSE OF OTHER PROCESSING AFTER 
NO 
YEAH 
WELL NOISY YES 
OVERLAP YOU MEAN 
UH W HOW DO YOU MEAN TO SAY 
OH 
UM I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FIRST IS ESSENTIALLY HOW HE'S DOING IN THAT 
NO WELL UH ONCE HE GETS THE FROM LIKE FROM HERE IT HERE THEN WHERE HE ADVANCES TO TO START WITH C COMPUTATION OF THE NEXT FRAME 
YEAH MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
FU OK OKAY SO DO WHAT DO YOU MEAN FULL 
SOME SOME SUB WINDOW OR THE THE WHOLE TEN SECONDS OF SPEECH OR WHAT 
IT HAS TO BE ALSO SOME SOMEHOW 
OKAY SOMETHING LONGER WINDOW THAN THE ONE WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT OKAY 
UH W 
OKAY SO YOU HAVE A WINDOW AND THEN YOU SPLIT IT IT IS TWO PARTS AND YOU SHIFT THE THE POINT WHERE YOU SPLIT IT OR OKAY 
OKAY SPLITTING POINT OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO BASICALLY WE HAVE TWO FIXED POINTS 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO ONCE YOU HAVE SAY AN HOUR OF SPEECH YOU START AT THE BEGINNING AND FIRST YOU TRY WITH TWENTY MILLISECONDS 
THEN YOU SHIFT TO TWENTY FIVE AND SO FORTH UNTIL YOU 
OKAY AND AND YOU FIND THE POINT WHERE WHERE WHAT 
WHERE WHERE DO YOU STOP ACTUALLY 
YEAH MM I KNOW BUT YOU START AT TWENTY AND GO TO SIXTY BUT WHERE WHICH POINT DO YOU CHOOSE 
OH OKAY BUT WHICH WHICH LIKELIHOOD RATIO 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT UH LIKELIHOOD THAT'S SOMETHING AND SOMETHING 
W WHAT IS LIKELIHOOD 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT IT HAS TO YEAH 
OKAY 
SO IT'S BASIC 
SO 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT STILL 
IF 
MM 
YEAH BUT WHY DO THE MAIN VALUE WHICH ARE COMPARING TO 
THE THE THE OVERALL VALUE OR OVERALL LIKELIHOOD OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT WHY HE'S USING THE WHOLE SIGNAL FOR THIS 
BECAUSE EASE OF THE WHOLE SIGNAL WAS UH STEADY SOMEHOW AND IT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE MODELLED BY L. P. MODEL 
WELL THEN THE RESIDUE WILL BE VERY LOW 
SO HE'S SUPPOSING THAT THE WHOLE SIGNAL WON'T BE ABLE TO TO BE CAPTURED BY L. P. MODEL AND THAT THE RESIDUE WOULD BE HIGH ENOUGH OR UH WH WHY HE'S COMPARING THE O IT AT THE OVERALL 
YOU KNOW I I DON'T USE THE POINT OF DIVIDING OVER THE THE WHOLE STUFF 
YOU WILL SOUNDS SOUNDS REASONABLE 
I SEE I SEE I SEE 
OKAY THAT'S REASONABLE 
BECAUSE ACTUALLY IF IT IF IF UH THE WHOLE SIGNAL WOULD BE ABLE TO BE MODELLED BY L. UH BY L. P. C. THEN ANYWAY HE HAS TO DESIGN SOME SOME FRAMING 
SO EVEN IF IT'S VERY STATIONARY BY D UM BY DIVIDING OVER THIS WHOLE STUFF UH IS ABLE TO FIND SOME REASONABLE BOUNDARIES 
UM M M MAKES SENSE UM 
OKAY 
AND 
MM 
THAT HAS TO BE POWER NOT ENERGY DEFINITELY ONE 
YEAH BUT IT HAS TO BE NORMALISED 
BY THE LENGTH 
THEN POWER INSTEAD OF ENERGY 
ENERGY OVER LENGTH IS POWER 
YEAH YEAH 
DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH 
OKAY 
SO BUT THIS IS TWO THINGS I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND 
TH THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONLY FOR M. F. C. C. S AND THIS EASY FEATURES UH ONE QUESTION I I WANTED TO ASK BEFORE 
DOES DOES HE PRESERVE WITHIN THE FEATURE VECTOR THE FRAMING HE'S USING FINALLY 
BECAUSE DOES HE SOMEHOW PUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT WAS THE SIZE ABOUT THE FORM AT THE FEATURE VECTOR ITSELF OR HE'S THROWING AWAY THIS FRAMING 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE RECOGNISER COULD BE GOOD FOR THE RECOGNISER TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE CHOSEN FRAMING BY THIS EXTRACTION 
OKAY 
SO SO IT IN UH IT MIGHT BE BAD FOR THEN FOR THE BACK AND IT MIGHT SCREW UP THE THE TO SPEECH RATE OR NORMALISER 
HUH 
UH PROBABLY I DIDN'T GET TO TO USE THE FRAMING IS ACTUALLY EQUI DISTANT 
JUST THE WINDOWS ARE WIDER UH UH I SEE 
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE CRAZY YEAH A LITTLE BIT 
UH I S S SO IT'S IT'S LIKE THIS 
YEAH 
I CANNOT IMAGINE THE TRANSFORMATION TO GET THE MODULATION SPECTRUM OUT OF SUCH A STUFF 
OH 
MM 
SO WHY DON'T YOU STILL USE IT 
IF IT WORKS AS WELL 
YEAH BUT YOU DO THE SPEECH CODING SO DO YOU STILL USE IT 
WHY 
MM 
OH 
UH IT'S INTERESTING THIS 
WELL THERE SHOULD BE AFTER EACH CONFERENCE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE TEN PEOPLE SHOULD SIT DOWN READ THE PAPERS AND THEN RANK THEM 
YOU KNOW A ALL THE ALL THE ALL THE SIMILAR PAPERS WITHIN ONE SESSION SAY SP UH FACES AT THIS TOPIC 
AND SAY THIS IS THE BEST THIS WORKS SLIGHTLY WORSE THAN THIS ONE 
AND THROW AWAY WHAT IS NOT THAT GOOD AND AND THE THE FIRST THREE THREE PAPERS WHICH ARE THE BEST SHOU SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND USED FROM FROM THAT TIME ONWARDS 
LIKE FORGET THE ALL THE M. F. C. C. S BECAUSE IT'S TOO OLD AND THEN START BUILDING THE STORY ON THE NEW STUFF AND NOT 'CAUSE IT'S 
YEAH IT IS BUT I KNOW I KNOW UH TH THIS IS JUST A THEORY 
BECAUSE 
MM YEAH 
YES AND I WANT TO YEAH 
YEAH 
IT LOOKS LIKE 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BECAUSE IT UM IT SEEMS THAT EVERYONE IS STILL COMPARING TO P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. C. S 
AND THERE ARE SO MANY NEW SYSTEMS AND EVERYTHING IS NOW BUT IT BASELINE IS STILL UH TO TWENTY YEARS OLD AND 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
NO OKAY SO 
SO IT SHOULD BE VERY PAPERS THEN SHOULD CONTAIN ALL THE RESULTS FROM NIST EVALUATION OR SOME STANDARD TASK THEN 
OTHERWISE 
UH UH THAT'S THE OTHER YEAH 
OKAY SO IT COULD BE YOU YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUBLISH THE RESULTS ON THIS STANDARD TASK 
AND THEN YOU COULD SAY WELL I ALSO TRIED ON THIS AND THIS 
YEAH 
YOU KNOW BUT THEN THEN ONLY IT MAKES SOME PROGRESS THIS 
MM 
YEAH BUT CAN FOR FOR EXAMPLE CAN YOU SEE FROM SOME DATA FROM FROM THE L. T. WORLD 
FOR TRAINING SAY 
YEAH BUT THEY GIVE YOU ALSO TRAINING DATA OR ONLY THE TESTING DATA 
UH I UH SINCE THIS IS ONLY OKAY 
OKAY SO SO THEY GIVE YOU ONLY THE TRAINING OR DEVELOPMENT DATA ONLY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OH 
AL ALMOST 
YEAH 
WE ARE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AT IDIAP AND THERE ARE ALREADY TWO IS TWO DIFFERENT SETUPS 
STORIES AND NUMBERS OR 
YEAH 
UH I THINK WE USE DI DISTINCT TRAIN AND TEST SET EVEN USE THE DIFFERENT SETS OF PHONEMES 
DIFFERENT 
WELL I DON'T USE ONLY DIGITS 
MY M. L. P. S ARE TRAINED ON EVERYTHING AND UH TEST SET IS DIGITS YEAH 
FOR FOR WHAT 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU CANNOT PLAY WITH THAT 
BECAUSE OF THE VOICES WOULDN'T BE COMPARABLE THEN 
OH 
HMM 
BECAUSE WHO IS THE ONE WHO MAKES WHO ACTUALLY USES WHAT WE DO TRY TO DO HERE 
THESE ARE COMPANIES OR BECAUSE IT'S NOT SCIENTISTS SCIENTISTS JUST START FROM P. L. P. AND THEN DESIGN THE NEW FEATURES 
NOW BACK AND OUR NEW ANYTHING BUT THEY START FROM THE OLD STUFF 
BUT WHO IS THE ONE WHO IS USING THESE RESULTS WHICH WE PUBLISH AND TRY TO MAKE 
YEAH BUT ONCE YOU ONCE YOU FINISH YOUR P. H. D. YOU GO AND IT'S OVER 
AND THOSE WHO DON'T 
THEY STAY AND PUBLISH ANOTHER PAPERS AND THEY BUT THEY THEY DON'T TURN INTO A LIFE NO 
INTO LIFE 
MM UH-HUH 
BECAUSE 
I I WON 
YES 
I WONDER WHICH LEVEL THEY ARE USING OUT OF WHAT IS THERE 
HMM 
YEAH 
THEY GRAB 
HMM 
HMM 
OKAY SO WE CAN HOPE THAT NOKIA WILL BE USING TANDEM TANDEM P. L. P. S 
YEAH I CANNOT 
HUH 
SO IT'S NOT RELATED TO CASE 
YEAH BUT IT WAS 
MM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
BECAUSE THEY GRAB WHATEVER IS CERTAIN TO WORK AND THEY THEY USE IT 
THEY DON'T SEE ANYTHING WHICH IS IT UH IT NOW WHICH IS NOT THAT SAFE 
IT'S LIKE A IT'S LIKE A NOISE YOU KNOW THEY USE FOR EIGHT FOUR EIGHT SIX 
MACHINES TO TO TO TO PUT TWO IN UH SPACE SHIPS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S KNOWN TO WORK PERFECTLY WELL OR PENTIUM 
NOT ANY P. FOUR OR WHATEVER BECAUSE IT'S SAFE IT HAS BEEN WORKING FOR TWENTY YEARS 
AND THEN ONLY IT SAFE TO PUT WILL NOT TWENTY BUT IT'S ALWAYS YEAH YEAH OF COURSE 
OF COURSE 
MM YEAH 
MM 
HYNEK ALSO TOLD ABOUT THIS COHEN CE CELL PHONE WHICH HE WAS SHOWING IT TO WORK L UH WITH THE L. V. C. S. R. 
UH HE WAS SAYING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY REALLY UH SIMPLE THE DECODER I MEAN NOT THE FEATURES BUT HE WAS MENTIONING SOMETHING TO THE DECODER 
THIS IS JUST THERE IS ALIMA 
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE IN D. T. W. OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT REALLY SURE BUT HE MENTION THAT 
HMM 
THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE 
YEAH BUT IT'S THAT'S A SIMILAR ONE TO WHAT HERVE HAS FOR EXAMPLE SOME HE WAS SHOWING IT UH LIVE IN M. L. M. I. C LAST M. L. M. I. CONFERENCE 
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE VIDEO AND PLAY IT UH 
IT UH I'M NOT SURE 
YES COMMERCIAL PHONE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ALWAYS 
WELL THEY THEY JUST BOUGHT A MOBILE AND BASED ON THE U. S. IT'S USING THEY THEY THEY DEVELOPED THE SOFTWARE 
NO THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT PHONE THIS IS NOT THE COMMERCIAL STUFF WITH THE SOFTWARE 
THEY JUST USE THE DEVICE 
BY BY WHAT 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ALREADY THE CASE RIGHT NOW 
YOU HAD TO GET USED TO THE SYSTEM INTO THE SYSTEM TO YOU 
IT'S NICE 
BY THE WAY 
YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE TO ASK IS THERE ANYTHING IF I'M JUST A P PRIVATE PERSON AND I WENT FOR FOR ANY SOFTWARE WHICH IS ABLE TO READ UM A BOOK IN ENGLISH 
UH FOR EXAMPLE THAT FESTIVAL AM I ABLE TO PUT THE TEXT TO THE SYSTEM AND IT IN REAL TIME TO LISTEN TO THE OUTPUT 
FESTIVAL IS ABLE TO TO TO READ JUST A MM NORMAL PLAIN TEXT ON REASONABLE COMPREHENSIBLE ENGLISH OR IS THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND IT 
NON NATIVE SPEAKER 
MM OKAY 
YEAH 
AND IT'S IN REAL TIME IN A REASONABLE MACHINE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
'CAUSE THE THE DIPHONE THAT I WAS TRIED TO INSTALL IT AND THERE THERE ARE THE VOICES LIKE CAT VOICE AND THESE VOICES THIS IS NOT THE ONE 
BECAUSE UH I DON'T KNOW WHICH WHICH UM WHAT I WHAT IS RUNNING WHERE UH IF IT'S DIPHONE OR WHICH UH APPROACH THIS IS 
YES 
SO IT'S UH JUST UH WHA SAMPLES OF THE DIPHONES AND IT CHOO CHOOSES 
YEAH IN MY IN MY LAPTOP 
OR HERE 
YEAH YOU CAN YOU CAN EASILY YES I D I'VE TRIED 
BUT THERE ARE SOME BUILT IN LIKE EASY VOICES WHICH YOU CAN YOU UH THERE IS A DEFAULT ONE COMPLETELY SYNTHETIC 
WHICH YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL 
AND THE THEN THERE IS A DIPHONE SYNTHESIS I THINK IT IS THE DIPHONE SYNTHESIS FROM THE SAME LIKE SOMETHING LIKE CAT W VOICE AND SOMETHI THIS IS IS IS 
BUT IT'S THIS DOESN'T SOUND VERY NICE AND WE WERE PLAYING AT THE UH SUMMER SCHOOL WITH THEM ACTUALLY WITH THE OTHERS 
AND THEY WERE PLAYING US SOME OTHER OTHER APPROACHES AND IT IT SOUNDED LIKE A HUMAN IT WAS GREAT BUT 
YEAH 
SO THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT FOR FOR OR SOMETHING 
BUT IT IT'S NOT HERE AS FAR 
OKAY I'M I'M FINE WITH THIS BUT I CAN MAKE IT RUN ON MY MACHINE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
AND AND THE ENGINE IS IS IN THE FESTIVAL ITSELF 
SO IT'S JUST A VOICE TO TO OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM MM 
OKAY 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
OKAY 
UH IT'S RIGHT I MEAN 
YEAH I JUST AS AS THE DOUGLAS ADAMS UH UH THAT THAT BOOK YOU KNOW THE MM HOW IT'S CALLED 
JUST GENERAL ENGLISH TEXTBOOK I I CHO I TRIED 
IN THE T. T. X. T. 
YEAH ASCII FILE BASICALLY 
YOU HAVE TO BUT YOU CAN TAKE A P. D. F. AND CONVERT P. D. F. TO SC 
YEAH 
IT WAS A LINE WITH HASHES AND IT WAS HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH 
UH I'M NOT THEN I DON'T WANT TO GO TOO MUCH INTO DETAILS JUST A LITTLE BIT 
MM WELL I CAN PREPARE S SORRY 
THESE ARE THE EDINBURGH PEOPLE IN 
MM-HMM YEAH VOICE 
THAT I KNOW 
UM UH 
NO UH 
NO UH 
MM 
OKAY 
HMM SO WE ALL ATTENDED INTERSPEECH NO 
SO HOW MANY SESSIONS YOU ATTENDED 
I MEAN DID YOU ATTEND ANY ANY SESSION 
YEAH 
THAT'S REALLY THAT'S REALLY YOUR SO ANY GENERAL IMPRESSION OR FEEDBACK 
SO IF FOR ANY OF YOU IT'S A FIRST CONFERENCE OR MAYBE FOUR 
NO I MEAN IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S UH INTERSPEECH IS REALLY BIG CONFERENCE FOR SPEECH SO DID YOU ATTEND BEFORE 
AH OK OK YEAH O OK YEAH SO THEN YOU'RE HIDING A YOU HAVE ATTENDED BEFORE YES 
YEAH I SEE SO 
YEAH YEAH 
I IT I 
UH I THINK IT'S QUITE INTERESTING BUT ONLY ANNOYING THING IS THIS MULTIPLE SESSIONS 
AND MOST SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T ABLE TO GO TO ORAL TALK THIS ORAL PRESENTATIONS MOST OF THE TIME 
BECAUSE BECAUSE LIKE POSTERS SO YOU CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME POSTERS LOOKING AT M MANY POSTERS THAN SITTING TWENTY MINUTES FOR ONE ORAL PRESENTATION 
SO ON TO TWENTY MINUTES YOU CAN SEE AT LEAST TWO THREE POSTERS AND YOU CAN DIRECTLY TALK TO PEOPLE USE 
EVEN I FOUND LIKE UH VERY FEW PEOPLE IN SOME ORAL PRESENTATIONS 
I THINK MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE LIKE THEIR OWN POSTERS ONLY 
YEAH HOW PRESENTATIONS OR HARDLY HANDFUL OF LIKE F FIVE EURO MORE 
YEAH 
AH OK 
HMM YEAH 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
EVEN SOME PANEL DISCUSSIONS ON THAT HUMAN SPEECH RECOGNITION REDUCING GAP BETWEEN THE U. S. R. AND AND H. S. R. 
IT WAS A BIT INTERESTING LOT OF ARGUMENTS AND 
YEAH B DIFFERENTLY IT'S MAINLY THE DIFFERENCES DIFFERENT APPROACHES OF ENGINEERS VERSUS LINGUISTS OR PHONETICIANS AND YEAH MM 
OH OKAY 
YEAH EVEN THE PANEL DISCUSSIONS W I THINK ONE IS REALLY HELD IN SMALL ROOM SO PEOPLE WERE REALLY CROWDED 
YEAH IT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AH OK WE WANT TO LOOK FOR SOUTH TO LAGOS AND YEAH THAT WE UH UH YEAH 
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD THOSE BEACHES ARE REALLY GOOD 
YEAH EVEN DOLPHIN IN THE YEAH 
BUT THE WEATHER WAS REALLY HATE THE SOUTH IT'S MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE 
OH 
LISBON WAS GOOD UM LITTLE BIT ABOUT MM 
YEAH EVEN LOCAL TRANSPORT IT'S IT'S 
BUT YEAH MOST OF THE TIME THE BUSES ARE REALLY CROWDED 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BIG CITY NO 
NO LIKE 
MM 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ONE OR YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT GOOD DIRECT BUS IS NOT GOOD LIKE 
SO YOU CAN GO TO THE DIRECT UH CE CENTRAL PLACE AND THEN OCCAS UH 
MM 
YEAH D 
UH WHAT IS THE PLACE UH THE THE CONTROL I MEAN WHERE WE CHANGE THE BASE IT YEAH IN THE YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN CHECK THE BOOKLET 
YEAH IT'S EITHER LIKE I USED TO FIND BUS NUMBERS FROM BOOK ONLY 
OH OKAY 
OH OKAY 
IT'S LIKE UH NO 
IT'S LIKE UH ALL THE SEMI TIED COVARIANCE MATRICES OR YEAH 
SO DID THEY REDUCE IT'S IN BETWEEN THE DIRECT COVARIANCE THIS IS FULL COVARIANCE 
SHOULD TRY TO REDUCE SOME PARAMETERS BY TYING 
OH 
OH 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 
IN YOUR IT IN 
NO I THINK THEY GET GOOD RESULTS WITH JUST USING DIAGONALS OR DEFINITELY YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
MAYBE DECORRELATION AGAIN THEY DO D. C. T. OR K. L. T. OR THEY DO THAT 
L. D. A. OR LIKE 
YEAH 
SO 
NO BUT STILL THERE IS THERE IS STILL EV THAT'S WHY LIKE PEOPLE COME 
YEAH DEFINITELY IT'S NOT OPTIMUM 
SO IT'S IT'S ALSO LIKE DOING ALONG ALONG THE DIAGONALS ALL AGAIN 
IT'S REALLY COMPUTATIONALLY REALLY UH YEAH SO SO SUPPOSE IF THIRTY NINE ON TO THIRTY NINE TO THIRTY NINE FOR EVERY YEAH YEAH SO 
OH THERE IS A THING 
YEAH 
NO NO PROBLEM BUT IF YOU S SO MANY MODELS AND SO MANY MIXTURES YEAH 
BUT 
YEAH THIRTY YOU CAN SEE YOU C YOU CAN'T REALLY LIKE EVEN YOU CAN'T THE MODELS ITSELF IS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT TIMES MORE THAN THAT IS 
SO YOU IF YOU HAVE LIKE FIVE MEGABYTES OR TEN MEGABYTES OF MODELS THEN YEAH 
BUT EVEN I THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT LIKE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE REALLY BIG SYSTEMS I GUESS LIKE STORING STORING ITSELF 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH IT'S REALLY IT 
YEAH YEAH FOR EVERY YOU'RE SO YOU'RE TO STORE ALL THIS THIRTY 
YEAH 
SO FROM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SPEAK UH YEAH DIFFERENT TASK AND 
SO UH I FOUND ON PAPER INTERESTING 
I THINK YOU KNOW VIVEK MOST OF YOU KNOW 
UH THIS IS UH VIVEK'S PAPER ON LIKE VARIABLE SCALE FEATURE EXTRACTION 
NORMALLY WE USE TO FIX IT WINDOW FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION LIKE TWENTY FIVE MILLISECONDS OR THIRTY SECONDS 
HERE HE'S PROPOSING VARIABLE SCALE BECAUSE THE FIXED SCALE AS NON OPTIMAL FOR IT'S NON OPTIMUM BECAUSE LIKE FOR VOWELS YOU CAN HAVE M MUCH LONGER 
AND FOR PLOSIVES AND THESE THINGS YOU REALLY SHORTER LIKE EVEN AROUND LESS THAN TWENTY MILLISECONDS ALSO 
SO HE'S KI PROPOSING LIKE THIS VARIABLE SCALE WINDOW F UH KIND OF ONLINE FOR EACH SEGMENT 
YEAH MM MM YOU CAN DO LIKE YOU CAN MEASURE AND YOU CAN DO BUT HE'S MM BASICALLY DOING SOME MM LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTING 
SO IF IS THE MAIN IDEA IS LIKE SUPPOSE YOU HAVE UH ONE SEGMENT SO HE'S TRYING TO FIND THE STATIONALITY CAUTIOUS STATIONALITY OF THAT SEGMENT 
YEAH SO MUCH AS POSSIBLE LIKE BUT YEAH DEFINITELY YOU HAVE TO ASSUME SOME L UH LIKE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM SIZES OF YOUR OWN 
SO UH IS USING MINIMUM OF MINIMUM IS UH I THINK TWO I DON'T TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLISECONDS I THINK 
MAXIMUM IS UH SIXTY MILLISECONDS 
SO THE MINIMUM 
NO NO I THINK A MINIMUM IS TWEN TWENTY MILLISECONDS IS I YEAH 
TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLISECONDS IS KIND OF SOFT 
TWENTY MILLIS MINIMUM IS NO NO IDEA BECAUSE OF UH 
NO YOU CAN USE MOL YEAH 
NO MAINLY BECAUSE OF UH M. F. C. C. COMPUTATION BECAUSE YEAH IT BECOMES REALLY NOISY LIKE IF YOU S YEAH 
TEN MILLISECONDS MEANS YOU HAVE ONLY EIGHTY SAMPLES FOR UH AND THEN YOU HAVE REFUSED TWENTY FOUR FILTERS THE FILTERS WON'T GET ANY SAMPLES SO 
YEAH BECAUSE OF COMPUTATION 
SO EVEN I I THINK EVEN ST UH UH CAN FIND LESS THAN TWENTY MILLISECOND WINDOWS ALSO ESPECIALLY FOR PLOSIVES UH 
SHIFTING YEAH HE'S USING TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLISE YEAH SHIFTING IS ALMOST SAME 
BUT THE PROBLEM LIKE 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH HE'S KEEPING SAME NUMBER OF FRAMES 
UH HE'S USING UH TWELVE POINT FIVE YEAH TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLISECOND 
YEAH 
NUMBER OF UH FRAMES 
W YOU WANT IT 
ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM'S AGAIN UH UH YOU USE THE SHIFT IS THE NYQUIST FREQUENCY IF YOU COMPARED MODULATION SPECTRUM 
SO AGAIN IF YOU CHANGE THIS SHIFT THE MOD THE NYQUIST THE MODULATION SPECTRUM NYQUIST FREQUENCY CHANGES FOR EACH WINDOW 
SO IF YOU WANT TO DO AGAIN ANOTHER HIGH LEVEL FEATURE EXTRACTION AGAIN IT WILL BE PROBLEM IS 
SO BUT HE'S UH LIKE HE'S UH DISCUSS I MEAN DESCRIBING THIS BECAUSE EVEN THIS ITSELF IS A PROBLEM 
KEEPING THE F UH FIX IT FROM SIZE BECAUSE YOU'RE ANALYSING YOUR THIS UH SEGMENT MANY TIMES 
SO THIS SHIFT WILL SUPPOSE IF YOU FIND ONE SEGMENT OF SIXTY MILLISECONDS AND THEN YOU'RE DOING THIS TEN MILLISECOND SO EVERY ALMOST I THINK YEAH 
MM UH YEAH FIVE FRAMES Y YOU'RE ANALYSING THE PREVI THIS ALREADY SEGMENT SO 
SO AGAIN THIS MAY BLUR SOME FREQUENCY TRANSITIONS OR YEAH 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS AGAIN THIS UH BOTTLENECK IS HERE LIKE YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR NYQUIST FREQUENCY MODULATION AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO IT'S SO UH IS THE MAIN IDEA IS LIKE FIRST TO TAKE THE SOME SOME WINDOW 
SOME SOME SOME SAMPLES THEN HE ASSUME SOMEWHERE SOME VARIABLE AND POINT THERE IS A CHANGE 
THEN THEN IT'S NOT SYMMETRIC I YOU CAN CHO UH Y IT'S BASICALLY UH IT LIKE AGAIN DO FOR ALL THE SAMPLES ON THAT GYRO 
SO THEN WHAT HE DOES IS LIKE UH PROPOSED UH LIKE SOME LIKE RATIO TEST BASED ON MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD 
SO THA THA THAT IS REALLY SIMPLE LIKE SO WHAT HE DOES IS LIKE SO HE HE COMPUTES THE RESIDUAL 
UH FIRST UH DOES THE L. P. ANALYSIS AND THEN HE COMPUTES THE RESIDUAL 
AND UH TAKES THE RESIDUAL ENERGY F F FULL SIGNAL LIKE GY GY GYRO SAMPLES 
THE FULL SIGNAL 
SO MAYBE I CAN 
THE WH THE WHOLE WINDOW 
NO THAT'S THAT LIKE HE ASSUMES YEAH SIXTY MILLISECONDS OR SOMETHING UH START WITH S SO THEN HE CAN YEAH YEAH 
YEAH THEN HE CAN SPLIT THAT WINDOW TO POINT N. SAY POINT N. SO THEN YOU WILL HAVE GYRO TWO ON YOU CAN SEGMENT TO MAYBE 
YEAH SO YES HE'S SUPPOSED THIS IS YOUR P WINDOW 
SO THEN YOU CAN MOVE YOUR LIKE THIS 
YOU CAN MOVE YOUR POINT IS THAT THEN THIS WILL BE LIKE ONE AND THIS WILL BE SECOND 
BUT AGAIN HE ASSUMES SOME INITIAL UH SIZES FOR THESE WINDOWS 
YEAH 
UH DON'T START WITH THE YEAH UH DON'T USE YEAH START WITH GYRO SAMPLE OR SOMETHING 
HE'S STARTING WITH UH IS THE L LEFT WINDOW IS STARTS AT TWENTY MILLISECONDS 
SO SO YOU ALREADY HEAR LIKE S SUPPOSE THIS IS FULL SIGNAL YOU'RE ALREADY HERE 
SO RIGHT WINDOW IS SHOULD NEED TO TWELVE POINT TWO SO YOU'RE TO SEARCH BASICALLY IN THIS RANGE 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND THEN IF YOU THE MAXIMUM IS SIXTY MILLISECOND FRAME FOR HIM 
SO IF YOU DON'T FIND ANYTHING 
SIXTY MILLISECONDS 
IF YOU DO 
IN THE POINT IS DEPENDING ON THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO 
SO HE GOT IS UH SUPPOSED THIS IS THIS IS SUPPOSE SE SEGMENT IN AND THIS IS SEGMENT TWO 
SO HE COMPUTE THIS ERROR HERE 
SO AND THEN UH P GIVES SOME KIND OF IN TERMS OF THIS RESIDUAL LETTER 
SO THIS RESIDUAL LETTER IS FOR FULL GYRO SAMPLES 
THEN THERE WOULD BE SUPPOSE THIS POINT IS EASY N. 
SO GYRO TO N. AND THEN LIKE 
SO THIS THE BA BASICALLY THE MENU UH QUESTIONS OR HERE 
YEAH HE'S FOR FINDING THE LIKELIHOOD FOR FULL FORM AND THEN IT'S BASICALLY LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST 
SO HE'S COMPARING THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE FULL SEGMENT DIVIDED BY THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE THE SUB SEGMENTS 
LIKELIHOOD OF THE UH LIKE THIS LIKELIHOOD IS UH THIS ERROR ESTIMATE OF THE RESIDUAL 
SO RESIDUAL POWER HE CAN COMPARE IT IS UH AFTER DO AFTER DOING L. P. HE CAN GET A L RESIDUAL AND THEN HE CAN COMPARE THE POWER OF THE RESIDUAL 
SO THAT HE'S PROVING THAT POWER IS AGAIN MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATE OF YOUR L. P. PARAMETERS 
SO THAT WHICH INTERESTING IT'S YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO DO A LOT OF COMPUTATION 
YOU JUST NEED TO TAKE THE ERROR OF AN UH RESIDUAL OF THIS FULL WINDOW AND THEN RESIDUAL OF ENERGY OF THE SUB WINDOWS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST DIVIDE THEM AND THEN THE ONLY THING IS LIKE AGAIN HE HAS TO USE SOME THRESHOLD TO DECIDE 
THAT THAT'S ONLY THE P PROBLEM 
UH GET UH HE'S FOUNDING SOMETHING MORE UH ROUND THERE ARE THREE POINT FIVE U. S. T. OPTIMUM THRESHOLD 
BUT THE AND ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS LIKE IT'S NOT REALLY CHANGING SPEECH RECOGNITION WHATEVER IS NOT REALLY CHANGING BECAUSE OF THE THRESHOLD SO 
UH YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO F LIKE FIDDLE WITH THRESHOLD A LOT SO MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THIS IS YEAH I UNDERSTAND 
THIS IS THIS IS THE ACTUALLY BASICALLY SOME THEORETICAL PROOF LIKE MAYBE IF YOU WANT THRESHOLD YOU CAN USE AND HE'S CODING FROM UH LEVEN LIKE UH 
NO THIS IS FROM AGAIN YEAH STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING 
WHAT THEY SAY HERE IS LIKE SUPPOSE IF YOU ANALYSE TWO DISTINCT OR UH THIS L. P. ANALYSIS ON THE SAME STATIONARY ANALYSIS WINDOW 
THE CODING WILL ALWAYS BE GREATER THAN THE ONES RESULTING FROM THIS ANALYSIS ON TWO WINDOWS 
TWO STATIONARY WINDOWS 
SO THE HE'S BASICALLY BASED ON THIS THEOREM SO SO WHAT HE'S SAYING IS LIKE IF YOU DO THIS ERROR 
IT WILL BE ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE MM THE THESE ERRORS OF TWO STATIONARY WINDOWS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH THIS MAYBE I THINK YEAH THIS HE'S GETTING SOME IMPROVEMENT BUT 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SO HE'S JUST UH UH HE'S NORMALISING THE ENERGY COEFFICIENT BECAUSE ENERGY IS REALLY AFFECTED A LOT 
UH SO HE'S LI 
ENERGY LIKE BECAUSE C. GYRO COMPONENT LIKE SO HE'S USING M. F. C. C. S HE'S NORMALISING THE C. GYRO COMPONENT FOR THIS TO YEAH 
POWER IS AGAIN LIKE YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH IT'S TIME LIKE YEAH 
IT'S OKAY LIKE SAMPLES OR YOU CAN SEE ROOT MEAN SQUARE ENERGY OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
NO NO NO YOU VO WHAT YOU MEAN LIKE THE WINDOW LENT 
THE SIXTY MIL NO IT I IT DOESN'T REALLY 
UH BUT I THINK IT'S UH HE DOESN'T SO I GUESS BECAUSE UH UH THEN LIKE YOU JUST YOU TAKE THESE FEATURES AND YOU TRAIN MODEL IS 
IT REALLY MATTERS WH WHAT FRAME SHIFT YOU'RE USING FOR MODELS LIKE BECAUSE HOW MANY HE NEEDS TO USE SAME FREQ 
NO NO WAIT 
NO UH WILL GET LIKE EVERY TEN MILLISECONDS HE GOT ONE FOR ONE FEATURES 
LIKE UH IT DOESN'T REALLY DEPEND BECAUSE SUPPOSE IF YOU TAKE YOUR T CASE 
LIKE YOU YOUR WINDOW I MAYBE LONGER SO DOESN'T REALLY MATTER LIKE HOW WHAT SIZE WINDOW YOU USE OR NOT 
BUT I TELL UH IT EVERY TEN MILLISECONDS WHETHER YOU GIVE SOME FEATURES OR NOT REALLY MATTERS NO 
LIKE SO 
SO TO DO YOU CAN USE UH THIRTY MILLISECONDS OR FIFTY MILLISECOND WINDOW 
SOME 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH FRAMING IT'S LIKE IT'S REALLY YEAH 
YEAH IF YOU HAVE IF YOU'RE CHANGE FRAMING IT'S REALLY I THINK EVEN IT'S REALLY PROBLEM NO 
LIKE IF YOU TRY EVEN MODELS ALSO I GUESS IF YOU CHANGE 
IT'S NOT ONLY WITH THIS MODEL IT'S IN SPECTRA AND SHIFTS IN DELTAS BECAUSE 
YEAH BUT IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED I THINK 
IF YOU S YEAH THAT BECOMES REALLY 
YEAH 
BUT THIS IS KIND OF INTERESTING 
YEAH YEAH YEAH THE TEMPORAL DEC 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH FIRST THIS IS PROPOSED BY LIKE UH EVEN WE RAID ONE PAPER ON OUR READING GROUP YOU REMEMBER THAT 
I HAVE IMPLEMENTED IT'S QUITE WORKING WELL LIKE UH YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH HONZA IS ALSO WORKED FOR HIS BE YEAH 
UH I YEAH 
NO HE WAS OUR UH WAS QUOTING 
BUT THAT 
YEAH HE WAS UH QUOTING THAT PAPER ALSO LIKE V HE WAS TELLING THIS UH THIS IS KIND OF OPTIMISATION CRITERIA WHAT THIS TEMPORAL DECOMPOSITION IS DOING LIKE 
YOU'RE TRYING TO SEGMENT YOUR S SIGNAL INTO LIKE DISCREET WINDOWS AND THEN USE BUT HE WAS TELLING LIKE THIS UH RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPTIMATION AND AND THEN CAUTIOUS STATIONALITY IS NOT REALLY OBVIOUS 
SO STATIONALITY IS AGAIN DIFFERENT ONE 
STATIONALITY IS THIS IS OPTIMATION WE WANT TO LOOK IS SOME SIGNAL 
FEW SEGMENTS WHICH CAN REALLY REPRESENT WHOLE SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY LIKE THIS MAY NOT BE REALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH THIS ONE YEAH HE'S GETTING SOME IMPROVEMENT N UH THIS IS A YEAH 
NO NO NO THEY AGAIN 
BUT AGAIN UH GETTING THAT TEN PAPERS IS REALLY DIFFICULT TASK 
IT TAKES MAYBE YEARS AND AGAIN UH IT DEFINITELY LIKE WHO WILL WHO WILL CHOOSE THE TEN PAPERS LOOK AND IF WE ASKED YEAH 
BUT YEAH THESE THINGS ARE PRACTICALLY KIND OF REALLY BUT I THINK THIS KIND OF THINGS WHAT YOU SHOWED I MEAN WHAT YOU SAID IS REALLY GOOD 
LIKE IF PEOPLE START IMPLEMENTING LIKE SOME PEOPLE PROPOSE SOMETHING IN FEATURE LEVEL SOME PROPOSE IN SOMETHING IN MODEL LEVEL BUT THOSE TWO ARE REALLY INDEPENDENT NO 
WHEN REALLY WORK COMBINE THESE TWO OR 
YEAH ESPECIALLY FEATURES LIKE SUPPOSE IF SOMEBODY COME WITH DIFFERENT GOOD FEATURES AGAIN PEOPLE ST AGAIN IS M. F. C. C. S 
NO NO IT IT'S NOT REALLY SURE ALSO MAKE SUPPOSE UH PEOPLE YOU CAN'T REALLY FORCE PEOPLE TO USE SOME FEATURES 
SO SO THEY W THEY WILL BE HAPPY WITH THEIR OWN FEATURES AND THEIR OWN SCRIPTS IS THEIR BIT RATE LIKE TEND TO CHANGE FEATURES EVERY TIME AND IT'S 
HMM 
BUT EVEN NIST YOU CAN 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
THEN 
SO AT LEA ESPECIALLY L. V. C. S. R. ONE REALLY BIG SYSTEMS THEN PEOPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BECAUSE YEAH IT'S IT'S AGAIN YOU DON'T KNOW 
OH 
NO THEN UH THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE CONFERENCE IN THREE YEARS OR SOMETHING FOR SPEECH BECAUSE 
BUT AGAIN LIKE 
THAT'S SO YOU CAN PUBLISH ONLY ONCE IN THREE YEARS OR 
YEAH 
BUT EVEN PEOPLE ARE DOING SUPPOSE IN INTERSPEECH THERE WAS UH SOME CHALLENGE FOR SPEECH SYNTHESIS 
SO SO WHAT'S IS UH LIKE IT CHALLENGE WAS REALLY GOOD LIKE SUP THEY GIVE THE DATABASE SO YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THAT DATABASE 
WHAT TECHNIQUE TO USE SO IT'S YOUR CHOICE LIKE ABOUT THAT DATABASE AND THEN THE RESULTS ANALYSIS SO THEY DECIDE SO 
EVEN SPEECH RECOGNITION ALSO SOME TESTS ARE COMING LIKE FOR PHONE SEGMENTATION OR SOMETHING 
PEOPLE GIVE SOME DATABASE AND THEN YOU HAVE IT DOES YOU CAN SEE WHATEVER YOU WANT AND YOU HAVE TO PRODUCE EVEN FOR FEATURES ALSO LIKE FEATURES ALSO I THINK 
YEAH YEAH TH THEY THEY DESIGNED THE DATA SUCH A WAY THAT IT'S IT'S REALLY LIKE REALLY REAL UH DATA 
NO NO FOR S NAY SPEECH SYNTHESIS IT'S LIKE THEY GIVE YOU SOME DATA 
SO WHETHER LIKE YOU USE FOR TRAINING OR L YOU CAN YOU CAN DO LIKE DATA DRIVEN OR LIKE MODEL BASED APPROACH OR WHATEVER LIKE 
AT THE AND THEN THEY WILL ASK YOU TO SYNTHESISE SOME SENTENCE AND YOU HAVE TO SYNTHESISE THEM AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SEND THEM 
YOUR TRAINING DATA ONL NO DEVELOPMENT TRAINING NO YEAH TRAINING 
EVALUATE IT'S AGAIN SUBJECT TO USE UH BECAUSE FOR SPEECH SYNTHES YEAH 
YEAH LISTEN AND YEAH D YEAH EVEN UH THEY IT'S MOSTLY THEY USE NATIVE SPEAKERS ONLY BECAUSE THEY CAN REALLY JUDGE WELL SO 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SO EVEN THEY PROPOSE SOME KIND OF WORD ERROR RATE 
SO YOU HAVE THE ORIGINAL SPEECH SO I THE SYNTHESISED SPEECH IS THERE ANY WORDS WHICH ARE NOT MATCHING 
SO EVEN SPEECH SYNTHESIS THEY'RE ALSO UH INTRODUCED THIS W. E. R. TERM SO 
OH 
BUT THIS WAS REALLY QUITE SUCCESSFUL LIKE IN THIS CONFERENCE INTERSPEECH 
IS A LOT OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN UH I THINK EVEN THEY'RE CONTINUING THIS FOR UH NEXT YEAR AND 
TEXT TO SPEECH 
BUT UH I HEARD LIKE EVEN FOR I. CASSP NEXT YEAR THERE IS SOME COM UH LIKE COMPUTATION BY MARTIN KRUG SHEFFIELD 
AND IN THIS FEATURE EXTRACTION STUFF AND SO AT LEAST IF YOU MAKE TASK SIMPLE FOCUS 
THEN IT MAY BE GOOD TO COMPARE THOSE FEATURES AND BUT IF YOU S S SOME UH LARGE VOCABULARY SYSTEM 
IT TAKES TOO SIX MONTHS TO BUILD NEED TO THE AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUR FEATURES ARE REALLY UH SO 
SO MAYBE THAT'S FOR LIKE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS USING P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. C. S 
IT'S IT'S SUCH A B LIKE LOT OF TIME INVOLVED SO YOU CAN'T REALLY CHECK MANY TH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT AT LEAST IN IDIAP WE HAVE THESE NUMBERS RECOGNISER IS ALMOST KIND OF FOUR IS EVERYBODY IS USING SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING ONE 
ALMOST ALMOST LIKE WE ARE PUTTING DIFFERENT FEATURES AND I THINK YEAH YEAH 
NUMBERS RECOGNISER IS NOT REALLY DIFFERENT FROM LIKE UH A F AT LEAST IN IDIAP WE HAVE ALMOST SAME 
BUT MAYBE YOU ARE USING TWENTY NINE THAT'S FOR YOU IT'S DIFFERENT BUT NO MORE 
BUT AT LEAST I TWENTY SEVEN 
HEMANT AND WE'RE ALL USING TWENTY SEVEN IS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE USING ONLY DIGITS SO MAYBE THAT'S HOW YOU 
NO BUT TEST SET IS DIGITS YOUR UM MAIN TASK IS DIGITS K YEAH 
THAT'S UH LIKE ABOUT A. G. I. NUMBERS OR THREE LIKE NOW WE'RE LITTLE BIT CONVULSED 
LIKE WE'RE USING TWENTY SEVEN PHONES AND BEFORE IT WAS LIKE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE 
BUT IT'S BETTER LIKE ONCE YOU HAVE LIKE WHATEVER THE BACK AND 
THEN YOU CAN PUT FEATURES LIKE WHETHER THEY'RE GAMMAS OR LIKE SPECTRAL ENTROPIES OR M. F. C. C. S OR WHATEVER 
THEN AT LEAST YOU CAN SEE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT AURORA IS 
AURORA TASK 
SO BUT AURORA IS IT REALLY BIG DATABASE OR I MEAN HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES TO SET UP SYSTEM AND THEN 
IT'S FAST NO 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS AURORA AGAIN THESE MODELS ARE WORD BASED MODELS NO 
YEAH SO AGAIN HERE WE USE TRIPHONES AND SO BUT DEFINITELY 
I D IF WE WANT TO SHOW NOISE SETTING IT'S YOU HAVE TO SHOW ON AURORA ALSO LIKE AURORA IS REAL TIME 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT YEAH 
YEAH AT LEAST I MEAN WHA THOSE STUDIES I THINK PEOPLE ALREADY DID FOR EVEN IN I. C. I. C. S. L. P. TWO THOUSAND TWO THREE IS SPECIAL SESSION IN FEATURES FOR AURORA 
SO YEAH YEAH I YEAH YEAH 
THIS CASE FEATURES AND THIS UH SO UH SO UH O. G. I. FEATURES AND ALL THIS 
SO THERE ARE ALREADY PEOPLE BUT AGAIN LIKE UH AT THE END LIKE FOR L. V. C. S. R. PEOPLE ARE USING P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. C. S OR NOTHING OF THESE FANCY FEATURE 
YEAH 
NOW 
BUT MAYBE MAY HAVE A F FOR PUBLISHING ANOTHER PAPER OR SOMETHING 
MM 
YEAH 
BUT MAYBE GUILLAUME YOU CAN TELL NO 
LIKE UH YOU WORKED I WITH THESE SIEMENS PEOPLE ARE NO SIEMENS OR THESE DAIMLER CHRYSTLER 
WHAT KIND OF FEATURES DO YOU SEE LIKE DO YOU USE UM ANY YOU DON'T YEAH YOU DON'T 
AH OK OKAY 
OKAY 
AH OK 
YEAH EVEN SO YEAH 
I DIDN'T DISCUSS ANYTHING WITH SUNIL ALSO LIKE I DUNNO TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS ANYTHING 
THIS KIND OF THINGS ARE A BIT YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY LIKE FEELING THAT WHETHER THEY GO FOR ALL THOSE NEW FEATURES ARE THEY USUALLY USE ONLY MM 
MAYBE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
BUT EVEN THEY DON'T BELIEVE LIKE WITH ONE PAPER OR TWO I GUESS BECAUSE AT LEAST FOR THEM IN P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. C. S 
THEY KNOW THAT OKAY THESE THINGS WORK ON EVERY TASK IS OKAY WE CAN PU PUT HANDS ON THESE THINGS YEAH 
HUH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
MAYBE LIKE YEAH F BECAUSE SUNIL IS WORKING ON NOKIA HE'S A EXPERT IN KIND OF FEATURES OR YEAH IT L I THINK 
BUT YEAH WE'RE NOT SURE EVEN SUNIL WON'T TELL US 
NO NO NO NO THIS UH COHEN YOU MEAN LIKE UH UH 
HMM 
AH OK 
HUH 
BUT THIS WAS SIGNAL COMPANY IN LIKE 
THIS VOICE SIGNAL COMPANY HY HYNEK ALWAYS MENTIONS UH COHEN'S COMPANY WITH WHAT THEY'RE USING YOU N YEAH 
VOICE NO NO VOICE SIGNAL 
THEY MAKE UH RECOGNITION FOR THESE SAMSUNG PHONES AND YEAH 
UH THEY HAVE LIKE REALLY SO MANY RECOGNISERS I GUESS 
MAYBE DEFINITELY THEY MAY BE USING P. L. P. S OR YOU KNOW 
YEAH RASTA OR RASTA OR SOMETHING YOU MEAN 
MM 
YEAH BECAUSE MM 
YEAH BUT AGAIN 
YEAH IT NOW IS REALLY DEFINITELY BECAUSE LIKE WANT TO AT LEAST SO I AT LEAST FOUR 
FIVE YEARS OF RESULTS OF SOME NEW FEATURES AND SOME CONSISTENT RESULTS ARE 
OH 
UH SPACE OR UH OKAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
BUT YEAH D 
YEAH UH ANOTHER ISSUE IS LIKE AGAIN THE COMPUTATIONAL ISSUES NO 
IF THEY WANT TO MAKE AN MOBILE THEY DON'T WANT REALLY SEE SOME FANCY REALLY EXPENSIVE COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE FEATURES ARE ALL THIS 
YEAH YEAH IT 
IT'S JUST PHONE RECOGNITION OR SOMETHING LIKE 
YEAH 
BUT MOST OF THE TIME MOBILES THEY USE D D. T. W. KIND OF THING IN LIKE 
ALL THESE UH S VOICE CALLING YEAH VOICE CALLING AND THIS THING BECAUSE THAT'S EASY LIKE 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY NEED TO PUT LOT OF UH MEMORY AND THESE THINGS OTHERWISE IF THEY WANT TO BUILD A REAL 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
WHERE WHERE 
MM 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH COHEN YEAH YEAH 
IT'S SAMSUNG SOME SOME NEW REALLY NEW PHONE LIKE MM 
YEAH 
BUT UH THE SOFTWARE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE OR LIKE 
IN THE SOFTWARE IS AGAIN ON TOP OF MOBILE OR LIKE IT COMES WITH YOUR MOBILE 
IN THE THING IS USUALLY THIS KIND OF THOSE KIND OF FACILITIES ARE LIKE N NOT NORMAL SO SO THEY MAY CHARGE MORE OR LIKE YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
AH OK YEAH DEFINITELY THEY MAY CHARGE FOR MORE MONEY F AGAIN SOME EXTRA BILL FOR THIS USING THIS RECOGNITION ENGINE OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT MAYBE LIKE IF IT CAN'T REALLY RECOGNISE YOU IT WILL BE REALLY ANNOYING IT'S BETTER 
YEAH I HAVE USED ONCE LIKE THIS DRAGON THAT WAS KIND OF GOOD LIKE YEAH 
BECAUSE EVEN IN WHEN I WAS WORKING ON UH LIKE IN EDINBURGH LIKE ONE GUY 
UH SO I UH GET SOME PROBLEM WITH HANDS AND THEN HE WAS ALWAYS USING THIS ONE UH DICTATION EVEN HE USED TO WRITE LOT OF C. PLUS PLUS CODE WITH THE DICTATION LIKE 
IT'S REALLY GOOD LIKE SO 
BUT YOU OUGHT TO REALLY TRAIN AND THEN YOU'RE TO KIND OF UH YEAH 
I GET USED TO THE SYSTEM 
YEAH YEAH IT'S REALLY LIKE YOU OUGHT TO GET USED TO THE SYSTEM 
LIKE YOU HOW TO SAY ALL THE CALLINGS AND THIS THING SYSTEM HOW IT BUT IT'S REALLY FUNNY LIKE 
UH IS ABLE TO USE IT FOR LIKE LIKE YEARS I MEAN UH USED TO WRITE A LOT OF CODE AND YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY GREAT 
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN LISTEN FESTIVAL 
READ THE LOOK 
MM YEAH 
YEAH YEAH FES YEAH I THINK I THINK YOU CAN DO THE FESTIVAL YOU CAN JUST CALL LIKE UH THIS THERE ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF AGAIN 
HOW YOU CALL THE FESTIVAL SO YOU CAN JUST GIVE THE FULL THERE IS ON IT 
SO THEN YOU WILL GET THE ALL THE CALLER AND OTHER THINGS 
IF IF YOU WANT TO LOOK READ FULL TEXT THEN YOU CAN SAY LIKE THE FULL TEXT 
LIKE THOSE SYNTAX AND THEN IT WILL SPEAK TILL IT FINISHES THE TEXT 
YEAH IT'S EARL IT'S YEAH 
DIPHONE YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S WHY IT'S REAL TIME LIKE OTHERWISE IT'S BIT DIFFICULT AND IT'S OKAY YOU CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND SO IT'S INTELLIGIBLE SO 
UH FESTIVAL IS GOOD LIKE NOW IT COMES AT ALL THE LINUX BOXES ALSO IS ONE IS ALREADY IN THIS 
IN THE THREE OR SO MANY VOICES LIKE AGAIN 
WHICH VOICE YOU WANT TO USE 
NO MOST OF THE THE FESTIVAL UH WHAT YOU GET IN LINUX MACHINES IS DIPHONE BASED ONLY 
SO THEY SUPPLY FEW VOICES 
YEAH YEAH YEAH JUST UH CONCATENATION OF THE NO IT'S ALREADY THERE IF YOU JUST PUT LI FESTIVAL 
IT COMES WI BECAUSE IT'S COMES WITH DIRECT LINUX SOFTWARE AND YOU KNOW IT IS OPEN SOURCE 
FESTIVAL IS OPEN 
IT'S 
YEAH CAT VOICE LIKE THERE ARE LIKE THEY THEY HAVE FEW 
YEAH NEW VOICES LIKE YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THAT THE IN VIEWS THIS UNIT SELECTION 
IT'S NOT DIPHONES YOU HAVE REALLY LARGE INVENTORY OF THE SPEECH 
UH THESE VOICES THEY'RE NOT YET RELEASED 
YEAH 
NO NO IT'S FREE THEY'LL BE RELEASING SOON I GUESS 
SO MAYBE YOU CAN JUST CHECK NO I IT'S IT'S HERE IN THE WEB THEN IT WON'T COME WITH YOUR LINUX SOFTWARE 
SO YOU HAVE IT AGAIN DOWNLOAD FROM UH THEIR WEB PAGE 
YEAH YOU CAN DOWNLOAD NOW 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
AT THE VOICES ARE CALLED MULTISYN MULTISYN UH SL UH THAT'S SOME VOICE 
SO YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FROM THE VOICE FROM THE WEB FESTIVAL 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SO VOICE IS LIKE THE DATABASE OF THE PARALLEL SPEAKER WHO SPEAKS THAT THIS TEXT SO 
IT WAS REALLY LARGE DATABASE SO AT THE V THE QUALITY WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND SIMILAR YEAH 
IT'S MORE OR LESS BUT NOT EXACTLY LIKE UH IT'S TWO TIMES OR ONE POINT FIVE TIMES OR SOMETHING 
BUT YOU CAN PRUNE LIKE HOW MUCH YOU WANT BECAUSE 
SO THIS IS AGAIN LIKE UH THAT'S KIND OF MY P. H. D. WORK HOW IN THIS SYSTEM LIKE HOW YOU CHOOSE THE NOTES AND HOW YOU CONCATENATE 
SO THERE ARE AGAIN COST FUNCTIONS AND VITERBI 
SO YOU CAN YOU CAN ALWAYS OPTIMISE YOU CAN PUT SOME THRESHOLDS AND PRUNING AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE IT REAL TIME 
SO THEN AGAIN COMPROMISE UH BETWEEN THE QUALITY AND YEAH 
BUT STILL IT'S GOOD LIKE NOW 
THE YOU CAN JUST CHECK MULTISYN AND THEN VOICES 
OH YEAH YEAH IT'S REALLY GOOD 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT ONLY SOMETIMES LIKE IT CAN'T REALLY CALL THIS YEAH 
UH STANDARD TEXT 
YEAH 
YEAH ASCII FILE IS 
ASCII AND BUT ONLY THE PROBLEM'S AGAIN ACRONYMS AND SOMETIMES IT EXPANDS SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT EXPAND BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THEIR DICTIONARY SO YEAH 
IT'S NOT IN THE DICTIONARY LIKE IF WE AGAIN IT'S PROBLEM LIKE SO 
BUT THOSE THINGS YOU CAN ADD LIKE IF YOU'RE REALLY FAMILIAR WITH FESTIVAL SO YOU CAN ADD ALWAYS THIS 
YEAH 
BUT AT LEAST THESE THINGS OKAY LIKE IT WON'T REALLY MAKE MISTAKES SO OFTEN LIKE SOMETIMES 
ALAN BLACK AND PAUL TAYLOR THEY STARTED R FESTIVAL IN NINETY SIX OR SOMETHING 
EDINBURGH C. S. T. R. YEAH 
UH OF UH UH THIS UM THIS JOHANN WATERS OR LIKE NO THEY DO WHAT THEY DID PORTLAND O. G. I. THEY DID L. P. C. BASED SYNTHESIS 
THE FESTIVAL IS ALREA ALREADY LIKE IT'S ONE FIRST YOU START WITH THE 
OH OKAY 
MM 
FROM 
I DON'T KNOW 
NO NO ACTUALLY THE B 
OH OKAY OKAY 
YEAH MAYBE BECAUSE 
AH OK 
HMM 
YEAH FIRST THEY STARTED IN C. S. T. R. WITH ALAN BLACK AND PAUL TAYLOR THEN THEN IT EXPAND TOO MANY PLACES 
BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY IS FIL NO SIMON KING IS HE'S ONE OF THE OTHERS BUT ROB CLARK IS THE MENU THAT YOU MET UM 
UH UH ALREADY 
YEAH 
IT'S 
SO ANYTHING UH MORE ABOUT LISBON OR INTERSPEECH 
I IT'S ENOUGH YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO YOU START I THINK RIGHT 
YEAH SO WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PAPERS FROM INTERSPEECH 
THIS IS NOT A GOOD QUESTION I THINK 
ALL OF THEM OF COURSE 
ALL OF THEM OF COURSE 
OH YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
OKAY 
BAD ANSWER RIGHT 
LIKE 
YEAH I IT'S NOT EVERY YEAR RIGHT 
YEAH WE MEET IN ALSO AN I. C. S. L. P. RIGHT 
THE FIRST TIME SO 
YEAH 
SO HOW HOW DID YOU LIKE THE CONFERENCE ANYWAY 
WHEN IN COMPARED TO TO THE THE OTHERS THE PREVIOUS ONE 
BUT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
OH YEAH 
HE WAS FROM AUSTRALIA RIGHT 
THE GUY YEAH 
UH HE'S VERY FAMOUS I THINK FOR THAT RIGHT 
HE'S THE THE INVENTOR OF THAT IMPLANT AND FOR FOR THE OR I THINK 
SO YEAH 
MM 
SO YOU WANT TO A BEACH 
IT A LIKE ATLANTIC SEA COAST OR YEAH 
UH-HUH 
UH IT'S NOT AS FAR FROM LISBON HALF AN HOUR MM-HMM 
UH NORTHWEST MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK LISBON THOSE DAYS ARE PRETTY GOOD LIKE SEEM TO ME QUITE NOT COLD BUT STILL OKAY LIKE REASONABLE 
OH YEAH 
YEAH I WAS HAPPY TO BE BACK IN SUISSE AFTER FEW FEW DAYS IT'S BETTER TO BE HERE I THINK 
YEAH IT'S BIG CITY MANY PEOPLE AND 
YEAH YEAH 
THIS NEW ONLY RIGHT 
NOT THE OLD ONE BUT YEAH 
YEAH 
UH IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE TO MAYBE 
SAME TIME YES BUT NOT SO MANY DAYS OR 
OH YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
CONFERENCE 
YEAH YEAH 
IT'S 
BETTER TO IT 
YEAH 
THE EASIEST WAY 
I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME 
SO IT THERE 
YEAH I IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THERE 
OH YOU'VE GOT THE S 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
LIKE 
NO I DON 
RIGHT MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO THEY OBTAIN BETTER RESULTS WITH THAT FINALLY OR 
BUT 
RIGHT 
BUT IF YOU COMPARE NO IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH SOME BASELINE LET'S SAY YOU USE JUST G. M. M. WITH DIAGONAL COVARIANCE MATRICES 
A AND NO DECORRELATION BEFORE LIKE UH 
YEAH 
OR L. D. A. IS THERE ARE 
YEAH 
BUT BUT THERE MUST BE THE SENSE RIGHT 
BECAUSE ONCE YOU DECORRELATE THE DATA THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE FULL I KNOW 
THAT'S SO THAT'S THAT MEANS THAT THE DECORRELATION IS NOT UH OPTIMAL RIGHT 
SO SO THAT'S THE REASON 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
IT IS YEAH 
UH IN THERE THERE IS NOT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY 
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR LIKE L. V. C. ASIDE IMPOSSIBLE TO USE IT RIGHT 
YOU'VE GOT DIMENSION THIRTY NINE TIMES THIRTY NINE 
YEAH 
SO YEAH 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO USE IT 
AND YOU CANNOT EVEN TRAIN IT RIGHT 
MORE OR LESS I THINK 
UH SO THAT'S INTERESTING 
MM-HMM 
MUCH LONGER 
SHORTER YEAH 
RIGHT 
WHA WHAT IS THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM 
SO IT'S NOT SO MM 
TWO POINT FIVE MILLISECONDS 
TWENTY MILLISECONDS 
FROM 
OH YEAH 
RIGHT 
SURE 
AND THE SHIFTING IS STILL THE SAME OR NOT 
O YEAH YEAH OVERLAP 
SO 
LIKE UM ON HOW MANY FRAMES PER PER SECOND YOU DO HAVE 
SO IT AGAIN LIKE UH ONE HUNDRED FRAMES OR IT'S LESS OR EVEN IF YOU KEEP VARIABLE LENGTH OF THE FRAMES RIGHT 
YOU CAN STILL KEEP THE SAME FRAME RATE 
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THIS WOULD HAVE SENSE FOR I DON'T KNOW SPEECH CODING WHERE YOU WANT TO PRESERVE UH ARE YOU WANT TO ENCODE IT INTO LESS FRAMES 
RIGHT BUT WHY DO WHY TO DO IT FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
IT MEANS THAT UH 
YEAH IN WH WHY TO KEEP VARIABL VARIABILITY IN THE LENGTH OF THE FRAMES 
WH WHY NOT TO KEEP THE SAME LENGTH WHAT IS THE 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RI RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT YES 
RIGHT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
WELL 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH PROBABLY 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
THERE IS AN INFORMATION 
HMM 
YEAH YEAH YEAH RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT 
MM MM-HMM PROBABLY 
WHO KNOWS MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE TO USE IT SOMEHOW BUT THEN THERE IS UH INFORMATION ABOUT TEMPORAL INFORMATION IS SOMEHOW INCLUDED IN SUCH YEAH 
YEAH 
THERE IS ALSO SOME UM LIKE UH NOT PAPER 
BUT I SAW THE ALGORITHM I HAVE BEEN USING EVEN THAT CALLED TEMPORAL DECOMPOSITION I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KN YOU KNOW THAT LIKE 
UH I DON'T KNOW WHO PROPOSE IT I JUST HAD IT FROM FROM BEAMBOT FOR LIKE A BEAMBOT DO YOU KNOW THE GUY 
HE'S FRENCH UM SOMEWHERE NOW IN TELECONFERENCE LIKE MM I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S WORKING BUT THE WE WERE USING IT FOR UH SPEECH CODING 
SO WE JUST HAD A SPEECH AND YOU HAD DECOMPOSE A SPEECH INTO SUCH SEGMENTS TEMPORAL SEGMENTS WHICH WERE STATIONARY INSIDE 
AND THEN YOU CAN MORE OR LESS UH QUANTISE THOSE SEGMENTS SOMEHOW AND SO IT FOR ENCODING LET'S SAY OR AND IT WORKED PRETT YEAH YEAH 
THEY WERE USING LIKE S. V. D. STUFF SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION FOR THAT AND IT WORKED PRETTY WELL LIKE I WAS SURPRISED LIKE 
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY UH HE WAS USING THAT 
YEAH 
UH WELL IT'S IT HAS BEEN USED FOR SPEECH CODING 
NOB NOBODY USE IT FOR RECOGNITION STUFF I THINK I NEVER HEARD THAT 
NO I DON'T OF COURSE 
YEAH THAT'S GOOD QUESTION 
MAYBE 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S TRUE 
THAT'S IMPORTANT 
ALL THE PAPERS 
OKAY 
I THINK PEOPLE WOULDN'T LIKE IT 
MANY PEOPLE WOULDN'T LIKE IT 
RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH YEAH SURE 
EXACTLY 
RIGHT 
AND EVERYBODY'S UH LIKE UH USING DIFFERENT TRAINING AND TESTING DATA AND THEN YOU DON'T KNOW IF LIKE 
THEY SHOW IT WORKS FOR TIMIT BUT THEN YOU TRY TO USE SOME DIFFERENT DATABASES YOU USE IT DOESN'T WORK 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN 
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH YEAH YEAH 
NIST EVALUATIONS 
YEAH BUT NOBODY YOU KNOW IT'S THIS NEW SYSTEMS ARE STILL NOT GENERAL LIKE YOU KNOW 
LIKE THIS P. L. P. AND M. F. C. C. S BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT DO IT WORKED SOMEHOW RIGHT FOR ANY KIND OF DATA 
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE COMPARING TO TO THAT IS 
ONCE SOMEBODY WILL COME WITH SOMETHING NEW OKAY UH HE'S SHOWING IT WORKS FOR SOME DATAS BUT STILL YEAH YEAH 
FIRST IT'S DIFFICULT TO TO SHOW THAT IT WORKS FOR ALL ALL THE DATES RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY NEED 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S YOUR CHOICE 
MM-HMM 
NO NO I JUST FOR 
YEAH 
I THINK SO YEAH PROBABLY MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OR I 
IT'S JUST T. T. S. RIGHT TEXT TO SPEECH 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT RIGHT 
ARE THEY 
FOR O. G. A. S 
FOR O. G. I. NUMBERS 
DIFFERENT SETUPS 
LIKE SOME PEOPLE USE THIS SETUP AND SOME PEOPLE THAT 
UH-HUH 
SO YOU JUST 
OH YEAH 
NO UH IT'S 
I DUNNO I I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THAT AND 
RIGHT YEAH YEAH 
FOR NOISE CONDITIONS YEAH IT'S PRETTY GOOD 
WELL TH THIS F RECOGNISERS ARE ARE MADE THERE ARE JUST YOU JUST USE THEM THAT'S IT 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH IT 
SHE EVEN SO IF IT WAS FORBIDDEN IN THE TIME RIGHT SO YOU HAVE RECOGNISER JUST USE IT 
DON'T PLAY WITH IT YOU JUST PLAY WITH THE FEATURES 
YEAH RIGHT EXACTLY 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
OR RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH I REMEMBER 
WITH DAVID PEARCE HE WAS 
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY 
WE ARE USING THESE RESULTS MORE OR LESS 
BUT NOT EVERYBODY GO 
NOT EVERYBODY 
MANY PEOPLE STAY SO 
YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
BUT EXACTLY 
NO 
WELL MANY PEOPLE PLACE WITH TANDEM RIGHT LIKE M. A. T. OR WHO IS USING THAT SOME INTO M. A. T. BUT SOMEBODY 
I DUNNO HYNEK TOLD TOLD US THAT SOMEBODY'S USING THAT UM VERY ACTIVELY LIKE OKAY 
IT IT WORKS FOR THEM AND AND THEY ARE CLOSE TO LIKE INDUSTRY LIKE UH YOU KNOW 
THERE IS IT'S A RESEARCH GROUP OF I KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S CASE 
SOMEBODY ELSE OR I DON'T KNOW SOMEBODY NEW UH SO BUT I THINK SOME T SOMEBODY LIKE A. T. AND A. T. AND T. OR WHAT 
OH QU YEAH 
YOU UM I DON'T KNOW HE'S EVEN IF QUALCOMM 
NO 
NOW YOU UH YEAH YEAH 
FOR RIGHT RIGHT 
NO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
MAYBE THEY ARE USING P. L. P. S AND BUT I TH I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS STILL SOME STUFF UP TO YEAH 
FOR RASTA OR WHATEVER ELSE LIKE ALL THOSE DECORRELATIONS AND TRANSFORMATIONS 
I THINK IT'S THEIR BIT MORE OR LESS IT'S AGAIN BASED ON M. F. C. C. S OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OR MAYBE TRAPS 
NO MORE OR LESS I THINK YEAH 
RIGHT 
THAT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE 
BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT SITUATION BECAUSE RIGHT 
THEY NEED THAT IT DOESN'T CREATE THAT MUCH YEAH 
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED WITH THE MACHINE AND UH I DON'T KN THE ALLOC SYSTEM IT DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT 
SOMEBODY WILL FIX IT AND CHANGE IT BUT 
SURE 
YEAH 
EVEN EVEN NOT VITERBI JUST EVEN SOMETHING SIMPLER 
YEAH 
UH I DON'T KNOW 
DO YOU THINK SO 
YEAH 
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH 
EVEN IN THE PHONE 
IN SOME NEW ONE OR 
FROM THAT C COHEN'S 
OH UH-HUH 
AND ABOUT WHICH UH PHONE TO USE 
F SAMSUNG SOMETHING 
WHERE UH SOME ABOUT SOME WHICH YOU CAN BUY RIGHT 
IT'S 
IT AND YOU CAN TURN IT LIKE ONLY YOUR SPEECH OR IT'S GENERAL UH IT'S QUITE INTERESTING YEAH 
OKAY UH-HUH 
OR YOU YOU CAN JUST BY THAT APPLICATION RIGHT 
I DON'T KNOW LIKE IT'S LIKE YOU YOU'VE GOT SOME MOBILE PHONE 
AND THEN YOU CAN BUY FROM ANOTHER COMPANY SOME SUCH APPLICATION WH YOU CAN DICTATE YOUR S. M. S. OR WHATEVER 
SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS DONE NOW BUT LIKE 
BUT HAVE YOU EVER USED LIKE DICTATION SYSTEM FOR WINDOWS 
THIS UH THERE WERE MANY OF THEM 
YEAH DRAG THE MOUSE THERE 
AND I HEARD THAT IT WORKED VERY VERY WELL 
UM 
ALRIGHT 
RIGHT NEWER SPEECH OKAY 
OKAY 
HOW TO SAY OKAY 
MM-HMM 
I THINK YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY 
IT'S BASED ON THE DIPHONES DIPHONES RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO YOU'VE GOT IT INSTALLED IN YOUR MACHINE HERE OR 
FESTIVAL RIGHT 
OKAY 
OH 
A AND HAVE YOU HAVE YOU TRIED IT 
AND 
SO YOU CAN 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND 
YEAH YEAH 
AND YOU JUST UH HAVE CHOSEN SOME TEXT 
ANY TEXT YOU JUST PUT ON AND 
OKAY 
AND IT CAN READ UH HOW DOES IT READ FROM WHICH UM FROM WHICH UH HOW TO STATE IT 
UH IS IT UH POSSIBLE TO READ P. D. F. S OR JUST STANDARD TEXT 
WHATEVER T. X. T. RIGHT FILES 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
WELL LET'S 
OH REALLY 
ANYWAY WHO IS THE THREE OF FESTIVAL 
EDINBURGH 
AND I THOUGHT IT THAT'S THE GUY FROM C. S. L. E. FROM PORTLAND WHO WAS THERE DURING F 
YEAH BUT THERE WAS 
NO NO BUT THAT THAT WAS THE GUY WHO'S ON A WHEELCHAIR NOW 
HE CANNOT M MOVE EVEN HE'S VERY IN LIKE INDIC HOW TO SAY THAT 
LIKE HE CANNOT HAVE UH JUST CAN SPEAK ONLY THROUGH SOME FESTIVAL SYSTEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
HE WAS THE THE ONE YEAH HE HE WAS WORKING I THINK ONE W O. G. I. EVEN 
HE'S VERY FAMOUS BUT I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS THE OTHER ONE 
IT WAS DEVELOPED FOR HIM LIKE HE WAS JUST FIRST TESTER I THINK OF THE SYSTEM 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
LIKE IT'S NOT TOO TEXT TO SPEECH IT'S JUST THE UH UH SYNTHESIS WHICH MEANS WHICH IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME BUT I DUNNO 
YEAH 
SO IT'S SOMEBODY AND SIMON KING IS PLAYING WITH THAT RIGHT THE T GUY 
OKAY OKAY 
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH 
IN THREE PAPERS IT'S JUST ONE PAPER AND AND FESTIVAL 
FROM LINUX IT'S VERY IM INTERESTING 
YEAH 
YEAH STILL DOESN'T FEEL NATURAL 
I I WISH YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE ROOM WOULD JUST DETECT WHEN IN WHEN A MEETING'S STARTED TO STARTING 
VOILA COOL 
SO YOU BETTER START 
IT WAS YOUR IDEA 
SO 
WELL MAYBE UH IS IS THE WHITE BOARD WORKING 
OR OR NOT 
UM YOU MAYBE SHOW US THE GENERAL SORT OF OUTLINE 
YOU KEEP W OKAY YOU CAN JUST WRITE IT IN THE PAPER 
YEAH 
SO SO THESE DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL P. L. P. TWO STUFF THEN IS THAT 
UH 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU STARTED WITH WASN'T IT 
THIS THIS STUFF THAT MARIUS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
UH HE'S PARAMETERIZING IT BOTH TEMPORALLY AND ACROSS THE SPECTRUM YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP OKAY 
YEP 
YEAH IT THAT 
YEP YEP YEP 
MM YEAH BUT IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A DIFFERENT LINEAR PREDICTION MODEL ISN'T IT 
IT'S A COMPLEX LINEAR PREDICTION OR WHATEVER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YOU NEED THE PHASE 
UH UH 
WELL 
WELL IT DEPENDS ON HOW THIS I I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING B YEAH JUST THE CARRIER 
OKAY SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY PHASE BUT IF YOU'RE USING SOME SORT OF SINUSOIDAL CODING IT'S PHASE YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WE 
WHAT IS WHAT SORT OF BIT RATE DO YOU GET FOR THE UM ENCODING OF THE THIS THE HILBERT TRANSFORM 
THE USE THE SPECTROGRAM 
W WHAT SORT OF CODING DO YOU GET SO FOR FOR THE NO NO NO NO F F YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEP 
UH W WELL IT'S NO NO NO BUT WHAT SORT OF BIT RATE DO YOU GET 
SO IT IS IT UH D DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF UM IDEA OF WHAT SORT OF BAND WIDTHS 
YEAH 
'CAUSE 
OKAY AND THAT'S NO THAT'S WITH THE FULLY OPTIMISED SORT OF COMPRESSION SCHEME OR THAT'S JUST THE RAW DATA OR 
OKAY YEAH 
YEAH 
SURE SURE 
YOU JUST CUT OUT M BANDS AND JUST USE INTERPOLATION OR WHATEVER 
YEAH 
IT SO THAT'S ONE POINT OKAY THAT'S WITH THE FULL SPECTRUM BASICALLY BEING USED THEN 
YEAH 
YEP YEP 
YEP 
YEP 
YEAH YEP 
OKAY THAT'S QUITE GOOD 
SO AND HYNEK WAS SHOWING ME HOW SCALABLE IT IS IN TERMS OF UM YOU CAN TAKE HALF THE BANDS AWAY AND STILL GET DECENT PERFORMANCE 
YOU TAKE YOU TAKE THREE QUARTERS OF THEM AWAY IT STARTS TO DEGRADE BUT IT'S STILL INTELLIGIBLE THAT SORT OF THING 
YEP 
OKAY 
AND THAT'S WITHOUT DOING ANY SORT OF UM PRODUCTION OF WHAT THE MISSING BANDS MIGHT BE RIGHT 
YOU JUST LEAVE THEM OUT 
I MEAN YOU YOU SHOU YOU COULD BE ABLE TO DO SOME SORT OF CODE MISSING DATA SORT OF BAYES STUFF YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
IT IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A SCALABLE SCHEME THOUGH WOULDN'T IT 
LIKE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A NICE SCALABLE SCHEME FOR THE FOR FOR THE THE CODING OF THE THE SMOOTH SPECTRUM 
IT'D BE NICE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF SCALABLE CODING SCHEME FOR THE FOR THE VOICE SIGNAL AS WELL RIGHT 
WELL I DON'T KNOW I'M JUST 
WELL IT DIFFERENT BIT RATES 
SO THE ACTUAL UH EXCITATION AS WELL 
BECAUSE I MEAN IT'D BE NICE UH L LET'S SAY IF YOU HAD TWELVE HUNDRED BITS FOR THE FOR THE SP SMOOTH SPECTRUM AND TWELVE HUNDRED BITS FOR THE VOICE 
AND THEN YOU COULD SCALE THEM BOTH 
YEAH 
SURE SURE SURE 
YEAH 
OH 
NO NO 
JUST LONG AS IT'S SOME SORT OF NON LINEAR 
YEP 
UM 
THE PLACE MORE EMPHASIS ON THE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
HMM 
AND THEN VECTOR QUANTIZE OR WHATEVER 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO TIMES FIFTEEN 
TWEN THAT'S IT IT'S TWENTY TIMES FIFTEEN IT'S NOT 
OKAY 
SO IT'S IT'S YEAH IT'S THREE HUNDRED 
IT I MEAN IT'S IT'S TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED SORT OF PARAMETERS PER SECOND 
UM 
WELL Y YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT CARRYING TRANSMITTING THAT AT ALL REALLY AT THIS POINT IN TIME 
I UH 
AND AND YOU GET WHISPERING TYPE SYNTHESIS YEAH 
YEP 
OR ONE OF THESE GLOTTAL PULSE THINGS 
IF AND JUST USE BASIC L. P. C. TEN STYLE 
YEAH WHICH IS WHICH IS PROBABLY I MEAN 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO AIM FOR LIKE A VERY LOW RATE CODE TO BELOW FIVE HUNDRED BITS PER SECOND I GUESS 
THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY FINE 
BUT 
UH THE LOWEST STANDARD IS MELP I THINK WHICH IS TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED THE STANDARD 
IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT TWELVE HUNDRED F BITS PER SECOND USING MORE MORE COMPLICATED QUANTIZATION SCHEMES AND STUFF LIKE THAT I THINK 
I THINK SO YEAH 
I SEE I SAW THAT THEY USED MATRIX QUANTISATION ON THE L. P. UH IN THE L. S. F. PARAMETERS OR WHATEVER 
BUT I MEAN THAT'S QUITE IT BECOMES QUITE COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE 
BUT I MEAN I IMAGINE THE SAME SORT OF APPROACH COULD BE TAKEN WITH YOURS AS WELL 
NO 
YEAH THAT'S THE SAME 
TWENTY MELP*'S A LOT BETTER QUALITY THOUGH 
YEAH 
NO NO 
I THINK I THINK I THINK I THINK CELP OR CELP OR HOWEVER YOU PRONOUNCE THAT 
IT'S ABOUT FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED I THINK 
YEAH 
ARE BASED AROUND THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
IT'S NOT TERRIBLY INTERESTING THOUGH REALLY 
YEAH 
SO I'M 
WELL YOU YOU'VE WELL I MEAN YOU'VE GOT A BUNCH OF OPTIONS HAVEN'T YOU 
YOU CAN SEE LIKE UH A CODEC SIDED OR YOU COULD USE A 
SINUSOIDAL BASED 
NO 
YEAH YEAH 
SURE SURE SURE 
YEAH BUT WHAT'S MORE INTERESTING 
I I MEAN 'CAUSE C I I I SUSPECT THERE SOMETHINGS LIKE UM CELP 
YOU'RE GONNA GET UH LOT HIGHER BAND WIDTH AREN'T YOU 
I MEAN IT'S A HIGH BAND WIDTH STANDARD 
SO YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
HMM 
OKAY 
SO I MEAN 
HOW 
YEP 
YEAH 
'CAUSE IT'S A BIT TRICKY ISN'T IT 
THAT'S IT'S NOT LIKE A STANDARD I'M JUST THINKING I MEAN WHAT SORT OF OPT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN'T JUST DO STANDARD UM 
YOU KNOW INVERSE FILTERING FOR ME SIGNAL RECONSTRUCTION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT CAN YOU 
OH OH OKAY AND THEN YOU JUST THEN YOU JUST DO THE INVERSE F. F. T. OR WHATEVER 
OKAY TH TH I MEAN THE OTHER O 
MM YEAH 
BUT THAT'S GONNA BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HAVING PHASE PROBLEMS IS THAT WHEN YOU 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
HMM 
AND NOW I MEAN THERE IS THERE ARE UM MM THERE IS RESEARCH UH UM PU THAT'S BEEN PUBLISHED SHOWING 
YOU KNOW SPEECH RECONSTRUCTION FROM THE ESSENTIALLY THE SPECTROGRAM WITHOUT PHASE INFORMATION 
YEAH 
SO 
YES 
YES BUT I MEAN YOU CAN RECONSTRUCT THE THE OF THE THE THE ENTIRE 
SPECTROGRAM FROM THAT CAN'T YOU 
SO YOU COULD DO IT THAT WAY 
CAUSE I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S A HEAPS OF THERE HEAPS OF OPTIONS 
LIKE IF YOU YOU BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS SINUSOIDAL CODING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
ALL YOU NEED IS THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SPECTROGRAM IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDES AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU 
JUST BY REFITTING 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
DO IT'S THE 
YEAH 
BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE BIG THING AT THE MOMENT ISN'T IT 
IF IF YOU'RE MM IF I IF THE OF THE EXCI IF THE OF THE ENCODING RATE'S TWO KILO BITS PER SECOND FOR THE THE EXCITATION COMPONENT OF THE SIGNAL 
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW EFFICIENT YOUR UM ENCODING OF THE SPECTROGRAM IS YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA HAVE A HIGH RELATIVELY HIGH BIT RATE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
WELL ONE COULD ARGUE IT'S IT'S A FIELD THAT'S QUITE A SORT OF A NICHE THESE DAYS ISN'T IT 
UM 
NO STANDARDS AND YEAH 
MM YEAH 
WELL DID YOU SAY UH WHO SAID 
YEAH 
SO IT NOKIA'S BEING USED IN THE U. S. FOR THEIR TRI BAND USAGE 'CAUSE YOU KNOW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
OH NO NO G G. S. M. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE G. S. M. IN THE U. S. 
OR I DIDN'T HAVE G. S. M. IN THE U. S. 
UH IT'S F OH OKAY 
NO NO NO 
UH WELL THAT'S TRI BAND IS YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEP 
AND APPARENTLY NOKIA'S IN A BIT OF TROUBLE OVER THAT ONE BUT YEAH 
WELL IT'S INTERESTING 
YEAH 
SHOULD'VE BEEN A LAWYER 
WELL THAT'S 
BUT I MEAN CODING IS A MUCH MORE SORT OF IT'S IT'S TOO WELL I MEAN IT'S IT'S UH IT WHEN IT BOILS DOWN TO JUST MATHEMATICS TO A LARGE EXTENT 
DOESN'T IT 
IT'S IT'S JUST UH SORT OF IT'S YOU KNOW COMMUNICATIONS S SORT OF ONE 
YEAH 
SURE SURE 
YEAH 
SURE SURE 
PUSH TO TALK AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
YEP 
AND I MEAN SO YOU SAY I MEAN THAT DELAY IS I MEAN YOU CAN SQUASH THAT DELAY TO SOME EXTENT RIGHT 
I NO I THINK SO FAR AS THE C YOU KNOW C C DELILAH'S CODING GOES 
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PROBABLY DO MUCH MORE THAN WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED 
BECAUSE TO GET HIGHER COMPRESSION YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW TAKE ADVANTAGE OF REDUNDANCY OVER LONGER TIME SPANS 
SO 
YEAH SURE BUT I MEAN THAT'S TRANSMISSION DELAY NOT ALGORITHMIC DELAY 
IF YOU DID THIS TOGETHER YOU END UP WITH A THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO I GUESS 
WE MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE ELSE JOINING OUR UH MEETING SOON 
OH YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW I MEAN UH YOU'D BE YOU TRIED SINUSOIDAL CODING BASED APPROACHES DIDN'T YOU 
SINUSOIDAL CODING 
YEAH BUT SURE 
YEAH UM YEAH TRUE YEAH IT'S A YEAH 
BUT I MEAN THE THE THE THE THING SO YOU'D NEED TO IT PART OF THE PARAMETER SET FOR THAT IS UH THE UM UH THE F UH THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDES 
AND THEN ONE WAY OF COMPRESSING THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDES IS JUST STORING THE SMOOTH SPECTRUM 
AND THEN YOU CAN UH AND THEN YOU CAN INTERPOLATE YEAH 
YOU CAN JUST PICK THE THE UM THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDES ON THAT SPECTRUM WHEN YOU RECONSTRUCT ON THAT SMOOTH VERSION OF THE SPECTRUM WHEN YOU RECONSTRUCT 
Y YEAH 
WELL I WAS JUST SAYING 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH WELL I I TH IT'S HIGH 
IT'S QUITE A HIGH BIT RATE 
BUT I MEAN ONCE WE IT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S SCALABLE 
WELL IT I MEAN YOU CAN USE AS MANY HARMONICS AS YOU WANT 
I AM HE HE HE WAS JUST USING THE FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY 
AND IF YOU SMOOTH IT DOING A SMOOTH SPECTRUM REPRESENTATION OF THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDES 
THEN YOU ONLY NEED TO STORE THE THE THE FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY AND AND THE AND THE MAXIMUM VOICE FREQUENCY 
AND EVERYTHING ELSE CAN BE YEAH SO YEAH SURE 
SO AND THEN BUT THEN THE TRICKY THE ONLY TRICKY THING THAT WE HADN'T FIGURED IT WAS THE PHASE INFORMATION 
UM BUT YOU ABOUT UH YOU CAN STILL GOT A LIKE YOU GET THE UM BASICALLY IF YOU DO PHASE UNWRAPPING AND ALL OF THESE OTHER TRICKS 
YOU END UP WITH SOME SORT OF PHASE REPRESENTATION WHICH IS SOME SORT OF MONOTONICALLY DECREASING FUNCTION 
YEAH UNWRAPPED YEAH 
SO I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD CONCEIVABLY REPRESENT IN SOME SORT OF LOW SORT OF OR YOU KNOW LOW BIT RATE REPRESENTATION I GUESS 
AND THEN MAYBE YOU'D NEED SOME SORT OF CORRECTION TO ME TO CORRECT MINOR PHASE DISCONTINUITIES AT SOME POINT IN TIME 
'CAU 
YEAH YEAH SURE 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SURE SURE 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH YEAH 
HMM 
ONE AND YOU UH YOU WANNA AVOID HARD CHOICES ON VOICING DECISION YEAH 
WELL THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH L. P. C. TEN FOR INSTANCE 
I IT STINKS BECAUSE THIS HARD YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEP 
BUT BUT THAT THAT TWO HUNDRED THIS IS WHAT THEY USE FOR LIKE UM ST THEY THEY DO IS THIS FOR ME FOR UM PITCH MARKING IN SPEECH 
SO THIS IS WHAT ALAN BLACK'S CODE USES 
BUT IT'S VERY SPEAKER DEPENDENT WH ON WHAT SORT OF BAND WIDTH YOU'D LOOK AT THIS HILBERT ENVELOPE 
DEPENDING ON THE PITCH DEPENDING ON THE PERSON Y YOU'LL GET A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF SOMETHING AND A CERTAIN SORT OF SO I MEAN 
YOU KNOW IF IT'S A FEMALE SPEAKER FOR INSTANCE YOU YEAH 
SO IT'S SORTA TRICKY 
YEAH 
OH NO NO 
Y YEAH BUT FROM MEMORY THAT THAT BASIC SCRIPT THAT THEY HAD WASN'T WASN'T VERY UM EFFECTIVE 
I MEAN MAYBE IF YOU ADD SOME SORT OF INITIAL FIRST P GUESS AND THEN AND THEN CHOSE YOUR SMOOTHING FACTOR BASED ON THAT 
'CAUSE IT TO YOU KNOW SELECTING AT ANY PARTICULAR POINT OF WHAT THE WHAT THE PITCH IS TO THE MAY BE INACCURATE 
BUT IF YOU ESTIMATED IT OVER A SECOND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET A DECENT ESTIMATE I'D I'D THINK 
YEAH 
WELL IT'D BE NICE TO IT WOULD BE NICE TO REALLY SEE WHAT THIS WHAT YOU'RE A ACTUALLY TRYING TO RECONSTRUCT HERE 
THIS CARRIER SIGNAL WHAT WHAT IT REALLY LIKES L YEAH 
AND YOU DID SAY IT LOOKS LIKE A FREQUENCY MODULATED COSINE 
HMM 
YEAH 
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE 'CAUSE PITCH SHIFTS YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
YEAH IT'S LIKE A YEAH 
AND IT IT DOES START TO GET A LITTLE BIT N NON LINEAR TOWARDS THE END 
BUT NORMALLY THAT'S THAT'S WHEN THE COMPONENTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY PROBABLY GONNA BE AUDIBLE ANYWAY IN VOICED SPEECH RIGHT 
SO YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
C 'CAUSE ANY SORT OF ERROR IN THAT IN THAT LINE IS IS TRANSMITTED IS REALISED IN A NOT AS A PHASE ERROR RIGHT 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
MM YEAH 
TRICKY YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
Y Y Y YOU HAVE S FIVE SLICES LIKE AN ACROSS THAT WAY I GUESS 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE 'CAUSE IT'S A TIME DOMAIN SORT OF APPROACH 
UM AND I MEAN UH AND AND IN IN FACT I MEAN IT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS IS DIFFERENT AT MOST APPROACHES TO SPEECH CODING THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT OUR HAVEN'T HAD MUCH I IT'S I MEAN IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT TO A LOT OF THE TRADITIONAL SORT UH SO UH V UM YOU KNOW 
SOURCE FILTER TYPE APPROACHES OR OR WHATEVER YEAH 
SO 
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF MINIMUM DISTORTION TIME 
YEAH 
SURE 
UNVOICED UNVOICED SPEECH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BE SORT OF JUDGE ON QUALITY COMPARED TO VOICED I THINK 
PLOSIVES 
YEAH PLOSIVES ARE VERY IMPORTANT THOUGH I GUESS 
SO MAYBE IT DOES A BETTER JOB OF PLOSIVES 
OKAY 
IT'D BE NICE IF WE HAD SOME DEMOS HERE 
WELL I SUPPOSE HAVE TO WAIT AT YOUR I GUESS 
UH IT'S A LITTLE W UH BIGGER 
I WON'T BE YEAH 
NO 
YOU'LL PRACTICE IT BEFORE THEN WON'T YOU 
YEAH HE'S GOING TO OZ 
YEP 
I DID YEAH 
BUT WE'RE D WE'RE DOING A MORE TRADITIONAL S S FREQUENCY SLICES RATHER THAN TEMPORAL BASED STUFF 
YEAH 
WELL THAT'S W THAT WAS ONE OF THE APPROACHES SURE 
YEP 
AND THE OTHER APPROACH WAS WAS THIS H. M. M. BASED STUFF WHICH IS WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST A PARAMETERIZATION OF THE YOU KNOW 
THE THE THE THE UM THE SOURCE FILTER TYPE PARAMETERS AND THEN AND THEN LEARNING THE YOU KNOW TRAINING LIKE A UH SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
BUT THAT'S NOT TERRIBLY THAT'S GOT NO RELATIONSHIP TO THIS 
I IT'S YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
SPEECH CODING 
I I READ SOME OF THE OTHER TECHNIQUES 
UM LITTLE STANDARDS 
BUT UM I MEAN I THINK I THINK YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT TRACK WITH THE ANALYSIS BY SYNTHESIS BUT THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW WHAT SORT OF BIT RATES YOU'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR UM AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DO IT SEPARATELY FOR EACH UM BAND 
IT WOULD BE THE I IMAGINE THAT'S THE TRICKY PART 
UM BECAUSE IT WOULD BE VARYING QUITE RAPIDLY WOULDN'T IT YOUR UM YOUR UH CODE BOOK 
LIKE W WITHIN EACH UM WHEN YOU GO ALONG THE THE THE B THE ONE SECOND SORT OF SEGMENT OF THE BAND YOU 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I MEAN YEAH 
FIRST YOU'VE GOTTA CHOOSE YOUR APPROACH AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE BAND WIDTH 
AND THEN START THINKING ABOUT HOW TO GIVEN 'CAUSE I MEAN I GUESS ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE THIS IS A THIS IS A MORE OF A COMMERCIAL BASED PROJECT 
YOU'VE G C YOU'VE YOU'VE GOTTA I MATCH THE QUALITY BEFORE YOU START WORRYING ABOUT OTHER THINGS RIGHT 
I MEAN D D DO THEY I MEAN WHAT WHAT WHAT SORT OF UH 
UH-HUH OKAY 
WELL THAT MAKES THINGS UH 
WITH 
THEY'RE HAPPY 
OKAY 
COOL 
YEAH 
SURE SURE 
AND AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE TO SORT OF A POINT WHERE MAYBE YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE A LITTLE BIT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UH WHICH IS NOT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AL ALTHOUGH THE STANDARDS DEPENDING ON WHAT STANDARD YOU'RE DEALING WITH SOMETIMES IT CAN BE QUITE AMBIGUOUS RIGHT 
I MEAN ALL THE M. PEG STANDARDS ARE BASICALLY THIS IS THE CONTAINER WE DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT RIGHT 
BUT IT'S GOTTA FIT INSIDE THIS THIS SORT OF THESE SORT OF FORMAT 
OKAY 
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE V AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DO M. A. S. UM TESTING AND 
OKAY 
WELL UH IT 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
WELL I TH 
NO NO NO 
OH NO NO NO 
YEP 
WELL THE THE WHAT'S WHAT'S NEW IS IN THE TRANSMISSION MEDIUM 
LIKE YOU KNOW NOW LIKE HIGHER BAND WIDTH TRANSMISSION OR UH OR LIKE PACKET PACKETIZED BASED TRANSMISSION 
AND THEN ALL THE THAT SORT OF THING 
THE WHERE THE WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT AS MUCH LOOKING AT THE ALGORITHM 
BUT AS MUCH IS HOW TO INCORPORATE THE ALGORITHM WITHIN A NEW TRANSI MISSION SORT OF S MEDIUM 
BASICALLY IS LIKE I MEAN IF YOU DO IF YOU USE A LOT OF APPEARS IN LIKE UM IN UH VOICE OVER I. P. OR WHATEVER 
THE THE PUBLICATIONS ARE SORT OF LIKE UM HOW DO WE DEAL WITH PACKET LOSS 
OR OR HOW WAS IT AFFECTED BY PACKET LOSS AND AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH 
AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE CODE AND ALL THAT SORTA STUFF 
YEAH 
BUT EVEN THAT'S LESS OF A BIG DEAL NOW RIGHT BECAUSE ALL THE LITTLE UM A. S YEAH 
NOT REALLY 
YOU COULD TROW MATLAB ON A MOBILE PHONE THESE DAYS 
WELL MAYBE NOT BUT 
YEAH 
Y YEAH 
YEAH WHICH DAVID DID YEAH 
IT'S GOOD YEAH 
YEAH WE'VE GOT ALL HIS CODE IMPLEMENTED 
SO UH IT WASN'T PERFECT 
THERE WAS LITTLE BIT OF BUGS WITH SOME OF THE MATCHING 
BUT IT WAS PRETTY HARD TO TELL THAT IT WAS UM NOT NOT PERFECT UNLESS YOU HEARD THE SAMPLES SORT OF NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER 
SO THAT'S NOT TOO BAD 
OH SURE 
AND I MEAN IT 
WELL THE 
THE ONLY TRICK IS THE PHASE 
AND WE'VE GOT A STUDENT STARTING IN JANUARY WHO'S GONNA START WORKING ON ON HOW TO ACTUALLY EFFICIENTLY PARAMETERIZE THE UM THE H. M. M. YEAH YEAH 
AND I THINK I THINK WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF IDEAS FOR THE THE SPECTRUM 
THAT'S EASILY ENOUGH HANDLED JUST USING STANDARD TECHNIQUES 
BUT THE 
WITHOUT PHASE 
I'VE GOT AN IDEA 
UH YOU REVIEWED A PAPER ON A 
UH STEVEN COX ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA 
IT'S NEAR C SORT OF IT'S IT'S NEAR THE SORTA CAMBRIDGE SIDE OF ENGLAND I GUESS 
IN THE MUCH MORE MATHEMATICAL I THINK 
YEAH JUST BASICALLY DOING A SEARCH THROUGH OUR OUR STUFF STUFF LIKE THAT DON'T THEY 
OR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH YEAH 
SURE 
WHERE YOU'VE ONLY GOT THE M. F. C. C. S 
BUT TH I THINK I THINK TH I THINK IT WAS IT WAS IT TO DO WITH AURORA OR SOMETHING 
THE OKAY 
I WAS 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT IT W IT WAS FOR SAY UM SAY YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE WHO HAS YOU KNOW 
THEY WANNA DISPUTE THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY ACTUALLY USED BY THE RECOGNITION 
AND THE RECOGNITION NETWORK WAS WRONG AND YOU OWE ME MONEY OR WHATEVER 
UM AND THEN THEY CAN SAY WELL WE'VE WE'VE RECONSTRUCTED YOUR SPEECH FROM THE SPEECH RECOGNI INPUT TO THE SPEECH RECOGNIZER 
HEY VOILA IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU UH UH I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT THEN THAT 
THERE'S A LOT OF SORT OF WELL DOES THE QUALITY STAND UP TO LEGAL SORT OF REQUIREMENTS OR WHATEVER 
BUT UM 
UH IN THAT THERE'S A SEPARATE SET OF STANDARDS I THINK FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
Y YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEP 
WHICH UH I THINK REQUIRES YOU KNOW THAT STATES THE ON THE INFORMATION THEY CAN SEND US THIS 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU TICK IN ANY EXTRA PHASE INFORMATION OR WHATEVER 
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHAT YOU'RE GIVEN 
SO 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
I I IT WOULD BE INTERESTING 
YOU I MEAN MAYBE THAT'S THE BEST APPROACH IT LIKE TO TO BEGIN WITH IS JUST PRETEND ALL YOU HAVE GOT SO 
YEAH 
UM BECAUSE YOU CAN ALSO INTERPOLATE THE PITCH INFORMATION FROM THE THE SPECTRUM AS WELL 
THEY DO THAT 
YEAH 
SO I MEAN MAYBE TRY TO SEE HOW GOOD YOU CAN GO WITHOUT TRANSMITTING ANY OF THAT INFORMATION 
THE PITCH WAS REALLY GOOD I THOUGHT 
I TH DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD REALLY TELL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT BUT THE THING IS IF IT'S MEL SCALED IF YOU HAVE A MEL SCALE 
YOU GET QUITE FINE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SPECTRUM AT THE LOWER FREQUENCIES IT WHICH IS WHAT YOU NEED FOR RECONSTRUCTION OF THE PITCH ANYWAY 
SO I MEAN IF YOU WANTED TO TRANSMIT WITH FEWER BANDS YOU'D MAYBE STILL KEEP THE LOWER BANDS OR OR MAYBE YOU COULD STILL TRANSMIT THE PITCH 
THE PITCH ISN'T THAT BIG A DIAL 
BUT IT'D BE NICE IF YOU DIDN'T BECAUSE THEN I MEAN THAT'S WELL 
I MEAN IT'S WORTH GIVING IT A G AND THEN MEN MAYBE SEEING WH WHAT INFORMATION YOU CAN ADD TO THE DATA STREAM TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE 
UM 
I DON'T KNOW 
THAT THAT'D BE COOL 
SO GET CODING 
MM I THINK WE 
UH WELL I MEAN HUFFMAN'S EASY ENOUGH 
BUT BUT YEAH SURE 
UH THAT THAT'S WHERE I STOP 
RUN LENGTH ENCODING I'M OUT OF HERE 
OKAY 
I MEAN I I TH I THINK THEY DO TRY TO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE THE THE TECHNIQUES THEY THEY CHOSE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LESS 
YOU KNOW SUSCEPTIBLE TO CODING ERRORS LET'S SAY 
YOU KNOW I BUT I MEAN THAT'S MAYBE THE THE LIMIT TO THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH AT LEAST ONE PAPER 
YEAH 
YEAH AT LEAST YOU CAN WRITE ON THE P 
YEAH CELP 
YEAH 
HMM 
NO BUT MARIUS IS IT'S SIMILAR STUFF 
NO MARIUS IS ALSO USING LIKE HILBERT TRANSFORM AND THEN 
BOTH 
YEAH 
UH S SOME KIND OF D. C. T. OR AGAIN YEAH 
YEAH OK 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
HOW C 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BECAUSE USE LINEAR PHASE OR 
YEAH UH UH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SAME FREQUENCY 
YEAH 
FOR L. S. F. 
MAIN BIT RATE 
WHAT IS 
OH 
OH OKAY 
HMM 
HMM 
SO 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
HMM 
OH YEAH TYPE 
HMM 
SO 
HMM 
SO SO 
OH OKAY 
SMOOTHED 
OR LIKE APPLY MORE 
HMM 
OH 
HMM 
SO AFTER YOU'RE DOING L. S. F. S S OR LIKE I MEAN HOW YOU'RE FINALLY HAND CODING 
OH 
OH 
YEAH 
SO FIRST YOU APPLY THESE TRIANGLE FILTERS AND THEN D L. P. C. CODING OR LIKE 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
FILTERS 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
HMM 
YOU CAN DO THE L. P. ANALYSIS ON EACH SUB BAND YEAH 
YEAH UM YEAH OK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO HOW MANY L. S. F. S YOU'RE USING AND 
OH OKAY 
SO BUT YOU HOW MANY BANDS YOU'RE USING 
IF YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT SKIPPING ANY BANDS OR LIKE OH OK FIFTEEN INTO TWENTY THEN 
LIKE UH 
HMM 
OH 
OH YEAH 
BUT PHASE YOU'RE NOT ENCODING ANYTHING 
PHASE YOU'RE DIRECTLY TRANSMITTING THAT 
UH IN THE YEAH YEAH YEAH 
THE PHASE OF HILBERT ENVELOPE 
YOU'RE NOT TRANSMITTING AT ALL LIKE 
YEAH YEAH SO ONES 
FOURIER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WHAT IS THE CELP STANDARD NOW 
LIKE IT'S IT'S TWO KILO BITS PER SECOND 
OR THE 
UH THAT TWO TWO KILO BITS PER IT 
AH OK 
OH 
SOME 
YEAH YEAH 
BUT 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
BUT THIS IS CODEC CENTRED ONE 
YOU HAVE CODE BOOK 
SO 
UH IT'S NOT CODECS CODE BOOK 
THERE IS NOT CODE BOOK 
AH OK 
OH 
YEAH CELP IS 
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S AROUND ONE KILO BYTE LIKE 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S A I THINK EVEN G. S. M. AND ALL THESE G. SEVEN TWO NINE 
YEAH YEAH 
NO BASED ON CELP 
AT LEAST IT GIVES 
BUT STILL THEY USE A CODE BOOK NO 
SO THAT'S REALLY UH IT'S MAYBE BETTER THAN LIKE USING JUST RANDOM NOISE OR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HUH 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
HMM 
BUT 
HMM 
INVERSE YEAH 
INVERSE HILBERT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OR OUTPUT SIGNAL LIKE 
YEAH 
AND THEN YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
HMM 
AH OK 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
BUT YEAH BUT IT'S MORE TOWARDS INDUSTRY NO 
LIKE THE YEAH BECAUSE I WORKED ON A INDUSTRY FOR LIKE A SMALL TIME 
BUT THEY'RE THEY USED TO IMPLEMENT ALL THESE CODERS G. S. M. AND A. T. U. STANDARDS 
NO JUST BEFORE MY P. H. D. 
FOR LIKE FEW MONTHS 
YEAH BUT THAT'S UH LIKE INDUSTRY IT'S REALLY A BIG DEAL LIKE 
SO THEY THEY THEY WORK ON A LOT OF THESE STANDARDS 
YEAH 
BUT MOSTLY THEY'RE ALL BASED ON CELP LIKE MAINLY 
YEAH 
SO 
HOW 
TRI BAND IS G. S. M. 
C. D. M. A. 
NO NO BUT C. D. M. IS THERE BUT NOW SLOWLY THEY'RE INTRODUCING G. S. M. ALSO NEW ONE A. S. LIKE 
YEAH G. S. M. TRI BAND 
LIKE THE FREQUENCIES ARE DIFFERENT LIKE VERY UH 
OH 
YEAH 
NOW IT'S REALLY BIG COMPETITION 
YEAH 
STANDARD MAYBE LIKE ESTABLISHED 
YEAH 
SO WHERE DO YOU THINK YOUR THING IS USEFUL 
NO C. D. M. A. OR G. S. M. 
I THINK MAYBE IN C. D. M. A. IT MAY BE M C. D. M. A. IS MORE LIKE 
MORE TIME DOMAIN 
TH THEY THEY ARE C DOING ONLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT YOU KNOW REALLY THI THIS LONG LINE TELEPHONES THEY ALREADY HAVE DELAY NO 
AT LEAST HALF A SECOND OR YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT MOBILE M 
AND THIS ONE IS 
UH HARMONICS AND THE 
YEAH 
AND THEN PICKING YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT MAYBE THE BIT RATE IS THE PROBLEM NO 
LIKE WHAT DAVID WAS DOING 
LIKE IT'S REALLY UH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN JUST SEE HOW MANY HOW MANY HARMONICS 
HE WAS USING TWENTY I THINK 
LIKE YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN TRY TO REDUCE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THE F 
AND THEN ALL THIS AMPLITUDE 
OH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
EACH AGAIN 
SOME KIND OF LINEAR YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SOME FUNCTION OR LIKE A 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
THE SIZE OF THE 
BUT YOU DON'T DO ANY VOICE UN VOICE DECISION ON 
YEAH THA THAT'S EVEN ADVANTAGE I THINK FOR THIS APPROACH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SORTA THE MODELLING IT'S REALLY ANOTHER ISSUE LIKE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO COMBINE ALL THIS HARMONIC MODEL AND NOISE MODEL 
SO AGAIN YOU MAY END UP SOME 
'CAUSE 
OH OKAY 
THE PE PEAK UH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S A YOU HAVE TO TUNE LOT OF PARAMETERS LIKE I UM 
BUT ANYWAY YOU DON'T REALLY NEED HARD DECISIONS ON 
LIKE VOICED UNVOICED 
SO UM MAYBE IT MAY HELP YOU ABOUT IT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT DO YOU REALLY REALLY NEED TO OR LIKE VOICED UNVOICED 
YEAH BUT YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY YOU NEED TO YOU DON'T NEED TO SPECIFY AT EACH POINT IT'S VOICED OR YEAH 
HUH 
YEAH 
AND THEN AMPLITUDE 
BUT YOU'RE TELLING EVEN FREQUENCY'S ALSO SHIFTING NO 
LIKE YOUR DELAY 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THEN YEAH THEN IT'S NOT EXACTLY AMPLITUDE MODULATIONS OR IT'S IT'S IN BETWEEN MAYBE 
YEAH 
SO YEAH 
SO YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S WHAT MARIUS DID IN LIKE 
BUT BUT HE WAS KEEPING ALL THE PHASE INFORMATION 
NO BUT EVEN THE HIS CODED LIKE UH JUST UH HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING UH JUST TRANSFERRED TO THAT WAY 
HE WAS AIMING FOR HE'S NOT REALLY KIND OF DOING SPEECH CODING BUT UH WANT TO DO IT ON MUSIC 
SO HE DOESN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE BAND WIDTHS OR UH WANT TO HAVE THE QUALITY IN LIKE 
YEAH BUT EVEN ESPECIALLY THE AUDIO SERIES AND THE THAT THAT'S WHAT HE WAS TELLING LIKE 
YEAH AT LEAST EVEN TEN K. BIT 
TWENTY KILO BITS ALSO SO OKAY 
SO BUT HE'S UH HE'S NOT I THINK FINISHED WITH ALL THAT THING 
HE'S JUST TRANSMITTING ALL THE PHASE AND THEN BUT HE'S ENCODING THE ENVELOPE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THEN LEAVING THE PHASE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH OR 
AUTO CORRELATION COEFFICIENT AND 
YEAH THEY AGAIN GIVE THE PHASE 
YEAH AGAIN GIVE THE PHASE 
YEAH 
OH 
HMM 
BUT THIS PHASE IS DIFFERENT FROM YOUR CARRIER NO 
LIKE YEAH 
BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST DOING AN UH YOUR UH YEAH 
AND ALSO LIKE YEAH 
AND 
YEAH 
HMM 
BUT EVEN YOU CAN USE AS A CAN YOU SEE THAT PHASE DIRECTLY 
WHEREAS THE IDEA YEAH THIS ONE IS DIRECT 
BUT THIS IS PHASE OF YOUR D UH SPECTRUM NO 
LIKE IT'S NOT IN TIME DOMAIN 
SO 
IF YOUR SIGNAL 
IT'S NOT SO THEN IT'S BIT TRICKY 
LIKE HOW 
OKAY BUT STILL YOU GET ONLY THE THE MAGNITUDE OF YOUR HILBERT ENVELOPE 
YOU WON'T GET THE 
NO BUT YOU STARTED WITH HIL HILBERT ENVELOPE NO 
LIKE MAGNITUDE OF HILBERT ENVELOPE 
MAGNITUDE OF UH ONE BEFORE D. C. T. YOUR D UH 
YEAH 
AH OK SO INPUT TO THE D. C. T. IS THE SPEECH OR LIKE YOUR YEAH OKAY 
JUST YOU'RE STARTING WITH 
OH 
OH 
OK OK OK 
YEAH MAYBE TH THEN 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
YEAH IT'S ONE FREQUENCY DOMAIN NO 
YEAH DEFINITELY IT'S D 
BUT NOW I THINK PEOPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WHEN IS YOUR TURN 
OH 
OH 
OH OKAY 
I MEAN JUST BEFORE 
UH YOU 
LOW BIT RATE 
YES 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YOU KNOW THE THE 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
OH 
NO NO NO YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT IT'S MOSTLY LIKE THIS IS UH S CELP AND THIS THING 
NO I WAS IT UH DOING SOME UH LIKE WRITING SOME CODE FOR TESTING AND THESE THINGS WHERE I'M MAKING SOME T STANDARDS FOR THAT 
SO SO TH TH THERE ARE LIKE L THE THING THESE STANDARDS 
HOW IT WORKS IS LIKE THEY GAVE ALL THE PSEUDO CODE KIND OF THING AND THEN THEY PUT SEVERE TEST CONDITIONS 
SO YOU HAVE TO PASS THOSE TEST CONDITIONS 
LIKE THEN J YOU CAN SAY OKAY WE IMPLEMENTED D. SEVENTY EIGHT OR D. S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY EVEN THE T STANDARDS THEY GIVE THE TEST SIGNALS ALSO 
YOU ARE TO YOU CAN'T REALLY DO IT ON WHATEVER DATABASE YOU HAVE 
SO SO YOU ARE TO USE THE UH UH YEAH 
UH IT YEAH IT'S MORE LIKE UH THEY DEFINE 
SO I DID FOR SOME EVEN ALSO 
THEY'RE ALSO THEY DEFINE ALL THESE THE SPEECH CONDITION 
EVERYTHING THEY DEFINE 
SO YOU NEED TO FOLLOW ALL THIS 
YES THIS INDUSTRY IS AGAIN DIFFERENT LIKE YEAH 
YEAH I THINK THERE ISN'T ONLY USE MOST YEAH 
OH 
CELP IS FROM UH I. T. AND T. NO 
LIKE A. T. AND YEAH YEAH 
AT THE ALL THESE L. P. C. STUFF SO 
YEAH 
AH OK 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE 
YEAH THAT'S THE MAIN THING EVEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH LIKE I 
VOICE OVER I. P. OR YEAH 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND AGAIN LOT OF THIS STUFF LIKE WHE EVEN WHEN I WAS WORKING MOSTLY THAT COMPANY WAS DEVELOPING FOR VOICE OVER I. P. 
SO THEY'RE TO PUT ALL THESE THINGS IN AGAIN D. S. P. S 
AND ALSO IT'S MOSTLY LIKE HOW TO HOW MANY L. P. C. S OR YEAH HOW MANY CO YEAH IT'S OPTIMATION AND THEN IT'S EVEN 
YEAH 
AGAIN NOW NOW NOW EVEN THEY'RE ALSO BECOMING YEAH 
EVEN THE MEMORIES ARE NOT REALLY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO EVEN I THINK UH THEN YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER BAND WIDTH SO 
IT'S SHORT REALLY 
BUT NO I THINK UH BUT STILL THEN THAT'S WHAT MAYBE PEOPLE ARE GOING TOWARD SIGN SORT OF MODELLING NO 
LIKE I WAS BEFORE WHEN THE BANDWIDTH CONDITIONS WERE REALLY STRINGENT THEN THEY WERE USING ALL THE P L. P. C. BASED SOURCE FILTER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH IF YOU WANT YOU CAN LOOK AT HIS CODE AND 
BUT ONLY THE YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT DEFINITELY IT'S BETTER THAN CO CODED SPEECH NO 
DIFFERENT 
YEAH IT'S REALLY BUT UH HOW MUCH YOU CAN GET THE COMPRESS THESE LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TELLING US YOU CAN DO ALL THESE TRICKS LIKE 
YEAH THIS YEAH 
NO YEAH 
WELL YEAH I READ UH I REVIEWED ONE PAPER LIKE YEAH THA THAT'S THAT'S FROM ONE 
YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK AT DATES FROM UH YOU KNOW SET OF UH SET UH YEAH EAST ANGLIA 
YEAH 
UH THIS UH E EAST UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA BEN MILNER 
YEAH 
I YEAH IT'S YEAH I CAN FORWARD YOU THAT 
THEY'RE DOING LOT OF TRICKS 
THEY'RE LIKE THEY'RE AGAIN TRAINING GAUSSIAN MIXTURES FOR DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES AND THEN BUT THEY CAN THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO NO TH THESE THINGS ARE AGAIN BASED ON L. P. C. ONE 
LIKE MAINLY LIKE YEAH 
WHEREAS LIKE THE PITCH ESTIMATION IN IN THE X. WAVES OR THESE THINGS THEY'RE ALL DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING BASED ON AGAIN L. P. C. ANALYSIS 
YEAH 
AND THEN CONSTRUCT THAT 
HUH 
YEAH AGAIN LIKE UH IN THE PROBLEM IS DIFFERENT FOR EVERYBODY 
LIKE THESE GUYS WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR DISTRIBUTOR SPEECH RECOGNITION MAINLY THOSE UH SO 
OH YEAH M. F. C. C. S 
SO 
NO IT'S A. T. S. A. OR SOMETHING 
EUROPEAN STANDARD YEAH HYNEK REALLY N YEAH EVEN IT'S UH KIND OF AURORA FRAMEWORK 
SO YEAH 
NO BUT NOW IT'S ABOUT 
YEAH NOW THEY'RE 
AND THEN YEAH M. F. C. S 
BUT EVEN AT DISTANT POINT THEY'RE PLANNING TO USE FOR J UH STANDARD D. S. M. OR D. S. IT'S NOT 
OR 
YEAH 
A. UH I. T. S. A. A. YEAH 
EUROPEAN YEAH COMMISSION 
SO 
UM YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I YEAH ALL THESE STANDARDS ARE REALLY OKAY 
YEAH 
BUT 
YEAH 
BUT THE QUALITY AGAIN PROBLEM IN LIKE 
NO NO 
THE THE EU AGAIN EUROPEAN STANDARD WHAT THIS GIVE US THEY GIVE THE M. F. C. C. S AND THEY GIVE THE PITCH 
THEN YOU ARE TO CONSTRUCT THE THING 
BUT OF HAVE M. F. C. C. S THEN LIKE AGAIN YOU HAVE TO GET THE HIGH ORDER M. F. C. C. S AND THEN YEAH THEN YOU'RE HAVE TO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK AGAIN IT'S DIFFERENT ONE 
LIKE THESE STANDARDS AGAIN ALL THESE G. S. M. STANDARDS 
MAYBE THEY HAVE THE COMPRESSION STANDARDS AND AGAIN CODING STAND BUT MAYBE UH I I READ UH YEAH 
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE YEAH THEY'RE DOING YEAH COMBI YEAH THE EVEN EVEN G. EVEN NORMAL G. SEVENTY NINE NORMAL SPEECH CODER 
SO THEY HAVE THE SPEECH CODING STANDARDS AGAIN 
THEY ARE THESE CHANNEL CODING 
SO YEAH 
SO IT'S MM 
YEAH B 
MAYBE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AGAIN YEAH I 
SO OKAY 
YEP 
TH THANK YOU THEN 
OH 
OH MY GOD 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I SHOULD START 
YEAH 
NO SO I THOUGHT THAT WE MIGHT AS TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SPEECH CODING BECAUSE NOBODY IS DOING HERE SPEECH CODING AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME MAYBE FEEDBACK BECAUSE EXCEPT ME 
I'VE I'VE SUPPOSED TO SOME SPEECH CODING STUFF HERE WITH HYNEK UH BUT YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE BIT AT LEAST THAT UH BASED ON SOME LET'S SAY HILBERT TRANSFORMS USING A LONGER TEMPORAL CONTEXT AND DERIVING SOME PARAMETERS WOULD BE TRANF TRANSCS TRANSMITTED TO A DECODER AND 
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE STUFF WHICH PEOPLE ARE USING NOW WHICH IS LIKE A L. P. C. BASED 
AND BUT WE ARE AT THE BEGINNING WITH EVERYTHING MORE OR LESS 
SO STILL UM WE CAN'T UH D ENCODE A SPEECH 
BUT OF COURSE THERE IS THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS WHICH WE STILL DIDN'T SOLVE AND THE BIGGEST ONE IS QUITE SIMILAR TO L. P. C. STUFF WHERE PEOPLE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW IT EXACTLY ENCODE A CARRIER OR THE SOURCE SIGNAL 
WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE ENVELOPE OR HOW TO APPROXIMATE THE ENVELOPE LET'S SAY 
UM WHEN YOU HAVE GOT 
UH YOU MEAN THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO PLOT AT LEAST SO 
UM MAYBE I I CAN I CAN 
SO WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW YEAH YOU MEAN 
OKAY I UH EVERYBODY KNOWS L. P. C. STUFF HOW IT WORKS 
SO I DON'T HAVE TO PRESENT ANYTHING MORES 
BUT IT'S UH M MORE OR LESS VERY SIMPLE 
WE HAVE LET'S SAY AT THE BEGINNING THERE IS SOME SPEECH SIGNAL 
WHAT WE ARE UH WE MIGHT USE IT UH IN VERY SIMPLE WAY THAT WE ARE USING SOME HILBERT TRANSFORM H AT THE BEGINNING TO CREATE ANALYTIC SIGNAL 
THE ANALYTIC SIGNAL IS THE SIGNAL WHICH IS A COMPLEX WHICH YOU CAN CREATE FROM THE UH REAL UH UH SOME SEQUENCE 
AND IF YOU GET IF YOU APPLY HILBERT TRANSFORM ON THIS IN SUCH A SPEECH SIGNAL LIKE A REAL TRAJECTORY 
THEN YOU GOT A COMPLEX SIGNAL AND IF YOU TAKE JUST THE AMPLITUDE THEN YOU GET HILBERT ENVELOPE CODE 
SO I WILL I I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH LET'S SAY UPS 
YEAH IT'S U IT'S NOT P. L. P. AT ALL DO 
MM 
NO HE'S IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME 
OH YOU'RE LIT I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN WITH THE P P. L. P. 
THEY ARE APPLYING P. L. P. WITH SOME ITERATION WITH THIS THIS ONE APPROACH 
SO THEY ARE DOING SOME SMOOTHING OF A SPECTROGRAM IN TWO WAYS 
ONE WAS RIGHT 
RIGHT 
BUT P. L. P. IS USING JUST THE SPECTRAL UH DIRECTION 
LET'S SAY YOU ARE DOING UH FOR EVERY TWENTY MILLISECOND PROCESSING ON ONE FEATURE VECTOR 
HERE YOU ARE PROCESSING ONE SPECTRAL BAND FREQUENCY BAND RIGHT 
SO IT'S DIFFERENT DIRECTION WHICH WE ARE WE USING 
BUT ANYWAY THIS IS VERY SIMPLE 
SO APPLYING THAT UH ABSOLUTE UH ABSOLUTE OPERATION YOU GOT A HILBERT ENVELOPE 
AND OF COURSE THEN THERE IS THE PHASE 
SO IT'S JUST THE COMPLEX OPERATION 
AND THAT'S MORE OR LESS ALL WHAT WE ARE DOING 
SO NOW WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW SO HOW TO APPROXIMATE THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE 
WE ARE AP WE ARE APPLYING THAT HILBERT UH HIM WHAT IS THE MARIUS' UH STUFF 
SO HE KNOWS HOW TO ENCODE UH THE HILBERT UH ENVELOPE USING LIKE L. S. F. S OR L. P. C. 
YOU ARE APPLYING AGAIN TO SOME LINEAR PREDICTION MODEL AFTER THAT 
BUT IT'S UH RIGHT IT'S IN A IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENCE N NOT APPLIED IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN 
SO INSTEAD OF CLASSICAL L. P. C. DOMAIN WHERE YOU HAVE A SPECTRUM LET'S SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND YOU ARE APPLYING SOME LINEAR PREDICTION MODEL WHICH IS TRYING TO APPROXIMATE THE SPECTRUM RIGHT 
SO THIS IS FREQUENCY 
IN OUR CASE WE ARE WE ARE TRYING TO APPROXIMATE S KIND OF INSTANTANEOUS ENERGY 
SO IF THIS IS A TIME AND YOU GET ONE AND ADD ONE FREQUENCY BAND YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
AND WE ARE TRYING TO APPROXIMATE THAT ENVELOPE WHICH IS 
THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE 
RIGHT 
SO AGAIN WE KNOW WHAT IT MORE OR LESS WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE HILBERT ENVELOPE 
WE KNOW THAT WE CAN APPLY LINEAR PREDICTION MODEL AND IT WORKS PRETTY WELL 
BUT I IF YOU WANT TO REALLY CONSTRUCT THE SPEECH SIGNAL OR THE YOU AND ALSO THE PHASE SIGNAL 
WHICH IS AN UH SOME SENSE QUITE SIMPLE FOR VOICED SPEECH SIGNAL SAY 
BUT IS UH THE PHASE NO YOU C IT'S A PHASE OR YOU CAN ENCODE IT LIKE A CARRIER 
SO THE CARRIER IS IF YOU KNOW UH AMPLITUDE MODULATION RIGHT 
YOU MAY IS SOMETHING LIKE THERE IS ONE COSINE WHICH IS UH VERY WOULD HAVE QUITE A F RIGHT 
YEAH 
IT'S CALLED LIKE THE PHASE 
RIGHT RIGHT 
EXACTLY 
SO TH THIS IS THE SIGNAL WHICH YOU ALSO HAVE TO SOMEHOW ENCODE OR TRANSMIT FROM A CODE OF THE DECODER IN ORDER TO RE SYNTHESIZE IT RIGHT 
SO 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
AGAIN 
FOR THIS ONE 
FOR THE THE LINEAR PREDICTION MODEL 
WELL IT'S UH JUST A LINEAR PREDICTION 
CLASSICAL WAY 
I MEAN UH OKAY W WELL IF YOU WANT TO USE IT IN MORE DETAILS I MEAN 
UH YOU MEAN UH YEAH BUT BIT RATE YOU MEAN 
OKAY YEAH 
SURE SURE 
SO WHEREAS WE ARE WHAT WE ARE NOW SO LET'S SAY SOMETHING LIKE ONE POINT TWO KILO BITS PER SECOND FOR UH THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE 
SO 
IT'S AGAIN A ROUGHLY ESTIMATED SOMEHOW 
BUT WE STILL KNOW THAT WE CAN GO DOWN AND RIGHT 
EXACTLY YEAH 
I DON WE ARE USING LIKE FIFTEEN BANDS 
RIGHT 
BUT THEY ARE FIRST THEY ARE INTER OH WELL INTEGRATED INTO FIFTEEN BANDS USING UH CLASSICAL WAY LIKE AN M. F. C. C. S OR IN P. L. P. 
YOU JUST APPLY SOME THIS UH TRIANGULAR WINDOWS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN ORDER TO TO GET A L REALLY LIKE JUST FIFTEEN BANDS RIGHT 
AND EACH BAND IS THEN PROCESSED INDEPENDENTLY 
SO FOR ONE BAND WE MORE OR LESS HAVE WE LIKE W ONE HUNDRED BITS PER SECOND 
FOR HILBERT ENVELOPE 
RIGHT 
RIGHT RIGHT 
Y YEAH YOU CAN JUST RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
OH RIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE DID 
YEAH SURE 
SURE SURE 
YEAH 
THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE WOULD WOULDN'T IT ALL 
BUT YEAH EXACTLY 
BUT NOW WHAT I ARE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS SOMEHOW APPROXIMATE THAT UH CARRIER SIGNAL TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE CARRIER 
THERE ARE MANY SIMPLE THINGS WHICH YOU CAN DO LIKE UH QUANTIZATION QUANTIZATION FOR EXAMPLE 
RIGHT 
YOU MEAN SOMETHING LIKE UH OF UH THAT CELP CODING SYSTEM WHERE YOU'RE OR WH WH WH WHAT IS ON WHAT IS EXACTLY SCALABLE SYSTEM 
WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT 
OH YEAH YEAH SURE 
THIS WAS YEAH 
FOR DIF YEAH RIGHT 
RIGHT RIGHT 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK THIS APPR APPROACH CAN DO THAT BECAUSE YOU REALLY CAN SPLIT IT INTO SEVERAL BANDS 
AND YOU CAN DECIDE HOW MANY BANDS YOU WANT MORE OR LESS 
SO 
YEAH THIS IS A BAR SCALE WE ARE USING 
YEAH OR MEL MEL SCALE SO IT'S UH IT'S BEING UH MORE WIDER FOR HIGHER FREQUENCIES AND OF COURSE THE USE THE SPACES RIGHT 
YEAH 
BUT WHAT I W MY SENSE IS THAT IT IS NOT AS MUCH IMPORTANT STILL 
I MEAN IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE ALSO USE MEL SCALE OR BAR SCALE 
BUT RIGHT YEAH 
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE USING YEAH 
OH ACTUALLY WE ARE USING JUST GAUSSIAN WINDOWS HERE INSTEAD OF THOSE TRIANGULARS BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE UH NO 
IT'S BETTER THAN FOR DECODING IT'S BETTER TO PLAY WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE NOT ZERO ANYWHERE YOU KNOW 
THEY ARE THEY ARE APPROACHING OR NO THEY ARE IN ZERO 
BUT ACTUALLY THEY ARE NOT 
SO DO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT SOME ZERO VALUES HERE AND BIT MORE OR LESS IT DOESN'T MATTER YEAH 
WE ARE USING JUST GAUS GAUSSIAN WINDOWS 
OKAY SO L THOSE ARE THAT THE HILBERT ENVELOPE IS UM IS APPROXIMATED BY LINEAR PREDICTION 
SO YOU HAVE L. P. C. COEFFICIENTS WHICH YOU CAN TRANSCRIBE INTO L. L. L. S. F. IS WHICH ARE RIGHT EXACTLY 
YEAH 
RIGHT EXACTLY 
SO FIRST UH THE APPROACH IS QUITE SIM SIMPLE 
SO AT THE BEGINNING WE APPLY D. C. T. IN ORDER TO GET TO FREQUENCY DOMAIN 
THEN YOU APPLY THOSE UH TRIANGULAR OR GAUSSIAN WINDOWS 
SO THIS IS DONE FOR ONE SECOND EIGHT THOUSAND SAMPLES FOR EIGHT KILO HERTZ SAMPLING FREQUENCY RIGHT 
SO FOR SUCH D. C. T. TRAJECTORY YOU APPLY THOSE UH GAUSSIAN WINDOWS 
AND THEN I SEE YOU SPLIT IT IN TWO FREQUENCY SUB BANDS 
AND THEN EACH ONE OF FREQUENCY SUB BAND IS MORE OR LESS UH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
EXACTLY 
YOU JUST APPLY L. L. P. S AUTO CORRELATION LET'S SAY OR YOU CAN DO POWER SPECTRUM WHATEVER 
YEAH SO YOU FOR EACH ONE YOU GET L. S. F. IS HERE 
UH WELL I'M USING NOW LIKE TWENTY L. S. F. S PER ONE SECOND PER ONE FREQUENCY BAND 
FIFTEEN 
NO NO 
IF I JUST KEEP ALL THEM IS TWENTY L. S. F. S EACH ONE IS UM 
IS QUANTIZED BY FOUR OR FIVE BITS 
OF WHAT 
THREE HUNDRED BITS 
TWO 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
YOU MEAN THIS PHASE THE THE HILBERT CARRIER 
OR ONE OF COURSE WE DID 
YEAH 
UH W WELL THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO 
WE DON'T WELL THE FIRST THING WHAT YOU CAN REALLY DO IS JUST TO REPLACE IT BY GAUSSIAN NOISE 
SO YOU CAN REALLY IS IT LIKE AN UH L. P. C. SYSTEM 
RIGHT 
EXACTLY 
OR YOU CAN REPLACE IT BY SOME COSINE ONE COSINE GENERATED IN A CEN CENTRE FREQUENCY OF THAT GAUSSIAN WINDOW 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
TO ME TO UM YEAH 
TWELVE HUNDRED 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S POSSIBLE SOME OF IT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OR RIGHT 
WELL I'M JUST COMPARING WITH UH L. P. C. TEN STANDARD WHICH IS LIKE CLASSICAL L. P. C. 
A LITTLE BIT OPTIMIZED 
SO THERE IN THE OTHER SO I THINK TWO POINT FOUR KILO BITS PER SECOND THE BIT RATE FOR THAT 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
THIS IS AN UH I MEAN L. P. C. TEN IS JUST L. P. C. 
NO NO NO 
NO 
JUST NOISE OR JUST THOSE IMPULSES 
CELP 
YEAH THERE YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
FOUR POINT EIGHT OR SOMETHING 
RIGHT 
YEAH SURE 
WELL MORE OR LESS WHAT WE DIDN'T DO IS ANALYSIS BY SYNTHESIS RIGHT 
SO THAT'S WHAT CELP IS DOING RIGHT 
SO YEAH SO THIS IS WHAT WE DO AND UH THAT MIGHT HELP A LOT OF COURSE 
BUT W YEAH EXACTLY 
THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION 
IT WILL BE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
FOR EXAMPLE UH THERE WHAT I ALSO DID WAS UH A SIMPLE PEAK PEAKING ALGORITHM 
SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK ON THAT SPECTRUM OF THAT IF THAT CARRIER SIGNAL 
WHICH IS MORE OR LESS LIKE THE COSINE IF YOU REALLY TAKE A LOOK ON THAT 
BUT IT IS KIND OF FREQUENCY SHIFTED COSINE OR FREQUENCY MODULATED COSINE 
RIGHT SO IT'S THE THE FREQUENCY STILL TO BE CHANGING 
OR OF COURSE THE AMPLITUDE IS JUST NOT CONSTANT ALL TIME 
IT SHOULD BE THEORETICALLY 
BUT PRACTICALLY IT'S NOT 
SO WHAT YOU CAN USE FOR A ONE SECOND SIGNAL YOU M MORE OR LESS YOU ALREADY MIGHT USE SOME LIKE ONE 
NO UH IMPULSE THERE ARE SPECTRAL LINE FOR 
BUT USUALLY THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHICH ARE IS QUITE SMALL BUT THEY ARE QUITE IMPORTANT 
IF YOU DON'T TRANSMIT THEM THEN THE SIGNAL IS QUITE ROBOTIC OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO IF YOU'RE REALLY TRANSMITTING JUST ONE SPECTRAL LINE 
BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO 
AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND PRETTY WELL 
THE SIGNAL IS EDIBLE 
OR IF YOU'RE ADJUST UH THE FOUND ON ON LINE 
ONE SPEAKER AND DOM DOM DOMINANT ONE ON THE SPECTRUM OF THAT C UH CARRIER HIL HILBERT CARRIER AND YOU JUST TRANSMIT THIS PARAMETER 
NO NO 
IT'S EVEN EASIER BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST DIVIDE THE YOU JUST MULTIPLY THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE BY THE TABLE CARRIER 
THAT THAT'S ALL 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH EXACTLY 
SO SO YOU JUST MULTIPLY THAT UH ONE HILBERT CARRIER WHICH IS TRANSCRIBED BY L. S. F. S BY THAT THIS AN I. F. F. T. SIGNAL 
SO 
UH IF YOU MEAN THE PHASE OF THAT UH OF THAT CARRIER 
OF OF COURSE I TRY TO PLAY ALSO WITH THAT 
AND UH I FOUND THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER AS MUCH WHICH WHAT IS THE PHASE BECAUSE WE ARE USING JUST ONE SECOND WINDOW RIGHT 
SO OF COURSE THERE THERE MIGHT BE UH SOME UH DISTURB UH DISTURBED UH WHEN YOU CONCATENATE THOSE SEGMENTS TOGETHER 
BUT THEN THE PHASE MIGHT BE IMPORTANT 
BUT OTHERWISE I MEAN I DIDN'T FIND ANY ANYTHING IMPORTANT WITH THE PHASE 
LOOK GREAT KEEP THE PHASE ZERO AND IT WORKS 
OR 
RIGHT 
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT 
YEAH 
BUT IT'S AGAIN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE I THEY ARE DOING THIS IN A FREQUENCY DOMAIN 
BUT THIS IS IN TIME DOMAIN MORE OR LESS 
RIGHT 
THE SPECTROGRAM YOU MEAN 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
EXACTLY 
WHAT WE CAN ALSO DO VERY SIMPLE IS JUST TO GET THE MAGNITUDE SPECTROGRAM USING THIS APPROXIMATION WITHOUT THE CARRIER JUST HILBERT ENVELOPE 
BUT YOU JUST UH GET IT IN IN THIS WAY IN IN THE WAY OF ROB'S RIGHT 
BUT YOU CAN ALSO GOT THE S SHORT TIME FOURIER TRANSFORM UH AND KEEP IT RIGHT 
JUST CLASSICAL UH FROM BY FRAME ALGORITHM TWENTY MILLISECONDS 
UH BUT YOU KEEP JUST THE PHASES INSTEAD OF MAGNITUDES 
AND YOU CAN PUT THIS TOGETHER RIGHT 
AND IT WORKS PRETTY WELL AND THEN THE SIGNAL IS NOT UH JUST UH WHISPERED 
THEN YOU REALLY HEAR THAT THERE IS THE VOICENESS IN THE SIGNAL 
BUT UH OF COURSE THE QUALITY IS UH IS NOT SO GOOD STILL 
BUT UH YOU CAN USE IT FOR LIKE TWO THREE KILO BITS PER SECOND AND IT WORKS 
LIKE YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH SURE 
ANYWAY 
SO UM HMM M MAYBE IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU T IF YOU TELL US UH WHAT YOU DO WITH THE SPEECH CODING 'CAUSE I D I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF P. H. D. S IF YOU 
I THINK 
SO IF YOU ADD SOMETHING SO MAYBE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING AT LEAST IT 
YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
IT'S TRUE 
SO YOU WERE WHEN WHEN DID YOU DO THAT 
OH OKAY 
UH-HUH 
I THINK SO YEAH 
YOU MEAN SEEING THAT UH C. D. M. A. 
OR 
YEAH IT'S NOT G. S. M. 
RIGHT IT'S UH KIND OF US IN C. D. M. A. IS UH ANOTHER LEVEL I THINK 
MM-HMM 
I THINK THERE IS A L LOT OF MONEY ON THAT LIKE RIGHT 
LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION OF COURSE IT'S VERY INTERESTING BUT PEOPLE DON'T USE IT AS MUCH IS IS JUST CODING JUST TELEPHONING RIGHT OR JUST 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
THEY S YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
NO I I 
WELL WHAT WE WERE WHAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT IS UH C. D. M. A. I MEAN THERE IS THE B 
WELL THE PROBLEM IS THIS ONE WITH THIS APPLICATION 
OR IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PROBLEM BUT ONE CONSTRAINT IS THAT WE ARE PROCESSING ONE SECOND OF THE SIGNAL 
YOU CAN GO DOWN OF COURSE 
BUT THEN YOU ARE LOSING LITTLE BIT OF THE BIT RATE LET'S SAY RIGHT 
SO BUT THERE ARE MANY APPLICATIONS WHERE YOU REALLY CAN USE IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ALGORITHMIC DELAY ONE SECOND ALGORITHMIC DELAY 
LIKE FOR I DON'T KNOW IF INSTEAD OF S. M. S. YOU CAN REALLY HAVE SOME CHANNEL WHERE YOU JUST RIGHT 
UM SO PROBABLY 
RIGHT RIGHT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEP 
RIGHT 
WHAT IF SO 
WHICH ONE IS UH 
WELL 
BUT THE SINUSOIDAL CODING IS USUALLY UM WHEN YOU SEE AT LEAST WHAT I THINK OUR UH WHAT I KNOW SO WHEN YOU ARE DOING SINUSOIDAL CODING IT MEANS YOU JUST TAKE THE SPEECH SIGNAL TO THE BEGINNING 
RIGHT 
AND YOU ARE TRYING TO FIND IT UH YEAH TO FIND THE HARMONICS IN A TEMPORAL DOMAIN RIGHT FOR THAT 
RIGHT 
OH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
MORE OR LESS I DID IT MAYBE DIFFERENT WAY BUT KIND OF ALGORITHM LIKE OKAY 
TRYING TO FIND OUT THE STRONGEST OR THE THE MOST DOMINANT PEAKS IN THE SPECTRUM WHICH IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME 
BUT THE 
BUT YOU KNOW THE THE OF THE INTERESTING 
RIGHT 
RIGHT AND THAT THAT'S IT 
AND THEN YOU DO MULTIPLES OF RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LIKE IT 
IF IT IS UNWRAP YOU MEAN 
UNWRAP UH PHASE 
RIGHT 
YOU L RIGHT YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
I ALSO PLAY WITH THAT 
AND FOR EXAMPLE WHAT I FOUND I WILL IN THIS CASE UH WE ARE NOT TRYING TO ENCODE THE SPEECH SIGNAL 
WE ARE TRYING TO ENCODE SOME CARRIER WHICH IS MUCH EASIER I WOULD SAY BECAUSE YOU CAN REALLY UM YOU CAN SEE THAT EVEN 
SO WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ENCODE AT THE PHASES SO I JUST FOUND THAT UH TWO BITS IS ENOUGH FOR THAT AND YOU REALLY DON'T HEAR THE DIFFERENCE 
SO IF YOU KEEP ALL THE SPECTRAL LINES AS THEY WERE THERE BUT YOU WERE JUST UH QUANTIZING WITH TWO BITS OR THREE BITS FOR AMPLITUDE 
TWO BITS FOR FOR PHASE 
SO IT'S OKAY 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU HAVE TO TRANSMIT MANY OF THEM 
'CAUSE THERE IS NOT JUST ONE DOMINANT COMPONENT BUT USUALLY MORE OTHERS WHICH ARE QUITE SMALL RIGHT 
OR WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO THEN YOU HAVE TO DECREASE THE THE THE SIZE OF INTO ONE SECOND 
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN GET JUST VOICED PART AND UNVOICED PART 
YOU KNOW ONE SECOND IT'S USUALLY MIXED RIGHT SOMEHOW TOGETHER 
NOT NEW ONE 
I W 
UH UH WE DON'T NO WANT TO DO THAT YEAH BECAUSE IT'S QUITE TRICKY 
RIGHT 
YEAH SURE 
EXACTLY 
RIGHT 
BUT FOR EXAMPLE WHAT WE ALSO FOUND IS THAT IF YOU USE JUST THE HILBERT ENVELOPE 
THAT THAT IN WHICH IS TRYING TO APPROXIMATE THAT ENERGY IN SOME LOW BAND 
LIKE AR AROUND TWO HUNDRED T UH HERTZ AND YOU TAKE A LOOK ON THE SIGNAL 
IN THE TRAJECTORY YOU CAN SEE THAT IT WORKS LIKE KIND OF UM VOICE DETECTOR 
BECAUSE UH FOR A LOW ENERGIES THERE IS USUALLY NOISE 
FOR HIGH ENERGIES THERE IS KIND OF A HARMONICITY 
SO IT WORKS PRETTY WELL FOR THAT 
SO WE MIGHT USE THIS ONE INFORMATION FOR THAT 
BUT 
YEAH I THINK SO YEAH 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S TRUE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM 
SURE 
UH F 
THAT WOULD BE NICE N NOT TO HAVE ANYTHING YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
MY 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
EXACTLY 
WELL I DON'T KNOW 
MAYBE IF YOU W UH REALLY WANT TO IMPROVE THE THE QUALITY THEN WE WILL NEED TO I DON'T KNOW STILL 
NO NOT NOW 
YEAH UH WELL I'M GONNA TO HAVE A TIME NEXT NEXT MONTH OR IN THREE WEEKS SO I'LL TRY TO PLAY SOME EXAMPLES THERE FOR YOU NEED 
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO RECONSTR 
HOW DOES IT LOOK LIKE OUR USER 
YEAH MORE OR LESS 
IT'S KIND OF UH NOT FREQUENCY 
LET'S SAY AMPLITUDE MODULATION WHEN YOU HAVE JU JUST THE CARRIER AND THAT MODULATION SIGNAL RIGHT 
YEAH W YEAH YEAH YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH YEAH 
IT'S IN BETWEEN EXACTLY 
SO IT'S NOT THIS AND THAT 
BUT STILL YEAH 
BUT ANYWAY WHAT ELSE THE OTHER APPROACH WHICH IS POSSIBLE TO USE 
TH THERE IS ONE TO KEEP THE PHASE LIKE THIS ONE LIKE TWO SPECTROGRAMS ONE THE PHASE AND IN THE MAGNITUDE 
AND WELL I CAN AGAIN PLAY IT AND IT WORKS ON TWO KILO BITS PER SECOND 
QUITE WHAT UH ON WHAT HE HE WAS DOING HE WAS USING IT FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
WHAT I WHAT I KNOW BUT FOR SPEECH CODING NO NO NO IT WAS I DON'T KNOW 
FOR SPEECH CODING YOU MEAN 
I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
UM MAYBE 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL FOR EXAMPLE THIS PHASE INFORMATION RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
I THINK SO 
THERE ARE M MORE PAPERS WHICH ARE USING THIS APPROACH LIKE TRYING TO ENCODE THE MAGNITUDE SPECTRUM OR SPECTROGRAM 
UH THE PHASE OR YOU JUST UH OR CAN AGAIN THE PHASE CAN BE REPLACED BY THE ONES WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD 
SO THAT'S UH THE BENEFIT UH VARIABLE APPROACH 
SO IF YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE A BAND WIDTH YOU JUST CAN REPLACE IT BY NOISE AND IT WORKS 
OF COURSE THEN IT DOESN'T SOUND IS THE ORIGINAL BECAUSE IT'S MORE WHISPERED OR WHATEVER 
BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WELL 
AND FOR EXAMPLE UH IF YOU MENTION THIS ONE APPROACH WITH THE THAT UH TRAJECTORY OF THE PHASE 
OF UNWRAP PHASE RECRE UH I ALSO USE BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT HERE WHEN YOU GET INTO UH THIS DOMAIN WHERE YOU APPLY UH OR YOU'RE TRYING TO COMPUTE UH S POWER SPECTRUM IN IN ORDER TO LET'S SAY THAT THIS KIND OF TRAJECTORY 
IT DOESN'T IN FIT THE SAME FREQUENCY OVER TIME DOMAIN 
BUT HERE YOU ARE TRYING TO COMPUTE UH DOING A TO DO LINEAR PREDICTION 
SO WE ARE JUST DOING F. F. T. RIGHT 
THEN APPLYING UH POWER IN ORDER TO GET UM IT IS TO POWER DOMAIN AND THEN I. F. F. T. RIGHT 
SO YOU GET THE AUTO CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS 
SO BEFORE YOU'RE APPLYING UH POWER SPECTRUM 
YOU CAN AGAIN GET THE YOU HAVE GOT A COMPLEX F FREQ FREQUENCY OR COMPLEX SPECTRUM YOU CAN GET THE PHASE RIGHT 
AND THE PHASE LOOK QUITE SIMILAR LIKE THIS 
SO YOU MIGHT AS IT'S IS MORE LESS LIKE A LINE 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S IT IS VERY DIFFERENT YEAH 
THEN YOU ARE DOING IN DIFFERENT DOMAIN 
I THINK THIS IS ONE FREQUENCY DOMAIN THIS ONE TIME DOMAIN 
UM IT IS QUITE IT'S QUITE SENSIBLE TO ANY QUANTIZATION WHAT I FOUND 
REALLY IT LOOKS LIKE THE LINES 
SO YOU JUST SAY OKAY LET'S P LET'S PUT THE LINE THERE 
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK 
OR WELL YOU CAN UNDERSTAND 
BUT YOU CAN HEAR THAT THERE ARE MANY ARTIFACTS WHICH RIGHT EXACTLY 
RIGHT RIGHT 
AND THE ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT UH IT'S NOT BAND WIDTH VARIABLE 
SO YOU CANNOT SAY THAT THIS PART WILL BE THE JUST THE ONES WHICH YOU CAN DO AN HOUR IN THIS THIS OTHER APPROACH 
SO THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T PLAY WITH THAT IS M MORE BECAUSE I FOUND THERE ARE MORE UH DISADVANTAGES THAN THE ADVANTAGES THIS APPROACH 
SO THAT'S WHY 
YOU MEAN THIS ONE 
YEAH IF YOU TAKE JUST THE ORIGINAL PHASE AND THE 
RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT A PHASE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
IT'S THE PHASE NO YOU CAN AGAIN PUT THE THAT ENVELOPE WITH THIS PHASE TOGETHER BECAUSE ENVELOPE IS TWO 
NO NO 
YOU GO ON YOU GET THE F 
YEAH YOU GET THE COMPLEX COMPLEX SPECTRUM WITH THIS 
NO NO I STARTED WITH THE D. C. T. 
NO AFTER D. C. T. YOU ARE TRYING THIS IS IS KIND OF AGAIN A REAL TRAJECTORY RIGHT 
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIRST FIND THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE 
SO UH LET'S WELL SO THIS IS A SPEECH 
NO BUT HERE WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS REALLY THAT YOU IT'S NOT PART OF HILBERT ENVELOPE IT'S PART OF THE D. C. T. SIGNAL 
SO IT'S NOT IT'S ENOUGH IF YOU HAVE JUST THIS PHASE AND IF AND THE HILBERT ENVELOPE YOU CAN PUT IT TOGETHER 
YOU DON'T NEED THE CARRIER 
I MEAN THIS IS KIND OF A CARRIER SIGNAL BUT IN DIFFERENT DOMAIN REPRESENTED 
RIGHT RIGHT 
SO I WHAT I THINK SO THAT WE ALREADY WILL NEED TO APPLY IS KIND OF ANALYSIS BY SYNTHESIS APPROACH MM UH IN ORDER TO GET SOMETHING 
RIGHT 
WHAT I 
NO 
YOU MEAN YOU 
RIGHT 
RIGHT RIGHT 
YES THAT'S TRUE 
BUT I MEAN THAT'S MAYBE EVEN THE ADVANTAGE HERE BECAUSE YOU IT'S NOT SPEECH D BASED WHICH MEANS WE ARE NOT 
RIGHT 
SO YOU CAN WHEN I TRIED AND COMPARING WITH L. P. C. TEN IN A UH TWICE BIGGER OR HIGHER BIT RATE THIS WORK WORKS BETTER IT SEEMS TO ME 
JUST FOR UNVOICED SPEECH 
O I'M NOT MENTIONING UH VOICELESS BECAUSE THAT'S UNVOICED WHICH MEANS WHISPERED 
OH YEAH BUT UH WHEN YOU HERE AND TRY TO USE SOME EXAMPLES WITH THE MUSIC FOR EXAMPLE 
RIGHT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S TRUE YEAH 
UH BUT ANYWAY IT SEEMED TO ME PRETTY GOOD 
I MEAN THAT THERE MIGHT BE 
THAT'S TRUE YEAH 
UH IT SHOULD BE UH THIRTEENTH DECEMBER I THINK 
I JUST UH YOU WON'T BE HERE 
OH OKAY 
NO I JUST SWAPPED IT WITH UH MIKE PERROT I THINK 'CAUSE HE HE IS NOT GOING TO BE HERE THIS TIME 
AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE TO AN UH IN JANUARY 
SO WHATEVER 
ANYWAY 
SO BUT ANYWAY I I WANTED TO HEAR SOMETHING MAYBE FROM YOU WHAT YOU ARE DOING F WITH SPEECH CODING BECAUSE YOU WERE YOU MENTIONED THAT 
BYE 
BUT IT WAS BASED ON LIKE YOU WERE USING KIND OF RECOGNIZER THERE RIGHT 
UH-HUH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S I'M I MEAN YEAH IT'S DIFFERENT 
BUT UH IT'S SPEECH CODING AT LEAST 
I THINK SO 
RIGHT 
YEAH SURE 
BAND YOU MEAN 
RIGHT 
WITH DIFFERENT 
I DON'T KNOW 
BUT MAYBE WHAT WE CAN ALREADY DO IS UH TO DECREASE THIS UH THIS DISTANCE 
WE CAN DO A HILBERT ENVELOPE APPROXIMATION WITH ONE SECOND 
BUT THEN WE CAN SPLIT THAT SIGNAL INTO I DON'T KNOW TEN TEN UH SEGMENTS WITH THE ONE HUNDRED MILLISECONDS OR EVEN LESS 
AND WE CAN APPLY SOME OTHER TECHNIQUE FOR THAT YOU KNOW 
STILL 
RIGHT 
EXACTLY EXACTLY 
YEAH 
WELL THE MORE LESS THEY DON'T CARE WHAT'S UH WHAT WILL BE THE QUALITY OF THE OF THE OR THE BIT RATE 
THEY JUST WANT TO GET SOMETHING NEW YOU KNOW 
SO IF YOU GET THE V VERY UH LOW BIT RATE WITH A REASONABLE QUALITY ARE REALLY HIGH BIT RATE 
WHICH IS C AGAIN DIFFERENT BUT WITH UH HIGH QUALITY UH THEY WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THE BOTH 
SO YOU KNOW IN ONE SIDE IT'S PRETTY GOOD BUT IN THE OTHER YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY YOU SHOULD GO 'CAUSE THERE ARE MANY OF THEM 
AND UH 
RIGHT RIGHT 
OKAY 
WELL I I WILL 
WE UH DO YOU WANT TO MENTION YOUR SPEECH CODING EXPERIMENTS 
SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING I IN AND WITH UH 
SO YOU KNOW THE SUB MM LIKE UM MORE DETAILS 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
RIGHT RIGHT 
RIGHT 
I SEE 
YEAH BUT IT'S QUITE INTERESTING WITH THE EVEN WITH THE UH SO CURRENT SPEECH CODING UH TECHNOLOGIES 
WE ARE THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO USE K ZAP OR THIS R. P. BASED APPROACHES 
THERE IS NOTHING NEW MORE OR LESS 
AND IF I WHEN I WAS UH LISTENING THE UH THE OUTLOOK OF UH MILAN JELINEK UH HE'S THE CZECH GUY BUT HE LIVES IN UH IN CANADA 
I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE UNIVERSITY 
BUT THEY THEY HAVE UH THE PATTERN I THINK FOR CELP EVEN 
OR 
UM I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS EXACTLY BUT THEY GET VERY VERY FAMOUS FOR THIS FOR THAT CELP 
WHAT THEY DID EXACTLY I DON'T KNOW IF SOMETHING DIFFERENT A LITTLE BIT OR NOT 
ARE THEY JUST KEEP THOSE PATTERNS OR I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS EXACTLY 
MAYBE HYNEK WILL KNOW MUCH MORE 
BUT UH WHEN I HEARD THOSE THAT PRESENTATION THEY DIDN'T DO IS MUCH NOW 
I MEAN UH IT WAS LAST YEAR AND UH I THINK HYNEK 
HE WAS ASKING WH SO WHAT'S NEW THAT YOU ARE SO FAMOUS WITH THAT AND THEY N THEY SAID OKAY WE WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO THAT 
I MEAN YOU KNOW NOT TO MAKE ANY ERRORS LIKE ONE BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT 
BUT UH IT'S NOT SO EASY TO IMPLEMENT IT RIGHT 
SO UH THERE IS NOTHING SO MUCH NEW REALLY LIKE 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
EXACTLY 
RIGHT 
RIGHT RI RIGHT EXACTLY EXACTLY 
BUT THEN THEY ARE IS STILL USING LIKE ERROR SIGNAL WHICH IS GOING TO BE APPROXIMATED BY CODE BOOK RIGHT 
AND A LINEAR PREDICTION WHICH IS IS WHICH IS APPROXIMATING JUST THE SPECTRUM OF FOR FOR AND EVERYTHING THAT THAT'S THAT'S ALL 
SO STILL 
RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT 
WELL I HOPE THAT WE STILL HAVE A A LOT OF TIME FOR THAT BECAUSE UH 
I THINK YEAH IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING YEAH 
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS UH YOU KNOW HARMONIC VOICE MODELLING THAT H. M. M. SYSTEM WHICH IS USING USED FOR SYNTHESIS MORE LESS 
IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING 
I MEAN IT IT WORKS IT WORKS WELL 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH IT IS 
YOU MEAN UH IN SINUSOIDAL UH MODELLING 
YEAH 
AND BUT ANYWAY DO YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT IS DONE WHEN YOU REALLY HAVE THOSE M. F. C. C. COEFFICIENTS 
WHICH MEANS MAGNITUDE SPECTRUM AND THEN YOU ARE TRYING TO RECONSTRUCT THE SPEECH 
WITHOUT A PHASE 
BECAUSE I I TRIED YOU KNOW THIS TH THOSE PAPERS 
BUT SO I'M LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT IT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS 
BUT 
WHICH ONE 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE NICE 
OH 
YOU KNOW UM BUT THERE ARE SOME ALGORITHMS WHICH WERE QUITE UH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
UH IT SEEMS TO UM YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
LIKE TRY 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO UM MAYBE 
WHAT YOU CAN DO IS UH TAKE JUST THE MINIMUM PHASE OF WHICH YOU CAN GET FROM A LINEAR PREDICTION RIGHT 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN MINIMUM PHASE SIGNAL 
AND IT SOUNDS QUITE UH REASONABLY THE TWO 
BUT OF COURSE THEY ARE L IT'S NOT ORIGINAL AT ALL 
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO THAT EXACTLY 
NO I'VE NO IDEA 
RIGHT 
TRUE RIGHT 
FOR ONE FOR AURORA WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THAT 
YEAH BUT WE DIDN'T DO ANY SPEECH RECON RE RECONSTRUCTION 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH SURE 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YOU MEAN WITH THIS PHASE UH USER 
YEAH 
YEAH THEY DO SOME KIND OF RECONSTRUCTION OF SPEECH 
OH YEAH 
RIGHT 
THAT'S TRUE YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
YEP 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SURE YEAH 
OKAY 
SO HOW ABOUT YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU MEAN LIKE CHANNEL AND SOURCE CODING TOGETHER 
OR NO 
WELL I CAN IMAGINE KIND OF LIKE J. PEG OPERATIONS 
WHICH MIGHT BE MORE LESS LIKE IT'S SOURCE CODING AND THEN WE ALSO CHANNEL CODING BECAUSE WE JUST SMOOTH THE OR JUST I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
OR RIGHT RIGHT 
I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT IS CHANNEL CODING LIKE THOSE HUFFMAN CODING STUFF AND YOU KNOW 
I MEAN IT'S JUST STANDARD 
YEAH 
THEY'RE JUST STANDARD TECHNIQUES 
BUT 
YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH YEAH 
I THINK SO 
OH YEAH 
AND 
OKAY 
THANK YOU GUYS 
UH IF YOU FIND SOME GOOD PAPER WHICH YOU MIGHT 
THERE WAS THAT FAM FAM WAVEFORM PRO PROTOTYPING COR 
YOU CAN WRITE ON THE PAPER YEAH 
IT'S IT'S OKAY 
RIGHT 
RIGHT RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
OKAY 
I HAVE A QUESTION 
SO THE SCALE LINEAR OR IS MEL SCALE LIKE AN M. F. C. C. 
SO IT BAR SCALE LIKE IN LIKE IN SP YEAH OKAY 
THE OVERLAPPING IS DIFFERENT RIGHT 
YEP 
MM 
OKAY AND 
OKAY 
UH UH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING 
YEAH TRI BAND G. S. M. YEAH 
DIFFERENT FREQUENCY 
YEAH EXACTLY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
TRUE 
MM 
MM-HMM 
I'VE NEVER DONE ANY CODING IN MY LIFE 
SO I JUST HAVE ONE CURIOSITY 
SO THIS IS CODING THEN AS YOU CODE THE SPEECH THEN YOU'RE ALSO SUPPOSED TO TRANSMIT THE SPEECH RIGHT 
THE LET'S SAY ONE G. S. M. OR SOMETHING ELSE 
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS DOING SOME IMAGE PROCESSING THERE WERE TECHNIQUES FOR COMPRESSING AND THEN CODING 
SO ADDING CHANNEL INFORMATION ON THE IMAGE AT THE SAME TIME IN ORDER TO SAVE SOUND BITS 
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
EXACTLY 
I D WAS JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S SOME S SOMEONE WAS DOING IT WITH SPEECH AS WELL 
WELL ACTUALLY WHEN YOU COMPRESS YEAH ALL LIKE FIRST YOU COMPRESS THE SIGNAL RIGHT 
AND THEN YOU AL YOU ADD COM SOME COMPLEXITY TO THE SIGNAL IN ORDER TO RECOVER THE ERROR 
SO I WAS WONDERING IF BY ANY CHANCE THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN SPEECH WITH THE SPEECH 
YOU DON'T KNOW 
OKAY 
WELL IT'S NOT THE MOST DIFFICULT RIGHT 
SURE SURE 
AND AND THIS WAS THE PROBLEM ACTUALLY BECAUSE YOU WERE 
NO NOT NOT IN G. S. M. DEFINITELY DEFINITELY NOT 
OH 
OKAY 
THEN THE THEY SOME YOU KNOW SOURCE 
SO YEAH 
OKAY 
JUST ONE 
YEAH 
DEFINITELY 
SO IT GOOD 
OKAY 
OKAY THANK YOU 
WITH THE LAPEL 
SO W I THINK WE ORGANISE UH JUST TO TO DISCUSS UH 
TO DISCUSS UH YEAH THE PROJECT ALEXANDRE AND UH JEAN MARC UH PROPOSED 
A BIT UH CAPTURING UH AUDIO VIDEO AND SLIDE UH IN A SYNCHRONIZED WAY 
AND SO WE WILL START WITH UH AN INTRODUCTION 
UH I THINK OLIVIER PREPARED SOME SLIDES BUT UH REVIEWING UH 
CURRENT SYSTEMS 
AND UM 
AND THEN EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE MANY THINGS TO TO TALK ABOUT 
JUST TO TO START DISCUSSING ABOUT CLEARLY THE PROJECT AND ALSO UM DEALING WITH OUR KIND OF TIMING CONSTRAINTS 
AND UH 
THE U. I. S. A. UH U. S. B. CORD DOESN'T WORK 
AND YOU DIDN'T PUT IN THE 
MAYBE YOU CAN ACCESS THROUGH THE NETWORK 
IF IT'S IN YOUR H. 
OR IT'S AN UH YOUR D. MACHINE 
SO MAYBE WE WE WE WILL BE ABLE TO 
SHOULD WORK 
WHAT 
SO UM W YEAH WE HAD LIKE FIVE SLIDES Y UH PRESENTING DIFFERENT SYSTEMS 
AND MAYBE MAYBE YOU WE CAN DO THAT AT THE WHITE BOARD 
I IT'S A BIT STUPID 
BUT UH Y YOU KNOW 
I THINK YOU REMEMBER WELL THE DIFFERENT UH PARTS 
AND UH I'M SURE UH WE CAN DO THAT AT THE WHITE BOARD 
YEAH IT WOULD BE GREAT TO USE THE WHITE BOARD 
SO THE THE THE FIRST ONE IS UH SMAC 
OKAY 
YEAH MAYBE YEAH 
JUST A REVIEW OF CURRENT SYSTEMS UH TO INTRODUCE 
WELL CHEAP MEETING ROOM IS THE YOU KNOW MM IT'S A CONFERENCE ROOM 
OR 
YEAH 
OOPS 
ALEXANDRE 
OOPS 
YEAH 
P PAS PROJECT 
SMART MEDIAT UH SMART MINUTES BUT UH I THI DIVA 
BECAUSE A SMA YEAH SMART MINUTE IS ALL THE PROCESS OF CAPTURING THE MINUTES AUTOMATICALLY 
BUT IT'S DIVA WE CAN SAY 
FOUR 
MM 
DOESN'T MATTER 
YEAH 
AND THIS THE THREE OF THESE ARE THE V THE THE VIDEO 
AND UH I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT THIS C I THINK IT'S QUITE AMBITIOUS PROJECT BECAUSE IT'S WITH UH THE CERN 
AND THEY W THEY UH ALREADY WORKED ON UH A EUROPEAN PROJECT CALLED INDICO WHERE THEY THEY HAVE UH ROLES 
DELIVER A FULL UM KIND OF CONFERENCE UH UH SOFTWARE 
AND UH TO TO MANAGE UH ALL THE THE CONFERENCE ASPECTS UH UH WE HAVE IN A CONFERENCE AUTOMATICALLY 
AND UH I KNOW THAT AT FRIBOURG THEY INSTALLED UH ALREADY IN IN A IN A BIG UH AMPHITHEATRE FOR STUDENTS 
AND I GUESS IT'S CURRENTLY WORKING 
OH NO 
THERE JUST TO UH IN PARENTHESES UH WE DIDN'T CHOOSE THAT UM THAT SOLUTION BECAUSE THEY HAD IN UM THE THE SLIDES WERE NOT CAPTURED VERY UH IN A VERY UH PRECISE WAY 
THAT'S THE POINT 
OKAY 
OTHERWISE THEY UH IT'S FULLY AUTOMATIC 
OR HAVE HAVE YOU DISCUSSED WITH THEM 
DID YOU DISCUSS THAT 
SO IT FULLY AUTOMATIC 
YOU DON'T KNOW 
OKAY 
BUT THE P I 
BUT I I IT ALL SYNCHRONIZE AND I SEE IT DOING ALL WHAT WE WANT BUT WITHOUT THE SLIDE UH PRECISION 
OKAY YEAH 
YEAH 
AND UH OKAY 
AND WE ARE S AND WE ARE SURE THAT IN THAT UH CONTEXT OF SMAC PROJECT WITH UH UM FRIBOURG WORKING ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS UH THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH PRECISION UN ENOUGH RESOLUTION IN THE SLIDES 
MM YEAH 
OKAY 
TALK CONFERENCE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
IT C TO CAPTURE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS 
MM-HMM 
SO YOU YOU WOULD YOU C YOU CAN UH LINK LIKE THIS 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
TAPE FREE 
TAPE FREE 
D. V. TAPE FREE 
YES 
MM-HMM 
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU THEY USE MORE OR LESS ON T. N. O. ALSO 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE UH TAPES 
BUT WITH DIFFERENT CARDS 
THEY HAD SOMETHING 
FOR THE AMI PROJECT 
HMM 
YEAH 
BECAUSE THE SYNCHRONIZATION PROBLEM COMES FROM THE THE GRABBING FROM THE D. V. TAPE IN AN IDEA IN D. VIX 
SO IT'S AFTERWARDS 
MM 
OH NO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE YEAH 
MM THEY DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH FUN GRABBING 
THE PROBLEM IS WAS THAT IT WAS NOT SYNCHRONIZED 
SO THE TIME CODE WAS WRONG FOR FOR THE DIFFERENT VIDEOS 
THEY HAD THE UH UH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO YOU IF YOU SAW THE TIME CODE IT WAS SIX HOURS NI UH FIFTY MINUTES 
AND UH THREE FOUR HOURS THIRTY TWO MINUTES 
SO IT'S IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TIME CODE 
WELL THAT'S WHAT THEY DID UH MANUALLY AFTER THE AFTERWARDS 
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH FRAME DROPS IN FACT 
NO THEY DO YEAH YEAH YEAH I'M SURE 
BECAUSE 
WELL IT'S MANUAL TO TO SYNCHRONIZE AT THE FORM 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT THEY DID 
NO NO BECAUSE UH WE DID THE SOFTWARE HERE AND IT THEY DIDN'T EACH ONE OR UH SOFTWARE 
PACKET 
AND THIS IS NO NO NO 
AND THIS IS DONE AT THE UM YOU HAVE LIBRARIES 
ET ET CETERA TO TO CHOO WELL UH A ALL YOU YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT UH ASKING ABOUT BAND WIDTH ET CETERA 
AT THE WHEN YOU UH YOU USE A SYSTEM UM HARDWARE 
YEAH YEAH 
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO CODE ALL THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS ET CETERA 
SO JUST FOR EXPLANATION 
MM-HMM 
YES 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SO WE NEED UH WELL THIS IS WILL BE DONE TOGETHER TO LOOK ON IT TO TRY TO DIVIDE THE TIME UH WHAT DO WE DO 
UM WE WE DON'T WANT TODAY TO TO PUT DEADLINES YOU KNOW 
BUT UM WHAT WE HAVE WHAT WE CAN DO AND HOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO 
I WAS THINKING UH FOR INSTANCE UH IN THE ON WHAT WE HAVE UM UH BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT UM USING UH LIKE UH D. L. L. 
M. F. C. UH UH MICROSOFT SOFTWARE 
BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO TO GO WITH THAT 
AND UH SO WHAT WE HAVE UNTIL NOW IS THE SOFTWARE THAT DARREN DID FOR THE FRAME GRABBING 
AND AND ACTUALLY I C UM I CAN START PLAYING AND UH LOOKING AT THE THIS UH IN DETAIL 
SO DARREN SOFTWARE 
BUT UM FRAME GRABBING 
SUP I SUPPOSE M. F. C. C. ONE UH NOT M. F. C. C. ABOUT M. E M. F. C. 
YOU HEARD OF THAT 
AND UH D. L. L. ET CETERA 
THE ALL THE WINDOWS UH UH PRO PROGRAMMING 
UM SO THIS IS AN UH STEP 
THEN UM THE AUDIO VIDEO CARD UM SO SO UH FIRST UH WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS 
TO LOOK AT THE DEMOS THAT ARE UH I WITH THE WHAT THEY CALL THE S. D. K. UH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT 
UH DEMOS TEST 
UM TESTING THE CARD WITH UH ONLY AN IDEA FOR INSTANCE AND THEN ONLY ONE VIDEO 
AND E EVEN UH TESTING WITH ONLY THE SLIDES UH TO CAPTURE ALL THE UH LIKE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING THE THE S UH THE VIDEO IS UH STREAM 
WELL SLIDE STREAM 
THE FORM 
YOU MEAN THE FRAME GRABBING CARD 
YEAH 
THEY HAVE S. D. K. UH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT THAT IS BASED ON UH M. F. C. LIBRARIES AND C. PLUS PLUS LIBRARIES 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO ONCE YOU WE'VE TESTED THE INDIVIDUALLY THE CARD WE CAN TEST TO SYNCHRONIZE THE AUDIO AND THE VIDEO TOGETHER 
OR IS IT IN IT'S SYNCHRONIZED 
OR OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
AND THE I TH NOW WE ARE 
SO YOU SAID UH WHAT NOT NOW BUT UH THE NEXT POINT WOULD BE IT IS THAT CARD WITH THE OTHER CARD AND TO MERGE THE SLIDE SIGNAL WITH THE 
WELL UM THE S UH YEAH THE SYNCHRONIZATION SIGNAL COMING FROM THE FRAME GRABBING CARD 
IT'S UH IT'S IT'S NOT A SYNCHRONIZATION SIGNAL IT'S A SLIDE WITH A IT 
OUI OUI 
YEAH WE WILL 
AND SO SO IT EXTERNAL TO THIS CARD 
IT'S EXTERNAL 
OR IT'S I 
SO IT'S EXTERNAL 
IT'S NOT IN THIS UH CARD 
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO BUY THAT 
OR WELL UH TO TO UH AT LEAST THE BASIC 
OKAY 
AND THAT WILL WILL UH WILL BE WILL HELP US TO SYNCHRONIZE THE THIS FRAME GRABBING CARD AND THIS VIDEO CARD 
SO UH IT YEAH WE NEED TO DO SOME TESTS 
READING AND YEAH 
OKAY 
AND THEN WHEN WE HAVE OKAY 
WHERE DO WE DO THAT 
UH WE DON'T KNOW YET WITH FRANK IF WE INSTALL THIS CARD MAYBE HERE 
OKAY AND AT IDIAP IT'S POSSIBLE THERE 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
WELL IN MY MACHINE HIS MACHINE OR THIS MACHINE MAYBE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
ISSUE 
SO YEAH 
UH UH MM 
YEAH CHRISTMAS TWO SEVEN 
NO NO 
UM YEAH THAT'S GOOD QUESTION 
YEAH ALEXANDRE DID NOT CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE WAY UH Y I NO NO NO BUT UH YOU ARE MORE IN RESEARCH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY I USED TO THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING THAT MM UH WELL WE'RE NOT DO DOING DEADLINES 
BUT UH YEAH 
MM YEAH 
NO NO 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YOU WILL WE WOULD LIKE BOTH IT 
BECAUSE WE ARE ALSO BOTH UH QUITE BUSY WITH OTHER PROJECTS OF COURSE 
UH E H. F. I. S. DATABASE UH WITH J. FERRET UH 
OKAY THIS IS BETWEEN BOTH 
YEAH OF COURSE YEAH 
READY TO BE USED 
YEAH 
SO UH 
DATA 
MM-HMM 
YEAH W YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO YEAH 
LET'S SEE 
FROM FOR FOR CHECKING DARREN'S CODE ET CETERA WE CAN EXPECT UNTIL UH 
AND YEAH FOR O ONE MONTHS OR SO THEN UH THE UH TH I UH U. V. C. UH W WITH THE PEOPLE AT FRIBOURG HAVE UH YEAH 
OKAY SO UH AT FRIBOURG WE WE HAVE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
AND THEN THE DIRECT SHOW 
OR YEAH 
SO WE CAN SAY WE TRY TO TO MAKE SOMETHING FOR APRIL 
BUT UH WELL I I WANT THIS TO TO WORK ON THE FOR THE TIME UH IN THE MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
UH I MM-HMM 
THE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
O ONE STUDENT OR YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND WE CAN ASK HELP UH 
MM-HMM 
I IT'S TOO LATE IN TERMS OF RESEARCH UH MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO NO NO NO 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WE CANNOT WAIT UH WE WERE HERE IN YOUR G UH I DON'T KNOW 
AND ALSO WHEN IT'S WAS UH GOING UH THE IDEA WAS APPEARING AND 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
PERSONALLY I WANT TO BE INVOLVE IN THAT PROJECT 
A ACQUISI UH SOME MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WITH I. M. TWO I. P. ONE 
MM-HMM 
FIFTY PERCENT IN AN I. M. TWO THAT'S IT 
IT'S FIFTY PERCENT NO 
AN I. M. TWO I. P. ONE 
OKAY MAYBE ONE FIFTY PERCENT UH IN THAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WHY THIS WAS YEAH UM YEAH W I DON'T WANT TO TALK TOO MUCH MAYBE 
UH BUT UH WITH SEBASTIEN SORRY THIS WAS MAYBE UH HIS CONCERN 
AND YEAH BASTIEN IS BUSY WITH UH ANNOTATIONS PLUS ALL KIND OF THINGS 
UH MAYBE WE CAN IN THE PROCESS WE CAN ASK FOR 
SOMEONE MORE 
TO WORK ON THAT 
WELL UH UH THAT'S WHAT I I WAS 
YOU 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO AND I BEFORE COMING HERE I JUST TRIED TO TO MAKE UH UH A PLAN 
BUT I DON'T ANSWER YEAH 
W WELL THE LET'S SAY UH APRIL O. SIX AND UH WE D UH OUR BEST WITH UH TRYING TO KEEP YOU INFORM WITH THE ADVANCEMENTS 
AND IF WE SEE EARLY THAT CLEARLY UH THERE I 
MM-HMM 
AND IT SHOULD BE SOMEONE WITH EXPERIENCE IN C. PLUS PLUS M. F. C. 
OH 
YEAH 
OR A STUDENT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO NO NO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL I WOULD LOOK AT IT TO WORK ON P KIND OF PART TIME UH UH W O YEAH 
YEAH 
AND ONE FULL DAY A WEEK 
AND I WOULD OKAY 
MAYBE YOU WON'T LIKE MY ANSWER BUT I WOULD SAY THAT UM WE EACH WE WE START BUT WE UH WE REALLY HAVE TO START IN WORKING WI UH READING ALL THE CODE FROM DARREN 
THEN THIS UM CARD WITH THE CODE I. V. C. CARD AND IT TO TRY THIS 
THEN WE TRY A LITTLE BIT DIRECT SHOW IT IS UM UH TO TO HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW HOW LONG UH THAT COULD BE 
AND THEN AT THE MOMENT WE CAN SAY OKAY WE NEED SOMEONE TO HELP US 
WELL WE UH LET'S DO THAT 
LET'S DO THAT 
OKAY 
IF 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM YEAH 
IT 
SO WITHOUT DIRECT SHOW YOU MEAN THE FRAME GRABBING SIGNAL AND TIME ALIGNMENT 
UH W THAT WOULD BE DONE UH IN LIKE IN COMMON SOFTWARE THAT WE HAVE UH AFTERWARDS 
OKAY THE AND THIS POINT IS ABOUT TESTING AND UH YEAH 
OKAY 
SO YOU COULD SAY OKAY LET'S FOR CHRISTMAS LET'S TRY THIS WITHOUT THE ALL THE SYNCHRONIZATION 
UH WITH DIRECT SHOW ISSUE 
OKAY UH YEAH YOU ARE YOU CANNOT OR O L UH BY DOING IN ONE DAY A WEEK MM YOU KNOW JUST I THINK THE CARDS 
OKAY 
ANYWAY THE RECORDING IS FINISHED I THINK 
YEAH 
SO I TRY MY BEST UNTIL JANUARY 
AND UM AND I TRY TO DO WHAT JEAN MARC UH DESCRIBED TO GIVE YOU A FIRST FEEDBACK ON THE DIFFERENT CARDS 
UH AND UH AND FROM THERE IT WOULD UM YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I WOULD SAY UH LET'S LET'S YEAH LET'S TRY TO HAVE AN UH STUDENTS UH TO HELP US IN THAT 
I DON'T KNOW 
THAT IS VERY WELL WE HAVE TO CHOOSE WHETHER THE STUDENTS IT'S TOO IT'D BE STUPID 
BUT UH UH THE THE STUDENT SHOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT M. F. C. WITH UH OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DO WE HAVE TO TO STOP TALKING YET 
BUT UH THE RECORDING HAS FINISHED 
SORRY 
I DON'T HAVE MY PRESENTATION 
UM 
YEAH 
SO THEY'RE IN MY THEY'RE IN A 
NO NO 
THEY ARE 
YEAH 
NO NO 
MY D. MACHINE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
JUST GOING 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO UH UH YEAH 
I WILL DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OKAY 
SO UH I WOULD LIKE JUST TO REVIEW AT THE DIFFERENT PROJECT REGARDING ACQUISITION SYSTEM 
SO BASICALLY THERE ARE FIVE SYSTEMS 
THE FIRST ONE IS CALLED SMAC WHICH IS DEVELOPED BY FRIBOURG AND CERN 
THE SECOND ONE I SEE YOUR SYSTEM 
UH I WOULD TO SAY THE CHIP MEETING ROOM SYSTEM 
THE THIRD ONE YEAH MAYBE I CAN SHARE THAT WITH YOU 
THE SMAC YEAH 
SHOULD I WROTE 
OKAY 
THE FIRST ONE IS YEAH I WILL CALL THAT A. 
SMAC WHICH IS DEVELOP BY FRIBOURG AND CERN 
THE SECOND ONE B. 
WHICH IS UH I WOULD LIKE TO CHE SAY UH CHIP UH MEETING ROOM OR I DON'T KNOW 
OKAY 
P. U. S. 
OKAY P. U. S. 
THE THIRD ONE IS UM 
OKAY 
THE THIRD ONE IS CALLED UH THE SO UM THIS IS UH THE SMART MEETING ROOM DEVELOP AT FRIBOURG WHICH IS CALLED THE SMART 
IT'S DIVA 
OKAY 
THE P DIVA 
D. A. V. I. SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THE THIRD ONE IS CALL UH THE THIRD ONE IS UH THE PROJECT THAT I HAVE TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT SMART MEETING ROOM AT IDIAP 
UH FOR THAT WE WILL USE UM UH 
YEAH A TAPE THREE UH OKAY LET'S CALL THAT 
AND THE LAST ONE I WOULD LIKE JUST MENTION JUST TO FOR THE MEETING AND THIS IS UH THE FIRE WIRE 
UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW MY PRESENTATION DURING MY TURN 
YOU DID YOU 
OH OKAY 
I. WHICH IS FIREWIRE 
OKAY 
SO I WILL START JUST WITH THE SMAC 
SO MAYBE I DRAW LINE HERE 
SO THE SMAC 
THE SMAC PROJECT THE SMAC PROJECT IS A PROJECT WHICH AIMS TO DO THE ACQUISITION OF AUDIO VIDEO AND SLIDE UH FOR PRESENTATION 
YEAH THIS PROJECT IS DONE WITH FRIBOURG AND CERN 
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE A VERY SHORT UM GRAPHIC 
IN FACT THEY USE UM 
A CARD A VIDEO CARD WHICH IS CALL UM U. V. C. MM YEAH 
I JUST WRITE I. V. C. 
IN FACT THIS IS A VIDEO CARD WITH FOR UM INPUTS 
NO THOSE FOUR INPUTS YOU CAN HAVE ONLY VIDEO 
BUT UH THEY WANT TO MAKE ALSO THE SLIDE ACQUISITION 
SO NO NO INPUT THEY PUT UM A CONVERSION BOX A CONVERTER WHICH CONVERTS FROM SLIDE 
TO VIDEO 
SO THAT MEAN THAT WE DECREASE UH THE THE QUALITY 
WE HAVE A HIGH QUALITY ONE SLIDE AND WE GO TO LOW QUALITY TO LOWER QUALITY WITH UH VIDEO 
UM SO THIS ONE IS JUST FOR THE SMAC 
NOW I WILL JUST MOVE 
DO 
YEAH 
THIS ONE OR JUST FOR VIDEO AND DO 
YOU CAN USE UH THEM 
AND THIS BOARD DOES UH THE DIVX COMPRESSION ON THE FLY 
THIS IS UH THE BOX THAT WE HAVE ON THE TABLE 
THE THE CARD THAT WE HAVE ON THE TABLE 
UH I THINK 
MM 
OKAY 
SO THE SOLUTION TO THAT LOW QUALITY IS UH SOLVED B BY YOU PROJECT THE PAS PROJECT 
UH UH I MAKE A TICK HERE AND I CLEAN UP THIS IS JUST TO TO SOLVE THAT PRO THAT PROBLEM REGARDING THE SLIDE AND THE SLIDE RESOLUTION 
SO WE REMOVE UH THAT PART 
AND WE CALL THAT THE PAS 
AND ON THAT CASE WE USE UM A FRAME GRABBER HERE 
AND WE GO WITH THE SLIDE HERE 
AND UM OF COURSE THESE TWO CARDS WILL BE IN THE SAME MACHINE 
AND UH WE HAVE TO DEVELOP A SOLUTION HERE 
THE MAIN CRITICAL POINT IS HERE 
THE SYNCHRONISATION BETWEEN THESE TWO UH THESE TWO CARDS 
AND WITH THAT THIS IS THE CARD THAT WE USE IN THE SMART MEETING ROOM AND THIS IS UH THE CARD THE UM 
YEAH THIS ONE NO NO 
THE UH THIS ONE IS AND THIS IN THE VIDEO CARD 
AND THIS IN THIS IS UH THE CARD THAT WE HAVE ALREADY AT IDIAP FOR THE USUAL 
YEAH YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WE CAN HAVE BOTH 
WE CAN HAVE THE SLIDE FROM THE SLIDE CAPTURE AND WE CAN JUST USE UH A VIDEO SIGNAL TO TO CAPTURE THAT ALSO 
TO HAVE TWO TO UH MM YOU WANTS TO UH DO YOU HAVE TWO QUALITY H HIGH QUALITY AND 
YEAH WE CAN JUST TAKE SOME SNAPSHOTS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WITH UM THIS ONE 
SO YEAH YOU WON'T YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SOMETHING LIKE LIKE SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH YEAH 
CH YEAH 
VIDEO 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO UH I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PAS PROJECT 
MAYBE I WOULD LIKE JUST NOW TO TALK ABOUT THE DIVA PROJECT 
SO I CLEAN UP 
YEAH 
THERE 
UM DID YOU READ SOMETHING REGARDING THE DIVA PROJECT 
ONE OF YEAH UH WE JUST REMEMBER THAT HERE WE WE STILL HAVE ONLY ONE MACHINE TO DO UH THE SLIDE VIDEO AND AUDIO ACQUISITION 
AND THE DIVA IT WAS UH SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
FACT WE HAVE A MASTER MACHINE THAT'S ME 
WE HAVE A MASTER MACHINE HERE 
AND WE HAVE SOME SLAVES MACHINE HERE 
WE HAVE SOME CONNECTION AND HERE WE HAVE SOME INPUT 
WE HAVE AUDIO 
USUALLY WE HAVE AUDIO 
AND 
AND THE SAME FOR THIS ONE 
AND UM BASICALLY IN THE SLAVE MACHINE WE HAVE TWO CARDS ONE FOR AUDIO AND ONE FOR VIDEO 
SO THEY DEVELOP SOMETHING TO SYNCHRONIZE THESE TWO CARDS TOGETHER AND THE UH THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH IS IT'S MORE W WHICH IS CALL UH DIRECT SHOW 
UH WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO TO SYNCHRONIZE UH THESE TWO CARDS TOGETHER 
AND BUT OF COURSE YOU WANT THESE TWO STREAMS TO BE SYNCHRONIZE 
BUT YOU WANT ALSO THOSE TWO STREAMS TO BE SYNCHRONIZED 
SO THEY HAVE A SYNCHRONIZATION BETWEEN TWO SLAVES WHICH IS DONE BY THE MASTER 
HERE WE JUST USE UH THE ET ETHERNET NETWORK TO SYNCHRONIZE UH THESE TWO UM THESE TWO DEVICE 
UM I JUST WRITE 
INTERNET SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND UH THEY DO ONLY AUDIO AND VIDEO 
UH THEY DON'T DO ANY SLIDE 
UM 
SLIDE ACQUISITION YEAH 
OKAY 
SO YVES ASKED FOR THE DIVA 
I WOULD LIKE JUST TO TALK NOW REGARDING UH THE THE FOR FREE SMART MEETING ROOM AT IDIAP 
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION 
OR UH 
WHAT YEAH TAPE FREE SORRY 
TAPE FREE SMART MEETING ROOM 
SO FOR THAT I 
YEAH 
IT'S YEAH 
IT'S A TAPE FREE BUT ALSO VIDEO 
UH AND THE ACQUISITION IS DONE IN RAW VIDEO 
SO THE FILE IS HUGE AND THEY REALLY NEED UH UM THEY HAVE A LONG POST PROCESSING TO CONVERT RAW FILE TO UH DIVX OR AT OUR OWN FILES 
YEAH BUT IT TAKES TIME 
IT IT'S JUST JUST TO MENTION THAT 
UH SO 
I WILL WRITE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
SO MAYBE FIRST I WILL JUST DESCRIBE THE UM THE SMART MEETING ROOM THAT WE HAVE AT IDIAP 
IN FACT WE HAVE UH ALSO A MASTER SLAVE ARCHITECTURE 
UM I CLEAN A LITTLE BIT 
WE HAVE THE MASTER P. C. WHICH TAKE KS UH WHICH TAKES CARE ABOUT THE IDEA 
I CLEAN THAT 
AND WE HAVE THE SLAVE P. C. WHICH TAKE CARES ABOUT THE WHITE BOARD AND THE SLIDES 
NOW IF WE LOOK AT THE VIDEO 
IF WE LOOK AT THE VIDEO IN FACT UM YEAH MAYBE FIRST I SHOULD MENTION THAT 
BETWEEN THE MASTER AND THE SLAVE WE HAVE UM THE MM A SYNCHRONIZATION SIGNAL WHICH IS CALL TIME MIDI TIME CODE 
I JUST WRITE MIDI 
AND FOR THE VIDEO WE HAVE THE VIDEO INPUT HERE 
WE ARE IS THE UM MIDI SIGNAL 
UH WITH ME TO INSERT THE TIME CODE ON EACH FRAME 
AND WE SAVE THAT IT D. V. RECORDER 
UH I I HAVE VIDEO 
OKAY 
UH WE KNOW THE PROBLEM OF THAT THAT UH THIS IS THAT AFTER EACH MEETING SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE CARE ABOUT THE D. V. TAPES AND IT TO CONVERT THEM INTO DIVX 
SO MY IDEA IS TO DO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS TO DEVELOP A S UM 
UM UH A VIDEO SLAVE MACHINE 
MY I SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH A VIDEO SLAVE MACHINE UH WHICH IS THE MIDI UM WHICH IS ALSO THE MIDI TIME CODE 
NO SORRY 
SORRY I'M DOING SOMETHING WRONG 
WE HAVE THE VIDEO HERE 
WE JUST HAVE THE TIME CODE INSERTER 
SO WE TAKE THAT SIGNAL HERE AND WE MOVE TO THIS UH MACHINE HERE WHICH IS IN FACT JUST UH THE U. V. C. VIDEO CARD 
THIS JUST AN ACQUISITION CARD 
AND WE COME AND WE USE AND WE CONVERT FILE DIRECTLY TO DIVX 
AND UM SO WE WILL HAVE HERE VIDEO 
AND ALSO BECAUSE WE WANT TO CONTROL THAT MACHINE WE USE ALSO THE MIDI TIME CODE THE MIDI TIME CODE TO START AND TO STOP THE MACHINE 
THIS IS JUST SOMETHING UH THAT UH THIS JUST TO REMOVE THE D. V. RECORDINGS 
BUT UM YEAH 
JUST UH THIS JUST AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE SMART MEETING ROOM 
OKAY 
UH DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION UH REGARDING UH THAT 
YEAH 
WE DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT THE SYNCHRONIZATION IN THAT CASE BECAUSE THE TIME CODE IS INS SERTED HERE 
AND WE TAKE AFTER THE TIME CODE INSERTION WE TAKE THE VIDEO SIGNAL AND WE PASS THROUGH THE MACHINE 
SO UH THIS IS UH A SIMPLE SOLUTION BUT UM WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT THE SYNCHRONIZATION 
C YEAH 
THE SYNCHRONIZATION IS YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO THE F LAST ONE IS UH THE FIRE WIRE ACQUISITION 
UH I JUST 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM IN FACT THE THE MAJOR PROBLEM REGARDING ACQUISITION SYSTEM IS ALWAYS THE SYNCHRONIZATION 
AND FOR THAT FIRE WIRE IS GOOD 
I MEAN FIRE WIRE WAS A PROJECT 
NOW THE PROJECT IS UH STAND BY 
UH WE DON'T MOVE TO THAT PROJECT 
I UM BUT I AM JUST GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS ONE 
UM SO WITH ACQUISITION WITH ACQUISITION SYSTEMS UH THE MAJOR PROBLEM THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS UH THE SYNCHRONIZATION 
AND FIRE WIRE GIVES YOU SOME UM SOME WAY TO BE SYNCHRONIZE IN FACT 
UH THIS IS UH I JUST WANT TO TO DESCRIBE HERE THE BASE 
THIS UH YEAH THIS IS OF THE BUS WHERE YOU CAN SEND YOU CAN SEND SOME PACKAGE 
AND ANY DEVICE W WHICH WANTS TO SEND A PACKAGE A P A PACKET SORRY SHOULD ASK ME THERE IS A MANAGER OF THAT BUS 
THIS JUST OF THE BASE 
ANY DEVICE WHICH WANTS TO SEND A PACKET HAS TO R IT OR 
UH REQUIRE SOME UH BAND WIDTH ON THE BASE IN THE BASE 
AND SO AFTER THAT UH WILL HAVE THAT BAND WIDTH 
AND UH WILL ALWAYS HAVE THAT BAND WIDTH 
SO UM YEAH UH WILL ALWAYS HAVE THAT BAND WIDTH 
AND SO WE ARE SURE THAT WE WILL HAVE A SYNCHRONIZE ACQUISITION WITH FIRE WIRE 
AND SO SO THAT MEAN THAT UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SORRY SORRY 
OH YEAH 
HARDWARE 
IT'S I IT'S DONE BY IT'S DONE BY HARDWARE 
IT'S DONE BY HARDWARE 
NO NO NO NO NO 
AND IN FACT YEAH 
I I SEE I MENTIONED BEFORE WE HAVE A BUS MANAGER AND THE BUS MANAGER SEND JUST A FLAG TO SAY NOW IT'S TIME TO GIVE ME YOU DATA 
AND ALL DEVICES WHICH HAVE UH REQUIRED SOME BAND WIDTH WILL SEND THE DATA 
SO I'M JUST DRAWING SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THIS IS THIS KIND OF SIGNAL THAT THE THE BUS MANAGER IS SENDING 
AND JUST AFTER THAT BAS JUST AFTER THAT UH SIGNAL ALL DEVICE WILL SEND UH THE DATA 
SO WE WILL HAVE THE DATA FROM A. FROM B. AND FROM C. AND SO NO 
AND AFTER THE NEXT ONE WE WILL HAVE AGAIN THE UM 
THE DATA FROM A. B. AND C. AND SO ON AND SO NO 
AND SO WITH FIRE WIRE WE ARE EASIER TO HAVE A UM AN ACQUISITION SYSTEM 
NOW THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH FIRE WIRE IS THAT THAT FIRE WIRE IS JUST ONE KIND OF INTELLIGENT UH A SMART PIPE 
A SYNCHRONIZED PIPE 
WE CAN PUT WHAT WE WANT INSIDE 
SO WE CAN PUT RAW DATA ARE WE CAN SEND A DIVX DATA 
ARE WE CAN SEND ALSO UH WHAT I UH WAS PRESENTING IN MY TERM PRESENTATION WAS A H. TWO SIX FOUR 
BUT IN THAT CASE WE NEED SOMETHING UH HARDWARE HERE TO UNCODE RAW DATA AT A GIVEN FORMAT 
OF COURSE UH THE IDEA IS TO REDUCE UM THE BAND WIDTH ON THE BUS ALSO 
AND ALL DATA ARE SENT THROUGH THE MASTER 
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUEST 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UH IN FACT THE UM SLIDE CARD L SORRY 
THE SLIDE CARD AND THE VIDEO CARD ARE BOTH S. D. K. 
SO WHAT 
YEAH 
BOTH ARE S. D. K. 
YEAH 
YEAH Y YEAH 
YEAH THIS FOR THAT YOU UH I DON'T REMEMBER BY HOW 
NO 
BUT 
USUALLY AUDIO AUDIO AND VIDEO SHOULD BE SYNCHRONIZED 
BECAUSE UH THIS JUST AN AN AN AUDIO VIDEO CHANNEL 
SO UH THEY ARE SYNCHRONIZE 
UM SO WE CAN PLAY WITH THE VIDEO 
WE CAN PLAY WITH THE SLIDE 
UH AND AFTER THAT AND THE MAJOR POINT IS IT M COMBINE BOTH 
YEP 
WE WE DON'T HAVE SYNCHRONIZATION 
WE HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION AND FOR THAT MIGHT BE WE CAN USE UH DIRECT SHOW 
WHICH IS A SYN WHICH IS A TECHNIQUE TO SYNCHRONIZE DIFFERENT DEVICE 
NO NO 
THIS IS JUST UH AN APPLICATION WHICH I 
NO NO NO NO NO 
NO 
THIS NOT IN THE CARD 
THIS JUST AN APPLICATION THAT RUNS ON THE MACHINE 
UM IF I THINK DIRECT SHOW YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FOR FOR 
I'M I'M NOT SURE 
UM I SHOULD CHECK 
OR 
YEAH IT UM YEAH 
I THINK THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO HAVE A MACHINE JUST WHICH IS ONLY DEDICATED TO TO THAT 
BECAUSE UH IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU USE A MACHINE WHICH HAS BEEN ALREADY USED FOR SOMETHING ELSE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE PLENTY OF LIBRARIES 
AND SO YOU YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY 
MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE JUST A DEDICATED MACHINE JUST FOR THAT 
JUST FOR 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
I I OUI 
BECAUSE 
BECAUSE I THINK UM THE VIDEO IS DONE THE VIDEO COMPRESSION IS DONE IN THE ON THAT CARD AND UH I'M NOT HUNDRED PERCENT SURE 
BUT I THINK THE J. PEG THE J. PEG CONVERSION FOR THE SLIDE CAPTURE IS DONE ALSO IN THE CARD 
SO WE DON'T NEED 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT I MEAN YEAH 
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THE THE SPEED OF THE COMPUTER COULD BE LOWER 
MAYBE A FIRST IS SOLUTION WILL BE JUST TO START W WITH 
BECAUSE WE NEED TO START WITH SOMETHING 
WE HAVE THE SLIDE CAPTURE FROM DARREN 
WE HAVE UM I WILL WORK ON THE VIDEO ACQUISITION FOR THE INPU THE TAPE FREE SMART MEETING ROOM 
SO I WILL START WITH THAT TO DEVELOP SOME KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THAT BOARD UH THAT VIDEO BOARD AND AFTER THAT WE CAN COMBINE BOTH 
NO 
FOR NOT FOR NO NO 
THIS NOT FOR END OF NEXT YEAR 
IT'S TOO LONG 
AND IT IT'S UH IT'S TOO LONG IT'S TOO LONG 
FOR MYSELF I WOULD LIKE TO SAY UH APRIL MAY 
APRIL MAY WE SHOULD HAVE RESULTS 
OH NO NO NO 
UH I MEAN THE UM 
UH NOT AL ALMOST UH THE UH THE THE UH THE COMPLETE APPLICATION 
MAYBE SOME MINOR WILL APPEARS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
UH THEY HAVE 
YEAH TH IT'S A YEAH 
BUT WE START WITH THE U. V. C. 
WE START WITH THE DATA PATH 
UH THE THE SLIDE FRAME GRABBER 
AND AFTER THAT IS AND THE QUESTION IS HOW TO SYNCHRONI TO TO TO MAKE BOTH CARD WORKING TOGETHER 
YEAH 
UH U. V. C. I. V. C. SHOULD GO FASTER 
YEAH 
I WILL UH I'M NOT CURRENTLY WORKING ON IT 
I WILL START TO WORK ON JANUARY ON THAT POINT 
SO UH BUT I THINK 
NO NO 
I'M NOT WORKING 
I SCHEDULE TO TO WORK ON THAT FROM UM 
YEAH 
BUT I HAVE ALSO A Q 
MAYBE 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY UH THERE SO MANY UNKNOWN IN THAT PROJECT 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WE CAN MAKE UH UH A SCHEDULE OF THAT PROJECT TO JUST TO TRACK TO JUST TO SEE IF WE TRACK THE TIME TABLE 
IF WE DON'T WE WE ASKS FOR MORE PEOPLE MAYBE H. U. V. S. PEOPLE 
IT TO TO BE SLIGHTLY INVOLVED IN THAT PROJECT TO BE TO TO RESPECT THE DATA 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH 
IT'S TOO LONG 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT UH AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE SOME OTHER PROJECT I I WANT TO FINISH UH THIS PROJECT FIRST 
BUT FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE UH I RECEIVE SOME NEW PROJECT 
I SAID THAT I HAVE ONE TIME YET 
I SAY I HAVE ONE TIME GI NOW CURRENTLY I AM I SAY SOME FOR SOME PROJECT YOU SAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME 
BUT PEOPLE WILL STAY WILL CONTINUE TO SAY NO NO YOU WILL FIND TIME JUST TO DO THAT PROJECT 
THE 
YEAH 
CURRENTLY BUT UH UP TO DECEMBER I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WORK ON IT 
BUT I PLAN ALREADY 
I I AM WITH I. M. TWO I I I DID UH I MENTION THAT I WILL HAVE FROM JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX I WILL HAVE TIME FOR THAT 
UH I HAVE A 
NO I WILL WORK FULLY ON THAT IN THIS POINT 
FROM JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX I W 
MAYBE A GOOD THING WILL BE TO MAKE A PLAN TO TO WE SAY WE WE WON'T SET THE DEADLINE HERE 
WE ARE HERE 
WE SPLIT THAT PART IN DIFFERENT SEGMENTS 
UH YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH TH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO 
NO NO NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHICH IS REALLY BAD 
YEAH 
I I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
NO I UNDERSTAND 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
WHAT 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK YEAH THAT WILL BE GOOD JUST TO HAVE A PLAN AND TO HAVE SOME DEADLINE IN THAT PLAN 
AND AS SOON AS WE WE WE AS SOON AS WE WE WE ARE NOT IN TIME WE WE WE CAN 
YEAH 
YEAH AND TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM LIKE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND WE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH IF I IF I SAY UNTIL JANUARY THIS IS JUST TO FINISH 
UH I WANT TO HAVE THE DEADLINE AT END OF DECEMBER TO FINISH ALL MY PROJECT 
I WANT TO FINISH ALL THIS PROJECT WHEN EVERYTHING IS FINISHED 
AFTER THAT I CAN MOVE TO ANOTHER ONE 
BUT I DON'T WANT IT 
YEAH 
NO 
NO 
UH I I DON'T KNOW REGARDING H. U. V. S. 
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS UH STILL IN TIME 
BUT YOU CAN HAVE YOU CAN ASK FOR A STUDENT A D A DIPLOMA WORK 
THE SHOW MUST GO ON 
YOU CAN SAY THEN YOU 
IT I TH I THOUGHT IT WAS CALLED PAS SO I THINK JUST USE THIS 
OOPS 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
WELL I SUPPOSE UH I SUPPOSE THEY CAN CAPTURE THINGS RIGHT 
I MEAN DON'T SEE I DON'T SEE WHY YOU COULD NOT CAPTURE THE VIDEOS I MEAN WITH A CORD LIKE THIS 
I DON'T KNOW 
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW 
WELL AS FAR AS I AS FAR AS I KNOW I MEAN THEY DO OF COURSE THEY CAN DO OF COURSE SLIDE DETECTION 
CHANGE SLIDE CHANGE DETECTIONS WHICH UH OF COURSE WHAT I UNDERSTOOD IS ALSO THEY TRY TO RECOVER THE LAYOUT SOMEHOW 
I MEAN GIVEN THE SLIDES BUT THEY ARE IN IN CASE THEY ARE EXTRACTING THE TEXT FROM THE SLIDES 
SO WITH AN UH IN UH ALL THE CASES WHAT I'VE SEEN 
IN ALL THE CASES I'VE SEEN I MEAN THEY S ASSUME THAT AT LEAST YOU HAVE LIKE A P. D. F. VERSION OF THE DOCUMENT OR WHAT 
AND BASICALLY THEY TRY TO MATCH WHAT IS DISPLAYED 
AT THE DOCUMENT 
SO FIRST THEY NEED TO EXTRACT THE INFORMATION FROM THE DOCUMENT WHICH IS NOT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE SO TRIVIAL 
AT LEAST FOR UH BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO WORKING WITH UH MAYBE MORE COMPLEX DOCUMENTS WITH IMAGES AND TEXT AND SO NO 
MAYBE WITH SLIDES IT'S EA IT'S EASIER TO EXTRACT UH THE INFORMATION 
I ASSUME IT'S EA IT'S EASIER INDEED 
BUT THEY UH ASSUME BASICALLY UH THAT THEY HAVE THIS DOCUMENT 
WHICH IS SOMETHING SOMEHOW WE WOULD LIKE TO RELAX UH BECAUSE UH PEOPLE UH LIKE NO IT'S YOU MAY NOT WANT EACH TIME TO ASK THE PERSON 
MAYBE THE PERSON HAS A POINT POINT INTO THE INTO A P. D. F. VERSION 
OR MAYBE HE'S USING EXCEL TO DO A DEMONSTRATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND WE'LL WANT TO AVOID THIS 
MM 
MM 
BUT BUT MOST YOU WOULD SAY MOST MOST OF THE POINTS FOR US I MEAN WOULD BE VALID 
I MEAN SLIDE TRANSITION WE WOULD USE SLIDE UH NEED TO DO IT SLIDE TRANSITION 
AT SOME EXTENT WE WOULD LIKE TO EXTRACT SOME ELEMENTS OF THE LAYOUT TO DISTING TO HAVE A MORE HIGH ANALYSIS 
BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS MORE AUTOMATICALLY AND ONE PARTICULAR FOR THE TEXT RECOGNITION TO DO IT BE ABLE TO DO RETRIEVAL UH OF SLIDES OR POINTS 
I MEAN OF PARTS OF PRESENTATION 
WE WOULD LIKE NOT TO HAVE TO RELY YEAH IT A FIRST P. D. F. VERSION OR ANY VERSION OF THE DOCUMENT 
SO YEAH 
SO THE C YOU HAVE BOUGHT THIS CARD RIGHT 
I MEAN YOU SAY THIS IS A CARD 
NO NO 
YEAH 
BUT I MEAN THIS ONE IS THE U. V. C. 
OKAY 
SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY SO ON THIS CARD THERE ARE FOUR INPUTS RIGHT 
OKAY 
NOT ONE IS ENOUGH UH WELL YEAH YEAH 
I WAS THINKING TO SOME EXTENT NOTHING WOULD WOULD PREVENT US UH FROM ALSO ACQUIRING THE SLIDE BUT REALLY THE SLIDE STREAM FROM FROM THIS CARD INDEED 
RIGHT 
OR 
YEAH 
OKAY 
TO CAPTURE THE SLIDE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL 
I MEAN JUST BECAUSE WE CANNOT REC UH WE CAN WE SOMETHING WE CANNOT DO WITH UH IT SEEMS FOR WITH THE HIGH Q QUALITY UH CAPTURE UH DEVICE IS TO HAVE A STREAM 
I MEAN THE STREAM 
RIGHT THE FULL STREAM 
SO WE CAN TAPE SNAPSHOTS 
SO BASICALLY IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO HAVE STILL UM UH THE S UH THE SLIDE STREAM IS THAT FOR INSTANCE IF WE DETECT THERE IS A NEW VIDEO THAT IS DISPLAYED ALSO ON 
AT SOME EXTENT WE COULD JUST CUT THIS VIDEOS TO KEEP IT NEED TO BE ABLE TO REPLY TO UH LATER ON AND SO NO 
AND MAYBE INDEED F FOR INSTANCE THE SLIDE STREAM ON THE ON THE RIGHT SO AUTOMATICALLY SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE OTHER PARTS OF THE VIDEO 
IT MAY BE EASIER TO USE IT UH SYNCHRONIZE DIRECTLY BY SOME SOME MATCHING PROCESS 
THE SLIDES THE HIGH QUALITY MEASURES WE HAVE HERE WE'VE DIRECTLY YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH 
SO AT LEAST UH THIS IS NOT AT THE ELECTRONIC LEVEL 
BUT YOU WOULD SAY IS A CONTENTS FROM THE CONTENT LEVEL 
DOING AN ALIGNMENT FROM THE SLIDE STREAM AND FROM THE SNAP SHOTS WE WOULD HAVE ON THE OTHER SIDE WE USE SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE 
OF COURSE IF WE HAVE SOME YOU KNOW SOME CONSTRAINTS GIVEN BY THE ELECTRONIC I MEAN IT'S THAT'S BETTER 
UH BECAUSE OF COURSE FIRST THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE EASIER AND IT MAY BE JUST A FEW SIGNALS THAT WE HAVE TO ALIGN ON THE OTHER PARTS 
BUT I THINK I COULD USE I COULD IMAGINE THAT THIS COULD BE A REASONABLE PROCESS TO DO 
AND IT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THIS WOULD SOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES REGARDING I MEAN LIKE THE POSSIBILITY OF IDEA OF DISPLAYING VIDEOS AFTER FROM FROM WHAT WE RECORD 
SO YEAH 
WELL THIS IS MORE OR LESS WHAT WE JUST DISCUSSED RIGHT IF I UNDERSTAND 
SO LIKE THE DIVA PROJECT IS A TAPE FREE ALREADY SMART MEETING ROOM HUH 
OKAY 
BUT THIS CAN BE DONE AUTOMATICALLY RIGHT 
I MEAN IS THE OKAY 
SO AT T. N. O. THEY HAVE SOMETHING 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
NO THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING 
YEAH SO CURRENTLY BECAUSE THERE IS A TIME CODE UH VIDEO TIME CODE 
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FRAME DROPPING I MEAN BECAUSE ANYWAY IN EACH IN THE VIDEO SIGNAL TO USE ENCODED THE TIME RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
WELL BUT YOU DON'T I MEAN AT THIS POINT YOU DON'T REALLY CARE BECAUSE 
I MEAN IN THE SIGNAL YOU CAN EXTRACT THE TIME 
I MEAN THE TIME STAMP SO I IN THE SIGNAL 
SO IF YOU DROP SOME FORM 
WHICH HAPPENS SOMETIMES WHEN YOU DO COMPRESSION OR ACQUISITION UH Y YOU UH EV YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY FIND THIS ONE UH THE SIGNAL RIGHT 
I MEAN IT'S ENCODED IN THE ON THE IMAGE 
SO YOU CAN YOU CAN DO IT 
OTHERWISE UH IF THERE IS SOME FRAME DROPPING YOU HAVE TO RELY ON THE NUMBER OF FRAMES YOU ARE COUNTING MORE OR LESS I SUPPOSE IT TO ASSESS IT 
UH SO YOU HAVE YOU HAVE SOME PROBLEMS THEN YEAH 
OKAY 
WHICH I WHICH WAS MORE OR LESS T. N. O. 
SO PROBLEM 
WITH RESPECT TO FRAME DROPPING RIGHT 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK IF IT WAS NOT A PROBLEM OF FRAME DROPPING THE ALIGNMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EASY TO TO DO 
AND THE 
REALLY 
WELL SO IT WAS NOT SUCH A DIFFICULT PROCESS THEN 
YEAH BUT IF IT'S ONLY TO FIND UH ONE OF SET YOU HAVE TO FIND SOME EXA SOME EXAMPLES 
BUT I I HAD THE FEELING THAT THEY HAD ALSO SOME FRAME DROPPING THAT WAS UH NO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THEN THAT'S FINE 
YEAH BUT MAYBE THERE ARE ALREADY SOME MACHINES YOU KNOW UH UH 
OH 
YEAH I MEAN JUST THAT YOU KNOW OF OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A C OTHER LIBRARIES THAT MAY 
YOU KNOW CONFLICT WITH THE ONE YOU ARE TRYING TO USE 
AT THE SAME TIME YOU SEE IF YOU CRASH A MACHINE I MEAN BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING SOME TEST 
YOU MAY NOT WANT TO HAVE WHAT'S ON YOUR MACHINE I MEAN IT UH TO BE TO BE UH DE ERASED OR WHATS WHATEVER 
SO I THINK IT'S SO MAYBE THERE IS A MACHINE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER FOR THIS YOU AND YOU KNOW A VERY POWERFUL MACHINE AND SO NO 
BUT MAYBE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO USE A CURRENT MACHINE WHICH IS ONLY U YEAH THAT'S IS WITHDRAWN FROM THE NETWORK OR YEAH 
THE CARD 
YEAH 
BUT STILL I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S DONE IN THE CARD YOU NEED TO BASIC THING YOU NEED TO CHECK SO UM AS A BUS RIGHT 
I MEAN THE BUS WRITING I MEAN THE SPEED OF UH THE BASE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SO C. P. U. ITSELF MAY NOT BE SO 
THE ACCESS YEAH 
SO CAN WE EXPECT A CHRISTMAS UH GIFT 
OH 
MM 
FOR INSTANCE I MEAN THE TEST OF LOOKING AT THEIR ENTRY GOES POINT BY POINT 
SO LOOKING AT THEIR CODE I MEAN UH SO YOU SAID YOU WOULD LOOK AT THIS RIGHT 
OR IS IT OKAY 
'KAY 
WELL UH 
BECAUSE I MEAN I MEAN THE U. V. C. SYSTEM 
I MEAN IT'S UH I SEE MY FEELING IS THAT I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE EXPERTISE ON THIS LIKE IN FRIBOURG ALSO 
SO I MEAN I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD TAKE A LOT OF TIME I MEAN JUST TO LOOK AT THIS RIGHT 
I MEAN AT LEAST ONE MONTH SEEMS TO BE UH QUITE ENOUGH FOR THIS RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BECAUSE ANYWAY THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE WORKING ON RIGHT 
SO THE U. V. C. BUT USING THE SIGNALS THAT ARE COMING I MEAN IS BASICALLY IT'S USING THE U. V. C. OKAY 
OKAY SO CURRENTLY YOU ARE NOT WORKING ON THIS 
OKAY THEN WE NEED 
YEAH THAT THAT'S THAT'S SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUE I MEAN THAT UH MAYBE DON'T KNOW W WHETHER YOU REALISE 
BUT OF COURSE IF WE HAVE THIS ONE TWO YEARS MAYBE OKAY IT'S GOOD WE HAVE TO 
BUT OF COURSE IT'S IT'S IN THE IT'S TOO LONG I MEAN IN TERMS OF IN TERM OF RESEARCH 
IN TERMS UH MAYBE EVEN IN TERMS OF INNOVATION I MEAN IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHAT UH THEY SAID 
I MEAN HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT INNOVATION 
THIS IS PROBABLY IN IN INNOVATION 
AND THE THE I KNOW I'M W W IS QUITE WELL WHY IS WORKING ON THIS RIGHT 
BUT IN TWO YEARS YOU KNOW IF WE WANT TO DO IF WE WANT TO BUILD A C. T. A. OR TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY AND SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU C OF COURSE OKAY PEOPLE WILL SAY YEAH 
BUT THERE IS ALREADY SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO PUT IN THE MARKET AND SO NO 
SO IT MAYBE NOT THE IT'S IT'S TOO LATE UH TO TO DO IT 
SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY IS THIS IS ONE OF THE POINTS RESPECT TO RESEARCH OF COURSE 
IT'S I THINK IT'S GOING TO APPEAR MORE MORE AND MORE AND UH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
BECAUSE WHEN WHEN YOU SAY HERE NOW NO I'M NOT GOING TO START IT WORKING ON THIS BEFORE JANUARY 
FOR ME THIS SURPRISES ME TO SOME EXTENT YOU KNOW I'M UH I THOUGHT I MEAN YOU WOULD YOU WOULD BE WORKING ON THIS 
SO IF YOU SAY OKAY NOW IT'S UH YEAH 
NO UH OUI 
NO 
I MEAN THE POINT IS THAT OLIVIER WILL OR YOU HAVE I MEAN S SINCE IN YOUR UH YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AND SO NO 
SO IT SEEMS THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN A PRIORITY 
SO THAT THAT'S UH THAT'S THE POINT 
SO IF YOU HAVE ONE TIME TO PUT PRIORITY AT SOME POINTS AND THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE DURING IN YOUR IN THIS PROJECT 
I MEAN YOU NEED TO SAY IT NOW 
I MEAN THAT'S THE POINT NOW 
SO THIS IS FRANCK 
AT LEAST UH SAY THIS TO USE AND WE'LL SEE UH WITH FRANCK 
AND AGAIN I MEAN THIS IS A QUESTION 
SO NOW YOU ARE SAYING YOU HAVE ONE TIME 
SO NOW YOU SAY IT IS 
SO NOW WE UNDERSTAND AND WE ARE MAYBE AFTER 
WHEN WE IF WE DISCUSS WITH FRANCK UH FRANCK CRITTIN OR UH UH FRANK UH FORMAZ AND WE'LL SEE OKAY AND GO AND TRY TO USE 
OKAY APPARENTLY UH UH HAS NO TIME TO TO WORK ON THIS 
SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND WE'D LIKE TO TO DO SOMETHING 
SO WHAT KIND OF SOLUTION AS ALEXANDRE MENTIONS I DO WE NEED TO TAKE SOMEBODY 
DO WE WANT TO DO WE NEED TO TAKE SOME INTERN TO WORK ON THIS UH AND SO ON AND SO NO 
DO WE TAKE TO HAVE UH SOMEBODY UH FOR CONTRACT EVEN IF IT'S NOT AN INTERN BUT TAKE SOMEBODY FOR SIX MONTHS TO WORK ON THIS 
I MEAN BUT IS THIS A POINT 
I MEAN UH Y I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER PROJECTS YOU HAVE TO DO 
I DON'T KNOW WITH WH YOU ARE DISCUSSING ABOUT THE TIME YOU ARE YOU CAN USE UH S SPEND ON EACH OF THE PROJECT 
BUT IF YOU BECAUSE NOW YOU ARE JUST TELLING US YOU HAVE ONE TIME NEEDED TO WORK ON THIS RIGHT 
OKAY SO SO OKAY 
YEAH BUT I MEAN C IT'S YEAH BUT 
WELL I MEAN UH I MEAN YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE AWARE OF UH M. F. C. 
I MEAN I MEAN PEOPLE UH I SUPPOSE IT H. U. V. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE UH WHERE I WAS IN LE MANS IN THE A. B. UH I MEAN THERE UH WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY SOME SOME STUDENTS UH THAT WOULD BE AWARE OF AND THAT COULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS 
I MEAN THEY ARE WORKING WITH SOFTWARE AND HARD BOTH OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE 
UH I'M I'M SURE THE S SO 
BECAUSE UH SO SO OLIVIER SAYS IT'S NOT BEFORE JANUARY ON HIS SIDE 
SO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT UH IN YOUR SIDE WHE WHAT'S YOUR YEAH 
LIKE WHAT 
ONE DAY A WEEK UH SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
BUT 
BECAUSE UH BECAUSE THERE ARE THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES I WOULD SAY 
LIKE IF THERE WOULD BE A MACHINE LIKE THIS WITH THE TWO CARDS SEPARATED AS I MENTION 
I MEAN IF WE RECORD LE THE FLOW OF THE VIDEO FOR INSTANCE AND THE SNAP SHOTS FROM THE SLIDES TO SOME EXTENT THERE IS SOME POSSIBILITY OF DOING SOME AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENT WITHOUT HAVING A SPECIAL 
YOU KNOW 
SYNCHRON SO THIS MEANS THAT AT SOME EXTENT WE COULD HAVE A DEVICE WHICH WOULD NOT YET BE FULLY SYNCHRONIZED AND 
I DON'T KNOW WE'VE UH YOU KNOW VERY WELL DONE UH CODE IN TERMS OF SENDING SIGNALS AND SO NO 
BUT THAT MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT BECAUSE I MEAN TO SYNCHRONIZE UP TO DON'T KNOW FIVE SECONDS 
AND YOU WOULD SAY FIVE SECONDS MAY SEEM A LOT FOR AUDIO AND VIDEO 
BUT MAYBE F RESPECT TO SLIDES AND THE REST IS NOT SO SOMETHING THAT MAY BE TOLERABLE 
SO STILL WE WOULD BE ABLE TO START DOING SOME RECORDINGS AND MAYBE UH DOING EVEN THE AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENT OR AT LEAST WE WOULD HAVE AN IDEA BUT 
YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF ALIGNMENTS 
UH D D BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE WITH MICROPHONE ARRAYS WHERE YOU WOULD NEED MICRO SECOND ALIGNMENTS OF COURSE 
UH OR EVEN MAYBE WITH WE WANT VIDEO WHERE IT MAY BE ONE OR TWO FRAMES I DON'T KNOW 
SO THIS IS REALLY SOME SOMEHOW I MEAN THE UH THE THE ISSUE I MEAN I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF POSSIBILITIES TO DO THINGS 
AND THE GOAL WOULD BE THAT INDEED WE COULD START UH REC DOING SOME OF THE RECORDINGS OF THE TIME IS THAT INDEED WE WOULD ALREADY W UH WE WOULD HAVE UH SOMETHING WHERE UH WE COULD UH START GETTING THE DATA 
BECAUSE AFTER I MEAN EVEN IF IT THERE WE CANNOT PUT ALL THE TIMES IN ONE WEEK RIGHT 
I MEAN S AND UH SO I MEAN THIS IS UH THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUE AS WELL 
WHICH IS TO HAVE TO USE THAT WE CAN PLAY AND WE CAN MAKE A NICE DEMO AND SO IN WITH THE FULL UH THING AND SOMETHING 
SO IF THE OTHER PART IS TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHICH FROM WHICH WE CAN ALREADY RECORD DATA AND WITH SOME APPROXIMATION 
AND I HAVE THE FEELING GIVEN THE DESCRIPTIONS THAT YOU MADE 
THAT TO HAVE SUCH A SYSTEM WOULDN'T REQUIRE A SIX MONTHS OF WORK BECAUSE BASICALLY THEIR OWN CODE IS THERE AT SOME EXTENT AND UH THE U. V. C. S SOMETHING QUITE STANDARD FROM WHICH WE COULD ASK I MEAN EVEN WE COULD EVEN PAY MAYBE PRO SOME PEOPLE FROM FRIBOURG 
I DON'T KNOW 
I MEAN TO COME HERE AND IT NEED TO HELP US WITH THE INSTALLATION ON A COMPUTER AND UH AND UH TO TO TO GET THE SO I HAVE MORE THE FEELING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE ALMOST IN ONE MONTH 
AGAIN I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT THE SYNCHRONIZATION I MEAN SO 
YEAH I MEAN THE TWO YEAH YEAH 
YEAH THE FOR INSTANCE A SIMPLE QUESTION MAYBE YOU CAN ARE WE SURE THAT IT CAN WORK ON A SINGLE COMPUTER 
I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
I MEAN IS THERE ANY UH ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THIS 
SO THIS IS YEAH 
SO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE IT IT'S MORE TESTING IT DOES NOT REQUIRE US FOR THIS W I MEAN IF YOU PUT THE TWO CARDS ON THE COMPUTER 
YOU PUT THE TWO THEN YOU YOU BASICALLY YOU SAY PLAY ON THE BOTH SIDES AND YOU LOOK WHETHER AT THE AND YOU HAVE UH A RECORDED SIGNALS WHICH IS IS IS UH THE TIME THAT IT SHOULD UH B AND UH OR WHETHER I MEAN THE FACT THAT WHENEVER I MEAN THE SLIDES IS DOING SOME UH PROCESSING UH IT THERE IS SOME AND THERE IS SOME FRAME DROPS OR THINGS LIKE THIS 
SO THIS IS UH 
MM-HMM 
I'M I'M WONDERING WHETHER STILL WE COULD ASK FOR TO GET AN INTERN FOR THIS 
I MEAN UH 
YEAH THIS IS UH STILL UH EVEN EVEN THE NON DIPLOMA WORK 
I MEAN THE THINGS WE COULD ASK UH BUT I WOULD YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
WELL YOU 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE ISSUE 
YEAH 
WELL BUT YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I THINK IT'S 
OH 
MM-HMM 
KEEP GOING 
YEAH YEAH 
SURE THAT'S INTEREST US 
IT'S OKAY 
IT SHOULD 
BUT FOR THE MOMENT JUST FOR THE PURPOSE WELL F FOR THE MOMENT IT'S JUST TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER SO WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT THE UH 
YEAH FOR WITH PAS 
IT'S OKAY 
YEAH GOOD IDEA 
UH THIS SOUNDS LIKE ALEXANDRE PAS 
YEAH THAT'S NOT THAT 
IT'S DIVA 
N'EST CE PAS 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I DON'T KNOW 
MM-HMM 
BUT LE LET BE CAREFUL 
THERE'S AN IMPORTANT POINT 
THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAY YOU ACQUIRE THINGS SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY THE KIND OF PROCESSING YOU WANT TO HAVE 
SO IN OUR CASE WE NEED TO HAVE A GOOD PROCESSING OF SLIDES THAT IN OUR CASE IT MEANS TO TRANSCRIBE WITH AN I. C. R. AND THEN MAKE INDEXING 
WE NEED TO HAVE HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGE 
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN BY PRECISION RIGHT 
SO IN A SENSE THAT'S THE POINT 
FOR SO WE NEED TO HAVE UH THIS SUFFICIENT RESOLUTION IMAGES OF SLIDES TO DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO 
SO THAT'S WHY I GUESS WE DON'T FOLLOW THAT SOLUTION 
BECAUSE APPARENTLY YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO FAR AS I KNOW SO FOR UH THEY DID SIMILAR WORKS ON MEETINGS DOCUMENT CENTRED MEETINGS 
THEY ALWAYS WORKED ON MANUAL TRANSCRIPTIONS OF DOCUMENTS 
SO THEY NEVER REALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A POSSIBILITY OF ACTUALLY PERFORMING PROCESSING ON THE DOCUMENT THEY TALK ABOUT DURING THE MEETING DURING IN THIS CASE THE UH THE TALK 
THE CONFERENCE THE THE THE THE PRESENTATION 
SO FAR AS I KNOW 
SO FAR AS THEY PUBLISHED I KN I KNOW THE RESULTS THEY PUBLISHED UH AS FAR 
SO ESSENTIALLY THEY NE NEVER TOOK INTO ACCOUNT I MEAN THE WORK AT THE HIGH LEVEL WHICH MEANS BASICALLY WE HAVE THE INFORMATION COMING FROM HERE AND THERE 
AND WE N CREATED TECHNIQUES THAT ALLOW IT STARTS FROM THE TEXT THERE AND THE THINGS THAT ARE USED AND WE IF WE FIND CONTEXT 
I MEAN THEY MAKE SOME KIND OF PROCESSING 
BUT SO THEY DON'T WORK ON THE LOW LEVEL IS LOW LEVEL IT MEANS BASICALLY OKAY TAKE THE SPEECH AND EXTRACT THE TRANSCRIPTION 
I TAKE THE IMAGE UH OF THE DOCUMENT AND I TAKE THE TRANSCRIPTION 
THEY BASICALLY DON'T REALLY CARE OF THIS ASPECT AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND MM 
SO FAR AS I KNOW 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LET'S SAY THAT IT MAKES UH LESS AUTOMATIC ON THE SENSE THAT TO POINT YOU NEED SOMEONE GIVING THE FILE AND PUTTING THE FILE UPLOAD IN SOMEWHERE ET CETERA 
AND IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROCESSING 
SOME WAY IS ALWAYS DRIVEN BY W WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO 
THEY WORK A LOT ON LAYOUT ANALYSIS 
I KNOW THEY MATCH UH UH THE LAYOUT IN TWO X. M. L. FILES ET CETERA 
SO IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF APPROACHING THE PROBLEM WHICH MEANS A DIFFERENT WAY OF CAPTURING DIFFERENT EXIGENCIES IN IN CAPTURING THE THE DOCUMENTS YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I IT'S THE SAME AS AS YOU HAVE ON THE PICTURE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEP 
DEFINITELY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
ACQUISITION 
MM-HMM 
TAPE FREE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM YEAH 
NOW BASICALLY WE HAVE ALL THOSE KIND OF GENERAL VIEW ABOUT ALL THE SYSTEMS MAYBE WE CAN TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK TO OUR SYSTEM 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAD THERE ARE MM WE HAD THE LONG DISCUSSION AND FINALLY WE DECIDED FOR FOR ONE APPROACH 
AND MAYBE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIKE JUST A MOMENT UH TO WHAT POINT WE ARE AND W WHEN WE PLAN BASICALLY TO GET SOMETHING UH DONE AND WORKING 
I CAN ADD TO THAT LIST OF PROJECT IS SOMETHING THAT JEAN MARC AND UM WE HAVE FOUND IN THE LITERATURE 
THERE IS F. X. THAT IS DOING SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO TO WHAT WE DO HERE BASICALLY 
A CAPTURE THROUGH THE PROJECTOR SIGNAL OF THE SLIDES AND THEY FOR THE MOMENT THEY JUST PLAN TO USE THE SLIDES AS A AS A WAY TO INDEX THE PRESENTATIONS 
BUT BUT UH ROUGHLY IS IS AN IDEA THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO TO OUR IDEA 
AS WELL ESSENTIALLY NOW WE HAVE THE MATERIAL AS FAR I'M SO I'M UNDERSTOOD 
UH AND IT'S UP TO YOU TO TELL US ROUGHLY WHEN DO YOU THINK UH WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOMETHING WORKING 
MM-HMM 
ISSUES YEAH 
MM CAREFUL BECAUSE THE UH I LISTENED TO FRANK AND APPARENTLY DON'T WANT TO BUY A NEW MACHINE BEFORE WE SHOW THAT THIS WORKS 
SO WE HAVE TO USE MATERIAL THAT IS ALREADY AVAILABLE 
MAYBE THERE IS SOME FREE MA MACHINE THAT IS NOT 
OKAY SO SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE OTHER MACHINES ACTUALLY YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
SOME OF UH SOME OTHER MACHINE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO MM IN TERMS OF TIME WHAT WE CAN THINK 
WHEN WE CAN EXPECT TO USE 
CHRISTMAS GIFT OR 
EARLY NEW YEAR GIFT 
OH 
BUT THE WAY OF COURSE I'M I I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT UH THE WORK INVOLVES 
SO SO THIS UH NO THAT'S NOT THAT I DON'T CARE 
BUT UH I D I DON'T UNDERSTAND SOME WAY EXACTLY 
I THINK THE THE THE REAL POINT IS WHEN 
ROUGHLY 
I MEAN I I DON'T SAY WELL NO NO NO 
I DON'T WANNA PUT A DEADLINE 
UH BUT UH GIVEN THE CURRENT UH MATERIAL WE HAVE UM MM GIVEN YOUR ACTIVITIES BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU BOTH ARE INVOLVE IN MANY OTHER THINGS 
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU YEAH AS JEAN MARC SAID IS CHRISTMAS AND UH SO WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE CHRISTMAS GIFT 
OR IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SAY IS CHRISTMAS TWO THOUSAND SIX 
SO I I I DEFINITELY JUST WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING VERY ROUGH ON WHEN YOU EXPECT TO FINISH THIS 
THAT'S PROBLEM 
OH THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM 
I MEAN DO YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING FOR THE VERY NEXT MONTHS 
DO YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING FOR THE END OF NEXT YEAR 
DO YOU THINK SP 
MM 
SO SO FAR AS HALF NEXT YEAR 
SO JUNE JUNE JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIX 
OUR RESULTS WHAT DOES IT MEAN 
THE END OF THIS 
SO IT WORKS IT DOESN'T WORK 
YOU KNOW FOR FOR ME WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WHEN IT IS READY TO BE SO 
SO WHEN I CAN SAY START COLLECTING DATA UH I START USING 
I START PLAYING WITH THIS 
BASICALLY THE PROCESS IS READY AND WE CAN START HAVING OUR DEMO 
AND ALSO BECAUSE THERE IS A RISK THAT UH WE SUBMITTED A PROJECT MAYBE IT WILL BE REJECTED WE DON'T KNOW 
BUT POTENTIALLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A STUDENT SUPPOSED TO WORK ON THIS 
IT WILL BE NO NOT BEFORE APRIL TWO THOUSAND SIX ANYWAY 
BUT UH YOU KNOW MM SOME WAY WE WE WE WE CANNOT HAVE A STUDENTS AND MAKE HIM WAIT ON YOUR BEFORE HE HAS UH THE MATERIAL TO WORK 
SO MY POINT IS WHEN 
REASONABLY 
UH ROUGHLY I DON'T DON'T DON'T WANNA HAVE AND IT'S NOT A DEADLINES OUI 
BUT WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE THE SYSTEM READY TO WORK UH WORKING 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
TOGETHER 
SO THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MAIN PROBLEM AS FAR AS AS I UNDERSTAND 
MM-HMM 
UH MAKE SOMETHING OR THAT YOU ARE USING VERY VAGUE EXPRESSION 
RESULT MAKE SOMETHING 
JUST JUST UH JUST TELL ME WHEN IT IS READY 
AND IF YOU THINK IT'S IT'S NOT BEFORE UH BUT BUT MUST BE REASONABLE I AM I MEAN IF YOU THINK IT WILL BE NOT BEFORE DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX 
SAY DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX 
SO DON'T TRY TO TELL ME MARCH OR APRIL I W IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT IT IS UNREALISTIC TO SAY THAT 
MUST BE REALISTIC 
YOU SAY JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIX WE KNOW IT IS JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIX 
UH I KNOW 
SURE 
SURE 
BUT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WELL BUT THERE IS ONE DAY TO RESPECT 
IT'S JUST TO KNOW I MEAN AND IF YOU CAN HAVE EARLY EARLY WARNINGS IN THE SENSE THAT IF YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A MAJOR UH PROBLEM SOMEWHERE 
BUT IS JUST TO KNOW IN THE SENSE THAT REALLY UH THIS UP THIS MM THING HAS BEEN STOP NOW FOR QUITE A LONG TIME 
UH UH IT ON TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL 
NOW WE HAVE TO 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT UH AS A PRETTY GOOD IDEA 
WE USE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE WORKING ET CETERA 
WE ARE GOING TO LOSE IT SOME WAY OF UH IF WE DON'T PUT SOME AND VERY HONESTLY YEAH 
I I IT'LL IT'LL NOT BE 
THIS IS INNOVATION YEAH 
UH YOU KNOW IN A SENSE I NEVER TRIED FOR EXAMPLE EVENTUALLY TO ASK FOR ONE PERSON DEDICATED TO THIS BECAUSE I ALWAYS HAD THE FEELING THAT YOU ARE VERY INTERESTED 
YOU WANTED TO DO IT IT'S SOMETHING YOU SOME WAY YOU UH I MEAN IT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS INTERESTING TO YOU 
BUT UH IF YOU HAVE NOT THE TIME AND THE POSSIBILITY TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU YOU BOTH ARE INVOLVED IN MANY OTHER THINGS 
WE CAN EVENTUALLY TRY TO ASK TO HAVE ONE PERSON TO INVOLVE ONE PERSON THAT WILL BE DEDICATED STRICTLY TO THIS 
WE CAN TRY 
I MEAN WE CAN ASK UH UH IN THE SENSE THAT IF IT IS A PRIORITY FOR IDIAP SO FAR WE WOULD GET VERY GOOD SIGNALS FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW 
I I DON'T KNOW 
BUT UH PLEASE IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR THE ENERGY TO DO IT 
UH OR IT INVOLVES TOO MANY THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT KEEP UNDER CONTROL GIVEN THE OTHER THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO 
UH DON'T THINK THAT OKAY SOMETHING ONCE WE WE CAN WAIT OR SOONER OR LATER IT WILL HAPPEN 
OH YEAH 
EXACTLY 
SO I THINK IT'S THE MOMENT UH FOR YOU TO REALLY REALISE TRY TO TO HAVE A REALISTIC UH DATA 
AND IF YOU THINK THERE ARE TOO MANY THINGS THAT YOU RISK TO LOSE CONTROL UH TELL IT NOW 
AND WE CAN TRY TO SAY WELL WE WANT TO DO IT BUT UH BASICALLY MAEL AND OLIVIER WERE THE PERSON MM-HMM 
NO NO 
BUT BUT YOU CAN BE INVOLVE IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
I MEAN YOU CAN EVENTUALLY HAVE UH A SUPERVISION ROLE IN THE SENSE THAT YOU THINK THAT I I KNOW HOW TO DO IT 
I LIKE TO DO IT BUT I HAVE ONE TIME 
BECAUSE IT A CERTAIN POINT IT'S A MATTER OF TIME 
WE CAN TRY TO TO ASK 
UH BUT UH PLEASE JUST DON'T KEEP THIS IS A KIND OF THING 
YEAH I LIKE TO DO IT I LIKE IT IT'S NICE ET CETERA 
YEAH 
YEAH BU BUT BUT HERE YOU HAVE TO TAKE A RESPONSIBILITY 
YOU CAN'T SAY I LIKE TO DO IT AND BUT THEN UH BUT I WILL DO IT WHEN I CAN 
EXACTLY 
MM-HMM 
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OKAY THIS IS YEAH 
NO NO 
OKAY SO NOW IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY I CANNOT FIND TIME 
IF YOU CAN'T FIND TIME YOU HAVE TO SAY IT NOW 
AND THIS IS ALSO FOR YOU 
I MEAN I IT'S NOT AN ACCUSATION 
WE WE ARE ALL IN THE SAME CONDITION 
MM-HMM 
EXACTLY 
MM-HMM 
SO SO 
SO LET ME POSE THE QUESTION VERY BROADLY 
DO YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE A PERSON THAT HAS THIS WILL HELP YOU 
WE CAN ASK WE CAN TRY TO ASK MAYBE IF SOME PERSON FOR SIX MONTHS IS THAT YOUR ROLE IS SIMPLY TO HELP AND ADVISE 
WE CAN TRY TO ASK 
I MEAN 
SO 
I'M SORRY BUT YOU STILL DON'T ANSWER TO MY MY QUESTION 
YOU ARE NOT ANSWERING MY QUESTION 
YEAH 
LET ME POSE AGAIN THE QUESTION VERY CLEARLY 
IF I GO TO HERVE I CAN TRY AND SAY WE ARE IN THIS SITUATION APPARENTLY 
WHY DON'T WE TAKE ONE PERSON THREE MONTHS SIX MONTHS FOUR MONTHS THAT DIRECTLY ADVISED BY OLIVIER AND UH AND WE CAN SPEED UP 
CONSIDER THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO FIND THEM ET CETERA AND SO NO 
DO YOU THINK IT'S AN OPTION 
MM-HMM 
TO EACH 
YEAH I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE YEAH 
DO YOU THINK IT'S A REASONABLE OPTION 
DO YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE CAN HELP YOU 
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A MATTER OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU GUYS TO BUT THERE IS NOTHING BAD IF YOU SAY YOU HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO 
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL UH FULL OF WORK 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ADDED ON THE TOP 
UH IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME YOU DON'T HAVE TIME GUYS 
I MEAN THIS IS UH BUT PLEASE JUST TELL ME 
WE WILL FIND THE TIME HOWEVER 
SO APRIL O. SIX YOU WILL HAVE YOUR SYSTEM 
OR NO WE ARE NOT SURE 
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW 
UH IT CAN HAPPEN THAT WE DON'T 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO FIND IN THE WAY 
MAYBE WE THINK IT TAKES ONE WEEK AND THEN IT TAKES ONE MONTH 
UH WE WE DON'T KNOW 
UH MAYBE WE WILL SO WE WE WILL NOT ABLE TO BE CONTINUOUS 
BECAUSE ONE OF THE WRONGEST THING IS TO WORK ON WEAK THAN ONE MONTH NO ET CETERA 
THAT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT BREAKS 
I MEAN DIFFICULT HUH 
MM SO THAT'S THE POINT 
SO THAT WHICH DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE EXCLUDED F FROM THE THING IN THE SENSE THAT IN ANY CASE SOMEONE WILL ASK WILL HAVE TO ADVISE THE PERSON EVENTUALLY 
AND IT CAN'T BE HIM IT CAN'T BE UM 
IT CAN BE YOU THAT BASICALLY FOLLOW ADVISE HELPS 
BUT AT LEAST THE MASS OF THE WORK WILL BE DONE BY SOMEONE ELSE THAT CAN SPEND A HUNDRED PERCENT OF TIME ON THAT 
NOW IT'S NOT EVEN GUARANTEED IN THE SENSE THAT I CAN ASK THIS 
I CAN SAY THAT WELL THIS IS THE SITUATION AND UH YOU ARE 
OR EVENTUALLY YEAH SOMEONE CAN SAY OKAY NOW THIS BECOME YOUR PRIORITY 
FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE AND GO WITH THAT 
I DON'T KNOW 
OR WILL TELL YOU OKAY UH JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX BUT FROM JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX YOU DO NOTHING ELSE THAN THIS 
YOU KNOW W WE CAN FIND THE TIME WHETHER IT IS YOUR TIME WHETHER IT IS THE TIME IF SOMEONE ELSE 
BUT UH I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO STOP WITH THIS BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN FOR SEVERAL MONTHS THAT YOU SAY WE LIKE WE WANT 
AND I'M SURE I BELIEVE YOU 
BUT THEN IT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT MUST BE DONE OUTSIDE UH THE UH NORMAL ACTIVITY 
UM I'M UH I'M SORRY 
YEAH 
BUT BUT UH OTHERWISE I MEAN SO YOU SAY TO DO IT IN TWO YEARS P 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YOU LIKE THAT I TRY TO TO TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND TRY TO SAY THAT THERE IS A TIME PROBLEM AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO DO IT 
OKAY 
BUT THAT CAN BE 
BUT UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT CAN BE TOLERABLE YEAH 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
UH I NO 
LET ME 
THAT SEEMS TO ME CLEAR 
UNTIL JANUARY IS UH IS BUSY 
SO 
SO YEAH 
JUST TO GO TO A CONCLUSION BECAUSE APPARENTLY YEAH 
SO IT CAN'T WORK UH YEAH EXACTLY 
CAN'T WORK UH UNTIL JANUARY 
SO IT'S UP TO YOU 
IT'S UP TO YOU TO EVALUATE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
AND THEN WE D MAKE A DECISION ON THE SENSE WHETHER YOU CONTINUE WORKING OR WE TRY TO FIND THE TIME IN A DIFFERENT WAY OR WE TRY TO ELIMINATE YOUR OTHER PRIORITIES YOU'RE UNDER 
HMM 
YEP 
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFERENT PROBLEM 
THE PROBLEM IS REALLY UP TO YOU GUYS WHETHER YOU THINK IT'S GOOD TO HAVE ONE PERSON 
TRY TO HAVE THAT BECAUSE UH I CANNOT SAY WE HAVE TRIED TO HAVE 
WE EXACTLY IT W BUT BETTER ONE PERSON THAN A BAD PERSON ANYWAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH SORRY ABOUT THAT MATTHEW IS STILL IN THE WAY 
OKAY HANG ON REPLY COMING 
YEAH IT'S OKAY 
U UH I HATE THESE THINGS 
VOILA 
OKAY 
SO 
UM WE CAN MAYBE GET A HEAD START 
UM HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING TO MATTHEW ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING 
OR 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WHICH WAS THE INTUITIVE FEELING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND SO AND THE R RESULT WAS NO 
BUT UH B BUT THE QUESTION IS OF USE THAT RESULT NO BECAUSE IT'S ONE OR IS IT ALSO JUST BECAUSE THERE'S NOT REALLY ENOUGH DATA TO BE SURE ABOUT ANYTHING 
SURE 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S NOT GONNA YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
THIS IS IS SORT OF A FEELING THAT WE HAD BUT HADN'T SHOWN 
I THINK I MEAN I IN UH FROM UH FROM AN APPLICATION POINT OF VIEW IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR VOCABULARY CONTAINS ALL THE WORDS IN THE SLIDES 
BUT FROM A RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE IT'S NOT INTERESTING 
THERE'D BE VERY FEW 
WELL THIS IS UH THIS IS HOW THE DICTIONARY'S CALCULATED 
IT CALCULATED SUCH THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE WORD IT DOESN'T AFFECT IT A GREAT DEGREE THE THE THE WORD ERROR RATE 
SO 
YEAH 
SURE 
YEP 
UM LIKE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT TH YEAH 
NO 
WELL THIS IS YEAH 
THAT'S YEAH 
YEAH 
OH SORRY ABOUT THAT 
YEAH 
OF COURSE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEP 
'CAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
YEP 
YEP 
HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
I MEAN TH IT'S PROBABLY VERY DEPENDENT ON THE SPEAKER AS WELL 
SOME PEOPLE HAVE A HABIT OF JUST READING WHAT THEY'VE GOT ON THEIR SLIDES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE COM ARE ARE WELL 
OR OR ARE QUITE PURPOSEFULLY TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS IS THAT THEY'VE SORT OF GOT MULTI MODALITY OF YOU KNOW 
BUT SO I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S NOT A SURPRISING RESULT THEN 
THE UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
WE USE GO STRAIGHT TO THE SEMANTICS OF THE YEP 
HMM 
YES 
MAYBE 
OKAY 
OH OKAY 
WELL I MEAN UH IT JUST COMES DOWN TO THE AT THE MERE FACT THAT WORD ERROR RATE IS JUST TAKE THE WORDS 
HOW MANY OF THEM DID YOU GET RIGHT 
TAKE PLUS OR MINUS TWO OR THREE OR FIVE OR TEN WORDS DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
SO YEAH 
EVEN IF THOSE WORDS AT THE END OF THE DAY WOULD BE QUITE IMPORTANT IN ANY SORT OF SEARCH OF THE TRANSCRIPT 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST USE THE SLIDES TO SEARCH THE TRANSCRIPT 
I IF YOU HAVE THE SLIDES THEN YEAH 
NO 
Y YOU'D JU I MEAN THE UH I MEAN IT SO I MEAN HAVE YOU BEEN DOING OTHER THINGS THEN 
HAVE YOU HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO TO DO IN IN ONE PLACE OF THIS 
OR OR OR LEADING ON FROM THIS GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE LEARNT 
'CAUSE OURS IS STRICT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ASSOCIATED 
YEAH 
SURE 
THE FOCUS 
YEAH OKAY 
YEP 
OKAY 
UM MEETING ACTION SORT OF FOCUS 
YEP 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH 
WE 
WELL 
YEAH 
Y YEAH OKAY 
SO I MEAN UH YOU COULD BEGIN WITH S SAYING THE A UM THE SIMPLE TASK OF JUST DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THE SPEECH IS RELATED TO THE SLIDE CONTENT 
AND WHICH IS SORT OF BUILDING UPON WHAT YOU KNOW DONG AND OTHERS HAVE WORKED IN IN TERMS OF 
YOU KNOW IS IT DISCUSSION MONOLOGUE FROM THE ORIGINAL M. FOUR DATA COLLECTION 
UH A YOU ARE ARE YOU ALSO CONSIDERING THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEETINGS FOR INSTANCE 
UM WELL OKAY 
WELL I MEAN IT IF IF IF THIS SIMILAR SORT OF PHRASES OR WORDS WERE DISCUSSED IN THIS MEETING AND WERE ALSO DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
THEN YOU SORT OF HAVE A A LINK BETWEEN MEETINGS FOR INSTANCE 
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE THE CHECK THE STATISTICS 
BUT I I MEAN 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOTTA THINK TOWARDS WHAT YOU KNOW 
THIS THIS WON'T OCCUPY AB AB YOU KNOW WON'T OCCUPY YOU FOR THREE YEARS OR WHATEVER JUST IN THIS I GUESS 
BUT HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THE FEATURE AND SO JUST A S 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
AND YEP 
YEP 
YEAH 
WELL Y YEAH 
SURE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I MEAN UH IT'S IT'S AND BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE DATA COLLECTED OR ANNOTATED YET IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
YEP YEP YEP 
HMM 
YEAH SURE 
OR B OR SO YOU SAY BACK CHANNEL VERSUS YEAH 
'CAUSE I TH THINK THAT'S QUITE INTERESTING 
I MEAN 'CAUSE IT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF SPEECH ACTIVITY WHICH IS YEAH 
SURE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO I MEAN AS FAR AS THAT YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING TO DO THAT I PRESUME 
UM YOU DON'T NEED ANY EXTRA STUFF FROM US IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE 
OR I MEAN THAT'S GOOD 
THAT'S GOOD 
BUT I MEAN IT IT 
OH YEAH I WOULDN'T GET TOO DISTRACTED I GUESS NO D D IF YOU'VE GOT TWO TRACKS I'D LIKE IT 
YEAH 
UM 
YEAH 
HMM 
BUT I 
AND UH THE K AND THE QUESTION IS ALSO OR THREE THREE SORT OF MORE SENSIBLE WAYS OF DOING IT 
FOR INSTANCE UM GAZE TRACKING 
I MEAN IF IF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE SLIDES 
YEAH SURE 
AND IT HAS SPECIFIC TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
UH BUT I MEAN FOR INSTANCE IT SHOULD BE LINKED TO THE OTHER STUFF THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING IN UM CALL ROUTING FOR INSTANCE 
AND AND UM YOU KNOW UH ERROR MERIT ERR ERROR MEASURES YES 
I MEAN I THINK I MEAN I I THINK THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO DRAW SOME SORT OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO SO WE WERE SAYING 
I MEAN MAYBE IF YOU YOU DON'T MEASURE THINGS IN TERMS OF WORD ERROR RATE MAYBE THIS SORT OF INFORMATION DOES ACTUALLY MEAN SOMETHING 
GIVEN THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WORDS ARE NOT ACTUALLY INTERESTING 
UM SO I MEAN 
WE 
WELL WE UH W ON IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT IT'S OF WHAT IS IT 
YEAH 
HMM 
SURE 
MM 
YEAH 
I THINK I THINK IT'S MAYBE AN INTERESTING TEST SCENARIO AND WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE SORT OF BASING SOMETHING AROUND SPEECH AND AND TEXT 
I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE IN SORT OF EXTRA HIGHER GOAL ABOVE THAT IS THAT YOU CAN MOTIVATE FUTURE RESEARCH 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH THIS WAS 
YEAH 
FOR ENGLISH IT'S ESPECIALLY LOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SPACE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL ANOTHER THING YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER SO THESE MODELS HAVE BEEN TUNED TO INCLUDE AMI DATA 
SO I MEAN PERHAPS IF YOU HAD SLIDES AND AND PRESENTATIONS TO DO WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS OFF TOPIC 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOU HADN'T SEEN ANY PRIOR DATA THEN YOU MIGHT AS A BIGGER CONTRIBUTION AS WELL 
BUT I MEAN ESSENTIALLY YOU'VE ACTUALLY SORT OF INCLUDED THE INFORMATION FROM THE SLIDES IN THE LANGUAGE MODEL 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY THEY'RE PRE PRE PREPARED 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
IT'S NOT THERE 
OKAY 
YOU THE AUDIO QUALITY THOUGH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WAS GOOD TO YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH THEY HAD LIKE UH YOU UH YOU THEY YOU KNOW THEY HAD THIS SET UP WITH THE UH THE MICROPHONES 
SO SOMEONE EVERY OUT THERE WAS ONE MICROPHONE SHARED BETWEEN EVERY TWO PEOPLE 
BUT THEY HAD DEALS WITH PEOPLE FORGETTING TO TURN THE MICROPHONE ON FORGETTING TO TURN IT OFF 
UH IF IT WAS IT WAS MEANT I THINK THEY THEY CHOSE THAT LECTURE THEATRE POSSIBLY WITH THE IDEA THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR COLLECTING DATA 
I MEAN I UH I'M SURE THEY COULD HAVE PROBABLY HAD UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH HOST IT OR WHATEVER 
BUT I TH I THINK THE YOU KNOW THE H. C. I. PART OF IT DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT TO HOW THEY PLANNED 
SO UP 
YEAH 
UM IT SO I MEAN IT'S SAME AS AS PUTTING IN A THE HEADPHONES AND WHATEVER 
I MEAN EVEN THAT MINOR THING 
I MEAN ANY ANY AUDIO CAPTURED DURING THAT PERIOD SO I IS RUBBISH 
BUT THERE'S ONE SORT OF SYSTEM THAT'S REALLY BUILT TO DO IT BE ABLE TO SAY WHEN YOU'RE YOU'RE CAPTURING THAT 
OKAY 
THE 
UH WHAT WILL THAT INCORPORATE 
WELL TO INCORPORATE LIKE UH AN S. M. A. AND UH 
YEP 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO NO NO UH MICROPHONE ARRAYS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
I GUESS THAT'S QUITE A THAT'S A QUITE A BI BIG DEAL FOR SETTING UP THE RECORDINGS I GUESS 
YEAH 
YEP 
SO YOU WANT YEP 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT LET'S PRETEND THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN ANY FORESEEABLE FUTURE 
WH UH TH I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING FROM PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVES 
YOU'D YOU'D HAVE TO THE THE AMI RECOGNITION SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW IS THERE FOR THOSE MICROPHONES ARE FOR THE MICROPHONE ARRAY 
THERE'S NO LAPEL SYSTEM TRAINED FOR INSTANCE 
SO I MEAN THAT IN ITSELF IT WOULD I MEAN YOU'D HAVE SOME FUN TRAINING SOME MORE SPEECH RECOGNITION MODELS 
BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S 
SURE 
YEAH 
IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE USING FOR THIS TYPE OF TASK 
I THINK 
YEAH 
AND EVERY TIME WE DO WE GENERATE A NEW CORPUS AND TRY TO CARRY OUT NEW RESEARCH WE DISCOVER SORT OF AREAS THAT ARE TOO CONTROLLED YOU KNOW 
I MEAN THE AMI ONES WERE A LOT BETTER IN TERM OF THAT THEN M. FOUR OR WHATEVER 
BUT STILL 
I MEAN ES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET INTO HIGHER LEVEL SORT OF UH INTERPRETATION IT'S YEAH 
UH WELL 
I'M UH I'M JUST CURIOUS DO THE LIKE THE ICSI MEETINGS DO THEY HAVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE IDEA 
DO THEY HAVE SLIDES OR ANYTHING ALONG THAT I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD 
OKAY I'M JUST THINKING WHETHER OR NOT OTHER ONE OR ANY OTHER SOURCES I MEAN MAYBE CHIL DATA 
'CAUSE IT'S I THINK IT'S GONNA BE MORE LIKE THE TAM TYPE SITUATION 
SO 
MM-HMM 
I DON'T KNOW 
BUT I MEAN GIVEN THAT IT'S COMING FROM THE SAME BASIS SO UM 
I I EXPECT THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF RELATIVELY F LIBERAL SORT OF DISTRIBUTION POLICY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE ONE THING ABOUT THAT AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP ON THE LAST NIST EVALS WAS THE FACT THAT IT'S ALMOST TOO UNI MODAL 
YOU'VE JUST GOT ONE LECTURER TALKING 
SO ONCE AGAIN YOU DON'T USE THE THE COMPLEX SORT OF LEVELS OF INTERACTION 
I MEAN UH YOU UH THERE'S NO WAY OF GETTING AROUND THAT 
I MEAN YOU JUST HAVE TO THINK OF A A TASK A CHALLENGE THAT IS RELEVANT TO THAT TYPE OF RECORDING 
WHICH MIGHT MM YOU MIGHT USE THE SAME METHODS AS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PR TALKING ABOUT TODAY 
BUT THE ACTUAL SORT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MEASURE MIGHT NEED TO BE SLIGHTLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT I GUESS 
I DON'T YEAH YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF SAY MEASURING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SLIDES OR OFF CHANNEL 
I MEAN YOU MIGHT FIND NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF YOUR DATA IS DIRECTLY REFERRING TO YOUR SLIDES IN A IT IN A TIME 
THAT IS UH IS ONE TIMES 
YEAH BUT I'M I'M MEANING IF YOU MOVE ON TO THESE CORPORA YEAH 
SO YOU MIGHT WANNA BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE BASICALLY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
AND UH AND AT THE S AND AT THE SAME END OF THE DAY 
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE USING OR LEARNING ABOUT THE SAME TECHNIQUES THAT YOU'LL NEED FOR DOING OTHER THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES 
SO 
OKAY 
IT WELL IT'S IT'S TO MAKE A PROPOSAL BASICALLY FOR YOUR YEP UH 
THIS ONE 
OKAY 
YEP 
THE SP 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SURE 
SOMETIMES IT'S A LOT MORE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL YOU'D UH USER 
IT L AT AT LEAST SPOT IF THEY FORGET TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING AND IT WON'T LET THEM CONTINUE ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE UNTIL THEY'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THE POINTS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL UH THAT THAT WAS JUST THROUGH SHEER WEIGHT OF CONTENT THOUGH 
B YEAH 
SO IN FIVE SIX YOU KNOW NUMBER WHERE WHERE THE GRAPHEMIC YEAH WELL I YEAH 
YEAH 
ALTHOUGH I REMEMBER DISCUSSING THIS LIKE UM 'CAUSE UH WHEN NEVILLE WAS WORKING ON HIS HIS STUFF WHICH WAS JUST BASED ON THE SLIDES 
IF UM UH UH ASKED ME ALL YOU KNOW COULD I PRE SEGMENT THE SLIDES FOR HIM UH 
YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO SEE YOU WANTED TO HAVE THE TOPIC SEGMENTATION 
AND I SAID WELL JUST LOOK AT THE THE HEADINGS 
BECAUSE ANYBODY GENERALLY WHO WRITES THE SLIDES YEAH 
IT'S NOT OKAY 
IT'S TRUE FOR UM THEN 
OKAY 
YEP 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UH IT YEAH IT DEPENDS YEAH 
THAT'S A STYLISTIC THING IS MUCH AS ANYTHING 
YEAH 
HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
WHICH UH WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A GOOD OR A BAD THING 
IT DEPENDS ON THE TALK 
YEAH PRESENTATION YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SOMETHING WE'RE TAUGHT AT UNIVERSITY FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE 
THE STRUCTURE 
YEAH YEAH SURE 
IT'S ALL SUBJECTIVE 
HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
IT'S QUITE STRICTLY IMPOSED NOW 
YOU 
YEAH 
AFTER THE AFTER THE HARD DRIVE CRASH WE TAKE THE TIME TO ACTUALLY REBUILD THE THE THE SYSTEM AND ACTUALLY TRAIN 'CAUSE ORIGINALLY WE SORT OF HAD THE IDEA OF UH WE'LL SEE A RECOGNIZER THAT'S BEEN TRAINED ON A LARGE AMOUNT OF TELEPHONE SPEECH DATA AND THAT SHOULD GIVE US A BETTER RESULT 
I JUST AS A CONTRAST I TRAINED ON SPECIFICALLY ON THIS DATA 
RESULTS WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL UM WHICH SAYS IT UM THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE DATA RATHER THAN AND IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS 
IT'S SIMPLY THAT IT HASN'T BEEN UM CHUNKED IT OR OR SEGMENTED IN A WAY THAT'S TYPICAL OF SPEECH RESOURCES 
IN TERMS OF UM YOU CAN HAVE LIKE UH A TWO SECOND UTTERANCE UH CREDIT CARDS AND THEN TWENTY SECONDS OF SILENCE COMING FUTURE IT 
WHICH ONE WHICH WHEN YOU IF WHEN YOU FIRST THINK ABOUT IT YOU JUST THINK UH SILENCE WHATEVER NOTHING WILL HAPPEN 
BUT A LOT OF THE NORMALIZATION THAT WE USE 
OH YEAH C. M. S. C. C. V. N. 
UH SO WE WE NEED A DECENT END POINT DETECTION SYSTEM RUNNING BEFORE WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN DO THAT 
AND WE'RE CONVERGING ON HAVING ONE NOW JUST ONE ONE SORT OF TANDEM WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT OF THIS WEB BASED RECOGNIZER 
UM BUT OF COURSE UNFORTUNATELY ALL THESE THINGS TAKE TIME 
UM BUT I I THINK WE SHOULD USE A DECENT SORT OF IMPROVEMENT THEN 
NOT JUST IN TERMS OF NO LONGER HAVING RECOGNITION ERRORS WHENEVER SILENCE APPEARS 
'CAUSE YOU GET THAT IMMEDIATE BENEFIT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY INSERTION ERRORS 
BUT ALSO IT SHOULD ACTUALLY AFFECT THE RECOGNITION IN THE SPEECH SEGMENTS AS WELL 
THE 
THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM THAT'S THE HARD P UH I MIGHT UH GIVEN THE TROUBLE WE'VE HAD WITH THIS CORPUS I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES 
THAT'S THE INTENTION YEP 
SURE SURE 
WE TRAINED THE SYSTEM JUST IN THIS DATA 
LIKE THERE WERE THERE WERE SIX THOUSAND UTTERANCES THAT WEREN'T USED FOR UH THE CALL ROUTING SIDE OF THINGS 
I THINK THEY TH THERE WERE THIRTEEN THOUSAND IN THE ENTIRE CORPUS 
SIX TO HALF OF THEM ROUGHLY WE'VE THROWN AWAY 
SO SO THAT FOR ACOUSTIC TRAINING 
AND THE RESULTS FROM THAT WERE ALMOST THE SAME AS WHAT WE GOT FOR THE C. T. S. MODEL 
Y YEAH 
BUT NO CAN IMAGINE A COMMERCIAL SYSTEM UH THAT THAT THAT S STEVEN COX USED FROM NUANCE PROBABLY HAD ALL THESE THINGS 
BUILT AN END POINT DETECTION ET CETERA ET CETERA 
SO 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THERE'S ALSO JUST THINGS LIKE TELE UH RECEIVER NOISE AT THE BEGINNING AND OR AT THE END OF THE AND I MEAN THESE THESE ARE THINGS YOU CAN GET RID OF IF IT'S A 
MM 
YEP 
MM OKAY THIS IS OF OKAY 
OKAY 
WE CAN JUST RUN SOME GENERIC YEAH 
WELL I DON'T MIND RUNNING OUT 
I'VE GOT ALL THE SCRIPTS SET UP 
SO 
WELL I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE I SEE THE POINT ACTUALLY 
OH 
MM 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW THING TH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT A 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S A 
WE MIGHT AS WELL 
'CAUSE I MEAN WE'VE UP UNTIL NOW UH YOU HAVEN'T BEEN RUNNING ANY RECOGNITION ON AND NEITHER DID JEAN YVES ON THAT IN THAT DATA 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH SURE BUT I MEAN THE SCRIPTS ARE SO AUTOMATED IT'S JUST A MATTER OF SETTING UH UH SUBMITTING A JOB TO THE CLUSTER AND 
I DON'T I DON'T USE THE POINT OF THAT 
I DON'T MIND RUNNING OUT 
THAT'D IT'D BE LIKE UH HALF AN HOUR'S WORK ON A DAY TO RUN THE RECOGNITION SCRIPTS 
I MEAN I I I I KNOW YOU'RE SAYING 
ARTEM SHOULD FAMILIARISE HIMSELF WITH THE U. S. R. SYSTEMS OR WHATEVER 
FINE 
BUT I DON'T UH I D I DON'T THINK THIS IS A POINT THAT'S WORTH SORT OF WORRYING ABOUT IT THIS STAGE ANYWAY 
I MEAN 
WELL 'CAUSE I'M I'M SORT OF ASSUMING THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE AS AN END POINT DETECTION REGARDLESS OF THIS WORKING ON THIS NUANCE CORPUS 
SO 
WE NEED TO FOR ME 
WE NEED TO FOR UM THE ONLINE DEMO 
FOR UH ALL THESE THINGS YEAH 
IT'S IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT THEN YOU WOULD THINK 
WELL IT'S SPEECH AND ANY AND ANY OTHER CLASS OF SOUND 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
IT'S 
AND SO 
AND ANY OTHER CLASS YEAH 
IF IT WAS JUST SILENCE IT'D BE EASY 
BUT UH UM AND IN CONTROLLED PLACES YOU CAN'T JUST ASSUME IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW ANY ENERGY BELOW A CERTAIN THRESHOLD 
AND THIS IS WHAT EVERYBODY SORT OF CLAIMED THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED WITH YEARS AGO 
BUT 
WELL I MEAN THIS IS ONCE AGAIN A 
YEAH SURE 
BUT I MEAN THIS IS ONCE AGAIN A VERY CONSTRAINED TASK AGAIN 
I MEAN IT'S IT'S IT'S Y YOU'RE ALMOST ASSURED IT'S ONLY GONNA BE A SINGLE SPEAKER ON THE MICROPHONE 
SO I MEAN THE THE ONLY SORTS OF NOISE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH UH IS IS IS HISS OR IMPULSIVE I WOULD SAY 
OR OR THAT WOULD BE A GOOD START 
NO NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT WAS SHOWING THAT 
UM YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM I TAKE OUT THERE 
NO 
OKAY 
WELL IT'D BE NICE TO GET THE THESIS I THINK 
THERE'S A SORT OF JUST A RESEARCH REPORT SORT OF BASIS FOR THIS 
YEAH 
BUT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
APPLY SOME PRESSURE 
OH NO NO IT SHOULD BE LOOKING TOWARDS THE START OF NEXT YEAR BASICALLY 
THE USE IT SO I MEAN YOU SHOULD 
OKAY WHICH IS 
YEAH 
AND IT'S NICE TO GET SOME FEEDBACK ONE I MEAN THAT FEEDBACK WILL PROBABLY COME AFTER YOUR PROPOSAL POSSIBLY 
BUT UM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
EXACTLY 
NO YEAH SORT OUT ANY BUGS OR WHATEVER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I I I'D PREFER TO GO BACK TO THE C. T. S. MODELS I THINK AS WELL 'CAUSE I THINK I THINK THEY DID WORK A LITTLE BIT BETTER 
SO YEAH 
YEP 
HAYES IS ANOTHER ONE ISN'T IT 
OH OKAY SORRY 
I WAS LIKE 'CAUSE I SAW YOU SLI I SAW YOU LOOKING AT YOUR WATCH BEFORE AND I LIKE WOW 
GONNA HAVE TO USE HAVE THIS AMI CORPUS LINKED IN IN TIME 
OH OKAY 
UH NOT NORMALLY YEAH 
IT COULD GO TO THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH WE'VE BEEN TOLD 
OKAY 
FINE 
OKAY WE START WAITING FOR PEOPLE COMING LATE AND UH I CAN SAY THIS BECAUSE IN THIS MOMENT YOU CANNOT ANSWER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MICROPHONE 
SO I CAN SAY WHATEVER AND YOU CANNOT REPLY 
SO YEAH 
YOU 
IN MY OPINION IT IS NO BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE LANGUAGE 
I MEAN INTUITIVELY OF COURSE YOU TEND TO USE MORE THE WORDS THAT ARE IN THE SLIDE 
BUT THE MASS OF THE WORDS ACTUALLY YOU S ARE WORDS THAT ARE COMMON 
JUST THINK THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WORDS ON AVERAGE WHATEVER CORPUS YOU TAKE ARE STOP WORDS ARTICLES ET CETERA 
SO IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION FIFTY PERCENT GOES AWAY 
OF THE REST UH REMAINING FIFTY PERCENT I MEAN ARE ALL WORDS THAT APPEAR IN TWO THREE TIMES 
SO IN ANY CASE EVEN IF ACTUALLY AND THEY TEND TO BE UH RELATED OR A STATISTICALLY RELATED TO A SINGLE SLIDE IN ANY CASE IN TERMS OF UH RECOGNITION DO NOT HELP AT ALL OR HELP A VERY LITTLE 
SO UH THAT'S THE KIND OF THING UH I MEAN THAT'S THE KIND OF MEASURE THE IND STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE IS NOT ONE SINGLE WORDS 
HMM 
YOU KNOW 
EVEN IF ACTUALLY I REMEMBER I JUST MADE SOME MEASURE UH SAYING OKAY L LET'S LOOK AT HOW MANY WORDS I DON'T HAVE ON THE DICTIONARY AND OR IN THE SLIDES 
IT WAS TWO PERCENT 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
SO SOME IN SOME SENSE IT INTUITIVELY IT SOUNDS VERY GOOD 
BUT IN PRACTICAL TERMS IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION UH HERE WE WE WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR 
IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION THAT IM IMPROVES VERY SLIGHTLY 
UH IT IS DIFFERENT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THEIR TASKS WHERE THE ONLY WORDS THAT ALL ARE WORDS 
NO THAT CASE EVEN THE SLIGHT IMPROVEMENTS UH HE GETS TO THAT POINT THEY CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 
BUT DOES THE RECOGNITION 
AND SOME WAY THE STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE I THINK IT CAN BE A GOOD EXPLANATION TO SHOW WHY IT IS HAPPEN EVEN IF IT IS COUNTERINTUITIVE 
BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS BASICALLY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
B B B BE CAREFUL IT'S NOT EXACTLY THIS BECAUSE FOR SURE THERE ARE WORDS THAT TEND TO BE 
SO THE POINT IS YOU WANT TO VERIFY WHETHER YOU CAN IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION RATE BY SEEING AS AN INFORMATION THE WORDS THAT UH OR CONTINUE ON THE SLIDES 
SO BASICALLY THE IDEA IS THAT UH IN THE MOMENT YOU ARE IN THE SLIDE SOMEWHERE YOUR LANGUAGE CHANGE ACCORDINGLY TO THE SLIDE 
SO THE FACT OF HAVING THAT INFORMATION SOMEWHERE CAN HELP YOU TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION 
BUT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS 
AND THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN FOR MANY REASON 
FIRST FOR EXAMPLE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WORDS IN ANY KIND OF TEXT OR STOP WORDS 
SO ARE EVERYWHERE 
AND THE REMAINING A PAPER SO LITTLE THAT IN THE CASE CANNOT REALLY IMPROVE THAT MUCH 
MOST OF THE WORDS WE USE ACTUALLY WHATEVER WE TALK ABOUT ARE COMMON UH WORDS 
SO HOW TO VERIFY THIS 
I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN MEASURED ET CETERA BUT STILL USE A BIT QUALITATIVE 
TO HAVE A QUANTITATIVE MEASURE MM-HMM WE SIMPLY ADD UH A MEASURE OF STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE WORDS IN GENERAL 
IS NOT SOME WORDS THE WORDS IN GENERAL 
OTHERWISE YOU CAN SEE THAT OF A WORDS APPEAR ONCE BASICALLY IT IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RELATED TO ONE SLIDE HUH 
BUT YOU HAVE TO I IF YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION HAVE TO MAKE IT OVERALL 
I MEAN WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS NOT THE WORD THAT APPEAR ONCE IT'S THE WORD THAT PAPER 
IF UH I EXACTLY 
IF IF THERE IS ONE WORD THAT APPEAR ONCE ALL OVER THE MEETING 
IT APPEARS IN CORRESPONDENCE OF ONE SLIDE THEN OF COURSE IT SEEMS TO BE VERY RELATED 
BUT VERY FEW WORDS UH THEY REPRESENT A VERY LITTLE PART OF THE WORD MASS MM 
SO WE SIMPLY USED A VERY OLD TEST STATISTICAL TEST 
THAT BASICALLY MEASURE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SOME WAY THE PROBABILITY OF HAVING ONE WORD IN CORRESPONDENCE OF A CERTAIN SLIDE IS SIMPLY THE PRODUCT OF THE PROBABILITY OF THE WORD FOR THE PROBABILITY OF THE 
THAT'S IT 
SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID 
BUT AS IN GENERAL THE LANGUAGE AND NOT CERTAIN WORDS 
BECAUSE CERTAIN WORDS FOR SURE HAVE A STRONG DEPENDENCY ON THE SLIDES 
BUT THERE ARE L FEW 
YEAH 
FLUCTUATIONS 
MM-HMM 
IT IS NOT IN TERMS I MEAN FOR ME FOR EXAMPLE IT WAS NOT IN THE SENSE THAT UH AFTER WORKING A LITTLE BIT ON LANGUAGE YOU REALISE THAT THIS KIND OF THING DO NOT HELP SIMPLY BECAUSE MOST OF THE WORDS UH HAVE NOTHING TO DO SPECIFICALLY WITH THE SUBJECT YOU SEE 
UH MOST OF THE WORDS WE USE UH THAT'S STRANGE ABOUT OUR SIMPLY NECESSARY TO BUILD A SENTENCE 
THERE ARE VERY FEW UH CONTENT UH WORDS 
BUT IT IS TRUE THAT INTUITIVELY UH SO WE ARE DRIVEN IN OUR ATTENTION UH I MEAN IN IN OUR UNDERSTANDING WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DRIVEN BY ATTENTION 
THAT WE TEND TO SPOT ONLY THOSE WORDS 
EXACTLY AND IN SOME SENSE INTUITIVELY IT SEEMS THAT IT CAN HAPPEN 
I MEAN THIS IS NOT THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO DO THINGS LIKE THIS AND IT NEVER WORKS ACTUALLY I IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION 
FOR OTHER TASK IT CAN BE UH IT CAN BE UH HELPFUL 
YEAH 
YEP 
BE CAREFUL 
CORRELATE IS A DANGEROUS WORD IN STATISTIC 
IT SEEMS TO BE THE OPPOSITE AS BEFORE 
THE 
OR ROUGHLY 
BASICALLY UH ONE THING IT CAN'T BE DONE 
AND AND HERE UH IN THE CONTRARY FOR EXAMPLE THE FEW WORDS THAT ARE MM HOW MAY I SAY IT RECOGNIZED MORE CAN REALLY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 
IT ISN'T THE CASE IF YOU WANT TO USE OF UH I MEAN WHAT IF SEEN IN THE MEETING AND THAT OKAY 
THERE ARE PRESENTATION 
THEN YEAH STILL THE SLIDE IS THERE 
BUT ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT OTHER THINGS 
OR NOT REALLY OTHER THINGS ABOUT THE SLIDE IS NO LONGER UH A SUPPORT FOR THE DISCUSSION HUH 
THERE ARE MOMENT THAT ACTUALLY THIS IS THE SUPPORT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE DESCRIBE ET CETERA 
AND THERE ARE MOMENT WHERE IT IS NOT 
IS A JUST A BACKGROUND UH THING 
AND WE ROUGH ESTIMATED VERY QUICKLY 
BUT IT WAS ONE THIRD OF THE TIME 
AT LEAST IN IN THE MEETING WE HAVE SEEN 
THE SLIDE WERE JUST THERE I MEAN BUT THEY WERE NO LONGER SO AS A SUPPORT 
IT WAS A DISCUSSION RATHER BETWEEN PEOPLE 
SO ON THAT CASE THE PRESENCE OR THE ABSENCE AND ESPECIALLY THE FREQUENCE WITH WHICH YOU OBSERVE THE WORDS THAT ARE IN THE SLIDES CAN BE AN EXCELLENT UH UH COOL 
HUH 
INDICATION A CLEAR INDICATION WHETHER ACTUALLY DOES IT SUPPORT OF THE DISCUSSION OR NOT 
UH IT CAN BE THIS 
IT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A KIND OF FOCUS OF INTEREST 
IT CAN BE SIMPLY INTERPRETED IN THE SENSE OF SAYING OH OKAY I MEAN YOU HAVE THIS CHANNEL OPEN THERE 
DO I HAVE TO P TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT OR NOT 
ARE ALSO IN TERMS OF ACTION 
YEAH UH WHEN YOU SEE THAT IS THE DISCUSSION IS COMPLETELY M DISCONNECTED WITH RESPECT TO THIS SOME WAY UH IT MEANS THAT IT'S HAPPEN IN SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE 
SO I MEAN IT'S A KIND OF AFTER THAT IN MY OPINION CAN BE EASY TO DETECT IT AND UM THAT CAN 
YEAH UH F CAN BE INTERESTING TO DO 
RELATIVELY EASY TO DO 
AND UH IN THAT CASE FOR EXAMPLE THE FEW WORDS MM THAT YOU THAT YOU GET MORE CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 
UH IS IS THAT MM DOUBLE WAY TO TO SHOW HOW SOME WAY DEPENDENT ON THE TASK 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXACTLY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SOME WAY WELL THERE ARE F YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM HMM 
YEAH I KNOW THIS WE ARE IS IS TALKING ABOUT TODAY SHORT TERM IF YOU WANT 
UH THINGS JUST TO THE USE THE THINGS 
I MEAN ALL THE WORK THEY THAT HAS DONE BASICALLY WHICH IS A HUGE WORK 
AND THE DATA WE HAVE THEN UH ENOUGH FOR THE FOR A THESIS OF COURSE IT MUST BE MUCH BETTER 
BUT OF COURSE THE THERE'S ONLY TWO TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORDS 
SOME OF THEM YOU CAN DO IT IN A SINGLE MEETING 
SO THIS KIND OF FEATURE EXTRACTION BECAUSE BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT IT IS SAYING YES IN THIS CHANNEL IS GOOD 
NOW IS BACKGROUND 
NOW IS FOREGROUND ET CETERA 
YOU CAN PUT IT IN THAT IN THAT WAY 
THIS YOU DO IT IN A SINGLE MEETING 
AND THEN THERE ARE CORPUS UM BASED UM HOW MAY I SAY IT WORKS SO YEAH THAT IS ONE POSSIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE FINDING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT MEETINGS 
THEN I DON'T KNOW 
I MEAN IT THAT POINT IT BECOMES PRETTY MUCH CRUCIAL THE KIND OF UH DATA YOU HAVE ON THE SENSE THAT FOR THE WAY WE HAVE COLLECTED THE DATA SOME WAY I DON'T KNOW IF IT CAN BE AT THE SAME TIME TO SAY IN THE SENSE THAT SOME WAY YOU HAVE LITTLE GROUPS OF MEETINGS EXTREMELY CORRELATED 
SO I MEAN IT IT MAKES IT EASIER 
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH SIGNIFICANT CAN BE AT THAT LEVEL 
IT CAN BE 
I IN A SENSE 
IF YOU WANT UH THIS KIND OF WORDS BECOME INTERESTING WHEN THE CORPUS IS REALLY BIG UH UH WHEN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU CONSIDER EACH MEETING IS A SINGLE ITEM 
SO IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU HAVE TENS HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF MEETINGS WHICH IS NOT THE CASE 
BUT I MEAN YOU CAN DO THEIR WORK IF YOU CONSIDER IN TERMS OF SPEAKER TURNS OR IN TERMS OF SLIDES AND THAT IS IMMEDIATELY MULTIPLY 
YEAH 
YEP YEP 
THAT IS ANOTHER 
SO IT CAN BE ONE MORE AFTER THAT HELPS IN BUT IT IS VERY SHORT TERM 
I MEAN JUST UH WELL IT IS JU JUST FEW FEW FEW TIMES WE TALK TOGETHER AND IT WAS JUST 
MEAN THE VERY QUICK THING YOU CAN CAN HAVE UH LIKE THIS 
MM-HMM 
BUT I THINK IN A SENSE IN MY OPINION WELL THERE ARE TWO THINGS 
WHEN THIS UH STATISTICAL TEST IT CAN BE WE HAVE MADE AN EXPERIMENT WE GOT A RESULT SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVE WE GIVE AN EXPLANATION 
AND UH THAT'S IT 
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SOME WAY CLOSES HERE 
SO WHEN IT GIVES YOU THE KIND OF ANSWER YOU GOT IS THAT OKAY TO GO ON THAT IN THAT DIRECTION MAYBE IS NOT THE BEST THING 
MAYBE TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION THAT WAY IS NOT UH SOMETHING YOU CAN EXPECT 
SO IT GIVES THE POSSIBILITY TO DECIDE TO GO UH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAT CAN BE MORE IN THIS UH LET'S SAY 
THIS IS 
HMM 
MM-HMM HMM 
WELL UH I THINK THE ADVANTAGE EVENTUALLY W I MEAN THE ADVANTAGE WITH THIS KIND OF THINGS IS THAT ARE MUCH EASIER 
GAZE TRACKING IS STILL 
JUST WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IS A DIFFICULT THING 
I MEAN IT REQUIRES CAMERAS WITH PRETTY GOOD QUALITY ET CETERA 
UH BUT I THINK HIS QUESTION IS MORE UH GENERAL 
A AND IT SAYS SO I MEAN BASED ON THIS WORK DO YOU FIGURE OUT UH A DIRECTION IF THEY GUESS CORRECTLY 
UH A DOMAIN A DIRECTION FOR YOUR THESIS FOR YOUR EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
NO DOMAIN YEAH 
NOT A COLLECTION OF LITTLE UH THINGS COMPLETELY UNRELATED 
BUT UH 
THAT'S VERY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UM BUT STILL DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF SAYING WHAT I YEAH YEAH SURE SURE 
WHAT I WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO FOR YOUR THESIS 
I MEAN AS HERVE SAID I MEAN BASICALLY IF YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN ONE FOR LINES 
WHAT WILL BE THE TOPIC OF MY THESIS THE SUBJECT OF MY THESIS 
AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT JUST SAYING I'M GOING TO DO UH THIS THIS THIS AND THAT 
I MEAN BECAUSE THIS WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW 
BUT YEAH IN A VERY BROAD SENSE I MEAN W WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE WHAT KIND OF UH 
IF I INTERPRET CORRECTLY 
THEN UH ONE BASIC THING I SUGGESTED EVEN THINKING ABOUT I MEAN IS EXACTLY THIS STRU ALL THESE SCENARIOS THAT CAN BE A MEETING 
THAT CAN BE PRESENTATION WHERE YOU HAVE A AS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPEECH BETWEEN THINGS THAT ARE USED AND UH SOME TEXTUAL DOCUMENTS SOME WAY 
WHY NOT TRY TO TO TO TO STUDY THIS RELATIONSHIP TO IMPROVE THIS RELATIONSHIP TO USE THIS RELATIONSHIP FOR UM MM WHATEVER IT IS 
INDEXING OR ANNOTATION OR WHATEVER META DATA EXTRACTION 
AND IF YOU WANT FOR EXAMPLE THIS LITTLE WORK UH ABOUT SEEING WHEN THE SLIDE CHANNEL IS BACKGROUND AND FOREGROUND IS NOT BEGINNING OF THOSE KIND OF THING 
IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO CHANNEL THAT PROVIDE SOME KIND OF INFORMATION 
MM-HMM 
SURE 
SURE 
SURE SURE SURE SURE 
MM-HMM 
NO NO BE CAREFUL 
FOR THE RECOGNITION IN GENERAL THERE IS NO CORRELATION IN THE SENSE THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE SLIDE 
MOST OF THE WORDS YOU USE MOST OF THE WORDS YOU USE OR NOT REALLY CORRELATED TO THAT 
ARE SIMPLY WORDS 
AND CONSIDER ALSO THAT WE ALL SPEAK ENGLISH HERE 
AND PART OF UH NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED VOCABULARY IN GENERAL 
SO WE TEND TO USE ALWAYS THE SAME WORDS 
BUT AN AVERAGE YOU KNOW LINGUISTIC RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AN AVERAGE THE PEOPLE USE FIVE HUNDRED WORDS 
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE A DISPOSITION 
AND WE SAY EVERYTHING UH YEAH 
WE SAY EVERYTHING WITH THAT 
AND PROBABLY WE NOT A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER WE USE EVEN LESS 
SO THAT'S GIVES AN IDEA OF WHY BASICALLY IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS USE ANYWAY THE SAME WORDS 
AND A FEW OCCURRENCES OF WORDS THAT ARE THERE IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION MAKE ONE TWO PERCENT 
SO MAYBE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY UH AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION 
THEN YOU CAN CHANGE OF TASK AND AS A TASK THE TASK WE WERE MENTIONING ABOUT THE BACK CHANNEL OR FOREGROUND CHANNEL 
NO THAT CASE THE ONLY WORDS THAT REALLY ARE IMPORTANT ARE THOSE WORDS THAT APPEAR ON BOTH SLIDES 
IT THAT POINT I MEAN A LITTLE IMPROVEMENT OF THAT IT BECOMES A BIG IMPROVEMENT 
I MEAN MAYBE IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION IT'S ZERO POINT FIVE PERCENT 
BUT IN TERMS OF THAT TASK IS MAYBE TWENTY PERCENT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S ANOTHER INTERESTING POINT 
I MEAN WE ARE USING DATA THAT ARE FAKE 
ANY UH IN ANY CASE THEY ARE SIMULATION NO REAL DATA 
AND ESPECIALLY THE SLIDES 
I THINK I'VE SEEN THOSE SLIDES 
I MEAN THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH ARTIFICIAL 
EXACTLY 
BUT BUT NOT PRE PREPARE 
BUT 
YEAH BUT 
YEAH I YEAH I MEAN UH EVERYTHING IS PRETTY MUCH ARTIFICIAL 
THAT THAT'S WHAT I MEAN 
SO YOU MENTION FOR EXAMPLE THIS UH FACT THAT SOMETIMES UH SPEAKERS TEND TO READ 
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN YOU HAVE BULLET LIST HUH 
SOMETIMES PEOPLE REALLY GO THROUGH 
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE DATA SIMPLY BECAUSE UH UH IT WAS NOT THE SAME PEOPLE PREPA UH EXACTLY 
OH 
SO FOR EXAMPLE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE IN ANY CASE BECAUSE THE HERVE'S INFRASTRUCTURE IS READY AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO COLLECT THE PRESENTATION 
THERE MAYBE WE CAN SEE 
THE IDEA IS IS IS VERY BAD 
I I THING IS REALLY 
YOU KNOW THAT WAS COLLECTED M A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS WITHOUT UH TOO MUCH CARE 
IT WAS IT WAS UH A PERSONAL EFFORT OF EMAIL THAT DECIDED TO DO IT 
IT WAS REALLY GOOD TO DO IT 
IT WAS VERY GOOD 
BUT BASICALLY IT WAS MADE WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC KNOW WITHOUT THINKING WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE JUST TO HAVE THEM 
SO THE ESPECIALLY THE AUDIO CHANNEL IS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OH THAT'S UH THAT'S THAT IS ONE OF THE REASON FOR EXAMPLE WHY WHICH UH MARK WE POINT PRETTY MUCH ON SLIDES AS A MENU OF INDEXING 
BECAUSE IT THAT POINT THERE IS NO INTERACTION BETWEEN HUMANS AND CAPTURE 
BECAUSE WHENEVER YOU HAVE MICROPHONES THAT YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT'S IT'S IT BECOMES COMPLETE UH REALLY 
YEAH 
WE ARE BUILDING THIS SLOWLY 
I MEAN IT'S IT'S UNFORTUNATE 
I MEAN IS IS IS TAKING TIME FOR THE MATERIAL AND SO NO 
BUT YEAH 
THERE WILL BE THIS 
UH IT WILL BE ONE CAMERA POINTING VERY GENERAL BUT JUST FOR DISPLAY PURPOSES ESSENTIALLY 
NO UH MICROPHONE 
AND WE ARE THINKING TO USE UH LAPEL MICROPHONE YOU KNOW THIS THIS THING 
AND SO THAT POTENTIALLY HELPFUL HOPEFULLY HELPFUL TO TO DO RECOGNITION 
AND IT SLIDES THROUGH THE PROJECTOR 
WE 
LET'S SAY THAT UH IN ANY CASE UH W WELL THERE ARE TWO REASON 
FIRST OF ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT CAN BE EASILY THE THE THE IDEA IS REALLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU TAKE YOU BRING SOMEWHERE ELSE AND IT WORKS 
SO IT MUST BE AS EASY AS POSSIBLE 
BUT IN ANY CASE I MEAN THE DEVICE WE ARE DOING HAS INPUT CHANNELS 
SO SOME WAY YOU CAN ADD AS MANY INPUT SO WE WANT 
SO WE ARE DEALING NOW WITH THREE 
BUT THERE ARE OTHER INPUT UH LINES OPEN 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
ALTHOUGH IT THAT POINT WE CAN USE THIS 
I MEAN I WAS MENTION THE THE LAPEL MICROPHONE MM JUST LIKE THIS 
BUT IF YOU TELL ME THIS THAT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE AT THIS POINT WE CAN USE THIS KIND OF THINGS 
BUT I DON'T WHY WHY NOT UH IS THERE WILL BE THEIR DATA THEIR TEST DATA 
UH AND ESPECIALLY FOR THIS KIND OF PROBLEM I THINK IT CAN BE A MUCH MORE USEFUL KIND OF DATA BECAUSE THERE IS ORAL PRESENTATIONS 
I MEAN SO IT'S REALITY 
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S UH YOU ON IT IT IT IT'S EXACTLY 
IT'S MORE REALISTIC AND UM YEAH PROBABLY IT CAN HELP GO ON THIS DIRECTION OF SAYING WELL LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPEN BETWEEN SPEECH AND SLIDES 
OH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
OKAY THAT IS COOL 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S COOL 
OH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH IT'S A IT'S A EUROPEAN PROJECT ANYWAY 
SO I GUESS UH IT MUST BE AVAILABLE SOMEWHERE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM 
YEAH MM-HMM 
BUT ONLY WE'RE MEASURING ONE THIRD 
IT'S NOT 
AT LEAST NO NO I'M UH TALKING NOW BUT UM THE MEETING 
HOW PRESENTATION OF COURSE 
NO PRESENTATION TO IT SHOULD BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH OF COURSE 
NO THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT IN MY OPINION UH WITH THE WORK THAT'S BEEN ALREADY DONE IS SOMETHING WE CAN GET PRETTY QUICKLY 
IT'S AN INTERESTING TASK 
IT'S MORE SPECIFIC ON UH MEETINGS 
CERTAINLY NOT FOR UH FOR PRESENTATION 
AND TO REPRESENT A NICE TASK THAT CAN BE MEASURED THAT IS CLEAR AND 
MM YEAH 
YEAH 
UH I IN TERMS OF ACTUAL RECOGNITION CAN OF COURSE UH HELP 
SO IT'S IT'S UH BIT OF COURSE NOT GOING TO BE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A KIND OF THESIS ABOUT THIS 
NO THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE 
I MEAN 
THAT UH IN A SENSE IF YOU WANT I MEAN THAT THAT'S AT LEAST THE WAY I SEE THE THAT LAST I HAVE MADE FOR MY OWN THESIS 
I MEAN UH YOU DEFINE THAT DOMAIN I MEAN WHICH IS UH LARGE I MEAN WHICH CAN BE VERY GENERAL 
SO INTERACTION BETWEEN UH SPEECH AND SLIDES COOL 
AND THEN YOU SEE HOW ALL THESE THINGS THESE TWO LITTLE WORKS OR THE STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE 
AND DETECTING WHEN IT IS UH OR TWO LITTLE WORKS THAT SOME WAY FIT IN THAT VERY GENERAL UH FRAMEWORK 
SHOWN FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW IT IN THAT THINGS MM THERE ARE OTHER THINGS 
FOR EXAMPLE IN THAT I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO DO WHICH IS KIND OF FUN 
SO WHEN YOU HAVE A BULLET LIST CAN I CLICK ON ONE OF THE BULLET AND GET THE PIECE OF SPEECH WHERE THE GUY WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT 
BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST READ 
SOMETIMES PEOPLE UH IM IMPROVE IS MORE UH SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHAT THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT FITS IN THAT KIND OF UH MM FRAMEWORK 
AND THAT'S INTERESTING IN TERMS OF UH I MEAN FIRST OF ALL AGAIN IS MEASURABLE IN TERMS OF BROWSING 
IN TERMS OF RETRIEVAL IN TERMS OF INDEXING ANNOTATION META DATA EXTRACTION 
THAT CAN BE APPLIED IN MANY 
THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW THAT UH THAT'S UH THAT'S SOMETHING UH YOU'RE MAYBE JOKING NOW 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN UH BE DONE FOR EXAMPLE 
AND UH SOME WAY THERE ARE PARAMETERS THAT CAN BE MEASURED THAT TELL YOU THAT FOLLOWING CERTAIN UH CRITERIA UH THERE IS ONE VERY EASY FOR EXAMPLE 
I HAD THE THE THE SP THERE ARE SPEAKER THAT NEVER LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE 
THESE ARE BAD SPEAKERS IN GENERAL 
IT'S VERY WRONG 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE 
THIS IS NO 
THERE IS FOR EXAMPLE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVENTUALLY CAN BE DONE 
IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WORDS IN YOUR SLIDES YOU NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO READ THEM 
THE SPEAKERS THAT TAKE A TIME WHICH IS TO CLOSE TO THAT THEY ARE NOT GOOD SPEAKER BECAUSE SOME WAY UH UM THEY'RE TALKING TOO FAST 
THEY ARE NOT UH 
YEAH THEY ARE NOT GIVING YOU THE TIME 
AND THERE IS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CAN BE UH SOME WAY DETECTED AND MEASURED THAT TELL YOU WHETHER THE SPEAKER IS ACTUALLY RESPECTING SOME FORM OF UH UH 
IT'S A BIT UH OF HAVING DIFFICULT AND UH I WOULD NOT UM GO THAT MUCH ON THAT DIRECTION 
I MEAN IT'S UH BUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW UH 
FIGURE YOU KNOW 
TABLES NUMBER 
AH VISUAL THINGS 
WELL THAT'S FOR EXAMPLE WITH UH WE SUBMITTED A PROJECT WITH J JEAN MARC UM IT IS THAT THING AS META DATA 
AND BASICALLY ONE THING FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND AND AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN FIT HUH 
IT WILL BE NOT UH MAYBE 
BUT BUT UH IF YOU GET THE PROJECT ET CETERA IN ANY CASE IT'S SOMETHING THAT JEAN MARC AND UM WE WANT TO DO 
UH BASED ON THE KIND OF GRAPHIC OBJECT YOU HAVE SO TABLES QUESTIONS 
UH FIGURES PLOTS ET CETERA THE SIDE ONE FOR EXAMPLE IT IS A RESULT 
TRY TO GET SO THAT'S AGAIN IN TERMS OF STRUCTURING BROWSING STRUCTURE AND RETRIEVAL OKAY WHEN IT IS A RESULT 
WHEN IT IS AN INTRODUCTION 
WHEN IT IS UH 
YEAH 
YES YES YES YES YES YES 
OH 
UM 
IT'S NOT REALLY TRUE 
IT'S NOT REALLY IT'S NOT REALLY TRUE 
YEAH YEAH IT'S NOT REALLY TRUE 
YEAH THAT'S O IT'S ONE OF THE MOST FUNNY THING I MEAN YOU CAN SEE WHEN YOU WORK ON THIS THING 
EACH ONE OF US HAS AN IDEA AND THEN IT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL 
I MEAN IS SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE STICK VERY CAREFULLY 
OF THE P IF THEY PUT IN THE OUTLINE UH LET'S SAY TITLE ONE TITLE TWO THEN YOU'LL YOU FIND TITLE ONE TITLE TWO 
BUT MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND I AM ONE OF THESE PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE ARE MUCH MORE GENERAL 
SO MY OUTLINE IS SOMETHING LIKE INTRODUCTION AND EXPERIMENTS THE RESULTS CONCLUSIONS 
YOU DON'T FIND THE SAME TITLE IN THE SLIDES 
IT'S IT'S REALLY A DIFFERENT STYLE OF UH THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T PUT FOR EXAMPLE OUTLINE 
WE WERE UH FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AMI CORPUS OF M. L. M. A. IS THE ONE IS IN THE DEMO 
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PRESENTATION HAVE NO OUTLINE 
IN THE CORPUS OF THE TIME TWO THOUSAND FOUR TAM PRESENTATION TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PRESENTATION HAVE NO OUTLINE AT ALL 
THAT'S THAT'S UH WHAT YEAH UH W IT IS 
AND BASICALLY THAT'S THAT'S UH AND AGAIN THE OUTLINE IS TYPICAL MAYBE IN SCIENTIFIC PRESENTATION 
WELL IN THAT CASE THAT MAJORITY HAS 
OTHER KIND OF PRESENTATION PROBABLY ONE 
I MEAN IT'S IT'S AN HABIT WE HAVE 
BUT UM YOU BUT AGAIN UH 
I MEAN UNFORTUNATELY THE IN THERE IS NOTHING TRUE 
NOTHING TRUE IS IS EVERYTHING IS CHANCE PRETTY MUCH 
SO UH THAT WAS NO 
NO POSSIBLE WORK 
MM-HMM 
NOT MAYBE 
FOR SURE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I SEE 
I KNOW 
YEAH YEAH 
I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW 
I SEE 
AND SO ESSENTIALLY SAY WELL SO THERE IS THIS SILENCE TIME WHICH TEND TO BE EVEN MORE THAN THAN HOW TO USE 
IS BETTER TO HAVE A KIND OF SILENCE DETECTION 
SO SOMETHING THAT REALLY TAKES THIS AND THEY RECOGNIZE ONLY THAT UH THAT PART 
THIS WILL IMPROVE THE PHONEME UH RECOGNITION RATE 
THAT'S WHAT OUT OF OF COURSE OF COURSE OF COURSE 
AND IT THAT POINT EVEN THE UH CALL ROUTER THAT UH JEAN JEAN YVES HAS UH MADE CAN IMPROVE UH ITS PERFORMANCE 
AND IT CAN BE USED AFTER UH TOOL FOR THE MEASURE WORK 
OH 
THAT WE GOT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SURE SURE 
THEN UH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
I KNOW 
I KNOW THE PROBLEM 
I SEE 
I SEE 
I SEE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
I SEE 
I SEE THE PROBLEM 
I'M NOT NOT SURE IT'S 
YEAH 
I'M ALSO 
NO 
NO 
MM-HMM 
MM 
NO NO 
BASICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT TO UH IT A LEVEL THAT COULD BE ANYWAY 
SO THE IDEA WAS GOOD 
I THINK YEAH WITH A BETTER UH PHONEME RECOGNITION RATE DEFINITELY IT COULD UH IMPROVE ALSO THE THE CALL ROUTING PERFORMANCE 
NOPE 
BUT WE CAN WE CAN FIND 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
BUT WE CAN SOME WAY FIND A GUY 
I MEAN THIS SHOULD SHOULD BE HAVE ALL DETAILS 
SO IT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY TO AT LEAST THIS IS THE LAST NEWS I HAD AND THEN I CAN TRY TO GET HIM BACK 
OH 
YEAH 
NO 
GOING VERY PRA PRAGMATIC UH THERE IS A SUBMISSION UH DEADLINE FOR EXAMPLE THIRTY ONE DECEMBER FOR CONFERENCE IN MULTI MEDIA AND EXPO WHERE I THINK THESE TWO LITTLE WORKS ON 
SO IT CAN BE 
IT'S IS A PROPOSAL 
BECAUSE AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THIS WORK ON THE PHONEME ANYWAY STILL TAKES SOME DEVELOPMENT TIME IN THE SENSE THAT UH NO 
OKAY 
I SEE 
MM-HMM 
AND 
YEAH 
ANYWAY THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE ARE RESULTS 
YOU ARE YOU HAVE JUST TO TO DECIDE UH YEAH WHAT WHAT WHAT UH WHAT YOU WANT TO WORK FIRST AND AND AND FINALISE 
I THINK YOU CAN REALLY START FINALISING MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IT'S OKAY 
SO THE TOP IS TA TAPE IS TO THE END 
YEAH 
COULD YOU JU JUST QUICKLY REWIND 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO NO 
WAIT WAIT 
IT'S GOING VERY FAST FOR ME ACTUALLY 
THING ACTUALLY 
IT'S VERY FAST 
SO WHA FIRST POINT THE FIRST THING YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU TAKE THE SLIDES AND YOU WAS AND YOU HAD A L BIG DICTIONARY AND YOU ARE USING UH WHAT WHAT ARE THE INSIDE THE SLIDE 
RIGHT 
UH WHAT THE 'CAUSE I FIRST STATEMENT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND 
UH WHEN YOU SAID THE THE ST UH UH THE S UH THE W YEAH 
SO W WHAT'S SO YEAH SO COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME LITTLE BIT MORE IN DETAIL 
YEAH 
NO NO NO DON'T GO THAT 
I I WANT THE ONE 
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THE W UH THE T UH THING LIKE SAYING THAT I TAKE A DICTIONARY AND THEN A WORD FROM THE SLIDE AND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR 
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND CLEARLY CLEARLY THAT 
MM MM-HMM 
OKAY BUT D HOW DO WHY DO YOU WANT CERTAIN WORDS 
LIKE WHA HOW DO YOU EXPECT THAT CERTAIN WORDS 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
IT APPEARS IN ALMOST UH UH TO SEE IF IT APPEARS IN ALL THE SLIDES IT SAYS A HUNDRED PERCENT CORRELATION FOR ME 
ONE PERCENT WELL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OR LIKE THAT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY IT'S INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER 
OKAY 
OKAY FINE THAT'S FINE THAT'S UH UH UH S CERTAIN WORDS IT SHOULD 
YOU HAVE TO 
OKAY 
FINE 
NOW I'M UH OKAY 
I'M NOT THE LOOP 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
CONTEXT 
BUT IT IS IMPLEMENTED IN THE U. S. R. 
OR UH WHERE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
ALSO INTERPOLATE EXTRAPOLATE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO YOU UM SO UH YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT UM LIKE WHEN IN CASE YOU WERE SAYING THAT IF YOU INCLUDE THE CONTEXT AND ALL THIS THING IT HELPS IN YOUR A. S. R. IMPROVEMENT 
BUT IT DOESN'T WHICH MORE SUBJECTIVE I THINK THIS WHOLE 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
YES 
YEAH 
MM 
MM YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT YEAH 
OR IT COULD 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO YOU SEE YOU SEE OKAY 
SO MAYBE LIKE IT CAN BE UH SOMETHING LIKE IN A MEETING IT CAN BE LIKE AN UNUSUAL SCENARIO FOR YOU IN A PRESENTATION WITH A SLIDE 
AND THE UNUSUAL SCENARIO THAT YOU'RE NOT USING THE UH SLIDE AT ALL 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WHAT ARE THE OTHER SOLID YEAH 
WE HAVE PLENTY OF THINGS TO DO 
WHAT TRACK 
YEAH 
GO ON 
YEAH IT'S NO PROBLEM 
OKAY 
SO UH WELL SO ULTIMATELY NOW THE NEXT STEP WHAT IS THAT 
BECAUSE I WANT LIKE KIND OF A UH IS IT FIRST YOU SAID THAT OKAY NOW YOU DID THIS 
THIS CORRELATION STUDIES 
AND THEY SHOW THAT THERE'S A VERY LESS CORRELATION OR IN FACT NO CORRELATION KIND OF THING 
AND UH UM UH SO UH SO WHAT NEXT ONE ON TOP OF IT WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD I MEAN IS THE QUESTION NOW 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SO IT I MEAN AT THE DIFFERENT DIRECTION NOW THAT'S WHAT I MEAN TO SAY 
WHAT YOU LIKE TO TAKE FROM THERE 
UH IT'S NOT DEFINED YET OKAY 
MM-HMM 
BUT WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM 
WE NEED A DEFINITION OF SOME KIND OF UH PROBLEM RIGHT 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
NO NO NO 
NO BUT 
YEAH DIRECTION 
YEAH THAT'S THAT IS A THING 
WE GO ON TO THE NEXT DIRECTION 
IT SHOULD NOT THAT I IT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN THAT YOU'RE DOING SO MANY THINGS AND ULTIMATELY IT DOESN'T GOES INTO A THESIS 
TH THAT'S THAT SHOULD NOT THE PROBLEM 
YOUR THESIS SHOULD BE W IN ONE DIRECTION 
NO PROBLEM 
AND UH SHOULD GO UH IN IN OUR UH AN IDEA YEAH 
IT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE 
UH THE IT MAY BE GOOD AS A C. V. FOR YOU BUT THEN AS A THESIS YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS UH DEFENDING IT AND ALL THESE THINGS 
SO WHAT IS THAT UH WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT POSSIBLE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO TAKE 
OH 
ERROR MEASURE 
IT'S YEAH 
YEAH EXACTLY 
MM 
SO SO THAT IS GOING TO TELL US UH SOMETHING LIKE UH WHA THE THING IS THAT I UH IT IT AS YOU CAN TOTALLY GO INTO THE TEXT DOMAIN AND BE THERE 
YOU KNOW 
IT CAN BE S NO PROBLEM 
BUT AS LONG AS UH IT IS OKAY 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO DO WITH UH IS LIKE CERTAIN SOMETHING WITH THE SPEED AND ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER THEN IT'S A DIFFERENT SCENARIO 
UH YOU MAY NOT WANT TO WORK ON ALL THE PROBLEMS 
SOMEONE MAY WORK ON SOME OTHER PROBLEM 
BUT THEN YOU YOU MAKE USE OF THAT TO EXTEND YOUR WORK ON SOME 
AND UH AND SO I ALSO IT IT DEPENDS LIKE ALSO LIKE I THINK OF UH BOSS IS INTERESTED IN WORKING ON BOTH SPEECH AND TEXT 
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND VERY WELL 
THAT PART IS ALSO THERE 
IN THE BOSS 
LIKE HAVE A IT'S LIKE INSTEAD OF SAYING LIKE YOU SHOULD LOOK WORK ON BOTH SIDE YOU KNOW THE TEXT AND THE SPEECH ASPECT OF IT 
SO YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH W ONE THING INTERESTING IS WHAT WE COME UP ON THE DISCUSSION ALSO YOU ABOUT TELLING THAT UH DETECTING SUCH SCENARIOS WHERE THERE IS NO RELATION BETWEEN THE SLIDE AND THE PERSON TALKING 
THAT MAY BE IN GOOD STARTING POINT FOR YOU ACTUALLY 
AND THEN IT THAT POINT YOU UH YOU DETECT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU SHOW SOMETHING LIKE UH WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT I IF THERE IS UH OF UH THERE I IF IT IS OUT OF DISCUSSION 
THE WORDS OR NO WAY ARE GOING TO HELP YOUR RECOGNITION ANYWAY A. S. R. 
BUT IF IT IS MORE ON THE UM THE SLIDE INFORMATION IS NOT GOING TO HELP YOU 
BUT UH IF IT IS UH IF IT IS RELATED TO THE SLI WHAT HE IS GIVING A PRESENTATION ON THE SLIDE THEN YOU SHOW THE YOUR A. S. R. IF YOU DETECT THIS EVEN THEN YOU CAN SHOW THAT HOW WHERE YOU CAN REALLY HELP OR NOT HELP 
BECAUSE YOU SAY THERE'S NO CORRELATION NOW 
BUT THEN HERE IT COMES THAT THERE AT SOME POINT THERE MIGHT BE A CORRELATION THERE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THE THE SIDES AND THE TALK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
LIKE ANOTHER MIC 
THE YEAH MOST OF THE MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE THE TITLE TO DO ONE 
THE AMI DATA THE AMI DATA WHAT THAT LIKE THAT ONLY MOST OF THE TIME YOU KNOW THEY HAD THE WORD 
THE WORD YOU ARE GOING TO PRESENT 
EVERYONE IS PRESENTING THE SAME SET OF SLIDE 
YEAH 
WHAT ABOUT M. L. M. A. 
W THE ONE WE COLLECTED LAST YEAR 
DO IS VERY BAD RIGHT 
YEAH 
UH ONE SINGLE CHANNEL OR AT LEAST A CLOSED CHANNEL COLLECTION NO 
OKAY OKAY OKAY 
IT WAS GOOD 
TH TH TH THAT 
OH OKAY 
SO THEY ARE SO THERE ARE STILL USING THAT UH DESKTOP MICROPHONE OR WHAT OVER THERE 
OR 
OH 
OH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THAT'S FINE YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S A 
YEAH IT'S A 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND 
OKAY SO NOW THERE BE UH WOULD BE SOME TIME WH WHAT IS WE SHOULD BE GETTING A TIME RECORDING SYSTEM RIGHT 
THAT UH UH UH SO 
MM 
OKAY 
LAPEL 
SHOULD BE OKAY 
NO IT IT'S IT'S UH QUITE A BIT YEAH PROBLEM TO DO THAT KIND OF THING 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH BUT PROBABLY WE WERE THE IF YOU KNOW THE PAST UH THE THE THING IS SOMEWHERE PROJECTOR 
SUPPOSE THERE'S LIKE THE THE WHITE BOARD OR WHATEVER THE PRESENTATION IS OVER THERE THE SPEAKER IS MORE PROBABLY IS GOING TO THIS WAY OR THAT WAY 
SO PROBABLY YOU YOU MAY NOT NEED A VERY BIG MICROPHONE THERE 
PROBABLY ONE OR TWO 
UH UH YOU UH YEAH 
OH YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
NO TH THEY TH TH TH 
CHIL MAY BE INTERESTING FOR YOU 
BUT IT'S A L UH WELL YEAH IT MAY BE INTERESTING FOR YOUR PROBLEM I THINK 
Y YEAH 
NO NO NO 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S MORE LIKE TIME 
BUT UH YEAH 
THE THE OTHER COLLECTION IS MUCH UH UH LIKE THEY HAVE UH R. T. N. S AND ALL THIS THING 
PEOPLE SITTING AND UH IT'S A LEC IT'S A LOCATOR UH A MEETING COLLECTION 
AND I UH IS IT THROUGH N N UH L. D. A. OR SOMETHING 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO IS PROBABLY WE CAN YEAH 
CHIL MAY BE INTERESTING ACTUALLY 
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT 
IN THE TEXT 
MM 
WELL BUT UH 
SO 
YEP 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S THAT'S A YEAH 
THAT THAT THEY HAVE 
MM 
THEY'RE TALKING FAST 
I HAD A PROBLEM I LIKE FIND THE ANSWER FOR MY OWN 
YEAH 
SO WHAT ABOUT THE FIGURE THINGS 
WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S A FIGURES COMING IN THE SLIDE 
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH THAT 
IN THE S UH-HUH 
EITHER STOP IT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
USUALLY IN PRODUCTS AND RESOURCES 
OKAY SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO BETWEEN THE DATA WHEN YOU COLLECT AND THIS 
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW 
BY THE TIME YOU GET THE DATA IT'S GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER TWO MONTHS IF I AM RIGHT THE WHOLE CAPTURING SYSTEM WHEN IT IS GOING TO COME 
SO WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP 
YEAH YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT IT IN LIKE TWO MONTHS ALSO AGAIN 
YEAH YEAH TO SUBMIT YEAH 
IT'S IN YOUR RIGHT 
FOR SURE 
YOU YOU NEED TO BAD 
CALL ROUTING WHERE 
THAT'S NOT 
I THINK WE SHOULD YEAH 
THIS IS YEAH 
UH UH UH 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
MM YEAH 
UH UH 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
EVEN IF LITTLE BIT OF 
OH 
THIS 
UH Y YEAH 
YEAH 
NO NO I THINK YOU YEAH IT'S UH IT'S HUGE 
YEAH 
IT IT IT'S NON DETERMINIST 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT IT 
YEAH 
EXA THAT'S THE INTENTION THERE 
MM YOU 
NO NO NO NO NO 
IT I 
YEAH 
SURELY THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT ACTUALLY 
SO MAYBE LIKE WE HAD TO DO THIS END POINT DETECTION AND PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT OF FINAL FILTERING 
AND THEN I THINK YOU SHOULD BE PRETTY MUCH CONVERGING TO THE SYSTEM 
BUT THE STILL THE REASON WITH THE THE THEY HAD LIKE WHAT ARE THE SYSTEMS WE TURN ON DATABASES ARE THEY ARE CHOP NEATLY 
THAT THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH SILENCE BEGINNING NOT TOO MUCH SILENCE AT THE END 
THEY ARE THEY ARE J THEY THEY CHOPPED SO NEATLY FOR THE IT LIKE CUSTOM MADE DATABASE 
BUT UH HERE IT'S NOT LIKE THAT YOU KNOW LIKE UH-HUH 
YEAH 
THERE ARE THE SEVERAL THINGS 
LIKE ONE THING IS LIKE WE CAN DO THIS BEGIN AND END DETECTION AS WE SAID 
OR YOU AND UH CAN UH WE CAN TRY TO USE UH FRANCE TELECOM'S UH APPROACH ACTUALLY 
AND THAT UM UH UH THEY THEY HAVE THIS FRONT AND WHICH UH UH WHICH WHICH CAN DO A SPECTRAL 
AND PLUS IT CAN GIVE YOU A VOICE ACTIVITY DETECTION 
PART OF APART FROM BASIS IT CAN GIVE 
SO SOMETHI WE CAN JUST YEAH WE CAN JUST RUN IT QUICKLY AND SO 
AND PROBABLY YOU WILL HAVE TO RUN IT 
WILL GIVE YOU THE IDEA THAT IS IT OKAY LIKE 
YEAH 
NO NO NO NO 
UH NOT RUNNING I MEAN TO SAY P PROBABLY UH UH SHOULD RUN IT OR UH LIKE WE CAN GE HELP HIM TO RUN IT ACTUALLY 
BECAUSE AT SOME POINT HE HAS TO GET INTO 
OH

IT'S QUITE GOOD FOR THE PROPOSAL DIRECTLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
I THINK UH WE WE MAY HAVE TO LOOK IT CAN HAVE A UH IT'S IT'S KIND OF LIKE UH UH MAYBE TAKE LIKE UH UH TWO OR THREE DAYS 
YOU KNOW LIKE TO SET OUT AND SAY UH ONE CONVERGE TO ONE APPROACH AND THEN JUST DO WITHOUT THAT YEAH 
AND PROBABLY YEAH 
SO THAT IS THE THING 
WE HAVE TO SORT OUT THE BIG KIND OF THING AND SEE HOW RELIABLE SO THIS END POINT DETECTION FOR US 
YEAH MM-HMM 
OH YEAH I THINK UH THEN WE CAN GO BACK TO C. T. S. ACTUALLY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND UH YEAH SO THAT IS THIS 
SO YOU WANTED TO TALK SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT 
WELL WE OBSTRUCTED YOU WITH THAT 
YOU WANTED TO TALK SOMETHING DIFFERENT ALSO 
NO 
OR MAYBE ANOTHER MEETING 
AND THEN I SAY I DON'T REMEMBER 
NO I WAS JUST LOOKING THIS 
OKAY UH WE ARE NOT OUT OF TIME YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH IT'S HAPPENED UH IT HAPPENED WITH MY FRIEND 
LIKE HE HE WAS TAKING PICTURES PICTURES PICTURES AND IT WAS GOING THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT FORTY EVEN 
SO I SAID THERE'S SOME PROBLEM WITH YOURS UH YOUR UH UH THE WAY UH UH PUT THE ROLL INSIDE 
THERE IS SOME PROBLEM IT HAS GOT STUCK SOMEWHERE 
IT CAN NEVER GO TO FORTY ONE FORTY YEAH I UH UH THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT IS FINE 
FORTY FORTY ONE IS ABOUT IS HE HAS ALREADY 
DON'T LISTEN 
OKAY 
THANKS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM A LITTLE BIT ABOUT UH I'M UM I'M NOT SURE HE KNOWS UH EVERYTHING 
SO UH BASICALLY UH WELL 
FIRST WE TRIED TO UM EXPLAIN WHY IN THIS UH RESC UH N. BEST LIST RE SCORING UH FROM THE SLIDES TO ENHANCE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IN THE MEETINGS DATA IS NOT WORKING 
SO UM UH THAT'S ONE THING 
AND UH SO WHAT WE DID WITH ALESSANDRO IS UH UM CH T UH PERFORMING SOME STATISTICAL TESTS TO USE WHATEVER AREA OF THE OF THE WORDS UH THE THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORDS DURING THE MEETING IS UH IN INDEPENDENT OF THE AP APPEARANCES OF THE DIFFERENT SLIDES 
SO THE ON THE CASE OF IT IS DEPENDENT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT CERTAIN WORDS TEND TO APPEAR DURING CERTAIN SLIDES AND THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION AND UH THEN THERE WILL BE UH A REASON LIKE FOR BELIEVING THAT UH THIS WILL WORK 
THE EARS THE RESULT WAS NO 
YEAH TRUE 
YEAH ALMOST NOTHING 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HUH 
SO MATTHEW WE WERE UH YEAH 
IT'S UH WE WERE TALKING THAT WE DID SOME EXPERIMENTS TO USE OF THE WORD DURING MEETING THE WORDS APPEAR INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SLIDES IN A SENSE THAT UH OF CERTAIN WORDS TEND TO APPEAR DURING CERTAIN SLIDES OR NO 
AND UH THE ANSWER IS UH NO 
AND UH SO WE DID A STATISTICAL TEST FOR THAT 
AND I WILL ADD ALSO THAT WE DID THAT IN THE UH W THE WORDS AFTER FILTERING THEM FROM THE REMOVING THE THE STOP WORDS 
YEAH SO UH SO UH BEC S BECAUSE YEAH 
WITH THE STOP WORDS OKAY TH THERE WOULD BE A REASON FOR UH IN INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE THERE IS UH SUCH A HUGE MESS OF THEM 
BUT UH EVEN UH AFTER REMOVING THEM UH THERE IT IT REMAINS UH INDEPENDENT 
AND ACTUALLY UH SO WHEN I WAS DOING THE RE SCORING EXPERIMENTS I WAS DOING THAT ONE UH ONE MEETING THAT I SELECTED AS BEING LIKE THE BEST LOOKING ONE 
UH TO UH IT HAD THE UM THE MOST UH SLIDES 
AND NOW I DID THE SAME UH IN UH THE OTHER MEETINGS WHICH WERE AVAILABLE WHERE WELL IT'S ONLY THREE MEETINGS BECAUSE WELL HERE THERE ARE FOUR OF THEM WHICH ARE FROM THE TEST SET UH FROM THE AMI RECOGNISER W BUT ONLY THREE OF THEM HAVE UH SLIDES 
SO IT'S TOTAL OF OTHER MEETINGS AND FOR THE OTHERS THE TENDENCY AND I C 'CAUSE YOU KNOW I WAS WHEN I WAS DOING RE SCORING 
I WAS UH TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FOR ONE GIVEN SLIDE ALSO THE N NEIGHBOURING SLIDES 
AND SO I WAS IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SLIDES WHICH WERE AFFECTING THE THE UTTERANCE I WAS RE SCORING UM THE PERFORMANCE WAS IMPROVING SLI S UH SLIGHTLY 
VERY VERY LITTLE 
BUT UH 
YEAH 
UH THE THE FIRST THING WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EX THE EXPERIMENT TO USE THE UH IF IT'S DEPENDENT OR INDEPENDENT 
HOW WE DID IT 
UH SO WE SAID THE PERSON UH CHI SQUARE UH TEST NO 
OH OKAY 
IT WAS IT TO USE OF UH CERTAIN WORDS HAVE A TENDENCY TO APPEAR DURING UH UH THEY IF THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO APPEAR DURING CERTAIN SLIDES 
WE 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT WAS NO 
AND SO SO WHEN EXTENDING THE THOSE EXPERIMENTS TO THE OTHER MEETINGS UH WHEN WHILE I WAS OBSERVING AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE FIRST MEETING I WAS USING 
UH SO I WAS R OBSERVING AN IMPROVEMENT AS I WAS INCREASING UM LIKE THE UM THE CONTEXT 
YEAH 
OH 
IN THE ON THE RECOGNITION YEAH 
SO THERE WAS UH THE IMPROVEMENT WAS ALSO INCREASING AS I WAS INCREASING THE CONTEXT 
WHEEL ON THE OTHER MEETINGS IT'S UM IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY FLUCTUATING AND UH I IT TO UH IT LOOKS MORE LIKE UM UH PS OH WELL 
WHAT'S THE WORD FOR THAT 
STATISTICAL UM UM FLUCTUATION 
SO UH 
MM-HMM 
HUH 
MM-HMM 
EXACTLY 
SO THAT'S WHY UM UH IF WE LOOK ON THE RELATIONSHIP THAT UH EXISTS BETWEEN THE SPEECH AND THE SLIDES UH THE TASK OF IMPROVING THE RECOGNITION 
UH THE OVERALL UM SP UH SPEECH RECOGNITION USING THE SLIDES UH SEEMS TO BE UH UH NOT VERY UH UM GOOD 
I MEAN UM WE CANNOT EXPECT MUCH FROM FROM IT 
MM WELL FOR NOW THE UH MOST EFFORT WAS UH IN UH UM SHOWING WHY I IT'S I IT'S IT WILL NOT WORK 
ESPECIALLY THOSE EXPERIMENTS AND THIS UH STATISTICAL TESTS 
BUT UH WE WE WERE THINKING FOR EXAMPLE OF A TASK LIKE UM TRYING TO UH SO IF UH WHERE A SPEAKER IS TALKING I MEAN IF THE SPEECH IS ACTUALLY CORRELATED WITH THE SLIDES UH WHERE THE SLIDES UH WHICH HAPPEN DURING THE NOT CORRELATED 
BUT IF THE 
UH WELL IF THE UM 
OF THE SPEAKER IS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE SLIDES OR NOT 
INDICATOR 
YEAH OR FOR EXAMPLE UH WHAT HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE OF THE MEETINGS IS THAT P PEOPLE WERE UM SUMMARIZING THE THE RESULTS OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
YOU KNOW 
SO ON THE BEGINNING IS THE MEETING STARTED WITH THE SUMMARY OF WHAT HAPPENED UH PREVIOUS TIME AND THIS WAS NOT RELATED TO WHAT WAS IN THE SLIDES 
LINK UH 
BUT THIS IS ONE YEAH 
HUH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IT WAS RECYCLING UH KIND OF 
TASK 
HUH 
HUH 
EVEN SUMMARIZATION 
OR 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
OH NO 
NO 
BUT FOR THE OTHER THING YOU KNOW UH UH THE ALTERNATIVE MEASURES 
OR MAYBE WE SHOULD FINISH WITH THIS FIRST 
UH I MEAN UH 
YEAH THIS UH THIS WOULD BE A F UH ANOTHER SUBJECT I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS 
SO BUT UH W BUT UH UH BASICALLY JU JUST YOU KNOW IF WE FINISH UH DISCUSSING THIS FIRST 
MM-HMM 
THIS IS NOT CLEARLY DEFINED YET 
BUT UH UM SOMETHING UM USING THIS RELATIONSHIP UH BETWEEN THE SLIDES UH AND THERE EVEN OTHER TEK TEXTUAL SUPPORT AND THE UH AND THE SPEECH 
HUH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SURE 
WELL THIS IS UM THE 
QUESTION I'M WORKING ON 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
YEAH THAT THAT COULD BE INTERESTING TO TRY TO MERGE THOSE TWO UH THINGS 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH AND I M UH 
ARE THEY ARE INTERESTED IN THAT ARE NO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM YEP 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT WHAT IS MISSING 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
NO 
UM MEETING 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
IT'S A FIRST STEP 
HMM 
HMM 
AND WE COULD UH DO AUTOMATICAL UH SPEAKER RATING IF THERE ARE GOOD SPEAKERS ARE BAD SPEAKERS DEPENDING IF THEY JUST READ UH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MAYBE POSSIBLE SOMEDAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL UH DID TRYING TO REALLY DETERMINE THE UM THE UM UH SUBJECT OF SOMETHING FOR MY PROPOSAL I MEAN 
YEAH ARO AROUND FEBRUARY OR MARCH 
SO REALLY UM 
YEAH 
SO TO FIND SOMETHING FOR THAT 
UH ALSO WITH THE THE THINKING MAYBE TURNING THIS UH WORK INTO PUBLICATION THE IN ABOUT THE FOR SURE 
AND UH ALSO UH UH WELL THAT UH DEPENDS A LITTLE NO NO NO YOU 
BUT TRY TO FINISH WITH THE UM MEASURES AND THE CALL ROUTING 
'CAUSE I WAS TALKING WITH THAT UH ABOUT THAT TO HERVE UH SINCE I WAS UH I WILL RECYCLE THIS POSTER FOR I. M. TWO 
YOU KNOW ABOUT UH ABOUT THIS 
AND UH THAT COULD BE COOL TO TO FINISH IT 
MAYBE FUSE IT WITH UH IAN'S WORK AND UH DO A JOURNAL PAPER HE WAS SUGGESTING 
SO SO YOU'RE SO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT YOU YOU NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU UM TRIED OTHER FEATURES AND UH 
BECAUSE AND INITIALLY IT WAS A S NUANCE TRAINED ON NUANCE UH NO 
OR 
MM-HMM 
RUN RUN RUN WHAT EXACTLY 
FOR THE THE THE CALL ROUTING ITSELF OR THE RECOGNITION UH THE PHONEME RECOGNITION 
YEAH 
I HAVE ALL UH JEAN YVES'S UH SCRIPTS AND UH PROGRAMS FOR PERFORMING THE CALL UH ROUTING I THINK UH STARTING FROM THE PHONEME SEQUENCES 
YEAH I I KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THE CLUSTER 
YEAH IF IT'S JUST RUNNING A SCRIPT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S 
BUT THIS IS BASICALLY DETECTING SPEECH AND ONE NON SPEECH 
YEAH 
IT'S THIS UH PROBLEM I HEAR EVERY TIME IN THE SPEECH MEETING HOW DO WE DETECT SPEECH AND NOT SPEECH 
UH AND UH 
OR UH OKAY 
IT'S NOT JUST SPEECH AND SILENCE

AND UH WELL THEN UH AFTER SOME TWENTY FIVE MINUTES I HOPE UH WE CAN AND THIS MEETING 
SO 
UM BASICALLY THIS IS ABOUT A UH A NEW C REMOTE CONTROL 
UM 
W WHEN YOU DESIGN A NEW PRODUCT YOU IF UH YOU OF COURSE WANT TO TO BE ORIGINAL 
B UH WE WANT TO BE DISTINGUISHED MM 
PEOPLE UH WANT TO UH WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE SHELF WANT TO THINK WELL THAT'S THE PRODUCT I I NEED

LET'S CONTINUE TO UH AT THE REAL STUFF 
UM OUR PROJECT UH FINANCE UH 
THING 
UH WHEN WE ARE AND WHEN WE YOU ARE UH GOING TO DESIGN WE UH WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THE SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCT UH WILL BE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
SO WHEN 
DESIGNING A PROJECT UH I ALSO LIKE TO YOU UH MAEL KEEP IN MIND UH UH UH PEOPLE UH 
WANT TO GET THE FEELING THIS IS A TWENTY FIVE EURO PROJECT UH PR UM

IT HAS TO BE ORIGINAL IT HAS TO BE TRENDY IT HAS TO BE USER FRIENDLY 
UM MAYBE SOMEONE CAN MENTION SOME ADDITIONAL UH PREREQUISITES FOR A GOOD REMOTE CONTROL 
YES WELL I IT SHOULD HAVE THE THE THE THE EXPECTED FUNCTIONALITY UH OF A REMOTE CONTROL 
WE WERE WE WERE THINKING TELEVISION 
OH 
MM-HMM 
YES YES 
TH TH THAT'S VERY HANDY I I ALWAYS MISS OUT AND IN SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT YOU CAN GO CHANNEL UP OR DOWN INS INSTEAD OF RETYPING THE NUMBER 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF CHANNELS 
YES 
YES 
A AND I'M NANNE 
SO 
YES 
SO 
UM 
SO 
SO SO 
ARE THERE SOME OTHER VERY IMPORTANT THINGS TO TO DO WELL 
TO SPECIFY IN THIS FIRST PHASE OF OF THE PROJECT 
SO THE BROWSE FUNCTION SO YOU M MENTIONED 
YES 
YEAH 
YES 
MM WELL UH I I THINK 
UH W YOU YOU TWO SHOULD SHOULD I THINK THINK THIS OVER UH W ESPEC WHAT WHAT FUNCTIONALITY 
MM-HMM 
MM MM MM 
KEEP K KEEP IN MIND I IT'S A IT'S A TWENTY FIVE OR NOT SO UH UH THE THE VERY FANCY STUFF UH 
WE WE CAN LEAVE THAT IT I THINK 
SO TWENTY FIVE OR YOU EXPECT A QUITE WELL NORMAL BUT GOOD FUNCTIONING USER FRIENDLY REMOTE CONTROL 
YES BUT BUT BUT B BUT THE SPEC THE BUTTONS THE BUTTONS UH THAT WILL BE ON IT 
I I THINK WE CAN DISCUSS THAT IN THE ON THE NEXT MEETING 
UH I WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS WRAPPED UP AND GO TO AN END OF THIS MEETING 
SO 
SO YOU KNOW NOW THE BASIC THE BASIC THINGS 
AND 
WELL JUST JUST FOR THE NEXT MEETING UM 
WELL UH YOU WERE YES WORK ON A DESIGN 
KEEP IT GENERAL I MEAN SO WE WE WILL BE STILL FLE FLEXIBLE WITH MAYBE ADDING SOME FUNCTIONS 
SO 
UM 
YOU WILL BE WORKING ON ONE 
TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN SO 
AND UH YOU AND YOU AND UH UH UH WELL THINK ABOUT REQUIREMENTS UH 
DOES IT AND INTERNET OR OR DO DO WE STAY TOO 
BASIC BASIC TELEVISION UH INTERFACE 
SO UH 
I THINK WE SHOULD NOW ALL GO WORK UH UH AT THIS AND UH YOU WILL BE INFORMED VIA EMAIL AND OTHER KIND OF COMMUNICATION 
SO NEXT MEETING WILL BE IN UH IN THIRTY MINUTES UH 
K KEEP IT IN MIND 
MM-HMM 
WHAT'S THE AGENDA FOR THIS MEETING 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION YEAH 
NO I DON'T 
I WASN'T 
NO 
I C I CAN TALK ABOUT IT BUT I HAVE NO SLIDES OR ANYTHING 
MM-HMM 
WELL I'VE JUST BEEN UM PRESENTED WITH SOME RESEARCH WE'VE DONE IN A SMALL FOCUS GROUP IS A HUNDRED PEOPLE 
JUST ASKED THEM ABOUT THEIR REMOTE CONTROL USAGE HABITS AND WHAT THEY WANT IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
UM 
IT'S PROBABLY CAN'T EMAIL THIS TO YOU I'VE JUST GOT A WEB PAGE WITH SOME DATA ON IT 
UM BASICALLY IT'S SAYING THAT 
USERS GENERALLY DISLIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM SEVENTY FIVE U SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY 
UM 
EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY 
UM 
CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER 
UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS SAID THEY ZAP A LOT SO THEY USE THEIR REMOTE CONTROL QUITE FREQUENTLY WHILE THEY'RE WATCHING TELEVISION 
OH 
FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS SAY THAT THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS 
SO THEY'VE GOT A REMOTE CONTROL WITH A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY BUT REALLY MOST OF THE TIME THEY ONLY USE A SMALL PART OF THAT 
UM 
I HAVE IN A WEB PAGE YES 
YEP 
YEP SURE 
MM-HMM 
SO BASICALLY UM THERE'S A BREAKDOWN OF HOW MUCH THEY USE THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS IN A REM REMOTE CONTROL 
UM POWER AND VOLUME SELECTION ARE ONLY USED A FEW TIMES WITHIN THIS UH PER HOUR 
UM CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES UM AND THEN THERE'S THINGS LIKE CHANNEL SETTINGS AUDIO SETTINGS WHICH ARE ONLY USED VERY INFREQUENTLY 
UM 
TELETEXT IS USED UM FOURTEEN TIMES IN THE HERE IS IT IS USED BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED 
UM 
AN INTERESTING THING THAT THIS REPORT HAS BROUGHT UP SO THAT UM FIFTY FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS REPORT THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL GETS LOST A LOT OF THE TIME IN THE ROOM 
SO SOME WAY OF SOME WAY OF LOCATING THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO A LOT OF USERS 
UM 
THIRTY FOUR PERCENT SAID IT TAKES TOO LONG TO LEARN TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL THEY WANT SOMETHING THAT'S EASIER TO USE STRAIGHT AWAY MORE INTUITIVE PERHAPS 
UM 
THIRTY FOUR PERCENT SAID TO TAKE TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN TO USE A NEW ONE 
YEP 
UM 
AND THIRTY TWENTY SIX PERCENT SAID REMOTE CONTROLS ARE BAD FOR R. S. I. 
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'D GO ABOUT COMBATING THAT 
FOR R. S. I. 
RESPET REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
SO 
BUT 
MM 
YEAH 
THAT'S WHAT THE REPORT SAYS YEAH 
UM AND THEN IT'S GOT A DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN ON 
UH I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY IF I EMAIL TO TO YOU NOW 
OH NO YEAH 
YEAH 
UM S HANG ON 
WELL 
UH I NEED TO MUCK AROUND WITH THIS 
IT'S PROBABLY EASIER IF YOU PUT IT IN YEARS AND THEN I'LL JUST EMAIL TO TO YOU 
IT'S JUST A WEB LINK 
ONE THING IT GOES ON TO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS INTERESTING IS THE HANG ON A MINUTE 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
UM ONE THING IS INTERESTING IS TALKING ABOUT 
UM SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
AND WHO WOULD PAY MORE FOR THAT AND WHETHER PEOPLE WOULD FIND IT USEFUL 
YES I'LL JUST GET THIS UP 
WELL POTENTIALLY YEAH UM 
I THINK EVEN FOR INTERESTI YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD NOT WORK AS WELL 
YOU WANNA HAVE BOTH OPTIONS 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
UM 
WELL 
THIS IS NOW TALKING ABOUT UM WHO WOULD PAY FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL WHO WOULD PAY MORE FOR IT UM 
NINETY PERCENT OF THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD MARKET SAID THAT THEY WOULD PAY MORE 
IT GOES DOWN FROM THERE SEVENTY SIX PERCENT FOR TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE 
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT FOR THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE UM TWENTY TWO PERCENT FOR FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE AND THEN EIGHT PERCENT FOR FIFTY FIVE TO SIXTY FIVE 
YEAH 
BUT WE SH YEAH IT REALLY DEPENDS WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE TARGETING THIS PRODUCT UM WHICH WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT LATER I THINK 
DID YOU GET THE EMAIL 
YEP THAT ONE 
JUST FOLLOW THAT LINK 
IT'LL BE IN A DIFFERENT WINDOW YEP 
THAT'S LEFT THAT ONE 
YEP 
MM 
SO THAT'S THE FIGURE THAT I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THREE WITH THE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS 
ANOTHER THING IT'S TALKING ABOUT THERE IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN BUT THERE'S NO FIGURES APPARENTLY ON THAT 
SORRY 
OH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
WELL 
YOU DRAW IT A LONG TIME AGO 
NINETY ONE 
OH 
THAT'S HANDY 
SO IF THE B T. V. ON THE NEXT APARTMENT'S REALLY LOUD YOU CAN JUST TURN IT OFF 
YEAH 
I LIKE THAT IDEA 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
HOW WOULD THAT WORK 
SO YOU'VE GOT SAY MAYBE A V. C. R. AND A T. V. WHICH ARE SEPARATE 
SO YOU IN MY ONE AT HOME I'VE GOT A V. C. R. REMOTE WHICH THEN CHANGES THE CHANNEL ON THE V. C. R. AND DOESN'T DO ANYTHING IN THE T. V. 
SO SO IT GONNA BE LIKE A SWITCH ON THE REMOTE THAT SAYS IT IS THE T. V. OR IS THE V. C. R. 
OUR IDEAS TO KNOW WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO USE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH 
MM 
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE HERE 
THAT'S YEAH 
MM 
MM 
BECAUSE YOU 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
YEP 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM 
MM 
SO D. V. D. S AND V. C. R. S 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
BUT I THINK TAKING THE IDEA OF GETTING INSPIRATION FROM MOBILE PHONES IS INTERESTING ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GOING AFTER A YOUNGER MARKET 
THAT'S THE THE THE MM THE NEW AND THE FUNKY THINGS THAT'S YEAH 
THERE'S LOT THERE'S LOTS OF PRETTY MOBILE PHONES NOT TOO MANY PRETTY REMOTE CONTROLS 
THAT'S 
MM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
HOW MUCH LONGER HAVE WE GOT FOR THE MEETING BY THE WAY 
'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT DEMOGRAPHIC AT ALL AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
WHICH I THINK IS QUITE TRICKY 
UM BASICALLY WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO BUY A REMOTE CONTROL WOULDN'T THEY ALREADY HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH THEIR TELEVISION WHEN THEY BUY ONE 
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE MORE FUNCTIONALITY 'CAUSE IT'S ONLY A LOW MARKET IT'S A CHIP AND REMOTE CONTROL 
WE CAN'T BEAT MODERN FUNCTIONALITY WE MIGHT WE'LL BE ABLE TO ABOUT THEM IN THE THE LIKE IF IT 
THE THE DESIGN OF IT BUT THAT'S NOT A BIG SELLER 
IF THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO BUY A NEW REMOTE CONTROL JUST 'CAUSE IT LOOKS PRETTY THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY NEED IT AS WELL 
SO I'M NOT SURE HOW WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO BUY THIS THING 
MM 
YEAH 
BUT WHY ARE THEY BUYING ONE ON THE FIRST PLACE 
MM 
BUT IF PEOPLE ARE BUYING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR FUNCTIONALITY THEY'LL BUY A UNIVERSAL REMOTE 
I'VE GOT FRIENDS WHO'VE GOT SO MANY THINGS THEY NEED A UNIVERSAL REMOTE OTHERWISE THEY'RE USING FIVE DIFFERENT REMOTES FOR THEIR ALL THREE THINGS 
NO THAT CASE THEY WOULDN'T BUY OUR PRODUCT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED IN TERMS OF FUNCTIONALITY 
WELL WE CAN'T WITH THE PRICE RANGE 
WE WE'RE NOT BUILDING A UNIVERSAL REMOTE WE'RE NOT BUILDING A HIGH END PRODUCT 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
BUT YEAH 
IF WE'RE GETTING INTO UNIVERSAL REMOTE TERRITORY WE'RE GETTING TO L. C. D. SCREENS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH WOULD DRIVE THE COST UP A LOT 
FOR UNIVERSAL REMOTES 
IF YOU MM 
AND QUITE COMPLICATED IT IS YES 
MM-HMM 
NOT AS FLEXIBLE MAYBE YEAH BUT SO YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BUT IF WE'RE GOING FOR THE SAY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE AGE GROUP THEN NOT MANY OF THEM WOULD ACTUALLY OWN T. V. S TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL IN 
OKAY 
SO THEY'RE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
I DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT THE THE PRICE RANGE FOR REMOTE CONTROLS SO 
ARE WE GONNA BE AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE PRICE RANGE OR ARE WE KIND OF MIDDLE TO BOTTOM 
I DON'T KNOW 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO I GUESS WHAT I'D LIKE FROM A UNIVERSAL REMOTE SO MAYBE CHOOSING BETWEEN THREE DEVICES 
BEING ABLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN THEM THERE MAY BE STEREO V. C. R. AND T. V. 
AND JUST BE ABLE TO USE USE THEM ALL FROM THE SAME REMOTE BUT NOT AT THE SAME TIME 
MM 
MM-HMM YEP 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
PERFECT 
SO YOU YOU ARE THE SECRETARY ALSO 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
PERFECTLY YEAH YEAH OF COURSE UH-HUH 
YOU MEAN THE SOCIAL TARGET GROUP WHO WE WANTS TO TARGET 
UH THE CUSTOMERS OKAY 
IT'S IT'S EASY TO LEARN OR HOW DO YOU SAY IT'S 
OKAY TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN 
OKAY 
NOT ENOUGH 
MAYBE YOU YOU YOU CANNOT PUT THIS WEBPAGE ONLINE ON THE 
UH IT'S IT OKAY IT'S A WEBPAGE ON THE C. IT'S A FILE OKAY 
O OTHERWISE Y YEAH 
YOU CAN CONNECT THIS ONE 
SO THESE ARE IMPORTANT NUMBERS THAT MATTHEW AND I NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FOR OUR FUNCTIONAL UM 
YEAH 
YEAH THESE NUMBERS HAVE HAVE TO BE HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT 
FOR THE UH BOTH YEAH USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 
BECAUSE IF THERE ARE MANY NUMBERS AND WE NEED TO SELECT IT TO CONSTRAINT UH OUR DESIGN BASED ON WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT 
SPEECH RECOGNITION ON 
OH OKAY 
SO THAT WE DON'T DO WE NOT NEED ANY BUTTON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL IT WOULD BE ALL BASED ON SPEECH 
OKAY 
INTERESTING IDEA 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE STATE OF THE ART OF SPEECH RECOGNITION SO MAYBE YOU KNOW 
BUT IT'S QUITE NOISY IF THERE IS THE T. V. UH SHOUTING 
OKAY 
SO YOU HAD TO TO TO SUMMARISE MAYBE THE 
MM 
MM-HMM 
I TH YOU S YEAH YEAH 
OKAY PERFECT 
MM 'KAY 
YEAH 
MM I OKAY I STAY 
I CAN MOVE AS FAR AS 
MAYBE I TAKE YOUR CHAIR 
I OKAY 
SO I THINK SO EVERYBODY KNOWS UH I'M THE UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
AND UH IN THIS PRESENTATION UH THIS GROUP PRESENTATION UM IS GONNA FOCUS ON THE WORKING DESIGN OF THE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM I'D LIKE FIRST TO GIVE A QUICK A VERY SIMPLE INTRODUCTION HOW DOES IT WORK 
SO THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A VERY UH TECHNICAL BACKGROUND UH WHAT IS IT BECAUSE I THINK IN THE PRODUCT IT IS IMPORTANT 
SO BASICALLY UM THE BASIC FUNCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL IS TO SEND UH MESSAGES TO ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT IS FIXED 
AND AS AN ENERGY SOURCE FEEDS AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT THE CHIP THAT CAN COMPOSE MESSAGES 
USUALLY UH THROUGH A UM INFRARED BIT AND UH THE USER INTERFACE CONTROLS THE CHIP AND ACCORDINGLY THE THE MESSAGES ALRIGHT 
SO MY METHOD FOR ME DESIGNING THE YEAH THE WORK DESIGN UH YEAH FIRST THE THE MAIN POINT IS THAT I WOULD WISH TO TO MAKE A REALLY FUNCTIONAL PRODUCT 
I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE VERY FUNCTIONAL UM CAPABILITIES RATHER THAN FANCY STUFF THAT IN FACT IS NOT USED AND DOESN'T WORK 
SO FOR THAT YEAH SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE USER REQUIREMENTS FROM THE MARKETING UH EXPERT UH ANNA AND UM 
W IT IT WE SHOULD AGREE ON WHAT ARE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS UH FOR THIS REMOTE CONTROL AND I SHOW YOU THE THE WORKING DESIGN 
SO UM BASICALLY UH HERE IS A REALLY LARGE VIEW OF WHAT WE WANT 
UH WE WANT ONE ON OFF BUTTON IT CAN BE UH IT'S SIMPLE BUT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT 
AND ALSO UH THE TO BOTH CHANNELS AS WELL AS OTHER BUTTONS THAT COME AFTER RIGHT 
SO THE COMPONENTS I QUICKLY DRAW HERE 
SO THAT IN THIS PART YOU HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL THE THE SENDER AND IN THE OTHER PART THE RECEIVER SO THAT'S MY METHOD IS UM WILL BE TOO WELL MY UM WOULD BE TO UH DESIGN THE END CHOOSE THE CHIPS AND THE INFRARED UM COMPONENTS TO BUILD THE REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT 
SO OF COURSE WE NEED ENERGY SOURCES AND UH UH THE RECEIVER A A RECEIVER 
THIS IS VERY QUICK UH DESIGN UH YOU STOP ME OR INTERRUPT ME OF UH YOU DON'T AGREE ON IT IN THAT 
AND UM SO WHAT I HAVE FOUND AND AFTER A LOT OF WORK ACTUALLY I I DRAW THIS I DRAW FOR YOU THIS UH SCHEMA THAT CAN BE MAYBE TOO TECHNICAL FOR YOU ABOUT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR UM YOU KNOW 
AND UH THAT'S IT SO I WON'T GO INTO DETAILS ABOUT THAT BUT UH THESE ARE MY PREFERENCES TO USE UH THAT KIND OF COMPONENTS 
SO THE THE MAIN COMPONENTS YOU SEE HERE ARE THE CHEAPEST I HAVE FOUND AND 
YEAH THE YOU HAVE ALWAYS A COMPROMISE WITH UH RELIABILITY AND UH I IF IT'S EXPENSIVE 
BUT UH THIS ONE WAS NOT THIS ONE ALSO REALLY UH RELIABLE UM SO 
YEAH THAT'S IT FOR THE WORKING DESIGN 
UH I HOPE YOU GET CLEARER VIEW ON UH WHAT WHAT A REMOTE CONTROL IS UH IN TERMS OF UH TECHNICAL COMPONENTS BUT MAYBE YEAH 
NO NO NO NO WE WE WILL UH THIS IS A PREFERENCE BUT WE CAN ALWAYS CHANGE UH 
YEAH 
OF COURSE YEAH 
YEAH 
WE WILL SEE UH INFRARED PROTOCOL UH USING YEAH INFRARED AND UH 
AND OF COURSE WE NEED TO ADAPT TO THAT PROTOCOL THAT ALREADY EXISTS AND BUT W WHAT WE CAN DO IS UH UH ADAPTING THE THE CHIPS INSIDE UH AT THE BEST UH CHIPS AND UH INFRARED BUBBLES 
UM 
OKAY 
THE FREQUENCIES 
YEAH YEAH 
OF COURSE YEAH IN THE CHIP YOU HAVE TO YEAH 
THAT CAN CONTROL O OTHER THINGS 
YEAH 
OF COURSE YEAH WE SHOULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT ON THE UH 
YES 
OKAY 
YEP 
THESE ARE KIND OF NEXT GENERATION FUNCTIONALITIES 
MM 'KAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OR EVEN YOU DON'T NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT IT'S STREAMED UH ONLINE UH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
FOURTEEN OR FOR O OKAY 
SO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY USED TO THAT YOU KNOW PRODUCT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YES 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
YEAH WE HAVE YEAH TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS UH PR UH PER R. S R. C. AND I THINK UH WITH THIS NOW YOU KNOW THAT CHIPS ARE VERY UH CHIPS AND UH WE CAN INCLUDE IT IN OUR CONTROL SOME NEW NEW FEATURES 
YEAH 
AND UM BUT YEAH THAT'S 
YOU 
I DON'T THINK L. C. D. IS NOT NECESSARY WELL THE FOR LONG TERM 
YEAH 
UNIVERSAL 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT WE ARE GONNA BE WE ARE GONNA SELL UH FOUR ARO AROUND FOUR MILLION SO WHEN WE SPOKE ABOUT THESE NUMBERS UH THE PRICE OF A CHIP IS UH PRICE OF A CHIP IS VERY CHEAP 
SO I'M OKAY FOR DESIGNING UM A ONE UH LESS YEAH A A KIND OF UNIVERSAL UH R. C. YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S NEEDED YEAH 
AND IF WE WANT TO GET THE MARKET WE REALLY NEED THAT 
YES 
EXACTLY 
SO THAT OKAY FOR YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES 
OH THAT'S THAT'S FINE THEN 
YEAH 
OKAY PERFECT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
NEXT 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE 
OKAY 
YOU CAN DISCONNECT IT THERE NO 
THEN YOU CAN CONNECT THIS ONE OR THIS ONE YEAH 
ALL TO YOUR COMPUTER 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
HMM 
YEAH 
WELL IT WOULD BE OF 
NO YOU CAN'T 
OH 
WELL IT DEPENDS YOU KNOW LIKE 
THERE IS UH IT'S A VERY SMALL VOCABULARY THAT YOU WANT TO DO THE OPERATIONS LIKE YOU WANT TO SAY ON OFF 
ONE TWO 
TWENTY THREE YEAH 
IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE LI IT'S NOT GOING TO BE S S SAY ABOUT 
U USUALLY IT'S GOING TO BE MORE OF AN ISOLATED 
CASE BUT IT'S BUT I DON'T KNOW WITH TWENTY F 
OKAY IT'S UH DECLINE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
NOW YOU CAN MOVE I THINK YEAH 
IT'S A CHANNEL SELECTION A MODEL THIS AND THIS FUNCTION GO TO THE 
YEAH 
BUT IS IT UH CAN YOU JUST BUY IT IN THE MARKET AND F PLUG IT IN OR YOU WANT TO ME 
WELL IT TO DO IT'S JUST YOU HAD TO CHANGE THE FREQUENCIES 
YEAH 
BUT YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL PEOPLE ARE SOMETIME BECOMING PROBLEM 
LIKE A GUY HAS RECENTLY DESIGNED A REMOTE UH UH UH WHICH COULD SWITCH OFF ANY OTHER T. V. S SO BASICALLY THROUGH ALL THE THINGS 
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK OF YEAH 
YEAH SO YOU CAN JUST GO ON THE START AND THEN SWITCH OFF EVERYONE'S T. V. AND YOU CAN JUST WALK AWAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NEAR THE T. V. AT ALL 
YEAH SO 
OKAY 
SO I CAN TAKE I THINK MINE NOW THERE 
OKAY SO VOILA 
HMM I CAN TAKE MEAN IT'S OKAY VOILA MM SO MM 
OKAY 
IT'S IN THE DESKTOP 
TECHNICAL FUNCTION 
OKAY 
LIKE SO 
WELL 
SO UM I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION SO WHA WHAT ACTUALLY IT'S ABOUT WHAT IS THE USER GOING TO DO 
I THINK MY LAST PRESENTED WHAT IS GOING INSIDE SO WHAT'S THE USER IS GOING TO SEE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND HOW UH IS GOING TO USE IT 
AS WELL THE APPROACH IS THAT UH 
BASICALLY THE IDEA IS TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE T. V. SET AS MAEL HAS POINTED 
AND IT WILL BE DECODED BY THE T. V. AND USUALLY W IT IS EASIER TO HAVE UH KEYS ARE BUTTONS WITH WHICH PEOPLE CAN UH PRESS AND THEN UM CHANGING A BUTTON WILL BASICALLY UH CHANGE THE MESSAGE WHICH IS BEING SENT TO THE T. V. AND UH UM A AND BASICALLY IT SENDS AN INTERNAL SIGNAL AND DECODED BY THE RECEIVER 
SO UP SO UM ANNA HAS SAID THAT THIS KI PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THINGS WHICH ARE YOU DON'T NEED TO K PRESS THE KEYS 
PEOPLE ARE CAN HAVE A SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT THIS IS UH AS A QUESTION WHICH WILL WE HAVE TO SEE LATER 
BUT IN THE PRESENT SCENARIO IS THAT YOU HAVE CERTAIN KEYS AND YOU PRESS IT LIKE YOUR MOBILE PHONE AND IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE T. V. 
AND UM SO GENERALLY MM I DON'T HAVE SOME FIGURES SORRY ABOUT UM SO THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF UH REMOTE IF YOU POPULARLY IN THE HOUSEHOLD 
ACTUALLY SO YOU HAVE A STANDARD T. V. REMOTE WHERE YOU HAVE JUST A ON OFF BUTTON AND PLAY 
UH VOLUME CHANGE AND UH KEYS FOR THE NUMBER AND MORE THAN ONE DIGIT OPTION 
AND IF YOU USE FOR EXAMPLE RIGH RIGHT NOW UH UH EVEN THE ONE UH ONE MORE THAN ONE DIGIT OPTION IS FOR TWO DIGIT CHANNEL WHICH IS LIKE NINETY NINE 
BUT TOMORROW YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE FIFTY CHANNELS YOU KNOW TO BROWSE OR TWO HUNDRED CHANNELS TO BROWSE WHO KNOWS BUT UH UH 
THEN THERE IS UH THIS IS THE STANDARD ONE WITH WITHOUT ANY FANCY THING YOU KNOW LIKE I IT DOESN'T HAVE TELETEXT OPTION 
IT CAN WITHOUT ANY IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING UM WHICH WHICH YOU CAN VOUCH 
AND THEN YOU HAVE UH WHAT'S THE V VIDEO REMOTE FILE WHICH IS LIKE USUALLY IT HAS ALMOST ALL THE KEYS OVER THERE AND 
BUT IT THEN IT HAS OTHER OPTIONS LIKE STOP UH AND THEN YOU PLAY THE MOVIE OR UH OR FO FAST FORWARD THE MOVIE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO I IT HAS THIS IS THESE ARE THE STANDARD UH COMMONLY FOUND REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE UH MARKET 
AND THEN WHI WHICH IS GENERALLY USED BY THE PEOPLE 
AND THEN WELL PERSONAL PREFERENCES I WOULD UH BASICALLY THINK OF HAVING A KIND OF UM FOR THE NEXT GENERATION THING WHERE THE WE COULD HAVE BOTH THE UH THE OF A T. V. AND THE REMOTE VIDEO REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE UH SOME OF THE KEYS IN THE VIDEO'S REMOTE CONTROL AND THE T. V. THEY COULD BE INTEGRATED TOGETHER SO THAT UH WE COULD UM UM FOR THE LOOK ON THE F COMING FUTURE UM THAT TYPE OF UH APPLICATIONS WITH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM ACTUALLY UM YOU COULD YOU COULD THINK OF UM HAVING AS A YOU YOU CAN HAVE A KEY WHICH COULD TELL YOU IT COULD GO TO THE VIDEO THING ABOUT UM UH Y Y Y YOU STILL CAN'T UM IN THAT CASE WHEN IT YOU SEE THAT THE FUNCTION SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE UP THE V. C. R. OPTION AND YOU COULD PLAY IT OR YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT HAVING LIKE UM 
I IN A FEW DAYS YOU WILL BE UH IN IN FEW YE COMING YEARS YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE A SEPARATE UH SITTING SETUP BOX AND UH YOU HAVE UH UM SOMETHING LIKE UH UH YOU DO YOU DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO WATCH SOME PROGRAMME AND ACTUALLY IT DOWNLOADING ALL THE TIME FOR YOU AND UH YOU CAN JUST YOU KNOW UH WHEN YOU COME BACK YOU COULD JUST SWITCH ON THAT THING AND UH WATCH A PROGRAM 
NO THAT CASE YOU WANT TO BROWSE FASTER BROWSE SLOW YOU WANT TO HAVE THIS KIND OF FUNCTIONALITIES 
IT'S THE NEXT GENERATION THING ABOUT IT IS GOING TO COME IN COUPLE OF YEARS 
IT'S GO 
YEAH IT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO IT'S GOING TO RECORD YOUR THINGS AND YOU AND YOU YOU AND BASICALLY THE FUNCTIONALITIES WHAT YOU NEED ON BOTH UH UH VIDEO AS WELL AS IN THE STANDARD T. V. THING 
NO NO WE ARE NOT MAKING A UNIVERSAL REMOTE WE ARE JUST LOOKING AT UH GIVING A SCENARIO 
I HAVE A T. V. AND TOMORROW I AM GOING TO HAVE SET UP BOX WHICH IS GOING TO SIT THERE AND UH IT'S GOING TO DO THAT JOB FOR ME 
YEAH 
SO 
OKAY SO THAT P ENDS MY PRESENTATION 
WELL 
SO WE CAN ALWAYS DISCUSS ABOUT IT FOR EXAMPLE UH THE PRESENTLY THE VIDEO MARKET ACTUALLY UH THIS DEMAND VIDEO OVER DEMAND OR WHAT WE CALL IT IS 
IT'S PRESENTLY BOOMING UP ACTUALLY IS IT I LIKE PEOPLE ARE PROVIDING LIKE UH THINGS LIKE UH UH MOVIES 
YOU CAN SELECT ACTUALLY SO YOU WANT TO WATCH A MOVIE AND UH YOUR P YOUR PROVIDER GIVES A LIST OF MOVIES AND THEN YOU SELECT THOSE LIST 
AND IT BASICALLY YOU GO OFF IT DOWNLOADS THE MOVIE IT GIVES FOR YOU AND THEN WHEN YOU COME YOU WANT TO LOO WATCH IT IN YOUR T. V. 
AND THE THIS IS GOING TO COME 
YEAH IT CAN BE STREAMED ONLINE FOR YOU AND YOU CAN SAY WHAT TIME I WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE AND 
YEAH SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
YEAH IT'S UH WELL Y YOU CAN FOLLOW THE IDEAS HOW YOU WANT TO KEEP THE KEYS 
YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IF YOU TAKE IT YOU HAVE LIKE ZERO ONE TWO 
THERE LIKE A KEYS SEPARATELY BUT SUPPOSE IF YOU TAKE THE THE PRESENT TREND OF MOBILE PHONES THERE ARE LIKE BIG THICK KEYS YOU PRESS ON THE TOP 
IT TAKES ONE NUMBER YOU PRESS ON THE BOTTOM IT TAKES ANOTHER NUMBER 
AND UH BASICALLY UH UH IS THE SPACE COVERED SO THAT YOU DON'T USE TWO SEPARATE KEYS THERE ACTUALLY IS IT IT IS LIKE UH UM I I IT IS LIKE UH 
YEAH SO 
SO FOR EXAMPLE UH 
WELL UH 
OKAY IT WORKS 
FINE 
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE UH PRESENTLY UH KEYS LIKE ONE TWO 
THERE LIKE THIS ACTUALLY AND UH UH FOUR FIVE SIX LIKE THAT AND UH YOU CAN HAVE KEYS LIKE THIS ONE FROM LIKE 
UH KEYS LIKE THAT 
FORTY MINUTES 
YEAH SO Y Y YOU CAN HAVE UH KEYS LIKE UH WHICH ARE WHICH ARE LIKE SO 
IT SORRY SO WE BASICALLY DON'T CHANGE THE UH ORIGINAL ORDER OF THEM BUT THEN THE KEYS ARE MORE SPACIOUS 
THEY DON'T LIKE UH IS THERE THERE IS A VERY SLIGH THING IS IF YOU PRESS ON THE TOP IT TAKES THE ONE 
IT TAKES THE OTHER UH FOUR SORRY FOR HER UH FIVE AND SIX 
SO THE KEYS CAN BE IT LOOKS YOU KNOW NOT VERY MUCH CLUTTERED BUT IT LOOKS NICE FOR YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY KEYS BUT YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS T IF YOU PRESS ON THE IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL 
WELL I IT'S FINE WITH UM LIKE THE PRICE AS LONG AS IT IS UH NOT TOO EXPENSIVE 
UH NEED TO DO UH 
OUR PROVIN 
MM 
OH YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE NEEDED BASICALLY 
OH THAT'S NEEDED RIGHT NOW 
AND UH BASICALLY YOU CAN LOOK AT THE STANDARDS OF THREE 
CAT 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU CAN ALSO BROWSE THROUGH ALL THE STANDARDS YOU KNOW WHERE ARE THE LIMIT OF STANDARDS FOR ALL OF THEM AND YOU CAN JUST BROWSE THROUGH THEM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
VOILA 
HMM 
SO 
WELL 
UH I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW 
WE CAN WE'LL WE'LL GO AND WE'LL I'M SURE WE'LL UP SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE 
YEAH SO WE MEET IN WELL WHAT ARE ARE 
OKAY 
COOL 
SO SO YOU LATER 
SO I SEE ALL EVERYBODY'S HERE 'KAY 
AND WE CAN START MEETING 
TH I WILL UH 
PRESENT HERE AGENDA WITH WITH WITH WITH SLIDES 
IT YOU 
UM 
SO YOU CAN SEE HERE 
SO FIRST UH JUST TO MENTION I WILL 
TAKE NOTES UH OF THIS MEETING AND UH I WILL TRY TO WORK THEM OUT AND GIVE THEM TO YOU 
I'VE ALSO MADE NOTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING AND UM I WAS ABOUT TO SEND THEM YOU BUT THEN UH I HAD TO GO TO THIS UH MEETING SO YOU WILL GET THEM TO UH 
UM 
YES 
INDEED 
UM 
THEN I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE UH WORKED OUT SOME SOME UH SOME SOME PRESENTATIONS ABOUT UH BUT WELL YOU THE THE TASK GIVEN TO YOU IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
UM 
WE WE WILL UH IN A MINUTE WE WILL UH START WITH THEM 
UM WE WILL SEE IN WHICH ORDER WE WILL HANDLE THEM OF 
UM THEN I WILL UH BRING IN SOME SOME SOME NEW REQUIREMENTS I I GOT UH FROM THE UH ACCOUNT MANAGER 
I TRY TO WORK THEM TO THEY WERE QUITE ABSTRACT AND WE CAN HAVE MAYBE HAVE COM SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT IT 
UH UM BUT THE FUNCTIONS AND WELL IN THIS MEETING WE SHOULD REALLY TRY TO REACH A DECISION ABOUT THE TARGET GROUP 
AND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE 
YES I MEAN WELL YES W WHO ARE WE GOING TO UH IT WILL TO SELL THIS THE CUSTOMERS INDEED YES 
THINK THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT MATTER 
OH 
SO AND THEN UH WE WILL CLOSE THIS MEETING UH AND AFTER THIS MEETING WE'LL UH WE'LL HAVE A LUNCH 
GOOD 
UM 
MAYBE UM 
WHY UH ANNA CAN YOU C DO YOU HAVE A PRESENTATIONS 
YOU DON'T HAVE PRESENTATION 
UH YOU WANT A TABLE TO TO UH 
YES YES MAYB MAYBE YOU CAN UH CAN JUST TALK ABOUT IT OR MAYBE YOU CAN USE THE WHITEBOARD IF NECESSARY UM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
DO YOU DO YOU HAVE THIS UH INFORMATION ON THE WEB PAGE YOU SAID 
YES MAYB MAYBE YOU CAN CAN SEND AN EMAIL TO ME LATER UH 
UH ABOUT THIS 
MM 
MM 
YES YES I HAVE THAT IT 
MM 
MM 
THEY THINK THAT OR DO THEIR DOCTOR THE DOCTOR SAYS 
BUT IT'S IT'S THE OPINION OF THE UH OF THE USERS HUH 
SO MM 
YOU CAN MAYBE JUST JUST 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
DO DO YOU HAVE NUMBERS O O ON THAT 
WELL IT WOULD IT WOULD BE A SOLUTION FOR UH WHEN YOUR 
REMOTE CONTROL IS LOST I MEAN WHEN IT HAS SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN 
UH I THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IT IS MY WELL IT'S WE SHOULD BE AN ORANGE 
OR MAYBE IT CAN RESPOND AND PRODUCE SOUND IS EASY WHERE IT IS 
BUT TH THOSE ARE ALL QUITE FANCY FEATURES I'M NOT SURE WHETHER 
WE WILL WE CAN MAKE THIS FOR FOR TWELVE EURO FI AND FIFTY CENTS 
MM 
YES THAT THAT THAT THAT'S MM 
DO YOU HAVE SOME MORE IMPORTANT FACTS OR 
CAN WE GO TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION 
MM 
MM-HMM 
DECLINE WITH AGE MM 
MM 
YES 
WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT LATER 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
UM 
UH MAYBE UH MAEL C C CAN YOU GIVE UH UH YOUR PRESENTATION UH 
UH THIS IS 
MM-HMM Y Y YOU CAN MOVE UH 
YES 
YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE TAKE MY CHAIR 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH-HUH 
SO HUH 
OVERWHELMING 
NO 
AND AND WHY DO YOU WANT THIS KIND OF COMPONENT 
I MEAN ARE THEY CHEAP OR ARE THEY UH RELIABLE 
WHAT WERE YOUR 
MM 
YES 
IT IT 
IT'S MORE CLEAR NOW I THINK 
SO 
MM-HMM 
WHAT I W WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT UH THE THE THE SCHEMA UH BUT UH THE SENDER AND THE RECEIVER 
I MEAN CAN YOU CAN YOU GET BACK TO IT 
YEAH UH THE RECEIVER EASE OF COURSE ALREADY ON THE TELEVISION AND WE ARE NOT UH ABLE TO CHANGE IT 
SO WE WE MUST ADAPT TO THE AT THE RECEIVER 
I I SUPPOSE THERE IS A STANDARD UH WAY OF COMMUNICATING TO TELEVISIONS UH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YES 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
MM 
YEAH YES I I I 
I I FEEL I I I THINK M MAEL WILL WILL CONSIDER THIS UH THE THESE THINGS 
MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN GO TO TO YOUR PRESENTATION UH MATTHEW 
I I I ASSUME YOU WERE FINISHED HERE 
OH OKAY 
OH 
I 
OH SORRY 
I KNOW WHERE IT IS 
IT'S UH 
YES 
IT'S UH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM MM MM MM MM 
MM YES BUT I THINK IT'S I I IT'S ALREADY THERE I MEAN THE HARD DISK UH RECORDERS UH I I'VE SEEN THEM IN THE SHAPE 
W W W W WE NEED TO DECIDE ON ON ON ON ON HOW FAR WE GO TO IN THIS 
MEAN YOU CAN GO PRETTY FAR I IF I THINK WITH WITH WITH FUNCTIONS AND POSSIBLE UH FUTURE P UH PROSPECTS YES 
BUT IT'S GOOD TO KEEP IN MIND 
MM 
VERY WELL 
GOOD 
UM 
SO U UM I HAVE UH RECEIVED SOME SOME SOME SOME WELL POINTS OF OF THINKING OVER OF MY ACCOUNT MANAGER AND UH I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THEM WITH YOU 
UM 
FIRST THING IS UH TELETEXT IS A WELL KNOWN FEATURE OF TELEVISIONS BUT IT'S IT'S GETTING USED LESS AND LESS 
THAT'S THAT'S ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET OF COURSE 
SO WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT UM 
DO WE INCLUDE IT AND DO WE GIVE IT A PROMINENT UH PROMINENT UH PLACE IN IN IN THE ON WELL HUH 
IN THE REMOTE MOT CONTROL ITSELF 
UH SO UH A IN ANY CASE IT'S IT'S NOT USED WELL VERY MUCH BUT IT'S IT IS STILL USED 
UM 
FURTHER YES WE MUST THINK UH DO WE STAY UH TO TO TELEVISION ONLY 
THE TELEVISION SO WE SO WE ALL KNOW IT WITH WITH BROADCASTING SIGNALS AND YOU CAN'T GO BACK UH-HUH 
OR DO WE UH UH GO FURTHER AS MATTHEW INDICATED BY SUPPORTING UH UH RECORDING UH DEVICES 
UH INDEED INDEED 
AND AND AND THE HARD DISK RECORDERS 
UM FURTHERMORE UH 
WE WE NEED REALLY NEED TO INTEREST UH Y YOUNGER CUSTOMERS AND THEN WITH YOUNGER CUSTOMERS I MEAN PEOPLE UH BELOW THE AGE OF FORTY 
AND OUR OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS ARE MAINLY FORTY PLUS UH WHICH WILL FORTY 
SO THAT'S IT THAT'S I MEAN THERE'S A MARKET BUT UH THEY WILL GROW OLDER OLDER AND YOU'LL AL ALWAYS NEED TO HAVE THE THE FUTURE WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE 
UM THEREFORE 
YOUNGER PEOPLE LIKE TRENDY TRENDY DESIGNS SO THAT'S W WE SHOULD 
MAKE OUR OUR OUR R. C. S TRENDY AS POSSIBLE BUT 
IT SHOULD ALSO BE UH HAVE A RELIABLE IMAGE SO WHEN IT LOOKS TOO TOO SPACEY OR IT FANCY PEOPLE WILL THINK WELL DOES IT WORK AT ALL 
HMM 
UM MAYBE MAYBE YOU CAN DRAW IT IN THE ON THE BOARD UH 
HMM 
YES YES UM 
YES IT'S RECOGNISABLE 
MM MM 
AND AND THEY ARE SKILLED UH BY USING IT 
MAEL CAN YOU HAND ME OVER THIS UH 
OH THANK YOU 
MM WELL I THINK FI FIVE MIN MM-HMM 
OKAY 
'KAY I I THINK NOW THAT THE IDEA'S CLEAR 
UH WE SHOULD NOW UH TRY TO DECIDE UM IN OUR TARGET GROUP 
OF COURSE THEY HAVE ALREADY ON 
SO OUR OUR OUR REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO BE BETTER 
MM-HMM 
MM 
I WILL I THINK MANY PEOPLE SAID UH IN YOUR IN IN YOUR RESEARCH UH UH 
UH THE APPEARANCE OF THE UH R. C. IS IS IMPORTANT WHEN THEY ARE BUYING ONE BUT 
INDEED 
SO THAT WILL BE BUT 
FUNCTIONALITY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
SO YOUR YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR A MORE U UNIVERSAL HIGH PERFORMANCE 
WHAT DO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT COMPONEN 
I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S NECESSARY 
SO THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
I THINK TH THIS COULD BE THIS COULD BE A MARKET BECAUSE UH UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROLS UH TEND TO BE UH QUITE EXPENSIVE 
SO SO WE CAN TRY TO GO IN BETWEEN AND OFFER A PRODUCT WHICH IS NOT SO EXPENSIVE AND NOT SO 
COMPLICATED 
BUT BUT STILL BUT STILL PEOPLE HAVE THE IDEA THIS IS MORE FUNCTIONAL THAN A NORMAL UH UH 
R. C. BECAUSE IT HAS MORE UH IT IT IS IN SOME KIND UNIVERSAL 
MM YES BUT WE WE'RE TARGETING I THINK ONE MORE ON THE ON THE TWENTY TO FORTY GROUP 
PEOPLE YES 
WHO JUST HAVE ARE ALREADY HAVE A JOB AND HAVE THE MONEY BUT 
MAY NOT WANT TO SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY ON A IN A UNIVERSAL UNIVERSAL CONTROL 
UH WELL 
I THINK UH WHEN WE THINK IT OVER I TH I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO OFFER THE A KIND OF UNIVERSAL CONTROL FOR FOR LESS MONEY 
SO D DO YOU AGREE 
MM-HMM 
YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THE TWELVE EURO FIFTY 
OKAY 
UM SO 
THEN WE WE DECIDE ON ON ON GOING TO THIS MORE UNIVERSAL KIND OF CONTROL 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
YES 
MM MM MM MM 
SO GIVEN WE ARE GOING FOR THIS UH 
UH UNIVERSAL TYPE UH M MAYBE IT IS GOOD WHEN YOU TRY TO FIND OUT WHICH COMPONENTS YOU THEREFORE AND AND YOU YOU WILL TRY TO GET MORE SPECIFIC UH USER INTERFACE CONTENT AND UH MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK ON ON WHAT TRENDS ARE IN THIS UH IN THIS TYPE OF MARKET 
SO ANYONE UH HAS A POINT TO BRING IN OR SHALL WE NO 
OKAY 
W YES WE UH WE CAN HAVE LUNCH NOW 
SO UM 
THEN THE 
THE THE NEXT MEETING WILL UH AFTER LUNCH YOU HAVE UH WE HAVE 
UH THIRTY MINUTES OF WORK AND THEN WE HAVE THE NEXT MEETING 
BUT YOU WILL BE INFORMED VIA THE COMPUTER 
OKAY 
RIGHT FIRST TIME THIS TIME 
NO 
THERE WE GO 
IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED BUT I GET IT WRONG EVERY TIME 
FOR MATTHEW YEP 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
I HAVE A PRESENTATION I'M JUST MAKING THIS 
OKAY I'LL JUST EMAIL YOU THIS FILE MY PRESENTATION 
MM-HMM I'M JUST EMAILING IT TO YOU 
OKAY IT SHOULD'VE GONE THROUGH IT YOU 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO THIS IS JUST A PRESENTATION ON UH THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE GONNA USE TO MAKE THE PRODUCT STAND OUT FROM THE REST OF THE PRODUCTS OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT 
UM CAN I JUST PUT THIS ONE 
SO WE HAVE TO WORK OUT A WAY WHAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR PRODUCT TO MAKE IT STAND OUT AND MAKE IT IS PEOPLE WANNA BUY IT 
UM 
THIS IS TO DO THIS I WILL NOT REMOVE MY MICROPHONE 
WE BASICALLY SAID UM SOME FOCUS GROUP SURVEYS WHICH I WENT THROUGH WITH YOU LAST TIME THE MAIN RESULTS OF THAT 
AND UM SOME RESEARCH ON THE CURRENT DESIGN UM AND FASHION TRENDS THAT ARE OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT UM AND AS PART OF THIS 
THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS THAT CAME OUT WERE THINGS THAT WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED REALLY 
THE MOST IMPORTANT BY FAR WAS THE LOOK AND FEEL OF IT 
IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE OUT THERE 
IT NEEDS TO STAND OUT 
IT NEEDS TO BE NOT FUNCTIONAL LIKE THE REST OF THE THINGS OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT 
MOST PEOPLE FIND REMOTE CONTROLS BORING AT THE MOMENT WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS INTERESTING THAT LOOKS EXCITING THAT WILL STAND OUT 
PEOPLE WILL WANNA BUY IT 
UM 
THAT WAS TWICE AS I IMPORTANT IS THE NEXT TIME IN HERE WHICH IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE HAS TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE 
APART FROM JUST THE LIKE IF IT 
PEOPLE HAVE TO THEN THINK ABOUT IT AND SAY GOT SOMETHING THERE THAT I WANT 
THAT'S A REALLY COOL FEATURE AND IT HAS TO MAKE THEM WANNA BUY IT AGAIN 
THIRD ON THE LAST AND AGAIN INNOVATIVE WAS TWICE AS IMPORTANT IS THIS LIST UM ASPECT IT HAS TO BE EASY TO USE 
SO THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT AND HAVE SOME INTUITIVE IDEA OF HOW TO USE IT UM 
DRAWING ON THE FASHION TRENDS AT THE MOMENT UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES UM 
THIS IS BASICALLY TALKING ABOUT JUST THE THE FEEL OF IT IS PROBABLY NOT THE SMELL OF IT BUT THE BRIGHT COLOURS 
UM EYE CATCHING REALLY BOLD DESIGNS AND A SPONGY FEEL 
UM I HAD A TALK TO THE DESIGN PEOPLE BUT THIS ABOUT HAVING A REMOTE THAT'S TACTILE THAT FEELS DIFFERENT THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL 
THAT WOULD MAKE IT STAND OUT 
UM 
WELL M MAKE IT NOT NECESSAR SP SPONGY IS THE CURRENT THING 
SPONGY IS THE CURRENT TEXTURE BUT BASICALLY THERE ARE NO REPORTS IN REMOTES TO THE MOMENT WHICH ARE SPONGY OR TACTILE AT ALL 
SO IF WE MAKE IT LIKE MAYBE FURRY OR SOFT OR SOMETHING 
THAT'LL BE SOMETHING THAT SETS TO OPERATE RATHER THAN JUST BARE PLASTIC WHICH THEY ALL OR AT THE MOMENT 
SO SO FAR AS THE DESIGN GOES THE VERY MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT WAS THE DESIGN AT THE CUSTOMERS 
IS GOING WITH THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE IDEA WE'VE GOT THE BRIGHT COLOURS SO MAKES IT STAND OUT 
THE ORANGES AND THE THE BRIGHT YELLOWS AND THE FLORESCENT COLOURS PART OF THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES UM 
GOING BACK TO THE IDEA OF TAKING INSPIRATION FROM MOBILE PHONES 
THEY'VE ALL GET THIS A LOT OF THEM HAVE THE CHANGEABLE COVERS SO THEY CAN CHOOSE WHAT COLOUR THE OUTSIDE SO 
THAT'S ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT UM 
TEXTURED FEEL WE JUST TALKED ABOUT 
MAYBE IT'S ANOTHER WAY OF DOING THAT 
SO IF IT'S PART OF THE THE CHANGEABLE COVERS THEN MAY MAYBE THEY CAN CHOOSE A DIFFERENT TEXTURE A SPONGY ONE OR A SOFT ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO THEY CAN CHOOSE TO L AS THEY WANT TO TO MAYBE TO FIT IN WITH THEIR DECOR IN THEIR LIVING ROOM 
OR JUST WHAT THEY LIKE THEIR SPORTS TEAM OR WHATEVER 
UM AND YEAH STILL TAKING THE INSPIRATION FROM THE MOBILE PHONE DESIGN SO 
FUNCTIONALITY THE WAY THE MOBILE PHONES WORK THE WAY THE KEYPAD LOOKS 
ALSO JUST THE WAY THAT A LOT OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IS GOING INTO MOBILE PHONES AT THE MOMENT 
THEY'RE BIG SELLING ITEMS 
PEOPLE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THAT SO WE CAN LEVERAGE OFF THAT AND WE CAN START USING SOME OF OTHER IDEAS 
UM BACK TO TECHNOLOGICAL IN IN INNOVATION NOT QUITE AS IMPORTANT BUT STILL A BIG ISSUE 
UM WE TALKED ABOUT HAVING A WAY OF FINDING A REMOTE CONTROL IF IT'S BEEN LEAST UH THAT'S ONE THING WE COULD LOOK AT 
THERE ARE OTHER ASPECTS LIKE L. C. D. SCREENS AND SPEECH RECOGNITION WHICH WEREN'T 
I DON'T THINK IN MY PERSONAL OPINION GONNA BE WORTH THE EXTRA EXPENSE AND THE EXTRA EFFORT THAT WILL GO INTO THEM 
I THINK WE'RE BETTER DOING SOMETHING BASIC LIKE THIS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY WILL BE A REALLY COOL FEATURE TO PUT IN 
AND 
SO 
I HAD IN REAL SPECIFIC IDEAS FOR THIS MAYBE WE JUST THE BASIC IDEA OF HAVING YOUR CORE FUNCTIONS BIG AND AT THE TOP MAYBE 
BY THEMSELVES AND THEN YEAH AND THEN THE THE THE FINER DETAILS OF BUTTONS YOU DON'T USE AS MUCH EITHER HIDDEN AWAY OR COMPLETELY SEPARATE 
YEP AND THAT'S THE PRESENTATION 
SO DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR DOES IN THAT 
I THINK YOU 
HMM 
WELL WE'RE SELLING SO MANY UNITS OF THIS 
THIS IS GONNA BE A MASS MARKETED PRODUCT WE CAN AFFORD TO HAVE TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT DESIGNS AT LEAST 
MM MM 
MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
I LIKE THE IDEA THOUGH OF HAVING SPEECH RECOGNITION FOR LIKE THE ON THE NAME OF A CHANNEL LIKE B. B. C. 
RATHER THAN HAVING TO REMEMBER THE THE NUMBER OF IT IN THE KEYPAD 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
MM 
HMM 
MM 
YEAH I REALLY LIKE THAT IDEA 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MAYBE TEN CHANNELS YEAH AT THE MOST 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM BU 
BUT A COFFEE MACHINE THERE'S NOT TOO MANY WORDS THEY'D BE USING WITH THAT IT'S A IT'S A SMALL VOCABULARY 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
TWO THIRTY FIVE SUPPOSED TO FINISH 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
I THINK YOU CAN DO IT BOTH WAYS 
YOU CAN HAVE TO USE IT'S EASY THEY CAN PICK IT UP AND SO IT STRAIGHT AWAY WITHOUT DOING ANYTHI WITHOUT CUSTOMIZING IT 
OR IF THEY WANT TO THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF USING THESE EXTRA FEATURES 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
I LIKE THE IDEA OUT OF BEING ABLE TO USE THE REMOTE IN THE DARK 
SO EITHER HAVING THE BUTTONS AS YOU CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM OR IF THEY IF THEY LIGHT UP OR SOMETHING 
MM 
MM 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM JUST HAVE A YEAH 
JUST THE VENEER ON IT YEAH 
HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
WELL MAYBE WE NEED SPECIFIC COSTINGS THEN 
ACTUALLY DO MAYBE TWO DESIGNS AND THEN COST THEM OUT AND SO WHICH ONE IS GONNA FIT IN OUR BUDGET BETTER 
MM 
MM 
HMM 
MM YEAH SURE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
SO SO THERE ANY OF THOSE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT PARTICULARLY OR IS THIS JUST IDEAS 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM YEAH 
YOU SEE 
YEAH 
MM WELL NO I'VE HAD BEFORE 
A R R REMOTE CONTROL WE HAVE AT HOME IS NO THAT'S ACTUALLY GOT A COVER ON THE BOTTOM IS THE BOTTOM BIT IS JUST 
COVERS HALF THE KEYS MOST OF THE TIME AND THEN YOU CAN SLIDE THE COVER BACK TO GET TO THE THE MORE ADVANCED KEYS 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
UM YEAH I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE IT 
ANOTH ANOTHER LIKE B IT FLIPS UP AND THEN YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER LAYER OF BUTTONS UNDERNEATH 
MM 
BUT I'VE SEEN ALSO WITH KEYS AND BUTTONS ON THE TOP OF HERE AS WELL 
I LIKE THIS ONE 
I LIKE THE SHAPE OF THIS ONE 
CAN WE HAVE CAN WE THINK ABOUT MAYBE HAVING A A NON RECTA NON NON RECTANGULAR ONE IS WITH NOT JUST THE STRAIGHT LITTLE BOX THAT'S A MAYBE CURVED OR SOMETHING 
MM MM 'KAY 
SO THIS FOR THE NEXT MEETING THOUGH 
I THINK WE MIGHT BE OUT OF TIME OUT OF TIME FOR THIS MEETING 
YEP 
NO 
SO SO THIS IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO DO FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW FOR THE NEXT MEETING 
MM 
OKAY WELL SO THIS UM DESIGNING A WAY TO EVALUATE IT IS 
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO SET UP TEST GROUPS AND THINGS 
MM 
OKAY 
YEP 
MM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
THANKS GUYS 
OKAY SO WE ARE JUST WAITING FOR MATTHEW 
MM 'KAY 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I THINK YEAH THE MATTHEW IT SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT MATTHEW YEAH SO HERE BECAUSE 
IT'S REALLY A A TIME UH PROJECT WITH A TIME AND IF SOMEONE IS NOT HERE THEN WE CANNOT BUT IT'S OKAY IT'S GOOD 
MM-HMM 
SO CAN YOU REPEAT AND BE MORE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID 
UH ABOUT THE FEELING YEAH UH YOU 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH VERY CLEAR 
IT LET THE PEOPLE CHOOSE YOU MEAN 
YEAH 
YEAH A RANGE OF UH YEAH A SET OF THREE FOUR DIFFERENT ASPECTS 
SURE THAT FITS THE 
YEAH YEAH I AGREE 
YEAH 
AND YOUR PART IS VERY RELATED TO MEAN BECAUSE WHEN YOU SUGGEST SOMETHING THEN IT HAS TO BE INTEGRATED INSIDE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WHAT FUNCTIONALITIES DO YOU SUGGEST FOR THAT 
FOR FACING THIS PROBLEM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
AND YOU WANT OKAY FOR COMING BACK TO ONE POINT Y YOU WANT TO LET THE USER TO PROGRAMMING THE KEYS 
SOME OF THEM 
AND UH ISN'T THAT TOO DIFFICULT FOR THE WE WANT W I DON'T KNOW IF WE STILL WANT THE UM R. C. TO BE EASY TO USE THAT'S THE COMPROMISE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
A STANDARD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM YEAH LIKE I WOULD SAY THAT FOR PROGRAMMING UH KEYS YOU SAID 
UH IT COULD BE UH EASILY UH DONE WITHIN THE THE PACKAGE OF TWEL TWELVE EUROS 
BUT FOR THE U. S. R. SYSTEM UH I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S FEASIBLE TO HAVE THESE ARE 
WE 
EXACTLY YEAH I IF IF IT'S A LOW VOCABULARY IT'S ALREADY IMPLEMENTED AND WE HOW MUCH IT'S COST MAYBE WITH A F CHEAP CHIP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
IT'S TRUE 
MM-HMM 
I DON'T KNOW HOW IF IF I HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE 
OKAY 
SO WHAT I'M GONNA PRESENT HERE IS VERY UH UM YEAH BASIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ALL THE THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE INSIDE A A R. C. A REMOTE CONTROL 
AND HOW IS IT MANUFACTURED H WHAT IS THE PROCESS JUST TO EXPLAIN YOU 
SO THE METHOD IS THERE THERE IS A A SET OF COMPONENTS IN A IN A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE 
AND UH WHAT COST THE THE COMPONENTS IN THEMSELF DO NOT COST A LOT ABOUT THE THE WAY TO ASSEMBLE EVERYTHING COSTS OBVIOUSLY 
AND I WILL UH SHOW YOU MY PREFERENCES UH UH AT THE END 
SO THERE ARE TWO UH DIFFERENT TYPES OF UH UM 
TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OF USING THE THE COMPONENTS FOR MAKING A A REMOTE CONTROL 
UH THE BASIC WAY IS IT IS A AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT AND SOME UH TRANSISTORS WITH ONE THAT AIMS AT COMMUNICATING UH UH THE MESSAGE AND IT TO SEND THE MESSAGE TO THE AIM AT THE LED THAT WILL UH TRANSMIT TO THE RECEIVER 
AND UH YEAH THE OTHER COMPONENTS AND THE CIRCUIT BOARD BUTTONS INFRARED LED ETCETERA FOR THE COMPONENTS UM 
SO YOU FINDING JUST TO SAY THAT THE CHIP CAN DETECT UH WHEN A KEY IS PRESSED AND THEN IT TRANSLATE TO THE OKAY 
IT A SEQUENCE SOMETHING LIKE MORSE CODE AS YOU KNOW UH WITH A DIFFERENT SEQUENCE FOR EACH OKAY 
AND UH UH THAT'S WITH THE COMPONENTS WE WILL SO WE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT UH MESSAGES DIFFERENT SEQUENCES 
AND THE CHIPS SENDS THAT SIGNAL SIGNAL TO THE TRANSISTOR THAT AMPLIFY TO MAKE IT STRONGER UM 
SO ELECTRONIC PARTS ARE ASSEMBLED ONTO UH PRINTED BOARDS UH BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO MASS PRODUCE AND ASSEMBLE 
AND UH SO I THINK FOR OUR DESIGN WE WANT SOME B UH PROGRAMMABLE UH YOU KNOW V. V. L. S. A. OR F. P. G. I. UH HIGH TECHNOLOGY 
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT AND ALSO WE'LL SEE UH YEAH LIKE IN ANY UH HIGH TECH UH DEVICES A CHIP OF FI FIBREGLASS TO THEM AND CONNECT THEM 
SO MY PERSONAL DESIGN WE NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION WHAT UM WHAT IS THE MATERIAL OF THE COVER WE WANT TO USE 
IF IT'S PLASTIC OR YOU SAID THAT YEAH YOU HAD SOME IDEAS UH LIKE FRUIT VEG OR I DUNNO 
YES 
YES 
YES 
YEAH LIKE THEY DO IN WITH CARS I THINK 
YEAH INSIDE THE CAR YEAH 
SO THEY ALSO EMAILED ME THAT UH THEY HAVE AVAILABLE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS A SCROLL WHEELS INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTONS AS SUCH AS A COMPUTER MOUSE 
AND UH VERY CHEAP L. C. D. S SO LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS SO I'M WONDERING I THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE L. C. D. INTO OUR R. C. 
AND THE FINAL POINT OKAY SO UM WE HAVE YEAH THERE ARE SOME UH COMPROMISE TO TO DO 
SO WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT THE PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP 
BUT THE SCROLL WHEEL UH AND THAT KIND OF HIGHER HIGH TECH STUFF NEEDS MORE MONEY UM WHICH IS A HIGHER PRICE RANGE ALRIGHT 
AND THE DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP WHICH ONE TURNS IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE REGULAR CHIP 
BUT I THINK UH WITH TWELVE EUROS UM AND IF IT'S UH UH MADE FOR MM FOUR MILLION UH ITEMS 
THEN I THINK WE WE COULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT 
SO IT TO SUM UP UM 
WE NEED YEAH SO I I JUST SAID THAT THE COMPONENTS UH THE LIST OF COMPONENTS UH HAS TO BE UH YEAH LISTED AND UM AND UM ASSEMBLY IS A AN IMPORTANT PROCESS THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT 
AND UH FOR THE DESIGNING OF THE COVE UH UH COVER LAYOUT THEN IT'S BETTER TO TO TO MAYBE IS THAT WITH UH THE THE U. R. EXP U. R. I. EXPERT SO THAT WE CAN IT'S REALLY A TEAM WORKING UH 
SO I I CANNOT DESIGN SOMETHING WITHOUT YOUR AGREEMENT RIGHT 
YES 
YEAH IT'S KIND OF UM SIMPLE PRO PROGRA PROGRAMMABLE DEVICE AND WE HAVE TO INSERT 
I THINK WE COULD INSERT ONE THAT COULD UNDERLIE SEVERAL FUNCTIONS OF 
EXACTLY YEAH FOR CUSTOMIZING AND YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
EXACTLY YEAH THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA WE COULD HAVE UH IN MAIN CHIP UH THAT COULD HANDLE UH IT'S CALLED F. P. G. A. CHIP 
THAT COULD HANDLE BOTH UH LIKE SCROLLING WHEELS AS WELL SO UH L. C. D. AND YEAH 
YES 
YEAH ALSO THINKING I THINK BOTH UH IF WE HAD A BUDGET OF TWENTY TWENTY UH ERASE IT WILL BE OKAY BUT UH 
YEAH THAT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE PRICE IN IN HEAD BUT FOR NEXT MEETING I'M SURE YEAH BE ABLE TO DO THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I AGREE ON THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT I IT'S A DETAILED UH YEAH YEAH UH PLASTIC VERSUS UH WOOD 
AND WE NEED MAYBE TO CENTRE OUR DESCRIPTION ON UH THE THE REALLY THE WHITE BUTTONS WHAT UH FUNCTIONALITY WE WANT TO OFFER TO THE USER 
AND MAYBE WITH UH GRAPHS OR I DON'T KNOW UH USER INTERFACE DESIGNER YOU COULD MAYBE UH HELP US IN THAT 
YEAH 
PERFECT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH CUSTOMIZED 
YEAH 
I AGREE YEAH AND NOT TO ME TOO MANY KEYS OF COURSE YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN 
YEAH I LIKE ALSO THIS ONE 
YEAH 
THE POINT IS WE MAYBE WE NEED TO LOSE IT MAKE A DECISION ON HOW HOW HOW BIG WE WANT TO BE AND HOW MANY BUTTONS LIKE ONE WE SHOULD DEC DECIDE NUMBERS OR 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
PERFECT 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
TWO OR THREE PROTOTYPES 
TWO 
OKAY 
YEAH AND FIND MAYBE A COMPROMISE 
PERFECT YEAH 
THANKS 
SORRY 
SO 
YEAH I SENT YOU THE SLIDES YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM 
OKAY 
SO 
'KAY 
YOU CAN 
YEAH 
VOILA 
YEAH 
YEAH SO THEN WE COULD DISCUSS LATER LIKE WE CAN PUT ALL IDEAS TOGETHER 
IT SHOULD BE EASIER WITH THAT 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH SO I'LL I'LL GO WITH THAT ACTUALLY SO UM 
OKAY SO UM SO THEN THE THE IDEA OF UH HAVING A REMOTE IS GENERALLY YOU HAVE UH DIFFERENT KEYS AND UH DIFFERENT STRUCTURES DIFFERENT FORMS 
AND UH THEY COULD BE LIKE BUTTONS ARE LIKE AND UM THEY COULD BE OF UH A VARYING SIZES IF YOU WANT TO TO UH BASICALLY EMPHASIZE A PARTICULAR KEY MORE THAN THE OTHER 
AND UH MAYBE LIKE YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS FOR EXAMPLE HAVING THE R RED FOR THE ON OFF SWITCHING ON AND OFF THE BUTTON 
SO THIS THIS IS THE GENERAL TREND TO UH THE METHOD THEY DO 
SO WHAT I HAVE FOUND WAS THAT UH CURRENTLY UH TH THEY ARE MOSTLY THAT THE T. V. 
V. C. R. MUSIC SYSTEM OPERATED ONES ACTUALLY AND THEY ARE VERY SPECIFIC TO EACH OTHER 
BUT THERE ARE SOME COMMON KEYS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE V. C. R. AND IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE UH G UH S SOME UH SOUNDTRACK ON THE W W SO THEY HAVE THE COMMON THING ACTUALLY YOU CAN HAVE AND UH 
THERE IS ALSO UM A SPEECH RECOGNITION TO STORE CHANNEL INFORMATION NAMES LIKE YOU CAN BASICALLY IF YOU HAVE A MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITY SAY T. V. 
V. C. R. OR SOMETHING I SAY IT AT THE T. V. AND THE T. V. 
AND YOU CAN PROGRAMME THE KEYS IF YOU WANT TO CERTAIN KEYS OR EVEN THE CHANNEL INFORMATION 
YEAH YEAH SO Y Y YOU CAN JUST UH BECAUSE UH IS MORE AND MORE CHANNELS COME THEN YOU HAVE MORE AND MORE PROBLEMS TO REMEMBER THE V V EXACT CHANNEL NUMBERS EX EXACTLY 
EVEN IF YOU ARRANGE IT BY HOWEVER YOU ARRANGE IT YOU STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM TO REMEMBER EXACTLY WHICH CHANNEL YOU WANT IT 
SO IT IT IT'S LIKE IT LIMITED ONE 
IN THE PRESENT MARKET I SAW IT THAT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THEY ARE LOOKING FOR EIGHTY WORD THING 
EIGHTY WORD WHICH SHOULDN'T BE THE THAT DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT LIKE EIGHTY TO HUNDRED WORD 
BASICALLY YOU WANT YOU DON'T WANT TO STORE ALL THE CHANNELS IN THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU WANT TO ST STORE YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL 
YEAH SOME TEN TWELVE CHANNEL INFORMATION 
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO ST STORE ALL THE HUNDRED CHANNEL INFORMATION INTO THAT 
AND UH BASICALLY UH IT DEPENDS LIKE THE REMOTE WITH L. C. D. DISPLAY FOR BROWSING BECAUSE YOU HAVE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITIES FOR EXAMPLE YOU ARE WATCHING A MOVIE 
AND UH UH YOU ARE HAVING A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL AND YOU WANT TO UH YOU DON'T KNOW REALLY WHICH FUNCTIONALITY IS NOW 
SO I AM USING THE T. V. S 
EVERY TIME I SEE IT IT COULD BE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I CAN USE A SIMPLE TOGGLE SWITCH 
AND A DISPLAY SO I PRESS IT IS THE DISPLAY SAYS OKAY I'M ON T. V. OR D. V. D. OR WHATEVER IT IS 
INSTEAD OF HAVING THREE KEYS SEPARATELY FOR FOR KEYS TO MODEL THE FUNCTIONALITIES WILL INCREASE ACTUALLY 
AND FOR YOU AND YOU MIGHT WANT YOU DON'T WANT SEPARATE KEYS FOR ALL OF THEM 
YOU CAN'T 
AND UH WELL THERE CAN BE CHILDREN FRIENDLY WHERE YOU CAN PROGRAMME YOUR REMOTE IS THAT THEY THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED UH TO BROWSE CERTAIN CHANNELS WHICH YOU CAN BLOCK THEM 
AND YOU CAN OPERATE THEM 
SO THESE ARE THE THINGS PRESENTLY WHICH ARE SEEN IN THE MARKET SCENARIOS AT PRESENT 
I PERSONALLY WOULD LOOK AT THINGS LIKE HAVING A U UNIVERSAL REMOTE IS UH UM AS A GOOD IDEA 
LIKE INSTEAD OF HAVING UNUSUAL ONES FOR ALL OF THEM YOU CAN THINK OF HAVING UM WITH MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITY POSSIBLY WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION 
I GOT A MAIL FROM THE THE COFFEE MACHINE INTERFACE INTO THAT UH THEY HAVE UH INTEGRATED THE SOU SPEECH RECOGNITION INTO A INTO THE COFFEE MACHINE 
AND SO IF YOU SAY HELLO COFFEE MACHINE TO SAY HI JOE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AND UH 
YEAH YOU YOU WON'T BE USING IT SO IT'S A LIMITED VOCABULARY MM THING AND VERY ISOLATED WORD AND IT'S UH IT IS INTERESTING 
AND BASICALLY STORING THE CHANNEL THROUGH VOICE OR OTHER WAYS OF PROGRAMMING YOUR KEYS 
IN THE DISPLAY FOR THE BROWSING WHICH IS AGAIN AND MAYBE HAVING SOMETHING LIKE A BLINKING THING 
LIKE UH IT COULD INDICATE YOU'RE UH IT IT COULD INDICATE WHAT IS CAL LIKE THE UH WHETHER UH Y YOU HAVE ENOUGH BATTERY IN YOUR IN YOUR UH REMOTE 
THE BLINKING 
AT THE SAME TIME IF IT'S A DARK ROOM IT CAN BE USED TO LOCATE THE REMOTE ALSO OR 
YEAH YOU CAN LET THEM TO DO THAT 
NO NO BUT THE IF YOU GIVE IT D DEPENDS ON THE EASINESS LIKE THE USER HOW MUCH EFFORT HE CAN PUT 
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE UH I WOULD LIKE TO STORE IN CERTAIN WAY 
SO IF YOU WANT TO GIVE THE FULL FREEDOM TO THE USER ARE YOU WANT TO KEEP SOME CONSTRAINTS AND LET THE USER IS IT WITH THAT CONSTRAINT 
SO TO DO 
SO 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE WILL WE CAN STILL LOOK AT WE CAN TALK WITH THE COFFEE UNIT AND YOU CAN UH CHECK HOW MUCH HOW MUCH THEY YEAH YEAH YEAH 
MAYBE WE CAN COME W WE CAN TALK TO THEM AND WE CAN COME WITH THAT YOU KNOW 
AND ALSO WELL YOU CAN THINK OF HAVING UH SINCE YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW SOMETHING MAYBE IF YOU ADDED LITTLE BIT OF DISPLAY 
YOU MIGHT NEED THE TO CHE KEEP CHECKING THE BATTERY 
SO YOU REALLY NEED A SOME KIND OF INDICATOR SO IT COULD BE A BLINKING OPTION OF L. E. D. IT COULD ACTUALLY BE USED TO DETECT ALSO 
IF IT'S IN A DARK ROOM YOU CAN BASICALLY DETECT IT ALSO 
SO 
NO ACTUALLY I IF I IT IS LIKE YOU KNOW IT TELLS YOU UM IT CAN BE FOR TWO PURPOSES 
LIKE IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY AND ALL THESE THINGS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE STANDARD REMOTE 
WHICH IS HAVING UH WHICH AND JUST UH SIX SIX VOLT UH THE SORRY THREE VOLTS UM OF D. C. 
IT MAY NEED MORE ACTUALLY SO Y Y YOU MAY NEED TO CHECK YOUR BATTERY USAGE IT AND THEN YOU NEED THAT 
SOME FUNCTIONALITY TO INDICATE THE BATTERY LIMIT 
AND THEN OF THE BATTERY LIMIT IS INDICATED 
IF IT COULD BE IND INDICATED THROUGH A BLINKING SOMETHING AND IT CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR DEPENDING ON YOUR UH HOW MUCH AS THE BATTERY 
WELL THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO EVEN LOCATE EVEN IF YOU WANT IT 
YOU KNOW 
YEAH SO 
YOU YOU HAVE TIME SOME MORE 
YEP 
SURE YOU CAN YOU KNOW 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH MM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SORRY 
YEAH SO OF COURSE FOR EXAMPLE UH I WANTED TO KNOW LIKE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A A IF IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY OVER THERE 
OR IF YOU WANT TO STORE A PROGRAMMES WITH A KEYS 
WHAT KIND OF THINGS YOU'LL NEED INSIDE YOUR THIN INSIDE 
W WH WHAT 
W WHAT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO ON THAT CASE YOU CAN EVEN LOOK AT THE TECHNOLOGY WHAT THE MOBILE PHONE IS TRYING TO USE WITH THE CARD 
YEAH WHERE THEY DO ALL THE W WITH WITH THEM ACTUALLY 
HOW F COST EFFECTIVE IT WOULD BE TO PUT THAT CAR CHIP INTO IT AND DO THE PROGRAMMABLE THINGS 
D WELL 
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL FIT INTO OUR COST OF TWELVE POINT FIVE OR YOU KNOW 
SO IT POSSIBLE TO FIT IN IT THAT 
SORRY 
YEAH THAT'S UH THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH I WANTED TO ASK YOU ALSO LIKE WHAT WILL BE THE EACH INDIVIDUALLY THE COST OF IT 
FOR EXAMPLE IF IF IF YOU WANT TO PUT WOOD I WOULDN'T SUGGEST FOR WOOD UH 'CAUSE IT'S I THINK IT'S UM 
MUCH EASIER TO USE A PLASTIC OR A RUBBER RATHER THAN WOOD 
IT WILL BE MUCH CH MUCH EXPENSIVE TH THOUGH IT'S THE MOST NATURAL THING BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S UH 
YEAH WE WE CAN GIVE A PREFERENCE TO THEM 
BUT IT IS ABOUT WITH PLASTIC OR THE RUBBER OR WHATEVER IT SO IT'S MUCH BETTER WITH THAT RATHER THAN GOING FOR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU 
OKAY 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH WE WILL UH 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WE CAN GIVE THEM SMOOTH KEYS YOU KNOW 
SMOOTH KEYS 
WITH BIGGER S UH 
SO THAT YOU KNOW 
THE THE PROBLEM MOST OF THE TIME WE'VE SEEN THE KEYS IS THAT IT'S SMALL 
AND EVERY TIME WE HAVE TO BE VERY BUT IF I TH IF WE IF WE GO TO A DIFFERENT WAYS OF DESIGNING THOSE KEYS 
THEN YOU CAN MERGE THEM TOGETHER TOO 
UH YOU CAN ACTUALLY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SEE THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE QUITE SMALL OVER HERE AND UH NOW YOU CAN 
FOR EXAMPLE SO I WAS IF YOU MAKE THEM BIG IT MAY CHANGE THE LOOK OF THE THING ELSE TO THE PEOPLE 
AT THE SAME TIME TO USE UM MORE UH LIKE IT WOULD BE MORE INTERESTING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING THIS R. S. I. AND ALL PROBLEM 
UH BIG KEYS MAY BETTER FOR THEM ACTUALLY AND UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES 
YEAH SO IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE MODEL HERE SO YOU CAN PUT THE KEYS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH MM 
WE SHOULD MAKE A 
YEAH THAT YEAH NEXT MEETING WE SHOULD BE 
YEAH THAT WOULD DEPEND UPON IS ACTUALLY 
YEAH OKAY 
NO NO 
I DON'T HAVE 
MAYBE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING IF YOU COULD LIKE UM 
FOR THE COST INVENTORIES OF OTHER DEVICES IF YOU'RE USING SPEECH RECOGNITION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
MM 
TWO 
NO FOR LIKE COST AND THE ONE WITH LIKE HIGHER AND SO THAT THEN WE CAN BE EASILY COMPARING THEM OR YOU KNOW FIND A COMPROMISE BETWEEN BOTH OF THEM 
YEAH THAT'S HOW TO USE 
YEP 
OKAY 
SO WE ARE DONE 
FOR NOW 
MM 
OH 
SO I SUGGEST WE START THE MEETING UH WITHOUT MATTHEW UH HE'S UH OBVIOUSLY LATE FOR SOME REASON 
GOOD 
UM 
TODAY UH WE WILL UH TALK ABOUT UH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
I HOPE UH YOU BOTH DID SOME UH SOME WORK UH 
CONCERNING A UH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
UM THIS WILL BE THE UH AGENDA FOR 
THE MEETING UH 
UH I WILL 
TAKE SOME MINUTES UH AGAIN 
UM WE WILL HAVE THE PRESENTATIONS IF YOU IF YOU DIFFERENT TEAM MEMBERS AND THEN TRY TO COME TO DECISIONS UH ABOUT THE CONCEPTS UH YOU HAVE PRESENTED 
SO AND THAT UH WELL UH WE HAVE SOME UH FORTY MINUTES UH TO COMPLETE THIS UH 
SO UM WHO HAS THE FIR DO YOU HA ANNA DO YOU HAVE YOUR PRESENTATION READY 
OKAY 
OH THERE IS MATTHEW 
SO 
GOOD 
DO PRESENTATION READY 
OH OKAY 
SO DID YOU MANAGE UH 
OH YES I SEE HIM GOOD YES 
NO 
OKAY MM YES I HAVE TO 
MM 
MM 
HMM 
SPONGY FEEL 
MM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YES WELL MAYBE MATTHEW CAN CAN GIVE SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THE 
MM 
OKAY GOOD THAT'S VERY CLEAR 
'KAY 
UM 
OH 
MAYBE WE YES WELL WE MAYBE CAN DECIDE LATER ON UM THE L THE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF UH I'VE IT WAS A GOOD IDEA MAYBE IT IT 
YES THE THE THE THERE ARE CHANGEABLE COVERS 
BUT IN THE OTHER HAND I I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MY SUPERIORS WOULD BE SO GLAD WITH IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO INTRODUCE A COMPLETE UH UH NEW L LINE OF UH OF SUPPLIES UH IT WOULD BE UH VERY COMPLICATED UH ORGANISATIONAL 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES 
MM-HMM 
YES AND OF COURSE IT WILL BE A W WE GOT A IF IT WORKS WE CAN GET UH AFTER SALES I MEAN THAT WOULD WOULD BE VERY GOOD I MEAN THOSE COVERS COULD GO FOR FOR THREE 
FIVE EURO 
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA UM 
AND THEN UH 
MAYBE UH WE CAN GO A TH MATTHEW'S PRESENTATION BECAUSE 
THE 
TOGETHER INDEED UH BECAUSE YOU M MIGHT HAVE SOME SOME INFORMATION ON THE THE EASY TO SEE WHAT YOU WERE ALREADY MENTIONING 
UM YES BUT BUT I D MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE A HAND TO USE BECAUSE I I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THAT THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THAT FOR TWELVE EURO AND FIFTY CENTS 
I'M SORRY TO HAVE 
EVERY TIME I HAVE TO COME DOWN ON THIS PRICE AGAIN TO USE THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE LIMITING FOR YOUR CREATIVITY BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S THE REAL 
WE HAVE TO CONSIDER IT 
SO SO DO WE THINK THESE IDEAS ON AND MY UH SP SPEECH RECOGNITION 
I MEAN MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE FOR FOR TWELVE EURO BUT THEN THEN IT WILL BE TO COST OF OTHER FUNCTIONALITY WE MIGHT IMPLEMENT LIKE THE UH UH THE THE THE FURRY UH UH CASE OF THE 
MM 
MM MM 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 
'KAY GOOD 
MM YES UM I WOULD 
YES YES YOU CAN YOU CAN STILL 
WE HAVE TIME 
NICE 
MM-HMM 
WELL WELL M M MAYBE M MAYBE WE CAN GIVE THE UH THE UH THE CASE A VERY UH UH NORMAL A V VERY NORMAL CASE BUT 
WITH THE CHANGEABLE COVERS IT FANCY IT UP 
SO LIKE A NORMAL CHEAP PLASTIC CASE WHICH CAN BE COVERED UP ON FOR INSTANCE A WOODEN CASE 
I MEAN JUST WHAT 
MM-HMM 
MM 
ONE OF COURSE 
SO 
SO I IF I THINK WE WE SHOULD COME TO SOME DECISIONS NOW UH A BIT THIS 
UM SO I UNDERSTAND UH WHEN WE WANT A DISPLAY WE NEED A EXPENSIVE CHIP 
BUT WHEN WE WANT A SCROLLING WHEEL W WE ALSO AND THE EXPENSIVE CHIP IS CAN WE USE SOME CHIP IS WITH AN EXPENSIVE CHIP 
WE CAN UH IMPLEMENT SEVERAL COMPLICATED UH OR ADVANCED FEATURES 
YES 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO WHEN THE MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP YOU MENTIONED THERE IS IS POSSIBLE IN THE ON THE GIVEN BUDGET UH MAYBE WE SHOULD GO FOR FOR THE MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP 
SO ALL FEATURES UH WHICH YOU MENTIONED CAN BE IMPLEMENTED BASED ON THE SAME CHIP 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S FEASIBLE 
OH 
YOU THE YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE 
HMM 
MM YES WH WHEN YOU MAKE A A DESIGN CA YOU CAN NEXT MEETING YOU CAN GIVE AN QUITE AN EXACT COST PRICE 
THAT WE THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA 
MM 
GOOD GOOD 
YES BUT I CAN I THINK UH I THINK WE CAN JUST USE MORE CHEAP PLASTIC FOR A KIND OF BASIC EDITION 
AND THEN PEOPLE CAN FANCY IT UP WITH WITH MORE EXPENSIVE MATERIALS WHICH WHICH CAME WITH A WITH ANOTHER PRICE 
DO DO YOU AGREE 
UM I I THINK UH FOR NEXT MEETING WE C YOU TWO CAN PRESENT A REAL DESIGN 
UH SO DRAWING IT IN THE BOARD 
AND THEN WE NOW SH ONLY HAVE TO TO TO DECIDE THE GENERAL FUNCTION UH 
SO UM 
LET LET'S SAY NEXT MEETING WE YOU PRODUCE TWO DESIGNS ONE ONE 
NO LESS ADVANCED AND ONE MORE ADVANCED AND WITH THE COST PRICE 
UH FURTHERMORE WE GO FOR THE FOR THE UH BASIC PLASTIC CASE WHICH CAN BE LATER UH FANCIED UP WITH UH 
WITH ADDIT UH ADDITIONAL UH HOW DO YOU CALL THEM THESE LOOK LIKE MOBILE TELEPHONES YOU CAN PUT A COVER OVER IT 
BUT THAT THAT THAT THAT CAN BE DONE LATER 
WE NOW CAN CONCENTRATE ON THE ON THE BASIC REMOTE CONTROL 
UM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
YES YES YES BI BIG KEYS IS IS GOOD THING I THINK 
NO NO 
MM MM MM 
MM W BUT THEN YOU HAVE STILL HAVE UH WHEN YOU DON'T USE IT YOU HAVE SUCH A A AN EXTENT OF YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WHICH YOU DON'T SEE 
SO MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE UH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN CAN INDICATE THIS 
THAT YOU CAN ELSEWHERE OPEN YOUR REMOTE CONTROL AND IN THE INSIDE OR UH BUTTONS YOU DON'T SEE THAT MUCH 
YES 
YES I I TH THAT'S WHAT I MEAN SO I MEAN SOMETHING 
LIKE LIKE A BOOK 
MM 
JU JUST MAKE TWO DESIGNS 
AND THE W WE CAN DECIDE DECIDE BETWEEN THE THESE DESIGNS 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA 
SO ANYONE UH ANY QUESTIONS FOR NOW 
UM YES I CAME OUT THAT UH UH 
YES WELL M MAYBE UH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S POSSIBLE MAYBE YOU CAN START EVALUATING UH THEIR WORK SOMEHOW 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S POSSIBLE UH IN THE GIVEN TIME BUT A AS FAR AS POSSIBLE 
SO UH YOU TWO WILL BE TOGETHER W WORKING ON A O ONE TWO PROTOTYPES 
AND FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE UH WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY UH BY EMAIL 
TWO 
I 
MM AND THEN 
HMM 
YES OKAY 
OKAY LET'S CALL THIS IT ON AND 
DID YOU GOT MY EMAIL WITH THE SLIDES 
OH 
TRICKY 
DUNNO 
MAYBE THEY'RE SUPPOSED THE PEN'S SUPPOSED TO GO OVER THE SITES 
MIGHT BE SEAT FLOOR RATHER THAN PERSON 
YEAH PUT IT BACK 
YEP 
YEAH 
JO'S MAKING FACES AT UM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM OBJECT TRACKING 
OKAY 
WELL WE CAN'T N WE CAN'T DO EVALUATION 'TIL WE HAVE A DESIGN 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO IT'S IT'S IT A VERY BASIC REMOTE THEN IT'S ONLY 
MM 
MM 
CAN I SEE 
THANKS 
OKAY I LIKE THE VOLUME CONTROL THAT'S GOOD 
UH-HUH 
SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE BUTTONS 
DID YOU WANNA SEE 
MM 
IT WON'T TALK BACK 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
SO IT'S WELL OUTSIDE THE BUDGET THEN 
THAT'S ON TOP OF THE SIXTEEN OR IS IT PART OF THAT 
SO THAT TAKES IT DOWN TO THIRTEEN EUROS WITHOUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
MM-HMM 
MM 
WHAT'S THIS ONE ON THE SIDE 
OH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
I LIKE THE SHAPE OF THEM I DO LIKE THE 
THE SIZE AND THE THE SHAPE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
AND MAYBE WE RUN THE EVALUATION ON BOTH OF THE PRODUCTS BOTH OF THESE TWO 
OKAY 
BASICALLY THIS IS WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALREADY UM FROM THE MARKETING POINT OF VIEW 
WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT YEP 
SO IT'S JUST A SHORTLIST OF CRITERIA ON UM THE THINGS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS BEING IMPORTANT TO SELLING THE PRODUCT 
UM WE JUST GO THROUGH THIS AND RATE THEM AS A GROUP AND THEN AT THE AND WE'LL MAKE AN EVALUATION BASED ON THAT 
SO JUST AVERAGE THE SCORE OF THOSE ITEMS SO 
THESE ARE THE THINGS WE IDENTIFIED AS BEING IMPORTANT 
UM THE OTHER THINGS WERE LOOK AND FEEL INNOVATION AND EASE OF US 
WERE THE THREE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS UM APPEALING TO THE CORRECT DEMOGRAPHIC IS USING THESE THINGS IN THE RIGHT WAY TO APPEAL TO OUR DEMOGRAPHIC 
AND THEN GOIN FOLLOWING THE COMPANY MOTTO FOLLOWING THE FASHION TRENDS AND PUTTING THAT INTO THE PRODUCT AS WELL 
AS WELL DO YOU WANNA GO THROUGH AND PUT THROUGH THIS IN THE THE TWO PRODUCTS NOW OR DO WE WANNA DISCUSS THEM FURTHER AND THEN EVALUATE THEM 
OKAY 
SO IF JUST GO THROUGH ONTO THE WHITEBOARD I GUESS 
NOT SURE HOW THIS IS GONNA COME OUT 
SO THE FIRST ONE WAS REALLY VERY FAR BELOW BUDGET 
WOULD YOU WANT TO TAKE THE PRICE DOWN OF THE END PRODUCT ACCORDING TO THAT ARE JUST HAVE THE HIGH PROFIT ON IT 
'CAUSE IF WE'RE ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT FOR EIGHT EUROS THEN WE HAVE A 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO LOOK AND FEEL INNOVATION 
MM-HMM 
AND TRENDS 
UH YOU FOLLOWING THE IDEA OF USING THE UM REMOVABLE COVERS ON THIS 
SO THAT PART OF BOTH OF THEM OR 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEP 
SO IT'S THE PINK 
AND THE OTHER ONE'S GREEN 
OKAY SO LOOK AND FEEL 
WHERE UM ONE SO I'VE BROKEN THE PEN AGAIN 
SO YEAH 
GET THAT ONE 
UM W ONE'S BAD AND SEVEN'S THE BEST 
SORRY ONE'S TRUE AND SEVEN'S FALSE 
ONE'S THE BEST 
SO IN A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
IN THE SCALE U IT'S BETWEEN FUNCTIONAL AND FANCY BASICALLY WE'RE LOOKING TO USE 
MM-HMM 
FOUR 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
NO THAT'S THE INK'S DRIED 
BATTERY'S LOW ISN'T IT THE INK 
THE B THAT'S THE THAT THAT ONE 
BATTERY THERE 
MM 
NO I THINK IT'S LOST A BATTERY 
NO IT'S IT WOULD STILL WRITE BUT IT WOULDN'T PICK IT UP WITH THE SENSORS 
YOU GOT A SECOND 
WELL WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL 
SO THAT WORKING 
DID IT CAME OUT 
GOOD 
OKAY 
BECAUSE WE'LL BE ABLE TO USE IT STILL EVEN IF IT WASN'T WORKING 
IT'S JUST A NORMAL WHITEBOARD MARKER BUT IT WOULDN'T BE PICKED UP ON THE THE ACTUAL WHITEBOARD 
AND THE OTHER ONE 
I THINK IT'S SLIGHTLY BETTER UM 
IT'S HARD TO TELL FROM JUST THE PLASTICINE BUT 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE OTHER THING IS IS THE LEFT HAND ONE PROTRUDING 
'CAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE LEFT HANDED THEY WANT TO USE THE OTHER HAND MAYBE IT WON'T WORK AS WELL 
OKAY 
I'D SAY TWO OR THREE FOR THAT ONE PERSONALLY 
PROBABLY MORE TOWARDS OTHER THAN TWO 
OKAY 
MM OKAY 
YEAH IT'S D IT'S DEFINITELY MORE FANCIER THAN THAT ONE 
OKAY 
SO CONSENSUS 
TWO OR THREE 
TWO 
UM 'KAY 
INNOVATION 
THE FIRST ONE NOT REALLY MUC 
MM 
YEAH 
DO WE 
MM 
WHAT WHAT FEATURES ARE WE ACTUALLY INCLUDING 
ARE WE INCLUDING LIKE A LOCATION KIND OF THING LIKE TRYING TO FIND OUT 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT 
BUT THE IS THERE ANY THERE'S AN ACTUAL INNOVATION IN THAT AT ALL IT'S JUST A STRAIGHT TO REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO THERE'S NO THIS UH LOOK AND FEEL THING THOUGH THAT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION 
SO I'D BE UP FOR SEVEN FOR INNOVATION 
OKAY 
SO WHAT IS IT WHAT ARE THE INNOVATIONS WITH THIS 
GET THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
SO THAT IN THIS ONE THOUGH 
SO THIS 'CAUSE THIS IS THE 
TH TH THERE WERE DIFFERENT OPTIONS WE DISCUSSED THEN WE DISCUSSED THE ON THAT WAS ON BUDGET AND THE ON THAT WAS OUT OF BUDGET 
OKAY 
SO THE COST FOR THESE WERE WHAT WAS THE COST FOR THE FIRST ONE 
EIGHT EUROS 
AND THIS ONE WAS SIXTEEN EUROS 
OKAY 
SO 
INNOVATION FOR THIS ONE IS TWO 
NO 
TWO 
MM 
WELL THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS A VERY GOOD INNOVATION I BELIEVE IT IS 
GIVE IT A ONE 
YEP 
OKAY 
SO IF SO 
MM 
YEAH 
YEP 
SO THAT'S MAYBE A A TWO FOR EASE OF US 
OKAY 
SO MAYBE A THREE OR A FOUR 
MM 
OKAY 
CONSENSUS 
THERE ARE FOR 
THERE 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO THERE'S UH HOW WELL IT GOES TO THE TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC 
SO WE'RE D WE'RE STILL THINKING TWENTY TO FORTY YEAR OLDS 
THAT'S 
MM 
SO SH COMPLETELY CHANGED OUR DEMOGRAPHIC THERE IT'S NOT PART OF THE THE FUNKY YOUNG THING 
YEAH 
IF IT WAS THE VERY BOTTOM PRICE RANGE OR IT WAS LIKE BETWEEN THIS AND ANOTHER ONE WE DID THE SAME THING THEN I CAN IMAGINE IT BEING APPLYING TO THE THE DEMOGRAPHIC YEAH 
THAT'S IT'S STILL YOU 
MM 
'CAUSE WE HAVE GOT ROOM WE'VE GOT SOME BUDGET THERE TO ADD A FEW THINGS TO IT THAT'S RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
AND 
MM 
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAP WHATEVER THOUGH IT WAS SET WITH I WE'VE GOT A SET PRICE 
YEAH 
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD MAKE ME SPEND AN EXTRA K FEW EUROS ON THAT ONE RATHER THAN ANOTHER ONE 
OKAY 
UM AND THE DEMOKRAPHI DEMOGRAPHIC OF THE SECOND ONE 
IT'S GOT THE GET THE THE TOYS IN IT IT'S GOT THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
I THINK ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GONNA N HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN ON A LOW RANGE PRODUCT THEN THAT'S GOOD 
MM 
OKAY 
I'D PROBABLY GO WITH THEIR AGAIN FOR THAT ONE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO TWO YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEP 
AND ESPECIALLY I GUESS 'CAUSE THIS HAS THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AS WELL AND THAT MAKES IT MORE APPEALING IT'S MORE OF A A NEW FUN TOY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
AND FOLLOWING THE TRENDS 
SO THE TRENDS WERE THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES AND THE SPONGY FEEL 
SO SO IT IS NOT REALLY DOING EITHER OF THEM 
WELL THE SPONGY COULD BE PART OF THE THE FEEL OF THE BUTTONS AS WELL 
I KNOW SOME HAVE YOU TRIED THE MOBILE PHONES THAT HAVE GOT THE KINDA SPONGY BUTTONS AND NOT NOT EXACTLY SPONGY BUT I'M THINKING ONE OF THE NOKIAS THAT'S GOT LIKE YOU C IT HASN'T GOT INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS IT'S GOT JUST A ONE BUT IN IT AND SO YOU CAN THAT FEELS KINDA SPONGY 
SO IT'S SORT OF YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
BUT THAT'S IF YOU'RE USING THE COVERS 
OR IS IT JUST ONE 
WELL THEY MAKE IT FOR MOBILES IT CAN'T BE THAT MUCH MORE COMPLICATED 
SO YOU GET THE OPTION OF HAVING DIFFERENT COLOURS ARE DIFFERENT TEXTURES 
MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
I THINK THE IF WE DO THE COVER THAT'S REALLY GOING WITH THE COMPANY'S PHILOSOPHY OF HAVING THE FASHION IN IN ELECTRONICS 
IT LETS PEOPLE HAVE THE LATEST FASHION EVEN NEXT YEAR WHEN FRUIT AND VEGETABLES MIGHT BE TOO 
YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE TO PUT A NEW COVER ON IT AND THEN IT'LL STILL BE IN FASHION 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YEP 
YEP 
MM 
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF HAVING THE DIFFERENT COLOURS DIFFERENT COVERS 
MM 
THERE'S NO YEAH 
'CAUSE THAT'S THE THAT'S THE AFTER THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN THREE OF THEM 
ALTHOUGH IT IS MORE WITH THE SPONGY BUTTONS ON THE UM 
IN THE OTHER ONE 
OKAY 
SO 
TWO AND THERE ARE ON AND TWO 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY SO THE AVERAGE OF THAT IS 
THREE SIX NINE DIVIDED BY FIVE IS FIVE 
MM 
NINE BY FIVE ONE POINT IS EIGHT 
THIS ONE ELEVEN THIRTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE DIVIDED BY FIVE IS FOUR POINT TWO YEP 
OKAY 
BUT WE STILL GOT A VERY DIFFERENT PRICE FOR THESE TWO SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY COMPARABLE YET ANYWAY 
YEP 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
WELL IT'S EASIER TO JUST MAKE THAT ONE CHEAPER BY JUST TAKING THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IT 
THAT'LL BASICALLY TAKE US DOWN TO THE BUDGET 
MM 
YEAH IT'S GONNA BE MORE THAN JUST THE BIGGEST CASE DEFINITELY 
THREE OF THEM 
MM 
THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO BE NOT BASIC CASES 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THE BASIC ONE YEP 
SO NOW WE'RE THERE GOING BUTTON OR L. C. D. S L. C. D. DISPLAY 
SO THAT PRICE PER UNIT OR FOR THE WHOLE 
THING 
SO IT WOULD NEED TWELVE BUTTONS 
MM 
AND THAT'S WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS 
SO WE'D HAVE A SPECIAL COLOUR SPECIAL FORM AND SPECIAL MATERIAL IN ALL OF THEM 
THEY'RE NOT JUST STANDARD BUTTONS 
BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE CURVED ONE TWO IT'S LIKE IT'S CURVED ON THE SIDES AND CURVED ON THE TOP AND BOTTOM AS WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT 
YOU TALKING ABOUT CONCAVE CURVES 
YOU THINK A SINGLE CURVED 
MM 
WE HAVE MORE WE'VE GOT THIS THE SCROLL WHEEL ON THE SIDE AND YEAH 
THE ASCII 
MM 
WE'VE GOT A SCROLL WHEEL FOR THE VOLUME DON'T WE ARE SO AT SOME OTHER THING THAT'S NOT IN THERE 
'KAY WE'VE ONLY GOT FIVE MINUTES LEFT GUYS SO WE NEED TO WRAP IT UP PRETTY FAST 
SO THIS IS EVEN MORE THAN THE UM 
THEN THE COST YOU GIVE THE SIXTEEN EUROS 
BUT THAT'S SEVEN BASIC BUTTONS RIGHT SEVEN BUTTONS WITHOUT ANY ADDS ON WITHOUT SPECIAL COLOURS ARE FROM OUR MATERIAL 
WELL 
SO THE L. C. D. DISPLAY IS IS THREE FRANCS SORRY THREE EUROS BY ITSELF 
MM 
SO TWELVE EURO FIFTY WE GOT TWO OFF OF THE BATTERY WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT 
SO TEN FIFTY IF WE WANT AN L. C. D. DISPRA DISPLAY THAT'S SEVEN FIFTY 
UM SO WE'VE GOT SEVEN FIFTY TO USE FOR THE CASE AND FOR THE BUTTONS 
AND THE CHIP 
SORRY THE CHIP'S UP THERE ALREADY 
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SCALE THIS DOWN TO GET WITHIN BUDGET THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
MM 
YEP 
MM 
YEAH 
I THINK UNLESS WE CAN REALLY DRIVE THESE PRICES DOWN WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE L. C. D. DISPLAY 
FOR THE PRICE IT'S GONNA BE WHAT WE CAN AFFORD 
AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE WE CAN'T AFFORD THE L. C. D. DISPLAY THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN GET IT IN THERE 
MM 
MM-HMM 
I TH I'D LIKE TO TO TO BE IN BUT I CAN'T USE IT HAPPENING 
I CAN'T USE IT FITTING IN 
BU Y YOU'RE A POWER VOTER UH VETO ANYWAY SO PROJECT MANAGER 
WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION NOW THAT'S IT 
MM 
I THINK THEN WE WE'RE REALLY LOSING EASE OF US 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO L. C. D. 'S TO USE SPEECH REC OUT NOW 
WE'VE 
YEP 
YEP 
SO ARE WE BASICALLY BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ONE NOW BACK TO THE FIRST VERSION 
WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE ON BUDGET EXACTLY PRETTY MUCH 
WITH THIS NEW COSTINGS 
SO JUST LIKE TO FORGET THAT ONE AND LOOK AT THAT ONE NOW 
MM 
YEP 
OKAY 
WELL THAT'S THAT'S 
YEP 
SO 
MM 
YEP 
SO WE WE CAN GO BACK AND L TALK TO THE SUPPLIERS MAYBE AND SO IF WE CAN DRIVE THE PRICES DOWN TO ADD A FEW MORE THINGS IN BUT THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO WITH THE RESTRICTIONS WE HAVE TO THE MOMENT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
I GUESS I HAVE TO CHANGE THE PEN OTHERWISE 
WILL BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
YEAH 
AND DO YOU THINK IT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WHAT CAN YOU 
YEAH W WELL YEAH SO I WILL BE ABLE TO TO SUMMARIZE UH OUR MEETING 
BUT STILL I THINK UH IT WOULD BE IN VERY IMPORTANT OF THE UH SO UM MAIN DESIGNER 
I THINK WE CAN PUT IN THE HERE 
UH BASICALLY W YEAH WE WE DESIGNED THE TWO UH ITEMS 
UM CAN WE HAVE A PHONE CAN SOMEONE 
IT'S REALLY W WELL DESIGNED 
YEAH 
'KAY 
YEP 
GREAT 
YEP 
SO I WILL START BY THE THE BASIC ONE THAT UH 
FITS INTO UH EIGHT EUROS ACTUALLY RIGHT SEVEN EIGHT EUROS 
AND UH WELL FIRST FOR BOTH THEY HAVE UM A SPECIAL SHAPE MAYBE THE DESIGNER CAN UH EXPLAIN BETTER THAN UM BUT UH IT'S LIKE A SURF BOARD 
AND YOU YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SURF TO BROWSE TO SURF T. V. MAYBE THE WEB 
AND UH IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING SHAPE BECAUSE UM UNCONSCIOUSLY PEOPLE WANT TO USE TO SURF WHEN THEY USE THIS STUFF 
AND ALSO IT'S NOT TOO FAR FROM UM A MOBILE 
SO PEOPLE ARE USED TO THAT KIND OF SHAPE RIGHT 
DON'T TAKE CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE COLOUR BECAUSE WE YEAH WE DON'T TAKE YEAH 
SO HERE WOULD BE BASICALLY THE THE THE INFRARED UH UH LED YEAH L. E. L. E. L. E. D. 
THE ON OFF BUTTON IN RED 
HERE WOULD BE THE VOLUME 
IN THE ON THE LEFT OKAY SO EASY TO TURN ON IT AND OFF 
AND UM SO THIS IS A VERY CHEAP VERSION IS THERE ARE MAYBE YOU CAN CARRY ON UH MATTHEW 
HOW CAN YOU CHANGE FROM V. C. R. TO UH T. V. BY THE WAY 
OKAY YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
SEVEN EIGHT EI EIGHT EUROS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH ACTUALLY YEAH 
PLAY PAUSE 
EXACTLY YEAH 
TO DO NEED TO AVOID ON DEMAND 
YES 
THIS IS THE ORANGE BUTTON THE MICROPHONE 
NO YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
CRAZY DIS DESIGNER OKAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
OH ACTUALLY WELL 
IT'S LOW WEIGHT 
YOU HAVE TO USE YEAH YEAH THE THE COMPONENTS WE PUT INSIDE IS VERY LOW WEIGHT 
SO THE THE COST IS ACTUALLY A BIT MORE IT'S UH IT'S IT'S SIXTEEN FRANCS 
SIXTEEN EUROS SORRY 
THEN IT'S OUT OF BUDGET 
BUT THE THE MAIN POINT WE WE TALK ABOUT THAT WITH OUR UH MANUFACTURER 
AND THEY SAY BASICALLY THAT THE S. R. SYSTEM WOULD BE UH SOMETHING LIKE THREE FRANCS PER ITEM IS THREE EUROS SORRY 
AND UM 
NO NO NO PART OF THAT YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
WELL I THINK THE THE YEAH WE SHOULD STICK WITH UH A NUMBER OF KEYS BECAUSE IF WE ADD TOO MUCH THEN 
IT'S TOO 
LOCATI 
LOCATION 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
FUNCTIONALITY 
EASY TO USE 
TARGET 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
FOR MAYBE 
OH 
YEAH 
IF YOU PRESS LIKE THIS NOT LIKE THIS THEN YOU 
BUT 
OKAY 
TRY A 
PERFECT 
YEAH YEAH 
YEP 
WOW 
'KAY MAYBE 
IT'S NOT A BUTTON IT'S A LED IT'S A 
AC ACTUALLY YEAH IT SHOULD BE EMBEDDED 
YEAH 
UH YOU CAN PUSH PUSH IT AGAIN YOU CAN PUSH IT 
YEAH 
AND THE L. C. D. MAKES IT BETTER 
YEAH 
SO I WILL SAY TWO 
I WOULD SAY TWO THREE 
YEP 
BASICALLY THERE IS IN INNOVATION IN THE FIRST ONE COMPARED TO WHAT EXISTS IN THE MARKET RIGHT 
YEAH 
THE SURF UH DESIGN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
YEAH 
AND THE 
AND THE SECOND ONE IS REALLY UH STATE OF THE ART UH IN TERMS OF INNOVATION 
AND UM WITH MANY MORE FUNCTIONALITIES AND CAN OPEN AND CLOSE THE THE BOTTOM PART 
YEAH 
AND ALL THE SCROLLING UH BUTTONS AND MENU AND PRO PROGRAMMABLE DEVICE BEHIND THIS 
UH COULD PUT IT IT IN OUR TWO I WOULD SAY 
PERSONALLY 
OH 
YEAH AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION 
YEAH 
SO 
EIGHT 
WELL ACTUALLY WE HAVE YEAH TO CHECK AGAIN YEAH 
SIXTEEN 
W W ONE TO BE ON WHAT WOULD DO WE N ACTUALLY YEAH I DON'T SEE OKAY ONE WOULD WOULD BE WITHOUT BUTTONS 
BU 
YEAH 
SO MAYBE WE CAN PUT IN 
IT'S USING SPEECH RECOGNITION YEAH 
YEAH NO YEAH 
SO THE FIRST ONE IS REALLY STANDARD IS EVERYBODY I INCLUDING OUR GRANDMOTHERS CAN USE IT RIGHT 
YEAH 
UM THE OTHER ONE IS QUITE EASY THO THOUGH 
NO UM UM WE HOPE MAYBE SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET UH SCARED WITH THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS 
AND THERE IS A LIKE I WOULD SAY THREE 
OR MAYBE FOUR 
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE IT'S AN UH IT'S NOT LIKE A BIG ONE WITH UH ONE HUNDRED BUTTONS ARE SO 
THIS ONE WOULD BE UH FOR GRANDMOTHERS 
NO 
YEAH GRANDMOTHERS YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE IT'S IS IMPORTANT IT'S I IT WAS WRITTEN THAT IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT 
THE UM THE THE LOOK AND UH TAKING CARE OF ITS IT TARGETS THE RIGHT RANGE OF PEOPLE RIGHT 
YEAH 
BUT WE 
YEAH 
BUT FOR US IT'S YEAH WE HAVE A CONSTRAINT THAT WE NEED TO SELL AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND IF YOU WANT TO TARGET YEAH IF WE WE WISH TO TO SELL FOUR MILLIONS OF THIS I THINK FOR THIS AUDIENCE WE NEED ABSOLUTELY THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH 
OR EVEN 
EVEN ON AND TWO 
OR TWO 
YEAH 
TWO YEAH 
YEAH 
SPONGY 
UH THAT MEANS THAT IT GOES ON ON THE WATER 
OH OKAY 
BUT THIS ONE INCLUDES THIS FEATURE RIGHT 
SPONGY BUTTONS 
SO 
UH THE MAYBE IN THE COLOUR WE CAN MAKE IT UH FRUIT AND AND VEGGIE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THIS IS POSSIBLE 
YEAH EXACTLY LIKE NOKIA PHONES 
YEAH 
'CAUSE SOMETIMES LOOK AT THIS COMPUTER TH THIS LAPTOP IT'S ALL BLACK AND UH IT'S QUITE CONVENTIONAL 
AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TOO MUCH FLASHY COLOURS LIKE THIS ONE PRESENTED HERE 
SO MAYBE WE COULD DO LIKE IN THE RANGE THE SET OF WHAT WE PROPOSE A BLACK ONE 
VERY STANDARD ONE THAT MEETS THE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SUCH PEOPLE THAT WANT REALLY STANDARD UH THINGS 
YEAH 
YEAH AS A A POINT BETTER FOR THE FOR THE NUMBER TWO 
OKAY 
YEAH THE BLUE ONE UH SPONGY 
NINE 
VERY GOOD 
YEAH IT'S RIGHT YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
SO I I GAVE YEAH I JUST GIVE A CALL WITH THE MANUFACTURER UH AND UH I EXPLAINED THEM AND THEY TOLD ME THIS COULD BE POSSIBLE FOR SIXTEEN FR EUROS 
OH UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T USE THIS CHIP UH MATTHEW SO MAYBE WE HAVE TO RECAP WITH THIS ONE 
FOR THIS ONE IT'S A NORMAL BATTERY 
UH SAMPLE SPEAKER YEAH 
SIMPLE YEAH THIS ONE 
SO 
SO WHICH ONE OR WE TALKING TO 
WELL 
YEAH 
SO IT ZERO FRANC 
L. C. D. S 
IT'S OKAY 
JUST SAY L. C. D. 
NO BUT FOR THIS ONE IT'S TWELVE EURO 
THERE ARE TWELVE 
WAIT A MINUTE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT DOUBLE CURVED IT'S SINGLE CURVED RIGHT 
BECAUSE IT'S THERE IS IN LIKE 
WELL IT'S YOU KNOW THIS CURVE LIKE THIS IS IT'S W THERE IS ONLY 
SO SO SO THERE IS NOTHING LIKE YOU YOU KNOW IN THE OTHER STUFF THERE ARE YEAH CONCAVE 
SO I THINK WE CAN PUT UM 
THE SINGLE CURVED ON THE SIXTEEN 
THAT MAKES UH SEVENTEEN 
AND WHAT ARE JUST THE BT BUTTONS WE HAVE TWELVE BUTTONS ARE YOU SURE 
YEAH 
SO I HAD A BAD UH 
BAD ESTIMATION 
NO NO NO 
YES A KIND OF SCROLL WHEEL 
OKAY SO BASED ON THAT YEAH UM WHERE IS THE S OKAY SAMPLE SPEAKER 
BUT STILL YEAH IT 
NO WE CANNOT YEAH 
SO 
BUT THE UM 
YEAH BUT IF YOU HAVE THE NEAR THE L. C. D. YOU CAN UM CHOOSE SELECT BETWEEN UM YOU KNOW LIKE AN UNIVERSAL BETWEEN AUDIO 
T. V. AND V. C. R. AND THIS NEEDS A NEEDS A ADVANCED CHIP 
RIGHT MATTHEW

BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET YEAH 
YES 
YEAH 
ACTUALLY YEAH WE WE WE WILL NOT AND THE REALLY UH EXPERT DESIGNERS UM BECAUSE THE AMOUNT YEAH 
THANKS 
OR BROWSE 
MM 
NOW WE ARE SUPPOSED TO GIVE SOME OPER OFFERS RIGHT NOW 
I YEAH 
L. E. D. 
MM-HMM HMM 
ALSO SO YOU HAVE UH UH BROWSING THE CHANNELS ACTUALLY SO YOU CAN GO UP AND DOWN THE CHANNELS 
UH IF YOU HAVE A VIDEO OR SOMETHING YOU CAN FORWARD BACK 
OH NO NO NO THIS IS A SINGLE THIS THIS IS A MODEL WITH JUST THE T. V. ONE 
NO NO JUST SORRY THIS IS A STANDARD T. V. ONE WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT 
SO AND THEN WE HAVE USUALLY THERE TWELVE KEYS BUT WE KNOW THAT WE REL THAT WE HAVE ONLY TEN DIGITS 
THE EXTRA TWO OR FOR UH HAVING OR GIVING AN OPTION FOR UH HAVING MORE THAN ONE CHANNEL 
AND THE OTHER ONE IS FOR THE TELETEXT OR SOMETHING YOU WANT TO BROWSE THROUGH FROM THAT 
ACTUALLY 
IT'S A VERY BASIC MINIMAL THING WHICH YOU CAN WHICH IS WHICH IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET 
ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT IT THAT IT I NEED WOULD COST US TO BUILD IT BUT EIGHT EUROS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THIS ONE MODEL AND UH YEAH 
SURE 
TH THIS IS A MAGIC ONE BUT I KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW LIKE UH I I I IT IS A VERY FUTURISTIC 
IT'S LIKE UH IT'S LIKE A BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE AND ALL THIS STUFF WE ARE THINKING ABOUT IN THE FUTURE IT CAN COME 
SO THAT UH THEN WHAT WE LOOK AT YEAH 
THIS IS A MODEL YEAH 
YEP 
UH AS WELL THEN TH THIS IS THE A MORE A LITTLE UH SMOOTH AND IT GIVES A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY 
UH IN THIS WAY IS ALL WE HAVE UH THE EYE IS THERE ARE ONLY SIX KEYS 
BUT DON'T WORRY THEY ARE UM THEY ARE DOING THE JOB OF TWELVE KEYS ACTUALLY HERE 
AND SO THEY HAVE MORE SPACE ACTUALLY AND UH IT'S EASY TO UH SO THIS AND UH YOU HAVE UM SO THIS IS A STANDARD UH UH INFRARED EYE 
AND THEN YOU HAVE A POWER BUTTON WHICH L VOLUME WHAT YOU HAVE 
AND THEN OTHER THAN THAT YOU HAVE UH CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AND UH F SLOW PAUSE OR S SLOW LO YEAH S PAUSE OR STOP 
AND UH THEN UH YOU CAN UH YOU HAVE A L. C. D. DISPLAY 
HERE AND UH YOU THIS IS A FUNCTIONAL THING WHICH CAN CHANGE LIKE IT'S A TOGGLE SWITCH WHICH COULD CHANGE THE FUNCTION SAY YOU YOU PRESS IT 
YEAH 
I REALLY CAN CHANGE IT IS 
INSTEAD OF HAVING MANY SWITCHES Y 
THE L. C. D. CAN DISPLAY WHAT IS THAT IN THAT AND UH WELL YOU CAN HAVE A INTEGRATED MICROPHONE OVER HERE ARE IN THE BUTTON THE HERE 
SO WHICH CAN UH BASICALLY YOU WANT TO DO A SPEECH RECOGNITION AND UH THAT CHANNEL A LOT OF INFORMATION CAN BE DI DISPLAYED HERE DIRECTLY ON THE UM IN YOUR IN YOUR DISPLAY 
AND HERE IS A SMALL L. E. D. WHICH IS LIKE BLINKING ONE WHICH TELLS YOU LIKE UH ARE YOU RUNNING OUT OF THE BATTERY 
AND WHICH IS CAN BE USEFUL FOR THE LOCATING AS I WAS TALKING EARLIER OKAY 
AND UH WELL THEN WE HAVE A COVER BASICALLY BASICALLY YOU DON'T NEED MUCH OF THE TIME THIS 
WHEN YOU AND YOU CAN USE IT AND THUS GIVES ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY THAT TOMORROW YOU WANT YOU CAN ADD A TACTILE THING 
AT THIS COVER YOU KNOW 
DESIGN ENTER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S BASICALLY TO DO THAT 
ACTUALLY WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING THE T. V. WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING ANYTHING OR LISTENING TO THEM YOU HARDLY CARE ABOUT WHAT IS GETTING DISPLAYED HERE YOU KNOW 
UH YOU WANT TO UH AND THUS GIVES A PROTECTION TO THE L. C. D. ACTUALLY GIVING A COVER IT THAT ACTUALLY 
GIVES A PROTECTION BECAUSE WHEN IT FALLS DOWN OR SOMETHING 
IT TO USE IT IS IS IS IT GIVES A PROTEC IT'S MORE ROBUST THAT WAY 
OH YEAH 
AND YOU HAVE VERY GOOD CHANCES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT 
SIXTEEN EUROS 
YEAH 
THREE EUROS 
PART OF THAT 
YEAH 
WELL UH IF YOU WE CAN HAVE IF YOU HAVE NOW MORE IDEAS WE CAN ADD NEW MORE UH SOME MORE KEYS IF YOU WANT TO YOU KNOW 
YEAH IT IT SHOULD NOT BE CLUTTERING UP EVERYTHING 
OH THAT'S FOR THE IT'S KIND OF A L. E. D. FOR INDICATING YOUR BATTERY AND AS WELL SO IT'S LIKE A BLINKING ONE YOU KNOW YOU CAN KEEP IT SAID 
YEAH 
AND NOW IT EASY TO USE 
NO 
MM YEAH 
WELL I WILL GIVE IT MAYBE WE HAVE ANYWAYS THE WAY WE HAVE DESIGNED IT'S LIKE THE SURF AS YOU SAY YOU KNOW 
IT THOUGH THE LIKE IS FINE BUT UH STILL I WILL GIVE FOR ONE THAT CASE YOU KNOW 
FOUR YEAH THAT 
YEAH 
I WILL GO YEAH 
NO 
CA CAN YOU GET THE BATTERIES 
NO NO THE BATTERY HAS FALLEN DOWN THAT'S I 
YEAH 
NO NO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S HOW TO CLOSE A BATTERY 
OKAY 
NOW IT SHOULD BE 
SO THERE ANOTHER BATTERY THERE 
OH YEAH 
NO ACTUALLY THIS IS THIS IS NOT GOING TO PROTRUDE ACTUALLY IT IT'S NO I IT IS JUS 
IT'S A LED ACTUALLY WHICH WHICH I'LL BE COVERING IN A CURVE 
IT'S WILL BE EMBEDDED THERE IS IT WON'T BE REALLY YOU KNOW PROTRUDING OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO YOU TO TO NOT PROTRUDING ACTUALLY IT WILL GO IN BETTER NOT THAT 
UH IT'S FINE I THINK 
MY JUST THAT UM THE FILE IS THAT UM 
YOU RIGHT NOW YOU YOU DON'T USE THE FEEL BECAUSE RIGHT UH FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PRESS IT QUITE INSIDE NOW LIKE THIS NOW IT'S EMBEDDED ONE 
THIS IS HOW EMBEDDED IN WELL 
YEAH 
IT'S A BAS BASICALLY THE SAME THING ACTUALLY 
YOU WILL BE EXCEPT THAT IN THIS C 
YEAH 
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A SLIGHT THING FOR IT FORWARD AND 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
LOOKING LIKE 
NO BUT EXCEPT FOR THE DESIGN OF THE SURF 
YOU SHOULD BE OR 
OH NO I THINK IT'S MORE OF THE FILE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
SAY ABOUT THAT 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH IT GIVES IT 
YEP 
NO WE UH 
YEAH EIGHT EUROS YEAH 
SIXTEEN EUROS 
IT'S A TWO I WOULD SAY TWO 
YEAH 
OKAY YEAH 
OH 
UH IS USED TO TO CUT 
THEY ARE USED TO TO ACTUALLY 
HERE THERE MAY 
UH THOUGH IT HAS MORE FUNCTIONALITY I THINK IT SHOULDN'T BE FOR THE USER TO LEARN TO ACTUALLY 
IT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFI 
OH YEAH ACTUALLY IN FACT I THINK IT WILL BE YEAH 
YEAH BUT YOU 
WELL WE HAVE REDUCED THE KEYS ACTUALLY YOU SEE 
THERE IS FINE WITH UM 
YEAH IT'S A ACTUALLY THE USER HAS TO PUT SOME EFFORT TO DO IS THAT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT S SAY LIKE THIS IN THE NORMAL 
IS QUITE EASY YEAH 
INITIALLY THERE THERE IS A LOT OF EFFORT YEAH 
MM 
UH IN THIS WOULD I I WOULD I WOULD GIVE THIS MODEL TO THE OLD PEOPLE ACTUALLY 
YEAH 
AND 
OH YEAH 
I WILL I THINK 
YEAH 
OH YEAH BUT BUT IF YOU SELL IT IN THE MARKET IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAP ACTUALLY 
SO 
AND PEOPLE CAN STILL DECIDE TO USE THE CHEAPER ONE 
INSTEAD OF A 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO ON THAT CASE WELL IT'S FINE THEN 
WE CAN YEAH 
AND THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF 
YEAH I THINK IT'S UH IT HAS MORE MARKET ACTUALLY 
Y YEAH YOU KNOW TWO 
YEAH TWO YEAH 
BECAUSE TOMORROW THIS WILL BE MORE APPEALING BECAUSE YOU CAN ADD LOT OF SOPHISTICATION ON THAT 
BECAUSE THEN YOU YOU HAVE TO UH DO YOU HAVE LOT OF THINGS WHICH YOU CAN INCLUDE FOR THE PEOPLE TO 
WE HAVE TO PRACTICALLY TEST IT 
THE FIELD TEST WILL TELL YOU HOW GOOD 
THE TRENDS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I KNOW 
YEAH 
W W W W W YEAH IT'S THE WAY THEY ARE GOING TO BE ACTUALLY 
BUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO COVER THAT ACTUALLY 
NO THAT UH W IN THE MODE 
UH UH YOU ARE YOU SURE 
YEAH I THINK YEAH IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE LIKE WHAT WE DO WITH THE MOBILE PHONE YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH IT'S ONE 
YEAH IT SAYS A 
NO POINT SIX ONE POINT 
NO POINT EIGHT YEAH 
FOUR POINT 
UH FOUR POINT TWO 
WOW 
YEAH 
YEP 
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO RECONSIDER EVERYTHING WITH THIS YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IT MIGH IT IT'LL AND UH MORE THAN A CONVENTIONAL IN IT WON'T BE UH JUST MAYBE YOU MIGHT AS A A. A. BATTERY ACTUALLY 
WHAT DO YOU SAY MAEL 
YEAH 
CURVED 
DOUBLE CURVED YEAH RIGHT 
IT'S UH 
OR YOU TALKING ABOUT THESE ARE THAT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
A SPECIAL COLOUR 
OH 
OH GOOD 
YEAH WE MIGHT NEED A SCROLL WHEEL RIGHT FOR THAT 
NO FOR THAT ONE ELSE 
YEAH THAT'S A SCROLL 
YEAH ONE SCROLL WHEEL YOU MIGHT NEED 
OH 
BAD ESTIMATE RIGHT 
THAT IS THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER 
WE JUST NEED THAT ACTUALLY 
WE NEED ONE 
SO 
UH I I IT 
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE Y Y YEAH IT'S THE WITH THE REGULAR CHIP YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
THAT'LL BE THEN WE HAVE UH HAVE TO ASK THE USER TO PRESS IT SEVERAL TIMES 
OH 
ARE WE COULD EVEN REPLACE THEM BY BUTTONS ACTUALLY 
A ACTUALLY IT DEPENDS IT DEPENDS WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONALITIES YOU WANT TO ADD INTO IT 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ADD TWO MORE FUNCTIONALITIES THEN BETTER YOU ADD TWO MORE BUTTONS 
OR AND YOU'LL HAVE L. C. D. DISPLAY WHICH IS THAT IS GOING TO BRING THE COST BY TWO TWO EUROS AT LEAST 
OKAY SO WE CAN GET RID OF IT AND THEN ADD A COUPLE OF BUTTONS 
I THINK ABOUT 
YEAH BUT THE ONLY THING IS THAT WHAT IS THE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITIES YOU WANT TO INCLUDE WITH THAT 
YEAH 
W I I I JUST 
YEAH 
THAT WILL CREATE ANOTHER PROBLEM 
FOR THE PEOPLE TO USE IT 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY 
DOING THAT 
NO IT'S OKAY YOU UH CUT THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND INTRODUCE TWO MORE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
THAT'S IT 
COOL 
OKAY 
SO 
MATTHEW IS UH LATE AGAIN 
PROBABLY AN IMPORTANT MAN 
UM 
AS WELL IT IS IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO BE HERE UH

MM 
UM YES BUT W W 
YES MAYBE WE SHOULD PHONE HIM 
UM WELL 
UM WHEN HE IS NOT HERE WE WILL JUST WE JUST HAVE TO CONTINUE 
UM SO JUST FOR RECORD I I WILL TAKE UH NOTES AGAIN 
AND UM 
WELL FIRST THING UH I WAS UH UH I GOT AN EMAIL FROM UH FROM MY SUPERIOR AGAIN THAT WE REALLY SHOULD STAY WITHIN THE BUDGET OF THE UH TWELVE EURO AND FIFTY CENTS 
IT'S UH WELL UH USED TO UM WELL UH 
WHEN YOU STAY IN IT'S GOOD WHEN YOU DON'T STAY ON YOU HAVE TO REDESIGN 
THERE IS AN UH NO NEGOTIATION UH POSSIBLE IN THIS MATTER 
SO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT 
GOOD 
UM 
SO MAYBE ANNA YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PRESENTATION 
OKAY MATTHEW 
NICE UH YOU ARE HERE 
GREAT 
GREAT 
UH M MAYBE THEN YOU CAN START NOW WITH MM PRESENTING YOUR UH YOUR DESIGNS 
MM 
YOU 
UH-HUH 
YES 
OH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
EXCE EXCEPT FOR THE FOR THE SPECIAL SHAPE THE SURFING BOARD IT HAS A QUITE A A CONVENTIONAL LAYOUT OF BUTTONS UH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH NO YOU CAN CARRY ON I JUST 
LIKE HOW IT FEELS ALL 
YES IT REALLY FEELS LIKE LIKE LIKE A MOBILE PHONE 
JUST I'M I REALLY WANT TO TALK TO IT 
BUT 
SO BUT BUT CONTINUE WITH YOUR UH MM-HMM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
FROM D. V. D. PLAYER TO TELEVISION OR SOMETHING 
YES 
MM 
YES AND AND AND THEN YOU GET FEEDBACK VIA THE L. C. D. YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH BUT BUT BUT BUT UH I IN THEIR UH WHEN THIS IS CLOSED WILL IT ALSO UH COVER UP THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
BUT BUT THE L. C. D. SCREEN I MEAN IS A VERY UH 
WELL AN EYE ATTRACTING FEATURE WHICH SHOULDN'T BE SHOULDN'T BE 
THAT TH THAT'S TRUE 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES 
YES MORE ROBUST 
YES OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
BUT WE 
MM 'KAY 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL WELL 
MM 
BE BEFORE TA TALKING ABOUT THE MONEY AND WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND WHAT IS NOT POSSIBLE MAYBE ANNA YOU CAN UH GIVE OUR UH GIVE US YOUR UM 
YES 
EVALUA EVALUATION AND ALSO THE EVALUATION CRITERIA IS WHAT WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT 
MM-HMM 
WELL JUST 
DO IT QUICKLY IF IF WE AL ALREADY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UM NO NO WHY NOT WHY NOT DISCUSS UH DISCUSS IT NOW 
MM WELL MY MY PERSONAL VIEW IS UH W WHEN WHEN THIS ONE IS EIGHT EUROS WE MUST THINK HOW CAN WE IMPROVE IT 
AND THEN I MEAN W W W YOU MUST JUST USE IT WE CAN STILL SPEND THIS FOR AND A HALF EURO AND 
IT OR BECAUSE THE THE THE THE THE SELLING PRICE IS ALREADY PRITE FIK UH UH QUITE FIXED ON TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
SO WE JUST HAVE TO OFFER AS MUCH AS AS WELL VALUE FOR THE FOR THE CUSTOMER UH UH CAN HAVE FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO 
MM 
UM WELL WE WE WE CAN STILL DISCUSS THAT 
SO UM 
AND TOGETHER WITH EVALUATING THIS UH WE WE MIGHT COME WITH NEW IDEAS I MEAN ADDING THINGS ARE UH REMOVING UH OF OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO EXPENSIVE BUT 
UM 
I'VE RECEIVED UH A FRAMEWORK WHICH WE CAN DO THIS 
I MEAN DID YOU HAVE THIS THIS EXCEL SHEET 
NO OKAY THIS IS THESE ARE THE THE THE LATEST PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTION UH UH PRODUCTION UNIT FOR SEVERAL COMPONENTS 
SO WE CAN UH IS WHETHER THE THE PRICE IS IS WITHIN THE TWELVE EURO UH FIFTY CENTS UH 
SO MAYBE WE CAN START WITH THIS UH CALLING THIS ONE 
TH TH THIS IS THE FIRST DESIGN 
YES 
OH THERE IS ANOTHER PEN 
OKAY 
'KAY 
OKAY 
SO 
LIKE AND FEEL 
WELL YOU ALREADY FEEL THAT UH PRETTY MUCH I THINK 
NO I IN MY OPINION 
PURELY FEEL IS IS IS VERY GOOD IS VERY GOOD IN YOUR HAND SO I I I WOULD CONSIDER TWO OR OR MAY MAYBE EVEN IN FOR FEEL 
BUT THAT'S JUST HALF WE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER LOOK AND THEN 
I IT LOOKS 
QUITE CONVENTIONAL 
DON'T YOU AGREE 
SO MAYBE TWO 
HMM 
HMM 
UM M M M MAYBE SAY SAY FIVE 
I IT'S MY OPINION BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT 
FOR FOR 
NOW WE TH TH THEN WE SETTLE ON FOR 
'KAY 
CAN YOU MAYBE FIX THE OTHER 
MM TRY TO JUST TRY TO 
UH IT WILL NOT OR MM MM 
YES IT IT HAS A MM 
GOOD 
GOOD 
OKAY 
SO THEN THEN 
OH 
MM 
I I 
I 
WHEN WE WANT TO INCLUDE I I I'M DOUBTING ABOUT THIS THIS COMPONENT 
IT IT IT IT BREAKS IN YOUR 
MM YES I SEE MM OKAY 
WELL OR OR 
MM 
I THINK THE LIKE IS BETTER BUT THE FILE IS IS IS WORSE 
SO SO I WOULD ALSO SAY THIS IS FOR 
BUT WE WE DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK 
MM 
MM 
YES 
YES IT BASICALLY IS THE SAME SHAPE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES OKAY 
TWO 
MM 
TWO'S GOOD YES 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THE ONLY INNOVA INNOVATION IS THE SHAPE 
SO SO THAT 
YES 
A AND THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS 
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WELL IT'S QUITE INNOVATIVE 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
WE JUST DISKE DISCUSS IT AS YOU DESIGNED IT AND THEN WE WILL WILL TRY TO GET IT IN THE BUDGET 
EIGHT 
YES 
TWO 
WHY IT IS NO 
A MENU W W 
YES 
THIS THIS IS IT W WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
WELL 
GI GIVEN THAT THAT IT WORKS THEN IT'S I THINK ONE 
MM 
HMM 
THERE I WOULD 
THERE 
NO 
YEAH 
YES BUT THEN WHEN WHEN HE IS USED TO IT I I IT IS QUITE EASY 
SO SO I THINK TH THERE IS GOOD 
YEAH 
GOOD 
WHAT'S THE NEXT 
SO 
TWO TWENTY TO FORTY YES THAT'S 
MM-HMM 
WELL EXCE EXCEPT FOR THE SURFING SHAPE 
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH WHICH HAS AN APPLE ON THIS GROUP I THINK ABOUT 
MM W W W W AFTER THIS WE CAN CAN CONSIDER UH FOR INSTANCE MAKING THIS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO TO THE DEMOGRAPHIC 
MM 
BUT IS IT IS NOW I WOU WOULD SAY 
MM SIX SOMETHING 
DO YOU AGREE 
MM YEAH INDEED 
THE IT IT 
JU JUST THINK TWENTY FIVE EUROS I MEAN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE CHEAPER 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH THA THA THA THA THA THAT'S I THINK IT'S BETTER BECAUSE OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN WHICH IS REALLY AN APPLE ON THE ON THE ON THE 
IN THE END ON THE 
MM 
SO THE L. C. D. SCREEN UH ATTRACTS YES 
BECAUSE IT 
MM UM MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER YES SO 
WHA WHAT WHAT 
ONE IS EASY TO TWO 
TWO 
OKAY THE FINAL POINT TRENDS 
MM 
MM 
I THINK 
MM 
MM 
AND THE THEN WE CAN AL YES 
WE CAN WE CAN CONSIDER UH UH IS IT POSSIBLE DO YOU THINK IT TO MAKE A COVER 
FAR AS SUCH A PHONE 
I MEAN 
WELL JUST WITH THE WITH THE FLEXIBLE PLASTIC UH 
I TH I TH I THINK 
O O OR JUST TWO THINGS WHICH CAN BE PUT IN EACH OTHER 
YES EXACTLY LIKE IT 
UH SO 
MAYBE WE CAN BUT WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO WE CAN PUT THE THE THE FANCY F LOOK OF VEGETABLES FOR INSTANCE 
IT TO THOSE COVERS AND SO NOW TRY TO INVEST IN THE IN IN THE FEATURES 
MM 
MM MM MM MM MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
YES 
SO SO SO THAT THAT WOULD MAKE THE TRENDS EQUAL SO WE WE WE REALLY HAVE DON'T HAVE 
I MEAN 
MM 
YES INDEED 
YES 
SAY SAY ONE AND TWO 
NO NEED TWO 
SO LE LE LET'S SEE 
SO DO THIS ONE HAS SPONGY BUT BUTTONS 
MM I SEE YES OKAY 
GOOD 
JUST ADD IT 
YOU KNOW 
THREE SIX SEVEN 
MM-HMM 
WE WE MUST TRY TO GET THEM CLOSER 
BOTH NO I I ARE WE JUST HAVE TO CHOOSE 
AND ADAPT 
BECAUSE 
WHEN WE CHOOSE FOR THIS ONE WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE AND W WHEN WE TO DO FOR THIS ONE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT MORE CHEAP 
YES WELL 
BUT I'M NOW DID YOU DID YOU WORK WITH THE SAME PRICES THAT I HAVE HERE 
MM 
MM THE 
WELL YES WELL UH RE RECONSIDER IT 
SO LET'S LET'S TRY TO TO MODEL THIS THIS PHONE IN THIS SHOT UH WHAT KIND OF ENERGY SOURCE UH I I WE DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT THAT 
IT'S A IT'S A NORMAL BATTERY OR 
YES 
JUST USE ONE BATTERY 
'KAY 
ELECTRONICS 
GIVEN SPEECH RECOGNITION I THINK WE YOU SHOULD GO FOR THE LESS FANCY CHIP 
YEAH YES OR SAMPLE SENSOR YES 
YES THIS ONE 
OKAY 
CASE 
UM 
I SEE I 
DOUBLE CURVE 
MM 
OH YES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME SHAPE BUT ACTUALLY BE 
SO TH TH THIS WOULD BE DOUBLE CURVES 
'KAY 
UH PLASTIC WOULD BE THE MATERIAL 
UH SPECIAL COLOUR NOW WE LEAVE IT AT THE COVERS 
PUSH 
MM YES BUT 
YEAH THE NEW THIS IS PER PER UNIT THIS NUMBER OF COMPONENTS 
SO ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE OUT 
YES 
TWELVE I BELIEVE 
SO THIS COMES TO EIGHTEEN 
SO 
SO I THINK ABOUT THE DO YOU AGREE TH THAT THE 
YES I 
YES I'M I'M NO I'M NO I'M NOT SH 
SURE 
YES I KNO UNDES I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN YES 
UH-HUH 
BOTH 
YES 
OH 
WE DO WE HAVE WE HAVEN'T TALK ABOUT A BUT THAT'S IN A IS VERY EXP INEXPENSIVE I BELIEVE BUT IT IS NOT IN THE LAST 
WE UH UH SO THIS A SCROLL WHEEL OR IS THIS A A A SORT OF BUTTON WHICH CAN BE PRESSED IN TWO SIDES UH SO FOR HIGHER AND LOWER 
MM 
MM-HMM 
SO UM 
WE'RE 
WE 
WE COULD GO FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE FOR A SIMPLE CHIP BUT THEN WE CAN'T HAVE THE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION YES 
YES 
SO SO W WHEN WE W A THIS WOULD THIS WOULD BE CUTTING THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
TRANSTI 
SAY SAY IT'S REGULAR REGULAR CHIP AND WE STILL ON FIFTEEN SO 
YES BUT THAT MAYBE 
WELL WE CAN JUST SAY 
NO 
CA L WE ARE JUST WHEN WE JUST WANT TO UH TO CUT THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS WE HAVE TO MAKE SEVEN TO TO FIT IN IN TWELVE TWELVE FIFTY 
SO SO IT POSSIBLE 
MM-HMM 
NO NO UH UH UH I I 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OTHERWISE YOU YOU UH YOU HAVE A S VE VERY NORMAL UH THING LIKE THIS 
MM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
A 
MM 
MM 
I 
I THINK WE HAVE TO COME TO A DECISION NOW JUST I I THINK WE W WHAT WE JUST DO I SEE VOTE 
BUT THE UH THE L. C. D. UH DISPLAY SO 
YES 
YES 
YES 
NO MENU ON VOTE 
SO SO WHO THINKS THE THE L. C. D. DISPLY DISPLAY SHOULD BE I SHOULD BE ON IT 
MM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM I KNOW BUT 
YES 
SO UH UH HAVING AN L. C. D. S DISPLAY IS JUST UH UH HAVE VERY VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF BUTTONS 
SO THAT ACCEPTABLE 
CA CAN I HAVE CON THE FUNCTIONS BE IMPLEMENT IN ONE 
YOU'VE YOU YOU AGREE 
SO HAV HAV HAVING SEVEN BUTTONS INSTEAD OF TWELVE 
SO THAT WE WOULD BE CUTTING CUTTING SUH SAY ABOUT THESE BUTTONS 
MM 
MM 
SO UM I I THINK WE SHOULD WE SHOULD CUT THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
THAT THAT'S THAT'S MY OPINION 
JUST 
UH WHERE L. C. 
OKAY WE WE NOW WE CAN JUST UH 
YES 
YES 
I TH I TH I THINK WE WE JUST GO FOR THIS ONE AND THAT THAT NOW TWELVE EUROS IS THE 
SO SO THE PRICE OKAY 
MY M MY SUPERVISOR WILL BE GLAD THAT IT'S FIFTY CENTS CHEAPER THAN HE EXPECTED 
OKAY 
OKAY GOOD 
THEN WE THE SAME 
THANK YOU 
THAT WAS IT 
OKAY OH SORRY 
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE A LITTLE BIT UM 
THIS 
SORRY TO UH 
SO IT BEAUTIFUL 
DO YOU KNOW 
IT'S A CAT 
ISN'T IT 
YES YES SO IT LIKE THAT 
SO IT BETTER 
OKAY 
IT'S MY CAT 
YEAH 
THE NAME IS CARAMEL 
YEAH 
THANK YOU 
HOW DO YOU WERE THIS THING 
NOT TOO MANY CABLES AND STUFF 
ORIGINAL 
OH 
JUST ONE THING 
UH YOU SAID TWENTY FIVE MINUTES BUT I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO UH 
SO GOTTA HAVE ANOTHER MEETING UH SOON AS MAYBE YOU COULD HURRY UP A BIT 
IT'S TRUE 
I HAVE ANOTHER MEETING SO IF YOU COULD UH 
YEAH 
YEAH FOR THE LAWNMOWER PROJECT 
OKAY 
WHAT AN ORIGINAL IDEA 
ORANGUTAN 
CAN I GIVE YOU THE ONE 
BUT I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING 
WHEN I'M DRAWING THE ORANGUTAN 
IT'S AN ABSTRACT DRAWING OF AN ORANGUTAN 
YES 
I DON'T HAVE A RED COLOUR 
USUALLY ORANGUTANS HAVE RED HAIR SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BUT I DON'T HAVE RED PEN IS 
YES 
YES 
I KNOW 
WHA WHAT IS THIS STRANGE BEAST 
SO IT A MONSTER 
IT'S A CAT 
I THOUGHT THESE THINGS DID NOT EXIST 
OH YEAH 
DOES HAVE A NAME 
CARAMEL 
UH UH 
NEXT TIME I CONCENTRATE 
UH LOOKS LIKE A BONG 
OKAY 
SORRY 
NO 
SCARY 
I I THINK WE WILL BE FINISHED THIS UH 
SO IT FOR UH FOR PUTTING A FOR LOGOS NO 
THAT'S 
I SEE THERE A MATTER FOR A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IT UH A SINGLE DEVICE REMOTE CONTROL OR IS IT A MULTI DEVICE REMOTE CONTROL 
UH THIS IS NOT DEFINED AT ALL 
OH OKAY 
WELL UH DO WE SELL THEIR STUFF 
UH IF IF WE BUNDLE THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH SOMETHING UH TO SELL THEN IT COULD BE A SINGLE DEVICE 
OTHERWISE IT COULD BE PROGRAMMABLE ONE OTHERWISE WHO WOULD BUY A REMOTE CONTROL FROM US 
YEAH 
NO I COULDN I CANNOT FI THINK OF ANY REQUIREMENTS RIGHT NOW 
MM 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT LEAST FITS IN YOUR HAND 
YEAH 
THE BASIC REQUIREMENT 
ONLY A BACK 
WATERPROOF 
MM 
B IT SEEMS UH SO 
BUT UH IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN WATERPROOF REMOTE CONTROL IT MEANS YOU CAN JUST COVER IT WITH SOME PLASTIC AND YOU CAN SORT OF OF 
AND 
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THAT'S ONE OF THE SHOCK I MEAN THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL AND THEY ARE WORRIED THAT IT'S GOING TO BREAK AND THEY PUT SOME EXTRA PLASTIC AROUND IT 
THAT'S PEOPLE THEY ACTUALLY DO IT THEMSELVES 
I IT WILL LIKE A BULKY IN THAT CASE 
LIKE AS AN OPTIONAL THING 
BARKS 
THAT'S THAT'S QUITE COOL BUT UH OF COURSE WE YOU DON'T NORMALLY AND UH ANY IDEA UH RECORDING STUFF ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT 
SO I IT'S JUST GOING TO ADD TO TO THE COST 
IT'S COOL 
I THINK I LIKE THE IDEA BUT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE WHAT YOU WHO IS GIVING WHO'S GIVING WHO'S GIVING OUR BUDGET 
WHO'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
'KAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
GOOD 
UH SO WE COME BACK IN FIVE MINUTES 
HALF AN HOUR 
NO NO NO 
YOU SHOULD WRITE YOU THE NAME I THINK 
UM UH YEAH 
YEAH 
CARAMEL 
AND YOU I THINK I'M TOO SHORT FOR THE CABLES 
QUITE SQUAREY 
UH ALSO 
MM 
MM-HMM 
I THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TOO MANY B FOR MY PART 
I THINK 
IF WE DON'T HAVE SO MANY BUTTONS COULD BE NICE 
YEAH 
SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT SQUAREY MAYBE UH NOT A BOX 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
AND I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A DEVICE 
SORRY 
YEAH 
DIRECTLY 
YEAH 
AND I I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING MOST OF THE TIME I I ALSO MY REMOTE CONTROL 
WE SHOULD HAVE IS UH SPECIAL BU BUTTON ON THE T. V. TO MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL BEEPING 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
BARKS 
YEAH 
YEAH WHISTLE 
WHISTLE TRACKING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
DON'T PANIC 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OH 
HMM 
MM MM MM 
IS RECORDED 
OKAY 
OKAY SO WELCOME EVERYONE 
SO WE ARE HERE FOR THE KICKOFF MEETING OF UH THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
SO I WILL FIRST START WITH A WARM WELCOME OPENING STUFF 
THEN UH WE WILL UH SO WHAT WILL BE UH OUR PRODUCT AND WHAT WILL BE THE DIFFERENT STEP WE WILL HAVE TO DESIGN IT 
AND UH THEN WE WILL UH DISCUSS IF WE HAVE FEW IDEAS AND WE WILL UH AND UH BY UH DISPATCHING THE DIFFERENT TASK YOU WILL BE YOU WILL HAVE TO FULFIL TO COMPLETE THIS PROCESS 
SO 
SORRY 
YOU HAVE ANOTHER MEETING SOON 
SO YOU HAVE TO BE QUICK 
OKAY 
SO THE THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL IS TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER OUR COMPETITORS WE HAVE TO BE ORIGINAL 
WE HAVE TO BE TRENDY AND WE HAVE TO ALSO TRY TO BE USER FRIENDLY 
SO UH THE DESIGN STEP WILL BE DIVIDED IN THEIR UH MAIN POINTS 
FIRST IT WILL BE THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 
THIRD IS THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THEN USE THE DESIRED DESIGN 
SO THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IS TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN USER NEEDS THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD FULFIL 
AND THEN WE WILL MOVE TO F CONCEPTUAL DESIGN WHERE WE'LL SPECIFY THE DIFFERENT COMPONENT INVOLVED 
WHAT KIND OF USER INTERF INTERFACE WE WANT AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT UH TURNED ON USER INTERFACE AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
AND THEN THE DESIRED DEVI DESIGN WILL CONSIST IN UH SPECIFICALLY IMPLEMENTING AND DETAILING THE CHOICE WE'VE UH MADE IN THE SECOND POINT 
SO I WILL NOW ASK YOU WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE DESIGN OF A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR IT UH EACH OF US TO TO DRAW UH YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL ON THE WHITE BOARD 
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHICH ANIMAL YOU WANT TO SHOW US 
OKAY THAT'S GOOD 
NO NO 
YOU SHOULD 
IF YOU WANT TO REACT UH ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL DRAWING UH I'LL LET YOU UH COMMENT 
OKAY IT'S AN ABSTRACT DRAWING 
I THINK IT'S NICE AND ORIGINAL 
OKAY 
YOU WANT TO DRAW SOMETHING CHRISTINE 
OF COURSE YOUR ANIMAL IS RECORDED SO IT'S NOT LOST 
SO THIS UH 
OH OKAY IT'S PRETTY 
OKAY IT'S YOUR CAT 
OKAY 
OLIVIER DO YOU WANT IT 
OKAY I GO ABOUT NEXT TIME YOU'LL DO SOMETHING I'M SURE 
I'M A BIT SHORT ONE CABLE 
OKAY 
SO WHAT COULD I DRAW 
MAYBE I CAN DRAW LIKE 
A VERY SIMPLIFIED COW 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT LOOKS LIKE A COW 
LIKE A WHITE 
I DUNNO IT IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A DONKEY IN FACT I WOULD SAY 
OKAY SO I HOPE THAT IT HELPS YOU UH IN THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
LET'S MOVE ON 
SO 
HERE THE UH FINANCIAL OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROJECT 
THAT IS IT EASY TO TO HAVE A PRODUCTION COST LOWER THAN TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS AND HAVE A SELLING PRICE OF TWICE THAT PRICE IT IN ORDER TO TARGET A PROFE PROFIT OF UH FIFTY UH MILLION EUROS 
YEAH IF IT'S TRENDY ORIGINAL I D FULFIL THE USER NEEDS 
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THAT POINT 
NO YEAH YOU YOU CAN SUGGEST POINTS LIKE THIS 
SO WHAT WHAT IS WE HAVE TO DECIDE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT CAN CONTROL ONE DEVICE OR MULTIPLE 
SO WHAT'S WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THAT 
MAYBE I CAN HAVE THE YOUR OPINION FROM THE MARKETING SIDE 
OKAY SO IF IT SELLED UH BY ITS OWN I IT IT WOULD RATHER BE FOR MULTIPLE DEVICE 
DO YOU AGREE 
YEAH 
SO MAYBE IT SHOULD BE FOR MULTIPLE DEVICES 
AND UH DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS UM IF UH DESIGN IDEAS OR ANY UH UH TECHNICAL REQUIREMENT WE WE SHOULD UH FULFIL 
FEW BUTTONS 
OKAY 
AND DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE IT BE TO BE LIGHTED IN ORDER TO BE USED IN THE DARK 
MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA 
OKAY 
AND DO YOU HAVE ANY UM ANY UH IDEA OF THE TREND THE TREND IN DOMAIN WHAT IT SHOULDN'T IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE OR THINGS LIKE THAT 
WITH ROU OKAY 
LIKE FOR OKAY 
OKAY 
SO 
FIT IN YOUR HAND YEAH 
AND ALSO TO HAVE I IT MAY BE IT MAY BE IMPORTANT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO BE UH 
IT TO RESIST TO VARIOUS SHOCKS THAT CAN HAPPEN IF IT FELL 
WATER PROOF AS WELL 
MAYBE IT IS ORIGINAL BECAUSE YOU CAN UH IS IT IN YOUR UH IN YOUR BATH WHEREAS THE OTHERS CAN'T 
MAYBE WATER PROOF WOULD BE VERY ORIGINAL 
HAVIN HAVING A WATER PROOF REMOTE CONTROL IS THAT THE PEOPLE CAN UH IS IT IN THEIR BATH 
THAT COULD BE UH 
YEAH BUT IT IS STILL SOMETHING UH YOU HAVE TO BUY AND THAT IS UM NOT MAYBE VERY 
YEAH MAYBE 
BU 
BUT MAYBE WE CAN BULK IT WITH UH ALREADY THIS PLASTIC THING AND UH THE WATERPROOF UH STUFF AS WELL 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE CAN SELL UH ALL THAT TOGETHER IS IS PLASTIC PROTECTION 
AND UH AND A WATERPROOF BOX AS WELL 
THAT MIGHT BE GOOD UH TRACK TO FOLLOW 
OPTIONAL OR SELLED WITH IT 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE UH 
BUT WE DON'T DESIGN THE T. V. 
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE UH SOMETHING YOU WHISTLE AND UH THE REMOTE CONTROL UH BEEP 
YEAH BARKS YEAH 
SO WE CAN UH HAVE A WHISTLE UH REMOTE CONTROL 
I DON'T KNOW WHISTLE BLUE 
WHISTLE TRACKING YEAH 
WHISTLE TRACKING REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT'S VERY ORIGINAL AND THAT'S CAN UH IMPROVE 
YEAH D D UH 
YEAH BUT IS STILL WE HAVE TO MM WE HAVE TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER OUR COMPETITORS 
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD ADVANTAGE 
YEAH 
WE HAVE TO ASK 
YEAH 
WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUEST OF THAT'S UH DESIGN AT THE UH INDUSTRIAL UM DESIGNER 
WHICH IS YOU 
OKAY SO TRY TO FIND THAT FOR NEXT MEETING 
OKAY 
SO NEXT MEETING IS IN THIRTY MINUTES OR IS UH 
DON'T PANI 
SO SO I WILL ASK THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TO FIND IT MORE ABOUT THIS INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IS ANY WORKING ANY WORKING FUNCTION WE HAVE DISCUSSED 
SO THEN I WILL ASK THE USER INTERF INTERFACE DESIGNER TO TO THINK ABOUT THE POINT WE DISCUSSED LIKE THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS 
THE THE FACT THAT IS LIGHTED OR NOT THINGS LIKE THAT AND WHAT WOULD BE CONVENIENT FOR THE USER 
AND ALSO UM I WILL ASK THE MARKET EXPERT TO UH TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT ARE THE ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS 
WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED IN A REMOTE CONTROL UH FOR THE USER 
SO 
AND THEN UH I WILL UH JUST ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND UH LOOK AT YOUR EMAIL BECAUSE YOU WILL RECEIVE UH SOME GOOD ADVICE SOON 
SO 
THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S ALL FOR THIS POINT 
ANYWAY YOU WILL RECEIVE SOME MESSAGES 
BE CAREFUL 
YOU TO IT 
DOES IT MOVE UH 
OKAY BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT UH IS STILL CORRECTLY UH 
WE'LL SEE 
MM 
YEAH 
UM I DUNNO IF YOU CAN OPEN THE UH UM IS NOT HERE 
OH NO 
YEAH OKAY 
NO 
ONE DOCUMENT 
MM COMPUTER YEAH 
HERE 
HERE 
BUT IT'S NOT 
UM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I CAN DO THAT 
OKAY 
UM 
IT'S PARTICIPANT ONE 
OKAY 
YOU CAN UH 
YEAH 
OKAY SO YOU CAN YOU CAN GO 
OKAY SO IN OUR USABILITY LAB WE OBSERVED THE REMOTE CONTROL IS AMONG ONE HUNDRED SUBJECTS AND THE SUBJECTS ALSO FILLED A QUESTIONNAIRE OKAY 
AND HERE I HAVE THE RESULTS SO YOU CAN SEE THAT UM SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY SO WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING TO MAKE THEM MORE 
MORE NICE MORE KINDA 
EIGHTY PER CENTS OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY 
EIGHTY HUNDRED PER CENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LIKE UH IT IT'S NOT GOOD 
SO OKAY 
SO IT'S NOT IN THEORY BUT I I CAN I CAN SAY YEAH 
FIFTY F UH SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF USERS SAY THEY USE ZAP A LOT 
SO MM WE HAVE TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL UH VERY UM IT FOR THAT 
UH THE BUTTONS HAVE OUR TO BE UM UH UH LIKE YOU SAY RESIST RESISTING TO TO SHOCKS 
UM AND FIFTY PER CENTS OF USERS SAY THEY ONLY USE UH TEN PER CENTS OF BIT OF THE BUTTONS ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO ALL THE BUTTONS WE WE HAVE TO PUT OUR HAVE TO TO HAVE UM A AS A REAL USE AND NOT ONLY OR 
YEAH 
IF NOT MANY BUTTONS AND UH AND UH UH U USEABLE BUTTONS 
SORRY 
YEAH 
UH MOST FOR MOST IS T. V. 
'KAY YOU CAN GO SO 
SO THERE ARE OTHER FRUSTRATIONS EXPRESSED BY USERS 
SO THEY SAID UH THEY LOST UH OFTEN THE REMOTE CONTROL IN IN THE ROOM SO THEY WANT TO HAVE A WAY TO IT 
TO FIND OUT 
UM AND UM LOT OF THE TIME THEY IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
SO THEY WANT SOMETHING IS REALLY VERY SIMPLE AND UH EASY TO USE 
AND UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE BAD FOR 
R. S. I. UM 
I DUNNO 
YEAH 
OH 
OKAY UM BEFORE THAT I I HAVE SOME SOME SOME THING UH TO SAY BEFORE UM 
WE KNOW THAT UH THE USER IS UH A LOT OTHER UM REMOTE CONTROL UM TO TO CHANGE CHANNEL 
UM AND UM TO TO CHANGE UH VOLUME SELECTION OF THE AND UH AND NOT UH A LOT FOR SETTING FOR SETTING THE THE CHANNELS AND UH THING THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO IT'S BETTER TO PUT UH UH UH SOMETHING VERY EASY TO SET AND UH AND 
VERY ACCESSIBLE YES 
THAT'S RIGHT 
SO THEN WE ASKED SOME QUESTIONS TO THEM AND UM WE ASKED THIS QUESTION IF THEY PREFER AN L. C. D. SCREEN OR IN THEIR REMULTIFIC FUNCTION REMOTES CONTROL AND IF THEY MM PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN REMOTE CONTROL AND YOU CAN GO WE HAVE HERE THE RESULTS OF 
OF THE QUESTIONS 
SO YOU KNOW THAT UM 
FOR THE YOUNGER IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
TO HAVE THE SO YES AND SPEECH RECOGNITION 
AND UH AND THE OTHERS IS NOT AS IMPORTANT BUT UH WE KNOW THAT UH UH PEOPLE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE EURO PEOPLE WHO WATCH A LOT T. V. AND UH WH WH WH CAN USE A LOT THIS UH 
SO MAYBE WE WE CAN HAVE A SPEECH RECOGNITION ON 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY AND IF THERE IS THE THE CONCLUSION NOW 
SO SO WE SAY BEFORE I THINK UH UM A REMOTE CONTROL LIGHTENING IN THE DARK IT'S IT'S A GOOD THING 
UH NOT TOO MANY MUD BUTTONS LIKE WE WE SAID BEFORE 
E EASY TO USE UH A WAY TO FIND IT EASILY IN THE ROOM AND UH UH RESISTANT TO TO SHOCK AND IT IT 
NO I SEE IN YEAH 
I DUNNO IF YOU SEE SOMETHING ELSE IMPORTANT OR 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
OH 
WOULD J 
OH YEAH W I I THINK THEY THEY SAY THAT IT'S UH DIFFICULT TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT BUT I WHEN YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT 
IT'S IT'S OKAY 
BUT 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
NO 
NO NO 
I DUNNO I DUNNO IT 
'KAY THANK YOU 
HELLO 
MAKE A START YEAH 
SO 
CABLE CAMERA 
SHOULD BE IN MY IN THEIR FOLDER NO 
UP 
UM IT THERE I THINK 
NO 
MM 
DO WE THINK WE USE IN THE ON THE WRONG FOLDER MAYBE 
IT IS POSSIBLE 
IT WAS SOMEWHERE IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME ACTUALLY MUST BE SOMETHING LIKE MESSENGER AMI OR SOMETHING 
GO UP 
YEAH GO UP 
AGAIN 
NO 
GO BACK 
UH MAYBE MESSENGER AMI 
MESSENGER 
NO 
THERE IS NOTHING 
LET'S GO AND CHECK 
I'LL GO AND CHECK 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO UH 
BASICALLY WHAT WE WANT HERE IS A REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT 
SO UM THE QUESTION WELL FIRST OF ALL WHAT TO CONTROL 
SO MOST PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE A A REMOTE FOR THEIR HI FI AND T. V. AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
AND BUT OTHER PEOPLE WANT THE ALSO REMOTES FOR CONTROLLING UH AND TOYS LIKE ROBOTIC PETS AND LITTLE ROBOTS AND STUFF AND OTHER PEOPLE ALSO WANT TO HAVE REMOTES FOR CONTROLLING UM WHOLE HOUSE 
YEAH SO THERE'S A PROJECT I THINK CALLED X. HOUSE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT DOES THAT UH YOU CAN INTEGRATE YOUR REMOTE WITH UH COMPUTERS STUFF 
SO THERE IS IN THAT IS ONE THING 
TH THERE IS THE 
THE FINDER FEATURE YEAH BY WHISTLING OR WHATEVER 
UH IF YOU HAVE THE FINDER FEATURE THEN YOU CAN ALSO HAVE 
UH AT THE SAME TIME SO AND GENERAL VOICE COMMANDS IF YOU WANT YEAH 
SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE A PACKAGE IN THAT CASE 
UH IS THE USER INTERFACE WILL CONSIST OF TWO PARTS 
ONE IS THE VOICE COMMAND PART AND ONE ONE IS THE ACTUAL BUTTONS PART 
UH AND THE THE BUTTONS PART WOULD BE UH A SET OF BUTTONS FOR CHOOSING DEVICES A SET OF BUTTONS FOR SPECIAL NAVIGATION IN SPACE 
A SET OF BUTTONS FOR LINEAR ACCESS OF MEDIUM AND A SET OF BUTTONS FOR RANDOM ACCESS 
YEAH 
LIKE A VIDEO TAPE GOES FORWARD BACKWARDS UH FAST AND STUFF YEAH 
UM 
MM 
YEAH 
FOR SPECIAL NAVIGATION FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT HAVE A T. V. ON THE MENU AND YOU GOING TO CHANGE YEAH 
OH 
MM 
YEAH AND ALSO PARAMETER CHANGING 
SO IF THERE ARE COMMON PARAMETERS MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT SPECIAL BUTTONS FOR THAT UM OR MAYBE WE COULD HAVE EVERYTHING UH GENERIC BUT UH THERE ARE A LOT OF UH REMOTES ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW AND BASICALLY THIS IS MOST OF THE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS THIS STUFF 
VOICE COMMAND W WE COULD SPECIFY ANYTHING 
WE COULD ASSIGN ANY BUTTON A COMMAND TO ANY BUTTON IF WE HAVE ENOUGH PROCESSING POWER I GUESS SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YEAH I THINK SO 
NOT AS FAR 
WHERE DID YOU PUT IT 
MM 
I'M DESIGNING THE USER INTERFACE 
BUT WHAT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROLS DID YOU LOOK AT 
WHAT KIND OF TASK WAS IT 
IT WAS A T. V. 
HUH 
UH-HUH 
OH GOOD 
OTHER SIDE YEAH YOU WA YOUR WRIST 
IT I CAN BECOME PAINFUL YOU CAN HAVE TENDONDITIS 
YEAH 
IF YOU ALSO UP IN A COMPUTER IN A STRONG POSITION 
ERGONOMIC 
BUT UH 
HAVE TO SAY UH UH 
MM-HMM 
THE FIRST QUESTION 
MM 
MM 
MM I IT'S NOT TRUE I THINK 
THE THE SECOND CLAIM THAT YOU PUT 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE SAME 
I HAVE UH I'VE NO IDEA I MEAN I SHOULD KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT HOW FAST WE CAN UH DESIGN IT 
I DON'T THINK 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LIKE A YOU FEEL A BIT LIKE A DOG WITH THIS STUFF 
THIS WILL THINK THIS WILL TAKE MORE TIME TO DEVELOP ALSO 
YEAH 
SOON 
YEAH 
SO THE ONLY TIME PROBLEM IS THE SP VOICE RECOGNITION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TEN YEARS 
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO MARKET 
I THINK WE SHOULD CONTACT MANAGEMENT 
WELL 
OH 
HOW MUC HOW MUCH DO YOU GET HOW MUCH DO YOU IF YOU BUY ONE MILLION UNITS UH IN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS 
UH CHIPS 
WE'RE GONNA NEED CHIPS RIGHT 
YEAH 
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
OKAY 
SO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA FOR A POWERFUL ONE THAT HAS UH GOOD ENOUGH FOR DO SPEECH RECOGNITION 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO 
NO IT DOESN'T 
OKAY 
FOUR MILLION 
MH HMM 
A A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UH IF YOU HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN IF YOU CAN DO IT COMPLETELY THE WAY YOU WANT BECAUSE THE BUTTONS ALSO LIKE THE WAY YOU WANT THEM BUT IT WILL BE HARD TO CONFIGURE I MEAN IMAGINE I UH SO IT'S REALLY SOMETHING FOR THE EXPERT USER 
SO 
I MEAN THERE ARE MARKETS AND MARKETS 
I THINK THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THE UH OUR UH CHRISTINE HERE SAID UH YOU HAVE A UH IT IS YEAH 
SO FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE UH IT WILL BE COOL THEY CAN BE ABLE TO USE IT 
THE MAYBE THEIR PARENTS WILL NOT BUT THEY WILL CONFIGURE IT 
I GUESS 
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS STUDY ABOUT THAT 
MM 
AND THERE ARE ANOTHER THING IS THAT IF WE MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE THAT'S BAS TO USE IMMEDIATELY THAT MEANS THAT IT WILL BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVERYTHING ELSE 
ALL RIGHT 
OTHERWISE IF IT'S DIFFERENT THAN OF COURSE EVERYBODY HAS SOMEBODY HAS TO LEARN TO USE IT FIRST 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BUT TELETEXT IS JUST ONE BUTTON 
YOU YOU JUST WRITE THE WRITE THE NUMBERS 
AS WELL YOU DID WITH THE CHANNEL KEYS RIGHT 
SO 
I UM 
I'M SURE THAT UH IT DON'T LIKE BUT UH I DON'T USE JUST ONE BUTTON 
SO 
MM-HMM 
CAPITAL 
WELL IF IT IS GOING TO BE JUST A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL IT IS GOING TO BE VERY SIMPLE 
WELL IF IT'S GOING TO BE S SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE THEN JUST HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL THERE IS IN THEIR FUNCTION THAT I CAN SEE 
REALLY 
OH NO YOU WANT TO KEEP TELEVISION ONE IS THAT THE ADVERTISING CAN REVENUE CAN COME BACK TO USE 
OR SOMETHING 
IT'S A MEMORY YEAH 
AND UH AND OF COURSE THE CHANNEL CHANGING BUTTONS 
HOW SHOULD THEY HOW SHOULD WE IMPLEMENT THAT 
BECAUSE UH COULD BE NUMERICAL ONLY OR COULD BE ALSO INCREMENTAL 
MM-HMM 
MM 
IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA THAT IF YOU PRESS IT FOR A LONG TIME IT DOES SOMETHING ELSE IN GENERAL 
SO IF YOU YOU HAVE YOUR TEN BUTTONS FOR THE FOR THE NUMERIC THE NUMERICAL BUTTONS AND YOU HAVE INSTEAD OF HAVING JUST IN MEMORY 
YOU HAVE IF YOU PRESS THEM FOR A LONG TIME 
NO 
DOESN'T WORK DOES IT 
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A COMPLETE KEYBOARD AND JUST TYPE CONSOLE COMMANDS 
CHANGE CHANNEL TO EIGHT 
NO 
WELL IF IT'S USEFUL LIKE IF IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE BETWEEN THREE CHANNELS FOR EXAMPLE THEN YOU UH YOU CANNOT YOU CANNOT CANNOT WORK WITH JUST MEMORY BEING INCREMENTAL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WHEN YOU ZAP USUALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO PRESS THE SAME BUTTON ALL THE TIME AND 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HEY I JUST THOUGHT THIS THING THERE IS A I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE IS ARE SOME WITH A WHOLE LIKE THIS 
INSTEAD OF HAVING THE UP DOWN BUTTONS FOR UH YOU CAN HAVE THE WHOLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
IN THE LOWER SIDE I THINK IT YOU HAVE TO TURN IT 
NO 
IF WE DO THAT 
YEAH 
BECAUSE OF THAT 
BECAUSE IT'S UH IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE A VOLUME WHICH IS SMOOTH YEAH 
THE CHANNELS CHANGE ONE BY ONE 
SO YOU HAVE TO THE USER HAS TO LOOK IT SHOULD FEEL THE THE THE DISCRETE SENSE A BIT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
EVEN IF I L. E. D. UH OR A IF IF IT'S THE L. C. D. FEATURE UH WHATEVER YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S ONLY PUT ONE OF C HAVE MULTI FUNCTION 
IF YOU DO NOT MULTI FUNCTION THEN THERE IS IN P POINT IN HAVING L. C. D. 
JUST INCREASE THE COST 
THE USER DOES NOT HAVE AN ADVANTAGE REALLY 
WELL IF IT'S GOING TO DELAY YEAH BUT UH IT WILL BE COOL 
IT WOULD 
BECAUSE A USER COULD SAY C. N. N. FOR EXAMPLE AND IT WOULD GO C. N. N. 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT IS THE FOLDER THAT YOU PUT YOURS IN 
AND DID IT IT DID WORK 
OH YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY WHAT IS YOUR EMAIL 
AT PARTICIPANT ONE 
OKAY 
WELL DURING LUNCH BREAK ACTUALLY 
SO NEXT TIME WE SHOULD HAVE A FIGHT 
HOW ABOUT UH MANAGEMENT OR SOMETHING 
WHO HAPPENS TO BE YOUR FRIEND 
OKAY 
IF DO YOU WANT TO START 
OKAY 
NO 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AN SHORT CUT 
PARTICIPANT TWO 
YEAH 
OTHERWISE COULD YOU JUST DESCRIBE 
BY HAND 
WITH THE THE WHITEBOARD 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY LINEAR ACCESS THEN 
OH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I'M JUST THINKING OF SOME THING 
UM 
WE WANT TO HAVE A ONE I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A GOOD IDEA 
WE WANT TO HAVE A A GENERAL REMOTE CONTROL FOR EVERYTHING 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
NO NO 
FINISH TONIGHT 
BUT BASICALLY YEAH MAYBE I CAN CONTINUE WITH MY PRESENTATION IT WOULD BE AL YOU YOU BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME TECHNICAL PROBLEM OR SO 
SO I'M JUST GOING TO DESCRIBE BRIEFLY WHAT WE DO IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IF FACT 
YEAH BUT 
DO I HAVE UH YEAH 
NOW I HAVE ENOUGH CABLES 
OKAY SO I'M JUST GOING TO DESCRIBE IN FACT FOR FOR A REMOTE CONTROL THIS IS QUITE EASY 
WE JUST HAVE SORRY I'M GOING 
LIKE THAT 
I'M JUST GOING TO DESCRIBE 
BASICALLY WE HAVE A A BATTERY A POWER SUPPLY HERE 
AFTER THAT WE JUST HAVE UM USER INTERFACE 
LET'S SAY THAT 
UM 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH COULD BE UM A L. C. D. LET'S SAY OR UM AN ARRAY OF PUSH BUTTON SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
PUSH BUTTON OR A L. C. D. 
AFTER THAT WE WE FEED THAT INTO UM 
UH AN ELECTRONIC CHIP 
SO I SAY U. C. AND I FEED THAT IT UH L. E. D. WHICH IS UH INFRARED UM WHICH IS A AN INFRARED UM COMPONENT 
AND SO WHAT WE FOR FOR MYSELF THIS FOR FOR US THIS IS QUITE EASY 
YEAH 
Y IT'S A IT'S THIS JUST A CHIP WHICH DOES ALL THE UM NUMERICAL 
NUMERICAL COMPUTATION ACCORDING TO YOUR DISPLAY 
AND SO FAR AS UH THIS IS QUITE EASY 
WE JUST NEED TO TAKE TO DEFINE WHAT WE WANT TO DO WHEN THE USER INTERFACE UM WANTS SOMETHING AND AFTER THAT WE JUST DO THE CODING TO USE AND SEND THAT IT TO TO THE INTO THE AT THE TELEVISION 
SO FAR AS THIS IS QUITE EASY 
YEAH 
UM WE JUST HAVE TO DEFINE THE PROCESSING POWER THAT WE NEED UH ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT TO DO SOME UH SPEECH RECOGNITION 
NO THAT CASE THAT MEAN THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE MORE FOR SIMPLE 
YEAH OF COURSE OF COURSE 
AND UM BUT FOR A STANDARD IN THIS IS REALLY EASY 
IT'S A QUESTION OF ONE MONTH AND SO ONE IS 
NO NO NO NO I SAY YEAH STANDARD UH STANDARD REMOTE CONTROL TAKES MAYBE UH ONE MONTH TO TO DO THAT 
YEAH 
DEFINITELY 
I WOULD SAY 
I WOULD SAY UH ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS TO HAVE THE FIRST RESULTS 
YEAH 
I CAN 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH EVEN 
I MEAN THAT THIS IS REALLY STANDARD DEVICES NOW 
UM EIGHT 
FOR UH SPEECH RECOGNITION 
AND ALSO HOW MUCH UH I THINK 
DURING THE KICKOFF MEETING YOU SAY THAT WE WE SHOULDN'T WE SHOULDN'T GO UP TO TWELVE POINT FIVE EURO PER UNIT IS HOW MANY UNITS SHOULD WE SELL TO HAVE A 
YEAH BUT HOW MANY YEAH 
YEAH 
USUALLY THIS IS LESS THE T TWO DOLLARS PER CHIP 
YEAH WE CAN 
MM-HMM 
UM 
I JUST HAD A QUESTION UH DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WITH YOUR PRESENTA 
SO IT 
UM YOU SAY THAT I DON'T REMEMBER BY HEART BUT THIRTY PER CENT 
OF THE TESTED PEOPLE SAY THAT'S IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO TO TO USE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
DO THEY SAY THAT THIS IS DIFFICULT BUT FOR THE SAME REASON OR DO THEY HAVE OTHER REASON 
IT IT MAYBE TO KEEP IN MIND MAYBE TO ACCESS TO THAT MEAN YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND 
BUT YEAH MAYBE AND WHAT ABOUT IF WE DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH CAN BE CONFIGURE AS YOU WANT 
YOU SAY THAT I WANT I HAVE SIX BUTTON 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
UH I KNOW THAT SOME YOU SAY THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE DOING PLENTY OF A LOT OF ZAPPING 
I KNOW TH I DISCOVERED THAT WHEN I DID A QUICK LOOK UH THEY DO NOW SOM THEY DO SOMETHING WHICH IS QUITE NICE NOW 
YOU HAVE A BUTTON YOU YOU PRESS IT AND THIS IS UH THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL WHICH HAS COME BACK 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
LET'S SAY THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THIS IS UH INCREMENTAL BUT ONCE YOU PRESS IT FOR A LONG TIME YOU GO FIVE BY FIVE 
TO GO F TO GO FASTER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
ARE WE CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WE CAN DESIGN THE REMOTE CONTROL TO HAVE ACCESS 
YOU KNOW SOME REMOTE CONTROL HAVE UH PROTECTION AND SO Y Y YOU 
YOU 
YEAH A KIND OF JOYSTICK 
MM-HMM 
OR A OR A BALL YEAH NOT A A WHOLE ABOUT A BALL AND YOU SAY UH IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH TH YEAH 
'S QUITE IT'S QUITE EASY WE DO THAT W WITH BACK LIGHT ON THE ON THE WHOLE 
A BLUE A BLUE L. E. D. AND WE SELL THAT UM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
TEN YEARS 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY EVERYONE'S READY 
SO WE ARE HERE FOR UH FOR UH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 
OKAY 
SO WE ARE HERE FOR THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING MM SO FIRST I WILL SHOW THE AGENDA IS 
WE WILL UH I WILL TAKE NOTES DURING THIS MEETING SO 
I WILL TRY TO SUMMARISE IT AND PUT THAT SUMMARY ON THE SHARED FOLDER IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT AFTERWARDS 
SO THEN UH EACH OF YOU WILL UH LOAD A PRESENTATION ON THE TASK THAT HAS BEEN REQUIRED LAST TIME IS USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION 
TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN AND WORKING DESIGN 
THEN I WILL UH PRESENT YOU SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS I RECEIVED FROM UH THE MANAGEMENT BOARD 
THEN WE WILL TAKE UH THE DECISION ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL UH NEEDED FUNCTIONS 
AND THEN I WILL ASSIGN YOU THE TASK FOR THE NEXT PART OF THE MEETING 
OF THE OF THE PROCESS 
SO UH WHO WANT TO START THE THE PRESENTATION OF WHAT THEY DID 
YOU CAN START 
YOU HAVE UH POWERPOINT 
OH YEAH MAYBE THERE 
OKAY 
WHO ARE YOU 
OUCH 
AND 
WE HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM UH 
YOU PUT IT IN 
YEAH 
YOU HAVE NO 
OVER 
OKAY 
THERE'S NO 
WE HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM 
IF YOU REMEMBER YEAH BUT THAT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY SO SPECIAL NAVIGATION LINEAR ACCESS RANDOM ACCESS AND THERE'S A FOURTH ONE ONE 
SO THE BETTER NOW FOR SPECIAL NAVIGATION 
OKAY 
THEN LINEAR ACCESS THEN RANDOM ACCESS 
OH YEAH PARAMETER OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY AND AND VOICE COMMAND DID YOU UH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO THAT'S UH THAT CLOSE YOUR INVESTIGATIONS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE USER REQUIREMENTS WITH 
I DUNNO IF I CAN OPEN IT 
MAYBE YOU CAN SEE 
IT'S 
MESSENGER NO 
IN WHICH FOLDER 
SHORT CUT AT AMI SHARED FOLDER 
MAYBE YOU CAN SEND IT TO ME BY EMAIL 
JUST TO PARTICIPANT ONE 
IT UM 
I WILL TRY TO SHOW IT TO EVERYONE THAT WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE 
YOU SEND IT 
YEAH 
UH THIS IS THIS EMAIL 
OKAY 
SO MAYBE I CAN SWITCH SLIDES WHEN YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK THAT WILL BE MORE CONVENIENT 
SO OKAY FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
MM 
YEAH 
WE CAN JUST KEEP DOING THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO FEWER BUTTONS MAYBE WOULD BE GOOD 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT IN FACT W IT IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL ACCORDING TO NEW REQUIREMENTS I RECEIVED FROM THE MANAGEMENT BO I WILL PRESENT THEM IN THE FOLLOWING 
OKAY 
YEAH 
TO FIND OUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WHAT IS HER OTHER SIDE 
OH YEAH 
I DID NOT KNOW THAT 
OKAY SO YOU WE HAVE TO MAKE IT UH MORE ERGONOMIC YEAH 
IT'S YOUR JOB OH 
OH SORRY GOT A MESSAGE FROM MICROSOFT 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE VERY UH ACCESSIBLE 
YEAH OKAY 
THIS IS THE MAIN FUNCTION OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TO HAVE L. C. D. AND VOICE 
OKAY 
YEAH MAYBE THIS THIS IS IMPORTANT 
MOREOVER TH MAYBE THIS UH LIKE THOSE TEENAGER CUSTOMER COULD ADVICE THEIR PARENTS TO BUY THIS EQUIPMENT AND SO WE CAN WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT POINT OF VIEW I THINK OR SO 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY THESE ARE THE USER REQUI 
YEAH 
NO NO NO 
W W IT SEEMS THAT WE N WANT TO HAVE A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL 
FROM THE MANAGEMENT BOARD I RECEIVE AN EMAIL 
CASE IT WOULD BE COSTLY 
UH AND AND ALSO IT IT WOULD TAKE MORE TIME TO DEVELOP TO HAVE A A GENERAL GENERIC REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT IT WOULD BE TOO LONG TO DEVELOP 
OH YEAH 
BECAUSE I RECEIVED THAT EMAIL FROM MANAGEMENT BOARD AND THEY SEEMS TO TELL THAT THAT IF WE WANT TO BE IN THE MARKET AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE WE SHOULD UH FOCUS ON T. V. MORE WHERE IT SEEMS THAT THE MARKET IS MORE IMPORTANT 
SO MAYBE IT'S A GOOD DECISION 
I DUNNO 
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION 
OKAY 
MAYBE YOU CAN GO TO THE WHITEBOARD IF YOU HAVE SOME DRAWINGS TO DO I DON'T KNOW 
OKAY 
OR YOU OKAY 
I. C. S THE CENTRAL UNIT 
OKAY YEAH 
COMPUTATION 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO THIS IS QUITE EASY 
THERE IS NOT THAT MUCH CONSTRAINTS 
TO HAVE A YOU SEE YOU SPEAK ABOUT WITH VOI VOICE CONTROL 
STANDARD BUTTON ON 
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION NOW 
OKAY SO I IT'S A BIT LONG YEAH 
ONE MONTH FOR THE STANDARD ONE WITH BUTTON 
EVEN IF WE HAVE A L. C. D. DISPLAY 
OKAY YEAH 
OKAY SO WE CAN TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT 
SO WHO THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GO FOR UH LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
YEAH IT WILL 
EUROS 
YEAH YEAH 
WELL EACH UNIT IS IS SELL UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
BECAUSE WE ARE 
IT SEEMS THAT THAT WE WANT TO SELL LIKE FOUR MILLION UNITS FROM THE FIRST MEETING 
OKAY 
MAYBE WE CAN UH WE CAN LOOK AT THE NEW REQUIREMENT I RECEIVE FROM THE MANAGEMENT BOARD AND DISCUS DISCUSS ALL FUNCTION WE WANT TO HAVE 
YEAH I I WILL CONTINUE 
WELL ASK YOUR QUESTION IF YOU WANT 
OKAY 
IT'S NOT INTUITIVE FIRST 
YEAH 
BUT BUT ALSO IT SEEMS THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE IT WOULD BE MORE COMPLEX TO CONFIGURE IT TO BE SIMPLE THAN CREATING A SIMPLE PRODUCT 
YEAH 
BUT ALSO WE WE USE THAT THAT MOST PEOPLE FIND TO FIND REMOTE CONTROLS TOO COMPLEX BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS AND THEY MAINLY USE ONLY CHANNELS AND VOLUME BUTTONS 
SO WE MAY JUST UH MAKE A VERY EASY TO USE REMOTE CONTROL WITH MAINLY THOSE BUTTONS AND MAYBE ALSO UM 
SOME LIGHTNING STUFF OUT 
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE FIND ALSO HARD TO TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL 
LOSED LOSE IT ETCETERA 
THESE THESE ARE THESE TWO POINTS ARE THE MAIN FRUSTRATIONS SO MAYBE IF WE DESIGN SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE AND EASY TO UH FIND WHEN LOST IT WILL UH DID UH A SERIOUS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 
WITHOUT MAKING SOMETHING TOO COMPLEX AND TOO LONG TO DEVELOP 
SO BUT LE LET US SO FIRST THE NEW REQUIREMENT 
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO USE THIS THIS UH SO UH SO UM IN THE THIS IS IN THE SAME DIRECTION SO WE WERE SPEAKING SO WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A VERY COMPLEX REMOTE CONTROLS TO ACCESS TELETEXT AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
YEAH BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO DEFINE THE BUTTONS TO SURF AMONGST PAGES AND STUFF 
YEAH 
AS WELL 
YEAH 
SO ANYWAY WE DON'T HAVE TO INCLUDE THIS FEATURE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT USED ANY MORE BY USERS THEY PREFER TO USE 
YEAH 
I DUNNO 
IF I ONE BUTTON IS STILL IN MORE BUTTON 
IF IF IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE WE HAVE TO REDUCE NUMBER OF BUTTONS COMPARED TO THE TO OUR COMPETITORS 
WELL ANYWAY I HAVE THIS POINT 
WE CAN DISCUSS 
ALSO UM SO SO SO I TOLD BEFORE UH IT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT'S ONLY FOR THE T. V. UM 
BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE QUICK ON ON THE MARKET 
AND THEN ALSO WE HAVE TO MAKE VERY UH UH COLOUR THAT THIS UH 
THIS REMOTE CONTROL IS IS PART OF OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SHOW OUR CORPORATE UH LOGO AND AND COLOURS ON THE ON THE DESIGN AS WELL SO THAT UH THEY IDENTIFY IT IS ONE OF OUR PRODUCT 
SO THIS IS THE THE KEY POINT 
SO BEFORE UH FINISHING WE CAN UH DEFINE UH WHAT WOULD BE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE O THE OF THE CONTROL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WHICH BUTTON DO WE NEED WHICH FUNCTION DO WE WANT ETCETERA 
SO 
DO YOU UM SO SO FROM FROM THE THE MARKETING EXPERT I THINK 
A KEY ASPECT IS THE EASY TO USE ASPECT 
IT SHOULD BE VERY SIMPLE AND MOST BUTTON OR NEVER USED ONLY TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTON OR ARE USED OFTEN SO I THINK WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE ON THAT POINT 
NO 
YEAH OKAY 
SO YEAH THE KEY POINT HERE IS SIMPLE 
MAYBE 
SO FEW BUTTONS CHANNEL 
VOLUME CONTROL 
AND WHAT EL WHAT FUNCTION DO YOU SEE 
IN ADDITION TO THAT 
YEAH 
MAYBE SWITCH T. V. ON AND OFF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
VOLUME MAYBE A MUTE BUTTON AND THEN ON OFF BUTTON 
AND THAT'S ALL 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH THIS IS COOL 
MAYBE WE CAN INCLUDE THAT ALSO 
PREVIOUS PREVIOUS CHANNEL BUTTON 
SO WE HAVE LIKE CHANNEL BUTTON THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL BUTTON THE VOLUME BUTTON PLUS A MUTE BUTTON AND UH JUST THE THE TRADITIONAL ON OFF BUTTON 
YEAH 
I I TALK ABOUT THAT YEAH 
YEAH 
INCREMENTAL DEFINITELY BECAUSE ZAPPING YOU YOU SWITCH THEM 
WE GO FASTER 
MM 
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE ALSO A DIGIT BUTTON 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE HAVE ALSO TO HAVE DIGITS OR ONLY INCREMENTAL 
I DUNNO BEC BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE 
OH 
YEAH 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR PREVIOUS CHANNEL BUTTON IF YOU HAVE INCREMENTAL ONLY IT'S NOT UH IT ISN'T WORTH IT BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL IS THE OTHER MENUS ON OUR PLUS ONE 
SO I THINK WE NEED ALSO DIGITS 
MAYBE WE WE CAN MAKE VERY OBVIOUS THE CHANNEL AND VOLUME BUTTON BUTTON AND SMALLER BUTTON DOWN THERE WITH THE THE DIGITS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A WHEEL FOR INCREMENTAL 
OKAY 
SO HAVE A WHEEL FOR INCREMENTAL HAVE THE DIGITS UH IN THE LOWER SIDE THAT CAN BE CLOSED AS AS YOU SAY PROTECTED 
AND UH YEAH I THINK THIS IS THE BASE 
AND DO WE DO WE HAVE A 
IN A WHEEL IS BETTER 
I WOULD SAY THE WHEEL IS BETTER 
WHAT IS THE EXPERT OF UH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
WELL ALSO WE HAVE TO DECIDE UH IS IT SHOULD BE LIGHTENING IN THE DARK I THINK BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE LOST THEIR REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
YEAH AND DO WE PUT AN L. C. D. DISPLAY 
BECAUSE IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR YOUNG CUSTOMERS IF YOU REMEMBER 
OKAY 
IS AN L. C. D. 
AND SO IN SPEECH AS WELL BECAUSE IT W IT WOULD DELAY TOO MUCH THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 
YEAH 
THAT WOULD BE COOL 
BUT EIGHT MONTHS IS REALLY LONG AND 
MAYBE WE CAN JUST UH 
OKAY 
SO UM I I WILL UH I WILL SEE I WE WILL MOVE TO NEXT MEETING IS ONE AFTER THE LUNCH BREAK UH HERE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL UH ACTION UH YOU ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUT YOU WILL BE UH RECALLED TO THE ACTIONS BY UH EMAIL I THINK ABOUT YOU CAN TAKE NOTES IF YOU IF YOU WANT BUT WELL THE INSTRUCTION WILL BE SENT 
SO 
THANK YOU FOR UH YOUR SUGGESTION AND I I WILL MAKE A SUMMARY OF THAT MEETING THAT I WILL PUT IN THE SHARED FOLDER YOU CAN'T USE AND UH AND THEN YOU WILL UM YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN UH HAS BEEN USED IN IN THIS MEETING AND AND WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED 
UH MAYBE FOR NEXT MEETING UH SEND ME YOUR PRESENTATION BEFORE BY EMAIL SO THAT WE CAN USE THEM UH ALTOGETHER 
THAT WOULD BE EASIER 
NO IT DID NOT WORK 
SHE SEND IT TO ME BY EMAIL 
SO MAYBE THIS IS BETTER TO SEND IT BY EMAIL 
OKAY 
SO YEAH I I'M IT'S IN THE FIRST UH EMAIL SO I'M PARTICIPANT ONE TO UM UH WHERE IS THAT IT'S HERE 
PARTICIPANT ONE TO ME 
OKAY 
SO SO YOU AFTER LUNCH BREAK 
OKAY I CAN GO 
CAN I 
SO NOW THE RECENT INVESTIGATION WE WE HAVE DONE IF IF THE REMOTE CONTROL UM 
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR REMOTE CONTROLS IS TO BE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL AND NOT CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL 
AND UM THE SECOND ASPECT IS UH THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE 
AND THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS IT IT IS THAT THE C REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASY TO USE 
SO ARE THINGS WE ARE WE HAVE UH SPEAK ABOUT BEFORE 
YEAH 
AND UM SO YOU YOU CAN GO 
AFTER 
AND THERE IS A FASHION WATCHERS IN PARIS AND MILAN THAT HAVE DETECTED THE FOLLOWING TRENDS 
UH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURES 
SO MAYBE IF OUR REMOTE CONTROL HAVE TO BE A FRUIT FORM OR VEGETABLE FORM SOMETHING LIKE THAT ARE 
AND THE MM THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY 
UH I DON'T KNOW WHICH MATERIAL CAN BE SPONGY AND IF YOU 
MM-HMM 
OKAY IT'S ROBUST YEAH 
NOT GOOD 
ONE AND AND UH THIS UH YOU CAN YEAH YOU CAN SAY THAT 
YOU C UH YOU CAN GO UH BEFORE BEFORE YES 
AND YOU KNOW HERE THE MORE IZ IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL FEATURE IS UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE AND AFTER THE EASY TO USE 
YEAH THAT'S WHY YEAH THAT'S WHY I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT IF IT'S POSSIBLE 
INNOVATIVE 
MM 
YEAH 
UH COLOUR YEAH 
UH I I 
I THOUGHT ABOUT A A PEAR FOR EXAMPLE 
YOU KNOW THE PEAR IS LIKE THAT AND IT'S IT'S EASY TO TO HAVE ONE ONE HAND AND UH 
YEAH 
OR A FRUIT LIKE THAT 
I DUNNO 
YEAH 
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
ABDUL AL HASRED IS MY NAME 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
ALSO HAVE TO SAY DID YOU RECEIVE THE EMAIL ABOUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
NO 
YEAH 
YOU W UH AN EMAIL FROM THE MANUFACTURING DIVISION THAT THEY HAVE BASICALLY A VOICE RECOGNITION CHIP ALREADY DEVELOPED 
SAYS 
YEAH 
IT SAYS THAT ARE RIGHT NOW THEY JUST USE IT TO UH TO RECORD UH ANSWERS TO PARTICULAR QUESTIONS 
BUT I GUESS IT COULD BE 
I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE 
I MEAN INSTEAD OF RECORDING THE ANSWERS YOU CAN JUST UH RECORD UH SOMETHING SIMPLER LIKE A COMMAND 
YEAH YOU RECO RECOGNIZE COMMANDS AND YOU CAN RECORD NEW COMMANDS AND STUFF SO IF THEY ALREADY HAVE TO USE UH AS A CHIP 
THEN WE WE COULD USE IT 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY 
UM WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LIGHT 
SO 
BUT 
BUT IN THE ON THE DARK UH 
YEAH BUT IS GOING TO BE ALWAYS TURNED ON THE LIGHT 
BUT IF YOU MOVE IT THEN YOU HAVE TO YOU DON'T NEED TO FIND OUT 
YOU CAN USE THE BUTTONS BETTER OF COURSE 
YEAH 
BUT IF YOU MOVE IT THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SENSOR TO WHEN YOU MOVE TO TO DETECT YOUR MOVEMENT 
YEAH BUT YOU NEED ANOTHER SENSOR FOR THAT RIGHT 
YEAH NO IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE 
OKAY 
MM 
EXTRA 
YEAH OKAY 
MM 
YEAH BUT I EXPECTED ALSO THE WHEEL WOULD BE CHEAP BUT YOU TELL ME THAT IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE SO YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
SO UH MY ONE TO UH SHOULD BE IN THE SHARED FOLDER 
IT WAS LAST TIME I SAW IT 
OKAY 
SO JUST MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE 
SO BASICALLY WANT VERY SIMPLE RIGHT 
THAT'S THE MAJOR IDEA IS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE 
SO I JUST LOOK AT SOME CURRENT DESIGNS UH IN THE WEB OF USUALLY MORE COMPLICATED REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND LET'S LOOK AT TWO OF THEM BECAUSE UH THE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE MANY BUTTONS THEY LOOK QUITE SIMPLE 
AND IN OUR CASE WE JUST UH REJECT THE BUTTONS WHAT WE DON'T NEED AND IT BECOME EVEN SIMPLER 
UM 
SO 
YEAH 
WELL THIS THIS UH THOSE REMOTES ARE QUITE BIG SO GO TO THE NEXT PAGE IS 
WE HAVE ALL THESE BUTTONS AS YOU CAN SEE BUT MOST OF THEM WE JUST NEED THE ONES ON THE MIDDLE 
SO FROM THE BOTTOM OR WHATEVER IS THERE UH THE UH THE NUMBERS AND THEN THE TOP 
UH UNTIL THE TEN ALSO THIS MIDDLE PART AND IN THE LEFT ONE IS EXACTLY THE SAME 
SO IT'S BASICALLY MORE OR LESS HOW WE WOULD LIKE IT WITH A BIG VOLUME CONTROL BIG CHANNEL CONTROL AND MUTE AND POWER YEAH 
THESE ARE THE BASIC THING 
SO BASICALLY W SOFTWARE WE WILL BUILD WILL LOOK MORE OR LESS THE SAME AS THESE TWO 
YEAH IF YOU HAVE 
FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THAT THE VOLUME AND THE BUTTONS THAT ARE THERE IN THE TOP OR NOT VERY EASY TO REACH WITH YOUR THUMB 
IT COULD BE IN THE RIGHT SIDE FOR EXAMPLE 
YEAH 
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THESE INPUT BUTTONS AND THESE OTHER STUFF THAT THEY HAVE 
AND I THINK THAT THE PLASTIC COVER IS NOT VERY GOOD UH IDEA BECAUSE 
YOU OPEN IT IT CAN BREAK YOU C YOU CAN DO VARIOUS THINGS 
UH YOU JUST NEED TO PUT THE CHANNEL NUMBERS SOMEWHERE A BIT OUT OF THE WAY 
SO THAT THEY'RE SEPARATE A BIT YEAH 
UH AND IT'S EASY TO PRESS THE OTHER THE BIG BUTTONS BUT UH IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO PRESS THE THE CHANNEL BUTTONS THERE 
MM 
YEAH I THINK THAT IF YOU PUT THE COVER IT WILL BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE USER 
ALRIGHT YOU WON'T YEAH 
USUALLY WHAT I HAVE NOTICED THAT PEOPLE PUT THE PLASTIC COVER ON THINGS THAT YOU NORMALLY DON'T MESS WITH 
LIKE BUTTONS FOR IT UH TUNING THE CHANNELS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
THAT YOU WANT TO PROTECT A BIT 
AND I THINK IT'S UH IT'S REASONABLE 
SO I DON'T THINK 
YEAH THIS IS JUST THE THE WHOLE 
WE COULD USE THE SAME WHEELS CAN BE PUSHED DOWN COULD USE THE PUSH DOWN OF THE WHEEL FOR THE RECORD IF WE WANT 
UH SO WE COULD JUST BASICALLY IS NO JUST WHEEL AND UH USER COULD USE JUST THE WHOLE TO DO EVERYTHING WITH THE CHANNELS ON THAT CASE 
YEAH I GUESS THE MARKET RESEARCHER WILL TELL US ALL ABOUT THAT 
MM-HMM 
WELL W W I THINK WE CAN CERTAINLY JUST PUT THE ELECTRONICS IN A SPONGY THING TO IT WOULD WORK RIGHT 
YEAH 
YOU CAN THROW IT AT THE TELEVISION 
HEY THAT'S A COOL NO 
WE COULD SAY THAT IF YOU THROW IT YOU HAVE A SENSOR AND YOU THROW IT AND HITS THE TELEVISION AND TURNS IT OFF 
WHEN IT D UH TAKES A SHOCK 
YEAH 
HOW DO WE MAKE IT LOOK COOL IS THE QUESTION 
YEAH 
WELL THE OBVIOUS THING IS A BANANA I GUESS 
THE BANANA IS ALSO ERGONOMIC 
SO THERE ANY FRUIT THAT IS SPONGY 
YEAH 
YOU CAN MAKE IT UM 
IT'S NOT HARD THE METAL 
PLASTIC 
MM 
YEAH 
TWO OF THE BUTTON YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SO YOU CAN JUST HAVE UH JUST HAVE THIS CURVE YEAH 
AND YOU MOVE UH YOUR HAND HERE TO PRESS THE BUTTONS AND THEN YOU MOVE UH IN THE OTHER SIDE 
SO YOU CAN HAVE TO ONE ONE TWO SIDES AND IT'LL BE COOL NO 
YOU CAN PUT ALSO VIBRATOR INSIDE 
UH UH 
YOU CAN ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT THE BANANA FITS WITH THE COLOUR SCHEME OF OUR COMPANY 
YEAH 
I HOPE THE STUDENTS OF MANAGEMENT DIE BUT ANYWAY 
NOW WHO ARE RECORDING THIS MEETING 
THE ONLY THE 
YEAH 
Y YEAH THAT CAN BE IN INSIDE THE ON THE STRUCTURE 
BUT UH THE THING IS THAT THE BUTTONS AND THE WHOLE HAVE TO BE I MEAN IF IT'S SPONGY THEN THE BUTTONS AND THE WHOLE HAVE TO I MEAN IF IT'S SPONGY THEN IT'S GOING TO MOVE 
RIGHT 
SO IT'S GOING TO BE BEND A LOT 
SO IF WE TRY TO PUSH THE BUTTONS TO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
WELL USUALLY HOLD 'KAY WE WANT TO TO BE GOOD ALSO FOR THE LEFT HAND USERS RIGHT 
OH 
YEAH BUT OKAY 
SO LET'S SAY THAT THE O IT HAS TO BE BASICALLY YOU CAN ONLY TAKE TWO SIDES 
NO NO THIS THIS SIDE WHERE IS THE THUMB AND THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THERE IS UH YEAH ALSO THE THUMB 
BASICALLY 
OR YOU COULD USE IS THIS ONE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO USE THIS ONE FOR THE WHOLE 
THIS FOR THE WHEEL AND THEN THIS FOR THE BUTTONS 
SHOULD HAVE THE TWO SIDES 
SO IF THE LEFT WE HAVE 
THE P 
WHILE WHILE BUTTONS 
YEAH THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU HAVE BUTTONS AND WHILE THEN WHEN YOU TURN IT AROUND THE BUTTONS ARE IN THE OTHER SIDE 
SO YOU CANNOT USE THEM 
YEAH 
SO THE BUTTONS HAVE TO BE HERE AND THE WHOLE HAS TO BE 
YOU 
YEAH I KNOW ABOUT UH IF YOU HOLD WITH YOUR LEFT HAND AND THE WHEEL IS HERE 
AND THE BUTTONS ARE HERE THEN WHEN YOU TURN IT AROUND THE BUTTONS WILL BE IN THE OTHER SIDE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MAYBE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YES MASTER 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE UH UH MM OKAY 
UH I. D. YOU WANT 
YEAH 
I ONLY V HAVE THREE SLIDES SO 
I JUST LOOK AT THE MM 
UM JUST THIS 
IN SOME WEB PAGES TO FIND SOME DOCUMENTATION AND I THINK A REMOTE CONTROL SO SO I S MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY 
YOU JUST HAVE A A VERY SIMPLE CHIP AND THE MM THE USER INTERFACE IS JUST DONE USUALLY BY PUSH BUTTON 
AND IN OUR CASE WE ARE USING A UM A WHEEL CONTROL 
SO UH UH I WAS LOOKING BASICALLY FOR THAT CHIP 
WHICH IS UH VERY VERY STANDARD AND UH I JUST LOOKED FOR THE WHEEL SENSOR AND THE STANDARD PUSH BUTTON 
AND UM YEAH WE CAN CHANGE DIRECTLY 
IN FACT I HAVE THE NUMBER OF THAT ELEMENT WHICH IS VERY STANDARD FOR REMOTE CONTROL 
THE PUSH BUTTON ARE USUALLY EXTREMELY CHEAP BUT I JUST HAVE NO PROBLEM AND THIS IS RELATED WITH THE WHEEL SENSOR WHICH SEEMS TO BE QUITE EXPENSIVE 
AND I THINK WE IF WE COULD JUST TALK ABOUT THAT IF WE REALLY NEED A WHEEL SENSOR OR IF WE CAN NOT IF IF WE COULD COMBINE SOMETHING WITH THE PUSH BUTTON 
UH A WHEEL SENSOR IS FIFTY TIME THE PRICE OF A A A PUSH BUTTON 
YEAH 
YEAH I I TH 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT UH WE SHOULD 
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT UH THE DESIGN OF THE BOX ALSO WHICH NEEDS SOME MONEY 
BUT 
UM THAT'S ALL YEAH 
I HAVEN'T CHEC 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT I THINK IT'S YEAH SORRY I HAVEN'T WRITTEN MY PERSONAL REFERENCES 
UM THE I I JUST WANT TO MENTION THE THE PROBLEM OF THE THE OR 
WHEELS SENSOR WHICH IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ANY PUSH BUTTON AND IF WE COULD REDUCE THAT 
WE WE HAVE ALREADY SOME GOOD THINGS UH WITH UM UM WITH THE BACKLIGHT OF THE PUSH BUTTON 
JUST TO TO MAKE SOMETHING WHICH IS UH SLIGHTLY MORE DESIGN THAT UH A SQUAREY BOX WITH A RUBBER 
YEAH 
ACTUALLY 
AS SOON AS YOU THOUGHT TO MOVE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU HAVE THE LIGHT 
YEAH 
AGAIN 
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY EXPENSIVE BUT AT THE AND THIS IS PLENTY OF UNEXPEN EH VERY CHEAP DEVICES BUT UH THE BILL STARTS TO BE 
FIRST OF ALL I WAS THINKING TO HAVE A A CONTINUOUS LIGHT AND YOU W WHEN IT YOU YOU YOU YOU PRESS THE ONE BUTTON YOU HAVE THE LIGHT ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
WHEN YOU WANT TO TURN OFF YOUR DEVICE 
YEAH A LITTLE BIT 
A LITTLE BIT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IT IS 
MM-HMM 
I SUPPORT AN APPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM IT 
UH IT'S OKAY 
I KNOW THAT THEY DO THAT FOR ALARM CLOCK ALSO 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WHAT ABOUT UM 
AND FOR MAYBE LOOK AND FEEL WHAT ABOUT A A PIECE OF C 
WITH BLUE L. E. D. INSIDE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
BANANA I THINK IT'S A NICE IDEA 
BECAUSE 
BUT 
Y Y YOU DON'T USE THE BANANA WHEN THE BANANA IS CURVING LIKE THAT BUT WHEN THE BANANA IS CURVING LIKE THAT 
WITH THE WHOLE IN THE TOP AND TO CONTROL AND HERE YOU HAVE A A PUSH BUTTON IT 
YEAH 
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT IS A BANANA 
BASICALLY 
IF YOU IF YOU START WITH UH FANCY FRUITS AND FOR US AND THE 
OH YEAH 
SO 
SO WE WILL JUST AS A A STANDARD BATTERY 
AND UH THE CHIP WE CHIP IMPRINT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHICH ONE WE ARE GOING TO USE 
UH WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CASE 
YEAH 
UH I MEAN FOR ME IF WE USE A A SPONGY BANANA CASE DOESN'T MATTER 
I JUST WANT TO HAVE IS SOMETHING TO PRIN TO TO FIX MY MY COMPONENTS INTO THAT BOX AND THAT'S IT 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
SPONGY ALSO 
OH NO I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THIS IS UH LIKE THE 
MM-HMM 
WHEEL ON THE TOP 
BUTTON WHERE DO WE WANT SOME BUTTONS 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THANK YOU 
OKAY 
SO WE ARE HERE FOR THE CONCEPT DESIGN MEETING 
SO WE WILL FIRST START BY SUMMARIZING THE MM THE PREVIOUS MEETING AND THE DECISION WE'VE TAKEN 
UH I WILL TAKE NOTES DURING THIS MEETING IS UH THAT YOU CAN UH LOOK AT MY UH FOLDER TO USE THE SUMMARY OF THIS MEETING AFTERWARDS 
SO EACH OF YOU WILL UH SHOW US THE VARIOUS INVESTIGATION THEY'VE DONE DURING UH PREVIOUS UH HOURS 
WE'LL THEN TO TAKE DECISION IN CONCERT AND THEN UH UH WE WILL UH DEFINE THE NEST NEXT TASK TO HAVE TO BE DONE BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING 
SO LAST TIME WE DECIDED TO HAVE A SIMPLE INTERFACE 
WE ALSO DECIDED TO HAVE A WHILE TO CHANGE CHANNEL PREVIOUS CHANNEL BUTTON 
CHANNEL DIGIT UH BUTTONS SHOULD BE UH PROTECTED BY PLASTIC COVER OR SOMETHING FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO LOOK VERY SIMPLE 
WE HAVE ALSO BUTTON FOR VOLUME AND TO SWITCH ON OFF THE T. V. 
WE HAVE ALSO UH THE LIGHTENING FEATURE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO BE EASY TO FIND 
AND FOR FAST DEVELOPMENT AND LOW COST WE HAVE DECIDED TO HAVE AN L. C. D. NO VOICE FEATURES 
SO NOW UH WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS 
SO THE CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION BY INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER THE SPECIFICATION OF THE U. I. BY OR U. I. OKAY 
AND UH THE LAST POINT IS UH TREND WATCHING BY MARKET EXPERT 
SO MAYBE WE CAN START WITH UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN 
SO THIS IS THE PRESENTATION 
MAYBE I CAN SWITCH SLIDE UH IN YOUR REQUEST 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
BUT IS IT A SIGNIFICANT PRICE ON THE WHOLE REMOTE CONTROL 
BECAUSE WE CAN AFFORD UP TO TWELVE EUROS FOR THE PRICE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AS WELL WELL WELL THIS WITH UH INCLUDING ALL POSSIBLE THINGS AS BUTTONS WHEEL AND THE CHIP BE UH LOWER THAN TWELVE EUROS TO PRODUCE 
OKAY 
YOU RECEIVED SOMETHING 
HMM 
AND COULD TO BE ADAPTED 
OKAY AND THERE CAN UH RECOGNIZE SOME COMMANDS AND STUFF 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY MAYBE WE CAN JUST UH LISTEN TO THIS PRESENTATION AND THEN TAKE DECISION LATER ON ACCORDING TO THOSE NEWS 
OKAY 
YOU CAN EASILY FIND THE BUTTON ON THE DARK OR SO 
IT WILL BE TRAINED ON WHEN THE WHEN THE USER MOVE THE REMOTE CONTROL I THINK ONE 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TRUE 
BUT IT CAN BE UH BATTERY CONSUMING NO 
TO HAVE THE LIGHT ALWAYS ON 
WELL WE WILL DISCUSS THAT AFTER MAYBE 
THE THREE PRESENTATIONS 
YEAH 
AND IT IS 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND ALSO DOES IT UH FIT WELL ONE HAND 
BECAUSE IT WAS UH THE YOUR WRIST PROBLEM WITH THE USAGE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO IT'S ONLY THE CENTRAL PART 
YEAH 
WITH A MAYBE A MORE ERGONOMIC DESIGN IN IN THE BOTTOM PART 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO 
OKAY 
WILL BE DOWN OR OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM 
YEAH 
MAYBE THE WHOLE WILL BE A GOOD ADVANTAGE OVER OUR COMPETITORS 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S PRETTY STANDARD APART THE FACT THAT IT'S VERY SIMPLE 
SO MAYBE IT'S WORSE TO UH TO HAVE MORE EXPENSE NO THAT'S THAT ASPECT 
OKAY 
SO WE CAN MOVE TO THE IS THERE ANY QUESTION 
FOUR 
DESIGNER OF USER INTERFACE 
ARE WE CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT PART MAYBE AND DISCUSS AFTERWARDS 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THIS IS GOOD ALSO FOR 
YEAH 
I THINK IT IS GOOD ALSO F TO HAVE A SPONGY MATERIAL YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE IT'S ROBUST 
YEAH OH SORRY 
NO 
YEAH 
BEFORE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S INNOVATIVE TO USE THE MM THE WHOLE BECAUSE I THINK IN ONE ALSO HAS 
HAS TO 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S IT MAKES IT BOTH EASY AND BOTH INNOS INNOVATIVE 
SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD ASPECT AND IT SHOULD BE KEPT 
COOL FANCY 
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT L LOOK LIKE A FRUIT OR VEGETABLE 
MAYBE UH UM A CLEAR THAT REMEMBER SOME FRUIT UH THINGS LIKE THAT 
MAYBE YEAH 
YEAH AND IT'S ERGONOMIC AS WELL 
A PEAR 
YEAH 
MAYBE PEAR YEAH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
WE CAN DISCUSS THAT UH 
DO DO IS IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD 
I DON'T THINK SO 
I THINK WE WE CAN HAVE LIKE YEAH A PEAR IS GOOD FIT WELL OR BANANA AS YOU TOLD 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT THAT'S NOT IN THE TREND 
THE TREND IS SPONGY AND VEGETABLE FRUITS 
I THINK P SPONGY IS GOOD BECAUSE IT IT WILL BE ROBUST AS WELL 
SO I THINK WE CAN KEEP THE WHOLE 
BECAUSE IT'S UH SAY IT'S INNOVATIVE EVEN IF THE COST IS A BIT HIGHER AND WE ALSO HAVE TO FIND A 
IS A FRUIT LIKE PEAR OR BANANA WIT UH ANY THEIRS DO YOU HAVE 
WHAT KIND OF FR FRUIT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TO CONTROL YOUR T. V. WITH 
DO 
BANANA IS ALSO YELLOW SO YOU YOU CAN'T LOST YOUR REMOTE CONTROL THEN 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD DESIGN AND IT'S INNOVATIVE AS WELL THEN 
MAYBE WE CAN KEEP THE BANANA 
AND IT WILL BE VERY EASY TO FIND 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S REALLY UH REALLY A GOOD POINT 
I THINK IT IS 
ONE SECOND 
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE SOME DECISION ON THIS ASPECT 
SO UH AS FAR 
SORRY FOR UH COMPONENT IS 
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOSE ASPECTS SORRY 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S THE BOX THAT SHOULD BE SPONGY BANANA'S SHAPE 
BUT 
IN THE BUTTON WOULD BE IN FACT IT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING ODD SHAPED WITH A SPONGY COVER 
OKAY ODD SHAPE WITH SPONGY 
COVER 
AND STANDARD BATTERY OKAY A CHIP IMPRINT THERE'S NO SPECIFIC PROBLEM 
SO WE AGREE TO PUT THE WHOLE 
SO TO HAVE TO IT HAS TO BE SYMMETRICAL 
YEAH MAYBE THE THUMB IS MORE COMFORTABLE 
YEAH I THINK IT'S OKAY FOR BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT 
MM 
I THINK YOU CAN TURN IT THIS WAY ALSO 
YOU CAN DO BOTH WITH BOTH HANDS 
I THINK IT'S OKAY 
WELL Y YOU WILL GET USED TO IT 
AND MOREOVER TH THE BUTTON OR ARE LIGHTED SO YOU YOU IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY THE RIGHT SIDE BECAUSE YOU HAVE LIGHT ON BUTTONS 
YEAH 
NO Y Y I THINK YOU WILL USE IT ONLY IN THE RIGHT OR LEFT HAND WHETHER YOU ARE RIGHTY OR LEFTY 
I THINK FOR LEFTY IT'S OKAY 
I CAN DO THIS MOVEMENT AND FOR RIGHTY AS WELL 
I THINK THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THAT MUCH 
YEAH 
SO FOR INTERFACE WE SAID ALSO THAT WE HAVE UH THIS BANANA SHAPE WITH BUTTON ON THE S IN THE SIDE 
AND 
AND UH A WHEEL ON THE TOP 
SO THE COLOUR IS YELLOW 
I THINK IT'S UH WE DEFINED EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO 
WHAT WE SHOULD WHAT THE DECISION WE SHOULD TAKE YEAH 
SO MAYBE WE CAN UM 
WE CAN UH WORK ON THOSE ASPECTS UH UNTIL NEXT MEETING 
SO HAVE THE FINAL UH LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN ACCORDING TO THE DECISION 
AND HAVE THE THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND UH THEN EVALUATE THE PRODYUC THE PRODUCT 
THAT IS TO SAY UH CHECK IF IT FIT THE THE REQUIREMENT UH GIVEN BY THE USERS BUT ACCORDING TO UH YOUR PRESENTATION IT SEEMS TO BE OKAY 
IT SEEMS TO BE FANCY INNOVATIVE AND EASY TO USE 
SO 
SO 
TO PREPARE THE PROTOTYPE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER UH WORK TOGETHER 
THAT WOULD UH 
BE BETTER I THINK 
AND UH 
AND SO UH 
YOU WILL RECEIVE FURTHER INSTRUCTION BY EMAILS AS USUAL 
SO DO YOU NEED TO ADD ANYTHING 
YOU FEEL OKAY 
YOU FEEL UH FOR TO EXPRESS WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY 
YOU DON'T FEEL TOO CONSTRAINED 
YOU DON'T FEEL FREE TO ANSWER THIS 
OKAY SO 
SO YOU 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO UH YOU CAN HAVE MY PROJECT IN 
OH YEAH JUST A 
FOUR 
EVALUATION 
OKAY 
SO YOU CAN GO 
WE CAN GO THROUGH 
SO I MADE AN EVALUATION AND THE THE EVALUATION CRITERIA IS MADE ACCORDING TO THE USERS' REQUIREMENTS AND THE MARKET TRENDS WE TALKED ABOUT UH DURING THE PREVIOUS UH MEETINGS 
SO YOU CAN GO THROUGH AND OKAY SO UH WE HAVE UH SIX POINTS 
WE 
WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE 
SO WE WE WANT TO HAVE A PRODUCT FANCY LOOK AND FEEL TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE EASY TO USE FASHION EASY TO FIND IN A ROOM 
AND ROBUST UH AND UH UH I HAVE A SCALE OF UH SEVEN POINTS 
OKAY 
SO I GO THROUGH ALL THE UH ALL THE POINTS HERE 
AND UH ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE THIS PROJECT YOU CAN UH MM MAKE A ONE POINT TWO POINT OR SEVEN POINT 
OKAY 
AND AFTER WE UH WE HAVE AN AN AVERAGE AND UH WE USE 
THE OKAY 
UH SO UH FANCY LOOK AND FEEL WHAT DO YOU THINK 
OF BETWEEN O ONE AND SEVEN 
YEAH 
SEVEN IS THE 
MM-HMM 
SORRY 
OH 
NO I JUST WANT TO USE SOMETHING 
MM-HMM 
UH I THINK UH AND AND IT AS WELL 
AND IT UH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU W UH WE HAVE TO PUT UH IN UH F 
IF IT'S BETTER OR 
UH UH 
UM 
YEAH 
OR MAYBE WE CAN SAY IS SEVEN IS THE BEST MM 
OH SORRY 
SIX 
UH SO YOU CAN HOW MUCH WHAT 
OH YES I MM I DUNNO MM I THINK SIX IT'S A GOOD UH 
YEAH 
WE CAN 
OKAY 
I SORRY 
OKAY 
SO AFTER THE TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECT 
SO WE WE SAID UH WE HAVE UH A NEW TECHNOLOGICAL UH THING WITH A WHILE 
OH 
NO 
FOUR 
WE CAN PUT FOUR 
EVERYONE IS OKAY OR FOUR POIN 
FOUR 
OKAY 
VERY EASY TO USE 
DO YOU THINK IT'S EASY TO USE 
MM SIX FOR ME ALSO 
SIX POINT FIVE 
OKAY 
SO IT FASHION 
SEVEN 
YEAH IT'S FASHION BECAUSE IT'S A FRUIT AND WE SAY THAT THE YEAH SEVEN 
UH EASY TO FIND IN A ROOM 
YEAH 
WE HAVE THE LIGHTNING OR 
THE LIGHTING 
YEAH 
SEVEN 
SO IT IS IT ROBUST 
EVERYBODY IS OKAY SIX 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO NOW UM SO 
THIRTEEN UH TWENTY TWENTY SIX POINT FIVE UH SEVEN THIRTY TWO THIRTY SIX 
THAT'S THAT'S OKAY 
SIX 
GOOD 
UH IF WE SAY THAT SEVEN IT'S UH IT'S THE BETTER AND WHEN HE IS SIX SIT SIX OR GOOD IT'S A GOOD UH P PRODUCT I THINK 
WE HAVE A GOOD PRICE AND UH 
GOOD 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
IT IS A BANANA 
IT IS THE ESSENCE OF BANANAS 
I WOULD BE CONFUSED WITH THIS THING 
SO 
HOW IS EVERYONE 
MM-HMM 
LIKE A BANANA 
I GIVE IT A I GIVE IT A FIVE 
AND YOU 
DO YOU VOTE UH CHRISTINE 
DO YOU ALSO VOTE 
WELL WE CAN VERY EASILY 
I 
SO IT WILL HAVE FIVE POINT FIVE AVERAGE 
MM 
IT'S FOUR 
YEAH 
D ARE WE INCLUDING THE VOICE OR YOU GLU ARE WE INCLUDING THE VOICE IN THE END OR NOT 
HUH 
NO 
OKAY 
YEAH 
FOR TWENTY FIVE 
YEAH 
I GIVE A SEVEN I THINK 
'KAY 
YEAH WE CAN WE CAN PUT A SEVEN HERE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL WE HOPE 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK IT'S COOL 
I THINK WE CAN PUT A SIX HERE 
SO YOU'LL MAKE THE MATERIAL TRANSPARENT SO THAT IT UH LIGHTS UP COMPLETELY OR 
YEAH 
YEAH THE ONLY PROBLEM THERE MIGHT BE WHICH KNOW I IF IT'S VERY SENSITIVE THEY WILL I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH OKAY 
MM 
SIX YEAH FOR ME 
YEAH 
TWENTY 
THIRTY 
THERE 
OKAY 
YEAH THE TOP 
MM 
SO WILL BECOME EIGHT SOON 
YEAH WELL IT'S A BIT BIASED 
OKAY 
BECAUSE I SAW UH SOME PHONES THAT WERE BANANA SHAPED UH WIRELESS PHONES NOT MOBILE ONES WIRELESS FOR THE HOUSE 
UH QUITE BIG ALSO AND THEY WERE SELLING SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED EUROS TWO HUNDRED EUROS 
JUST A JUST A PHONE WIRELESS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLEX BUT 
OKAY 
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE TIME 
UH VERY WELL WE WORKED TOGETHER FANTASTICALLY 
SO WHAT DOES THE MANAGEMENT SAY 
WHAT DOES THE MANAGEMENT SAY 
OH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I WILL GIVE A A FIVE 
FIVE 
A FOUR ALSO BECAUSE EXCEPT FOR THE WHOLE WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH INNOVATION 
THE RUBBER IS 
UH A FOUR 
I I 
YEAH 
SIX 
SIX 
SIX SIX SIX POINT FIVE 
YEAH SEVEN 
EASY TO FIND 
I LOST MY BANANA 
OH 
SIX 
YEAH OKAY 
UH F YEAH IT'S OR IT'S RUBBER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SIX OR FIVE 
FIVE 
SIX 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT ALMO ALSO THE COMPLEXITY BETWEEN A PHONE AND A REMOTE CONTROL IS NOT CANNOT COMPARE 
START TO EAT BANANA 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
FRUITS 
OKAY 
JE CROIX QUE C'EST DOMMAGE DE LE IT WILL BE USED TO DESTROY THIS PROTOTYPE 
IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE A BANANA 
IT IS A BANANA 
MM 
OKAY 
OH 
SO WE ARE HERE FOR THE DETAILED DESIGN MEETING 
SO WE WILL UH I WILL FIRST PRESENT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IN THIS MEETING 
THEN 
OH I'VE I WILL ALSO TAKE NOTES DURING THIS MEETING AND I WILL SEND YOU UH A SUMMARY THEN AS USUAL 
WE WILL THEN LOOK AT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA OF THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTED BY UH OR TWO COLLEAGUES THAT MAKE GOOD WORK 
AND UH THEN WE WILL USE THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS AND THE COST OF THE PRODUCT 
THEN WE WILL UH EVALUATE THE PRODUCT 
AND UH AND 
WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THIS PROJECT AND SEE WHETHER IT FITS 
WITH IT FULF IF IT FULFIL THE REQUIREMENT OR NOT 
SO D LET'S START WITH THE COST ASPECT IS SO I LOOK AT THE ASPECT DISCUSSED LAST TIME THAT IS TO SAY UH TO HAVE A STANDARD BATTERY 
TO HAVE A YELLOW BANANA SHAPED UH CASE WITH UH A RUBBER MATERIAL AROUND IT TO BE UH TO FEEL SPONGY 
AND UH ALSO AT THE DIFFERENT ASPECT LIKE HAVING A WHEEL ETCETERA 
AND THE COST ENDED TO BE TEN POINT SEVEN EUROS 
SO WHICH IS UH GOOD BECAUSE WE HAD A PRICE GAP OF TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS 
SO FOR THE FINANCIAL ASPECT IT'S OKAY WE CAN UH WE CAN CONTINUE WITH THIS PRODUCT UH SO IF 
AND WE ARE NOW GOING TO USE THE PROJECT EVALUATION WITH UH OUR MARKETING EXPERT 
YEAH 
YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION 
PARTICIPANT FOUR YES 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MAYBE YOU CAN PRESEN OKAY 
MAYBE HOLD IT 
SO I THINK IT'S UH VERY UH VERY NICE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YEAH 
SO IT'S BETWEEN ONE AND SEVEN 
SEVEN IS THE HIGHEST UH 
I WILL GIVE A SIX 
MAYBE WE ALL HAVE TO AGREE ON A COMMON 
YEAH 
NO PROBLEM 
SO THIS IS YOUR 
ONE IS MOST 
WELL WE CAN CHOOSE WHAT WE WANT 
OKAY LET'S SAY THAT SEVEN IS THE BEST 
OKAY 
SO SO DO NOT THE GRADE WE HAVE FIVE SIX FOR ME FIVE 
AND WHAT WHAT'S YOUR CHOICE 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU GIVE ON THE FANCY ASPECT ON THE FASHIONABLE ASPECT 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU YOU DON'T ANSWER TO THIS UH QUESTIONNAIRE 
FIVE POINT FIVE AVERAGE 
OKAY 
WELL DOES IT 
OKAY TECHNE TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECT 
YEAH WE HAVE THE WHOLE 
WE ALSO HAVE THE RUBBER MATERIAL 
WHICH MAKE IT UH 
LIKE 
NOW ALSO 
I THINK I WOULD GIVE A FIVE 
FOUR 
OKAY 
NO 
SO WHAT'S YOUR UH GRADE 
FOUR 
SO WE HAVE FOR FOR F AND FIVE 
YEAH FOR 
FOUR YEAH LET'S PUT FOUR 
DOESN'T IT 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH 
I WOULD GIVE A I WOULD GIVE A SEVEN AS WELL 
IT'S VERY EASY TO USE 
SO SIX POINT FIVE 
OKAY 
OH YEAH ITS ITS OF ITS FRUIT FRUIT SHAPE 
I WOULD SAY SEVEN 
AND IS VERY VERY NICE DESIGN 
SEVEN OKAY 
I THINK YOU CAN'T MISS OUT 
OKAY 
YEAH WE HAVE THE WE DON'T SESH ESPECIALLY HAVE THE LIGHTNING BUT 
SO IT'S YELLOW 
IT'S OKAY 
I THINK IT'S VERY EASY TO I WOULD SAY SEVEN 
IT'S HARD TO MISS OUT 
YEAH IT'S RUBBER MADE OF RUBBER I THINK IT'S UM IT'S UH MORE RUBBER THEN UH THEIR REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
BUT IT IS UH IT IS SURROUNDED BY RUBBER MATERIAL 
SO MAYBE WE CAN PUT A SIX 
SIX IS OKAY 
YEAH 
TADADA 
WE HAVE TO SUM UP EVERYTHING 
SIX IS A GOOD 
YEAH THE B 
OKAY SO SIX IS A 
SO IT'S A GOOD EVALUATION I THINK 
IT'S VERY PROMISING 
HUH 
SO THIS PROTOTYPE IS QUITE NICE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO HAVING THIS TO TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS UH QUITE ATTRACTIVE I THINK 
I THINK THE 
YEAH 
SO I THINK WE CAN SUMMARISE 
SO WE HAVE SEEN THE PROTOTYPE 
IT'S VERY NICE ACCORDING TO THE WORK OF OUR TWO DESIGNER 
THE THE THE FINANCIAL ASPECT WERE OKAY 
WE WE HAVE THE COST BELOW UH OUR THRESHOLD AND SO WE COULD SELL AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS AND MAKE I MAKE PROFIT 
THE THE EVALUATION GIVE SATISFYING RESULT AS WELL 
SO I THINK WE CAN MOVE TO THE LAST PART OF THE MEETING 
SO THE COST US IN THE BUDGET THE EVALUATION IS OKAY SO I TH I THINK WE CAN NOW UH OPEN CHAMPAGNE AND MAKE A HUGE PARTY 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PROVIDED BY UH BY THE MEETING STUFF 
OKAY SO CONGRATULATION 
NICE PRODUCT 
YEAH 
I THINK IT WAS A GOOD COLLABORATION UH 
ASPECT 
SORRY 
I THINK WE WILL HAVE M MUCH BIGGER PROJECT NEXT TIME AND A MUCH BIGGER SALARY AS WELL 
ALL IT DEPENDS ON WHO WATCH THIS MEETING 
WE DON'T KNOW 
OKAY SO GOOD GUYS SO SO YOU FOR NEXT UH SUCCESSFUL PROJECT 
YEP 
RIGHT 
I THINK ONE OF 
I THINK WE YEAH 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD ALSO KEEP IN MIND UM WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS I MEAN OUR COMPANY'S SLOGAN IS WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS RIGHT 
SO I THINK ARE KIND OF OUR TARGET HERE IS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF VERY LIKE SLEEK NICE LIKE REMOTE AND WE WANT TO TO BE FUNCTIONAL AS WELL 
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN SELLING POINTS IS THAT 
WE DON'T WANT TO TO BE CLUNKY LIKE LIKE THIS THING HERE 
YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANNA A BIG CLUNKER 
WE WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS NICE AND IT'S FASHIONABLE AND SO 
THAT'S FINE 
OKAY SO 
SO YOU ALL KNOW UM I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
AND WE'VE SOME BASIC COMPONENTS THAT UM OUR REMOTE IS GONNA NEED JUST BASICALLY EVERY REMOTE'LL NEED 'EM 
WE NEED SOME KIND OF POWER D POWER SOURCE 
UM WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON OUR OUR USER INTERFACE WHICH IS HIS DEPARTMENT BUT THE IN USER INTERFACE IS ALSO A MAJOR COMPONENT 
UM WE NEED A PROGRAMMABLE DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSOR TO ME TO TAKE THE INPUT FROM THE USER AND TRANSLATE THAT INTO UH 
INTO ELECTRONIC SIGNAL WHICH WE PASS TO THE INFRA RED L. E. D. WHICH YOU AIM AT THE TELEVISION UH WHICH AND IT RECEIVES THAT SIGNAL 
YOU NEED A ON OFF SWITCH UM I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GET IN THERE 
AND UH WE ALSO NEED TO UM HAVE THE IF WE WANT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE WE NEED TO HAVE ENCRYPTION CODES FOR THE DIFFERENT MAKES OF T. V. S 
SO WE NEED TO KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT SIGNALS AND SO THAT'LL REQUIRE SOME MEMORY AS WELL 
UM SO HERE'S JUST A BASIC LAYOUT OF HOW HOW THE REMOTE WOULD WORK 
YOU UH THE V THE POWER SOURCE IS IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER THERE 
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT UH WE HAVE THE USER INTERFACE HERE WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE CHIP WHICH DOES ALL OUR SIGNAL PROCESSING 
AND THEN PASSES THAT SIGNAL IN AT THE INFRA RED L. E. D. AND THAT SIGNAL IS THEN EMITTED AND RECEIVED BY THE TELEVISION TO THE PHOTO TRANSISTOR 
SO THESE ARE THE BASIC COMPONENTS THAT NEED TO GO INTO THIS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS PRETTY MUCH UH OPEN TO MOVE AROUND 
I THINK ANY IDEAS 
NO 
RIGHT I THINK 
YEAH THIS IS JUST THIS IS JUST A BASIC LAYOUT OF EV OF ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT WE WE ARE GONNA BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY F TO HAVE A WORKING REMOTE 
WE CAN ADD THINGS IN LIKE IF WE WANTED SOME VOICE RECOGNITION 
I MEAN THAT I MEAN THAT YOU CAN KINDA SAY WOULD WOULD FALL UNDER THE USER INTERFACE AND THE DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING CHIP 
BUT 
UM WELL THE MOST THE MOST COSTLY COMPONENTS ARE GONNA BE THE CHIP AND THE UH THE IT COULD ALSO BASICALLY THE USER INTERFACE AND THE CASING ARE GONNA BE EXPENSIVE AS WELL 
UM THE L. E. D. AND THE THE TRANSISTORS AND EVERYTHING ELSE OR YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY CHEAP 
SO DEPENDING ON WHAT WE WANT OUR FUNCTIONALITY TO BE UM THE CHIP COULD BE EXPENSIVE OR IT COULD BE CHEAP 
UM DEPENDING ON THE N AMOUNT OF MEMORY WE NEED IN THERE AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND UH AND UH YOU KNOW HOW MUCH POWER 
UH I DON'T HAVE ANY FIGURES RIGHT NOW 
WE UH WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL WE GET IT A MORE SPECIFIC DESIGN PHASE FOR THAT 
UM BUT AND I THINK A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE COST COULD BE THE ACTUAL THE ACTUAL CASING ITSELF AND AND YOU KNOW THE THE B THE BUTTONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
I THINK 
YEAH 
BASICALLY YEAH 
SO YEAH 
THAT'S ALL I HAVE REALLY 
CLICK DON'T YEAH 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT SO FAR AS I IT'S JUST UH THE COST OF AN EXTRA BUTTON 
I MEAN SOFTWARE WISE THERE'S REALLY NO DIFFERENCE 
I THINK 
SCHEDULING 
UM TO FIND OUT WHAT WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING EVEN IF THERE'S COMMERCIALS YOU KNOW 
I THINK I UH 
I AGREE 
WELL FOR ME 
YEAH 
UNLESS YOU HAVE A 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I THINK A LOT OF THAT'S PROPRIETARY ANYWAYS 
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO YOU LIKE COMMAND A TIVO WITH OUR REMOTE 
I DON'T THINK 
I THINK IF IT'S POSSIBLE YOU SHOULD TRY TO YOU KNOW HAVE A TALK WITH MANAGEMENT ABOUT THAT 
JUST YOU KNOW 
RIGHT IT'S JUST NOT YEAH 
WELL 
RIGHT 
I'M JUST THINKING YOU KNOW WITH ALL THESE UNIVERSAL REMOTES THAT ARE OUT THERE 
HOW MANY PEOPLE HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY IS VERY AFTER THAT ARE YOU KNOW I LIKE THESE TRAINABLE REMOTES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S JUST SO CONFUSING TO DO IT IS ALL THESE FUNCTIONS 
WHERE 
I THINK THE LARGEST PORTION OF THE MARKET IS JUST GONNA YOU KNOW THEY LOST THEIR T. V. REMOTE THEY NEED ANOTHER ONE THAT'LL WORK WITH THEIR T. V. 
THEY WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS NICE THAT THAT THAT ISN'T GONNA BREAK WHEN THEY DROP IT 
THAT YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE IT'S IT'S ERGONOMIC IT FEELS GOOD IN YOUR HAND SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE WHERE YOU'RE GONNA FIND THE BIGGEST YOU KNOW MARKET SHARE 
I THINK THE MORE BELLS AND WHISTLES WE DID IT'S JUST GONNA CUT INTO OR NOT OUR PROFITS 
BECAUSE I THINK SO WE SO WE ADD COSTS FOUR THINGS LIKE UH FOR LIKE IF WE DID THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE OF THE UM OF THE MARKET IS ACTUALLY GONNA USE THAT 
MAYBE FIVE PERCENT YOU KNOW AND HOW MUCH 
RIGHT 
YEAH OKAY 
I'M SORRY 
SORRY BOSS 
YEAH 
WELL IT'S KINDA BOTH OF US 
SO SO USER INTERFACE 
MM-HMM 
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT 
THEN YOUR LIGHTS WOULD GO OFF THOUGH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
I DON'T 
I THINK ALL THESE THINGS ARE PRETTY STANDARD 
I THINK WE'LL BE OKAY 
MM YOU CAN JUST CLICK 
NO NO NO YOU JUST GET OFF THAT 
YOU JUST CLICK ANYWHERE 
I HAVE AN IDEA 
AND IT'S KIND OF ALONG THE S LINES OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AND IT MAY EVEN FIT INTO ERGONOMICS 
AND EVEN KIND OF ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LOSING LOSING THE REMOTE WHAT WE WERE SAYING IT'S A COMMON ISSUE 
UM WHAT WE CAN DO AS WELL YOU KNOW THAT BATTERIES THROWING A AW REMOTES RUN THROUGH BATTERIES LIKE CRAZY 
RIGHT 
AND SO FOR SOME PEOPLE YEAH 
WELL MAYBE NOT A SOLAR REMOTE BUT INSTEAD WHAT ABOUT IF WE HAD LIKE A POWER CRADLE 
LIKE A A CRADLE THAT IS IS THERE TO HOLD THE REMOTE WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING IT 
SO YOU'LL ALWAYS KNOW WHERE THE REMOTE IS 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUT IT BACK THERE TO CHARGE THE REMOTE 
AND WE CAN INSTEAD OF HAVING INSTEAD OF HAVING YOU KNOW 
REPLACEABLE BATTERIES WE'LL JUST HAVE A POWER CELL THAT STAYS THERE FOR THE LIFE OF THE REMOTE 
YOU NEVER HAVE TO GET GO THROUGH THE GO THROUGH UH ALL THESE DIFFERENT BATTERIES 
AND ALSO YOU CAN I I THINK IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THE USER DESIGN OR FOR NOT JUST FOR THE USER DESIGN 
BUT ALSO FOR THE JUST FOR THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE REMOTE IS IS A WHILE 
YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE SOME KIND OF NEAT LITTLE YOU KNOW A SEXY DESIGN FOR DO A CRADLE AND THE REMOTE ITSELF 
IT W IT WOULD INCREASE THE COST 
AND YOU COULD PAGE THE REMOTE IF YOU LOSE IT 
MAYBE THERE'S A BUTTON ON THE CRADLE 
WELL 
WHAT I CAN DO SO I CAN DO LOOK INTO UH WELL PEDRO AND I CAN LOOK INTO HOW MUCH THIS MIGHT INCREASE OUR OUR COSTS AND YOU CAN LOOK INTO WHAT KIND OF EFFECT AN INCREASED COST IS GONNA HAVE ONE OR IN OUR FINAL NUMBERS 
I I 
YEAH 
I JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT 
BECAUSE IN ORDER TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO PRICE TO TO THAT KIND OF LEVEL I THINK WE'D NEED TO HAVE EVERY FUNCTIONALITY THAT ALL THE OTHER COMPETITORS ARE OFFERING LIKE BEING ABLE TO OPERATE 
YOU KNOW THE D. V. D. PLAYER AND YOU KNOW THE STEREO SYSTEM AND ALL THAT 
WHICH IS A PRETTY BASIC FUNCTION THAT WE WE'VE OPTED OUT OF 
AND ADDITIONALLY WE'RE M MAYBE NOT SUPPORTING TELETEXT UM 
BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME BASIC FEATURES THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT A LOT OF THEIR REMOTES ARE GOING TO HAVE 
MM-HMM 
I DON I I D I HAVE TO DISAGREE THOUGH 
I THINK OUR MARKET NICHE IS BASICALLY PEOPLE WHO AND WHO HAVE LOST THEIR REMOTE OR UH WHO'VE BROKEN THEIR REMOTE AND DON'T WANNA SEND BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER 
THEY JUST WANNA RUN IT AT THE STORE AND GET A REMOTE 
AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA LOOK ON THE SHELF AND THEY'RE GONNA SEE OURS IS THE NICEST LOOKING REMOTE 
IT DOES WHAT THEY NEED 
THESE AREN'T I I THINK THAT IT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
WELL HERE'S 
RIGHT 
WE UH WELL HERE'S MY THING ABOUT THAT 
IF YOU'RE IN THE MARKET FOR THIS ULTIMATE REMOTE YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO FOR JUST A TELEVISION REMOTE 
IF IT CAN'T CONTROL IF IT CAN'T CONTROL YOUR YOUR D. V. D. PLAYER AND A L IF YOU IF YOU CAN'T GET THAT ALL IN ONE ULTIMATE REMOTE 
THAT JUST YOU CAN THROW ALL YOUR OTHER REMOTES AWAY 
I'M NOT GONNA BUY A D SEVENTY FIVE EURO REMOTE 
SO I THINK WHAT WE SEE THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING 
MM-HMM 
I THINK THAT'S BIG 
I THINK SO YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT ABOUT UM THE IDEA THAT I HAD WITH THE CRADLE 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
OR HOW DOES EVERYBODY FEEL 
NO BUT I THAT'S THE THING I I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY THE OTHER END 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
WELL IT LASTS IT WOULD LAST FOR SEVERAL HOURS ON ITS OWN POWER BUT WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH IT YOU PUT IT BACK IN THE CRADLE 
YEAH WELL IT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL THE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT SO WE MAY END UP WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF INVENTORY OF A OF A POOR DESIGN YOU KNOW 
SO 
UM BUT WHAT WE COULD DO IS SOME KIND OF WELL I MEAN 
YEAH WE WE NEED TO I MEAN 
HAVE A FEW DESIGNS TO LOOK AT AND THEN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE SO YOU KNOW THE BEST FIT 
I THINK W WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS IT HAS TO LOOK GOOD IT HAS TO FEEL IT HAS TO FEEL GOOD IN YOUR HAND 
IT HAS TO BE DURABLE IT HAS TO A AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT DOESN'T LOOK CHEAP 
I THINK I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE LIKE IT IT ON AND FEEL LIKE TO ITS LIKE A QUALITY REMOTE 
EVEN THOUGH THE COST MAY BE LOW 
MM-HMM 
OR WHAT IF IT LOOKS LIKE A PEN 
YEAH 
A POINTER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
JUST TO TOUCH ON UM MY POINT IN LAST TIME THAT I HAD BROUGHT UP 
UM I REALLY UN UNLESS YOU GUYS ARE DIE HARD AGAINST THE FACT THAT UM IT'S POSSIBLE LIKE IT REDUCES THE USABILITY OF THE REMOTE B AND THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T LOSE IT IN YOUR OWN 
I THINK IT STILL MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO INVESTIGATE HAVING LIKE A POWER CRADLE 
BECAUSE I REALLY THINK I IN A CERTAIN SENSE TO ALMOST LIKE FOR UM I WOULD WANT TO HAVE THAT JUST 
BECAUSE I KNOW AT THE END OF WHEN I'M DONE WATCHING T. V. THAT WHEN I'M DONE 
UH I BETTER GO FIND THE REMOTE AND PUT IT BACK WHERE IT BELONGS 
MAYBE TH TH TH THAT'S JUST SOME PEOPLE THAT LIKE THAT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE 
IS A WATCH 
MM 'KAY 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING 
EXACTLY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND ALSO PRESUMABLY THEY'VE 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
TRUE 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
THE LOCATOR'LL DEFINITELY BE MORE EXPENSIVE 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN PUT RIGHT ON THE BOX IS NEVER BUY ANOTHER BATTERY 
YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO 
WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 
NOW HOPEFULLY WE'VE ALL GOT A BETTER IDEA FROM THEN WE DID F LEAVING THE LAST MEETING IS IT WHAT IT SO WE ARE UP TO NOW 
SO HERE'S AN AGENDA 
UH I'LL OPEN 
UM YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I'LL BE TAKING MINUTES DURING ALL THE MEETINGS 
SO I WAS STRUGGLING AT OUR LAST TIME UH AND THAT'LL BE EASIER FOR ME NOW BECAUSE I'M NOT ACTUALLY GIVING THE WHOLE PRESENTATION 
UH THE ADDITIONAL POINTS ARE JUST THE STUFF THAT WE SENT AND THAT I FORWARDED ON FROM UPPER MANAGEMENT HAVING A FEW BRIGHT IDEAS TO MAKE OUR LIVES PAINFUL 
UM NOW YOU CAN ALL GIVE YOUR PRESENTATIONS 
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS AND HOPEFULLY COME TO SOME DECISIONS 
RIGHT FORTY MINUTES FOR THIS MEETING IS A BIT MORE TIME THAN THE LAST ONE 
HERE'S THE ADDITIONAL POINTS I JUST WANTED TO PUT THIS ONE THERE TO SEE IF YOU GUYS HAD ANY COMMENTS 
ON THEM 
UH DID YOU ALL RECEIVE THAT EMAIL 
SO DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OVERALL 
MM 
MM 
YEP 
MM 
WELL TH THAT FIRST POINT COULD UH ALSO BE AN OP OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IN SEEING THAT TELETEXT IS BECOMING OUTDATED 
SOME SORT REMOTE CONTROL THAT CAN WORK WITH THE INTERNET THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT'S PRESENTED I GUESS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
BUT BUT WE ARE SORT OF BEING DICTATED THAT THIS SHOULD ONLY BE FOR THE TELEVISION 
SO WE'RE QUITE FIXED 
SO WE'RE REALLY PROBABLY IN TERMS OF MARKETING ARE LOOKING FOR THAT'S UH THAT'S A COST WINNER RATHER THAN A FANTASTIC NEW FEATURE PRODUCT 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
BUT THERE'S ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR MARK THERE'S A MARKET HERE FOR OUR LAST TELETEXT 
FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE THAT JUST GOES TO THE SHAPE THAT WANTS A REPLACEMENT WANTS TO USE CHIP IS POSSIBLE 
TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS THE SELLING PRICE WE REALLY HAVE TO INNOVATE HERE I GUESS 
MM 
OK YEAH 
MM 'KAY 
OKAY 
OKAY I THINK THAT THE LAST POINT IS PROBABLY QUITE UH STRAIGHTFORWARD 
OBVIOUSLY THE THE W IT HAS TO BE BRANDED 
IN THE PRODUCT YEAH 
CAN YOU HANDLE THAT BLACK AND YELLOW 
MM 
NAH 
SO WE HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS AND I THINK WE'LL GO ON 
ORDER OF PARTICIPANT NUMBER HERE 
SO WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE WORKING DESIGN FIRST FROM PARTICIPANT TWO 
THAT'S 
OKAY 
MM IT'S ENOUGH 
BUT UH CLICK IT ON OFF 
DO WE HAVE AN IDEA OF COSTS OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS 
'KAY 
MM 'KAY 
DO WE HAVE ANY BALLPARK FIGURES FOR THAT YET 
NO 
'KAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THANKS 
AND WE HAVE PARTICIPANT THREE WHICH I BELIEVE IS PEDRO 
I CAN GIVE YOU THAT TO CLICK ON 
AND YOU WANNA GET 
VIEW A SLIDE SHOW THAT'S WHAT YOU WANNA DO YEAH 
JUST GO UP TO VIEW 
MM 'KAY 
BUT I IT I THINK WHAT THE THE MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATION WAS LESS THAT THERE'S A WORRY THAT TELETEXT WILL BECOME OUTDATED RATHER THAN WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO 
SO I I STILL THINK IF IT'S CHEAP ENOUGH FUNCTIONALITY WISE TO INCLUDE IT REALLY SHOULD BE IN THERE 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST GOING TO I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S NECESSARY OR NOT 
IF YOU IF YOU'RE GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN A IT A REMOTE WITH TELETEXT OR WITHOUT UH WHEN IT REALLY IF IT I IF IT ISN'T MORE EXPENSIVE FOR US TO K MAKE BECAUSE AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT 
IT CAN BE OPERATED WITH THE SAME SET OF BUTTONS YEAH 
SO IT SHOULD BE IN THERE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
ISN'T 
WELL MAYBE WHAT WE'RE GETTING INTO HERE IS THE THE IDEA OF UH INTERNET THROUGH THE T. V. FOR EXAMPLE 
SO THAT MIGHT PLAY ON WHAT WE CAN DO 
WELL YOU HAVE DIGITAL T. V. STILL ALREADY 
WELL THERE THERE IS A FOR EXAMPLE IN DIGITAL T. V. SYSTEMS YOU HAVE YOU CAN PRESS A BUTTON AND YOU CAN BUY THINGS IN ADVERTS 
AND YOU CAN UH YOU CAN VIEW THROUGH A CATALOGUE FOR EXAMPLE 
A A FAMILY MEMBER OF MINE HAS GOT A SYSTEM WHERE YOU JUST UM YOU CAN 
YEAH AND THERE'S OTHER FEATURES FOR EXAMPLE IN THEIR SYSTEMS WHERE YOU CAN PAUSE LIVE T. V. AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
THEY'RE JUST FEATURES FROM THE INTERNET UH FROM COMPUTERS ARE ARE COMING INTO THE T. V. SORT OF UNDER THE COVERS BUT YOU STILL USE IT THROUGH A TELETEXT 
SO NOW THE THINGS TO THINK HERE OR THAT THAT THERE'S GONNA BE MORE FUNCTIONALITY POTENTIALLY THAT WE CAN HANDLE 
MM 
BUT STILL THERE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY 
IF IF IT'S FOR EXAMPLE A TRAINABLE ONE THEN WE'RE JUST SIMPLY HAVING LIKE AN UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT 
NO OKAY BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MIGHT MIGHT DO AS WELL IN FUTURE PROOFING IT 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH AND NEITHER DO I IN FACT 
B UH 
I'LL COMMUNICATE THAT BACK TO THESE GUYS THERE A A AND THE THE MESSAGE REALLY WE WANNA BE SENDING TO THEM IS THAT 
ALTHOUGH TELETEXT MAY BECOME OUTDATED W THERE'S NO L LOGIC N NOT HAVING IT IN THERE ANYWAY 
I IF IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE PRICE 
UM BUT I I THINK WHAT THEY'RE PUSHING US TOWARDS HERE IS IN TERMS OF THINKING OF WAYS TO FUTURE PROOF OUR SYSTEM FOR FUTURE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN TELETEXT MAYBE 
I DUNNO I'M 
MM 'KAY 
MM 
YEAH 
HMM 
SO IF WE'RE KEEPING IT BASIC WE'RE LOO LOO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO SELL IT BASICALLY SO IT'S UH JUST BEING VERY EASY TO USE 
LOOKING EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD THAT SORT OF THING 
'CAUSE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE THERE DO WE 
MM-HMM 
BUT I IF DESIGN OF DESIGN IS CHIP AND FUNCTIONALITY IS BASIC 
THEN TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS PROBABLY A HIGH PRICE FOR A COMMONER GARDEN STAN STANDARD T. V. S THE PLACE UH REMOTE TH THEN THE PLACE WE'RE GOING TO JUSTIFY THAT COST US THROUGH THROUGH DESIGN THROUGH MAKING IT A A SLEEK ELEGANT HIGH PRICED BASIC REMOTE 
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE HUH 
MM 
YEAH WE PROBABLY SHOULD 
WE WE'RE DOING ALRIGHT FOR TIME 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SORRY THAT KINDA CUT INTO YOU THREE 
MM 
SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD AND JUST WORKS RATHER THAN LOOKING FOR ANY SPECIAL FEATURES 
SO THAT 
MM 
BUT WE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE POTENTIALLY IN THE MARKETING MARKETING PRESENTATION ABOUT THIS 
BE A GOOD IDEA 
OH SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT IN 
I'M NOT THE BOSS 
OKAY 
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A QUESTION MORE FOR 
FOR THIS GUY HERE YEAH 
SO IT 
OKAY 
MM 
HMM 
OKAY 
I HAVE A QUESTION UH FOR YOU 
DOES ANY OF THE UM THE FEATURES THAT PEDRO'S SPOKEN ABOUT HERE HAVE ANY IMPLICATIONS WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IN IN TERMS OF JUST PURE FUNCTIONALITY 
IN TERMS OF MAKING IT WORK OR THE COST OF THAT ARE 
OKAY 
'KAY 
CHEERS 
ONTO PARTICIPANT FOUR 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
NOW THE THE QUESTION IS CAN WE MAKE THIS FOR LESS THAN TWELVE FIFTY PER 
WE WE WILL DO WE NECESSARILY HAVE TO CHANGE THE END COST BECAUSE UH 
CAN WE DL CAN WE DO THAT WITHOUT UH CHANGING IT TWELVE FIFTY PER PRODUCT IF WE BASICALLY CAN SELL MORE BASED ON THIS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WE WE CAN CERTAINLY PUSH FOR A MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCT IF THAT'S GONNA BE 
NAH I THINK WE CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY NOW THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING TELETEXT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
AND AND THE TO GET IT BACK TO ANOTHER POINT SORRY UH UH FOR CUTTING IN BUT 
I TH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THAT THIS REMOTE HAS TO WORK WITH MULTIPLE T. V. S YEAH 'CAUSE IT'S SELLING ON ITS OWN 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SPECIFICALLY FOR HITACHI T. V. S OR OR WHATEVER 
SO TECHNOLOGICALLY IF I UNDERSTAND IT UH T. V. S T. V. REMOTE'S WORKING EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS VIDEO REMOTES AND D. V. D. REMOTES 
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TRAIN THEM AT THE INDIVIDUAL IN ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS IS KNOW THE THE F LIKE SOME FOUR DIGIT CODE 
SO SAYING THAT IT WORKS WITH ALL T. V. S IS EQUIVALENT TO SAYING THAT IT'LL WORK WITH D. V. D. S AND OTHER THINGS 
OH OKAY OKAY 
WE HAVE DONE THIS 
I SEE 
MM-HMM 
AND I I'D MM SORRY 
SO WE REALLY CAN'T CHASE THAT 
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING BASIC 
THE THE ONE THING THAT THAT THAT YOU SAID REALLY STRUCK A CHORD WITH UM HERE IN THAT WE'RE WE'RE CARRYING THE CORPORATE IDENTITY WITH THE PRODUCT 
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A LARGE PROFIT AT THE SAME TIME WHERE I'D BE INCLINED TO GO BACK TO UPPER LEVEL MANAGEMENT AND SAY LIKE LET'S JUST CUT DOWN OUR PROFIT EXPECTED ON THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE WE ARE ACTUALLY BRANDING OUR COMPANY HERE 
WE'RE SELLING MORE THAN JUST THE PRODUCT 
WE'RE TRYING TO GET MIND SHARE ABOUT UH REAL REACTION TO TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA BUY CONSUMER ELECTRONICS 
WE WANT PEOPLE TO EVENTUALLY SAY UH THAT'S THAT'S REAL REACTION THAT'S A GOOD M MAKE 
IT'S RELIABLE 
AND AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT WE'RE GONNA WIN MIND SHARE BY UH THERE BEING A FANTASTIC PRODUCT OR FOR IT WORKING 
IT JUST BEING GOOD REASONABLE PRICED AND SLIDE 
SO IF WE CAN MAKE IF WE CAN PUT AN EMPHASIS HERE ON IT NOT BREAKING I THINK THAT'S IN ITSELF AN EXTREMELY BIG THING 
WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES LEFT 
SO TWENTY FIVE EUROS A MID MARKET PRICE FOR A REMOTE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL I'D BE INCLINED TO SAY IF WE CAN MAKE THE DESIGN BETTER THAN ANY COMPARABLE REMOTE WHILE REDUCING THE COST 
THEN THAT'S THE WAY WE REALLY SHOULD PLAY IT 
IF WE CAN TAKE IT DOWN TO YOU KNOW FIFTEEN RATHER THAN TWENTY FIVE AND MAKE A LOW PROFIT MARGIN ON IT BUT WE'RE REALLY DOING THAT TO SELL THE BRAND 
YEP WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT 
UH RATHER TH UH TO TO TO SELL FOR REAL REACTIONS 
AND I CAN COMMUNICATE THIS TO TO THE MORE SENIOR UH MM PEOPLE WITHIN THE COMPANY HERE TO TO GET A REACTION 
WELL HOW DOES EVERYBODY FEEL 
I I THINK 
THE OTHER THE O THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IN MY MIND I JUST THINK OFF HAND IS A AS A CONSUMER WOULD I WANNA BUY THAT 
AND I THINK MAYBE NOT BECAUSE I'VE GOT A REMOTE AND I'LL TAKE IT IT DIFFERENT CHAIRS 
I'LL TAKE IT IT DIFFERENT I W I DON'T WANNA GO OVER SOMEWHERE AND PUT IT DOWN 
IT I IF IT IS GONNA BE SOMEWHERE THAT YOU PUT IT DOWN THEN IT NEEDS TO BE AT THE SIDE OF YOUR ARMCHAIR 
AND THAT IMPLIES THAT THERE'S ONLY ON T. V. USER 
SO IT'S VERY GOOD FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT IT'S NOT A LOOK 
BUT IT IT TAKES AWAY THE EASE OF USE OF THE REMOTE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 
YOU HAVE TO L SORT OF REMEMBER 
YOU HAVE TO D SHIFT DOWN THE SIDE OF THE COUCH TO FIND OUT AND PUT IT BACK AND 
YEAH 
I D I D I D I THINK IT IT IN MY MIND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING THAT UH I'D REALLY WANT UH BECAUSE OF THAT FACT 
BUT I I DON'T KNOW THAT'S JUST MY OPINION 
MM 
'KAY 
SO WHAT DO WE THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD PEDRO DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINION ON IT 
REALLY NEED TO WRAP UP NOW 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
I MEAN THERE'S AL THERE'S ALSO REMOTE CONTROLS I REMEMBER THAT THAT WORKED UH 
THIS HASN'T BEEN DONE IN A WHILE I THINK ABOUT THE USE A AS A WATCH 
YEAH THERE IS REMOTE CONTROL WATCHES UM BUT I THINK THEY'RE A SORTA EIGHTIES THING 
SO IT MIGHT NOT BE EASY TO MARKET IN IT UH ABOUT THE THE TECHNOLOGIES CAME ALONG AND IT MIGHT BE CHEAPER TO MAKE NEW 
THESE THINGS MAY HAVE BEEN INEXPENSIVE FOR ALL I KNOW 
GOTTA CUT UP 
MM 
THE LAST REMOTE YOU'LL EVER BUY 
WELL IF IF WE'RE GOING DOWN THAT THEN WE CAN WE DON'T NEED TO GO THE IT IT STRIKES ME THAT THE LOCATOR FEATURE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE UH QUITE EXPENSIVE TO MAKE 
WHEREAS ACTUALLY JUST PUTTING IT IN A POWER CRADLE MIGHT NOT BE TOO EXPENSIVE AT ALL BECAUSE THAT'S JUST DONE WITH MOBILE PHONES YOU CAN JUST ONE WE WE HAVE SAID WE HAVE ACTUALLY SIMILAR PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN TAKE FROM AND POTENTIALLY CUT COSTS THERE 
UM AND TO LOOK INTO WHETHER WE CAN DO THAT BUT UH I THINK WE WE HAVE SOME M MOBILE PHONE BASED PRODUCTS UH CHECKING QUICKLY OUR INTERNET 
WE REALLY NEED TO FINISH UP HERE 
BUT UH 
YEAH WE HAVE THE THE POWER ADAPTOR PRODUCTS 
WE SELL POWER ADAPTOR PRODUCTS 
SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING US 
SEEING THAT TECHNOLOGY 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK SO WITHOUT IT BEING IT IN FACT WE CAN CUT COSTS THROUGH USING THE MANUFACTURING THAT'S ALREADY GONNA BE ONE PLACE HERE 
OKAY 
YEP 
'KAY 
THANKS GUYS 
YEAH 
WELL UH WHAT COMES UP FOR ME IS THAT IF WE'RE GONNA IF WE'RE GONNA BE MARKETING A PRODUCT THAT IS GOING TO BE UH HAVING ONE TELETEXT 
PEOPLE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING TELETEXT AND USING TELETEXT 
AND SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE GONNA BE A NEW PRODUCT WITHOUT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE HAVING RIGHT NOW 
SO THAT'S FROM A MARKETING PERSPECTIVE I I SEE I SEE A LOCK 
AND SO WE HAVE TO GO I THINK IN THE OTHER DIRECTION 
WHAT ARE WE GONNA HAVE THAT MAKES THIS THING BETTER THAN 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
NO I I AGREE WITH YOU 
SO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT SO I SEE THAT ONE SIDE WE'RE ELIMINATING SOMETHING SO WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER SIDE WHICH IS 
WHAT ARE WE GONNA BE TARGETING OUR MARKET UH THAT IDENTIFIES OUR PRODUCT IS BETTER THAN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TELETEXT IT HAS TO TO TO TO IT 
SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT WAS MY REACTIONS 
YEAH YEAH 
YEP 
OKAY 
YEAH 
'KAY 
THAT'S RIGHT 
I THINK WE TAKE WITH YOU 
THAT'S WHAT I'M THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS IS THAT WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS GONNA BE VERY ATTRACTIVE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT 'CAUSE SOMEBODY 
SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE HAP UNHAPPY 'CAUSE IT TOOK THEY CAN'T AC ACCESS THEIR TELETEXT 
OKAY 
'CAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OR NINETY PERCENT OR NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TELEVISIONS OUT THERE ARE ARE TELETEXT 
SO SO IT'S IT'S NOT THAT I'M CRITICIZING THE PRODUCT AT ALL 
IT'S JUST WHEN WE ELIMINATE THAT THEN WHAT DO WE BRING 
WHAT ARE WE BRINGING IN TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THIS AND WE HAVE TO DO IN MY OPINION WE HAVE TO DOUBLE UP 
IF WE LOSE ONE WE NEED TO BRING TWO OR THREE 
SO YOU HAVE THIS 
NOW IS WOULD THIS BE CONSIDERED JUST A STANDARD UH UM 
THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY WE'RE TALKING HERE 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXISTING TECHNOLOGY 
NOTHING IS BEING MODIFIED OR UPGRADED OR NEW DISCOVERIES 
OKAY 
OKAY 
NO OKAY 
MM THE SHELL 
OKAY 
I HAVE MAYBE A SILLY QUESTION 
I IN THE VERY BEGINNING TO SIDE WITH THE WITH THE ADVENT OF COMPUTERS THERE'S GONNA BE THE IT'S GONNA BE OUT MODED TELETEXT 
I I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THESE TWO THINGS ARE CONNECTED 
HOW DOES HOW DOES COMPUTERS AND TELETEXT UH HOW WHY IS ONE ELIMINATING THE END OF THE OTHER 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT 
OKAY 
YEAH 'CAUSE YEAH I JUST I DON'T USE THE CROSS OVER BETWEEN COMPUTERS AND TELEVISION 
I MEAN I DO IS THE CROSS OVER IN SOME SENSE BUT BUT BUT BUT WITH THE THE REMOTE IS IS USED FOR TELEVISION OKAY 
SO SO IF WE MAKE THE CROSS OVER AND WE'RE GONNA VIEW TELEVISION ON COMPUTERS THEN WE'RE THEN WE'RE LOSING THE THE NECESSITY OF THE REMOTE 
SO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH I DON'T I DON'T USE THE LOGIC 
I I DON'T USE THE LOGIC IN ELIMINATION OF TELETEXT I JUST I I BUT I'M NOT A TECH MIND THERE 
I JUST DON'T USE THE CROSS OVER BETWEEN COMPUTERS AND AND AND 'CAUSE WE ARE DESIGNING SOMETHING FOR A TELEVISION OKAY 
WE ARE SELLING IT TO AN EXISTING MARKET 
THAT'S 
YEAH AND AND YEAH AND AND WE'RE ALSO MARKETING A PRODUCT 
IT'S WHAT I'M SEEING AS A AS A MID RANGE COST PRODUCT 
SO SO WE WE CAN'T GO AND PUMP A WHOLE BUNCH OF TECHNOLOGY INTO THIS THING BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE GONNA HAVE COST OVERRUNS 
SO IF WE DROP IF WE ARE GONNA CHOOSE TO DROP TELETEXT AGAIN WHAT ARE WE ADDING AT THE PRODUCT THAT MAKES IT MARKETABLE 
I DON'T I DON'T USE IT 
AND IT UM IF I'M GONNA MARKET A PRODUCT FOR BE FOR BEAUTY FOR FOR DESIGN I'M GONNA I'M GONNA TRY TO MARKET IT IT A MUCH HIGHER PRICE 
I NEED TO MAKE IT SPECIAL WITH A HIGH PRICE TAG 
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY UH G UH COMPETITIVE 
I WANT I WANT TO MARKET IT AS EXCLUSIVE 
SO I WOULD MARKET THIS PRODUCT TO TO EIGHTY NINE EUROS AND COME UP WITH SOME REALLY BEAUTIFUL EXTERIOR DESIGN OR SOMETHING TH BUT BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY 
NO I NO I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT WHAT I'M WHAT I'M OKAY WE PROBABLY NEED TO MOVE ALONG BUT MY MY CONCERN IS TRYING TO FIND A MARKETING NICHE FOR THIS PRODUCT 
AND IF I'M COMING IN WITH A WITH WITH TWENTY FIVE EUROS WHICH IS MID MARKET PRICE UM THEN WHAT AM I GOING TO GIVE THESE PEOPLE FOR THIS 
SO THAT'S JUST MY QUESTION BUT WE CAN KEEP TALKING 
YEAH 
UH P PEDRO I JUST WANT TO SAY QUICKLY I I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT WHEN YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOME MORE BELLS AND WHISTLES EH 
YOU KNOW SELL UH THINGS COME TO MY MIND IS UH UH SOMETHING THAT'S UH UM VOICE ACTIVATED 
I KNOW WE'RE GETTING INTO SOME I HOPE SOME BIG MONEY ON THIS THING BUT 
SO THAT FOR OVER HERE 
OKAY ALRIGHT 
THAT'S 
'CAUSE UH AND I THINK OF VOICE ACTIVATED I THINK OF OF HOW MANY TIMES I'VE I'VE LOST MY MY REMOTE AND I CAN'T FIND OUT 
SO SOME WAY THAT I CAN I CAN FIND MY REMOTE BY CLAPPING MY HANDS OR SOMETHING UH AND AND SO SO UM BUT THIS 'S JUST SOMETHING 
I'M TRYING TO FIND SOME BELLS AND WHISTLES 'CAUSE WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT TEL TAKING OUT TELETEXT IT'S LIKE WHAT ARE WE GONNA PUT IN 
WHAT MAKES THIS THING ATTRACTIVE 
AND IT'S ONLY FOR TELEVISIONS 
SO WE EVERYTH OUR OUR COMPETITION OUT THERE HAS GOT THESE THESE MULTIPLE ADAPTORS WHERE THEY CAN USE 'EM FOR THEIR V. C. R. S 
THREE D. V. D. S THEIR THEIR TELEVISIONS AND WE'RE COMING OUT WITH ONE REMOTE FOR TELEVISION ONLY 
AND SO IT UM WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS A REALLY SPECIAL PRODUCT I I I DON'T SEE I REALLY HAVE TO SAY I DON'T USE THE MARKET NICHE FOR THIS PRODUCT 
AT THIS PRICE I DON'T USE IT YET 
I'M I I GO ALONG WITH THIS BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GIVEN TO TRY TO MARKET BUT I I DON'T USE THE MARKET NICHE FOR THIS PRODUCT 
WITHOUT WITHOUT SOME REALLY SORT OF SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL TO IDENTIFY IT AS AS UNIQUE IN THE MARKET 
YEAH 
OKAY 
HAVE TO DO YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN THE BOX 
OKAY WELL SO SO THAT'S UP TO YOU THEN IT TO MAKE THIS BOX IN SOMETHING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 
MAYBE MAKE IT IN THE FORM OF A AGAIN 
WE CAN SELL IT IN UNITED STATES 
WELL YOU KNOW FOR MARKETING OF MARKETING FOR ME IS UH AND UH HOW DO I GO HERE 
OKAY 
G GO 
SO THAT RIGHT 
UH UH 
YEAH WHAT FOR ME IS IT UM I D I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M MARKETING RIGHT NOW 
OKAY 'TIL YOU SPEAK AND WHEN I WROTE THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M MARKETING 
I JUST KNOW THAT I I WAS IDENTIFIED AS A A WE IDENTIFIED OURSELVES AS A AS A DEVELOPER 
IS A MANUFACTURER AND AS A AS A UM DISTRIBUTOR T TO OTHER WHOLESALERS 
AND SO THE THE THE TWENTY FIVE EUROS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS THE SALE PRICE IS A WHOLESALE PRICE RATHER THAN A RETAIL PRICE 
THAT'S WHAT WE DECIDED HERE 
UM SO WHAT I DID SO I I DECIDED THAT THAT THIS THIS NEEDS TO BE A PRODUCT IN A IN A SENSE CAN MARKET ITSELF 
SO WHAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED HERE IS OUR MAIN MARKETING STRATAGEM IS IS IN DESIGN 
WE'RE MAKING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ATTRACTIVE UH WHATEVER WE DECIDE TO USE 
SO THAT MEANS WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN MORE MINUTES OR TEN MINUTES LEFT 
UM SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A PRODUCT THAT THAT WE CAN SELL EASILY 
SO I SAY INSPIRATION IS HAVING SOMETHING BEAUTY SOMETHING ATTRACTIVE UH SOMETHING THAT IN A SENSE WILL SELL ITSELF 
UH INNOVATION I THINK FITS INTO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WITH DESIGN 
UH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE THAT THESE WERE IDEAS I WAS PUTTING TOGETHER 
UM UNLESS WE COME UP WITH SOME NEW AGE PRODUCT A AS FAR AS THE CASING IS CONCERNED 
I I WANNA MAKE THIS THING SOMETHING THAT I CAN IDENTIFY AS SPECIAL IN SOME WAY SO MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOME I I TALKED ABOUT ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE 
UH MAYBE WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED IN SOME WAY AS ADVANTAGEOUS IN A HOME 
I DON'T KNOW 
THESE ARE JUST THOUGHTS 
UH I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT UH WHO WE ARE IS A AS A CORPORATION THAT WE'RE NOW WE'RE AGGRESSIVE 
WE'RE COMPETITIVE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE A PRODUCT FROM A NEW PERSPECTIVE RATHER THAN FROM AN OLD CORPORATE LINE 
SO IT UM IT'S ABOUT SELLING D UH OUR IDENTITY OUR CORPORATE IDENTITY ALONG WITH THE PRODUCT 
UM WHAT I FOUND IS THAT THE PROJECTED COSTS ARE COMPETITIVE 
UH WE'RE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MARKET ABOUT WHAT I'M SEEING IS THAT THE MARKET IS READY FOR I I IDENTIFIED NEW TECHNOLOGY 
BUT AGAIN BECAUSE WHAT I S S BUDGET RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN BRING ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY INTO THIS THING 
IF IF WE COULD HAVE A TECHNOLOGICAL SOMETHING 
MM P PLEASE 
SOLAR 
BUT SOLAR 
BLAH I LIKE IT 
I LIKE THE IDEA BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN COST IS GONNA PROBABLY DOUBLE 
BUT BOY WE CAN SELL THIS THING BECAUSE THERE'S NO BATTERIES IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE I WE CAN IDENTIFY IT IS A SAFER PRODUCT IN SOME FORM 
YEP THAT'S RIGHT 
I REALLY IS ABOUT THE COST I 
NO NO 
NO NO WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE END COST 
THERE'S UH I MEAN I DON'T USE IT ANYWAY 
YEAH THAT'S GONNA BE UP TO THESE GUYS 
I MY REACTION IS NO BUT 
WELL SO I I SEE I I'M AN ADVOCATE TO MAKE THIS ONE EXCLUSIVE PRODUCT 
YOU KNOW LET'S LET'S SELL THIS WHOLESALE FOR FOR FIFTY EUROS SIXTY EUROS 
LET'S MAKE THIS THING REALLY EXCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE UH HIGH TECH DESIGN UH ERGONOMICS ALL OF THIS 
JUST MAKE THIS THING UH YEAH THE THE THE ROLLS ROYCE OF OF REMOTE CONTROLS 
EVERY HOME'S GOT TO HAVE TO 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE HEY WHAT KIND OF REMOTE DO YOU HAVE 
OH YOU'VE GOT ONE OF THIS UH FANTASTIC I WANT ONE OF THOSE OUT 
I JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY RIGHT NOW 
YEP ONE ONE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND SO UH THEY'VE THEY'VE GIVEN US THIS PACKAGE OKAY 
NOW UH IN MY OPINION WE NEED TO GIVE THEM A PACKAGE BACK OKAY 
THEY SAY THEY SAY OKAY HERE YOU GO 
THEY GAVE US A FUNDAMENT A FOUNDATION OF OF WHAT THEY WANT AND AND W IT'S OUR PLACE TO KINDA ANALYSE AND EVALUATE 
I DON'T THINK IT'S OUR PLACE TO CREATE THEIR PRODUCT FOR THEM MAYBE IT IS 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF ROLE WE HAVE ON THIS IN THE CORPORATE LADDER UH 
BUT IT UM IT'S LIKE OKAY YOU HAVE GOT YOUR HERE'S OUR IDEAS OKAY 
AND THEN LET THEM LOOK AT THESE IDEAS AND THEY SAY YEAH WELL 
WE CAN WE CAN ERASE THE PRICE TWENTY PERCENT YOU KNOW W LIKE THIS IDEA THIS IDEA NO 
BUT IT UM IT'S IT'S ABOUT A CHOICE DO WE FOLLOW THEIR DIRECTIVES OR DO WE MAKE UH PRESENTATIONS BACK AND AND THEN AND THEN DISCUSS 
BECAU I I DO NOT I DO NOT SO THE MARKET NICHE FOR THE PRODUCT THAT THEY'RE HANDING F HANDING US RIGHT NOW 
I DON'T USE IT 
RIGHT 
NO I UNDERSTAND THAT 
NOPE THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THE PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING FOR ANYTHING ABOUT TELEVISIONS 
THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THIS PRODUCT LIMITA THAT'S WHY I SAY I DON'T I DON'T USE THE MARKET NICHE FOR THIS 
IF WE IF WE IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A PRODUCT THAT WORKED FOR D. V. D. S V. C. R. S AND EVERYTHING 
THEN I CAN USE THE MARKET NICHE BUT WE WE'RE ONLY IDENTIFIED AS GOING FOR TELEVISIONS WITHOUT TELETEXT 
AND IT'S LIKE WHO WE UH IN MY OPINION WE HAVE TO GO WITH SOMETHING THAT'S EXTREMELY EXCLUSIVE TO MAKE THIS THING MARKETABLE 
BECAUSE WHO WANTS JUST A TELEVISION REMOTE 
I DON'T 
THAT'S RIGHT 
I I I HAVE A TENDENCY TO AGREE WITH YOU 
I REALLY DO 
THAT'S WHY I SAY I QUEST I Q I QUESTION THE MARKETABILITY OF THE PRODUCT 
I REALLY QUESTION WHERE WE CREATE THE DEMAND 
WE OKAY IF YOU IF YOU DROP THE COST NOW IF YOU MAKE IF YOU MAKE GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COST SCALE 
AND YOU MAKE IT LESS EXPENSIVE THAN ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW WE'RE GOING INTO IN A A NEW MARKET OR 
SO WE CAN SAY LOW COST UH UH UM UH GOOD DESIGN BEAUTIFUL WA DA DA DA DA DA 
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS RIGHT NOW WE'RE MIDDLE MARKET 
YEAH FOR FOR MULTI FOR A MULTI FUNCTION REMOTE THAT'S A MID MARKET PRICE 
IN A DISCOUNT RIGHT NOW YOU CAN BUY 'EM ON SALE SOMETIMES FOR BUT BUT UH EIGHTEEN 
NINETEEN EURO AND THAT'S FOR THE MULTI FUNCTIONS UH D. V. D. V. C. R. UH CATCH ALLS 
AND AND THEY HAVE 'EM IN A LITTLE BOX IN THE MIDDLE AND AND THIS IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO TO ME TO MARKET THIS A T ONLY A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL WE HAVE TO CHANGE CONSCIOUSNESS 
WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WILL CHANGE PEOPLE'S THINKING TO IDENTIFY THIS AS ADVANTAGEOUS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS 
IT'S GOTTA BE LOW COST ARE HIGH COST WITH WITH SPECIAL DESIGN FEATURES 
OR MY IDEA 
I MEAN I I WILL WE GO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER AND NOW 
I LIKE IT 
I LIKE THE IDEA BUT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO FIND OUT 
WELL 
MM 
WELL I THINK AGAIN IT'S IT WE HAVE A COST ISSUE HERE 
YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA GO ON THIS DIRECTION TO UM WE'RE GOING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COST RANGE 
ARE WE GONNA MAKE THIS SELLING SELLING THE COST IS A HIGH HIGH TECH UH UM ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE WHATEVER 
OR ARE WE GONNA GO TO THE LOWER SIDE OF THE RANGE 
AGAIN I DON'T USE OUR MARKET NICHE IN THE MIDDLE FOR OUR PRODUCT YET 
I DON'T USE IT YET 
W A QUESTION I HAVE IN IN A 'CAUSE I I I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU NO WE GOTTA MAKE IT A BOX 
THE BOX IS GONNA SELL IT I THINK THE OUTSIDE THE CASING 
CAN CAN CAN WE HAVE MULTIPLE DESIGNS 
HAVE A MODERN HAVE A TRADITIONAL HAVE A YOU KNOW AND SO SO INSTEAD OF THEM ALL LIKING THE SAME 
PEOPLE CAN HAVE MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT DESIGNS THEY CAN CHOOSE FROM 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT CREATES COST OR 
YEP ONE OVER ANOTHER 
YEAH OKAY I HEAR THAT 
WHAT AB WHAT AB WHAT ABOUT A 
A REMOTE THAT'S THAT DOESN'T MAYBE LIKE LIKE A REMOTE 
JUST AN IDEA 
JUST JUST OKAY 'CAUSE I MEAN WE ALL KNOW WHAT A REMOTE LOOKS LIKE IN THE OUTSIDE 
THEY'RE SELLING THESE THINGS EVERYWHERE 
MAYBE THAT COULD BE PART OF OUR DESIGN EXCLUSIVITY IS WE MAKE A REMOTE THAT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE A REMOTE TO IT OPENS LIKE A TELEPHONE 
DOESN'T MATTER YEAH 
I'M JUST JUS I TALKING ABOUT SOME SOMETHING TO MAKE THIS THING UNIQUE 
IT THAT'S THE THING I'M GONNA KEEP THUMPING ON 
I'LL SELL WHATEVER YOU GUYS DESIGN 
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM SELLING A PRODUCT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE 
I GIVE YOU IDEAS YOU GUYS CREATE THE PRODUCT 
ONCE YOU HAVE THE FINISHED PRODUCT I'LL FIND A WAY TO SELL IT 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT 
I JUST GIVE YOU THESE THINGS NOW BECAUSE THESE ARE MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS 
NO NO 
ONE THING I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE SAYING THAT 
SO THAT THE P OUR TARGET MARKET IS GONNA BE SOMEONE WHO HAS LOST OR BROKEN WE GOTTA STOP 
WHO'S LOST OR BROKEN THEIR THEIR REMOTE 
SO HOW MANY REMOTES DO THEY WANNA BUY 
CAN WE P CAN WE SELL THEM A REMOTE THAT CAN MAYBE GUARANTEE THEY WILL NOT NEED TO BUY ANOTHER ONE 
AND SO WITH WITH WITH THIS KIND OF SYSTEM OR LOCATOR OR SOMETHING TO TO THINK ABOUT HOW HAVE PEOPLE BEEN BEEN LOSING OR BREAKING THEIR REMOTE 
HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN 
AND AND THEN AND THEN DESIGN THE PRODUCT MAYBE SOME COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT THAT CAN IDENTIFY THIS IS THE LAST ONE YOU'LL EVER NEED TO BUY 
UH WE CAN MAKE IT IN THE SHAPE OF A COFFEE POT 
IT'S UH JUST IT'S THAT I THINK IT'S TELLING US TO STOP OUR MEETING 
SO WE HAVE THE C WE PROBABLY HAVE HAVE ONE LINE IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEM WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
A CHARGING SYSTEM 
IF IF WE CAN CREATE THIS WE HAVE PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX OR SEVEN REALLY STRONG MARKETING CHARACTERISTICS 
NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT I WANT 
UH LOOK AT HERE 
YEAH BU BUT WE WE'RE DESIGNING ONLY THE REMOTE WE NOT DESIGN THE T. V. 
SO UH WE'RE GONNA BE REMOVING THE TELETEXT OUT OF ANY T. V. 
THAT WE PEOPLE USE OUR REMOTE WITH 
SO IT'S KIND OF A STUPID DECISION 
SO THEN THE DOUBLE R. WILL BE OR OR 
I TH I TH I TH 
I THINK ROL RO ROLLS ROYCE MIGHT MIND BUT DON'T WORRY 
YES 
I 
HEY MOUSE 
OPEN 
WHEN WE'RE FIGHTING OVER IT'S ALSO MORE LOT MORE FUN 
OH 
THIS DOESN'T WORK 
SO YEAH FUNCTION DESIGN 
UM YOU GUYS KNOW ME PEDRO AND UM 
WHAT I FOUND SO WE WANT TO DO FASHION AND I THINK HONESTLY WE SHOULD KEEP TECHNOLOGY LOW AND JUST SIMPLE BASICALLY AND TRY TO AIM FOR DESIGN 
IF BASICALLY A CASE WILL WILL COST THE SAME IF IT LOOKS GOOD OR BAD 
SO WE UM WE HAVE TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD 
UM SOMETHING CUTE AND SMALL 
THE BIG CHUNKY REMOTES ARE DIED ON THE EIGHTIES 
SO WE SHOULD JUST GO FOR SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WILL LIKE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT 
AND UM ALTHOUGH MO MOST PEOPLE WILL BUY SO 
TELEVISIONS AND EVERYTHING FOR UH THAT HAVE LOADS OF LOADS OF LITTLE FUNCTIONS AND EVERYTHING AND THEY MOSTLY END UP USING SIMPLE FUNCTIONS AND LITTLE THINGS AND MOST THE PEOPLE WON'T WON'T GET IT MADE OF ACTUALLY HAVING TO GO THE AT THE S AT THE TELEVISION IT 
FOR INSTANCE TUNE IN THERE THE STATIONS 
THERE'S NO NEED TO HAVE THAT IN THE REMOTE 
SO UM 
UM SO FOR WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR UH THE THE INTERFACE DESIGN AND UH I WILL CHANGE THE COLOURS ON THE ON THE LOGO 
BUT UM WE SHOULD GO FOR THE USER ORIENTED DEVICE AS SIMPLE CONTROLS AND GOOD ERGONOMICS 
UM AND UH ALTHOUGH I TH I TH I'M STILL HERE RECOMMENDING THE TELETEXT IS I'LL REMOVE THAT I GUESS BUT UM WE SHOULD GO FOR THE 
YEAH 
YEAH TH THEY'RE BASICALLY AIMING AT SAYING THAT YOU WOULD SO YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TELETEXT TO BE THE EASIEST WAY TO CHECK LIKE FOR UH UH THE SCHEDULING AND THE NEXT PROGRAMME AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND NOW 
YEAH AND NOW YOU CAN C LOOK AT OVER INTERNET 
BUT I STILL THINK TELETEXT IS WAY MORE CONVENIENT UNTIL UNTIL WE HAVE THE SAME COMMODITIES 
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT HAPPEN YET 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WE WE DON'T WE'RE NOT AIMING A COMMAND FOR THAT 
THAT'S THE THING 
AND ALL OF THOSE REQUIRE THE OTHER COMMANDS WITH MORE COMPLEXITY AND MORE SOFTWARE AND 
YEAH BUT WE WOULD INCREASE THE PRICE TO TRY TO MAKE IT A TRAINABLE ONE IS 
WELL I DUNNO 
NO WAY THE OTHER TELETEXT WAS THERE BUT I GUESS WE CAN REMOVE IT OR YOU KNOW MAKE TWO SEPARATE INTERFACE DESIGNS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WE'RE NOT PUTTING SOME THERE'S NO NO PUTTING ANYTHING IN IN THE PLACE OF TELETEXT 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
YEAH 
NO JUST I I WOULD I WOULD ADVOCATE FOR CONTINUING TELETEXT AND THIS WOULD BE THE BASIC COMMANDS 
UM SO FOR YOU KNOW THE THE CASE DESIGN UH MAYBE I'LL COME UP WITH MORE CONCRETE IDEAS 
RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST THE IDEA OF SIMPLICITY AND SLICKNESS CUTE AND SMALL UM 
YEAH 
YEAH MM 
MM-HMM 
BUT WE TH THAT SHOULD BE DESIGN 
THAT SHOULD BE THE DESIGN BASICALLY 
I THINK TECHNOLOGY WE'D W WE'RE NOT IN THE PRICE RANGE TO DO IT 
WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT TOWARDS OUT OF TECHNOLOGY SO WE SHOULD WE SHOULD AIM TO DESIGN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH Y Y Y YOU WOULDN'T 
THE INTERFACE WILL BE DIFFERENT 
GOOD DESIGN 
UH WE SHOULD KEEP IT SIMPLE MM MEDIUM LOW COST MORE UM COST OR AND UH MAKE IT LOOK GOOD 
YEAH COMPLICATED BUT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH THEY ARE NOT SIMPLE 
YEAH 
YEP 
ALRIGHT WELL WE GOT SOME EXCITING STUFF FOR YOU GUYS 
OR NOT 
ALL READY 
WE DO 
ALRIGHT 
I GUESS I'LL GO FIRST 
YEAH 
COMPONENT I THINK 
YEAH 
YEP THAT'S IT 
MY NAME IS 
MY NAME IS NAME 
SORRY I DID THIS IN A BIT OF A RUSH 
SO SO HERE'S A LOOK INSIDE YOUR REALLY OLD LOOKING REMOTE CONTROL 
UM YOU'VE GOT A PRINTED A PRINTED UH CIRCUIT BOARD HERE 
AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE BUTTONS WHICH KINDA PRESS DOWN LITTLE RUBBER NUBBIES INTO THIS LITTLE HOLES THAT ACTIVATE 
YEAH WE'VE ALL BROKEN A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO YOU'VE ALSO GOT UM YOU'VE GOT YOUR CHIP HERE YOUR BATTERIES HERE AND SOME SORTA ELECTRONICS 
UM 
WELL SO YOU'VE GOT HERE'S HERE'S A TRANSISTOR AND THIS AMPLIFIES YOUR SIGNAL 
UM YOU'VE GOT THE L. E. D. HERE IN THE END OF THE UH UH IN THE END OF THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD 
UM YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE DIODES HERE FOR I DON'T KNOW WHO AND WHATNOT 
SO EXACTLY 
SO UM WE'VE GOT A I IN THIS IN THIS UH DRAWING UH UH IN THIS EXAMPLE HERE THIS IS A EIGHTEEN PIN UM UH CHIP I DUNNO 
UH IT'S TWO DOUBLE A. BATTERIES 
THIS IS PRETTY STANDARD REMOTE 
SO HERE ARE OPTIONS FOR OUR POWER SOURCES 
YOU CAN USE A BASIC BATTERY WHICH WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED 
UM THE OUR TECH DEPARTMENT ALSO SAID WE HAVE THE OPTION OF DOING SOME KIND OF HAND DYNAMO WHERE MAYBE YOU CRANK IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S REALLY I DON'T KNOW WE GOT SOME QU CRAZY GUYS DOWN THERE IN THAT DEPARTMENT IS 
YOU SHAKE IT 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S THE NEXT BULLET IS THE UM THE KINETIC PROVISION OF ENERGY SO IT'S LIKE THAT FLASHLIGHT WHERE YOU HAVE TO SHAKE IT 
OH WE'VE GOT SOLAR CELLS 
WHICH I DON'T THINK IS A VERY GOOD IDEA BECAUSE UM YOU COULD NOT USE YOUR REMOTE AT NIGHT WHICH DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE 
AND FINALLY WE'VE GOT OUR CRADLE O OUR POWER CRADLE IDEA 
UM BATTERY VERSUS CRADLE I THINK SO YEAH 
IT COULD BE FINE 
YEAH 
WELL IT IS IT IS MORE UH I MEAN IT IS MORE ECO FRIENDLY THAN THE THEN THE CRADLE 'CAUSE YOU'RE STILL USING POWER OFF THE GRID WITH THE CRADLE 
SO UM 
OUR CASE DESIGN 
WE HAVE UH CHOICES IN MATERIALS AND CHOICES IN THE GENERAL SHAPES THAT WE CAN DO 
OR MATERIAL CHOICES ARE A PLASTIC LATEX UM TY OR PLASTIC A RUBBER LATEX TYPE THING UH WOOD OR TITANIUM 
IF WE GO WITH TITANIUM WE'RE GONNA BE UH LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT OF SHAPES WE CAN DO BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH TO SHAPE THE TITANIUM AND UH 
YEAH PERS 
I THINK WOOD I I I CAN'T SEE ANYBODY WANTING TO USE A WOODEN REMOTE IT'S JUST ANTI TECHNOLOGY REALLY YOU KNOW 
RIGHT 
AND WHAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO AND I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST OPTION IS TO COMBINE SOME A COUPLE OF THIS 
UM MY RECOMMENDATION PERSONALLY WOULD BE TO DO SOME KIND OF A PLASTIC INNER SHELL WITH A LIKE A RUBBER OUTER SHELL 
TO MAKE IT UM TO MAKE UH LIKE A THICK PLASTIC INNER SHELL AND A TO UM KIND OF A TO HAVE THAT RUBBER OUTER SHELL TO MAKE IT MORE DURABLE 
AND ALSO MAYBE I I THINK IT FEELS A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE PLASTIC 
YEAH UM 
YEAH 
THE ADVANTAGES OF WORKING WITH PLASTIC AND RUBBER SO WE WE WE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE UM OPTIONS JUST IN TERMS OF SHAPE BECAUSE YOU CAN EXTRUDE PLASTIC IN BASICALLY ANY SHAPE YOU WANT 
SO UM AND THEN WE CAN COVER YOU KNOW THE BREAKABLE BITS WITH RUBBER YEAH SO UM 
BUT BASICALLY THESE ARE CURVED AND DOUBLE CURVED I I BELIEVE THAT THE TECH DEPARTMENT 
NO OTHER UM IN THEIR MESSAGE TO ME THAT THEY WERE REFERRING TO THE NUMBER OF THE CURVES IN THE BOTTOM 
I HAVE AN IDEA EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME UNCURVED FLAT CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED 
I WOULD GUESS THIS LIKE THIS PEN WOULD BE KINDA LIKE A DOUBLE CURVED WHERE IT'S CURVED IN M M MULTIPLE AXES RIGHT 
I THINK CURVED MEANS JUST CURVED IN ONE AXIS AND DOUBLE CURVED IS CURVED ONE TWO AXES 
OR SURFACES 
I HAVE AN IDEA 
OH OKAY UH LIKE A WAVE OKAY 
ALRIGHT THAT MAKES SENSE OKAY 
UM OKAY WITH THE INTERFACE WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS WE CAN U WE CAN USE PUSH BUTTONS 
WE CAN USE A SCROLL WHEEL WITH AN INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTON AND L. C. D. DISPLAY OR MULTIPLE SCROLLING WHEELS 
UM SO THESE ARE ALL OPTIONS THAT THE USER INTERFACE GUY CAN UH HAS TO HIS DISPOSAL TO PUT TOGETHER A USER INTERFACE 
FOR ELECTRONICS WE HAVE THIS VERY TECHNICAL UM DESCRIPTIONS HERE 
A SIMPLE CHIP WHICH IS THE LAST EXPENSIVE BUT I HAVE NO NUMBERS TO GIVE YOU A REGULAR CHIP 
WHICH IS LIKE THE MEDIUM PORRIDGE THE MEDIUM EXPENSE UH 
YES THE DIFFERENCE IS WITH A SIMPLE CHIP A SIMPLE CHIP WILL OPERATE UH WHY DOESN'T THESE SCROLL UP 
PREVIOUS PREVIOUS OKAY 
A SIMPLE CHIP IS REQUIRED TO OPERATE PUSH BUTTONS 
UM AN ADVANCED CHIP IS REQUIRED TO TO OPERATE UM THE L. C. D. DISPLAY AND IT DIDN'T SAY SPECIFICALLY 
BUT I I HAVE A HUNCH THAT A REGULAR CHIP IS GONNA BE THE SCROLL WHEEL AND THE MULTIPLE SCROLL WHEELS 
SO BUT YEAH 
THAT'S THE END OF MY PRESENTATION 
I THINK 
NO 
OF THE T. V. IS WORKING YEAH 
THAT'S JUST I MEAN IT'LL IF SOMEBODY SAYS UP ON THE MIDDLE OF A 
TELEVISION SHOW IT'S GONNA CHANGE THE CHANNEL 
SO 
WELL THEN WHY DON'T YOU JUST PRESS THE UP BUTTON 
EVEN STILL THERE'S GONNA BE INTERF TH THERE'S THERE STILL WILL BE INTERFERENCE FROM THE T. V. 
IT MIGHT NOT BE IT MIGHT NOT BE COMPLETELY CONFUSING BUT I THINK YOU'LL STILL Y IT'S STILL I DON'T THINK IT'S PRACTICAL AT ALL 
I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA FRANKLY 
THAT I WOULD BELIEVE 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S NOT A SCROLL WHEEL 
RIGHT 
INSTEAD OF PLAY STOP REWIND AND FAST FORWARD THERE THAT'S UP DOWN LOUDER AND QUIETER 
TREND WATCHING HAS A LATER DATE THERE 
OR YOU TALKING ABOUT THE PICTURE 
THAT'S NOT OUR THAT'S NOT OUR B DESIGN 
THAT'S JUST A THAT'S JUST SOMETHING UH A A GRAPHIC HE USED TO SHOW YOU THE LAYOUT OF WHAT THE LAYOUT OF THE BUTTONS MIGHT BE LIKE 
WHAT'S SPECIAL AND UNIQUE ABOUT A SCROLL 
WELL RIGHT I THINK THE TWO BIG THE POINTS THAT WE HAVE AS FAR ARE THE HAVING THE CRADLE AND ALSO HAVING UH THE UM THE ACTUAL DESIGN OF THE UH CASE ITSELF HAVING LIKE THIS LIKE RUBBER SHELL MAYBE WITH A PLASTIC INTERIOR 
HAVING TO LOOK REALLY NICE UM AND ALSO BE REALLY DURABLE 
RIGHT YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL LET'S GET A PRODUCT THEN 
WELL MY QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD THE SCROLL WHEEL DO 
FUNCTION WISE WHAT DOES THAT DO THAT 
YEAH 
WELL IT'S IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING THAT THE BUTTONS DO 
YEAH 
TH THEY ARE GONNA BE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IN THE OTHER HAND I MEAN IT 
I MEAN IT IS AN ALTERNATIVE IF IF YOU THINK THAT'S GONNA SELL SOME SOME UH YOU KNOW IF IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE UP THE EXTRA COST BY EXTRA SALES I THINK MAYBE IT'S WORTH IT TO DO IT 
BUT I MEAN I WOULD JUST SO IF I WAS GONNA DO THIS I WOULD JUST USE THE SCROLL WHEEL FOR US CHANNELS UP AND CHANNELS DOWN 
I DON'T THINK VOLUME OR DO YOU THINK VOLUME WOULD BE 
NO WE CAN WE CAN DO MULTIPLE SCROLL WHEELS BUT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I'M THINKING YEAH SOMETHING LIKE KINDA ALMOST LIKE THESE PENS YOU KNOW 
WHERE THERE'S YOU HAVE PLASTIC BITS AND THEN IT'S NOT REALLY RUBBER BUT JUST KINDA LIKE A FUSED THE PLASTIC WITH RUBBER ON THE OUTSIDE 
WELL NO UM YEAH MAYBE A BIT MORE THAN THE S IN HERE BUT JU JUST AS A KIND OF AN INSPIRATION 
THESE PENS I THINK ARE ARE KIND OF 
OR FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK L. C. D. IS A MISTAKE BECAUSE THIS IS A UNIVERSAL REMOTE AND ALL YOU'RE DOING I MEAN IT'S YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY INFORMATION BACK FROM THE TELEVISION 
SO THE ONLY INFORMATION YOU CAN DISPLAY ON THIS REMOTE IS WHAT CHANNEL YOU JUST SENT TO AT LEAST AND THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION 
YOU KNOW THERE 
IT RECEIVES NO INFORMATION 
SO I I DON'T SEE ANY REASON FOR HAVING AN L. C. D. 'CAUSE IT'S AN INCREASED COST 
UNLESS YOU CAN THINK OF SOMETHING INTERESTING TO DO WITH IT 
RIGHT 
WELL WE HAVE TO I THINK FOR ME IT'S STILL NOT EXACTLY CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE INTER USER INTERFACE IS GONNA BE 
THERE'S THE SCROLL WHEEL ON OR IT 
WHAT DO YOU GUYS LIKE IN THE USER INTERFACE 
WELL I DUNNO ABOUT LIKE THE FLIP PHONE IDEA BECAUSE I THINK SO FAR AS DURABILITY TH IT'S NOT A BIG WELL MAYBE WHEN IT'S CLOSED 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WELL 
THE 
THE LOCATOR'S GONNA REQUIRE A RADIO TRANSMITTER WHICH WILL 
UM WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH A LIKE A MEDIUM CHIP SO I WOULD IMAGINE 
BUT W I WE WILL NEED A RECEIVER AN ANTENNA 
YEAH 
IT SHOULD BE A REALLY SIMPLE SIGNAL THOUGH SO 
THAT'S TRUE YEAH 
OH YEAH YEAH 
IT'LL BE REALLY CHEAP 
SO THE SCROLL WHEEL 
ONE OR IT 
FOR UM I THINK THE SCROLL WHEEL ACTUALLY MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD 
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE INCREASED COST IS GONNA BE BUT I THINK HE DOES HAVE A POINT 
I IT MIGHT PUSH SOMEBODY OVER THE EDGE WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT OUR TO OUR REMOTE VERSUS SOMETHING ELSE 
WHEN THEY USE THIS ONE HAS A SCROLL WHEEL TO GO UP AND DOWN ON THE CHANNELS 
I THINK IT MIGHT BE KINDA NOT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT LIKE THAT 
SURE 
WELL I THINK WH WHAT IT WOULD BE SO LIKE LIKE THE UM LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S MAYBE YOU KNOW A DIGITAL 
WHEEL RIGHT WHERE IT'S WHERE IT'S QUANTIZED INTO YOU KNOW CERTAIN 
THAT WAS THAT WAS MY MY INTUITION OF WHAT THE SCROLL WHEEL WOULD BE 
IT'S JUST IT'S BASICALLY IT IT'S JUST A F LOOK AND FEEL THING 
IT HAS THE SAME EXACT FUNCTIONALITY IS TWO BUTTONS 
YEAH 
NOW JUST JUST SO YOU KNOW THOUGH UH YOU DID BRING UP A POINT WHICH IS VERY VALID 
IS A LOT OF T. V. S WON'T OR THE T. V. S WON'T RESPOND EXACTLY THE SAME 
SOME OF THEM ARE GONNA BE KINDA SLOW SWITCHING SO YOU MAY LIKE QUEUE UP LIKE FIFTEEN CHANNEL CHANGES AND IT'LL BE LIKE FLIP FLIP FLIP 
BUT 
RIGHT 
YEAH IT JUST MIGHT BE FRUSTRATING WHERE YOU CAN'T MAKE IT GO AS FAST AS YOU WANT 
BUT I THINK ONCE PEOPLE GET USED TO IT I I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF THE SCROLL WHEEL THOUGH 
I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU MIGHT BE GETTING IT OR OR 
WELL WHAT ABOUT THIS WHAT ABOUT IF YOU CAN PROGRAMME IN YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS INTO THIS SCROLL WHEEL AND YOU CAN JUST LIKE ROLL THROUGH YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS 
AND IT C IT 
WHY 
IT'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOU FLIP THE CHANNEL ON THE T. V. 
YEAH 
WELL YOU JUST IT'S AN EXTRA BUTTON 
YOU SAY PROGRAMME START AND THEN TYPE IN 'CAUSE YOU STILL HAVE THE TYPING YOU KNOW YOU'LL STILL HAVE THE KEYPAD WHERE YOU CAN TYPE 'EM IN MANUALLY 
SO PROGRAMME START ZERO ONE ENTER ZERO FIVE ENTER THIRTY EIGHT ENTER PROGRAMME AND 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH WELL WE ALSO HAVE TO DETERMINE IN SOME MANNER HOW TO SWITCH BETWEEN MODES BETWEEN GOING THROUGH YOUR FAVOURITES LIST AND JUST HITTING UP IN P TWO 
NO BECAUSE YOU WANNA BE ABLE TO GO UP AND DOWN THROUGH THE CHANNELS 
RIGHT 
I THINK WE'LL NEED A WE'LL NEED A MODE SWITCH BUT THEN IF WE HAVE A MODE SWITCH WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME KINDA INDICATOR 
IT WHICH AN L. E. AN L. E. D. OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
JUST SO YOU KNOW I THINK I MEAN IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT BEFORE WE WERE GONNA STAY IN THE MID MARKET RANGE 
IT SEEMS WE'RE KIND OF APPROACHING A HIGHER END RANGE 
I WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S OKAY WITH THAT 
OKAY 
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S ON BOARD WITH IT 
SO 
RIGHT 
WELL Y YEAH 
LET'S LET'S TRY AND THINK NOW HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR WITH ALL THESE FEATURES HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY IF YOU WANT TO THE STEREO 
AND YOU WERE IN THE MARKET F TO REPLACE YOUR T. V. REMOTE HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR THAT 
I'M JUST ASKING YOU 
IF 
THEN YOU COULD PROBABLY AFFORD THIS 
OH NO NO 
I WOULD SAY THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
WITH A CRADLE RADIO TRANSMITTERS 
AND BACK LIT BUTTONS 
AND IT'S GONNA LOOK SEXY 
OR NOT 
IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE CLAY 
PROBABLY 
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE DONE IF WE CAN GO EARLIER 
YEAH 
I DON'T THINK SO 
IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WE'LL JUST EMAIL YOU I GUESS 
AFTERNOON GUYS 
IT'S GONNA BE 
OH 
'KAY 
WE MAY DO 
I DUNNO I'M FEELING LIKE A BIG BOY 
'KAY READY TO GO 
'KAY SO WE'VE GOT OUR CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING 
HOPEFULLY WE'VE ALL GOT EXCITING IDEAS NOW 
OH K EXCITING IDEAS 
'KAY SO HERE'S OUR AGENDA OUR AGENDA 
UM 
I'M GONNA OPEN 
I'M GONNA TALK FOR A BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO 
I'M GONNA TAKE SOME NOTES 
WE'RE GONNA ALL DO A PRESENTATION AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOME DECISIONS NOW 
YEP 
WELL WHEN I SAY HOPEFULLY WE HAVE TO 
SO 
I'M GONNA LET YOU GUYS TALK BEFORE WE MAKE DECISIONS 
AND DOES ANYONE REALLY WANT TO GO FIRST 
YOU P TWO 
WHAT'S 
COMPONENTS DESIGN 
YOUR NAME IS NAME 
HUH HI NAME 
RIGHT 
WE'VE ALL BROKE A REMOTE CONTROL OR UM SO YEAH 
YOU PRESS THIS AND IT DOES THE 
I DUNNO WHO AND WHATNOT 
'KAY 
OKAY 
'KAY 
MM 'KAY 
OKAY SO WE BASICALLY HAVE BATTERY VERSUS CRADLE HERE 
OKAY 
SO WE HAVE BATTERY VERSUS CRADLE 
IT'S ACTUALLY A NOVEL THING BECAUSE YOU COULD SELL IT A AS A NOVELTY JUST TO BE ACTUALLY SERIOUS FOR A MINUTE HERE YOU COULD 
MM 
HMM 
WOOD WOOD WOULD GO WOULD GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A MARKETING NICHE WOULDN'T IT 
NAH 
OKAY 
HMM 
OKAY 
'KAY 
DO YOU GOT A GOOD GRIP ON THE RUBBER 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
I THINK IT MIGHT MEAN SOMETHING LIKE THAT SORTA SHAPE BECAUSE A DOUBLE CURVE RATHER THAN A YEAH THAT'S WHAT 
OKAY 
DO DO WE HAVE ACTUALLY ANY CONCEPT OF WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN A SIMPLE CHIP AND AN ADVANCED CHIP 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE 
SO PRESENTATION FROM 
I GUESS DESIGN WOULD GO BEST 
NEXT 
TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS ARE INTERFACE CONCEPT 
YEAH THAT'S IT 
YES BUT IT HAS YOUR NAME ON IT 
BUT WHAT IF YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO PRESS A BUTTON TO MAKE IT RECOGNIZE 
SO IF YOU PRESSED IT AND WENT UP 
MINE YEAH 
BUT IF IT'S JUST ONE THING WITH A BUTTON THAT YOU CAN JUST GO 
UP 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
YOU GUYS KNOW YOUR STUFF 
MM 
SO WE'RE SUGGESTING DOING A SORTA SCROLL WHEEL THING FOR THE VOLUME 
NAH 
OH OKAY OKAY 
I SEE 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
'KAY 
SO ON IT 
Y FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OR TREND WATCHING 
FORTY SIX NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
MM 
UPPER MANAGEMENT SAID YES 
UH E EXCUSE THAT THAT'S A BIT OF SPAM 
IT'S COOL 
I'D I'D SAY THOUGH THAT WE IF WE DID MAKE THE DECISION TO GO WITH THE CRADLE THOUGH 
TH THEN WE HAVE THAT AS WELL BUT W WITH A SIMILAR 
MM 
COURSE 
YEAH 'CAUSE THAT'S 
MM 
MM 'KAY 
SO NOW 
SO ARE BIG QUESTIONS HERE REALLY OR 
CRADLE OR NOT CRADLE 
DO WE GO BASIC OR DO WE GO FOR FEATURES 
UH D DOES ANYONE REALLY WANNA DO ANYTHING WITH THE SCROLL WHEEL OR SHOULD WE DITCH THAT OFF HAND FIRST 
UH ABOUT THAT WAS IN YOUR PRESENTATION SO WHA WHAT WOULD YOU IMAGINE IT DOING 
MM 'KAY 
YEAH 
WHAT I UNDERSTAND ABOUT SCROLL WHEELS SO THEY'RE THEY'RE QUITE EXPENSIVE TO TO MAKE 
SO I D 
WELL I D I LIKE THE IDEA OF BASICALLY FOCUSING THE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS FOCUSING THE P THE PRODUCT IN THE IDEA OF THE UH THE CASE THE THE UH 
DOCK TO PUT IT ON IT TO CHARGE IT 
WE CAN TARGET LIKE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY IDEAS THAT SORTA THINGS 
IT SO I M MAKES IT EASY TO MARKET IT'S EASY TO DIFFERENTIATE THE PRODUCT YEAH SO 
AND IF WE WE KEEP THE REST IN A FORMAT THAT IS DURABLE BECAUSE THE THE THE WHOLE PRODUCT'S GONNA NEED TO BE MORE DURABLE TH THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE DITCHING IT AS OFTEN 
IT'S GONNA NEED TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OF THE CRADLE 
SO IF WE CAN MARKET IT IN TERMS OF THAT AND YEAH WELL 
SO ARE BIG DECISION THEN IS LIKE HOW DO WE DO UM LIKE WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE DETAILS AND WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WELL N NOT EXACTLY THE DETAILS 
BUT DO DO WE HAVE UH 
WHAT TYPE OF CASING 
I PERSONALLY LIKE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT THE PLASTIC WITH THE RUBBER 
OKAY 
JUST A VERY THIN SORTA SHEET FOR A A GRIP SORTA THING OR FOUR 
OKAY 
SO THEN IF WE D D DO WE WANT TO DO ANYTHING MORE BASIC WITH THE UH MORE ADVANCED WITH THE USER INTERFACE IN TERMS OF DO WE WANT TO GO FOR UM BUTTONS 
OR DO WE WANT IF WE'RE DITCHING THE SCROLL WHEELS DO WE WANT TO GO L. C. D. 
DO WE WANT TO GIVE DO WE WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING ELSE ON IT 
OKAY 
OKAY SO THE QUESTION IS NOW I GUESS WE NEED TO IT 
DECIDE ON WELL Y YOU GUYS BASICALLY HAVE TO NOW GO AND 
FIGURE OUT THE DETAILS OF THIS THING 
SO 
WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW IN TERMS OF MARKETING AND UH PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARE ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER NOW BEFORE YOU GUYS CAN GO AND BUILD THIS 
WHAT WHAT OVERALL THINGS HAVE WE NOT DECIDED ON 
I THINK MAYBE IN TERMS OF MARKETING IS THAT GONNA MAKE ENOUGH OF A DIFFERENCE TO JUSTIFY THE COST 
YEAH AND I GUESS THE THE THE QUESTION TH TH THAT YOU'RE BEING ASKED RIGHT NOW IS WHETHER IS THE DOCK ENOUGH OF A UNIQUE FEATURE TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND SELL THAT A A AS A A VERY DIFFERENT PRODUCT 
OR DO WE REALLY NEED THE SCROLL WHEEL AS WELL 
BECAUSE THE SCROLL WHEEL COMES TO QUITE A COST 
THAT'S GONNA ONE IS THAT GONNA NEED A BETTER CHIP AS WELL 
AND IT'S PRESUMABLY GONNA NEED A LITTLE SPEAKER ON IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS WELL TO BEEP 
BUT I GUESS A LITTLE TINY SPEAKER IS GONNA BE QUITE CHEAP IT'S NOT GONNA NEED Q QUALITY IS IT 
IT'S 
MAKES YOUR LIVING ROOM MORE FRESH AS YOU WATCH 
OKAY WE'RE DOING WELL FOR TIME HERE 
UM WE'VE GOT ABOUT ANOTHER TEN MINUTES 
I THINK THAT UH 
MM PR MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS IT 
I DON'T THINK THE COST IS JUSTIFIED FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE UNIQUENESS WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE THAT 
AND I DON'T SEE THINK IT'S OBVIOUS AND NATURAL HOW IT WOULD BE USED 
MM 
BUT THEN THAT THAT SURELY D DEPENDS A LITTLE ON THE T. V. BECAUSE SOME T. V. S ARE QUITE SLOW AT CHANGING CHANNELS FROM LIKE SO IF YOU'VE GOT A SCROLL WHEEL AND YOU SEE YOU HAVE TO SCROLL SCROLL IT REALLY REALLY SLOWLY JUST SO THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY KEEPING IN PACE WITH THE T. V. 'S ABILITY TO TO CHANGE CHANNELS 
OR DO YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND YOU WAIT FOR IT 
YOU SCROLL IT A BUNCH OF TIMES AND YOU WAIT FOR IT IT 
MM 
UH I SEE I SEE 
THAT'S WHERE YOU 
UH I SEE I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW 
OKAY 
YEAH IF YOU'RE JUST SITTING THERE GOING 
THAT'S KINDA COOL ACTUALLY 
I LIKE THAT 
WELL NOT N NECESSARILY 
YOU COULD BASICALLY MAKE IT IS THAT IT'LL I MEAN IT'S JUST GONNA BE SENDING A SIGNAL TO THE T. V. YEAH THE T. V. 'S GE SO IF YOU SEND ABOUT FIVE FLIP CHANNELS 
IF YOU DID THAT IT'S GONNA FLIP ONCE 
IF YOU DO THAT 
OTHER THAN CLICK CLICK CLICK 
YEAH 
AND IF WE'RE MARKETING TO USE A HIGH NICHE PRODUCT THEN WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING GOOD T. V. S AS WELL YEAH PRESUMABLY 
PRIMARILY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH I SEE SO IF MAYBE IF WE HAD AN L. C. D. UP THE TOP THAT JUST ADD A NUMBER IN IT RIGHT 
AND THEN IT THAT BASICALLY 
MM 
WELL THAT'S QUITE COOL 
YOU'D NEED A DISPLAY ON THE THE THE THING 
OH YEAH YEAH NO I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
YEAH THAT'S KINDA COOL 
HOW WOULD YOU PROGRAM IT THOUGH 
OKAY OKAY 
OKAY AND YEAH AND THAT JUST BASICALLY FLIPS BETWEEN IT AND IT'LL GO TO SENDS OUT ZERO 
FIVE AND THEN THIRTY SIX AND THEN ZERO ONE AGAIN 
YEAH THAT'S KINDA COOL 
I LIKE THAT 
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE TOO EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA BE YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO NAB THAT OFF OF COMPUTER MOUSE MANUFACTURERS REALLY 
YOU COULD BASICALLY CAME UP WITH A PARTNERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THAT QUITE CHEAPLY 
MIGHT BE BUT TH THAT'S NOT GONNA BE SUCH A COSTLY FEATURE 
THE PROBLEM WE'RE GONNA HAVE IS MAKING IT ROBUST 
MAKING AT LEAST 
SO IF THERE'S A BUTTON FOR EACH TYPE 
YEAH PEOPLE ARE GONNA HAVE THEIR FAVOURITE SORTA WHETHER THEY DO THAT OR WHETHER THEY 
YEAH YEAH THE MODE SWITCH 
JUST THE LIGHTS BEHIND THE BUTTONS 
YOU COULD HAVE BACK LIT BUTTONS MAYBE 
WOULD THAT WORK 
SO THAT OKAY WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES 
SO RIGHT DETAILS TH THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE OR THAT WE WANT A SCROLL WHEEL 
WE WANT A MODE INDICATOR 
WE WENT BACK LIT BUTTONS 
AND IF WE'RE MAKING BACK LIT BUTTONS PERIOD 
DO WE WANT THAT JUST FOR THE MODE INDICATOR OR MAYBE TO INDICATE WHAT BUTTON YOU'RE PRESSING AT THE TIME 
SO THAT YOU KNOW IF IT'S ACTUALLY PRESSED OR NOT 
I'VE SEEN SOME REMOTES DO THAT 
I THINK WE ARE YEAH 
YEAH WELL WE DON'T HAVE IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE MORE MONEY WE CAN PUSH UP THE THE PRICE 
YEAH 
'KAY 
YEAH 
SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE EASIER USE IT WHAT WE CAN PUSH THE COST UP TO 
THOUGH WE HAVEN'T GOT IT A STAGE WHERE WE'RE READY TO PIN DOWN THE PRICE OF COMPONENTS 
BUT I'D SAY WHAT SORTA PRICE ARE WE LOOKING TO BE ABLE TO SELL SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WHAT SORTA PRICE CAN WE MAKE IT FOR 
YEAH NO I I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY SHOULD BE MORE FLEXIBLE THAN ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE SO WE SAID IN THE LAST MEETING 
OR MANAGEMENT IS REALLY LOOKING FOR US TO PUSH OUR BRAND 
WE'RE ENTERING A NEW MARKET HERE SO I THINK THE THE PROFIT EXPECTATION FOR THIS ONE PRODUCT SO MAYBE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS BEING ABLE TO 
BUT THE WHAT'S OUR BALLPARK AS TO WHAT WE'D BE ABLE TO SELL SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR 
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA THINK WHO OUR TARGET MARKET IS BECAUSE I I'M NOT OUR TARGET MARKET 
I'M A STUDENT BUT 
IN THE OTHER HAND I WOULD THINK 
MM WITH MY PROJECT MANAGER SALARY I WOULD THINK YEAH I COULD PROBABLY AFFORD THIS UH WOULD I BUY IT 
MAYBE 
IF I HAD A COOL NEW T. V. AND THIS WAS ARE LOOKING REALLY SLICK AND IT HAD THE DOCK AND IT HAD THE SCROLL WHEEL 
WHICH I THINK'S A REALLY COOL IDEA THAT WOULD SELL ME ON IT A LITTLE 
THEN MAYBE YOU KNOW 
I D I DON'T THINK I'D GO OVER A HUNDRED EURO CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE WAY TOO MUCH 
BUT TH I WOULD BE HAPPY PAYING OVER FORTY FOR IT I GUESS BUT NOT MUCH 
'KAY 
THIRTY FIVE TO FIFTY EUROS IS OUR SALES BRACKET OKAY 
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WE C WE MAKE IT FOR 
MM 
THAT'S WHY THE SCROLL NEEDS TO BE REALLY ROBUST 
YEP 
OKAY 
THE NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES ALTHOUGH DOES IT 
IT STARTS AT THREE TWENTY IN THE NEXT MEETING 
SO WE'VE GOT MORE THAN A THIRTY MINUTES 
UM WE'VE GOT MORE LIKE FIFTY 
THE THE N NEXT MEETING IS THREE TWENTY ONE YEAH 
YEAH THAT IS 
UH THEY'VE THEY'VE CHANGED THE TIMES FROM THE PRESENTATIONS 
OKAY SO YOU GUYS WILL BE GETTING YOUR MODELLING DONE NOW AND UH 
OKAY ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO WHAT THIS THING'S GONNA DO LIKE LIKE 
HOW IT'S GONNA WORK THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE WE REALLY LOOK AT THIS IN A LOT OF DETAIL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THIS ONE WAS QUITE EASY 
ALWAYS THE OPTIMIST 
'KAY THANKS GUYS 
ROCK AND ROLL 
SO DO WE NEED TO RE TRAIN MIKE ON HOW TO PUT HIS MIC ON 
OKAY CAN UH GET IT ALL BY HIMSELF THIS TIME 
SO 
I BELIEVE I CAN FLY 
JUST WHAT I NEEDED WAS SOMETHING EXCITING 
REMEMBER I'M AN OLD MAN 
THIRTY'S REALLY YOUNG EH 
JOSE HE MAN SO 
NO NAME 
I'VE 
I JUST LEAVE YOU TECH GUYS HUH 
THEY JUST 
YEAH YOU DO JABBER 
UP 
YEAH 
I I GOTTA I GOTTA FLASHLIGHT AND UH YEAH BUT IT'S INTERESTING 'CAUSE YOU SHAKE IT LIKE THIS 
LIKE THIS 
AND THAT'S IN THE CAMERA 
YEAH 
I G I I FIGURED YOU WOULD 
YES 
YEAH 
IT IT IT 
OH 
UH UH TO UM IN A MARKETING SENSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT RELATIVE 
WE CAN WE CAN O WE CAN UH ACCENTUATE WHATEVER WHATEVER PRODUCT YOU PUT IN THERE WE CAN FIND A WAY TO ACCENTUATE IT 
AND IF YOU MAKE IT FROM THAT SUPER RUBBER WHEN YOU DROP IT IN THE FLOOR IT CAN BOUNCE RIGHT BACK UP ON YOUR HAND 
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO LEAN DOWN TO GET IT 
MM-HMM YEAH THAT'S YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SEE 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I IS ALSO 
OH 
THAT'S RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
I DUNNO 
TREND WATCHING I GUESS 
TREND WATCHING I BELIEVE 
SO WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
IT'S BEEN AS LONG 
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY 
WHEN I SEE WHEN I SEE THE WHEN I SEE THE PRODUCT I I I I DON'T WANNA BUY IT 
I SEE SO MANY OF 'EM OUT THERE 
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THAT PRODUCT THAT MAKES ME WANNA CHOOSE THAT PRODUCT OVER OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 'CAUSE 'CAUSE RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT HOW TO MARKET THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT TO MARKET YET 
AND UH FROM FROM TALKING TO MAKE IS THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE UH WE CAN MARKET A MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCT NOW 
THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND SO HELLO 
AND AND SO YEAH I'M A I'M A LITTLE BIT STUCK RIGHT NOW ON THAT WHAT UH W WHAT IS IT THAT I'M GONNA MARKET 
UH WITHOUT SPECIAL OR INCREASED MARKETABLE FEATURES I DON'T BELIEVE THE PRODUCT HAS A CONSUMER DEMAND 
UH I LIKE THE IDEA OF OF THE SCROLL MAKIN THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE MAKING THESE PRODUCTS AT THIS PRICE RIGHT NOW 
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO TO MAKE THIS ONE SPECIAL AND UNIQUE 
UH WELL I DON'T YEAH IT'S I I JUST USE IT IS DIFFERENT 
I DON'T SAY IT'S SPECIALLY MM 
I DON'T SAY IT'S SPECIAL 
UH I SAY THAT IT'S DIFFERENT I WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR US MARKETING IS UM GIVE ME SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
I GAVE ME A LOWER PRICE GIVE ME A HIGHER PRICE GIVE ME SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY 
DON'T GIVE ME THE SAME THING THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS PUTTING OUT THERE IN THE SHELF IT'S F TO THE SAME PRICE 
I NEED SOMETHING TO MARKET ABOUT THIS THING 
WE'RE WE'RE A NEW FROM 
WHAT I IF WHEN WHEN WE HAVE YEAH WHEN WE WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THE CRADLE OR OR SOMETHING GIVE THAT'S AS AS A MARKETING STANDARD I NEED SOMETHING TO MARKET 
TO MAKE THIS PRODUCT UNIQUE 
YEP 
MM 'KAY 
JUST REMEMBER WHEN I MADE UP THIS REPORT I DIDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE 
AND AND SO SO UH YEAH WHEN WE HAVE A CRADLE WHEN WE HAVE SOME KIND OF DESIGN 
SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT TO MARKET RIGHT NOW 
UM UH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS THAT WE MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENT IN THE COST EITHER LOWER OR DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED NEW TECHNOL TECHNOLOGY 
THAT'S THAT IS THE NEXT STEP THERE'S TECHNOLOGY AND THEN THERE IS TECHNOLOGY WHICH WE'RE MOVING INTO THE NEXT PHASE 
AND SO UH WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE THE MARKETABILITY 
YEAH UH AGAIN I'M NOT SOLD ON THE PRODUCT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT IN MY OPINION YET 
SO I NEED A PRODUCT 
I NEED A PRODUCT TO MARKET 
AND I JUST WHATEVER PRODUCT YOU GUYS PUT TOGETHER WE'LL FIND A WAY TO MARKET IT 
TH THAT I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH 
IF YOU IF YOU GIVE ME IF YOU GIVE ME A CUT OUT OF WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS THEN I NEED TO I NEED TO FIND A LOWER COST 
YEAH WH WH WHAT'S THE WH 
OKAY NOW WHAT I SEE WITH THE SCROLL WHEEL IS EVERYBODY HAS BUTTONS 
SO FROM A MARKETING STANDPOINT I HAVE I HAVE ANOTHER DOOR TO WALK THROUGH WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S UNIQUE 
IF IT CREATES SOMETHING MORE COMPLEX OR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAKES IT UH A MARKETING NECESSITY 
BUT AGAIN FROM A MARKETING PERSPECTIVE I WANT AS MUCH NEW AND DIFFERENT BUT THIS THING IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE C IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
I THINK IT'S THAT'S RIGHT 
I THINK SO 
MM 
YEP 
I THINK WE GOT SOME EXCLUSIVITY IN THAT YOU KNOW WE GOT SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS RIGHT NOW 
AND AND THAT MEANS WE CAN WE CAN MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE RETAIL OR WHOLESALE PRICE IF WE NEED TO AND IT ALSO CAN CREATE IT'S OWN DEMAND FROM IT'S UNIQUENESS 
YEAH 
YEAH RIGHT NOW THERE'S RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOTHING COMING OUT OF THE T. V. TO RECEIVE 
SO YOU KNOW UNLESS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AND INFORMATION STARTS COMING OUT OF THE A CABLE BOX OR SOMETHING THERE'S NO SO I DON'T USE THE 
I DON'T USE THE NECESSITY OF AN L. C. D. THERE 
DON'T USE IT 
AGAIN 
WELL I THINK IT'S IT'S THE MORE UNIQUENESS YOU CAN BRING TO THE PRODUCT THE USER TO SEE I BELIEVE FOR ME TO MARKET 
UH AGAIN THE PUSH BUTTONS I I S OR ARE EVERYWHERE 
AND SO WE CAN GO WITH THE SAME THING BUT WE'RE GONNA BE COM COMPETING IN A IN A BROADER MARKET THEN IF WE GO WITH SOMETHING UNIQUE 
YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING I THOUGHT ABOUT WAS YOU KNOW DO WE GO TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
MAKE A REMOTE THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A REMOTE 
IT'S JUST ANOTHER IT'S JUST A AN IDEA AND I DON'T KNOW 
I MEAN WHAT I SEE ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU BROUGHT UP IN AN EARLIER PRESENTATION SO 
WHEN YOU GOT CHILDREN THEIR THEIR STUFF GETS INSIDE THE CIRCUITRY THEY GET DIRTY THEY GET MESSY WITH DRINKS AND STUFF 
THIS 
AND WHAT I KEEP THROWING OUT THERE I JUST KEEP THROWING IT DOES IT TRY TO MAKE THIS THING LIKE OR ACT OR IN SOME WAY IDENTIFY ITSELF AS UNIQUE OR DIFFERENT 
BUT YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO C ULTIMATELY CREATE THE PRODUCT WITHIN COST 
OH OKAY PHEW 
I THINK YOU GOTTA G GET INTO COST EFFECTIVENESS 
I THINK IF YOU CAN HAVE THE BASE STATION WITH A WITH A LOCATOR 
I THINK THESE ARE TWO VERY STRONG FEATURES OF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED WITHOUT A BUNCH OF EXTRA COST 
MM-HMM 
INTEGRATED YEAH 
SO IT'S JUST UH I I THINK THAT'S 
I KNOW PERSONALLY THAT WOULD BE A VERY ATTRACTIVE FEATURE IS TO HAVE A UH HAVE A BUTTON I CAN PUSH TO FIND MY REMOTE CONTROL 
OR MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK HAVE A A SMELL O RAMA YOU KNOW YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND IT S PUTS OUT A STINK 
YOU CAN 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
I I THINK THERE'S YOU KNOW THAT UH THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE TODAY THAT ARE THAT ARE SURFING ARE TELEVISION SURFERS 
AND I SEE THE SCROLL AS A AS A GREAT MECHANISM FOR SURFING 
INSTEAD OF GOING BUTTON TO BE YOU JUST J YOU'D JA JA JA JA JA JA 
I REALLY I REALLY THINK THAT'S A REALLY COOL THING FOR SURFING 
WELL THERE'S NO 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH I THINK SO 
I I THINK SO 
NOW THE THE ONLY THING I I IN THE INTERFACE SIDE OF IT IS THAT I I I SEE THE DILEMMA 
BUT IF WE HAVE THE OPTION OF OF SCROLLING AT ANY PARTICULAR SPEED OR THE OPTION OF JUMPING DIRECT OKAY 
SO I CAN GO UH PRESUMING I HAVE IN MY TELEVISION 
SOMETHING THAT TELLS ME WHAT CHANNEL I'M NO I CAN SCROLL DIRECT FROM CHANNEL FIVE TO CHANNEL THIRTY TWO 
I KNOW WHAT BECAUSE IT'S IN THE TELEVISION 
THE TELEVISION TELLS ME WHAT CHANNEL IT'S IN WHEN I CHANGE IT 
SO I DON'T KNOW THAT REALLY THAT'S THAT'S GONNA BE A A D PROBLEM 
'CAUSE THE TELEVISION CAN GO AUTOMATICALLY FROM CHANNEL FIVE TO CHANNEL THIRTY TWO WITH THE PUSH OF A BUTTON 
OKAY 
SO C CAN WE CAN WE CREATE THAT KIND OF INTERFACE WITHIN A SCROLL SYSTEM 
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING 
OH NO WE COULD READ IT FROM THE TELEVISION 
YEAH THE THE TELEVISION CAN TELL YOU 
CAN 
PUT 
AND THEN 
AND AGAIN WE HAVE ANOTHER ANOTHER GREAT MARKETING TOOL 
WE HAVE BUT THERE WE HAVE THREE OR FOUR THINGS HERE 
I DUNNO AND ONE MAYBE WE MAYBE EVEN HAVE THIS IS IN HOUSE TECHNOLOGY 
THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THAT'S AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR OWN UH THROUGH OUR OWN SERVICES 
ARE WE GO DIRECTIONAL UP WE GO WE GO THIS WE GO THIS WE GO THIS WAY FOR ONE WE GO THIS WAY FOR THE OTHER 
OH OH OKAY 
OKAY OKAY WELL THEN YOU JUST HAVE YOU HAVE A DIFF YOU HAVE A MODE SWITCH 
YEAH YEAH 
WELL YOU HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE HAVE MORE MONEY FOR THIS 
DIDN'T YOU SAY SO 
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN 
WE CAN INCREASE THE COST 
SO I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HAVING 
WELL I THINK TH I THINK THE DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY HAS TO COME BACK AND SAY 
OKAY TO CREATE THIS PRODUCT WE USE IT'S GONNA COST IS THIS MUCH FOR THIS VOLUME 
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A VOLUME TARGET OF OF FIFTY MILLION PROFIT 
OKAY I'M I'M OKAY WITH THAT 
I GUESS WHAT I JUST WANT TO UM THE NEXT STEP IS FOR THESE GUYS TO COME COME IN WITH THE DESIGN PROPOSAL W WITH THE COST ESTIMATE ATTACHED 
AND THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS AT THE NEXT LEVEL 
WE HAVE TO FIND COST 
YEAH I WAS GONNA SAY THIRTY FIVE TO FIFTY 
BECAUSE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE MARKETING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS THAT THIS IS THE LAST ONE YOU WILL EVER NEED TO BUY FOR YOUR TELEVISION 
IT'S ONE OF THE MARKETING FEATURES IN THIS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
BAS TH THAT'S THAT'S EASY 
THAT'S THAT'S NOT A IT'S A 
'CAUSE WE HAVE ABOUT SIX SIX SEVEN FEATURES IN THAT LINE 
UNDER THE TITLE OF UNIQUENESSES 
WELL I HAVE 
SO MY THREE TWENTY ONE IS THE NEXT MEETING 
THAT'S THAT'S ALMOST UH FIFTY MINUTES 
YOU GUYS CAN 
YOU GUYS YOU GUYS CAN UH CREATE A 
ALL KINDS OF THINGS 
THANKS YEAH 
STILL 
THANK YOU 
I DON'T HAVE ANY EMAILS 
THIS MEANS I CAN GO HOME 
UH WE ALL LEAVE 
THINK SO 
MM 
PER 
PROBABLY NOT 'CAUSE HE'S 
'S BEEN LISTENING TO TOO MUCH 
HE'S GETTING RETARDED 
YAY 
OR NOT 
YEAH 
APPARENTLY I'M OLD AS WELL 
PRESENTED BY NAME 
MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA 
YOU KILLED MY FATHER 
PREPARE TO DO 
YEAH THERE'S A THINGY AND A DINGY AND 
I WANNA CHANGE THAT 
I LIKE THE KINETIC 
UH INTERFACE CONCEPT 
VERY LONG PRESENTATION 
WELL THAT DOESN'T BO BODE WELL FOR IT FOR IT TATS AS WELL 
UM SO SOMEHOW THAT THING'S TOO BIG BUT UM OKAY UM OUR UH MANUFACTURING DIVISION WANTED THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
THEY SAY THEY COULD PUT IT TO WORK BUT UM WE DON'T THINK SO 
NO 
IT IT IT YOU'LL BE YOU KNOW BE AFFECTED BY THE BY THE OTHER SPEECH AND 
YEAH AND AND FIGHTING FOR THE REMOTE WOULD NOT BE FUN ANYMORE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANNA KEEP 
THAT KINDA WOULD OR DO YEAH 
THAT WOULD KIND OF LOSE IT 
YEAH SO UM TAKING THAT WAY 
OR UH THE THE THE RUBBER BUT RUBBER BUTTONS ARE THE MORE RELIABLE IT'S THE THE ONES THAT WOULD AL WOULD ALLOW US TO TO MARKET OUR PRODUCT AS BEING YOU KNOW LESS PRONE TO DAMAGE AND MORE RESISTANT TO THINGS LIKE SPILLAGE OF LIQUIDS OVER IT OR YOU KNOW MISTREAT MISUSES 
SO IT HAPPENS TO REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM SO FOR THE 
POINT THAT WE MAKING ABOUT LOSING IT 
WELL WE WANNA SMALL R REMOTE CONTROL ONE SIDE BECAUSE UH WE WANT TO TO BE COOL AND UH DESIGNED 
BUT UM APPARENTLY UM MARKET SHOWS THAT BIGGER S BIGGER UM REMOTES GET LESS LOST ABOUT 
BUT UM YEAH I THINK WE WE NEED TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE TWO AND SOMEHOW WE'LL DO THAT 
SOMEHOW 
UM SO THE THE WHAT I WOULD PROPOSE IS SOMETHING MORE OR LESS IN THE UH DIRECTION OF WHAT IS IT YOU THE RIGHT OF THAT SLIDE UH BUT WITHOUT WITH A L A LESS COMPLICATED UM DESIGN 
SO THE NUMBERS THE VOLUME CONTROL AND CHANNEL CONTROL AND TELETEXT ACCESS 
UH THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL CAN JUST BECOME THOSE TH THE FOUR BUTTON ARRAY AS ONE OF IT WAS A ROUND DIAL 
AND UM IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT IS THE ONE AT THE RIGHT BUT WITH THE NUMBERS AND THE FOUR BUTTONS PLUS MAYBE A CENTRE ONE WITH TELETEXT 
Y NO IT'S NOT I I IT'S JUST FOUR BUTTONS THAT ARE IN A CROSS 
SO THAT YOU BA BASICALLY CAN CONTROL ALL OF THE IMPORTANT TASKS FROM THAT LINE 
YEAH UM YEAH SO I THINK WE WE WE GO FOR SOMETHING MID SIZED SO SOMETHING LOOKS GOOD AND UH IS NOT TOO PRONE TO GET LOST 
THAT BE TOO 
BUT WOULD WE 
I DUNNO 
I'LL BET FIRST ONE VOLUME MAYBE 
I DUNNO 
IT'S ONLY A T. V. 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO IT'S JUST DIFFERENT 
MAYBE NOT 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK WE HAVE LIKE AND IT'S NOT VERY USABLE AND IT WILL BRING DOWN THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE WHOLE THING 'CAUSE IT'S IT IT BREAKS DOWN EASIER 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY SO WE'LL COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE AND FIFTY THAT IS RUG RUBBER ROBUST WITH SCROLL WHEEL 
WITH THE NEW FACILITIES OF THE SCROLL WHEEL LIKE FAVOURITE STUFF FAVOURITE CHANNELS AND AND WITH A CRADLE AND YEAH AND THE LOCATOR 
OR NOT 
OKAY SO YOU CAN MARKET PE DEPENDING ON THAT 
COOL 
YEAH I THINK IT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING'S COVERED 
COULDA BEEN WORSE 
YES I UM 
PUT IN YOUR MIC 
BOSS 
YEP 
ALRIGHT 
THERE THERE 
PEDRO CAN HAVE TO 
I LIKE I'LL HELP TALK 
UNIT PRICE 
SCROLLING THROUGH YOUR FAVOURITES LIST 
IT'S VERY PROMINENT 
SO HERE I'LL GIVE YOU THE USE THIS IS THE CRADLE UNIT AND THIS IS THE ACTUAL REMOTE ITSELF 
UM SO THE SCROLL BAR IS ARE THE SCROLL WHEEL IS THIS THIS GREEN LITTLE SCROLLY GUY HERE UM AND THEN THE VOLUME CONTROLS ARE HERE AND HERE 
OH YOU'VE GOT THE KEYPAD WHICH IS THE NUMBERS UH F FROM ZERO TO NINE AND THEN TEN 
THIS IS THE POWER BUTTON 
UH WE HAVE OUR UM WE HAVE THE ENTER BUTTON AND UH WHAT WAS THE OTHER BUTTON HERE 
THIS IS THE TELETEXT 
THE PROGRAMME BUTTON YEAH THE PROGRAMME BUTTON 
SO THIS BL THIS BUTTON WILL BE USED BOTH FOR THE FAVOURITES AND FOR PROGRAMMING YOUR UH THE UM THE TYPE OF TELEVISION YOU WANNA SEE 
SO UM THE PLASTIC IS THE WHITE OR IF THIS OF THE MODEL HERE AND THE RED OR IS LIKE A RUBBER COVERING 
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT WHEN IT LAYS LIKE THIS OR LIKE THIS AND THE BUTTONS ARE ALL GONNA BE RUBBER 
SO IT'S PRETTY HARD TO ACTUALLY DAMAGE IT UM 
YEAH THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBLE 
A UM UH POSSIBLE PROBLEM BUT IF YOU DROP IT YEAH 
YEAH AND IT DEPENDS ON IF IT'S SLIDING BUT I THINK IT'S PRETTY ERGONOMIC 
YOU CAN FEEL IT 
YEAH OF COURSE 
WELL THIS IS CLAY 
YEAH THE THE POWER BUTTON IS A BIT OF A RICH BUT I THINK WE MIGHT SCALE DOWN THE FINAL MODEL A BIT 
THIS THIS IS A BIT LARGER THAN IT WOULD BE BUT 
MM PEDRO CAN DEMONSTRATE THE THE PAGING ABILITY 
BEEP BEEP BEEP 
UM BEEP BEEP BEEP SO BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BE SHUT UP 
BEEP BEEP BEEP OKAY 
UM NO NO NO THA THAT'S ALRI 
EXACTLY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS OR FOUR 
AND UM THERE'S NO OTHER AFTER THAT WE WERE DEBATING BUT WE DECIDED TO GO AGAINST IT 
SO UM YOU COULD BEEP BEEP BEEP WE WERE THINKING THAT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO HAVE A TRIGGER BUTTON HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS FINGER IT IT'S IT KINDA FEELS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING THERE 
BUT WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT BUTTON IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO PUT THERE 
AND WE WE DON'T WANNA ACCIDENTALLY BE HITTING THE POWER BUTTON LIKE THAT IS 
MM 
RIGHT 
SO MAYBE IN A FINAL DESIGN PHASE WE MIGHT TWEAK THAT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
MM-HMM 
UH IN THIS IS JUST WHAT WE HAD TO WORK WITH AT THE TIME 
SO WE'LL LEAVE THE COLOUR SCHEME UP TO THE MARKETING PEOPLE 
CAREFUL 
BEEP BEEP BEEP 
YEAH 
NO WAY 
BEEP BEEP BEEP 
MM-HMM 
WELL THAT WAS JUST JUST OUR TECHNICAL TEAM ADDED UP THE UM PRODUCTION COSTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL UNITS 
OH 
UH-HUH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
OH SORRY 
YEAH UM I DO THINK WE THAT WE WE UH DON'T NEED THE EVENTS CHIP ON PRINT 
WE ONLY NEED THE UH THE REGULAR CHIP ON PRINT IS THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A M MISCALCULATION IN THERE 
AND WE NEED WE HAVE A SINGLE CURVED UH 
UH I THINK THAT 
IT'S SINGLE CURVED YEAH 
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN IF SINGLE CURVED 
SO YEAH IT'S FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT THAT'S WHERE WE COME UP WITH IT 
OKAY 
YEAH WE DO 
OH 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW

UH WELL I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON THE STIFFNESS A LITTLE IF IT 
MM 
FEELS GOOD 
I TAKE OUT THAT THIS IS GONNA BE SLIGHTLY LIGHTER IN THE FINAL DESIGN AS WELL

THAT'S PRETTY COOL 
HANG ON 
I PLAN TO DO THAT AS WELL 
SO THE THE TWO BLUE OR OR THIS FOR THE THE TO TO CHARGE OFF OF ONE 
OH OKAY OKAY 
YEAH IT'S THE RIGHT SHAPE ISN'T IT 
BUT MAYBE IF YOU HAD A TRIGGER PLUS THE SCROLL THEN THAT WOULD GET PAST THE THE PROBLEM OF IT LANDING AND SCROLLING 
'CAUSE THEN IT WOULD NEED TO BE HIT ON BOTH SIDES 
OKAY 
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY GOT OPTIONS FOR LIKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MODELS AND THINGS AS WELL BASED ON THAT HASN'T IT 
SO SO THAT THE THE FINAL COLOUR SCHEME AS WELL OR 
OKAY 
THE HMM 
TO COME OFF 
THE SCROLL WHEELS A PROBLEM WITH THEM NOT BEING SORT OF 
I DON'T THINK THE USER INTERFACE GUY WANTS TO TOUCH IT ANYMORE 
MM 
OKAY ENOUGH OF THAT 
WELL I IT'S COOL GUYS 
'KAY SO ARE WE DONE WITH THE THIS PRESENTATION 
OKAY 
NOW NOW 
HAVE YOU 
OKAY 
CAN I NOT GET YOUR GET OUT STUFF FROM YOUR SHARED FOLDER NOW 
UH I SEE I SEE 
DO YOU WOULD YOU A ARGUE THAT THAT WE'RE BETTER GOING FOR THE HIGHER COST THAN BRINGING IT DOWN INTO TWENTY FI FIVE SO WE PROBABLY COULD 
BUT LOWERING OUR PROFIT MARGINS 
MM-HMM 
MM 'KAY 
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY QUITE OPEN TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE PRODUCT FOR A LATER VERSION WITH THESE FEATURES QUITE SIMPLY ANYWAY AREN'T WE 
TH THERE'S NO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT 
HMM 
YEAH THE PLUS THERE'S THE THE RISK OF MAKING IT UNUSABLE AS WELL 
OR MAKING IT LESS B BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO LOOK AT ALL THE BUTTONS 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO IT'S VERY SIMPLE AND IT JUST WORKS 
MM THERE'S A RISK OF THAT 
OKAY SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT FINANCE NOW 
SO I HAVE A LITTLE SPREADSHEET FOR US WHERE I I WAS WONDERING 
YOU WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT EUROS I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THAT FIGURE 
OKAY SO I HAVE BIT OF A SPREADSHEET HERE FOR THIS 
NOW 
I'VE MADE A F FEW ASSUMPTIONS HERE IN THAT I'M ASSUMING THAT OUR POWER ADAPTOR WE CAN MAKE FOR A COST OF FOUR EUROS 
EQUIVALENT TO SOLAR CELLS WHICH I THINK SO PROBABLY FAIR CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE IN HOUSE MANUFACTURING OF POWER ADAPTORS ALREADY 
UH AND I'M ASSUMING THAT THE LOCATOR BEACON THE YOU KNOW THE 
CAN BE MADE FOR IT SOUNDED DIFFERENT THAT TIME UH CAN BE MADE FOR A SIMILAR PRICE TO UH AN L. C. DISPLAY UH IN UH 
UH DO YOU THINK THAT'S FOR COMING FROM A UM THE MANUFACTURING 
OKAY 
YEP 
OKAY 
SO WE'RE DOWN TO SIXTEEN POINT FOUR YEAH 
SO THAT A SINGLE CURVED RATHER THAN A DOUBLE CURVED 
WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT SINGLE CURVE VERSUS DOUBLE CUR 
YOU THINK 
OKAY I'M CONVINCED 
BUT WE SAVE ONE OR THAT WAY YEAH 
SO WE COME BRING IT DOWN TO 
FIFTEEN POINT FOUR 
WELL HANG ON 
DO DON'T SPEAK SO IT'S AN HOUR IN THAT WE DO WE HAVE ANY WE HAVE SPECIAL FORM DON'T WE 
SO THAT'S YEAH 
BUT THE THE THE WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT ANY SPECIAL COLOUR THOUGH UH I DON'T TH IF WE'RE GOING FOR GREYS AND SILVERS THEN I DON'T THINK WE'RE 
O OKAY SO WE'RE 
PUSH BUTTON SCROLL WHEEL WE'RE BASICALLY WE HAVE UH THE USE THIS INTENDED TO BE A BUTTON AS WELL OR JUST A SCROLL 
JUST A SCROLL 
IT'S NOT ONE OF THE SCROLLS WHERE FOR EXAMPLE WITH THIS ONE YOU COULD PUSH IT DOWN TO BE A BUTTON 
OKAY THEN WE HAVE FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT EUROS 
IT WASN'T BAD 
OKAY SO 
WE'RE IN AT THE 
WE'RE IN AT THE PUT IN THE BACK PART OF THE 
PRESENTATION WHERE WE HAVE A LOOK AT THE CRITERIAS TH THAT PAUL THE CRITERION CRITERIA THAT PAUL HAS HAS GIVEN US AND WE CAN SEE THAT TO TELL 
HOW'S IT GOING 
ANYONE GOT ANY THOUGHTS 
HOW HOW HAVE WE DONE TODAY 
I THINK WE DID PRETTY WELL IT 
THAT LOOKS PRETTY SPECTACULAR 
ANY OTHER CHANG UH THOUGHTS 
OKAY SO THE THE WHAT ABOUT UM ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 
SO AT THE 
I I THINK WE WE ENDED UP BEING QUITE CREATIVE THERE 
MM 
NOT VERY IDEA NECESSARILY IT'S STILL A REMOTE CONTROL 
OH NO YEAH BUT WE DID WE DID BREAK WITH THE SPECS A LITTLE BIT I GUESS BUT THE UH 
'KAY LEADERSHIP WHAT DO WE REPORT BACK TO THE BOSSES 
NO TH TH I THINK THEY WERE R REASONABLY FLEXIBLE WITH US OVER THE WHOLE CHANGING THE SPECS THING 
I AGREE 
SYNERGY 
TEAMWORK YEAH UH SO UH 
WHAT DID WE THINK OF THE MEETING ROOM I GUESS AS AN IMPORTANT THING HERE 
MM 
YEAH THIS FALLS OFF AND UH THE WHITE BOARD WORKED REALLY WELL WITHOUT ANY PRO 
MM MM LAPEL 
WHA OKAY OH ALRIGHT 
THAT'S IT'S DOWN IT'S QUITE CLOSE 
KEEP IT KEEP IT CALM 
OH DEAR 
NO MORE PIZZA FOR ME 
SO YEAH THE THE PEN CAME IN ALRIGHT AND IT'S A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE TO USE BUT I GUESS IT WORKS 
NAH I'M I'M NOT CONVINCED OF THAT AT ALL 
I'VE BEEN WOR I'VE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THAT ALL DAY BUT IS THIS LIKE LIKE THEY'RE THAT LOOKS THA THA THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE THAT WAY AROUND 
BUT IT FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE WH WHAT YOU CALL UPSIDE DOWN 
I DON'T CARE 
OH OKAY SO THAT DATA MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY INVALID 
WHAT NEW IDEAS HAVE WE FOUND 
WELL LET'S DO BOTH THEN 
UH FOR THE PRODUCT 
YEAH WE COME UP WITH QUITE A BIT 
AND FOR THE MEETING ROOM HAS ANYONE GOT ANY MORE 
YEAH LESS SORE ON THE EARS 
OKAY SO 
OR THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET 
NOPE 
OH HANG ON IT REALLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE THAT THE COSTS WERE UNDER TWELVE FIFTY EUROS 
NO REQUIREMENTS ARE CHANGED 
WE'RE STILL UNDER TWENTY EUROS TO BUILD SO WE'RE GOOD 
AND THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET 
NOT THE ORIGINAL BUDGET BUT THEY ARE NOW 
SO THE PROJECT EVALUATED 
MM I THINK SO YEAH THEN CELEBRATION AS IT SAYS 
UH I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GOT THREE 
UH ANYWAY 
THINK 
THANKS GUYS 
YEAH I'VE GOT A LOT OF PAPERWORK TO CATCH UP ON IT 
OH 
SO SO SO 
MAYBE 
MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE 
BR 
MM THAT'S UH THAT'S UH I LIKE IT 
I MEAN YOU GUYS GAVE ME MORE THAN I WAS ASKING FOR SO I'M HAPPY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY MARKETABLE FEATURES IN THIS 
YEAH I THINK IT'S GOOD 
GOOD GOOD GOOD JOB 
UH PLA 
I'M UH 
IT'S GREAT 
THAT'S GREAT 
IT'S A GREAT FEATURE 
SO YOU CAN TAKE THIS UH TAKE THIS HOME WITH YOU TONIGHT AND YOU CAN PUSH THAT AND HE'LL BE ACROSS TOWN 
UH I CAN SEE THAT 
YEP I LIKE 
GOOD JOB 
NO NO 
WELL I MEAN OF COURSE I MEAN 
MY MY IS MY SUGGESTION IS WE'RE GONNA GO GO TO THE SILVERS AND BLACKS LIKE MOST OF THE TELEVISIONS 
YOU KNOW SOME BLEND OF SILVERS AND BLACKS 
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND MY UH MY FOLDER UP THERE I GOTTA DO MINE UP TO THE BOARD 
YEAH YEAH 
SO 
NO IT'S NOT IN THERE BECAUSE I HAD THE COMPUTER PROBLEM AND I I I C I COULDN'T CREATE IT 
I COULDN'T CREATE IT IN THE POWERPOINT AND I THINK I'VE GOT THIS REALLY STRANGE CABLE 
SO WHAT I HAD BASICALLY GOING FROM THE POWERPOINT FORMAT IS THAT UH YEAH YEAH I LIKE THIS A LOT 
SO THIS ONE OF THE TESTS IS IT IS HOW WE CAN ADAPT IT IS CHANGING SITUATIONS IN THE ON THE MEETING ROOM 
SO WHAT WE HAD SO WE HAD THE METHOD 
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU SPELL METHOD IS IT 
AN A. 
SO THIS DOESN'T GO AS FAST THIS WAY 
AND WHEN I SPEAK ABOUT METHOD I SPEAK ABOUT THE MARKETING OF THE PRODUCT HUH 
AND UH TO ME WITH THIS PRODUCT WE GOT UH WE GOT BASICALLY OTHER THINGS TO MARKET 
WE'VE GOT THE FEATURES 
WE HAVE THE UH CHARACTERISTICS 
AND WE HAVE THE I I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE OTHER PART WHAT WE CALL YOU KNOW THE THE THE 
CORP CORPORATE 
HELP ME 
THE THE CORPORATION STANDS BEHIND THE PRODUCT OKAY 
SO THE FEATURES I THINK WE GET THE SCROLL WE'VE GOT THE UH THE LOCATOR WE'VE GOT THE DURABILITY 
WE'VE GOT THE DEPENDABILITY WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW THE FEATURES THAT MAKE THIS A UNIQUE PRODUCT 
UM 
THE CHARACTERISTICS I TALK ABOUT WE HAVE RELIABILITY WE HAVE COMFORT WE HAVE ERGONOMICS WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTALLY S SENSITIVE 
UH AND THE CORPORATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE WE'RE A NEW WE'RE A NEW COMPANY 
WE'RE WANTING TO MAKE A NAME FOR OURSELF 
WE'RE WANTING YOU TO UH FIND OUR PRODUCT SO WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU A GOOD PRODUCT TO A FAIR PRICE 
ONE THING I WOULD WANT TO IT IS IS UH SO CAN WE CAN WE GOT A LIFETIME UH GUARANTEE ON THIS PRODUCT 
A NORMAL USE GUARANTEE WHICH MEANS THAT THIS PRODUCT FOR THE FOR THE LIFE OF OF THE LIFE SO 
IF IT SHOULD HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM THAT WE COULD RE REPLACE IT IT IN COST 
THAT WAS SOMETHING I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN 
UM SO YEAH WITHOUT UH GOING INTO GREAT DETAILS WE HAVE A WE HAVE A PRODUCT IT HAS THE FEATURES AND THE CHARACTERISTICS AND THE BACKGROUND 
I BELIEVE TO MAKE IT MARKETABLE I BELIEVE IT A COST OF OF OF THIRTY THIRTY FIVE TO TO FIFTY EUROS 
WE'RE GONNA BE COMPETITIVE AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE A MARKET NICHE 
UM WE 
THAT THAT WOULD BE UH THAT WOULD BE I THINK A DECISION BEST MADE BY CORPORATE UM I I UM FOR MY EVALUATION BASED ON WHAT OUR COMPETITION IS 
I TH I THINK THAT THAT WE CAN GO AFTER THIS AND AND AND GO AFTER MORE OF THE UH EXCLUSIVITY SENSE THAN THE MASS MARKET SENSE 
BUT I'M SH I'M SURE OPEN IT TO MARKET THIS ONE OTHER DIRECTION 
BUT YOU GUYS COME UP WITH A GREAT PRODUCT AND IT THAT COST I THINK IT UH THERE'S NOBODY ELSE THAT'S PUTTING THIS THIS COMBINATION OF OF INGREDIENTS TOGETHER 
THE ONLY LIMITATIONS I SEE IT THIS IS THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON TELEVISION ONLY 
OH THAT'S THE ONLY THAT'S THE ONLY DRAWBACK I SEE IT THIS 
BUT WITH ALL OF THESE OTHER FEATURES I THINK PEOPLE C ONE THING I'M I'M HOPING FOR US PEOPLE ARE NOT GONNA EVEN NOTICE 
THERE'S GONNA BE SOMEBODY GOING HOME AND SAY UH SH THIS THING DOESN'T WORK FOR MY D. V. D. AND MY BUT I LIKE THIS OTHER THINGS 
SO THEY KEEP IT THEY DON'T TAKE IT BACK 
WELL ONE OF ONE OF THE THOUGHTS THAT I HAD SO CAN CAN THIS NOT BE BE PRODUCED IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT UPGRADABLE 
YOU KNOW UH LOOK LIKE A UM A SIM CARD IN A IN A UM IN A TELEPHONE 
YOU KNOW IS THERE A CARD IN THE CAN WE MAKE A CARD AND SO AFTER 
MM-HMM BUT YOU FOLLOW WHAT I'M SO I'M S 
YEAH 'CAUSE IF IF WE CAN MAKE THIS UNIT UPGRADABLE THEN WE'RE YEAH BUT THEN WE TALK ABOUT CHANGING THE WARRANTY CONCEPT AND EVERYTHING 
BUT THAT'S THAT WAS JUST AN IDEA I HAD 
UH TO UM THE ONLY ADDITIONS 
YEAH 
YEP 
BUT ANYWAY THAT'S UH 
MM-HMM 
WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT A CURVE AND A DROOP 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT 
OH 
NO I THINK WE COME UP WITH A WITH A ATTRACTIVE MARKETABLE UM PRODUCT AND AND CONCEPT 
YEAH WELL WE WE WE KINDA BROKE WE KINDA AT LEAST ADJUSTED EVERY EVERY CRITERIA THEY GAVE US BECAUSE WE DO WE STILL HAVE THE THE TELETEXT CAPABILITY IN THIS THING RIGHT 
WE RAISED THE PRICE OF IT WE'VE ADDED TWO T NEW TECHNOLOGY TO IT 
SO YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IF THIS THING FLIES THEN WE'VE WE'VE ADJUSTED OR BROKEN EVERY EVERY DO THEY GAVE US 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT I LIKE I MEAN WHEN I SAY WE HAVE WE HAD I BELIEVE WE HAVE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 'CAUSE WE THIS IS WE DID IT 
COHESIVE YEAH 
YES SYNERGISTIC YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE ON THE RECORDING IN THERE FROM THAT MICROPHONE IS YOUR LUNCH DIGESTING YOU KNOW THE 
NEW IDEAS OF UH FOR THE PRODUCT OR FOR THE THE THE THE ENVIRONMENT OR WHAT ARE WE IT 
OH 
WELL I I MEAN CLEARLY REMOTE CONTROL MICROPHONES WOULD BE THE WOULD BE A NICE SOLUTION AT ALL THESE CABLES 
BUT I'M SURE THAT THERE'S THERE'S SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE THINGS THAT I DON'T KNOW BUT 
AND OF COURSE I DID NOT HAVE AS MUCH FUN WITH MY COMPUTER THIS AFTERNOON 
IT'S NOT BEEN UH IT'S NOT BEEN COOPERATING SO WELL BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE 
THAT'S AVOIDABLE 
NO 
OKAY 
SO WE NEED TO CLOSE THIS MEETING YEAH BRAVO 
CONGRATULATIONS 
SO I'VE GOT A LOT OF PAPERWORK TO CATCH UP ON SO LET'S CLOSE THIS AND COME BACK AND 'KAY 
SO YOU FORGOT HOW THIS WORKS AGAIN 
BOSS 
HMM YOU KNOCKED IT UP 
THE THIRD THIRD THIRD 
THE END PRODUCT THINGY 
YEAH 
UM YEAH SO WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH 
PRODUCTION COSTS ESTIMATED BY OUR MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT AND UM THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT WHICH IS IS IS UH FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT EUROS 
SOMEONE FORGOT THE NUTS THERE YEAH UH UNIT PRICE UNIT PRODUCTION PRICE COST THING 
UM 
WE IMPLEMENTED THE BASIC FUNCTIONS WHICH IS JUST T. V. FUNCTIONS PLUS THE LOCATOR WHICH WAS ONE OF THE MARKETING THINGS CRADLE 
SCROLL WHEEL FOR UH THE THE CHANNELS 
AND UH WE IMPLEMENTED THE OF THE THE WAY OF PUTTING THE NEW AND REVOLUTIONARY ZAPPING YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS FUNCTIONALITY IN THE SCROLL 
YEAH 
ZAPPING YOU KNOW ZAPPING 
MAYBE IT'S JUST A PORTUGUESE THING 
AND UM YEAH THAT WAS THE RESULT 
STREET IS THE THE START UH TO TO TO PROGRAMME YEAH 
NOT HELPING 
DON'T HAVE ONE ONE TO HANDLE THAT 
YEAH 
SO YOU UH YOU HAVE LIKE THE THE BASE STATION WITH UM THE LITTLE BUTTON FOR THE WHERE'S MY REMOTE 
THE LOCATOR FUNCTION 
WICKED ISN'T IT 
JA 
NAH 
IT FELL OFF 
WE WE NEED WE NEED WE NEED IS SOME MORE BUTTONS IF IT WOULD IT WORK ON SOME OTHER STUFF BUT 
W W W YEAH WE COULD GET ANOTHER VERSION OF IT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS 
BUT UH 
VERY CO VERY COLF COLOURFUL 
BEEP BEEP BEEP 
YEAH 
WE DON'T 
IT'S A SCROLL

DO YOU MUST HAVE VERY LONG SHIRTS 
THAT'S WAY FOR DOWN LAPEL MIC 
LAPEL LAPEL LAPEL 
THAT'S ALMOST A CROTCH MI CR 
OH DEAR OH DEAR 
'CAUSE THIS IS YOU WERE USING IT O UPSIDE DOWN

SO THEM LIKE THAT 
BUNCH OF NEW IDEAS

HOORAY 
FREE COKE PROVIDED AT THE CAFETERIA 
WHO WROTE THAT ONE 
COOL 
SO WE CAN START 
SUPPOSE I HAVE TO DO MY PRESENTATION 
UH UM 
SO I'LL PRESENT MYSELF I'M ADA LONGMUND AND SO YOU MAY KNOW IT I'M THE PR PROJECT MANAGER 
SO UM WE WILL HAVE TO 
UM SPEAK ABOUT UM THE PROJECT 
OUR PROJECT PROJECT IS TO CREATE UM A NEW REMOTE CONTROL AND SO YOU MAY KNOW THERE'S LOT OF INDUSTRIALS INTERESTING IN CREATING A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND UM USER FRIENDLY 
RECORD 
SO THE PROJECT METHOD IS THE FOLLOWING 
SO IF WE'RE UM THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN YOU HAVE TO DO UH ANY INDIVIDUAL WORK AND UH ALSO WORK WITH UH MEETINGS TALKING WITH EACH OTHER 
UH IT WILL BE THE SAME FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND ALSO THE SAME FOR THE DETAILED DESIGN 
OH 
THE TOOL TRAINING IS TO TRY TO THE WHITE BOARD SO 
MAYBE YOU CAN DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
AND MAKE A LIST OF ITS FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS 
I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW MAYBE LATER LATER 
SO THE SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S QUITE GOOD PRICE YEAH 
AND UH 
IT WILL UH BE A 
AN INTERNATIONAL REMOTE CONTROL SO WE WANT TO SELL IT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD AND THE PRODUCT COSTS WILL BE NOT MORE THAN TWELVE EUROS AND FIFTY CENTIMES 
SO SO YOU WILL DISCUSS ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU WILL HAVE TO EXPERIENCE YOUR UM WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM JUST UH MAYBE BE IMAGINATIVE WITH REMOTE CONST CON CONTROLS TRY TO CREATE SOMETHING NEW AND PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO TO BUY 
AND AND THE NEXT MEETING WILL START IN THIRTY MINUTES 
SO YOU'LL HA ALL HAVE YOUR SPETHISFISPIS SPECIF SPECIFIC ROLE AND YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO 
AND UH YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK ON THE DESIGN AND ALSO TO WORK ON THE DESIGN OF THE TECHNICAL FUN FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THINK OF THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS 
YEAH 
I. D. YEAH 
SO 
SO I WILL MANAGE ALL ALL THE GROUP 
SO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS 
SO YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THE PARTS OF THE WORK YOU HAVE TO DO 
MM-HMM 
AND YOU 
MM OKAY 
HMM 
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE TO DESIGN IT AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE INDUSTRIAL WAY TO TRANSFORM IT 
AND I MAYBE YOU WILL TRANSFORM IT 
MAYBE IT IS THE OUTSIDE AND THE INSIDE 
AND YEAH 
AND WHEN DESIGNING Y THE REMOTE CONTROL JUST REMEMBER THAT UH IT HAS TO BE A KIND OF INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT 
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO SOMETHING REALLY SPECIFIC AS EVERYBODY EVERYBODY WILL HAVE TO USE IT IT'S EASIER THE SAME AS KEYBOARDS 
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE QWERTY AZERTY FRENCH AND U. K. KEYBOARD IS REALLY THE REMOTE CONTROL TO BE INTERNATIONAL 
AND NOT TOO EXPENSIVE 
SO WE WANT TO MAXIMISE THE BENEFIT 
YEAH YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PRODUCT COST WON'T BE MAXIM MORE THAN TWELVE DOT FIFTY EUROS 
AND TO BE SURE THAT REALLY PEOPLE WILL BE INTERESTED IN BUYING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL WITH MAYBE NEW FUNCTIONALITIES THAT DON'T EXIST IN THE MM EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS NOW 
SO SO IT OKAY 
SO YOU THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW 
YOU WANT ME TO DRAW SOMETHING 
PRODUCT MANAGER OKAY LET'S GO I WILL TRY 
NO 
A MOUSE IS NOT TOO DIFFICULT

AND U. I. D. IT'S FOR THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER YEAH 
UM YEAH PROJECT 
YOU WILL BE THE MANAGER YEAH 
I AM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN YEAH 
I AM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SO 
IT'S DIFFICULT 
YOU KNOW VERY SOON 
SO 
I I THINK THE USER THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN IS UH WILL DESIGN HOW THE USER WILL YOU KNOW THE RELATION BETWEEN THE USER AND YOU KNOW THE REMOTE CONTROL IS 
AND THE UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IT IS HOW THE OBJECT WILL LOOK LIKE 
YEAH 
SO THE MATERI 
OKAY RIGHT 
BUT I WAS THINKING THAT HE'S A USER 'CAUSE THE USER INTERFACE TO DESIGN FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE ABOUT BUTTON WILL BE YOU KNOW

THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
MM 
IT'S CLEAR 
YEAH MAYBE SHOULD GO AND DRAW AN ANIMAL

SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
USER INTERFACE DESIGN D INDUSTRIAL DESIGN 
YEAH I THINK SO 
OKAY SO I MAKE UH U USER INTERFACE 
YOU YOU DO YOU IMPLEMENT THE CORE FUNCTIONS ON THE 
SO IT 
MAKE MAKE YEAH 
MAYBE I THINK UH UH I INDUSTRIAL DESIGN'S UH IT'S THE FUNCTION DESIGN

NO PROBLEM NO PROBLEM 
A PERSON 
DOG 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO WE HAVE BREAK 
OH 
HMM 
NO 
OKAY 
SO LET'S START OUR SECOND ME MEETING IN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
SO 
SO THE PREVIOUS MEETING I WILL BE THE SECRETARY AND WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS AND WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPT AND FINALLY WE'LL CLOSE THE DECISION 
SO I WILL FIRST UH 
WHAT 
I I THINK I WILL LET UH OUR USER INTERFACE DESIGNER SPEAK FIRST MISTER DAVID JORDAN 
SO WE'LL 
S TECHNICAL ACCESSOIRE 
INTERFACE 
THIS 
I'M NOT SURE THE IN IN THE MIDDLE IS VERY ATTRACTIVE 
IT'S VERY BIG YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH WHY NOT 
WE'LL HAVE BIG DISCUSSION I SUPPOSE AFTER THAT IS 
OKAY 
SOMETHING ELSE 
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION BECAUSE FOR THE INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER YOU SAID THAT WE CAN USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION OR THE GESTURE RECOGNITION 
BUT IS THE UM EXPERT TOLD US MOST OF THE PEOPLE WANT TO USE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO ZAP T TO ZAP BETWEEN CHANNELS 
DO YOU THINK THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE GESTURES 
BECAUSE IF THEY DO ALL THE TIME THE SAME GESTURE AS YOU SAID PREVIOUSLY IN THE LAST MEETING MAYBE THEY WILL GET INJURIES BECAUSE OF THAT 
OR IF YOU SAY CHANNEL THREE CHANNEL THREE TWO THREE FOUR SIX FIVE I THINK THEY WILL BE BORED AFTER A WHILE 
YOU DON'T THINK SO 
YEAH SURE 
I THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH BUT SUPPOSE YOU GOT A COULD 
YOU HAVE A MUTE REMOTE CONTROLLER 
BROKEN ARM 
YEAH BUT SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A FAMILY WATCHING T. V. 
AND IF THEY WANT TO USE THEIR PRIVATE REMOTE CONTROL IN THE SAME TIME DO YOU THINK IT WILL WORK 
EVERYBODY WANTING TO CHANGE CHANNEL ON THE SAME TIME 
WHY 
IF YOU HAVE ONE BROTHER AND ONE SISTER AND THEY WANT TO WATCH THEIR FAVOURITE UH T. V. PROGRAMME 
SO THEY SAY UH CHANNEL FOUR CHANNEL THREE CHANNEL FOUR CHANNEL THREE ALL THE TIME SO 
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL SO MAYBE YOU CAN KEEP IT F WITH YOU 
YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT OBLIGED TO SHARE IT 
YEAH WE CAN YEAH 
YEAH I THINK IT'S A DISADVANTAGE 
YEAH BUT IN OTHER QUESTION 
HOW HOW MUCH WILL IT COST 
YEAH 
BECAUSE I SUPPOSE WE NEED TO DO RESEARCH TO HAVE SOMETHING WORKING 
SOME SOME EFFICIENT 
SO YOU THINK IT WON'T COST ONE 
NOT A LOT FOR US 
OR 
YEAH BUT UH UH 
MM MM 
YEAH 
I AGREE WITH UH 
YEAH BUT THERE IS NO PROBLEM THAT UH BABA TALKED ABOUT IS THE INTERNATIONAL 
REMOTE CONTROL 
WE NEED SOMETHING THAT IS INTERNATIONAL 
SUPPOSE WE'RE WE WANT TO SELL IT IN FRANCE 
THE RECOGNITION SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND FRENCH 
IF YOU WANT TO GO TO ENGLAND IT WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH SO 
MM OKAY 
AND WITH AN INCREASE IN THE PRI PRODUCTION PRICE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH BUT HOW WELL YOU 
OH 
SEEMS TO BE QUITE COMPLEX 
AND WHAT ABOUT VOICE RECOGNITION DO WE HAVE MICROPHONES 
AND WHERE WILL BE THEY 
DO YOU THINK IF WE'RE FAR FROM TELEVISION IT WILL WORK 
YEAH BUT WHERE IS THE CONTROLLER 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WE'RE HERE IT'S UH AN OBJECT 
BUT HERE YOU SAY YOU WANT TO SEE I UH S TECHNOLOGY 
YEAH BUT WHA WHAT IS THE EASE OF VOICE OR GESTURE RECOGNITION IF YOU HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL LI LIKE THIS IF YOU HAVE AN OBJECT 
IF YOU WANT TO USE VOICE OR GESTURE YOU NEED TO BE FOR WITHOUT ANY OBJECT 
YOU JUST WANT TO INTERACT WITH TELEVISION 
YEAH BUT YOU CAN LOSE IT 
OKAY YOU SEE YOU CAN BUILD A KIND OF BLACK BOX AND PUT IT ON T. V. AND JUST TO RECOGNIZE GESTURES AND VOICE 
OH 
YEAH BUT 
MM 
I THINK SO 
AND MAYBE IT WILL BE QUITE 
OKAY 
HMM 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WE'LL TRY THE CONTROLLERS YOU'D PREFER 
WHICH KIND OF CONTROLLER WOULD YOU PREFER TO SEE YOU USE A REMOTE CONTROL SURE 
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO DO ANY INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER AND TO STAY WITH THE GOOGLE CONTROLLER OR A FANCY CONTROLLER 
MAYBE TRY TO MIX THE GOOGLE CONTROLLER AND THE FANCY CONTROLLER 
HMM 
JUST WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING CONTROLLER WHICH IS IN A KIND OF INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER EASY TO USE SOPHISTICATED AND FANCY 
YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE 
YEAH BUT UH WE WANT SO 
YEAH BUT WE WE WE WANT SOMETHING THA THAT WORKS ALL THE TIME EVERY DAY EVERY HERE FOR EVERYONE 
YOU DON'T NEED TO TUNE IT 
YEAH WHY NOT 
IF IT'S 
NOT TOO EXPENSIVE TO 
OKAY 
SO LET'S GO TO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE A DECISION AFTER THAT IS 
TWO 
WORKING 
I CAN 
OKAY 
IT'S OKAY 
UH I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR 
MAYBE YOU YOU RECORD IT SOMEWHERE ELSE 
INTERFACE CONCEPT 
NO 
MM MM 
OH 
NOPE 
IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE 
YEAH SO 
NO I THINK IT WILL BE MORE INTERESTING TO START WITH UH 
YEAH 
YOU WILL HEAD IS SOME MORE INFORMATION ON I THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING AFTER YOUR PRESENTATION TO HAVE UM BABA'S PRESENTATION 
SO 
OKAY 
OKAY NEVER MIND 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S AN ADDED VALUE AT THE REMOTE CONTROL AND MAYBE IT CAN ATTRACT ALL THE ECOLOGICAL K YEAH CONSUMERS AND BUT BUT THE THE PRICE OF ADDING THESE SOLAR BATTERY 
WOULD TO BE SOMETHING REALLY THAT WILL INCREASE THE PRICE OF PRODUCTION MORE ON 
SO 
OKAY 
AND WHAT THE WHAT ABOUT THE UH 
MATERIALS 
IMPERSONAL MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH AND I IF YOU WE WANT TO PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS MAYBE WE CAN TRY TO DO SOMETHING WITH WOOD 
MM-HMM 
MM OKAY SEEMS TO BE INTERESTING MM 
YEAH WE WANT SOMETHING EASY TO USE AND SO I THINK MAYBE SOMETHING VERY LOW LEVEL WOU WOULD BE ENOUGH 
AND YOU THINK THAT WE WILL BE 
OKAY 
SO WOOD 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE BUTTONS 
NO IT'S FASHION YEAH 
I DUNNO 
I THINK WE HAVE ONLY UH FIVE MINUTES LEFT 
PARTICIPANT FOUR 
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
THIS ONE 
OKAY 
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE COMPONENT CONCEPTS ABOUT THE ENERGY 
SO SO YOU SAY YOU WANT SOMETHING TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE MAYBE USING SOLAR ENERGY AND WITH BATTERY WOULD BE SOMETHING INTERESTING MAYBE WILL ATTRACT 
PRO ECOLOGY CONSUMERS 
UH CHIP IMPRINT SO YOU SEE YOU PROPOSE LOW LEVEL CHIPS WOULD BE UH ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING WORKING WELL 
CASE 
SO YOU THINK CASE 
SOMETHING SPONGY 
SOMETH NO WOOD 
MAYBE YOU 
IT'S IT'S NATURAL 
THE THE FEELING IS NEUTRAL SO MAYBE WE CAN STAY WITH WOOD 
BUT IT'S STILL FASHION 
YEAH SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN INTO IT 
UH AND WHAT ABOUT THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT 
GOOGLE AND FANCY 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT WITH THE VOICE AND GESTURE RECOGNITION THERE ARE STILL SOME 
DISADVANTAGES WITH THIS 
YEAH BUT YOU NEED A RECEIVER TO RECOGNIZE THE GESTURES AND THE VOICE 
THAT'S TRUE 
SO MAYBE WE'LL JUST FOCUS ON THE GOOGLE CONTROLLER PLUS THE FANCY CONTROLLER MAYBE TRY TO MIX THEM THESE TWO CONCEPTS TOGETHER 
JUST ONE ONE AND DO A REMOTE CONTROL WITH SOLAR ENERGY AND BATTERIES AND WITH LEV LOW LEVEL CHIPS AND WOOD 
AND L. C. D. BUTTONS 
YEAH I THINK FOR THESE SUPPLEMENTS THE SOLAR ENERGY WOULD BE SOMETHING QUITE INTERESTING AND NOT MAYBE TOO DIFFICULT TO ADD 
YEAH FOR THE INTERFACE SOMETHING ADDED VALUE 
WITH A MODEL 
YOU MEAN THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH A MUR MODULE IF YOU WANT YOU CAN JUST USE 
COMMANDS WORDS AND SEE THEM WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO USE YOUR FINGERS 
TURNING THE T. V. O ONE O OR OFF 
SO ADDING SOME VOCAL COMMANDS 
SIMPLE ONES 
OKAY 
SO THE NEXT MEETING WILL START IN THIRTY MEETI MINUTES SO WE'LL YOU WILL ALL HAVE TO WORK ON 
IN YOUR DIRECTION 
SO YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK ON THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN TO HAVE THE EASY TO USE 
POWERFUL AND FANCY REMOTE CONTROL WITH SOME ADDED VALUE SUCH AS THE UH SIMPLE VOCAL COMMANDS RECOGNITION 
UH YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK MORE BABA 
IN THE UM SPONGY WAY TO TO ADD SPONGY UM TOUCH IT THE BUTTONS AND TRY TO FIND MAYBE A NICE SHAPE FOR THE WOODEN REMOTE CONTROL 
AND I SUP I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO EVALUATE THE THE PRODUCT IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND REMEMBER SO SO I SAID LAST MEETING 
WE REALLY HAVE TO BUILD A FASHION REMOTE CONTROL AND UH THE COLOUR OF THE UM THE SOCIETY WILL BE REALLY IT WILL BE SEEN IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO YOU WILL HAVE BABA AND DAVID JORDAN YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE PROTOTYPE AND YOU WILL HAVE NEXT TIME TO SHOW US UM MODELLING A CL A CLAY REMOTE CONTROL 
SO YOU WILL HAVE TO MODEL MODEL SOMETHING 
AND I THINK THAT SOME SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH 
SO ONE MORE QUESTIONS WE CAN CLOSE THE SESSION 
YEAH 
OKAY COOL 
MM-HMM 
MM 
A NICE ONE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE 
OH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD POINT IS 
ONE AND 
YEP 
YEAH BUT YEAH BUT THE SAME CAN HAPPEN EVEN WITH IT YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE THE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
IT'S IT'S 
AND MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN HAVE THE SWITCHING MODE TO PASS FROM YOU KNOW VOICE CONTROLLER TO 
MANUAL CONTROLLERS EH 
NO MORE EXPENSIVE MAYBE 
WELL Y Y YOU HAVE ALSO THE LANGUAGE PROBLEM YOU KNOW WHEN YOU 
'CAUSE IT TO HAVE TO BE UNIVERSAL SO 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW 
THE PRODUCT THE PRO 
IT'S A VERY SMART IT'S A VERY SMART CONTROLLER MAYBE 
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT 
YEAH BUT THE PROBLEM IS HOW TO SEE YOU KNOW IF THIS IS A PUSH BUTTON CONTROLLER 
YOU CAN SEND THIS CAN THIS REMOTE CONTROL EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD THE SAME ONE 
IF YOU HAVE THE LANGUAGE YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP FOR EACH COUNTRY 
YEAH BUT FOR EACH COUNTRY YOU HAVE TO DO ONE BECAUSE UH THE FOR EXAMPLE FOR US 
OH REALLY 
THAT'S 
COMPLE 
A MICROPHONE MAYBE 
TO TALK TO THE AT THE T. V. MAYBE 
I IF YOU SAY IN UH SWITCH TO CHANNEL YEAH 
AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE IF IT IS SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM IF I MAYBE IF IT IS IN THE TABLE THERE YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY IS CHANNEL ONE AND THE AT THE REMOTE CONTROL GIVES THE ORDER TO THE T. V. TO SWITCH TO CHANNEL ONE 
DEVICE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT AS YOU NEED A CAMERA AND YOU KNOW A MICROPHONE INSIDE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW SWITCHING FROM ONE COUNTRY TO TO ANOTHER WILL BE A PROBLEM IS ALTHOUGH YOU YOU 
YEAH BUT I I 
YEAH WE SHOULD 
OH 
MM 
YEAH BUT 
I THINK UH AND A CONTROL THAT IS VERY RELIABLE SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S NOT REALLY THE W WE CAN ADD FOR EXAMPLE SOME FUNCTION LIKE FOR BROWSING IN INTERNET IS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT UH I THINK A USER AND 
DON'T HAVE A THE THE 
YEAH IF WE CAN SEND EMAIL FROM IT 
BECAUSE THE P THE PROBLEM I CAN USE WITH WITH THE VOICE OR THE GESTURE ITSELF WH WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN A FAMILY I I FOR EXAMPLE OF 
YEAH 
AND FOR ALL THE PERSON OF THE FAMILY MAYBE SO YEAH 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOW 
YOU 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH PARTICIPANT TWO UM 
YEAH WORKING DESIGN SO 
SO 
I THINK 
CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT ONE 
I UH IT'S NOT THIS ONE 
IT'S UH THE THE THE SO I IT'S THE WORKING DESIGN 
SORRY 
COMPONENT DESIGN 
SO THIS YEAH SO THIS IS THE DESCRIBED AS WHAT 
OR YOU INST 
I DON'T THINK SO 
OH 
MAYBE I RECORD RECORDED DIRECTLY ON THE 
COMPUTER 
OKAY OKAY 
YES 
I CAN EASY TO TO YOU WITHOUT 
YEAH EXAC 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IN FACT I DON'T KNOW 
I SEE BECAUSE I IN MY PRESENTATION I DON'T HAVE HERE WITH IS IT WAS IN FACT THE DESIGN IS TO SHOW YOU THE DESIGN OF WHAT IS INSIDE A WHAT IS INSIDE AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT COMPONENT OF THE OR 
OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING AS I COULD SHOW YOU SOME SOME PICTURE OF WHAT IS INSIDE AND SO 
SO I IN FACT THE THE OF SOMETHING I WANT TO DISCUSS IS WHICH KIND OF MATERIAL ARE WE GOING TO USE 
AS WELL IT WILL BE WOODEN WOODEN DI WOODEN REMOTE CONTROL OR A A PLASTIC REMOTE CONTROL LIKE THIS ONE 
SO AND ONE WHICH WHICH WHICH KIND WILL BE THE THE DIFFERENT BU BUTTON IS IT CAN BE SOME YOU KNOW 
CLASSIC PUSHBUTTON LIKE THIS ONE OR YOU HAVE ALSO SOME BUTTON LIKE L. C. D. WHERE YOU KNOW 
THE BUTTON THE BUTTONS ARE UNLIGHTED DURING THE NIGHT OR YOU KNOW YOU CAN USE THEM IN THE DARKNESS 
AND 
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO DISCUSS ALSO SO WHICH KIND OF ALIMENTATION ELECTRIC ALIMENTATION DO YOU WANT TO HAVE 
AS WELL TO BE FOR EXAMPLE UH D UH SOLAR ENERGY ALIMENTATION OR WELL TO BE A BATTERY LIKE THE CLASSICAL BATTERY SO 
AND I THINK THAT FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE ALIMENTATION IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE 
UH BOTH OF THEM AS AS FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME COUNTRY WHERE YOU ARE IN THE THE COUNTRYSIDE AND YOU ARE FAR FROM YOU KNOW 
THE CITIES UH FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME PLACE IN IN S SENEGAL SO IF YOU HAVE ELECTRIC IF YOU HAVE SOLAR ALIMENTATION 
YOU JUST 
WHEN YOU WANT TO HAVE RECHARGER OR REMOTE CONTROL POWER YOU JUST PUT IT IN THE SUN AND AFTER ONE HERE YOU CAN COME AND SO IT CAN BE INTERESTING FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS KIND OF REMOTE CON IT CAN BE SOMETHING INTERESTING TO MAKE PEOPLE BUY IT 
FOR EXAMPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH MM 
ECOLOGISTS YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
ALRIGH 
IN FACT HAVING THEM BOTH WELL IF WE WANT TO HAVE BATTERY 
REGULAR BATTERY AND AND THE SOLAR ENERGY BATTERY IT COULD BE IT'LL IT WILL ADD A LITTLE BIT OF THE PRICE 
BUT IT WILL BE AN ADDED VALUE ALSO THAT WILL BE COMPENSATED SO HMM 
AND THE MATERIALS IT DEPENDS FOR EXAMPLE YOU IF YOU HAVE A WOODEN MATERIAL IT CAN BE MORE THE PLASTIC MATERIAL IS MORE COMMON IT'S VERY RESISTANT BUT 
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WOODEN WILL BE LIKE I DON'T KNOW HIGH CL AS A SPECIAL HIGH CLASS ARE YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE SOME 
YEAH EVEN IF IT IS NOT COMPLETELY WOOD BUT JUST A PART OF THE 
YOU KNOW WILL BE WOODEN IN WOOD AND IT CAN BE INTERESTING 
AND SO THE LAST POINT IS YOU ALSO WOULD DO YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME VERY CHEAP 
INTEGRATED CIR CIRCUITS CHIPS OR DO YOU HAVE LOW LEVEL OR ARE VERY VERY EXPENSIVE 
IT DEPENDS BUT I THINK THAT LOW LEVEL WILL BE YOU KNOW IT IS AN INTERIM MODULE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH I THINK IT WILL FIT IN THE PRICE WE WANT TWEL TWELVE EUROS SO 
I THINK THE BUTTONS I PR I PREFER YOU KNOW 
THE L. C. D. YOU KNOW LIGHTED BUTTONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S I DON'T KNOW UM YEAH IN THE DARK 
IT'S FASHION AND IT'S RELATED TO HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS OUR UH IF YOU WANT TO WATCH T. V. ON THE DARKNESS OR IF YOU WANT TO LO FIND YOUR FIND YOUR YOUR REMOTE CONTROL THAT IS LOST 
YOU KNOW IN THE DARKNESS IT'S VERY EASY AS RIGHT 
I THINK A TOUCH SCREEN 
WILL BE IT IS EXPENSIVE AS THE L. C. D. BUTTONS SO 
BUT AND IT IS A KIND OF OTHER DESIGN I MEAN 
IT CAN ALSO BE INTERESTING TO HAVE THIS KIND OF 
MM 
OH YES 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY YEAH 
OKAY 
AND FRUIT AND VEGETABLES YEAH 
SPONGY 'KAY 
OKAY YEAH YEAH 
YEAH BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHICH KIND OF MATERIAL DO YOU NEED TO TO BE SPONGY 
PLA 
SO 
VERY STUFF OKAY RUBBER RUBBER DESI OKAY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SOLAR 
OKAY 
YEAH 
IT WILL BE A 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
NO WOOD BUT PLASTIC 
WOULD SEEM 
I THINK WE CAN HAVE WOOD FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BOTTOM AND YOU KNOW 
IT DEPENDS ON THE DESIGN WE WANT SO 
YEAH IT'S NATURAL AND I 
AND IT CAN BE CORRELATED TO ENERGY SOLAR ENERGY IS FOR THE MARKETING ASPECT YOU KNOW SAYING THAT IT'S COOL 
MM YEAH IT'S NOT RIGHT SO 
OKAY 
GOOGLE AND 
AND FANCY F HOW ABOUT THE THE VOICE 
AND 
UH MAYBE WE CAN DO SOME MARKETING STUDIES ASKING PEOPLE IF THEY'RE INTERESTED AND HOW 
IT IT IS AN AN INTERESTING CONCEPT TO USE TO HAVE UH VOICE CONTROL 
YEAH 
BUT AND THE PROBLEM IS I I'M WE CAN INFER I IF YOU HAVE V VOICE CONTROL WHY NOT TO PUT IT DIRECTLY ON THE THE T. V. 
SO SPEAK DIRECTLY AT THE T. V. AND YOU DON'T NEED A REMOTE CONTROL ACTUALLY SO 
BUT IT WILL BE EMBEDDED IN THE T. V. AND NOT IN THE REMOTE CONTROL IS 
YEAH L. C. D. 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
AND PF WHAT CAN WE THINK A SUPPLEMENT IT 
I THINK THE SUPPLEMENT CAN BE THE VOICE 
IT IS JUST YOU KNOW IT IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT BUT 
IT CAN BE A PART OF 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
TO PUSH BUTTON YEAH YEAH 
EVEN IT AS FAR AS JUST SOME KIDS YOU KNOW SWITCHING CHANNELS IN TWO THREE FOUR 
YEAH TURNING YEAH YEAH 
NOT VERY COMPLEX COMMANDS BUT EASY COMMANDS SO 
YEAH 
YEAH SIMPLE ONES FOR 
EXPENSIVE BUTTONS YEAH TO MAKE SOME NEW 
YEAH 
OKAY FRUITS 
OKAY 
AND IT TO BE OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SOUNDS GOOD MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO YOU YOU DO THE MINUTES FIRST OR 
NO 
OKAY 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH BUT HOW HOW IS HOW RISKY IS IT TO TRUST LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION OR GESTURE RECOGNITION 
OKAY 
OKAY 
BUT THIS THIS BUT THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN ANYWAY 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THE 
YEAH BUT THIS 
YEAH 
I DON'T THINK IT 
OH OKAY OKAY YOU MEAN IT COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF 
NO 
NO BUT THIS IS DISADVANT DISADVANTAGE 
YEAH 
UH IF YOU IF IF YOU USE THE BASIC 
BUT IT'S IT'S CHANGING HOW THE REMOTE CONTROL IS GONNA BE BUILT 
BECAUSE THEN YOU AND UH 
I MEAN THIS DOESN'T HAVE UH THE POWER TO DO RECOGNITION FOR EXAMPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH THIS COULD BE DOWNLOADED BY THE WEB MAYBE OR 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH BUT THEN WE 
YEAH WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE TWELVE EUROS 
PROBLEM 
OKAY 
NO BUT THEN IT'S IT'S LIKE THIS UH 
YEAH 
BUT YOU WOULD STILL HAVE THE BUTTONS 
OR IS TO DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE ONLY VOICE RECOGNITION AND GESTURE RECOGNITION 
OR YOU YOU STILL HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO USE BUTTONS 
OKAY SO Y YEAH 
YEAH I DUNNO 
IT'S A BIT RISKY RISKY 
YEAH I DUNNO 
WHAT 
IF IF 
I MEAN UH I'M SURE IF THE USER PAYS THE SAME PRICE HE'S HAPPY TO HAVE RECOGNITION 
BUT IF IF IF IT LIKE DOUBLES UH 
NO NO WOULD WOULD BE INTERESTED 
YEAH 
NO I MEAN 
NO BUT YOU AND YOU NEED NEW REMOTE CONTROLLER THEN 
BECAUSE IF YOU WANNA BROWSE INTERNET OR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANNA TYPE SOMETHING OR 
NO 
NO 
CASE FOR EXAMPLE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU W YOU WOULD 
TRUE 
I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE THE GOO Y YOU SAY WE WOULD WE WOULD TO HAVE A GOOGLE LIKE CONTROLLER 
I DON'T SEE HOW ADDING SPEECH OR GESTURE RECOGNITION WOULD MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL LIKE MORE LIKE GOOGLE 
GOOGLE IS IS SIMPLE WORKS FINE 
SO I I GUESS IF CAN HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT IS REALLY BASIC SIMPLE AND WORKS FINE IT'S ALREADY A LOT 
UH TH THIS 
I MEAN THE USER IS NOT ONLY INTERESTED IN HAVING SPEECH OR GESTURE RECOGNITION OR IF HE HAS SOMETHING THAT WORKS FINE AND IS REALLY FANCY 
LOOKS NICE AND IT'S EASY EASY TO USE EASY TO USE 
SO 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM YEAH 
I MEAN I I KNOW IT'S MORE INTERESTING TO DEVELOP A REMOTE CONTROLLER WITH SPEECH AND GESTURE AND WHATEVER 
BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK THE USER IS THE ONE WHO GONNA BUY THE PRODUCT AND SO 
I MEAN THAT'S THE POINT 
HMM 
YEAH 
DUNNO 
I DUNNO IF YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY OR 
I THINK IT'S MORE INTERESTING WHAT HE SAYS OKAY 
YEAH TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SPECIAL FOR 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WHAT ABOUT THE TOUCH SCR TOUCH SCREEN 
FOR EXAMPLE 
IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE I I GUESS 
MM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OH NO TREND WATCHING 
THE OTHER ONE 
YEAH 
UH I THINK SO JUST 
YEAH SO JUST TO MEET THE USER REQUIREMENTS I WOULD JUST DO A S SHORT ANAL ANALYSIS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET AND IT KIND OF UM 
HAVE A BETTER OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S THE FASHION IN GENERAL I'VE CHECKED MORE THAN ONLY THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET IS NEXT 
SO AGAIN IT'S PRETTY MUCH SIMILAR TO WHAT I'VE USED IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
UM USER REALLY REALLY WANT A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
THEY'RE NOT SO SO INTERESTED IN UH FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL OKAY 
LIKE THE ONE YOU'VE SHOWN DAVID WITH ALL THE BUTTONS AND I MEAN I I IT SOUNDS GOOD TECHNICALLY BUT IT'S IT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANT AND UH 
SO SECOND POINT SO THEY STILL WANT TO TO TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
SO MAYBE IT'S SORT OF RELATED TO WHAT YOU'VE SAID WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND SO NO 
AT THE SAME TIME IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT'S EASY TO USE 
SO THAT WERE THE OTHER FIRST POINTS FROM THE REMOTE CONTROL UH ANALYSIS 
NOW I IF WE LOOK AT FASHION IN GENERAL UM 
OKAY 
WHA WHAT WE REALLY IS THIS YEAR IS THAT UH EVERYTHING FROM CLOTHES TO SHOES AND FURNITURE IS IS INSPIRED BY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
OKAY SO I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE DESIGN OF THE THE THING 
'CAUSE IT'S IT'S REALLY WHAT PEOPLE WANT 
EVEN IF IT'S IN GENERAL FASHION WE WANT TO TO BE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THEN UH IF IF WE TAKE THE ORDERING OR THE RANKING OF ALL THE POINTS 
FANCY LOOK AND FEEL HAS AN A SCORE OF SEVEN WOULD HAVE SIX AS IMPORTANCE 
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE IT'S THERE 
THEN EASY TO USE UH IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT ACTUALLY WITH RESPECT TO THERE YOU OTHER ONES 
SO WE SEE FANCY LOOK ON LIKE AND FEEL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE AND THEN IF WE COMBINE THIS WITH THE FASHION UH FROM MILAN AND PARIS 
WE GO TO THE FRUITS AND VEDE VEGETABLES 
AND THE THREE POINT I HAVEN'T MENTION IS PEOPLE WAN WANT TO HAVE A SPONGY TOUCH OKAY SO THIS IS THIS MAYBE DOESN'T REALLY FIT WITH THE WOODEN DESIGN 
I DUNNO 
YEAH TH THIS IS THIS WOULD BE LIKE UM 
PLASTIC LIKE BUT RUBBER MAYB MAYBE YOU KNOW RUBBER LIKE UH 
DEVICE SO UM 
OKAY TH TH THAT WAS THE MAIN POINT I THINK FROM THE TREND 
NO FASHION 
YEAH SO WHEN I THINK IT'S 
MM-HMM 
MAYBE NOT IN WOOD BUT I MEAN M MAYBE NOT THE PART YOU TOUCHING YOU KNOW 
YEAH MAYBE THE BASE 
BUT STILL YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN IT'S NOT EXACTLY RIGHT FOR THE SPONGY POINT OF VIEW 
BUT WE COULD MAYBE HAVE BOTH LIKE PART OF WOOD AND SOME RUBBER FOR THE BUTTONS OR I DUNNO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH D 
I DUNNO 
WHAT INTERFACE 
YEAH NO NOT FORGETTING ABOUT THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES TRENDS 
IF POSSIBLE 
HMM 
OKAY 
YEP 
YEAH 
NO NO NO 
YEAH 
MM 
SO UH FIRST I WILL PRESENT THE CONCEPT OF USER INTERFACE 
UM THERE'S THREE CONCEPTS IN THE USER INTERFACE 
SO FIRST ONE IT'S A GOOGLE CONTROLLER 
THE SECOND IS A FANCY CONTROLLER 
THE LAST ONE IS UH INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER 
SO THERE ARE THREE CONCEPTS IN OUR CONTROLLER 
UM N NEXT I WILL EXPLAIN ONE BY IN THE FIRST IS GOOGLE CONTROLLER 
UM SO I WANT THE CONTROLLER TO BE EASY TO USE BUT WITH SOPHISTICATED FUNCTIONS 
SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF EASY TO USE AND UM SOPHISTICATED FUNCTIONS 
UH THIS IS A FIRST CONCEPT OF OUR CONTROLLER 
THE SECOND CONCEPT IS A FANCY CONTROLLER UM SO WE WANT GIVE THE CUSTOMERS THE IMPRESSION THAT OUR CONTROLLER IS VERY ATTRACTIVE 
UM THEY CAN EASY RECOGNISE OUR CONTROLLER AMONG A LOT OF PRODUCTS 
SO SO THE U THE USER OF THE THE U USER INTERFACE SHOULD BE VERY VERY CUTE VERY VERY G UM 
ATTRACTIVE 
SUCH LIKE THIS THERE ARE SEVERAL UH EXAMPLES IN THE SLIDES 
YEAH IT'S VERY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE 
YEAH 
IT'S HARD IF I IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO REMEMBER IT 
OR TO RECOGNISE IT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THE LAST UH CONCEPT IS INTELLIGENT 
WE WANT UH WE WANT OUR CONTROLLER TO BE SMART SO MAYBE WE SHOULD UH SO UM UH 
TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND GESTURE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY 
SO WE NEED TO HAVE COOP SOME COOPERATION WITH SOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE ON SPEECH RECOGNITION AND UM GESTURE RECOGNITION 
UM 
WITH THIS ADVANCED FEATURES WE I THINK WE CAN ATTRACT A LOT OF USER 
OKAY 
NO 
EITHER THIS IS THE OTHER CONCEPTS OF OUR CONTROLLER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SO 
UH I THINK SOME TIME IT'S VERY UH CONVENIENT TO USE VOICE INTERFACE AND GESTURE INTERFACE THEN USE BUTTON 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU CANNOT FIND YOUR UH CONTROLLER YOU CAN JUST UH JUST JUST UH SPEAK SOMETHING SUCH AS YEAH ONE TWO 
YEAH 
SO YOU CAN USE YOUR GESTURE 
THAT'S NO PROBLEM 
FOR LIMITED VOCABULARY SPEECH RECOGNITION IS VERY RELIABLE AND FOR US LIMITED VOCABULARY GESTURE RECOGNITION IS ALSO VERY 
YEAH 
YEAH THEY CANNOT SPEAK TO THE SAME TIME 
YEAH IT'S VERY INTERESTING 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER 
EVEN YOU UH YOU HAVE THE CONTROLLER I CAN I CAN SAY CHANNEL THREE SO IT'S C COME TO CHANNEL THREE I DON'T HAVE TO 
IT'S ADVANTAGE 
HOW MUCH 
NO NO WE WE DO WE WE JUST OR SO UM 
NO NO WE JUST UM HAVE SOME COOPERATION WITH SOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE WE DON'T HAVE TO DO SOME BASIC RESEARCH ON THIS FIELD 
YEAH I THINK IT'S UH BECAUSE UH THIS TECHNOLOGY IS UH 
UM FOR LIMITED WOR OR LIMITED WOR UH LEXICAL RECOGNITION IT'S VERY 
IT'S UH YEAH 
IT'S 
NO IT'S UH 
EVEN FOR THE OF UM BECAUSE THE THE VOCABULARY THE 
THE VOCABULARY IS VERY SMALL SO THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THE KEY THE KEY UM THE KEY OF OR THE KEY FEATURE OF OUR CONTROLLER IS THAT IT'S IT HAS SOME SOME UM ADAPTATION 
MECHANISM 
IT'S IT'S IT MEANS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SELL THIS CONTROLLER IN CHINA IT'S CAN RECOGNISE CHINESE 
IT'S OR IF YOU SELL THIS CONTROLLER IN FRANCE IT CAN RECOGNISE FRENCH 
YEAH IT'S 
BECAUSE OF THIS PRODUCT UH THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH NO YEAH YEAH THA THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO DO LANGUAGE ADAPTATION 
YEAH 
EVEN FOR EACH OF FOR EVEN FOR DIFFERENT FAMILY WE HAVE TO D D YEAH WE WOULD WE HAVE TO DO ADAPTATION TO 
NO IT'S NOT SO COMPLEX 
NO NO NO IT'S NOT 
I THINK THAT'S NO THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU YOU DON'T HAVE IT WERE A MICROPHONE 
IT IT JUST THE MICROPHONE IS EMBEDDED IN THE CONTROLLER 
WHERE IS THE CONTROLLER 
IT'S IN YOUR FAMILY IN YOUR HOME 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU CAN YOU CAN EMBED IT UH MICROPHONE HERE 
YEAH YEAH JUST YOU JUST PUT THE CONTROLLER HERE THEN YOU 
YOU USE YOUR COMMAND AND YOU DO IS YOUR GESTURE 
NO NO IT'S NO YOU IF YOU LOSE IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK IT WE SHOULD GIVE THE UH FLEXIBILITY TO THE USER AND WE THINK YEAH 
YOU CAN SEE THEY CAN SWITCH FROM ONE MODALITY TO ANOTHER 
NO THAT'S QUITE INTER QUITE ATTRACTIVE 
WELL IF YOU DO LANGUAGE ADAPTATION THERE SHOULD BE ONE PROBLEM 
WE SHOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN TECHNOLOGY 
MORE FEATURES YEAH 
YEAH BUT IF IF YOU STICK TO ME 
STICK TO THE FIRST TWO PARTS 
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR CONTROLLER WITH THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET 
THERE'S NO K FEATURES OF OUR CONTROLLER IS IS THERE IS THERE ANY NECESSARY TO DESIGN NEW CONTROLLER WITHOUT ANY BREAKTHROUGH FEATURES 
WOULD YOU WOULD YOU REPLACE YOUR CONTROLLER WITH A CONTROLLER WITH SIMILAR FUNCTION IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SOME SOME FUNCTION INSIDE IT THAT 
YEAH Y Y THAT'S A FUN THAT'S NOT THE FUNCTION OF THE CONTROLLER THAT'S A FUNCTION OF T. V. 
YOU CAN REPLACE YOUR T. V. WITH A NEW T. V. WITH INTERNET BROWSING FUNCTION BUT 
OKAY 
BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY THE PROBLEM ONLY THE ISSUE OF CONTROLLER IT'S IT'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF THE T. V. 
YEAH BUT WE DO WE DO WE WE WE CANNOT RELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IN THESE FEATURES TO U TO USE THE CONTROLLER 
BUT WITH THE FEATURES OF OUR CONTROLLER SUCH AS YOU HAVE THE FEATURE OF VOICE RECOGNITION IN YOUR MOBILE BUT YOU SELDOM USE IT 
YOUR MOBILE BUT YOU WHEN YOU CHOOSE A NEW MOBILE YOU CHOOSE THE ONE WITH VOICE RECOGNITION 
THAT'S THE FEATURE IS NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RELIABLE BUT IT'S A FEATURE TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCT FROM OUR FROM OTHER PRODUCTS 
YEAH 
YEAH UH 
YEAH IF IF IF IF YOU'RE IF YOU ARE IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A PRODUCT IT WORKS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RELIABLE WOULD YOU REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER ONE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YES BUT THERE'S ONE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL CONTROLLER 
TH THEN NN NO 
THE 
BUT TH THERE'S THERE'S NO THERE'S NO NOT ENOUGH MOTIVATION FOR THEM TO REPLACE THEIR OLD CONTROLLER WITH A NEW ONE IF THERE'S NO KEY FEATURE IN THE NEW CONTROLLER 
THAT'S THE SAME YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
IT DID DIDN'T R RECEIVE IT 
DIDN'T RECEIVE IT 
PARTICIPANT ONE 
PARTICIPANT ONE 
YEAH MAYBE WE CAN FIRST CAME OUT 
UH TO FRAHAN 
WITH FRAHAN THEN YOU CAN PREPARE YOUR SLIDES THEN PRESENT IT LATER 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO YOU GET EMAIL 
MM 
LATER 
PLA 
OH YES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE SMART CONTROLLER 
OKAY 
MM 
YEAH 
IT'S GOOD 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEP 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YOUR JUDGEMENT IT'S IS BASED 
SO WE ARE SO 
LET'S GO FOR OUR DETAILED DESIGN MEETING 
SO I WILL STILL PLAY THE ROLE OF THE SECRETARY AND WE'LL HAVE UM FIRST THE PROJECT PRESENTATION BY OUR USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
DAVID JORDAN AND OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER BABA 
SO WE'LL HAVE TO EVALUATE THE UH YOUR PROPOSED REMOTE CONTROL AND UM HAVE AN IDEA OF THE PRICE THAT UH THIS THING WILL COST 
AND IN CASE IF WE'RE WE ALL AGREE ON THE FABRICA OF UM BUILDING OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL WE'LL EVALUATE THE UM PRODUCTION 
SO MAYBE I WILL LET THE OR TWO DESIGNERS TALK ABOUT IS THERE YOU HAVE S OH SORRY 
OOPS 
LOOKS STRANGE 
OKAY 
GENETICALLY MODIFIED MUSHROOM I WILL SAY BUT KEEP IN SPEAKING 
OH 
MAYBE I HOPE SO 
CHAN 
YEAH OKAY BUT DON'T TOUCH DON'T DESTROY YOUR PROTOTYPE 
EVERYTHING'S MUSHROOM 
SO WE CAN CALL OUR REMOTE CONTROL THE MUSHROOM 
OKAY 
OH 
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
VEGETABLES 
MUSHROOM IS A VEGETABLE 
IT'S VEGETABLE 
SO TH IT'S SOMETHING EATABLE 
NEXT SLIDE 
MM-HMM 
IN THE BASE 
IN THE BASEMENT 
IN THE BASEMENT 
AND WHERE IS THE SOLAR SOLAR CELL 
WHERE IS THE SOLAR CELL 
OH 
DO YOU THINK IT WON'T BE IT WON'T CRIS INCREASE THE PRICE 
OKAY WE'LL SEE AFTER 
WE WILL HAVE FIRST TO USE MISTER MONEY WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ACCORDING TO THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
MM-HMM 
MAYBE IF YOU CHANGE IF YOU TAKE THE BUTTONS IT AND MAYBE DO THINGS LIKE THAT 
IT WOULD BE BIT MORE LIKE A LEMON 
YEAH 
LOOKS LIKE MORE FRUIT 
MAYBE A PINEAPPLE 
AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE 
FINGER HERE WITH THE BUTTONS 
IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A PINEAPPLE 
SORRY 
WHAT'S THE S FOR THAT 
AND WHERE IS THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO IT BITTER LIKE THAT 
LOOKS OKAY LET'S SAY IT'S A PINEAPPLE NOW 
IT LOOKS LIKE A NEW YOU TAKE IT 
IT LOOKS LIKE A PINEAPPLE WITH CHERRY ON TOP 
MM UH 
SEVEN IS THE UM THE MAXIMUM 
THERE I WILL SAY THREE 
ISN'T IT BITTER LIKE THAT 
FEASIBLE 
YOU SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT YOU THERE'S UM MICROPHONE INSIDE ONE 
OH 
OKAY AND YOU HAVE THE THERE'S THE TECHNOLOGY INSIDE THAT RECOGNISE SIMPLE VOCAL COMMENTS 
AND YOU CAN TURN IT SO MAYBE IT'S TECHNO TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOV INNOVATIVE 
WE HAVE TACTILE BUTTONS 
OH YEAH 
MAYBE TWO 
TWO 
I WOULD SAY TWO 
YOU AGREE 
IT'S BETTER LIKE THAT ISN'T IT 
OKAY 
AH OK I UNDERSTAND 
YOU TAKE TAKE THE REMOTE IS AND YOU CAN TURN LIKE THAT TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL 
I THINK IT'S QUITE EASY TO S S ZAPPING BUT MAYBE IT WILL BE TOO FAST 
YEAH YOU HAVE A LIKE THAT AND SO NO 
OH YEAH 
YEAH BUT YOU BUT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS IF YOU WANT TO GO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU'RE ZAPPING YOU'RE CHANGING FROM ONE CHANNEL TO THE OTHER SO YOU'RE PASSING THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS 
SO WHEN YOU SAY I WANT TO GO TO THE CHANNEL NUMBER TWENTY THAT'S YOU'VE DECIDED TO GO TO CHANNEL TWENTY 
SO YOU CAN SAY CHANNEL TWENTY OR CHANNEL FOUR BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT TO GO ON THIS CHANNEL 
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TO DO ZAPPING YOU YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO YOU CAN TURN IT 
JUST GO THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS AND MAYBE STOP IF THERE IS SOMETHING INTERESTING 
SEEMS TO BE GOOD 
GOOD CHOICE MISTER DAVID JORDAN 
YEAH WHAT'S WHAT'S THIS CHERRY 
OKAY 
YEAH THE YOU HAVE THE VOCAL COMMANDS 
ON OFF 
MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE THE YEAH IT'S A SLEEPING REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT'S TRUE 
W THAT WHY WE HAVE THE SOLAR TI YEAH 
SO THERE 
DO YOU AGREE 
THERE 
AND WHAT'S YOUR OPINION 
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID PREVIOUSLY 
PREVIOUSLY YOU SAID THAT TURNING THIS WAS THE FINE 
FINE TO COARSE 
AND FROM TEN TO TEN CHANNELS HERE 
OKAY 
OH 
YEAH NO NO NO 
YOU CAN'T PUT IT IT 
IT'S JUST YOUR TRAINING FROM THE BASE 
YOU NEED TO HAVE EVERYTHING IN HAND 
IF YOU WANT TO TURN YOU CAN'T USE IT AND TURN 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
YOU NEED TO PUT IT ON AND TURN 
YEAH BUT NOBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE IT IN THE POCKET AND BRING IT IN THE KITCHEN AND SAY I'VE LOST THE REMOTE CONTROL 
NOBODY WOULD TAKE IT 
SO NOBODY WE WILL LOST LOSE IT 
SO MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE FROM THE 
FOUR 
EASY TO USE FOR 
GONNA SAY FOUR 
TROIS 
THERE 
SO THE THE PROJECT IS ACCEPTED 
BUT I D UM I THINK THAT IT WILL BE GOOD TO DO SOME MORE WORK TO TRANSFORM THIS INTO A PINEAPPLE 
IF YOU ARE WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE A FRUITFUL REMOTE CONTROL 
SO UH MM MM 
MM 
OKAY AND WE WE HAD A PROJECT PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION WITH THE 
EVALUATION 
SO SO WE ALL AGREE TO ACCEPT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THE PROTOTYPE WE'LL HAVE LOOK AT THE FINAL SH FINANCIAL VIEW 
SO WE NEED TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCTION COST 
SO I SAID IN THE FIRST MEETING WE NEED TO HAVE AS A REMOTE CONTROL THAT WOULD COST NOT MORE THAN TWELVE AND POINT FIFTY EUROS 
AND IF NOT IF IT'S NOT THE CASE YOU YOU WOULD HAVE TO REDESIGN IT 
SO JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE OKAY HERE IS THE 
EXCEL 
SHIT IS IS IT HAS THE ENERGY SOURCE 
WE HAVE HAND DYNAMO 
NO WE DON'T SEE THAT 
WE HAVE BATTERY RIGHT 
KINETIC WE DON'T HAVE TO I SUPPOSE BUT WE HAVE SOLAR CELLS 
UM HOW MANY DO YOU DO YOU NEED SOLAR CELLS 
DO YOU THINK ONE WOULD BE ENOUGH OR SUCH AS 
SO NUMBER OF BRANCHES 
THERE 
SO ELECTRONIC 
SINGLE SIMPLE CHIP ON PRINT 
JUST ONE WOULD BE NECESSARY 
NO 
ZERO FOR THE OTHERS 
AND SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER 
NO 
SO WE HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION I THINK 
SO THE CASE 
OKAY JUST KEEP IN GOING JUST TO HAVE AN IDEA 
WELL UH YEAH BUT WHAT WHAT ABOUT CASE 
UNCURVED FLAT SINGLE CURVED DOUBLE CURVED 
I THINK IT'S MORE LIKE DOUBLE CURVED 
NO 
UH WOOD 
UH DO WE NEED SPECIAL COLOUR 
YOU MAYBE TWO 
WE HAVE TWO SPECIAL COLOURS 
PUSH BUTTON 
OKAY 
SCROLL WHEEL 
WE DONE IN 
IT IT'S MORE LIKE INTEGRATED SCOR 
YEAH MAYBE TWO SCROLL WHEEL AS WE HAVE THE COARSE COARSE TO FINE SCROLL WHEEL 
SO ONE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS 
OKAY 
OKAY W I THINK WE HAVE PROBLEM 
I THINK WE SEE IF WE KEEP IN ADDING THINGS SO WE HAVE TO 
MAYBE IF WE OUT OF SUPPOSE IF WE CHANGE AND WE GO PUT JUST ONE 
HAS TO CHANGED 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT WE HAVE YOU THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION ON 
OKAY 
OR IT WOULD BE BETTER 
SO DO WE NEED SPECIAL COLOUR 
BECAUSE WE HAVE RED 
RED AND YELLOW 
I THINK SO WE NEED IF WE TRY TO HAVE A KIND OF 
PINEAPPLE BEE 
YEAH 
NO BUT WE HAVE INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL WITH PUSH DUT BUTTON 
AND I THINK THIS IS NO 
INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON 
SO WE'LL WE HAVE ONLY ONE 
AND PUSH BUTTON 
SO IF WE HAVE ALL INTEGRATED I IN THE SCROLL WHEEL AND PUSH BUTTON IT'S UH 
SOMETHING FLAT 
SO UNCURVED 
YEAH MAYBE NOT 
YEAH 
MM 
NEARLY 
MAYBE DON'T BUT ONE BATTERY ONLY SOLAR CELLS 
I THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE PUSH PUSH BUTTON 
WE ONLY AND MAYBE JUST ONE 
JUST ONE 
YEAH 
SO YEAH YOU WILL HAVE IS ONE BUTTON AND SO 
SCROLL WHEEL WITH PUSH BUTTON ON IT 
SO 
SO YEAH 
TO THINK WE WE'VE DONE GOOD JOB IS THE COST US 
TWELVE FIFTY E 
YEAH BUT IT'S UNDER OR EQUAL 
IT'S NOT WRITTEN 
SOMETIMES IT'S UNDER OR EQUAL 
TWELVE FIFTY 
YEAH I THINK 
I THINK YEAH 
BUT IT WOULD I BE INTERESTING FOR OUR MARKETING TIME TO MAKE A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT CONCERNING THESE SOLAR CELLS TO BE 
YEAH BUT IT WILL BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOV INNOVATIVE SO 
SO IT'S EASY TO USE AND POWERFUL AS THE REMOTE CONTROL A HAS ONLY ONE BUTTON 
EASY POWERFUL 
SO I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO REDESIGN THE P THE PRODUCT 
YEAH 
SO 
NOW 
SO 
SO DID YOU ENJOY YOUR CLAY MODELLING 
YEAH 
WAS IT A NICE WAY TO CREATE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
AND FOR THE MARKETING GUY 
AND NEW IDEAS ABOUT NEW PRODUCTS MAYBE W WHICH WOULD BE FASHION AND UH 
AND YELLOW 
YES JUST LEMON 
SQUARED 
UH THE LEMON T. V. WITH THE PINEAPPLE REMOTE CONTROL 
OH THAT'S INTERESTING 
YOU COULD IF WE COULD DO A KIND OF FRUIT COLLECTION OF ELECTRONICS THINGS 
ELECTRONIC DEVICE 
MAYBE 
YEAH MAYBE LA NEXT YEAR IT WILL BE INSECTS 
CUSTOMABLE T. V. 
UH SUCH YEAH 
YOU'VE ALREADY SAID MOBILE PHONES 
YEAH AND FOLLOWING 
MM 
IT'S INTERESTING MAYBE WE CAN CREATE A A LINE OF UH T. V. WITH UH A A TRUE 
SO I THINK THE COSTS ARE WITHIN THE BUDGET 
WE'RE JUST TO TWELVE FIFTY EUROS 
SO DO YOU THINK YOU CAN CELEBRATE YOUR CREATION 
OH THANKS A LOT 
THANK YOU MISTER DAVID JORDAN 
THE THING NOW IS IT TO SELL IT 
IT'S MAYBE A LITTLE BIT EXPENSIVE 
MAYBE WHAT YOU CAN DO A TEST 
PUT IT OUTSIDE AND IF BEES COME IT'S REALLY FRUIT 
BUT DON'T PUT SUGAR IN IT IT'S NOT WORKING 
YEAH BUT THE COLOUR I THINK THE COLOUR IS MORE IS MOST IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE I I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE EVER SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH BUT WE DECIDED TO HAVE SOMETHING YELLOW AND RED FOR THE COSTS 
SO MAYBE WE CAN JUST INTEGRATE IT IN THE ONE ONE SIDE THE DOUBLE R. 
SO WE HAVE THE LOGO WE HAVE THE COLOUR AND WE HAVE THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS SO WE HAVE THE SLOGAN IT 
YEAH THE NO IT'S THE IT'S THE PINEAPPLE CONTROL REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S A PINEAPPLE NOW IT HAS CHANGED 
IT'S A PINEAPPLE 
PINEAPPLE 
WITH CHERRY ON TOP 
WELL YOU BUY ONE 
TRY TO 
OKAY UH 
ONE THING I LIKE IS THE SHAPE 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE THE UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR POCKET ON UH IN YOUR JACKET 
I PREFER THE LASER REMOTE CONTROL 
NO 
OH 
MAYBE NEXT IF WE DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING WE'D CAN PUT LIGHT INSIDE 
YEAH 
I THINK IT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO JUST TO SEE IF WE CAN IF PEOPLE WILL BUY THIS ONE AND MAYBE ADD SOME FEATURES AT IT AFTER YEAH 
SO 
CHAMPAGNE MISTER BABA 
SO 
OKAY I WILL CLOSE THIS 
MM 
SO I THINK WE HAVE FINISHED THE DESIGNING AND THE EVALUATION OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
AND WE HAVE A NEARLY FINAL PRODUCT 
FINAL PROTOTYPE RIGHT 
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
VERY PRODUCTIVE 
MM-HMM 
IS READY 
SORRY I I UM I'M AFRAID 
UH TH THIS REMOTE CONTROL WILL STAY A PROTOTYPE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
EFFECTIVELY ONE SLIDE AND MAYBE WE CAN DISCUSS EVERYTHING 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH YEAH I'M SURE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT LIKE REALLY MUSHROOM BECAUSE YOU HAVE UH YOU KNOW UH LIKE LEMON SHAPE YOU KNOW CENTRE IS YELLOW AND TO DO 
TO INTEGRATE YOU KNOW YEAH 
I DON'T THINK I HOPE NOBODY WILL IT IT 
YOU KNOW TO INTEGRATE THE FRUIT ASPECT YOU KNOW THE THE ONE 
REALLY 
BUT 
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SO MUSHROOM WAS A KIND OF YOU KNOW UH 
MUSHROOM 
UH UH I'M NOT SURE 
WE CAN IT'S A VEG A KIND OF VEGETABLE BUT YOU KNOW W WE INTEGRATED THEM WITH DIFFERENT COLOUR 
I I THINK WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE YOU KNOW 
THIS YOU KNOW VERY ENLIGHTED COLOURS YOU KNOW 
AND INSPIRED COLOUR AND AND VERY SOPHISTICATED MATERIAL IS 
AND SO 
SO WHAT WE W WHAT I CAN ADD IS THAT YOU KNOW UH TALK ABOUT WHAT IS OUTSIDE 
SO WHAT IS INSIDE IS WHAT WE DIS WHAT WE TALKED BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW THE CHIP TO USE A LOW LEVEL CHIP AND 
YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED TO K 
YOU KNOW W THE LOW LEVEL CHIPS INSIDE AND YOU KNOW THE L. C. D. BUTTON AND THE I 
THE BATTERY IT IS UNDER 
IT IS IN THE IN IN THE BASE YEAH 
IN FACT THIS THIS THIS THIS IS A KIND OF YOU KNOW REVOLUTIONARY SOLAR RECEPTOR THAT WE CAN PUT OUTSIDE AND I DON'T THINK SO 
BUT IT IT'S MIGHT BE OKAY SO 
I IT MIGHT BE OKAY 
SO 
YEAH 
SO FOUR POINT THREE POINT FIVE IT MEANS IT'S ACCEPTABLE 
OOPS 
I THINK YOU HAVE NICE COLOURS 
I DON'T THE SH THE BOWL SHAPE PEOPLE LIKE 
SO IT REALLY FANCY 
BUT IT'S YOU HAVE THE LEMON ASPECT OF THOSE TH THIS THIS THING 
DO DON'T DO THAT PLEASE 
I IT'S IT'S I THIS SHAPE IS A LEMON LIKE SO 
YEAH 
BECAUSE I 
LESS BUTTON 
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTON NOW 
THAT'S UH YEAH SO THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
SO THAT'S GREAT 
THAT'S GREAT 
I HAVE AN IDEA IS 
I HAVE AN IDEA WHAT 
IF IT IS FANCY OR NOT 
SO WE CAN WE CAN SAY IT 
THE COLOUR IS THE COLOUR ACCEPTABLE 
SO THE SHAPE NOW 
IT'S TOO MUCH RED 
IN THE BASEMENT 
I WILL GIVE I WILL 
I'LL GO 
I'LL GIVE TWO OR THREE 
THERE IT'S OKAY 
THERE THERE 
THERE IS FINE FOR ME 
WHAT OTHER 
SO IT EASY TO USE 
YOU UH 
EMBEDDED 
IT'S A MICRO ARRAY OKAY 
OH YEAH YEAH 
AND I THINK YOU YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A OR A ROUND REMOTE CONTROL IS IT IS 
I 
W YEAH BUT 
I SEE YOU HAVE MICROPHONE ARRAY EMBEDDED 
YOU HAVE THAT'S GOOD 
AND YOU HAVE YOU KNOW THIS KI THIS SOLAR RECEPTOR THAT YOU KNOW YES 
YEAH 
I THINK TECHNICALLY IT'S ACCEPTABLE SO 
YEAH 
TWO YEAH TWO 
IT'S IT'S FINE SO 
MOST 
UH FOR THE THE VOCAL COMMAND YES IT'S MIGHT BE EASY 
BUT IT'S JUST SPEAKING 
YOU JUST NEED THE COMMAND 
IS A PRINCIPLE 
I THINK MAYBE IF YOU UH 
IF YOU HEAR SOME CLICK 
YEAH IT WOULD 
OH YEAH THAT'S DIFFICULT 
THAT'S DIF THAT'S DIFFICULT 
YEAH BUT YOU HOW YOU NEED TO KNOW I 
I THINK SOMETHING THAT YEAH 
AND YOU YOU CAN 
I THINK YOU CAN IF YOU HAVE A SCALE SO 
YEAH IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT 
I THINK ABO ABOUT THE THE VOCAL COMMAND IS EASY TO 
YOU CAN SAY FIFTY AND FIFTY IT'S OKAY SO 
OH YEAH AND YOU THAT'S YEAH 
YEAH 
IT IS UH YEAH UH 
YEAH 
AND BUT I'D 
IT IS A TURN OFF TO TURN OFF BUTTON MAYBE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S 
THAT'S VERY TECHNOLOGIC SO 
YEAH 
SO BUT I D I DIDN'T SEE WHERE THE OUT OF THE TURN OFF TO TURN ON TURN OFF BUTTON AS MUCH ACTIVATES MAYBE ONE OF THE 
UH IT'S K ON OFF YEAH 
YEAH SLEEPING 
TO COMPENSATE 
YEAH 
EASY TO USE IT'S VERY RELATIVE BUT THERE IT'S FINE I THINK IT'S REASONABLE THREE 
THERE IF THERE FOR ME IT'S O IT'S OKAY 
FOUR OR THREE 
MAYBE YOU CAN VOTE TO SEE HOW MANY EVERYBODY GIVES AND ONE AND JUST TAKE THE MENU 
WELL YOU GIVE 
FOUR 
FIVE 
YEAH SO MAYBE IF 
YEAH BUT YOU YOU KNOW 
YOU JUST PUSH TWO BUTTON ZERO AND AND ONE 
AND THAT'S 
ARE THERE SOME BUTTONS 
OKAY 
IN FACT IN A FLAT PLACE 
YOU CAN 
UH Y YES THAT'S RIGHT 
OH MY GOD 
YEAH MAYBE MAYBE MAY IT'S THE NEXT PROTOTYPE MAYBE WE C 
FOUR 
MAYBE FOUR IT'S OKAY 
I'LL PUT FOUR 
YEAH FOR IT'S MORE REASONABLE 
YOU CAN YOU CAN ERASE WITH THESE ARE YEAH 
YEAH FOR IT'S MORE REASONABLE SO 
SO IT'S NINE NINE OVER THERE 
OH YEAH IT'S 
IT AND MAYBE SOME WO FURTHER WORK BUT IT'S 
YEAH UH SO YEAH 
MIGHT IT MIGHT BE FINE 
YEAH B I THINK 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S THE FINANCE 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
YEAH WE HAVE BATTERY 
NO UM SOLAR CELLS YEAH 
UH I THINK IN EACH BALL YOU HAVE THEIR THEIR UH YEAH THERE YEAH 
THREE THREE SOLAR CELLS 
SO SO SIMPLE SIMPLE YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
NO MAYBE YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SO IT 
SO SH IT 
WOODEN 
SO YES A WOODEN PL I AND THAT'S THERE'S NO WOOD IS PLASTIC JUST ONLY I THINK 
DOUBLE CURVE YEAH DOUBLE CURVE 
NO YOU HAVE 
BUT IT'S YEAH A A RUBBER UH 
YEAH YEAH 
Y Y YEAH YEAH 
FIVE 
I THINK THAT THIS WILL BE LIKE A SCROLL WHEEL ACTUALLY 
YOU YOU TO YOU TURN YOU TURN IT IS 
YEAH TRUE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY YEAH YEAH 
SCORE 
L. C. DISPLAY MAYBE 
INTERFACE 
IT'S OKAY 
FINE 
YEAH IT WAS STAGE ONE IS 
SO 
I THINK YOU CAN TRANSFORM THE WOOD INTO PLASTIC MAYBE 
BECAUSE UH IT SEEMS THAT THIS CAN BE YEAH WOOD INTO PLASTIC AND IT IT SHOULD BE FINE 
YEAH RED AND YELLOW 
FANCY 
NO 
I CAN REMOVE MAYBE IF YOU HAVE FIVE WITH PUSH BUTTONS SO WE CAN JUST I DUNNO TRY TO MODIFY SOME OF THEM TO HAVE YEAH 
DOUBLE CURVE 
WE CAN TRANSFORM THE DOUBLE CURVE INTO SINGLE C YEAH 
OF SOME 
SINGLE CURVE 
SINGLE CURVE SHOULD BE FINE SO 
UH WHAT 
IT'S IT'S A BAD IDEA IS 
TWO 
NO 
THAT'S FINE 
THAT'S FINE 
ONE IS ONE SCROLL WHEEL IS AND THE VOCAL CHORD IT'S FINE 
IT I TH IT'S FINE 
IT'S FINE 
IT'S UNDER OR EQUAL 
IT'S FINE SO 
IT'S FINE TWELVE FIFTY UH 
THE SOLAR CELLS ARE SO I SEE IT 
YEAH TO BE ABLE TO USE TO SELL IT 
YEAH WITH UM 
IT'S IT IS REALLY REALLY UH REALLY VERY VERY EXPENSIVE THOUGH 
MAYBE IF UH OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
IT'S EASY TO USE 
IT'S VERY EASY TO USE 
NO 
WE'VE DONE IT WITH IT IS UNDER THE IF IT WAS LOW HIGH OR SO 
SO 
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THIS PROJECT EVALUATION 
OKAY OKAY IT'S FINE 
YEAH I THINK I FIND IT REALLY FUNNY AND AMAZING AND INTERESTING TO GO THROUGH ALL THE PROCESS IT FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END 
AND DESIGNING LOOKING AT THE CHIPS THE SOLAR CELLS AND UH AND IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE FOR 
YEP 
OKAY OKAY 
YELLOW 
I THINK YOU CAN THINK ABOUT A YELLOW T. V. NOW AFTER A FRUIT T. V. OR I DUNNO 
IT CAN BE AN INTERESTING I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH JUST A LEMON T. V. IT'D BE YELLOW LEMON 
IT'S FLAT UH 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
IT'S REALLY BORING YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S THAT WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING ACTUALLY 
DEVICE DEVI 
THE FRUIT

BUT I THINK IT'S GOOD TO FOLLOW THE F FLOW AND YOU KNOW MAKE IT NOW AND AFTER 
YOU KNOW IF THE PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MIND YOU CHANGE ALSO THE PRODUCT 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S A YEAH YEAH 
WE CAN THINK ABOUT T. V. WITH YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE YOU KNOW THE ASPECTS O LIKE FOR THE CELL PHONES YOU KNOW 
YEAH YOU CUSTOMISE IT VERY IT IS VERY OUT OF PEOPLE CHANGE YOU JUST CHANGE THE APPEARANCE AND YOU YOU YOU CAN KEEP 
YEAH YOU CAN KEEP THE GLOBAL APPEARAN 
THE MADE OF PERSONS THE FASHIONS UH 
WE NOT 
YEAH T. V. YEAH 
A T. V. FOR AUTUMN AND A T. V. FOR WINTER YOU KNOW SO IT'S 
SO WHAT I AND DO WE USE IT OKAY 
YEAH THE PR IT 
YEAH BUT I THINK IF IT'S REALLY A CELEBRATING OBJECT 
SO IT'S YELLOW AND VERY A VERY UH IT'S VERY HAPPY SO

I P IS THE YOU THE THE YELLOW BALL THING THAT 
UH OF LIKE YOU WE CAN WE CAN PUT SOME UH DOUBLE R. 
OKAY YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD IDEA IS 
IT'S NOT A MUSHROOM 
IT'S A PINEAPPLE REMOTE CONTROLS 
YEAH PINEAPPLE REMOTE REMOTE CONTROL 
UH THAT 
UH AND UH UNIDENTIFIED REMOTE CONTROL IS 
THAT'S THAT'S PINEAPPLE REMOTE CONTROL 
I THINK IT'S FINE 
YEAH 
YEAH I WILL TRY I'LL TRY 
I CAN HEL I WILL TRY VERSIONS SO IT IS HOW EASY EASY TO MANAGE 
YEAH I ALWAYS LOSE MY YEAH SO SO I IF IT IS A UNIVERSAL ONE I CAN USE IT WITH MY T. V. IS IT WOULD BE 
I THINK I WOULD CHOOSE THIS ONE BECAUSE OF THE COLOUR

I LIKE IT 
NEXT TIME 
WELL I'LL BUY ONE HERE 
YEAH 
NO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
FINAL PROTOTYPE YEAH Y YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO SO WHO IS GOING TO TAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
NO NOT REALLY 
JUST 
CRAP 
OKAY 
'KAY SO WHE WHERE IS THE REMOTE CONTROL 
YEP 
WHAT SLIDES 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE MUSHROOM WAS NOT IN THE TRENDS 
I MEAN THERE WAS FRUITS YEAH 
YEAH 
I DON'T THINK IT IS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BUT ANYWAY THIS IS NOT A MUSHROOM ANYWAY SO IT'S FINE 
NO I MEAN YEAH YEAH 
INSPIRA INSPIRATION SO 
TRUE 
BUT WE SAY UH W SO WE SAID SOLAR 
YEAH 
I MEAN WE GONNA TRY TO MEASURE HOW 
GOOD TO USE INSTEAD OF JUST TALKING ABOUT UH WE HAD THREE KEYS KEY POINTS TO UH FOR THIS REMOTE CONTROL DESIGN AND FIRST ONE WAS UH 
FANCY 
LIKE AND FEEL 
SO WE WE'LL TRY TO JUDGE THIS FEATURE UH WITH A ONE TO SEVEN SCALE ONE BEING UH NO I THINK 
UH JUST LET ME CHECK 
NO ONE BEING TRUE AND SEVEN BEING FALSE 
OKAY 
OUCH 
SO 
DO WE HAVE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL ACCORDING TO YOU 
BUT IS IT 
UH I'LL AGREE IT'S UNIQUE ABOUT IS IT REALLY 
YEAH I MEAN FANCY WAS WAS DEFINED BY S FRUIT AND VEGETABLE LIKE 
YEAH 
I DUNNO WHERE THE LEMON IS BUT I MEAN IT'S NOT OBVIOUS 
IF 
I DUNNO MAYBE IMPROVING THE TEXTURE OF LIKE HAVING IT LESS SMOOTH OR 
YEAH 
I DUNNO 
YEAH IT'S GETTING 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S 
WAIT TH THAT'S THE SECOND POINT 
FIRST ONE SO WE HAVE TO JUDGE THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
I MEAN 
IN THE COLOUR IS OKAY THAT'S FINE 
I MEAN IT'S BUT I WOULD SAY THERE IS MORE TOO MUCH RED 
UM IF 
RIGHT 
SO FROM ONE TO SEVEN 
NO SEVEN IS FALSE AND ONE IS TRUE 
THERE 
OKAY 
THERE 
THEN UH LET ME 
THE OTHER CRITERION IS IS IT TECHNOLOGICALLY UH TECHNOLOGICALLY IN INNOVATIVE 
YEAH BU BUT WHEN YOU SAY TECHNOLOGICALLY IT'S MORE UH I DUNNO IN THE CORE OR SINGLE 
MM-HMM 
NO THAT'S GOOD 
YEAH 
YEAH THA THAT'S ANOTHER REALLY GOOD POINT 
MAYBE OKAY 
SO USING THE SAME SCALE TWO 
OKAY 
NOW MAYBE THE MOST CRITICAL ONE 
L LAST ONE W I WOULD LIKE TO JUDGE IS 
SO IT EASY TO USE 
YEAH BUT THIS THIS TURNING CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST RE EXPLAIN UM THE 
PLEASE 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT HOW HOW INTUITIVE IS IT TO TURN THINGS TO CHANGE CHANNELS 
LIKE IF YOU WANT TO GO FROM 
YEAH BUT IMAGINE YOU YOU 
YEAH I'M I'M NO I'M NOT DEFINITELY CONVINCED IT'S IT'S THE BEST WAY IT IF YOU WANNA JUMP FROM I DUNNO ONE TO TWENTY 
HOW CAN YOU GO DIRECTLY TO TWENTY FOR EXAMPLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I AGREE 
I AGREE 
BUT I MEAN IF YOU'RE FRO FROM TWO 
YEAH J JUST IMAGINE YOU HAVE FIFTY FIFTY CHANNELS UH 
WE'RE NOT TALKING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HOW DO HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS ANGLE IS THE USE THE CORRECT ONE 
SO YOU YOU COUNT ONE DEGREE TWO DEGREES NO 
I DON'T THINK SO 
YEAH VOC VOCAL COMMAND IS OKAY 
BUT WE WE'VE SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE L THE MENU 
AND THIS WOULD BE MORE FOR BROWSING AH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I MEAN YOU'RE FAMOUS 
YOU 
MM 
OKAY THE UH TH THIS LOOKS BETTER 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT IT HAS TO BE ONE TO RECOGNISE FAS 
OH THAT'S NOT THE ECOLOGICAL PART YEAH 
SOLAR 
SO WHICH NUMBER 
SO REASONABLY AS FAR AS ONE 
SO THERE 
UH WE WOULDN'T SAY I MEAN THESE ARE SORT OF AGREED BUT THIS ONE WOULD BE MORE FIVE TO ME 
I'D LIKE I MEAN THIS IS THE JUST A PROTOTYPE 
I'M NOT REALLY CONVINCED IT'S IS EASY TO USE BUT I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
SO YOU HAVE YEAH 
UH BY PUSHING ZERO AFTER AFTER THE FIRST ONE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IF YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR MIND 
FINE TO COARSE 
OKAY 
BUT THIS THIS HAS TO STAY IN THE TABLE RIGHT 
THIS HAS TO STAY IN THE TABLE 
YEAH BUT THEN UH WHEN YOU TURN TURN IT 
JUST 
IT'S 
YEAH 
YOU KNOW TH THAT'S THE WEAK POINT BECAUSE WITH A TRADITIONAL ONE YOU JUST HAVE ONE HAND 
SURE 
YEAH YOU WOULD NEVER YOU WOULD NEVER LOSE THIS ONE YEAH 
YEAH 
FOUR 
UH IT'S EVEN EASIER TO MAYBE 
OK 
MM 
SO AVERAGE 
THERE 
OKAY SO 
YEAH ESPECIALLY IN THE EASY TO USE 
TARGET 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
NO 
SO WE ARE ALL ALREADY NINETEEN 
YEAH 
THAT'S GONNA BE DOUBLE CURVED YEAH 
RATHER FOUR BUTTONS 
OH NO INTERFACE 
YEAH YEAH THAT'S SPECIAL COLOURS SURE 
YEAH THA THAT'S WHEEL 
YEAH 
I THINK THE PRICE IS OKAY 
UM ONE 
YEAH W ONE OF THE M KEY POINT IS SOLAR CELLS 
YEAH 
NO YOU I IT DID CHANGE BUT JUST IMAGINE WE HAVE 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THIS ONE ONE OF THE AFTER WE WERE NOT REALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH OF 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S ONE OF THE REQUIREMENT 
WE COULD TURN WE COULD TURN EVERYTHING IN THEIR YELLOW OR BLACK 
BLACK THEN AS A REGULAR COLOUR SO 
YEAH NO 
YEAH 
SO PUSH BUTTON THEN IT'S IT'S THE NEXT EXPENSIVE NO 
YEAH TH THIS MIGHT BE 
CLOSE IT 
OKAY SO WHAT'S THE BOTTLENECK 
DOUBLE CURVED 
YEAH BUT FLAT 
CASE WHAT'S THE C 
AND THEN ONE EURO LEFT 
UM 
UM 
SO WE HAVE ONE BUTTON 
NO WHILE 
IT'S GOOD THEY'RE NOT CHARGING ANYTHING FOR THAT 
YEAH YOU ACTUALLY IT'S WRONG 
WE'RE NOT UNDER TWELVE EUROS AND A HALF 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SOLAR CELLS 
YEAH 
THAT'S NICE ARGUMENT BUT IF IT'S IT'S STILL FOR OUR OF TWELVE 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WE JUST HAVE ONE BUTTON 
EASY 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT POWERFUL 
YEAH 
MM 
OH THAT'S WHAT WE'VE JUST DONE 
YEAH 
UM 
OKAY 
WELL I THINK WE HAVE JUST HAVE TO DISCUSS IF 
I DUNNO 
UH TH THAT WAS GOOD BUT WE SHOULD HAVE MORE BRAINSTORMING LIKE MEETINGS MAYBE 
'CAUSE WE JUST PRESENTING ONE IS PRESENTING HIS STUFF 
NEXT ONE HIS STUFF AND THEN WE TRY TO COMBINE AFTERWARDS SO IT UM 
YEAH BUT JUST DON'T TRUST TOO MUCH THE TRENDS 
'CAUSE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IT WON'T LAST FOR TEN YEARS UH 
MAYBE TWO YEARS IT'S DEAD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THIS IS GOOD BECAUSE IT'S NOT A LONG LONG LIFE PRODUCT 
T. V. S MORE LIKE FIFTEEN YEARS MAYBE SO 
IF YOU HAVE A LEMON LEMON T. V. FOR 
FIFTEEN YEARS 
YEAH YEAH 
TH THAT WOULD THAT WOULD MAKE IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
IT'S PARTY PARTY REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
YEAH I THINK IT'S 
IT'S CHEAP YEAH 
NO I 
I'M NOT AS HAPPY ABOUT THE FRUIT SHAPE YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
IN THE COLOURS ARE UH IT'S PERFECT YEAH 
TRUE 
OH YEAH ANOTHER THING IS THE LOGO IS MISSING STILL 
OH 
STILL THAT WAS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE HAD 
IT'S YEAH BUT IT I DON'T THINK IT'S SUCH A PROBLEM JUST PUTTING THE LOGO SOMEWHERE 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
CUT IN 
YOU CANNOT SAY MUSHROOM BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE TREND 
IT'S NOT THE TREND 
YEAH BUT JUST FLYING SAUCER OR 
I WOULD SAY FLYING SAUCER 
IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE SOMEHOW 
MM 
MM 
YEAH BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW 
WE HAD SOME PROBLEMS GOING TO TWELVE EUROS AND UH I DUNNO 
YEAH AFTERWARDS IF 
IF IT'S A NEW TREND 
OKAY 
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE 
MM 
YEAH 
OUR FINAL PROTOTYPE WHICH YEAH

THERE'S TWO KIND OF BALLS THE SMALLER THE THE THE SO YOU CAN C YOU CAN C YOU CAN CONTROL THE SCALE 
BUT IN THE TRADITIONAL CONTROLLER HOW DO HOW CAN YOU CONTROL THE SCALE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH Y Y YOU CAN DO IT 
BUT YOU CAN ALSO DO IT IN THE B IF YOU YOU DO NOT W IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BROWSING ALL THE CHANNEL YOU CAN JUST P THERE'S ALSO A BUTTON HERE

OKAY 
THANKS 
UH ALMOST 
READY 
I'M UH MICHAEL 
I'M THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
UH WELL IF ONE ONE ELSE WANTS TO YEAH 
OKAY SO WANT ME TO DRAW MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
LET'S SEE 
WELL I DON'T REALLY HAVE A FAVOURITE ANIMAL BUT UM UH I THINK I HAVE IN IN MIND IS UH 
I'M GONNA ABOUT THE UH SPIDER BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY DRAW IT PRETTY WELL IN THE CORNER OF A WHITE BOARD 
THE SPIDER HAS A SPIDER LIVES IN A WEB 
AND UH 
IT HAS EIGHT LEGS 
AND UH IT CAN MOVE ALL ABOUT THE WEB IN TWO DIMENSIONS 
UNLESS IT'S A THREE DIMENSIONAL WEB WHICH YOU THEY HAVE SOMETIMES 
THERE ARE SOME SPIDERS THAT LIVE IN LIKE THAT HAVE LIKE UH KIND OF A A BIG BALL OF A OF A WEB 
AND UH THE OTHER THING IS SOME SPIDERS CAN ACTUALLY UH FLY LIKE UH THEY HAVE UH THEY LET IT LIKE UH A STREAM OF LIKE THE WEB BUILDING MATERIAL BUT IT'S TOO CITIES LIKE A PARACHUTE SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY KIND OF GO AND FIND NEW UH BUILD A NEW WEB SOMEWHERE ELSE 
SO I THINK THEY DID THIS ONE UH IN CHARLOTTE'S WEB THAT MOVIE THAT LITTLE UH WELL IT'S ACTUALLY A BOOK FIRST BUT UH 
UM AT THE AND ALL THE THE SPIDERS KINDA FLEW AWAY 
SO THAT'S MY ANIMAL 
MAYBE IT'S HAPPY 'CAUSE IT JUST ATE SOMEONE 
SO YOU DON'T LIKE PINK PANTHERS 
SO SO THIS UH AN INDIAN OR AN AFRICAN ELEPHANT 'CAUSE YOU HAVEN'T DRAWN THE EARS 
OKAY 
WE CAN DISCUSS THAT OFF LINE 
SO COULD I JUST ASK ONE QUESTION UM 
SO THIS A STAND ALONE UNIT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING 
SO IT'S GONNA BE YOU ALREADY HAVE A T. V. BUT YOU'RE BUYING AN EXTRA REMOTE CONTROL FOR IT OR SOMETHING 
OKAY ALRIGHT 
OKAY WELL SO 
IT SEEMS THE THE FIRST THING THAT THEY'VE KINDA SPECIFIED IS THE PRICE LIKE BASED ON HOW MUCH PROFIT WE WANNA MAKE WHICH SEEMS TO 
A KIND OF A LITTLE STRANGE IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THE PRODUCT AS YET 
BUT I GUESS IF THAT'S IF THAT'S THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE NEED TO TO DESIGN THE THE PRODUCT TO ACTUALLY FIT THAT 
THAT PRICE BRACKET SO I GUESS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY YOU KNOW 
WHAT PEOPLE ARE ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR ME WHAT KIND OF PRODUCT THEY'RE EXPECTING FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO BECAUSE IT SEEMS QUITE A LOT FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IT'S 
YEAH 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY 
OH EVERYBODY IS NOT READY 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY LET'S GO 
SO WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TO HAVE OUR FIRST KICK OFF MEETING ABOUT UH THIS NEW PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE TO TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES 
UM SO I WILL BE UH SEBASTIAN THE PROJECT MANAGER 
UM YOU ARE THE 
OKAY 
OKAY VERY GOOD 
THANKS FOR BEING HERE 
UM SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE THE AGENDA 
SO 
WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS AGENDA UH AND MAINLY FIRST TO UH TO MAKE IT TO BE USED TO THE TOOLS UH AVAILABLE IN THIS NICE AND SMART MEETING ROOM WE HAVE HERE 
UM THEN WE'LL GO TO UH THE PLANS FOR PROJECT AND HAVE GENERAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IT 
SO THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS IT UH DEVELOPED A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
UM IT SHOULD BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND ALSO USER FRIENDLY 
AS USUAL WE WILL FOLLOW THE THE PROJECT METHOD UM THAT WE ARE USING IN THE IN OUR COMPANY 
IT IS ONE OTHER STEP IS YOU KNOW 
FIRST THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 
THE SECOND'S A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THEN THE DETAILED DESIGN 
DURING EACH STEP UH OF EACH DESIGN WE W YOU WILL WORK UH S SEPARATELY 
INDIVIDUALLY ON UH YOUR SPECIFIC TASKS AND WELL UM WE WILL MEET TO ME TO DISCUSS AND TAKE DECISIONS ABOUT UH WHAT YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU DID AND WHAT UH WE WILL DO NEXT 
SO FIRST 
WE HAVE TO TO TRAIN OURSELF WITH ALL THE UM THE TOOLS AVAILABLES IN THE ON THIS NICE MEETING ROOM AND UH PARTICULARLY THE THE WHITE BOARD SO UH WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE WHITE BOARD AND TAKE SOME UM SO SOME NOTES OR DO SOME DRAWINGS 
SO WHO WANT TO START 
MISTER 
YOU HAVE IN IN MIND 
OKAY 
TH THANK YOU 
VERY INTERESTING 
GUILLERMO YOU WANT IT 
IT WOULD BE VERY FUNNY FOR US 
OH 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
HEMANT 
POOR ELEPHANT 
YES 
WE HAVE TO I HAVE TO CATCH YOU SORRY 
WE HAVE TO TO GO THROUGH THE MEETING 
THANK YOU 
YEAH WE'LL DISCUSS A OF A FLY OR DO WE'LL DO ANOTHER MEETING ABO ON ELEPHANTS 
SO IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROJECT IS ABOUT MONEY UH AND BUT IS ABOUT FINANCES 
SO WE SHOULD TARGET SELLING PRICE OF TWENTY FIVE EURO FOR THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
AND UH WE HAVE UM WHICH WHICH WOULD GENERATE A PROFIT OF OF UM FIFTY MILLION EUROS OKAY 
AND WE SHOULD TARGET THE INTER AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET 
O THIS IS THE NEXT TOPIC WE HAVE TO DISCUSS EXACTLY SO LET'S GO TO IT 
SO UM WE SHOULD DECIDE WHICH KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL WE WANT TO UH WE WANT TO UH WE WANT TO GO 
SHOULD BE SHOULD SHOULD TO BE UM SPECIFIC REMOTE CONTROL TO SOME SPECIFIC DEVICE 
SHOULD TO BE A UNIVERSAL ONE 
AND UH ETCETERA 
SO UM SO I'M WAITING FOR YOUR FOR YOUR INPUTS VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY THREE THREE MINUTES TO GO 
OKAY 
OKAY I THINK THIS IS MORE A JOB TO OUR MARKET PERSON YEAH 
SO IT SHOULD BE THE TOPIC OF MAYBE IF THE NEXT MEETING JUST TO TO HAVE AN OVERVIEW OF THIS AND UH IN WHICH DIRECTION WE SHOULD GO 
SO WE NEED TO CLOSE THE MEETING 
UH WE'LL HAVE A NEW MEETING SOON AND UH IS THE WORK VERY VERY IF YOU UH HAVE TO DO TO DO 
SO UM YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THE ON THE WORKING DESIGN 
YOU HAVE TO UH WORK ON THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS AND UH YOU HAVE TO WORK ON US USER REQUIREMENTS SPECS ALRIGHT 
UM YOU WILL RECEIVE SOME INFORMATION BY EMAILS I AS USUAL 
THANKS FOR COMING TODAY 
THANKS 
GOOD MORNING 
AND I AM HEMANT THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DRAW A PANTHER 
SO BAD I DON'T LIKE IT 
UM USER 
OH YEAH 
THANKS 
THIS LAPEL IS COMING OUT ONCE IN A WHILE 
IT'S NOT VERY STRONG 
OKAY 
IS NOT THE FAVOURITE ANIMAL BUT I THINK I'LL DRAW ELEPHANT 
I'LL TRY TO DRAW ELEPHANT 
IT'S A PROBLEM 
OKAY THANKS 
OKAY SO ELEPHANT GOES LIKE THIS 
AND THEN IT HAS 
FOUR FEET 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S ANY DIST THERE SHOULD BE ANY DISTANCE OR NOT BUT 
I THINK THIS IS THE EASIEST 
AND THEN WE HAVE IT'S TRUNK 
AND 
YEP SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
AN EYE CUTE 
YEAH SO 
AND SOMETIMES THEY HAVE A HUMP 
IT SEEMS THAT UH ELEPHANTS ARE PRETTY FRIENDLY AND THEY THEY HAVE ONE VERY IMPORTANT WAY A DIFFERENT WAY OF WALKING 
SO WHEN THEY WALK WHEREVER THEY ARE GOING TO PUT THEIR FIRST FEET THE SECOND FEET WILL ALWAYS BE 
WHEN THEY'LL COME TO THAT POSITION THE SECOND THE THIRD FEET WILL BE THERE 
THAT'S THE WAY THEY WALK 
AND THAT'S VERY PECULIAR ABOUT THEM 
NONE OF THE OTHER ANIMALS WALK LIKE THIS 
AND THEY ARE VERY USEFUL TO HUMAN BEINGS 
AT LEAST FEW FEW HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS ONE MEANS OF TRANSPORTATIONS OR SOMETHING 
OR WHEN THEY HAD TO CARRY HUGE UM LOADS FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER ELEPHANTS WERE VERY USEFUL 
AND THEY ARE FOUND IN UM USUALLY THE WARM COUNTRIES 
AND UM THEY ARE THE BIGGEST TERRESTRIAL ANIMAL 
THAT'S WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THEM 
SO THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO TELL ABOUT ELEPHANTS 
THERE ARE TWO KIND OF UH YEAH THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT INDIAN AND AFRICAN ELEPHANTS 
SO INDIAN ELEPHANT IS HAVING ONE BUMP I THINK AND THE AFRICAN HAVE TWO 
AND THEN THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE TRUNK OF THE ANIMALS THESE ELEPHANTS WHO ARE INDIAN AND 
SO AT SOME FOR SOME ELEPHANTS IT'S THE TRUNK IS HAVING ONE 
DO WE HAVE SOME MESSAGE THERE 
WIND UP 
OKAY SOME OTHER TEAM 
THANK YOU 
THANKS 
MARKETING PERSON 
MM-HMM 
THANKS 
UH I'M GUILLERMO 
I'M THE MARKETING EXPERT 
'KAY 
I DUNNO WHY BUT WHEN I WAS A CHILD I I WANTED TO BE A A PANTHER NOT A PINK PANTHER OR MAYBE YES 
OH YEAH YEAH 
OKAY IT'S A FRIENDLY PANTHER 
YEAH MAYBE 
UM 
ACTUALLY HONESTLY I I I DUNNO WHAT'S WHAT'S HIS IT'S BE BEHAVIOUR I DUNNO IF IF IT'S THE MALE WHO WHO HUNTS OR IT'S THE FEMALE UH 
I I I HAVE WATCHED THAT LIONS DI DIDN'T HUNT IT'S THE THE FEMALE LIONS WHO WHO HUNT SO BUT 
I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S FAST AND IT'S BLACK AS WELL SO IT CAN 
UH IT CAN HIDE ITSELF VERY EASILY AND IT'S IT'S IT LOOKS LIKE UM POWERFUL STRONG UH I DUNNO 
I I WATCH A A FILM ABOUT A BLACK PANTHER WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND I WAS IN THAT AGE WHEN EVERYTHING WAS SHOCKING ME A LOT 
OKAY 
I LIKE IT 
YEAH 
YEP 
YES 
MM 
UH THE POWERSTICK 
MAYBE A SPANISH NAME WOULD WORK WELL 
ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE SELLING INTO THE U. S. MARKET BECASUE THERE'S A LOT OF SPANISH SPEAKERS THERE 
MAYBE SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS COOL IN ENGLISH BUT SOUNDS FUNNY IN SPANISH 
MANDO 
WHAT IS THAT 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN SPANISH 
CONTROL 
OKAY 
'CAUSE IT ALSO LIKE AN ENGLISH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU KNOW THE MAN'S TOOL YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW MEN LIKE TO HAVE CONTROL OF THE REMOTE IS IT MIGHT 
THE MANDO 
YEAH THAT'S 
AND WE COULD HAVE SOME LIKE YOU DO YOU COULD HAVE THE FONTS YOU KNOW SPECIAL 
SO YOU HAVE MENU ON LIKE IN IN UH NO NO O ONE ONE FONT AND THEN THE A. IS LIKE 
ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T WANNA CUT UH CUT WOMEN OUT OF THE UH POTENTIAL BUYERS THOUGH DO YOU 
SO 
YEAH 
MARKETING 
WELL THAT'S THE THING 
WE NEED TO KNOW WHO WE'RE SELLING IT IT BEFORE WE CAN REALLY DECIDE ON A 
UM 
YEAH 
MORE LIKELY 
WELL THE THE ON THE THING IS THOUGH MOST REMOTE CONTROLS ARE USED BY MORE THAN ONE PERSON 
SO 
UNLESS YOU'RE KIND OF TARGETING SINGLE PEOPLE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA MAYBE 
CUT OUT SOME A LOT OF YOUR MARKET 
STILL SHAPED FOR YEAH FOR YOUR HAND BUT NOT FOR A PARTICULAR HAND RIGHT 
WELL IT CAN STILL BE A YOU CAN STILL EXTEND PAST THE HAND 
OH 
WELL IT MEANS LIKE 
THIS REMOTE HERE IS KIND OF IS VERY THIN AND LONG AS INSTEAD OF HAVING YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE TO KIND OF A BIT BIGGER OR 
YOU KNOW WITH MAYBE SOME SOME FINGER MOLDS OR SOMETHING 
SOME FINGER GRIPS MAYBE 
YOU COULD EVEN HAVE SOME BUTTONS LIKE YOU KNOW IN THE SIDES AND EVERYTHING BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
I WAS STILL UH I WAS STILL WORKING ON THIS UH TWENTY FIVE EURO PRICE POINT BECAUSE I THINK ACTUALLY HAVING LOOKED AT SOME OF THE REMOTES OUT THERE 
THIS IS QUITE A LOW UH PRICE IF IF WE'RE MAYBE I CAN GET TO THIS IN MY PRESENTATION THOUGH BUT UM YEAH 
YEP 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I THINK EVEN EVEN IF IT WAS WITHIN BUDGET DO A SPEECH RECO REC SYSTEM IT MIGHT BE A BIT DIFFICULT BECAUSE IF YOU THINK IF YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF THIS UH BACKGROUND NOISE FROM THE T. V. WHICH MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THE 
UH PARTICIPANT THREE 
YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME BACKGROUND NOISE FROM THE T. V. WHICH WILL MAKE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION MUCH UH HARDER SO 
UH YOU PRESS A PRESS A BUTTON TO TALK AND THE THE T. V. THE T. V. SOUND TURNS OFF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
OKAY SO COULD I DESCRIBE THE MOUSE MAYBE BE SURE IT COULD I SEE THE MOUSE OR 
MM 
THANKS 
OKAY 
GREAT 
OKAY SO UM WHILE UH RESEARCHING THIS THIS TOPIC I FIRST OF ALL JUST THOUGHT OF A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE IT IS IN A REMOTE 
AND JUST UH LOOKED AT SO IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE IN ANY CURRENT REMOTES 
AND THEN ALSO SEARCHED FOR WHICH ARE THE TOP RATED UH REMOTE CONTROLS ON EPINIONS DOT COM 
WHICH IS A A YOU KNOW A A CUSTOMER UM WRITTEN BASICALLY REVIEW SITE 
SO UM THERE'S A PRETTY WIDE RANGE OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS THESE DAYS AND AND UH THIS REMOTE CONTROL IN THE RIGHT HERE IS IS ONE OF THE MORE EXTRAVAGANT 
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY IT'S BY ONE MINUS UH 
MM YOU KNOW NO IT'S OWN ONE BEING SO EXPENSIVE 
THERE ARE A LOT OF EXPENSIVE REMOTE CONTROLS OUT THERE 
SO YEAH IT DOE IT'S WELL BASICALLY ALL THE FUNCTIONS UH ARE CONTROLLED THROUGH THROUGH THE L. C. D. SCREEN EXCEPT FOR THE REALLY REALLY KIND OF MAIN FUNCTIONS 
WHICH HAVE A COUPLE OF OF THEIR OWN BUTTONS 
UM AND IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE UNIVERSAL REMOTES TO UM IN THE MARKET I KNOW WE'RE WORKING ON TELEVISION REMOTE 
BUT A LOT OF THE UNIVERSAL REMOTES OUT THERE HAVE UH HAVE THIS L. C. D. SCREENS WHICH KIND OF HELPS WHEN YOU'RE USING MULTIPLE UH DEVICES I SUPPOSE BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE KIND OF FUNCTIONS DO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ON THE SCREEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES 
BUT UM THE THING THAT I FIND MOST INTERESTING BUT THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
AND IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO UH IT IS IN THE SLIDE BUT IT HAS A SCROLL WHEEL ON IT 
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE UH A MOUSE SCROLL WHEEL WHICH I THINK SO IT'S A REALLY KIND OF IMPORTANT DESIGN ASPECT UM SO IT'S 
'CAUSE THE THING IS WHAT A WHAT WE THE PERSON THIS PRESENTATION WE HAD SO WHAT WE WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO ACTUALLY DO 
AND OBVIOUSLY THE THE SIMPLEST THING THAT A REMOTE CONTROL DOES IS IT JUST CHANGE THE CHANGE THE CHANNEL 
NOW UM 
UH TH I THINK THAT A SCROLL WHEEL IS ACTUALLY PRETTY A PRETTY HANDY WAY OF OF CHANGING THE CHANNEL 
'CAUSE I KNOW WHEN I UM WHEN I SEE THE REMOTE TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL I VERY RARELY USE THE NUMBERS ON THE ON THE IPOD 
I USUALLY USE THE UP AND DOWN BECAUSE MOST CHANNELS ARE YOU KNOW TWO DIGIT NUMBERS AND YOU HAVE TO PRESS YOU KNOW A SPECIAL BUTTON TO ENTER A TWO DIGIT NUMBER 
AND THEN TWO NUMBERS SO THAT'S JUST UH IT'S ANNOYING 
SO I THINK A SCROLL WHEEL IS IS QUITE HANDY 
NOW UM THE THE SCROLL WHEEL AS AS MUCH MORE USEFUL IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
AND THIS BRINGS US TO THE THE POINT YOU WERE MENTIONING BEFORE ABOUT THE INTERNET UH CAPABILITY 
ONE POSSIBILITY 
IF WE NOW WE NEED TO STILL TALK ABOUT THE PRICE POINT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THIS STUFF CAN'T BE DONE FOR TWENTY FIVE EU UH OR BUT 
ONE POSSIBILITY IS TO DOWNLOAD PROGRAM INFORMATION INTO THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS THAT INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY SAYING I WANT TO I WANT TO GO TO CHANNEL THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE I KNOW THIS PROGRAMME'S ON 
YOU KNOW OFTEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT EACH WHAT CHANNEL IT'S ONE OR YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S ON 
IF YOU HAVE A LIST OF OF PROGRAMS ON YOUR L. C. D. SCREEN YOU JUST SCROLL IT THAT PROGRAM RATHER THAN IT A CHANNEL 
SO IF YOU THINK BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A YOU KNOW IN MOBILE PHONES NOW YOU DON'T SEE YOU DON'T REMEMBER PEOPLE'S PHONE NUMBER 
YOU REMEMBER THEIR NAME AND YOU GO FIND THAT NAME AND RING IT 
SO THIS WOULD BE PRETTY KIND OF A HANDY THING TO HAVE ABOUT UM WE WE REALLY NEED TO TO DISCUSS THE PRICE 
SO I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE UH CHEAPER THIS IS ANOTHER MULTI KINDA PURPOSE REMOTE CONTROL WHERE IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY SIMPLE 
THERE'S ONLY A FEW BUTTONS BUT AL EACH OF THESE BUTTONS DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT 
SO THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE WE MIGHT WANNA CONSIDER IS REALLY KIND OF LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS 
BECAUSE THIS IS THE TOP RATING UH UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL ON ON EPINIONS 
IT IT'S REALLY UH MAYBE WORTH THINKING ABOUT LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS AS MUCH AS AS POSSIBLE UM BECAUSE REALLY I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIND THE BUTTON THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND WAS SAYING BEFORE ABOUT HAVING DIFFERENT SIZE BUTTONS FOR DIFFERENT YOU KNOW FREQUENTLY USED UH TASKS 
BUT I THINK ALSO YOU KNOW THE LOCATION AND AND SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS AS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS 
SO IF YOU HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS TO TO IT INCREASES THE THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING THE ONE YOU WANT 
SO 
YEAH WELL WE WE 
YEAH WELL WE WILL HAVE A BIT OF A SIMPLER UH TASK IN THAT WE'RE ONLY DOING UH A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL 
UM I THINK MAYBE AN OPTION IS TO HAVE YOU KNOW A LITTLE FLIP OPEN UM DOOR THAT UH THAT YOU HAVE HIDDEN MOST OF THE TIME 
BUT CONTAINS THE EXTRA BUTTONS LIKE SAY THE NUMBER BUTTONS FOR INSTANCE 
UM 
I I WOULD IF I HAD MY PERFECT REMOTE CONTROL I'D PROBABLY JUST HAVE NO NUMBERS AT ALL IN IT BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST IN THE WAY 
THEY DON'T REALLY DO ANYTHING 
MAYBE YOU KNOW I ALTHOUGH I D ALSO FIND FLIP OPEN DOORS A BIT OF A PAIN BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY CAN BREAK OFF OR OR WHATEVER 
BUT MAYBE A DOOR THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN PERMANANTLY REMOVE OR PERMANANTLY HAVE ONE WOULD BE GOOD 
UM BUT I THINK DEFINITELY YOU NEED TO TO KEEP THE BUTTONS DOWN TO A MINIMUM 
BUT NOT NOT LET THAT KIND OF INTERFERE WITH THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OF THE DEVICE 
UM 
WELL I GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU MARKET IT 
IF YOU IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT ADVERTISEMENT SHOWING HOW HOW HOW EASY TO USE AND HOW YOU CAN 
YOU KNOW NAVIGATE IT A PROGRAM WITHOUT THE NUMBERS THEN PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT LOOKS PRETTY EASY 
SO BUT YEP 
UM OKAY SO 
I THINK UM ONE OF THE REALLY KIND OF USEFUL THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH WITH INTERNET CONNECTIVITY WOULD BE TO HAVE THIS A PROGRAMME DRIVEN INTERFACE RATHER THAN THE CHANNEL NUMBER 
SO IF WE CAN HAVE A HIGHER PRICED UH REMOTE CONTROL I THINK THAT WOULD REALLY BE WORTH UH SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE WORTH IMPLEMENTING 
UM MM THERE'S THE L. C. D. SCREEN UM WHICH MAYBE MAYBE IS TOO EXPENSIVE UM BUT I THINK ALSO AT THE SCROLL WHEEL 
I HAVEN'T MENTIONED IT HERE THE SCROLL WHEEL COULD BE USED WITHOUT AN L. C. D. SCREEN JUST FOR CHANGING CHANNEL NUMBERS EASILY 
I THINK EVEN THAT I MEAN THAT WOULD BE A FAIRLY CHEAP THING COMPARED TO AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
TO IMPLEMENT UM BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE QUITE USEFUL AS WELL 
AND THE OTHER THING YOU SAY WE NEED TO WE NEED TO KEEP IT JUST TELEVISION 
BUT I THINK ONE MAYBE AN OPTION SINCE THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A KIND OF A FASHIONABLE DEVICE 
SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A CERTAIN KIND OF COOL OR WOW FACTOR THAT YOU CAN KIND OF YOU CAN HAVE WITH TECHNOLOGY 
AND MAYBE WE WANNA MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT'S EXTENSIBLE TO DO OTHER TASKS 
SAY YOU HAVE LIKE UM A LITTLE ANOTHER LITTLE KIND OF BASE UNIT THAT CAN ALSO RECEIVE SIGNALS AS WELL AS THE TELEVISION WHERE YOU CAN 
SAY UH CHANGE THE LIGHTING IN THE ROOM 
YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING MAYBE YOU COULD SELL AS AN EXTRA IS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PART OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT 
BUT YOU KNOW LATER ON YOU COULD YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU ALSO SELLING THE POTENTIAL OF THE DEVICE 
THEN YOU SAY POTENTIALLY YOU CAN THEN DO OTHER COOL STUFF LIKE CHANGE THE LIGHTS 
I DUNNO CLOSE THE WINDOWS WHATEVER TURN THE HEATING ON AND UM 
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE MAY NEED TO HAVE SO SO AT LEAST AS AN OPTIONAL EXTRA IT IT KINDA MAKE OUR PRODUCT COOL 
SINCE WE SAY WE'RE PUTTING THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
HMM 
WELL NO NO OTHER THING THAT THAT SPEECH RECOGNITION COULD REALLY BLOW OUT THE PRICE FOR US UH WHEN YOU WANT TO SELL INTO OTHER MARKETS 
THOUGH BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE GONNA SELL THIS BUT I PRESUME IT'S NOT GONNA JUST BE ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES 
SO THEN YOU HAVE TO SEE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TRAIN MODELS FOR 
YEAH 
YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU COULD ACTUALLY TRAIN THE REMOTE CONTROL SO YOU'RE USING IT BY SAYING YOU KNOW TURN VOLUME UP 
AND YOU PRESS THE UH PRESS THE BUTTON LIKE UH SO PEOPLE TEACH SIGN LANGUAGE TO KIDS F WELL BY SPEAKING AND DOING 
YEAH 
ACTUALLY I'M NOT SO SURE BECAUSE I'M THE YOU KNOW IF I WAS USING A REMOTE CONTROL TO SAY 
TURN THE VOLUME UP BECAUSE I CAN'T HEAR IT VERY WELL 
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO YOU KNOW DROWN OUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING BY TALKING YOU KNOW WHEN I'M WHEN I'M INSTEAD OF PRESSING UP IN IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
YOU KNOW IF THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME DIALOGUE ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT I CAN'T HERE 
I'M TRYING TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT WHAT'S BEING USED SO MAYBE SPEECH RECOGNITION GETS IN THE WAY MORE THAN IT HELPS 
WELL IT DEPENDS IF IT'S A REMOTE CONTROL THE 
MAYBE IF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS SOMETHING THAT YOU YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO PICK UP ANYMORE THAT WOULD BE A A USEFUL FEATURE OF THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
IF YOU CAN LEAVE IT SITTING ON THE TABLE AND YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO FIND IT THEN THAT COULD BE 
WELL IT DEPENDS THOUGH WELL IT DEPENDS 
IF WE WE DON'T UNLESS WE HAVE SOME INPUT SOME VIDEO INPUT TO THE T. V. OR WE HAVE CONTROL OVER THE T. V. THEN WE CAN'T ACTUALLY DISPLAY THAT 
LIKE IF WE IF WE PRODUCE THE T. V. S THEN THEN YEAH WE CAN PUT YOU KNOW MENUS UP UP THERE 
BUT OTHERWISE WE NEED TO ACTUALLY HAVE SOME KIND OF SOMETHING SITTING IN BETWEEN THE VIDEO SIGNAL AND THE AND THE T. V. TO SUPERIMPOSE THOSE THOSE MENUS 
SO THAT'S AN EXTRA 
COST 
WELL THIS IS THIS IS ANOTHER QUE WE STILL HAVEN'T REALLY DEFINED THE REMOTE 
ARE WE STILL YOU SAY WE'RE FOCUSING ON T. V. BUT IS IT STILL A KIND OF LIKE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE IN THAT IT'S A REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROL 
OR IS THIS SOMETHING FOR OUR OWN LINE OF OF TELEVISIONS 
'CAUSE THAT REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE 
'CAUSE EVEN IF WE HAVE CONTACTS WE CAN'T REALLY PRODUCE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT CAN BRING UP MENUS ON OTHER OTHER COMPANIES' T. V. S 
IT'S JUST THERE ARE TOO MANY T. V. S OUT THERE 
IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY GONNA 
FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO 
I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
BUT BUT I DUNNO 
I THINK UM IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY LEVERAGE IN THAT ANY LEEWAY IN THAT UM THAT TWENTY FIVE EURO BECAUSE FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO I THINK ALL WE CAN REALLY DO IS PROVIDE A VERY BASIC REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE KIND OF AGAINST THE PHILOSOPHY OF OUR COMPANY WHICH IS YOU KNOW PUTTING THE FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS 
SO I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE OF OF INCREASING THE UH 
OF INCREASING THE UNIT PRICE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE YEAH 
WELL THE 
'CAUSE YOU CAN HAVE THINGS LIKE THE PROGRAMME NAME INSTEAD OF THE CHANNEL NUMBERS LIKE AN INTERACTIVE PROGRAMME GUIDE 
YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE INFORMATION ON IT 
SO YOU COULD HAVE THE NAME OF THE PROGRAMME YOU COULD HAVE UM THE START TIME YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S UP TO 
YOU COULD HAVE A L EVEN A LITTLE IMAGE IF YOU KNOW THE C YOU KNOW THE THE UM THE MAIN ACTORS OR SOMETHING SO YOU CAN QUICKLY JUST KIND OF EVEN WITHOUT READING 
WELL NO BUT THERE ARE THE ELECTRONIC PROGRAMME GUIDES OUT THERE 
THEY MAY NOT HAVE PICTURES BUT MAYBE THEY DO 
THERE'S DEPENDI IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE COUNTRY 
NO BUT I MEAN WITH THE INTERNET YOU HAVE FLEXIBILITY OF WHERE YOU GET YOUR INFORMATION FROM 
SO IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE PROVIDING THAT 
OH 
WELL I I THINK IF WE'RE GONNA I THINK WE WOULD DEFINITELY NEED THE INTERNET CONNECTION BECAUSE EVEN WITH YOU I DON'T THINK YOU COULD EVEN GET TELETEXT INFORMATION FROM THE T. V. ONTO THE REMOTE CONTROL 
ESPECIALLY IF WE DON'T CONTROL THE T. V. 
I DUNNO 
WE NEED TO FIND THAT IT 
MM 
IF IT'S A REALLY SMALL T. V. MAYBE 
WELL THE THING SO I THINK I THINK THE TYPE OF PEOP 
I THINK THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA WANT TO BUY A VERY STYLISH REM R REMOTE CONTROL WITH LOTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE THE KINDA PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA HAVE YOU KNOW A WIRELESS INTERNET CONNECTION MAYBE 
OR A YOU KNOW 
WELL THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO FIND OUT 
CAN WE CAN WE INCREASE THE THE PRICE POINT OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
'CAUSE OTHERWISE WE NEED 
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO GUARANTEE THAT YOU'RE GONNA 
NINETY FIVE PERCENT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH THOUGH 
YEP 
OKAY EVERYBODY IS READY 
GOOD MORNING AGAIN 
SO TODAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A F SECOND MEETING 
OH MICHAEL HI 
YOU'RE LATE

UM SO FIRST BEFORE STARTING I WE JUST GOING TO UH TO GO QUICKLY TO THROUGH THE MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING 
SO UH BASICALLY WE WE ARE NOT DECIDED IF WE WE SHOULD GO FOR A UNIVERSAL OR SPECIFIC UH UH REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT I HAVE NOW UM NOW I INPUTS FOR ABOUT THAT TOPICS 
I GOIN I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU 
AND UH BASICALLY WE DECIDED TO ME TO UH GO TO INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS FOR EACH OF YOU UH SO UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SHOULD WOR WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK ON THE ON THE ON THE WORKING DESIGN

OKAY I DUNNO IF YOU HAD THIS INFORMATION ALREADY 
NO SO THEY WANT US TO RESTRICT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO T. V. ONLY BECAUSE OF TIME LIMITATIONS 
UM THEY WANT ALSO UH 
EXCELLENT 
SO WE HAVE ALSO TO FOCUS MORE ON THE INTERNET ASPECTS BECAUSE WELL WELL TE TELETEXT IS OUTDATED NOW 
AND UH FINALLY IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT THE CORPORATE IMAGE 
THAT MEANS COLOURS AND LOGOS OF THE CO OUR COMPANY SHOULD BE CLEARLY INDE IDENTIFIED IN THE PRODUCT 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
SURE SURE 
SO MAYBE WE CAN JUMP TO YOUR PRESENTATIONS RIGHT NOW 
OKAY SO LET'S KEEP IN MIND ABOUT THE THAT THAT THIS LAST POINT ABOUT L. C. D. AND SPEECH UH REC 
SORRY WHAT IS YOUR 
OKAY MICHAEL 
SORRY 
UM YEAH 
THE WHOLE DOESN'T WORK 
LOOKS LIKE A P. D. A. 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY CAN YOU CONTINUE PLEASE UM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY THANKS 
YOU WANT TO GO 
THIS ONE 
GREAT 
NO NOT THAT ONE 
YOU ARE TWO 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE THAT THERE IS A NEW WAY OF INTERACTING THAT IS WHILE 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THAT INCREASES THE THE COST ALSO 
DO YOU THINK THAT PERFORMANCE OF SUCH SYSTEMS ARE ENOUGH TO TO TARGET WELL OF SUCH TECHNOLOGIES IS ENOUGH 
OKAY 
WELL WHO UH I IMAGINE ALSO THAT THE MICROPHONE WILL BE AN AMBIANCE UM A UM AN AMBIENCE MICROPHONES BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SPEAK INTO INTO THE INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IT COULD BE AS A FEW CENTIMETRES 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY WE SH WE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS LA LATER AFTER AFTER AFTER THIS THIS UH SLIDE 
THIS IS A THIS IS A THIS IS A A VERY IMPORTANT UH ISSUE IN DISCUSSION 
OKAY NEXT 
UH THAT FINISHED 
NO 
COMPONENTS 
YES SURE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO YOUR 
YOUR OPINION IS THAT WE SHOULD GO FOR SPECIAL CONDITION TECHNOLOGIES 
YEAH 
OKAY SO 
OKAY GENTLEMENS WE HAVE TO TAKE SOME DECI DECISIONS RIGHT NOW 
UM SO IF I IF I KIND OF SUMMARISE EVERYTHING WE'VE DO WE WE SAID 
WE ARE TARGETING T. V. 
WE NEED WE NEED TO HAVE UM UM REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS FANC FANCY 
WHICH IS UH WHICH IS EASY TO TO HAND NOT TOO SMALL NOT TOO BIG 
UM WE HAVE ARE GOOD SHAPE YES 
WE SHOULD BRING NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLES AND UH SO WE HAVE UH ALSO REQUIREMENTS TO TO USE UH TO TO PUSH THR TOWARD THE INTERNET 
MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN STICK TO IT 
AND UM ALSO 
A VERY INTERESTING THINGS I I I'VE SEEN IN IN IN THE ONE OF THE COMP O OUR COMPETITOR IS THIS WHOLE THAT WE CAN USE TO NAVIGATE 
SO SO MY FEELING IS THAT ARE REGARDING COSTS BUDGET WE HAVE NO NO NO TARGET PRICE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO GO AS TO GO TO L. C. D. 
AND ALSO TO GO TO AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES 
UH FIRST UM UM WHY NOT TO GO TO L. C. D. 
BECAUSE UM IN FACT SO WE ARE TARGETING UH T. V. IN FACT WE CAN USE T. V. SCREEN IS A SCREEN TO FEEDBACK TO TO GIVE SOME FEEDBACK INFORMATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE COULD HAVE 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
DON DON'T YOU UH DON'T WE HAVE CONTACTS WITH UH APPEAL ON T. V. OR OR WELL SYSTEMS THAT EXIST THAT WE CAN SEE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S GOOD POINT 
WHAT'S WHAT COU WHAT COULD BE THE COST OF UH WELL 
COULD WE FIT THE THE TARGETS UH IN TERMS OF COST UH IF WE GO AS TO L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
SO YOU MEAN YOU YOU MEAN WE WE SHOULD TARGET SOMETHING MAYBE WHICH IS WHICH WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT ARE REALLY FANCY IN TERMS TO UM IN TERMS TO HAD TO HAVE REALLY AN ADDED VALUE 
OKAY SO REGARDING THE AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION I THINK THIS IS 
THEY HAVE TELE TELETEXT 
WELL BECAUSE THEY HAVE TELETEXT ON IT 
THE THE YOU HAVE A TELETEXT SIN SIGNAL THAT YOU CAN THAT YOU CAN UH THAT YOU CAN GET THR THROUGH THE CHANNEL 
THEY HAVE TO MOST OF THEM HAVE TELETEXT 
BUT WE WANT TO GET RID WELL ONE OF OUR REQUIREMENTS IS IT UH TO MOVE OUT TELETEXT TO UH AT THE EASE OF INTERNET 
SO IT TO UH 
TO BROWSE MORE EASILY THE TELETEXT 
FOR INSTANCE THROUGH UH THROUGH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
THE AT THE START TIME ALL THE P ALL THE PROGRAMMES YOU COULD HAVE UH O 
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FROM TELETEXT ALSO 
WELL BECAUSE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT WE CANNOT 
UH INFORMATIONS ON THE T. V. 
WE C WE COULDN'T GRAB INFORMATION INFORMATION WHICH IS NOT THERE 
SO SO THAT MEAN WE WE WE NEED AN AN AN EXTRA INTERNET CONNECTION TO USE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IF YOU WANT TO BROWSE IN ADDITION TO THE T. V. OR UH OR IT SHOULD BE A SPECIAL T. V. CONNECTED TO 
OKAY 
WE NEED TO CLOSE THE MEETING 
UM SO 
VERY QUICKLY 
NO 
YEAH WELL PEOPLE GO TO BUY ANOTHER REMOTE CONTROL WHEN THEY BROKE N BROKE THEIR 
AND THEY WANT TO GO TO FOR UNIVERSAL ONE AND THEY TAKE THE FANCIEST THEY CAN HAVE 
SO THIS IS THAT WE Z THAT THAT WE SHOULD TARGET 
SO THE COM THE UM THE UH THE COMMITTMENT IS THE FOLLOWING WE DON'T GO FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY 
THE L. C. D. S STILL ON DISC IS STILL OPEN IT DISCUSSION 
IT IS UP TO YOU TO GO THROUGH THIS UM UH THIS WAY AND IT TO REPORT REPORT UM BACK NEXT MEETING 
SO 
YEAH BUT NOT SURE 
MAYBE IT'S CHEAPER BUT WE HAVE NO 
OKAY THIS IS THIS IS AN OPEN QUESTION FOR YOU 
YEAH 
THIS IS UH UP TO YOU TO TELL US 
BUT I'M DEFINITELY NOT KEEN ON IT IT NO NO NO I'M NO I'M DEFINIT DEFINITELY NOT KEEN ON GOING TO SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES 
I'M NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH 
I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT WE'LL HAVE A PRODUCT REALLY THAT WORK 
I UH THAT WORK 
IT'S REAL YEAH 
HOW TO GUARANTEE SUCH PERFORMANCES IS REALLY HARD 
WELL THIS IS STILL IS IS VERY BAD 
SO THIS IS THE END OF THIS DISCUSSION 
NEXT MEETING UH HERE ARE THE TASK YOU HAVE TO WORK ON 
UM SO YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THE COMPONENT UH CONCEPT 
UH YOU HAVE TO WORK ON USER INTERFACE AND YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A TREND WATCHING 
OKAY 
SO THE QUESTION IS STILL OPEN ABOUT THE L. C. D. THING 
UM UH W I HOPE THAT NEXT MEETING WE WILL UH WE'LL TAKE SOME UM DECISION THAT DIRECTION 
THANKS 
BYE 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH THEY ARE THE MOST T. V. WATCHER 
SO WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL 
YEP 
WELL MAYBE IT COULD BE A UNIVERSAL DESIGN 
A UNIVERSAL DESIGN WHICH IS WHICH IS GOOD FOR BOTH THE HANDS 
YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT WHETHER IT'S LEFT HAND OR RIGHT HAND BUT BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE TWO POINTS ARE CLASHING 
ONE THING YOU ARE SAYING DESIGN SHOULD FIT THE HAND SHAPE AND IT SHOULD NOT BE VERY SMALL 
THE FIRST AND THE THIRD POINT THEY ARE CLASHING 
OKAY 
SO FITTING THE HAND DOESN'T MEAN MUCH THEN 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
SO IT MEANS DESIGN SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE TRADITIONAL ONES 
LITTLE SLEEK LONGER 
AND IT SHOULD FIT THE HAND 
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM HM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
NO IT COULD BE COMMAND CONTROL KIND OF THING 
IT REQUIR RECOGNISES PARTICULAR SEQUENCE AND THEN IT GETS ACTIVATED 
MEANS YOU SAY YOU SHOULD SAY LIKE DOES THAT REMOTE CONTROL BEING ONE OR BE ONE KIND OF THING 
AND THEN REMOTE CONTROL COMES IN THE PICTURE FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
BECAUSE THIS KIND OF THING MEANS SPEECH IS THERE FROM THE T. V. ALSO 
SO THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING COMMAND CONTROLLED YOU START AND THEN YOU STOP 
IT'S LIKE V. I. EDITOR YOU ARE HAVING TWO MODES SIMILARLY 
OTHERWISE IT'S JUST LYING IDLE 
CHANGE THE CHANNELS 
YEAH 
MMM-HMM MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
BUT THERE IS NO PROBLEM THEN THE USER HAS TO UNDERSTAND EACH OF THAT FUNCTIONALITY 
BECAUSE THE SAME BUTTON IS DOING TOO MANY THINGS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
IT DOES SAMPLING OUT OF THE 
YEP 
SO YEAH 
SO MOST OF THE THINGS WHICH WE ARE DISCUSSING ABOUT IS SPEECH RECOGNITION UH THAT MEANS IN MY OWN I YEAH IT SHOULD BE 
TWO 
OKAY SO THE WORKING DESIGN IS UH SURE I INTERFACE COULD BE OF TWO TYPES 
ONE IS THE USUAL PRESS BUTTONS WHICH ARE THERE IS THAT THE USER FEELS THAT UH IS KNOING DOING SOME UH IS KNOWING ABOUT THAT TECHNOLOGY 
SO UH IS PRETTY COMFORTABLE IF HE WANTS TO GET THIS 
AND ON TOP OF THAT THERE THERE COULD BE A SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ALSO BEING SITTING ON THE ON THE REMOTE 
SO THE OLD KIND OF USERS WHO DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY CHANGES IT CAN 
IT CAN BE USEFUL FOR THEM AND THE NEW USERS USE UH OUR MARKETING EXPERT WAS SAYING 
THEY CAN USE THE NEW GIZMO WHICH IS SPEECH RECOGNITION KIND OF THING 
THAT'S RIGHT 
SO ANYWAY THAT DIDN'T COME INTO MY MIND IS THE THAT IS A POSSIBILITY 
THIS COULD BE OTHER KIND OF INTERFACES 
MEANS WE CAN HAVE DEPENDING ON THE COST HOW MUCH WE CAN AFFORD WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF INTERFACES 
SO SPE BUTTONS OR SOMETHING WHICH IS VERY EVERYBODY IS FAMILIAR WITH 
SO IF YOU GO TO THE MARKET AND YOU SAY THAT BUTTONS ARE THERE THE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IT IS 
AND ON TOP OF THAT IF WE ARE HAVING EXTRA FUNCTIONALITY PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO SHELL THAT TWENTY FIVE EUROS MONEY WHICH WE ARE THINKING 
OTHERWISE WE ARE JUST LIKE OTHERS IN THE MARKET 
SO ANYWAY THAT IS THE FIRST USER INTERFACE COULD BE OF MORE THAN ONE TYPE 
AND UH YEAH THAT MEANS WE CAN DO THE ON LINE CHANGES WHICH WHICH CANNOT BE DONE NOW ACTUALLY 
SO APART FROM THE SPEECH WE CAN HAVE THE SCROLL KIND OF THING WITH THE BUTTONS 
NOW FOR BUTTONS NORMAL REQUIREMENTS LIKE ABOUT CODING AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE REQUIRED 
AND FOR VOICE LIMITED VOCABULARY AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS REQUIRED AND WE REQUIRE A MICROPHONE ALSO TO BE SITTING THERE IN THE REMOTE 
OH THAT'S RIGHT 
BUT UH MEANS WE HAVE TO SEE HOW MUCH WHAT KIND OF MICROPHONES AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
OH YES IF IT IS LIMITED VOCABULARY USUALLY IT'S ENOUGH 
YEAH WE WE CAN UH TARGET MEANS WE CAN TARGET NINETY FIVE PERCENT ACCURACY OR SOMEWHERE NINETY SEVEN PERC 
THAT'S RIGHT 
NO IT IT COULD BE LITTLE D YEAH IT COULD BE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
UH IT'S MORE LIKE MENUS THERE ARE DIFFERENT SPEECH TECHNOLOGIES WHICH ARE EXISTING SO D. T. W. COULD BE KIND OF WHICH IS THE EASIEST 
SO YOU HAVE TO STORE SOME TEMPLATES ON THE ON THE 
IN THE CHIP ITSELF AND IT'S JUST DYNAMIC TIME WARPING WHERE YOU TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS 
INSTEAD OF HAVING A MODEL WHICH HAS TO BE TRAINED AND BEING A MICRO CONTROLLER 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
SO WE CAN 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YEP 
YEP 
NO NO 
COMPONENTS 
YEAH 
AS WELL YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE 
YEAH SO THIS IS THE DESIGN WHICH WE ARE THINKING IS 
WE ARE HAVING A POWER BUTTON AND THE SWITCH WHICH IS NOT MUCH 
AND THEN WE ARE HAVING THE WHICH IS TO INDICATE WHETHER THE POWER IS ONE OR NOT 
AND THEN THERE ARE TWO KIND OF THINGS WHICH CAN BE AS ONE IS THE BUTTON INTERFACE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN BECAUSE BECAUSE OF LACK OF TIME 
SO WE COULD NOT PUT THAT 
SO NOW WHERE THE U. S. R. DECODER IS SITTING SIMILARLY THERE ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF INTERFACES WHICH COULD BE THERE 
SO THERE IS A. S. R. DECODER WHICH COULD BE THERE AND THEN THERE COULD BE ANOTHER SCROLL BUTTON SCROLL SCROLLER 
AND THEN THERE COULD BE BUTTONS AND ALL OF THEM THEY WILL JUST DO THE DECODING AND PUT IT IN THE MATH PUT IT IN THE PROPER MESSAGE FORMAT 
AND THEN THERE IS THERE IS THE CHIP WHICH IS SITTING THE GREEN ONE AND IT CONVERTS IT INTO BIT CODES 
AND THAT BIT CODES ARE SENT BY THE INFRARED DEVICE TO THE RECEIVER 
SO THIS IS THE EASIEST DESIGN THE OTHER COULD BE 
SO THE AN A. S. R. DECODER WE CAN HAVE THINGS IN 
TO HAVE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES 
SO THIS WAS THE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE WAS THAT WE CAN HAVE A. S. R. SITTING THERE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT UH AS SOON AS YOU TRY TO PUT THE MICROCHIP KIND OF THING OR SOMETHING THE PRICE WILL GO UP 
SO THESE ARE THE SLIGHT PROBLEMS 
BECAUSE YEAH THE REASON IS THAT IF WE GO INTO THE MARKET MEANS THOUGH I DON'T HAVE MUCH DO BUT IS UH THE UH MARKETING EXPERT PRESENTATION WAS 
SO IF WE GO WITH JUST THE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
OR 
BUT JUST A SMALL THING WHAT KIND OF MARKET WE ARE TARGETING 
SO IT THAT WE ARE TARGETING THE REPLACEMENT REMOTE MARKET OR WHAT 
SO THE REMOTE HAS GONE BAD AND THE PERSON WANTS TO BUY A NEW REMOTE OR BECAUSE THE COST OF L. C. D. THING COULD BE SO HIGH IS THE T. V. ITSELF 
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
BREAK 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
IT'S IT'S CHEAPER AS COMPARED TO THE L. C. D. 
MEANS THE YEAH TWENTY FIVE EUROS SO YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
OKAY 
OH 
MM I WAS THINKING OF THE 
MANDO 
MANDO 
A. N. YEAH D. O 
IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T SOUND COOL FOR ME BUT MAYBE FOR A SPANISH FOR I FOR 
CONTROL 
BUT MM YEAH 
MANDO SOUNDS 
LATINO 
BUT YEAH IT UH 
YEAH BECAUSE OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE INTERNATIONAL 
MAYBE MAYBE I SHOULD UH START 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SHOULD BE IN PARTICIPANT FOUR 
YEAH YEAH 
OH 
OKAY SO YEAH I WILL I WILL GIVE A BRIEF OUTLINE ABOUT WHAT I WHAT I PREPARED FOR THIS MEETING 
FOR THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE 
FOR THE USER REQUIREMENTS 
I PREPARE A MARKETING REPORT AND WE HAVE TO FIND THE WEAKNESSES AND AND THE THE IMPROVEMENTS WE COULD DO IT THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND ALSO I D I DID A STUDY WITH FOR THE INCORPORATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IT SEEMS THAT THE REMOTE CONTROLS HAVE BEEN HAVE REMAINED THE SAME FOR THE LAST FIVE 
TEN YEARS 
THERE IS NO 
NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE THE B THE FIRST NEW CONTROLS AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL MORE MOST OF THE PEOPLE THINK THAT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE UGLY THOROUGHLY 
SO AND THEY THEY ADMIT THAT TH TH THEY SHOULD UH SO THEY WOULD UH SPEND MORE MONEY ON A FANCIER REMOTE CONTROL 
WHICH IS WHICH IS GOOD AND IT'S INTERESTING POINT 
ALSO THE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT ABOUT THE R. S. I. DISEASE WHICH IS IF YOU REPEAT THE USE THE SAME MOVEMENT 
WHICH IS NOT A WITH A NOT VERY APPROPRIATE DEVICE YOU YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS WHE WHEN YOU WILL GET OLD 
SO SO PEOPLE ARE UH ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE THE SHAPE OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
THEY ARE ALSO THEY GET ANGRY VERY OFTEN BECAUSE THEY LOST THE REMOTE CONTROL VERY OFTEN 
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD POINT TO TO L TO TO FIND A A SOLUTION TO ANY BEEP ANY ALARM OR SOMETHING INCORPORATED IT WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL EVERY TIME TO TO GET LOST 
AND ALSO I FOUND THAT YOUNG PEOPLE THE THE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE THE MORE INTERESTED THEY ARE IN INCORPORATING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IN MY OPINION THE 
MANDO THIS MANDO SHOULDN'T BE VERY SMALL BECAUSE THE SMALLER IT IS THE MORE LIKE THE THE LIKLIER IT IS TO GET LOST 
LIKLIER OR MORE LIKELY 
LIKELY 
OKAY 
UH PEOPLE ALSO COMPLAIN BECAUSE THEY THEY THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME SIZE OF THE BUTTONS FOR BUTTONS WHO W WHICH ARE NOT VERY IS LIKE IF UH MEMORISING CHANNELS OR OR THIS KIND OF ACTIONS WHICH ARE NOT VERY OFTEN BUT 
THEY THEY SHOULDN'T THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME IMPORTANCE IN THE ON THE UH IN THE REMOTE CONT IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
ALSO THE Z THE DESIGN SHOULD FIT THE HAND SHAPE 
SO IT MAY BE INTERESTING TO TO THINK IN A ON BOTH PROTOTYPES FOR RIGHT AND LEFT HANDED PEOPLE 
YEAH 
I DUNNO I TH ANYWAY I THINK IT COULD BE INT INTERESTING TO TO RELEASE SOME A A SMALL FRACTION OF OF THIS REMOTE CONTROLS 
SORRY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SORRY 
YEAH 
LIKE UH 
YEAH LIKE 
NO NO I WAS THINKING OF US LIKE SOMETHING YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
IT SH IT SHOULDN'T IT SHOULDN'T BE SYMMETRIC SYMMETRICAL 
NOT ANYMORE 
THAT'S WHAT YEAH 
AND FINALLY THE INCORPORATION OF A L. C. D. OR A SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM IN THE REMOTE CONTROL COULD ALSO BE INTERESTING BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE BUDGET 
WOULD BE LARGE ENOUGH 
BUT MOST OF YEAH MOST OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO THIRTY TO THIRTY YEARS OLD WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY 
ACTUALLY THIS MARKETING REPORT IS RESTRICTED TO T. V. REMOTE CONTROLS 
YEAH BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACTIVATE OR DISACTIVATE SO YEAH YEAH 
YEAH UH CHANNEL FIFTY 
YEAH 
UH I THINK I THINK THAT THE TR THE TRANSITION TO THIS AT THIS NEW REMOTE CONTROL SHOULDN'T BE VERY VERY ABRUPT VERY HARD BECAUSE WE IF PEOPLE USE A ROOM IS THE USE A REMOTE CONTROL WITHOUT NUMBERS MM THEY WILL THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO LEARN VERY DIFFICULT TO VERY DIFFERENT BUILD VERY DIFFERENT AT THE TRADITIONAL 
IF YOU 
I'M SURE IF YOU CAN SELL A A SPEECH RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS EVERYO EVERYONE WELL SO WILL BUY IT 
I'M SURE 
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW THE THE AVERAGE FREQUENCY OF PUSHING BUTTONS IT'S ABOUT 
IT'S ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHTY EIGHTY PUSHES PER HOUR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WITH A GOOD SHAPE FOR THE 
YEAH 
OH 
WHAT WOULD BE 
WHO ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE ONE QUESTION WHAT WOULD BE THE GOAL OF PUTTING AN L. C. D. IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
WHAT WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION 
YEAH BUT UM MOST OF THE T. V. S NOWADAYS SHOW THE SHOW THE 
THE ONE 
YEAH BUT YEAH MOST OF THE T. V. S HAVE TELETEXT NOWADAYS 
YEAH 
SO WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD APPEAR IN THE ON THE L. C. D. 
OKAY 
BUT 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE CHEAPER THE THEN THE L. C. D. 
BECAUSE WITH THE L. C. D. YOU NEED MORE REQUIREMENTS 
YOU NEED A INTERNET CONNECTION 
YOU NEED M MORE THINGS 
BUT 
FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION YOU YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING 
YOU JUST SAY CHANNEL FIFTY AND THAT'S IT 
BUT THEN WE SHOULD MOVE TO ANOTHER TARGET B BECAUSE AT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IT'S 
TO MOVE TO ANOTHER TARGET 
THE EXPERT HE SAID NINETY FIVE PERCENT 
OH 
OH YES I HAD SOMETHING SIMILAR 
BUT NON VEGETARIAN 
YEAH 
WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY FRUIT AND VEGETABLES AND SPONGY 
WHAT YOU MEAN CLOTHE 
NO I MISSED THAT ONE 
UH THEY'RE OKAY SO THEY'RE NOT LIKE DRESSED AS A CARROT THEY JUST HAVE LIKE PICTURES OF FRUIT ON OKAY 
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL IN THE SHAPE OF OF A BANANA JUST MAYBE 
OKAY AND 
SO WHICH FRUIT OR YOU THINKING OF 
UH SO YOU WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO BE THE SHAPE OF A FRUIT OR YOU WANT JUST SOME KIND OF LIKE FRUIT LOGO ON THE 
SO SOMETHING THAT LOOKS HALF LIKE A FRUIT AND HALF LIKE AN ELEPHANT 
BUT OKAY I'M NOT I'M NOT REALLY SURE 
IF UH THAT WOULD REALLY APPEAL TO EVERYONE THOUGH MAYBE JUST TO FASHION GURUS 
LIKE MAYBE JUST LIKE A LITTLE BIT ON A LITTLE FRUIT PICTURE SOMEWHERE IN THE CORNER 
BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT UH I DUNNO HOW ERGONOMIC A AN ORANGE IS 
IT FRUIT 
BUT IS IT UH IS FRUIT COOL 
SO FRUIT COOL 
WELL I GUESS YOU KNOW APPLE HAS THE IPOD SO IMAGI JUST 'CAUSE THEY HAVE AN APPLE ON THERE 
IN THEIR PRODUCT DOESN'T MEAN FRUIT IS COOL 
OKAY BUT IT HAS TO BE EASY TO UH IT IS THOUGH AND TO HOLD YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANNA PEAR OR A WATERMELON 
WELL PROBABLY THE ONLY THING IS A BANANA THAT I CAN THINK OF A CUCUMBER 
I DUNNO 
MAYBE 
IT GREEN 
SO BUT I MEAN YOU ALSO HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO ALSO HAVE FIT ARE ALL THE BUTTONS AND YOU KNOW 
IT'S TOO 
THE THING SO YOU HAVE TO NORMALLY WITH UM WITH BUTTONS 
THEY HAVE TO BE AT SOME POINT ATTACHED TO A CIRCUIT BOARD SO IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THINGS LIKE IN A CYLINDRICAL KIND OF DEVICE IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO KIND OF TO BUILD 
YEAH 
WELL THIS IS 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEP 
OKAY 
SO 
SO NEXT UH SLIDE 
OKAY 
SO I RECEIVED AN EMAIL ME AROUND LUNCHTIME LETTING ME KNOW THAT THE BRILLIANT MINDS AT OUR TECHNOLOGY DIVISION HAD DEVELOPED AN INTEGRATED PROGRAMMABLE SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER UNIT 
UM WHICH IS A WAY FOR YOU TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOUR COFFEE MACHINE AND OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S ON WHAT IT SO IT'S IT'S VERY 
IT HAS A HAS A MICROPHONE HAS A SPEAKER IT'S GOT A LITTLE CHIP AND IT ALLOWS YOU IT 
WELL IT'S A SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER 
SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER 
IT MEANS THAT IT CAN RECOGNIZE 
IT CAN DO LIKE A MATCH ON A IN A CERTAIN PHRASE THAT YOU SPEAK AND THEN CAN PLAY BACK A PHRASE IN RESPONSE TO THAT 
BUT UH THERE'S ONE KIND OF UM UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHRASE 
SO I MEAN YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU COULD BUILD THAT ONE 
YOU COULD YOU COULD LINK THE THE RECOGNITION OF A CERTAIN PHRASE TO SOME FUNCTION IN IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT BASICALLY THE THING SO WE HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE 
IN HOUSE 
SO 
UM BUT THE THING IS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S STILL GONNA BE A COST OF YOU DECIDED TO INTEGRATE THAT BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE C PRODUCTION OF THE COMPONENTS 
SO UM IT IT BUT IT BASICALLY MEANS WE C WE CAN KIND OF CONSIDER THIS FROM UH YOU KNOW UH A THEORETICAL OR USABILITY KIND OF VIEWPOINT WITHOUT WORRYING TOO MUCH BUT YOU KNOW HOW TO DEVELOP TOO BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS ALREADY DONE 
WHILST YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT GET ANNOYED IF WE UH IF WE JUST DUMP IT 
IT'S IT IT'S ON WELL IT'S IT'LL RECOGNIZE UH I GUESS KEYWORDS BUT YOU KNOW KEYWORDS IN A CERTAIN ORDER LIKE A PHRASE 
YOU TURN IT FOR A CERTAIN UH FOR A CERTAIN PHRASE 
YOU SAY THE THE EXAMPLE THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE UH UP AND RUNNING WITH THEIR PROTOTYPE SO UM WELL THEY'VE ACTUALLY INTEGRATED INTO THE INTO THE THE COFFEE MACHINE THAT UH THAT WE'RE PRODUCING IS 
YOU CAN SAY GOOD MORNING TO THE COFFEE MACHINE AND IT CAN RECOGNIZE THAT PHRASE AND IT'LL PLAYBACK GOOD MORNING HOW WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR COFFEE 
YEAH 
SO ACTUALLY THAT WAS A BAD EXAMPLE 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY ASK HOW DO YOU WANT YOUR COFFEE BECAUSE IT CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSE SO 
ONLY LIKE ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT IT IT CAN RECOGNIZE A SET A SET TARGET KIND OF WORD IN 
IT'S DESIGNED IT'S DESIGNED AS A FUN KIND OF THING BUT I GUESS YOU COULD USE IT IS UH AS A WAY TO IMPLEMENT UH 
COMPLETELY POINTLESS YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH UNLESS YOU KNOW YOU LIKE HAVING CONVERSATION WITH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
WELL YEAH THAT'S THE THING 
IF YOU CAN BUT YOU HAVE TO PRO THOUGH I THINK IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE DESIGN SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO RECORD INTO THE DEVICE EVERY POSSIBLE COMBINATION 
YOU HAVE TO S TR TRAIN IT TO L TO LEARN CHANNEL FIFTEEN THAT WHOLE THING 
NOT JUST THE WORD CHANNEL AND THE WORD FIFTEEN IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF LOGIC IN IT 
SO 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE SOME DEVELOPMENT WORK 
YEAH 
BANANA MANDO 
BANANA MAN 
I UH I I I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH IT THOUGH I THINK IT DOESN'T REALLY ADD MUCH TO THE FUNCTIONAL 
DESIGN AND IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT MATURE ENOUGH 
IT IS IS A SPEECH RECOGNITION ENGINE SO 
UM YEAH 
SO IF WE CAN JUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE 
I'VE JUST DONE A QUICK MOCK UP OF UH UH SOME OF THE FEATURES OF OUR POTENTIAL FUNKY LOOKING UH REMOTE CONTROL 
WELL YOU SEE I WAS I WAS UNAWARE AT THIS POINT OF THE OF THE FRUIT FOCUS 
UM SO AT THE MOMENT IT'S MORE OF A BOX FOCUS 
YEAH WELL THIS IS ACTU THIS COULD BE A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FRUIT THAT'S DESIGNED TO BE YOU KNOW SQUARE SO THAT IT PACKS TIGHTER IN THE BOXES 
BUT UM I'VE JUST INDICATED HERE WE COULD HAVE ACTUALLY TWO SCROLL WHEELS 'CAUSE I THINK THE SCROLL WHEEL IS A FAIRLY UM OKAY PART OF 
YOU KNOW I THINK EVERYONE HAS HAS AGREED THAT IT'S THAT IT COULD BE QUITE A USEFUL UM THING IS 
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW TO HAVE TWO SCROLL WHEELS BECAUSE 
YOU KNOW YOU WANT ONE FOR FOR THE CHANNEL BUT YOU ALSO WANT ONE FOR FOR THE VOLUME 
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE VOLUME I IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S VERY HANDY FOR IT TO HAVE UH INSTANT KIND OF UH FEEDBACK UH AND RESPONSE SO 
BUT UM I'VE ALSO INCLUDED THIS TURBO BUTTON BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW EVERY DESIGN SHOULD HAVE A TURBO BUTTON 
AND WELL SO THIS IS YOU KNOW A UNIQUE PROBLEM WITH WITH TELEVISIONS IS THAT IF YOU HAVE THIS SCRO THIS SCROLL WHEEL FOR THE TELEVISION 
THE UH THE TUNER ON THE T. V. IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TO SWITCH BETWEEN STATIONS AS FAST AS YOU CAN SCROLL 
SO YOU KNOW THE THE THE PERSON MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A UH 
MIGHT WANT TO BE ABLE TO SCROLL PAST TELEVISION STATIONS WITHOUT SEEING WHAT'S ON THEM 
IN WHICH CASE IT JUST WAITS UNTIL YOU STOP SCROLLING AND THEN YOU KNOW DISPLAYS THAT STATION 
ARE THEY MIGHT WANT TO SCROLL AND AND HAVE A QUICK GLIMPSE OF IT EVEN IF IT LAGS BEHIND WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
YEAH SO WITH THIS TURBO BUTTON YOU CAN SAY SKIP OVER TO CHANNELS IF UH YOU KNOW IF I'M IF I'M GOING IF I'M SCROLLING PAST THEM AND YOU KNOW 
IT'S UM YOU COULD HAVE A LITTLE RED LIGHT THAT COMES UP WHEN THEY PRESS IT SO THEY FEEL YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY GOING FAST OR WHATEVER 
SO YEAH THAT'S UM THESE ARE THE TWO IMPORTANT UH FEATURES I THINK WE NEED ON THE REMOTE 
BUT I MEAN WE CAN DISCUSS ABOUT WHAT OTHER KIND OF BUTTONS WE NEED UM 
YOU KNOW I IT COULD BE YOU KNOW IF WE IF WE WANNA HAVE LIKE A VERY CHEAP KIND OF DEVICE I MEAN 
WE COULD EITHER CONSIDER THAT MAYBE WE WANT TO SELL THIS IS A VERY IF IT'S GONNA BE A BANANA YOU KNOW THAT'S A PRETTY GIMMICKY KIND OF 
THING THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH FUNCTIONALITY 
IT'S JUST YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF SCROLL WHEELS AND A BUTTON CAUSE IT'S HARD TO GET SO MANY BUTTONS ON A BANANA AND IT'S STILL VERY IT MAY EVEN BE FOR MOST FOR SOME PEOPLE MORE FUNCTIONAL THAN THEIR CURRENT REMOTE 
BUT IF THEY HAVE THESE SCROLL WHEELS SO UM YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER BUTTONS DO WE WANT 
I MEAN WE COULD HAVE WELL I GUESS YOU NEED ONE ONE AND OFF SWITCH 
BUT YOU COULD YOU COULD O YOU COULD TURN TO TURN IT ON BY TAKING THE TOP OFF THE BANANA MAYBE 
YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SPY KIND OF FLICK THING 
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE A MARKETING GURU 
WELL THAT'S THE THING IS HAVE WE DECIDED THAT WE CAN ONLY SPEND UH TWENTY FIVE EURO 
WELL NOT SPEND BUT YOU KNOW CHARGE TWENTY FIVE EURO 
BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TEMPLATE FOR EVERY CHANNEL FOR A HUNDRED CHANNELS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TO RECOGNIZE 
MM 
WELL I IF I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAN 
THEN OR CAN HANDLE BECAUSE IT'S DESIGNED FOR A COFFEE MACHINE YOU KNOW TO SAY HELLO IN THE MORNING 
WELL THAT'S ITS CURRENT APPLICATION I WOULD PRESUME THAT IT'S KIND OF THEY WOULDN'T DESIGN IT TO HANDLE A HUNDRED THINGS THE S 
BUT UH 
WELL I JUST I JUST MADE THE POINT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SPEECH RECOGNITION AS YOU KNOW 
EVEN IF WE CAN DO IT I THINK IT'S NOT REALLY APPROPRIATE FOR UH TELEVISION ENVIRONMENT 
BUT UM I DID HAVE ONE THING FROM A PREVIOUS MEETING 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT UM BEING ABLE TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT EXTENDIN BEING ABLE TO EXTEND THE REMOTE CONTROL BY HAVING YOU KNOW 
A BASE STATION THAT CAN CONTROL OTHER THINGS AS WELL 
IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HAVE SOME KIND OF BASE STATION 
EVEN IF IT'S JUST YOU PRESS ON A BUTTON ON IT AND UH AND THE REMOTE CONTROL STARTS BEEPING 
YOU KNOW THIS IS A WAY OF FINDING THE REMOTE 
YOU IN THAT CASE MAYBE THE MAYBE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THE SPEECH THING COULD BE USEFUL JUST TO SAY I'M HERE BUT UH IT'S PROBABLY A BIT OF OVERKILL IF YOU COULD JUST HAVE A A BEEPING 
IT'S SPEECH 
IT'S IT'S SPEECH SYNTHESIS AND SO IT'S SPEECH KIND OF NOT REALLY SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT KIND OF PATTERN MATCHING YEAH YEAH 
I GUESS THAT FITS IN WITH THE SPONGY KIND OF DESIGN PHILOSOPHY 
SO JUST ONE SECOND WHEN YOU SAY DOUBLE CURVE WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY MEAN 
YOU RECKON YOU COULD LIKE DRAW US A THING IN THE ON THE WHITEBOARD 'CAUSE I'M NOT SURE 
OKAY BUT LIKE KIND OF CONVEX OR CONCAVE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW WOOD 
COULD BE UH QUITE A STYLISH UH OPTION IF YOU TAKE LIKE 
NICE QUALITY KIND OF WOOD THAT'S GOT A NICE GRAIN AND YOU KIND OF PUT SOME SOME VARNISH ON 
WELL IT DEPENDS I MEAN 
YOU HAVE THE OUTS THE WOOD ITSELF IS NOT GONNA BREAK AS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THE CASE BEING BROKEN IT'S THE INSIDE 
YEAH BUT INSIDE YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE YOU CAN STILL HAVE SOME KIND OF CUSHIONING THAT'S NOT VISIBLE AT THE AT THE USER 
AND I MEAN YOU COULD ALSO YOU CAN HAVE JUST A VERY THIN VENEER OF WOOD AS WELL 
THAT'S TRUE BUT ARE WE SIT ON THE BANANA 
DO 
IT'S LIKE A PUMPKIN OR 
GREEN 
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE 
OH YEAH SO IT WHAT'S IT IN FRENCH 
YEAH OKAY SO CAPSICUM OR PEPPER 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT KIND OF BULKY TO ME LIKE 
LIKE WITH A BANANA YOU CAN HAVE 
WELL 
BUT LIKE A BANANA YOU CAN YOU CAN BE HOLDING LIKE THIS AND HAVE THE SCROLL WHEEL KIND OF ON TOP AND JUST 
ROLL IT BACK AND FORTH LIKE THAT BUT WITH UH I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD HOLD A CAPSICUM AND 
SO SO THAT WHEN YOU SAY SPEAKER SUPPORT YOU MEAN IT JUST HAS SOME OUTPUT PINNED WHICH WHICH WHICH KIND OF 
OKAY BUT THE SPEAKER IS ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO THE AT THE CHIP ON SOME WAY OR IS JUST THE THE SIGNAL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO ARE THERE ANY ISSUES WHERE WE PLACE THIS THIS CHIP TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THE THE SPEAKER FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BANANA 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT THE SPEAKER OF THE SPEAKER IS ACTUALLY ON THE CHIP THEN IF IT'S TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE THE CASING 
OR OF THE CASING IS TOO THICK THEN YOU MAY NOT HERE THE THE SPEAKER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WITH THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL DESIGN IS TO KEEP THE THE SPEAKER CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE OUTSIDE 
ALTHOUGH IF 
IT DEPENDS IF WE LIKE IF WE ARE CONCENTRATING ON LIKE A FRUIT DESIGN 
THEN MAYBE MAYBE WE WANNA SELL A COLLECTION OF FRUIT YOU KNOW LIKE A DIFFERENT FRUIT FOR EACH DEVICE 
CASE THAT YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO COLLECT UM YOU KNOW THINGS THAT OF A SIMILAR TYPE 
WELL YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED TO DO FRUIT ON THE FIRST PLACE 
LIKE A POWER FRUIT 
YEAH 
WELL 
I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY HANDY FEATURE 
I THINK IT'S KIND OF PEOPLE WOULD FIND THAT WORTH IT EVEN IF IT WASN'T UH A RECHARGING STATION 
EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BUY EXTRA BATTERIES YOU KNOW 
SO 
ALTHOUGH YOU DO NEED TO INCLUDE R. F. KIND OF CIRCUITRY IN THE REMOTE 
OKAY 
I'M JUST WONDERING ACTUALLY 'CAUSE YOU KNOW I THIS WHOLE FRUIT THING WITH THE BANANA 
IT'S UM IT SEEMED LIKE AT FIRST SEEMS A BIT KIND OF UH NICHE 
LIKE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE WOULD REALLY WANT A BANANA BUT WHAT IF IT WAS KIND OF UH A STYLISED BANANA 
YOU KNOW RATHER THAN HAVING TO KIND OF YOU KNOW YELLOW AND REALLY LOOKING EXACTLY LIKE A BANANA YOU COULD MAKE IT KIND OF SILVER 
AND UM YOU KNOW TO GIVE YOU KIND OF THE IDEA OF A BANANA BUT WITHOUT IT LOOKING YOU KNOW COMPLETELY 
KITSCH 
FOR BETTER WANT OF A BETTER WORD YOU KNOW 
WELL YOU KNOW I DON I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOP 
WELL THEY 
YEAH LIKE THIS COLOUR THIS COLOUR 
MAYBE YOU KNOW MAYBE LIKE STILL IN THE SHAPE OF A BANANA 
NO EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
UM BUT YOU KNOW JUST MAYBE MAYBE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME TEXTURE AS A BANANA AND JUST KIND OF 
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE THING IS IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO MAKE ME TO GIVE LIKE THE TEXTURE OF A BANANA ANYWAY AND TO K TO HAVE THE EXACT SHAPE 
I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT PROPERLY YOU MAY AS WELL DO IT IN A STYLISED WAY THAT JUST LOOKS A BIT MORE KIND OF 
YOU KNOW TWENTY FIRST CENTURY RATHER THAN SIXTIES OR SEVENTIES 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH SO 
I GUESS YOU WANNA HOLD LIKE THE WAY THE END OF THE BANANA YOU WANNA KIND OF HELD SO UM YOU MAYBE WANNA KINDA HOLD LIKE A GUN RATHER THAN 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO TO POINT KIND OF TOWARDS THE FLOOR 
SO 
YOU KNOW SO IF YOU HAVE LIKE 
OKAY SO 
SO 
OKAY SO I GUESS WE NEED YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT CAN FIT A BANANA 
SHAPED OBJECT 
OKAY SO IT'S UH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT SO WE NEED UH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WHICH I THINK IT'S IT'S PROBABLY BEST ACTUALLY ON THE ON THE UNDERNEATH OF THE THE DEVICE SO YOU HAVE 
YES 
YEAH SO YOU HAVE THE THUMB KIND OF HERE 
SO YEAH YOU NEED AN AN HOUR AND IN IN IN THE OTHER SIDE SO YOU GOT VOLUME ON AND CHANNEL 
AND UH 
NO L. C. D. 
UH WE NEED A WE NEED A POWER UM ON OFF SWITCH AS WELL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHERE 
OKAY 
WELL I DUNNO IF THE TRADITIONAL USER IS GONNA BUY A A BANANA REMOTE 
IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU KNOW 
YOU I MEAN YOU NEED TO KIND OF KEEP IT UM 
YEAH HOW MANY OF THESE DID WE WANNA SELL 
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT WAS 
YEAH BUT HOW MANY UNITS DID WE NEED TO TO SELL 
FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION 
THAT'S A LOT OF FRUIT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OH 
THAT CAN BE THE IT 
THAT CAN BE LIKE THE TURBO BANANA PLUS PLUS COMMANDO 
OKAY 
YEP 
WE HAVE TO GO DESIGN THE PROTOTYPE 
OKAY 
GOOD AFTERNOON 
HOPE YOU HAVE GOOD LUNCH 
OH 
NICE 
AND YOU 
OKAY 
SO TODAY IS UM 
OR THIRD MEETING 
IT WILL BE ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN UH 
IF I COME BACK TO UH THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETINGS 
UM 
WE DECIDED NOT TO GO FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE OF SOME REASONS AND WE ARE NOT DECIDED ABOUT U THE EASE OF L. C. D. SCREEN ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE OF COSTS 
SO MAYBE WE C WE WILL BE ABLE TO CLARIFY THIS THIS QUESTION TO TODAY 
UH AT THE END OF THE MEETING WE SHOULD TAKE DECISION ON THAT POINT 
SO I HOPE UH THAT YOUR RESPECTIVE PR PRESENTATIONS UH WILL HELP US 
SO EACH OF YOU HAVE SOME PRESENTATIO PRESENTATION TO PERFORM UM WHO STARTS 
SO MARKETING 
SO YOU ARE YOU SAVED YOUR Y YOUR PRESENTATION SOMEWHERE 
SO YOU'RE FOUR 
WHICH IS TREND WATCH 
OKAY 
MR MARKETING EXPERTS 
SO 
MM-HMM 
NEXT SLIDE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM 
DRAWINGS OF BANANAS 
UH-HUH 
WELL SO THIS IS IN THE NEXT SLIDE CERTAINLY 
IT'S NOT 
SO MAYBE YOU MAYBE YOU CAN DISPLAY A BANANA ON THE L. C. D. 
PEOPLE FOR CHANNEL ONE 
OKAY 
THAT'S A QUESTION 
MAYBE TOO LONG 
A BANANA 
OKAY 
YEAH AND YOU YOU YOU WILL NOT HAVE PLA ENOUGH A LOT OF PLACE TO PUT A L. C. D. IN A BANANA ALSO 
WELL YOU'RE THE MARKETING EXPERT YOU SHOULD TELL US IF IT IS TOO MUCH OR NOT 
SO 
SO Y Y YOU SUGGEST TO GO F 
OKAY 
SO SO YOU'RE SIMPLY YOU'RE SIMPLY LOOKING IS IT A REMOTE CONTROL THAT LOOKS LIKE A BANANA WITH FEW BUTTONS WITH ONLY A FEW BUTTONS 
OKAY GOOD 
SO MAYBE YOU CAN GO AHEAD 
OKAY 
THANKS 
UM 
OKAY I'LL GIVE THE FLOOR 
SO YOU ARE USER INTERFACE GUY 
SO YOU'RE THREE 
AND IT'S THIS ONE 
GO FOR IT 
I THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I 
UNCLEAR REALLY UNDERSTANDING 
SO THIS A TECHNOLOGY THAT RECOGNIZE KEYWORDS SPEECH KEYWORDS 
AND IT'S JUST IT IT'S JUST TO PLAYBACK SOMETHING 
YEAH YEAH 
SO THIS IS NOT IS REALLY TO DO IT TO DO CONTROL 
YEAH 
THIS IS JUST MORE LIKE A POI POIS YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
SO IT IT'S C UH TO TO TO USE A UH UH SAY UH A FANCY THING THAT YOU YOU CAN BRING IT WE CAN BRING TO THE REMOTE CONTROL THAT WILL NOT HAVE ANY UH YEAH COMP COMPLETELY POINTLESS FOR THE ENTIRE FR FROM THE INTERACTION POINT OF V POINT OF VIEW 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
SO THIS IS IS THIS IS THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN TAK TAKING THIS TECHNOLOGY BRINGING IT AT THE REMOTE CONTROL AND USING IT 
SO THIS IS OUT OF DISCUSSION 
SO IF IF IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN WE CAN BRING EASILY NEED TO PUT IT INTO THE BANANA REMOTE CONTROL 
NO THIS IS MM BANANA BANDO YEAH 
UH THEN IT COULD BE COOL YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A BANANA AT ALL 
YEAH 
BUT YOU YOU CAN FIT I YOU'RE SAYING NOW YOU CAN FIT IT IT 
YEAH 
MM 
IT'S ENOUGH 
SWITCH ON 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO I IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING COMPLETELY TO FORGET ABOUT THE L. C. D. THING 
I THINK THAT 
NO WE CAN WE CAN'T SEE THAT 
WE CAN'T SEE THAT IT 
TO COMMAN CO COMMUNICATE IT'S JUST A THING 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
A GOOD GOOD GOOD THING 
YOU WANT TO GO TO MOVE TO YOUR SLIDES 
YOU'RE FINISHED 
YEAH I THINK SO 
MM-HMM

VERY GOOD 
OKAY LET'S MOVE ON 
SO YOU'RE TWO 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM BUT I BET THERE IS NO ELASTICITY WHICH COULD BE 
YEAH BUT THE COMPONENTS INSIDE 
YEAH 
VERY TOO EXPENSIVE TO DO 
AND ALSO UH 
YEAH BUT IT'S MORE EASIER TO DO A BANANA IN PLASTIC THEN UH NO WOOD 
WELL IT LOOK LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE ALL TARGETING THAT YEAH 
YES IT IS 
YEAH 
PUMPKIN 
GREEN 
UM M M YES I SEE 
PEP PEPPERONI 
POIVRON

YOU THINK THAT YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE 
YEAH 
MORE THAN A BANANA 
YEAH 
IT'S KINDA IT'S KIND OF IT'S MORE UH IT'S REALLY ERGONOMIC IT'S FIT IN THE HAND AND YOU'VE A LOT OF SURFACE TO TO PUT THE CONTROLS 
OKAY LET'S MOVE ON 
SO TIME IS RUNNING LET'S MOVE ON 
OKAY 
SO OBJECTS 
CRAZY OBJECTS 
OKAY 
OKAY GOOD 
BU IT'S IT'S 
YOU SEE YOU YOU THING 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YOU THINK THAT YELLOW IT'S KITSCH 
IF YOU MAKE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A BANANA IT SHOULD HAVE THE COLOUR OF A BANANA 
O OTHERWISE 
ROUGHLY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
LET'S MOVE ON 
UH UH YEAH 
BEFORE BEFORE ST BEFORE ENDING THE MEETING I'D LIKE TO TO DRAW SOME SKETCH ABOUT THE PRO FUTURE PROT PROTOTYPE 
GO FOR IT 
WELL N NOT NOT YOU YOU CAN FINISH YOUR SLIDES BEFORE 
MM OKAY 
OKAY 
THAT'S ALL 
OKAY SO MM AS WELL DONE FOR THE PRESENTATIONS 
SO WE NEED TO TAKE SOME DE DECISIONS ABOUT UM BUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO 
SO I I PROPOSE THAT YOU GO TO THE WHITEBOARD AND WE'RE GOING TO REPORT ALL THE IDEAS WE HAD WE HAD DURING THIS THESE PRESENTATIONS JUST TO DRAW SOME SKETCH ABOUT WHAT WILL BE THE PROD FINAL PRODUCT AND UH WHERE SUPERMAN GO BANANA AND UH UH EXTRA FUNC FUNCTIONALITIES SUCH AS WHEELS 
UM THE SPEAKER UNIT UM WELL NOT IN ORDER NOT AT LEAST THE UM THE DEVICE I D I DON'T REMEMBER YOU CALL IT 
BASIS STATION YEAH 
UH SO UM SO WE'RE GOING FOR A STYLISH 
BANANA SHAPE 
YEAH RIGHT 
WE 
I IF IT I IF IT HAS REALLY THE MODEL SHAPE OF A BANA YOU COULD THE THE STARTING IS GOOD BUT IT COULD IT SHOULD HAVE MORE THE SHAPE OF A BANANA IF YOU WANT TO POINT REALLY A AT THE THING 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TO TO DO THAT MOVEMENT WHICH IS WHICH IS DIFFICULT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT IN FACT IT'S BETTER 
SO IT TIME IS RUNNING WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO TO MOVE FORWARD 
SO LET'S SKIP TO UH THIS UH THIS THIS THIS IDEA 
YEAH 
SO WE HAVE THIS 
WE HAVE A A BASIS UM HOW DO YOU CALL IT 
A BASE STATION 
WE'LL HAVE A BASE STATION EXTRA UH IN THE SIDE 
YEAH 
UH WE HAVE A R. F. FOR ME FOR BEEPING FOR BEEPING 
WE NEED B R. F. TO BEEP 
SO WE THAT MEANS WE NEED A BUTTON ON THE ON THE ON THE BOSS 
BASIS STATION THANK YOU 
CAN YOU GO QUICKLY PLEASE 
OKAY 
SO WE ARE GOING TO ADD UH ALSO UM YOU SEE YOU SUGGESTED THE WHEE SOME WHEELS TO CONTROL THE VOLUMES AND CHANNELS AND YOUR TUR TURBO TURBO UH BUTTON 
YEAH IN THE THE YEAH MAYBE HERE 
AND THE AND THE WHOLE A A AT THE LEVEL OF THE THUMB FOR INSTANCE 
AND AND YOU HAVE TWO WHEELS 
OKAY RIGHT 
GOOD 
IS AN L. C. D. 
OKAY GREAT 
UM 
VERY GOOD 
YEAH 
UH JUST THE SWITCH ON IF NOT FOR THE T. V. FOR THE T. V. 
UH SO YOU 
IN THE SIDE 
TWENTY FIVE 
YEAH 
SO 
WELL 
NO 
TIME IS RUNNING WE HAVE TO CLOSE THE MEETING IN A FEW MINUTES 
SO OKAY THE NEXT STEP YOU CAN COME BACK TO YOUR SET 
THE NEXT STEP IS TO GO FOR OUT OF US TO GO TO UH 
TO BUILDING A PROTOTYPE BASED ON THIS OKAY 
SO NEXT MEETING YOU GUYS HAVE TO PREPARE THE FOLLOWI THINGS 
YOU HAVE TO UH WORK ON THE LOOK AND FEEL UH DESIGN AND YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THE USER INTERFACE 
IN FACT YOU TWO YOU HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MODEL THE FIRST UH F FIRST PROTOTYPE 
UH MARKETING EXPERT UH HAVE TO GO TO PRODUCT EVALUATION 
OKAY 
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT 
IT'S NOT A POSSI IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT IT FOR THE NEXT PROTOTYPE IS IT IT'S IN THE NEXT PROTOTYPE SO LET'S SKIP IT 
YEAH MAYBE FOR THE ONE OF IF IF IT IT WORKS WELL WE'LL GO FOR UH AN ORANGE ONE 
YEAH YEAH HONOUR THE FRUIT 
OKAY 
THANKS VERY MUCH 
WE'LL SEE ON NEXT MEETING 
BYE 
THANK YOU 
AFTERNOON 
YEAH WE HAD FALAFEL 
MM-HMM 
SPONGY MEANS IT IT'S LIKE SPEE 
BUT WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION HOW WE CAN HAVE SOME SHAPE LIKE THAT IN THE REMOTE 
MM-HMM 
MEANS BUTTONS ARE IN THE SHAPE OF FRUITS BUTTONS ARE IN THE FRAPE SHAPE OF FRUITS OR SOMETHING APPLE BANANA SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THAT WE CAN DISCUSS AFTERWARDS 
BANANA 
MM-HMM 
I DON'T TH IT WILL BE ROLLING A LOT 
BUT IT'S JUST A SPEAKER RIGHT 
IT'S NOT A MICROPHONE 
MM-HMM 
ACTUALLY I'M NOT READING MICROPHONE THERE SO THAT'S WHY YOU CAN ALL HAVE CONVERSATION IT JUST TO SPEAK TO YOU 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
IN HOUSE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OKAY LET'S GO AHEAD 
STABLE THING THAT'S RIGHT 
TO HAVE MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
COMMUNICATE 
IT'S ONE WAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
SO IT'S A SPEECH SYNTHESIS KIND OF THING SOMETHING HAS BEEN UH STORED AND IT'S JUST UH SPOKEN OUT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
SO THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT THE COMPONENT DESIGN 
SO FIRST THING SO WE NEED POWER SOURCE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO I WAS OF THE IDEA THAT WE CAN HAVE TWO KIND OF POWER SUPPLIES ONE IS THE USUAL BATTERIES WHICH ARE THERE 
THEY COULD BE CHARGEABLE BATTERIES IF THERE'S A BASIS STATION KIND OF THING AND ON TOP OF THAT WE CAN HAVE SOLAR CELLS 
WHEN THE LIGHTING CONDITIONS ARE GOOD THEY CAN BE USED SO IT'LL BE PRETTY UH INNOVATIVE KIND 
THEN UH WE NEED PLASTIC WITH SOME ELASTICITY SO THAT IF YOUR OF THE REMOTE CONTROL FALLS IT'S NOT BROKEN DIRECTLY INTO PIECES 
THERE SHOULD BE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN IT 
YEAH 
SO THERE SHOULD WE SHOULD THINK OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN IT SHOULD BE DOUBLE CURVE 
THE S SCIENCE FOR THE EASE OF HANDLING AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER ISSUES WHY WE NEED DOUBLE CURVE 
THEN CONTROLS FOR THE TRADITIONALS U TRADITIONAL USERS WE CAN HAVE THE PUSH BUTTONS SO THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THAT IT'S AN ALIEN THING FOR THEM 
DOUBLE CURVE SO YOU HAVE CURVES ON BOTH THE SIDES IF I'M RIGHT 
SO IT'S SYMMETRICAL KIND OF THING WHATEVER IT IS 
SO IT COULD BE CURVE IS IT COULD BE CONVEX CONVE CONCAVE DEPENDING ON WHAT WHAT WE WANT 
SO THERE ARE FLATS THERE ARE SINGLE CURVE AND THERE ARE DOUBLE CURVES 
THESE ARE THE OTHER THINGS AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT MATERIALS WITH PLASTIC YOU CAN HAVE DOUBLE CURVE BUT WITH UH CERTAIN OTHER MATERIALS WE CANNOT HAVE DOUBLE CURVE 
SO THERE THERE WAS UH THERE WERE MANY OTHER MATERIALS LIKE WOOD TITANIUM AND ALL THESE THINGS 
BUT PLASTIC AS I THINK SO THE MOST APPROPRIATE ONE IT'LL BRING THE COST DOWN AND ANYWAY IT'S 
WOODEN CASES 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO IT AN E APPLE WHICH HAS 
BANANA IS MORE HANDIER AS COMPARED TO THIS I THINK NEED TO CAPSICUM 
OKAY SO PUSH BUTTONS FOR THE TRADITIONAL USERS USE THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THEY ARE ALIENATED 
JUST NEED A SCROLL BUTTON WITH PUSH TECHNOLOGY FOR CHANNEL SELECTION VOLUME CONTROL AND TELETEXT BROWSING 
THESE ARE THE OTHER SCROLL BUTTONS WHICH ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE WITH US IN THE COMPANY AND WE WE CAN GO AHEAD WITH THAT 
YEAH WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE 
THEN UH THERE ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF CHIPS IN ONE IS THE BASIC CHIP AND THE REGULAR CHIP AND AN AN ADVA ADVANCED CHIP 
SO WE CAN HAVE REGULAR CHIP FOR CONTROL 
PRICING IS A FACTOR FOR SO THAT'S WHY WE'LL GO FOR THE REGULAR CHIP 
AND UH REGULAR CHIP SUPPORTS SPEAKER SUPPORT SO THIS FUNCTIONALITY COULD BE USED FOR TRACING THE MOBILE PHONE WHICH HAS BEEN MISPLACED 
IT COULD BE A BEEP KIND OF THING 
YES YES THAT'S RIGHT IT'S IT'S NOT THE CHIP MOST MOST PROBABLY NOT NOT HUNDRED PER CENT SURE ABOUT THAT 
THAT WILL BE THE VOLUME CONTROL I THINK WHICH WHICH A USER SHOU IT IT SHOULD BE ALREADY PRE DEFINED 
IT SHOULD BE WHATEVER WILL BE THE CASE THE CHIP IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE SITTING INSIDE 
MM-HMM 
UH SO WE CAN HAVE TO TO ONE OF THE BOUNDARIES SO THAT THINGS ARE SLIGHTLY BETTER 
SO ARE AS HEARING IS CONCERNED WE CAN HAVE SOME GAP AT SOME PLACE SO THAT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
SO THESE THESE WERE THE COMPONENT SELECTION AND THESE THINGS 
WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE 
AND UH THESE WERE THE FINDINGS WHICH I I SAW WITH THE WEB WEB 
THAT USER WANTS TO HAVE CONTROL MORE THAN ONE DEVICE WANTS TO CONTROL MORE THAN ONE DEVICE FROM THE SAME REMOTE CONTROL 
SO OUR T. V. REMOTE CAN HAVE LITTLE EXTRA THINGS TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL DEVICES LIKE V. C. R. D. V. D. PLAYERS WHICH ARE USUALLY ATTACHED WITH THE T. V. 
BECAUSE USERS ARE LIKE THIS AND THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE ONE REMOTE CONTROL FOR EVERYTHING 
SO WITH THIS ADDITIONAL LITTLE WE MIGHT BE HAVING SLIGHTLY BETTER MARKET FOR US 
MM 
OF FRUITS 
MM-HMM 
REMOTES OBJECTS OKAY 
AND UH AS WELL SO I COULD USE IN THE WEB THE SCROLL BUTTON IS BECOMING REALLY UH HOT THING IS AND WE SHOULD HAVE IT IN THE REMOTE 
SO YOU'RE HAVING A BASIS STATION 
OKAY 
YOUR USUALLY YOUR REMOTE SITS IN THAT 
SO YOU AND IT'S THAT'S WHY IT CAN HAVE CHARGEABLE BATTERIES 
NOW LET'S SAY 
BASIS STATION IS WITH THE THING 
IT'S LIKE A TELEPHONE HANDSET IS THERE AND THE BASIS STATION FOR THE TELEPHONE HAND SET IS THERE 
SO NOW WHAT USER GETS ADDITIONALLY HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BUY BATTERIES THEY'RE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES SO OVER THE PERIOD OF COR TIME HE'LL RECOVER THE COST 
SO YOU'RE HAVING THE BASIS STATION AND THERE IS A BUTTON IF YOU PRESS THAT BUTTON WHEREVER THE REMOTE IT'LL START BEEPING SO YOU KNOW WHERE THE REMOTE SO 
OH 
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM 
UH THIS IS BASIS STATION IS NOTHING MORE 
JUST IT'S A WIRE WHICH IS COMING FROM THE MAIN CABLE AND UH YOU'RE HAVING ONE SOCKET ON WHICH THE THING SITS 
THAT'S RIGHT 
BUT ALL THESE THINGS ARE USUALLY IN HOUSE SO WE DON'T HAVE MUCH PROBLEMS 
SO COMPONENT COST IS GOING TO BE THE LAST 
ANYWAY WE ARE NOT USING REALLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY L. C. D. HAS ALREADY BEEN RULED OUT A. S. R. HAS BEEN RULED OUT 
SO IT'S THE BASIC THING ABOUT VERY TRENDY AND VERY USER FRIENDLY 
AND 
MM-HMM 
A YEAH OTHERWISE IT'LL BE MIS MEANS YOU DON'T GET BE ANY FEELING THEN 
IT'S ANOTHER A BANANA NOR A 
AND UH GOING TO THE LAST SLIDE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO 
ANYWAY USERS'LL BE AS THE FINDINGS IS USERS'LL BE VERY INTERESTED IN OUR LOCATOR DEVICE TO FIND THEIR MISPLACED REMOTES 
SO THAT WAS VERY I THOUGHT IT'S A VERY GOOD SUGGESTION BY EVERYBODY 
THAT'S IT 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THE BASIS STATION 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THERE'S LESS SPACE IN THIS TO PUT WITH THE BUTTONS 
UH WHAT ABOUT A 
THE BASE STATION 
RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH WE NEED THAT YEAH 
BASIS STATION 
YEAH YEAH 
TURBO BUTTON 
OKAY 
UH FOR THE REMOTE 
REMOTES DON'T HAVE POWER ON OFF SWITCH 
OKAY 
SO ONE THAT'LL BE CONTROLLED BY THE THOSE BUTTONS'LL BE THERE ALREADY YEAH 
MEANS ON THE REMOTE 
BECAUSE REMOTE IS GOING TO HAVE BOTH THE INTERFACES SCROLL AS WELL AS BUTTONS 
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO COST YOU MUCH EVERYTHING IS IN HOUSE AND NOW YOU DON'T WANT THE TRADITIONAL USERS TO BE APPREHENSIVE OF THIS 
OH YEAH 
THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH I DIDN'T THINK OF 
BUT YOU KNOW OUR TARGETS ARE VERY HIGH MEANS FIFTY MILLION EUROS IS THE PROFIT WHICH WE WANT MAKE 
TWENTY FIVE 
TWELVE POINT FIVE IS THE PROFIT ON ONE 
UH FORTY THE FOUR 
POINT POINT FOUR MILLION 
POINT FOUR MILLION 
IN THE MARKET 
MM-HMM 
FOR THE FUTURE PROTOTYPES 
SO MEETING'S OVER 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
THE PROBLEM IS AFTER ALL THIS MEETING THERE IS 
OKAY 
YEP 
FOUR YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S ME 
OH 
WELL I INVESTIGATE THE PREFERENCE MORE D I INVESTIGATE DEEPER THE PREFERENCE OF THE USERS 
UH IS THE THE CURRENT INVESTIGATION TH UH THE UH SORRY THE CURRENT 
THE ONE 
CURRENT TRENDS 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL WHA WHAT I FOUND UM CAN YOU 
YEAH 
THANK YOU 
WHAT I FOUND IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE FROM LESS IT MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT 
PEOPLE WANT AN EASY TO USE DEVICE 
AFTER THEY THEY WANT SOMETHING NEW TECHNOLOGIC TECHNOLOGICALLY SPEAKING 
BUT THE MOST WHAT THEY WHAT THEY FIND MORE MORE INTERESTING MORE OR MORE IMPORTANT IT'S UH A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL INSTEAD OF UH INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT 
THE CURRENT TREND WHICH WAS OF THE FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL 
SO NOW MORE MORE COOL ASPECT 
UM MORE A COOLER ASPECT UH RATHER THAN A DEVICE WITH MANY FUNCTIONS AND MANY BUTTONS WITH INSTEAD OF I INSTEAD OF UH OF A DEVICE WHICH CAN DO MANY THINGS 
A DEVICE WHICH IS PLEASANT TO TO WATCH IT IS 
UH ALSO 
WELL IN ONE OR IN IN PARIS AND AND MILAN THE IN PARIS AND IN PARIS AND MILAN THE THE CURRENT TREND OF UH OF CLOTHES 
FURNITURE AND ALL THIS 
ALL THIS FASHION IT'S IT'S FRUIT AND THE THE THE THEM IS FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 
AND ALSO IN THE ON THE U. S. A. THE THE CURRENT THE MORE THE MOST POPULAR FEELING IT'S IT'S A SPONGY 
SPONGY MEANS EPONGE 
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD WE SHOULD THINK IN IN THIS DIRECTION SO 
FRUIT VEGETABLES IS THE THE NEW HAVE YOU SEEN THE LAST EXPOSITION OF CLOTHES IN MILAN 
YEAH I I DIDN'T MISS NO I DIDN'T MISS AND I SAW THAT THE FRUIT THERE ARE MANY FR PICTURES OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THE CLOTHES 
NO NO NOT NOT YET NOT YET 
YEAH YEAH 
SO TE TEXTU TEXTURES YEAH 
YEAH 
VEGETABLE TEXTURES AND ALL THOSE KIND 
OH YEAH YEAH 
OH NO NO IT'S NOT 
IT'S 
AND 
UM 
I UH I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF ANY PARTICULAR FRUIT BUT THE GENERAL ASPECT OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
MY MY COULD REMIND SOME KIND OF VEGETABLE SOME KIND OF 
INSTEAD OF VEGETABLE SOME NATUR MM UH NATURAL OBJECT OR SOMETHING 
BUT YEAH IT IT DEPENDS ON THE 
YEAH MAYBE THE SHAPE THE SHAPE 
NO NOT N NOT NOT TOO MUCH FOCUS 
NOT TOO MUCH FOCU NOT IN INTO IT IS NOT TOO SIMILAR TO A FRUIT BECAUSE NEXT YEAR THE TEN THE TREND THE TREND WILL BE DIFFERENT 
SO WE SHOULDN'T BE TO RE REALLY ATTACHED 
IT AT THE TREND BUT 
FOR INSTANCE YEAH 
AFRICAN OR IS AN ELEPHANT 
WELL M MAYBE WE WE SHOULD FURTHER SPECIFY WHAT TARGET ARE WE FOCUSING 
I THINK IN MY OPINION WE SHOULD FOCUS ON ON YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE OPEN TO NEW DEVI NEW DEVICES AND ALSO YEAH ACCORDING TO THE MARKETING REPORT NINETY P NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WAS 
WAS WAS ABLE TO 
TO BUY A A IN A COOLER REMOTE CONTROL 
WHAT 
WHAT 
YEAH 
OH 
SO THE NEW TREND 
OF THE 
NO I THINK WE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT A A SHAPE WITH IT A DEVICE WITH A SHAPE OF SOME 
YEAH 
DON DON'T YOU THINK WE CAN FIND UH THE SHAPE OF A FRUIT WHICH IS HANDY TO USE 
OR UM 
MAYBE 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT I LI I LIKE YOUR IDEA THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS B BUTTONS SO 
UH DO YOU WANT A AN L. C. D. WITH TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
I THINK 
WELL ACCORDING TO THE AT THE REPORT PEOPLE ARE MORE INTERESTED IN IN A F FANCY LOOK AND FEEL AND IN A TECHNOLOGICAL INNO IN INNOVATION 
SO I WILL GIVE MORE IMPORTANCE AT THE LOOK AND FEEL THAN RATHER THAN THE 
NEW INPUTS AND ALSO IT'S I'M NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THIS L. C. D. BECAUSE YOU AND UH INTERNET CONNECTION 
YOU NEED MORE THINGS IT'S NOT JUST BUYING A NEW CONTROL OUR REMOTE YOU NEED BUYING CONTROL REMOTE BUYING UH 
MORE THINGS 
IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE 
FOR INSTANCE YEAH 
YEAH FOR FOR FOR GIVEN AN AN EXAMPLE YEAH 
YEAH NO IT'S WHAT I ALREADY SAID 
YEAH BUT YOU CAN U 
YEAH BUT THE CAN WE USE IT FOR SAYING OKAY CHANNEL FIFTY CHANNEL TWENTY 
UM MIND 
BANANA MANDO YEAH 
LOOKS LIKE A TR LOOK LIKES A A TRO A TROPICAL FRUIT 
YEAH 
WHAT'S A TURBO BUTTON 
IT CAN IT CONTROLS THE SPEED 
YEAH 
SO SOUNDS CRAZY 
I LIKE CRAZY IDEAS 
YEAH OF COURSE 
I I THINK WE COULD USE SOMEHOW THE S COFFEE MACHINE DIALOGUE INTERFACE OR SO 
YOU WE CAN 
WE CAN'T 
YEAH BUT WE CAN SAY CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE 
NO 
IT'S NOT A LOT ONE HUNDRED TEMPLATES IT'S NOT 
UH IT'S DESIGNED FOR A COF OKAY 
SO TO DESIGN FOR A COFFEE MACHINE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MAYBE YOU COULD ASK YOUR THE YOU COULD ASK THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT IF WE CAN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ACTUALLY 
I WAS THINKING THAT THE 
THE SHAPE OF A BANANA IS NOT 
IT'S NOT REALLY HANDY 
UH I DON'T KNOW THE NAME O O IN ENGLISH UH 
THIS IT'S NOT A FRUIT IT'S A VEGETABLE 
GREEN 
AND YOU PUT IN THE SLIDE 
UM 
OUI C'EST CA 
PEPPER 
AND IT'S AL IT ALSO SUITS WITH THE DOUBLE CURVE FOR SAY IF 
NO I MEAN IN A 
I'M SURE IT'S FINE 
BUT BANANA IS NOT SO HANDY I THINK THAT'S HANDIER 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE FUNNY AT THE BEGINNING BUT AFTER ONE MONTH YOU WILL BE TIRED OF BE SURROUNDED OF FRUITS 
NO BUT I THINK JUST ONE FRUIT TO CONTROL EVERYTHING 
A POWER FOR A POWER UM A MANDO A SUPERMANDO FRUIT 
ACTUALLY I I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND VERY WELL THIS TRACE SPEAKER LOST CONTROL 
SO YOU YOU HAVE TO BUY TWO THINGS THE BANANA AND THE BASIS STATION 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT I'M A BIT WORRIED ABOUT THE BUDGET 
YEAH 
NO I I 
MAYBE LI LIKE THAT 
WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THIS SHAPE 
MORE OR LESS 
YEAH BUT HOW MANY BUTTONS DO WE NEED 
WHAT A 
WHAT ABOUT 
FOUR MILLIONS 
WHAT ABOUT A 
I W WHAT ABOUT ADDING THE THIS WORD SPOTTING KEYWORD SPOTTING RECOGNITION SAYING VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN 
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT BUT PEOPLE LIKE INNOVATION AND THAT'S REALLY UH INNOVATIVE AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD COST A LOT JUST A FEW FIVE WORDS 
OKAY 
PLUS PLUS OKAY 
MAYBE OBJECTIVE BANANA 
THANK YOU 
YEAH SO UH FOLLOWING OUR DECISION TO UH 
MAKE A YELLOW WELL TO MAKE A BANANA 
REMOTE OKAY SO 
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A 
WE'VE WELL FIRST FIRST OF ALL WE MADE A AN ATTRACTIVE BASE STATION UH WITH A BANANA LEAF UH LOOK AND FEEL UM AND UH 
BANA SIT THE BANANA SITS IN THERE K YOU KNOW NICELY WEIGHTED SO THAT IT'S NOT GONNA TIP OVER AND UM THIS IS THE REMOTE ITSELF 
IT'S KIND OF IT'S IT'S ERGONOMIC IT FITS IN THE HAND UH RATHER WELL 
WE'VE GOT THE TWO UH 
UH SCROLL WHEELS HERE WHICH YOU KNOW IN IN THE THE LEFT FOR THE UH VOLUME AND THE IN IN THE RIGHT FOR FOR THE CHANNEL AND UH UNDERNEATH WE HAVE THE UH THE TURBO BUTTON WHICH IS IN LIKE A NICE UH TRIGGER POSITION FOR YOU KNOW FOR PRESSING QUITE NATURALLY 
THIS IS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU UH ARE SCROLLING THE UH THROUGH THE CHANNELS YOU CAN TELL IT TO TO SKIP THE PAST CHANNELS THAT YOU QUICKLY RATHER TH 
YEAH 
WELL WHEN YOU STOP SCROLLING THE WHOLE IT STOPS 
BUT NORMALLY WITH UH IT WILL JUST UH S STAY IN EACH STATION BRIEFLY SO YOU CAN USE THE THE PICTURE 
THE T. V. YEAH 
THE USE THE TURBO BUTTON 
SO RATHER THAN HAVING UH AN EXTRA BUTTON FOR ME FOR THE ON OFF SWITCH YOU JUST USE THE TURBO BUTTON 
THIS IS A TELETEXT BUTTON 
SO ONCE YOU PRESS THAT THEN YOU GET TELETEXT AND YOU CAN USE THE THE CHANNEL SELECTOR SCROLL WHEEL IS UH 
TO NAVIGATE YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL THEN YOU CAN YOU YOU HAVE LIKE A LITTLE UH NUMBER SELECTION THING 
YOU PRESS THE THE THE TELETEXT BUTTON UH TO MOVE BETWEEN UH THE FIELDS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SCROLL THE NUMBER BACK AND FORTH SO YOU HAVE SO YOU GO YOU SCROLL TO SEVEN AND THEN 
ZERO ZERO AND THEN YOU CAN UH 
WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN PRESS PRESS THE TELETEXT BUTTON AND THEN YOU THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN IF 
MM UH 
AND THIS IS THE UH THE INFRARED UH PART 
ALSO THE TOP OF THE BANANA 
SO 
AND THEN WE HAVE ON THE UH IN THE BASE STATION WE HAVE THE THE BUTTON TO THE FRONT FOR UH FOR CALLING THE UH THE BANANA 
ACTUALLY THEY DO 
THAT'S THAT'S YEAH THAT'S UH THAT'S FORM AND FUNCTION IN THE IN IN THE ONE UH OBJECT 
YEAH 
SO 
BUT YEAH THAT'S UM THAT'S JUST LIKE THAT'S AN ATTRACTIVE UM BASE STATION 
SO 
OKAY 
IT'S IT'S UH IT'S ABOUT THE WEIGHT OF A BANANA 
YOU KNOW TO GIVE YOU THE CORRECT LOOK AND FEEL 
I THINK A CHILD WOULD TRY TO TO IT ANYWAY SO MAYBE WE SHOULD 
CONSIDER THAT 
MAYBE HEALTH AND SAFETY ASPECTS 
YEAH 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THE SOLAR CELLS ARE ACTUALLY NECESSARY ANY MORE IF YOU HAVE A RECHARGING BASE STATION 
IF I WAS GONNA PLACE THEM I'D PUT THEM IN THE ON THE TOP HERE SINCE THAT'S LIKE UH THE BLACK BUT BUT YEAH I DON'T I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE THE SOLAR CELLS ANYMORE 
THE WHITE SORRY 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
OH 
OH 
A LONG TIME 
NO NO NO IT CAN IT SHOULD BE WEEKS 
YEAH BUT YOU PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO PUT IT BACK IN THE BASE STATION ALL THE TIME PEOPLE LEAVE WANNA LEAVE IT IN THE COUCH SO 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
IT SEEMS TO BE FALLING OVER 
OR CAN MOVE BETWEEN POSITIONS IN THE ON THE NUMBER 
IT'S ALL AUTOMATIC 
YEP 
OH 
YEAH UH FIVE 
FIVE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE SIX IT'S IT'S I GUESS IT'S YEAH 
I'D GIVE IT A SIX LIKE I'D I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE HANDY THAN MY CURRENT REMOTE 
'CAUSE OF THE SCROLL WHEELS BUT MAYBE LOSES THE POINT FOUR NOT HAVING YOU KNOW THE EXTRA BUTTONS WHEN YOU REALL IF YOU DO NEED THEM FOR SOME REASON BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS USE YOUR THREE 
REMOTE 
YEAH 
WELL IT DEPENDS WHEN YOU SAY FUNCTIONAL DO YOU MEAN IT DOES WHAT WE WANT TO TO DO 
OR D DOES WHAT IT DOES YOU KNOW CAN TO MAKE YOU COFFEE 
YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S BEFORE 
YEAH 
I HAVE TO SAY FOUR 
WELL IT'S NOT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE 
REMEMBER WE'RE FOCUS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FOCUS JUST ON T. V. S 
WELL ALL T. V. S BUT ONLY T. ONLY T. V. S I GUESS 
FOUR 
JUST FOR 
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME OUTLIERS SO 
WHICH 
I'LL SAY FIVE 
YEAH 
SO YEAH 
'CAUSE IT'S FIVE FIVE SEVEN SEVEN IS 
OH OKAY DEFINITELY EASY TO USE 
SEVEN 
ALRIGHT NOW HERE'S THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION WELL TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE EURO QUESTION 
WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU GUYS RECKON 
HMM 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I'D SAY TWO 
I DON'T WANT A BANANA IN MY LIVING ROOM TABLE A BANANA REMOTE 
IT IS HANDY IT'S HANDY BUT IT IT'S TERRIBLE 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT A POSITIVE THING 
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S HANDY IT'S ERGONOMIC BUT IT'S A BANANA 
YEAH BUT IT SAYS I I WOULD BUY THIS IS 
NO IT'S I 
I WOULD BUY 
SO SO 
STILL I I'D SAY TWO 
I DON'T THINK I IT ANY STAGE IN MY LIFE I WOULD WANT A BANANA REMOTE CONTROL REALLY 
I CAN SAY MAYBE THERE IS A MARKET FOR IT I DUNNO 
YEAH 
OKAY SO IT DEPENDS IF UH 
IF I HAD TO IF I HAD TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE EURO 
IF THAT WAS LIKE MY LIMIT MAYBE I WOULD BUY IT 
BECAUSE THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE EURO REMOTE CONTROLS ARE PROBABLY GONNA LOOK 
WORSE THAN A BANANA 
AND IT YEAH THIS IS GONNA IF YOU KNOW HANDY TO USE 
ALTHOUGH IT STILL HAS TO STILL HAS THE WORD OF COURSE TO THE BEGINNING SO I DUNNO 
UM 
I'D GIVE IT I'D GIVE IT A 
I GIVE IT A FOR NOW 
YEAH 
I'D SAY THREE I MEAN MY REMOTE CONTROL IS KINDA AT HOME IS PRETTY TERRIBLE 
IF IT WAS CHANGE MY REMOTE CONTROL OF MY D. V. D. PLAYER FOR A MANDO BANANA THEN I WOULD BE MORE INCLINED TO BUT UH 'CAUSE IT'S REALLY BAD BUT UH I'D SAY A THREE 
IT'S NOT VERY PROMISING BUT YOU KNOW 
WE'RE NOT YOUNG TRENDSETTERS 
SO THERE SOME SOME FORMULA YOU'RE USING THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO SUM THEM UP 
WELL JUST LEAVE IT TO THAT THEN 
NO 
I THINK IT IT KIND OF YOU JUST LOSE INFORMATION IF YOU SEEM TO USE 
WELL WE DECIDED AGAINST THE SOLAR CELLS SO 
YOU MEAN CHARGING IT BY SHAKING THE BANANA 
WELL MAYBE DYNAMO IS LIKE YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY 
YEAH 
WELL ACTUALLY THAT THAT IN THAT SAMPLE SPEAKER IS NOT WE WE'RE NOT USING THAT 
WE'RE JUST USING THE THE VERY BEEP SIMPLE BEEP THAT IS THAT SIMPLE THING IS LIKE THE VOICE RECORDING AND EVERYTHING 
SO 
YEAH 
I SAY THAT 
YEAH 
MM 
WELL WAIT A SECOND ONE IT'S IT'S DOUBLE CURVED IT'S GOT A C IT'S UH 
WELL D YEAH IT'S MONOTONIC BUT 
IT'S GOT BUT IF YOU HOLD IT 
IF YOU HOLD IT THAT WAY THAT'S TWO CURVED 
NO NO THIS USED IN IN THAT SIDE BUT THEY'RE OPPOSITE SIDES 
THIS IS ACTUALLY I MEAN THIS PROBABLY 
THIS PROBABLY ACTUALLY COSTS MORE THAN THREE IF YOU 
YEAH 
WELL NO DIDN'T WE SAY WE WANTED TO DO A RUBBER 
IF YOU DROP IT 
WELL WHEN OKAY 
WELL WE WE'LL COME BACK WE'LL COME BACK AND SO IF WE CAN FIT IT IN 
YEAH 
NO WE HAVE TWO PUSH BUTTONS 
HUH 
OKAY IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE PLASTIC 
IT'S A RECHARGER THING AND UH 
WELL I ACTUALLY DID UM 
THINK ABOUT IT MYSELF BUT I THOUGHT YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU COULD POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE PUSHING IT DOWN SO YOU SCROLL IT FOR A INSTEAD OF A TURBO BUTTON BUT YOU KNOW THE TURBO BUTTON DOES ADD THAT EXTRA CLASS 
YOU KNOW 
SO I MEAN IF WE'RE IF WE'RE OVER BUDGET THEN MAYBE WE COULD WE COULD RETHINK THAT 
YEAH 
NO WE'RE NOT WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING SPECIAL FOR THE BUTTONS 
MAKE IT PLASTIC INSTEAD OF RUBBER 
AND THEN WE'RE BASICALLY O ON BUDGET EXCEPT FOR YOU KNOW TEN CENTS 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL PL THE BASE STATION IS MADE OUT OF M MANY UNITS OF PLASTIC 
DOES THAT INCLUDE CHARGING CIRCUITRY AND EVERYTHING 
SO WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE EXTRA PROFITS 
OKAY 
THE NEXT FRUIT 
NO WE HAVE A PRODUCT WHICH NONE OF US WOULD BUY 
NO IT'S PEOPLE IN IN IN MILAN AND UH IN PARIS THAT ARE GONNA BUY IT 
WE'RE N YEAH 
WE'RE NOT IN MILAN OR PARIS 
ACTUALLY THERE WERE A LOT OF 
THAT'S 'CAUSE I'M SICK OF MILAN 
OKAY SO UM PROJECT PROCESS 
YEAH 
I DUNNO I THINK WE HAD A FAIR BIT OF CREATIVITY 
AND UH BUT I THINK ONE THING WE M MISSED OUT OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS WAS A UM LIKE A FOCUS GROUP WITH THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WE'RE TARGETING 
WE NEEDED SOME OF THOSE KIND OF YOUNG TRENDSETTERS TO COME ON AND PLAY WITH THE BANANA AND YOU KNOW SO IF THEY 
SO IF THEY LIKE IT 
BECAUSE YEAH THE EVALUATION FOR US IS IS KIND OF 
POINTLESS 
YEAH 
BECAUSE IT IT WOULD ALSO BE INTERESTING TO UH YOU TO KNOW FIND OUT IF WE HAVE A MARKET IN REALLY YOUNG CHILDREN AS WELL 
IT AS YOU KNOW HOW TO HOW TO MARKET THIS THING 
'CAUSE YOU KNOW IF WELL I MEAN MAYBE YOU DON'T WANNA GIVE ALL YOUR KIDS THEIR OWN REMOTE BECAUSE THEY'LL BE CHANGING THE CHANNEL ALL THE TIME BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE IN SOME HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THERE IS YOU KNOW A T. V. FOR EACH KID 
THEN YOU KNOW BANANA REMOTE CONTROL COULD BE FUN FOR THEM AS WELL 
MIGHT HAVE TO DRAW A FACIA ON IT 
SO BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO TO WORK ON NEXT TIME IS REALLY FINDING IT MORE ABOUT THE TARGET 
MARKET 
YEAH 
I THINK THERE ARE WAYS WE COULD MAYBE SIMPLIFY THE 
WELL JUST THE THE THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT WE'RE USING INSIDE I'M NOT SURE REALLY HOW COMPLICATED OUR UM 
OR NEEDS ARE 
I MEAN ALL WE HAVE IS TWO PUSH BUTTONS AND TWO SCROLLERS DO WE REALLY NEED AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT IT 
YOU KNOW TO PROCESS THAT 
AND ALSO IF YOU KNOW FOR MOOD LIGHTING AND AND STUFF THAT WOULD BE RATHER COOL 
I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ONE VERSION TWO 
SO THE ABILITY TO YOU KNOW TO CONTROL THINGS OTHER THAN THE T. V. AND NOT JUST ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT BUT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT OF THE ROOM 
YEP 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
OKAY 
GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN 
SO WE SHOULD HAVE OUR FINAL MEETING ABOUT THE DETAIL DESIGNED OF DETAIL DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM SO HERE IS THE AGENDA FOR TODAY 
UH UH JUST GOING TO GO QUICKLY THROUGH THE MINUTES OF THE LAST LAST UH MEETING THEN WE HAVE A P PRESENTATION OF PROTOTYPE IF YOU TWO SOUNDS INTERESTING 
AND WE'LL HAVE UM PRESENTATION OF EVALUATION CRIT CRITERIA BY OU OUR MARKETING EXPERTS 
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH FINANCE EVALUATION OF THE OF THE COST OF THE THING AND UM HOPEFULLY UH WE SHOULD FIT THE TARGET O TW OF TWELVE POINT FIVE UH UH OR 
OKAY 
SO LET'S GO 
UH IF I GO QUICKLY THROUGH THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING 
SO WE WENT THROUGH THE UH WE WE TAKE THIS FOLLOWING DECISIONS 
NO L. C. D. ON SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY OKAY WE WENT THROUGH A B IT A BANANA LOOK AND FEEL FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
WE WENT THROUGH THE EASE OF WHEELS AND BUT BUTTONS 
AND ALSO THE EASE OF A BASIS STATION FOR BATTERY CH CHARGING AND UH ALSO TO UM CALL THE TO CALL THE MOT MOTE REMOTE CONTROL WHEN IT IS LOST 
OKAY 
UM 
GOOD 
SO GUYS 
LET THIS UH WONDERFUL THING 
OH YEAH 
SORRY 
UM 
WHICH IS 
YEAH CAN YOU SHOW IT AT THE THE CAMERA MAYBE 
MM-HMM 
WHAT'S THE S UH OF THE T TURBO BUTTON ALREADY 
OH YEAH YEAH ONE THEN YOU STOP WHEN YOU STOP IT STOPS 
UH-HUH 
WHICH ONE 
OKAY 
TO NAVIGATE IT THROUGH THE THROUGH TELETEXT 
WITH THE WHOLE IT'S EASY 
EXCELLENT 
CALLING 
EXCELLENT 
AND THE THE LEAVES PLAYS THE RELEASE OF OF ANTENNAS 
OH 
GREAT 
SO WHAT ELSE 
YEAH THEY'RE LIGHT 
OH YEAH 
SO FOR THE POWER SOURCE APPARENTLY YOU STILL Y YOU WANT TO USE BOTH SOLAR CELLS AND BATTERIES 
UH YOU MEAN OKAY 
SO 
YEAH WHERE ARE GOING TO WHERE ARE YOU ARE YOU GOING TO PLACE THEM 
YOU HAVE ENOUGH SURFACE 
YOU 
OKAY 
WHAT WILL BE THE AUTONOMY 
ROUGHLY 
THE AUTONOMY 
AUTONOMY 
UH I MEAN HOW LONG DOES I HOW HOW HOW LONG CAN TO BE HELD OFF A STATION 
YEAH 
A LONG 
YEAH SO IT'S 
IT'S USED ONLY WHEN YOU 
YEAH 
OF WEEKS 
RIGHT 
NEXT SLIDE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THIS REALLY SOUNDS VERY GOOD 
NOTHING ELSE TO ADD 
YEAH 
WELL IN FACT B BOTH WILL BE COULD BE USEFUL NAVIGATING THROUGH TELETEXT 
YEAH 
WOW 
VERY GOOD UH YEAH YOU TH YEAH 
BANANAS EVERYWHERE 
OKAY SO 
SO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH NOW EVALUATIONS 
SO YOUR SLIDES OR READY 
OH YOU'RE FOUR I THINK 
SO THIS IS IN WHICH ONE IS THIS ONE 
NUM NUMBER 
SO TO HAVE IN ORDER TO HAVE ENOUGH GRANULARITY IT'S IN ORDER TO HAVE ENOUGH GRANULARITY IN THE EVALUATION 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH SIX 
SO SEVEN 
SIX 
NO WAIT 
WHAT DO YOU SAY SEVEN 
FIVE 
OKAY SIX POINT FIVE 
HANDY 
SEVEN 
SO SEVEN SEVEN SIX 
SIX POINT FIVE 
FUNCTIONAL 
FOUR 
UH FOR A REMOTE CONTROL DOES UH HAVE ALL THE 
YOU COULD EXPECT 
YEAH 
SO IT'S UNIVERSAL BUT FOR T. V. S 
SO SO UH FOUR 
FIVE 
FOUR 
FOUR 
OKAY COOL 
COOL DEVICE 
YEAH 
SEVEN 
SIX 
PLUS SIX I SAY I SAID SEVEN 
SO IT'S SIX 
YEAH 
SEVEN 
SEVEN 
AND YOU 
OUTL YOU ARE NOT LIK OUTLIER 
SEVEN 
OKAY OKAY OKAY OKAY 
OF COURSE I'LL BUY THE BANANA 
WELL 
TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
CHIP 
YEAH SO THE TARGET PRICE IS FOR ALL EUROPE OR ONLY FOR RICH COUNTRIES 
IT'S MORE TARGETING U. K. OR 
SO THIS IS SELLING COSTS INTO PRODUCTION COSTS 
YEAH YEAH SURE 
UM 
FIVE 
WE SHOULD BE NICE IN YOUR 
IT'S KITSCH 
WELL DON'T FORGET WELL DON'T FOR DON'T FORGET WHO WE'RE TARGETING ALSO WHO ARE F F WHO ARE WH YEAH YOUNGST YOUNGST 
NO WELL YEAH I IF YOU WOULD BE YOUNG 
NOT TELLING THAT YOU ARE YOUNG 
LI LI LIKE A TEENAGER FOR INSTANCE 
OKAY YOU'RE YOU'RE CRAZY TEENAGER AND YOU LIKE FUN THINGS 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU WANT TO SHOW THE BEAUTIFUL BANANA YOU HAVE 
OKAY SO YOU SEE YOU GIVE UH YEAH YEAH I KNOW I KNOW 
SO YOU SAY TWO 
IF I D I SAY FIVE 
YOU SAY 
SO WHAT'S THE NEW QUESTION 
OH YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH THAT'S TWO DIFFERENT QUESTION 
UGLY 
I STICK TO FIVE 
WE WE HAVE SIX FIVE 
THERE IS WE ARE 
SIX FIVE FOUR 
YEAH 
SO 
SO AND LAST QUESTION WELL I CHANGE MY REM CHANGE MY REMOTE CONTROL FROM MANDO BANANA 
UM ZERO 
NO UH WE CAN'T 
SO NO 
WELL IF 
NO UH LET'S SAY I'LL PUT TWO 
IT'S FOR THE T. V. 
TWO THREE FIVE TWO THREE OF AND TWO 
SO IT'S OR 
YEAH THREE POINT FIVE 
NO NO YOU SAY FIVE UH IS THE OUTLIER 
OKAY JUST JUST DO A SOME 
WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD WE SHOULD UH HAVE A LOOK GLOBALLY GLOB 
YEAH 
SO MAYBE MAYBE WE WE CAN WE SHOULD STICK TO GENERAL FEELING 
WE CAN HAD UH HAVE A OUT OF THESE NUMBERS WHICH WHICH IS THAT WELL WE SHOULD GO FOR IT 
PROBLEM WITH CONNECTORS 
OKAY 
SO LET'S MOVE UH LET'S MOVE ON 
OKAY NOW NOW WE HAVE TO MM TO ESTIMATE UH THE COST OKAY 
SO I PREPARE AN EXCEL SH UH AN EXCEL SHEET 
UM WELL WE ARE GOING TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCTION COSTS 
WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BE BELOW TWELVE POINT FIVE 
SO I ALREADY UH PUT SOME UP SOME NUMBERS HERE OKAY 
WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH SO THIS IS THE NUMBER THE MM NUMBER OF COMPONENTS WE NEED FOR THIS THING 
SO IT APPEARS THAT THERE WERE THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T THOUGHT ABOUT 
UH AND ALSO THINGS THAT I UH I D I FORGOT TO UH TO PUT LIKE SOLAR CELLS 
OH YEAH FINALLY WE SAY NO 
OKAY SO LET'S LET'S GO LET'S GO LET GO THROUGH ALL THE LINES 
SO HAND DYNAMO 
THIS SOMETHING WE DIDN'T THOUGHT ABOUT 
BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY SO WE WE STICK TO BATTERY ONE 
NO KINETIC ALSO 
I DON'T I DON'T USE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KINETIC AND DYNAMO 
UH YOU HAVE TO UH OKAY I S USE KINETIC IS REALLY UH SHAKING THE BANANA 
CRAZY 
OKAY 
SO THIS BANANA IS FALLING 
LET'S GO AHEAD 
SO WE WE ST ONLY HAVE ONE FOR BATTERY 
UH THEN FOR ELECTRONICS UM SO I DIDN'T PUT ANYTHING FOR THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
NO SO WE HIN 
YEAH SO NO 
UH Y Y YOU THE COST IS INCREASING 
SO WE ARE 
THE BEEP 
THAT'S WHAT 
OKAY SO I'LL REMOVE IT 
SO 
SO DON'T WE NEED A 
OH THERE IS NO LISTING FOR OUR RADIO FREQUENCY THING 
SO 
YEAH MAYBE 
WE'LL SEE LATER 
OKAY SO ONE FOR THE CASE UM 
I PUT SINGLE CURVED 
BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO THINGS 
NO 
WELL 
WHAT A WHAT I IF I PUT IN HERE 
YEAH SO LET'S PUT IN HERE IN THE THEN INSTEAD OF SINGLE OKA ALL RIGHT 
SO WE STICK TO PLASTIC IT COST NOTHING 
NO IT'S IT IN 
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE 
WE'RE ALREADY AT ELEVEN 
OKAY SO I PUT RUBBER ON 
OKAY SO SPECIAL COLOUR YELLOW 
UH FOR THE INTERFACE WE HAVE 
WE HAVE THREE 
NO NO 
WE HAVE TWO SCROLL AND WE HAVE THREE PUSH BUTTONS 
AND 
NO IT'S ONE CHIP 
THIS IS JUST RADIO FREQUENCY 
TH THIS IS NO CHIP 
IT'S JUST 
YEAH 
NO 
JUST ONLY 
OKAY WE WE DIDN'T THINK A THOUGHT ABOUT UH INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTONS 
YEAH SO 
YEAH 
OKAY 
IS AN L. C. D. 
SO FAR WE HAVE ONE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS RIGHT 
OH 
WELL IN FACT COULD WE COULD NOT WE CONSIDER THIS BUTTON IS A BUTTON SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE UH NO 
THESE ARE THESE ARE FOR COLOURS CO AND SPECIAL FORMS SPECIAL COLOURS AND SPECIAL MATERIALS 
SO 
OKAY SO WE ARE OVER BUDGET 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO MAYBE IN FACT N WE HAVE TO PUT TWO HERE 
BECAUSE IT COST NOTHING 
EXACTLY EXACTLY SO WE HAVE MARGIN FOR THAT STUFF 
YEAH MAYBE 
OKAY GOOD 
WOAH 
EXCELLENT 
UM WE'LL INVEST IN R. AND D. 
YEAH 
AS WELL WE'RE UNDER THE THE THE COST 
SO WE CAN GO TO THROUGH IT PROJECT EVALUATION 
SORRY 
WHICH IS DIFFERENT 
WHICH IS DIFFERENT 
NONE OF US WILL BUY IT 
THIS IS A BATTERY 
THIS IS WHAT W WHICH YOU CAN MM 
IT DID YEAH 
EXTRA BATTERY YEAH 
EXAC 
WELL IN FACT I I DID NOT KNOW I DIDN'T KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY HERE 
IF UH IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OF WHAT WE CAN WE CAN SAY 
SO 
I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT 
WHAT THEY MEAN BY SATISFACTION UM AND FOR AND FOR EXAMPLE 
SHOULD TO BE MORE LIKE UM LIKE A STATUS OF 
OF THE THESE MEETINGS IN FACT 
YEAH WELL IN FACT UH WE WE USE A LITTLE BIT THE WHITE BOARD AND THE DIGITAL PEN NOT THAT MUCH 
OH YEAH IT'S REALLY CREATIVE 
YEAH 
YEAH MAYBE WE SHOULD GO THROUGH YEAH IN UH EVALUATION 
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD WE SHOULD DO A KINDA EVALUATION 
IN THE STREETS LIKE ASKING TO YOUNG PEOPLES WELL DO YOU LIKE TO HAVE A BANANA IS A REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
ANY ANY NEW IDEAS WE COULD UH WE COULD INVESTIGATE NEXT TIME 
DUNNO ORANGES 
HMM 
OKAY 
VERY GOOD 
SO 
WELL DONE 
I THINK WE WE CAN GO 
HM 
YEAH 
MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN HASSLE THE THE 
PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT TO TO MAKE A A REAL PROTOTYPE THAT WE CAN USE TO HIM TO TO EVALUATE 
OKAY SO THANKS VERY MUCH 
BYE 
OKAY SO WE CAN GO TO THE SLIDES 
YEAH 
NUMBER THREE 
UH NUMBER TWO SORRY 
SO FINAL DESIGN 
FINAL DESIGN 
OKAY SO 
MICHAEL YOU CAN GO AHEAD 
YOU CAN PULL OUT AT FIRST MAYBE 
OH 
AND WE WE DO HAVE ONE MORE FUNCTIONALITY 
IF YOU TAKE THE BANANA IS SUCH AND UH YOU PRESS THE TURBO BUTTON IS TO SWITCH ONS THE SWITCH ONS THE T. V. 
THE TURBO BUTTON 
ADDITIONAL BUTTON 
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT 
SO THEN THEN BOTH THE SCROLL BUTTONS THEY ARE FOR TELETEXT BROWSING 
AND YOU CAN TELE YEAH ONCE YOU PRESS THE TELETEXT BUTTON THEN THE SCROLL BUTTONS THEY ARE MORE FOR TELETEXT 
THEY ARE IN MORE FOR CHANNEL OR VOL VOLUME 
YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO IT ALWAYS MEANS WHATEVER THE RAYS GOES BY THEY THEY GET REFLECTED AND THEN YOU ARE HAVING A BETTER COVERAGE 
IT'S LIKE ANTENNAS 
AND FOR THE POWER SOURCE WE ARE HAVING SOLAR CELLS AND RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES AND THIS AND UH THE BASIS STATION IS GOING TO HAVE THE INPUT FROM THE MM POWER LINE FOR FOR CHARGING THE BATTERIES 
IT IS VERY LIGHT 
YEAH 
AND WE HAVE PUT THESE DIFFERENT COLOURS SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T MISTAKE THEM MISTAKE IT IS A BANANA 
OTHERWISE IT'S YOU KNOW A CHILD COMES AND SO 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
UH WE DIDN'T THINK OF THAT YET 
YEAH 
OH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
IT'LL IT'LL BE ALWAYS TO TAP SOMEWHERE OUT THERE 
YEAH BECAUSE NOW WE ARE HAVING RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES SO THAT THAT IS 
EIGHT TO TEN EIGHT TO TEN HOURS 
NO MOST IN MOST OF THE TIME IT'S NOT BEING USED 
SO WHEN WHEN YOU ARE MAKING IT IN 
MM 
MM-HMM 
NO EIGHT OR EIGHT OR TEN HOURS OF WORKING 
IF YOU ARE JUST LEAVING LIKE THAT IT'LL BE MUCH LONGER 
YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
AND WE ARE HAVING THE SPEAKERS REGULAR CHIP FOR CONTROL 
PRICING IS WAS A FACTOR SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE GONE FOR A REGULAR CHIP ONLY INTO THE ADVANCED CHIP 
AND UH THAT'S IT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS 
YOU ARE NOT CONVINCED 
NOT NOT MANY WE WE WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE 
SO THAT THIS BUTTON OF USE FOR TELETEXT WHICH IS USUALLY ALSO THE CASE 
THAT USUALLY THERE IS A TELETEXT BUTTON AND ONCE YOU PRESS THAT THE CHANNEL BUTTONS THEY BACO BECOME THE SCROLLING BUTTONS 
IT'S UP TO YOU MEANS 
NOW THAT 
MEANS LET'S SAY THIS THIS CAN MOVE THE THE LARGER DIGITS AND THIS CAN MOVE THE SMALLER DIGITS 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
SO THERE WAS THERE WAS A CONSTRAINT THAT THE SURFACE AREA WHICH WE HAVE ON THIS BANANA IN ONE SIDE BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE 
SO WE ARE TARGETING A SEGMENT WHICH IS WHICH IS JUST VERY TRENDY KIND OF THING THEY THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE BUTTONS ANY MORE 
AND ANYWAY 
EVALUA YEAH 
WHY THIS STRANGE FACTOR OF SEVEN 
USUALLY I HAVE SEEN THAT SCALES ARE FROM ONE TO TEN 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY FINE GOT THE IDEA 
OKAY 
OKAY OKAY GREAT 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
GO AHEAD 
MM-HMM 
SURE 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
SO YOU CAN SAY FANCY 
HANDY 
HANDY 
YEAH IT'S FANCY ACCORDING TO ME 
SEVEN 
SEVEN BY UM 
OKAY 
SO YOU CAN ADD SEVEN PLUS SIX PLUS SEVEN PLUS 
FIVE 
AGAIN I'LL GIVE SEVEN 
YEP 
SEVEN FOR ME 
I'LL GIVE FIVE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THE STANDARDS 
WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET OFF THE SHELF 
WE 
FIVE 
SO FOUR POINT TWO 
FOUR 
THERE I'LL GIVE IT SEVEN 
THAT'S RIGHT 
FOR A T. V. THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE WHICH I FELT WAS THE LOCATOR WHICH IS A COOL FEATURE 
AND THEN THE SCROLL BUTTONS ARE AGAIN COOL FEATURES 
WE DON'T HAVE L. C. D. FOR IT BUT 
THAT WE DECIDED WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE 
MM-HMM 
SEVEN 
OKAY 
DEFINITELY SEVEN 
OKAY 
I'LL SAY FIVE 
I'LL SAY FIVE 
WHY 
NO BUT IT'S REALLY HANDY ACTUALLY IF YOU SEE 
IT'S IT'S SO HANDY 
AND THEN 
ANYB ANYBODY WHO COMES HERE ANYBODY WHO COMES TO YOUR HOME HE'LL AT LEAST ASK ONCE WHAT IS THIS 
IT'S A VERY POSITIVE THING IF YOU SEE LIKE THAT 
YOUNGSTERS 
YOU WANT TO FLAUNT 
YOU WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND OR SOMETHING 
OR MIGHT BE IT DOES SOME OTHER KIND OF THING BUT 
OH YEAH CRAZY 
I SAY FIVE 
AND YOU HAVE SAVED IT 
YOU'LL HAVE TO RELOAD 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SO 
AND THEY THEY MIGHT NOT BE A S SAY SO THIS YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
I GO SLIGHTLY UP 
SIX 
SIX FIVE FOUR 
OKAY 
I'LL STILL GIVE IT FIVE 
YEAH 
SO IT'S SOMEWHERE THREE POINT FIVE I THINK 
NO I SAID FIVE 
MM-HMM 
OOPS 
YEAH IT'S IT'S FUNNY 
YEAH SURE 
MM-HMM 
SOLAR CELLS YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH WE SAID IN IT THAT 
I THINK RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES WILL TAKE CARE OF THE POWER THING 
YEAH 
TO BRING THE COST 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO WE HAVE THE REGULAR CHIP ON THE PRINT WHICH IS NO 
AND THAT'S IT 
AND WE HAVE SAMPLE SPEAKER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE COST OF THAT IS VERY HIGH 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND WE HAVE SAVE 
YEAH 
SO WE WE'LL PUT SOME EXTRAS IF THERE IS SOMETHING 
OKAY 
TO REDUCE THE COST IT'S OKAY 
UH IT'S GOT ALL THE DIRECTIONS SO DON'T WORRY 
IT'S GOT A DIRECTION 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT 
WE DON'T HAVE ANY PUSH BUTTONS 
NO THAT IS A SCROLL WHEEL ITSELF IT'LL BE PUT IN THAT 
OH OKAY OKAY 
OKAY OKAY 
YEAH 
NO 
THERE'S NO CHIP THERE 
IT JUST EMITS THE SIGNAL 
AND THE RECEIVER ACCEPTS IT AND THAT'S IT 
JUST SE SENDS THE SIGNAL THAT'S IT 
YEP 
NO 
YEAH 
SO FIRST THING WHICH WE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF US 
INSTEAD OF RUBBER LET IT BE PLASTIC 
AND UH THAT MUCH MONEY WILL BE REQUIRED FOR THE BASE STATION WHICH IS NOT THERE 
YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT 
SO MIGHT BE NINETY CENTIMES FOR THE THE REMAINING THINGS WHICH THE CARD AND EVERYTHING WHICH'LL GO 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
SO 
DETACHABLE BATTERY 
THEY LIKE THAT 
MM-HMM 
BIASED 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THE COST OF THE THING CAN BE MADE MORE THAN MIGHT BE 
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST THE OPTIMAL WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR THE COST WHICH WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD IT 
INTERFACE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
INTEGRATE 
MM-HMM 
SO 
WHAT ELSE 
OKAY 
HM 
HAPPILY SATISFIED 
MM-HMM 
THANK YOU 
WHAT THIS BUTTON FOR 
OKAY 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO TO PAGE SEVEN HUNDRED 
HOW MAN 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT 
CAN YOU REPEAT IT 
YEAH 
OH OKAY OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY OKAY 
OKAY 
I SEE 
I SEE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO IT REALLY WEIGHT 
SO IT LIGHT OR 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OK 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH I SEE 
I UNDER I UNDERSTAND 
HOW LONG THE HOW LONG THE ABOUT THE BATTERIES LONG 
I L YEAH 
I LIKE I LIKE IT 
MAYBE THE THE THING THAT CONVINCE ME THE LESS IS THE THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL BUTTONS 
LOOKS A BIT 
LOOKS A BIT PUZZLED UH I DUNNO HOW TO SAY THAT 
YOU THE THE B THE BUTTONS CHANGE UH UH OTHER FUNCTION DEPENDING IF YOU IT'S TELETEXT OR NOT 
AND THE VOLUME BUTTON WILL WILL BECOME 
AND WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE DIGITS 
BUTTO REAL BUTTONS 
OKAY 
BECAUSE HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT CONFIGURATION AND ALL THOSE KIND OF UH STUFF 
IT'S ALL AUTOMATIC 
OKAY 
OKAY YEAH IT'S FINE 
WE WE ARE LIVING IN A WONDERFUL WORLD 
AUTOMATICALLY CONFIGURE 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I I CONST I CONSTRUCTED A A LIST OF CRITERIA BASED ON THE ON THE GENERAL USER REQUIREMENTS 
AND EACH CRITERIA IS WILL BE EVALUATED IT'S UH LOGICAL CRITERIA SO WE MUST 
USERS MUST SAY I IF IT'S TRUE OR S OR IF IT'S FEELS IN A IN A SCALE RANGING FROM ZERO TO SEVEN 
BECAUSE I 
I'M SORRY 
SORRY 
OH YEAH 
IT'S FROM SORRY IT'S FROM ONE TO SEVEN 
IT'S FROM FROM ONE TO SEVEN SORRY 
BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE AN EVEN 
IT SHOULD BE AN EVEN UH SCALE AND FIVE 
SO TOO SHORT AND NON IS TOO LONG 
I'M A I I'M 
SORRY 
YEAH YEAH 
THE VARIANCE IS UM IT'S IS MINIMAL 
I'M UM ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION 
OKAY 
AND THAT'S THE CRITERIA I I FOUND MORE USEFUL 
I THINK I SH I I COULD WRITE THE CRITERIA ON THE ON THE WHITEBOARD 
AND WE ALL FOUR COULD RANGE 
COULD EVALUATE THE 
OKAY LET'S LET'S EVALUATE IF IT'S FANCY OR 
SEVEN BUT 
I WOULD SAY SEVEN 
IT'S QUITE FANCY 
SIX 
SIX 
I WOULD SAY 
EVERYTHING OR 
MM EVERYTHING 
IT'S COMPARED TO THE ALL 
REMOTE CONTROLS 
ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE THE OR THE REAL SPECIFICATION OF A OF A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTRO 
UH IT'S NOT AN UNIVER BUT IT'S FOR ALL KIND OF T. V. S 
YEAH 
FOUR 
FOUR 
SO FAR 
IT MEANS COOL FEATURES LIKE 
NEW FEATURES ACTUALLY 
I WOULD SAY FIVE 
YOU SAID SEVEN 
FIVE 
SORRY I HAVE THEM 
OF COUR OF COURSE THE MOST DIFFICULT QUESTION FOR THE END 
I FIND IT QUITE CHEAP ACTUALLY 
I DUNNO 
IF I I IT DEPENDS IF YOU LIVE IN IN SWITZERLAND OR YOU LIVE IN 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHA THE INITIAL SPECIFICATIONS WERE FOR THE WHOLE ALL EUROPE OR 
YEAH THIS IS THE THE INITIAL SPECIFICATIONS 
I WOULD SAY SIX 
IT'S QUITE CHEAP ACTUALLY 
ACTUALLY MAYBE 
YEAH 
I CHANGE THE QUESTION 
SO YEAH UPLOAD THE 
YEAH IT'S TWO DIFFERENT SITUATIONS 
IF YOU REALLY NEED AN UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL OR IF YOU 
WOULD CHANGE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL FOR A ONE FOR A NEW ONE 
SO 
WHAT NOW 
WHAT RANGE 
SIX 
SIX 
SIX 
SIX SO IT'S UH FIVE POINT FIVE OR LESS 
ACTUALLY YEAH I W 
FIVE 
YOU ARE ROMANTIC REALLY 
I WOULD SAY TWO 
WHO IS THE OUTLIER 
WH WH YOU SAID FIVE 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A 
NO BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE YEAH WE SHOULDN'T SUM LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE THE THE LAST TWO QUESTIONS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE REST ACTUALLY 
OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T WE WILL NOT SELL 
OH NO I DIDN'T ANYTHING 
YEAH THE UH 
YEAH 
DO YOU WANT ME TO SUM O I THINK IT'S NOT 
SO 
ACTUALLY WHAT'S THE DIFFEREN 
TOO EXPENSIVE 
ACTUALLY WHE WHE WHEN YOU WROTE REGULAR CHIP YOU SHOULD PUT TWO BECAUSE THERE IS ANOTHER CHIP HERE 
YEAH BUT 
YOU NEED 
IF I IT DOES NOTHING ACTUALLY 
OKAY SO NOW WE HAVE A PRODUCT WHICH NOBODY WOULD WOULD BUY 
WOULD YEAH WOULD BUY 
YEAH BECAUSE THE THE THE EVALUATION PROJECT 
UH WOULD BUY YEAH 
MASSIVELY YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH YOU HAVE BEEN IN MILAN A COUPLE OF TIMES SO 
AND YOU SAID THE LOWEST 
YEAH FOR THE BATTERIES 
MM-HMM 
SO MORE GENERAL REMOTE CONTROL INSTEAD OF JUST FOCUSING ON UH ON T. V. 
THE COMPLEXITY SHOULDN'T BE MUCH HIGHER 
FOR YOU SAID IF IT GOOD FOR D. V. D. THEN I WOULD 
BYE 
OH MY NAME'S BOB MOR 
OH SORRY 
'KAY 
SO MY NAME'S BOB MORRIS 
I'M THE MARKETING EXPERT FOR THIS PROJECT 
BOB YEAH 
YEAH GO AHEAD 
OKAY OKAY 
SO I THINK MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL WOULD BE A C A CAT 
THAT'S ITS HEAD 
UM I PROBABLY LIKE CATS THE MOST BECAUSE THEY'RE CUDDLY AND FURRY AND UH PLAYFUL 
OKAY 
THANKS 
MAYBE PUT IT UP PUT IT A MAYBE PUT IT IN THE DESK OR SOMETHING 
OH THAT'S BETTER 
YOUR LAPEL MICROPHONE'S FALLEN OFF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST CONTINUE 
YEAH DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT 
NO 
OH THAT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD 
YEAH AND STRONG 
WELL FROM EXPERIENCE UM I'VE HAD REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE PAST THAT HAVE HAD VERY THEY'VE HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF BUTTONS AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY SMALL 
AND IT'S BEEN VERY HARD TO TO TO USE 
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY BUTTONS AND YOU KNOW IT'S VERY HARD TO USE WHICH BUTTONS DO WHAT AND THE BUTTONS ARE VERY SMALL AND VERY HARD TO PRESS 
UM AND AND NORMALLY YOU ONLY VERY SO YOU KNOW IN A T. V. REMOTE YOU ONLY EVER SEE 
MOSTLY YOU KNOW IF FOR OUR F SIX BUTTONS 
UM 
SO IT'S FRUSTRATED ME ON THE PAST TH THAT 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY ONE 
SO THAT BECAUSE THE OF THE DISCRETE VOLUME LEVELS OR IS THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
HE'S THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
NO YOU'RE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST 
I. D. 
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
AND THEN LAST ONE'S MARKETING WHICH IS UM 
GREAT OKAY 
THANKS GUYS 
BYE 
'KAY HELLO EVERYBODY 
UH I GUESS YOU ALL KNOW WHAT IS IT BUT YOU ALL RECEIVED THE EMAIL I GUESS 
UH WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING THIS MEETING TO START A NEW PROJECT WHICH IS ABOUT DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO I'M GOING TO BE THE PROJECT MANAGER OF THIS UH PROJECT 
AND UH SO I'M PRESENT MYSELF 
I'M FABIEN CARDINAUX AND UH I I GUESS YOU CAN PRESENT YOURSELF 
SO I DUNNO YOU CAN STARTS

AND YOU ARE 
IN THE PROJECT 
SO UH SO TODAY WE ARE DOING A SHORT MEETING TO PRESENT THE PROJECT IS UM 
WE ARE GOODING WE ARE GOING TO PRESENT THE TOOL WE ARE WE ARE GOING TO USE DURING ALL THIS PROJECT 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PROJECT PLAN AND WE ARE GOING TO TO DISCUSS ABOUT ST OUR FIRST IDEAS AND SO ON AND YEAH 
SO WE HAVE AROUND TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO DO THIS MEETING 
UM 
SO WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT 
SO TO DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IT SHOULD BE OF COURSE NOW AND ORIGINAL AND UM IT SHOULD BE TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY 
THAT MEAN IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING PROJECT AND UH 
OH 
SO W IT'S WE WILL TRY TO DO OUR BEST AND HOPEFULLY COME WITH SOMETHING VERY NEW AND THAT 
PEOPLE WANT TO BUY 
SO UM 
SO WHAT'S UH WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO DURING THIS ALL THIS PROJECT 
SO IT'S MORE LIKE WE ARE GOING TO DO INV INDIVIDUAL WORK ALL IN O ONE O OUR SPECIALITIES AND WE ARE GOING TO MEET EACH OTHER QUITE OFTEN TO DISCUSS AND TO FIND A GOOD WAY 
UM 
YEAH AND EVERYTHING IS WILL BE LIKE THIS 
UM SO NOW WE ARE GOING TO TO GET USED TO TO TO THE TOOLS WE ARE GOING TO USE ALL DURING ALL THIS PROJECT 
SO WE CAN TRY TO USE UH THE WHITEBOARD HERE 
SO UH 
FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN TRY TO WRITE WHAT IS OUR OUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND WRITE THE OF OUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS ABOUT IT 
MM 
OH 
SO UH 
SO I WILL ASK YOU ALL TO DO THE SAME 
JUST TO GET USED TO THE WHITEBOARD 
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN DRAW THE PICTURE OF COURSE 
OH 
NEVER MIND 
YEAH 
NO WORRY 
YOU CAN DRAW IT IF YOU WANT 
GOOD 
SO GOOD UM SO LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY 
UH WE ARE GOING TO TO SELL WE WANT TO SELL UH THIS REMOTE CONTROL FOR TWENTY FIVE OR OR 
AND UH OUR EXPECTED PROFIT WILL BE AROUND FIFTY MILLION EURO 
AND UH WE ARE TRYING TO TO HAVE A MARKET ALL AROUND THE WORLD 
SO N NOT ONLY FOR SWITZERLAND BUT FOR THE WORLD 
OH 
SO UM 
THE WE EXPECT A PRODUCTION COST OF MAXIMUM 
UH TWELVE POINT FIFTY EURO 
YEAH OF COURSE 
UM SO WE CAN START TODAY TO HAVE A FIRST IDEA OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO WHAT OUR OUR EXPERIMENTS WITH REMOTE CONTROL AND ANY IDEA 
SO IF YOU HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE GOOD OR BAD WITH REMOTE CONTROLS YOU CAN SHARE IT AND SAY WHAT YOU IF WHAT IS YOUR IDEA 
ANYTHING 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OR YOU NOT AFRAID THAT IF YOU TAKE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL YOU CAN MOVE THE SLIDE AND IT COULD THE THE VOLUME CAN GO UP VERY QUICKLY AND IT CAN 
YEAH ALSO IF YOU WHEN YOU TAKE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE IN THE TABLE 
YOU TAKE IT AND YOU PUSH THE BUTTON AND EVERYTHING IS VERY OLD AND 
YOU HAVE A HEART ATTACK 
OKAY 
YEAH SO YOU CAN DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH WITHOUT OBSTACLES AND 
OKAY 
LET'S CONTINUE 
I HAVE A MEETING IN FIVE MINUTES SO MAYBE WE SHOULD HURRY 
UM 
SO WE WILL CLOSE UH THIS MEETING 
SO WE WILL HAVE A NEXT MEETING IN UH THIRTY MINUTES 
UM 
OH 
THE SO I WILL ASK YOU TO DO SOME WORK 
UH THE THE INTERFACE INTERFACE DEVELOPER WILL WORK ON THE ON THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL START TO TO HAVE NEW IDEA AND 
RED BUT YEAH 
OH 
INDUSTRY AND UH 
YEAH 
SO UM 
FOR THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER WHICH IS HAMED UM 
UH YOU ARE GOING TO WORK ON THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND FOR THE MARKETING UH 
MANAGER I DUNNO OKAY WHICH IS BOB UH 
YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO TO FIND THE USER REQUIREMENTS OF UH FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM YOU WILL RECEIVE BY EMAIL UH THE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS AND UH BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH 
YEP FINISHED 
SO I SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES 
THANK YOU 
MY NAME IS HAMED GETABDAR AND UH I'M GOING TO BE INTERFACE DESIGNER IN THIS PROJECT 
I DUNNO IF I SHOULD GO WITH THIS 
IF IT IS ENOUGH LINE 
I'M SORRY 
OKAY 
THEY SHOULD BE REMOTE 
OKAY THANKS 
NO 
OKAY 
SHOULD I CLEAN 
OKAY I THINK LIKE HORSES UH BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL SO IF I WANT TO WRITE IT HERE I THINK I CAN 
OH 
OKAY 
I DUNNO IF I CAN 
OKAY 
IT MAY BE LIKE A COW OR I DUNNO WHATEVER 
I'M NOT GOOD VERY GOOD IN DRAWING 
OKAY SO THIS IS VERY IT'S A BIRD I THINK 
I DUNNO WHAT IS IT 
FOUR 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
I'M SHAMEFUL YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
UH I YEAH JUST A SIMPLE EXPERIENCE 
I UH I PREFER UM REMOTE CONTROL WORKING WITH RADIO WAVES 
BECAUSE REMOTE CONTROL WORKING WITH INFRA RED RAYS YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD KEEP IT IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTION AND THEN TRY TO HARD TO TEN 
MM 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY THANKS 
BYE 
NOW WHAT 
OKAY SO MY NAME IS PETRE 
YOU CAN CALL ME PETRE OR PETER IF YOU LOOK 
I DON'T CARE 
UH IN THE PROJECT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE TECHNIC 
BOB OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO PROBABLY I WOULD TRY TO TRY TO DRAW THE ANIMAL 
WELL SHE SHOULD I DRAW THE PICTURE OF THE ANIMAL 
I I TH I THINK I SHOULD 
OKAY SO 
UM 
OKAY AMERICAN UM 
UM 
I WOULD USE THE BOARD 
SO I TRIED TO SKETCH IT IT 
I HAD TO FIRST UH WRITE IT DOWN BECAUSE I AM NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE IF I CAN DRAW IT BUT UH 
CAN YOU RECOGNISE IT IS A BIRD 
OKAY IT'S YOUR TURN IT 
UH IT'S OKAY 
YEAH 
I SHOULD GET USED TO THE TOOL SO 
UH JUST WAIT A LITTLE BIT 
COU COULD WE PUT IT HERE TO MAKE IT AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE 
UH PROBABLY NOT 
OKAY IT IT WORKS LIKE THIS 
OR YOU LEFT HANDED 
OH PITY 
UH IT'S MAYBE BETTER IF YOU LEAVE IT 
YOU WON'T DRAW THEM OR 
JUST TRY 
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW IT LOOKS LIKE 
NO I THINK IT'S CLEAR 
IT'S OKAY 
IT'S NO IT'S INDEED BEAUTIFUL 
OKAY 
BOB 
HAVE TO REMEMBER IT 
BOB 
PER UNIT I GUESS 
YOU UH OKAY 
OKAY 
OH 
OKAY I HAVE ALSO SOME POINTS UH 
MAYBE TWO POINTS 
UH FIRST WOULD BE THAT IN CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS THERE IS ONE BACK LIGHT 
SO IF YOU ARE IF YOU ARE UH PLAYING WITH THIS IN THE DARK ROOM IT'S IT'S PROBABLY WORTH IT TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE UH BACK LIGHT 
AND MAYBE IT COULD BE ALSO DEPENDANT ON THE THE AMOUNT OF OF LIGHT ON THE ROOM 
SO THAT IF IF IT'S IN THE DAY IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE BACK LIGHTED BECAUSE IT WORKS ON THE BATTERY SO 
SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
AND THE SECOND THING F SECOND POINT FROM ME WOULD BE THAT IN A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL THERE IS UH THERE ARE TWO BUTTONS FOR VOLUME CONTROL 
BUT I PREFER LIKE A POTENTIAL METER OR SOMETHING LIKE 
YOU KNOW SOME SLIDER OR NOT JUST TWO DISCRETE BUTTONS FOR VOLUME BUT SOMETHING WHICH 
YEAH BUT I CAN REACH AN UH ONE SECOND I CAN MEET IT DOWN OR OR MAKE A HIGH VOLUME 
OH NO 
IF IT DROPS TO THE FLOOR THEN IT STARTS TO SCREAM 
YEAH IF IT DEPENDS WHAT WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
YEAH BUT WE CAN WE CAN THINK OF THESE THINGS AFTERWARDS BUT IF YOU HAVE SOME MORE NOTES ON THAT 
OKAY 
UM 
OKAY JUST A SECOND 
WHICH I WHICH IS HAMED 
OKAY 
UH I AM THE TECHNICAL DESIGNER I DUNNO WHICH ONE UH V 
USER INTERF OKAY 
OKAY SO I'M THE FIRST ONE 
I SEE 
SIGN 
OKAY 
OH 
OKAY CAN I HAVE THE LAPTOP OVER HERE OR 
OKAY 
HAVE TO GET UP 
EXCUSE ME 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO BASICALLY I'M GONNA PRESENT SOME FINDINGS OF A STUDY WE CONDUCTED UH NOT UH WHAT USERS WANT IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
UM SO FIRST OF ALL WE WHAT WE DID SO WE UM CONDUCTED A AN EXPERIMENT WITH A HUNDRED TEST SUBJECTS 
UM WE PUT THEM IN A ONE OR UM USABILITY LABORATORY AND GET THEM TO YOU KNOW UM PLAY WITH REMOTE CONTROLS AND ALSO TO COMPLETE 
AFTER THEY'D DONE THAT TO COMPLETE A QUESTIONNAIRE UH TO TELL US WHAT THEY LOOK AND WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE ONE REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO BASICALLY UM THE MAJOR THINGS WE FIND IT WAS THAT UM BASICALLY USERS DON'T LIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF OF MOST REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE MARKET 
UM THEY YOU KNOW SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WE WE UH DID THE EXPERIMENTS ON 
FIND THAT REM REMOTE THE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT THEY'D USED IN THE PAST WERE UGLY 
COMPLETELY UGLY 
UM THEY THEY DIDN'T MATCH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER THAT AS YOU KNOW THE THE WAY USERS USE REMOTE CONTROLS WHEN THEY'RE WATCHING T. V. 
UM THAT THE LAYOUT OF THE REMOTE CONTROLS DIDN'T MATCH THEY WAY THAT THEY SAID IT 
UM AND 
THIRDLY THEY SAY THAT WE HALF OF THE USERS THAT WE UM TESTED SAID THAT THEY ONLY USED TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS THAT UH OR ONE REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM SO WE COLLECT WE ALSO SOME COLLECTED SOME USAGE STATISTICS UH BASED ON HOW THESE TEST SUBJECTS WERE USING THEIR REMOTE CONTROL 
AND FROM THIS WE BASICALLY CAME UP WITH THE FIGURE THAT 
THE CHANNEL BUTTONS THE CHANNEL SELECTION BUTTONS ARE THE MOST BY FOR THE MOST USED BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM AND YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE USED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES PER HOUR AN AVERAGE UM WHILE THE USER'S WATCHING T. V. 
UM THE CLOSEST BUTTON THAT WAS SAID WELL THE CL THE BUTTON THAT WAS SAID THAT WAS CLOSEST TO THE CHANNEL BUTTON WAS THE TELETEXT BUTTON 
UM WHICH WAS USED FOURTEEN TIMES PER HOUR FOLLOWED BY THE VOLUME BUTTON WHICH WAS FOUR TIMES PER HOUR UM 
ALL THE OTHER ALL THE OTHER UM BUTTONS SUCH AS CH UM AUDIO AND PICTURE SELECTION UM CONFIGURATION BUTTONS AND THINGS WERE USED 
YOU KNOW L APPROX WELL LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO ONE TIMES PER HOUR 
UM WE ALSO ASKED USERS UM WHICH BUTTONS HAD THE MOST IMPORTANCE TO THEM 
YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH BUTTONS THEY FELT WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND BASICALLY THEY CAME THEY SAID THE CHANNEL VOLUME AND POWER BUTTONS HAD THE HIGHEST RELEVANCE TO USERS UM NOT THAT ONLY POWER WAS VERY INFREQUENTLY USED 
IT ONLY HAD A B A A FR USAGE FREQUENCY OF ABOUT ONE TIMES PER HOUR BUT USERS RANKED IT IS HAVING A VERY VERY HIGH RELEVANCE 
UM AND THE AUDIO AND PICTURE SETTINGS HAD A VERY THAT WELL THE USERS THOUGHT THAT UM W THE AUDIO AND PICTURE SETTINGS WERE VERY UH WEREN'T VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM UM 
AND THEY USED THEM VERY INFREQUENTLY A AS WELL 
SO WE ASKED USERS WHAT WHAT UM FRUSTRATES THEM THE MOST ABOUT UM CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND 
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE USERS SAID THAT UH WHAT FRUSTRATES THEM IS LOSING THE REMOTE CONTROL UM SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND OUT 
UM THEY ALSO SAID THAT IT UM IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO LEARN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S MANY BUTTONS AND IT'S A YOU KNOW A C A A UNINTUITIVE INTERFACE 
UM AND THEN THIRDLY 
THEY SOME USERS COMMENTED ON THE FACT THAT THE THE YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE TO HOLD AND PRESS BUTTONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL OR OR BAD AND UM CAUSE U REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
WE ALSO ASKED SOME USERS ABOUT SOME SPECIFIC FEATURES THAT THEY'D LIKE IT IS IN THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
NO PARTICULAR DO THEY WANT AN L. C. D. AUDIO DISPLAY AND SECONDLY DO THEY THINK SPEECH RECOGNITION UH AS A USEFUL FEATURE TO HAVE IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
UM BASICALLY OUR FINDINGS ARE THAT UM AMONGST A YOUNGER AGE GROUPS UH THE ANSWER IS UMV OVERWHELMINGLY YES 
THEY WANT THESE FEATURES THEY WANT THIS HIGH TECHNOLOGY FEATURES 
UM FOR INSTANCE NINETY ONE PERCENT OF UP OF PEOPLE AGED BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE SAID YES THEY WANT THESE FEATURES 
WHEREAS UM THE THE TREND WAS SE SERIES AS USERS UM BECAME OLDER AND OLDER UH THEY WERE LESS LIKELY TO WANT THESE SORT OF FEATURES IN A UM IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHERE WE'RE FOCUSING OUR OUR MARKET 
UM AND SO OUR COMPANY MOTTO IS PUTTING FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
UM I THINK WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE YOUNGER YOUNGER UM TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC 
AND SO MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT ADDING THESE SORT OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY FEATURES INTO OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT'S MY DIC THAT'S MY PRESENTATION 
THANK YOU 
YEAH IT'S TRUE BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE FEATURES THAT USERS WANT 
SO IT'S AND OUR PRODUCTION COST OF TWELVE FIFTY EUROS PER PER UNIT IS FAIRLY HIGH I THINK 
SO I THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO TO ADD THESE SORT OF FEATURES INTO OUR REMOTE 
IT IS TRUE 
THAT'S THE WRONG ONE I THINK 
OKAY 
I HAVE A QUESTION 
DO YOU THINK RADIO WAVES UM WILL INTERFERE WITH OTHER APPLIANCES IN THE HOME 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
ARE WE UM ARE WE PLANNING TO TAKE ON OFF THE SHELF AN A. A. M. COMPONENT FOR THE RADIO WAVE CIRCUIT 
OR ARE WE PLANNING TO CONSTRUCT OUR OWN CIRCUIT BOARD 
OKAY SO 
SO WE JUST BUY A CIRCUIT BOARD AND OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WHAT HOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE 
ARE WE TALKING THREE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE 
OR TEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE 
OR 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S STILL A LOT 
I THINK IT'S IT'S PROBABLY NOT WORTH SPENDING THE EXTRA MONEY 
BECAUSE I MEAN ALL THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE MARKET HAVE INFRA RED IS PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING OTHER THAN INFRA RED 
SO IT'S NOT WORTH SPENDING THE EXTRA MONEY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK BASED ON MY USABILITY STUDIES I TH I FEEL THAT USERS ARE PRIORITISE THE LOOK AND THE FILE AND THE TRENDINESS ABOVE 
YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFRA RED OR RADIO WAVES 
SO I THINK WE'RE BETTER OFF SPENDING MONEY ON THE USABILITY PHASE 
OKAY 
MM 
WELL SHOULD WE START WITH JUST THE CORE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS THAT WE NEED 
AND THEN WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES 
OKAY WELL I MEAN THE OBVIOUS ONE IS CHANGING CHANNELS 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH I 
OH YEAH 
TO HAVE SOME FEEDBACK 
YEAH 
WE COULD MAYBE ALSO C UM INCORPORATE PETRE'S IDEA OF THE UM SLIDER FOR THE VOLUME WITH THE CHANNEL 
SO WE C YOU COULD QUICKLY JUST THROUGH MANY CHANNELS 
FOR THE CHANNELS PERHAPS 
SO WE'VE GOT CHANNEL AND VOLUME 
UM 
I THINK SO 
I THINK BASICALLY THE CORE FUNCTIONS WE WANT AND THEN MORE ADVANCED ONES 
YEAH 
I DON'T 
UH I DON'T BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE WE'RE THE ONES 
I MEAN THIS REMOTE CONTROL WE'RE DEVELOPING IS A GENERIC CONTROL FOR ALL T. V. S I THINK 
OKAY 
BUT THEN YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY TOO COMPLICATED TO THE SAME TIME 
I MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS WE CAN ALWAYS HAVE THESE L LESS OFTEN USED FUNCTIONS HIDDEN SOMEWHERE UNDER A COVER OR AT THE BACK OF UNDER A SLIDE OR SOME 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT 
UM 
SO I THINK SO THE SETTINGS WE TH WE ARE AGREEING ARE AGREED THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED 
IT'S JUST HOW TO A 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OH OKAY WHAT ELSE 
I MEAN A POWER BUTTON'S OBVIOUSLY 
UH REQUIRED 
UH WELL I THINK WHEN THEY SAY POWER BUTTON THEY MEAN TO TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF 
BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. FOR TWO HOURS YOU DON'T WANT YOUR T. V. TO TURN OFF AFTER FIVE FIVE MINUTE 
I MEAN BASED ON OUR USABILITY STUDIES AGAIN UM UP UM PEOPLE SAID THAT THE POWER BUTTON WAS V A VERY RELEVANT BUTTON 
UM YOU KNOW IT WAS NINE OUT OF TEN 
RE RELEVANCE 
OKAY 
BE OKAY 
I THINK WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON THE YOU KNOW THE MAJOR USAGE OF THE THE OF THE CONTROL WHICH IS YOU SIT DOWN 
YOU TURN ON YOUR T. V. YOU CHANGE CHANNELS YOU CHANGE THE VOLUME YOU TURN THE T. V. OFF 
UM AND ALL THE THREE OF FUNCTIONALITY IS 
NOT USED VERY OFTEN 
YEAH 
I THINK A BUTTON 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE A B 
ITS OWN BUTTON ON THE FRONT 
OKAY 
SO 
WHAT ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE CLOCK AND UM TIMERS 
UH UM YOU KNOW SOME FUNC SOME FEATURES IN THE CONTROL TO DISPLAY A TIME OR IT TO DISPLAY 
PROBABLY NOT 
IT'S A QUESTI YEAH IT'S A TRADE OFF 
'KAY 
OKAY SIMPLE 
VERY YEAH OKAY VERY OCCASIONALLY 
BUT I DO IS THE I DO IS THE DISPLAY OF THE TIME QUITE OFTEN BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S OKAY THAT'S TRUE 
OKAY SO IN TIME BUTTON 
OKAY 
OKAY COOL 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
SO UM NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
OH 
SO UH 
TOD UH FOR THIS MEETING I WILL TAKE THE NOTES AND DO THE MINUTES 
UH SO WE WILL USE OR THREE PRESENTATIONS 
UM WE WILL START WITH THE UH MANAGER EXPERT WI WHO WILL TALK ABOUT UH USER RE REQUIREMENTS WHATS USER NEEDS AND WHAT IT DESIRE FOR THIS DEVI DEVICE 
YEP 
UH I DON'T THINK SO 
I THINK YOU HAVE TO COME HERE 
I DUNNO 
I THINK IT SHOULD STAY 
SHOULD STAY IN THE SQUARE HERE 
UH MAYBE 
UH YOU CAN PUT IT HERE 
OH THAT'S OKAY IT'S JUS 
HMM 
THANK YOU 
SO UM 
MAYBE NOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT A USER INTERFACE AND UH ABOUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION OF THIS DEVICE 
SO UH PET PETER CAN YOU TALK SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT 
NO 
OH 
SORRY I'M SORRY 
SORRY 
YEAH IT'S STILL BOB MORRIS 
YEAH YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT YES 
CLICK ON YES 
YEAH 
SO CAN WE USE ANY ANY FREQUENCY 
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE ANY FREQUENCY 
OKAY 
AND WHAT HAPPEN WITH UH RADIO WAVES WHEN TWO NEIGHBOURS HAVE THE SAME HAVE OUR REMOTE CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE 
AND SO DO THEY HAVE THE SAME FREQUENCY OR 
OKAY 
A KIND OF IDENTIFICATION OKAY 
SO 
YEAH 
SO 
OKAY 
HMM 
OKAY 
SO MAYBE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE FUNCTION AND 
OPEN 
SLIDE SHOW 
IT SHOULD WORK SO YOU CAN 
MM 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE THE PRICE IT WOULD BE OUT OF RANGE 
OR IT WOULD BE MAYBE FEASIBLE 
OKAY 
MM 
WHY 
BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLER 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
IT'S A A PRICE MATTER 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I UH 
IN THE OTHER SIDE WE WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING NEW 
YOU KNOW WHERE 
WE WANT IT 
TO HAVE SOMETHING NEW AND SO W I THINK WE SHOULD STILL THINKING ABOUT IT 
BUT MAYBE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY THANK YOU PETER 
SO UM I HAVE TO INFORM YOU I RECEIVE AN EMAIL FROM THE MANAGEMENT BON BOARD TODAY AND THEY HAVE NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM 
FIRST UM THEY SAY THAT'S UH ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT IT TELETEXT 
UH APPARENTLY IT BECOMES FROM ACCORDING TO THEM IT BECOMES OUT OF DATA 
OUT DATED 
AND UH 
BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET POPULARITY AND EVERYBODY HAS INTERNET AT HOME AND 
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT USEFUL TO HAVE TELETEXT 
UM 
SO I THINK WE CAN AVOID THE TELETEXT 
UM THE SECOND THING IS UH 
THEY SUGGEST THAT THAT WE SHOULD UH IS THE REMOTE CONTROL ONLY FOR T. V. NOT FOR D. V. D. AND OTHER DEVICES 
BECAUSE IT MAKE IT IT MAKES IT'S TOO COMPLEX AND UH BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT MUCH TIME FOR THIS PROJECT WE SHOULD STAY ON T. V. ON THE ONLY SPECIFIC T. V. REMOTE CONTROL 
THE THIRD THE THIRD ONE IS UH ABOUT THE THE THE IMAGE OF THE COMPANY 
SO UM UH WE SHOULD WE SHOULD KEEP UH THE THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECOGNISABLE 
UH UH 
IT'S THAT MEAN WE SHOULD USE THE COLOUR OF OUR COMPANY AND MAYBE PUT SOMEWHERE THE USE THE SLOGAN OF THE COMPANY 
WHICH IS UH WE PUT FASHION OF IN ELECTRONICS 
SO WHEN PEOPLE USE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL THEY SHOULD SAY UH IT'S FROM REAL REACTION AND UH SO THEY SHOULD RECOGNISE THE COMPANY 
SO UM 
SO NOW WE WE SHOULD TAKE THE DECISION WHAT WE ARE GOING TO WHAT FUNCTION WE WILL HAVE ON THIS UH IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
SO MM ARE WE GOING TO USE L. C. D. SPEECH RECOGNITION 
OH 
YEAH 
MAYBE MAYBE 
YEAH BUT FIRST MAYBE WHAT IS WHAT ARE THE USUAL FUNCTION OF A STANDARD REMOTE CONTROL 
I MEAN 
WHAT DO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK WE SHOULD STICK ON VERY USEFUL FUNCTIONS BECAUSE WE WANT LESS BUTTON 
SO YEAH 
SO TURNING CHANNEL OF COURSE 
VOLUME SETTING 
YEAH 
I THINK IT WOULD BE A B 
YEAH 
IN THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE MORE AND MORE CHANNELS AND IF YOU WANT TO PASS THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS TO GET THE CHANNEL YOU WANT IT'S 
MAYBE MAYBE WE COULD THINK OF SOMETHING MORE BETWEENS LIKE 
OH 
YEAH 
MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OH 
MAYBE UH I DON'T KNOW 
OH 
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE KEY BUTTONS LIKE UH DISCOVERY CHANNE LIKE DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL AND MOVIES CHANNEL AND 
AND INSIDE THIS THIS THING YOU CAN MOVE MAYBE SWITCH 
IF YOU WANT TO USE A MOVIE YOU CLICK ON THE MOVIE BUTTON SO YOU HAVE ALL THE MOVIE CHANNELS AND AFTER YOU'VE YOU PLUS PLUS PLUS 
I IT JUST AN IDEA 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT BUT 
YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
ANYTHING ELSE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WHAT ABOUT THE SETTINGS OF THE T. V. 
BECAUSE IT'S BUTTON WE DON'T USE VERY OFTEN BUT 
IT'S WE NEED TO ANYWAY 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO TO WATCH SOMETHING ON T. V. 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THE SETTINGS 
BECAUSE SETTINGS IF WE WANT TO AUDIO SETTINGS WE NEED BUTTONS FOR THAT AND WE WANT LESS BUTTONS SO 
MAYBE WITH THE L. C. D. WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH LESS BUTTONS BUT 
MM 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
UH THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE SHOULD HIDE THEM SOMEWHERE 
IN THE MEANS OF THE L. C. D. OR IN THE BACK OF THE REMOTE CONTROL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IT'S IT'S A KIND OF SETTING I THINK 
IT SHOULD FIT IN THESE SETTINGS FUNCTIONS 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A VERY CURRENT USEFUL FUNCTION 
NO I THINK IT'S AFTER AFTER FIVE MINUTES OR SOMETHING A TIMER I I THINK ONE 
OH OKAY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO SO YEAH 
YEAH 
IN THE BACK OR 
FOR WHAT 
UH UH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH A BUTTON YEAH I GUESS SO 
SO ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS OR FUNCTIONS 
YEAH WE HAVE STILL IN OUR TWO MINUTES TO TALK YEAH 
USUALLY IT'S ALREADY ON T. V. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IF WE IF WE DID THE TIME WE HAVE TO HAVE MAYBE A BIGGER DISPLAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO IT VERY USEFUL 
I MEAN OUR USERS WANTS TO HAVE THE TIME IN THE ON THE REMOTE 
THIS IS THE QUESTION 
SO IT USEFUL 
W IN MY OPINION WE SHOULD HAVE ONLY USEFUL THING AND BECAUSE APPARENTLY THEY WANT THE SIMPLER IT'S IS BETTER 
NO TIME ON 
I THINK 
YEAH 
SO MAYBE WE THINK WE CAN THINK MORE ABOUT THAT AND DISCUSS THAT MAYBE LAST TIME NEXT TIME 
AND UH YEAH NOW THE MEETING ROOM IS BUSY 
SOMEBODY BOOKED THE MEETING ROOM JUST FOR IT IN P. M. AND SO WE SHOULD LEAVE 
OH 
SO UM 
SO NOW WE ARE GOING FOR FOR A SMALL LUNCH 
IT'S UH FUNDED BY THE COMPANY 
AND UH AFTER WE HAVE UH THIRTEEN MINUTES TO TO DO INDEVEL INDIVIDUAL WORKS 
AND UH I WILL DO THE MINUTES 
AND UH 
YOU ARE GOING TO WORK ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL WORKS 
AND UH YOU WILL RECEIVE AS USUAL YOUR SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION AND SO NO 
THANK YOU EVERYBODY 
OKAY 
B YOU THINK UH I I'M USER INTERFACE MANAGER 
OKAY 
OKAY 
IF I COULD GO THERE WITH THIS CABLE 
SH OKAY 
WHERE'S DELETE BUTTON 
OKAY 
UH I'M SORRY 
OKAY 
OH 
PRESENTATION THREE 
OH 
OKAY SO HERE IS MY PRESENTATION ABOUT TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN 
I WILL TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AND EASE OF SYSTEM AND HOW THEY REACT TOGETHER 
OKAY UH FIRST WHAT IS A REMOTE CONTROL 
SIMPLY IT'S A DEVICE SO YOU KNOW FOR UH 
FOR SENDING SOME COMMANDS BY SOME WAVES TO UH ANOTHER DEVICE TO TO TELL DIFFERENT COMMANDS UH WITH THIS DEVICE 
AND THE MAIN IDEA WE DON'T SEE ANY CABLE AND WE CAN REC REACT SIMPLER WITH THE DEVICE 
UH I IT HAS DIFFERENT BLOCKS DIFFERENT BLOCKS 
UH FIRST IS REMOTE CONTROL HAVE SH UH SHOULD HAVE SOME ELECTRIC CIRCUITS UH MAKING INTERFACE WITH UH KEYBOARD AND UH R READING UH KEYBOARD AND READING THE KEYBOARD UH COMMANDS 
AND THEN INTER THEN MAKE UH THESE KEYBOARD COMMANDS UH IN INTERPRET THESE INTO UH KEYBOARD COMMANDS 
AND THEN THERE SHOULD BE UH AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT MAKING UH ELECTRONIC SIGNALS ACCORDING TO THESE COMMANDS AND UH FINALLY THERE IS A TRANSMITTER WHICH IS A CORD OR A A DIODE MAKING UH MAKING UH WAVES TO TRANSMIT THROUGH THE R AND UH UH THESE ARE THESE UH WAVE UH WILL BE RECEIVED BY THE BY THE OTHER DEVICE LIKE A TELEVISION OR WHATEVER 
IT UH OR TO REALISE THE COMMAND 
OKAY UH ABOUT WHAT I FOUND ABOUT UH DIFFERENT UH THESE DIFFERENT BLOCKS ARE UH USUALLY THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT METHODS UH IT FOR DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL 
THEY ARE BASED ON INFRA RED UH WAVES OR UH UH RADIO WAVES 
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT UH UH SOLUTIONS I MEAN 
THIS IS UH THIS CAN BE UH UH THE THE DIFFERENCES THE THE BETWEEN DIFFERENT KIND OF WAVES INFRA RED OR RADIO WAVES 
AND UH ALSO SO UH I UNDERSTOOD AND UH I THINK IT WAS A PART OF UH BOB 
UH UH PRESENTATION PEOPLE PREFER TO HAVE UH TO HAVE UH THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH LESS BUTTON 
SO FOR THE ELECTRONIC PART WORKING AND INTERFACING WITH BUTTON 
WE SHOULD WE SHOULD TRY TO TO TRY TO DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROL HAVING UH SOME SOME SIMPLER BUTTONS ARE SOME ROLLING BUTTONS TO JUST TO JUST TO SEARCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT OPTIONS 
AND SHOWING O SOMETHING ON T. V. AND PUTTING LESS LESSER STUFF ON THE UH IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
UH UH UH UH CERTAINLY A REMOTE CONTROL WITH UH WORKING WITH RADIO WAVES IS UH PREFERRED BECAUSE UH YOU CAN PR YOU CAN TAKE IT IN ANY DIRECTION AND YOU DON'T NEED TO TUNE IT ANY WAY 
AND UH UH AGAIN USING BIGGER BUTTONS AND LESS NUMBER OF BUTTONS ARE ALSO PREFERRED AS I SEE 
OKAY 
THAT WAS MY PRESENTATION 
UH-HUH 
UH I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE UH WE CAN MAKE UH WE C WE CAN MAKE THIS WAVE IN A SPECIFIC FREQUENCY 
SO THEY CAN BE IN A RANGE WHICH IS NOT INTER INTERFERING WITH THE WITH OTHER DEVICES INSIDE THE HOME 
OH NO BUT SO I KNOW THERE IS A RANGE FOR UH FOR THIS UH F FOR FOR UH FOR THIS STUFF FOR DESIGNING THIS CIRCUIT 
WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN TUNE OUR UH TRANSMITTER TO WORK ON THIS RANGE AND FOR THIS RANGE WE DON'T NEED TO ASK ANY PERMISSION 
UH FOR THIS I'M NOT UH I I DON'T KNOW THE SOLUTION BUT ONE SOLUTION CAN BE SOMETHING LIKE PUTTING UH P PASSWORD OR SOMETHING INSIDE THE WAVE 
SO THE ONLY YOUR T. V. CAN UNDERSTAND IT YEAH IDENTIFICATION CODE INSIDE THE 
THE PASSWORD MAY SIMPLY UH OUR UH I IDENTIFICATION CODE MAY SIMPLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM 
A SPECIFIC UH REMOTE CONTROL HAS A SPECIFIC F 
MM 
MM-HMM 
FIVE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YES 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH AT LEAST NINE TEN BUTTON 
OR 
OR SOMETHING 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
LIKE CATEGORISING CHANNELS 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO UH WE DON'T HAVE ANY UH WE DON'T HAVE UH WE SHOULD JUST DESIGN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WE SH WE DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO THE AT THE T. V. DESIGN OR WE CAN CHANGE SOME DESIGN 
BECAUSE ONE SOLUTION FOR THIS UM UH UH CH CHANGING CHANNELS IS IT IS A SUMMARY OF ALL CHANNELS 
SOME SOME PREVIEW OF ALL CHANNELS AND THEN YOU CAN YEAH 
YEAH B NOT IN THE CONTROL IN THE SCREEN ON THE T. V. SCREEN 
AND THEN 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
SETTINGS 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THEY CAN YEAH THEY CAN BE HIDE SOMEWHERE BY A COVER OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
LIKE COVERING CU 
YEAH LIKE MOBILE PHONE COVERING 
A BUTTON IS BETTER 
YEAH 
MM 
CLICK OR 
YES 
MM 
MM 
YES 
MM 
AND UH DO WE NEED TO INCLUDE ANYTHING ABOUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND THE SPEECH COMMANDS OR 
I I THIN I THINK IT WILL NOT TAKE LOTS OF PLACE WE JUST NEED A MICROPHONE AND THE SOFTWARE 
SO AND IT SH AND IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT NEW AND INTERESTING 
SO PEOPLE MAY BE ATTRACTED TO BUY THIS STUFF AND IT'S NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO UH PUT A SOFTWARE INSIDE THE THE ELECTRONIC DEVICE AND PUT A MICROPHONE 
IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT MUCH PLACE AND ALSO THAT MUCH IT DOESN'T COST THAT MUCH 
MM-HMM 
THANKS 
YEAH THAT'S IT 
WELL OKAY YEAH 
YEAH BUT THE USER USER INTERFACE IS RESPONSIBLE 
OKAY SO 
YOU'RE SCARING ME WITH L. C. D. MENU 
AND SPEECH RECOGNITION IN REMOTE INTO IT WILL BE VERY E EXPENSIVE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AT LEAST WE HAVE COUPLE OF MONTHS TO TO WORK ON IT IS IS IT WILL BE CHEAPER FINALLY 
BECAUSE YOU CANCELLED IT 
YEAH 
YEP 
YOU STILL WANT UM THE PRESENTATION 
YEAH IT SHOULD BE OKAY 
YEAH OF UH I KNOW ABOUT THIS SINCE IT'S MY IT'S EXACTLY MY FIELD SO 
IT'S UH KIND OF HANDSHAKING UH 
WHEN STARTING TO UH WHEN YOU START TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE YOUR T. V. THEN THEN IT'S LIKE AN HANDSHAKING PROTOCOL WITH YOUR YOUR REMOTE 
SO EASE OF TWO TWO DEVICES ARE TRYING TO GO TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE T. V. SET THEN THE THE THE ONE WHICH HAS THE MORE ENERGY IN THE WAVE IS CHOSEN 
WELL IT CAN BE A PROBLEM SOMETIMES BUT MOST OF THE TIME IT WORKS OKAY 
YEAH BUT WE WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK UH ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I THINK IS A FUNCTION DESIGNER THAT WE WILL USE THE ALREADY MADE UH CIRCUITS WHICH WE PROBABLY BE BY 
IT'S WORTH TO BUY 
AND THEY HAVE THESE PROBLEMS SOLVED SO 
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS 
YES 
I HAVE ONLY A COUPLE OF THINGS BECAUSE I HAD I STRUGGLED A BIT WITH THE SOFTWARE THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO USE IN THIS UH 
OH 
NO THIS COMPANY 
I WAS USED TO USE LINUX BEFORE SO 
BUT I TRIED IT 
TRIED TO BREAK THROUGH THIS IT I GUESS 
MM 
OH 
OKAY 
HOW TO MAKE IT BIG 
SLIDE SHOW 
OKAY THANKS 
OKAY 
UH SO I WILL SPEAK ABOUT WORKING DESIGN 
THAT'S THE FIRST SLIDE 
UH WHAT UH I HAVE TO DO 
A LOOK AT WHAT THE OTHER COMPANY OKAY SO UH PRESENTLY I AM LOOKING WHAT IS POSSIBLE TO USE 
WHAT CIRCUITS TO USE AND STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE UH I DIDN'T WORK UH WITH THIS UH CIRCUITS SO FAR AS I HAVE TO LIKE WHAT WHAT IS A V A V AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET FOR FOR THE COMMUNICATION FOR THE U. R. CIRCUITS AND SO NO 
SO I'M CURRENTLY LOOKING WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE WEB 
AND UH I WANTED TO ASK YOU M MAYBE AFTERWARDS AFTER AFTER OUR DISCUSSION IF WE HAVE SOME CONTACTS IN SOME COMPANIES 
SO WHICH CAN REPORT ON WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS I WOULD BE GLAD IF YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT THEM 
SO YOU KNOW 
OH OKAY FINDINGS THAT'S THE POINT THAT I'M WORKING ON CURRENTLY BUT UH AS FAR I I WAS UH LOOKING WHAT WHAT ARE THE BLUE CIRCUIT 
I MEAN RADIO WAVE RADIO FREQUENCY CIRCUITS ARE AVAILABLE NOW BUT THE PRICES I READ ARE HIGH 
SO 
I KNOW THAT UH THE USER INTERFACE PEOPLE AND THESE SPEAK ABOUT RADIO FREQUENCY WAVES BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN UH YOU CAN MAKE THE T. V. DO WHAT YOU WANT EVEN IF YOU ARE IN THE BATHROOM OR IS NO 
BUT YOU KNOW 
WHEN YOU ARE NOT CLOSE TO THE T. V. YOU PROBABLY WON'T NEED TO TO CHANGE THE PROGRAM AND SO ON AND SO I AM I AM VOTING FOR US TO STICK TO THE UM INFRA RED CONTROL INSTEAD OF R. W. BUT WE WILL DISCUSS IT LATER MAYBE 
OH 
COMPONENTS TO SEE I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT I WILL USE FOR THE DESIGN OF THE CIRCUIT 
IT DEPENDS UH ON WHETHER WE WILL USE THE L. C. D. AND MAINLY THE SPEECH RECOGNITION BECAUSE THE SPEECH REC YEAH 
NO NO NO NO NO 
THIS W THIS WE BUY I THINK BECAUSE IT'S RATHER CHEAP NOWADAYS AND IT'S NOT WORTH TO CONSTRUCT OURSELVES 
EXACTLY 
BUT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE CIRCUIT WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
THIS I PREFER THAT WE SHOULD MAKE OURSELVES 
BUT IT DEPENDS WHETHER WE TAKE A DECISION TO USE IT 
SAME THING 
IT'S FAIRLY EXPENSIVE TO USE THESE CIRCUITS 
SO SPEECH RECOGNITION WELL L. C. D. IT'S OKAY BECAUSE IT'S COMMON NOWADAYS TO USE L. C. D. S I AGREE ON USING ANY KIND OF L. C. D. 
LESS BUTTONS GOOD FOR ME IS A AS A DESIGNER OF THE CIRCUIT 
BUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION WE HAVE TO COMPARE WHETHER THE PRICE AND THE WHAT DOES IT OFFER YOU KNOW 
YEAH I'M 
OH 
I WAS NOT THINKING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE PRICE 
BUT IF WE USE THE L. C. D. UH EVEN THE RADIO FREQUENCY COMMUNICATION WITH THE T. V. SET AND THE BACKLIGHT AND UH RELATED THINGS LIKE THE PHOTO DIODES AND STUFF 
IT SHOULD BE OKAY 
IF WE DECIDE TO USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN WE PROBABLY COULD STRUGGLE BUT WE'LL SEE AFTERWARDS 
IT DEPENDS IF YOU IF IF THE M. A. OR U. I. D. 
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE NAMES I DON'T REALLY KNOW UH WANT TO HAVE TO LOOK IN METAL OR IN PLASTIC 
THESE THINGS 
IT IT DEPENDS ON YOU NOT BECAUSE THE THE THE ELECTRONIC DEVICE'S PRICE IS NOT NOT SO BIG IN COMPARISON TO TO THE OVERALL SHAPE AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
SO 
WE WILL DISCUSS IT AFTERWARDS 
UH THIS IS NOTHING 
THIS IS JUST MY NOTES ON WHAT IT IS 
AND UH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS YES I WOULD LIKE ALSO PREFERABLY TO USE R. W. CIRCUIT 
BUT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW UH OF THE DESIGN AND PRICE I WOULD STICK TO A. R. S 
THAT'S MY OPINION 
UH I MEAN IF INFRA RED UH CIRCUIT NOT NOT THE RADIO FREQUENCY 
BECAUSE BECAUSE THE THE RANGE WHERE YOU CAN USE IT AS FAR 
IT'S OKAY I THINK 
AND THE PRICE IS FAIRLY CHEAP FOR THIS 
WELL DEPENDS 
JUS JUST THE PRICE 
OTHERWISE I DON'T CARE WHAT I PUT THEIR BECAUSE IT'S THE CHIP WHICH I BUY OUR WHICH WE BUY 
SO I I I THINK IT'S O Y O 
WELL THERE IT THERE AT FIVE 
NO NOT TEN TIMES BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT WHAT WE 
YEAH 
TH THEY ARE USED TO USE IT WHEN THEY CAN USE THE T. V. S I DON'T KNOW 
YOU THE USER INTERFACE AND MANAGEMENT MAN UH 
OH OKAY THAT'S IT FOR ME 
'KAY 
I AGREE 
OKAY SO THE AVAILABLE THINGS ARE L. C. D. THE BUTTONS AND EVERYTHING 
UH RADIO FREQUENCY DEPENDS 
AND WELL THE RECOGNITION IT DEPENDS ON YOU GUYS 
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY SPEAK 
OKAY 
UH JUST N NOT AT THE CHAN CHANNEL CHANGING 
DO WE WILL WE USE ONLY TWO BUTTONS OR OR LIKE NUMBERED BUTTONS 
I MEAN THOSE NINE PLUS ONE OR TWO 
BECAUSE IT'S MANY BUTTONS AND WE WERE SPEAKING ABOUT LOWERING THE NUMBER 
OKAY SO SO WE KEEP ALL THESE ALL THESE BUTTONS 
LIKE TEN PLUS FIVE PLUS ONE PLUS ONE MINUS OR SOMETHING 
ARE USING THE NAMES AND THE KEYBOARD I DUNNO 
YOU MEAN LIKE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE 
OKAY SO SO UH SORRY 
SO IT REQUIRES THE EASE OF L. C. D. PROBABLY IT TO TELL YOU 
OKAY SO I'LL MAKE A NOT AN L. C. D. 
YEAH 
LIKE ROLLER FOR THE YEAH 
OKAY 
SO WE ARE STILL S SPEAKING ABOUT THE COMMON DEVICES ARE WE ARE INVITING THE NEW ONE 
IN THE SCREEN YOU MEAN 
NOT IN THE CONTROL BUT IN THE SCREEN 
WELL THIS WOULD AVOID L. C. D. THEN 
OH 
W I I THINK IT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TO STICK TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AND NOT TO BOTHER THE T. V. TO TO TO PRINT THESE THINGS 
WELL IT W IT WILL BE STILL MORE EXPENSIVE BUT FOR THE L. C. D. AND THIS STUFF IS NO PROBLEM IN THE PRICE 
TWO T. V. S 
LIKE UM 
WE WE COULD HAVE FOR EXAMPLE TWO BUTTONS LIKE SIMPLE MODE AND ADVANCED MODE 
OR I DUNNO 
OR LIKE CHILDREN AND GRANDFATHER'S MODE AND THE WELL THE THE USER 
NOT THE USER THE MAN MANA T. V. MANAGER MODE 
UH I DUNNO 
OH 
YEAH 
HIDE THEM OKAY 
UM 
YES 
THIS I WAS THINKING 
DO WE NEED A POWER BUTTON AT ALL 
SHOULD SHOULD SHOULDN'T WE DO IT LIKE SLEEP MODE AFTER FIVE MINUTES OF NOT USING IT 
BECAUSE GENERALLY 
YES 
WELL I I UH 
YOU DON'T NEED TO EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO KEEP IT ALIVE 
UH PROBABLY 
OKAY SO WE SHOULD KEEP THIS BUTTON 
OKAY SO WE WE COULD P WHAT WE COULD PROBABLY DO IS TO KEEP ALSO TO KEEP UH KEEP THE L. C. D. AND ALL THE BUTTONS AND STUFF 
WE COULD MAKE IT LIKE A OPENING OPENING STYLE THAT IF YOU OPEN IT YOU ARE YOU JUST TURN ON THE T. V. AND IF YOU CLOSE TO TO WELL 
TURN OFF THE T. V. 
IF IF YOU LIKE THIS 
BECAUSE WELL IT'S MAYBE QUESTION FOR YOU IT 
YEAH 
I MEAN LIKE THE 
YEAH BUT SINCE WE HAVE THE L. C. D. WE DIDN'T AND TOO MUCH BUTTON TOO MANY BUTTONS 
UM OKAY JUST UM THE DECISION OF THE POWER BUTTON 
SHOULD WE MAKE IT A BUTTON OR SOME SOME SOMETHING WHICH WOULD BE 
UH POWER BUTTON 
IF IT IF IT'S A BUTTON OR OKAY 
OKAY ONE NICE BIG BUTTON 
OLD FASHIONED BUTTON TO SATISFY THE GRANDMOTHERS 
HMM 
MM 
DO WE STILL HAVE THE TIME 
I I JUST WONDER 
OKAY 
OH 
WELL WHAT WE WHAT WAS THE QUESTION 
YEAH BUT SINCE WE WANT TO CONTROL ALL THE TELEVISIONS 
AND AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE WORTH IT TO SET THE TIMING ON THE REMOTE IN 
BECAUSE OF OF THE T. V. TURNS ON ITSELF IT WILL YOU KNOW IF THE TIME THE TIMER SHOULD BE THERE 
OH YEAH 
DID YOU DID YOU EVER USE THE LIKE THE TIMING OF TURNING ON THE T. V. WELL AND BASED ON YOUR 
YEAH BUT IT CAN BE IN THE DISPLAY ON ON A CORNER ALL THE TIME IN THE REMOTE 
YES YES 
YEAH BUT WE WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE BATTERY LIFE THEN 
IF WE USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
YEAH 
HELLO 
OKAY 
OKAY I'LL START 
CAN YOU OPEN MY PRESENTATION PLEASE 
I'M NUMBER FOUR 
TREND 
YEP 
CAN YOU PASS THE MOUSE PLEASE 
OH OKAY THAT'S FINE 
OKAY 
UM SO BASICALLY I JUST WANT TO PRESENTED TO YOU PRESENT IT YOU SOME RECENT RESULTS WE'VE HAD FROM UM LOOKING AT UH UM SOME REMOTE CONTROL MARKET RESEARCH AND SOME FASHION TRENDS AROUND THE WORLD 
UM 
THE FASHION TRENDS WE GOT FROM TALKING TO OUR OUR CONTACTS IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY BASED IN PARIS AND MILAN 
UM SO F FROM OUR MARKET RESEARCH BASICALLY WE'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
UM AS OPPOSED TO A FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY 
UM FANCY IS IS IS IS THE YOU KNOW HIGHEST PRIORITY 
SECONDLY UM THAT OUR REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS TO BE TECHN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
UM SO THIS IS IT NUMBER TWO PRIORITY BUT IT'S TWO TIMES LESS IMPORTANT IS THE FANCY CRITERIA 
UM AND THIRD THIRDLY THE EASINESS OF US IS IS THE UM SO AS IMPORTANT AS WELL 
BUT AGAIN TWO TIMES LESS IMPORTANT IS THE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVENESS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
FROM OUR OF FASHION PEOPLE IN PARIS AND MILAN 
UM WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT THIS YEAR UM FRUIT THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE MOTIF WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN IN CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE 
SO I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT OUR REMOTE CONTROL FITS INTO THE FURNITURE CATEGORY 
AND ALSO UM THE FEEL OF MATERIAL THIS YEAR UM IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY 
UM SO HOPEFULLY OUR REMOTE CONTROL REFLECTS THAT IS IN SOME WAY 
UH SORT OF UM SQUISHY 
UM 
YEAH SOFT LIKE A UH LIKE A SPONGE 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
UM SO IN CONCLUSION WE NEED A R REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY FANCY UM HAS LOTS OF TECHNOLOG TECH TECHNOLOGY IN IT 
UM SOMEHOW WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE TO RELATED TO FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WITH A SPONGY FEEL 
AND THAT IT'S EASY TO USE AND FROM OUR LAST MEETING ARE YOU KNOW FABIAN TOLD US THAT WE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IS THAT WE HAVE TO REFLECT THE LOOK AND FEEL OF OUR OF THE THE REAL REACTION COMPANY 
UM 
THAT'S IT 
LESS IMPORTANT 
SO UM FANCINESS FIRST AND THEN TWO TO YOU KNOW HALF AS IMPORTANT IS THAT IS TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY AND HALF IMPORTANT AS TECHNOLOGY IS EASY TO USE 
INCH 
SO 
SO 
C 
CAN I ASK A QUESTION 
THIS SEVEN INCH T. F. T. SCREEN HOW BIG IS IT IN REALITY 
SO LIKE THAT 
THAT'S QUITE BIG 
UH UH HAVE WE DECIDED THAT WE'RE GONNA USE THIS T. F. T. SCREEN 
BUT I MEAN EVEN EVEN THAT IS LIKE THIS BIG 
YEAH 
YOU CAN CUT THE T. F. T. SCREEN 
OKAY SO 
OKAY 
SO WHAT'S THE SIZE OF THE DEVICE 
EVEN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SEVEN TO SEVEN CENTIMETRES BY SEVEN CENTIMETRES IS STILL 
SO IT CAN YOU HOLD THAT ARE 
YEAH A SMALL C CONTROL THAT THEY CAN HOLD IN HAND 
BUT IS SOMETHING THAT'S SEVEN CENTIMETRES SQUARE E EASY TO HOLD 
OKAY 
SO IF WE USE USE SOLAR CELLS UM WHERE IS THE SUN IF SOMEONE'S WATCHING T. V. INSIDE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
IT'S IT'S QUITE INNOVATIVE YES 
AND IF YOU WATCH T. V. OUTSIDE IT'S VERY USEFUL 
WHICH IS THE SAME AREA 
COULD YOU ARE COULD YOU REDESIGN YOUR BIRD 
OH FIVE FIVE CENTIMETRES BY TEN CENTIMETRES 
YEAH 
MM TOUCH SCREEN 
SO 
WELL IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY THE OBVIOUS CHOICE WITH THE COLOUR OF OUR COMPANY 
I MEAN WHAT OTHER WHAT OTHER FRUIT AND VEGETABLES DO YOU KNOW IF ANY ANY OTHER FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THAT ARE YELLOW 
WELL 
I'D LIKE A SHAPED SCREEN 
I THINK THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN SAVING A BIT OF MONEY ON ON THE T. F. T. SCREEN 
YEAH BANANA'S GOOD 
OKAY 
I THINK IF WE IF WE HAVE A SPONGY LAYER ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BANANA THEN IT'S EASY TO MAKE THAT 
YOU KNOW TO MANIPULATE THAT TO HAVE BE A COVER THAT YOU CAN PULL OFF AND 
I THINK FOR SURE 
DEFINITELY 
THE SOFTER THE BETTER 
YEAH 
WE COULD USE VELCRO 
OR UH M MAYBE A MAGNETIC 
THING 
YEAH I IMAGINE SOME SORT OF VINYL THING 
IN A IN A SORT OF A WITH A SUEDE SORT OF FEEL 
MAYBE 
MM 
SO YOU'RE SAYING IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A SOLAR CELL AND THIS REMOVABLE COVER AND 
AND A AND A BANANA 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT 
I THINK ONE OF OUR P PRIORITIES IS TECH TECHNOLOGY 
AND 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
HELLO UH THIS MEETING WE ARE IT'S F SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UM THE GOAL OF THIS MEETING IS TO REACH A DECISION AT THE END ON THE CONCEPT AND I THINK THE LAST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT IN A LOT AND WE HAD A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING TO BE 
BUT UH IN THE AT THE END OF THIS MEETING WE HAVE TO TO REACH A DECISION 
SO UH 
WE WILL HAVE AGAIN THREE PRESENTATION FROM ALL OF YOU AND UH I HOPE IT WILL BE FAST BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE TIME IT 
FOR LONG DISCUSSION AND 
AND DECISIONS 
SO WHO WANTS TO START 
OKAY 
SO START UH 
OH 
THIS ONE 
TURN 
HMM 
OKAY 
LIKE A SPONGE 
YEAH 
YEAH UH YEAH 
EASY TO USE IS IT UH 
A AS MUCH AS IMPORTANT THAN TECHNOLOGY OR FANCY THING 
IT'S LESS IMPORTANT RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
SO HAMED CAN YOU 
MM-HMM 
UM 
NUMBER 
THERE 
THIS ONE 
SO IT'S NOT THIS ONE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THIS ONE YEAH 
OH 
OOPS 
CAN YOU FIT ANY UH FOR EXAMPLE A T. F. T. OR ANY ELECTRONIC DEVICE IN A SPONGY THING OR IS THERE ANY PROBLEM FOR THAT 
FOR EXAMPLE PUT ELECTRONIC CARD IN A SPONGY THING I CAN I CAN IMAGINE IT COULD BE A PROBLEM 
YEP 
OKAY 
SO 
OKAY 
MAYBE PUT ELECTRONIC IN A BOX AND A SPONGY THING AROUND 
MAYBE AFTER 
YEAH 
NO I DON'T THINK IT'S SEVEN BY SEVEN I THINK IT'S SEVEN THE DIAGONAL IS SEVEN 
USUALLY WHEN THEY SAY SEVEN INCH I THINK IT'S THE DIAGONAL 
YEAH 
I DUNNO I DON I DONE IN EACH 
BUT YEAH 
LET'S GO 
SO LET'S CUT THE T. F. T. 
MM 
THESE TECHNICAL ENGINEERS HUH 
WHAT USER WANTS 
HE WANTS A SMALL REMOTE CONTROL OR 
UH UH WITH BIG BUTTONS 
IT'S DIFFICULT 
A SOME 
SO MAYBE YOU CAN FINISH YOUR PRESENTATION AND AFTERWARDS WE WILL DISCUSS ABOUT ALL THIS 
THAT'S IT 
OKAY 
SO 
NO 
UH SO I THINK WE HAVE A LOT WE HAVE TO TAKE DECISION TODAY 
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO DO SOME WORK TO FINALISE OUR AUDIO AND TAKE DECISIONS 
UH FIRST I THINK ENERGY IT'S A KEY PROBLEM BECAUSE UH IT DEPEND WHAT CAN WE HAVE AS FEATURE IF WE USE ONLY BATTERIES 
FOR EXAMPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE CAN WE HAVE L. C. D. AND SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH BATTERY AND IT'S ALSO R RELATED TO THE SIZE OF THE OF THE DEVI OF THE DEVICE 
OKAY 
SO OKAY 
UH LIKE ABOUT SEEING HOW MANY BATTERIES FOR EXAMPLE 
OR OR WHAT MAYBE WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE BATTERY 
OKAY 
UH ONE TWO 
OKAY 
THE TELEVISION LIGHTS 
AT LEAST WHEN THERE IS T. V. YOU CAN GET LIGHT FROM THE T. V. 
I DUNNO 
OKAY 
MM 
AT LEAST IT'S NOW AND MAYBE TECHNOLOGY NEW TECHNOLOGY 
YEAH 
UM 
SO I THINK BEFORE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER THING IT'S IMPORTANT THING IT'S THE CASE 
UH WHAT WHAT ARE GONNA BE THE SIZE BECAUSE ITS WEIGHT DRIVES THE OTHER WHAT WE ARE GOING TO USE AS FEATURES AND SO NO 
FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE FOR THE L. C. D. IF WE CHOOSE TO HAVE A SMALL DEVICE WE CANNOT USE THIS UM A SUCH A A A SCREEN 
OH 
I'VE I SEE I THINK THE EASIEST THING WOULD BE TO TO HAVE A SMALLER L. C. D. IF IT'S POSSIBLE 
OKAY 
SO WE ARE AGREE WITH A SMALL 
L. C. D. 
YEAH 
TACTILE OR SOMETHING YEAH 
TOUCH SCREEN YEAH 
YEAH 
THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A LIMIT IN A MONTH OF TIME SO WE CANNOT DO SOMETHING VERY NOW 
SO LET'S GO FOR A SMALL L. C. D. 
YEAH OKAY 
SO FIVE BY USE TEN 
UM SO WHAT ABOUT IS THE CASE WE TALKED ABOUT 
UM SOMETHING EASY TO SEE YOU SAID SOMETHING EASY TO USE BUT HOW DOES THAT FIT IN A FASHION WAY LIKE WITH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE 
AND ABOUT THE COLOUR AND LOGO OF THE OF THE COMPANY AND SO ONE NOW CAN WE DO THAT 
MY FIRST IDEA IS BECAUSE 
OR COLOUR IS MORE YELLOW AND THE IT SHOULD BE EASY TO TAKE IN A HAND 
I THOUGHT ABOUT BANANA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH IS FRUITS AND 
A BIG BANANA 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT IT'S JUST AN IDEA 
I DUNNO WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ABOUT 
YEAH 
I DUNNO IF IT CAN FIT WITH THE TECHNOLOGY 
YOU ARE THE SPECIALISTS OF THAT 
SO 
YEAH AND 
THE SCREEN HAS TO BE SQUARE 
OR IT CAN BE LIKE A A SHAPE QUITE UH WITH CURVES 
IT COULD 
YEAH 
OKAY OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH IT SHOULD REMEMBER BANANA BUT IT'S NOT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TO BE UH UH REALLY THE SIZE AND EXACTLY THE SHAPE OF A BANANA 
SO WE ARE AGREE WITH THE BANANA THING 
OKAY 
SO THE LAST POINT WE DECIDED IT'S INFRA RED I GUESS 
EVERYBODY'S AGREED 
UH SO THAT'S IT I THINK ABOUT THE CONCEPTS 
YOU HAVE OTHER THING TO ADD TO THIS POINT OR UH NO 
SO UH ABOUT THE USER INTERFACE SO WE ARE GOING TO USE L. C. D. 
IN THE LAST MEETING WE TALKED ABOUT UH HIDDEN BUTTONS 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WITH THAT 
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE BUTTONS ON THE SIDE 
MM WHAT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND YOU MEAN THE FIRST LAYER WOULD BE SPONGY 
SO SO IT IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO THAT 
IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA ABOUT IS IT POSSIBLE TECHNICALLY 
LIKE DOING A SPONGY LAYER OF THE BANANA AND YOU OPEN IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT DO YOU SEE THAT IS A 
RIGID THING OR LIKE LIKE A BANANA SOMETHING VERY SOFT YOU CAN OPEN LIKE BANANA OR 
YEAH 
SO I DUNNO WHAT YOU THINK BOB BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR USERS I THINK AND VERY GOOD FOR MARKETING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
AND SETTING BUTTONS 
HIDDEN IN 
MM OTHER REMARKS OR SOMETHING OR 
SOMETHING WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT YES YET OR 
I THINK 
WE ARE ALMOST THERE 
UH MAYBE HOW CAN WE IF WE HAVE A SOFT THING 
LIKE THIS AND IT OPEN IT WE HAVE TO ATTACH IT SOMEWHERE I DUNNO HOW TO DO THAT TECHNICALLY OR 
AND HOW 
YEAH MAYBE 
MA MAGNETIC UH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
AND WHAT WOULD BE THE MATTER HERE OF THE FIRST LAYER I MEAN 
MM 
LOOKS 
SOFT PLASTIC OR 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
HMM 
AND SOMETHING WE FORGOT MAYBE UH ABOUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM OR WE GOING TO USE IT OR NOT 
IT I YEAH IT SEEMS FEASIBLE AND IT WOULD BE SOMETHING VERY GREAT 
SO WE HAVE THE D DESIGN THE A GOOD SHAPE NOW AND SO ON AND WE HAVE ALSO THE TECHNOLOGY THING WE WILL BE 
AND EVEN THE EASY TO USE THING IS IT WILL BE PERFECT 
SO WE DID ALSO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION DEVICE 
SO THAT GREAT 
WE HAVE DECIDED EVERYTHING 
AND THINK WE ARE IN A GOOD WAY 
SO UM 
UH THE NEXT MEETING WILL START IN THIRTY MINUTES 
UM SO UH THE THE INDUSTRIAL MANAGER UH WELL UH WILL WORK ON THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN 
THE USER INTERFACE UH UH MENU UH MANAGER WILL WORK ON THE USER INTERFACE DEVICE 
AND THE THE MARKETING EXPERT WILL DO THE FIRST PROJECT EVALUATION 
SO I HOPE YOU CAN DO THAT IN THIRTY MINUTES 
AND UH YEAH I 
UH I THINK YOU SHOULD WORK TOGETHER SO YOU UH HAMED AND PETER TO WORK UH IN A IN A FIRST PROTOTYPE AND UH 
MORE ABOUT THE SHAPE AND SO ON AND HOW YOU CAN MANAGE TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER 
AND UM AS USUAL YOU WILL RECEIVE SOME SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ON 
SO THANK YOU ALL EVERYBODY AND SO YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES 
HELLO 
I SEE 
NO NO YOU YOU CAN START 
YEAH 
THE SECOND ONE 
COULD YOU PLEASE SHOW THE PRESENTATION NUMBER THREE 
YEAH 
THERE 
YES 
JUST COULD YOU PLEASE CHECK IF IT IS THE FIRST ONE OR THE SECOND 
OH NO NO NO IT'S THE FIRST ONE 
THE SECOND ONE 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THIS REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE APPEAR TO BE MORE EASY TO USE 
I THINK UH I THINK THE FEATURE EASY TO USE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING FANCY BUT OKAY WE CAN DISCUSS ABOUT IT UH LATER 
UM GENERALLY GENERALLY UH THIS REMOTE CONTROL UH UH SHOULD BE SHOULD BE SOMETHING 
IN MY OPINION UH THE FIRST FEATURE IS JUST TO BE EASY TO USE 
SO THE MORE FREQUENT BUTTONS SHOULD BE LARGER THEY SHOULD BE PLACED IN A GOOD POSITION UH UH INSIDE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND UH SO UH I CAN CONCLUDE LIKE THIS THAT WE SHOULDN'T NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT 
IT SHOULD BE WE SHOULDN'T NEED TO USE OPEN A A T BOOK AND UH START READING AND UH LEARNING HOW TO USE THIS UH THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
SO WHAT I FOUND OUT THAT UH SO I SAID UH I THINK IT'S BETTER TO PUT UH MORE FREQUENT UH UH UH K UH BUTTONS WHICH ARE USED MORE ON THE MIDDLE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THEY SHOULD BE BIGGER IN SIZE 
UH THE SHAPE OF REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE IN A WAY WHICH CAN WHICH SHOULD BE TAKEN EASILY IN HAND 
IT SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETELY LIKE UH A CUBE 
IT SHOULD BE IT SHOULD HAVE ROUND EDGE SO UH THEN IT'S EASIER 
AND MAYBE UH JUST LIKE SOME TOYS SOME JOYSTICK WHICH IS EASIER TO TAKE INSIDE THE HAND 
AND UH ALSO F UH UH UM BECAUSE BECAUSE CUSTOMERS DOESN'T LIKE TO BUY LOTS OF BATTERY IT SHOULD NOT UH CONSUME LOTS OF ENERGY 
OKAY 
AND MY PERSONAL P UH PREFERENCE IS UH SO I SAID 
UH JUST PUTTING THESE BUTTONS ON A SPECIAL PLACES AND COVERED SOME BUTTONS WHICH ARE NOT USED UH THAT MUCH LIKE SETTINGS BUTTON LIKE MOBILE PHONE 
USUALLY SOME MOBILE PHONE COVER THE DIALLING NUMBER PART 
SO WE CAN COVER THESE BUTTONS WHICH ARE NOT USED OR UH NUMBER BUTTONS FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE CAN CHANNELS 
AND JUST PUT UH VOLUME CHANGE OR SO EACH CAN UH CHANNEL CHANGE BUTTONS UH UH IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND OF THE USER NEEDED TO DO SOME MORE COMPLEX TASK UH HE HE CAN OPEN THE COVER AND THEN CHANGE SETTINGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
OH 
AND ALSO UH I THINK IF WE PUT SOME SOME SOME SOME SOME BUTTONS INSIDE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IT CAN BE USED EASIER 
NOT IN REMOTE CONTROL 
I DUNNO IF I CAN EXPLAIN WELL 
BUT UH JUST INSIDE 
FOR EXAMPLE A SLIDING OR ROLLING UH UH D UH STUFF IF WE PUT IT INSIDE THEN WE CAN EASILY MANIPULATE WITH UH THUMB 
SO IT CAN BE ANOTHER UH PREFERENCE 
AND UH I DUNNO BUT UH I THINK USAGE OF A SPEECH RECOGN UH R RECOGNISER CAN BE GOOD 
I KNOW THAT IT CONSUMES LOTS OF ENERGY 
BUT IF WE DO IT IN SOME WAY THAT IT ASLEEPS WHEN THERE IS NO SOUND AND WHEN IT DETECTS SOME SEND IT MAY CONSUME LESS ENERGY 
AND I THINK IT'S GOOD BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING NEW AND USUALLY YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE SOMETHING NEW 
SO IT MAY NOT BE VERY USEFUL BUT BECAUSE IT'S NOW PEOPLE MAY BUY IT 
UH I PERSONALLY THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UH BETWEEN SOMETHING 
OTHERWISE THEY PREFER TO BUY SOMETHING WHICH IS COMING FROM A FAMOUS COMPANY OR 
OKAY 
THAT'S MINE 
MM-HMM 
WELL MAYBE IT CAN HAVE TWO SHELLS A HARD SHELL INSIDE AND A SPONGY SHELL OUTSIDE 
YEAH YES 
MM 
OH 
YES 
MAYBE THIS 
SO BUT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
MM 
I THINK I THINK THERE BEING UH LARGE OR SMALL IS NOT IMPORTANT 
THE ONLY IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT IN UH INSIDE HAND EASILY 
SO LET'S SAY AN AVERAGE SIZE OKAY AND IT SHOULD NOT BE VERY HEAVY ALSO 
AND I PREFER TO USE IT SHOULDN'T HAVE A UNIFORM SHAPE IS IN THE MIDDLE IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT THINNER MAYBE MAYBE 
SO WE C IT'S LIKE LIKE SOME JOYSTICKS 
YOU CAN TAKE UH SOME SOME JOYSTICK YOU CAN TAKE INSIDE HAND EASIER BECAUSE IT'S IT'S DESIGNED FOR YOUR F UH TAKING INTO ACCOUNT YOUR FINGER SHAPE AND YOUR PALM SHAPE 
SO THE GENERAL SHAPE SHOULD BE LIKE THIS 
I THINK UH SEVEN CENTIMETRE BY SEVEN CENTIMETRE IS A LITTLE BIT LARGE 
SO UH SEVEN NOT SEVEN BUT LET'S SAY FIVE BY TEN IT'S I THINK IT'S THAT'S MY OPINION 
IT'S EASIER 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OR UH OR I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T WANT TO NOW INVENT SOMETHING NEW BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DISCUSS ABOUT IT 
SO USING SOME L. C. D. S WE CAN TOUCH SO WE CAN REMOVE UH KEYS AND JUST UH HAVING UH I DUNNO THE NAME L. C. D. RESPONDING TO FINGERS 
TOUCHING THE SCREEN 
SOMETHING LIKE MM LIKE TACTILE 
SO BUT FOR NOW IF WE DON'T WANT TO USE SUCH KIND OF SCREENS I I THINK WE USING A A SMALLER SCREEN IS BETTER BECAUSE 
A SMALLER S 
OKAY 
I THINK THIS IS NOT GOOD 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH I THINK INFRA RED 
YEAH PEELING OF THE BANANA 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
OH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SOME 
SOMETHING LIKE A PLASTIC COVER COVERING UH SOME INTERFACE U. S. B. INTERFACE IS IN THE ONE UH DIGITAL CAMERA 
IF YOU SO IT'S LIKE PEELING 
YOU OPEN A PLASTIC COVER AND YOU USE SOME U. S. B. INTERFACES SOME SOME INTERFACES FOR ADAPTOR 
SO KEYS CAN BE UH BUTTONS CAN BE COVERED LIKE THIS 
WITH A PLASTIC COVER AND UH WHEN UH AND WHEN YOU OPEN THIS COVER IT'S LIKE PEELING A BANANA 
SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
YEAH YEAH YEAH IT'S A LIC LIKE A PLASTIC COVER SO 
MM-HMM 
YES YEAH IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
MAGNETIC 
MM 
YEAH OR A YEAH IT CAN USE IT CAN BE A PLASTIC COVER UH STICKING TO THE AT THE ALL THE STUFF LIKE UH WITH MAGNETIC P UH MAGNETIC UH MAGNETIC UH MATERIALS IN THE BORDER 
SO IT'S IT STICKS LIKE REFRIGERATOR DOOR COMPLETELY 
AND WHEN YOU TRY TO OPEN IT IT WILL BE OPENED EASILY 
SO YOU YOU CAN BE SURE THAT IT WILL NOT BE OPEN WHILE YOU'RE UH WHILE WHILE UH YOU ARE COMMONLY USING UH BUTTONS ON THE BANANA 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YES I THINK 
I THINK SO 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
THANK YOU 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN SPONGY 
LIKE SOFT OR SOMETHING 
OKAY 
I WILL SEE 
OKAY 
I THINK THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE WILL BE THE EASY TO USE FEATURE 
WE'LL SEE 
EXACTLY 
OH OKAY SO GOOD NEWS FROM UM UH UH FOR ME FROM HAMED BUT BAD NEWS FROM BOB OBVIOUSLY 
BECAUSE SPONGY DESIGN I DON'T LIKE IT IS OKAY SO COULD YOU PLEASE FABIEN OPEN IT 
I'M PERSON TWO 
AND WHICH ONE UH PROBABLY THE FIRST ONE 
I'M NOT SURE BUT CHECK THE FIRST ONE 
I MOST OF THE THINGS I HAVE TO WRITE MYSELF IN THE BOARD BUT YEAH THAT'S IT 
JUST 
IT'S ONLY THIS SLIDE 
YEAH 
THIS THIS IS JUST UH ONE THING I WANTED TO MENTION AND SHOW YOU THAT I JUST UH I JUST FOUND THIS 
THAT OUR COMPANY UH DEVELOPED A AS A SEVEN OF SEVEN FINGERS OR I'LL JUST YEAH 
SEVEN SEVEN INCH T. T. F. T. SCREEN WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR US SINCE WE WANTED TO INCLUDE A DISPLAY THERE 
UH SO I I PROBABLY DRAW IT DOWN RAW SCHEME 
THIS IS THIS IS THE STUFF THAT I CAN USE IT OKAY 
SO TH THIS WILL BE LIKE THE OVERALL SCHEME OR OVERALL REQUIREMENTS FROM THE ENGINEERING POINT OF VIEW 
UH FIRST THING IS UH THIS WILL BE THE OVERALL SHAPE 
NO UH I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT THE REAL SHAPE OF THE DEVICE BUT THE SHAPE OF THE INSIDE OF THE DEVICE 
SO THERE WILL BE SOME CIRCUIT UH FOR THE POWER 
SO SAY POWER CIRCUIT HERE 
UH THE MAIN ENERGY WILL BE TAKEN FROM BATTERIES THAT WE CAN UH UH AND IF WE DECIDE TO USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION STUFF THERE 
WE MUST USE ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF ENERGY WHICH I FIND THE BEST IS IT IS THE SOLAR CELLS WHICH CAN WHICH CAN UH SUPPLY EVERYTHING 
I WAS COMPUTING ALL THE ALL THE THINGS RELATED TO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND IT'S OKAY IT IS JUST UH TWO BATTERIES AND SOLAR CELLS SO 
SO NO PROBLEM 
THERE CAN BE ALSO SOLAR CELL 
UH THE MAIN BOARD WITH ALL THE CIRCUITS WILL TAKE AT LEAST SEVEN TO SEVEN CENTIMETRES SO THIS IS MY LIKE HARD REQUIREMENT FOR THE GUYS FROM THE DESIGN 
SO AT LEAST SEVEN TO SEVEN 
IT DEPENDS WHERE YOU PUT YOUR SCREEN BECAUSE THE SCREEN IS UH SEVEN INCH SO IT DEPENDS ON YOU WHERE WHERE YOU PUT IT 
IT DOESN'T MATTER 
UM IT'S JUST ONE CORD FROM FROM THE MAIN BOARD AT THE SCREEN WHICH CAN BE ELSEWHERE 
SO THIS WILL BE T. F. T. 
AND IN THE MAIN BOARD WE HAVE THE UM INTERFACE TO THE MICROPHONE WHICH IS SOMEWHERE 
SAY HERE 
INTERFACE TO THE MICROPHONE 
THEN THE GRAPHICAL CARD UH FOR THE T. F. T. AND THE THIRD UNIT IS THE U. R. 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE CAN UH WE DECIDED TO USE THE INFRA RED UNIT BECAUSE OUR COMPANY HAS ALSO DEVELOPED THE CHIP FOR COMMUNICATION BY THE INFRA RED 
INCLUDING ALL THE STUFF INSIDE IS IT WILL BE VERY CHEAP FOR US 
SO INFRA RED HERE 
SO THE ONCE AGAIN THE OVERALL REQUIREMENTS SEVEN TO SEVEN CENTIMETRES FOR THE BOARD 
WHICH HAS TO BE WHICH CAN BE SPONGY BUT HAS TO BE THIS SIZE AND THE T. F. T. WHICH IS SEVEN INCHES 
UM I HAVE TO CHECK WHAT I WANTED TO 
UH FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ABOUT THE MATERIAL USED FOR THE OVERALL DES UH EV ALL THE DEVICE 
A ALL THESE THINGS IN IN UH IN THIS BOX OR OKAY TO PUT IN IN ANY SHAPE BASICALLY 
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE T. F. T. 
WELL SPONGINESS 
MAYBE IT A GOOD FEATURE SINCE IT TAKES IF IT'S AROUND THE T. F. T. THEN IT'S GOOD BECAUSE IT'S JUST KEEPS IT SAFE I DUNNO 
WELL IT'S MAYBE RELATED TO THE U. I. 
A YEAH THAT'S ALL FROM UM 
YEAH 
WELL SEVEN TO SEVEN INCHES 
YES 
YEAH BUT 
TO BE HONEST I WAS 
YEAH HONESTLY SPEAKING I WAS THINKING THAT IT WAS SEVEN CENTIMETRES INITIALLY BUT IT'S SEVEN INCHES 
BUT I I THINK WE CAN WE CAN CUT OUT 
YEAH NO NO PROBLEM BECAUSE BECAUSE BECAUSE THEN THE SIZE OF THE GRAPHIC CARD WILL BE ONE FOURTH 
SO 
YEAH BUT NO PROBLEM TO TO ME TO CUT THE SCREEN 
SO SO FOR THE SAME PRICE WE HAVE FOUR SCREENS NOW 
UH WELL THIS IS LIKE THIS IS ALMOST NOTHING 
SEVEN TO SEVEN AT AT LEAST WELL SOME THREE MILLIMETRES OR SOMETHING 
YEAH BUT WE WANTED THE BIG BUTTONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT YOU KNOW 
BECAUSE IF IT'S TOO TOO SMALL WE CAN WE CAN LOSE IT AT HOME YOU KNOW 
I THOUGHT THAT IT IT SHOULD FIT IN THE HAND OR SOMETHING 
W I I THINK SO 
I IF THE ROLLER BUTTONS ARE IN THE SIDE YOU DON'T HAVE TO CATCH IT LIKE THAT BUT JUST LIKE THIS AND YOU KNOW FOLLOW FOLLOW WELL 
THAT'S THAT'S NO TASK FOR ME BUT WELL SEVEN TO SEVEN AT LEAST YEAH BUT 
OH OKAY 
OKAY THANKS 
NOT 
J UH JUST A POINT AT THE ENERGY THE THINGS 
IF WE USE THE BATTERIES AND THE ADDITIONAL USE SOLAR CELL 
THEN IT'S OKAY FOR L. UH SPEECH RECOGNITION AND L. C. D. S NO PROBLEM AN ENERGY I THINK 
BUT WE HAVE TO USE THE SOLAR CELL 
OTHERWISE NOT 
YEAH I WAS THINKING JUST COMMON A. A. CELLS 
SO LIKE THREE TO FIVE CENTIMETRES I DUNNO EXACTLY BUT 
SO 
UH D DOESN'T NEED TO BE SEEN 
IT IT'S JUST THE DAYLIGHT YOU KNOW 
YEAH WELL I I SUPPOSE THAT I SUPPOSE THAT UH THAT THIS REMOTE CONTROL WON'T BE IN THE ON THE ROOM LIKE THIS 
WHERE THERE IS LIGHT ONLY WHEN WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE BUT 
YEAH FROM THE T. I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH UH 
UH IT'S A IT'S A COMPROMISE NO 
YEAH THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO TO INCLUDE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION BECAUSE YOU WANTED ALL THE NEW THINGS 
UH THE USE THE SCREEN IS OKAY BUT THE BOARD UH THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
WELL WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU GUESS IS A SHAPE 
OR WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE SHAPE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
FIVE TO TEN 
WELL THAT 
YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH I THINK IT'S FEASIB WELL NO UM UM HOW COULD WE DO IT 
WE COULD PUT THE BOARD NEXT TO WELL 
UNDER THE L. C. D. AND FOR EXAMPLE MAKE THE L. C. D. BE TOTALLY UNRELATED TO THE THING THAT YOU HOLD ON YOUR HAND 
LIKE HOLDING SOMETHING AND THE L. C. D. TO BE JUST ON TOP OF IT YOU KNOW SOMEHOW 
WELL BUT MAYBE LET'S STICK TO THE S SPONGY THING LIKE N NOT 
WELL F FIVE TO TUNE IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE 
OKAY SO FIVE TO TEN I I THINK IT'S IT'S FEASIBLE 
I'LL MAKE IT 
FO FIVE BY TEN 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO 
YEAH SO SO JUST JUST GIVE ME THE THE THE FIVE BY TEN NUMBERS THAT YOU FIND THE BEST AND SEND IT UM AND I WILL WORK IT IT 
HMM 
SEVEN TO TEN BANANA 
OKAY 
RATHER MANGO OR SOMETHING OR 
YOU MEAN BANANA 
WELL BUT 
IF IT'S F OUT OF THE BANANA IS BIG ENOUGH 
THEN YES 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN ON 
WELL 
WELL IT CAN BE WHATEVER YOU WANT 
BUT IF IT'S SQUARE THEN WE GOT FOUR SCREENS OUT OF ONE BY CUTTING JUST 
BUT IF YOU WANT SOME SHAPE THEN WE CAN ONLY GOT LIKE TWO SCREENS OUT OF SEVEN TO SEVEN INCHES SO 
IT'S LIKE MORE MORE EXPENSIVE TO HAVE SHAPE LIKE THAT 
BUT I DON'T CARE 
YOU KNOW IF WE FIT THIS REQUIREMENT 
OKAY 
YEAH M MAYBE THE BANANA COULD BE LIKE A BIT UH FATTER THAN THAN THE C C COMMON ONE 
BUT 
LIKE MODIFIED BANANA OKAY 
WELL IT WE'LL STICK TO BANANA OR 
OKAY 
MM MM 
YEAH YEAH 
SURE 
LIKE LIKE PEELING OF THE BANANA YOU SEE 
IT WOULD BE COOL YEAH 
PEELING OF THE BANANA YOU KNOW SHOULD SHOULD DISCOVER THE OTHER BUTTONS WHICH ARE HIDDEN 
FIRST LAYER OBVIOUSLY SPO YEAH W IT'S IT'S LIKE SILLY BUT THE PEOPLE WILL REALLY APPRECIATE IT YEAH I THINK 
WELL SO IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT SOFT 
SO I THINK IF IT'S SO THEN IT'S COOL 
COOL 
HONESTLY SPEAKING I CANNOT IMAGINE IT AS FAR BUT IT WILL BE TERRIBLE 
MM 
POF 
WELL SINCE SINCE THE SINCE THE THINGS LIKE THE LIKE THE SCREEN AND UM HOW TO SAY THAT SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE HAS TO BE LIKE KEPT 
KEPT IN THE SHAPE WE CANNOT BE UH SO WE NEED THAT TH THAT THE PEELING 
OH 
I DUNNO BUT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THESE TWO TWO THINGS 
SO IF IF UH THE SOLAR CELL WON'T BE VISIBLE WHILE THE BANANA IS CLOSED 
THEN THE MATERIAL MUST BE ABLE TO PUT THE LIGHT INSIDE YOU KNOW 
SO THAT WE CAN REACH THE ENERGY OUT OF IT OUT OF THAT 
IT IS POSSIBLE BUT WELL IF IT 
I DUNNO 
I DUNNO HOW TO HOW TO DO IT IF IF IT IF IT IF IT'S BETTER TO PUT THE SOLAR CELL TO THE TO TO THE PEELING OR OUTSIDE IT 
OR OR INSIDE 
BUT THEN IT MUST BE SOME WINDOW THERE YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
I AGREE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO HELLO EVERYONE 
WE'RE HERE TO HAVE A KICK OFF MEETING FOR THE DESIGN OF A F FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEW PROJECT UM UH REMOTE CONTROL FOR THE DESIGN FOR A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER CHRISTA PAVLOV AND OKAY LET'S BEGIN 
SO 
I'M FIRST GOING TO DO AN OPENING THEN WE GET USED TO ONE ANOTHERS AND WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS TOOL WE'RE GOING TO DESIGN AND TRY TO MAKE A PROJECT PLAN 
SOME DISCUSSION AND THEN WE TALK OF UH THE NEXT MEETING 
SO UM WE WANT TO TO DO A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
IT HAS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY 
UM I THINK THE IMPORTANT POINTS WE HAVE TO TO TALK ABOUT OUR UH IT'S FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IT'S CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DESAIL DETAILED DESIGN 
AND FOR THAT WE'RE GOING UM ALL TO WORK INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN HAVE MEETING DURING THE WHOLE DAY 
UM SO LET'S TRY THE WHITEBOARD 
UM SO ANY OF YOU WHO WANT TO GO 
WOW 
A RABBIT 
A RABBIT 
YOU WANT TO GO 
A HUMAN AH 
MM I THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO YEAH 
HMM 
SO THAT A WORM 
OR 
OH YEAH CHRISTA PAVLOV MM 
SMILING FISH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
NEXT 
LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY 
SO 
YEAH MM THAT'S THE PRICE WE WANT TO THAT'S THE UM FOR THE PRICE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
WE AIM TO DO THIS PROFIT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM FOR A PRODUCTION COST OF MM TWELVE FIFTY EUROS MAXIMUM 
'KAY 
SO ANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE IN REMOTE CONTROLS 
THAT 
SO THAT COULD BE A GREAT UM APPLICATION 
REMOTE CONTROLS CHILDREN PROOF 
MM MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO THEY HAVE TO BE WATERPROOF MAYBE 
'CAUSE THEY IT SH IT IT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
COLOURFUL YEAH MM 
NO THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
MM MM MM 
YEAH 
NO BECAUSE YOU THINK WHY NOT 
MM-HMM 
GOOD IDEA 
SMALL ALSO 
DON'T YOU THINK 
NO UH NOT TOO MUCH BUTTONS ARE MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH THAT'S 
OKAY 
SO I THINK THERE'S 
SO YOU YOU THINK IT'S BETTER IF SMALL 
THEN BIGGER 
NO NOT TOO SMALL YEAH 
HMM 
OKAY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
SO SOME KIND OF D UH WITH UM UM CELLULAR PHONE WITH A A SCREEN THAT WILL TELL YOU WHAT ONE 
OKAY 
AND TOO EXPENSIVE 
MM 
MM MM 
MM-HMM 
MM MM MM 
SO ADAPTABLE YEAH SOMETHING YEAH 
OTHER OPTION 
UM 
MM-HMM 
MAYBE IF IT'S MORE IF THERE IS A SOFTWARE INSIDE THAT ASK YOU THREE 
HMM 
IF IT IF WE WANT A R UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL THAT WE USE LIKE WE SAY BEFORE IT MAY 
MAY NEED MORE THAN THREE MM OTHER BUTTON THREE MM POSSIBILITIES YE YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
I CHANGE CHANNEL LIKE THIS UM UH I WANT TO GO TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN TO TEN UH-HUH MM YEAH 
ALSO WE CAN BE HERE YEAH THAT WOULD BE COOL 
MM YEAH 
MM MM 
OKAY 
SO I THINK WE HAVE FULL OF IDEA 
UM WE'RE GOING TO MEET AGAIN IN THIRTY MINUTES AND UH I WANT YOU TO MM 
WORK ON THESE IDEAS AND TRY TO MAKE A 
UH THE ONES MAKE ME TO DECIDE WHAT WHAT ARE THE ONES IMPORTANT AND WHAT ARE THE ON THAT WE DON'T WANT 
AND UM M MAYBE MORE ON THE TECHNICAL PARTS WHAT UH DO WE WANT TO DO 
UM 
SO UM YOUR PERSONAL COACH WILL SEND YOU SOME INSTRUCTION FOR FOR THIS THIRTY MINUTES 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MM OKAY 
SO 
I THINK THAT'S ALL 
YEAH 
SO YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES 
WOW 
WOW 
COMPLEX 
HUH 
A CAT 
NO 
DARN 
OH 
A WHITE 
A OR A RABBIT OH OH YEAH WHERE IS THE CARROT 
OKAY MM-HMM 
I AM NOT VERY GOOD TO UH THIS KIND OF STUFF 
MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS 
GUESS 
A HUMAN YAY 
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ANIMAL AND UM YEAH 
CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS THIS ANIMAL IS DANGEROUS 
UH A KIND OF UH SNAKE 
COBRA 
EXACTLY 
UH-HUH 
WHAT ABOUT YOU UH CHRISTA 
A FISH 
A SMILING FISH 
MM-HMM 
SO W WHITEBOARD IS WORKING 
GOOD 
NEXT 
YEAH WELL 
NOT UM 
SO 
TWENTY FIVE EURO FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
'TIS BIG NUMBER 
MM-HMM 
OH YES WE HAVE PLENTY AT HOME 
IN FACT MY DAUGHTER LIKES L REMOTE CONTROLS 
IT IT 
YEAH MAINLY NEED TO BREAK 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
Y Y YEAH 
SO SHE LIKES UH BUTTONS WHICH MAKE CLICK SO IT HAS TO CLICK 
IT HAS TO BE UH WHA BABY PROOF YEAH BUT MAINLY IT HAS TO BE VERY ROBUST BECAUSE EVEN IF SHE'S NOT VERY TALL SHE'S UH HIGH ENOUGH SO THAT UH WHEN SHE THROW IT AWAY IT'S UH 
SO IT HAS TO BE VERY ROBUST 
UNBREAKABLE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
AND UH 
IT HAS TO BE NICE LOOKING 
COLOURFUL MAYBE 
COLOURFUL BECAUSE UH NOBODY HAS COLOURFUL REMOTE CONTROL THEY'RE ALWAYS BLACK YEAH BUT THIS ONE COULD BE I DUNNO PURPLE OR B 
YEAH YEAH 
ONE COLOUR 
YEAH YEAH 
UH LIKE THE PHONES YEAH IT COULD CHANGE COLOURS YEAH 
YEAH 
GOOD 
SHOULD TO BE 
YOU YOU KNOW THIS UH REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE UM THEY ARE WHAT THEY CALL A UNIVERSAL RET REMOTE CONTROL SO YOU YOU CAN DECIDE THAT NOW IT'S THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR THE TELEVISION 
THEN IT'S THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR THE THE SOUND SYSTEM OR FOR YOUR REFRIGERATOR WHATEVER I DUNNO IF IT'S 
OR IF WE SHOULD HAVE A TARGETED RE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO COLOUR ROBUSTNESS EASY TO USE SIZE YEAH SIZE MATTERS YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
BUT UH WHAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THIS FROM THE OTHERS 
I DUNNO IF 
YEAH AT LEAST THE COLOUR WOULD BE DIFFERENT 
I THINK ONE THING IMPORTANT FOR INSTANCE IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN PEOPLE USE IT THEY'RE THEY NEVER FIND A GOOD BUTTON ON THE RIGHT PLACE 
FOR SOME REASON THEY THEY THEY CLICK THE OFF BUTTON WHEN THEY WANT TO USE THE 
SO THERE'S A PROBLEM IN THE DESIGN OF THAT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL SOMEHOW I DUNNO 
TOO EXPENSIVE FOR TWELVE EURO 
OH 
MM-HMM 
I THOUGHT IT COULD BE ONLY A SCREEN WHICH WOULD CHANGE DEPENDING ON UH UH THE S OR EVEN THE USER 
SO UM I PREFER TO HAVE THE OFF BUTTON TO THE TOP RIGHT 
SO I WOULD HAVE MY OWN DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S IN FACT JUST A A FULL TOUCH SCREEN REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU IF YOU LOOK 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT MAKES SENSE BUT 
YEAH FOR INSTANCE MM 
MM 
MAYBE IF IF IT'S POSSIBLE YEAH 
YEAH 
THREE BUTTONS YOU MEAN 
OH 
MM-HMM YEAH SURE 
YEAH MORE THAN THREE ACTIONS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DO IT A GIVEN TIME 
YEAH BUT FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU CHANGE CHANNELS YOU CAN HAVE YOU CAN JUST GO TO THE NEXT ONE OR GO TO CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE 
AND THAT'S ALREADY MORE COMPLEX TO GO TO CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE 
OH NO 
BECAUSE I'M ONLY USING THERE ARE FOR CHANNELS BUT 
AND THEN BACK TO THE ONE I WAS BEFORE SO THERE'S WHICHEVER IT WAS 
YEAH 
UH UH WE HAD THAT ONE ONE OTHER COUNTRIES 
YEAH E EVEN THE HISTORY SO YOU COULD LIKE UH AND PREVIOUS OF THE PREVIOUS 
THEN YOU CAN WATCH WHAT YOUR UH YOU COULD ALSO RECORD YOUR RECORD YOUR SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS 
THAT BECOMES MORE COMPLEX BUT YOU COULD LOOK AT WHAT UH THE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID THERE ARE REMOTE CONTROLS 
YEAH MAYBE IT'S A 
OKAY 
SO WHAT DOES M. E. MEANS 
M. A. THE USER REQUIREMENTS 
OR THAT'S UH THAT'S FOR US 
OH THAT'S ME 
UH OF COURSE YEAH THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS UH-HUH YEAH 
OKAY 
I'LL THINK OF THAT 
SO 
MEETING'S OVER 
GREAT 
THANK YOU 
OOPS 
YEAH FOR FAVOURITE ANIMALS 
IT'S GONNA BE NOT MY FAVOURITE ONE BUT THE ONE I CAN DRAW 
AND IT'S GONNA BE YOU'LL TRY TO GUESS 
NO 
YES THAT'S A RABBIT 
THAT'S MY FAVOURITE ONE 
THAT'S IT 
HMM 
WOW 
NO 
WOW 
THAT'S COBRA 
NO IT JUST SMALL COBRA YEAH 
IT'S C C QUITE RECOGNISABLE 
CHRISTA CHRISTA 
HMM 
OKAY 
JUST TR TRY TO GUESS WHO IS A USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
ACCORDING TO THE DRAWINGS 
OKAY 
IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET 
WOW 
MM 
IT IT 
CHILDREN PROOF 
HMM 
OKAY UNBREAKABLE 
UH-HUH 
COLOURFUL 
THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL 
NO 
BUT HOW GONNA OKAY JUST UH BUT IT'S UH MONOCHROME IT'S NO IT'S NOT LIKE 
OTHERWISE YOU WILL NEVER FIND OUT 
COOL 
OUCH 
YEAH BUT WITHOUT ANY EXTREMES LIKE N NOT OF THIS SIZE NOT TOO LARGE 
OKAY 
YEAH LIKE A PALM SIZED 
JUST TO HOLD IT 
NO NO SCREENS IT'S TOO COMPLEX 
AND ONE MAYBE NOT TOO EXPENSIVE WELL IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM BUT WELL OKAY 
BUT NO SCREENS ON REMOTE CONTROLS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
ADAPTABLE 
ALRIGHT GOOD IS HOW MANY ACTIONS DO WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT IN IT 
ON OFF 
I MEAN IF IT'S LESS THAN THREE UH THEN WE CAN MAKE IT UH LIKE A 
LIKE THREE MENTAL STATES YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WE CAN JUST MAKE IT UH 
CONTROLLED BY A BRAIN HUH 
MM-HMM 
SH SURE SURE 
BUT FOR STANDARD ACTIONS YOU USUALLY WHAT DO YOU DO YOU CHANGE CHANNELS YOU ADJUST VOLUME AND NOTHING ELSE 
MM-HMM 
YOU DO THIS 
I USUALLY JUST CHANGE CHANNELS 
UH-HUH 
GO BACK BUTTON IS GOOD 
I ONCE HAD TO 
MM-HMM 
HISTORY 
MARKET EXPERT 
OKAY 
THANK YOU EVERYBODY 
NO 
RABBIT 
YOU W 
SO THE WHITE OKAY 
I GUESS YOU CAN

YEAH EVEN WE CAN CHANGE COLOURS ON 
LIKE THE UH LIKE THE PHONES AND THESE THINGS WE C YEAH 
AT LEAST FOR CHILDREN LIKE ONE COLOUR AND 
AND IT SHOULD BE REALLY SMALL AND 
HUH NOT SO BIG LIKE YEAH 
YEAH NOT TOO MUCH BUTTONS AND 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
COLOUR SIZE SH 
YEAH MAYBE AT LEAST N NOT BIGGER THAN THIS I GUESS 
YEAH YEAH AT LEAST IT SHOULD HOLD ON YOUR HAND N PROPERLY LIKE 
YEAH 
UH MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE THE COLOURS THAT AT LEAST THE FORM

HMM 
I MEAN IT IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE TWO TYPES NO 
PEOPLE ARE RIGHT HANDED OR LEFT HANDED SO YOU BECAUSE I AM LEFT HANDED I SEE LIKE THIS 
SAY IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED YOU SEE LIKE THIS OR IS THE YOUR SWITCH ON AND OFF SHOULD BE ONE YEAH 
MM HUH 
MAYBE I THINK EVEN WE CAN KEEP TWO SWITCHES AND THEN WE CAN UH ONLY MAKE AN WORKING 
WE CAN ADAPT ONLY ONE SWITCH SUPPOSE HERE LIKE WE CAN MAKE TWO SWITCHES AND IF I'M LEFT HANDER I SEE THIS SWITCH TO FOLLOW THE MAIN OPERATIONS 
TWO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT THEY KEEP GENERALLY THEIR T SLASH SLASH UH THIS THING AND THEN THE DASH DASH AND THEN YOU CAN PUT YEAH YOU CAN ONLY HAVE NO BUT 
DASH 
YEAH YOU CAN YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH THE PREVIOUS BUTTON IS 
OH OKAY 
UH UH 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH WHAT THE WHICH CHANNELS THE VIEWER 
MARKETING YEAH 
THANK YOU 
SO 
I HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR THIS UH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING 
UM SO I WILL TAKE THE MINUTES YOU MM YOU THERE ARE GOING TO DO PRESENTATION 
UM UH WE WANT TO KNOW IT AT THE NEED TO KNOW THE NEW PROJECT'S REQUIREMENT SO WE NEED UH TO KNOW THE THE USER HE NEEDS THAT WE WANT TO FULFIL TO FULFIL THE FROM THE TECHNICAL PART WE WANT TO KNOW HOW IT GOING TO WORK AND UM 
THIRD PART UH I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH IS NOT VERY GOOD 
UH OF COURSE HOW TO TO DESIGN THIS UH THIS YEAH 
SO 
UM LET'S GO FOR THE THREE PRESENTATIONS SO FIRST UM MARKETING EXPERT 
SO WAIT A MINUTE 
MM 
SOUNDS UH 
MM UH 
HMM 
OKAY 
F. FIVE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
WHY NOT 
OKAY UH TH THAT'S LIKE GREAT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OR SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT WE UH DON'T CONSIDER TELETEXT THAT IT'S OUT OF DATE NOW BECAUSE OF INTERNET 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM MM 
OKAY 
MM I THINK IT'S GOOD OKAY 
YOU DONE A GOOD REVIEW 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM MM MM 
OKAY 
THAT'S GOOD POINT 
OKAY 
SO UM NOW I THINK IT'S THE TRAIN OF THE 
THE I'M NOT SURE UM 
OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION IS 
OH 
WHAT EFFECT 
OKAY 
WAIT A SECOND 
ARGH 
SO YOU'RE 
OKAY 
LET'S GO 
OH SORRY 
OKAY 
OH SORRY 
IT'S OFF 
IT'S ONE 
OR YOU WANT TO GO TO THE KITCHEN 
MM 
UM I SEE THAT YOU TARGET UH SEVERAL S APPLICATION NOT ONLY T. V. BUT I LIKE WE TALK ABOUT UM UNIVERSAL UH REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
SO 
SINCE WE WERE TARGETING A REALLY SEEN UH UH DATA FOR THE THE THE UM I ISSUING OF THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL I THINK WE WILL ONLY CONCENTRATE ON T. V. FOR THE MOMENT AND THEN MAYBE M MAKE IT MORE GENERALISED YEAH 
YEAH IT'S IT'S THE SAME SOLUTION I THINK 
HMM 
YEAH UH ON ZAP IT'S ONLY NEXT NEXT NEXT NEXT NEXT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE UH DIFFERENT MODES FOR EACH BUTTON AND YOU CAN CHANGE MODE ZAPPING MODE OR 
UH CURRENT CHAN 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OH YOU'RE FINISH 
OKAY 
SO NOW THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THIS NEW DEVICE 
MM 
YOU PREFER IT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
TO MAKE IT QUITE UH AN UNIVERSAL UH DEVICE UH 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND FROM FROM THE DISCUSSION WE HAD DO YOU CAN YOU MAKE IT IN THE WHITEBOARD OR MM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
NO 
UH TURN IT OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE PRICE OF THIS COMPONENT 
IT MM OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
WITH A KEYWORDS AND YEAH 
MM-HMM MM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
NO NO NO NOT ONLY SPEECH YEAH 
I IT'S AN OPTION 
OKAY 
SH IT TO TRAIN OKAY 
MM 
AND WELL WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA OF AUTOMATIC ON OFF IN THE BUTTON YEAH 
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE UH ARGUMENTS 
I WANT UH 
AND WE CAN INCREASE THIS THE STRENGTH Y YOU CAN BUY ONE WITH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YOU HAVE MM SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY 
OH 
NO 
OKAY THANKS 
SO 
MM 
MM I THINK OKAY WE'RE JUST ONE TIME 
UM MM MM 
SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO L HAVE THE LUNCH BREAK 
THEN WE WILL WORK AGAIN FOR THIRTY MINUTES INDIVIDUAL WORK AND UM 
WE WILL UH MEET AGAIN FOR THE NEXT MEETING AND UH IN THIS ONE WANT IT 
TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS THE UM IN THE COMPONENTS SO 
OH 
YOU WILL FOCUS ON THE COMPONENT CONCEPT UM 
UH OF COURSE THE U. I. D. MARK WILL BE UH FOCUSED ON THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT AND UH OUR UM MARKET EXPERT SAMMY BENJO UH IN THE TREND WATCHING 
SO UM OF COURSE LIKE BEFORE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSONAL PERSONAL COACH 
WELL I THINK THAT'S ALL 
AND WE HAVE UM MAYBE WE HAVE TO WE SAY ONLY FOR T. V. ONTO TELETEXT 
UH I THINK AUTOMATIC ON OFF CONTROL UH IT'S NOT POSSIBLE 
YEAH MAYBE IN THE NEXT UH STEP IF WE MAKE IT WORK UM 
YEAH IMPLEMENTED 
O OKAY WE CAN THINK ABOUT THAT 
AND UM 
DO YOU SEE SOMETHING ELSE 
OH YEAH THAT'S 
OR MAYBE YOU WANT TO PHONE HIM 
SINCE NOW ALL YEAH 
THINK 
UH-HUH 
AND UH 
AND IT'S ANSWERED 
CLAP CLAP CLAP IT'S A GOOD I I THINK IT'S UNIVERSAL 
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WITHOUT HAND 
YEAH 
MM UH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM SO LET'S TO THINK SO SO THAT YEAH 
I THINK THAT COULD BE IN THE COMPONENT UH CONCEPT UH 
IT YES 
OKAY 
SO YEAH LET'S GO TO LUNCH 
SO 
OF COURSE 
NICE STUFF 
WHO STARTS 
OH 
OH 
OKAY 
SO I DUNNO IF I CAN DO THAT LIKE THIS 
YEAH 
SO IT'S BEING MODIFIED 
DO YOU WANT YEAH OPEN 
READ ONLY 
I HOPE I SAVED IT 
SO UM YEAH THIS IS MY NAME 
SO SO YOU KNOW YOU I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW ME SAMMY BENJO 
I AM THE EXPERT IN MARKETING AND I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE UH SO WANT AND UH LOOK AND DISLIKE IN REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND I HOPE THIS IS GOING TO HELP YOU TO TO DESIGN IT CORRECTLY 
SO NEXT PLEASE 
UH UH 
HMM 
YEAH MAYBE IN THE FULL PAGE BECAUSE I I SPENT LOTS OF TIME DOING THIS PRESENTATION SO 
UH-HUH HMM OKAY 
SO BASICALLY UH WHAT I SUGGEST IS THAT UH INSTEAD OF DECIDING OURSELF WHAT WHAT COULD BE AND WHAT SHOULD BE A GOOD UH REMOTE CONTROL 
LET'S ASK PEOPLE WHO ARE USERS OF REMOTE CONTROLS HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT W THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS WHAT THEY LIKE 
WHAT THEY DON'T LOOK AND UM AND WHAT THEY DO WITH THEM BY THE WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE USEFUL 
DON'T FORGET ABOUT THAT 
SO WE'VE WE'VE CONDUCTED A A SURVEY ON ON THE EASE OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE RESULTS WE FOUND IN THIS SURVEY 
AND NEXT PLEASE 
YEAH SO BASICALLY WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT UH THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT THE USER DON'T LIKE ONE REMOTE CONTROLS 
FIRST OF ALL THEY FIND IT VERY UGLY 
CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS AS YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE SAME AS THIS ONE UH THEY'RE NOT NICE COLOUR 
NOT NICE SHAPE I MEAN THEY'RE ALL THE SAME AND THEY'RE NOT L GOOD LOOKING 
UM WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT IN FACT IT SEEMS THAT THEY WERE PEOPLE ARE READY TO PAY FOR NICE AND LOOK AND FANCY LOOKING UH REMOTE CONTROL 
SO I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY SPEND LOTS OF TIME ON AND EFFORT IN THAT UM 
AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT UH THE THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE NOT SO EASY TO USE AND IT AT THE THE CURRENT UH FACILITIES THAT THEY OFFER DO NOT MATCH WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO USE THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS 
FOR INSTANCE UH WE USE THAT UH THEY ZAP VERY OFTEN SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY UH IMPORTANT UH FUNCTIONALITY THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY FOR THEM TO TO ZAP UH NO NO WAY OR ANOTHER 
AND MOST OF THE BUTTONS UH IN UH CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE NOT USED 
SO I THINK WE SHOULD DESIGN SOMETHING WHERE SOME OF THE BUTTONS WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE USED SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE AND SO THEN OTHERS THAT ONLY A COUPLE OF PEOPLE ARE USING 
UM NEXT PLEASE 
NOW PEOPLE ARE VERY FRUSTRATED WI WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS AND THEY FOR INSTANCE UH THEY DON'T EVEN FIND IT IT'S IT'S OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE ON THE ON YOUR HOME AND NOBODY KNOWS WHERE IT IS 
MAYBE IF WE HAVE SOMETHING WHERE WE COULD ASK THE REMOTE CONTROL PLEASE WHERE ARE YOU 
LIKE UH SOMETHING TO TO LOOK AT I THINK PHONES 
SOME OF THE PHONES HAVE SOME OF THOSE KIND OF US FUNCTIONALITY 
UH OF COURSE PHONE YOU CAN ALWAYS PHONE YOUR PHONE BUT YOU CAN'T PHONE YOUR YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT WHY NOT 
YEAH 
AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY BUTTONS ON THIS REMOTE CONTROLS THAT NOBODY IS IN FACT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE THEM 
SO MOST OF THE THE PEOPLE SAY THEY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW IT THEY TO USE PROPERLY THEIR R REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND UH THEY ARE BAD FOR R. S. I. BUT UH I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT IS R. S. I. 
SO I THINK THEY ARE BAD 
MM-HMM 
MM NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA ABOUT THAT 
WELL I'LL CHECK UH WITH MY 
OH OKAY I THINK IT'S A TECHNICAL THING WHICH ARE 
OKAY 
SO IT SEEMS THAT IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR A CONCEPT THAT WE DON'T KNOW BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT 
SO ANYWAY THAT'S FOR WHAT THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATION UH OF THE USER AND UM 
WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE 
NEXT SLIDE 
OH YEAH 
SO WE'VE LISTED A COUPLE OF UH 
SO UH FUNCTIONS THAT MAY BE UH USED BY U THE USER IN THE CURRENT UH AVAILABLE UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND UH WELL THE TABLES LOOK VERY NICE TO READ ABOUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE POWER BUTTON IS NOT USED OFTEN BECAUSE IN GENERAL YOU USE IT ONLY ONCE PER SESSION 
BUT IT IS VERY RELEVANT 
PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE A POWER BUTTON 
CHANNEL SELECTION IS UH O OFTEN USED VERY OFTEN USED AND INDEED UH VERY RELEVANT 
UH NOW I REMEMBER WHAT IS R. S. I. IT'S REPETITIVITY STRESS INJURY 
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THAT WORD BUT UH ANYWAY I CONTINUE MY PRESENTATION SO YEAH CHANNEL SELECTION IS UM VERY IMPORTANT VERY OFTEN USED 
VOLUME IS NOT OFTEN USED BUT PEOPLE UH WANT TO HAVE CONTROL IN VOLUME AND THAT MAKES SENSE OF COURSE 
AND ONE THEN YOU HAVE THINGS WHICH ARE VERY MUCH LESS OFTEN USED LIKE THE SETTINGS 
AUDIO SETTINGS SCREEN SETTINGS EVEN TELETEXT AND CHANNEL SETTINGS 
ALL OF THEM 
THEY'RE NOT OFTEN USED AND THEY ARE IS MORE OR LESS RELEVANT 
IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE FIND TELETEXT TELETEXT UH RELEVANT EVEN IF I PERSONALLY NEVER USE IT BUT SEEMS THAT IT'S AVERAGE RELEVANT AT LEAST SO 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT UH IN A L IN A SCALE BETWEEN ONE AND TEN RELEVANT UH NOT RELEVANT TO RELEVANT PEOPLE SCORED A SIX ON THIS 
WHICH IS NOT SO UH THESE THESE TWO IN WERE HAD I THINK TEN I THINK 
BUT BUT IF YOU COMPARE WITH THESE ONES UH I THINK THEY SCORED A ONE OR TWO 
NOT VERY RELEVANT SO 
IF IF THERE ARE GOOD REASON NOT TO PUT TELETEXT IT'S OKAY BUT JUST KNOW THAT PEOPLE FIND IT SOMEHOW RELEVANT 
THAT'S FOR THE MAIN FUNCTIONS I THINK AND UH THEN WE CAN ASK UH OURSELF UH WHAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THAT MAY BE USEFUL 
FOR INSTANCE I THINK NET NEXT SLIDE 
ONE OF THE THING THE TREND UH THAT UH YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE OF USE THE POSSIBILITY THE EVENTUAL POSSIBILITY OF HAVING SPEECH RECOGNITION IN YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO TAP TAP IN YOUR BUTTONS BUT JUST TELL YOUR REMOTE CONTROL OR WHATEVER YOU AND YOU HAVE WHAT YOU WANT 
SO WE'VE CONDUCTED A SURVEY ABOUT UH WHETHER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE OR NOT TO HAVE UH THIS KIND OF UH FUNCTIONALITY IN THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AND SO WE CAN USE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE AGE 
YOUNG PEOPLE PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S A BUZZ WORD FIND IT VERY RELEVANT 
AND UH IS THE AGE GOES UP THE THE RELEVANCE GOES DOWN 
SO NOW IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF UH TARGETING UH WHO WHO ARE WE TARGETING WITH THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
I THINK IF WE ARE TARGETING YOUNG PEOPLE THAN UH IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CONSIDER 
IF WE ARE TARGETING YOU VERY OLD PEOPLE THIS IS SOMETHING THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY THEY THIS SHOULD BE SO NOW THIS IS OF COURSE DEPENDS ON THAT 
AND UM I DON'T HAVE ANY CONCLUSION I DIDN'T HAVE TIME THE MEETING WAS VERY TIGHT SO THAT'S BASICALLY MY FINDINGS 
AND UH IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION 
I CAN GO BACK 
YEAH ONE QUESTION YEAH 
I UM 
I THINK WE SHOULD AIM AT THE YOUNG PEOPLE 
BUT UH I THINK THEY ARE THEY ARE THESE UH WHO MIGHT BE MORE INTERESTED IN A IN A NEW DEVICE 
IN GENERAL THE THE EARLY ADOPTERS OF A NEW DEVICE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE LESS THAN MORE THAN 
THEN TELETEXT IS USELESS FOR THEM I THINK YEAH 
BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE THREE MEANS OF FINDING THEIR INFORMATION 
YEAH 
BUT YEAH 
'KAY 
SO I THINK IT'S YOU HUH 
NO 
NO USER REQUIREMEN 
MAKES SENSE 
I WOULD SAY THE SIMPLEST ONE AS LONG AS THERE ARE THE UH I FIND THE BUTTONS THAT I NEED EVERY TIME I NEED A BUTTON 
NICE 
NICE SENTENCE 
MM 
MM-HMM 
AND WHEN DOES IT TURN OFF 
UH SO YOU HAVE A 
SENSING SENSOR MACHINE THAT HE KNOWS 
TOUCH 
MM-HMM 
ACCORDING TO YOUR DISTANCE AT AND THE ANGLE MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A STEREO SYSTEM 
UH I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE SCREEN WHA WHAT IS THE USE USEFULNESS OF THE SCREEN 
UH IS IT A TOUCH SCREEN BY THE WAY 
SO IT GIVES INSTRUCTIONS BUT UH IT HAS TO BE WITH ONE BACK LIGHT SOMEHOW 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO FOR INSTANCE IF I WANT TO GO TO DIRECTLY TO CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE HOW WOULD I D CAN I DO THAT WITH THIS 
YEAH MM LET'S SAY I M UH ONE CHANNEL EIGHT NOW 
YOU KNOW THESE DAYS WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF CHANNELS THAT'S NOT SO EASY TO GO JUST NEXT NEXT NEXT WHEN YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF CHANNELS 
OR IS IT 
MOST PEOPLE YEAH 
IN FACT NO NO NO UH REMOTE CONTROL THAT I'VE SEEN INSTEAD OF DOING THAT DO YOU COULD JUST SAY THESE ARE THE CH CH CHANNEL THREE 
TWENTY EIGHT FORTY EIGHT AND UH SIXTY FOUR OR THIS THAT I WANT IT BY CYCLED WITH MY NEXT BUTTON 
I UH 
B YEAH 
GO TO CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE 
ONE THING IS THAT SO I SAID IN MY PRESENTATION PEOPLE REALLY DO LIKE TO Z ZAP 
SO EVEN IF THEY ARE ONLY WATCHING FOUR OR FIVE CHANNELS 
I THINK THEY WANT TO ZAP OUT OF THE ONE HUNDRED CHANNELS JUST BECAUSE THIS IS ONE KIND OF THING THEY DO ZAPPING 
AND IT'S ONLY NEXT 
YEAH SO BUT YOU HAVE TO 
OKAY 
SO IT WOULD BE 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
LISTENING MORE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
WELL I COULD COULD UH HAVE A LOOK AT THAT MAYBE 
I'LL CHECK IN MY DEPARTMENT IF THERE'S SOMEONE SPECIALIST IN THAT 
ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BUT UH VERY VERY GOOD TO SELL 
THINK OF A ALL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOVE TO SAY THAT THIS REMOTE CONTROL ONLY WORKS FOR THEM 
AND UH UH YOU CANNOT USE MY REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S TARGETED TO ME 
WHATEVER 
CHIP 
MILLIONS 
CHIP 
THE USER UH WELL JUST BE ABLE TO SAY UH PLEASE CAN YOU UH PUMP UP THE VO PUMP UP THE VOLUME OR OR IT WILL BE SOMETHING LIKE VOLUME 
UP DOWN 
OKAY 
OKAY 
COUPLE OF WORDS 
OKAY 
OF COURSE UH IT HAS TO BE 
OKAY 
BUT THEN I THINK YOU 
YOU 
FIRST OF ALL I I THINK THIS IS NOT UH FUNCTIONALITY THAT IT IS GOING TO BE INSTEAD OF USING THE BUTTONS 
IT'S ON TOP OF USING THE BUTTON 
WELL I DUNNO 
T. V. 
VERY EXPENSIVE NO 
AND VOLUME CONTROL 
SO BUT UH 
SH SHOULD WE TARGET A A USER PERSONALISED UH UH REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IN IN A GIVEN ROOM THERE MIGHT BE MORE THAN ONE REMOTE CONTROL 
WE WOULD UH HAVE EACH ONE AND UH WITH OUR OWN PERSONAL UH SETTINGS 
HMM 
YEAH OF COURSE 
THAT'S NO PROBLEM WE WILL SELL MORE 
YEAH EXACTLY 
OKAY 
THANKS 
MM GREAT 
DIFFICULT 
MM-HMM 
NO 
SPEAKERS IN THE REMOTE CONT 
OH YEAH 
IT JUST BEEPS 
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH 
SOMETHING VERY CHEAP 
BUT THAT'S EX THAT'S EXPENSIVE 
OH 
WELL I I HEARD OF DEVICES WHERE YOU JUST UH WHISTLE THEM AND AND THEY BECAUSE OF THE THE FREQUENCY THEY THEY JUST ANSWER TO THAT 
YOU CAN'T WHISTLE 
UH-HUH 
OR A CLIP 
YOU CAN CLIP 
CAN YOU 
CELP IS GOOD 
TAKE 
JUST A SUGGESTION 
WITH ONLY ONE HAND 
THESE ARE NOT OUR TARGET PEOPLE 
MM-HMM 
OH THAT'S E THAT ALREADY EXISTS OKAY OKAY 
OH YEAH YOU DO HAVE 
WOW 
YOU'RE TRENDY 
THINK ABOUT IT 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
GOOD WE'RE DONE 
RIGHT THANKS 
SAMMY BENJO 
I KNOW THIS NAME UH 
WE MET BEFORE 
F. F. FIVE 
AGREE 
R. S. I. MM-HMM 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
OKAY 
BUT TWENTY SIX PERCENT DO YOU KNOW 
TWENTY FIVE 
EVERY FOURTH YOU KNOW 
VERY FOR SOME OF US KNOWS 
ONE OF US 
MM-HMM 
FUNCTIONS 
MM-HMM 
I GOT ONE QUESTION UH YOU ARE A MARKET EXPERT SO SHOULD WE AIM AT THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT 
OKAY THEN TELETEXT IS USED LESS 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
THAT'S ME 
THAT'S ABOUT THIS BUT NUMBER THREE YES 
MM-HMM 
SO MY NAME IS MARK DWIGHT AND UM I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
HOWEVER UH MM PROJECT MANAGER ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU SOME PRESENTATION ABOUT TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
UH SO I'M A MORE AN ARTIST THAT'S GONNA BE LESS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS BUT MORE USER INTERFACE AND CURRENT INTENTIONS AND EVERYTHING WHICH IS LINKED WITH THIS 
SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE 
AND UH A GENERAL METHOD WHICH IS SEEMS TO BE VERY USEFUL FOR OUR TASK IS NOT TO FORGET ABOUT UH OCCAM RAZOR 
WE SHOULD NEVER COMPLICATE THINGS TOO MUCH 
WE SHOULD ONLY MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL NOTHING MORE 
NOTHING MORE THAN THIS JUST A REMOTE CONTROL 
'CAUSE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS THEY ARE NEVER EASY ENOUGH TO USE 
SO MAKE A CLICK PLEASE 
SO HERE IS THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S QUITE A STANDARD ONE BUT IT'S NOT FROM A T. V. IT'S FROM A MUCH 
SURE DEVICE LIKE AIR CONDITIONING OR SOMETHING 
BUT YOU KNOW WE CAN USE IT FOR A T. V. EASILY 
ONLY BUTTONS WE NEED IS ON OFF VOLUME CHANNELS AND MAYBE SOME OPTIONS OR SOMETHING ELSE AND PLEASE MAKE A CLICK COMPARED TO THIS ONE 
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU PREFER 
I GUESS THIS 
SURE SURE 
YEAH AND OUR METHOD IS GOING TO BE PROVIDE SIMPLE 
SIMPLE DESIRES INTO SIMPLE ACTIONS 
FINDINGS 
OR QUESTION OF THE STYLE WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT OUR COMPANY 
PUTS FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS 
AND WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT IT 
CONCEPT 
BE SIMPLE 
BE SIMPLE AND YOU'LL LEAN ON THIS MARKET 
MARKET IS A OF REMOTE CONTROLS YOU KNOW IT BETTER IT'S VERY 
WELL IT'S 
IT'S NOT AN EASY FIELD TO TO PLAY YOU KNOW 
SO BE SIMPLE 
FOR PERSONAL PREFERENCES I THINK THAT TO MAKE A BABY PROOF REMOTE CONTROL TO GET TO BE A TITANIUM 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD STYLE IT GOING TO BE LIKE LIKE LIKE THIS 
IT IS UNBREAKABLE AND IT IS VERY UNIVERSAL 
WE WE'LL HAVE A SCREEN WITH A BACK LIGHT WHICH CAN CHANGE COLOURS 
AND WE CAN PUT ALL THE OPTIONS INTO THIS SCREEN 
WE'LL NEED ONLY FEW BUTTONS 
ALL THE OTHER THINGS CAN BE CONTROLLED THROUGH THE SCREEN 
AND ALL THESE BUTTONS SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND NEED TO CLICK 'CAUSE WHEN YOU WATCH A MOVIE AND YOU WANT TO CHANGE SOMETHING 
YOU ALWAYS TRY TO FIND A GOOD BUTTON AND CLICK IT BUT YOU SHOULD DO IT BY TOUCHING IT AND FINDING IT EASILY JUST BY TOUCH 
SO 
PRESS 
I WOULD PROPOSE THIS CONCEPT FOR DESIGN JUST FEW BUTTONS A SCREEN WITH A BACK LIGHT WHICH CAN CHANGE COLOURS TITANIUM 
I THINK AND UH WHAT ELSE 
I GOT JUST VERY FEW AND GOOD IDEAS 
WE NEED POWER AND VOLUME 
AND LET US INCLUDE TWO NICE FEATURES INTO THIS DEVICE FIRST POWER ON AND OFF CAN BE MADE FULLY AUTOMATIC 
WHEN YOU GO TO THE SOFA TAKE YOUR CONTROL AND POINT TO TO THE T. V. 
THE T. V. TURNS ON 
WHEN YOU DON'T TOUCH THE CONTROL BUT YOU GO OUT OF THE 
FAIR FAIR ENOUGH TIME LIKE UH YOU 
IT'S A QUESTION TO OUR TECHNICAL DESIGN OR TWO ENGINEERS 
AND ANOTHER NICE AFTER THAT I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT IS UH VOLUME CONTROL 
SUPPOSE YOU SET U YOU SET UP SOME VOLUME AND THEN YOU MOVE IT OR YOU MOVE TO THE OTHER CORNER OF THE ROOM AND TAKE YOUR CONTROL WITH YOU 
LIKE YOU WANT TO TO CHANGE THE CHAIR OR YOU WANT TO MOVE TO THE ARMCHAIR FROM THE SOFA OR SOMETHING AND THEN THE VOLUME CHANGES 
IT'S EASY TO DO YOU JUST CONTROL THE 
ACCORDING TO THE DISTANCE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SO 
I THINK IT CAN BE JUST A MENU WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED WITH A LEFT RIGHT UP DOWN AND ENTER 
SO ITS MAIN PURPOSE IN FACT IS A BACK LIGHT WHICH CHANGE COLOURS WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO FIND 
AND CH CAN IT CAN RESPOND FOR YOUR VOICE LIKE IT CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT FOR YOU JUST TO F FIND IT EASILY YEAH 
SO BASICALLY THAT'S IT 
CAN BE EASILY DONE 'CAUSE 
YOU GOT SIMPLE DESIGNS Y WE SHOULD PUT IT IT SIMPLE ACTIONS 
LET IT BE UNIVERSAL SO YOU WANT TO USE IT FOR YOUR HI FI SYSTEM 
YOU WANT TO CHANGE TRACKS AND YOU WANT TO ADJUST VOLUME 
JUST FEW ACTIONS A FEW ACTIONS FOR EVERYTHING 
ALL THE REST WE SH WE'LL PUT IT INTO THIS MENU ON THE SCREEN 
OKAY OKAY 
OKAY BUT IT'S QUITE UNIVERSAL YOU KNOW 
WE CAN JUST EXTEND IT IT ANY DEVICE 
UH TWENTY FIVE 
MM-HMM 
IN FACT I WOULD PROPOSE ANOTHER SOLUTION 
BASICALLY YOU USE JUST FOR OUR FIVE CHANNELS RIGHT 
YEAH 
SO UH SET UP YOUR T. V. SET LIKE CHANNELS THAT YOU SEE THEY'RE IN 
TWO THREE AND FIVE AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO GO TO A TWENTY FIVES CHANNEL 
MM-HMM 
MM 
WE GOT THESE BUTTONS HERE 
NEXT NEXT 
OR SAY THIS CAN BE BACK 
COULD WE CARRY OUT SOME RESEARCH IF WE WE REALLY NEED THIS 
LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO GO TO CHANNEL NUMBER TWENTY FIVE AND THEN TO SIXTY FOUR 
OKAY 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION 
TOO COMPLEX 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM 
OKAY 
NO YOU KNOW IT'S A CONCEPTUAL QUESTION 
'CAUSE NOW I SEE THE THIS THE PICTURE IN FRONT OF MY EYES LIKE A USER TAKING HIS REMOTE CONTROL AND SHOUTING INTO IT 
VOLUME UP VOLUME UP AND AND HE'S COMING YOU KNOW HE'S REALLY ANNOYED WITH THIS DOWN UP DOWN 
OKAY FOR THIS BUDGET LIKE TWELVE EUROS 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
DID YOU CONSIDER THE R GEST UH GESTURE RECOGNITION 
LIKE IF I WANT TO PUT VOLUME UP I LIKE DO MM I TAKE MY REMOTE CONTROL DO LIKE SOMETHING LIKE 
ROLL 'EM UP OR ROLL 'EM DOWN 
MM WHY 
THAT'S JUST 
WE GOT A REALLY GOOD MARKET EXPERT 
LET'S SEND MORE LET'S SELL MORE 
OKAY 
UH SHOULD TO BE EQUIPPED WITH THE 
UH WITH UH SPEAKERS 
LIKE YOU WANT TO FIND IT YOU SHEET 
CONTROL AND IT ANSWERS SO I'M HERE 
OR 
JUST BEEPS 
I CAN'T WHISTLE 
NO NO I CAN'T 
MM 
OKAY 
JUST DON'T INTERFERE WITH OTHER DEVICES LIKE 'CAUSE LIKE ALL THESE PEOPLE DO THAT THEIR LIGHTS ARE TURNING ON WITH CLAPPING 
YEAH I GOT TO TO MY HOME LIKE 
OOPS 
YEAH IT IS PUT F. FIVE 
THE FULL PAGE PRESENTATION YEP 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU CAN YOU ARE 
HMM 
YEAH IT'S ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES OR SOMETHING KIND OF MAYBE UH EFFECT 
YEAH BECAUSE INFRARED USES SOME ELECTROMAGNETIC TECHNOLOGY AND THOSE WAVES HAVE HIGH 
OH 
OH 
YEAH IT'S 
PEOPLE REALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
HMM 
YEAH 
'CAUSE 
THANK YOU 
MM 
MM 
MM YEP 
THANK YOU 
UH IT'S 
TECHNI FUNCTION OF 
YEAH 
I HAVE TO DO WORKING DESIGN IS UH 
MM 
IT'S 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE IT CAN BE YEAH MIDDLE OF LIKE BETWEEN THESE TWO LI 
SO YOU SHOULD YEAH 
MM 
DISTANCE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH AND IT MM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
BUT EVEN WE CAN HAVE SOME UH L. C. D. DISPLAY LIKE YOU CAN UH DO YOU CAN JUST BUTTON THE NUMBER AND THEN TO GO TO BECAUSE 
YEAH 
BUT STILL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT OTHERWISE LIKE WE CAN PUT SOME DISPLAY ON NUMBERS AND THEN THEY CAN JUST PRESS SUPPOSE TWO FIVE THEY JUST PRESS TWO AND FIVE AND THEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH BUT SINCE WE ARE FOCUSING ONLY ON T. V. REMOTE CONTROLS AS WE CAN HAVE MORE FUNCTIONS FOR T. V. UH IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR A UNIVERSAL THEN WE OUGHT TO LIMIT FOR FUNCTIONS FOR EACH OF OUR DEVICES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TWO 
YEAH OF 
SORRY 
YEAH 
UH SO YOU KNOW I AM MISTER RAMARO 
I AM AN EXPERT ON UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN OF ALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND I PREVIOUSLY DEVISED MANY UH LIKE DIGITAL CALCULATORS AND ELECTRONIC CALCULATORS 
SO NOW I'LL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE WORKING DESIGN OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
WELL AS YOU KNOW THE BASIC FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS SENDING SOME MESSAGE TO THE THE DEVICE LIKE T. V. OR V. C. R. OR D. V. D. PLAYER ETCETERA 
SO WE WILL HAVE A P PORTABLE DEVICE WHICH WILL SEND MESSAGE TO THE THE MAIN DEVICE LIKE T. V. 
SO WE NEED TO HAVE SOME ENERGY SOURCE TO DO WHAT TO DO THE FUNCTIONS WHAT WE WANT IN THIS PORTABLE DEVICE 
AND USUALLY THIS IS TO DO THESE FUNCTIONS WE NEED AN INTERFACE WHICH BASICALLY SOME KIND OF PRESSING BUTTONS OR KEYS ARE LIKE MOVING JACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND THEN THESE MESSAGES THESE KEY BUTTONS CAN BE TRANSFERRED INTO SOME KIND OF MESSAGE AND THEN IT WILL PROCESS BY THE CHIP AND THEN IT WILL GENERATE SOME INFORMATION TO THE MAIN DEVICE 
IT'S GENERALLY IN THE FORM OF INFRARED OR 
SOME KIND OF S SENSOR INFORMATION 
THEN WE WILL HAVE THE MAIN CONTROL IN THE MAIN DEVICE TO DO THE PARTICULAR ACTION WHAT WE WANT 
SO BASICALLY WE NEED UH SINCE WE ARE FOCUSING ON OUR INTERFACE DEVICE REMOTE CONTROL WE NEED FEW COMPONENTS 
MAINLY THE ENERGY SOURCE LIKE THE BATTERY AND THEN WE HAVE USER INTERFACE LIKE UH THE KEYPAD AND YOU KNOW BUTTONS WE WANT 
AND THEN WE HAVE SOME CHIP 
IT'S MAINLY DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING CHIP BECAUSE SINCE WE ARE I AM ONE DOING MOSTLY DIGITAL UH DEVICES WE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF PROCESSOR WHICH TAKE CARE OF ALL THESE FUNCTIONS AND PUT IT IN SOME DIGITAL FORMAT 
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THE INFRARED L. E. D. SOURCE WHICH SENDS THE INFORMATION TO THE MAIN DEVICE 
THEN WE'LL HAVE SWITCH ON OUR MAIN UH UM DEVICE TO DO PARTICULAR OPERATIONS AND WE OUGHT TO DO DIFFERENT CODES FOR DIFFERENT T. V. S 
SO SOME T. V. S WILL HAVE DIFFERENT ENCRYPTION CODES FOR DOING IS IS UH CHANNEL CHANGING AND THESE THINGS 
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE THE PEOPLE DON'T USE ONE PARTICULAR BRAND AS OR AT LEAST WE HAVE MORE MORE THAN FIVE BRANDS WHICH ARE REALLY GOOD 
SO WE NEED TO CHECK THEIR SPECIFICATIONS AND DO THEIR UH ENCRYPTION THAT'S PASSING INFORMATION TO THE T. V. DEVICE 
SO WE NEED TO HAVE PARTICULAR ENCRYPTION CODES 
THEN COMPONENTS 
SO WE HAVE THE MENU UH ENERGY SOURCE AND THEN WE WILL HAVE SOME BUTTONS AND THEN WE WILL HAVE INFRARED UH SOURCE AND THEN WE HAVE SOME INSIDE SOME CHIP ON ON THE DEVICE 
UH SINCE I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME SO I'LL INPUT THE CONNECTIONS TO ALL THOSE COMPONENTS 
AND SINCE I ALSO WANT TO KNOW FEEDBACK FROM OUR MARKETING EXPERT AND USER INTERFACE SO IF YOU WANT TO ADD SOME MORE COMPONENTS WE CAN INCORPORATE THEM 
YEAH 
YEAH I'M SURE BECAUSE SINCE OUR USER INTERFACE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND ALSO MARKETING EXPERT FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS REALLY HANDY 
SO WE CAN HAVE ANOTHER LIKE UH S SIMPLE SPEECH RECOGNISER IN OUR D. S. B. CHIP 
SINCE WE HAVE SOME KIND OF UH ENERGY THIS IS OR 
THIS NORMAL BATTERY IS THIS BATTERY 
ONCE YOU S SWITCH ON IT WILL TAKE POWER AND WE CAN HAVE SOME SPEECH RECOGNITION AND ONE OR G GENERALLY SMALL DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING CHIP IS THAT AND WE WILL PUT UH THE SMALL UH SIMPLE SPEECH RECOGNISER AND WE CAN ALSO TURN THE SPEECH RECOGNISER FOR PARTICULAR USER IS YOU JUST YEAH 
SO THAT WE JUST USE SIMPLE RECOG NO BUT BUT 
YEAH 
NO EVEN IN YOU CAN FIND EVEN SIMPLE MOBILE DEVICE LIKE ANY MOBILE BRAND YOU CAN HAVE THIS VOICE DIALERS OR THESE THINGS YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
UH MAYBE WE CAN MAKE UH IT IN FIVE EUROS AND EVEN LESS THAN THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE UH MILLIONS AND IN BULK 
SO WE CAN MAKE REALLY SIMP AND WE WANT TO MAKE REALLY SIMPLE DEVICE BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY VERY FEW WORDS LIKE LIKE POWER 
SWITCH ON OR SOME LIKE THEN WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS UM 
WE'LL HAVE VOLUME 
AND THEN WE WILL HAVE S PARTICULAR CHANNEL SO USERS CAN LISTEN 
YOU 
NO YEAH A USER CAN SEE ANY KIND OF SENDER BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE THIS PROMPT VOLUME AND THEN YEAH VOLUME AND DECREASE OR INCREASE 
SO WE TRY TO ONLY RECOGNISE THOSE WORDS AND AND BECAUSE WE CAN'T REALLY EASY EASIER TO SAY SAME WORDING THEN IT BECOME MORE MECHANICAL AND YEAH 
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE CHANNEL THEY CAN SAY OKAY I WANT EIGHT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW LIKE USERS HAVE DIFFERENT PROGRAMMES 
I MEAN THEY DON'T REALLY FOLLOW SOME CHANNELS STRICT UH SO WE JUST WANT CHANNEL NUMBER WE DON'T WANT LIKE B. B. C. OR C. N. N. OR SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE 
IT WILL BE COMPLICATED SO WE'LL HAVE ONLY THESE OTHER UH MAIN BASIC UH ANYWAY VOLUME IS NOT REALLY SPEECH RECOGNITION PROBLEM 
IT'S IT IT WILL BE TAKE CARE OF OUR MAIN MM 
YEAH ACTUALLY WE WE CAN HAVE ONE SWITCH IT LIKE UH SWITCH ON ON AND OFF THIS PROCESSOR AND 
THIS REALLY SUPPOSE LIKE HERE WE HAVE OUR MAIN CHIP WHICH CONTROLS POWER VOLUME AND THIS PART AND THIS D. S. P. S 
AGAIN THIS TO HAVE SOME INTERACTION LIKE SUPPOSE PEOPLE USE D. S. P. THEN IT PARTICULARLY SENDS SOME INFORMATION TO THE CHIP LIKE IN SOME FORM 
LIKE VOLUME AND LIKE THIS OKAY 
SO IT MAY NOT BE LIKE VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE SINCE WE ARE ONLY FOCUSING ON T. V. REMOTE CONTROL IS AND WE HAVE ONLY FEW THINGS HERE 
YEAH 
UM UH UH THIS POINT WE DIDN'T CONSIDER BECAUSE IT'S IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE V OUR TARGET IS ONLY LIKE TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS AND 
YEAH EVEN AUTOMATIC ON OFF IS ALSO A BIT PROBLEMATIC 
BECAUSE IT DIFFERENT CRITERIA FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE LIKE S SUPPOSE PEOPLE ARE REALLY UH THEY JUST UH THEY DON'T TOUCH THE REMOTE AND MM YOU YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME YOU NEED TO SWITCH ON OR SWITCH OFF AND 
YAY YEAH 
YEAH THAT CAN BE POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY FOR POWER SETTINGS SO USER CAN SAY OKAY 
SUPPOSE THEY'RE WATCHING A TENNIS MATCH OR SOMETHING THEN THEY CAN SAY OKAY UH AFTER ONE HERE I 
THEY CAN MAKE 
YEAH WE CAN HAVE 
YEAH 
UH NOT VERY MUCH LIKE YEAH 
THANK YOU 
YEP 
THANK YOU 
CAN YOU JUST YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
MARK WILL 
UH IT'S IN CURRENT PRICE YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT SPEECH RECOGNISER CAN BE POSSIBLE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH ESPECIALLY THE POWER IT REALLY CONSUMES BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE ALL THE TIME ON AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK IT'S GOOD 
BUT IT'S A GOOD FEATURE I GUESS YEAH WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT MORE HOW TO INCORPORATE IT 
OH 
UH IT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THANK YOU THINK YOU VERY MUCH 
OKAY SO NOW WE ARE IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING 
UH YOU GETTING CLOSE TO THE LAST IS THE PENULTIM MEETING 
MM GREAT 
SO UM I WILL AGAIN DO THE SECRETARY PART UH WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTATION FIRST UM UH THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN FIRST RAMA THEN MARK AND THEN SAMMY 
UM UM WE HAVE TO TAKE A DECISION ON THE CONTROL REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS AND WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES 
SO WHAT WE WANT TO THE DECISION WE WANT TO TAKE IN THIS MEETING ARE IN THE UM FIRST ON THE COMPONENT CONCEPT 
SO WHAT KIND OF ENERGY WE USE UH WHAT KIND OF CHIP ON PRINT AND ONE KI KIND OF CASE 
AND ALSO IN USER INTERFACE CONCEPT UH WHAT KIND OF INTERFACE WE USE AND IF THERE IS SOME SUPPLEMENTS 
AND AT THE AND UM SAMMY WILL GIVE ME A TREND WATCHING ON WHAT HE'S HE'S BEEN DOING 
IT'S 
SO LET'S GO 
FIRST 
WITH ROOM 
PARTICIPANT TWO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM OKAY 
UM I WANT TO KNOW WHY TO BE UH JUST UH SORRY BUT FOR THE POINT BEFORE UH WHY NOT THE RUBBER 
IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IT SEEMS TO BE LIGHT 
OKAY 
YOU M TITANIUM IT'S MORE UH 
YES SO MM 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OH YEAH SO 
OKAY SO SO SIMPLE BUTTON AND UH SPEECH RECOGNITION FOR THE MORE COMPLICATED 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY FOR THE LOCATION 
HMM 
OKAY 
SO LET'S NOW GO TO THE YOU DON'T HAVE MORE QUESTION 
UM MM THANK YOU MM 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT MM 
OKAY 
UM YEAH 
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT UH INTERFACE 
THERE 
WHICH ONE 
OKAY 
MM 
NO 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
MM-HMM 
BECAUSE APPARENTLY FROM YOUR SURVEY PEOPLE LIKE COLOURS ON 
OKAY 
SO 
UH-HUH OKAY SO YOU YOU PROPOSE SOMETHING WITH OPTION I THAT INCREASE THE PRICE IF WE IF YOU WANT O MORE COLOURS AN L. C. D. YEAH 
OKAY 
AND THERMODYNAMIC ALSO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT THAT'S MAYBE ME TOO MUCH EXPENSIVE YEAH 
BUT UH IT CAN BE IN UH MAYBE IN IN A GRADABLE VERSION BUT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY AND YOU THINK THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT MAKE THEM PAY MORE BECAUSE OF UH O OR THIS IS 
OKAY SO 
SO I IT'S NOT UH A S BASE SERVICE IT'S A 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
SO UM SO MAYBE THAT'S OF THAT IT'S A SELLING POINT MAYBE IT HAS TO BE THE BASE 
AND YOU'LL BE DIFFERENT 
UH IN THE TRAIN UH HELLO UH NO 
WANT TO CHANGE MY NEIGHBOUR 
MM 
MM-HMM 
IRADIUM 
OH SORRY 
MM 
OKAY 
SO MM 
MM-HMM 
MM THAT'S A NICE WORLD 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO IT'S YEAH MARKETING EXPERT 
PARTICIPANT TWO 
FOUR SORRY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
SO 
SO MAYBE TITANIUM IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA 
MM-HMM 
UM SORRY MARK 
IT SEEMS TO BE 
MM MM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
YOU'RE OLD FASHIONED 
SORRY 
OKAY 
MM YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

OKAY 
NO MORE QUESTION 
OKAY 
SO 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO WE WILL HAVE UH NEXT MEETING IN THIRTY MINUTES AGAIN 
UM NOW YOU HAVE TO GO STRAIGHT ON THIS INDIVIDUAL ACTION WHICH I WHICH ARE FOR RAMA UH WIL DESIGN 
UM MARK THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND UH SAMMY UH THE PRODUCT EVALUATION 
UH YOU WILL WORK TOGETHER UH IN A NEW ONE IN A PROTOTYPE USING MODELLING CLAY 
MM-HMM UM 
AND I IS ALWAYS YOUR PERSONAL COACH WILL SEND YOU SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT YOU HAVE TO 
SO YOU SAY SO 
SO DO WE AGREE ON THAT 
YEAH 
WE HAVE TO 
NO 
OKAY THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
SO TITANIUM SMELL LIKE FRUIT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
I I AGREE WITH UH THIS UH 
NOW WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WHAT KIND OF FANCINESS 
DO WE TAKE TITANIUM SMELLING LIKE FRUIT OR DO WE MAKE SPONGY 
UH FORTY LIKE 
MM 
YEAH YEAH 
DON'T YOU SAY THAT YOU CANNOT DO DOUBLE SHAPE UH CURVED SHAPE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM MM 
OKAY SO YOU EXPLORE NOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER THESE THESE TWO 
OR OR SPONGY ONE YEAH 
MM 
MM 
YEAH I DON'T THINK WE I THINK WE HAVE TO CHOOSE 
IF WE CHOOSE UH TITANIUM OR IF WE CHOOSE SPONGY BUT UH IT CANNOT BE BOTH 
UH YOU CAN PRETEND THAT IT'S UH TITANIUM 
YEAH D DON'T WORRY YOU YOU YOU SPEAK WITH MM MM 
OKAY 
SO EXPLORE A SHAPE 
MM I THINK IT'S WHAT WE SAY THAT WE HAVE AN UH AN L. C. D. WITH UH INFORMATION 
NOT UH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SO ARE WE MM 
OKAY 
SO SO YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES 
MM-HMM 
THANKS DON'T BE SARCASTIC 
MARK 
UH ROOM 
OH 
MM-HMM 
WHAT IS A DOUBLE CURVED SHAPE 
UH-HUH 
THE COST 
MM LIKE THIS 
MM-HMM 
SPEECH 
L. C. D. 
SEEMS NOT IT'S EITHER L. C. D. OR PUSH BUTTON 
OH 
THE L. C. D. WOULD 
THE DISPLAY WOULD ONLY BE DISPLAY AND NOT UH TOUCH SENSITIVE YOU MEAN 
JUST UH FOR OUTPUT YEAH 
YEAH 
I GUESS ON UM 
SO THE BATTERIES UH ARE GOING TO BE VERY LIGHT 
OKAY 
SO THIS DEVICE IN IN THAT CAN BE USED FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION COULD ALSO BE USED FOR JUST UH THE FINDING IT BASICALLY 
INSTEAD OF CLAPPING WHY NOT JUST BE ASK 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
NO IT'S OKAY 
PUTS LESS OF CONSTRAINT ON WHAT WE CAN DO BUT 
IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT 
WE HAVE DREAMS AND THE ON THE END WE FIND OUT THAT IT'S NOT FEASIBLE 
ANYWAY 
YEAH 
L. C. D. 
L. S. D. S SOMETHING ELSE AND IT'S QUITE NICE AS WELL 
SO GO ON UH ARTIST 
HMM 
LET'S CHANGE MILLENNIUMS 
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE 
THIS IS VERY UGLY 
UH ONE TOO MUCH CONCEPT 
OH 
UH BACK TODAY 
DO YOU THINK IT CAN COME ON SEVERAL COLOURS 
OR DID THE 
UM BUT NOT THE CASE 
UH THE CASE WOULD ONLY BE IN THAT UH ALUMINIUM UH TITANIUM STUFF LIKE 
YEAH WELL THEY LIKE UH SOMETHING WHICH IS UH 
MM YEAH OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE THE OPTION 
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE A NOKIA PHONE BUT 
I DON'T SEE THAT BUT AGAIN UH I MIGHT 
YEAH BU BUT 
MM-HMM 
KIND OF UPGRADABLE UH REMOTE CONTROL 
WOW WOW 
MM 
LIKE A CHAMELEON 
MM-HMM 
BECAUSE UH I THINK THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE 
THIS FOR WHICH THE REMOTE CONTROL IS UH 
SO TO BE UH SOMETHING USEFUL UH I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS LATER BUT AND THIS FOR WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT UH SO UH SPECIFIC TO THEM IS IT IT'S LIKE A SIGNATURE 
MY REMOTE CONTROL IS PINK 
NOBODY ELSE THAN UM HAS A PINK REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THAT MAKES ME SPECIAL 
I THINK I THINK THEY WOULD BE READY P READY TO PAY MORE FOR THAT 
THOSE WHO WANTED TO HAVE TO PINK 
NO MM NO 
IT MIGHT BE OPTIONAL YEAH 
THE THE YOUNG PEOPLE THE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THEIR FRIENDS 
ALTHOUGH SIMILAR BUT HAVE SOMETHING JUST SLIGHTLY BETTER 
PINK 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YOU ALWAYS HAVE YOUR REMOTE 
UH YOU DON'T 
YEAH 
YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR ROOM 
WH Y YOU KNOW LIKE FOR INSTANCE TAKE THE IPOD 
IT'S A KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL 
UH IT'S WHAT AND IT'S SO WHAT THAT YOU USE IT FROM ANY ANYWHERE 
IT HAS THIS DISTINCTIVE LOOK AND FEEL AND LIKE WHICH PEOPLE SEEMS TO LIKE JUST BECAUSE IT'S A CLEAR THAT WE DON'T USUALLY USE IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
WHAT 
SEEMS IMPORTANT 
MM GLOW IN THE DARK SO 
OKAY 
YEAH 
UH-HUH YEAH SURE 
WELL SO I HEARD THAT UH IT SEEMS THAT SPEECH RECOGNITION IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE UH SO THAT'S THE SMARTNESS OF THE THING 
CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE GUNS WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION OR UH BEER CANS WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT WE MAY HAVE REMOTE CONTROLS WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION 
I DUNNO 
DON'T TOUCH THE REMOTE 
BUT YEAH 
OR OR YOU SAYING HERE THAT UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHO IS USING IT 
SO FOR INSTANCE THE YOUNG GUY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE IT BECAUSE HIS FATHER DOESN'T WANT 
LIKE WITH SOME 
MAYBE FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION OR 
MM 
UM 
MM 
OKAY 
SO IT COULD BE 
SMART IN THAT WAY 
BUT FOR INSTANCE TH I I'M THINKING ABOUT THE OTHER UH UH PARTICULARITY THAT THE THE REMOTE CONTROL COULD HAVE 
SO SINCE IT IT KNOWS WHO IS USING IT 
IT MIGHT ALSO RECORD THE KIND OF UH CHANNELS YOU ARE U MORE OFTEN USING AND UH LEVELS OF VOLUMES THAT YOU'RE MORE OFTEN UH THINGS LIKE THAT AND PROVIDE YOU WAYS OF USING THEM 
I DUNNO SOMEHOW I DUNNO THAT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE BUT 
THAT MIGHT ALSO BE A GOOD SALES PITCH AGAIN 
THE REMOTE THAT KNOWS YOU 
MY TURN 
OKAY IT'S ALRIGHT 
FOR I THINK 
TREND YEAH 
NO UH YES 
OKAY SO I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TRENDS AND UM I HOPE THIS CAN HELP US TO TO UNDERSTAND L HOW WE SHOULD DESIGN OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE 
SO FIRST MAYBE JUST A SMALL RECAP ON HOW HOW DO WE WATCH TRENDS SO IT'S NOT SO UH SIMPLE YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IT'S EASY BUT UH IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE 
ANYWAY THESE DAYS UH THE BEST UH SOURCE OF INFORMATION IS THE WEB AS YOU KNOW SO HAVE TO 
TO GO OFTEN IN THE WEB AND LOOK AT UH WHAT THE OTHERS ARE DOING 
AND ASK REAL PEOPLE WHO ARE USING REAL REMOTE CONTROLS EVERY DAY UH OR ANY OTHER TOOL THAT IS SIMILAR TO A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH BASICALLY IS A SMALL DEVICE THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH THEM 
ALWAYS LIKE A PHONE 
WE CAN WE CAN USE THE PHONE IS A AS A GOOD UH UH EXAMPLE OF WHERE IT IN BE INSPIRED 
OF COURSE THIS THE D WHO ARE WATCHING THE TRENDS ARE ALSO HAVE ALSO TO BE INSPIRED BECAUSE IN FACT THEY'RE NOT ONLY WATCHING THE TRENDS 
THEY'RE INVENTING IT THEY'RE CREATING THE TREND 
I HOPE I'M GOING TO TRY TO HELP YOU IN THAT 
THIS IS MORE RISKY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE TREND YOU TRY TO INVENT IT 
WHICH MEANS EITHER YOU SUCCEED AND YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OR YOU DON'T NEED YOU'RE OUT OF BUSINESS 
SO ANYWAY UH NEXT SLIDE PLEASE 
UH TO BE TO BE QUICK THERE'S A LOT OF WORDS HERE BUT UH BASICALLY THERE ARE UH IN IN THE MARKET OF OF REMOTE CONTROLS THERE ARE OTHER ASPECTS THAT WE SHOULD VERY PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO 
THE FIRST ONE WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS THAT IT HAS TO BE FANCY IT HAS TO HAVE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
AND UH INTERESTINGLY THIS IS THE VERY MOST IMPORTANT THING 
IT HAS TO BE FANCY 
STRANGELY ENOUGH IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO BE FANCY THEN TO BE W AND NOW THAT'S THE SECOND THING IT HAS TO BE IT HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY I INNOVATIVE 
IT HAS TO BE NOW WITH SOME OF UH NEW UH TECHNOLOGY INSIDE AND UH AND THIS IS ALSO UH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LAST THING WHICH WE WE MAY THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT 
WHICH IS THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE AND IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE AS A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO SO YOU USE UH AT FIRST HAVE TO BE VERY NICE 
SO SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE PROUD OF UH UH THAT I UH THEY CAN BE ID IDENTIFIED WITH UH AND AND THEN UH SOMETHING THAT UM CONTAINS VERY NOVEL STUFF THAT THEY CAN TALK ABOUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS 
HUH MINE HAS THIS AND NOT YOURS 
AND FINALLY OF COURSE IT HAS TO BE USEFUL AS A REMOTE CONTROL BUT IT SEEMS THAT IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT THAT IT'S USEFUL AS A REMOTE CONTROL 
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE 
UH AND NOW IN A MORE UH GENERAL UH UH BROAD WAY OF USING THE UH THE THING 
IF WE LOOK BACK AND NOT UH LOOK AT ONLY REMOTE CONTROLS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO USE THAT THE TRENDS ARE QUITE THE SAME IN MANY AREAS SO CURRENTLY THE THE TRENDS THAT WE USE IN LE NA LE BIG CITIES LIKE PARIS AND MILAN 
WELL IT SEEMS THAT THIS YEAR THINGS SHOULD HAVE UH A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE UH WAY OF OF LIKE OUR FILE OR SO 
AND I THINK OF COURSE UH I IT APPEALS TO EVERYTHING 
THAT'S THE THING WITH TRENDS 
IT IT CAN TRAVEL F FROM CLOTHE TO FURNITURE SAME IDEA 
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE 
THINK FRUIT AND VEGETABLE 
AND UH IF WE C WE COMPARE TO LAST YEAR NOW IT HAS TO BE SPONGY YEAH 
WELL THIS IS SO I THINK UH UH I 
WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RUBBER I THINK UH THE RUBBER ASPECT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT IS PROBABLY MORE FEASIBLE IN TERMS OF SPONGINESS 
SEEMS NOT SEEMS NOT 
YEAH 
SO 
THINK MORE OF UH SOMETHING ON THE COLOURS OF UH LIKE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES AND SPONGY 
IS A EVEN IN THE SHAPE IT HAS TO BE MORE ROUND AND UH 
MORE UH UH LOOK NATURAL SOMEHOW 
I MEAN 
AND NOT THOSE FUTURISTIC UH REMOTE CONTROL WITH ANGLES AND UH AND TITANIUM LOOK 
SO THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SEEM TO YEAH I I KNOW IT'S QUITE FAR FROM WHAT YOU THOUGHT BUT THAT'S THAT'S FASHION AND 
OKAY THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY 
THIS I'M SORRY 
YEAH YEAH WE HAVE PEOPLE UH UH LISTENING TO THE TRENDS EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD OF COURSE 
SO YOU KNOW OUR COMPANY IS QUITE BIG AND UH SO I'M JUST ASKING THEM WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS ACCORDING TO THEM WHEN THEY GO ON THE STORES AND WHEN THEY ASK UH THERE UH FRIENDS THAT ARE ALSO WELL 
NO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THIS THIS IS VERY GENERAL YEAH 
BUT IT SEEMS THAT TRENDS TRAVEL ACROSS THINGS 
THE WHAT WE 
SURE 
YEAH 
WE HAVE TO I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE THE LOOK OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES BUT WE STILL HAVE TO PUT OUR CHIPS INSIDE IS OF COURSE 
THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM 
THIS IS NOT MINE 
YEAH I THINK IN THE COLOURS AND IN THE UH THE KIND OF MATERIAL 
IF IF IT'S SOMETHING LIKE RUBBER MADE OR I THINK IT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE GOOD 
OKAY 
YEP 
THANKS 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
THANKS 
SPONGY 
NO WE DON'T HAVE TO BUT SEEMS IT'S THE TREND 
AGAIN SO I SAID WE CAN ALSO TRY TO MAKE IT TO CREATE THE TREND 
SO THERE'S NO 
WELL THAT'S YOU IT CAN TRY TO CONVINCE US 
OKAY 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA I 
OH 
I THINK I YEAH I IT'S AGAIN IN THIS UH WHAT I SAID FIRST IT HAS TO BE FANCY AS I THINK IF NOBODY ELSE PRO PROVIDES CURRENTLY A REMOTE CONTROL WITH THAT KIND OF STUFF AND IF WE CAN PROVIDE IT I THINK IT'S A GOOD SELL FOR US BECAUSE WE HAVE TO AND OTHERS DON'T 
IT'S FANCY 
WHETHER IT'S USEFUL OR NOT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE VERY IMPORTANT 
MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLORE THE TWO OPTION 
MM 
SEEMS TO BE 
IF YOU HAVE TIME 
FOR CREATION 
YOU CAN PAINT IT AFTERWARD 
NO PROBLEM 
WE HAVE A VERY LARGE DEPARTMENT OF POINT 
YOU WILL DO IT 
YEAH 
THE THING IS THAT UH IF WE WANT TO HAVE SO HE SAYS IF WE WANT TO HAVE UH A SMALL NUMBER OF BUTTONS WE NEED TO HAVE A KIND OF OUTPUT THAT SAYS CURRENTLY WHAT THEIR ACTIONS OR 
YEAH 
THAT'S THE CONVERSE TO HAVING ZILLIONS OF BUTTON WHERE EACH BUTTON DOES ONLY ONE THING 
YEAH 
CLASSICAL WE STAY CLASSICAL IN THAT WE DON'T REINVENT UH THE WHOLE 
ANYWAY IT'S VERY IN GENERAL I THINK PEOPLE UH CHANGE T. V. MORE OFTEN THAN BATTERIES OF THEIR REMOTE CONTROL 
SO 
BECAUSE THE TREND GOES FASTER THAN THE LIFE OF THE 
SO IT'S VERY 
OKAY 
WE'RE DONE 
HOW WAS LUNCH 
MM 
WHY 
MM-HMM 
WE WE CAN SEE SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE BODY'S TITANIUM BUT THERE ARE SOME RUBBER OR I DUNNO SOME RUBBER PARTS LIKE TO MAKE IT FEEL BETTER AND IT YOU KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY AND STILL WE HAVE MM CAN WE STILL INCLUDE THE L. L. S. D. DISPLAY 
L. C. D. YEAH L. C. D. 
NO IT'S NOT GONNA BE A T NO TOUCHABLE BUT STILL LIKE A SOURCE OF INFORMATION OR SOURCE FOR MENUS 
OKAY SO LET'S TRY TO LET'S IT 
YEAH YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT GONNA BE A TOUCH PAD UH JUST A DISPLAY FOR GIVING YOU INFORMATION 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO MORE QUESTIONS 
MM YEAH YEAH 
BUT STILL UH L. S. D. 'S ALREADY QUITE NICE L. C. I'M AN ARTIST SORRY 
SO UH THAT'S NOT I HOPE THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH 
OKAY 
UH PARTICIPANT NUMBER THREE 
OH 
MM 
MM UH HAVE A LOOK AT THIS ONE IT'S YEAH 
UH IS THE CONCEPT OF THE INTERFACE 
GENERALLY I DEVELOPED QUITE A BROAD CONCEPT NOT ONLY FOR THE INTERFACE BUT FOR 
POSSIBLE INSTRUCTION OR USER'S MANUAL AND UH ALL THE COMPLEX THINGS THAT COME TOGETHER WITH YOUR T. V. AND REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO LET'S START WITH THIS 
WE GOT OUR PERFECT REMOTE CONTROL WITH A LOT OF BUTTONS AND UH WE GOT EXPLANATION FOR EVERY BUTTON AND YOU CAN USE YOUR TIME AND UH IT WILL TAKE I SOME DAYS TO LEARN ALL THESE BUTTONS AND UM THE L. C. D. IS GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE HERE 
AND UH GO BACK BUTTON I DON'T KNOW REALLY WHERE IT SO MAYBE ONE OF THESE BUTTONS 
AND UM POWER ON AND OFF MM I I DON'T REMEMBER SO UH IT IT IT SHOULD BE MAYBE THIS BUTTON IS POWER ON AND OFF 
OR NO 
I CAN SEE NOTHING 
SO THAT'S OUR CONCEPT 
IT'S CALLED THE MILLENNIUM REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
REALLY 
I THOUGHT YOU LOOK AT 
OH OKAY JUST PRESS THE BUTTON PLUS UH 
YEAH WE WILL NOT SO THIS 
WE WILL NOT SO THIS 
BUT INSTEAD OF THIS I WILL DEVISE THAT'S OUR CONCEPT 
AND IT'S GOT JUST FEW BUTTONS QUITE LOW LOOKING AND ALL THIS STUFF WE ALREADY 
WE ALREADY DISCUSSED 
AND UH WHAT WILL PEOPLE SAY 
THEY'LL SAY IT'S PERFECT 
OR WHAT WILL SAY 
UH THEY WILL SAY IT'S SPLENDID 
AND UH E EVERYONE WILL SAY I'LL BUY IT 
AND EVERYONE'S GONNA BE SATISFIED 
I WOULD MAKE A BACKLIGHT OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS 
NOT THE CASE 
YEAH 
OKAY SO LET'S REMEMBER THERE'S A NOKIA PHONE WHICH CHANGEABLE PANELS 
DO YOU LOOK AT 
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
THAT'S WHY 'CAUSE IT'S NASTY 
NO 
UM I AM HERE 
MM-HMM 
'KAY 
OKAY WHAT UH THERE'S NO MORE DECISI UH ONE MORE SOLUTION IN FACT 
UM 'CAUSE THERE ARE SOME SOME POINTS THAT CAN CHANGE COLOUR ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE LIKE THEY CAN REFLECT DIFFERENT COLOURS 
DEPENDING ON WHAT IS AROUND LIKE WHAT COLOUR IS AROUND AND DEPENDING ON THE TEMPERATURE YEAH 
WE CAN MAKE IT IN FACT 
IF IF IF THE OKAY 
MM-HMM MM-HMM SO 
UH-HUH 
SO BE AN OPTION YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT YOU JUST TAKE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WITH YOU ALL THE TIME 
AND IT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT YOU KNOW 
ANYONE HAS THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS HERE 
NO 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UH-HUH UH-HUH 
COULD WE INTEGRATE SOMETHING INTO OUR REMOTE CONTROL SOMETHING LIKE LIGHT 
THAT THEY CAN USE IT IN DARKNESS LIKE 
HAND LIGHT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
AS WELL LET'S GO ON MAYBE WITH THE PRESENTATION 
AND UM THE REMOTE CONTROL'S GOING TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW SMART SHOULD TO BE TOO NOT TO COMPLICATE THINGS TOO MUCH 
AND UH 
I DUNNO THAT'S A QUESTION TO YOU NEED TO MM IT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY OKAY 
SO JUST JUST JUST JUST THINK ABOUT IT UM 
THANK YOU 
OH YEAH I JUST WANT TO SAY IT SHOULD BE REAL SMART 
VOICE RECOGNITION IS QUITE TOUGH 
I SAY DON'T USE IT AND THE CONTROL JUST LOOKS 
'CAUSE I ORDERED JUS 
IT L AT L LOCK IT 
YEAH SURE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY THANKS 
WHAT IS SPONGY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO WE HAVE TO UH FOUR 
YEAH SO ARE WE CONFIDENT ENOUGH ON CREATING TRENDS 
WELL WE CAN MAKE IT SMELL LIKE FRUIT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
COULD WE MAKE A TITANIUM SHAPE 
I MEAN FRUIT SHAPED 
BUT 
DOUB DOUBLE CURVED 
OKAY OKAY 
IN FACT I JUST AGREED TO MAKE UH 
TO MAKE THE LIKE TITANIUM PANELS 
IN A WHILE 
RUBBER BODY 
WELL OKAY WE WE'LL SEE 
YEAH 
WE'LL SEE 
WE'LL SEE 
WE'LL SEE 
I I REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS MODELLING CLAY 'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT MAKES SOME FOR FOR I DUNNO UH YEAH UM WE'LL LOOK 
OKAY OKAY 
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
RAMARO 
YEAH PARTICIPANT TWO 
COMPONENT 
YEP 
SO WE'RE TO MAINLY DESIGN OF MAINLY NEED TO KNOW WHICH COMPONENTS WE'LL SEE FOR ENERGY AND THE MATERIAL AND INTERFACE 
FOR ENERGY THERE ARE MAYBE TWO OR THREE POSSIBILITIES 
FIRST ONE WE CAN USE SIMPLE BATTERY OR WE CAN USE TRADITIONAL SOLAR CELLS ARE MM AND THE MATERIAL WE CAN HAVE PLASTIC 
RUBBER WHICH IS GOOD FOR THIS R. S. I. AND THEN UH TITANIUM 
WHICH CAN BE WHICH HAVE VERY GOOD LIKE ONE AND THEN INTERFACE WE'RE TO USE PUSH BUTTONS OR LIQUID CRYSTAL D L. C. D. DISPLAY 
AND WE CAN USE SOME MOVING KIND OF THING 
SO SO WE DISCUSSED BEFORE WE NEED TO WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME SPEECH RECOGNITION IS CHIP ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
SO THIS CAN BE SIMPLE KIND OF PROGRAMMABLE CHIP AND WHICH CAN USE MICROPHONE SENSORS 
AND WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT OUR REMOTE CONTROL IS 
STILL WE ARE LOOKING FOR POSSIBLE UH TECHNICAL UH SPECIFICATIONS AND HOW WE SAY WE CAN DO AND WITHIN OUR PRI RANGE 
LIKE WE'RE IT IN OUR TWELVE EUROS ARO AROUND THAT 
SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR SIMPLE DEVICES OR SIMPLE TECHNOLOGY TO DO THE LOCATION OF REMOTE CONTROL IN A ROOM OR IN A HOUSE 
SO UH WE DISCUSSED IN 
EXCUSE ME 
SO WE WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE BATTERY INSTEAD OF SOLAR CELLS AND IT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC UH TO HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY WITH THE SOLAR CELLS AND SO WE WOULD LIKE IT JUST USE SIMPLE BATTERY 
AND ALSO WE WANT TO GO FOR TITANIUM DESIGN INSTEAD OF RUBBER OR AND WELL THE PROBLEM IS WITH THIS DESIGN WE FOUND THAT WE CAN'T USE DOUBLE CURVED SHAPES 
LIKE YOU CAN HAVE TWO CURVES 
UH IT'S I THINK IN MANUFACTURING I GUESS IT'S PROBLEMATIC 
SO 
WE WANT TO GO FOR SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS BECAUSE IT AND A SIMPLE CHIP AND IT'S REALLY LESSER UH ARE REALLY LESS EXPENSIVE COMPARED TO L. C. D. WHICH ARE UH WHICH NEEDS ADVANCED CHIP TECHNOLOGY AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE 
SINCE WE WANT TO PUT SOME OTHER FEATURES SUCH AS SPEECH RECOGNITION WE WANT TO REDUCE UH COST 
OH 
OH 
AND ALSO LIKE IN IF YOU PUT A IT'S BE DIFFICULT TO DO ALL THE MOULDING OF BUTTONS AND THESE THINGS AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LIKE IN CELL PHONES RECENTLY THESE YOU CAN WITH THE RUBBER IN FOUR DIRECTIONS AND YEAH 
BUT FULL ASSEMBLY 
WE'LL USE MAINLY FOR TITANIUM RUBBER IS EXPENSIVE AND ALSO IT'S BIT DIFFICULT TO DO ALL THE SHAPES UH 
AND THIS PUSH BUTTONS WE WE WOULD LIKE TO USE PUSH BUTTONS INSTEAD OF L. C. D. S AND SO WE WANT TO UM I MEAN WE'RE WE WANT TO PUT SPEECH RECOGNITION AS WE WANT TO REDUCE PRICE ON THIS TECHNOLOGY AND SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH SPACE OR ENOUGH MONEY FOR 
SO SO 
Y YEAH WE HAVE SIMPLE BUTTONS AND SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IS 
UH L 
SO UH IT'S LIKE A 
YEAH MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN SEE DEPENDING ON HOW WE'LL COME UP WITH OUR FULL DESIGN THEN IF WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY OR LIKE FOR AND BECAUSE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WILL TAKE AT LEAST FIVE EUROS OR OR SOMETHING SO WE WANT TO REDUCE THE COST ON DISPLAY OR THIS INTER 
OK 
YEAH THAT CAN WE WE CAN CONSIDER BECAUSE LIKE IT WON'T TAKE MUCH MONEY I GUESS BECAUSE 
OKAY YEP 
YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR 
YEAH 
YEAH WE'RE TO GO FOR LI AND NOW I THINK WE HAVE MANY OPTIONS ON THE MARKET SO WE CAN GO FOR SMALL NICKEL OR ALKALINE BATTERIES FOUR 
REALLY LIGHT BATTERIES AND WITH UH GOOD PRICE 
YEAH 
THAT'S THEN THE THE ONE THING WE WANT TO KNOW IS LIKE BECAUSE REMOTE CONTROL IS USED FOR LIKE IN THE HOUSEHOLD SO IT IT IT WILL BE TO M MAYBE AT LEAST FIVE 
SIX PEOPLE WANT TO USE IT IS IS HOW TO UH UH HOW TO DEFINE OUR OUR SPEECH RECOGNITION WHETHER WE WANT TO DO IS SPEAKER INDEPENDENT OR SPEAKER DEPENDENT 
IF WE'RE GOING FOR MORE SPEAKER INDEPENDENT THEN IT WOULD BE LIKE AGAIN CUMBERSOME AND WE NEED REALLY M MORE TECHNOLOGY AND SO 
YEAH IF IF EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE N TO LOCATE THEN WE'RE TO GO FOR SOME SPEAKER INDEPENDENT TECHNOLOGY OR SOMETHING 
YEP 
THANK YOU 
YEAH 
OH 
WE HAVE UH SOME LIMITATIONS 
THERE 
SO MAYBE YOU CAN SEE IN THE END AND 
OH 
MM 
YEAH 
BUT IT'S UH 
BUT IT WOULD BE EXPENSIVE NO 
IF YOU USE COLOUR L. C. D. 
UH INSTEAD OF THAT MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR OF THE ASSEMBLER 
MAYBE WE CAN JUST OF USERS WANT MORE COLOURS THEY CAN PAY MORE MONEY TO GET THIS 
UH THE SHAPES AND THEY CAN HAVE DIFFERENT ASSEMBLY 
SO USERS HAVE DIFFERENT I MEAN THEY HAVE THEIR OWN INTERESTS COLOUR INTERESTS AND SO 
SO WE CAN JUST IF THEY WANT THEY CAN JUST PAY ANOTHER 
TWO OR 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YES 
IF THEY WANT LIKE UH SO THAT WE CAN YEAH 
YEAH 
JUST THEY'LL GET FEW MORE 
THINGS AND FEW MORE COLOURS 
LIGHTS YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
OH 
MM 
BUT THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE REALLY FEW NO 
SO LIKE WE CAN THIS 
OH 
YEAH 
MM 
HMM 
YEAH MAYBE LIKE THE INFRARED LIKE WE CAN PUT SOME 
RADIUM CHIPS OR SOMETHING IS THAT LOOK AT LEAST UM YEAH 
YEAH THAT 
OH 
YEAH 
UH THAT MM THAT COULD BE FEASIBLE I GUESS LIKE 
SO SINCE WE HAVE WE WANT TO DO SOME SPEAKER DEPENDENT SPEECH RECOGNITION UH SO WE CAN USE YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH IT'S 
HMM 
FOUR 
MM 
YEAH KIND OF UM MAYBE 
YEAH IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT MM MM 
FRUIT 
EVEN SHAPE 
MORE YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
SO THESE ABILITIES ARE MAINLY AD ADDRESSED BY YOUNG PEOPLE 
OR IT'S 
THIS YOU YOU SO DID YOU 
WHERE 
OH 
OH OKAY MM-HMM 
IT'S NOT FROM MM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S MORE GENERAL TREND IT'S NOT PARTICULAR AT THE REMOTE CONTROL 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT SOME MATERIALS N THEY'RE TO BE 
UH THEY'RE TO BE SOMETHING LIKE SOLID LIKE THEY CAN'T BE REALLY SPONGY OR YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH SPONGE YEAH YEAH AT LEAST THAT'S 
YEAH YEAH THAT YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH LOOKING YEAH FRUIT 
THESE THINGS CAN BE EASILY INCORPORATED 
WE CAN HAVE TO COLOURS OR THIS SHAPE OR AT LEAST YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
LIKE AND FEEL IDEA 
HMM 
HMM 
MM SOUNDS INTERESTING 
SO CAN WE HIGHLIGHT THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF OUR YEAH 
SO SO WE WANT THE SPEECH RECOGNISER AND WE WANT SOME KIND OF BUTTONS AND WE WANT SOME THEMES LIKE FRUITS OR VEGETABLES 
THAT'S WE WANT TO FOLLOW GENERAL TREND 
YEAH 
SO DO YOU THINK 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S 
SO WHAT ABOUT LOCATION AND THESE THINGS PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTING IN THESE FEATURES 
ARE THEY REALLY LIKE 
THEY MORE WANT THESE FANCY FEATURES LIKE 
AFTER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH WE WILL TRY TO EXPLORE THESE TWO OPTIONS AND YEAH YEAH 
OH YEAH AT LEAST LIKE WE CAN MAKE BANANA OR 
YEAH IT'S IT'S YEAH THAT'S A WE'RE TO LOOK FOR AND AND SO WE'RE TO USE THE WHETHER RUBBER IS EXPENSIVE AND DO 
HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ASSEMBLY ALSO LIKE AN SPONGY AND ONE KIND OF TITANIUM 
WE HAVE ONLY THE PLASTIC OR THE THE CHIPPY YEAH FIBRE CHIPS OR 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
EVEN DESIGN 
SO STILL WE WANT TO KEEP L. C. D. 
OR 
OKAY 
YEAH THEN WE CAN 
YEAH YEAH THAT USER FRIENDLY OR 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND WE JUST STICK WITH TWO BATTERIES SO IT'S NOT ANY SOLAR OR YEAH YEAH J YEAH BECAUSE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WE'RE DONE 
YEP 
MM 
SO UH NOW IT'S THE UH SAMMY 
IT'S THE DETAIL DESIGN MEETING SO WE'RE GOING LAST MEETING 
SO UM FIRST UH MARK AND RAMA ARE GOING TO PRESENT UH THE PROTOTYPE 
UH THEN UH SAMMY WILL PROPOSE SOME UH CRITE CR CRITERIA TO EVALUATE THIS PROTOTYPE 
THEN WE WE 
AND THEN WE GOING TO DO SOME FINANCE TO USE OF UH IT IS UH FEASIBLE AND UH AT THE END WE WILL WE WILL UM EVALUATE OURSELF AS A TIME 
AND THAT'S ALL 
OKAY 
SO FIRST LET'S UH 
SO THE PROTOTYPE 
OKAY 
AND YOU HAVE SOME SLIDES THEN 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH SO IN WHICH UH 
MM OKAY 
MM 
MM-HMM 
MOUSE 
OKAY 
WHAT DO YOU SAY 
ONE DAY 
OH 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BOBBY 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
'KAY 
ARE COLOURFUL 
YEAH 
UH UH 
THAT'S FOR THE L. C. D. OR FOR THE TITANIUM 
MM MM 
HEY YOU KNOW YOU'RE THEME TODAY 
HMM 
AND WE WAIT WH WHAT ARE THE STRAWBERRIES FOR 
WH WH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
STRAWBERRIES 
OH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
UH WE'LL SEE IN THE FINANCIAL PART OF UH ALL GETS INTO 
WE 
WHO IS THE FIVE UH FIFTY MILLIONS WE FIRST MAKE A PARTY IN 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
UH SO 
LET'S UH YEAH LET'S SEE IF UH THE IT'S MEET THE EVALUATION CRITERIUM 
OOPS 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
UH I THINK THAT FANCY WE CAN SAY IT IS FANCY 
OH 
I AM NOT THE DO THE ONLY ONE CHOOSING YEAH 
UH WHAT DO YOU THINK 
UH-HUH 
YEAH

IT'S IN THE OTHER 
YEAH 
MM 
TWO 
LET'S SAY TWO YEAH 
CHANGE COLOUR OF IT 
YEAH I THINK IT'S A 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM MM 
UM 
THE STRAWBERRIES OH 
MM MM 
YEAH 
BUT IT'S TOO 
IT'S UM ROBUST YEAH 
OH YEAH LETS ME TRY 
YEAH 
WHAT IS UH NEXT PLEASE 
AND YOU CAN UH D DO TWO SITES 
YEAH 
OKAY ALSO 
YOU CAN BY USING THE 
YOU C PUSH HERE THE THE YEAH 
LET ME UNDERSTAND WELL BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT'S FOR THAT THIS ONE OR B D UH TWO DIR DIRECTIONAL BUTTON

YEAH IT'S 
LET'S IMAGINE 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE STRAWBERRIES ON THE TOP 
I'M NOT CONVINC 
BUT MAYBE I'M NOT TRENDY 
BUT UH 
YEAH BUT UH UH THEY'RE NOT USEFUL 
I I MEAN IT THAT'S UH 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
HMM 
I WOULD HAVE UM UH I FOUND MORE FANCY THAT THE FRUITS ARE USEFUL 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT THE ONE YEAH 
MM 
NO I'M NOT SURE UH WHY UH IF IT WAS LIKE THIS 
I 
IT'S NO NO IT'S NOT FANCY ANY MORE 
OKAY 
UH-HUH 
AND DIFFERENT ROUTES 
OKAY I SEE WHAT 
OKAY SO Y Y YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING UH A PROTECTION FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
ALSO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WOW THAT'S A 
YOU 
YEAH IT'S FUDGE TITANIUM 
YOU KNOW 
RIGHT YEAH 
AND UH 
OKAY 
LET'S GO FOR ONE 
YEAH 
SO IT'S A GOOD EVALUATION 
YEAH 
MM MM 
OKAY 
SO NOW IT HAS TO FULFIL THE FINANCIAL CRITERIUM 
SO I HAVE AN HOUR

MM-HMM 
UH SO I I THINK THAT THE THE PRICE IS THIS ONE 
YEAH YEAH 
DON'T CHIP ON UM 
MM-HMM 
MM MM 
YEAH 
BUT SHE WANTED U THE FUDGE TITANIUM 
I THINK IT'S FIVE BUT YOU DON'T SAY 
MM 
OH SORRY 
AGAIN I'M IS IT 
SPECIAL COLOUR OR IT'S ONLY IN THE 
YEAH BUT THERE IS ONE COLOUR HERE 
SO I PUT IT HERE 
HOW MANY PUSH BUTTON 
THERE ARE TWO 
SO THERE THE SCROLL WHEEL OKAY 
OKAY 
UM 
THAT'S THAT'S NOT WE CHOOSE THIS ONE AND NOT THIS ONE 
OR ONLY A SCROLL WHEEL 
YOU TRY IT IS NO NO NO 
BECAUSE HOW DO YOU DO IT YOU SELECT 
YEAH I MEAN YOU YOU GO ON THE LOCATION WITH YOUR SCROLL WHEEL AND THEN YOU 
STAY LONGER 
OKAY 
OOPS 
OKAY OKAY 
UM 
MM-HMM 
YOU YOU HAVE ALL OF THIS ONE 
MM MAYBE IN INTO THIS ONE BUT 
YEAH SO 
NOT SPECIAL COLOURS AN INTEREST IN 
AND BUTTONS ARE NOT COLOURISED 
THEY ARE UM 
B UH 
IT'S ALREADY TOO EXPENSIVE 
APPARENTLY 
YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
SO THINK OF WHAT WE CAN CUT UH HERE 
APPARENTLY WE HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER 
BUT YOU DON'T NEED A BATTERY 
BUT UM IT'S LIKE THE HAND DYNAMO NO 
UH IT'S A IT'S A BEGINNING 
OKAY 
SO 
AN HOUR AND HERE 
'KAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
THAT'S RIGHT 
UM MAYBE MINUS UH OTHER ONE

OKAY 
I THINK IT'S 
YEAH 
UH HOW YEAH 
MM 
I'M THE ONE PROPOSING THE CALIBRATION 
OF COURSE YOU KNOW I'M THE PROGRAM MANAGER 
MM-HMM 
UH UM I THINK IT'S FINISH 
YEAH 
MM 
MM MM 
AND WE GO TO THE PARTY 
THANK YOU TO YOU 
SO UH CHRISTA 
YES

IT SAYS 
I WILL UH 
I'LL BUY IT 
IF I IF I AND SO 
HOPEFULLY MY DAUGHTER WILL LOOK AT 
YES OF COURSE 
IF C COURSE 
OH 
OH THERE IS A BUTTON MISSING 
OKAY 
IT'S AN OPTION 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
HEY BABE 
BOB 
HEY BABE 
OKAY THAT'S GOOD 
UH THESE ARE STRAWBERRIES 
FRUIT SMELLING SPONGY TITANIUM 
I DIDN'T KNOW TO EXIST BUT THAT'S GREAT 
OH 
YOU MEAN WE CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR UH OF THE 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY FOR THE L. C. D. 
TIT TITANIUM IS 
OH OKAY 
YEAH BOB PLEASE 
TUESDAY COLOUR 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
BLACK FOR SUNDAY 
IN THE L. C. D. 
OH 
OF COURSE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
STRAWBERRY SENSORS 
VERY USEFUL 
LOUNGE MEETING 
ALRIGHT 
GOOD 
SO HUH 
INTERESTING 
AN INTERESTING 
MM MM 
IT MAKES SENSE 
SO UH THIS IS 
WHAT A DESIGN 
IT'S MY TURN 
MM-HMM 
LET'S SEE IF THIS YEAH IF YOU MUTE 
THE EVALUATION CRITERION 
YEAH 
SO EVALUATION PLEASE 
SO 
YOU MADE A VERY NICE PROTOTYPE AND UM I THINK 
WE NOW AND ALTOGETHER TO TRY TO EVALUATE IT TO SEE IF IT MAKES SENSE TO DO IT 
IF IT FULFILS OUR WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO MM 
UH NEXT SLIDE PLEASE 
SO YOU KNOW BEFORE GOING AND UH CREATING AND PRODUCING THESE STRAWBERRY UH REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO FIRST VERIFY IF IT MAKES SENSE IF WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SELL IT 
UH SO WE NEED TO EVALUATE IT UM TRY TO DO IT IN A CONSTATIVE WAY AND SO MUCH AS WE CAN 
IT IS WHAT I PROPOSE IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO TO HAVE THIS SCALE FROM ONE TO SEVEN 
ONE MEANING THAT Y YES UH IT FULFILS UH THE THE CRITERION WHATEVER IT IS 
AND SEVEN MEANING NO IT DOESN'T FULFIL AT ALL 
AND WE'RE ALL L GOING TO LIST ALL THE CRITERION 
I'M GOING TO GO TO THAT NEXT SLIDE AND TOGETHER TRY TO EVALUATE THIS ACCORDING TO THIS CRITERION AND FROM ONE TO SEVEN 
AND THEN WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE AN AVERAGE WHICH WILL GIVE US THE VALUE OF OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL 
SO MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE CRITERIA 
SO THESE ARE THE CRITERION UH I'M I THOUGHT WERE IMPORTANT 
OF COURSE THIS CAN BE DISCUSSED BUT LET'S LET'S SEE SO LET'S VOTE 
SO WE HAVE FANCY HERE AND WE HAVE THE SCALE 
FROM ONE TO SEVEN 
WITH FOR IN THE MIDDLE 
SO 
WHAT DO YOU THINK SO IT FANCY 
IT IS VERY VERY FANCY 
OR HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH OF COURSE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
SO IT 
THE WEIGHT IS LATER 
NOW WE'RE WE'RE IN THE FANCINESS NOW 
I THINK IT'S QUITE FANCY 
IT'S UH 
YEAH SO NO IT'S IT'S ONE 
YEAH O ONE MEANS IT'S YES A VERY FANCY AND SEVEN MEAN IN AT ALL 
SO IT'S ONE OR TWO 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
TWO 
OKAY 
SO HERE TWO 
UP 
THEN WE HAVE UH TECHNOLOGY 
SO WHAT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY 
WE HAVE UH WE HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION WE HAVE LOCATION BASED WE HAVE L. C. D. 
CHANGE COLOUR I MEAN THAT'S VERY 
QUITE D I THINK IT'S A ONE FOR THAT AT LEAST 
AT LEAST A ONE YEAH 
ROBUSTNESS UH-HUH 
SO LET'S SUPPOSE MY DAUGHTER TAKE IT AND UM AND THROUGH IT AWAY 
DO YOU THINK IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT'S GOING TO LIVE AGAIN 
UH MAYBE NOT THE PROTOTYPE 
LET'S TRY 
OH MY GOD 
OKAY WE JUST LAST ONE STRAWBERRY 
IS NOT AT ALL 
IT IS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO IT'S NOT SO BAD 
I M UH I WOULD SAY THREE 
YEAH THAT DOES MAKE SENSE YEAH 
USEFUL 
WELL AS THE QUESTION IS DOES IT HAVE UH THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
SO I DON'T KNOW 
THESE BUTTONS ARE UH IT NOT CLEAR 
BUT YOU HAVE AT LEAST UH NEXT PRODUCE 
UH IT DEPENDS ON THE OKAY 
SO BUT FOR INSTANCE BECAUSE THE L. C. D. IS NOT UH TOUCH CONTROL TOUCH SCREEN YOU CANNOT GO TO CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE DIRECTLY 
DIRECTLY 
YEAH 
UH IT'S A JOG DIAL OKAY 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
IT'S MUCH LONGER THAN THAT THAT BEING TWO TWO FIVE NO 
DON'T YOU THINK SO 
MAY NOT OKAY WE CAN GO 
THAT'S UH YOU'RE RIGHT 
THAT'S IT'S LESS UH YEAH 
BUT IT'S IT'S NICE BECAUSE PEOPLE ANYWAY DON'T GO THERE 
BUT 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK FOR IT USEFULNESS 
SEEMS TO BE USEFUL 
BOTH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UP DOWN OR LEFT RIGHT 
YEAH 
THAT 
COOL 
I WOULD SAY THEN UH 
TWO OR THREE 
TWO OR THREE 
TWO 
OKAY TWO 
SO SIZE AND WEIGHT 
SO AT THE THE THE EFFECTIVE SIZE AND WEIGHT THAT THE USE IT UH REAL SIZE REAL WEIGHT 
OR BECAUSE IT SIZE IS GOING TO BE THAT YEAH 
UH AND AND 
IT'S GOING TO BE LIGHTER BECAUSE THIS SEEMS TO BE VERY HEAVY F I MEAN FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR INSTANCE 
NOT SURE IF UH SHE CAN USE IT 
SO SHOULD BE OKAY 
UP TO THERE FOR THAT BECAUSE I'M HAVEN'T SEEN THE WEIGHT SO I MUST NOT UH COLOUR AND SHAPE 
WELL AS CLEAR IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE THE SEVERAL COLOURS FOR THE L. C. D. 
BUT UM IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR WHAT IS THE COLOUR OF THE SH THE SH THE CASE 
IT'S A IT'S GOING TO BE TITANIUM 
OKAY OKAY 
THAT'S NICE 
I THINK IT'S GOOD 
OKAY 
YEAH 
WELL Y YOU KNOW IT'S THIS UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE YEAR 
SO 
UH I THINK USEFULNESS IS UM SO SO I REM UM JUST HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT USEFULNESS IS MUCH LESS IMPORTANT THAN FANCINESS 
WHETHER IT'S FANCY OR NOT NOW IT WE HAVE TO DECIDE 
BUT THIS IF IT'S 
UH-HUH 
SO THAT THEY WILL THAT MAYBE THE FRUIT MAY BE HERE INSTEAD 
SO IT SEEMS WE ARE NOT SO CLEAR ON THE SHAPE UH 
I SUGGESTED THREE 
BECAUSE UH EVERYBODY IS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CONVINCE ALTHOUGH IT'S QUITE YOU HAVE GOOD ARGUMENTS 
BUT 
AND UH THE LAST ONE IS ADAPTIVE 
THIS IS NOT OR MAYBE NOT AS IMPORTANT IS THE OTHER ONE BUT UH CAN WE ADAPT TO TO EACH EACH PERSONAL USE 
GREAT 
FULLY ADAPTABLE 
THAT'S YEAH 
SO YOU CAN FIT INTO YOUR PALM OKAY 
THAT WHAT ELSE CAN WE NEED 
YOU DO YOU THINK YOU ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH TI TITANIUM AS WELL 
IT'S FUDGE YEAH YEAH 
YEAH FRUIT TITANIUM YEAH 
WELL I IF IF THIS IS IF YOU ARE READY TO DO THAT THEN I THINK IT DESERVES A ONE 
OKAY 
NOW WE HAVE TO DO THE AVERAGE 
WHO IS GOOD IN MATH 
OKAY 
TWO POINT ONE SEVEN 
THAT'S NICE 
TWO POINT ONE SEVEN OUT OF SEVEN 
I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD 
GOOD THING 
WELL THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE EVALUATION 
SO 
IT SEEMS TO BE GOOD YEAH 
WE HAVE UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
THANKS 
UH UH 
SO SO HOW MANY BATTERIES DO WE NEED 
NO BATTERY 
GOOD 
WHY TWO 
SAY NO 
NO NO NEVER INSTALL 
TWO BATTERIES OR NO 
ONLY ONE 
NO NO 
BUT NO NO 
NO NO WAY 
YEAH 
YOU NEVER USE UH EXCEL 
GOOD 
IT'S TWELVE BUCKS 
TWELVE BUCKS 
TWELVE AND A HALF I THINK 
OKAY 
OKAY ELECTRONICS 
SO 
IT'S A SIMPLE CHIP 
SIMPLE CHIP OKAY 
NO 
OKAY 
ONE OR TWO 
NO 
OKAY 
SO THE CASE WHICH ONE UH IS IT IN THE END 
LET'S DO A SINGLE CURVE 
IT'S FLAT AND CURVED 
IT'S CURVABLE 
MAYBE THERE IS A SUPPLEMENT FOR THAT ONE 
IT'S ONLY CURVE 
OKAY LET'S GO 
THIS OKAY YOU DO WE TRIED WE TRIED 
SO WHAT IS IT 
IT TITANIUM 
MM THAT'S EXPENSIVE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
LET'S STICK TO S TITAN 
SPECIAL COLOUR 
NO BECAUSE UH 
YEAH 
OH 
SO THE L. C. D. 
TWO 
YEAH 
IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE 
THAT'S ALL 
NO 
UH I THINK NO IT'S UH IS IT A SCROLL WHEEL AND PE PUSH BUTTON TH THIS CENTRE ONE 
OR ONLY ONLY SCROLL WHEEL OKAY 
YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE MAKE UP MAKE US UP 
NO BUT YOU SELECT WITH THE TWO DO THE OTHER TWO BUTTONS ON 
THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT SHOULD STAY 
YEAH 
SHE'S VERY HARD ON THIS 
SPECIAL COLOUR 
YEAH 
NO 
SPECIAL MATERIAL 
YEAH BUTTONS ARE THE STANDARD BUTTONS 
YEAH 
IT'S ONLY BUTTONS THIS 
NOTHING SPECIAL 
OKAY 
SO WE ARE AT SEVENTEEN DOT EIGHT 
IN THE COLOUR IS IN THE L. C. D. 
I NO 
WE CAN JUST USE THIS RED 
IT'S 
SO WHAT IS ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CUT THINGS TO NOW 
UH UNTIL WE GOT TWELVE FIFTY 
WELL 
IF I LOOK AT WHAT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE THINGS UH IT'S THE L. C. D. AND THE SPEAKER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO THAT WOULD 
SO BUT IF WE SELECT THE HAND DYNAMO IT'S OKAY WE ONLY WE WE WIN ONE 
THAT'S ALREADY THAT 
OKAY LET'S DO THAT 
I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS LEGAL 
AND 
NO 
OKAY LET'S SEE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH IF CLICK SOMEWHERE YOU'LL SEE FEATURES 
YES IT DOES 
MAYBE PUT MINUS TWO IS IT LOOKS UH MORE REASONABLE 
YEAH ANYWAY NO MINUS TWO 
NOBODY WILL KNOW 
IT'S NOT RECORDED IS IT 
OKAY WE'RE IN TIME 
GOOD 
NO NOW WE ARE EXP EXCEEDING I THINK 
IT 
SO IT 
I THINK WE'RE EXCEEDING NOW 
WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE 
UH IT'S BETTER 
I THINK THEY ARE COUNTING UH WE WOULD PREFER YEAH 
MAXIMUM IS MAXIMUM 
SO REMOVE ONE OF THEM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY WE'RE UH ON TARGET 
I'M JUST CURIOUS TO USE THIS UH MY ADDRESS CHIP ON PRINT 
TRACK 
UH I WOULD SAY IT'S THE RUSSIAN TRICK BUT ANYWAY NO THEY MAY HAVE SOME THEIR ORIGINS STRANGE ORIGINS 
NO NO NO 
LET'S FINISH THIS MEETING INSTEAD 
WHAT ELSE 
NO 
THIS IS RIGHT 
OKAY SO FINANCE THAT'S DONE 
OR THE COST UNDER TWELVE 
YES 
PROJECT EVALUATION GOOD 
PROJECT PROCESS 
SAFE UH ASSE UH SAFE ASSESSMENT 
YEAH I THINK WE'VE LISTENED TO EVERYBODY 
EVERYBODY COULD SAY WHAT THEY THOUGHT 
AND UH 
YEAH 
WHEN WE USE THE RESULTS THERE IS NO DOUBT THERE MAYBE A LACK OF LEADERSHIP 
TEAM WORK VERY STRONG I WOULD SAY 
TEAM WORK NO PROBLEM 
MEANS 
WHITEBOARD DIGITAL PENS 
YEAH I THINK WHITE BOARD IS USEFUL 
DIGITAL PENS USEFUL 
NEW IDEAS FOUND 
YEAH 
BUT UH 
YEAH BUT UH THEN I I MUS 
THAT'S TRUE 
AND THERE'S UH IN VERY IMPORTANT POINT 
WE'RE IN TIME 
MEETINGS FINISH WHEN THEY HAVE TO OR EVEN BEFORE 
THE FOR MUTING IT'S UH ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
YEAH 
YEAH WE HAVE THREE UH REMOTE CONTROLS TO CREATE 
MM 
MM YEAH 
HEY JUST WONDERING IF MY UH WHAT ABOUT THE THE PINK THE PINKNESS OF THAT UH 
THEY ARE WORKING ON A OKAY GOOD 
I THINK WE ARE GREAT 
THERE'S NO NO OTHER WORDS FOR THAT

SO WE HAVE TO GO TO 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YES 
AND CHOCOLATE 
MM-HMM 
YES AND PLACE SOME SLIDES 
UH PARTICIPANT THREE 
PROTOTYPE 
UH SO 
THIS IS OR 
REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S A R WORKING PROTOTYPE 
YOU CAN USE IT NOW BY SWITCHING ALL THESE BUTTONS 
SO FIRST I PRESENT AS WE COME TO THIS PERFECT MODEL AND THEN WE'LL GIVE SOME TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS 
THAT'S WELL SO THAT'S THAT 
PLEASE NEXT SLIDE 
WE ANALYSED ALL THE FRUITS AND CONTACTED NASA AND UH MADE SOME REAL GOOD YEAH 
IF YOU CAN USE THIS AND THE STARS ARE SHOWING THAT 
AND UM 
S SOCIETY WILL ACCEPT THAT 
FOR SURE 
AND MAKING SOME ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT FRUITS WE CHOOSE THE ULTIMATE FORM ULTIMATE COLOURS AND UH ULTIMATE SMELL OF IT 
SO PLEASE NEXT SLIDE 
BUT WE STILL DIDN'T WANT TO GO FOR FROM OUR TITANIUM IDEA 'CAUSE IT'S THE MOST OF THE MODER THE UM 
THE MODERN MATERIAL WE CAN P SELECT 
AND IT'S PRACTICAL 
AND IT'S STILL SAY IT'S FOR OUR NEEDS SO PLEASE PRESS SOMETHING 
AND SO I SAID IT'S PERFECT 
PLEASE PRESS IT 
EVERYONE IS OF REALLY UH REALLY GLAD TO OBTAIN AN 
AS SUCH A R SUCH A DEVICE 
SO YOU CAN TOUCH IT WITH YOUR HANDS 
SURE 
YES 
YOU MUST SAY IT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YOU AND WE GET THE ANSWER 
UH IT IS YES OF COURSE 
PLEASE NEXT SLIDE 
UM THIS IS A PROTOTYPE 
YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK AT IT AND 
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY 
NOW IT'S TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION BY OR 
COLLEAGUE 
WE ARE STILL WORKING ON TITANIUM 
SO ARE WE'LL START WITH L. C. D. 
YOU CAN ASK BOB 
IT'S TUESDAY 
THAT'S LOCATION SENSORS 
YEAH AND WE CAN JUST SOME STRAWBERRY FIRST 
UM 
OOPS 
LET'S MAKE A PARTY FIRST MAYBE 
FEEL THE WEIGHT 
REALLY 
OKAY 
TWO

IT'S STILL IT'S STILL WORKING AND YOUR DAUGHTER GOT A BONUS 
A STRAWBERRY 
YOU CAN 
YOU GO YOU USE THE BASIC MODE YEAH 
SO THAT'S SIMPLE 
THE BASIC MODE IS UH YOU GET JUST TWO BUTTONS AND A JOG DIAL 
WITH TWO BUTTONS YOU DO THIS LIKE UH VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN 
OR IF YOU GO TO THE SITE IT'S CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN 
AND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT IS TWENTY FIVE YOU PUSH ON THIS 
YOU SELECT TWENTY YOU SELECT FIVE 
THAT'S IT 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S A JOG DIAL FOR CONTROLLING THE CURSOR ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
LIKE SELECTING THE MENUS 
SURE WITHOUT TITANIUM ALLOY IT'S GOING TO BE LIGHT 
OF COURSE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
AND 
MOREOVER MOREOVER IT COVERS IT COVERS ALL THE END GOALS 
EVEN IF IT AS YOU KNOW IT'S VERY ROUNDED BUT STILL YOU GOT SOME RUBBER FRUIT HERE 
AND IT'S COMPLETELY UH COMPLETELY SECURE TO LEAVE IT UH WITH CHILDREN AND THAT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SURE SURE JUST LOOK AT IT 
IT'S FULL ADAPTABLE 
YEAH YOU CAN FIT IT INTO YOUR PALM YOU KNOW

TWELVE BUCKS 
OKAY NOW MM-HMM 
CHECK THAT NUMBER ALSO 
IT'S IT'S FLAT 
IT'S FLAT 
BUT IT IS FLAT YOU LOOK 
IT'S CURVABLE BUT IT'S NOT CURVED 
OH OKAY 
MM 
MM 
WELL NO WHY THREE 
WHY THREE 
FOUR BUTTONS 
NO BUTTONS JUST NORMAL 
THAT'S FOR BUTTONS 
BUT BUTTONS ARE STANDARD 
WELL AS YOU MAY KNOW THERE'S SOME RESEARCH DONE IN THE FIELD OF PRODUCING ENERGY FROM MECHANICAL ENG I MEAN PRODUCING ELECTRICITY FROM MECHANICAL ENERGY 
SO THE POINT IS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE DEVICE AND PUSH THE BUTTON YOU PRODUCE ENOUGH ENERGY 
TO MAKE ELECTRICITY 
YEAH THAT YOU DON'T NEED A BATTERY 
SO IT'S SOMETHING LIKE HAND DYNAMO ROBOT 
A REAL HIGH TECH VERSION OF IT 
OKAY BUT L 
WHY NOT 
LET'S DO THAT 
AND I PROPOSE TO USE UH ABOUT CHIPS 
ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT RIGHT 
SO PUT MINUS IN THERE PLEASE 
WHY NOT 
AND 
SO WAS THERE RESULT 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
WHY 
OOPS 
YEAH 
WHY NOT 
MEANS 
GOOD 
AND A BATTERY AND A BATTERY YEAH 
NOW IT'S FANCY LET'S ADD ONE INSTEAD OF TWO 
WELL I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
I AM NOT SURE WHO WAS PROGRAMMING THIS CALCULATOR YOU KNOW 
'CAUSE UH 
I WONDER IF WE PUT A. OR B. SOMEWHERE INSTEAD OF A NUMBER 
NEXT SLIDE 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
UM MAYBE NOT HUH 
WHAT WAS THE UH YEAH WHAT WAS GOOD

YEAH IT IS 
SO WE SO WE CAN EVEN FORECAST 
THEY PROPOSE IS LIKE CELEBRATION EVERYTHING WE COULD FORECAST IT RIGHT

FIVE 
HM 
EXPERIENCE 
EXPLANAT 
SO THIS 
YOU CAN 
SPONGY 
HMM 
SO 
YEAH 
THIS THIS IS REALLY FLEXIBLE 
YOU CAN ADD YOUR BUTTONS 
YEAH 
SO FUNCTION MM 
SO SO WE DISCUSSED WE HAVE TO SWITCH ON SWITCH OFF WHENEVER WE WANT 
AND SO WE HAVE BUTTONS AND USING L. C. D. 
OR LIKE YOU CAN USE THIS JOG WHEEL AND SELECT WHICH EVER OPTION ON THE L. C. D. AND THEN DO ONE AND OFF 
THEN YOU HA YOU'LL HAVE VOLUME CONTROL 
SO YOU YOU CAN PRESS THESE BUTTONS TO INCREASE OR DECREASE THE VOLUME 
AND WE HAVE SOME L. C. D. CONTROLS 
LIKE UM SWITCHING THE L. C. D. DISPLAY IF YOU WANT TO USE L. C. D. OR YOU DON'T WANT YOU CAN JUST USE NORMAL BUTTON 
AND WE HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
HERE YOU HAVE MICROPHONE AND THEN IT DATE RECORDS YOUR VOICE AND THEN TO TRY TO RECOGNISE 
AND IT CAN ALSO DO THE ACTION 
AND LOCATION FINDER 
AND WE WANT TO DO THE LOCATION BASICALLY USING SPEECH RECOGNISER 
YOU CAN JUST SAY WHERE IS MY REMOTE CONTROL 
OR UH YOU CAN JUST GIVE SOME NICKNAME TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL LIKE BOBBY 
AND THEN IT WILL SAY UH 
YEAH UH AND THEN YOU CAN USE IT 
SO UM OUR TIME SO NOW FRUITS 
MAINLY STRAWBERRY 
SO YOU CAN HAVE AND THEN YOU CAN USE THE LIKE L. C. D. AND ALL THE SWITCHES 
MATERIAL WE WANT TO STICK TO TITANIUM 
WE WILL SEND WE WANT IT 
YEAH OR SO 
SO WE WANT TO HAVE SIMPLE AND PERFECT SHAPES LIKE I SHOWN IN THESE PHONES 
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN DESIGNS AND AND YOU CAN FEEL SIMPLE DESIGNS 
AND YOU CAN CHOOSE COLOURS ON YOUR DAY FOR EACH DAY OR EVEN MANY COLOURS

BUT SIDES UH THE SIDES SHOULD BE OKAY 
YEAH MM 
OH 
YEAH 
THE CASE IS SILVER TITANIUM NO 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH YEAH 
SO MAYBE I THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL 
YEAH 
UM 
YEAH WELL THEN IT'S BIT DIFFICULT TO USE 
NOT LIKE THIS IDEA WE'RE JUST GIVING THE FRUIT FOR MORE FANCINESS AND MORE ATTRACTION TOO 
SO MAYBE THINK WE CAN HAVE RUBBER OR SOME SPONGES STUFF FOR STRAWBERRIES AND DIFFERENT COLOURS 
SO IT'S EVEN 
THESE BUTTONS 
BUT IT LOOKS REALLY NOT REALLY GOOD 
I MEAN THE F YEAH 
SO THESE ARE KIND OF RUBBER THINGS 
EVEN IF YOU LOSE ONE YOU CAN JUST PUT WHATEVER

WE NEED ONLY ONE BATTERY 
NUMBER NUMBER 
SO WE 
WE HAVE SIMPLE CHIP 
UH LIKE SIMPLE CHIP YEAH 
SO YEAH 
YEAH 
FOUR BUTTONS AT LEAST 
AND THEN WE HAVE THE T SAMPLE SPEAKER SENSOR FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
YEAH ON IT IN 
YEAH NO 
YEAH I THINK WE WILL GO FOR A SINGLE CURVE NO 
UH SO 
OH 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
OH 
TITANIUM 
YEAH WELL 
NO ONLY ONE ONE 
UM 
INTERFACE 
YES AN L. C. D. DISPLAY 
OK 
YEAH NO YEAH 
PUSH BUTTON

HMM 
GOOD MORNING 
MM 
B DID YOU SEND US AN EMAIL ABOUT THIS 
YEAH WE WE RECEIVED AN EMAIL ABOUT THIS UH D DESIGNS 
UH IT'S OKAY 
YEAH YOU USE THE EMAIL 
YOU EMAIL 
THE V VERY IN IN THE FIRST ONE 
IT'S INSIDE 
NO NO 
THE THIRD ONE 
UH YOU DIDN'T GET ANYTHING 
IT'S STRANGE 
MM 
I GOT AN EMAIL ABOUT THE IDEAS ABOUT THE DISCUSSION 
YEAH 
I DUNNO FROM WHO 
FROM THE ACCOUNT MANAGER 
YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE SAME EMAIL RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SO EACH OF US HAS A REAL TO DO 
IN EACH 
WE ALREADY HAVE OUR ROLE 
'KAY WE CAN 
SO THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF DESIGNS THAT'S ALL 
OKAY ALRIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
I'M DOING THE INTERFACE 
OR YOU USING THE YOU ARE DOING THE ONE 
OH 
OKAY 
MM 
UM WORKING ON I 
USER INTERFACE 
YES 
YOU USE THE SECOND MAIL 
YEAH IT'S INSIDE 
GO DOWN 
APPENDIX 
SO THERE'S A RULE FOR EVERYBODY 
EVEN FOR THE MARKETING 
BUT LOOK AT YOUR ROLE YOUR MARKETING ROLE 
YEAH THAT'S YOUR ROLE 
MM 
YES 
MM-HMM 
AND TO COLLECT INFORMATION 
UM 
I I'M PART OF DESIGN PERHAPS 
UH WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IN A 
IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION ASPECT 
OH 
THAT'S ALRIGHT 
YEAH IT SHOULD BE EASY TO WORK WITH 
YEAH 
OH 
WE MAYBE YOU CAN HAVE A SPEECH UH RECOGNITION INTERFACE 
YOU JUST TELL THE TELEVISION I WANT WHICH CHANNEL 
OR OR YOU CAN SAY FOR EXAMPLE UM 
I WANT UH AT LEAST ALL THE PROGRAMME TONIGHT 
YOU YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF UH REMOTE CONTROL IT'S DOING THE SAME SEARCHING FOR YOU SEE YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FOR THE CHANNEL YOU WANT 
JUST SAY MAYBE I JUST WANT TO PRESS I WANNA HAVE A BUTTON FOR ALL THE MOVIES TONIGHT 
OR A BUTTON FOR ALL THE MAGAZINES ALL THE INFORMATION DOCUMENTARY TONIGHT 
AND THEN YOU LOST A FEW AND I WILL CHOOSE FROM THE LAST 
SO INSTEAD OF PRESSING THE CHANNEL NUMBER I AM CHOOSING THE PROGRAMMES DIRECTLY 
YEAH THAT'S ONE WAY OF UH MAKING IT USEFUL 
NO BECAUSE NO IT'S NOT VERY A LOT 
TH THIS INFORMATION EXISTS 
FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN GET UM 
YOU CAN USE UH WELL FOR EXAMPLE ANYTHING 
THE THE IDEA OF USING SPEECH TO REDUCE THE BUTTON BUT UH AND IT'S MORE NATURAL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES POSSIBLE 
YEAH 
BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
BUT THE THE MAIN IDEA I WANTED TO SEE I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT UM THERE SHOULD BE A FUNCTION INSTEAD OF CHOOSING THE CH T. V. CHANNEL 
THERE'S A OPTION YOU CAN CHOOSE EITHER T. V. CHANNELS OR OR PEAR OR THE OR THE CONTAIN OR THE CONTENTS OF THE PROGRAMME 
SO IT'S MORE POWERFUL 
YEAH 
NO 
NO BECAUSE YOU SEE NOW ALL THE T. V. PROGRAMMES ARE AVAILABLE IN THE WEBS 
THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN X. M. L. FORMAT OR WHATEVER THE FORMAT 
WE DON'T CARE 
WE JUST SAY THAT THESE ARE SOME CONTENT 
WE JUST WANT TO RETRIEVE THE CONTENT AND THEN CLASSI SORT THEM BY THE TYPES OF PROGRAMMES 
SOME OF THE WEBSITES THEY ALREADY PROVIDE THIS SERVICE SO WE CAN JUST USE THE SERVICE AVAILABLE 
DOWNLOAD IT UH AT THE AT THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THEN THERE'S THERE ARE ONLY SIX BUTTONS FOR SIX CATEGORIES OR SEV SEVEN 
THE MOST THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN BUTTONS 
SO I JUST CHOOSE THE CATEGORY ONE AND YOU REUSE THE SAME BUTTON FOR EXAMPLE TO TO CHOOSE AMONG THE THE SORTED LIST THE PROGRAMME YOU WANT 
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE AMONG HUNDRED CHANNELS IF YOU HAVE HUNDRED CHANNELS YOU JUST HAVE SIX BUTTONS SEVEN BUTTONS 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YES 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DISPLAY HERE JUST DISPLAY ON THE T. V. SCREEN RIGHT 
GOOD IDEA 
OKAY 
I THINK I THINK THAT WILL BE REVOL REVOLUTIONARY 
BECAUSE ALL THE T. V. UH THE THE REMOTE CONTROL HAVE ALL NUMBERS LOTS OF BUTTONS AND THEN YOU DUNNO WHAT TO CHOOSE IN THE END 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
UH W W WE HAVE SOMETIMES IT IS THE WHITE BOARD 
FIVE MINUTES 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WE ARE DESIGNING JUST REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
OKAY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONCEPTUAL REMOTE CONTROL THERE ARE YOU JUST WANT TO PUT THE FUNCTION IN 
GO ON DRAW SOMETHING 
MM 
WHERE IS IT 
OH OKAY 
WHERE WHERE IS IT 
HERE 
MM 
MM 
OKAY ALRIGHT 
SO SO THE MOST FUNCTIONAL DES MM THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IS IT CH CHOO BUTTONS TO CHOOSE THE CONTENT 
RIGHT 
WE AGREE ON THAT RIGHT 
UH UH FIRST ONE IS IT UH BUTTONS I OR IT COULD BE ANYTHING WITH BUTTONS 
UH TO CHOOSE 
UH CONTENT S OR CHANNELS 
SO WE HAVE BOTH 
THE USER CAN CHOOSE W WHICH ONE THEY WANT RIGHT 
BY CONTENT OR BY CHANNEL 
CHOOSE BY CONTENTS OR BY CHANNELS 
SO 
AND THEN WHAT DID WE SAY JUST NOW 
OTHER THAN THIS 
OKAY SO TECHNICALLY HOW THE PROBLEMS THAT HOW TO DO IT IS IT HOW TO GET THE CONTENT 
CHALLENGE 
OKAY 
CONTENT 
OKAY SO THIS WE HAVE TO WORK IT IT 
SO THIS ONE OF THE PROBLEM 
AND UH 
THE MAIN THING 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT OKAY 
SO WE ARE WE'LL DISCUSS IT WE WILL GET SOME INFORMATION ON THE NEXT MEETING IS FOR NOW WE GOT UH THE FUNCT THIS IS THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGNER 
THAT'S THE FIRST ASPECT 
RIGHT 
WE WILL GET INFORMATION AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK IN 
YEAH WE'LL COME 
ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT OKAY 
THANK YOU MOUSE 
GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY 
SO WE ARE ASKED TO 
TO MAKE UH UH A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR TELEVISION 
AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS NEW REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE ORIGINAL AND 
TRENDY AND OF COURSE USER USER FRIENDLY 
SO PEOPLE CAN CAN USE IT WITHOUT ANY 
ANY PROBLEM 
I DON'T KNOW 
UH NOT YET BUT IF YOU WANT 
DO YOU WANT DO YOU WANT ME TO SEND YOU A MAIL 
OR 
OH 
YOU GET EMAIL 
SO 
FOR EACH FOR EACH ONE 
SO THERE ARE SO WE HAVE THREE OF YEAH 
WE HAVE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DETAIL DESIGN 
SO WHO WILL BE THE THE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 
ANY ANY VOLUNTEER 
YOU ARE DOING THE 
OKAY I'LL FOR INDUSTRIAL DESIGN 
OKAY 
AND AND YOU 
NORMAN 
AND 
AND 
DOING THE MARKETING 
NOTHING RELATED HERE AT THE 
NEXT 
I DON'T KNOW 
I 
BUT THE DESIGN OR 
MAYBE WE'LL DISCUSS THIS LATER ON 
MM-HMM 
WHAT WE WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND TH THESE CHARACTERISTICS 
AND OF COURSE IT SHOULD NOT BE VERY COSTLY 
SO 
BUT THE ABOUT WHAT 
YOU MEAN THE EXTERNAL OR 
YEAH OF AGE OF COURSE 
YEAH 
YOU WON'T 
I I THINK IF WE INCLUDE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE REMOTE CONTROL IT WILL BE VERY COSTLY 
SO 
LIKE SO UH Y Y YOU SAY WE CAN USE SPEECH 
IN THE HAND 
YEAH 
EXCEPT IF IF YOU ARE FAR FROM THE T. V. 
THIS IS IT'S 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH WE SHOULD ALSO OPTIMISE THE THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS 
THIS IS GOOD IDEA 
SO WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO 
UH YOU CAN YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN USE IT IF YOU SEE CAN WE 
SO 
YOU IT 
YEAH 
IF IF YOU YOU YOU CAN IF YOU WANT YOU CAN USE THE THE 
OR BEFORE THE BEFORE THE THE DESIGN THAT SAYS 
NORMAN 
BE BEFORE BEFORE WRITING YOU CAN UH SET AND THAT SAYS WHAT WE WHAT WE SAID THEN AFTER THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN USE THE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
SO MAYBE WE'LL MEET IN MAYBE FIVE MINUTES 
AND WE'LL DISCUSS THE OTHER OTHER ASPECTS 
OKAY 
WELL THANK YOU ALL 
GOOD MORNING 
OR YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE SHARED FOLDER 
NO I DIDN'T GET IT 
THIS ONE 
NO 
NO 
I THINK IT'S FOR YOUR GUYS TO HOW TO DESIGN AT ALL THE ASPECTS SO YOU NEED THAT INFORMATION 
YEAH I THINK ASSIGN YOUR UH ROLES 
FOR EACH PERSON YEAH 
UH I'M NOT MARKETING 
YEAH NOTHING MUCH ON THE PROJECT 
MARKETING IN THIS DESIGN 
A DESIGN IS BASICALLY FOR INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND THE USER INTERFACE 
YEAH THIS IS 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT FIRST 
SO USER DEFINE 
THERE'S A TREND WATCHING 
YEAH 
I MEAN WORKING REMOTES WE ALREADY HAVE 
THIS WILL BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER REMOTES REMOTE CONTROLS 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
I'M A OKAY 
I MEAN THE MENU UH FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS TO HAVE SOMETHING ON THE HAND AND WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IF WE ARE GOING TO ADD A SPEECH INTERFACE 
I'M NOT SURE WITH TRENDY SLIM SIZE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IT WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT A SPEECH RECOG IF YOU WANT TO PUT A SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM OF INTERFACE FOR THAT I THINK THE T. V. ITSELF COULD HAVE TO 
AND I COULD TALK TO THE T. V. TELEVISION ITSELF 
I NEED NOT HAVE NO 
I MEAN WE HAVE SOME OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY BUT 
MM-HMM YEAH 
AND ANOTHER INTERESTING IDEA FOR THIS WOULD BE TO HAVE ONE LIGHT ADAPTATION SYSTEM DEPENDING UPON THE PICTURE OF 
SO I MEAN IF YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVIE AND SUDDENLY THERE IS A DARK UH SOME DARK SCENE THE LIGHTS ADAPT THEMSELF 
THE LIGHTING IN THE ROOM CHANGES 
I MEAN WE HAVE A OPTION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IF WE WANT TO HAVE THAT OPTION YOU PRESS THAT BUTTON ON THE REMOTE 
UH I'M AFRAID YOU FORGOT TO PUT YOUR LAPEL 
THE LAPEL 
YEAH THAT ONE 
JUST PLUG IT 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
GOOD MORNING 
WELL I THINK WE SHOULD SET THE THE POINTS TO TO DRIVE THE PROJECT AND UH 
YEAH FROM THE ACCOUNT MANAGER 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK SO 
I THINK OUR UH RESPONSIBILITIES WILL BE ASSIGNED WHEN WE IN OUR MAIL WE RECEIVED FROM THE ACCOUNT MANAGER 
OH 
NO I'M DOING THE INTERFACE 
YEAH I I'M I'M 
WELL MAYBE WE HAVE OKAY SO I INDUSTRIAL DESIGN 
IT WAS A LITTLE CONFUSION ABOUT MY UH BUT IT'S ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
SURE 
WELL I THINK WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT HAS TO BE DONE AND WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THE 
WELL WE WE WANT TO HAVE A NEW R REMOTE CONTROL FOR FOR T. V. DISTRIBUTION I GUESS 
SO WE HAVE TO PLAN HOW HOW IT WOULD BE DEVELOPED AND UH 
HOW WE CAN MAKE IT WORK 
YEAH I DUNNO I 
YEAH 
WELL I I THINK THAT NORMAN AND I WOULD THINK ABOUT UM THE TECHNICAL POINTS AND UM WE SHOULD DISCUSS IT IN THE NEXT MEETING OR 
YEAH 
WELL YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT WORK 
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE BIG THING 
YEAH 
WE CAN THINK ABOUT AN INTERFACE WITH UH WELL 
YEAH YEAH 
I 
I THINK IF YOU WANT TO TO CHOOSE UH FROM A LIST OF PROGRAMME OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU YOU MAY HAVE TO TO USE UH WE UH I DUNNO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IN THE CONTENT 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S IT'S A GOOD IDEA IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT I I THINK THAT TECHNICALLY IT WOULD BE UM A LITTLE BIT UH UH MORE TRICKY TO TO ACHIEVE THIS THAN JUST TO 
YEAH YEAH 
WELL I I I I THINK THAT J JUST BY USING NAVIGATION BUTTONS AND THE USER INTERFACE ON THE SCREEN WE ARE ABLE TO UH NAVIGATE UH THROUGH THE 
WELL CHANNEL PROGRAMME OR CONTENTS OR IN AN EASY WAY SO 
YEAH IN THE DIS DISPLAY ON THE T. V. SCREEN AND JUST UH WITH THE WITH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WOULD JUST NAVIGATE THROUGH THE F 
YEAH YEAH 
SO 
I THINK FOR FOR THE TECHNICAL POINTS WE HAVE TO TO TO CHECK HOW TO GATHER THE DATA FROM PROGRAMME OR CONTENTS AND ALL THIS STUFF 
OH RIGHT SO 
PLEASE NORMAN DRAW UH 
OKAY 
YEAH BY CONTENT OR BY CHANNEL IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
AND UH WE WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY HOW TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTENTS 
YEAH 
I THINK I IT'S NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO TO BROWSE BY CHANNEL BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT TRICKY TO BROWSE BY CONTENTS SO 
I THINK THAT'S THE THE THINGS TO DO AND UH TO UH 
REFLECT ABOUT IT AND UH 
DISCUSS IT IN THE NEXT MEETING 
OKAY 
THANK YOU EVERYBODY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
BECAUSE IT'S OPEN YOU MEAN 
F. FIVE 
DID YOU DRAW IT 
THIS 
WHAT IS THE OTHER CHIP FOR 
THE ON ON TOP 
FOR MINE 
AT THE ONE 
OKAY 
MM 
WHAT IS F. P. G. I. 
SO WHY'S IT HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE BLUETOOTH 
YEAH 
PROGRAMME IT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OH 
SO THESE ARE THE THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER 
OR 
DO THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER OR TWO SEPARATE CHOICE 
OKAY 
SO THE USE THE SOFTWARE PAR ALRI OKAY 
OKAY OKAY 
SO YOU CAN CONTROL IF YOU WANT RIGHT 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE CHARGER WHEN UH YOU WHEN YOU DON'T NEED TO USE IT 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
UH MM 
Y YEAH YEAH 
BECAUSE YOU ARE USING BECAUSE YOU ARE USING BLUETOOTH OF SOME PEOPLE HAVE P. D. A. THEY CAN USE THEIR P. D. A. TO CONTROL THE T. V. IF THEY WANT TO RIGHT 
I DUNNO 
SO IS MINE 
OH 
YEAH THIS YEAR 
YEAH 
SO YOU CAN OPEN UH THERE 
YEAH 
SO 
SO I'M WORKING ON THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
CAN YOU SHOW THE NEXT SLIDE 
SO THE THE PURPOSE IS IT TO FIND UH THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ASK IS WHAT EFFECT SHOULD THE APPARATUS HAVE 
SO SO I FOUND IN A WEBS ON THE INTERNET YEAH 
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME SEARCHING AND UH AND I FOUND THAT UH THE FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO TELEVISION SET 
FOR EXAMPLE SWITCH ON SWITCH OFF SWITCH THE NEXT CHANNEL AND SO ON AND SO NO 
SO I FOUND TWO VERY GOOD PROTOTYPES FOR FOR THIS INTERFACE FROM OUR COMPETITORS SO CAN YOU 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OURS IS A BIT UH DIFFERENT 
SO THESE ARE TWO EXAMPLE 
ONE IS FROM THE OTHER ONE IS FROM YEAH UH ENGINEERING CENTR YEAH 
THIS IS THE MOST COMPETING PROTOTYPES I'VE FOUND 
BUT THEN UH L BUT THEN I FOUND IF YOU LOOK AT YOU SEE IN THE LEFT IN THERE ARE TOO MANY BUTTONS 
YEAH 
O ON THE RIGHT I TRIED TO PLAY WITH THE PROBLEM IS THAT UH IF I HAVE HUNDRED CHANNELS I HAVE UH I HAVE TO CHOO PRESS THE OTHER BUTTON TO CHOOSE THE HUNDRED CHANNELS AND I HAVE TO COMPOSE THE NUMBER SO IT'S VERY LOUSY 
SO YOU SEE YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT THE NEXT ONE 
YEAH SO I TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEM 
AND THEN I I LOOK AT THE USER MANUAL THEY ARE A HUNDRED PAGES THICK SO WE DON'T WANT THAT 
SO I PROPOSE THE EASY TO USE UH PROTOTYPE 
YOU CAN NAVIGATE ON T. V. SCREEN AND WE CAN THE USER'S PREFERENCE AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE T. V. CONNECTED TO INTERNET SO WE NEED IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE T. V. PROGRAMMES BY X. M. L. AND WE NEED SOME TO DO SOME PREPROCESSING 
FROM THE TECHNICAL ASPECT THE PROCESSING SHOULD BE DONE IN THE T. V. SET THEN ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROLLER RIGHT 
AND THEN WE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS UH HARRY SAYS WE MAY JUST PUT IN WE MAY K. I. V. 
YEAH ALL THE PROCESSING IS DONE THE T. V. S A COMPU HAS SOME PROCESSING POWER THE 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE OR YOU JUST WONDERING WHAT CONTROLLER OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO I THE PROCESSING ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROLLER IS IT CAN U BE USED IN ANY T. V. ANY CONVENTIONAL T. V. SETS 
MM 
OKAY 
NO YEAH THAT'S ALL 
THE NEXT ONE 
SO I CAME UP WITH A SIMPLE DESIGN JUST KEEP THE V NAVIGATION BUTTONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY THAT'S ALL 
MM 
MM 
NO BECAUSE YOU CHOOSE BY CHANNEL SO YOU CHOOSE BY T. V. PROGRAM IS YOU DON'T HAVE HUNDRED CHANNELS TO CHOOSE FROM 
IF YOU GO BY CHANNEL YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT 
OH 
UH A BIG JUMP 
A MOUSE OR 
YEAH 
MM 
MM-HMM 
UH IT'S GONNA BE SMALL 
YEAH 
SO IT'LL BEEP IF YOU WANNA FIND IT YOU JUST UH SHOUT Y UH JUST TO JUST HAS TO RE RESPOND TO YOU WHEN YOU LOOK FOR THE DEVICE 
I DUNNO HOW BU 
AND RESPONDS TO YOU NEED 
I MM 
BUT I THINK IF YOU TO RECOGNISE NUMBERS IT'S A WELL STUDIED PROBLEM 
I IF YOU JUST RECOGNISE UH NUMBERS IS A LIMITED YOU HAVE LIMITED VOCABULARY 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
BUT 
MM 
YEAH 
I NO I I THINK THAT UH I IF WE GO FOR QUALITY PEOPLE MAY TOLERATE FOR HIGH QUALITY AND OF COURSE COMES WITH UH REASONABLE COST 
MAYBE NOT LESS BUT THEY MAY BE WILLING TO PAY 
LITTLE BIT MORE FOR COMFORT YEAH EXTRA FEATURES 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
WHAT IS THE TELETEXT 
MM 
IT IS INTERESTING BUT WE ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH THE REMOTE CONTROLLER 
SO YOU NEED IS SPECIAL T. V. SETS TO DO THAT 
OR IT'S IT'S DONE VIA THIS REMOTE CONTROLLER 
IT'S VERY COMPLEX 
MM 
YEAH THEN WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE BUT MAYBE NOT IN THIS PROJECT 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM 
MM 
USING THE T. V. TO ACCESS THE INTERNET 
OR WHAT 
I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
THE FUTURE DEMAND MARKET DEMAND 
THE FUNCTIONALITY IN THE FUTURE 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
BECAUSE ALL THE T. V. SETS WILL BE DIGITAL RIGHT 
ALL THE PROGRAMMES EVERYTHING WILL BE IN DIGITAL THAN ANALOG 
THE THE SYSTEM WILL CHANGE AND WE HAVE TO ANTICIPATE FOR THIS CHANGE 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
SO WE COME AGAIN FOR THE THE SECOND MEETING 
UH FOR THE UM IF THIS 
MEETING 
NOW IS IT 
TO MAKE PRESENTATION ABOUT 
UH THE WORK FOR EACH ONE 
AND TAKE THE THE DECISION ABOUT THE THE DESIGN AND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE THE REMOTE 
CONTROL 
AND WE HAVE THINK I GOT A NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENT 
SO I THINK 
UH TELETEXT BECOMES OUTDATED 
SO THE POPULARITY OF THE SINCE THE POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET AND I THINK WE DON'T NEED LIGHTING ADAPTIVE 
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE ONLY USED FOR THE THE TELEVISION 
AND OF COURSE WE SHOULD HAVE OUR IMAGE 
IN THE ON THE DESIGN 
SO LET'S START WITH THE 
THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
OR YOU YOU CAN USE THE WHITEBOARD IF YOU WANT 
HERE 
OH OKAY 
THIS ONE 
DO YOU WANT TO OPEN 
OH 
WOW 
THIS 
YOU CAN I YEAH 
UM 
YEAH WE CAN CHANGE THE B 
YEAH 
UM 
IT'S MINE 
PARTICIPANT ONE ONE 
MM 
UH WE HAVE SO LET'S MOVE IT 
IT USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
PARTICIPANT 
DURING THE WEEKEND 
THAT'S GOOD 
MM-HMM 
THESE ARE USUAL FUNCTIONALITY 
TASKS 
AND THEY ARE SMALL 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE PA PA PROCESSING WILL BE DONE IN THE T. V. 
THEN THE 
SO WE SHOULD HAVE SPECIFIC T. V. 
OR 
WE CAN USE THIS 
YEAH WE DON'T 
YEAH I THINK SO 
J J JUST THE REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH WE 
YEAH 
SPEECH RECOGNITION 
KEEP THE NAVIGATION BUT 
SO YOU ARE 
MM 
HOW THE THIS REMOTE 
YEAH OF COURSE SMALL 
PARTICIPANT FOUR 
SO HARRY 
MM-HMM 
BUT DO YOU THINK WHAT THEY SUG SUGGESTED S POSSIBILITY 
YEAH 
IT 
YEAH 
BUT IS IT USEFUL OR NOT U 
I DON'T KNOW 
THERE IS IN THE 
MM 
I THINK I 
IF IT'S NECESSARY CAN YOU CAN DO THAT 
WE CAN INTEGRATE SMALL MICROPHONE ON THE REMOTE SO IT'S NOT REALLY A PROBLEM 
WHAT ABOUT LIGHTING ADAPTIVE OPTIONS 
ACCORDING TO THE OR AT THE NEW REQUIREMENTS I THINK WE DON'T NEED THAT 
YEAH 
MM 
SO WE HAVE I THINK WE HAVE IS STILL WE HAVE 
COUPLE OF MINUTES 
MM MM 
SO ANY THINGS TO 
TO DISCUSS 
OR ANY SUGGESTIONS 
EXPENSIVE 
PRICE 
I THINK WE WE CAN WE 
SO THE 
YEAH 
SO YOU HAVE TO ANTICIPATE THE THE FUTURE 
NO FEATURE 
OKAY 
SO LET'S GO FOR THE THE LUNCH BREAK AND 
WE WILL MEET AFTER 
JUST GO TO EXPLORER 
OR OPEN 
PARTICIPANT TWO 
OPEN UH 
SLIDE SHOW VIEW SLIDE SHOW 
ONE IS A COMMUNICATION 
GATEWAY ARRAYS 
IT'S A FIELD PROGRAMMABLE GATEWAY ARRAYS 
YEAH 
OR IT'S SOMETHING LIKE ISN'T HARDWARE THE FIRST ONE 
AND THE SECOND ONE IS FOR THE SOFTWARE 
YEAH IT RUN THE TO MAKE IT RUN 
THAT'S IT 
NO 
OKAY AND HOW ABOUT THE BATTERY POWER 
UH YOU MEAN THAT BATTERY WOULD BE SOMEWHERE THERE AND THE REMOTE CONTRO THE POWER TO THE BATTERY COMES THROUGH INFRARED 
NOT THE MORE COMPACT AND UH OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
HAVING A CHARGER RATHER THAN PUTTING THE BATTERY CELLS ALWAYS 
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO TO HAVE TO BUY THE BATTERIES WHEN THEY RUN IT 
WE JUST MAKE A SMALL CHARGER AND PUT IT 
BU 
OUR REMOTE WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE IT P. D. A. 
GO 
YEAH NOT THE T. V. S 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
UH BUT YOU HAVE A CATCH THERE 
UM ASSUME THAT UM IF YOU WANT TO GO TO IF YOU ARE WATCHING CHANNEL TWO AND IF YOU WANT TO GO TO CHANNEL NINETY NINE 
THEN 
UH-HUH HUH-HUH HUH 
MM-HMM HMM-HMM 
BUT 
YEAH THEN YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
MM-HMM HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
TOO SMALL THAT IT GOES UNDER THE SOFA AND WE CAN'T FIND OUT 
YEAH THAT'S 
JUST GIVE IT A NAME AND WE CALL HIM 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
OKAY AFTER HAVING THE INPUTS FROM INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND USER INTERFACE I THINK MOST OF THE POINTS WHICH I WANT TO ARE ALREADY COVERED HERE 
AND TO FIND THE MOST INTERESTING FEATURES WHAT THE USERS WOULD BE INTERESTED 
THEN WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO WE HAVE PUT A FEEDBACK FORMS IN ALL THE MAGAZINES AND THE USERS SEND THE FEEDBACKS AND BASED ON THAT 
THESE ARE THE FINDINGS WHICH WE GOT AND YEAH ADDING OF A SPEECH INTERFACE IS ALWAYS GOOD FOR A T. V. REMOTE BUT THE TECHNOLOGY 
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT AS DISCUSSED EARLIER 
NO IT DOES HOW FEASIBLE TO USE 
UH WE CAN PUT AN LIMITED VOCABULARY AS IN THE MOBILE PHONES 
WE JUST HAVE THE 
IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE MUCH SPACE ALSO 
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY SLIM 
AND NEXT ONE WAS THE SIZE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IT HAS TO BE OF COURSE A VERY SLIM AND SMALL ONE 
AND OF COURSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN IF IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CRITERIA HERE IS 
I MEAN WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR A TRADE OFF 
THE FEATURES AND THE COST 
LITTLE BIT MORE IF IT'S WITH EXTRA FEATURES 
OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT 
I MEAN FOR A LAZY GUYS THEY COULD SAY NINE AND THE NINE CHANNEL COMES 
ARE THEY SAY MOVIE NAME OR I DON'T GO FOR MOVIE NAMES BUT ONLY FOR THE NUMBERS ON THE CHANNEL 
OR VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST 
SO I THINK THIS SHOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO PUT THESE FEATURES 
AND THE FOURTH ONE WAS THE TELETEXT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES 
MM I THINK 
YEAH AS DISCUSSED IN THE EARLIER MEETING BUT I THINK UH NOT MUCH PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS POINT IF IT'S NOT REALLY REQUIRED 
I MEAN 
I MEAN YEAH IT'S FOR THE UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND USERS INTERFACE DESIGNERS TO DECIDE IF IT'S GOING TO BE WORKING OR NOT 
I THINK 
I THINK SO I DISCUSSED TH THAT FOUR POINTS WOULD BE GOOD FOR UM MARKETING 
THE SPEECH INTERFACE AND UH LESS UH REASONABLE UH COST 
AND THE LIGHTING ADAPTATION AND THE TELETEXT 
AND REGARDING THE TELETEXT UH THESE ARE THE SUBTITL THESE ARE THE TEXT INFORMATION WHICH YOU GET IN THE TELEVISIONS 
IF YOU ARE WATCHING AN FOREIGN MOVIE YOU GET SUBTITLES SOMETIMES 
AND UH IF YOU ARE A FRENCH GUY WATCHING AN ENGLISH MOVIE YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT IN FRENCH 
AND IF I AM A GERMAN THEN I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE MY OPTIONS IN GERMAN 
SO THE REMOTE IT SHOULD HAVE SOME IT SHOULD GIVE ME SOME FLEXIBILITY OF CHOOSING THE CH LANGUAGES 
THAT SHOULD BE A GOOD UH POINT 
WE ALREADY HAVE SOME 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
OKAY THANK YOU 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH ALRIGHT 
SO UH 
WELL I HAVE A POWERPOINT PR PRESENTATION STORED IN MY 
IN MY PERSONAL FOLDER SO I I I THINK YOU CAN REACH IT FROM HERE 
PARTICIPANT TWO 
YEAH 
UH PEN 
RIGHT SO UM I WILL TALK ABOUT THE THE W WORKING DESIGN AND 
AND UM WELL I I WILL PRESENT MY MY FIRST IDEA ON HOW TO BUILD THE OUR NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR TELEVISION 
SO HE CAN YOU GO ONE PAGE DOWN PLEASE 
SO I THINK THE FIRST THINGS TO DO IS TO DEFINE THE HARDWARE COMPONENTS NEEDEDS TO ACHIEVE UH WHAT WE WANT TO DO 
SO UH MM I'M THEN UH I THINK UH I I'LL DO A SURVEY ABOUT WHAT IS UH WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET AND WHAT WHAT IS THE THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE THINGS WE HAVE WE CAN SEE 
THEN UH I WILL TRY WITH THE TECHNICAL TEAM TO TO BUILD A PROTOTYPE AND IT IS UH WITH UH UH HOW THESE LITTLE BOX WOULD UH LOOK LIKE LIKE 
AND HOW ON AND WE CAN UH START TROUBLESHOOTING FIRST UH COM COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS OR THINGS LIKE THAT 
AND WHEN WE ARE READY WITH THIS FIRST PROTOTYPE I I THINK WE CAN ADD SOME SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITIES ON A PROGRAMMABLE CHIP LIKE BROWSING BY CONTENT OR UM THINGS LIKE THAT 
OKAY SO CAN YOU GO DOWN UH 
SO 
WHA WHAT I THINK FOR NOW SO WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL W WHICH IS WORD IS UH I THINK WE U WE CAN USE A BATTERY FOR THE 
THEN TWO PROGRAMMABLE CHIPS FOR BOTH SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITIES AND COMMUNICATION 
AND THE COMMUNICATION WITH THE T. V. SET IS UH MADE THROUGH UH INFRARED COMMUNICATION 
SO UH THIS IS THE THE SCHEMA OF THE O OF THE FUTURE UH REMOTE CONTROLS IS UH YOU CAN YOU CAN USE THE COMPONENTS 
UH BATTERY AND UH THE TWO CHIPS GOES TO THE INFRARED UH CONNECTION TO THE T. V. SET 
THE ON ON TOP IS FOR THE UM WELL THE FUNCTIONAL THE FUNCTIONALITIES AND THE THE THE RED UM SORRY THE GREEN ONE IS IS IT WILL 
PUTTING THINGS TOGETHER UM F TRANSFORM THE DATA INTO UH QU INTO THE FORMAT TO TO UH TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE T. V. SET 
AND THAT'S IT 
I THINK WE SHOULD USE A F. P. G. I. FOR FOR THE FUNCTIONALITIES WHICH IS EASY TO TO IT 
IT'S FIELD PROGRAMMABLE UH SOMETHING ARRAY 
YEAH 
WELL UH A F. P. G. I. IS JUST A CHIP YOU CAN UH YOU CAN PRE PROGRAMME IT UH W WITH WH WHATEVER YOU WANT 
AND UH WELL THE BLUETOOTH CHIP IS JUST RESPONSIBLE TO UH MAKE THE COMMUNICATION UH BETWEEN UH THE TWO DEVICES 
NO 
WELL THE THE F. P. G. A. WILL PRODUCE THE THE DATA TO SEND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT AND THAT'S IT FOR THE WORKING DESIGN 
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS 
OH NO NO NO NO I THINK UH WE HAVE UH TO TO UH HAVE UH EMBEDDED UH B BATTERIES IN IN THE YEAH NOT THE IT 
YEAH YEAH 
AND UH I I DON'T THINK IT WILL AND UM VERY UH MUCH POWER TO MAKE IT RUN SO 
YEAH 
IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
ALSO BUT BUT I I I THINK UH THE THE GOAL IS TO SELL OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
SO OKAY SO CHARGER FOR US THE 
YEAH 
OF COURSE 
SO WE HAVE TO IT 
WE HAVE TO SELL A T. V. WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL IT 
I THINK THERE THERE IS THERE IS AL THERE THERE IS A A TECHNOLOGY LIKE SHOW VIEW WHO IS ALREADY AVAILABLE IN MOST OF THE T. V. SET ON RECORDERS OR THING LIKE THAT AND WE CAN TRY TO TO GET THIS INFORMATION ON TO THE REMOTE CONTROL TO TO DO THE PROCESSING ON THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE 
YES THAT'S A GOOD IDEA I THINK 
WE DO WE DON'T WE WE DON'T NEED REALLY MUCH BUTTONS TO I IF WE HAVE A SCREEN TO NAVIGATE ON ON THE T. V. S UH 
WELL F FOUR FIVE BUTTONS IT'S SUFFICIENT 
IT'S EASY TO BUILD 
IT DOES NOT CONSUME MUCH POWER 
WELL THEN YOU YOU YOU GO TO THE MAIN MENU AND UH YOU HAVE UH GO TO CHANNEL AND THEN UH YOU CAN 
YEAH 
MAYBE YOU 
BUT UH I I THINK I I IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO TO MAKE UH WELL A A BIG JUMP BUT UH WELL Y YOU HAVE TO TO HAVE A A A DEVICE WHEN YOU COULD YOU COULD 
WELL NOT A MOUSE BUT UH SOMETHING THAT THAT SAYS MORE CLEARLY THAT UH RIGHT LEFT UP DOWN 
WELL THE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO TO WRITE SOMETHING TO THE NAVIGATOR MAYBE DIRECTLY OR 
SO WE CAN THINK OF BUTTONS LIKE IN THE TELEPHONE TO SEND MESSAGES OR THINGS LIKE THAT 
BUT WE'LL SEE 
OKAY SO UH NEXT PRESENTATION 
MM 
WELL I I THINK IT WILL BE A YES A BIT COMPLICATED TO M MAKE A SPEECH RECOGNISERS RUNS ON THE SMALL UH ITS 
YEAH 
AND THIS CAN ALLOW TO CHOOSE THE THE PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE WITHOUT UH ADDING UH BUTTONS 
SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
YEAH SO AS SPEECH IS A IMPORTANT EXTRA FEATURE I THINK 
WELL UH 
WELL 
WE ARE WE WE JUST HAVE TO FIND A MENU HOW TO TO ADD A UM A A A MICROPHONE OR UH WELL YES A MICROPHONE INTO THE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO 
I WILL IT WILL BE ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH I THINK IT'S A BIT COMPLEX IT 
FOR OUR NEXT PRODUCT OUR NEW T. V. SET WITH UH AUTOMATICAL UH SOUND ADJUSTMENT LIGHT 
FUNCTION 
YEAH BUT WELL WHAT ABOUT THE THE NEW PROJECT'S REQUIREMENT 
I I I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE UP WITH TELETEXT ON 
YES 
WELL SO MAYBE WE WE CAN J WE CAN ALREADY THINK UH ABOUT A WAY TO TO ACCESS THE INTERNET VIA THE TELEVISION 
BECAUSE OF 
YEAH BUT UH WE CAN THINK THAT IN A FEW YEARS THERE WILL BE T. V. SET THAT CAN ACCESS THE INTERNET 
SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA OF I I IF WE I IF IF WE UH THINK ABOUT HOW TO TO TO BUILD UP OUR REMOTE UH CONTROL W WITH THIS FUNCTIONALITY IN A W WHICH WILL C WHICH WILL COME IN A FEW YEARS 
SO IF WE ALREADY HAVE IT IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH IT DOES WILL NOT NOT TO IMPLEMENT IT BUT IT WILL 
TO FIND A WAY TO TO ADD TO ADD THIS FUNCTIONALITY IN A YEAH NO NO NO NO EASY MANNER IF AS POSSIBLE 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
SO 
OKAY THANK YOU 
MM 
MM 
MM 
SORRY 
WHAT IS THIS SINGLE CURVED WHAT DOES IT MEAN 
SO IT'S IT'S NOT 
YOU L YEAH 
WHEN YOU HOLD ON IT IT IS COMFORTABLE TO HOLD 
OKAY 
YEAH 
AND THE BATTERY IS IT KIND OF A RECHARGEABLE OR IT DOESN'T MATTER 
THAT THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS BY KINETIC 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE WE MIGHT CHECK WITH OUR R. AND D. DEPARTMENT TO SEE IF THEY HAVE THIS PRODUCT READY FOR MARKET 
MM MM 
WOAH 
UH THE DEPARTMENT 
MM 
OH 
SO I UM KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE R. AND D. DEPARTMENT 
SO THE TITANIUM CASE IS THE NORMAL CASE THAT I'LL SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES THAT I HAVE AND YOU TELL ME WHETHER THEY ARE TITANIUM CASE OR NOT 
'CAUSE I AM NOT VERY SURE PLASTIC TITANIUM OR WHATEVER 
THERE'S ANOTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE 
SO THAT THE UH WELL YOU'VE SEEN THEM I L IN MY PRESENTATION THAT UM I POINT AT SOME WHY BUTTONS ARE NOT THE MM 
NOT THE ONLY WAYS YOU CAN SEE 
YEAH 
YEAH MAYBE ONE 
YEAH 
SO THE USER INTERFACE IS UH 
I IT USES THE ASPECT UH OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM A PROGRAMME WHICH CAN BE SEEN OR HARD 
OR OTHERWISE PERCEIVED BY THE HUMAN USER AND THE COMMANDS AND MECHANISM 
THE USER USES TO CONTROL ITS OPERATION AND INPUT DATA 
SO YOU USE THIS GIVES YOU THE WAYS TO INPUT DATA AND WE HAVE UH WE ARE MORE WE EMPHASISE MORE ON THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE HERE 
THE IDEA IS TO REPRESENT BUTTONS AS FIGURES DIAGRAMS 
SYMBOLS AND ONE IS YOU YOU CAN EASILY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SYMBOLS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS DOING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
EA EASY TO USE 
SO NEXT ONE 
FUNCTION FIVE 
SO I CAN USE THE BUTTON THE MOUSE MAYBE 
YEAH 
SO NEXT LINE 
SO THE HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES 
SO THEY CLUSTER THE BUTTONS TOGETHER 
THEY GROUP THEM INTO COL THEY COLOUR THEM AND UH THEY HAVE DIFFERENT FORMS AS WELL 
MM 
BUT THIS INTERFACE ARE KIND OF CONFUSING 
UH BASICALLY THERE ARE TOO MANY BUTTONS 
RIGHT 
NEXT ONE 
SO SOME PEOPLE ARE PROPOSE VOICE RECOGNITION AND 
SO UH BY THE WAY I RECEIVE AN EMAIL FROM THE FRAME IN OUR DEPARTMENTS SAYING THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION HAS BEEN USED IN THE COFFEE MACHINE FOR THIS BY A COMPANY WHEN YOU TELL THE YOU SAY GOOD MORNING COFFEE MACHINE AND THE MACHINE ARE REPLY TO YOU 
SO I JUST GOT AN EMAIL SAYING THAT 
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THIS VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IS READY TO BE USED AS WE MIGHT CONSIDER THAT 
SUPPOSEDLY 
THE NEXT ONE 
MM SO SOMEBODY SOME PEOPLE USE UH SOME PEOPLE USE A SPINNING WHEEL THE WITH THE L. C. DISPLAY SO INSTEAD OF USING THE MM BUTTONS YOU HAVE A L. C. D. SCREEN AND THEN THERE YOU CAN U YOU CAN SEE THAT AS BUTTONS 
YOU CAN SEE THAT IS REAL IS IS THAT COULD BE AN OPTION AS WELL 
TOUCH SCREEN I MEAN 
NEXT ONE 
AND SOME PEOPLE PROPOSE A SCROLL BUTTON 
INTEGRATED WITH PUSH BUTTONS ARE YOU MAY HAVE SCROLL BUTTON INSTEAD OF P JUST THE PUSH BUTTON 
LIKE THE ONE WE HAVE HERE 
UH NEXT ONE 
SO 
MM 
SO THERE ARE A FEW ASPECTS THAT I COLLECTED HERE 
SO SO BASICALLY THIS DEALS WITH SPECIAL USERS CHILDREN HANDICAPPED PEOPLE 
OLD PEOPLE AND UH 
MM AND PROG BASICALLY THEY ARE PROGRAMMABLE SPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN 
AND UH 
MM YEAH YEAH 
AND THEN THEY ALSO SECURE UH COVERS TO PROTECT 
UH SECURE AND HIDDEN PROGRAMMING AND BATTERY COVERS THAT WILL PROTECT YOUR SETTINGS 
SO 
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO INTEGRATE ALL THESE COMPLICATED FEATURES 
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THE CURRENTLY IN THE MARKET THERE ARE THERE ARE CONTROL THERE ARE REMOTE CONTROLLERS F CUSTOMISABLE FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
YEAH SO THAT'S THE POINT 
THE NEXT ONE 
AND UH YOU USE THIS IS THE ONE WHERE YOU HAVE THE PROTECTION COVER 
MM MAYBE USEFUL FOR CHILDREN THEY MIGH YOU YOU THEY ONLY USE THE BUTTONS OUTSIDE 
AND FOR ADULTS WH WHERE YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL YOU CAN USE THE ONE INSIDE 
SO THE ADULTS MIGHT WANNA HAVE A KEY TO LOCK THAT IT PRO AS CHILDREN WILL NOT TOUCH THE BUTTON INSIDE 
YEAH 
THE NEXT ONE 
SO THIS GUY THIS IS ANOTHER COMPANY THAT PROVIDES BIG BUTTONS 
IT I SEE THAT THAT IS USEFUL FOR OLD PEOPLE AND THEN YOU DON'T GET AT LEAST 
BUT FOR OUR PRODUCT WE DON'T NEED A BIG ONE BECAUSE YOU HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION E EVENTUALLY WITH US 
AND YOU CAN CALL YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS 
T. V. REMOTE CONTROLLER WHERE ARE YOU 
AND THEN UH WILL BEEPS AND TO SAY THAT I AM HERE FOR EXAMPLE 
SO IT POSSIBLE 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND UH THIS IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE YOU CAN UH THE THE THE PART THAT'S A V. STANDING FOR THE VOLUME 
SO THERE'S A UP ARROW AND A DOWN ARROW 
BUT YOU THE IS THAT IN THE V. 
THE V. APPEARS TO BE THE DOWN ARROW ON THE TOP ON THE TOP UP ARROW IF YOU UP ARROW THERE'S A V. LIKE SO SO IF IT'S TURNING DOWN SO IT'S CONFUSING INTERFACE 
SO I WANNA AVOID THIS KIND OF THING IN THE DESIGN 
AND HERE OR IS UH HERE IS A S SHORT SUMMARY THAT I SUMMARY THAT I COMPILED AFTER THE FINDINGS I FOUND 
BIG BUTTONS ARE CONVENIENT VOICE RECOGNITION HELPS PUSH BUTTONS SCROLL BUTTONS SPINNING WHEELS CAN BE USED AS NAVIGATION TOOLS 
AND UH USER CUSTOMISABLE AS IMPORTANT AND FINALLY SIMPLICITY SIMPLICITY IS THE OKAY 
YEAH 
SO WE HAVE MANY CONCEPTS THERE BUT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE LATER ON WHICH ONES ARE IMPORTANT TO BE USED 
AND BASICALLY UH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
A HELP BUTTON 
SO YOU ARE DISPLAY ON THE SCREEN 
SO ON THE T. V. SCREEN 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO THAT ELIMINATES ALL THE COMPLICATED DOCUMENTATION OKAY 
SO WE 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
WELL UH WHAT I S PROPOSE IS THAT UH YOU KNOW A REMOTE CONTROLLER I IT COULD BE A CUBE 
SO UH A SMALL DEVICE THAT UH LOOKS LIKE A CUBE AND MAYBE YOU CAN JUST CHANGE THE UM THE BUTTONS 
IF YOU CH TURN ON SIDE YOU GOT NO NO BUTTONS YOU TURN THE OTHER SIDE YOU GET THE OTHER BUTTONS 
SO FOR MAYBE NEW GENERATION PEOPLE WHO GET USED TO THE COMPUTER THEY WANT LOTS OF CONTROLS 
SMALL 
YEAH 
LET'S SEE THE MARKET DEMAND 
WHAT WHAT MARKET YES YES 
YEAH 
YES 
YEAH 
MM 
OH 
BIG SCREEN 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
MM 
THE THING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IF YOU ARE IS THE EXISTING SCREEN WE ELEMENT ELIMINATE THE L. C. D. 
AFTER ALL THE L. C. D. JUST TO DISPLAY AND IF YOU HAVE THE COLOURFUL SCREEN YOU CAN MAKE THE DISPLAY COLOURFUL 
FANCY IS FANCY AS THE IN IN THE L. C. D. MAYBE EVEN BETTER 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MORE IN A FANCY DESIGN 
YEAH 
MM 
REMEMBER WE HAVE A S BUDGET FOR THE COST OF PRODUCING THE REMOTE CONTROLLER 
YEAH 
SO I IS IS THE THING SO YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW MUCH AN L. C. D. WILL COST AND THEN WE'LL DECIDE AGAIN 
UH MAYBE YOU CAN FIND OUT THE PRICE AND TELL US NEXT TIME 
SO I IF I 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND ALSO THE COST FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
ASK OUR R. AND D. DEPARTMENT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND UH 
YEAH 
AND ALSO THE SCROLLER BUTTON HOW MUCH WILL IT COST 
YEAH 
DON'T USE THE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IMPORTANT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH YEAH 
SO SO THE AT MOST MORE POWER UH 
YEP 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
I IF MM 
MM 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT THERE'S NO CONTRADICTION HERE BECAUSE IF THERE ARE FEW BUTTONS 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR YOUR CONTROLLER ANY MORE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHERE THE BUTTONS ARE 
SO IF YOU WANNA CONTROL THE SCREEN D SH SHARPNESS YOU JUST SAY SHARPNESS AND THEN YOU TO TURN YOU JUST PRESS LEF INCREASE OR DECREASE BUTTON AND THE SAME FOR THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL 
IF YOU HAD THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THERE YOU JUST SHOUT YOUR CHANNEL 
JUST TELL YOUR CHANNEL AND THEN YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BUTTO AT THE CONTROLLER SO FINALLY THAT WIL ELIMINATES THE THE END FOR L. C. D. 
WITH THE HELP OF SPEECH RECOGNISER YOU CAN YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
A AND 
MM 
WHERE YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
PUT IT BACK TO THE CHARGE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
HMM 
MM 
THE YEAH 
MM YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
THERE'S MM 
MM 
YEAH 
THAT WE CAN WHAT WE CAN DO SO WE CAN PROGRAM A FUNCTION WHEREBY WHEN YOU PRESS THE SWITCH OFF T. V. BUTTON 
THE OFF BUTTON THE REMOTE THERE BE SO UH INSTRUCTION ON THE SCREEN PLEASE CHARGE CHARGE ME 
YOU NEVER GET AT LEAST BECAUSE UH EVERY TIME YOU'RE OFF THE COMPUTER THE T. V. YOU ARE ASKED THE THE COMMAND THE T. V. COM REMOTE CONTROLLER WOULD TELL YOU TO PUT IT BACK TO WHERE TO THE CHARGER 
YEAH 
SO YOU WILL NEVER GET LOST YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS PROGRAMMED INSIDE 
SO IT'S IT'S UH IT'S ALL ABOUT STRATEGY Y 
MM 
MM 
YEAH YEAH 
WITH UH TWO TWO TWO PARTS CONTROLLER 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
THESE ARE PROBL YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
I THINK WE NEED TO DEFINE ALSO A AS THE SET OF VOCABULARIES FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNISER 
BECAUSE UH IF YOU WANT UH SAY WE CAN SORT BY CHANNELS ARE SORT BY T. V. PROGRAMS YOU HAVE TO DECIDE A CATEGORY OF VOCABULARIES FOR THEM 
IF NUMBERS THEY'RE EASY BUT IF NAME THE CHANNEL BY BY NAME 
MM 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
MM 
MM 
MM 
BUT I I I THINK THAT THE USER WOULD LIKE WE WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE THE CHANNEL OR CALL THE CHANNEL RATHER THAN THAN THE NUMBERS 
YOU SAY NUMBE CHANNEL NUMBER FIVE OF THE T. V. CORRESPOND TO SOMETHING ELSE IN THE CHANNEL 
SO SOME PEOPLE MAY WANT TO SAY I WANT TO USE THIS CHANNEL 
YEAH 
CHECK WITH THE V R. AND D. DEPARTMENT THE CAPABILITY OF RECOGNISER 
OH 
WELL IT'S CONVENIENT FOR THE USER 
THE UH UH MM 
MM 
I I THINK THAT I HAVE MM MM I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN DO IS THAT UH YOU CAN UH IF WHEN THE USER CH PRESS A BUTTON TO CHOOSE THE CHANNEL FOR EXAMPLE 
THEN WHAT YOU CAN DO IS THAT THE YOU CAN MAKE THE T. V. SCREEN TO SPLIT THEM INTO SMALL LITTLE LITTLE SQUARES OF IMAGES WHERE YOU YOU YOU HAVE A SNAPSHOT OF EVERY CHANNEL 
SO LET'S SAY IT'S A FOUR BY FOUR MATRIX OF THE IMAGES 
SO NOW WHAT YOU DO IS OF LOOKING AT THE ALL THE SIXTEEN CHANNELS AVAILABLE TO ONE TIME 
YOU JUST USE THE CENTRAL BUTTON UH 
YOU JUST YOU YOU JUST CHOOSE THE THE OPTION YOU WANT AND THEN YOU JUST HIT THE BUTTON AND THEN YOU GO TO THAT CHANNEL 
SO 
MM 
SO YOU YOU DON'T USE THE SPEECH RECOGNISER ON THAT WAY 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH I WANNA WATCH THIS I WANNA WATCH THAT 
MM 
MM 
MM 
HMM 
WELL Y YOU STAY A FIVE MINUTES 
SO WE COME TO THE THIRD MEETINGS 
I HAVE 
GOOD 
UM SO ON THE LAST MEETING WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN AND NOW WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
SO WE 
WILL TALK ABOUT SOME 
SPECIFIC DETAILS 
THIS 
UH THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE DECIDED ON THE LAST MEETING 
BUT IF WE USE BATTERY 
W WELL OKAY 
THERE 
WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THIS BUTTON 
I THINK IT MAKES THE THE INTERFACE REALLY 
GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE 
A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE EMPHASISE THE EASE OF PICTURES 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WE SHOULD INCLUDE SPEECH SYNTHESIS IN THIS CASE NO 
MM-HMM 
OR MAYBE WE CAN INCLUDE THE USER MANUAL IN THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WE SHOULD HAVE JUST A BUTTON LIKE HELP AND YOU SAY UH AND YOU IK YOU PRESS THE BUTTON HELP AND MAYBE YOU USE THE THE USER M MIGHT IN THE ON THE T. V. 
YEAH 
ON T. V. T. V. SCREEN 
SO JUST YOU PUSH THE BUTTON AND WE WILL 
YEAH 
OF THE F 
NO NO THE CASE WHERE THEY NEED HELP IN THE CASE WHERE THEY NEED HELP 
YEAH 
IT'S JUST FOR USER CUSTOMIZABLE FOR KIDS OR OLD PEOPLE 
SO 
SO IT'S THE SAME 
CAN BE USED BY BOTH KIDS AND OLD PEOPLE 
MAYBE FOR KIDS KIDS THEY LIKE UH IT IN L THEY LIKE IT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YOU CAN USE THIS SCREEN INSTEAD OF THE BIG SE SCREEN INSTEAD OF USE THE YEAH 
HMM 
BUT 
YEAH 
MM 
IT'S FOR IT'S JUST FOR SMALL VOCABULARY 
W IT'S NOT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
PUSH PUSH 
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE OTHER BUTTONS ARE NOT NECESSARY ARE IMPORTANT 
BUT THEY ARE JUST LESS USED COMPAR YEAH 
OR MAYBE WE CAN U UH OR MAYBE WE CAN UH MAKE THIS THE TEN PERCENT OF BUTTON MORE BIGGER THAN THE OTHERS 
SO 
MM 
IT'S 
AND I THINK IT'S INCREASES THE COST OF THE THE REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU USE L. C. D. 
I 
YOU WILL LISTEN TO A PEEP SPECIAL PEEP 
OKAY 
YEAH 
BUT YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE THE THE CHARGER 
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT 
OKAY 
MAYBE FOR SOME PEOPLE LAZY PEOPLE 
YEAH YEAH 
MM 
OR 
OR MAYBE YOU HAVE TO TO SHOW SOME SPECIFIC PROGRAMMES FOR KIDS AND THEN JUST JUST YEAH JUST PUSH UH KIDS BUTTON SO IT'S AUTOMATICALLY 
SO IF UH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IT'S YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OR JUST 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TO JUST SAY THE THE NAME OF THE CHANNEL 
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO SAY JUST THE NAME OF THE CHANNEL 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO USE IT UH A CH YEAH BUT YOU HAVE TO TO HAVE ALL THE NAME OF THE CHANNEL ON YOUR VOCABULARY 
OR MAYBE 
OR MAYBE THE USER CAN CREATE HIS OWN VOCABULARY JUST PRONOUNCING THE THE NAME OF CHANNELS AND INCLUDE IN THE VOCABULARY 
OR LETS THE USER CREATE HIS OWN VOCABULARY 
IF CHANNEL 
NO 
JUST YOU HAVE UH IN THE BEGINNING YOU HAVE 
UH TO YOU HAVE TO TURN YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE VOCABULARY BY YOURSELF 
BY ASSOCIATING EACH CHANNEL WITH THE NAME OR 
AND FOR EACH ONE HAS HIS OWN 
OR YOU HAVE TO USE 
YEAH 
MM 
ARE WE CAN SWITCH ON OR SWITCH OFF THE THE SPECIAL YEAH 
MAYBE WE'LL DISCUSS THEM IN NEXT MEETING 
IT'S TIME TO CLOSE THIS MEETING 
YEAH 
OKAY 
THANKS FOR YOUR COLLABORATIONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
BUT PEOPLE ARE OFTEN ENOUGH LOOKING AT THE HELP ONCE THEY USE THE HELP BUTTON THEY SAY UH THIS IS A COMPLICATED STUFF 
IT'S A PSYCHOLOGY 
OKAY 
AND LET US IS WHAT THE MARKET DEMANDS 
WE COULD JUST GO TO MY PRESENTATION 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
I MEAN IT JUST SHOWED US THE REMOTE WITH AN CAP WHICH COULD BE USED FOR KIDS AND IF YOU REMOVE THE 
SOME REMOTE WITH SOME 
BOTH YEAH 
AND THEN WE CAN DECIDE WHAT WHAT WE CAN YEAH 
SO 
WE JUST MADE IN MARKETING SURVEY OF WHAT PEOPLE AND FROM OUR REMOTES AND HOW IT COULD BE SPECIAL FROM THE OTHER REMOTES 
AND WE GET THE BEST ON THE RESPONSES FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRES 
UH WE ALSO HAVE SOME PRIZES FOR THE MOST CREATIVE SOLUTIONS 
AND WE FIND THE FOLLOWING SOLUTIONS WHICH WE COULD WHICH WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR OUR DESIGN 
SO SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE USERS THEY FIND THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS VERY UGLY THEY DON'T FIND IT PLEASANT TO USE IN THE SIZE OR USAGE OR ANYTHING 
AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THEY ARE ALWAYS L I MEAN THEY ARE WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY 
OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY 
AND THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER 
AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS 
SAID THEY ZAP A LOT 
AND FIFTY PERCENT SAY THEY USE ONLY TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS AS THE REST OF THE NINETY PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS THEY'RE NOT USED MOST OF THE TIMES 
SO THESE WERE THE FINDINGS WHICH WE FOUND 
AND ALSO THEY CITED FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE PRESENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
MOST OF FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TIME THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM AND PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SEARCHING FOR THEM RATHER THAN WATCHING THE T. V. 
AND BY THE TIME THEY FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL THE PROGRAM IS FINISHED 
SO THEY'RE FRUSTRATED A LOT 
AND UM OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS TOO COMPLICATED IT TAKES MUCH TIME TO LEARN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT 
SO YOU CAN JUST USE THE PERCENTAGE 
FIFTY PERCENT PEOPLE THEY RESPONDED THAT THEY ALWAYS LOSE THEIR REMOTES AND THIRTY FOUR PERCENT THEY SAY THAT IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO LEARN IF IT'S TOO COMPLEX 
SO KEEPING IN VIEW ALL THESE FINDINGS AND THE FRUSTRATIONS I THINK THIS SHOULD BE THE SOLUTION FOR THEM 
WE SHOULD HAVE AN L. C. D. ON THE REM REMOTE CONTROL 
MM-HMM 
I MEAN IS OUR SURVEY SAYS THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE OF THEIR REMOTES ARE FANCY 
SO IF WE HAVE A L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE RATHER THAN LOOKING INTO THE T. V. YOU JUST LOOK INTO A REMOTE AND NAVIGATE IT 
IT'S THE SAME MENU SO WE HAVE SAW THAT IPOD REMOTE CONTROL 
WE JUST PLAY AROUND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I MEAN THESE WERE THE POINTS WHICH WE GOT FROM THE MARKET DEMANDS 
SO 
THE OTHER ONE 
YEAH THAT'S FINE 
YEAH 
I MEAN THAT'S 
MM-HMM 
OH YEAH WE HAVE UH 
I MEAN THAT SHOULD BE FOUND OUT BY THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNERS 
AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE NO VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE REMOTE CONTROLS 
YEAH IT'S O ONLY FOR A LIMITED VOCABULARY SAY EIGHTY COMMANDS OR SO 
MM THE SCROLL BUTTON FROM THE SURVEY WE NEVER USE THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME SCROLLING BUTTON 
BECAUSE THEY THEY JUST THEY'RE JUST FRIGHTENED TO USE THE SCROLLINGS OR HELP BUTTON 
YEAH 
THEY'RE NOT USED MUCH 
OR IT COULD BE LIKE THIS IS THE PEOPLE SAY IF THEY HAVE A L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE NOT IN THE TELEVISION 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE THE L. C. D. INTO THE TELEVISION SCREEN YOU MISS THE PICTURE IN THE BACKGROUND WE ARE MOST FOCUSED ON THE COMMANDS 
SO IF YOU HAVE THEN L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE YOU JUST HAVE A MENU 
AND INCREASING AND LOWER THESE SIGNS HERE TO CHANGE THE PROGRAMS AND THIS MENU WHEN YOU PRESS THE MENU 
IN THE L. C. D. DISPLAYS AS YOU GO ON PRESSING THE MAIN IT FASTER DISPLAYS VOLUME THEN THE PROGRAM THEN THE BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST AND ALL THE STUFF 
AND ACCORDINGLY YOU CAN JUST INCREASE OR DECREASE 
YEAH THAT HAS TO BE CHECKED OUT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I MEAN BETTER IF WE COULD JUST CHECK ALL THE COST WITH L. C. D. AND ALSO WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
AND THEN WE COULD FIND WHICH WOULD WOULD BE A MORE SUITABLE IN THIS CASE 
AND THE THIRD PROBLEM WAS TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL 
ALWAYS IS FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE SAY THEY ALSO THE REMOTES 
SO 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN BY VOICE COMMANDER 
OR IT COULD BE ALSO SOMETHING LIKE THIS UH IT'S ALWAYS BORING TO CHANGE THE BATTERIES OF THE REMOTES CONTROL 
SO WE HAVE SOME ONE CHARGER THERE AND WHENEVER WE DON'T USE THE REMOTE CONTROL WE PUT IT IN THE CHARGER 
AND WHEN WE'RE USING THAT IT REMOTE AND IF WE MISPLACE SOMEWHERE IN THE CHARGER WE HAVE A SMALL BUTTON 
AND JUST BY PRESSING THE BUTTON ON THE CHARGER THE UH REMOTE CONTROL BEEPS WHEREVER IT IS 
I MEAN TO DO IT ALSO DOESN'T REQUIRE A VOICE COMMAND BECAUSE THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH A VOICE COMMAND 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
I MEAN CHARGER WOULD BE FIXED BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS WITH ELECTRICITY PLUGGED 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
IT'S IN GOOD REMINDER YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
AND OF COURSE THE FINAL POINT IS A FANCY LOOK 
SO WE HAVE SEEN EARLIER THE 
REMOTES WHICH WERE DISPLAYED BY NORMAN THEY WEREN'T FANCY I MEAN MM VERY BIG OR SOMETHING WITH LOT OF BUTTONS 
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO 
I MEAN UH I MEAN UH I MEAN UH YOU SEE IF IT'S LIKE THAT EVEN A KID WHO WANTS TO HAVE A CONTROL UH COULD JUST PLUG IT AND SO IT 
YOU CAN'T AVOID HIM 
BUT YOU CAN HAVE ONE BUTTON FOR CHILD LOCK 
SO JUST BY PRESSING THE BUTTON WITH SOME CODE YOU TO YOU PUT A LOCK ONTO THE REMOTE IS THAT HE CAN'T USE EVEN 
MM UH 
THAT'S RIGHT 
I THINK THESE THREE FOUR POINTS THEY'RE THE MARKET DEMANDS AND SO IT'S FOR THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IT JUST THINK 
YEAH I THINK IT SHOULD BE CLEARER FOR US IN THE NEXT MEETING THAT THE UH THIS COULD BE INCLUDED 
NO WE HAVE A PROBLEM THERE 
YOU USE UH IF YOU HAVE A VOICE COMMANDS AND YOU ARE SO YOU ARE WATCHING A SCORE ON UH BASKETBALL SCORE OR SOMETHING 
AND OF THE SCORE COMES TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE YOU'VE JUST SAY TWENTY FIVE AND SUDDENLY THE SCREEN THE CHANNEL GOES TO TWENTY FIVE 
SO I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A PREFIX TO SOME NUMBERS 
I MEAN THE THE YOU JUST CHECK ALL THE PROBABILITY THAT SAYING T. V. TWENTY FIVE AND JUST ORDINARY TWENTY FIVE 
ORDINARY TWENTY FIVE YOU ALMOST THERE'S A PROBABILITY OF BEING SAID AROUND SIXTY SEVENTY PERCENT AND T. V. TWENTY FIVE 
I DUNNO IT WILL BE AROUND BUT IN OUR TWO PERCENT 
SO IT'S BETTER TO HAVE SOME PREFIX BEFORE THE NUMBER 
YEAH SOMETHING SOME CODE 
THAT WILL BE TOO BIG 
AND IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE VOCABULARY ALSO 
ALSO MIGHT BE YOU JUST FORGOT THE CHANNEL NAME YOU KNO ONLY KNOW THE NUMBER 
THEN 
YEAH THE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
A AND IN THE SAME LINES WE WOULD HAVE A ONE MORE PROBLEM 
IF WE ARE USING THE TELEVISION ON THE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS 
SAY IN THE FACTORIES OR IN THE SHOPS WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE AND THIS VOICE COMMANDS IF THEY FEEL TO WORK 
THAT WOULD BRING A BAD NAME BAD UH REPUTATION FOR OUR COMPANY 
SO I THINK WE SHOULD SPECIFY SOME PRE REQUIREMENTS IF WE WANT TO USE A VOICE COMMANDS 
SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE USED IN AN SILENT HOMELY ENVIRONMENT OR IS SOMETHING 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT SHOULD BE AN OPTION 
I THINK THESE ARE THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS 
SO WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM IN THE DESIGN 
OKAY 
UH IT CAME THERE IN THREE MINUTES BACK SO WE ARE I THINK WE CAN JUST PRESS THE OKAY 
OKAY 
SO YOU ANOTHER THIRTY MINUTES 
OKAY SO I THINK I WILL DO MY PRESENTATION ON THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT IS CAN YOU PLEASE UH OPEN UH 
I'M PARTICIPANT TWO 
COMPONENTS DESIGN 
OKAY SO UH THE FIRST THING UH I HAVE DONE IS IT IT MADE A REVIEW TOGETHER WITH THE UH MANUFACTURAL UH DEPARTMENT AND HAVE WHICH COMPONENTS WAS UH AVAILABLE TO BUILD A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO FOR ENERGY SOURCES WE HAVE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE SOLAR ENERGY 
HAND DYNAMO AND UH KINETIC UM WELL UH KINETIC UH TECHNIQUE TO TO STORE THE ENERGY 
WE ALSO UM WE ALSO CAN PUT A REGULAR BATTERY IN THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
NOW 
YEAH B UH F WELL UH I MEANT UH BY BY BATTERY I MEANT UH I WILL NOT HAVE A UH A WIRE BETWEEN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE ENERGY SOURCE BUT UH I DIDN'T IF WE DIDN'T DECIDE YET WHICH KIND OF BATTERY 
WE WILL PUT INSIDE THE THE REMOTE 
SO UH IT'S A POINT TO DISCUSS 
THEN UH THE CASE MATERIAL WE HAVE UH UH ALSO SEVERAL CHOICES LIKE WOOD RUBBER TITANIUM OR LATEX 
BUT UH WELL 
IT'S NOT A A R UH WELL A REAL ISSUE FOR THE FROM THE TECHNICAL UH POINT OF VIEW 
CONCERNING THE INTERFACE UH WE CAN WE CAN PUT MM JUST SIMPLE BUTTONS OR SCROLLS OR BUTTONS UH MUCH MORE COMPLICATED 
BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE CHIP TO PROCESS THE BUTTON IS MORE COMPLICATED SO 
AND UH THIS IS THE LAST POINT THE CHOICE OF CHIPS 
SO WHAT I HAVE F FOUND IS THAT I THINK BASIC BATTERY OR KINETIC UH ENERGY UH COLLECTION IS THE USE THE BETTER WAY TO PROVIDE ENERGY BECAUSE I THINK SOLAR ENERGY WE WON'T WORK ON A CLUTTERED UH UH ENVIRONMENT 
SO UM SO I THINK WE CAN START WITH THESE TWO MAIN THINGS 
FOR THE CASE UH WELL UH I THINK THAT UH TITANIUM IS UM AS A GOOD CHOICE BECAUSE IT'S TRENDY AND IT'S UH IT'S UH WELL IT'S MODERN AND UH USER OR OR OR MM WILL BE UH VERY HAPPY TO HAVE A A A NICE REMOTE 
FOR THE INTERFACE UH I THINK THAT WE CAN ACH ACHIEVE UH ALL THE DESIRED FUNCTIONALITIES BY IS JUST UH USING UH RUBBER BUTTONS 
SIMPLE BUTTONS AND THE THIS THIS ALLOW TO USE A REGULAR CHIP THAT ARE UH WELL CHEAPER 
AND SO SO UH WE CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE 
YEAH 
WELL UH UH I I IT'S UH IT'S THE THE SHAPE OF THE UM OF THE REMOTE 
YOU YOU WILL HAVE THE WELL UM THE THE CURVE WILL FIT INTO YOUR HAND WHEN YOU GRAB THE 
YEAH 
IT'S MORE CONFOG F COMFORTABLE THAT IF THIS UH IT'S COMPLETELY FLAT 
YEAH THE UM THAT'S THE POINT 
THE KINETIC ONE IS UH Y YOU CAN RECHARGE UH BY THE UM 
YEAH AND BY WILL BUY JUST BY MOVING THE OR UH YOUR ROOM THE MM WELL THE REMOTE WILL UH ACCUMULATE ENERGY 
BUT I D I DON'T KNOW IT'S IF IT IS FEASIBLE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YET OF OF THE USER WILL MOVE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THE REMOTE UM ALL THE NECESSARY ENERGY 
YEAH 
AND YEAH AND SO CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE 
SO AND UH THAT'S UH THAT SUMMARIZE WELL WHAT I HAVE SAID 
SO UH YOU'RE RIGHT WE CAN UH SO IN OUR UH R. AND D. UH OF THE KINETIC METAL IS SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE ENOUGH ENERGY 
THAT'S IT 
OH YEAH I TAKE CARE IT'S ALL RIGHT 
ALL RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM MM MM 
YEAH FINE 
YEAH 
IS A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT UH AS NORMAN SAY IF UH THERE IS UH ALREADY A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AVAILABLE WHO T WHO DO THIS WE WE CAN CHECK UH TO INTEGRATE IT I INTO OUR UH NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
WELL I I THINK YOU IT'S IT'S IT'S FINE YOU HAVE UH REVIEWED ALL ALL THE POSSIBILITIES BUT UH UH WELL UH I IF WE CONSIDER THAT UH THE USER INTERFACE IS DISPLAYED ON THE T. V. SCREEN I DON'T THINK WE N UH WE NEED MUCH BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE SINCE WE WE JUST HAVE TO NAVIGATE AND TO HAVE A KEY OR ENTER KEY OR THINGS LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE UH ADDING WHEELS OR SCROLLS UH MAKES THE THING MORE COMPLICATED AND MORE EXPENSIVE ALSO SO 
YEAH 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
TO HAVE A HELP BUTTON 
YEAH 
IN THE T. V. SCREEN 
IN THE T. V. SCREEN THE UH HOW TO USE YOUR REMOTE 
OH YEAH 
IN A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW 
BUT UH WEL WELL I THINK 
UH WELL 
SO LE LE LET'S SEE WHAT UH WHAT PEOPLE WANT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM THE FUNCTIONALITIES YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL MM W WELL I I I DON'T REALLY SEE THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING UH L. C. D. ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL IF WE HAVE A A A BIG SCREEN AND UH DISPLAY ON THE SCREEN 
IT'S YEAH OF COURSE IT'S FANCY TRENDY AND SO NO BUT IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE AND IT'S NOT REALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU PLAY WITH THE IPOD YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG SCREEN IN FRONT OF YOU SEE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
SO I TH I I WILL I THINK WE WE CAN FOCUS ON THE UH IN THE FANCY LOOK ON THE UH 
IN THE SPEECH RECOGNITION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE BUT WELL I THINK L. C. D. WILL UH WELL UH MAKE US SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR NOT SO BIG RESULTS 
SO PRICE OF UH L. C. D. DISPLAY 
AND 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
AND 
WELL UH COMPARED TO THE TO USE THE SIMPL SIMPLER SIMPLEST BUTTON 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK THAT 
YEAH I I I THINK THAT UH WELL UH SO WE HAVE SEEN IN THE ON THE PRESENTATION UH WELL UH BUT UH UH FIFTY PERCENT OF THE OF THE PERCENT N CHOOSE THE BUTTON IS UH I THINK TO HAVE UH FIVE UH SIMPLE BUTTON IS SUFFICIENT FOR OUR FUNCTIONALITY 
YEAH 
BUT 
BUT THE UH THE THING IS SO I SEE THAT WE CAN ADD A FUNCTIONALITY IN THE ON THE T. V. SCREEN LIKE UH A A LIST OF FUNCTION AND THEN YOU CHOOSE WITH THE WITH THE BUTTON IT WILL YOU NAVIGATE AND YOU 
YEAH 
BUT IF I I IF WE IF WE COULD HAVE A A A DISPLAY UH G A USER INTERFACE THAT IS VERY COMPLETE ON THE T. V. SCREEN I THINK THAT JUST FIVE BUTTONS ARE SUFFICIENT 
ONE TO GO UP LEFT RIGHT DOWN AND UH ENTER AND YOU YOU YOU JUST SELECT THE FUNCTIONALITY YOU WANT TO ACCESS OR THINGS LIKE THAT 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TO SWITCH IT A CHANNEL TO ANOTHER UH 
YEAH BUT 
YEAH BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE L. C. D. YOU YOU DON'T LOOK AT THE T. V. SCREEN SO I I IT'S NOT REALLY WORTH TO GET TO HAVE THE IMAGE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL SO WE WE CAN THINK ABOUT A WELL A A VOCAL COMMAND LIKE UH FIND AND WHEN THE REMOTE CONTROL UH HEARS FINE WELL YEAH JUST UH TO MAKE HIM BEEP OR IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
PUT 
YEAH 
AND THAT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT'S SIMPLE LIKE IN PHONES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH IF THERE IF THERE UH THERE IS NUFF NOT ENOUGH BATTERY 
ALSO AND UH UH THE REMOTE IS LOST 
YEAH 
OKAY 
THEY WERE UGLY 
THEY 
WELL THE LAST ONE WITH THE UM 
YEAH WITH THE TWO PARTS WAS UH ORIGINAL SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL WE CAN THINK ABOUT UH HAVING UH IN THE ON THE ON THE USER INTERFACE WHEN YOU SWITCH ON THE T. V. YOU CAN UH WILL WRITE A CODE OR CHOOSE A CATEGORY 
IF IT IS KIDS UH THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO FOR MM YEAH 
SO FOR MY PART I WILL CHECK THE PRICES THE UM THE PRICES DIFFERENCE UH OF WHAT IT IS WHERE IT IS AND SO UH AND SO NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK WE CAN WE CAN HAVE JUST NUMBERS FOR CHANNELS AND YOU CAN EASY TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL LIKE UH SPORTS AND THEN ON THE T. V. YOU HAVE A LIST WITH WITH UH UH WELL WITH SPORTS PROGRAM PLAYING NOW AND AND UH 
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH YEAH 
WELL BUT WELL E EVERY POSSIBLE WORD HE HAS A PROBABILITY TO COME BIT OF THE T. V. S 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH BUT WELL OKAY 
YEAH YEAH 
MM MM 
WELL I 
YEAH 
WELL I UH I ALSO 
I I ALSO THINK ABOUT UH ANOTHER PROBLEM 
IF IF THERE IS UH MORE THAN ONE PERSON WHO IS WATCHING T. V. THE AS WELL THE THE SPEECH UH R RECOGNISER SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO 
BECAUSE UH I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A YOUNG CHILD WITH MY SISTER WE YEAH WE ALWAYS WANT IT W TO WATCH DIFFERENT EMISSION AT THE AT THE SAME TIME SO IT'S A PR IT COULD BE A PROBLEM OF UH F WELL IF SOMEONE PASSES BY WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING T. V. AND SAY UH T. V. THIRTY AND JUST RUN 
SO 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S WELL I THINK THAT'S A GOOD UH A GOOD OPTION BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLE AND UH SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT ALSO SO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO I SEE YOU 
GOOD MORNING 
WELL 
WELL UH I'M UH AND MY UH FUNCTION IS USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
I THINK 
SO UH THAT'S ME 
UM IT 
OH 
SO WE CAN'T ERASE ANYTHING 
ALRIGHT 
IT'S A SHAPE 
A BEAVER 
IT'S WEIRD 
IT HAS WINGS 
WELL THE SNAIL DOESN'T HAVE LEGS 
OH RIGHT 
WELL 
IT'S A GIRAFFE 
OR A DINOSAUR 
YES 
GIRAFFE 
SHOULD I UH 
ALRIGHT 
SO I CAN DRAW BUT UH 
OH 
WELL 
OH 
OH WRONG ONE 
OH 
WELL UH YOU CAN GUESS WHAT IT SO I HOPE 
IT'S A RABBIT 
AND UH WELL UH IT'S UH QUICK I GUESS 
THAT'S UH MY UH FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
A DOLPHIN 
RIGHT 
WELL 
WITH AN A. 
YOU CAN TRY TO THE ERASER NOW 
NOT REALLY 
I ALWAYS LOSE THEM 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SEARCH FOR THE BUTTONS WHICH ONE IS WHICH AND UH 
WELL 
PERHAPS THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF ROAD REMOTES R ROAD CON REMOTE CONTROLS 
YES PERHAPS YOU CAN INTEGRATE THEM OR SOMETHING 
YES 
YOUR STEREO AND YOUR T. V. AND UH 
PERHAPS THAT'S AN IDEA 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
AND WHICH YOU DON'T SEE 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE IT IT 
CHANGING CHANNEL 
YES 
BUT YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE EVERY BUTTON THEY NEED ON IT 
BECAUSE UH THINGS FOR UH TELETEXT I DUNNO UH W WHAT'S THE NAME 
YEAH 
BUT 
BUT IF IF IT'S IF IT'S INTERNATIONAL YOU SHOULD UH LIKE AN THINK IN BRITAIN THEY HAVE UH DIFFERENT THINGS THEY CAN DO WITH THE T. V. 
OR IS UH THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO USE 
I DUNNO IF YOU SHOULD UH TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION OR THAT YOU JUST SHOULD AIM FOR THE NORMAL T. V. IS THAT UH 
AND THE B. B. C. 
YES 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF THE THEY HAVE THAT ANYWHERE ELSE THOUGH 
YEAH WE CAN LEAVE THAT 
YEAH 
WELL BUT BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO TO FIND YOUR OTHER REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU WANT TO SEARCH 
THAT'S NOT 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S UH 
WELL NOT EVERYWHERE 
YEAH YOU CAN CHOOSE THE CODE 
YEAH 
BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE A NEW TELEVISION AND C IF YOU LOOK INTO THE FUTURE THEN THEY WANT WILL WANT THE BUTTON OF OTHER THING IS BROKE 
YEAH 
GUESS NOT 
YEAH MEETING WILL CLOSE IN FIVE MINUTES 
HMM-HMM 
NO INTERFACE 
IN THE YEAH 
SO 
SO I SHOULD LOOK AT UH WHAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO WITH THE REMOTE OR UH OR HOW I DON'T REALLY 
RIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
UM IT 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
GOOD MORNING 
SORRY 
YEAH BUSY JOB 
GOOD MORNING 
SO 
OH GOOD MORNING EVERYONE 
I'D UH LOOK AT WELCOME YOU TO OUR FIRST MEETING 
I'VE PREPARED A LITTLE PRESENTATION 
MY NAME IS AND UH I HOPE YOU WILL INTRODUCE YOURSELF UH IN A FEW MINUTES AS WELL I 
UM I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER OF THIS PROJECT AND UH WELL I WILL TELL YOU ON WHAT ACTUALLY IS THE PROJECT 
THIS IS UH THE AGENDA FOR OUR FIRST MEETING 
UM THIS IS THE OPENING THEN WE WILL GET I WILL HOPE WE WILL GET ACQUAINTED TO EACH OTHER 
WE'LL DO A LITTLE TOOL TRAINING WITH THESE TWO THINGS 
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROJECT PLAN 
OH THERE WILL BE TIME FOR DISCUSSION 
ACTUALLY WE HAVE TO DISCUSS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CREATE A PRODUCT 
AND THEN WE WILL CLOSE THIS SESSION 
UM BUT FIRST OF ALL WE I'D LIKE TO UH INTRODUCE YOU TO THIS ROOM 
UM SO YOU PROBABLY HAVE NOTICED THERE ARE LITTLE BLACK UH FIELDS ON THE TABLE 
UM YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR LAPTOP EXACTLY ON THAT FIELD SO THE LITTLE CAMERAS CAN USE YOUR FACE 
UM THERE ARE CAMERAS 
EVERYWHERE AROUND THE ROOM ESPECIALLY HERE FOR YOUR FACE OF COURSE AND THIS ISN'T A P 
IT'S A A SET OF MICROPHONES AND THERE ARE MICROPHONES HERE ALSO 
BUT PLEASE UH DON'T BE AFRAID OF THEM 
THEY WON'T HURT YOU 
UM WELL UH I SAID I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER AND UH I'M HOPING UH FOR A GOOD PROJECT AND UH I'D LIKE TO HEAR UH WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOUR FUNCTIONS ARE UH IN THIS PROJECT 
LET'S START WITH THE LEDS 
OKAY SO I 
OKAY WELL WE HAVE SOME EXPERTISE FROM UH DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE OF THE COMPANY 
THAT'S GOOD 
UM WELL I SAID UH WE'RE WORKING ON A PROJECT AND THE UM FOR THE PROJECT IS IT TO CREATE A TO DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL WHICH HE HAS TO BE ORIGINAL 
TRENDY AND OF COURSE USER FRIENDLY 
AND UH I HOPE WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO CREATE SUCH A PROJECT SUCH A PRODUCT 
UM THE WAY WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE THAT IS UH THE FOLLOWING METHODS 
IT CONSISTS OF THREE PHASES NAMELY THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DETAILED DESIGN 
SO YOU CAN USE ALL OF THESE PHASES CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS NAMELY INDIVIDUAL WORK PART AND A MEETING WHERE WE WILL DISCUSS UH OUR WORK AS FAR 
OKAY 
BUT FIRST I WILL UH TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE TOOLS WE HAVE HERE 
I ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES BUT THEY ARE NOT OF UH MUCH AS IT IS 
OH 
WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE TWO THINGS 
THEY ARE SMART BOARDS 
SO YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN GIVE A PRESENTATION ON THEM 
AND UH THIS ONE HERE IS A WHITE BOARD 
I WILL UH INSTRUCT YOU ABOUT THAT SOON 
UM SO YOU ALSO NOTICED UH THIS PRESENTATION DOCUMENT IS IN OUR UH PROJECT FOLDER AND EVERY DOCUMENT YOU PUT IN THIS FOLDER UH SO UH IT IS POSSIBLE TO SHOW THAT HERE IN OUR MEETING ROOM 
UM AND YEAH THERE ARE AVAILABLE ON BOTH SMART BOARDS BUT I THINK WE WILL UH MAINLY USE THIS ONE FOR THE DOCUMENTS IN THE SHARED FOLDER 
SO YOU CAN USE THIS IS THE SAME TOOL BAR UH IS IS LOCATED HERE 
UM THE MOST FUNCTIONS UH WE WILL S WILL BE TO TO ADD A NEW PAGE 
UM UH TO GO BACK AND FORWARD BETWEEN PAGES AND OF COURSE UH TO SAVE IT VERY NEW AND THEN 
UM AND THIS IS THE PEN WITH WHICH YOU CAN DRAW ON THE BOARD FOR INSTANCE 
LIKE THIS IF EVERYTHING'S OKAY BUT I FIRST HAVE TO PUT IT IN THE PEN YOU SEE I'M NOW IT IT IT 
UM AND THEN YOU CAN WRITE THINGS LIKE TEST OR WHATEVER YOU WANT 
SO YOU CAN SEE YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT A LITTLE BIT SLOW IT'S NOT SUCH A FAST BOARD IT'S A SMART BOARD BUT ALSO A SLOW BOARD 
UH BUT YOU CAN WRITE THINGS AND OF COURSE YOU CAN ALSO WHEN YOU CLICK HERE UH ERASE THINGS SO WE HAVE UH EST LEFT 
AND UM YOU CAN ALSO DELETE AN ENTIRE PAGE BUT WE ASK YOU NOT TO DO THAT 
JUST SIMPLY CREATE A NEW ONE AND UH START ALL OVER BECAUSE WE WANT TO SAVE ALL THE RESULTS 
UM DOES EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THIS 
NICE APPLICATION 
WELL YOU CAN ERASE IT WITH THE ERASER BUT UH YOU SHOULDN'T DELETE AN ENTIRE PAGE BUT JUST CREATE A NEW BLANK ONE 
I WILL DELETE THIS ONE NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T USE IT YET 
BUT YOU CAN OF COURSE ERASE WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE BUT DON'T UH DELETE ENTIRE PAGES 
AND YOU CAN ALSO UM LET'S SEE I THINK IT'S HERE UH CHANGE THE UH COLOUR OF YOUR PEN 
FOR INSTANCE TAKE A BLUE ONE AND UH CHANGE THE LINE WIDTH LOOK AT FIVE 
UM THAT'S WHAT YOU WILL NEED FOR OUR FIRST EXERCISE BECAUSE I'M UH GOING TO ASK YOU TO DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
IT'S ALSO IT GETS TO KNOW EACH OTHER BECAUSE UM I'M ASKING THREE THINGS UH FOR THAT UH DRAWING TO DO IT IN A BLANK SHEET 
WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS AND I JUST SHOWED YOU HOW TO PICK A COLOUR AND ALSO WITH DIFFERENT PEN WIDTHS WHICH I ALSO SHOWED YOU 
UM AND A FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTIC CAN BE JUST UH ONE WORD 
WELL I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT DRAWING BUT I WILL UH GO FIRST 
AND UM TRY TO DRAW 
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD GUESS WHAT I'M DRAWING UH 
WELL IT UH 
COULD BE EVERYTHING 
MAYBE WHEN I PUT IN 
THIS THING 
IT COULD BE A TURTLE OR A SNAIL AND 
BUT A TURTLE HAS 
AND THESE ARE SLOW 
AND I HOPE OUR PROJECT GROUP WILL NOT BE SLOW BUT WE WILL UH WORK OUT A GOOD RESULT AND DO IT UH AS FAST AS WE CAN 
OKAY TIME FOR ANOTHER ANIMAL 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO NEXT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
COULD YOU WRITE THE WORDS UH UNDERNEATH IT 
OR MORE WORDS 
LITTLE RABBITS 
OKAY THANK YOU 
AND OUR FINAL DRAWING 
MM-HMM 
OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I CAN SEE WE HAVE SOME UH DRAWING TALENT UH IN THIS GROUP HUH 
WELL NICE ANIMALS NICE WORDS 
SOUNDS GOOD 
UM BACK TO BUSINESS BACK TO THE MONEY PART 
UM FROM THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT I HAVE LEARNED THAT WE ARE AIMING FOR A SELLING PRICE OF TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
AND WE'RE HOPING FOR A UM OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS AND UH WE ARE HOPING TO ACHIEVE THAT UH BY AIMING FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET 
AND THE PRODUCTION COST WILL BE TWELVE EURO FIFTY MAX 
OKAY WELL IT'S TIME UH FOR SOME DISCUSSION 
I'VE WROTE DOWN SOME EXAMPLES HERE OF WHAT WE CAN CAN SPEAK ABOUT 
UH WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTE CONTROLS UM WHAT KIND OF IDEAS DO YOU HAVE TO DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
MAYBE FOR WHICH MARKET SEGMENTS SHOULD WE UM OR SHOULD WE AIM FOR ALL SEGMENTS 
UH WELL ACTUALLY I'D LIKE TO HAND THE WORD UH BACK TO YOU 
WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTE CONTROL 
MM-HMM 
BORING IT'S NOT FUN TO USE A REMOTE 
MM-HMM 
WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE IT FINE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
SO MAYBE A A MINIMALIST DESIGN THE LAST UH POSSIBLE AMOUNT UH OF BUTTONS 
MM-HMM 
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO BOTHER PEOPLE WITH UH LOADS OF BUTTONS 
BUT IN THE OTHER HAND THEY NEED MANY BUTTONS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF THEIR SEAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY WELL ANY MORE IDEAS 
NO 
OKAY YEAH WELL WE HAVE SOME TIME 
LET'S SEE WHAT MORE I HAVE TO TELL YOU 
I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH LEFT 
NOPE 
WE'RE STARTING TO CLOSE 
UM OUR NEXT MEETING UH WILL START WELL WE'RE A LITTLE BIT EARLY BUT OUR NEXT MEETING WILL START IN IN THIRTY MINUTES 
IN THE MEANTIME UH THERE'S TIME FOR SOME UH INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS 
UM SO YOU CAN USE THE DIFFERENT ROLES HAVE UH DIFFERENT TASKS 
AND THERE'S A PING 
SO AT MY LAPTOP 
YEP 
UH WELL THAT'S GOOD FIVE MINUTES AND UH THE MEETING'S OVER UH RIGHT ON SCHEDULE 
UM THE MARKETING EXPERT WILL UH WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION 
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER WILL WORK AT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
AND THIS WAS THE INTERFACE DESIGNER 
OR THE INTERACTION DESIGNER 
OR WHAT WAS IT I. D. 
INTERFACE DESIGNER OKAY FIRST GUESS WAS RIGHT 
UH WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE THE WORKING DESIGN 
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER OKAY SORRY 
LET'S JUST USE THE ACRONYMS 
UM AND OF COURSE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS UH WILL BE SENT TO YOU UH THROUGH YOUR PERSONAL COACH 
UH WELL THOSE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE UH IN THE EMAIL YOU WILL RECEIVE UH SHORTLY I HOPE 
AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN UH EXPERTISE 
WELL UH THAT WAS WHAT I HAD TO SAY 
UH ARE THERE ANY MORE QUESTIONS 
NO 
OKAY WELL I THINK THEN WE HAVE IT HAD UH BACK TO OUR OFFICES AND UH START WORKING 
OKAY ONE QUESTION 
OKAY WE'RE STILL GOING 
OKAY WELL I EXPECT EVERYTHING WILL BE MUCH CLEARER WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS WE WILL RECEIVE UH SHORTLY 
OKAY WELL UH SO YOU ALL IN ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES THEN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
GOOD MORNING 
OKAY UH I'M UH I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND I H HOPE TO UH LOOK FORWARD TO UH A VERY UH PLEASING UH AND IF THIS UH PROJECT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
HMM 
SEAL A SEAL 
A B 
MM 
WITH A TAIL AND A MOUTH 
SNAIL 
OKAY 
SURE 
THE HALL 
MAKE THAT CAT 
TALL 
BU 
BUNNY RABBIT 
OKAY 
OKAY UM 
UH I UH DRAW I I'VE DRAWN A DOLPHIN BECAUSE OF ITS INTELLIGENCE 
ONE OF THE MOST INTELLIGENT UH 
ANIMALS IN OUR WORLD 
YEAH INTELLIGENT 
I'VE I'VE UH ERASER 
OPEN 
WELL NOT PERFECT BUT OKAY 
A LOT OF BUTTONS 
AND YOU ALWAYS LOSE THEM 
A LOT OF BUTTONS WHICH YOU DON'T USE OR WH YOU DON'T USE COMPLEX 
NOT USER FRIENDLY 
MM 
BLACK COLOURS 
THEY USE BATTERIES AND BATTERIES UH AND POOR SIGNAL 
OH 
YEAH DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS YEAH 
UH FOR THE EASE OF DIFFERENT UH DEVICES 
YEAH BUT YOU COULD UH I THEN UH THERE'S A POSSIBILITY TO GO UH TO UH 
TO PUT THOSE BUTTONS UH BEHIND SOME UH KIND OF UH PROTECTION SO THAT IF YOU YOU YOU ONLY GOT TO USE THEM WHEN YOU NEED 'EM 
THAT'S POSSIBLE IS THAT YOU ONLY GOT THE NO NO NO NO 
JUST UH FOR EXAMPLE YOU GET THE UH THE SAME SIZE UH REMOTE CONTROL YOU USE EVERYDAY 
BUT UM THE USUAL BUTTONS SUCH AS UH UM ZAPPING UH SO YOU CALL IT IN DUTCH 
UH AND THE VOLUME CONTROL UH ARE ONLY THE ONLY POSSIBLE BUTTONS UH TO USE DIRECTLY 
OR UH THE NUMBERS OF COURSE 
BUT UH NOT UH THE BUTTONS USED TO SEARCH ON THE THE CHANNELS IN YOUR TELEVISION 
YOU ONLY USE THIS UH THE FIRST TIME OR 
SO 
OH 
YEAH I THINK SO YEAH 
YEAH UH TELETEXT 
THINK SO 
OKAY 
RIGHT 
OH 
YEAH I I UNDERSTAND 
NO 
YEAH 
WHEN I THINK IF IT UH I THINK THE MAIN IDEA UH OF THIS REMOTE REMOTE CONTROL IS UH 
TO MAKE IT USER FRIENDLY 
SO UH I THINK UH WHEN P UH WHEN UH THE CUSTOMERS WILL BUY THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
THEY ALREADY HAVE UH THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH UH COMPANIES UH UH WITH UH THE THE STANDARDS UH REMOTE CONTROL WITH WHICH COMES UH WITH THE TELEVISION 
SO UH IT ONLY HAS TO HAVE UH THE MOST USED BUTTONS 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO INTEGRATE THE BUTTONS TO SEARCH THE CHANNELS IN YOUR TELEVISION 
NO THIS ONE THAT 
YEAH BUT I BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UH TO ACCOMMODATE UH ACCOMMODATE UH ALL THE BUTTONS ON THE S IN THE DIFFERENCE DIFFERENT TELEVISIONS SETS ON ON REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
BECAUSE UH FOR EXAMPLE SONY TELEVISION HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE TO MAKE UH UH TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR IT IS IN ONE SIDE OF THE SCREEN UH TELETEXT 
AND IN THE OTHER SIDE UH JUST AN UH REGULAR TELEVISION 
OH 
YEAH BUT UH THEY DON'T USE THE SAME SIGNAL UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL 
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE A PANASONIC UH REMOTE CONTROL IN A IN A PHILIPS TELEVISION 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
BUT UH I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE UH THE UH WILL BUY THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE BECAUSE UH THE FIRST THEY LOST THE ONE THEY LOST FIRST ONE OR THE FIRST ONE IS BROKEN 
SO UH UH PERHAPS THEY HAVE A GOT A AN OLDER TELEVISION SO THAT OPTION IS NOT UH OPTIONAL FOR THIS UH PEOPLE 
YEAH YEAH 
SO WE SHOULD TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION 
UH MM NO 
THINGS'LL COME UP 
STOP THE MEETING NOW 
OKAY 
MM 
NO 
IN THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE WORKING DESIGN AND THE ONE UH USABILITY INTERACTION YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
NO 
OKAY 
OH 
NO PROBLEM 
OKAY 
ALRIGHTY 
OKAY 
MY NAME'S 
I'M UH MARKETING EXPERT 
MY JOB IS IN THE COMPANY TO PROMOTE COMPANY OR PROMOTE PRODUCTS AT THE CUSTOMERS 
SO I ALSO UH HOPE WE HAVE A PLEASANT UH WORKING WITH UH WITH EACH OTHER 
MM-HMM 
SO 
GOOD 
NO 
DINOS DINOSAUR 
BEAVER 
TURTLE 
NO PROBLEM 
NO PROBLEM 
MM 
IT WAS FOUR MONTHS 
NICE OKAY 
TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER 
NO IT'S A GIRAFFE 
'KAY 
I THINK IT'S 
EASY TO OUR UH IT 
RECOGNISE AS A GIRAFFE 
YEAH THE FAVOURITE CHARIS CHARACTERISTIC IS THAT THE LONG NECK IT CAN REACH EVERYTHING 
AND I HOPE I CAN ALSO REACH A LOT WITH THIS PROJECT 
SO THAT'S MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW 
UH UH 
TALL 
SO 'KAY 
IT'S A MOUSE 
A BUNNY RABBIT 
UH-HUH 
NO PROBLEM 
BOB ROSS 
DOLPHIN 
YEAH 
COMPLEX 
NO 
NO 
BORING 
NO 
BLACK ALL BLACK 
SO YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
THE THE ANGLE YOU HAVE TO USE 
YOU HAD DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS FOR DIFFERENT DEVICES 
YES 
YEAH BUT THEN AGAIN YOU YOU STILL HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS SO 
FLAP YEAH 
YEAH OKAY THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT'LL GET VERY BIG THE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NUMBERS 
ONE AND OFF 
YEAH PLAY PAUSE STOP 
MM-HMM OF COURSE 
NO 
YEAH 
BECAUSE I THINK A MARKET WILL BE ALL KIND OF PEOPLE 
ELDERLY P EL ELDERLY YOUNG PEOPLE USE 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE BETTER ONE BECAUSE 
I THINK IF YOU YOU'RE GOING TO TARGET A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THE WHOLE WORLD AND ONLY BRITAIN THEN I THINK THE COST WILL UH RISE HIGHER THAN THE TWELVE FIFTY 
I THINK 
I THINK THE UM IS BETTER TO USE UH THE WHOLE WORLD AND BRITAIN YEAH 
NOT THAT MUCH 
MM 
STANDARD DELIVER 
MM 
NO BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH THE IT IT'S I THINK THAT'S NOT 
YEAH OKAY 
NO 
I THINK ONE UM IN MOST TELEVISIONS NOWADAYS DO THIS 
SO I THINK NUMERALS 
YEAH BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE THE THOSE ALWAYS WITH R UNIVERSAL REMOTES YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE THE CODE 
YOU CAN SEE WHICH WHICH TYPE OF TELEVISION YOU HAVE 
THAT'S NO PROBLEM 
BUT I THINK LIKE THE TWO PAGES ON THE SAME SCREEN LIKE TELETEXT AND NORMAL TELEVISION THAT'S THAT'S NOWADAYS STANDARD I THINK 
SIMPLICITY 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH G AVAILABLE 
TRUE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OF COURSE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
INTERFACE 
UH-HUH 
NO 
I HAVE ONE QUESTION 
WHERE DOES IT SAYS WE HAVE TO MAKE A REMOTE BECAUSE I PRESUMED 
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO 
OKAY NO NO PROBLEM 
NO PROBLEM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
CHOOSE A NUMBER 
YES 
WELL 
WELL EVERYBODY ALREADY HAS HIS PRESENTATION SO YOU CAN ADJUST IT 
YEAH 
OH RIGHT 
THERE IS SOMETHING TRAINING 
YEAH I'VE GOT IT THERE IT 
YEAH 
SHALL I G UH NEXT 
'KAY 
SO 
WELL UH MY NAME'S AND I LOOKED AT UH TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN OF THE REMOTE 
UH I DID THIS BY UH LOOKING AT EXAMPLES OF THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS OF HOW THEY UH THEY LOOK AND INFORMATION FROM THE WEB THAT I FOUND 
UM WELL WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT UH THE THE ACTUAL USE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO TELEVISION SET 
HOW YOU UH DO WHAT YOU DESCRIBED UH JUST EARLY 
AND THIS CAN BE ALL SORTS OF MEDSA MESSAGES TURN IT IN TURN IT OFF UH CHANGE THE CHANNEL ADJUST VOLUME THAT KIND OF THING 
UH PLAY VIDEO TELETEXT BUT ALSO TO UH PLAY C. D. IF YOU USE IT YOUR C. D. PLAYER THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL THAT ONE 
THERE ARE SOME UH EXAMPLES OF REMOTE CONTROLS 
YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT 
THE ONE HAS GOT ALL THE FUNCTIONS THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY AND AND ONE LOT OF UH BUTTONS ETCETERA 
AND THE OTHER IS UH MORE USER FRIENDLY LITTLE WITH BIG BUTTONS 
AND UH NOT IN ALL THE THE THE THE STUFF YOU CAN DO WITH IT BUT UH THE THE ESSENTIAL STUFF IS THERE 
UM I GUESS YOU COULD BETTER Y YOU SHOULD LOOK AT A A USER CENTRED UH APPROACH 
BECAUSE THE CUSTOMERS HAVE TO USE THEM AND AND IF THEY DON'T THINK IT'S USABLE THEY WON'T UH BUY IT 
A LOT OF BUTTONS THEY MAY THINK FROM I DON'T NEED AS AS MUCH IS THAT 
UH WELL PERF PERSONAL PREFERENCES IS IS UH A SIMPLE REMOTE WITH UH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS THAT YOU CAN AND THAT YOU COULD USE 
BUT UH KEEP IN MIND THE NEW FUNCTIONS OF T. V. WHAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER SPLIT SCREEN AND UH SO THAT A FUNCTION THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE 
BECAUSE ALL THE T. V. S WILL HAVE THEM 
OR BECAUSE OF ONLY A FEW AND ISN'T REALLY NECESSARY 
AND THEN UH MAKE IT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT YOU CAN COULD UH IS IT IN MORE THAN ONE APPLIANCE 
IF YOU HAVE ONE THAT HE HE DOES WITH THE V THE THE VIDEO 
IT COULD ALSO WORK WITH UH WITH THE STEREO BECAUSE PLAY IS PLAY AND STOP STOP AND THAT SORT OF THING 
THE SHU C YOU COULD REUSE THE BUTTONS SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS FOR UH ANYTHING 
AND IT SHOULD BE A USER FRIENDLY CLEAR BUTTONS AND NOT TOO MUCH 
AND THAT IS MY PRESENTATION 
YOU MUST STILL HAVE TO OPEN 
YEAH 
HMM 
MM 
OH RIGHT 
NO 
RES I DID NOT 
PERHAPS THE REST 
OH 
MM 
WELL YOU SAID IT SHOULD ONLY UH WORK WITH ONE APPLIANCE 
OR WITH AN UH D CHE ONLY THE T. V. 
AND THE VIDEO ALSO OR NOT UH 
OH 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THEN IT SHOULD HAVE UH ON OFF AND UH 
YEAH 
AND PER PERHAPS UH 
NO 
WELL UH UH YES YES SO SH A BUTTON WHERE YOU CAN UH CHANGE FROM ONE NUMBER TO TWO NUMBERS 
CAN YOU DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOT A NAME BUT 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SO YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT NO NO 
MUTE MISSCHIEN ALSO 
NO 
BUT DO YOU 
BUT IF YOU WOULD DO AN L. C. D. SCREEN DO WE HAVE DON DON'T YOU HAVE ANY BUTTONS 
OR BECAUSE IF IT ONLY DIRECTS AT THE T. V. THEN YOU ONLY HAVE UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH 
OH RIGHT SO YOU CAN 
OH YEAH ALRIGHT 
SO YOU CAN ADJUST WHICH BUTTONS YOU WANT ONE THAT S SCREEN 
YEAH ALRIGHT OH RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WOULD BE YEAH 
WELL WE HAD TWELVE FIFTY I GUESS FOR UH PRODUCTION 
YEAH 
I DUNNO HOW EXPENSIVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN IS 
ANY GUESSES 
YEAH 
BUT 
BUT UH ALSO SAID THAT WE SHOULD NOT ONLY FOCUS ON THE YOUNGER PEOPLE 
BUT ALSO IN THE OLDER AND WELL THEY USE IT IF IT ONLY HAS AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
UH IS STILL A LITTLE BIT PEOPLE 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO ALIENATE THE OTHER UH 
BUT IF THEY ALSO BUY IT THEN IT'S ALRIGHT 
I GUESS 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
NO YES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT PERHAPS LATER SO UH 
YEAH 
I DON'T 
WELL PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE A BACKUP PLAN THAT WE WOULD USE BUTTONS IF IT'S UH TOO EXPENSIVE 
YEAH 
THE L. C. D. 
OH THAT'S A BIT OF A PROBLEM 
OH THAT'S A BIT OF A PROBLEM 
YEAH BUT THEY DON'T THEY DON'T LIKE IT 
THEY THINK IT'S UGLY 
WHEN IT HAS AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
OH ALRIGHT I THOUGHT THAT YOU SAID THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
A MUTE BUTTON 
I THINK 
AND 
YEAH 
BUT 
BUT SHOULDN'T YOU PUT A BUTTON F FOR TELETEXT ON THE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE IT 
REMEMBERING WE HAVE GOT A BIG REMOTE THAT YOU HAVE TO FILL 
YEAH 
YEAH THEY ARE LESS IMPORTANT BUT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE THERE ARE NOT 
LIKE WITH A WITH A MOUSE YOU HAVE NOT YEAH 
WE SHOULD THINK OF THE TWELVE FIFTY WE HAVE BUT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT'S GOING TO UH 
YEAH 
YOU SHOULD PERHAPS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO SWITCH THE CONTROL OFF 
IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN THAT'S BURNS ALL THE TIME I DUNNO 
YOU SHOULDN'T ON AND OFF BECAUSE THAT'S VER EXTRA 
THAT YOU HAVE TO FIRST YOU HAVE TO TURN THE REMOTE ON AND THEN YOU CAN UH I DON'T KNOW 
NO THAT'S THAT'S UH YEAH 
BUT THEN YOU CAN'T 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH AU AUTOMAC MATICALLY THAT IT YEAH 
YEAH 
IF IT'S SENSIBLE 
YEAH 
YEAH BU WHEN THE BATTERIES ARE LOW 
BUT YOU'LL ALSO FORGET TO PUT IT IN BECAUSE YOU THROW IT IN THE COUCH AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER 
YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK THE BATTERIES SHOULD SHOULD WE SHOULD WORK A LOT LONGER THAN A COUPLE OF DAYS OR NOT 
'CAUSE 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT BUT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TO USE HAVE SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN PUT A REMO RECHARGER NEAR YOUR COUCH BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO WALK A LONG WAY WHEN YOU TWOFT WANT TO TURN ON THE T. V. 
YEAH 
I THINK EVERYTHING HAS TO FOUR AND I GUESS 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH TWELVE FIFTY TWELVE FIFTY 
SO IT'S PRETTY BIG 
YEAH 
W I KNOW LET'S DO A SPEECH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU CAN CLAP OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
NOW YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THE WRONG THING I DUNNO 
BUT THEY WANT TO TALK INTO THE REM REMOTE CONTROL OR SOMETHING OR 
UH BUT DO WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT THAT ARE 
YEAH 
I KNOW 
MM 
WELL 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT CAN BE DONE WITH THE COST OF TWELVE FIFTY 
WITH THAT UH 
YEAH BUT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO IMPLEMENT THAT THAT YOU SAY VOLUME UP AND THEN IT GOES UP OR 
OH 
THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IF WE GO INTERNATIONAL 
THEN UH IT'S Y IT'S YOURS TO DO A FRENCH AND DUTCH AND ENGLISH AND 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU CAN USE ICONS FOR THE 
A SPEAKER AND UH 
BUT IF THAT'S BETTER THAN LANGUAGE FOR THE FOR THE REMOTE 
THEN IT'S YEAH 
WELL IF IT COULD BE DONE W 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE UH ANYTHING MATTERS 
WELL YOU SHOU YOU SHOULD TO ADJUST THE THING 
YEAH 
AND YOU HAVE TO SPEAK THE IS THAT IT CAN UNDERSTAND 
YOU COULD USE THAT ONE IS AN OPTION IF YOU HAVE MONEY LEFT OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
LET'S DO SPEECH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
I WITH UH TELETEXT IF IT WASN'T VER VERY IMPORTANT IT WAS BUT YOU ALSO NOW HAVE COLOURS 
I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT THAT 
YEAH WHEN YOU PRESS THE RED BUTTON YOU GO TO PAGE ONE HUNDRED TWO AND WHEN YOU PRESS THE 
I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT THAT BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT TELETEXT NOT REALLY IMPORTANT BUT YEAH THE SHORTCUT AND YOU CAN'T GO TO SEPARATE 
YEAH 
'CAUSE IT SHOULD BE THERE 
SO ACTUALLY IT IS THERE BUT IT'S JUST NOT R READY THERE 
YOU'LL HAVE TO SEARCH FOR IT 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S A 
I GUESS NOT 
WE'VE GOT ANON 
HAVE GOT GOT TWO EXAMPLES HERE BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING WE'RE MISSING 
WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE VIDEO ORDERS 
YEAH YOU COULD LOOK HERE ALL THE THE 
UH TH TH TH TH I DON'T KNOW TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
THEY'RE A BIT SMALL YOU CAN WE SHOULD STRETCH THEM BECAUSE 
I GUESS WE'VE GOT THEM ALL 
AND FOR A T. V. 
CAN YOU ZOOM IN A T. V. 
OR THAT YOU CAN PUT 'EM IN UH NO NO WOOD AND YEAH 
BUT THAT SHOULD ALSO BE A SUB THEN A SUB UH MAIN THING 
YEAH SO WE SHOULD ALSO IMPLEMENT SE SCREEN SETTINGS 
OH RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH SO YOU CAN PROGRAM THE 
YEAH SO THE FIRST YOU USE THE MENU AND THE OTHER ONES YOU CAN UH GO TO UH 
YEAH 
I HOPE WE CAN DO THIS 
WE DON'T HAVE TO USE THAT TOP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND DO WE WANT THEM IN DIFFERENT COLOURS OR 
AND AND THE BUTTONS SHOULD THEY HAVE COLOURS 
UH BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTONS 
YEAH 
THEY THINK IT'S UGLY RIGHT 
PERHAPS YOU CAN UH MAKE ADJUSTABLE FRONTS LIKE WITH THE TELEPHONES 
YOU CAN UH BUT I DON'T THINK THAT UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
A DISCO VERSION 
FIVE MINUTES 
OH YEAH RIGHT 
SO YOU CAN PROGRAM THE T. V. 
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD YOU'D THROW THEM IN IN IN ONE PILE 
SO OPTIONS AND THEN YOU SUB THEM 
OTHERWISE YOU HAVE ALL THOSE TELETEXT PERHAPS TELETEXT NOT BUT 
YEAH BUT I 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT 
I DON'T KNOW 
OR DO WE HAVE ANY BUTTONS 
IN THE REMOTE 
WHICH ONE 
BUT THAT'S ALSO IN THE L. C. D. RIGHT 
SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY NORMAL BUTTONS THAT UH IN ALRIGHT 
YET ON AND OFF IS UP SO PERHAPS YOU KNO 
NO NO 
UH WELL YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SET WHICH T. V. YOU HAVE 
IF YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE UH 
YEAH 
BUT ISN'T DO IT IS UH UH WHAT YOU SAID UH NORMAL ON AND OFF BUTTON FOR THE T. V. THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE A 
YEAH BUT BUT NOT FOR THE REMOTE BUT FOR THE T. V. THAT YOU SEE 
BUT A NOTE IS NORMAL BUTTON ON THE L. C. D. YEAH 
NO YOU JUST TAP I THINK 
BUT 
YEAH A YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S HANDY TO HAVE A IN A NORMAL ONE BUTTON 
A OR JUST UH RUBBER UH FOR FOR T. V. S YOU CAN TURN IT ON AND THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE THE CHANNEL 
OTHERWISE YOU I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S 
YEAH YEAH 
TO TURN IT IN 
OF OR YOU SHOULD PUT IT IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH I HAVE YEAH 
WELL I I GUESS IF YOU USE THE L. C. D. SCREEN YOU FIRST HAVE TO SEARCH WHERE IS THE ONE BUTTON 
THEN YOU UH Y YOU THEN TURN IT AND THEN THE T. V. GOES ON 
BUT IF YOU HAVE A NORMAL ONE BUTTON ON THE ON THE REMOTE THEN YOU DO THE ONE AND THEN YOU SEARCH THE CHANNEL WHICH YOU WANT 
OH RIGHT 
YEAH I THINK SO IT 
OTHERWISE Y WET E K YEAH 
YEAH 
IF WE CAN AFFORD IT 
ALRIGHT 
LUNCH 
SHOULD WE PUT THIS BACK IN OUR ROOMS OR UH 
YEAH 
GOOD MORNING AGAIN 
ALL SET 
GOOD 
OKAY 
LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND HERE 
OKAY 
A VERY WARM WELCOME AGAIN TO EVERYONE 
UM HERE WE ARE ALREADY AT OUR UH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING 
UM AND THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO 
THE OPENING WHICH WE ARE DOING NOW UM AND THE SPECIAL NOTE I'M PROJECT MANAGER BUT IN THE MEETINGS I'M ALSO THE SECRETARY 
WHICH MEANS I WILL MAKE UH MINUTES SO I DID OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
AND UH I ALSO PUT THIS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE IN THE UH PROJECT FOLDER SO YOU CAN USE THEM AND REVIEW WHAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED 
UM IF I'M RIGHT THERE ARE THREE PRESENTATIONS I GUESS EACH ONE OF YOU HAS PREPARED ONE 
GOOD 
AND UM WE WILL ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS UM IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT THEM YET 
AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE TO TAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS AND WE HAVE SOME MORE TIME FORTY MINUTES 
BUT I THINK WE WILL NEED TO 
UM WELL I DON'T KNOW WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST WITH HIS PRESENTATION 
YOU CAN GO FIRST OKAY 
SO THERE IN ORDER 
I HAVEN'T 
AND ONE QUESTION UH YOUR NAME DENNI IS IT WITH A 
U. I. E. I. E. OKAY 
THANK YOU 
SORRY 
YEAH IT'S A LITTLE BUG IT'S IN THE ON THE SMART BOARD 
OKAY THANK YOU 
YEP 
PLEASE 
OKAY THANK YOU 
OKAY THANK YOU 
UM WELL THANK YOU ALL HUH 
I DUNNO UH DID EVERYONE RECEIVE AN EMAIL WITH UH THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 
NO 
WELL 
THEN I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING THAT I MADE A SEPARATE SLIDE OF THEM AS YOU CAN 
ALL READ THEM 
UH WELL NOT IN THIS PRESENTATION 
HMM 
SHOULD BE IN THERE 
WELL I CAN TELL YOU THEM UH FROM MY LAPTOP 
UM TELETEXT DOES HAS BECOME OUTDATED SINCE THE POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET 
SO THAT'S UH THE FIRST THING WE I THINK WE SHOULD PAY LESS ATTENTION TO UH TELETEXT 
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR THE TELEVISION OTHERWISE THE PROJECT BECOMES MORE COMPLEX 
WHICH ENDANGERS THE TIME TO MARKET AND OF COURSE WOULD MAKE IT MORE COSTLY I THINK 
UM OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS ARE WITHIN THE AGE GROUP OF FORTY PLUS 
AND NEW PRODUCT SHOULD REACH A NEW MARKET WITH CUSTOMERS THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN FORTY AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE 
AND UH A LAST POINT BUT ALSO VERY IMPORTANT OUR CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD STAY RECOGNISABLE IN OUR PRODUCTS 
WHICH MEANS THAT ARE UH CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEW DESIGN 
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND 
UM WELL UH ACCORDING TO OUR AGENDA IT'S THEN TIME TO TAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS 
SO WHO HAS ANY IDEA ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE ON IT AND WHAT SHOULDN'T 
YEAH 
ONLY BE USED FOR TELEVISION 
WELL IT SAYS ONLY FOR TELEVISION HERE HUH 
MAKES IT A LOT EASIER HUH 
MM-HMM 
UH WELL NEW PRODUCT SHOULD REACH A MARKET WITH CUSTOMERS THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN FORTY AND NOW WE HAVE CURRENT CUSTOMERS UH OF FORTY PLUS 
MM-HMM 
SO WE'RE GOING FOR AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
AND HOPING THAT WHEN WE PRODUCE A LOT IT WON'T BE TOO EXPENSIVE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO L. C. D. TO USE 
OKAY 
AND WHAT ELSE 
YEAH OKAY 
BUT FOR NOW IT'S L. C. D. 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH AND MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE SOMETHING FANCY OUT OF AN L. C. D. REMOTE BECAUSE IT'S NOW SO FAR AS I KNOW 
OKAY WHAT ELSE DOES OUR REMOTE AND 
MUTE BUTTON 
MM-HMM 
YEAH AND WE COULD MAKE AN A A SEPARATE MENU ON THE L. C. D. UH SCREEN FOR TELETEXT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
AND MAYBE A LOW BATTERY INDICATOR 
IN THE SCREEN 
SO WE ARE GOING FOR THE FOR THE RECHARGER 
OKAY 
YEAH ALSO 
OKAY WELL I'VE 
YEAH YOU HAVE SOME MORE 
POINTS 
AND YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION 
EVEN BIGGER THAN FOR L. C. D. 
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGES 
SPEECH RECOGNITION SCORES EVEN HIGHER HUH 
YEAH WELL MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE COST BUT UH NOBODY KNOWS UH HOW MUCH UH IT WILL COST UH 
BUT WOULD TO BE USEFUL TO IMPLE IMPLEMENT BOTH 
NO NO REMOTE 
OR 
YEAH I DUNNO 
SO IN SPEECH RECOGNITION 
OR 
YEAH AND THEN WE HAVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES 
OKAY JUST MAKE A SEPARATE REMOTE FOR EACH UH 
OKAY SO WE ONLY DO THIS WHEN WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY LEFT 
OKAY 
WELL I'VE WRITTEN DOWN IN IN ONE OR OFF BUTTON VOLUME SELECTION CHANNEL SELECTION UH THE DIGITS FROM ONE TO ZERO HUH 
UM OR FROM ZERO TO NINE 
UH A DIGITS BUTTON TO SWITCH UH BETWEEN ONE AND TWO DIGITS MUTE BUTTON A SEPARATE MENU FOR TELETEXT A BATTERY INDICATOR 
UM WE'RE GOING TO USE A DOCKING STATION AND UH PROBABLY L. C. D. AND IF THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY SPEECH RECOGNITION 
AND UH THE POSSIBILITY TO UH ENLARGE BUTTONS ARE TO HAVE LARGE BUTTONS 
IN GENERAL 
OKAY SO NOT TOO MUCH TELETEXT SUPPORT BUT IN A SEPARATE MENU AND 
OKAY BUT NO MORE BUTTONS OR FUNCTIONS ARE 
AREN'T WE FORGETTING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT 
PING 
YEAH 
AND A S THROUGH UH 
OKAY WELL THAT'S THE 
SIGNAL FOR LAS FINAL FIVE MINUTES 
UM SO I HAVE UH THE THINGS I JUST READ 
UM THEN WE HAVE UH SEPARATE MENUS FOR TELETEXT SCREEN SETTINGS AUDIO SETTINGS AND WHAT ELSE 
CHANNEL SETTINGS 
OKAY 
NO WE SAID TELETEXT ALSO A SEPARATE MENU 
OKAY BUT WE CAN WORK THAT IT LATER I GUESS 
SO WE'RE HAVING A A GENERAL MENU WITH THE MOST USED FUNCTIONS UH TELETEXT SCREEN SETTINGS 
AUDIO SETTINGS CHANNEL SETTINGS AND MAYBE THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR THE REMOTE ITSELF 
LIKE UH LARGE ICONS OR SMALL ICONS AND 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE BUT 
YEAH BUT IN THE L. C. D. HUH 
RIGHT YEAH OKAY 
BUT WE DON'T NEED A SPECIAL WE DON'T NEED A SPECIAL OPTIONS MENU FOR THE REMOTE ITSELF 
OKAY 
WELL MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A SEPARATE BUTTON APART FROM THE L. C. D. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TURN IT IN WHEN THE L. C. D. S OFF 
SO HOW DO YOU TURN THE THING ON 
THERE HAS TO BE A ONE BUTTON ON THE REMOTE HUH 
TAP THE THING 
OKAY 
AND THEN THE TELEVISION IS ONE ELSE OR JUST THE REMOTE 
SURE 
OKAY WELL 
YEAH 
SO ACTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A A BUTTON LESS UH REMOTE 
NO BUTTONS AT ALL 
OKAY WELL THAT'S MIGHT BE A UNIQUE SELLING POINT HUH FOR A REMOTE 
OKAY WELL I GUESS WE HAVE TO 
POSTPONE FURTHER DISCUSSION AT UH OUR NEXT MEETING BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME 
UM FOR NOW WE'RE HAVING A LUNCH BREAK 
AND THEN THERE WILL BE UH HALF AN HOUR FOR THE UH NEXT SHARE OF INDIVIDUAL WORK 
I WILL UH WRITE UH MINUTES OF I CAN CREATE THEM OUT OF THIS 
AND UH PUT THEM IN THE THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS UH FOLDER 
AND HERE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS FOR THE FOR THE OTHER ROLES 
AND OF COURSE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU AGAIN BY YOUR UH PERSONAL COACH 
LUCKILY AS WE ARE 
OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR NOW AND UH HAVE A NICE LUNCH HUH 
ONE QUESTION 
SOUND 
SUBMIT 
MM 
YEAH 
I'LL GO FIRST 
OKAY 
I'LL GO FIRST YEAH 
SO 
HUH 
OKAY UM 
OKAY UM I WANTED TO EXPLAIN THE WORKING DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S POSSIBLY VERY HANDY IF YOU WANT TO UH DESIGN ONE OF THIS 
UM 
WELL SO IT BASICALLY WORKS UH SO I UH UH RE WROTE DOWN UH IN THIS UH LITTLE UH SUMMARY 
UH WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON UH THAT'S WHEN YOU DO PR FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU UH WANT TO TURN UP THE VOLUME 
UM A LITTLE CONNECTION IS MADE UH THE THE RUBBER UH BUTTON JUST PRESSES ON A 
IN A LITTLE PRINT PLATE UH WHICH UH MAKES UH UH A CONNECTION THAT UH 
GIVES THE CHIPS UH WHICH IS UH MOUNTED BENEATH THOSE UH THAT PLASTIC OF A RUBBER BUTTON 
UH SENSES THAT A CONNECTION HAS BEEN MADE AND KNOW AND KNOWS WHAT BUTTON YOU PRESSED BECAU UH FOR EXAMPLE THE THE VOLUME UP OR VOLUME DOWN BUTTON 
UM UH THE THE CHIP UH MAKES A MORSE CODE UH LIKE UH SIGNAL WHICH UH THEN IS IS UH SIGNALLED TO UH SEVERAL TRANSISTORS WHICH MAKES UH WHICH SENDS THE SIGNAL TO A LITTLE LIT 
YOU KNOW WHAT A LOT SO 
OKAY 
AND THAT MAKES UH THE THE INFRA RED LIGHTS SIGNAL WHICH IS SENT TO THE TELEVISION SET 
UH WHICH HAS A SENSOR ON IT TO UH SENSE UH THE SIGNAL OF THE INFRA RED 
THAT'S BASICALLY UH HOW IT WORKS 
UM THE FINDINGS UH UH THAT I FOUND UH SEARCHING UP SOME UH DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE THAT UH THEY ARE VERY EASY TO PRODUCE 
UH IT IS PIS UH IT'S POSSIBLE TO UH MAKE THEM IN MASS PRODUCTION BECAUSE IT IS IS IS IT IS IS EASY AS UH PRINTING A PAGE 
UH JUST UH FIBREGLASS PLATE UM SO BE UH SO UH COVERED WITH UH SOME UH COATINGS AND UH UH 
AND CHIPS 
UH AND THE TECHNOLOGY'S ALREADY AVAILABLE 
WE DON'T HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW REMOTE CONTROLS UH HAVE TO WORK OR UH HOW THAT HOW UH TO MAKE SOME CHIPS THAT ARE POSSIBLE TO UH TO TO TRANSMIT THIS UH SIGNALS 
UH I MADE A LITTLE UH 
OH 
ANIMATION OF ABOUT HOW A TRAN OUR UH REMOTE CONTROLLER WORKS 
WE TEL 
THERE 
OKAY 
UH WELL THE SUB COMPONENT I SUPPOSE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT A SUB COMPONENT IS EASE OF IN THIS EXAMPLE IT'S THE BUTTON 
UH WHEN IT IS PRESSED DOWN UM THE SWITCH IS TRUE IS UH IS SWITCHED ON 
SO WITH UH THE WIRE IS SENT TO THE AT THE CHIP ON UH CO OPERATION WITH THE BATTERY OF COURSE 
BECAUSE IT MAKE UH A A SIGNAL POSSIBLE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF UH 
L UH A D D UH ELECTRONIC UH 
YES UH OKAY 
UM WE AFTER IT'S BEING COMPOSED BY THE CHIP UH THE SIGNAL UH IS TRANSPORTED UH AT THE INFRA RED BULB 
AND FROM THERE IT SIGNALS A MORSE CODE LIKE SIGNAL TO THE AT THE B TO THE BULB IN UH IN THE TELEVISION SET 
OKAY 
SO UH I WROTE DOWN SOME PERSONAL PREFERENCES BUT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL 
OF COURSE IT IS VERY HANDY IF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS HAND HELD SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO UH UH WIND IT UP OR SOMETHING 
OR JUST SO IT'S IT'S VERY LIGHT TO UH TO MAKE UH TO USE IT 
UH I PERSONALLY UH PREF PREFER THAT UH IT WOULD BE P UH COME AVAILABLE IN THE VARIOUS COLOURS AND UH EASY TO USE BUTTONS 
BUT I SUPPOSE THAT THE ONE OF THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS UH UH THOUGHT OF THAT UH IT 
AND IT IS POSSIBLE FOR SEVERAL DESIGNS AND UM EASY TO USE B OH SORRY EASY TO USE BUTTONS 
PERHAPS SOFT TOUCH UH TOUCH SCREEN UH BUTTONS BECAUSE UH THE RUBBER BUTTONS ARE ALWAYS UH UH THEY UH SLIGHTLY UH THEY CAN BE SLIGHTLY DAMAGED 
UH IS THE NUMBERS ON THE BUTTONS ARE NOT POSSIBLE UH TO READ ANYMORE 
AND UH WELL SO I SAID UH BEFORE THE UH WE CAN UH MAKE SEVERAL DESIGNS 
OKAY WELL THAT'S MY CONTRIBUTION TO THIS MEETING AND UH 
TWO OF THIS THIS MEETING 
SO 
OKAY 
HMM 
MM 
MM 
UH L. C. D. SCREEN IS AN UH TOUCH SCREEN 
OKAY 
'KAY 
OKAY 
NO 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH FOR 
STANDBY OPTIONS YEAH 
OH YEAH 
TWO IS TWO TWO DIGITS OH OKAY 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN 
YEAH 
IT MAKES IT TWELVE YEAH 
INDEED 
OKAY 
WELL NOT REALLY AND AND THERE ARE SOME MODELS THAT DON'T UH ACCOMMODATE THAT FUNCTION 
SO D UH WHA THE PHILIP'S TELEVISION MAKES IT POSSIBLE IN THAT INDEED TO UH PRESS ON AND THEN TWO TO MAKE UH THE UH TJ TO REACH CHANNEL TWELVE 
BUT UH ALL THE TELEVISION MAKES UH SO IF THIS BUTTON WHERE YOU FIRST PRESS THAT BUTTON AND THEN PRESS TWO DIGITS TO UH TO GET 
OH YEAH THINK SO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WE WE COULD YEAH 
BUT I THINK THAT UH THAT COLLIDES WITH OUR MISSION TO MAKE IT VERY CHEAP 
BECAUSE L. C. D. SCREENS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE 
A TOUCH SCREEN UH PROBABLY UH EVEN MORE 
SO TRUE TRUE 
BUT UH 
WELL UM SO IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN UH HOW WAS THE INFORMATION 
SO PERHAPS WE SHOULD WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH BUT UH WELL WE NOT UH 
EXCEED OUR UH OUR UH PRODUCTION UH 
SO IT POSSIBLE TO FIND OUT ANYWAY 
YOU KNOW 
NO NO L. C. D. SCREEN'S JUST LIKE UH LIKE A DRAWN HERE 
UM JUST UH DISPLAYS SEVERAL BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE UM IF YOU WANTED THE MINIMAL UH IS B UH BUTTONS 
SUCH AS CHANNEL AND VOLUME 
YOU JUST UH UH DISPLAYS FOUR BUTTONS ON THE SCREEN AND IT'S POSSIBLE TO P UH PRESS THEM DOWN JUST LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN 
YEAH WE CAN MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DO THAT YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S MY UH 
YEAH 
TWELVE FIFTY 
UM 
WELL I SUPPOSE WE OF THE MORE OF OUR UM 
OF THE I IF THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN L. C. D. SCREENS WE SHOULD MAKE 'EM 
AND IF THAT IS OUR D UH MARKET SHARE IT UH AND OUR GOAL TO UH DELIVER THOSE UH REMOTE CONTROLS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
IT'S TREASURE 
I HOPE WE UH UH AND LET'S HOPE TO REACH THOSE UH THOSE SALES 
YEAH CAN YOU M UH SO I THINK THAT THAT THEY WILL SEND YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT UH THE COST OF L. C. D. UH SCREENS 
UH SO IF YOU UH YEAH SO IF YOU UH YOU RECEIVE AN EMAIL ABOUT THAT 
UH CAN YOU POST IT IN THE OR SHOULDN'T WE POST THAT ONE UH OUR PROJECTS MAIL UH FOLDER 
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE THE MARKETING UH EXPERT 
I UH 
YEAH SURE SURE 
MM 
IT'S LOOKS FANCY ONE YEAH OF L. C. D. SCREEN 
MM YEAH 
AND THEN NOT YEAH 
UM 
YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THERE'S ALSO A 
A SH BUT IN A SUB SUB MENU OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UH I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO UH MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO UM HOW DO YOU CALL IT IN ENGLISH UH 
IT NOT USE BATTERIES AND SO C UH BUT UH BATTERIES TO UH TO BE YEAH YEAH SURE 
INDEED 
SO UH YOU CAN MOUNT UH THE THE THE UH 
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL TO ME 
TO REFILL THE 
YEAH 
OKAY BECAUSE I UH WHEN YOU GET AN L. C. D. SCREEN YOU RUN IT ON BATTERIES THE BATTERIES WILL BE UH EMPTY VERY SOON VERY FAST 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
AND GO TO STANDBY MODE WHEN YOU DON'T USE IT IS THAT 
YEAH AUTOMATICALLY 
AFTER TWO MINUTES OR THREE MINUTES SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
SURE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH IS UH WE UH WATCHING YOUR TELEVISION YOU HAVE TO PUT IT 
YEAH SURE OF COURSE 
YEAH BUT 
BUT YOU ALSO FORGET TO BUY BATTERIES AND THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN'T USE IT SO I 
YEAH 
HIGH POWER USER CELL I 
UH IT SHOULD BE UH A STANDARD MOVE TO TO PUT YOUR REMOTE CONTROL IN THE CHARGER WHEN YOU'RE DONE WATCHING TELEVISION 
THAT'S ALSO A A A GREAT ADVANTAGE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LOSE IT ANYMORE 
BECAUSE YOU ARE OBLIGED TO UH PUT IT IN THE CHARGER AND NOT TO UH LEAVE IT IN A COUCH UH BETWEEN SOME CUSHIONS 
OKAY 
YEAH IT HASN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BIG 
YEAH JUST JUST A CABLE OR A EVEN A A A A A CHARGER WHERE YOU CAN MOUNT IT IN 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST U 
OKAY 
FUNCTIONAL DESIGNS UH FOR THE ELDERLY UH YOU COULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ENLARGE THE SCREEN 
SO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO NOT UH DISPLAY UH A BUTTON TO TEN POINTS UH OR 
YEAH BUT IT IS UH ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS YOU HAVE TO UH SPECIFY 
BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK AT UH UH PERHAPS UH FORTY BUTTONS TO A SCREEN BUT THE ELDERLY ONLY LOOK AT TWO BUTTONS 
OKAY 
SPEECH RECOGNITION 
HELLO 
TWELVE EURO TWELVE EURO FIFTY 
WELL SPREAD OUT BY A BIG MARKET 
WELL LET'S LEAVE IT ALL THE REMOTE CONTROLS AND JUST PUT A MICROPHONE ON TOP OF THE TELEVISION IT 
YEAH YEAH 
TURN VOLUME UP 
HEY THAT THAT'S AN IDEA 
OKAY WELL THAT SHOULD IT HAS TO BE REMOTE CONTROL UNIT 
YEAH 
SURE WHY NOT WHY NOT 
YEAH MM 
YEAH 
PERHAPS THE OPTIONS SHOULD BE UH 
WHY NOT 
WHY NOT 
LET'S HOPE UH TO HAVE SOME UH DO 
WE SHOULD DO IT 
YEAH 
SURE 
YEAH 
CERTAIN SYSTEMS ALREADY EXIST I THINK 
TRUE YEAH 
YEAH 
THIS SHOULD BE UH ACCOMMODATED WITH SOME SOFTWARE UH UH 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
SWAHILI 
SWAHILI 
YEAH 
INDEED 
YEAH 
SO WE WANT TO UH YEAH IT'S INTERNATIONAL UH OKAY 
OKAY 
YOU IT SHOULD BE DONE 
IF IT COULD BE DONE SHOULD BE DONE 
THAT'S NOT SO DIFFICULT AT ALL BECAUSE I ALREADY S IN SEVERAL VOICE OPERATED SYSTEMS AND THEY ARE ALL POSSIBLE TO UH NOT ALL ABOUT 
YEAH SURE INDEED 
FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
OH YEAH 
S SHORTCUTS 
OH 
MM 
SH YEAH JUST JUST SUB MENU 
YEAH 
NOT DIRECTLY UH AVAILABLE 
OKAY 
MM 
DIRECTLY AVAILABLE 
SO DOES IT CONFUSE UH THE USER 
OH 
I'LL SEARCH UM 
IF YOU WANT TO USE TELETEXT YOU CAN PUSH THE TELETEXT BUTTON AND THEN THE OPTIONS UH BECOME AVAILABLE 
NO 
MINE 
MM 
THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS DEPENDING UH ON WHAT KIND OF TELEVISION YOU GET 
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET A WIDE SCREEN TELEVISION YOU DON'T NEED THE UH THE SCREEN SETTINGS UH FOR UH 
YEAH AND OF THE TELEVISION DOES NOT SUPPORT SUCH UH OPERATIONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
COLOURS I THINK THE MAIN COLOUR OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS UH THE COLOUR OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
I BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT A LOT A DEVI YEAH A DEVICE SELF S GO 
OKAY SO SO UH VERY UH LOT OF UP 
ADJUST WITH PHONES YES 
OKAY 
TWELVE EURO FIFTY 
WELL MAKE IT AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT COLOURS YOU MEAN 
SURE 
RED WHITE BLUE BLACK 
GREY 
YEAH SEA VIEW YES SIMPSON'S VERSIONS AND 
LEAVE 
YEAH 
MM 
NO 
UH NOT BUTTON 
YEAH SURE OF COURSE YOU AND UH A SETTINGS BUTTON UH OR A SETTINGS OPTION FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
JUST TAP IT 
YEAH IT SHOULD BE IN STANDBY MODE BUT 
A A A NORMAL BUTTON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL OR NORM 
YEAH BECAUSE UH WHEN YOU TOUCH THE L. C. D. SCREEN WHEN IT IS IN STANDBY MODE IT SHOULD POP ON 
WH UH WHY WOULD TO BE A A NEED TO HAVE A NORMAL BUTTON 
MM 
I THINK IT LOOKS A LOT MORE FANCY IF YOU USE UH IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTONS ON THE S IN ONE REMOTE CONTROL 
OH OKAY 
OH 
MM 
OKAY 
FOOD 
YEAH THINK SO 
YEP YEP YEP YEP 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WELL SHALL I GO FIRST WITH THE USERS 
I THINK WELL OKAY NO PROBLEM 
JA PRECIES JA PRECIES JA PRECIES 
A. A. A. 
ANIMATION 
INFRARED LIGHT 
AT THIS MEETING 
SMOKING 
'KAY 
CHECK 
KIJKE 
'KAY SO 
WE'RE GOING TO J DISCUSS THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE REMOTE THAT UM THAT MEANS THAT FUNCTIONS USER N WANT TO HAVE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL OR JUST 
YEAH AND THE USERS ACTUALLY 
THE METHODS I I PREFER SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK WHICH SECTION OF THE USERS WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS A L IN MORE 
OR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE GOING TO BUY THE REMOTE CONTROL OR THE ELDERLY PEOPLE 
AND THEN THE THAT SECTION WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS AND ADJUST THE REMOTE MORE TO THAT SECTION THAN THE WHOLE USER 
SECTION 
OKAY 
SOME DATA 
YOUNGER PEOPLE FROM SIXTEEN TO THIR FORTY FIVE UM YEARS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN FJ FEATURES LIKE L. C. D. SCREENS SPEECH RECOGNITION E ETCETERA 
AND WE POSSESS ABOUT TWO THIRD OF THE MARKET FROM ONE THAT RANGE OF GO 
THE ELDERLY PEOPLE FROM FORTY FIVE YEARS TO SIXTY FIVE YEARS OR NOT THAT MUCH INTERESTED IN FEATURES 
AND WE POSSESS LESS THAN TWO THIRD THAT'S TWO FIFTH OF THE MARKET SHARE IN THAT ARE 
GOOD SO 
'KAY 
FINDINGS 
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE USERS LOSE THEIR REMOTE OFTEN 
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT VERY SMALL LIKE UH LIKE A MOBILE PHONE OR SOMETHING 
BUT SOME SOMEWHAT BI BIGGER THAN SMALL SO YOU DON'T LOSE IT THAT MUCH ANYMORE 
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS ALSO FIND IT UGLY AND FIF SEVENTY FIVE OF THE USERS ZAP A LOT 
SO THE BUTTONS SH SHOULD BE THAT SMALL OR SHOULDN'T BE THAT COMPLEX BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THE BUTTONS WHICH ONE OR YOU GOING TO USE 
NEXT 
IMPORTANT ISSUES ABOUT THE REMOTE 
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER WITH A PERSONAL REFERENCE BUT OKAY 
REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO HAVE TO HAVE A LOW POWER USAGE BECAUSE SO WE 
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS ONLY ZAP ONE TIME IN HERE IS THE POWER USAGE IS ALSO IN IN TIME IN HERE 
OR IS WITH A HIGH POWER USAGE WE WOULD 
IS A LOT OF BAT BATTERIES 
THE VOLUME BUTTON AND THE CHANNEL BUTTONS ARE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL IS THIS THEY THOSE HAVE TO UH BE FOUND VERY EASILY 
AND HAVE TO BE SOMEWHAT LIKE BIGGER 
ETCETERA 
IT HAS ALSO BE HAVE TO FIND EASILY WHEN THE LABEL IS AGAIN 
MY COLLEAGUE ALSO ANNOUNCED IT THAT LABELS SHOULD BE SCRATCHED OFF OR WOULD BE SO UH 
SENDEN OKAY 
SO UH IF THAT'S K UH IF THAT'S THE PROBLEM YOU ALSO HAVE TO FIND IT EASILY 
IN THE REMOTE 
BUTTONS 
LIKE WHAT ALL COLLEAGUES SAID HAVE TO HAVE TO BE MINIMALIZED 
OR SHOULD BE COVERED OR AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
L. C. D. SCREEN IS EASY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN WE HAVE THE VARIOUS OPTIONS 
PUT AN OPTION AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ALL THE BUTTONS OF THAT OPTIONS IS THE OTHER OPTIONS WOULD BE AGAIN 
AND YOU DON'T USE THE BUTTONS 
SO L. C. D. SCREENS SHOULD BE EASY 
BUT AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
THE PROBLEM WITH THE L. SC L. C. D. SCREEN IS THAT ELDERLY PEOPLE FR FROM FORTY FIVE TO FOR SIXTY FIVE YEARS DON'T USE THE L. C. D. SCREEN A LOT 
SO WE HAVE TO THAT KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT L. C. D. SCREEN 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT THAT HARD TO LEARN OR TO USE 
YEAH TOUCH SCREEN YEAH 
THE LAST BUT NOT LEAST YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE MORE CRITICAL ABOUT THE FEATURES 
BECAUSE THEY USE THE REMOTE CONTROL OFTEN MORE OFTEN AND ARE MORE TECHNICAL THAN THE OL OLDER PEOPLE 
AND THE OLDER PEOPLE SPEND MORE MONEY AND EASILY IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IT TO FOCUS NOT A LOT NOT THAT MUCH ON THE YOUNGER PEP YOUNGER PEOPLE BUT ALSO SOMEWHAT ON THE ELDERLY PEOPLE 
AND IN MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES I DON'T HAVE ANY UM MORE TIME TO COME WITH THAT BUT LIKE I SAID 
L. C. D. SCREEN IS EASILY TO USE BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOU CAN IMPLEMENT A LOT OF BUTTONS ON ON REMOTE WITH NOT THAT MUCH BUTTONS 
AND IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE 
ESPECIALLY THE VOLUME BUTTONS THE CHANNEL BUTTES BUTTONS AND THE NUMBER BUTTONS TO ZAP THROUGH THE CHANNELS 
AND THAT IS IT 
JA 
BE TELEVISION 
ONLY THE TELEVISION 
SO YEAH THEN YOU CAN YEAH 
REQUIREMENTS NO 
FUNCTIONS 
YEAH THE BASICS THEN BY A VOLUME CHANNEL ONE TILL TWO ZERO NUMBERS ON IT UH TELETEXT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 
UM OTHER FUNCTIONS 
YEAH I HAD 
YEAH YEAH 
I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT A BUTTON WITH A S SO WHAT WHICH ESPECIALLY DO THAT BECAUSE SOME T. V. S 
IF YOU PRESS THE IT ON AND THEN THE TWO TO BE BETWEEN FIVE SECS IT MAKE TWELVE AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT RELAXED 
IT EASIER 
YEAH 
SO THAT IT EASY AND FAST 
YEAH 
OUR MAIN TARGETS' AGE ARE 
WERE 
FORTY FIVE PLUS OR 
FORTIES OKAY BECAUSE BECAUSE YOUNGER PEOPLE USE 
UH YOUNGER PEOPLE HAVE NOW SIXTEEN TILL TO TWENTY FIVE AGE ARE F EIGHTY ONE PERCENT INTERESTED IN L. C. D. SCREEN 
FROM TWENTY SIX TO THIRTY FIVE HAVE SIXTY SIX PERCENT AND THIRTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE FIFTY FIVE PERCENT SO I THINK IT UM 
BECAUSE IN MOST RECOG REMOTE CONTROLS UM THE PRINT PLATE WILL BE BROKEN HOW MUCH TWO YEARS 
YOU HAVE TO PRESS UH VERY HARD TO GO TO THE NEXT CHANNEL 
WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN IT'S EASIER BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE TO WIPE THE SCREEN TO UH FOR FINGERPRINT AND THEN YOU CAN USE IT AGAIN 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH BUT A YOU DON'T KNOW 
TRUE 
YEAH IT ONLY SAYS THAT THIS PERCE PERCENTAGE LIKE L. C. D. SCREEN 
BECAUSE YEAH AND IT SAYS THAT YOUNGER AGE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND FORTY FIVE HIGHLY INTERESTING FEATURES MORE CRITICAL 
AND OF THE ONLY IF 
YEAH BECAUSE OUR TARGET IS SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE 
YEAH YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS 
YEAH YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
NO I DON'T HAVE ANY COSTS HERE I ONLY HAVE PERCENTAGES 
YEAH 
YEAH IF YOU WANT TO ADJUST LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ADJUST THE AUDIO SETTINGS 
YOU PRESS AUDIO ON THE TOUCHSCREEN AND YOU GET THE BUTTONS FOR AUDIO SETTINGS SO THE OTHER BUTTONS ARE AGAIN 
I THINK IT'S THE MOST EASIER THING YEAH 
NO 
YEAH 
HIGHLY 
YEAH BUT 
UM SO FORTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE THIRTY THREE PERCENT AND SIXTY FIFTY SIX TO SIXTY FIVE TWELVE PERCENT 
BUT OR OR OR WHAT'S IT PROJECT REQUIREMENTS OR THE NEW PRODUCTS SHOULD BE REACHED FOR NEW MARKETS TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN FORTY 
NO THAT NOT NOW BUT SO 
YEAH BUT MARKET SHARE FRO FOR FOR FORTY YEARS AND YOUNGER IS HIGHER THAN THAT OF SIXTY FIVE AND YOUNGER 
YEAH I I IF IT YEAH IF IT COSTS GETS TOO MUCH TOO EXPENSIVE THAN YEAH WE SHOULD BE STICKING TO RUBBER BUTTONS 
NO NOTHING NO COSTS AT ALL 
YEAH NO 
I THINK THAT SHOULD YEAH I THINK WE ALL GET THE COSTS OF EVERYTHING 
YEAH OKAY I'LL I'LL POST IT 
YEAH 
OKAY L. C. D. YEAH 
THEN YOU HAVE THE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS FIND IT R UGLY 
YEAH AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WITH A WHEN A REMOTE WOULD LOOK FANCY 
TH I LI I IT'LL LOOK FANCY WITH L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH JUST A THE PLAIN REMOTES NOT NOT SPECIFIC L. C. D. REMOTES 
SO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OF COURSE 
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE OTHER THING THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT ZAP A LOT BUT THAT'S NOT A F QUESTION WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS WIPE THE SCREEN OFF ONCE EACH TIME TO GET ALL THE FINGERPRINTS OFF IT 
UM 
MM-HMM 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN A F NO NO NO NO UH REMOTE CONTROL OR CHANNEL SELECTION VOLUME CON SELECTION 
AND POWER S POWER USAGE 
AND A TELETEXT BUT THAT IS NOT OF THE QUESTION 
THREE THINGS ARE 
SORRY 
YEAH IT COULD BE 
YEAH 
YEAH TELETEXT 
AND OTHER OTHER LESS IMPORTANT THINGS ARE SCREEN SETTINGS AUDIO SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS BUT 
LESS IMPORTANT 
YEAH SHOULD BE THERE BUT NOT PRESS YEAH SUB MENU YEAH 
YEAH IN A BREATH IT'S 
CHARTED 
YEAH BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANY COSTS NOW IS YEAH 
YEAH E E POWER SUPPLY AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT THAT EASY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT WHO WHO UH THAT YOU HAVE TO TURN IT IN FIRST AND THEN USE IT 
SO I THINK IT'S BETTER WHEN THE THE T. V. SHUTS DOWN THE REMOTE SHUTS DOWN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AFTER TWO MINUTES YEAH TWO THREE MINUTES YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THEN BE THAT UH BEFORE AN HOUR WHEN ITS GET AGAIN GETS EMPTY 
THEN YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO RECHARGE OUT OF PUT IT IN A RECHARGER 
CHARGER 
YEAH IF IT'S 
OH 
YEAH BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. YOU'RE ZAPPING AND YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN A RECHARGER AND I DON'T THINK IT 
YEAH OKAY BUT THEN WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE THE THE THE BATTERIES GO HOURS SIX HOURS FIVE SIX HOURS THEN 
YEAH THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM 
ARE WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE BATTERIES LAST COUPLE OF DAYS WHEN THEY'RE RECHARGED 
SO 
YEAH BECAUSE YOU HAVE B BUT YOU HAVE L. C. D. SCREEN 
HIGH POWER USAGE 
YES 
TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TRUE 
YEAH YOU MADE A POINT THREE 
YEAH OTHERWISE ALL YOUR YEAH 
JUST A SMALL DEVICE 
PLUG IT NO THAT'S IT 
YEAH LIKE A LIKE TELEPHONE CHARGER OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT HAS TO BE EASY TO USE ALSO OR THINGS 
UH MARKET SHARE SPEAKER RE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
I THINK 
ALSO 
WELL I THINK THAT THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD 
LARGE BUTTON LARGE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH IT SAYS ALSO YEAH 
TWELVE 
THAT'S ONE ALSO NINETY ONE PERCENT SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE 
TWENTY SIX TO THIRTY FIVE YEARS SEVENTY SIX PERCENT AND THIRTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE PERCENT 
BUT THEN I I I 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NINETY 
TWENTY FIVE 
CHANNEL 
YEAH 
YEAH TWELVE 
YEAH 
SO THIS ONLY WOULD YOU WOULD YOU PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S THE ONLY THING IT SAYS 
I THINK AN L. C. D. SCREEN SHOULD BE SUF SUFFICIENT 
YEAH IT SAYS A LOT BUT 
NO I THINK I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE L. L. C. D. SCREEN BECAUSE IN THE AREA OF TWO THIRTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE 
WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET SHARE IN IN OUR HANDS AND FIFTY FIVE OF THESE PEOPLE WANT L. C. D. SCREEN AND THIRTY FIVE WANT SPEECH RECOGNITION 
SO I THINK IT'S BETTER TO KEEP IT WITH L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH OF THE COSTS AL ALLOW IT 
NO 
IF IT SHOULD BE DONE IF IT COULD BE DONE I WON'T MATTER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
TRUE 
YEAH 
TRUE 
BUT THAT SHOULD ALSO BE WITH F SHOULD BE ALSO WITH L. C. D. SCREEN 
BECAUSE THEN I THINK IN CHINESE IS DIFFERENT WRITTEN VOLUME IS DIFFERENT WRITTEN THEN UM SWAHILI OR SOMETHING 
JA WELL POSSIBLE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
'KAY WHAT ELSE 
YEAH WE HAVE TO KEEP YEAH 
I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT 
EVERY LANGUAGE OF DIALECTS 
I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFEREN DIFFICULT 
YEAH 
I THINK IT CAN'T BE IMPLEMENTED BUT MAYBE 
YEAH 'S AN OPTION YES 
FIFTY EURO CENTS 
YEAH 
MM YES 
NO BUT 
CURVED 
UM 
I THINK WE SHOULD WE COULD THAT WE COULD ALSO IMPLEMENT A AUDIO SETTINGS SCREEN SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS BUT S SUB MENUS 
D MAINLY IF YOU TURN THE UH REMOTE CONTROL IN YOU HAVE TO U YOU HAVE TO SEE FROM ONE TILL ZERO CHANNEL AND VOLUME 
AND IF YOU WANT TO USE TELETEXT SCREEN OR DO THEN YOU CAN PRESS IT 
IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE BUT NOT 
NOT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT SO 
YEAH 
THEY'D HAVE TO BE EASY TO USE 
THE SIGN OF IT 
OH NO 
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO WITH A TELEVISION 
UH PLAY PAUSE DOESN'T N NEED TO BE THERE 
YES SO THIS IS YOUR PRESENTATION 
WE COULD CHECK THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS WITH TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
WHICH ONES WERE YOURS 
TECHNI 
JA JA JA JA JA 
TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
YEAH OKAY 
UH I THINK I GO TO HAVE VOLUME MUTE BUT I YEAH 
VERY SLOW 
YEAH THE ZOOM BUTTONS 
YEAH B WIDE SCREEN HIGH SCREEN DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE YEAH DIFFERENT UH YEAH 
YEAH IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE BUT THEN IN SEPARATE SCREEN SETTINGS OR SOMETHING 
YEAH SCREEN SETTINGS AUDIO SETTINGS TELETEXT SETTINGS YOU HAVE 
CHANNEL SETTINGS 
SO THIS FOR END OF COURSE THE MENU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LIKE TAP SCREENS OR SOMETHING OR I DUNNO 
SOMETHING 
YEAH OF UH 
NO YOU DON'T YOU A ONE YOU THEN YOU DON'T NO NO DON'T THEN YOU DON'T USE IT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
SO YOU LEAVE OUT LINE 
YEAH 
OR IT COULD BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE A A STANDARD VERSION OF THE REMOTE AN EXPANDED VERSION 
YEAH 
COLOURS 
YEAH 
YEAH THEN DEFINES ITSELF 
BECAUSE UH HOW MANY PERCENT 
EIGHTY PERCENT 
WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY IF IT LOOKS FANCY 
YEAH 
RASTA COLOURS 
YEAH SO THROUGH VERSION 
YEAH 
IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON IT TURNS GREEN 
CHANNEL SETTINGS 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
COULD BE POSSIBLE 
OR LIKE UH YOU HAVE A MENU BUTTON YOU PRESS YEAH OR OTHERWISE YOU HAVE A MENU BUTTON 
PRESS MENU THEN YOU HAVE UH MENU UH MENU SEARCH UH ALL THE ALL THE SETTINGS 
YEAH NO PROBLEM 
YEP 
UM I THINK B BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS ON THE ON SCREEN 
I THINK THE BUTTONS YEAH BUT BUT ARE LIKE YOU HAVE YOU ONLY HAVE CHANNEL BUTTON OR VOLUME BUTTON 
THESE BUTTONS YOU CAN YOU CAN 
YEAH 
YEAH THE 
NO NO NORMAL BUTTONS YEAH 
MAYBE ONLY THE ONE AND O ONE AND OFF BUTTON 
BUT I DON'T THINK 
MM NO 
NO NO NO BECAUSE WE WE DISCUSSED THAT YOU COULD CHARGE IT OTHERWISE IS IT IT JUMPS TO STAND BY MODE AUTOMATICALLY 
YEAH BUT A T. V. OF COURSE 
TH THAT'S THE I THINK THAT'S A BEST THING IS THAT TO IMPLEMENT THAT IN IN THE MENU WITH THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL 
NO 
YEAH YOU TAP 
TOUCH SCREEN YEAH THEN IT'S TURN TURN OFF TURN ON 
NO JUST THE REMOTE 
A TELEVISION DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THAT ONE YOU CAN PRESS ONE YEAH STAND BY 
THEN PRESS ONE REMOTE PRESS ON AND THEN T. V. SHOULD BE AVAILABLE 
OR NOT 
SEPARATE 
YEAH BUT I THINK THE OR THE REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU PRESS TAP THE SCREEN 
IT ALWAYS SHOULD JUMP TO THE SCREEN WHICH HAS THE VOLUME BUTTON CHANNEL BUTTON AND OF COURSE OF ALSO THE ONE AND OFF BUTTON 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IF WE CAN AFFORD IT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM 
ALRIGHT 
HMM 
IT'S A COLOUR 
NO 
YOU CAN PUT THE R. AND R. 
ALRIGHT 
I WILL GO NEXT 
ALRIGHT SO I THOUGHT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE INTERFACE 
UH HOW IT SHOULD LOOK 
AND UH UH WE UH DETERMINED THAT WILL NOT BE IN BUTTONS BUT ONLY AN L. C. D. SCREEN SO I HAD TO UH LIKE IN THAT 
AND THE DESIGN IS THEREFORE BASED ON WHAT WE JUST UH UH THOUGHT OF 
UH FIRST THERE ARE SOME NEW FINDINGS AND NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
AND THIS IS THAT UH UM UH UH Y YOU ASK YOU GIVE A QUESTION THROUGH THROUGH THE DEVICE AND IT ANSWERS YOU 
AND THEY ALREADY UH PUT THIS ONE IN IN A COFFEE MAKER 
AND SO THAT IT YOU SAY OH GOOD MORNING UH COFFEE MAKER AND IT SAYS IT SAYS IT YOU BACK GOOD MORNING JOE OR WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
THIS UH AND THERE'S AN EASY WAY TO UH PROGRAM THAT UH YOU SAY RECORD INTO THE DEVICE INTO THE SPEAKER AND THEN YOU SAY THE QUESTION AND THREE SECONDS LATER YOU SAY THE ANSWER AND THEN WHEN YOU SAY THE QUESTION IT GIVES YOU THE ANSWER 
UM PERHAPS IT'S USEFUL PERHAPS FOR BECAUSE PEOPLE UM ALSO THE REMOTE THEY CAN YELL UH REMOTE WHERE ARE YOU NEED CALLS OR SOMETHING 
AND PERHAPS WE COULD UH IMPLEMENT THAT 
AND THEN I HAVE TO GO OUT OF THE PRESENTATION BECAUSE I TRIED TO MAKE SOME KIND OF A A IDEA OF HOW IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I CAN'T DRAW 
SO UH DON'T MAKE TOO MUCH OF IT 
I TRIED TO UH THE L. C. D. SCREEN I TRIED TO SORT OF TO DRAW 
I THOUGHT UH AT LEAST UH THE ICON FOR THE VOLUME 
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS AN ICON FOR THE PROGRAM BUT YEAH 
SO UH AND THEN THE BUTTONS ABOVE AND UH BELOW THE AND THE AND THE MUTE BUTTON ALSO RECOGNISABLE AS AN ICON 
UM 
I FORGOT THAT ONE 
I THOUGHT I FORGOT SOMETHING ABOUT UH 
AND UH AND UH THE NUMBERS THAT SHOULD BE A BIT LARGER I THINK IT'S NOT REALLY ON SCALE AND AND SO FORTH 
UM AN OPTIONS BUTTON 
AND I THOUGHT THE THE BUTTON FOR TELETEXT APAR UH PART BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY OPTIONS I THINK 
IT'S UH OPTIONS IS THE SETTINGS OF THE REMOTE AND OF THE T. V. AND THAT KIND OF UH THING 
SO COULD CALL IT SETTINGS OR SOMETHING 
BUT THIS IS A BIT UH HOW I THOUGHT IT 
AND UH THE L. C. D. UH SOMEWHERE IN THE REMOTE 
PERHAPS WE COULD BE MORE CURVY THE REMOTE PERHAPS SHOULD 
SO THAT IT'S BETTER IN YOUR HAND OR SOMETHING UH 
BUT UH AND AND UH A MICROPH MICROPHONE FOR THE SPEECH UH RECOGNITION IF WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT THAT 
UH AND THEN UH IF YOU PRESS THE OP OPTIONS BUTTON NOW WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF 
AND THEN YOU SHOULD GET THE OTHER OPTIONS WITH WHAT WHAT YOU COULD DO AND THAT YOU COULD DO WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS THIS 
AND UH IT'S ALSO UH I THOUGHT THINK WE DISCUSSED UH EARLIER THAT UH OLDER PEOPLE DON'T REALLY WANT TO USE UH THESE EXTRA SETTINGS 
AND OLDER PEOPLE A ALSO DON'T REALLY WANT TO USE THIS UH TH THIS KIND OF OPTION MENUS 
SO THEY WANT TO U USE ONE BUTTON AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS 
AND NOT CHOOSE WITH UH THIS KIND OF UH AND YOU COULD PUT IN A IN A REALLY IS LITTLE SCROLLING DEVICE IN THE SIDE OF YOUR UH REMOTE 
SO YOU COULD SCROLL SCROLL UH ACROSS THESE UH THINGS 
THAT'S AN OPTION 
AND THAT WAS MY UH FINDING DINGE 
YEAH 
GRASS GREEN 
LET'S BUILD IT INTO A SPONGE 
IT WAS ONE REMOTE I THINK DIFFERENT COLOURS 
YOU COULD YOU COULD UH CHANGE THE COLOURS THAT WAS ALSO THE IDEA 
I DON'T KNOW WHICH SHAPE YOU SHOULD SHOULD TAKE BUT 
YEAH 
PERHAPS YOU COULD FIND SOMETHING ON THE MIDDLE 
ROUND BUT SQUARE 
YEAH 
UH I I IF YOU DO IT UH UH SQUARE 
WITH ROUND CORNERS BUT A LITTLE UH IN THE MIDDLE OF IT UH I DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
WAIT LIKE LIKE THIS UH A BIT 
SO IT'S A BIT SQUARE BUT IT'S ALSO A BIT UH 
ROUND 
SO BUT THEN 
SAME SIDES 
BUT THAT'S UH 
YEAH BUT THAT'S ALSO HOW OTHER REMOTES ARE SHAPED SO THAT'S UH BUT PERHAPS THAT'S A GOOD THING SO THAT'S EASY TO USE 
PEOPLE KNOW THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SWORDS 
YEAH 
BUT THAT'S EASILY TO DO WITH THE COLOUR I THINK 
THAT'S EASY TO DO WITH THE COLOURS I THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THINK UH ALSO IN BETWEEN 
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOULD IT BUT 
YEAH 
BUT LIKE THIS KIND OF RUBBER 
THIS UH 
BUT IT'S QUITE HARD THIS 
YEAH 
I DON'T THINK IT'S RUBBER 
UH DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT UH 
SO WE SHOULD FIRST DECIDE ABOUT SHAPE I THINK 
WHICH UH THEN YOU CAN FIT THE L. C. D. SCREEN ON IT AND CAN DECIDE UH 
YEAH IT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT IS ABOUT IS BUT YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
BUT IF YOU UP NOW YOU CAN PUT YOUR HAND THERE AND THEN YOU WON'T TOUCH THE SCREEN 
PERHAPS THAT'S BEST 
BUT NOT IN THE SCREEN BECAUSE YEAH THAT'S UH THAT'S AN IDEA 
LOOKS A BIT LIKE A GAME BOY NOW 
YOU ALWAYS TOUCH IT YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU YOU COULD INCLUDE A PEN 
YEAH O YEAH IF THEY THINK IT'S HANDY TO USE A PEN 
YEAH I THINK THIS UH THIS IS A GOOD SIZE FOR THE SCREEN 
I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW LARGE THE ACTUAL REMOTE SHOULD BE ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
I THINK ENERGY WERE BATTERIES AND THEN UH AND UH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
JUST LIKE WITH THE TELEPHONE 
BUT IT SHOULD BE THE I THINK NORMAL BATTERIES NOT NOT LIKE TWO OR TWO UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM WHAT WAS WITH THE CHIP ON PRINT 
YEAH 
IT'S RUBBER 
YEAH BUT BUT A HARD RUBBER LIKE THIS 
OR SOFTER RUBBER OR YEAH 
IT BOUNCES BACK FROM THE FLOOR WHERE YOU THROW IT 
YEAH YEAH THIS IN DIFFERENT COLOURS 
YEAH IT'S A BIT 
BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE A BIT LONGER PERHAPS 
YEAH 
I THINK SO IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH ALRIGHT 
AND THEN 
YEAH YOU CAN UH IT'S PRETTY EASY BUT 
AND 
YEAH I HAD WHAT I JUST UH I SHOULD AGAIN 
I MISS A FEW BUTTONS BUT 
WELL 
AT LEAST UH WHAT WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE NO I JUST REMEMBERED UM A MENU TO GO BACK THROUGH THE FIRST UH 
IF IF YOU TOUCH OPTIONS YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO THIS UH RIGHT AWAY NOW 
THIS 
I DON'T KNOW 
I THINK IT'S 
I DON'T KNOW 
I I THOUGHT IT WAS UH USER TO HANDLE THIS WAY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY THINK 
WOULD YOU LIKE THE THE BUTTONS HORIZONTAL OR V VERTICAL 
RIGHT WELL IF WE MAKE IT LIKE THIS I THINK IF YOU 
PUT IT LIKE THIS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK I W 
I THINK THAT'S A MATTER OF WHAT YOU'RE USED IT 
I THINK I WOULD PUT A PLUS AND A MENU UH HERE 
AND THEN THE P. ON THE MID IN THE MIDDLE AND THE SOUND UH IN THE MIDDLE 
ALMOST 
YEAH BUT I THINK WHEN YOU ARE HOLDING IT YOU COULD PRESS THE MENUS AND THE PLUS AND WITH THE OTHER FINGER THE MENUS AND THE PLUS 
YEAH BUT I THINK YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
PERHAPS I HAVE SOME EXAMPLES 
I DON'T KNOW 
THAT'S ME 
BUT I'M GOING TO LOOK IF I'VE GOT SOME EXAMPLES 'CAUSE PERHAPS YOU SHOULD CHOOSE WHAT'S MOST OFTEN USED 
THE 'CAUSE THEY CAN SEE THAT BETTER 
YEAH 
I 
HERE SO ARE HERE OR UH 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT BUT I MEAN IF IT'S USUALLY PLUS OR MIN ABOVE EACH OTHER OUR NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN A NORMAL REMOTE 
W WHAT'S WHAT'S USUAL OR NORMAL 
YES I'M LOOKING HERE 
BUT HERE'S IT'S BELOW HERE ALSO AND NOW HERE'S HERE'S NEXT TO EACH OTHER 
I THINK IT'S IT'S A 
YEAH 
I THINK THE THE THE VOLUME WAS USUALLY UH ABOVE EACH OTHER BECAUSE YOU GO HIGHER AND DOWN 
AND THE THE PAY THE THE THE PROGRAM IS NEXT TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE YOU WOULD GO FURTHER AND BACK 
THAT'S HOW IT'S IS USUALLY WHEN I LIKE HERE 
THAT'S WHAT I SEE 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
THIS CONCEPT IS IN THE ACTUAL DESIGN BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHERE YOU WOULD PLACE A 
AND THE SPEECH UH SHALL WE IMPLEMENT THAT 
OR UH 
YEAH 
BUT THEN YOU SHOULD ALSO FIND A PLACE YOU COULD IF YOU DO IT LIKE THIS YOU COULD PUT IT IN A CORNER OR SOMETHING 
YOU CAN TALK INTO THE CORNER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT 
YEAH THAT'S ALSO 
SO ON THE MIDDLE OR SOMETHING 
BUT YOU SHOULD UH DECIDE WHERE YOU WANT TO PUT IT 
RIGHT 
YOU COULD P YOU COULD PUT IT IN A LOGO OF THE COMPANY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WHERE DO YOU WANT TO PUT IT 
YEAH ACTUALLY IT DOES BECAUSE IT YOU CAN YOU CAN FIND IT BETTER IF YOU USE IT 
IT'S A WAY FOR YOU TO UH 
SO IT MAKES MORE SENSE JUST 'CAUSE THEIR REMOTES DON'T HAVE THAT 
BUT A MICROPHONE THERE IS ONE BUTTON 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
ANY MORE UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM YEAH 
YEAH THE THE YOUNG PEOPLE DO LIKE UH SCROLL UH YEAH 
OR AT LEAST YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S REALLY THE SCROLL BUT THE MENU THEY LIKE MOST 
AND I THINK YOU CAN NEVER GET THROUGH A MENU GREAT WITH A SCROLL UH 
BUT YOU HAVE IT'S F UH WE HAVE FIVE OR FOUR OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S ALSO DIFFERENT 
YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD HAVE A BLACK ONE BECAUSE UH I THINK BLACK IS STANDARD 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT THAN UH 
SILVER 
SILVER RUBBER 
BUT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
JUST ALL KIND OF COLOUR 
YEAH 
AND AND DO WE HAVE TO HAVE A NORMAL BLACK ONE OR UH 
SO IT 
YEAH 
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT 
OH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
BUT DO WE HAVE TO WE'LL WORK TOGETHER BUT DO WE HAVE TO STAY HERE OR DO WE 
RIGHT 
YES 
OKAY 
YEAH I THINK 
NO 
YEAH 
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP TALKING ENGLISH NOW 
OKAY WELCOME EVERYONE TO OUR NEXT MEETING 
I'M BUSY WRITING AND BUSY LEADING THE MEETING 
BUT UM I'VE PREPARED A LITTLE PRESENTATION ONCE AGAIN UM OR AT LEAST AN AGENDA I THINK UH THE BIGGEST PART OF THE PRESENTATION WILL BE UH IN YOUR SIDE 
UM WE ARE HERE AT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING WHICH IS HEREBY OPENED 
UM ONCE AGAIN I WILL TRY TO UH WRITE SOME MINUTES WHICH I JUST FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING UH PLACED INSIDE OUR PROJECT FOLDER 
WHICH WAS QUITE SOME TYPING 
UM TODAY WE ONCE AGAIN HAVE UH THREE PRESENTATIONS IF I'M RIGHT AND AFTER THAT WE WILL TAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS 
AND JUST USE THE LAST TIME WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES TO ACCOMPLISH THAT 
OKAY WELL 
I'D SAY LET'S START WITH THE FIRST PRESENTATION 
UM IN THE SAME ORDER AS LAST TIME 
OKAY 
WILL TAKE IT AWAY 
MM-HMM 
WELL BUSINESS COLOURS I THOUGHT IT WAS THE THE SLOGAN AND UH THE CORPORATE IMAGE SO YEAH IT NEEDS COLOUR 
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE ENTIRE THING IN THE CORPORATE COLOUR 
IT MUST BE RECOGNISABLE 
OKAY THANK YOU 
MM 
MM-HMM 
THANKS 
NOW OUR THIRD 
TEAM MEMBER WITH HIS PRESENTATION 
UH YOU 
SO FOR THE OLDER PEOPLE A MORE TRADITIONAL UH FROM 
YEAH I GUESS CHANGING COLOURS WILL BE EASIER THAN CHANGING UH 
THE SHAPE OF IT 
BUT MAYBE THEN BOTH GROUPS WON'T BUY IT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WE THINK SO IT 
HMM 
SO WE NEED A SPONGY FEELING 
YEAH 
AND WE WON'T INCLUDE A A PEN OR SOMETHING TO POINT HEY WE WE WANT TO DO IT WITH OUR FINGERS RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO USE A REMOTE WITH WITH THEIR FINGERS BECAUSE THE THEY'RE USED TO THAT AND 
AND MAYBE WE HAVE TO ADD A TISSUE TO REMOVE THE GREASE FROM ALL THE FINGERS HUH 
OKAY WELL MAYBE IF I CAN INTERRUPT YOU MAYBE I SHOULD UH SHOULD SHOW SOME POINTS IN WHICH WE UH SHOULD TAKE A DECISION 
SO WE CAN DISCUSS THESE POINTS 
THESE POINTS UM 
ENERGY QUESTION MARK 
HOW HOW SHOULD WE UH SUPPLY THE THING WITH ENERGY AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT WITH SEPARATE DOCKING STATION AND THEN PUT ON IT 
UH CHIP ON PRINT AND CASE 
THESE ARE POINTS MY UH COACH ADVISED ME TO DISCUSS HERE BUT I HOPE YOU HAVE IDEAS ABOUT THEM 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S THE THE THE FIRST POINT 
WE ALREADY DECIDED THAT IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
MM-HMM 
SIMPLE RECHARGEABLE UH BATTERIES 
YEAH BUT HOW DID THIS HOW DOES THAT WITH A L. C. D. SCREEN 
YOU STILL HAVE A 
PRINT PLATE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH WELL IT'S A GOOD QUESTION 
IT JUST WAS IN THERE AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT IT BUT 
MM-HMM 
WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF C. P. U. I GUESS 
MM-HMM 
BECAUSE WE'RE PROJECTING PROJECTING THE BUTTONS ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH YOU HAVE A FANCY DESIGN THEN RIGHT AWAY 
SO 
OKAY SO 
YEAH BUT I WROTE IT DOWN 
WHAT ABOUT THE USER INTERFACE THERE ARE ALSO SOME SOME QUESTIONS UH ABOUT THE CONCEPTS I THINK YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS ON THAT 
YOU YOU SHOWED YOUR DRAWING 
MM 
EVERYBODY'S SEARCHING ON HIS DATA 
YEAH WELL I THINK WE HAVE WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT NOW HOW WHERE WE WILL PUT THE BUTTONS JUST THE 
CONCEPTS 
YEAH WELL WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE NEW UH TECHNOLOGY HUH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH MAYBE AT THE BOTTOM WHERE YOU CAN CAN HEL HOLD IT WITH YOU HAND THAT THERE'S ALSO A MICROPHONE UH 
OVER THERE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL MAYBE JUST IN THE THE SPOT YOU JUST POINTED OUT 
BECAUSE I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN A AN AN IMPORTANT POSITION WHERE PEOPLE CAN USE IT 
BECAUSE IT IS THE THE UNIQUE UH IDEA OF OUR REMOTE HUH THE THE SPEECH CONTROL 
WELL MAYBE WHERE THE ONE HAND 
BUT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE BUTTON OR ABOUT THE MICROPHONE 
YEAH BECAUSE A MICROPHONE IS VERY SMALL THING BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S BIG SO SO ITS ITS REALLY AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE 
AS WELL UH TYPE SUPPLEMENTS 
ANYTHING 
YEAH WELL WE ALREADY S DISCUSSED THAT HUH THE THE L. C. D. AND 
MM-HMM 
AND I THINK I WOULD IT WOULD MAKE EVEN MORE FANCY BECAUSE YOU HAVE ANOTHER INTERESTING THING IN THE SIDE WHICH YOU CAN TOUCH AND 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL THERE'S OR FIVE MINUTES UH WARNING 
UM ANY MORE UH QUESTIONS ABOUT ABOUT THE DESIGN OR THE USER INTERFACE ARE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS EVERYONE 
EVERYBODY THINK THEY CAN CAN 
WORK FOR THAT 
SO THERE A STANDARD COLOUR 
YEAH 
BUT STILL SILVER AND BLACK OR WELL SILVER SO NOW BUT ALSO TRADITIONAL S UH 
YEAH W WHAT ABOUT A YELLOW THING I MEAN IT 
COULD BE UGLY BUT IT'S DEFINITELY FANCY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I WOULD THINK ABOUT COLOURS LIKE UH RED YELLOW GREEN BLUE JUST 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MAROON 
YEAH 
OKAY SO 
WHO'S PINGING 
YOU ARE PINGIN OKAY 
I THOUGHT WE OKAY SO UH THAT WRAPS IT UP 
EVERYBODY KNOWS UH WHAT TO DO 
WELL I WROTE IT DOWN HERE 
I WROTE IT DOWN HERE WHAT TO DO UM 
THE NEXT MEETING SO ONCE AGAIN IN THIRTY MINUTES 
UM HERE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS 
AND ESPECIALLY NOTICE THAT UH THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON A PROTOTYPE DRAWING ON A SMART BOARD 
AND OF COURSE IT ALL FOUR OF USE UH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE EMAILED BY OUR PERSONAL COACH 
WELL I I'D SAY JUST WAIT UH FOR EMAIL AND UH FIND OUT 
I DON'T KNOW 
OKAY WELL THAT WAS WHAT I HAD TO SAY UH 
FINAL THOUGHTS FROM ANYONE OR 
WE'RE FINISHED 
OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE SURE 
OKAY UH WELCOME YOU ALL 
COMPONENTS DESIGN 
UM UH FIRST OF ALL UH I WOULD LOOK AT UH UH ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THIS UH THINGS I UH UH ELABORATE SOME OF THE THINGS I DID 
I I ELABORATED ON THE CONCEPT 
WHAT SHOULD BE UM 
HE SAID ABOUT UH THE COMPONENTS UH ITS PROPERTIES AND WHAT KIND OF MATERIALS SHOULD WE USE IT UH TO MAKE UH ONE OF THESE ARE REMOTE CONTROLS 
UH WELL FIRST OF ALL I'VE UH D SUBTRACTED SOME OF THE COMPONENTS THAT IS THAT ARE USED UH ARE WE WE UM YOU KNOW FROM WHAT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL'S FORMED 
UH FIRST OF ALL THE CASE THE CASE THE SURROUNDING OF THE OF THE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
I WOULD LOOK AT UH GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF UH HOW I THOUGHT ABOUT 
GIRAFFE'S GONE NOW 
OKAY UM THE CASE WAS IS MADE FROM RUBBER I SUPPOSE 
THERE'S ONE OF THE BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE A REMOTE CONTROL A LOT OF PEOPLE UH WELL UH WELL UH DROP THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AND THEY BREAK UH BECAU THE UH TITANIUM WAS ALSO AN OPTION 
BUT UH IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE MATERIAL 
UH RUBBER SO I THINK UH THE BEST SUITABLE UH MATERIAL UH IT IS UH FOR OUR UH 
FOR OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
UM IT'S POSS IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO UH CREATE FANCY COLOURS WITH RUBBER 
UH RUBBER L MAKES IT EASY TO UH IT IT IT LETS LETS ITSELF COLOUR 
UH TITANIUM UH YOU HAVE TO POINT OUT AND WITH THAT UH IT'S POSSIBLE TO SCRATCH IT OR UH YEAH MAKE IT UGLY 
UH RUBBER UH THE TOTAL UH PIECE OF RUBBER THAT'S SOR UH THAT'S THAT'S USED UH TO MAKE THE CASE IS UH THE SAME COLOUR 
SO IF YOU SCRATCH IT IT'S STILL THE SAME COLOUR PERHAPS UH IT'S A LITTLE BIT DAMAGED 
BUT IT'S A VERY STRONG MATERIAL 
UM I UH I HAD AN IDEA SINGLE COVERED UH CURVED SORRY SINGLE CURVED 
UH SO IT'S T TWO DIMENSIONAL 
I THINK IT'S UH IT'S BEST TO DRAW UH GREEN 
NOW 
BLANK 
OKAY 
LET'S MAKE IT UH BLACK 
OKAY 
I THOUGHT OF AN IDEA LIKE THIS 
UH THAT 
UM DELETE 
BLANK 
OKAY 
SO IT ALSO LOOKS NICE WHEN IT'S IN YOUR TABLE 
SO YOU GET UH IT DOESN'T LAY FLAT DOWN ON THE TABLE BUT IT'S C IT'S STANDS 
SIDE VIEW YES IT'S SIDE VIEW IS UH I I'M NOT TECHNICALLY GOOD AT THE THREE D. MODELLING BUT 
UM UH IT'S JUST AN IDEA I HAD SO IT'S UH IT'S VERY UH SO ITS ALSO LOOKS NICE WHEN IT'S IN THE TABLE 
UM THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE AND THE BUTTONS UH WE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ALREADY 
UH I THOUGHT ABOUT UH THE L. C. D. TOUCH SCREEN WHICH IS UH IS EASY TO CLEAN TOO 
ONE OF THE GREAT UH ADVANTAGES OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN YOU JUST USE SOME OR UH ANOTHER UH CLEANING UH UH CL SOME CLEANING STUFF 
AND UM IT SHOULD BE MADE OF STRONG PLASTIC AND IT SHOULD BE BRIGHT 
WELL I ALREADY UH SO UH EXPLAINED SOME PROPERTIES OF THAT MATERIAL AND I THINK UH WELL WE ALSO WE ALMOST CONCLUDED ABOUT THAT UH THIS SHOULD UH B UH OUR UH BUTTON COMPONENT 
SO UH 
OH THAT'S ALL ABOUT UH THE BUTTONS 
UH THE BATTERIES UH WE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ALREADY 
UH WILL BE CHARGEABLE WITH UH UH AN OPTION FOR A MOUNT STATION SO YOU CAN UH PUT THE UH THE REMOTE CONTROL IN A MOUNT STATION IS ITS CHARGES ITSELF UP INSTEAD OF UH PLUGGING IT IN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
QUESTIONS 
OKAY 
AND THEY SHOULD BE LONG LASTING NOT UH NOT BE EMPTY UH NO BUT UH TWO MINUTES OR UH THIRTY MINUTES OR FORTY MINUTES OF US 
AND NEXT STEP IS THE CHIP UH THE THE COMPONENT THAT'S UH MAKES OR TRANSMITS THE SIGNAL TO THE TELEVISION 
OH THERE WAS AN OPTION TO USE AS A RATHER SIMPLE CHIP BUT I THINK UH BECAUSE UH OF OUR UH HIGHLY UH REQUIRING UH REQUIREMENTS 
THERE SHOULD BE AN ADVANCED CHIP ON IT WITH UH ALSO THE ABILITY TO UH FACILITATE SPEAKER SPEECH RECOGNITION UH WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS STILL IN A TEST PHASE 
SO UH THERE SHOULD BE SOME MORE UH INVESTIGATION ON THAT SIDE 
OH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES UH I ALSO OVERHEARD IN THE LAST MEETING THAT THERE SHOU WE SHOULD USE UH OUR OWN BUSINESS COLOURS 
THAT WAS CORRECT WASN'T IT 
OKAY 
I THINK THEY ARE RATHER BORING FOR ME FOR US WITH RUBBER 
OKAY THEY SHOULD BE UM SH THEY SHOULD BE IN MIND WASN'T IT 
OKAY SO TO DO IT DOESN'T SAYS UH TO UH HAVE THE SLOGAN 
OKAY OKAY 
WELL THAT'S POSSIBLE OF COURSE 
WE COULD MAKE A LITTLE R. AND R. ON THE TOP OF THE MACHINE 
UH SO THEY ARE PRETTY BORING I SUGGEST BECAUSE JUST THE AVAILABILITY WITH RUBBER TO MAKE FANTASTIC COLOURS UH AND ALSO IN A LOT OF POSSIBLE COLOURS 
SO IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE VERY UH FANCY UH REMOTE CONTROLS WHICH PEOPLE UH WHA PEOPLE 
IN WHICH PEOPLE WILL FIND THEY'RE UH INTERESTING 
AND UH WELL BY UH THEM FASTER WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE SAME OLD GREY OR BLACK UH COLOURS 
UH SO SO I SAID UH BEFORE RUBBER IS UH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DAMAGE SEVERELY IMP INSTEAD OF UH OF COURSE YOU CAN BREAK IT WHEN YOU YOU WHEN YOU BREAK IT IN AS FOR EXAMPLE WITH A PAIR OF SCISSORS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT I IF YOU DROP IT IT'S NOT UH BROKEN UH RIGHT WAY SO INSTEAD OF USING UH PLASTIC HARD PLASTIC OR UH TITANIUM 
AND I PERSONALLY LIKED UH THE SINGLE CURVED UH REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT YEAH IT MAKES SENSE 
OKAY 
WELL THAT'S ALL ABOUT MY UH MY FINDINGS 
MM 
MM 
MM 
OH MY GOD 
NOT JUST A P. 
OH OKAY 
OH 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
OH OKAY YEAH 
OH YEAH 
MM 
OKAY 
GO DANNY GO DANNY 
FORTY 
FORTY 
MM 
OKAY 
MM 
OKAY 
CHANGING JUST THE SHAPE OF THE UH REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH SO ROUND CORNERS BUT SO BUT SQUARE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN KIND OF LIKE A 
YEAH 
KINDA LIKE A BEER GLASS 
YEAH 
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
IT'S ALSO EASY TO TO HAVE TO TO PUT IN YOUR HAND 
YEAH 
WELL RECOGNISE THAT'S AS A REMOTE CONTROL 
UH WHEN I SAW YOUR D UH 
HUH 
YEAH KINDA LIKE OLD CARS UH 
LET'S PUT IT ALL TOGETHER 
OH 
YEAH 
SOFT RUBBER 
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU UM 
IT SHOULD SHOULDN'T BE 
OH 
SPONGY 
YEAH 
DING DING 
UM I ALSO SO UH CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT YOU UH USED IN YOU HAD A REMOTE CONTROL AND THE L. C. D. SCREEN WAS UH RATHER SMALL 
UM 
THIS WAS YOUR SIZE BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE LARGER 
YEAH THREE QUARTERS 
SO UH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT YOUR UH 
UH NEW BLANK 
SO UH WHEN YOU GET THIS UH 
UH KINDA LIKE THIS 
OR SHOULD TO BE LARGER 
LARGER 
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR HANDS YOU WANT 
YEAH 
YOUR THUMB HERE 
YEAH 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT YOUR F YEAH BUT IF YOU IF YOU MAKE THE THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS LARGE IS THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF 
UH YOU'LL YOU'LL ALWAYS GET SOME Y YEAH 
GOING TO BE VERY GREASY AND STUFF 
YEAH YOU DON'T WANT IT TOO SMALL 
HOW YEAH HOW LARGE 
YEAH THEY HAVE THICK FINGERS 
BUT IF YOU WANNA MAKE IT AN INTERNATIONAL JAPANESE UH PEOPLE GET UH RATHER SMALL HANDS 
AND WE GOT THESE LARGE 
ZOOM OPT AH YEAH OF COURSE YEAH 
YOU CAN MAKE IT LARGER TO TO UH TO UH WITH ACCOMPANYING UH GREATER FIELDS TO PUSH THE BUTTON 
YOUR FINGERS YEAH 
YOU DON'T WANT UH BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE THE PEN UH IF YOU LOSE THE PEN UH YOU CAN'T SEE 
YEAH YOU CAN DO WHATEVER UH ANY UH CLOTH 
SURE 
THE DOCKING STATION 
WE 
YEAH 
I KINDA LIKE YOUR 
YEAH YOU GOT SOME UH SOME OF THIS UH UH WIRELESS UH MIC 
MOUSE 
COMPUTER MOUSE 
KINDA LIKE THIS KIND OF BATTERIES 
YEAH 
THE CHIP ON PRINT 
UM 
UH YOU GOTTA F YEAH 
I THINK SO 
CHIP ON PRINT WITH A WITH A SIMPLE UH A SIM NOT A SIMPLE BUT A 
WE ALSO DISCUSSED THAT 
DIDN'T WE 
OH 
BEG YOUR PARDON 
YEAH SURE OF COURSE YEAH 
WELL UH CHIP ON PRINT I THINK WHAT THEY MEAN UH WITH THE REGULAR RUBBER BUTTONS THAT YOU GET 
UH IT'S ALWAYS COLOUR FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL WHEN YOU PRESS UH A CERTAIN BUTTON 
BUT WHEN YOU GOT A L. C. D. SCREEN WITH AN UH WITH INTO THE BUTTONS ARE NOT ALWAYS ON THE SAME PLACE 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ENLARGE A BUTTON OR IF YOU GOT SEVERAL OPTIONS UH APPEARING IN YOUR SCREEN UH THE CO ORDINATIONS AREN'T ALWAYS THE SAME 
WHEN YOU GOT A REGULAR BUTTON THE THE BUTTON OF STAND BY IS ALWAYS ON THE SAME PLACE AND YOU GET IN THE END ON THE 
YEAH 
I SUPPOSE SO 
IT IS A SIMPLE C. P. U. BUT IT DOESN'T 
YEAH BECAUSE IT HAS TO UH B 
YEAH BUT AT THE THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE IN A SETTINGS MENU OR JUST UH YOU JUST WANT TO TURN UP THE VOLUME 
SO IT HAS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A 
CALCULATION UNIT OR C. P. U. 
TO KNOW UH IN WHICH STATE YOU ARE AND UH WHICH BUTTON YOU ARE PRESSING ON TO THE RIGHT MOMENT 
YEAH 
AND A TOUCH SCREEN MAKES IT UH POSSIBLE TO UH TO GET THE CO ORDINATION OF YOUR FINGER IN THE SCREEN 
AND THE CASE YEAH WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THE CASE WE WANTED TO MAKE IT FROM RUBBER AND UH 
UH HARD RUBBER I THINK 
THAT'S THE EASY TO UH UH TO TO UH 
YEAH 
YEAH SURE LIKE 
IT'S OUR MAIN TARGET 
WELL AND HOW ABOUT MY IDEA UH OF MAKING IT UM 
WITH ONE SINGLE CURVE 
SO I 
BECAUSE IT'S A GADGET AND YOU WANT TO SHOW IT OFF OF COURSE 
OH 
BECAUSE IT YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S A LOT EASIER 
SO SO YOU GET UH DID YOU WRITE THAT DOWN 
UH GET A SINGLE CURVED UH RUBBER 
IF UH FANCY COLOURED REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
SORRY 
DEPENDS ON THE SCREEN 
IF YOU MAKE THE SCREEN VERTICAL IT DOESN'T MATTER 
IF YOU MAKE IT UH IN A RECTANGLE 
I SEE IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S 
SQUARE 
OH OKAY 
OH 
TAKE YOUR TIME 
WE 
WE'LL LEAVE THAT AT THE USABILITY ENGINEERING THEN 
YEAH 
CONSISTENCY 
YEAH 
IS NOT HOW MUCH IN INTO HOW OFTEN IT'S USED BUT 
OH 
YEAH IT DOES IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BUT 
OH 
OKAY UM 
LET'S CUT OUT THE CHOOSE 
OKAY WELL L 
YEAH 
INTERFACE YEAH 
TECHNOLOGIES UH 
YEAH 
MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO 
MM 
NOT EVEN NECESSARY BECAUSE A LOTTA YOU CAN MAKE A VERY SENSITIVE MICROPHONE 
SO IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO UH JUST PUT IT OR UH UNDERNEATH IT OR IN THE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE UH REMOTE 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORT I THINK THAT'S NOT UM VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YEAH IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THE MICROPHONE IS 
OH OKAY SURE OKAY WELL THE 
UNDERNEATH 
INDEED 
IT SHOULDN'T BE UH VERY UH VISIBLE 
YEAH SURE WHY NO 
YEAH BUT IT DOESN'T MAKES IT UH ANY MORE FANCY BECAUSE YOU GET IT IS UH 
OH 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL PUT IT THERE 
I DON'T MIND 
THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
OKAY 
SO 
INTERFACE TYPE 
THE L. C. D. YEAH UH SUPPLEMENTS WELL THE SUPPLEMENT IS IT YEAH 
HEY 
SO THE SCROLL 
YEAH I THINK SO IT 
SO WHY NOT IN ONE SIDE 
FAST YEAH 
SO IF YOU'VE GOT A SETTINGS IF YOU 
YES 
YOU HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU S YEAH YOU GET W WHEN YOU USE UH THE SETTINGS MENU FOR EXAMPLE TO LOOK UP SOME UH UH SOME CHANNELS IN YOUR UH IN YOUR TELEVISION 
YOU SHOULD SCROLL SCROLL DOWN UH IN A MENU WHICH PROBABLY DOES NOT FIT IN YOUR SCREEN 
SO THEN IT'S UH VERY HANDY TO TO SCROLL DOWN YOU MAKE JUST A RUBBER JUST LIKE UH IN YOUR MOUSE OR 
JUST PUT IT IN THE SIDE AND IT'S VERY EASY TO USE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY WHAT'S THE STANDARD COLOUR 
I I YOU GET YOU GET DIFFERENT COLOURS BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE A STANDARD COLOUR 
BLACK 
WITH THE WITH THE YELLOW UH 
JUST A REGULAR UH REMOTE COLOUR 
AND THEN HAVE UH DIFFERENT COVERS UH TO USE 
SILVER YEAH 
YOU USE A LOT OF IT UH SILVER TELEVISIONS 
YEAH Y I THINK IT'S BETTER TO 
YEAH TH YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT 
BUT IF YOU USE UH SILVER UH RUBBER IS SILVER RUBBER ISN'T FANCY 
WHEN YOU USE TITANIUM SILVER IS FANCY BUT WHEN YOU USE SILVER RUBBER IT ISN'T FANCY 
SILVER HAS TO SHINE AND RUBBER DOESN'T SHINE 
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S MADE OF SOFT RUBBER LIKE THIS 
YOU UNDERSTAND 
YEAH 
FORTY 
FRUITY LOOPS 
OKAY 
YOU PING 
WELL NOT WHAT TO DO 
NOT WHAT TO DO 
LIKE 
OKAY 
THEN I THINK WE SHOULD WORK 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
'KAY 
DON'T DESTROY MY GIRAFFE 
DROP IT 
BRIGHT COLOUR 
FANCY COLOUR 
FORWARD 
YOU HAVE TO GO TO 
UH IT'S A SIDE VIEW 
TRUE 
NO NO NO NO NO 
JUST LOOKING 
MM MM MM 
NEXT 
IT'S TRUE 
P. YEAH JUST A P. 
WHERE'S WHERE'S THE BUTTON FOR TWO 
OKAY 
DOESN'T MATTER 
NO 
OKAY 
OKAY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT A TREND WATCHING 
THE TRENDS FROM THE PAST YEARS WHAT THE PEOPLE LIKE WHAT THE YOUNGSTERS LIKE WHAT THE ELDERLY PEOPLE LIKED ABOUT SHAPES COLOURS 
MATERIAL AND STUFF 
'KAY 
THE METHOD I SAID WAS 
LIKE I TOLD I WATCHED THE TRENDS FROM THE PAST YEARS ABOUT COLOURS SHAPES MATERIAL THEY WANTED UH FROM ELDERLY AND YOUNG PEOPLE 
SO WE CAN KEEP THAT IN MIND FOR DESIGNING F UH THE DEVICE ITSELF 
FINDINGS I MADE 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING PEOPLE LIKED LAST YEAR WAS THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE LIKE LOOK FANCY 
THE SECOND IMPORTANT THING THAT WE SHOULD BE IF INV IN INNOV INNOVATIVE OKAY 
LIKE THE L. C. D. SCREEN THAT'S QUITE INNOVATIVE SO THAT SHOULD BE GREAT MEETING FOR THIS 
AND THE THIRD THING IS IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE 
I THINK WITH ONLY ONE MENU FOR BUTTON CHANNEL VOLUME IT SHOULD ALSO BE ENOUGH FOR EASY TO USE 
THE PERSONAL PREFERENCES FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE THEY LIKED FRUITY COLOURS LIKE UH BANANA YELLOW UH STRAWBERRY RED AND STUFF 
YEAH 
LIKE THAT 
THE ROUND SHAPES 
AND SOFT MATERIAL UM MATERIALS LIKE THE RUBBER 
IT SHOULD BE SOFT UH I IT SHOULD FEELING SPONGY OR S SPONGE BOB LIKE THINGS 
THE 
ELDERLY PEOPLE LIKE AU COLOURS WHICH YOU ARE BEING SEEN IN AUTUMN LIKE UM WOODS UM DARK BROWN RED DEEP REDS AND STUFF 
THEY LIKED SQUARE SHAPES WITH ROUND EDGES 
AND HARD MATERIALS LIKE WOOD UM TITANIUM 
THEY THOSE KIND OF MATERIALS THEY LIKED 
THIS IS A BIT LIKE THE YOUNG PEOPLES LIKE THE FRUITY COLOURS 
INNOVATIVE ALL THE COLOURS YOU USE THE BLUE THE RED THE WHAT THE YELLOW THAT STUFF 
AND THEN I TH I I PERSONALLY THOUGHT THE FRONT SIDE OF THE SHAPE SHOULD BE SOMETHING FOR THE YOUNGSTERS LIKE LIKE 
THIS OR SOMETHING 
IT'S IT'S A BIT LIKE A BANANA 
AND THE COLOUR SHOULD BE YELLOW OR SOMETHING 
AND FOR THE ELDERLY PEOPLE JUST PLAIN OLD 
BECAUSE WE DECIDED TO HAVE TWO KIND OF REMOTES TWO DESIGNS OR WAS IT TWO COLOURS 
DIFFERENT COLOURS YEAH 
WE SHOULD DECIDE WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE WITH ROUND SHAPES 
I THINK LIKE MY COLLEAGUE YOU SAID SO THAT'S E BETTER OR FOR THE ELDERLY PEOPLE SOMETHING LIKE LIKE THE IPOD OR SOMETHING WITH ROUND SQUARES 
SIMPLE BUT 
EASY TO USE 
SO THAT'S IT 
THAT IS MY 
YEAH LIKE THE OLDER O OLDER COLOURS I CAN MAYBE 
YEAH 
COLOURS THE THE ELDERLY PEOPLE 
OH 
LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AUTUMN COLOURS LIKE RED BROWN 
THEY LIKED THE WOOD A LOT 
SO MAYBE WE COULD GIVE IT LIKE WOODEN LOO LOOK LIKE OR SOMETHING ON THAT COLOUR 
AND A BIT BIT OLD SCHOOL STYLE RENAISSANCE MEDIEVAL KIND OF THINGS 
THIS KIND OF YEAH THIS KIND OF THINGS 
SO YOU USE THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE 
FRESH EXCITING 
AND THE OLD PEOPLE OLD AND BORING 
SO SORRY 
YEAH I THINK IT'S IT'S EASIER TO DO ONE COLOUR THAN ONE SHAPE 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE HAVE TO GET DIFFERENT SHAPES AND COLOUR WAY EASIER THAN YEAH THE SHAPES 
NO MATERIAL YEAH RUBBER RUBBER IS LIKE I SAID YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE MORE SOFT MATERIALS AND SPONGY ONES AND THE OLD PEOPLE LIKE PLAIN WOOD 
SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE IF WE'RE GOING TO USE 
REAL HARD RUBBER OR SOFT RUBBER 
OR SOMETHING SOMETHING BETWEEN THAT 
YEAH SOFT RUBBER WHICH YOU CAN YOU CAN FEEL IN IT 
OR NO

OR YOU GOING TO INVITE SPONGE BOB MAYBE HE CAN 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE BETTER THING TO DO 
YEAH W I THINK THAT L. C. D. SCREEN SHOULD BE LIKE 
YEAH THREE QUARTER OF THE OF THE 
YEAH THE BUTTONS WON'T GET THAT SMALL WHEN THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS 
MM-HMM 
LARGER I THINK 
YEAH BECAU BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
YEAH OKAY TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT IT WON'T GET THAT SMALL BECAUSE YOU HAVE HOW MUCH 
NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN BUTTONS ON THE SCREEN 
NO IT ZERO THE TWO DIGIT 
YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO BECAUSE SOME FAT PEOPLE WITH D THICK FINGERS WILL PRESS THREE BUTTONS AT SOME TIME 
YEAH TRUE BUT YEAH WE HAVE WE HAVE THE ZOOM OPTION RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IS A PEN YOU YOU C YOU CAN ALSO THE PEN 
YEAH THE FINGERS YEAH 
YEAH BUT THAT THAT CAN BE WITH PLAIN SOFT TISSUE 
YEAH YOU CAN BUY THIS IT 
MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO TO INCLUDE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES WHICH YOU CAN RECHARGE THROUGH THE DOCKING STATION 
SO IF THE BADG THE BATTERIES OR DID 
THEN YOU CAN OR YOU CAN UH CHANGE THEM 
YEAH YEAH YEAH LIKE THIS 
YEP 
YEAH NORMAL PLAIN YOU IN NORMAL PLAIN BATTERIES YOU CAN BUY IT THE SUPERMARKET OR RETAIL SHOP 
YEAH 
PRINT PLATE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A PRINT PLATE 
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A PRINT PLATE RIGHT 
ALWAYS USE 
I DUNNO WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT 
YEAH OKAY 
BUT 
YEAH OKAY BUT THE P PRINT PLATE OF L. L. C. D. SCREEN IS MORE ADVANCED THAN A NORMAL PRINT PLATE 
SO THAT THAT'S NOT OF ANY DISCUSSION I THINK 
MM I DON'T I DUNNO I DON'T THINK THAT'S 
YEAH YEAH OKAY BUT I D I I DON'T KNOW IF NOR O SO IT'S QUITE A SIMPLE L. C. D. 
YEAH IT'S QUITE A SIMPLE L. C. D. SCREEN 
I THINK THEY DON'T NEED THAT BIG OF C. P. U. 
YEAH OKAY TRUE TRUE 
TRUE 
YEAH 
WE HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS 
SO THE SHAPES IS SOMETHING BETWEEN THE SQUARE SHAPES WITH ROUND COLO CORNERS AND A ROUND SHAPES 
NO I DON'T THINK I THINK 
IT'S MORE ROUND THAN SQUARE 
SO IT MEETS I THINK IT MEETS MORE THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAN THE OLDER PEOPLE 
YEAH THAT'S OUR TARGET 
YEAH 
LOWER THAN FORTY YEARS I THINK 
IT WAS 
OH YEAH THAT THAT I THINK I THOUGHT THAT WAS A QUITE GOOD 
YEAH 
YOU CAN PUT IT IN YOUR TABLE WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT IT GET IT IN YOUR HAND 
YOU CAN PUT IT NEXT TO YOU AND THEN DIVE IT ON AND 
YEAH 
SO 
YOU CAN'T YOU YOU CAN'T UH YOU C YOU CAN DRAW IT IN YOUR PAPER AND THEN LOAD IT IN THE 
AND LOAD IT IN THE THE USER THE SERVER 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YOU HAVE TO GO BACK 
YEAH UH UH 
ISN'T IT BETTER TO HAVE THE SOUND AND THE GENERAL BUTTONS HORIZONTAL 
WITH THE MENUS AND THE PLUS 
I THINK IT'S 
SURE THEN 
YEAH 
FOR SOUND AND CHANNEL 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S IT'S EASIER TO HAVE TO SOMETHING LIKE 
UH A BUTTON UH MINUS HERE PLUS OVER HERE 
A MINUS HERE PLUS OVER HERE 
AND AN HOUR 
THE OTHER BUTTONS AND IN HERE THE TOP 
THE OPTIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE UH THE P. OVER HERE 
AND THE SOUND 
SOMETHING UH 
SOMETHING LIKE 
SH 
PLUS MINUS PLUS UH 
MEANS 
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO S YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT WITH ONE THUMB 
WHO'S THE USABILITY ENGINEERING 
SHE IS 
OH 
UM 
UH I HAVE THAT THIS IS NUMBERS 
OR A GOOD WATCH 
BU 
CHANNEL SELECTION 
PER HOUR ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT 
VOLUME SELECTION FOUR TIMES AN HOUR 
OH 
YEAH THAT DEPENDS ON ON ON THE REMOTE 
I THINK BECAUSE I HAVE TWO TELEVISIONS AT HOME 
ONE IS HORIZONTAL ONE IS VERTICAL SO IT DEPENDS 
YEAH 
DEPENDS 
YEAH LOWER 
TRUE 
IT'S GOT TO CHANGE 
YEAH SO IT IS USER INTERFACE 
COMPONENT 
YEAH I THINK IT'S IT'S EASY FOR THAT WHERE ARE YOU BUT THEN IT SAYS I'M HERE 
YEAH 
YEAH A MICROPHONE YEAH 
UM I THINK WHERE IT ISN'T SEEN 
THE MOST 
INSIDE 
YEAH 
I I BETWEEN THE ROUND OF THE R. 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH BU BUT 
I THINK THE LEFT IS UNDER CORNER SHOULD BE THE BEST 
WHERE ISN'T I IT ISN'T MOST IN SIGHT 
I THINK 
NO 
ACTUALLY DOESN'T 
I THINK I THOUGHT THE LIKE YOU SAID LIKE SCROLL NEXT TO THE REMOTE ISN'T THAT HANDY 
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO JUST UP WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO DO IN THE SCREEN 
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK YOU HAVE TO BACK BUTTON GO BACK 
IF YOU WANT TO CHOOSE AUDIO SETTINGS YOU PRESS AUDIO SETTINGS AND IT GOES TO THAT S SUB MENU 
YEAH 
YOU DO LIKE IT 
YEAH I THINK IT IS IS FASTER 
BECAU I THINK THE SCROLL'S EASIER IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTION THEN 
YOU 
UH-HUH 
YEAH OKAY TRUE 
OKAY 
OKAY NO PROBLEM 
OKAY 
UM 
NO COLOURS ARE CLEAR SHAPE IS CLEAR MATERIAL IS CLEAR

WE COULD 
OOPS 
YEAH 
WELL UH WE MADE A PROTOTYPE 
WE FIRST START WITH THE OVERALL UH 
THIS IS ABOUT THE TOTAL REMOTE CONTROL 
WE MADE IT GREEN 
YEAH 
IT'S A FRESH COLOUR 
AND UH THE SCREEN LIGHT BLUE 
UH UH THIS THE SCROLL BUTTON AND THE MICROPHONE ON THE ON THE SIDES HERE UNDER 
AND THE R. AND R. LOGO IT JUST SAYS R. AND R. NOW BUT UH 
ANY QUESTIONS SO FAR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH Y YOU PERHAPS YOU SHOULD MAKE IT A BIT BIG SO PEOPLE KNOW IT'S THERE AND UH 
OH 
HMM 
YOU PUSH THE SCROLL BUTTON AND IT'S CLAPS OUT IF THERE'S A 
REMOTE SETTINGS ET CETERA 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND YOU COULD ALSO TOUCH IT IS THAT IT COMES OUT AND AND SO THE THE THE SCROLL THING IS A WITH YOUR FINGERS 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
PERHAPS WE SHOULD USE THE TELETEXT SIGN IN P YEAH 
YEAH 
FORGOT 
UH WELL THIS IS THE TOTAL INTERFACE UH THAT IF IF THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
UH THE NUMBERS WHICH IS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD 
WE PUT IN IN AN EXTRA BUTTON ON 
WE CAN ERASE IT BUT IT'S THE BUTTON WHERE YOU CAN SWITCH CHANNELS 
JUST WHEN YOU ARE ON AND YOU GO TO TWO YOU CAN OR IF YOU GO TO FIVE YOU CAN GO BACK TO ONE WITH THAT BUTTON 
YEAH THAT ONE YEAH 
IT HAS A NAME 
AND UH UH WE PUT THAT ONE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HANDY THERE 
UH THIS THE ONE NUMBER OR TWO NUMBERS BUTTON 
BELOW THAT THE PAGE AND THE SOUND 
AND UH IN THE MIDDLE THE THE MUTE 
UH BATTERY INDICATOR 
IT'S IT'S A BIT BIG 
AND THIS IS THE UH THE ON OFF UH KNOP THE STAND BY UH KNOP 
OR AT LEAST IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE IT

YEAH THAT'S A BIT OF PROBLEM MAYBE 
YEAH 
I THINK YEAH THE BATTERY SHOULD BE IN HERE BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOTHING SO IF YOU COULD 
YEAH 
'CAUSE OTHERWISE I THINK I 
I THINK IT DOES 
I IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT GREEN THEN THE OLDER PEOPLE WON'T WON'T LIKE IT

YEAH 
BUT IT'S A ONE UH MAYBE UH 
YEAH 
WELL THEY THINK IT'S VERY TRUE BUT UH 
YEAH BUT 
WE SHOULD PERHAPS 
THAT NOT 
YEAH 
I THINK IT IS BECAUSE IT HAS AN L. C. D. SCREEN A MI MICROPHONE 
IT'S FROM RUBBER 
YEAH 
IT'S A ONE I THINK 
YEAH BECAUSE THEY'RE RIGHT ON YOUR SCREEN 
SO YOU CAN USE THE B THE THE ARROWS 
THEY'RE RIGHT ON YOUR SCREEN SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'D SEARCH

SO 
YEAH OKAY BUT SO THEY COULD 
UH I THINK IT IS 
IF THEY READ A MANUAL 
YEAH ALRIGHT 
BECAUSE IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S NOT UH DIFFICULT 
YOU SAY YOU SAY UH RECORD IT AT THE AT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN YOU SAY THE QUESTION AND THE ANSWER 
AND THAT'S EVERYTHING IT DOES THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
YEAH 
I THINK IT WOULD MAKE IT UH 
I WOULD MAKE IT TWO 
YEAH 
THERE 
OH 
YOU 
OH 
WELL 
TWO AND A HALF 
THERE 
NO

THESE ARE FEATURES 
ENOUGH FEATURES 
YEAH 
I THINK TWO OR THREE

NO IDEA NO I IT'S THE COLOURS AND THE 
I THINK IT IS BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK

YEAH 
LET'S MAKE A DIFFERENT REMOTE 
WELL 
MINE 
A TWO 
WE ONLY HAVE TWOS 
UH JUST TWOS 
IN THERE AND A FEW ONES

YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WE'RE GOING TO ERASE FEATURES OR SOMETHING 
DO YOU HAVE THE COST OR UH 
LET'S HOPE 
WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK 
WE'RE GOIN STILL GOING TO BE HERE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK 
I DOUBT IT 
PERHAPS WE'VE GOT FEATURES THAT DON'T EXIST IN THE EXCEL SHEET 
NO IT WAS IN MY UH MY INFORMATION IS UH 
YEAH 
WELL IF IT DOESN'T WORK 
I WANT TO FILL IT IN BUT UH 
BUT YOU SHOULD UH DIRECT 
THE NUMBER OF 
WE'VE GOT A BATTERY ONE OR AT TWO BATTERIES ARE NOT 
NO NO BATTERY WITH TWO SMALL BATTERIES 
YEAH 
I WOULD DO A BATTERY WE DO 
RIGHT 
A BATTERY 
NO BATTERY RIGHT 
ELECTRONICS SIMPLE CHIP ADVANCED CHIP RIGHT 
YEAH SO THIS ONE AND THIS ONE 
UH WE UH WE HAVE UM SINGLE WHAT 
ARE WE 
OH YAY 
THE SINGLE 
UH TH TH IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK UH PEOPLE 
WE HAVE RUBBER 
THIRTEEN 
WITH A SCROLL WHEEL RIGHT 
SO UH INTEGRATED 
NO UH 
I DON'T KNOW 
OH YEAH RIGHT WE WANT TO IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IN 
YEP 
FIFTEEN UH TOO BAD 
UH BUT WITH SPECIAL COLOUR WE HAVE 
A SPECIAL FORM RIGHT

YEAH WE COULD USE YEAH A BIT 
SIXTEEN POINT THREE

COULD COULD WE DO IT IN A REGULAR CHIP ON PRINT OR SOMETHING 
NO 
UM YOU YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT ARE UH 
WE CHANGED THE 
YEAH AND THE SINGLE CURVED TO UNCURVED 
NO 
YEAH BUT IT'S TOO 
YEAH BUT IT IS UH IT IT IS A NEW FEATURE TO USE SOMETHING SPECIAL 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH THAT'S DIFFICULT 
YEAH 
OH 
WE COULD MAKE IT TITANIUM INSTEAD OF RUBBER

YEAH SO YOU ALWAYS LOSE THE SPECIAL COLOUR 
YOU C YOU COULD MAKE IT ALWAYS BLACK LIKE NORMAL REMOTE 
OH RIGHT YEAH 
YEAH WE SHOULD U YEAH

OR NOT 
SO YOU YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE A NICE REMOTE 
IT'S TOO BAD FOR THE SPEAKER 
SHOULD WE CHANGE THAT TH THAT THAT'S A ONE OF NOT OR NOT

AND THIS 
EVERYTHING OKAY 
WELL THE NEXT PART UH MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT 
DIFFICULT TO DO 
IN A GROUP BUT I AM WILLING TO TRY TO 
BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THE FINANCE AND I HAVE A NICE EXCEL SHEET TO DO THAT 
AND UM I'M NOT SURE IF I PUT IT IN THE PROJECT FOLDER 
LIKE IN THAT 
UM AND WE'RE GOING TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCTION COSTS AND IF THEY ARE UH UNDER OR AT TWELVE EURO FIFTY 
WE'RE GOOD AND IF THEY'RE NOT WE'RE GOING TO UH OUR DESIGN BUT WE HAVE TO DO THAT UH VERY VERY QUICK I THINK YES 
UM I DON'T KNOW IF I 
PUT THE EXCEL SHEET IN THE 
NO NOT IN THE 
FOLDER 
I THINK IT'S 
I THINK IT'S STILL IN MY OWN DOCUMENTS FOLDER 
OH SHIT 
SO 
OKAY WELL THIS IS IT 
UM MAYBE I COULD ASK ONE OF YOU TO UH FILL OUT ONE IS THAT I CAN ALSO UH TAKE MINUTES 
AND UH MAYBE THE OTHER CAN UH SO THAT THING TO COUNT UH NUMEROUS FUNCTIONS 
WELL WE HAVE TO COUNT SOME THINGS AND WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SOME THINGS 
BUT YOU HAVE TO FILL IN THIS COLUMN HUH 
NO UH COUNT UH NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS BECAUSE FOR EVERY BUTTON YOU HAVE TO PAY AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT SCREEN SHOTS 
SO ARE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SCREENS SO 
YEAH BUT IT'S IT'S MORE ABOUT THE ENERGY SOURCE HUH 
DO YOU USE A HAND DYNAMO A BATTERY KINETIC OR SOLAR CELLS 
WE'LL WAIT 
YEAH 
I'LL JUST FILL IT IN 
UM RUBBER INDEED 
YEAH I THINK THAT WILL BE 
OUR BEST BET 
AND WHAT DID YOU CHANGE 
YOU CHANGED THE UH SCROLL WHEEL AND 
UH BUT IT'S JUST ONE 
POINT IS MAYBE YOU SHOULD SHOULD UH 
YEAH YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD DROP THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
AND THEN YOU CAN KEEP THE CURVE 
OR CAN'T YOU 
OR MAKE IT IN A HAND DYNAMO BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WILL WORK 
YEAH MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT UH A WOODEN REMOTE CONTROL ONLY HELPS FOR UH OLD PEOPLE WE DISCUSSED YES 
YEAH BUT IT'S ONLY A HALF 
BUT I THINK THE ONLY OPTION IS TO DROP THE UH SAMPLE SPEAKER 
YEAH BUT ISN'T IT PER REMOTE THAT YOU PAY 
HALF 
I THINK YOU PAY HALF PER REMOTE 
SO EACH REMOTE WITH A SPECIAL COLOUR 
I HOPE 
SO THE BATTERY WE HAVE UM ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT 
BECAUSE OF THING YEAH WELL YOU CAN AT LEAST MAKE IT CURVED AGAIN 
BECAUSE THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT HUH 
SO IT'S CURVED IT'S STILL THAT SO WE WE DROPPED THE SPEECH RECOGNITION TOGETHER WITH THE SPEAKER 
WE DROPPED THE SCROLL WHEEL 
AND THE REST IS THE SAME HUH 
UM I RIGHT 
YES 
NO BUT YOU C YEAH 
OKAY BUT THIS THIS NEW REMOTE WE CAN AFFORD 
HMM 
NO I HADN'T 
I JUST RECEIVED IT 
THEY DON'T WORK IS HARD TO THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT 
YEAH AND THAT'S IT 
TWELVE EURO FIFTY 
UM AND DID YOU TRY TO MAKE A NEW DESIGN OR WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO 
IT DIDN'T WORK 
HMM 
STRANGE 
UH YOU CAN ARRANGE 
HMM CAN'T YOU THEN JUST SAY COPY 
NEW PAGE 
PASTE 
YES 
SELECT NONE 
OKAY AND NOW YOU CAN ERASE 
WELL IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE 
OH NO 
WELL YOU CAN DRAW OVER IT WITH WHAT UH PEN 
OH 
YEAH 
SORRY 
WELL BUT THAT'S ALSO USEFUL FOR THE EVALUATION 
BECAUSE I THINK UH WE HAVE A PROTOTYPE NOW WHICH WE CAN AFFORD AND UH WE ONLY NEED TO DRAW A LITTLE BIT TO GET A GOOD UH 
DESIGN 
DOODLE 
AND I THINK WE SHOULD THEN MOVE ON TO THE PRODUCTION EVALUATION BECAUSE OF THE TIME 
LET'S SEE WE CAN SAVE THIS NOW 
AND MOVE BACK TO HERE 
MM-HMM 
AND THEN ALL GREEN 
OKAY WELL THANK YOU 
OH NO 
HEY BUT YOU CAN ERASE THAT 
UH UH 
RIGHT 
AND YOU CAN'T ERASE THIS 
HMM STRANGE 
OKAY WELL UH JUST LEAVE IT AT THIS AND QUICKLY SAVE 
UM AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO THE PROJECT OUR PRODUCT EVALUATION 
WE JUST DID OUR PROJECT EVALUATION 
UM WELL I THINK I CAN SIT FOR THAT SINCE IT'S ALMOST MY FINAL SLIDE 
UM 
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT UH THE PROCESS 
HOW SATISFIED ARE WE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND YOU COULD ASK THINGS 
AND FOR ME TOO SOMETIMES WAS A SURPRISE WHO WAS GOING TO PRESENT WHAT HUH 
AND UH 
YEAH 
SO YOU WOULD SAY UH COMMUNICATE DURING OUR INDIVIDUAL UH WORK 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL PROBABLY TO SIMULATE THE WHOLE WORKING UH PROCESS HUH TH YOU CAN'T HAVE A MEETING UH FOR SEVERAL WEEKS 
NO 
SO YOU DON'T THINK THE SMARTBOARD IS IS REALLY USEFUL OR 
YEAH SO IT'S MAYBE A BIT UNNATURAL ALSO 
THAT WASN'T ME 
UH SO UM THE MEANS WE DISCUSSED THE SMART BOARD AND WHAT ABOUT UH THIS DIGITAL PEN 
YEAH WELL I SEE IT IS A A NORMAL PEN AND AND AND ONLY YOU USE IT TO UH GET IT IN THE COMPUTER HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY UM 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE TEAMWORK 
YEAH WELL I THINK SO IT 
WE 
YEAH BUT THAT WAS IT WAS OUR ASSIGNMENT HUH 
OKAY AND MAYBE I SHOULD WALK OUT OF THE ROOM WHEN YOU DISCUSS UH THIS POINT THE LEADERSHIP 
YEAH WELL OKAY 
AND CREATIVITY 
WELL WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS I'D SAY WE HAVE BEEN CREATIVE HUH 
BUT 
THERE WAS ROOM FOR 
YOU DID 
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT 
AT SOME TIMES I SOMETIMES I RECEIVED LIKE LIKE FIVE EMAILS AT AT ONE MOMENT AND THEN 
I EVEN GOT SPAM 
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND I WAS WORKING AND WORKING AND WORK OKAY WELL UM BUT AFTER ALL WE CAN SAY UH WE ARE SATISFIED BUT IT IT COULD'VE BEEN UH BETTER 
WHEN WE GOT UH WHEN WE HAVE WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN UH MORE INFORMATION 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT WAS A BIT MEAN TO PUT IT IN THE END 
AND UH WHAT WERE THE OTHER POINTS TO TO IMPROVE THIS WHOLE PROCESS 
YEAH THEY'RE PRETTY HEAVY 
AND SO MORE TIME UH WE MIGHT HAVE IMPROVED THE THE QUALITY OF WORK IS WHAT YOU SAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO MORE TIME DURING THE INDIVIDUAL WORK PHASES 
UM OKAY WELL UH I JUST GOT MY WARNING FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES 
SO I'LL MOVE ON IT I GUESS MY LAST SLIDE YES WHICH IS THE CLOSING 
WELL UH WE MANAGED BUT WE DID IT VERY QUICKLY 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO WHEN IT ISN'T IS IT WHEN IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE TO QUICKLY RE ARRANGE IT AND SAY OKAY 
THIS IS IT BUT WE HAD TO DO IT HUH BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A DESIGN AND THAT IS WITHIN THE BUDGET 
AND WE EVALUATED 
MAYBE WE SHOULD RE EVALUATE UH THE PRODUCT BUT WE DID THAT BEFORE AND WE ALSO EVALUATED THE PROJECT 
AND I THINK UH EVERYBODY'S UH VERY HAPPY 
AT LEAST I AM WITH THE RESULTS SO UH CELEBRATION WELL 
FOR THE OTHER IF YOU BECAUSE UH I HAVE TO WRITE THE FINAL REPORT NOW 
BUT UH WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CO OPERATION AND I HAD A VERY NICE DAY AS FAR

I KNOW WE SHOULD REMOVE THIS BUT IT WON'T UH 
OKAY 
AND UH PLEASE PUT IT IN THE PROJECT FOLDER THEN HUH

OH OKAY 
HMM-HMM 
AGENDA 
OH SORRY 
OKAY 
GET UP STAND UP 
JUST 'KAY 
VIEW 
JUST EXAMPLE COLOUR IS UH THERE'S ONE OF THE COLOURS WE WOULD LOOK AT UH SO IN OUR PROTOTYPE 
OKAY 
YEAH JUST UH JUST AN IDEA ABOUT HOW TO UM THE THAT COULD ALSO BE POSSIBLE 
UH WELL IT'S AN IDEA IN A S 
DO NOT FORGET IT 
IT FUNCTION IT IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO BE SOME UH BIG OF COURSE 
THE MICROPHONE COULD BE JUST A MINOR UH HOLE UH IN THE LEFT UH BUTTON 
OKAY UM 
WE ALSO MADE SOME UH IDEAS ABOUT HOW UH THE OPTIONS MENU WOULD WORK 
UH USING THE SCROLL BUTTON ON SIDES UH YOU UH I UH UM 
YEAH YOU PUSH THE SCROLL BUTTON 
AND A DROP DOWN MENU OR A PULL OUT MENU COMES OUT AND UH YOU GET UH YOU GET THE OPTIONS UH BECOMING AVAILABLE 
FOR EXAMPLE UH T. V. SETTINGS UH REMOTE SETTINGS ET CETERA 
SO UH YOU CAN SCROLL DOWN TO WITH THE SCROLL UH BUTTON UH SO YOU CAN USE UH IT'S HERE JUST PUSH IT IN 
UH THE MENU COMES TO LIKE THIS AND UH I IT ALL BECOMES VISIBLE 
UM 
YEAH THAT'S C YEAH 
INDEED 
OKAY UM IT'S ALSO UH NICE TO USE THAT UM WE MADE A SMALL UH MINE 
UH THE OPTIONS MENU UH BECOMING AVAILABLE WHEN PRESSING THE UH SCROLL UH BUTTON 
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE TELETEXT 
WH WHICH IS USED UH WHICH SHOULD STILL BE USED AND WE THINK THAT IT'S UH VERY HANDY TO PUT IT UH NOT UH UNDER THE OPTIONS MENU 
BUT IN UH YES 
NO NO PART UH 
IN A SEPARATE BUTTON YEAH 
A SIGN YEAH JUST LIKE OKAY INDEED 
OKAY WE CAN UH MODIFY THAT LATER 
OKAY 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT NEXT UH 
PREVIOUS PAGE YEAH INDEED 
OH MY GOD 
IT'S QUITE LARGE 
OKAY 
YOU CAN USE VERY CLEARLY NOW THAT THE UH TELETEXT AND OPTIONS MENU ISN'T UH TAKING UH MUCH UH UH IT'S TAKING MUCH PART OF THE SCREEN 
SO IT'S VERY UH WHEN YOU UH WHEN YOU USE IT DOESN'T UH BECOME IRRITATING TO USE 
'CAUSE IF YOU PUT IT IN THE TOP YOU ALWAYS GET IS THE THE OPTIONS MENU 
'CAUSE PEOPLE REGULARLY UH READ FROM LEFT TOP IT RIGHT DOWN SO 
OKAY 
HUH 
FULL SCREEN 
ALRIGHT 
HUH 
MY NAME MY JOB 
SORRY YOU SAID THE POWERPOINT 
WHAT 
BLING 
NOW UH THE SINGLE CURVED IDEA WAS UH 
YEAH OKAY YOU GO UM 
YEAH 
THE SIDEWAYS VIEW UH THAT THAT THAT UM 
UH NOT THAT PEN 
NOT THAT PEN 
SUPPOSE SO 
OH 
OH MY GOD IT WORKS 
YEAH THAT'S THE SINGLE CURVE INDEED 
YEP 
THAT'S NOT VERY I IT'S ALSO UH VERY HANDY IF YOU MAKE A SIDE CURVE WAY TO MAKE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL VERY THIN AT THE BOTTOM UH IT A BOTTOM AT A BOTTOM 
UH MAKE IT UH RATHER THICK ON THE TOP BECAUSE UH IN THE TOP IT HAS UH THE SCREEN 
WHICH TAKES UH IN SOME UH SPACE AND THE BATTERIES CAN BE LOCATED OVER THERE IS UH 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH 
OKAY INDEED 
YEAH 
I THINK SO 
IT'S PRETTY FANCY 
YOU GET THE 
YEAH 
IT'S TRUE IT'S A ONE 
VERY FANCY 
IT'S VERY TRUE BECAUSE WE DESIGNED IT TO BE VERY FANCY SO 
IT'S VERY FANCY I THINK 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE THIS 
NO OKAY SO SO IT'S FANCY 
YEAH 
AND UH UH THE SCROLL IS RUBBER IS IS 
NO ENOUGH TO I THINK 
HUH 
WITH THE ONES 
YEAH 
TAKE A HARDER LOOK YEAH SURE 
IT'S EASIER THAN THE REGULAR UH REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THEY ARE A LOT EASIER TO FIND THAN UH TH THEN ON THE REGULAR REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE YOU HAVE TO UH FIND OUT WHAT WHICH SIGN OR ICON MEANS IN UH EVERY BUTTON 
SO YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO USE THE THE THE MANUAL TO UNDERSTAND MOST YEAH 
I THINK IT'S UH IT'S A TWO AT LEAST 
IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT 
A THREE 
AND WHY IS THAT 
IT SAID BO BOTH THE OPTIONS 
YEAH 
A TWO A TWO 
UH THE NEXT QUESTION THE NEXT QUESTION 
OH MY GOD 
YEAH I WAS UH YEAH 
I THINK IT'S THE MOST USEFUL UH REMOTE CONTROL OVER TO BE MANUFACTURED 
YEAH BUT BECAUSE IT HAS THE REGULAR UH CONTROLS LI UH SO YOU CAN SEE IN THE SCREEN NOW AND UH 
YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE OTHER OPTIONS UH ALWAYS UH IN YOUR SCREEN 
SO IT'S IT I THINK IT'S REALLY EASY TO USE 
YOU WANT THESE OPTIONS TO 
OH SURE 
PERHAPS THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST UH 
UH BECAUSE A LOT OF 
CHANNEL ONE CHANNEL FOUR YEAH 
YEAH I THINK IT DOES 
BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T UH 
UH A TWO 
SURE TWO 
OH 
TWO 
GIVE ME MORE 
NO 
THAT'S DEFINITELY OUR UH 
A FALSE YEAH 
YEAH INDEED 
YEAH AS OPTIONAL 
HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH IT IS IT IS HARDER TO 
IT LIKE 
GEEZ 
WE'RE GETTING PAID 
WE'RE GETTING PAID 
OH 
YEAH IT'S A THREE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE IT UH RATHER FLEXIBLE BUT NOT TOO FLEXIBLE BECAUSE IT HAS A L. C. D. SCREEN 
HARD TO LOSE YEAH IT SH AND IT'S EASY TO FIND 
ISN'T HARD TO LOSE 
ISN'T HARD TO LOSE YEAH 
YEAH THIS THIS IS HARD TO LOSE 
THIS 
TWO YEAH 
AND MOST ALL BECAUSE OF THE OPTION TO WHOA 
OH 
PUT THE COR CURSOR ON THE 
CLICK 
TRUE 
TRUE 
OH YEAH 
OH 
MATERIALS YEAH 
OH OKAY 
SO UM UH MAKE IT MAKE IT A TWO 
A TWO 
I THINK IT'S TWO 
I THINK IT'S TWO T TWO IT IT 
WELL PERHAPS NOT 
WELL N NOT EXACTLY BUT UH UH IF IT HAD SOME GAMES ON IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT IT'S FOR A REMOTE CONTROL I THINK IT I IT WOULD SATISFY THOSE NEEDS 
YEAH THE SPEECH POSSIBILITY THE COLOURS 
SCROLL OPTIONS YEAH 
YEAH 
THE EASY VOLUME UP BUTTON 
REMOTE YOUNGER PEOPLE USUALLY USE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO PUT IN THE VOLUME 
TURN UH TURN UP THE VOLUME 
TWO 
ONE TWO THREE 
RIGHT 
OH 
OKAY TRUE YEAH 
I THINK IT'S EASIER TO USE THAN A REGULAR REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUSH ON THE OPTIONS MENU 
YOU GET THE THE THE VARIOUS OPTIONS UH ENTIRELY EXPLAINED 
ENTIRELY EXPLAINED 
INSTEAD OF UH JUST FINDING OUT WHAT AN ICON MEANS IN A BUTTON 
YEAH YOU CAN NAVIGATE 
YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED OKAY 
LET'S START OVER AGAIN THEN 
A TWO 
OH YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH 
AND THERE 
THE AVERAGE 
YEAH I THINK SO

IT'S A FLY 
UH UM 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
YEAH

AS WELL AS THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
WOAH 
COUNT IT 
YOU GOT EXCEL TO COUNT 
OH OKAY 
WELL I DRA UH DANNY DANNY I'LL DO THAT BECAUSE I DRAW THE UH 
NO NO SOLAR CELL NO NO NO NO 
ONE HAND DYNAMO 
HAND 
AN ADVANCED CHIP 
YEAH YEAH 
SINGLE ONE SINGLE CURVED 
DOUBLE CURVED WAS UH UH SO UH JU THREE DIMENSIONAL 
BUT IT ISN'T THREE DIMENSIONAL IT ISN'T CURVED IN A L 
NO NO NO SINGLE CURVED IS LIKE THIS 
OH THAT'S THE ONLY CURVE YOU MADE INTO THE UH CURVED LIKE THAT 
THAT'S UH 
HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH WE GOTTA INTEGRATE SCROLL WHEEL AND PUSH BUTTON BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUSH IT AND YOU W IT WON'T JUST P UH MAKES POSSIBLE TO USE 
NOT GOING TO WORK 
OKAY 
OKAY UM 
BUT NOW BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS 
WE DON'T GET THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS 
DAMN 
OKAY 
NAH 
WE COULD ALSO THE SCROLL WHEEL 
YOU COULD MAKE IT JUST A REGULAR SCROLL WHEEL 
YEAH 
IF YOU CAN'T PUSH IT YOU HAVE TO TAP THE THE OPTIONS WINDOW UH BUTTON HERE AND THEN UH SCROLL DOWN WITH THE IDEA WITH UH WITH UH THE BUTTON 
NORMAL SCROLL WHEEL 
ALSO 
OKAY SO WE DON'T EXACTLY AND THE SINGLE WE DON'T NEED A CURVE 
'S POSSIBLE TO LOSE CURVE 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S MEANT WITH SCR UH WITH S CURVE 
THE CURVE IS UH IN A DIMENSION 
IF YOU MAKE IT A FLAT ONE IS NO IT'S ONE CURVE YOU GOT NO CURVES 
YEAH OKAY 
ONE TWO 
OH OKAY INDEED 
SO IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE 
NO 
THE SAMPLE SPEAKER IS TWO D WAIT OF US FOUR POINTS 
YEAH UH BECAU UH WHEN YOU LOSE THE 
YEAH 
NO THAT'S ONE 
MAKE IT W UH WHEN YOU MADE IT UH UH UH A REMOTE CONTROL OF WOOD 
YOU DON'T MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL OF UH 
IT ISN'T 
WHAT 
IT KNOCK THE SAMPLE SPEAKER YEAH 
AND SAMPLE SENSOR 
BUT UM YEAH COURSE BUT WHAT WE'LL HAVE 
LET'S MAKE IT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN 
A COLOUR 
YEAH SPECIAL COLOURS FRUITY COLOURS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THEY DON'T SELL GREEN RUBBER PLANTS 
ALRIGHT 
NO NO NO 
IF WE ALSO THE SCROLL WHEEL AND MAKE IT TOTALLY UH DEPENDING UH DEPENDENT ON UH THE TOUCH SCREEN 
THEN IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE 
AND THEN YOU CAN AND THEN YOU CAN ADD TO THE COLOURS 
SPECIAL CO OKAY IF YOU ALSO UH IF YOU LOSE THE 
YOU LOSE THIS ONE YOU GOT ELEVEN POINT FIVE AND YOU MAKE I AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE UH THE SPEC SINGLE CURVE FOR EXAMPLE 
HOW DO UH UH HOW MANY COLOURS 
SPECIAL COLOURS ALL THE COLOURS YOU WANT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE UP 
YEAH BUT UH WHEN YOU USE MORE THAN ONE COLOUR IT'S A SPECIAL COLOUR 
I SUPPOSE 
YEAH 
NO WE WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE ANO ANOTHER COLOUR 
YEAH INDEED YEAH 
YOU DON'T NEED FOUR OF THIS UH FOUR OF THOSE SPECIAL COLOURS NO NO NO NO REMOTE

SO 'KAY 
TWENTY MINUTES 
OKAY SO YOU HAD THIS LIST TO START 
ALRIGHT 
WHEN DID YOU RECEIVE THIS LIST 
OH OKAY 
OH OKAY 
I SUPPOSE THIS IS A 
OKAY SO WE ALSO THE SCROLL WHEEL THE S 
AND THE MICROPHONE 
OKAY 
STRANGE 
YOU CAN ONLY RE ERASE 
OH 
OH NO 
BLING 
OH 
JUST UP SOMEWHERE B UH BESIDES IT RIGHT 
UH WE ALREADY TRY 
ALL I NEED IS NO MIC 
BON CHANCE 
NO ADD 
YEAH 
SO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LINES AND TEXT AND THE PEN 
HUH LOOKS FUCKING BORING NOW 
DEADLINES WERE SOMETIMES VERY SHORT 
BUT AND STRESSFUL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT BUT WHY NOT WORK HERE TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE 
WHY SHOULD WE BE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER IN THIS DIFFERENCE UH DIFFERENT ROOMS 
YEAH 
HUH OH RIGHT 
BUT THE TECHNOLOGY WAS UH FANTASTIC 
WORK NOW 
PERHAPS IT IS E 
YEAH PERHAPS IT IS EASIER TO GET ONE OF THIS UH DIG DIGITAL PENS ARE S AND IT UH AND LAY OUT NEXT TO THAT KEYBOARD OVER THERE 
SO YOU CAN DRAW UH IS IT OVER THE ON THE SCREEN 
YEAH 
IT'S USEFUL BUT NOT UM 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT THIS PEN ON THE SCREEN UH UH FOR EXAM AND LINE SO D BEING DRAWN AT AT TWO OR THREE CENTIMETRES UH BELOW 
ALRIGHT 
THE PROJECT UH BECAUSE OF THE DEADLINES YOU DIDN'T HAD THE TIME TO UH HAVE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO UH TO MAKE A VERY UH 
QUALITATI QUALITATIVE UH PRESENTATION 
SO YOU SAID UH THIS 
UH THE DIFFERENT POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS UH IN WHICH YOU PUT YOUR UH MATERIAL ON THE 
OH 
WASN'T ME 
BUT I DIDN'T I UH 
I SAID IT IT BUT UH WELL 
YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE IT SH 
TO MAKE SOME DESIGNS IT IS VERY EASY 
YEAH 
BUT TO WRITE IT TH YEAH 
YEAH IT'S TOO BIG IT'S TOO FAT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
NOT TOO MUCH INTO IT IT IT IT 
YEAH OR THE ROOM FOR IT WAS THE IDEA TO BE CREATIVE SO 
YOU GOT SOME STANDARD IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD AND THIS WHAT CAME OUT 
YEAH

YEAH 
WAS SEARCHING AND SEARCHING 
NO WE I DIDN'T KNOW 
MAKE A R YEAH 
YEAH 
NO STEPPING ON THE TABLE AND THEN LOOKING AT THE INTERNET PAGE 
NO 
YEAH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COSTS 
FIRST OF ALL I DIDN'T THINK UH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN UH FIRST POINT ABOUT UH IT WAS POSSIBLE UH UH YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
FASTER LAPTOP 
OH 
THEY WERE THEY WERE JUST FINE 
OH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH SURE 
OH THANK YOU

MM-HMM 
YEAH OKAY 
OF COURSE 
MM 
MM THE YEAH 
SMALL 
SHIT 
'KAY 
EVALUATION 
'KAY MY TASK WAS THIS TIME TO PUT UP A QUESTIONNAIRE 
BY WHICH WE CAN EVALUATE THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL BY THE QUESTIONS WE REQUIREMENTS FROM THE OF THE USERS 
MY NAME MY JOB OKAY 
THE METHODS 
QUESTIONNAIRE WITH SEVEN POINT SCALE FROM ONE TO SEVEN FROM TRUE TO FALSE 
LIKE QUESTION IS REMOTE BIG ENOUGH WE CAN SAY IT'S TRUE OR IT'S FALSE BY STEPS 
NO MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE SEVEN MEANS TRUE 
THE THREE IMPORTANT THINGS OF REFA ARE UH FROM THE OF THIS YEAR IS OR IS THE REMOTE CONTROL FANCY ENOUGH 
SO IT IN INNOVATIVE ENOUGH AND SO IT EASY ENOUGH TO USE 
AND THEN EVALUATION ITSELF 
OH 
SO 
OKAY 
FIRST QUESTION 
SO THE DESIGN FANCY ENOUGH 
PROJECT MANAGER WHAT DO YOU THINK 
BUT DOES IT 
YEAH 
THINK 
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN 
ISN'T GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT HEAVY AT THE TOP 
WITH TWO BATTERIES THE WHOLE PRINT PLATE AND IT AND TOP AND IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT QUITE A LOT I THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH WE HAVE TO RATE 
SO IT FANCY ENOUGH 
TRUE IS ONE FALSE IS SEVEN 
SO FANCY ENOUGH MEANS DOES IT COMES TO THE YOUNGER PEOPLE AND THE OLDER PEOPLE 
I THINK 
YEAH I HAVE TO AGREE ALL THE COLOUR COLOURS DON DON DOESN'T MATTER THAT UM THAT MUCH NOW IT'S ONLY DESIGN 
AND THE DESIGN 
SO 
A TWO 
YEAH I ONE SIDE I WOULDN I SHOULD USE THAT ONE BUT IT DOESN'T 
OKAY NO IT'S TWO 
TRUE IS A ONE 
VERY TRUE IS IT VERY TRUE OR ISN'T THAT TRUE 
YEAH I THINK TWO 
THAT'S FANCY ENOUGH 
THEN 
OKAY 
LET'S GIVE IT A TWO 
SO IT INNOVATIVE 
ENOUGH 
WE HAVE FOR THE SEARCH FUNCTION 
THE SCROLLER A BIT I THINK IT'S IT'S A ONE YEAH 
TRUE 
ALSO HUH UH-HUH THE BUTTONS ARE THEY EASY TO FIND 
THAT WAS A BIG REQUIREMENT OF THE OLD PEOPLE 
ARE ALL THE BUTTONS EASY TO FIND 
NOT ONLY THOSE BUTTONS ALL THE BUTTONS 
I THINK TH IT'S 
EASY TO 
YEAH I THINK THIS IS EASY NOW 
I THINK TH I THINK THE OPTIONS BUTTONS ARE NOT THE THE EASIEST WAY TO IT 
TO HANDLE 
TRUE 
I WOULD RATE IT A 
YEAH OKAY THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE 
BUT THAT'S THAT'S VANTAGE OF L. C. D. SCREEN YOU CAN HAVE TEXT 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S A THREE 
I PERSONALLY THINK BECAUSE I D I DON'T THINK I MAYBE IT'S EASY TO USE IT HAS TO BE EASY TO FIND RIGHT AWAY 
I I THINK IF YOU HAVE THE BUTTON TO THE RIGHT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN FIND THE OPTION BUTTON THAT SAY 
YOU CAN TOUCH IT 
YEAH OKAY BUT YOU HAVE YOU THEN YOU HAVE HERE IS WRITTEN OPTION IN HERE THE TELETEXT BUTTON RIGHT 
OKAY THEN OKAY GOOD 
THEN I THINK ALSO TWO YEAH 
YEP 
IT'S EASY TO USE AS WELL FOR YOUNGER AS ELDERL ELDERLY PEOPLE 
YOUNG MEANS SIXTEEN TO FORTY YEARS 
AND ELDERLY FROM FORTY EIGHT AT THEIR DEATH 
ALSO IF YOU'RE SIXTY YEARS OLD 
ALSO 
YEAH AS WELL AS YOUR IF YOU'RE FIF SIXTY YEARS OLD YOU'RE HOLDING ONE OF THESE THINGS IN YOUR HAND 
NO BUT WE'RE GOING TO THE MAKE THIS F FOR A ALL KIND OF PEOPLE USE IT IT IT HAS TO BE 
IF YOU READ THE MANUAL ALWAYS 
SO 
ALSO TWO 
NOT A SEVEN FOR THIS 
I WOULD ALSO SAY THREE 
REMOTES OVERWHELMED WITH BUTTONS 
NO THAT THAT'S THAT'S YEAH 
TH THAT'S A ONE I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY A ONE 
NO 
OH YEAH 
YEAH I THINK ISN'T THIS HAS TO BE SOMETHING LIKE ISN'T OVERWHELMED 
TRUE 
REMOTE CONTROL HAS UH COLOURS THAT DIFFERENT THAT MEET DIFFERENT TARGET GROUPS 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
ALSO WITH RUBBER 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
THAT'S A ONE 
OKAY 
UH I HAVE 
THE MATERIAL USED IS SPONGY THAT THAT'S UH THAT'S A ONE THAT'S UM RUBBER 
YEAH I TH THINK IT'S NOT THE MOST SPONGY THING 
YEAH 
REMOTE CONTROL IS HARD TO LOSE 
YOU YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T LOSE IT IF YOU'RE SIXTY YEARS OLD 
F FIRST TIME IS THE THING YOU DIDN DIDN'T ADJUST UH SET THE MICROPHONE AND THEN YOU LOSE IT THEN YOU HAVE LOST IT 
IT ISN'T HARD ON 
I THINK I THINK THIS IS A TWO PERSONALLY 
NO 
ISN'T HARD TO LOSE 
YEAH 
YOU CAN'T LOSE IT 
OR IF YOU'RE YOU'RE SIXTY YEARS OLD YOUR DEMANDS 
I THINK YEAH I THINK ALSO 
HUH 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
NO 
OKAY OKAY OKAY 
REMOTE CONTROL MAINLY BE SOLD TO YOUNGER PEOPLE 
YEAH 
TRUE 
VERY TRUE 
NO I DON'T THINK VERY TRUE BECAUSE THE COLOURS 
WE HAVE THE COLOURS 
UM WE HAVE THE BUTTONS AS AREN'T THAT THAT MUCH 
NAH THE MATERIAL ISN'T THAT 
SO I DON I THINK I THINK IT'S A THREE 
YEAH BUT I UH 
OKAY OKAY 
I THINK BECAUSE YEAH 
IN THE FEATURES 
BECAUSE YOUNGER PEOPLES ARE CR CRITICAL AND THEY WANTED A LOT OF FEATURES IN THIS THING 
L. C. D. SCREEN AND SCROLL 
I I THINK THEY'LL BE QUITE MET WITH THEIR EXPECTATIONS 
NO 
IT'S OTHER FEATURES BASICALLY THE L. C. D. TOUCH SCREEN IS FEATURE 
THE MICROPHONE IS A FEATURE 
YEAH OKAY 
I THINK YEAH AND THEN YOU HAVE THE AUDIO SETTINGS CHANNEL SETTING VIDEO SETTINGS 
YEAH YEAH 
SO I'VE CHOS I SH I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S A ONE 
PERSONALLY YEAH 
I THINK ONCE YOU'VE 'CAUSE YOU HAVE THE CHANNEL FEATURES B UH YOU HAVE THE UH SCREEN FEATURES AUDIO FEATURES 
THE YOU HAVE ALL BUTTONS ON IT WHICH YOU'D LIKE MICROPHONE EXTRA L. C. D. SCREEN EXTRA SCROLL 
THING EXTRA 
MAKE IT MAKE IT A TWO 
OR MAKE IT UH A FUCKING TWO 
YOU CAN USE THE REMOTE CONTROL IS R. AND R. 
HAS UH YEAH D DID HAVE NAH Y YOU HAVE THE BLACK ONE 
AND WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE ALSO A YELLOW ONE 
MAYBE TWO 
X. MARKS SPOT 
AND THE MAIN IS AVAIL THAT IS AVAILABLE IS EASY TO USE 
YEAH THA THAT'S IS TRUE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH UH 
I THINK THAT WE THAT WOULD BE QUITE HARD TO LEARN TO USE IT 
NO I'M NOT NOT CONVINC 
LET'S GO THE FOR I THINK IT WOULD BE A T YEAH TWO 
NOW LOWER 
SO OKAY WE HAVE IN THERE A ONE THAT THAT HAVE TO GET UP 
TWO TWO TWO TWO TWO 
SO TWO YEAH 
THE AVERAGE IS A TWO 
THAT IS QUITE GOOD 
IN MY OPINION 
THAT 
OH 
TOP 
OKAY 
YES 
NO IT'S TWO 
THE AVERAGE IS TWO 
YEAH I UH UH I UH SAVED IT 
OF FIFTY FIVE EUROS 
NO 
YEAH MM YEAH MAYBE 
THE MICROPHONE 
YEAH 
MAYBE YOU'RE GOING SCRAP SCRAP IT 
NO PROB 
OH 
COUNT IT 
LI LIKE WRITE IT BE 
OH OKAY COOL 
HUH 
YEAH 
UH Y YEAH YOU DESIGN IT 
UM 
YEAH 
SOLAR CELL 
NO IT TOOK A BATTERY 
YEAH 
WE HAVE 
NO WE HAVE SAMPLE SPEAKER 
BUT B AL BUT WE ALSO HAVE SAMPLE SPEAKER DO 
UH WE ALREADY ON NINE 
WE HAVE DOUBLE CURVED 
SINGLE 
THIS ONE IS 
THIS ONE IS CURVED LIKE THIS RIGHT 
IT'S CURVED LIKE THIS 
YEAH BU WHAT 
UH BUT WE HAVE CURVES LIKE IT AND IT 
THERE ARE TWO CURVES RIGHT 
OH OKAY I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND 
RUBBER 
PUSH BUTTON 
NO WE DON'T HAVE PUSH BUTTON 
L. C. D. DISPLAY 
EIGHTEEN AND A HALF DAMN 
WE HAVE TO LOWER IT WITH SIX POINTS 
TWELVE AND HALF 
WE COULD USE 
I THINK WE SHOULD SCRAP THE SAMPLE SPEAKER 
IT'S FOUR PRI IT FOR NOTES 
BUT WE D WHA 
CURVED THEN IT WILL BE SQUARE 
WAS THAT DOES THAT MEAN IT IT SINGLE CURVE 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT TH THAT THAT ONLY USE ONE 
NO NO 
SO WE DON'T YEAH WE ALSO HAVE TO

SCRAP SAMPLE SPEAKER 
THAT THAT'S UH 
YES FOUR POINTS 
YEAH BUT WHAT WHAT ELSE WHAT ELSE UH DO YOU WANT TO SCRAP 
IF YOU HAVE TO WE HAVE TO SCRAP FOUR POINTS 
UM MAKE IT WITH WOOD INSTEAD OF RUBBER 
YEAH IT IT I YEAH IT ALSO UH IT ALSO TAKES ONE POINT LESS 
YEAH 
I THINK IT IS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SAMPLE SPEAKER 
YEAH OKAY THERE 
POINT THREE 
HUH 
POINT TWELVE 
THAT'S A SCROLL WHEEL 
YEAH BUT A WOOD WE CAN MAKE IT BROWN DARK BROWN NOT WOOD 
SO IT ALSO IN THAT THAT'S JUST NORMAL COLOUR FRUIT COLOURS 
NORMAL COLOURS YELLOW 
YEAH BUT THEN I D I DON'T THINK WE CAN EVER MAKE IT A TWELVE AND HALF

TRUE TRUE 
WE HAVE TWO POINTS SPARE 
NO NO POINT 
MM YEP 
YOU YOU THE SCROLL WHEEL IS DROPPED 
YEP 
TOP 
IT SHOULD'VE WORK 
YEP 
JUST TAP SOMEWHERE 
NO 
EVALUATION DROPS 
AND REUSE THE MIC 
LOOKS LIKE A IPOD 
OH

YEAH 
FAT DOCUMENT THIS 
TEAM WORK WAS OKAY 
ONLY THING THAT WE WORKED THROUGH PAST EACH OTHER

SOMETIMES IN IN IN IN THE BEGINNING I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT TO DO 
YEAH LIKE I WITH WITH THE REMOTE AND I NEVER NOW WE HAVE TO WE HAD TO UH YEAH MADE A MADE A REC A REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH SO 
SO YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
FASTER 
YEAH 
YEAH IT ONLY COSTS FOUR UNITS 
OH YEAH 
UM 
YEAH 
NOTHING 
I THINK WE GET IT ALREADY 
YEAH 
AND FURTHERMORE THE THE THE NETWORK WAS OKAY 
EVERYTHING YOU LOADED WAS ALSO

UH I SORT OF PREPARED THIS 
UH OPENING ACQUAINTANCE TOOL TRAINING UH HOW TO USE THE THINGS HERE 
UH PROJECT PLAN DISCUSSION AND YEAH THEN THE REST OF THE MEETING 
UM WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DEVELOP A NEW REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S BOTH ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY 
SO HOPE YOU HAVE GOOD IDEAS 
I DON'T 
UM WE'RE WORK WE'RE WORKING UH FROM TOP TO BOTTOM 
UH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THEN WE DO SOME AN INDIVIDUAL WORK THEN WE HAVE A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS ETCETERA ETCETERA 
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE SHOULD HAVE A PROTOTYPE DRAWN UP 
UH WE HAVE AVAILABLE THE SMART BOARD AND THE WHITEBOARD 
UM 
UH WE SHOULD TAKE SOME PRACTICE 
I HAVE SOME INSTRUCTIONS NOW TO DO THAT 
UH WELL YOU KNOW HOW TO THE DOCUMENTS WORK 
SO 
UH THIS FOR TOOLBAR 
YOU USE IT NEXT 
UM 
WE HAVE A PEN 
AND WE CAN USE THIS OPEN TO PERFORM 
YES 
SO 
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK 
YES 
OKAY SO YOU CAN 
DRAW 
OKAY AND IN THE FORMAT MENU YOU CAN SELECT COLOUR AND LINE WIDTH ETCETERA ETCETERA 
OKAY 
OH 
OKAY 
EACH OF YOU CAN UH TAKE SOME PRACTICE AND YOU SHOULD DRAW AN ANIMAL 
UH YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN 
UH WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS AND WITH DIFFERENT PEN WIDTHS 
AND YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU DRAW THAT PARTICULAR ANIMAL 
SO JULIAN 
UH WITH THE FORMAT MENU 
AND IS DIFFERENT COLOURS ETCETERA 
AND WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO BE 
OH YEAH 
OH YEAH FOUR LEGS 
UH-HUH

UH COULD YOU PRESS THE NEXT UH 
OKAY 
THEN UH 
YEAH SORRY INTRODUCTION AND GET ACQUAINTED AND 
THAT'S THE IDEA IS 
YEAH IT'S A BIT SLOW SO 
YEAH 
PRESSURE 
WHY A TURTLE 
IT'S SLOW 
YOU WERE SLOW TO USE 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH NOT EXACTLY LEGS BUT 
MORE LIKE FINS OR 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S L LOOKS VERY FRIENDLY 
YEAH OKAY 
NO 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
THERE'S A A GUM GUM TO 
HE SAID IT WAS SLOW

UM WE CAN SELL THEM TO TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
OH 
THE UM SO TO REACH UH UH TO SELL AS MUCH IS FIFTY MILLION EUROS 
OH THAT'S QUITE A BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY 
AND THE PRODUCTION COST SHOULD BE THE HALF OF THE SELLING PRICE 
OKAY NOW IT'S TIME FOR SOME DISCUSSION 
OH 
YEAH 
WE SHOULD GET STARTED 
UH I'M TAKING NOTES 
UM 
WE EACH HAVE A SPECIFIC TASK IS I SAW IN MY EMAIL 
I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU RECEIVED THE SAME EMAIL 
YEAH 
OKAY SO THE UM UH THIS INDUSTRATI INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SHOULD PRODUCE A WORKING DESIGN 
UM I CORRECT 
OKAY 
UH THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER SHOULD SPECIFY THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
AND THE MARKETING UH EXPERT SHOULD COME UP WITH USER REQUIREMENTS 
UH ADD ANY OF YOU ALREADY DO SOME WORK ON THIS PART OR 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ABOUT THE PRODUCT UH AS FAR 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH I GOT ANOTHER POINT 
IT USES INFRARED LIGHT TO COMMUNICATE THE SIGNAL TO THE T. V. APPARATUS OR STEREO 
SOME I BELIEVE

YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
I THINK 
WE CAN GO AHEAD WITH WHAT WE HAVE 
I WILL SUMMARISE THE THINGS WE DISCUSSED AND PUT IT IN THE PROJECT FOLDER 
UH THE EASE OF THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER CAN WORK ON THE WORKING DESIGN ETCETERA ETCETERA 
AND IT SEEMS YOU GET MORE INFORMATION BY EMAIL 
SO THAT WAS IT FOR ME 
OH 
YEAH IN THE PROJECT FOLDER 
YEAH 
I'M WRITING VERY FAST 
HOPE IT'S READABLE

YEAH 
BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE A 
YEAH 
YOU YOU DO SOME INDIVIDUAL WORK WE HAVE MEETING INDIVIDUAL WORK MEETING 
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE A FINAL MEETING 
AND THEN I HAVE TO PREPARE UH I HAVE TO DEFEND OUR DESIGN SO MAKE IT GOOD 
I DEPEND ON YOU 
YEAH 
IF YOU CAN MIX IT IT'S OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK THAT IS THE USER 
REQUIREMENTS PART 
SO IT WHAT THEY WANT

MM-HMM 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND 
YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD A FEW 
YEAH 
HMM THE C. D. PLAYER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YOU NEED ADDITIONAL YEAH 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE COULD JUST START WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT'S ONLY FOR T. V. AND VIDEO 
AND UM RESERVE THE POSSIBILITY TO ADD OTHER FEATURES 
SO WE HAVE A BASIC STARTING POINT AND YOU CAN ALWAYS EXTEND THAT IS MAKE SURE IT'S EXTENDIBLE 
YEAH 
THE THE LAST MINUTE OF FUNCTIONS POSSIBLE SO IT'S EASIER TO GET TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS ETCETERA 
YEAH 
OKAY AND UH I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN UH WHEN THE COMPUTER TELLS US TO 
YEAH YOU'RE DI DISMISSED 
NOT YET 
OKAY 
LET'S SEE WHAT WE GET TO DO

I'M AFRAID I'M A BIT TOO SLOW 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH PREPARATION YOU GUYS DID BUT NOT A LOT 
MM-HMM 
NOT YET 
OPERATIONS 
DIFFERENT PEN WIDTHS HOW DO YOU DO THAT 
OH OKAY 
OR YOU SIRS 
I IN THE FILE OPTION MENU 
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE TO DRAW ANYWAY 
'CAUSE I CAN TAKE FOREVER ON THIS 
SO THIS PART OF OR A ACQUAI OR INTRODUCTION TO EACH OTHER 
ALRIGHT 
OH 
YOUR LINE BREAK 
I'M GUESSING A TURTLE 
NO 
I'M KIDDING 
BECAUSE OF ITS SHELL 
DUDE YOU'RE A GOOD DRAWER 
DO YOU HAVE A TURTLE PET

SO WE HAVE TO USE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I GUESS SO 
YEAH 
TRUE 
WELL I STARTED MAKING AN OVERVIEW FOR MYSELF UM WHAT I HAD TO DO 
'CAUSE WE HAVE OTHER DESIGN STEPS AND ON EVERY STEP I HAVE A S SPECIFIC TASK TO PERFORM OR WHATEVER 
SO I HAD TO UH I DUNNO MAKE AN OVERVIEW FOR MYSELF ABOUT WHAT I HAVE TO DO 
AND KIND OF LET IT WORK ON TO GET IDEAS ABOUT 
WELL HOW I HAVE TO FILL OUT 
WELL I STARTED I STARTED WITH THE FIRST PHASE I THINK WAS THE FUNCTIONAL 
AND UH LET'S SEE I HAD TO FOCUS ON THE WORKING DESIGN WHICH YOU SAID 
HOW DOES THE APPARATUS WORK 
AND WELL I BASICALLY HAD TWO POINTS 
UH ACCORDING TO THE COFFEE UH MACHINE EXAMPLE I HAVE BATTERIES TO SUPPLY ENERGY 
AND W YOU USE BUTTON PRESSES TO ACTIVATE OR DEACTIVATE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS ON THE T. V. 
AND THAT'S BASICALLY ALL I HAVE AS FAR 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I KEPT IT GLOBAL 'CAUSE THAT IT ACTIVATES OR DEACTIVATES SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS 'CAUSE I WASN'T THINKING YET BUT THAT 
I MEAN YOU WANNA CH CH FLIP THE CHANNEL BUT YOU MIGHT WANNA USE TELETEXT ALSO 
I DUNNO WHAT THE WORD IS IN ENGLISH 
OH 
YEAH 
OBVIOUSLY 
WOAH

ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
WELL NO I'M JUST A BIT WONDERING WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THE NEXT UH 
SESSION 
YEAH OKAY 
WE'LL DO OUR BEST 
I AM GONNA WORK ON THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN ALREADY 'CAUSE YEAH IT'S FAIRLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF COMPONENTS WE WANT TO PUT IN 
DO WE I MEAN IS IT GONNA BE A MULTIMEDIA CONTROL CENTRE 
DO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE THE VIDEO RECORDER WITH IT 
YEAH 
TRUE 
BUT BUT WE NEED GOOD COMMUNICATION ABOUT THIS STUFF 'CAUSE I HAVE TO F PUT THE COMPONENTS ONTO THE DESIGN 
SO IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT COMPONENTS TO PUT IN IT'S KIND OF HARD 
YEAH SO 
OKAY 
YEAH I I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT YOU'LL NE NEED SEVERAL OTHER BUTTONS FOR A VIDEO PLAYER 
YOU NEED A PLAY AND A FORW FAST FORWARD AND A STOP FUNCTION 
AND YOU YOU DON'T NEED THAT FOR A T. V. 
AND AND FOR A T UH TELETEXT YOU NEED ADDITIONAL BUTTONS AS WELL SO I KIND OF NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE UH AND 
WHATEVER I'LL JUST PUT MY IDEAS IN UH 
AN HOUR AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS IT WITH THE NEXT UH 
MEETING 
OKAY 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
I UNDERSTAND

WIRELESS UH-HUH 
UH IT'S UH SOME BUTTONS FOR FOR THE ON OFF FUNCTION 
YOU DO YOU ALREADY TOLD THAT 
AND FOR THE CHANGING UP TO THE AT ALL THE CHANNELS AND CHANGING THE VOLUME 
THAT ARE THE THE BASIC OPTIONS FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
I GOT SOME UH REQUIREMENTS IT HAS UH IT HAS TO BE USER FRIENDLY 
OH REALLY EASY TO USE BUTTONS NOT NOT UH VERY SMALL BUTTONS BUT NOT THE THE ALSO THE BIG BIG BUTTONS BUT JUST NORMAL BUTTONS 
IT HAS TO BE A SMALL UNIT 
IT HAS TO BE UH YEAH YOU CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU UH EVERYWHERE IN IN YOUR HOUSE 
SO IT HAS AN HAS NOT TO BE LI YEAH GIGANTIC UH MACHINE 
UH AND A AND A GOOD UH ZAPPING RANGE 
UH THE DISTANCE UH FROM YOUR TELEVISION TO YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO BE UH YEAH UM YEAH QUITE A BIG DISTANCE 
IT HAS TO BE CAPABLE FOR ZAPPING UH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OR YOU GOING TO PUT THE THE NOTES ON THE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
DO WE ONLY HAVE TO TO DO UH PHASE IN THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UH 
AFTER THAT WE ARE GOING TO THE CONCEPTUAL UH 
OKAY 
I WOULD FIRST UM 
YEAH 
I I THINK WE HAVE FIRST TO START WITH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS AND WE CAN UH EXPAND THEM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH IT IT HAS YEAH IT HAS TO BE USER FRIENDLY 
SO IT'S HASN'T IT'S YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
CAN WE LEAVE NOW OR

'KAY 
DON'T TAKE UP TOO MUCH SPACE 
SHOULD TO BE ONE 
GIRAFFE'S YELLOW 
CAN YOU USE ONE BLANK SHEET PER DRAWING 
OR SO YOU YOU MUST SAVE IT AT THE END AND THEN 
OKAY THEN UM MAKE A NEW ONE 
IT'S MORE LIKE A DINOSAUR 
OH 
SOME LEAF TO IT

OKAY 
GREAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S VERY COMMON 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH WELL FROM A MARKETING UH PERSPECTIVE UM WELL THE FUNCTION DES DESIGN PHASE UH CONSISTS OUT OF THE USER REQUIREMENTS 
UM WHAT NEEDS AND DESIRES ARE TO BE FULFILLED 
SO THERE ARE A FEW MENUS TO REACH THAT UM BY BY DOING RESEARCH UH TO SEE WHAT EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE THERE IT IN THE MARKET 
I MEAN WHAT FUNCTIONS DO THEY HAVE 
UM ESPECIALLY WHAT ARE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS 
ARE THERE ANY NEW FUNCTIONS UH WHICH CAN BE ADDED TO OUR PRODUCT 
UM THEREFORE WE HAVE TO TO DO SOME INTERNET SEARCH 
FOR EXAMPLE FOR UM WELL WHAT KIND OF APPLICATIONS DO CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS SUPPORT AND WHAT ARE F FEATUR FEATURES OF UH CURRENT AND FUTURE TELEVISIONS 
SO WE CAN USE UH WHAT NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED 
UM AND WE CAN INTERVIEW CURRENT USERS AND FUTURE USERS 
WHAT WE WHAT WOULD THEY LIKE TO USE UH IN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
UM ESPECIALLY FOR FUTURE USERS UH I'M THINKING OF EARLY ADOPTERS BECAUSE THEY THEY USE NEW TECHNOLOGY FIRST 
AND THEY PLAY WITH A LOT OF TOOLS AND STUFF SO MAYBE THEY HAVE SOME GOOD IDEAS TO UH TO ADD 
I THINK I CAN GET THAT INFORMATION YEAH 
SO YEAH 
NO NO NOT SPECIFICALLY 
MORE TO HOW TO GET THEM AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH

REQUIREMENTS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NOT 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL I I WAS 
YEAH WELL LIKE LI LI LIKE SOME LIKE SOME SOME REMOTES WHO ARE OUT THERE 
WHICH I KNOW THERE'S ONE BUTTON WHICH IS VERY EASY TO SWITCH BETWEEN DEVICES 
SO YOU CAN SWITCH TO YOUR VIDEO AND THEN THE SAME BUTTONS CONTROL YOUR VIDEO 
AND ANOTHER FUNCTION I'LL THINK OF SWITCH TO YOUR MEDIA CENTRE BECAUSE THAT'S GETTING VERY POPULAR 
AND THEN USE YOUR WINDOWS MEDIA CENTRE UNDER YOUR T. V. WITH THE SAME REMOTE CONTROL 
SO WITH THE SWITCH ON SINGLE SWITCH 
SO 
YEAH RECORDS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IN THE PROJECT UH 
YEAH 
YEAH

YES 
HALF AN HOUR

UH BELOW I BELIEVE 
YEAH BELOW FORTY 
MM-HMM 
OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS ARE IN THE AGE GROUP FORTY PLUS 
AND THE NEW PRODUCT SHOULD REACH NEW MARKETS WHICH IS THE CUSTOMERS BELOW FORTY 
THAT'S IN A NEWSFLASH 
YEAH 
BUT IT ALSO NEEDS TO HAVE CORPORATE IDENTITY 
PRESENT AND THE COLOURS 
SO WE CAN'T CHANGE MUCH OF THAT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM

OH 
'KAY 
UM FOR THIS THAT DIDN'T SEE YET UM THE BASIC NEW REQUIREMENTS OF THE MANAGEMENT WERE NO TELETEXT ONLY FOR T. V. 
UH IT SHOULD BE DESIGNED FOR A S G UH GROUP BELOW FORTY 
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S W WRONG IF WE CAN UH TARGET THE CURRENT CUSTOMER GROUP AS WELL 
AND UH THE CORPORATE IDENTITY SHOULD BE CLEAR ON THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE FUNCTIONS AND IN THE LET'S SEE WHAT WAS IT UH THE TARGET GROUP 
WE HAVE TO MAKE BE CLEAR WHAT THAT IS 
YEAH USERS 
YEAH SO I THINK IT'S EASY BUT 
YEAH IT'S BELOW FORTY SO WE CAN DECIDE WHERE IT 
OKAY 
SO BELOW FORTY SO OKAY 
BUT WE NEED AN LOWER LEVEL WHICH IT IS UH FOCUS 
SO SO IT FROM SIXTEEN TO FORTY 
SO IT FROM TWENTY TO FORTY 
SO IT FROM THIRTY 
YEAH 
'KAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM

YEAH WE GET THE 
THE REMOTE YEAH 
BASIC 
SO ON TOP 
WHICH SHOULD BE EASY EASILY REACHED WITH THE THUMB 
IT I SEE SHOULD SAID RIGHT 
BECAUSE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
DO THE ALSO WITH THE THUMB 
SO IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT LONGER SO THAT YOU CAN PUT YOUR UH THUMB ALSO REACH THE MIDDLE 
OR YOU SHOULD SCREEN AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN YOU CAN USE IT VERY CLEARLY

YEAH 
THIS WOULD BE UH 
NO THAT'S NOT SO USER IS UH WE NEED A DISPLAY 
YEAH 
YEAH THEY'RE USED TO IT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT THEN IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU COVER IT WITH YOUR HAND SO 
I THINK THAT TOP IS THE BEST OPTION 
YEAH OKAY 
DEPENDS ON THE SENSITIVITY OF THE MICROPHONE BUT I THINK THAT'S OKAY 
VOLUME 
UP 
CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AND THE CONTROL OF THE ADVANCED OPTIONS 
SO MAYBE IT WE SHOULD DECIDE WHAT ADVANCED OPTIONS WE WANT TO PUT IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH SO SOUNDS 
YEAH AND THEY'RE 
THEY'RE NOT USED OFTEN SO 
YEAH JUST 
YEAH SOUNDS 
YEAH 
OF COURSE 
I'M JUST A SECRETARY 
COFFEE 
TREBLE BASS 
OH 
PITCH I BELIEVE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND MONO STEREO 
MM 
AND ALSO THE TUNING PART 
YEAH PROGRAMMING 
SO CHANNEL PROGRAMMING 
MM 
YEAH 
CONTRAST YEAH 
MM 
NO 
UH SO CONTRAST 
BRIGHT 
OH 
AND THE OTHERS WERE IN YOUR PRESENTATION RIGHT 
SO I CAN JUST COPY THIS 
OKAY 
IT'S EASY 
YEAH THE BUTTON OPTIONS AND THE L. C. D. OPTIONS 
INDEED 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU HAVE BASICALLY A BUTTON MENU WHICH YOU CAN USE DIRECTLY UH ACCORDING TO THE OLD PRINCIPLE 
AND THE L. C. D. OPTIONS ARE ACTIVATED BY SOME SOME SOFTWARE OPTIONS THATS COMMUNICATES WITH THE INFRARED UH DECODER YEAH 
SO YOU 
YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL PROCESSOR AND AND SOFTWARE PART 
COMPARED TO O 
MM-HMM 
L. IS 
YEAH 
COLOUR 
YEAH I I CALL IT CONTRAST 
YEAH I MAKE IT C COLOUR 
YEAH 
YEAH AND AUTOMATICALLY UM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH SO I'VE G CHANNEL PROGRAM IS TASK 
UH NAME A CHANNEL OR 
UH THEY GET AUTOMATIC NAMES OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT CAN YOU ALSO SAY I WANT F UH VERONICA ON THE CHANNEL NUMBER UH FIVE EURO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HOW DO YOU CALL THAT 
CHANNELS 
YEAH 
NINETY NINE OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
S SWAP CHANNELS 
CAN I CALL IT THAT 
SWAP'S GOOD OPTION 
OKAY 
UH OTHER FUNCTIONS 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
WELL THAT'S 'S UP TO UH MISTER USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
ALSO 
THAT'S YOU'RE 
YEAH BUT ALSO WHICH BUTTONS YOU HAVE TO PRESS TO GET A CERTAIN RESULT 
AND THE WORKING DESIGN WAS TO SPECIFY HOW PH THE PHYSICAL INTERATION BETWEEN THE COMPONENTS WAS SO I BELIEVE 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
BUT I THINK THE COMMUNICATION WITH THE TELEVISION SO DIFFICULT 
BUT THAT'S NOT OUR PART 
WE DON'T HAVE TO DESIGN A PROTOCOL SO 
NO THAT'S THE 
YEAH 
SO BUT 
UM 
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER CAN DESIGN A MENU 
FOR ALL THESE FUNCTION I PUT THEM IN THE 
YEAH 
YEAH I CAN 
I'LL JUST TRY TO REORGANISE UH THINGS 
UM 
SO YOU DESIGN THE BASIC FUNCTION MENU FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
UH UM 
I THINK TH I THINK THE YEAH THE LAYOUT OF THE SCREEN AND I THINK YOU CAN CONCENTRATE MORE ON THE BUTTON PLACEMENT AND THE PLACEMENT OF THE UH SCREEN ITSELF IN THE 
NO I D I THINK THAT'S MORE ON 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO HE'S LAYOUT AND YOU'RE FUNCTION 
FROM FUNCTION OKAY 
YEAH 
I THINK I THAT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT YES BECAUSE WE UH ALREADY KNOWS WHAT 
YEAH 
BUT WE'RE NOT ALLOWED 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND ALSO MAKE CLEAR WHICH BUTTONS TO PRESS TO GET CERTAIN RESULT BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS THE DIFFICULTY 
EVERY DEVICE HAS ITS OWN 
MENU OKAY 
YEAH 
MM 
BACK 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THEY'RE INCORPORATED 
UP AND DOWN SO 
SMART 
PUT IT ON TOP 
MM-HMM 
WELL 
BUT THAT'S UH J JURGEN'S DEPARTMENT 
YOU JUST MAKE THE LAYOUT 
YOU DO WE DO THE EXTRA TWO BUTTONS ARE NOT 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
THAT'S TRUE 
AND IT OKAY AND BACK ALSO 
AND OF COURSE THE FOUR ARROWS 
BUT THOSE ARE STILL Y DOUBLY USED 
BOTH THE L. C. D. 
YEAH 
MENU BUTTON ACCESS THE MENU ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YOU CAN NAVIGATE 
BUT YOU CAN ALSO NAVIGATE THE CHANNELS 
AND THE VOLUME 
THESE ARE BOTH BOTH YEAH 
OH FIVE MINUTES 
LIGHT UH 
YEAH SURE 
OKAY 
UM 
ANYTHING ELSE 
I'VE 
VOLUME 
WELL WE HAVE THESE BUTTONS 
WE USE ALL FOUR 
YEAH OKAY GO AHEAD 
YEAH THAT WAS ALREADY DECIDED 
OKAY THAT'S WHAT WE DECIDED EARLIER ON 
RIGHT OKAY 
SO YEAH I WANNA CLOSE DOWN 
I HAVE TO SORRY 
IT'S NOT BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE YOU BUT YEAH WE HAVE LUNCH BREAK AND THEN WE CAN WORK FOR THIRTY MINUTES 
AND I HAVE TO WRITE VERY FAST TO MAKE THE MINICH MIN MINUTES 
AND THEN UH WE'LL SEE 
I DON'T KNOW 
NOBODY TOLD ME 
NO I TH BELIEVE THERE'S FIRST LUNCH BREAK 
YEAH 
OR YOU CAN JUST 
YEAH 
'KAY 
I THINK YOU CAN PUT UH THE LAPTOP BACK IN THE ROOM AND 
'KAY 
YEAH IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE 
THAT'S OKAY 
OH YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WORKS BUT IT SHOULD BE SAVED 
YEAH 
IT'S UH 
SHOULD BE HERE 
SMART BOARD 
DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN USE IT BUT 
YEAH 
I TRY TO ORGANISE IT BY THESE THREE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
I DON'T REALLY MIND 
I JUST PUT THE MINUTES HERE AND WE'LL SEE 
YEAH THAT'S IN THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UH FOLDER 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S JUST BASICALLY WHAT I JUST SHOWED 
YEAH 
YEAH I GOT TO BUY YEAH 
I'M GONNA GET KICKED IF I DON'T DO IT IS 
MAKE ME PROUD 
YEAH 
I BELIEVE SO 
JUST ASK 
IT'S 
I DON'T KNOW 
I DIDN'T USE IT YET I THINK 
HEY WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY COMPUTER 
HUH 
WHAT THE 
NOT REALLY 
SORRY 
OKAY 
WHERE DO I FOUND THIS 
I'M NOT SO G DISPLAY HUH 
APPEARANCE 
NO WHAT WAS IT BUT 
YEAH MY COMPUTER IS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY 
YEAH YEAH 
NO BUT MY SCREEN IS REDUCED IN SIZE 
YEAH 
FEEDBACK 
OKAY 
THIS IS DREADFUL 
NO NOT THIS BUT THE TASK 
YEAH 
NO THAT'S OKAY 
NO I JUST FLAPPED IT CLOSED IT TAKE IT HERE AND THEN THIS HAPPENED 
OH 
UH WHERE WAS IT 
NO SETTINGS 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
THANK YOU 
DO YOU GUYS LIKE YOUR TASKS 
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT I WAS GONNA DO AND THEN A COUPLE OF MINUTES BEFORE THIS I GOT MY FUNCTION YOU KNOW THE INFORMATION THAT I NEED 
SO FRUSTRATING 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH EXACTLY 
THIS PRESENTATION IS MAINLY BASED ON MY OWN IDEAS 'CAUSE I HADN'T TIME TO INTERGRATE THA THE INFORMATION YET SO 
REALLY ANNOYING 
YEAH 
TS 
SO THEY DO NEED TO BE IN THE 
ALRIGHT 
BY THE WAY MY T. V. DOESN'T HAVE AN EQU EQUALISER BUT OKAY 
NO 
ALRIGHT 
BY THE WAY WHERE DID YOU GUYS GET THAT NEWSFLASH FROM 
I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING 
ALRIGHT 
DO WE HAVE UH YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
IT'S TH THAT'S THE SELF DESTRUCT BUTTON 
ALRIGHT 
MM-HMM 
AND WE DO HAVE TO INTEGRATE THE SCREEN AND THE THE SPEECH ALRIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
UH LIKE 
WE HAVE YOUR UH UH NEVER MIND 
OKAY 
WELL MY PRESENTATION IS A BIT UH SUCKY 
YEAH A LITTLE BIT 
OH NO 
NO NO 
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD BE IT THEN 
I HAVE AN IDEA 
THAT WE 
LET ME CHECK 
I KNOW 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT HOW DO I UH SKIP PAGES 
THE KEYS YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
UM YEAH WELL I WAS WORKING ON THIS BEFORE I GOT MY INFORMATION 
SO I WAS JUST WORKING OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND USING MY COLIN COMMON KNOWLEDGE ABOUT UH REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND WELL THE INFO ON THE WEBSITE WHICH CAME TOO LATE 
UM SO I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONS WE HAD TO PUT INTO IT YET 
SO UH UH THIS IS BASICALLY AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED IN OUR LAST UH MEETING 
THESE WERE MY UH STARTING POINTS 
UH I WAS WORKING ON A S YEAH IN A SCHEDULE AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO IT LIKE THIS 
BUT UM YEAH THEN UH THE INFORMATION CAME AND IT WAS KIND OF EXACT WITH ALL THE STEPS IN THE REMOTE CONTROL THAT I HAD TO FOLLOW 
SO I WAS TRYING TO ORGANISE THEM FOR MYSELF 
AND THEN MAKE THE THE DESIGN A THE ACTUAL DESIGN BUT I NEVER CAME AROUND TO DO THAT 
SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY ABOUT IT 
I MEAN EVERYTHING SPEAKS FOR ITSELF I GUESS 
MEAN YOU PRESS A BUTTON UM THE IT TRU GOES IT SENDS A SIGNAL TO A CHIP WHICH UH TRANSLATES IT INTO INFRARED SIGNAL OF CERTIN SPATIAL FREQUENCIES 
AND UH OR TEMPORAL FR FREQUENCIES ACTUALLY 
AND THEN UH THROUGH A UH TRANSFORMER 
AT THE SIGNAL GETS BOOSTED AND THEN SENT TO THE AT THE RECEIVER ON THE T. V. AND THE T. V. WILL TRANSLATE TO NOT A FUNCTION 
UM 
YEAH WELL THIS WAS 
ACTUALLY ALL I GET AROUND TO DO 
I MEAN I DUNNO IF I'M TOO SLOW FOR THIS STUFF BUT UH 
YEAH 
WHATEVER 
YEAH SO WHAT WE MIGHT WANNA DO IS UH YEAH CUST I HAVE CUSTOMISED THE SCREEN FUNCTIONS OF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
THE UH YOUNGER USERS ARE MORE ACQUAINTED WITH THIS KIND OF MACHINES SO THEY CAN USE MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS 
BUT MAYBE ELDERLY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AS WELL SO THEY NEED A SIMPLER REMOTE 
AND YEAH THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT THE DESIGN DISPLAYS OR WH WHATEVER 
YEAH 
EXPERIENCED YEAH 
THE REMOTE 
RIGHT TOP 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
AND MIGHT BE EASIER HUH 
YEAH I 
YEAH EXACTLY 
I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS IS REALLY YOUR DEPARTMENT THAT WE NEED JUST THE FUNCTIONAL DISPLAY AND FOUR CURSORS 
AND 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WHY DID WE WANNA PUT THE DISPLAY ON THE BOTTOM 
OKAY 
BECAUSE YEAH IF YOU USE THE FUNCTIONS YOUR HAND WILL BLOCK THE DISPLAY 
NORMAL FOR LOGICAL T 
YEAH 
NO ONCE IT'S NO IT'S ONE 
YOU DON'T NEED THE POWER BUTTON 
YEAH 
MAYBE IN THE TOP OR EVEN IN THE SIDE 
TRUE 
BUT IF YOU UH IF YOU HOLD THE UM THE REMOTE LIKE THIS IF YOU PUT IT IN THE TOP ON THE SIDE I DUNNO 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK 
NEVER MIND 
CAN WE LEAVE THIS UP TO YOU 
YEAH SO WE WE NEEDED TO INTEGRATE THE SOUND AND UH 
AND IMAGE OPTIONS RIGHT 
LIKE UH BASS UH SO WE NEED KIND OF AN EQUALISER 
IF YOU 
YEAH TREBLE MIDDL MIDDLE BASS OR SOMETHING 
UH SO 
YES PLEASE 
THE MONO STEREO OPTION 
AND THERE THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE ALSO 
AND THEN PITCH 
THE FOUR YEAH THE FREQUENCY OF THE TONES YEAH 
YEAH ISN'T THAT THAT DEPENDS ON THE ON THE SIGNAL OF THE OF WHAT PROGRAM YOU'RE WATCHING 
AND YEAH IN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE 
NO ONE OF THE REMOTE UH D DO WE WANT UH THE BUTTONS TO MAKE SOUND WHEN YOU PRESS THEM 
IS A CONFIRMATION OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW 
I DUNNO 
UNDER THE A YEAH ADVANCED OPTION MENU YOU CAN PUT THESE THINGS 
YEAH 
BUT SO WE HAVE WE HAVE T. V. OPTIONS WHICH IS ALL THIS 
THE SOUND SOUND AND IMAGE 
AND YOU HAVE ONE THAT UH THE ENDED THE REMOTE CONTROL OPTIONS 
SO WE NEED TWO MENUS KIND OF THING 
UH-HUH 
ALRIGHT 
HELP 
WORKING DESIGN 
DOCH 
UH ONLY HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT HAS TO LOOK 
AND HOW 
IT IS 
YEAH OKAY 
BUT 
YOU ADD YOUR HOMEWORK 
BUT UM YEAH 
OKAY 
NO NO 
IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO ANY REMOTE 
NO 
THANK GOD 
UH ALL THE FUNCTIONAL UH ASPECTS OF THE REMOTE I THINK ARE IN MY DEPARTMENT 
I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IT HAS TO DO 
SO IF YOU WANNA YOU KNOW THE CHANGING THE CHANNELS KIND OF US THING SO I HAVE TO INTEGRATE THAT IN THE DESIGN 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD SEPARATION 
MM 
YEAH WE HAVE TO KIND OF WORK TOGETHER 
IF IF I MAKE THE THE THE YEAH THE MENU LIKE 
I HAVE TO STATE WHICH FUNCTION HAS TO BE IN THE MENU AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE 
IT'S IN A IN A WAY THAT BE AS USER FRIENDLY 
YEAH 
I THINK YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YOU WANNA SEPARATE UH 
I THINK YOU SHOULD 
IT'S EASIER 
IF YOU PUT TOO MANY FUNCTIONS IN ONE BUTTON IT GETS CONFUSING 
NO 
HEY IS IT INTERESTING FOR USERS IF WE PUT LED LIGHTS UNDER THE BUTTONS 
SO THAT IF YOU UH PRESS ON THE MAIN FUNCTION THAT ONLY THE BUTTONS THAT ARE USED FOR THE MENU ARE LIGH LI LIGHT UP 
NO 
YEAH AND THEN IT'S ALSO EASIER TO INTEGRATE SEVERAL FUNCTIONS IN ONE BUTTON 
I THINK NOT 
YEAH KEEP IT OPTIONAL 'CAUSE MAYBE YOU CAN YOU KNOW GO LEFT TO RIGHT END UP AND DOWN ON A ONE ON MINE 
THE PR THE PROBLEM WITH THE OKAY BUTTON ON THE MIDDLE SO SORRY 
SORRY UH SO UH IF YOU'RE PRESSING UP AND DOWN YOU CAN EASILY PRESS THE KEY ONCE YOU WHEN YOU'RE NOT ALREADY AT YOUR CHOICE 
YOU WANNA CLOSE DOWN HUH 
THAT'S OKAY 
ALREADY 
ALRIGHT 
HOW MU HOW LONG AS THE LUNCHBREAK 
OKAY 
MM 
THIS IS 
YEAH

OKAY 
OKAY 
UM IF YOU ALL GO STAND AROUND UH 
COMPUTER 
UM 
NO 
OKAY 
I UH HAD UH TWO EXAMPLES 
UM THIS ONE IS THE THE YEAH THE ADVANCED ONE WITH A LOT OF OPTIONS AND FUNCTIONS AND BUTTONS 
THIS THE SAY NO I THINK WE HAVE TO TO COMBINE THEM 
AND UH YEAH MERGE THE BEST FUNCTIONS OF ALL EXAMPLES 
UM BUT YEAH THE THE AGE IS UH UNDER FORTY 
SO WE 
OKAY SO SO WE HAVE THE OPTION FOR MORE FUNCTIONS 
UM YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YEAH THIS THIS ONE WE CAN REMOVE FOR KIDS 
IT'S JUST ONLY FOR ADULTS SO UH WE CAN UH S SOME ADVANCED OPTIONS 
BUT 
YEAH BUT I PREFER W W UH IS THE THE BASIC OPTIONS UH YEAH 
WE HAVE TO TO MAKE THEM VERY EASY AS FAR JUST UH ZAPPING AROUND THE CHANNELS YOU CAN JUST PUSH ONE BUTTON 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TO USE YOUR YOUR VIDEO RECORDER OR SOMETHING ELSE YOU SHOULD USE AS AN UH AN ADVANCED OPTION 
OKAY ONE DEVICE 
OKAY 
I DIDN'T SEE 
OKAY AND I ALSO UH YEAH 
W YEAH 
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT FASHIONABLE 
LIKE YOU HE SAID UH BEFORE 
OH YEAH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS 
UM YEAH ONLY USE A EXTRA FUNCTION IF THEY ARE REALLY NEEDED 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
DID I UH DID I BREAK IT 
FOR FOR THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS I THINK 
LIKE SEARCHING FOR CHANNELS AND 
YEAH 
OKAY 
THAT'S UH I'M AL I'M ALMOST FINISHED SO 
UM THE WE HAVE TO TO TO WATCH OUT FOR THE I IF WE MAKE IT F VERY FASHIONABLE TO TO THE FUNCTIONAL FUNCTIONALITY WILL GO DOWN 
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE UH A COMPROMISE BETWEEN FUNCTIONALITY AND FASHIONAL FASHIONABLE YEAH CONTENT AND FROM 
NOW THAT THAT WAS UH WAS THE END 
YES 
YEAH 
OKAY SHOU SHOULD WE MAKE A LIST OF THE OF ALL THE FUNCTIONS WE WANT UH 
YEAH 
BUT UH IT'S IT'S ALSO FOR CHILDREN OR JUST UH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
WE WE HAVE TO 
AND IF WE HAVE A LARGER PUBLIC WE HAVE UH YEAH MORE OPTIONS TO TO UH SELL OUR PRODUCT 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHY UH I WANTED TO TO MAKE YEAH TWO UH DIFFERENT UH YEAH GROUPS OF FUNCTIONS 
THE THE SIMPLE FUNCTIONS FOR FOR THE THE WHOLE PUBLIC AND THE THE ADVANCED OPTIONS FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE YEAH WHO ARE MORE YEAH EXPERIENCED WITH UH 
NO 
I W I SHOULD UH PUT UH THE THE YEAH THE EXTRA ADVANCED OPTIONS ON THE INTO THE ONSCREEN DISPLAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
L LEFT TOP OR RIGHT UH TOP 
YEAH RIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT IF YOU ARE USING THE THE NORMAL FUNCTIONS THE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS YOU NORMALLY PRESS THEM IN THE U YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU BREAK IT 
YEAH YEAH 
AND VOLUME CONTROL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND DO WE NEED A A LOGO ON OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL OR 
IN THE LEFT UH TOP YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH MAY MAYBE BECAUSE YOU'RE 
YEAH OKAY BUT ONLY FOR THE BASIC FUNCTI IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE ADVANCED OPTION YOU'RE GOING TO PRESS THE THE MENU BUTTON AND THEN YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY TH YEAH 
THAT'S POSSIBLE 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY WE PUT IT ON TOP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IF WE 
YEAH IT IT'S JUST A REMOTE CONTROL IS 
YEAH 
TELEVISION UH ITSELF UH 
MM 
WE WE COULD MAKE AN OPTION FOR IT BUT UH YOU CAN DISABLE S 
YEAH 
BUT UH THE THE TELEVISION ITSELF HAS ALSO THE THE OPTIONS BRIGHTNESS AND UH SCREEN COLOUR ETCETERA 
SO YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
NO THAT'S 
OKAY 
IN THE UH YEAH CAN YOU I MAKE A A MAP WITH WITH ALL THE YEAH 'CAUSE IT'S NOW THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF DOCUMENTS 
AND 
THE THE LAYOUT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
ISN'T THAT MORE THE THE U UH THE USER INTERFACE PART 
YEAH 
BUT DO I HAVE TO TO UH IT YEAH TO MAKE THE THE MENU LAYOUT ALSO 
OR 
OR YOU GOING TO DO THAT 
YEAH 
I I'M GOING TO MAKE YEAH O OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
Y Y YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A LIST OF WHAT FUNCTIONS ARE UH ARE GOING TO TO BE IN THE THE SCREEN THE MENU SCREEN 
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE A A NICE MENU UH WITH WITH PAGES AND YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
W W 
UH I THINK WE HAVE TO TO GROUP TO MAKE TWO GROUPS 
UM THE ONE GROUP FOR THE FOR THE DISPLAY AND ONE GROUP FOR THE BASIC FUNCTIONS AND 
YEAH OKAY BUT WE WE HAVE A UM YEAH BUT MAYBE THAT'S THAT'S NOT UH YEAH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE Z ZAPPING UH WITH YOUR UH YEAH REMOTE CONTROL 
YOU CAN PRESS THE THE MENU BUTTON AND THEN YOU ARE SUDDENLY INTO THE THE YEAH THE DISPLAY 
YEAH 
YEAH J JUST JUST GROUP GROUP THE YEAH WE MAKE THIS THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS AND THIS THE BASIC FUNCTIONS 
SO WE MAKE A YEAH A LINE BETWEEN THEM 
IF UH YEAH 
OKAY YEAH WE SWAP UH OKAY 
YEAH 
SO WE MAKE IT A 
OKAY 
OH 
YEAH 
SO WE HAVE A A MENU BUTTON AND A S 
OKAY

WE HAVE A MENU BUTTON AND 
THAT'S THE THE ONE WITH THE YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO THAT THAT'S NOT UH YEAH THAT THESE ARE 
MULTIFUNCTIONAL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH 
SO MAYBE MAKE AN UH NO OKAY BUTTON AND AND ONE NAVIGATION BUTTON 
YEAH THE WITH WITH THE THE CHANNEL AND THE VOLUME UH YEAH UM A MULTIFUNCTIONAL NAVIGATION BUTTON 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
BUT DO WE HAVE TO WRITE UH TO WRITE DOWN UH THE OR STUFF NOW 
OUR FIRST LUNCHBREAK 
BECAUSE I 
I'VE EVERYTHING IN MY HEAD NOW IS 
OKAY 
YEAH 
'KAY 
YEAH 
YES SURE 
OH NO NO 
OKAY 
AND UH WE HAVE TO MAKE UH SOME MAPS WITH UH WITH THE ALL THE THE DATA WE UH GATHERED 
IT'S IT'S JUST MY OWN MAP SO I PUT EVERYTHING INTO THE 
BUT YOU GOT SOME EXTRA INFORMATION UH 
OKAY 
BUT WHERE DO YOU DID YOU GET THE NEWSFLASH 
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE OH OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH I I JUST SAW IT ONE MINUTE AGO 
WHEN I UH 
YEAH 
YEAH PRETTY MUCH 
MM 
YEAH THAT'S MY PRESENTATION 
MM 
OH RIGHT 
OH 
WELL 
ALRIGHT 
HUH 
YOU READ THE NEWSFLASH 
HMM 
WHAT 
HMM 
ALT DELETE 
SO IT DOESN'T DRAW THE ATTENTION AWAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I I HAD A WHOLE IDEA AND THEN JUST WAS TYPING IT AND THEN UH 
I HAVE TO DO THAT IS SWITCH 
MM 
BY YOUR HUMBLE P. M. 
YEAH THAT'S FINE 
WE HAVE TO START IT RIGHT AWAY 
FUNCTIONAL 
YEAH FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
ALRIGHT 
I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
UM 
WELL UH SOME RESEARCH HAS BE DONE UH HAS BEEN DONE 
UH OBSERVING OF ONE HUNDRED UH SUBJECTS IN THE USABILITY LAB USING A REMOTE CONTROL 
UH AND THEY ALSO FILLED IN A QUESTIONNAIRE 
THE FINDINGS WERE UM WELL YOU CAN USE THEM FOR YOURSELF 
THEY DISLIKED THE LOOK AND FEEL OF CURRENT REMOTES CONTROLS 
USERS THINK THEY'RE UGLY 
UM THEY DO NOT MATCH THE THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USERS 
SO THEY THEY DO THEY DON'T MATCH WHAT THEY WANT TO HAVE NO IT 
UM THEY ARE OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM 
UM IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THEY'RE BAD FOR R. S. I. 
I DON'T KNOW UH HOW A USER CAN REACH THAT BUT OKAY 
UM THERE IS ALSO UH WAS ALSO SOME RESEARCH ON UH THE MOST RELEVANT AND AND AND IRRELEVANT UH OF FUNCTIONS 
UH MOST IRRELEVANT AND LESS USED WERE AUDIO SETTINGS MONO STEREO UH PITCH BASS 
UM SCREEN SETTINGS FOR BRIGHTNESS AND COLOUR AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
UM BUT THEY ARE USED 
I MEAN THE 
YEAH THEY DO NEED TO BE IN THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
I MEAN IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE THE SOUND SETTINGS I MEAN IF YOU DISLIKE A VERY UH LOUD BASS OR SOMETHING YOU YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT 
SO UM YEAH WE HAVE TO 
WE C WE C 
YEAH I MEAN WE WE CAN'T MY MY T. V. HAS BUT WE WE CAN LEAVE THEM UH WAY 
UH MOST RELEVANT UH MOST USED FUNCTIONS UH THEY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES I GUESS 
UH POWER BUTTON UH CHANNEL VOLUME SELECTION 
UH TELETEXT BUT WE CAN SKIP THAT BECAUSE I SAW THE NEWSFLASH 
AND TELETEXT IS IS OUTDATED THAT IT IT'S I SHOULD NOT BE USED UH ANY MORE ON THE FUTURE 
SO FORGET THIS ONE 
UH CHANNEL SETTINGS SO FOR PROGRAMMING UH YOUR CHANNELS IN IN THE RIGHT ORDER 
YEAH IN IN THE PROJECT UH 
NO SO IT'S A TEXT FILE IN IN THE PROJECT FOLDER 
SO TELETEXT CAN BE SKIPPED 
UM THERE WAS SOME RESEARCH ON NEW FEATURES IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
UH ABOUT AN L. C. D. SCREEN UH AND SPEECH RECOGNITION 
WELL WE GOT AN UPDATE FOR THE FOR THE AUDIENCE 
OR THE THE THE TARGETED GROUP 
SO IT'S ABOVE FORTY I GUESS 
THE NEW PRODUCT 
OR BELOW BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY RELEVANT 
I THOUGHT I READ A 
YEAH 
BELOW 
OKAY WELL THAT'S THAT'S IN THE NEWSFLA OKAY THAT'S A GOOD TO KNOW 
UM BECAUSE YOU USE AS A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE AGE GROUPS CONCERNING THE FEATURES 
I MEAN UH ABOVE FORTY PEOPLE ARE NOT SO INTERESTED UH NOT SO INTERESTED IN A SCREEN OR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
UH BUT BELOW THAT AGE THEY UH THEY PRETTY MUCH OR 
SO I THINK WE CAN BUILD THAT ONE 
UM 
YEAH WELL WE CAN SKIP THIS PART AS WELL BECAUSE I THOUGHT I READ ABOVE FORTY SO WE COULD SKIP THE FEATURES 
BUT WE JUST HAVE TO BUILD THEM IN BECAUSE UH THEY FIND IT VERY INTERESTING 
UM WELL WE HAVE TO KEEP ALL THE CLASSIC FUNCTIONS BUT MAKE THE BUTTONS AS USER FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE 
UM AND AND ALSO THERE'S IS NOT ONLY THE DESIGN OF THE BUS UH BUTTONS BUT O HOW YOU CAN PUSH THEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
SO THE PHYSICAL UH ASPECT OF IT 
UM 
AND I THINK AND CERTAINLY FOR FOR THE FOR THE LOWER AGE GROUPS UH NICE DESIGN WHICH HE DOES NOT MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL IN YOUR ROOM 
IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY A PART OF YOUR INTERIOR OF OF YOUR DESIGN IN YOUR ROOM 
SO IT'S THE PEOPLE CAN SAY WELL WHAT'S THAT WELL THAT'S MY REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IT'S DO IT HAS TO LOOK NICE AND FEEL NICE AND AND HAVE ALL THE FUNCTIONS THAT UH 
YEAH SO THE THE LOGO HAS TO BE UH PRESENT YEAH AND THE COLOURS AS WELL 
YEAH SO BUT I I DON'T THINK THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE THING HAS TO HAVE A COLOUR ANYWAY 
AND MOST OF THE TIMES THERE IS A BRAND PRESENT ON IT 
SO I THINK THAT'S NOT GONNA GONNA AFFECT IT VERY UH VERY MUCH 
WELL THAT ARE THE THE CONSEQUENCES UH IN A MARKETING UH PART 
YES 
YEAH 
JUST YEAH 
SURE 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND AND AND MARKETING RESEARCH STATED THAT THAT THAT KIND OF USERS ARE NOT AFRAID OF OF A LOT OF FUNCTIONS 
IS NOT NOT TOO MUCH BUT YEAH 
AND THE SPEECH RECOGNITION YEAH 
YEAH FROM AGE OF SIXTEEN SO YEAH 
MM 
YEAH BUT UH THE THE NEWSFLASH ALSO STATED THAT IT SHOULD CONTROL ONLY ONE DEVICE ONLY YOUR TELEVISION 
SO WE 
SO THERE ARE NOT EXTRA OPTIONS IN THIS CASE BUT UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE SCREEN IS IS ALL THE THE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS YOU CAN PUT THAT IN THE SCREEN 
AND THE AND THE YEAH SCREEN MENU TO TO TO UH TO DO THAT AND THEN THE BASIC FUNCTION JUST IN THE DEVICE ITSELF 
SO IT LOOKS VERY SIMPLE AND ALL THE ADVANCED FEATURES ARE HIDDEN IN THE SCREEN UH WITH A CLEAR MENU 
OH 
WHAT ARE WH 
WHAT 
YEAH WELL IT YEAH IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE SCREEN 
WELL I MY GUESS SO IT'S IT'S PRETTY HANDY FOR ADVANCED UH ADVANCED FUNCTIONS 
YEAH SEARCHING FOR CHANNELS PROGRAMMING THEM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL YOU CAN IMPROVISE RIGHT 
SO WE WE CAN GO FOR 
SO WE CAN GO FOR THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE THE LEFT EXAMPLE AND THEN A SCREEN ON TOP OF IT 
YEAH 
DESIGN 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH FREQUENCY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WE WANT TO INCORPORATE AN UH NOT TOO 
MM 
GROUP OF USERS ARE BECAUSE IT SAYS BELOW FORTY I MEAN 
I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S THE TRUE YEAH UH OR EMAIL AND FEMALE 
UH SIX THE MARKETING RESEARCH STARTED ONE IS IN THE AGE OF SIXTEEN 
SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO UM 
HOW DO YOU MEAN 
UH SIXTEEN TO FORTY 
WELL I I GUESS PEOPLE OF SIXTEEN ARE ARE QUITE USED TO TECHNOLOGY 
SO THEY THEY ADAPT IT IT PRETTY SOON I GUESS 
YEAH 
BUT UH ALL INCORPORATED IN THE SCREEN OR OR JUST IN THE REMOTE ITSELF 
YEAH LIKE LIKE YOU HAVE A VISUAL OF THE OF THE BRIGHTNESS WITH WITH A KIND OF SLIDING BAR AND A BUS AND AND STUFF LIKE THAT FOR SOUND AND AND VIS AND AND VISUALS 
UH YOU CAN MAKE A IF YOU MAKE A DRAWING 
OH 
OH 
UH BLACK'S OKAY 
AND DRAW IT VERY BIG 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL THIS IS BASICALLY UH IT'S ALRIGHT THE REMOTE 
UM WELL USUALLY THE POWER BUTTON IS ON TOP I GUESS 
YEAH SO IT SHOULD FIT RIGHT IN INTO YOUR HAND 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
I MOST PEOPLE ARE RIGHT HANDED SO MAYBE LEFT HANDED SPECIAL ADDITION BUT OKAY 
IF YOU PUT IT LOOK LIKE HERE 
OR SOMETHING 
I DUNNO 
UM THEN YOU COULD PUT A SCREEN LIKE IN A MOBILE PHONE ALSO ON TOP I GUESS 
OKAY SO Y YEAH YOU HAVE YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND AND THE SCREEN IS BELOW AND THE BUTTONS ARE IN THE MIDDLE 
OKAY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PUT THE SCREEN HERE IT'S MORE ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS NOW THEN THE THEN THE LAYOUT 
DOESN'T WORK OUT WELL 
IT'S UH IT'S BENT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
OKAY YOU GET IT 
UH FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU IF YOU PUT ALL THE 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
MAYBE THIS 
KIND OF WORKS 
LIKE IF YOU HAVE 
LIKE UH TEN BUTTONS FOR FOR ALL THE FOR ALL THE CHANNELS UM AND HERE ONE FOR FOR 
YEAH THAT THAT USUALLY UH LIKE HERE HERE HERE HERE 
SO YOU HAVE UP AND DOWN FOR THE FOR THE CHANNELS AND LEFT AND RIGHT FOR THE VOLUME UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND YOU YOU HAVE MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE ONE BUTTON ON THE MIDDLE 
IT SAYS MENU 
AND THEN IF YOU PRESS IT YOU THE SCREEN GETS ACTIVATED AND THEN YOU CAN USE THESE BUTTONS TO SCROLL UP AND DOWN AND LEFT AND RIGHT TO GO INTO FUNCTON AND THEN JUST MO MOST OF THE TIME THIS MENU BUTTON IS ALSO LIKE OKAY 
IT TO CONFIRM A A KIND OF ACTION 
SO YOU SCROLL INTO IT OKAY 
YOU SELECT A FUNCTION LIKE V LIKE UH BASS 
YOU JUST ADJUST IT WITH THESE TWO BUTTONS 
THEN OKAY TO CONFIRM AND THEN UH IN IN EACH ONE EACH SCREEN THERE'S THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO GO BACK TO A IT A UPPER LEVEL 
AND THEN FINALLY SAY OKAY EXIT 
OR OR ONE BUTTON TO EXIT IT 
OH NO NO TIME I DUNNO THAT'S NOT REALLY MY DEPARTMENT 
THAT'S MORE YOUR UH YOUR DEPARTMENT TO TO UH IT 
YEAH 
BUT IT SHOULD BE OF THE SCREEN IS HERE THEN THE LOGO SHOULD BE LIKE ON ON TOP YEAH 
I MEAN IT'S UH 
YEAH 
YEAH I MEAN THE POSITION OF THE SCREEN IS ALSO MORE ESSENTIAL THAN I MEAN WE WE LIKE WHERE WE HAVE SPACE LEFT AND THEN PUT THE LOGO OVER THERE 
BUT UM 
YEAH SO IT SHOULD BE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND HERE SHOULD BE ON TOP SOMEWHERE MAYBE 
I MEAN I 
THAT'S NOT SURE BUT IT'S 
YEAH I MEAN A SCREEN ON TOP LOOKS MORE LO LOGICAL TO ME 
ALSO BECAUSE PEOPLE USE UM MOBILE PHONES AND THEY ALSO HAVE THE SCREEN ON TOP 
SO YOU YOU JUST HAVE TO REACH A LITTLE BIT FOR THE POWER BUTTON 
I MEAN IF YOU GRAB IT 
BUT MOST MOST OF THE TIMES OF A F F A T. V. 'S ON STANDBY PEOPLE JUST PRESS A CHANNEL TO PUT IT IN 
SO WE PUT THIS ON TOP AND THEN MAKE THE CORPORATE LOGO 
LIKE OVER HERE 
R. R. 
AND J AND THE MICROPHONE I MEAN IT CAN BE VERY SMALL 
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR MOBILE PHONES ARE SOME STRIPES LITTLE LITTLE HOLES 
YEAH MAYBE IN THE SIDE 
I MEAN IF THE OF THE MICROPHONE IS GOOD 
YEAH OKAY 
SO ON THE ON THE TOP IS BETTER 
YEAH 
YEAH IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT MUCH 
SO BUT UM THE SCREEN IS ON TOP 
WHICH FUNCTIONS DID WE HAVE LEFT 
I MEAN THIS IS BASICALLY NUMBERS VOLUME UH CHANNEL UP AND DOWN 
SCREEN IS OVER THERE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S UH THAT'S A GOOD ONE 
YEAH 
SOUND 
YEAH 
EQUALISER 
SO IF YOU HAVE SOUND 
BUT NOT TOO ADVANCED 
I MEAN MOST T. V. S USE ONLY TREBLE AND BASS 
YEAH 
IT'S UH PRETTY HARD TO WRITE 
MM 
OKAY BUT YOU HAVE SOUND 
YEAH JUST UH Y YOU HAVE DIGITAL UH BETTER WRITE IT DOWN OVER THERE YEAH 
SO YOU HAVE SOUND 
YEAH 
OH YEAH SOUND AND THEN WITHIN SOUND I GUESS TREBLE AND BASS 
YEAH 
ALSO 
PITCH 
YEAH 
BUT PITCH ISN'T THAT YEAH THAT'S THE THE HEIGHT OF THE TEN 
YEAH OKAY WH WHY WOULD YOU SEE THAT 
IF PEOPLE LIKE TALK LIKE UH 
YEAH 
PROGRAMMING PART 
UH SO WE HAVE SOUND YEAH 
CHANNEL PROGRAMMING 
MM 
I THINK IT G IT GETS ANNOYING 
I MEAN MOST MOBILE PHONES USED THAT IN THE BEGINNING BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SIT ON THEIR KNEES ON THEIR KNEES IN FRONT OF THEIR TELEVISION WITH ONLY THREE BUTTONS THEN IT'S VERY HARD TO Y YEAH CONTRAST AND BRIGHTNESS 
YEAH THESE ARE THE MOST USED I GUESS 
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR MONITOR 
WELL YEAH WELL I GUESS THAT THESE WERE THE ONLY ONES I GUESS 
YEAH 
I WILL LIKE IT UP 
YEAH WITH THE CHIP AND THEN I MEAN 
OH YEAH 
WELL YEAH WE HAVE POWER BUTTON WHETHER THAT'S PRESENT 
CHANNEL VOLUME SELECTION PRESENT 
UH NUMBERS PRESENT 
YEAH A AUDIO SETTINGS MONO STEREO PITCH BASS TREBLE 
SCREEN SETTINGS BRIGHTNESS AND COLOUR 
YEAH CON CONTRAST IS 
YEAH OKAY COLOUR AND BRIGHTNESS 
UM AND WHAT YOU SAY CHANNEL SETTINGS OR CHANNEL PROGRAMMING 
SO YOU YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO TO START SCANNING ALL THE FREQUENCIES AND WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS ONE WILL IT SHOWS IN YOUR T. V. 
AND THEN YOU CAN UM 
UH AND THEN YOU CAN SELECT UH A NUMBER IN YOUR REMOTE IN WHICH YOU WANT TO SAVE IT 
YEAH AUTOSEEK 
WELL MOST T. V. S AUTOMATICALLY DISPLAY THE NAME WHICH THEY GET THROUGH THE CABLE 
YEAH 
SO YOU ONLY HAVE TO CHOOSE THE POSITION ON YOUR 
IT ONLY HAS TO MATCH THE THE CHANNEL FREQUENCY ON YOUR T. V. WITH WITH THE WITH THE POSITION ON YOUR T. V. AND AND USE YOUR REMOTE 
IF YOU ALREADY PROGRAMMED IT 
IF YOU WANT TO MOVE IT 
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO 
YEAH HOW DO YOU CALL THAT 
MM 
WAIT YOU YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO BROWSE THROUGH A LIST OR SOMETHING WHICH WE DISPLAYS ALL THE ALL THE VALUES ALL THE CHANNELS WHICH ARE POSSIBLE 
I MEAN LIKE AN OUT OF THIRTY F OR NINETY OR WHATEVER 
JUST BROWSE THROUGH IT AND THEN UM IN SOME KIND OF WAY SO IF IT IF IT IF IT IS PROGRAMMED 
YEAH 
SWAP CHANNELS 
SO YOU MOST OF THE TIME IF YOU IF YOU SWAP IT 
SO UH LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE UH R. T. L. FIVE IN ONE CHANNEL FIVE 
AND VERONICA ON CHANNEL EIGHT AND YOU WANT TO MOVE VERONICA TO CHANNEL FIVE UM MOST OF THE TIMES YOU OVERRIDE THE PREVIOUS UH THE PREVIOUS ONE 
YEAH 
IT'S IT'S PRETTY UH YEAH I MEAN YOU HAVE TO LOOK ON ON THE MENU 
IN THE T. V. 
YEAH 
OR OR IS IT TOO HARD TO TO J IT JUST DO IT ALL IN YOUR REMOTE 
TO PROGRAMME THE CHANNELS 
OH 
YEAH 
NO 
THAT'S TRUE 
THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
SO WE HAVE A FIGURE A FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TO DO THAT EASILY 
I MEAN THE THE TASK IS IS NOT A PROBLEM 
I MEAN YOU UH YOU UH CURRENT CHANNEL AND THEN THEN IT JUST SAYS UH IN WHICH NUMBER DO YOU WANT TO SAVE THIS 
AND YOU JUST PRESS A NUMBER IN YOUR REMOTE AND THEN SAY CONFIRM OKAY AND THEN IT'S IT'S SAVED 
IT'S EASIER IT'S IT'S IT'S HARDER TO IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PROGRAMMED IT TO TO SWAP 
SO WE HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING FOR THAT 
YEAH K KIND OF STRUCTURE INTO LAYERS 
SO 
AND AND THE LAYOUT OF OF THE THING ITSELF 
MAYBE MORE ON 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH I GUESS SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WITH WITH SOME L WITH SOME LAYERS IN IT 
SO SOME MENUS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I GUESS THIS THIS BUTTON THE THE THE KEY MENU OKAY 
OR YOU CAN INCORPORATE TWO UH DIFFERENCE UH DIFFERENT BUTTONS 
UH LIKE UH FOR YOUR MOBILE PHONE 
UM SO THIS IS ONLY FOR TO GET IN THE MENU OR TO EXIT IT 
AND THEN ON TO CONFIRM AND ONE TO GO ONE STEP BACK 
SO IT'S LIKE THE THE SAVE BUTTON ON YOUR YOUR MOBILE PHONE IF YOU HAVE A NOKIA OR LIKE THAT 
OR THE OR THE ONE BUTTON 
TO GO ONE STEP BACK YOU IT'S ONLY TWO EXTRA BUTTONS BUT IF IT IF IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE FOR THE SCREEN 
YEAH BECAUSE THIS THIS IS USED FOR BOTH 
INTO YOUR SCREEN 
OKAY 
SO YOU L SHOULD LEAVE THE MENU BUTTON OUT OF HERE 
AND AND JUST PUT IT UNDER THE SCREEN THE SCREEN 
YEAH 
BUT WE SHOULD PLACE THE SCREEN ON TOP RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU JUST YOU JUST FIND OUT AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH OR CONFIRM AND BACK 
WHATEVER 
YEAH 
SHOULD WE SAVE THIS PICTURE OR OR YOU KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
YEAH 
THAT THAT JUST TO TO ACTIVATE THE SCREEN 
SO 
AND THEN WITH THESE BUTTONS WOA Y YOU NAVIGATE 
YEAH 
L L LITTEN UP YEAH 
THAT'S VERY GOOD IDEA 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEN IT BECOMES CLEAR WHICH BUTTONS ARE ACTIVE NOW WHICH YOU CAN SEE 
YEAH 
SO 
THESE BUTTONS ARE ARE LIT UP 
BUT JUST ONE THING 
SHOULD WE USE THESE TWO 
THEM 
OR ONLY THIS TO TO SCROLL 
AND THEN USE THE TWO FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS TO CONFIRM TO GO INTO SOMETHING 
OH NO WE HAVE TO USE THIS TO ADJUST SOME SOME BARS 
YEAH 
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD USE THIS ALSO USE AN OKAY BUTTON STILL 
AND THEN JUST ONLY A BACK BUTTON 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND ONE BACK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE HAVE TO ASK 
YES 
YEAH 
TIME PRESSURE 
YEAH WE'LL KICK YOUR ASS LATER 
NO 
OH 
YOU 
YOU YOU SAVED IT 
DOES IT SAVE AUTOMATICALLY IN THE PROJECT FOLDER 
OR 
OKAY 
WE'LL SEE 
JUST PUT BACK MY LAPTOP 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH YOU CAN OPEN IT WITH THE PICTURE PREVIEW OR STUFF LIKE THAT 
INTERNET 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH JUST TESTING 
MM 
ENGLISH 
BREAK IS OVER 
WOAH 
SPICY 
SO HE'S COMING 
OH OKAY 
OH 
SH 
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FINAL REPORT 'CAUSE I HAVE TO RECORD EVERYTHING WE ARE DECIDING AND SUCH AS I'M TRYING TO WRITE IT DOWN BETWEEN EVERYTHING ELSE 
OH 
YEAH 
HERE WE GO AGAIN 
WELCOME 
UH WE HAVE AGAIN THREE PRESENTATIONS AND THEN WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WHAT CONCEPTS THE MOBILE PHONE HAS TO UH OF THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO SUPPORT 
SO WHO WANTS GO 
YES 
YEAH SURE 
DOESN'T MATTER 
NO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH SURE 
NO 
COOL 
YEAH YOU'RE JUST THE USER INTERFACE HMM 
YEAH LAYOUT 
YEAH OKAY 
YOU PROBABLY OPENED IT 
F. FIVE 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
CALCULATOR'S CAN DO IT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UH I THINK YOU CAN ONLY FIT IN UH SOURCE OF ENERGY IN THE 
YEAH I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY INFO UH 
YEAH 
SO YEAH IT'S SAFE 
'KAY NEXT 
OH 
OKAY 
CAN WE UH 
YEAH 
WELL THE VISUAL REPRESENTATION IS NOT THERE WITH SPEECH BUT YOU CAN 
YEAH 
JUST YEAH 
I THINK YOU CAN JUST UH MATCH THE SPEECH COMMANDS WITH THE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY PRESENT 
SO I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO DESIGN ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT 
BOTH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT WOULD BE THE BACK 
BACK AND OKAY 
YOU DID READ THE MINUTES I WROTE 
YOU DID READ THE MINUTES I WROTE 
OH OKAY 'CAUSE I PRETTY MUCH SUMMED UP ALL THE BUTTONS THERE WERE 
SO 
I HATE DOING WORK FOR NOTHING 
MM-HMM 
THAT WAS IT 
OKAY 
OH 
AGAIN 
OKAY SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHAT KIND OF COMPONENTS DO WE USE 
UH ENERGY SOURCE CHIP TYPE CASE TYPE 
AND USER INTERFACE 
BUT I DIDN'T USE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THIS IS I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SO OKAY 
SO WE ONLY WE ALREADY DECIDED THAT KINETIC WOULD BE THE CHOICE FOR ENERGY 
UH THE CASE WOULD BE DOUBLY CURVED 
SO 
RUBBER MATERIAL 
AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE HAVE LEFT 
OH OKAY 
NO IT'S EASY 
ADVANCED CHIP 
OKAY 
IT 
UH I DIDN'T GET ANY INFO ON THIS 
SO 
YEAH 
I HAVE TOTAL HERE 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
I DIDN'T GET ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THAT IS 
YEAH 
WHO DOESN'T 
UH LET'S SEE 
SO THERE A NEW THING 
YEAH THE INTERFACE MAYBE CAN 
OH 
NO 
UH DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF DOUBLY CURVED CASE 
AND COULD YOU PUT THAT IN THE GROUP FOLDER 
OF THE PROJECT FOLDER 
UH YOU DIDN'T DRAW IT YOURSELF 
OH 
ARROW 
YEAH 
'S THE TARGET GROUP 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH 
OH OKAY 
I SEE 
YEAH ALSO LIKE THIS 
SO YOU CAN HOLD IT 
THE CHILDREN'S STORY 
YEAH I'VE GOT IT 
DISTINCTION 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
DIFFERENT 
MM-HMM 
CAMERA 
YEAH SUBMARINE 
WELL 
YEAH BUT THIS THIS THE S FOR THE 
OKAY 
OH 
OH YEAH BRIGHT COLOURS 
THAT'S SINGLY CURVED 
OKAY 
WELL WE COULD MAKE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THAT 
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT 
UH INSTEAD OF DOUBLY CURVED WE TAKE A SINGLE CURVED 
SO IT PEOPLE A LITTLE MORE AT THE ALL THE PUBLIC 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
ALSO 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH I'D AGREE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
DIFFERENT 
STANDS OUT 
OR 
OH YEAH A ONE HAND UH SOLUTION 
CAN TURN IT MAYBE 
TO SWITCH FORM BUTTONS TO INTERFACE HMM 
IF YOU TURN IT A LITTLE 
OH YEAH 
LEAST YOU CAN EASILY SEE IT 
IF YOU CAN UH FLIP 
UH SO YOU HAVE A THE THE SIDE VIEW 
SO AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO 
MAKE THIS 
OKAY SO THE BUTTONS ARE ON TOP HERE AND YOU FLIP IT OVER THAT WAY 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
NO NOT ALL BECAUSE YOU NEED MOST OF THEM THE ARROW BUTTONS 
BUT YOU CAN HIDE THE KEY AND THE BACK UH BUTTON 
AND THE MENU BUTTON ALSO BECAUSE WHEN YOU FLIP IT OPEN AND YOU CAN MAYBE EVEN DROP THE MENU BUTTON BECAUSE MAYBE IF YOU FLIP IT OPEN IT WILL AUTO ACTIVATE AMAUTO UH UH AUTOMATICALLY 
WHY 
YOU COULD JUST MAKE IT MECHANICAL 
IF YOU COVER IT WITH RUBBER 
MM 
YEAH 
SO IT CAN BOUNCE 
YEAH OKAY SO THAT THAT MAY WORK 
OKAY BUT THEN WE STILL HAVE THE THE THE THING OF THE THE THE SHAPE 
YEAH 
WHAT KIND OF 
HARDER 
MAYBE CAN DESIGN TWO VERSIONS 
MM-HMM 
AND ERGONOMICAL SHAPE 
YEAH 
THE FEMALE SHAPE YEAH 
WITH TWO UH 
OH YEAH 
SOME UH K ESK UH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THE KEYWORDS ARE PRIMARY CO COLOURS SPONGEY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUTTONS 
OKAY 
I THINK THAT UH IT'S A NICE DESIGN 
IT'S COOL 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S 
ORANGE OR SOMETHING 
MM 
YEAH 
HUH COOL 
NO IT'S 
YEAH IT'S TEXT 
NO NO YOU HAVE TO EXIT 
YOU COULD ALSO MAKE LINE WITH UH YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YOU 
YEAH AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT 
SOME YELLOW 
BANANA COLOUR 
YEAH IF YOU IF FLASHING COLOUR SO YOU CAN'T LOSE IT BASICALLY 
WELL I THINK IT'S A BIT TOO MUCH ABOUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WOAH 
AND THEN YOU CAN USE YELLOW OR SOMETHING 
WHY NOT 
YOU 
LIKE THIS 
COLOURBLIND YEAH 
NO SO THAT'S MOSTLY RED AND GREEN I BELIEVE 
WOAH 
ALL ALL BUTTONS 
OKAY 
IT'S DIFFICULT 
BLUE 
MAYBE GREEN 
YEAH YOU CAN 
MM-HMM FLASHY 
MM BZZ 
RED MAYBE 
BLACK 
WHY 
YEAH 
SO 
OH 
UH NOT YET 
YEAH WITHIN FIVE MINUTES YEAH 
YOU LEFT YEAH LEFT AND THEN UH I HAVE TO KICK YOU IT 
YEAH YEAH 
THEY HAVE LEDS BUT THEY HAVE A COLOUR 
YOU CAN MAKE THEM RED 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE LEDS OR JUST EXTRA LIGHT 
UH THEY THEY DON'T DETERMINE THE COLOUR THAT MUCH I THINK 
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO PRINT ON THEM YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND 
EACH NUMBER IS TRANSPARENT 
UH PARTLY BUT YOU HAVE TO PRINT ON THE NUMBER 
OR THE THE SIGN 
SO YOU CAN'T 
CHANGE THE COLOUR SO 
YEAH 
BUT OF LIGHT 
BUT OF FEEDBACK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY WITH 
OH 
DON'T MEAN TO DISCOURAGE YOU ABOUT UH BASICALLY 
YOU TWO ARE GOING TO WORK ON THE SMARTBOARD 
NEXT THIRTY MINUTES TO DESIGN SOMETHING SO 
AND THE 
YOU WILL DO THE EVALUATION 
YEAH 
YEAH UH BUT 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
YOU PROBABLY GET A MAIL 
YEAH 
ONCE THEY ARE FINISHED 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT MAYBE YOU CAN DO THE EVALUATION YOU DON'T HAVE TO EVALUATE YET BUT YOU CAN MAKE A PROCEDURE WHICH TO FOLLOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT 
YEAH 
YOU HAVE THE BASIC IDEA 
AND YOU TWO UH ARE GOING TO DO THIS 
LIKE AND FEEL AND 
YEAH 
GOOD LUCK 
SO I UH MAKE NEW PAGE AND UH BE CREATIVE 
YEAH YOU HAVE UH THIRTY MINUTES 
THEN WE HAVE TO UH IS SOMETHING WHICH WE CAN UH 
SHOW AT THE MANAGEMENT 
I WOULD YEAH 
YEAH 
NEXT 
UH AND SAVE THIS UH BOARD 
JUST SAVE IT 
YEAH OKAY BUT JUST PRESS SAVE AND UH 
IT'LL BE FINE 
YOU CAN ALSO INCLUDE CLIP ART 
SO IF YOU'LL RATHER DRAW ONE POINT OR SOMETHING 
THEN LIKE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU CAN ALSO INCLUDE IT 
IT'S NOT MUCH WORK 
THAT'S INCLUDED 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
SENSITIVE 
I DUNNO 
MAYBE JUST START TYPING 
YOU ALSO DO THE OTHER SIDES 
NOT ONLY IN THE FRONT IS UH THE TOP SIDE BUT ALSO THE THE SIDE VIEW 
OH 
JESUS 
WHAT DO I WROTE DOWN 
WHY CAN'T I WORK HERE 
THIS IS MUCH EASIER 
YEAH 
MM 
NO SO I JUST WORK HERE A FEW MINUTES 
FIVE MINUTES LEFT BEFORE THE MEETING ENDS 
YEAH WE KEEP THE FLIP 
KEEP THE FLIP LIVE 
NO FLIPPING 
IT'S SHAKING 
YEAH JUST LIGHT ON TOP 
SAFER 
MM 
YEAH OKAY THAT THE TARGET GROUP 
WELL 
I JUST UH ENDED THE MEETING 
YOU TWO GO DESIGN 
OH 
BY THE WAY 
UM 
I UH THOUGHT UP A NAME FOR OUR PRODUCT 
YEAH 
IT'S CALLED UH THE REAL REMOTE 
WITH A COPYRIGHT SIGN AFTER REAL 
SO MAYBE YOU CAN INCLUDE THAT SOMEWHERE 
YEAH 
I DON'T SEE ANY POWER CABLES HERE IS 
'KAY 
GOOD LUCK 
JUST KIDDING 
SO ANNOYING 
I JUST PUT IT IN THE ON THE SHARED FOLDER SO IT SHOULD BE YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
WHAT OR WHATEVER DOES IT 
NO NO NO CAN YOU GO BACK IN 
UH 'CAUSE IT HAS TO BE POWERPOINT PRE YEAH COMPONENTS DESIGN THAT'S IT 
I DID GET A BIT MORE DONE THAN THE LAST TIME 'CAUSE I KNOW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TIME SO I JUST COPY AND PASTE EVERYTHING INTO THE 
SOMETIMES I HAVE THESE POP UPS OR THIS SOUNDS AND THERE'S NOTHING THERE 
AND ALSO WITH I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE POWERPOINT IS IT TAKES ME FOREVER TO GET SOMETHING DONE WITH IT 
YEAH 
THE 
MM-HMM 
WHO WANTS TO START 
SOUND 
YEAH YEAH UH UH 
YEAH 
AND SHALL I GO FIRST 
SO I 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
UH COMPONENTS 
OH NO 
YEAH TRUE 
UM 
ALRIGHT 
SO I'M DEALING WITH THE COMPONENTS DESIGN 
UM LET'S SEE 
I UH USED SOME DESIGN EXAMPLES WE HAD UH FROM SIMILAR PRODUCTS 
AND I SAID UH POSSIBILITIES FROM OUR MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT ABOUT CURRENT COMPONENTS WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE DESIGN 
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO WANTED TO GO FIRST 
WELL THEY GAVE ME UM AN IDEA ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT 
WE'RE F MAINLY FOCUSING ON THIS GROUP BUT I WANT TO MAKE THE DISTINCTION CLEAR 
UH I COULD NOT DRAG THE PICTURES INTO THE THE SLIDES SO SO SO I DON'T HAVE EXAMPLES OF HOW IT LOOKS LIKE 
BUT IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT YOU UH WHAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO WITH THE SPONGY AND THE FRUITY LOOKING UH TYPE 
IF YOU THE YOUNG DYNAMIC PEOPLE WANT SOFT PRIMARY COLOURS UH WHICH LOOKS LIKE FRUITS YOU KNOW 
YOU CAN AND SHAPES THAT ARE CURVED AND NOT UH SOLID STRAIGHT LINES ANYMORE 
SO THIS BASICALLY UM YEAH GOES ON IT WHAT YOU WERE MENTIONING EARLIER 
THERE IS A LOT OF UM FACTORS INVOLVED IN CHOOSING THE COMPONENTS 
THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS 
UH FOR EXAMPLE THE ENERGY SOURCE 
WE HAVE FOUR TYPES 
THE BASIC BATTERY 
UH WE HAVE A HAND DYNAMO WHICH WE YEAH WE DUTCH REFER TO TO USE THE KNEIPGATT 
UH THE KINETIC PROVISION OF ENERGY WHICH MEANS IF YOU MOVE THE THING IF YOU SHAKE IT 
WHICH WILL BE FUN FOR TODDLERS RIGHT IF THEY WANNA USE THE 
AND UH OF COURSE SOLAR CELLS 
BUT I DUNNO HOW WE WOULD USE THAT INTO THE DESIGN OF THE ACTUAL PRODUCT 
SO UH MY YEAH ALSO ALSO ON YOU KNOW COUNTRIES WHERE THERE'S NO ISN'T MUCH LIGHT LIKE IN SCANDINAVIA 
THEY WOULDN'T BE YOU ABLE TO USE IT HALF OF THE YEAR YOU KNOW 
SO THAT'S NOT COOL THERE 
SO UM FOR THE UH A CASE THERE'S UH THE TRADITIONAL UNCURVED FLAT HARD CASE 
SINGLE CURVED WHICH MEANS THAT IT HAS UH CURVES IN ONE DIMENSION 
OR THE DOUBLE CURVED 
UM I WASN'T ABLE TO FINISH MY UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES SHEET 
BUT WELL YOU KNOW THAT WE WILL HAVE TO GO FOR THE DOUBLE CURVED 'CAUSE IT'S DARING AND DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE NOW 
UH THE CASE MATERIALS 
WELL WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF HARD UH MATERIALS LIKE THE THE HARD PLASTIC THE WOOD AND THE TITANIUM 
I WOULD DEFINITELY GO FOR RUBBER 'CAUSE IT FITS MOST ON WHAT PEOPLE WANNA SEE NOWADAYS 
UM POO THIS IS A LOT OF TEXT 
I WASN'T ABLE TO ORGANISE THIS YET 
WE HAVE YEAH SEVERAL UH INTERFACE DESIGNS 
UH WE CAN USE A SCROLL BUTTONS FOR THE MENUS 
BUT WE ALREADY KIND OF DECIDED TO GO FOR THE F FOR THE PUSHBUTTONS FOR THE THE ARROW BUTTONS 
SO THAT'S NOT REALLY INTERESTING 
ELECTRONICS 
YEAH MAYBE WE WANNA DECIDE ON WHAT ELECTRONICS TO USE THE ADVANCED CHIP I THINK 
SO EASIEST TO IMPLEMENT UH FOR THE PRODUCTION 'CAUSE THEY THEY CAN PRINT IT BETTER 
UM 
YEAH 
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT IT 
YEAH I WAS WORKING ON SOME PER PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
I FIRST UH CHOOSE FOR THE BATTERY 'CAUSE YEAH I'M TRADITIONAL AND THAT'S THE MOST OBVIOUS EASIEST CHOICE TO GO TO 
BUT I REALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD MAYBE UH THINK ABOUT THE KINETIC ENERGY WHERE YOU HAVE TO MOVE THE THING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT 
YEAH MAYBE WE 
I CAN IMAGINE THAT THE KINETIC UH TYPE ENERGY SOURCE WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO MAKE 
BUT IT IS MORE LONGLASTING THAT THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO EVER BUY BATTERIES AGAIN 
AND IT'S ALSO MORE FUN YEAH 
I ALWAYS CHUCK MY UH REMOTE CONTROL AROUND SO 
YEAH Y EXACTLY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SCARED ABOUT BOUNCING IT OFF THE G FLOOR AND BREAKING IT OR WHATEVER 
SO THAT'S THE END OF IT 
UH GO AHEAD 
NO IT MEANS CURVED ONE TWO DIMENSIONS 
SO UH W SINGLE CURVED 
UH LET'S SAY WOULD BE A B SQUARE BOX BUT THEN WITH CURVES IN ONE DIMENSION 
AND DOUBLE CURVED WOULD MEANS THAT IT WOULD HAVE CURVES CURVES IN EVERY DIRECTION 
LIKE THREE D. 
YEAH 
DESIGN 
I 
AND RUBBER 
RUBBER MATERIAL 
YEAH WE NEED THE THE CHIP ON PRINT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE THE SCREEN AND UH AND OF AUDIO FUNCTION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HAVE A SIMPLE CHIP JUST FOR PRESSING BUTTONS 
BUT WE NEED MORE 
I'M JUST THINKING THIS IS NOT MY DEPARTMENT BUT I I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS GONNA COST TO BE ABLE TO ME 
SO 'CAUSE WE NEED TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE OR A PIECE 
THAT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
CHILD LABOUR MAN WE LEAVE IT 
UM LET ME SEE 
WAIT A SEC 
YEAH I'M GOING THERE NOW 
INSPIRATION 
WELL 
UM YEAH MAYBE IT'S 
MAYBE IT'S EASIER 
YEAH 
YEAH PERFECT 
MAYBE IT'S EASIER IF YOU GUYS CAME OVER HERE 
SO SO THIS IS THE THE THE STANDARD TRADITIONAL TYPE WHERE THE FROM UH YEAH SERVES THE FUNCTION YOU KNOW 
IT'S LIKE REALLY BASIC 
BUT THIS UM IS MORE APPEALING TO OLD PEOPLE AND WE DON'T WANT THAT 
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
AND THE THAT MEANS CURVED ON BOTH DIRE DIRE UH DIMENSIONS 
NOT ONLY LIKE THIS BUT IT HAS TO BE EXACTLY 
IT HAS TO BE KIND OF INSTEAD OF THE PLAYSTATION THE MODEL 
IT HAS TO BE LIKE THE THE GAME CUBE YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR THUMBS WOULD BE LAYING IN THE INSTRUMENT AND IT HAS TO BE NICE TO HOLD 
AND 
IT UH 
YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE THE PROBLEM UH YEAH THE DILEMMA ACTUALLY 
'CAUSE WE WANNA APPEAL TO THE AT THE YOUNG PUBLIC WITH FANCY WITH FLASHY COLOURS AND WITH A LOT OF SHAPE 
AND 
YEAH AND THE AND THE RUBBER IT IT WILL LOOK CHEAP ALWAYS YOU KNOW WITH THE 
THERE IS MOBILE PHONES IN WHICH YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR ALSO OF THE LIGHTS 
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS FUNCTION 
TO CUSTOMISE IT AND SO I MEAN KIDS CAN MAKE IT LIKE MORE FLASHY WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF COLOURS AND PEOPLE WHO WANT SOMETHING YOU KNOW DIFFERENT 
OR MORE UH DESIGN THEY CAN GO FOR ONE COLOUR LIKE UH FOR EXAMPLE THIS UH PHOTO TH CAMERA 
PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S REALLY UGLY 
JUST GIVE ME THE THING THAT IT'S INSIDE THERE MAYBE I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS STUFF 
YEAH 
SO THIS I THINK ARE ALL MY UH 
AND THIS IS THIS IS WITH THE CURVED THAT I MEAN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
A COMPROMISE BETWEEN WHAT 
THIS THIS WOULD BE UH SINGLE CURVED UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
I THINK TH I MEAN OUR AIM IS TO MAKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT RIGHT 
TO MAKE SOMETHING NEW 
I WOULD GO FOR THE DOUBLE CURVED 
AND I I'M I'M THINKING UH YOU KNOW UH A DRAWING PALETTE WHERE YOU HAVE THE SHAPE FOR YOUR THUMB 
SO IT KIND OF HOLDS NICELY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WELL THIS IS REALLY YOUR DECISION ABOUT 
YEAH 
AS WELL 
YOU CAN MAKE A TRIGGER BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH OR THAT THAT IS THE CONFIRMATION BUTTON OR SOMETHING THAT YOU SCROLL WITH YOUR THUMB WITH THE ARROWS AND THEN CONFIRM 
THAT WOULD BE A NICE WAY TO USE IT BUT I MEAN YEAH I'M THINKING BIG ALREADY 
AND WE NEED SOMETHING THAT WILL THAT THAT YOU CAN ABLE TO USE IN ONE HAND I THINK 
YEAH 
HOW ABOUT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN 
HOW ABOUT WE DO A UH A POP UP SCREEN LIKE THE LAPTOP 
SO THAT THE ONLY THE SIMPLE FUNCTIONS WILL BE VISIBLE AT FIRST 
AND THEN IF YOU WANT 
YEAH 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
NO UH LIKE I WOULD DRAW IT LIKE THIS 
LET'S SAY THIS IS THE SIDE VIEW 
THAT YOU HAVE A A SCREEN THAT WILL COME UP HERE AND CAN GO DOWN THAT WAY 
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
SO THAT IT WOULD COME UP LIKE THAT 
YEAH OR PREFERABLY EVEN KEEP THE SIMPLE BUTTONS HERE AND THEN UNDER THE SCREEN EVEN YOU COULD PUT MORE MORE ADVANCED BUTTONS 
F FOR THE L. C. D. MENU RIGHT 
SO WE WE 
OH 
ACTIVATE AND THE THE YEAH 
TRUE 
TRUE 
BUT YOU CAN MAKE A YEAH YOU CAN MAKE A TRIGGER HERE 
YOU KNOW A SIMPLE UH WITH A 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
WELL YEAH THE THE IDEA OF IT WAS IS THAT BECAUSE YOU CLOSE TO YOU COVER THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND IT WON'T BE VULNERABLE TO SCRATCHES OR WHATEVER 
AND 
EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CLOSING MECHANISM WON'T BREAK 
TH IT'S VERY SOLID YEAH 
THAT ACTUALLY WILL OFFER SOME EXTRA PROTECTION FOR THE 
YEAH 
YEAH I WAS THINKING IF IF YOU HAVE YOUR HAND TO THIS IS YOUR THE 
OKAY 
IF THIS IS YOUR THUMB AND THIS IS YOUR HAND LIKE THAT 
WITH YOUR UH WRIST 
THAT YOU THAT IT WOULD BE KIND OF SHAPE LIKE THIS YOU KNOW 
SO IT'S EASIER TO HOLD ON YOUR HAND TO YOU IF 
OH YEAH 
YEAH OF COURSE 
YEAH THEN WE THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO TO MAKE IT LIKE THIS 
LIKE LIKE YOU DRAW HERE 
AND MAYBE TH THEN MAKE THIS THICKER ALSO THAN THE CENTRE 
GIVE IT I WOULD GIVE IT A FEMALE SHAPE BUT UH YEAH 
ANYWAY 
OBVIOUSLY 
MAKE IT MORE APPEALING TO GUYS 
I MEAN 
YEAH BUT WE HAVE HARDWARE INSIDE WHICH IS IS IT HAS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF BASIC SHAPE 
AND ALSO THE SCREEN YOU CANNOT MOULD IT 
YOU KNOW KIND OF THING 
YEAH 
AND THEN YOU CAN 
YOU CAN PLACE THE SCREEN HERE WHICH CAN COME 
AND BUT THEN I W I WOULD 
I WOULD DO THE ARROWS HERE KIND OF THING 
THESE BUTTONS 
AND THE SIMPLE BUTTONS HERE IS THAT 
I UH YOU UH THAT'S WHAT I MEAN 
THE ARROWS OVER HERE AND HERE THE S SIMPLE UH 
OR DO WE WANNA MAKE ITS SHAPE LOOK LIKE A BANANA OR SOMETHING 
I DUNNO 
YEAH 
YEAH WE COULD MAKE 
WE SHOULD USE 
YEAH WE WE NEED VERY PRIMARY COLOURS LIKE BRIGHT RED BRIGHT YELLOW 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY YEAH 
AND HOW ABOUT SOME UH SOME FLASHING STANDBY LIGHTS 
LIKE YOU HAVE ON THE SAMSUNG WELL I DON'T LIKE TO CALL BRANDS PHONES 
THE YOU KNOW THAT 'CAUSE I REMEMBER FROM ONE OF OUR FIRST MEETINGS THAT UH PEOPLE LOSE THEIR UH REMOTE CONTROLS OFTEN 
SO IT NOT NOT ONLY ONE ON THE COLOURS OF THE LEDS THAT WE WANT SOMETHING TO KEEP IT VISIBLE AT ALL TIMES OR 
UM 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AS LONG AS YOU AL IS UH HIGH CONTRAST BETWEEN THE THE BACKGROUND AND THE FOREGROUND COLOUR 
SO THAT PEOPLE WITH UH WITH 
AND ALSO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE A BIT COLOURBLIND 
BUT DON'T WE WANNA MAKE THE BACKGROUND THE THE BRIGHT COLO COLOURS 
SO THE THE TITLE OF THE THING IS VERY BRIGHT 
LIKE THE PICTURES I SHOWED YOU GUYS 
THESE THINGS WERE ALL LOOK LIKE BRIGHT RED BRIGHT RED FLASHY 
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOMETHING THAT STANDS OUT MORE 
YEAH 
THE GREEN 
IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY TRENDY COLOUR AT THE MOMENT 
DO YOU GOT A POP UP IF WE 
ALRIGHT 
NO THAT'S CUTE 
RED AND GREEN OR ACTUALLY THE B THE EASIEST TO DISCRIMINATE 
EVEN FOR COLOURBLIND 
THEY WILL USE ONE OF EACH AS GREY 
BUT IF YOU USE UH GREEN ONE BLUE THOSE KIND OF COLOURS WILL LIKE THE SAME 
I THINK 
I THINK SO 
YOU CAN WHAT WE SHOULD DO I THINK SO SO MAKE KIND OF A S THROUGH PLASTIC BUTTON WITH UH ONE COLOURED LED BEHIND IT 
SO THAT THE WHOLE BUTTON WILL SHINE 
SO THE COLOUR THE 
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT EASY TO USE BUTTONS WE HAVE TO 
WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE IT THE SHAPE IS THAT IT'S EASY TO HOLD F FOR BOTH HANDS 
BUT ALSO THAT YOU CAN REACH THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR THUMB IF YOU HOLD THE MACHINE 
OH RIGHT 
SO WE'RE GONNA WORK HERE 
NO THIS SKETCHBOARD 
ALRIGHT 
THANKS 
ALRIGHT 
THIRTY MINUTES 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
SHALL WE UH MAKE A NEW UH 
YEAH I JUST MAKE A NEW ONE 
ALRIGHT 
HUH 
YEAH I'LL JUST I'LL JUST KEEP IT THERE 
YEAH 
OH SORRY 
OKAY 
CURRENT COLOUR 
SO UM 
SHALL WE MAKE SOME OUTLINE SKETCHES OF THE BASIC SHAPE FIRST 
BECAUSE I I 
YEAH 'CAUSE I HAVE TO UH FOCUS ON THE ON THE BASIC LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN 
SO HOW IT'S GONNA LOOK 
AND YOU HAVE TO THINK UH HOW WE'RE GONNA PUT THE SCREEN ON IT AND THIS KIND OF THINGS 
SO IF I'M DRAWING AND YOU THINK OKAY I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PUT A SCREEN IN THERE YOU HAVE TO CORRECT 
UH DO YOU MIND IF I DRAW IN BLACK THEN 
FOUR NORMAL SKETCHES 
SO WE KIND OF WANT THE GIRLISH 
FIGURE 
I'M NOT SO GOOD AT DRAWING 
EXCUSE ME 
NO UH UH 
HOW DO WE UH UH OR INSERT TEXT 
OH THAT'S A BIT BIG 
YEAH 
YEAH 
EX EXACTLY 
OH 
UH I THOUGHT FOR THE SIDE VIEW THAT THE W THE BASIC SECTION WOULD BE RATHER UH A BIT THICKER THAN THE MIDDLE 
WHERE YOU'RE HOLDING IT WITH YOUR 'CAUSE YOUR FINGERS HAVE TO FIT UNDERNEATH AND 
EXACTLY BUT THE UH ABOUT THE UPPER SIDE HAS TO BE A BIT MORE LIKE THAT I THINK 
UH DON'T YOU THINK 
SO THE DISPLAY WE WILL PUT IN HERE THE BASIC UH FUNCTIONS IN HERE WHERE IT'S MOST REACHABLE 
THE 
THE THE 
EXACTLY 
OH 
THIS IS HARD 
WHAT DO DON'T HAVE TO DRAW IT EXACTLY DO WE 
WAIT 
LET ME TRY TO ONE MORE TIME 
MAYBE I'VE UH IT'S EASIER IF I DRAW IT IN NICE 
OKAY OF COURSE IT WILL BECOME WAY MORE UGLY 
YEAH 
THIS'LL TAKE FOREVER 
IT'S FINE TO WORK WITH THIS PEN 
UM SO LARGER 
AND YEAH 
IS USED 
'KAY 
UM OTHER VIEWS 
OH 
YEAH 
LET'S FILL I FILL IN THE BUTTONS LATER 
SO THIS IS GONNA BE FROM THE 
UH FROM YEAH YEAH 
SORRY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE THE IDEA IS THAT IT HAS TO FLIP UP TO HERE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
TRUE 
YOU CAN ADJUST THE ANGLE AT WHICH IT FLIPS 
SO IT CAN ALSO FROM THIS ANGLE IT CAN FLIP ALL THE WAY UP TO THREE 
YOU CAN FLIP IT UP TO THERE IF YOU WANT 
THINK SO 
YEAH BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL FEEL WEIRD IF YOU WOULD MAKE THIS SMALLER AND THIS BIGGER OR SOMETHING THAT I DUNNO 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL 
IT DOESN'T UM AS WELL 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
DEFINITELY 
YEAH I GUESS BUT UH I MEAN MOST VOTES COUNT RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH TRUE TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH IF YOU IF YOU'RE GOING FOR THE KINETICS 
YEAH 
I'M JUST THINKING TOTALLY DIFFERENT DESIGNS ALSO 
REMEMBER THAT THE WEIRD POCKETPHONE THINGY WHICH LOOKED LIKE KIND OF A GAMEBOY 
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT YEAH 
OH RIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
I LIKE IT 
OKAY 
THIS CAN GO 
OH YEAH WE HAVE TO F UH INCLUDE THAT IN OUR DESIGN AS WELL 
LET'S SEE 
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT 
OH 
YEAH 
I THINK WE DO 
YEAH OR J ARE ALSO SCROLLING FOR THE UM YEAH 
YEAH 
I DUNNO 
WE WE KIND OF WANTED TO STICK WITH THE 
YEAH I'M JUST THINKING IF WE I WE WANNA MAKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT RIGHT 
SO THE WITH THE SCROLL IS IS MORE FUTURISTIC THAN THE STANDARD ARROW BUTTONS 
I THINK 
OKAY 
I I'VE GOT THE SAME PROBLEM AS WELL 
OH 
NO 
YEAH 
NO PROBLEM 
YEAH 
NO 
I I DON'T UM I DON'T MIND 
THAT'S 
DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S BETTER THAN THAN MY UH DRAWING 
YEAH OKAY BUT I HAVE TO DESIGN THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
PUSHBUTTONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IS AN OPTIONAL UH AFTER 
OR COMBINE UH BOTH WITH A WITH AN UH 
OKAY 
AND THROW IT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO NO UH VERY IMPORTANT THING I WAS UH YEAH THINKING ABOUT IS THE SPEECH UH OPTION 
WE WERE GOING TO USE THAT 
YEAH 
SO UM 
YEAH UM YEAH THAT'S ONE THING UH WHICH I'M NOT SURE UH OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT UH NOT THE REMOTE CONTROL 
NO OKAY BUT IT HAS TO BE COMBINED WITH WITH THE MENU UH FOR FUNCTIONS AND 
SO OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
BUT D UH J DO WE UH DO THE SPEECH JUST FOR THE BASIC OPTIONS FOR THE SIMPLE BUTTONS 
FOR FOR EVERYTHING ELSE FOR THE ADVANCED OPTIONS 
OKAY 
UH WE HAVE THIS VERY UH BASIC UH TRENDY DESIGN 
EVERYBODY SAYS IT SO THAT'S WHAT'S UH YEAH UM 
YEAH IN THE ON THE LAST UH MEETING WE UH WE WERE YEAH PUTTING THE THE SIMPLE AND THE ADVANCED OPTIONS SEPARATED 
THAT'S 
YEAH OBVIOUS 
UM YEAH 
PRESSING THE THE MENU OPTION UH WILL DISABLE UH ALL OTHER OPTIONS IN YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL 
AND ONLY THE THE L. C. D. PANEL WILL UH LIGHT UP AND THEN YOU CAN ONLY UH CHANGE THE YEAH THE OPTIONS 
YEAH 
UM YEAH DESIGN HAS TO BE VERY ATTRACTIVE BUT THAT'S YOUR YOUR P YOUR YEAH 
YOU HAVE TO UH DELETE THIS BUT THIS IS THE THE THE SIMPLE UH LAYOUT 
UH DISPLAY ON THE UPPER SIDE WITH THE THE MENU BUTTON AND MAYBE A SOME SORT OF CANCEL BUTTON OR SAVE BUTTON 
I'M 
THE BACK 
BACK AND OKAY YEAH 
OH 
WHAT 
A LITTLE BIT I THINK ABOUT NOT NOT EVERYTHING WE 
OKAY 
UH I UH DIDN'T READ THAT 
BUT 
BUT THIS IS THE THE BASIC UH DESIGN UH FOR THE FOR THE UM YEAH FOR THE BUTTONS 
UM 
I WANTED TO TO CATEGORISE EVERYTHING 
UH WITH A SPEECH DISPLAY UH YEAH SOUND EVERYTHING YOU YOU NOTED IN YOUR UH MINUTES 
UM EVERY PUSHBUTTON HAS UH HAS ITS OWN UH LED LIGHT 
SO YOU CAN UH YEAH CHANGE UH M MAKE IT MORE TRENDY FOR FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE 
AND UH IF THERE ARE OLDER PEOPLE THEY WANTED MORE UH YEAH MORE UH LUXUROUS SO THAT'S IN A ALSO AN OPTION 
UM THAT WAS IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE IT IN UH CHINA SO IT'S NO PROBLEM 
UH IT'S IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE WE HAVEN'T GOT ALL THE OPTIONS UH YEAH 
YEAH 
THIS IS THE THE MEAN I WAS UH LOOKING UH IT 
YEAH 
ARROW YEAH 
YEAH 
SO YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT IT HAS ALSO IT IT IT HAS ALSO TO BE UH LUXUROUS UH FOR FOR YEAH RICH PEOPLE 
TH THIS LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE LIKE FOR ONLY FOR CHILDREN 
SO 
YEAH 
THE COLOUR 
YEAH 
OKAY BUT THE THE COLOURS YOU YOU CAN MAKE IT UH MAKE THE COLOURS WITH LEDS UH BENEATH THE THE BUTTONS 
IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON AND YOU CAN DISABLE THE THE COLOUR LEDS FOR FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
VERY CHEAP UH CHEAP LOOK 
YEAH BUT IF YOU IF YOU MAKE IT MORE CURVED WE WE CAN MAKE MORE AND MORE OPTIONS FOR BUTTONS 
IF YOU HAVE UH TO HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND 
Y Y YOU ARE NOT ONLY UM YEAH YOU DON'T NEED ONE DIMENSION BUT YOU CAN USE OTHER DIMENSIONS FOR PRESSING THE THE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
SOMETHING TO SHOOT AT YOUR TELEVISION 
YEAH 
THAT'S YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THAT'S THE THE MORE ADVANCED OPTIONS WERE UH FOR THE FOR THE MENU 
BUT YOU YOU WANT OKAY 
YOU JUST WANT TO HIDE THEM ALL 
THE UH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S BUT IT'S IT'S NOT 
IT'S NOT VERY UH VERY STRONG UH YEAH IF YOU DROP IT IN TIME 
OKAY 
BUT WHEN YOU ARE LEFT HANDED THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM 
BUT THAT'S THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE UH 
YEAH 
WE WE COULD MAKE SOME SOME RUBBER UH SOME RUBBER UH YEAH MOUSE WITH WHICH YOU CAN CHANGE UH AND SO IF YOU 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SOME YEAH 
NO NO NO NO 
OKAY 
YEAH 
IN THE ARROW'S OVER HERE 
YEAH 
OR BLUE 
DARK BLUE OR 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THE PRIMARY COLOURS WE WE CAN UH CREATE WITH THE WITH THE LEDS ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IF YOU W UH YEAH 
IF YOU MAKE IT UH JUST A YEAH BL GIVE IT A BLUE COLOUR THEN IT'S JUST A NEUTRAL COLOUR 
ALSO FOR THE FOR THE MORE UH YEAH FOR THE PEOPLE 
SO THAT'S 
SO THAT'S BLUE 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE A 
YEAH 
AND WHICH WHICH COLOUR SHOULD UH SHOULD I GIVE THE THE DISPLAY 
OH 
OR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH MAYBE A MAYBE A WHAT A WHITE BACKLIGHT 
DARK UH LETTERS YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S ADJUSTABLE 
YEAH 
OR NOT 
THAT'S HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT UH MORE TRENDY 
OR IS IT UH TOO EXPENSIVE 
MM 
AND IT IT LOOKS QUITE CHEAP THAT COLOUR I THINK 
IT'S IT'S NOT 
YEAH 
I DUNNO 
IT'S IT'S TRENDY OKAY 
BUT 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT THE ABOUT THE BUTTONS HAVE THEIR OWN LEDS OR NOT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THAT THAT'S A DEFAULT UH SETTING 
THE THE RED BUTTONS 
OKAY 
YEAH I I WAS THINK ABOUT A RED UH RED LEDS AND BLUE LEDS AND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT AT THIS MOMENT AFTER TH THIS MEETING 
OKAY 
YEAH 
UH SO THIS IS BASICALLY THE WHAT WHAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT 
YEAH L LET'S JUST UH DELETE ALL THESE UH OR 
UH NEXT 
OKAY 
OH 
YEAH 
AND THEN AFTER THAT WE CAN MAKE THE USER UH INTER INTERFACE 
YEAH 
YEP 
OH NO IT'S IT'S OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THIS PART ISN'T UH FUNCTIONING PROPERLY 
IT'S A BIT UH LARGE 
L LET'S MAKE FIRST THE THE THE ALL THE VIEWS 
THE THE FRONT VIEW SIDE VIEW AND THE BACK VIEW 
YEAH 
THE MIDDLE HAS TO BE VERY SMALL SO YOU CAN HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND 
YEAH THE DISPLAY W YEAH WE CAN PUT A DISPLAY 
YEAH 
THE THE ARROW FUNCTIONS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO IT'S IT'S UH IT'S OKAY 
YOU CAN MAKE IT M LARGER 
MAYBE IT'S EASIER TO TO DRAW UH 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE BASIC IDEA 
YEAH 
YEAH ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT BUTTONS ON THE SIDE OF THE UNIT 
THAT'S THE QUESTION 
YEAH 
FROM THE 
YEAH I'M I'M 
MAY MAYBE IT'S IT'S EASIER TO TO INTEGRATE THE THE THE L. C. D. SCREEN JUST NOT THIS THIS BUBBLE 
BECAUSE IT D DOESN'T HAVE TO FLIP THEN 
BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ENOUGH SPACE FOR FOR MAKING A AN L. C. ED 
BECAUSE HERE 
BUT WHY WHY DO WE NEED UH THE FLIPPING UH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH THE THE SHAPE IS OKAY BUT YEAH 
I DON'T USE THE THE YEAH WHY WHY WE SHOULD USE THE THE FLIPPING UH MECHANISM 
BECAUSE WE 
OKAY YEAH 
IT'S IT'S FOR FOR FOR MORE TRENDY UH 
BECAUSE WE HAVE ENOUGH SPACE 
UH HERE WE GOT UH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS THE THE ARROW UH YEAH BUTTON 
YEAH AND THEN UH WE SH MM 
YEAH THEN IT'S 
NO FLIPPING OR YOU WANTED THE FLIPPING SO 
BUT IF YOU IF YOU 
IF YOU DROP IT IT IT JUST BREAKS 
AND IT HAS TO BE VERY STRONG BECAUSE OF THE 
YEAH KIND OF 
AND IT'S ALSO FOR THE FOR THE CHILDREN IT'S YEAH FOR PEOPLE NOT SIXTEEN YEARS 
BUT THERE ARE MORE 
YEAH OKAY 
THAT'S TRUE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY WE 
YEAH 
THE REAL REMOTE 
I THINK UH IT'S THE SENSORS 
OKAY 
YEP 
OKAY THAT'S THE SIDE 
UH IT'S IT'S OKAY 
BUT DO WE WANT UH OPTIONS ON THE ON THE SIDE WITH THE WITH THE BUTTONS 
OR JUST LEAVE IT 
UH COULD MAKE AN UH A VOLUME BUTTON UH SCROLL VOLUME BUTTON 
FOR MINE 
OR 
YEAH 
NO YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH YOU ARE GOING TO DESIGN IT IS 
HELLO 
YES I MADE IT 
ENGLISH FROM NOW ON 
DRAWING OR 
YEAH 
UH IT WORKS 
SPICY 
WHERE ARE ARE ALL THE THREE PRESENTATIONS 
THE CONCEPTUAL OR 
OH 
BECAUSE I USE ONLY MY OWN PRESENTATION YEAH 
THIS 
I'LL JUST PUT IT IN THERE 
OR NOT 
UH I CAN'T CUT AND PASTE IT INTO THE OTHER FOLDER BUT 
MOVE TO MEETING ROOM 
YEAH 
YEAH ME TOO 
YEAH 
YES 
UM FIRST AGAIN OR YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
DID YOU OPEN IT ALREADY OR NO 
OH 
OH 
YES 
SO WELCOME TO THE MARKETING PRESENTATION ONCE AGAIN 
UM THIS TIME ABOUT TRENDWATCHING 
UH WELL THERE HAS BEEN INV INVESTIGATION AGAIN IN THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET 
UH IT SHOWS A NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENTS 
UH I WILL ADDRESS THEM UH IN A MOMENT 
UM FASHION WATCH WATCHERS UH HAVE DETECTED THE TRENDS FOR YOUNG PUBLIC BECAUSE THAT'S OUR PUBLIC 
UM WELL FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WILL BE WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHING UH SHOES AND FURNITURE 
AND THE FEEL OF THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY 
SO UM THE DEVELOPMENTS I WILL ADDRESS THEM UH YEAH WELL THIS IS THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES LOOKS OF FRESH BRIGHT COLOURS 
SO TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA 
UM WELL THE DEVELOPMENTS 
UH DEVELOPMENT ONE 
UH WELL MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR REMOTE CONTROL HAPPENS TO BE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT UH FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL 
UM WELL FANCY STANDS FOR AN ORIGINAL LOOK AND FEEL OF THE CASE AND THE INTERFACE 
AND THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT A REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICAL UH INNOVATIVE 
UM WELL IT STANDS FOR THE EASE OF TECHNICAL FEATURES THAT DO NOT EXIST IN CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
I THINK WE PRETTY MUCH COVERED THAT WITH OUR SCREEN AND UM AND SPEECH RECOGNITION AS I DON'T EXPECT THAT TO BE A PROBLEM 
AND THE THIRD DEVELOPMENT UM SO THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASY TO USE 
UM 
WELL THE FIRST ASPECT UH WAS TWICE AS IMPORTANT IS THE SECOND WHICH WAS TWICE AS IMPORTANT IS THE THIRD ASPECT 
SO UM THAT KIND OF GETS YOU THIS RATIOS 
SO FANCY LOOK AND FEEL UH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT UH POINT OF ATTENTION 
UH IS THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN COMBINATION WITH THE SPONGY MATERIAL 
UM WELL TECHNOLOG TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION WE'VE COVERED THAT PRETTY MUCH I GUESS 
UM AND EASY TO SEE I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE PROBLEM 
SO MY POINT OF ATTENTION IS ESPECIALLY THIS PART 
THAT THIS WILL BE A CRUX 
SO THAT WAS THE MARKETING UH PRESENTATION 
I HAD ONLY ONE DOCUMENT LEFT 
IS KIND OF THIS 
IS A K A SMALL EXAMPLE 
KIND OF THIS THIS LIKE 
UH NOTHING ABOUT THE BUTTONS BUT JUST SPONGE KIND OF THING AND AND SOME FRUIT AND COLOURS I DUNNO 
JUST MADE A QUICK DESIGN 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
IT'S OKAY 
F. FIVE 
YEAH 
W IN INDOORS 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I GUESS WE CAN ONLY CHOOSE ONE 
YEAH 
AND IT'S MORE FUN 
YEAH JUST PLAYING WITH IT AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MATERIAL'S RUBBER 
IT CAN BE DONE I MEAN YOU CAN'T HARM TO USE IT'S A PERFECT COMBINATION I GUESS 
YEAH 
SO 
SO DOUBLE CURVED IS LIKE THIS THIS THIS OR 
MM 
YEAH 
ALSO IN IN HEIGHT 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH WITH THE PROGRAMME 
AND AND THE AND THE BUTTONS THAT YOU NEED TO CONTROL IT I GUESS 
YEAH 
BACK AND OKAY 
NO 
RUBBER MATERIAL 
SO THAT'S UH SO THAT IS THAT THE ADVANCED CHIP 
WOW 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
KINETIC 
DOUBLE CURVED 
THE COST OF MAKING IT SHOULD BE TWELVE AND A HALF 
YEAH SO IT'S CHEAP 
UM WELL THE INTERFACE TYPE SUPPLEMENTS 
IF YOU GO TO YOUR HOMEPAGE OR SOMETHING YOU SHOULD 
GET YOUR OWN INFORMATION 
I GOT MY FRESH AND FYOO FRUITY UH PICTURE UH ALSO UH OVER THERE IS 
NO 
IT LESS TIME 
YEAH ALSO THE MENU 
YEAH THAT THAT WE 
YEAH 
YEAH I WAS THINKING OF THAT ALSO WITH WITH A WITH A UH ARROW 
SO THAT INDICATES THAT THERE'S NO MENU UNDER THAT MEAN 
SO 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
COOL 
S UNDERWATER UH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALSO A KIND OF RUBBER UH 
YEAH 
THAT SHOULD BE NICE 
SO SO 
YEAH THERE'S ONLY ONE ON THIS DIMENSION 
LIKE THIS 
SO CURVY OR NOT 
YEAH SO WE KEEP IT SINGLY C SINGLE CURVED THEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO FROM TOP VIEW IT LOOKS KINDA LIKE THIS 
BUT FROM THE SIDE YOU YOU CAN HAVE TO ALSO IN A KIND OF SHAPE 
MAYBE BECAUSE THE THE SCREEN IS ON TOP YOU CAN HAVE 
MAYBE YOU CAN C HAVE THIS KIND OF SHAPE 
A LITTLE UPWARDS 
SO THAT THE SCREEN IS MORE 
TOWARDS YOURSELF AS YOU CAN EASILY SEE YOUR SCREEN 
WELL WELL YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND SO IT'S A KIND OF AN ANGLE FROM YOUR EYES TO THE SCREEN 
SO THEN YOU HAVE DOUBLE DOUBLE CURVED IN SOME WAY 
SO THIS THIS IS IS THE SCREEN IS POSITIONED OVER HERE 
OH 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND THE BUTTONS ARE MORE WELL IT'S VERY THICK NOW BUT 
THAT'S UH THAT'S 
YEAH 
THAT THAT YOU CAN PRESS IT AND THEN IT COMES UP 
OR 
BUT THEN THE SIDE VIEW CAN BE STRAIGHT 
IF YOU HAVE A POP UP SCREEN 
BUT I DUNNO IF THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE 
I MEAN MAYBE IT'S TOO MUCH 
UH THE ADVANCED BUTTONS 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO OKAY B BUT YOU HAVE TO YOU NEED SOME BUTTON TO FLIP THIS PEN 
YEAH 
YEAH AND IT SAYS MENU AND IT FLIPS OPEN AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BUTTONS TO CONTROL IT IN COMBINATION WITH YOUR 
TRUE 
IT UH C IT CAN GO OPEN 
AN ADV AN ADV AND IT WILL BE COVERED IN SOME KIND OF UH THEN RUBBER LAYER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH UH 
IT'S VERY NO IT'S VERY STRONG 
YEAH 
YEAH THE LOWER PART DOESN'T WORK I GUESS SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY TO OVER THERE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT BUT THAT'S OPTIONAL FOR LATER I GUESS 
I MEAN WE HAVE TO MAKE 
YEAH WE WE BETTER SO CHOOSE ONE 
YEAH SO OKAY WE SHOULD BETTER CHOOSE ONE SH IN SHAPE 
BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF THE IDEA IS IT LAYS GOOD IN THE HAND AND THEN IN IN THE SIDE WITH WITH YOUR THUMB 
YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN USE YEAH YOU CAN USE THE BUTTON OPTION 
SPONGY 
SPONGEY CAN BE REACHED BY MEANS OF 
YEAH 
AND AND THE AND THE CONTROL THNGS IN THE MIDDLE 
THE THE THE ARROWS 
YEAH AND THEN NUMBERS 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
UH PRETTY NICE DESIGN 
YEAH 
YEAH IT LOOKS UH PRETTY FANCY 
UH BANANAS WIERD SHAPE AND OTHER FRUITS ALSO SO IT'S BETTER TO HAVE UM SOME SORT OF BASIC PRINT AND THEN A FRUIT PRINT ON SOME PRIMARY UH COLOURS 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT COLOURS SHOULD THE BASIC PRINT BE LIKE 
LIKE SOME SOFT GREEN OR SOMETHING 
OR AND THEN 
OH YEAH YEAH DARK BLUE AND THEN AND THEN VERY BRIGHT UH A YELLOW BANANA AN ORANGE 
UH A GREEN APPLE STUFF LIKE THAT WITH VERY UH BRIGHT TONES I GUESS 
SO YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE 
YEAH 
MM 
THAT DOESN'T REALLY WORK 
TO DRAW I GUESS 
OH 
WHAT'S THIS 
RIGHT 
HM 
YEAH 
TWO HOURS FURTHER 
THICKNESS 
OH 
OH 
WH WHY NOT GO FOR THE TWENTY 
YEAH 
THAT'S WHAT I CALL PAINTING 
SO THAT'S THAT'S A DARK BLUE BASIC COLOUR I GUESS 
IT'S PRETTY NICE 
AND THEN UH 
OH 
YEAH WITH SOME SOME YELLOW BANANA 
LIKE 
YEAH 
HOW DO YOU MEAN 
SOME SOME 
YEAH AN ORANGE 
WELL ALRIGHT WELL THIS IS MORE LIKE PURPLE I GUESS BUT IT'S SHOULD BE MORE REAL DARK BLUE 
SO THE CONTRAST WITH THE WITH THE FRUIT OBJECTS IS UH PRETTY HIGH 
SO UH YEAH 
THAT WOULD BE A NICE UH NICE DEVICE I GUESS 
I MEAN THE THE COLOUR OF THE BACKGROUND OF THE DISPLAY 
UH WELL I DON'T GUESS IT IS HAS TO BE A SIXTY UH SIXTY SIX FIVE THOUSAND UH COLOUR SO YEAH TOO EXPENSIVE 
SO JUST JUST A A BLUE BLUE BACKLIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
GREEN IS TOO OLD FASHIONED 
BUT BLUE BLUE'S OKAY 
JA 
WHITE BACKLIGHT AND DARK 
YEAH 
WHATEVER WHICH IS VISIBLE 
I KNOW YOU SHOU YOU SHOULD TEST IT UNDER UH UNDER A LIGHT CONDITIONS 
I MEAN IT'S HARD TO TELL UH I DUNNO 
YEAH 
TRUE 
WHICH WHICH UH COLOUR SHOULD THE BUTTONS BE 
WHY ADJUSTABLE 
NO UH 
BUT MAYBE I MEAN THEY HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOME COLOUR RIGHT 
AND OF THE BACKGROUND IS VERY DARK BLUE 
YEAH 
SO MORE LIKE 
DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL 
OH 
MORE LIKE THIS COLOUR 
AND THEN THEN YELLOW AND ORANGE AND RED OBJECTS ON IT OR SOMETHING 
BUT THEN THEN AGAIN WHICH COLOUR SHOULD THE BUTTONS BE 
THE THE PRESS BUTTONS 
SHOULD THEY BE WHITE OR BLACK OR 
OH 
YEAH BUT IT'S PRETTY FRESH ON THE OTHER SIDE 
YEAH 
MY COACH IS IN THAT COLOUR 
YEAH 
WELL IT WORKS PRETTY WELL 
AND THEN TIME WAS UP 
OH 
THAT YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT OR 
SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
THAT SHOULD BE PRETTY NICE COLOUR 
BUT MAYBE THE BUTTONS ALL BUTTONS IN RED SO MAYBE A BAD CONTRAST FOR COLOURBLIND PEOPLE 
BECAUSE THE OF THE GREEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO RED BUTTONS ARE OKAY 
HOW DO YOU MEAN 
YEAH 
NO THAT'S THAT'S TOO BUSY I GUESS 
YOU BETTER BET BETTER BETTER KEEP THE OLD AND THE BUTTON ITSELF IN THE SAME COLOUR I GUESS 
SO JUST AN EXTRA 
BUT OF LIGHT AND ATTENTION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
OF THE PRODUCT 
WHICH WE DON'T HAVE YET 
SO WHA HOW SHOULD I DO THAT 
OH OKAY 
OR YOU YOU ARE YOU SEND IT TO ME 
OR JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO DESIGN IT IN THIS BOARD RIGHT 
YEAH 
I I PROBABLY GET INSTRUCTION ON THAT HOW TO DO THAT SO I MAKE ANOTHER PRESENTATION I GUESS 
I KN I KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN ONE YEAH SO 
I'VE A BASIC IDEA 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT SO THAT'S UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IN THE LEFT 
SO SO YEAH 
YEAH 
THIS 
UH PRETTY ACCURATE 
UH WE SKIP THIS I GUESS 
SOUND BUTTON PRESS 
LIGHT ONLY BUTTON USER CA USER INTERACTION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO THE PLU THE PLASTIC PLASTIC BUTTONS ALSO HELP UH BECAUSE OF UM THEY ARE ONLY LIT DURING INTERACTION 
SO 
WELL IT'S A GOOD THING THAT THE BUTTONS AREN'T UM 
WELL THAT THEY ARE PLASTIC BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN LIGHT UP THE LIGHT ON WHEN WHEN THEY ARE USABLE 
MAYBE YOU SHOULD DRAW IT VERY LARGE LIKE THIS 
OH RIGHT 
EUROS 
YEAH 
MUCH EASIER YEAH 
I DON'T USE A SIGN THAT THE MEETING IS OVER YET BUT 
YEAH 
OH 
WRONG ONE 
ALRIGHT 
BUT W W 
I SEE IT IF IF THIS IS FROM THE SIDE WOAH 
STEADY 
BECAUSE THERE THE SCREEN GOES UP LIKE THAT RIGHT 
SO THEN IT'S LIKE THESE ARE THAT'S NOT CONVENIENT BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE THE SCREEN LIKE THIS AND LOOK LIKE THE IT'S BETTER TO HAVE TO SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS 
OR DOES IT FLIP ALL THE WAY 
IT'S BETTER TO TO HAVE THIS LIKE THIS I GUESS AND THEN FLIP IT LIKE THIS 
YEAH 
SO WE YEAH 
BUT WE STILL KEEP THE FLIPPING MECHANISM 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT MAYBE YEAH BUT MAYBE WE WE SHOULD THEN 
YEAH THERE THE MIDDLE 
SH SH SHOULDN'T WE INTEGRATE IT 
AND THEN LIKE I UH TH DOH 
COME ON 
SO THIS IS THE SHAPE 
OH 
IT HASN'T 
OKAY BUT THE SCREEN IS A BIT LOWER BECAUSE IF IT FALLS ON THE OTHER SIDE IT DOESN'T FALL ON THE SCREEN 
SO THERE'S A LAYER OF RUBBER ON THE SIDE 
SO NO FLIPPING BUT JUST ONE 
THROWING AND THE KINETICS 
OH 
WE BETTER MAKE WE BETTER MAKE IT LIKE THIS 
EVENTUALLY 
YEAH 
UH THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO HAVE A MOBILE PHONE IS ALSO TO TO DEAL WITH THEIR UH REMOTE UH CONTROL 
YES 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
GOOD 
YEAH 
WE SHOULD WORK ON OUR OWN ROOM RIGHT 
OR NOT 
YEAH 
YES 
SO YOU TWO IN HALF AN HOUR UH 
OKAY 
UH FIRST OF ALL I'LL START WITH THE COSTS BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO INFLUENCE OUR DESIGN 
IF YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU AL ALREADY HAD A LOOK OR NOT 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROBLEM 
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE 
UM I ALREADY TOOK THE LIBERTY TO MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS 
AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE FIFTEEN BUTTONS ON L. C. D. SCREEN AN ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT 
WE USE A UH SENSOR THAT'S FOR THE SPEECH 
UH WE USE KINETIC ENERGY 
AND WE WANTED UH THE BUTTONS ON A SPECIAL COLOUR 
OKAY 
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD DROP 
THE SPECIAL COLOUR OF THE BUTTONS 
OKAY 
OH 
SHOULD WE SWITCH IT A HAND DYNAMO 
OH THAT'S THE STILL THE SAME IDEA IS THE KINETIC ENERGY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO USE IT AND DO THINGS 
BATTERIES 
BATTERIES 
YEAH 
SO 
YOU'RE GOING TO REDESIGN SOMETHING 
OKAY SO WE'RE AT TWENTY FIVE 
UM 
DO WE KEEP THE SHAPE DOUBLY CURVED OR G DO WE GO FOR SINGLE CURVED 
MM-HMM 
OH 
YEAH 
UM UH ANOTHER OPTION I SAW WAS TO DROP THE BUTTONS ON THROUGH NINE 
SO YOU CAN'T DIRECTLY ACCESS A CHANNEL BUT INSTEAD USE ONLY THE UP AND DOWN ARROWS 
THAT WOULD SKIP NINE BUTTONS AND FOR AND A HALF EUROS 
YEAH 
UH THEN WE HAVE LEFT 
OH YEAH 
WE DO 
THEY DON'T NEED SPECIAL COLOURS 
FINE 
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT 
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH SOME MORE MENU OPTIONS 
YEAH 
OKAY SO MAYBE WE CAN DROP FEW MORE BUTTONS 
BUT UM NOW LET'S LOOK 
MM-HMM 
OH 
YEAH SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S UH AN INTEGRATED BUTTON IS FIVE TIMES THE COST OF A NORMAL BUTTON 
SO 
YOU COULD ALSO DROP J THREE MORE OF THIS WITHOUT LOSING MUCH FUNCTIONALITY 
YOU JUST DROP THE KEY AND THE BACK 
OH THAT'S FOR THE SPEECH 
YEAH 
SO S DROP SPEECH RECOGNITION 
YEAH THAT'S POSSIBLE 
BUTTONS 
THAT'S NOT VERY EASY TO USE 
YEP 
OKAY 
BECAUSE IF YOU D LOSE THE L. C. D. SCREEN WE NEED A LOT OF YEAH 
WE NEED A LOT OF EXTRA BUTTONS 
OKAY SO WE DROP THE SPEECH 
AND DROP IT YEAH 
OKAY 
SO IF FOR LESS EUROS 
SO WE STILL HAVE THREE AND A HALF EURO TO LOSE 
YEAH IF YOU LOSE THE THE BACK THE OKAY BUTTON UH V LET'S SAY WE ONLY HAVE THE FOUR ARROWS AND THE MENU BUTTON 
THEN YOU'RE 
UH AND THE POWER BUTTON WE HAVE ALSO 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S ONE OR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND 
THAT WOULD SAVE ZERO POINT TWO EUROS COMPARED TO ONE 
YEAH 
AT THIS TOGETHER IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IF IT'S ALMOST THE SAME AS IT KEEPING THIS 
AND WE CAN DROP THESE TWO 
VOLUME 
AND THE POWER BUTTON 
THAT'S THE BASIC 
YEP 
OKAY TH THAT'S YEAH THAT'S ONE OR MORE EXPENSIVE 
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION 
MENU POWER 
FOUR ARROWS 
POWER 
OH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO FOUR ARROWS 
UH POWER I BELIEVE 
OH 
WE HAVE A BACK AND A OKAY BUTTON 
AND THE MENU 
YEAH AND EVEN IF WE DROP THREE BUTTONS FROM HERE WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS AROUND HERE 
SO 
THE L. C. D. 
YEAH 
THEN I RATHER MAKE IT WOOD 
BECAUSE THEN ALSO IT'S GOOD IN THE MARKET WITH THE FORTY FIVE PLUS UH PEOPLE 
NO THAT MAYBE NOT 
BUT MAYBE IT'S BETTER THAN PLASTIC ANYWAY 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY UH 
YEP 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
PLASTIC 
OH THAT'S EASY BECAUSE PLASTIC AS FAR 
YEAH OKAY 
UH IF WE DROPPED UH 
YEAH 
YOU STILL NEED THAT 
SO 
NO I KEEP THE R YEAH 
YEAH 
BECAUSE WE ALREADY DESIGNED FOR IT 
SO 
YEAH AND SOMETHING ELSE 
NO YOU YOU WOULD REC 
THEN YOU HAVE 
THEN YOU STILL NEED TWO ADDITIONAL BUTTONS I BELIEVE 
FOR THE VOLUME 
YOU CAN USE THIS YEAH 
OH YEAH AND POWER 
THAT'S THREE BUTTONS AND THIS WOULD COST 
YEAH 
THERE 
UP DOWN OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
IT WOULD SAVE ENOUGH YEAH YOU CAN CHOOSE THIS DROP THIS THEN WE HAVE A HALF EURO LEFT 
SO WE CAN MAYBE STILL USE POWER BUTTON 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU SEE 
UH STILL YEAH 
UH THEN I MISCALCULATED 
OH YEAH 
SHIT 
DROP THE SPECIAL COLOUR 
'KAY 
WHAT ELSE 
UNCURVED 
YEAH 
THEY MADE IT VERY EASY FOR US 
UH I DON'T THINK I CAN USE UH PERSUADE THE MANAGEMENT TO SAY THIS IS BETTER FOR THE MARKET SO YOU SELL MORE THAN 
BUTTONS 
THAT'S UH YEAH SINCE WE ONLY HAVE ONE BUTTON 
I JUST UM I DON'T I THINK UH YEAH IT'S I THINK IT'S GREY REGULAR

OR OR THREE UH

MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM

OKAY 
UM WAS THERE UH ENOUGH ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 
SO AND THE UH ABOUT THE BOARD DIGITAL PEN 
HE WAS THAT HELPFUL OR 
OH 
YEAH IT WORKS 
MM-HMM 
SO THE PEN 
YEAH YEAH

OH 
OKAY OR ARE THERE ANY NEW IDEAS ABOUT THIS 
ALL I THINK 
I DIDN'T REALLY RECEIVE YEAH 
UH UH WE UH S SORRY UH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OH 
UH WE SHOULD UH ENTER OUR QUESTIONNAIRE 
OH 
WOAH 
OKAY 
OH OKAY 
THAT'S THE MANAGEMENT 
HOPE SO 
UM 
DID YOU DO YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE ALREADY 
OH 
IT WANTS 
YEAH BUT EVERYTHING IS 
JUST A NORMAL BATTERY THEN YEAH 
OH MY GOODNESS 
WELL I GUESS I WE'LL HAVE TO GO FOR SINGLE CURVE THEN 
I MEAN WE HAVE TO DROP ON EVERYTHING 
YEAH 
HOW ABOUT SORRY 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING 
A A 
AND UH 'CAUSE THEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO N THEY DON'T NEED SPECIAL COLOUR AS WELL 
THAT WAS EXACTLY MY POINT 
LIKE LET'S DROP ALL THE BUTTONS AND JUST MAKE ONE I MEAN WE'RE GONNA USE THE L. C. D. SCREEN ANYWAY 
SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO USE IT FOR EVERYTHING 
AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE AN OVERVIEW OF CHANNELS IN THE SCREEN AND SELECT A CHANNEL CLICK 
YEAH WE NEED AN INTEGRATED BUTTON FOR EVERYTHING THEN 
YEAH 
KIND OF 
I WAS BECAUSE 
YEAH 
IF YOU IF YOU GO TO IF YOU GO TO OUR UH VIEW LIKE YOU IF YOU ARE IN THE SOUND SYSTEM THERE 
UH AND YOU WANNA ADJUST THE TREBLE FOR INSTANCE THIS IS JUST UH AN EXAMPLE 
Y Y YOU WANNA USE A BEAR IN WHICH YOU CAN ADJUST IT FROM ZERO TO TEN FOR EXAMPLE 
BUT YOU WANT A SOUND PREVIEW OF HOW IT'S GONNA SOUND RIGHT 
SO YOU WANNA CLICK ON TO ACTIVATE IT WHO AND WHEN YOU MOVE TO HEAR THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TREBLE COMING OUT ARE GOING INTO THE SOUND 
SO YOU'LL YOU'LL NEED A A KIND OF A JOYSTICK UH BUTTON 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
YEAH IT'S R YEAH 
NO 
NO BUT 
YEAH IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT UH WE NEVER CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITIES OF UH SPEECH RECOGNITION 
'CAUSE IT CAN TAKE THE FUNCTION OF A LOT OF UH UH BUTTONS 
NO 
YEAH BUT LETS JUST SAY THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION WORKS 
WE UH WE WE HAVEN'T REALLY INTEGRATED THIS THE SPEECH INTO THE SYSTEM SO WE CAN MIGHT AS WELL S DROP THAT 
WE NEED TO LOSE SOME BUTTONS 
WHICH THAT'S EVEN 
YEAH IF YOU IF YOU GO TO EIGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW IT 
YEAH WE NEED THE CHIP FOR THE FOR THE L. C. DISPLAY 
YEAH 
TRUE 
OH 
HMM 
YEAH UH 
YOU UH UH 
YEAH 
SO THE OTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO GO FOR THE THE SAMPLE SPEAKER AND WHICH CAN USE A REGULAR CHIP WH WHICH IS SIX EUROS IN TOTAL 
THAT DOESN'T MATTER 
WELL YEAH 
EXACTLY 
YEAH BUT THE UH CAN'T WE IF UH FIT ALL THE BUTTONS ON AN INTREG INTEGRATED SCROLL PUSH BUTTON 
'CAUSE THAT WILL SAVE AS ONE AND A HALF EURO ALREADY 
AND THEN IF WE 
TH THEN WE HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH A LOT OF MENUS TO BE ABLE TO GET WHERE YOU WANT HUH 
AND UH 
YEAH DO IT L YEAH 
AT LEAST ONE FOR POWER 
OH 
YEAH IT'S JUST AS EXPENSIVE SO WHAT WE HAVE NOW 
YEAH ENDLESSLY 
I MEAN IT CAN BE A POWER BUTTON AS SOON AS IT POWERED ONE 
YOU CAN GO INTO YOU IN YOU MEAN MEAN YOU CAN CHOOSE UH FLIP CHANNEL UH YOU CAN CHOOSE SOUND OPTIONS ANY OPTIONS 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE SHOULD 
'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MONEY AND WE WE WANT THE SCREEN 
I GUESS WE HAVE TO 
WE'LL WE'LL BE ONE 
YEAH IT SAYS RIGHT HERE 
YEAH 
BUT WE DEFINITELY WANT THE THING TO BE A SPECIAL COLOUR THOUGH 
DAMN 
YEAH AND THEN 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
WELL YOU ONLY HAVE TO POWER IT UP WHEN YOU WANNA USE IT 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORT 
WE ONLY HAVE 
YEAH BUT 
WELL WE COME BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD THEN HUH 
IT'S SILLY 'CAUSE WE WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THIS MEETING BEFORE WE START DRAWING 
OH YEAH 
OKAY 
DROP EVERYTHING 
YEAH 
WE WENT STRAIGHT INTO FINANCE 
FOUR YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I THINK IT DOES 
BECAUSE THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE YOUNG USER WAS ALSO DEFINED IN COLOUR AND SHAPE AND THE EASE OF L. C. D. RIGHT 
YEAH 
WELL WE HAVE EXTENDED MENUS ON THE ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
SO 
I 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH ALRIGHT 
YEAH YEAH 
DEFINITELY ONE 
IT HAS TO BE 
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND THEM 
YEAH THE NEXT NOT AS MUCH SO 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S UH IT'S INTEGRATED 
E EXACTLY JUST LIKE A M MOBILE 
WELL UH WE SHOULD BE BUILD IT IS THAT IF YOU DON'T KIND OF PUSH INTO THE MENU OR SOMETHING 
IF WHEN IT'S N YEAH IT'S TURNED ON 
IT AUTOMATICALLY HAS THE THE PROGRAMME AND THE VOLUME FUNCTION 
BUT AS SOON AS YOU CLICK IT YOU GO INTO THE MENU OR SOME OF YOU ARE YOU DOUBLE CLICK IT 
NO BECAUSE IT HAS FOUR ARROWS RIGHT 
OH YEAH 
YEAH I WAS THINKING STILL ABOUT OUR UH INTEGRATED JOYSTICK 
EASY 
YEAH THAT IS A BUMMER 
WE'LL MAKE IT A MORSE CODE 
YEAH 
YEAH I WOULD GO FOR FIVE OR SIX YEAH 
OKAY FIVE 
LET'S NOT DISS OUR REMOTE 
YEP 
JUST ONE BUTTON 
BUT UH YEP 
WE STILL HAVE THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRINT 
FOR UH I MEAN THE UH NEVER MIND 
I'M A BIT LOST 
IT'S WAY MORE PRACTICAL YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WE STILL UH WE STILL HAVE THE PRIMARY COLOURS 
BUT ONLY IN THE ON THE OUTSIDE NOT IN THE BUTTON 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH STILL WE WE DROPPED ALSO IN THE THE DOUBLE UH CURVE 
AND AND COLOUR 
YEAH 
SO 
YEAH 
OH 
ACTUALLY WE DO WE DIDN'T DO AS WELL IN THIS ONE 
BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY AN OLD ONE UH WITH LITTLE CURVE ON THE SIDE AND IN A DIFFERENT COLOUR 
STILL IT'S STILL HARD 
I MEAN THE SPONGE LIKE AND THE THREE D. SHAPE THAT WOULD GIVE IT SOMETHING YOUNG AND FRESH 
OF COURSE 
YEAH BUT IT BE BECAUSE UH WE COULDN'T HARDLY DRAW ON THE B IS IN THE LOWER HALF OF THE SCREEN 
WE COULD NOT MAKE IT BIG ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY DRAW ON THE 
SO I MEAN I WANTED TO PUT DIGITS ON THE BUTTONS AS WELL 
BUT 
HELLO YEAH 
IF WE HAVE ONLY ONE BUTTON 
AND EVEN THE SHAPE WE HAVE NOW UH SIMULATES KIND OF AN R. AND THE REVERSED R. DOESN'T IT 
SO 
NO 
THE ONLY E THE ONLY THING EASY BUT IT IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE YOUR FINGERS 
'CAUSE IT HAS ONLY ONE BUTTON 
YEAH EXACTLY 
I WOULD SAY SIX 
IT'S REALLY NOT EASY TO USE 
'CAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING EVERYTHING 
MOST VOTES COUNT 
UM 
DEFINITELY IN CASING 'CAUSE WE HAVE A HARD PLASTIC YEAH 
YEAH BECAUSE THE THE BATTERIES THOSE THINGIES LAST FOREVER 
AND THE THE CASING HARD PLASTIC ALSO LASTS FOREVER 
SO I WOULD GO FOR ONE 
OKAY YEAH 
OH 
NO UM 
I WOULD G I WOULD GO FOR FOR 
BECAUSE WE KIND OF TRIED IT BUT WE KIND OF FAILED WITH THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S IT 
UH WE CAN DO THE MATH 
OH 
YEAH 
DID YOU MAKE THIS QUESTIONNAIRE OR WHAT 
OH 
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT THAT FAST 
IF 
PRETTY DIFFICULT 
JUST TYPE IN THE DIGITS 
THEY'RE ALL ONE DIGIT NUMBERS RIGHT 
AND THEN YOU CAN COUNT THEM TOGETHER 
ELEVEN 
FIFTEEN 
SIXTEEN 
SEVENTEEN 
UH WHAT 
HOW HARD IS THIS 
NEVER MIND 
TWENTY FOUR 
TWENTY EIGHT 
TWENTY EIGHT 
YEAH THE LOWER THE THE LOWER THE SCORE THE BETTER RIGHT 
YEAH BUT 
BUT 
I ARE YOU SURE WE THIS NUMBER ACTUALLY TELLS US SOMETHINGS 
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE SOME QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO POSITIVE ISSUES AND SOME TO NEGATIVE 
SO IF YOU GIVE A TREE OUT A POSITIVE IT ACTUALLY MEANS THAT THE LOW THE LOWER THE BETTER 
BUT IF YOU GIVE TRUE TO A NEGATIVE QUESTION 
NO 
DURABLE THAT'S GOOD 
EASY TO USE 
YEAH 
ALSO GOOD 
YEAH OKAY 
I GUESS YOU DID DO IT 
OH YEAH YEAH 
NO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH TRUE 
YEAH DEFINITELY DEFINITELY 
BECAUSE NOW IT'S JUST AN AVERAGE IT'S REMOTE 
YEAH OKAY BECAUSE OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
BUT UH IT LOOKS AND STUFF IT STILL UH IT'S NOT IT'S NOT REALLY EYE CATCHING EXCEPT FOR THE COLOUR 
YEAH 
PRODUCT EVALUATION 
SHALL WE TRY 
BLACK 
OKAY UH WE'RE STILL GONNA GO FOR THE FANCY COLOURS 
BUT ARE WE GONNA STICK WITH THE GREEN OR ARE WE GONNA DO BLUE 
NO SCROLL BUTTON AND 
FOR WHAT 
SHOULD GIVE IT SOME TIME 
YAY 
HAVE TO TAKE THIS WAY ALSO 
AND THIS UM 
OH YEAH OF COURSE 
UM PEN YEAH 
FORMAT 
CURRENT COLOUR RED 
OH YEAH WE DID OUR SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE LINE WIDTHS NOW THAT'S A TEN 
IT'S GONNA BE ONE STR SCROLL 
HORIZONTAL'S EASIER TO 'CAUSE YOU CAN 
SO IT MORE NATURAL THAN THIS 
SO LET'S SAY WHOOPS 
'KAY 
BASICALLY 
IT'S REALLY UGLY 
OH 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
LIKE A THREE COLOUR THAN THIS ONE 
YEAH CAN WE DO IT UH UH CAN WE DO A PRINT 
I THINK WE HAVE TO CHOOSE YEAH 
OKAY SPECIAL COLOUR 
WE DO HAVE SPECIAL COLOUR 
DOES IT MEAN UH THAT 
SHALL WE JUST GIVE IT SOME DOTS TO MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY 
PURDY 
PURPLE 
YEAH YEAH 
UH IN MY REMOTE HAS ACNE 
NO 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THAT BUTTON 
IT'S SO CUTE 
DUH 
SO THAT THAT 
HOW THE WE DID WE DO THAT 
WE CAN TRY 
THAT DOESN'T RESPOND ALSO AT THE END 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S 
NO 
WHERE DO YOU WANT SOME MORE DOTS 
OKAY IT'S NOT THE PRETTIEST I KNOW 
IT'S NOT SO RANDOM HUH 
YEAH OKAY 
WE CAN MAKE A L A LOGO 
LIKE UH PUT IT LIKE THE SHAPE 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I MEAN IT'S NOT TO UH 
THAT'S NOT THEIR LOGO IS IT 
YEAH 
IT'S A 
HOW SHALL WE DO THE LOGO IN BLACK OR NOT 
OR YOU DISSING MY DRAWING 
THIS ONE 
IT LOOKS LIKE A RIBBON 
SO WHO WANTS TO DRAW 
THIS IS ACTUALLY QUITE FUN 
DO WE NEED TO DO ANYTHING 
I HEAR YOU PEOPLE ARE TYPING 
OH OKAY 
IT'S ALMOST FOUR 
IT FOR YEAH 
THIS IS REALLY BIZARRE 
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A IT LOOKS LIKE A BUTTERFLY 
NO BUT IT I IT'S NOT A B A BEAMER 
BU IT'S A NORMAL T. V. SCREEN KIND OF THING 
OH 
YEAH THERE IS SOME KIND OF PROJECTION I THINK 
WITH A WITH A MIRROR HUH 
OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
SO ARE WE GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING TO THIS 
I MEAN IS IT GONNA 
THIS IS GONNA BE FLAT 
YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THIS IS ALSO GONNA BE 
NOPE 
BUT SOMETIMES THEN UH ALL OF A SUDDEN IT DOES WORK 
MAYBE 
NO IT'S I THINK YOU ONLY NEED TWO POINTS 
OR NOT 
NO YOU SH 
SLANTED YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL MAYBE 
YEAH IT IT MATTERS FOR THE UM IF THIS THING 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S ONLY A BIT LIKE TO THAT SIDE BUT THAT IS THAT ONE BY THE WAY 
'CAUSE THIS ONE MAKES THE ANGLE EITHER LIKE THIS 
SO I IF I CHANGE THIS IT WILL GO THERE IF I CHANGE THAT WILL GO THERE 
MM-HMM 
I WILL TAKE THIS WAY 'CAUSE IT LOOKS MESSY 
MAYBE WE WILL 
WHAT'S THIS ANYWAY 
IT LOOKS LIKE CANDLE WAX 
UH THE UH DO YOU MEAN THE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN US 
OR 
YEAH WELL IT FIRST I WAS REALLY STRESSED 
BECAUSE IT WENT A BIT FAST 
BUT THEN AS I KNOW THE TEMPO THAT I HAD TO BE IN THE SECOND TIME I THINK I DID A BIT BETTER 
AND THE THIRD TIME YEAH I MEAN 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH

MM-HMM 
YEAH 
DEFINITELY

YOU WERE MORE IN CHARGE KIND OF THING 
I GUESS SO 
I MEAN 
I 
WE WERE PRETTY DEMOCRATIC 
YEAH 
MAYBE YEAH 
IT'S UH IT'S THE THE PEN IS MORE INTUITIVE 'CAUSE WE'RE ALL USED TO WRITING WITH PEN 
AND UH SO I SAID UH I UH HAVE AN IDEA HOW POWERPOINT WORKS 
SO WILL TAKE ME HALF A DAY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A NORMAL POWERPOINT PRESENTATION 
BUT ONCE I GOT TO KNOW THE PROGRAM PROBABLY I MEAN IT LOOKS BETTER YOU KNOW 
OR UH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YOU CAN 
GIVE IT A KIND OF A HOME STYLE LIKE WE HAVE I 
THE THE LOGO AND EVERYTHING 
AND I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH THE THE THE PROBLEM WITH POWERPOINT FOR ME IS THAT YOU HAVE TO I PUT IN THE PRE MADE CHUNKS C AS WELL 
YOU KNOW YOU CAN DRAW SOMETHING ON THE SKETCH BOARD AND THEN TAKE OUT THERE OR WHATEVER 
ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
WELL AS AS YOU IN A SECOND HUH 
YEAH WE HAVE TO PULL OUT THIS WAY HUH 
WAIT

WELL YOU CAN USE THE SCROLL WHEEL AS WELL FOR UM MAYBE FOR THE CHANNELS 
BUT YOU STILL UM 
YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME SOME BUTTON ON THE MENU TO GO BACK 
YEAH 
WELL NOT ALL 
NOT IS NOT SOUND I GUESS 
MM 
YEAH 
WH WH WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE UH SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER 
SPEECH RECOGNITION 
RIGHT 
BUTTONS 
NO IT CAN BE DISTURBED BY BY NOISE AND 
STUFF LIKE THAT 
LET LET LET ME SEE WHAT'S MORE WHAT'S MORE POPULAR 
I GUESS THE THE SCREEN WAS MORE POPULAR THAN UM THEN THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
I HAVE TO LOOK ON THAT 
LET ME SEE 
UH WELL NO I WAS WRONG 
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WHO LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
BUT IF IT 
BUT IT IT IT'S A IT'S A BOTH A HYPERS 
NO BUT WELL WE YEAH WE KEEP THE SCREEN 
I MEAN IT'S IT'S ABOUT THE SAME 
EIGHT ONE TO NINETY ONE PERCENT UH SIXTY SIX TO SEVENTY SIX 
YEAH 
LET'S DROP THE SPEECH 
SIXTEEN EUROS 
BUT YOU YOU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THEN AND THEN SO UM 
THE THE OKAY 
AND THE MENU BUTTON DOES ALSO DOES THE KEY FUNCTION THEN 
AND THEN WHEN YOU IN THE MENU 
SO SO SO YOU ACTIVATE THE MENU 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL OKAY 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE F F FOUR BUTTONS CHANNEL UP AND DOWN UH VOLUME LEFT RIGHT OKAY I'VE I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT 
AND THEN AND THE POWER BUTTON 
SO THAT'S FIVE 
THAT'S BASIC 
THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED ANYWAY 
AND THEN FOR THE MAIN UM YOU CAN HAVE A BUTTON THAT ACTIVATES MENU 
OR DO OR DO WE JUST INTEGRATE NO NO NO SCROLL WHEEL WITH A PUSH BUTTON 
AND THEN OF THE MOMENT YOU USE THE SCROLL WHEEL THE THE THE MENU GETS ACTIVATED 
AND THEN YOU CAN SCROLL CHOOSE ONE OPTION CLICK ON IT IT GOES INTO ONE FEATURE 
CLICK ON IT AGAIN SELECTS FEATURES SCROLL ADJUST IT 
CLICK AGAIN IT'S OKAY 
THEN YOU ONLY NEED ONE BUTTON TO MOVE BACK 
OR OR UNDER EACH OPTION YOU SET A YOU SIT ON A SCREEN THING WHAT SAYS BACK 
AND YOU SELECT THAT ONE CLICK AGAIN AND YOU GO ONE STEP BACK 
AND ON THAT MENU SCROLL CLICK ONE STEP BACK 
SO THAT THEN YOU NEED FIVE BUTTONS AND AN INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON 
BUT WE CAN'T DROP THREE BUTTONS 
BUT I SEE THAT'S YEAH 
SO THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA 
BECAUSE WHICH BUTTONS DO WE HAVE NOW 
THIS FIVE WHICH I MENTIONED AND THEN MENU AND THEN 
YEAH 
IF IF THE FOR THINGS 
YEAH THE POWER 
WHICH MORE 
YEAH 
POWER 
THE YEAH THAT'S FIVE 
YEAH OKAY THAT'S SEVEN AND ONE TO ACTIVATE THE MENU YEAH 
SO OKAY THAT'S EIGHT 
WELL WE CAN'T REDUCE THAT 
WE WE KEEP THE DISPLAY 
UH WELL OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL WE NEED THE ADVANCED 
INSTEAD OF OUR 
YEAH BUT BUT THAT'S NOT OUR MARKET 
OH NO HARD PLASTIC 
YEAH PLASTIC WITH SPECIAL COLOUR 
NO BUT I I BECAUSE WE HAVE TO USE THE SPECIAL COLOUR ANYWAY 
YOU FORGET THAT 
SO LET'S GO FOR THE PLASTIC 
AND SINCE IT'S NOT KINETIC IT DOESN'T HAVE TO FLIP AROUND THAT MUCH 
WE STILL HAVE PROBLEM OF TWO EUROS 
YEAH WE CAN'T DROP THEM 
DO WE REALLY NEED THAT ADVANCED CHIP FOR AN L. C. D. DISPLAY 
OH 
I RATHER KEEP I RATHER KEEP THE DISPLAY 
SO THE ONLY OPTION IS ONE HAND DYNAMO 
UH IN THE UH THAT'S ONE OR RIGHT 
AND THEN INTEGRATED S YEAH BUT THAT WOULD MAKE IT NOT SO EASY TO USE 
I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT EASY TO USE BUT 
YEAH 
YOU YOU PRESS IT FOR LIKE THREE SECONDS 
THEN THEN THEN YOU SHOULD DO EVERYTHING IN THE MENU 
IN THE SCREEN 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WE'D ALRIGHT 
IT IS IT SAVES US FOUR EUROS AND IT COSTS AS TWO AND A HALF 
SO LET'S SEE WE WE DROP THE PRICE BY ONE AND A HALF 
BUT WE STILL HAVE THIRTEEN LEFT 
THIRTEEN 
SO STILL HALF 
THERE GOES THE SPECIAL CO WELL THAT WOULD MAKE IT LESS APPEALING 
SO THAT'S AN OPTION 
WE SURE ABOUT THE ADVANCED CHIP WE NEED FOR THE DISPLAY 
WELL YEAH 
YEAH 
WE MADE IT HARD FOR OURSELVES WITH THE DISPLAY BUT IT'S A COOL FEATURE 
YEAH BUT I MEAN WHAT IS MEANT BY SPECIAL COLOUR 
SO YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
SO I RATHER HAVE ONE HAND DYNAMO THAN THAN DROP THE COLOUR 
YOU CAN STILL PLAY WITH IT THEN I GUESS 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH BUT A HAND DYNAMO COSTS A LOT OF ENERGY TO KEEP THE SCREEN WORKING 
SO I GUESS THAT ISN'T AN OPTION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH TRUE 
LET'S LET'S GO FOR THE HAND DYNAMO THEN 
OR OR DO WE ARE DO WE DO UNCURVED AND FLAT 
INSTEAD OF 
YEAH IT HAS TO BE CURVED AND HAS TO HAVE THAT COLOUR 
AND A SCREEN 
YEAH 
SO WHAT WHAT IS SPECIAL F UH YEAH SPECIAL FORM 
MAYBE THAT'S NICER 
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTONS 
SO D D UH MAKE IT A SPECIAL COLOUR THEN 
YEAH M MAKE IT A SPECIAL COLOUR THEN 
OKAY 
MAKE IT A SPECIAL COLOUR AND THEN IT LOOK FANCY 
SO 
YEAH 
LET'S LET'S SAVE IT 
YEAH 
LET'S DO IT LIKE THIS I MEAN BECAUSE IT DOES NOT LOSE OUR IDENTITY OF THE PRODUCT AS WE 
YEAH ALL YOUR DESIGNS ARE UH PRETTY MUCH 
YEAH BUT THAT BUT THAT'S THE FUN PART OF IT 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH WHAT'S THE NEXT UH PHASE 
UH THE AGENDA 
BY YOUR HUMBLE P. M. 
UH F FRUSTRATED 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
DROP YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT THAT'S YEAH 
I UH I SURE DID 
AND IT COMBINES WITH PRODUCT EVALUATION 
UH SO 
WE ALL HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WHAT HAS CHANGED NOW 
SO WHAT WE HAVE LEFT ON THE BECAUSE EVALUATION IS BASED ON THE INITIAL UH USER REQUIREMENTS 
ALRIGHT 
LET'S MAKE IT BIG 
UM 
WELL WE EVALUATE UH THE DESIGN WITH A SEVEN POINT SCALE AS FOLLOWING 
WELL THE REMOTE CONTROLS ACCORDING CRITERIA BLAH BLAH BLAH 
TRUE OR FALSE AND THEN IN A SCALE OF SEVEN POINTS A SCALE SO WE ALL KNOW IT 
UM 
WELL THE CRITERIA ARE BASED ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS UH THE TRENDS FROM THE MARKETING RESEARCH AND THE MARKETING STRATEGY OF THE COMPANY ITSELF 
UM WELL THEY ARE IN A WORD DOCUMENT WHICH I WILL OPEN NOW 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S OPEN YET 
NO 
AND WE ALL HAVE TO UH AGREE ON A CERTAIN LEVEL 
WHAT'S THIS 
OH 
I DON'T KNOW 
UM 
WELL THE FIRST POINT IS THE REMOTE CONTROL MATCHES THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE YOUNG USER 
SO THAT MEANS THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR WAS USING QUITE A LOT OF FUNCTIONS 
HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
YEAH THE S U 
IT IT IT'S IT'S MAINLY CON MAINLY CONCENTRATING ON A LOT OF FUNCTIONS ON THIS QUESTION 
SO DO YOU THINK 
YEAH 
YOU CAN YOU CAN UM YEAH YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF EXTENDED MENUS 
THAT'S TRUE 
I MEAN THE THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ALMOST UNLIMITED TO TO BUILD IN MENUS ON THE SCREEN 
SO IN A SCALE FROM 
ONE TO SEVEN WHAT DO YOU THINK 
HUH 
TWO OR THREE 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WELL WE HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE 
SO UH WHAT DO YOU SAY 
I AGREE ON TWO 
YEAH 
I UH I SAY TWO PERSONALLY 
BUT 
YEAH WELL WE HAVE TO EVALUATE I GUESS WHAT WE HAVE NOW 
YEAH 
YOU SAY THREE AND YOU YOU SAID AL ALSO THERE 
THERE 
OKAY WELL I SAY STILL TWO BUT IT HAS TO BE THERE THEN 
YEAH I KNOW 
SO IT'S MADE BOLD 
BUT IT'S NAH IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR ON THE SC MAYBE OTHER COLOUR YEAH 
THAT'S BETTER 
OH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
UH IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BOLD ANYMORE 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
UM WELL THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS WHA 
THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS IRRELEVANT OR LESS USED FUNCTIONS 
FOR EXAMPLE AUDIO SETTINGS AND SCREEN SETTINGS 
YEAH 
WELL YEAH 
SO IT IT'S A VERY TRUE POINT 
I MEAN IT HIDES ALL THESE FUNCTION 
BUT I MEAN UH THEY'RE HIDDEN IN THE SCREEN 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THEM YOU DON'T SEE YOU USE JUST SCROLL OVER THEM 
AND YOU PLACE THEM 
IF I DON'T KNOW WHERE 
SO THAT'S VERY TRUE I GUESS FOR OUR CASE 
UH THE SECOND POINT 
IT SHOWS THE RELEVANT AND MOST USED FUNCTIONS 
POWER BUTTON 
DO WE UH STILL HAVE A POWER BUTTON 
WELL YEAH THE BUTTON'S INTEGRATED HUH 
YEAH WE DROPPED IT 
YOU J YOU JUST PUSH IT IN FOUR YEAH JUST JUST PUSH IT IN FOR THE FOR THREE SECONDS OR SOMETHING AND THEN YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
UM IT SHOWS THE RELEVANT AND MOST USED FUNCTIONS 
YEAH UH IN THE OTHER UH IN ONE SIDE I WOULD SAY YES AND THE OTHER SIDE I WOULD SAY NO 
SO IT'S I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
WITH THE SCROLL BUTT YEAH AND THEN SAY CHANNEL 
AND THEN 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT BUT HOW DO YOU CHANGE FROM VOLUME TO CHANNEL 
NO 
NO WE HAVE NO WE HAVE NO BUTTONS LEFT 
SO THE JOYSTICK WAS NOT AN OPTION 
SO SO YOU HAVE SO YOU YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE CLICK I MEAN 
FOR I MEAN UH VOLUME AND THREE DOUBLE CLICK FOR THE MENU OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
BUT BUT EASE OF US WAS NOT VERY IMPORTANT MAY I REMIND YOU 
SO THAT'S YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S NOT A QUESTION 
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOWS THE RELEVANT AND MOST USED FUNCTIONS 
WELL I THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH ON THE MIDDLE 
YOU HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THEM IN IN THE ON THE S IN THE SCREEN ON THE MENU 
SO 
SO MAYBE IT'S MORE LIKE A OF A FIVE 
OR 
YEAH 
FIVE OR SIX 
FIVE 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
UH THE THE REMOTE CONTROL MAKES USE OF TECHNOLOG TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION LIKE L. C. D. SCREEN AND SPEECH RECOGNITION 
WELL YEAH BUT WE DROPPED THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
BUT IT HAS TO LAST ONE INNOVATION 
I SAY TWO THEN 
YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THIS QUESTION 
UH THE UH THAT'S THE OTHER QUESTION 
THIS ONE 
TWO YEAH 
I THINK L. C. D. 'S MORE USEFUL THAN SPEECH WHAT 
UH NOT THE BOLD ONE 
RIGHT 
OKAY IT HAS A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL BY USING FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRINTS PRIMARY COLOURS AND SPONGE LIKE MATERIAL 
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TWO QUESTIONS 
I REALISE NOW BECAUSE SPONGE LIKE MATERIAL IS DROPPED 
BUT THE LOOK AND FEEL 
YEAH 
THE BUTTON HAS ALSO COLOUR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE ONE 
MM MM 
YEAH WE HAVE SINGLE CURVE NOW AND ONE AND IN MATERIAL 
SO MAYBE IN THE MIDDLE OR SOMETHING 
YEAH I MEAN IT'S 
WORTH THE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO DROP THE SCREEN 
UH RUUD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I LIKE BOLD 
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL DISPLAYS THE CORPORATE LOGO 
YEAH 
YOU JUST HAVE TO DRAW IT 
YEAH 
BUT THERE'S UH ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE CORPORATE LOGO 
I MEAN IF THERE'S ONLY ONE THING 
YEAH 
SO I WILL SAY THAT IS VERY TRUE 
YEAH 
THE REMOTE CONTROL IS EASY TO USE 
WELL I WOULD SAY SKILL UH I WOULD SAY SIX OR SOMETHING 
I DON'T THINK IT'S EASY TO USE OR NOT SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT IT IT HAS A NICE SCREEN 
BUT YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I I WOULD SAY A FIVE OR A SIX 
WHAT DO YOU SAY 
EASY TO USE 
FIVE OR A SIX 
IS A SIX MORE 
YEAH UH I WOULD GO FOR THE SIX TO 
SO 
UM WELL ANOTHER QUESTION UH THE REMOTE CONTROL IS DURABLE 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE CORRECT WORD 
BUT UH 
ONE IS BOTH BATTERY AS CASING 
YEAH 
TRUE TRUE 
AND THE CASING IS PLASTIC 
YEAH 
IF YOU DON'T DROP IT TOO MUCH IT'S UH SHOULD LAST PRETTY LONG 
YEAH 
BUT UH I THINK RUBBER COMPARED IS BETTER 
SO I THINK A TWO IS MORE APPROPRIATE 
THEN 
YEAH 
LOGO 
OKAY I WILL GO GO FOR TWO 
UH THE LAST ONE 
THE REMOTE CONTROL'S A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR COMPANY'S MOTTO WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
UH TURN AROUND 
YEAH 
BUT UM 
YEAH 
IT'S NOT 
YEAH TRUE 
IS A FOUR 
IT'S TO GO TO GO GOES IT'S NOT THE BEST WE COULD DO I GUESS 
BUT AT ALL HAS TO DO WITH THE BUDGET BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT THE BAD IDEA WE HAD SO 
ALRIGHT YEAH 
RIGHT 
SO IF I UNDERSTOOD IT RIGHT WE HAVE TO COUNT THESE NUMBERS 
OH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OH 
OH ALRIGHT 
WORD DOCUMENT THE YEAH WE HAVE TO COUNT THEM 
OH 
YEAH JUST ADD THEM AND THEN UH DIVIDE THEM 
YEAH 
MM 
I ALL MADE IT UP I I ALL MADE IT I ALL MADE IT POSSIBLE UH FOR A POSITIVE QUESTIONS SO WE CAN COUNT IT 
I MEAN IF YOU HAVE REVERSED QUESTION YOU HAVE TO REVERSE THE SCALE UH YES 
YEAH 
THANKS 
UH SAY 
QUESTION NUMBER FOUR YEAH 
YEAH 
HOW HARD IS IT 
YEAH JUST USE UH THERE THE UH THERE'S NO NO THERE'S NO NUM PADS 
IT'S A IT'S A BIT UH 
YEAH 
I THINK YOU CAN JUST COUNT THEM BY A UM LET'S MOVE OVER 
THREE PLUS ONE FOR 
NINE 
OH YEAH 
OR YOU HERE 
ELEVEN 
FIFTEEN 
SIXTEEN YEAH 
NO SIXTEEN 
UH SIXTEEN PLUS SIX 
TWENTY TWO 
TWENTY TWO YEAH 
TWO 
TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT 
TWEN UH OKAY 
BY NINE 
THAT'S UH THERE UH ARE L LESS THAN A THREE 
YEAH 
TWENTY EIGHT 
DI DIVIDED BY NINE MAKES THREE POINT NO NO NO NO NO NO NO 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THERE ARE NO NEGATIVE QUESTIONS I GUESS 
GOOD EXAMPLE 
DURABLE USE 
EASY TO USE 
THIS IS GOOD 
FANCY LOOK AND FEEL THAT'S GOOD 
TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION WAS GOOD BECAUSE OF A MARKETING UH REQUIREMENT 
ARE RELEVANT MOST USED FUNCTION 
AND HIDES THESE FUNCTIONS 
THAT WAS ALSO A GOOD THING 
AND THEN MATCHES THE PRO OF THE USER WAS ALSO A GOOD THING 
SO IT WERE ALL POSITIVE QUESTIONS BY UH BY PURPOSE 
SO 
YES SO THE IT TELLS US SOMETHING YES 
BECAU BUT THE PICTURE WOULD BE A LOT DIFFERENT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DROP THIS UH THESE THINGS I GUESS 
YEAH 
NAH IT IT'S IT'S BETTER THAN AVERAGE BUT 
YEAH 
SO THE 
YEAH 
NO 
THE COLOUR AND THE SCREEN 
YEAH WE WE HAVE TO MAYBE IF WE HAVE TO REDESIGN IT IN THIS 
WITH SOME CASING AROUND IT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
DO WE HAVE TO DO OTHER THINGS 
OR JUST REDESIGN 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
SO YOU MADE A START RIGHT 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
THE THE TARGET GROUP HAS A WEAK SPOT FOR FRUIT AND VEGETABLES LIKE PRIMARY COLOURS SPONGY SHAPE 
THE PLAYFULNESS WE DECIDED TO USE KINETIC ENERGY IS A POWER SOUR 
OKAY 
THAT'S CONCEPTUAL YES 
MM 
HOW MANY PAGES 
ALRIGHT 
YOU YOU HAVE YOU HAVE DONE THE FIRST TWO 
OKAY AND AND THE LOOK AND FEEL IS 
YEAH 
THE TIMES WE HAD TO DROP 
WHERE DID WE START WITH PRICE 
TWENTY SIX AND A HALF 
OR NOT 
OR TWENTY SIX 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

SPECKLES 
OH

JUST COMPARE UH 
NO IT'S IN THE ON THE BEAMER I GUESS 
YEAH 
STRANGE 
THIS SOMETHING WHAT'S PROJECTION FROM BEHIND I GUESS 
YEAH IT IT'S A BEAMER BUT THEN WITH A WITHIN A MIRROR YEAH 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG SCREEN BUT IN FACT IT ISN'T 
WELL IT'S IT'S SINGLE SINGLE CURVED 
TH THIS IS FLAT 
YEAH 
BUT IT'S IT'S BETTER TO HAVE ON THE FRONT THIS KIND OF SHAPE BECAUSE IT LOOKS NICE 
I MEAN YOU USE MORE OF THIS THEN IF THAT 
YEAH MORE LIKE THAT 
IT'S NOT VERY UH IDEAL 
DO LIKE THIS 
YEAH 
WHAT'S THIS 
OH 
BUT I DON'T USE A DETECTOR OVER THERE 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A KIND OF THING TO PUT IT ON AND THEN DRAW RIGHT LINES OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
OR JUST MISSED IT UP 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT IT WASN'T GOOD 
YEAH IT IT HAS TO TOUCH THE CORNERS I GUESS 
BUT TH THIS ONE WASN'T GOOD BECAUSE IF I WAS DRAWING HERE I DRAW A LINE AND THEN IT CAME OVER HERE 
OH 
OH 
YEAH YEAH IT'S IT'S OKAY 
IT'S WORKING AGAIN 
IT'S BETTER THAN BEFORE

THE PROCESS I MEAN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN US BECAME BETTER AND BETTER I GUESS 
YEAH ESPECIALLY IF IF IF IF YOU USE UH YOU SEE YOU SAW THE LARGEST DIFFERENCE FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND MEETING I GUESS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LI LIMITEDED AFTERWARDS BUT 
IF IF YOU DON'T TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR CREATIV CREATIVITY 
ALSO NOT ONLY THE DRAWING AND THE THE MAKING OF THE THING ITSELF BUT ALSO IN EXPLAINING IT AT THE OTHER PEOPLE BY MEANS OF UH 
THE THE BOARD AND UH POWERPOINT AND WORD AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
MM UH I THINK IN IN ESSENCE 
THE DIGITAL PEN IS BETTER THAN THE SMARTBOARD 
BECAUSE IT IT IT JUST WORKS BETTER 
I MEAN UH UH I'VE MADE YEAH UH I'VE MADE SEVERAL NOTES JUST TO TEST IT 
AND AND JUST PUT THE PEN IN INTO IT AND THEN IT CAME INTO MY SCREEN AND IT LOOKED PERFECTLY 
SO IT IT'S BETTER A BETTER DEVICE THAN UH 
THEN THE SCREEN 
BUT THE SCREEN IS USEFUL IN ESSENCE BUT IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL 
YEAH 
YEP 
WARNING 
FINISH MEETING NOW 
WELL IT IT'S S ESPECIALLY USEFUL I GUESS IT TO EVALUATE DESIGNS AND GRAPH GRAPHICAL STUFF

DON'T CHOOSE FOR YOUSELF 
THAT'S SELFISH 
OKAY NOW WE'RE GONNA DIG INTO THE AT THE SERIOUS STUFF 
UH THE SELLING PRICE FOR THE REMOTE WILL BE UH TWENTY FIVE EURO AND THE PRODUCTION COST UH MAY NOT BE MORE THAN UH TWENTY AND A HALF EURO 
SO UH FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I DON'T THINK IT'S UH GONNA BE VERY UH VERY HIGH TECH HIGH DEFINITION 
UH ULTRA MODERN UH KINDA REMOTE FOR TWELVE UH FIFT UH TWELVE AND A HALF EURO 
UH THE PROFIT WE MUST MAKE WITH UH THE NEW REMOTE IS UH FIFTY MILLION 
OR 
SO THAT'S A LOT 
WE HAVE TO SELL UH A LOT OF UH 
UH I THINK UH W WHEN THE SELLING PRICE IS TWENTY FIVE UH UH YOU GOT TWO MILLION TWO MILLION REMOTES 
BUT OUR MARKETING RANGE IS UH MARKET RANGE IS INTERNATIONAL 
SO WE HAVE UH VIRTUALLY THE WHOLE WORLD WE CAN SELL UH 
WE CAN SELL OUR OUR REMOTES OUT 
AT LEAST THAT UH COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE UH A TELEVISION 
UM 
SO NOW IT'S TIME UH FOR US TO UH GOING UH TO DISCUSS A LITTLE UH THINGS 
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT UH EXPERIENCE WITH A REMOTE CONTROL UH YOURSELF AT HOME 
WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE UH A USEFUL UH NEW FEATURE 
WHAT UH WHAT CAN DISTINGUISH OUR NEW TRENDY REMOTE CONTROL FROM ALL THE OTHERS 
UM SO UH LET'S UH LET'S UH DISCUSS A LITTLE 
I'M GONNA JOIN YOU TO THE TABLE 
WELL WHAT WHAT'S THE MOST UH IMPORTANT THING TO A REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
IS NOT A NOT A REMOTE CONTROL WHO UH UH WHICH CAN UH CAN BE USED FOR TELEVISION AND A D. V. D. AND RED AND OR JUST ONLY 
IF YOU HAVE THEM IN UH I CAN UH 
OKAY 
UH IN CASE YOU WANT IT 
THIS IS A DEAD KIND OF FLY 
BETWEEN THE THE THE YEAH THE THE UH

OKAY 
FIVE MINUTES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO TO BE UH A MULTI PURPOSE UH VERY TECHNICALLY UH HIGH UH 
REMOTE 
YEAH IT MUST BE REALLY UH INNOVATIVE TECHNICAL WISE 
YEAH 
SO YEAH I I AGREE WITH YOU 
SO WE MUST FOCUS ON THINGS WHO ARE REALLY UH REALLY ADD SOMETHING TO UH IT 
YEAH 
NO 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN YOU THAT IT'S UH AT THE BEGINNING OF SUCH A PROJECT 
IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY UH COOL TO TALK ABOUT WELL THIS WOULD BE COOL THAT WOULD BE COOL 
UH BUT WE MUST NOT UH ALSO UH SIGHT OF THE THE USER UH UH FRIENDLY UH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE HIM 
OKAY UH NEXT MEETING WILL START IN THIRTY MINUTES 
SO UH YOU UH WILL HAVE UH INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS WHERE I PRESUME UH WILL BE SOME FEEDBACK UH V THE UM THE EMAIL 
UM THE THE THE INDUSTRIAL UH DESIGNER HAS TO UH LOOK AT THE WORKING DESIGN 
UH THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER HAS TO LOOK AT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
SO THAT'S THE THING WE UH DISCUSSED 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM WHO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT MAYBE BECAUSE UH YOU ARE WORKING ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS YOU ARE WORKING ON THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
WE UH MOST UH HAVE A LITTLE OR KINDA HO HO HO HOW DO YOU CALL IT 
OH 
UH A LITTLE PLAN ON ON WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO 
SO YOU DON'T UH UH COME UP WITH THE USER REQUIREMENTS WHO DON'T FIT THE THE THE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS AT ALL 
SOME BASIC THINGS WE C WE WANT IT GOING TO DO 
UH I THINK THAT'S WELL UH YEAH 
WELL COME IN HANDY 
OKAY 
W HE SAYS 
YEAH 
WELL TH THAT'S THAT'S REALLY A STEP FURTHER 
BUT IF YOU SAY UH IS IT UH UH NO WAY OR MULTI PURPOSE THAT'S A 
WHY 
WHY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO UH EACH INDIVIDUALLY I INDIVIDUALLY UH MUST THINK ONE WHAT'S UH TO UH HIS POINT OF VIEW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
AND UH THEN WE'RE GOING TO FIT UH ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER THE NEXT MEETING 
I MUST FINISH OFF NOW SO IT'S OVER 
YOU UH WILL RECEIVE SPECIFIC SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS UH BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH 
AND I SEE YOU IN UH THIRTY MINUTES 
THANK YOU 
BE CAREFUL 
OH 
MORNING 
OH MY NAME'S UH 
I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
BY THE WAY WHY WAS YOUR CAT UH RUUD 
OH OKAY 
OH YEAH SURE 
NO IT'S A TURTLE 
MUST BE A DOG 
YEAH 
OH 
HMM 
YEAH SURE 
OH THANKS 
I FIGURE I SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING MUCH MORE DIFFICULT 
EXACTLY 
OH 
YES 
NO 
NO 
YEAH EXACTLY 
SO 
UH I FIGURED THIS IS A PRETTY BE GOOD IMPRESSION OF A RABBIT 
UH UH 
UH WELL 
WHERE DOES THE PEN GO 
JUST UH 
UH I FIGURED THE RABBIT WAS ACTUALLY THE MOST UH IMPRESSIVE 
OH SORRY 
TWENTY MILLION 
TWO MILLION OH YEAH TWO MILLION 
YEAH 
AND AND HIM 
I FIGURE WE COULD GET BACK TO IT IN THE NEXT MEETING ACTUALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH ACTUALLY TO USE 
THEN LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A F STEP FURTHER 
YEAH WE CAN TAKE IT FROM THERE 
YEAH I AGREE UH WE CAN TAKE IT FROM THERE 
OR DATA 
OKAY CHEERS 
OH 
OH 
GOOD MORNING 
I'M JUERGEN TOFFS 
I'M THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
OUCH 
OOPH 
VERY ARTISTIC 
OKAY 
WOW 
UH DOES HAVE BODY UH 
HUH 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE COLOUR AND THE PEN WIDTH DURING UH THE DRAWING 
OR 
YOU HAVE TO DRAW UH PUSH HARD ON THE PEN OR UH 
OH 
UH HMM 
OKAY 
OH 
IT'S A VERY BLOODY CAT 
IT'S A FROG 
UH IT'S AN APPLE 
A DOG 
HUH 
UH IT IS A TURTLE 
IT'S UH INSIDE ITS SHELL 
YOU'LL BE UH FINISHED SOONER 
WOW 
YES 
OKAY 
WHA THANK YOU 
YEAH 
UM 
HOW DID IT WORK 
PERFORMANCE 
AND A PEN 
UM 
WELL VERY GOOD 
I JUST UH THOUGHT I'D PICK THE EASIEST ONE 
WELL WE HAD A DOG A FEW YEARS AGO 
AND AND IT YEAH WHEN IT DID WE DIDN'T GET A NEW ONE OR SOMETHING 
BUT UH 
UH A GRAPHICAL USER DESIGNER SO 
HEY 
OH 
NO 
CAN WORK TOGETHER 
UH COLOUR 
WELL IT'S OKAY 
YEAH 
UH UH 
UH UH IS THE ARTISTIC DESIGN 
REMOTE CONTROL ANIMAL 
WELL WITH THE INTERFACE IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO UH TO DRAW HERE AND DISPLAY THERE UH 
THEN ON THE WITH YEAH I AM I MEAN LIKE UH LIKE AN HOUR DRAWING DRAWING UH 
AND THEN DISPLAYING ON SCREEN BUT 
TOO EXPENSIVE YEAH 
A GREEN RABBIT 
THERE THE G WHITE GREEN RABBIT 
HE'S A LITTLE BIT STONED THERE 
YEAH HOW MUCH AS IT 
HUNDRED MILLION UH REMOTES OR SOMETHING 
OH YEAH 
UM WELL I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF A REMOTE CONTROL IS THAT YOU CAN SWITCH CHANNELS 
AND MY OPINION IS YOU SHOULD KEEP IT IS BASIC AS POSSIBLE 
OH 
SO IT POSSIBLE TO PAN PEN DRAWINGS ON THIS UH IN THIS SCREEN 
UH BUT UM WHICH THE ONES WE MADE IN THE 
UH ONLY ONE WORD OKAY 
FOR WHAT PURPOSE 
WE 
AND AND THE PRICE 
OKAY 
AND HIM 
YEAH 
UM ONE THING UH WE MUST FIRST AGREE ON UH WHAT WE'RE GOING TO UM GOING TO MAKE 
DO WE ARE WE GOING TO USE UM IT IT FOR MULTIPLE SYSTEMS 
OR UH WE SHOULD HAVE SOME AGREEMENT ON THAT BEFORE WE 
OKAY 
OH OKAY 
CONSENSUS ON THE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO 
YEAH 
WELL YEAH OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS HAVE TO BE DESIGNED I I'VE GOTTA KNOW FOR WHAT KIND OF MACHINES THEY WILL BE 
OR DO WE USE IT A TEXT SCREEN 
OR UH WELL TO BE WITH UH WITH BLUETOOTH OR 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
SORRY 
YES 
YEAH 
NO 
COME UP 
GOOD MORNING 
BY BIG BROTHER 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OF OUR FACES 
I'M UH TIME 
UM MY FUNCTION IS THE MARKETING EXPERT 
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF 
I HAVE A QUESTION 
UM THIS EXERCISE UM DID THE COMPANY BOARD TELL YOU TO DO IT OR UH DID YOU JUST MAKE IT UP YOURSELF 
IT'S PART OF THE INTRODUCTION OKAY 
OKAY 
UM YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW REALLY HOW IT WORKS 
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN SHOW US FIRST 
YOU GO YOU GET ELECTROCUTED OR 
IT'S LIKE PICTIONARY 
THE THE ONE WHO SAYS IT FIRST GETS A EUROS 
IT'S A PORK 
MM YEAH I HAVE TO TO HIM 
WHAT'S IT CALLED 
OH 
MINIATURE SIZE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WE HAVE TO SPEED UP 
REMEMBER YOU USE UH DIFFERENT COLOURS AND DIFFERENT PEN WIDTHS 
I OKAY 
SAVE IT 
YOU HAVE TO SAVE IT 
I'VE DONE IT 
NOW 
'KAY 
MM UH 
NOT REALLY 
UM 
THAT ONE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OPEN 
WHICH ONE IS IT 
SMART BOARD 
OKAY 
AND NOW 
OKAY 
OKAY THANKS 
'KAY I'VE SPEED UP 
'KAY THAT'S FINE 
LINE WIDTH 
IT'S NOT AN APPLE 
HMM 
COLOUR 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
SMALLER 
UM 
'CAUSE I LIKED TEENAGE MUTANT HERO TURTLES 
OH 
NO IT'S UH 
NO NO 
IT'S COMING UP 
MM 
OH 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
OKAY YOU KNOW VERY ARTISTIC 
YEAH 
HERE YOU GO 
UH THE BIG LINES WERE LIKE NINE 
UH IT'S UP 
IT'S PRETTY GOOD UH 
AN ARTIST 
THANK YOU UH PICKED THE WRONG UH FUNCTION 
WRONG JOB 
WOAH 
THAT'S ENOUGH THANKS 
I WONDER 
I'M GONNA DESIGN A REMOTE UH REMOTE CONTROL ANIMAL 
OH 
SORRY 
YEAH 
THAT THAT MIGHT BE EASIER 
BUT AT THE OTHER HAND UH A PEN LIKE THAT IS EASY TO HOLD ON YOUR HAND AND 
I THINK IT'S EASIER TO DRAW 
YEAH 
WITH A PEN THAN WITH A MOUSE MOUSE 
MOUTH 
OH OKAY 
YEAH 
W WITH THIS PAPER IT'S TO ME TOO EXPENSIVE 
IT'S A RABBIT WITH UH BROKEN LEGS 
YEAH 
IT WILL DO 
PROJECT MANAGER 
OH 
HAVE YOU BEEN UH COUNTING THE TIME 
OKAY 
LET'S GO ON THEN 
IT'S PRETTY ABSTRACT 
LIKE HOW MUCH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK SO 
UH BUT I HAVE SOME POINTS 
CAN I SHOW THEM IN THE ON THE BIG SCREEN 
MAYBE 
YEAH 
YEAH I CAN FIND UH 
SCREEN 
OKAY 
OKAY I HAVE SOME UH POINTS FROM MARKETING POINT OF VIEW 
UM JUST THE STANDARD THING LI THINGS LIKE UH INITIATIVE UH SMALL FAIRLY CHEAP 
UH IT'S PRETTY CHEAP TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
UH BRAND INDEPENDENT 
UM I THINK IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MATTER UH WHICH BRAND YOUR T. V. OR OTHER THING IS 
UM 
FIVE MINUTES 
OKAY I'LL WRAP IT UP QUICKLY 
UM I PERSONALLY THINK IT HAS TO BE MULTI PURPOSE 
UH MOST OF THE REMOTE C UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE UH JUST FOR ONE PURPOSE 
AND UH BY MAKING IT MULTI PURPOSE TO UH HAS A NEW FEATURE ADDS A NEW FEATURE TO THE MARKET AND DISTINGUISH FROM UH FROM CURRENT PRODUCTS 
UM MAYBE SOME OTHER TECHNOLOGY THAN INFRARED 
UH I RATHER FIND IT VERY ANNOYING UM LIKE WHEN SOMEONE IS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE T. V. THEN YOU CAN'T SWITCH IT 
UM THINK ABOUT UM SENDING IT OVER RADIO WAVES OR BLUETOOTH 
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT UH EXPENSIVE 
UM 
AND SOMETHING LIKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
UM UH LIKE I SAID HERE UM 
MAYBE IT'S EASY 
IT'S NICE AS AN ADDED FEATURE FEATURE THAT UM 
WHEN YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN CHANNEL YOU CAN SEE IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN UH WHAT PROGRAMMES ARE COMING UP OR 
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW YEAH 
YEAH IT HAS TO BE UH 
YEAH OUR COMPANY IS VERY UH 
GOOD IN MAKING NEW INNOVATIVE UH THINGS 
SO I I I I 
AT THE CURRENT MARKET 
LIKE YOU GOT SOME CHEAP UH REMOTE CONTROLS THERE 
THEY JUST UH 
YEAH YOU GOT A DOZEN OF 'EM 
BUT WHEN YOU ENTER A NEW MARKET WITH A REMOTE CONTROL AND 
UH WANNA GAIN MARKET SHARE 
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL I THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH OF COURSE 
BUT IT'S ABOUT ABOUT THIS IS JUST FROM MARKETING UH ASPECT 
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT USER INTERFACE OUR DESIGN 
MM UH I I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO BE WE HAVE TO AGREE ON THAT 
OH 
I THINK TH THAT'S A PHA YEAH 
THAT'S A PHASE FURTHER 
JU JUST UH 
MAKE SOME MOCK UPS SOME SOME GENERAL IDEAS 
AND AND THEN WE CAN PLAN 
YEAH 
WE CAN PLAN FURTHER I THINK 
MM YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
YOU DECIDE 
YOU'RE THE PROJECT MANAGER 
UH TH THAT'S A SAME STEP FURTHER 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH 
LIKE WE ALL HAVE A LIST OF UH THINGS THAT HAS TO BE THAT HAVE TO BE ON IT OR HOW IT HAS TO BE LIKE 
AND THEN ON THE NEXT MEETING WE DECIDE 
W WHAT IT'S GONNA BE 
A 
AND THEN YOU SO THEN YOU CAN DELETE UH 
THE O THE ABSOLUTE UH DETAILS 
I THINK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
DAMN 
SUCCESS 
HELLO 
OH 
YEAH 
IT'S TOO BEAUTIFUL 
A MINUTE PLEASE MY UH LAPTOP IS UH UH THERE IT IS THANK YOU 
SO WELCOME BACK 
AT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING UM 
THE PLAN IS UH THAT UH EACH ONE OF YOU 
IS NOT UM BUT ONLY YOU UH WELL UH PRESENT UH THE THE THINGS YOU WORKED ON UH THE LAST UH HALF HOUR 
I WILL UH TAKE MINUTES AND WILL PUT UH THE MINUTES THAT I HAVE UH AT THE END OF THE SESSION IN THE SHARED FOLDER 
ALSO THE MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS SESSION ARE ALSO IN THE SHARED FOLDER NOW SO YOU CAN READ THAT UH NOW OR AFTERWARDS 
UM 
UH I HAD AN EMAIL FROM THE FROM THE MANAGEMENT BOARD UH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU A AL ALSO UH RECEIVED IT 
BUT THERE WERE FOUR POINTS UH WHICH UH I THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT 
FIRST ONE IS UH THEY THINK THAT UH TELETEXT TELETEXT BECOMES OUTDATED UH AND INTERNET WILL BE THE THE MENU UH FOCUS 
UH SECOND ONE IS ALSO IMPORTANT UH BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE DISCUSSION POINTS OF THE PREVIOUS SESSION 
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOU SHOULD ONL ONLY BE USED FOR THE TELEVISION 
SO IT UH NOT GONNA IT'S NOT GONNA BE A MULTI PURPOSE REMOTE CONTROL IS UH THAT'S ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND 
UH SECOND AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE MARKETING UH EXPERT 
UH THE CURRENT UH CUSTOMERS UH ARE IN THE AGE GROUP GROUP OF UH FORTY YEARS AND OLDER 
BUT WITH THIS UH NEW REMOTE UH THEY UH WELL UH WOULD LIKE TO REACH UH A GROUP UH YOUNGER THAN UH FORTY 
UH AND UH I THINK TO KEEP IN MIND 
BUT NOT REALLY UH FOR NOW IS THAT THEY UH WANT THE THE THE SLOGAN AND THE AND THE LOGO UH TO UH TO BE RECOGNISED MORE ON THE REMOTE 
SO WE HAVE UH FORTY MINUTES SO I THINK UH NOT MORE THAN TEN MINUTES UH UH PR PRESENTATION UH EACH 
AND PLUS UH SO UH ALL THE THE THE FACILITIES SO THAT YOU HAVE EITHER SMARTBOARDS THE THE WORD FILES WHAT YOU UH WHATEVER YOU WANT 
SO UH 
TIM CAN YOU START 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT IT'S STRANGE THAT THE THE MANAGE BOARD THE MANAGEMENT BOARD SAID THAT THE TELETEXT WILL BE UH OUTDATED BY THE INTERNET 
SO THAT THAT'S STRANGE 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S A COOL IDEA 
YEAH 
THANK YOU TIM 
JANUS CAN YOU UH 
OKAY THANK YOU JANUS 
YOU DO 
THE LAST PRESENTATION 
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TIME AND UH JANUS DON'T UH TALK TO TEN MINUTES SO UH TAKE YOUR TIME 
IF YOU TAKE YOUR TIME TOO LONG I WILL UH EVENTUALLY UH 
WARN YOU 
UH Y YOU JUST SAID UM UH YOU WANTED TO TO COMBINE MORE FUNCTIONS IN ONE IS UH Y YOU WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE 
BUT I THINK THAT IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT 
THEN YOU CAN'T ESCAPE THE THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE BUTTONS UH WHICH GIVE US UH MORE OPTIONS THAN ONE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
SO YOU THINK IT'S WILL BE BETTER TO HAVE A T KINDA TOTAL TOUCH SCREEN 
JIRUN 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
BUT LET'S NOT UH GO TO WOOD BUT TH THESE THINGS THAT'S THAT WHY WE'RE HERE 
IT'S IT'S A NICE IDEA BUT I THINK THAT'S WE WEL LATER ON THE STAGE 
I'VE ONE LITTLE QUESTION ABOUT UM A TOTAL TOUCH SCREEN OR UH UM A P YEAH A PARTIAL 
UH BECAUSE I THINK UH ELDERLY PEOPLE MAY BE UH NOT USED TO UH A TOUCH SCREEN 
SO THEY WANT THE THE THE NORMAL FUNCTIONS LIKE TELETEXT VOLUME CHANGING 
UM UH TO BE UH YEAH KINDA TRADITIONALS UH AND UH THE THE THE THE OTHER FUNCTIONS 
THE MORE DIFFICULT FUNCTIONS UH TO BE UH MAYBE IN THE TOUCH SCREEN BUT TO KEEP THIS IS UH NORMAL AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP IT ACCESSIBLE 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
THEY LIKE THE FANCY STUFF YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH 
OKAY SO YOU CAN USE UH THE MINUTES FROM THE SECOND MEETING THIS ONE OR UH ARE DONE 
OH I'VE UH ADDED TH THIS UH FOR THINGS FROM THE MANAGEMENT BOARD JUST TO KEEP IN MIND 
UM EACH TIME I UH I HAD A SORT OF UH SUMMARY ON WHAT YOU TOLD AND UH WHAT YOU PERSONAL THINK 
UH SO THAT CAN BE UH CAN BE READ IT 
UH A OF A FEW THINGS I UH I NOTICED UH WERE UM 
MOMENT 
OH 
UH THE THE THE MAIN POINTS IN UH THIS UH UH IN THIS UH MEETING SO I THINK UH HOW UH IT'S GOING TO LIKE UH WITH UH WE MUST KEEP IT SIMPLE 
BUT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UH HAVE MORE OPTIONS AND HAVE THEM UH HIDDEN OR SOMETHING 
SO THEY DON'T UH YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG UH THING FULL OF UH BUTTONS ARE UH UM AND UH THE POINT THAT UH YOU UH WANNA USE AN UH CONTROLLER UH FOR UH UH HYPOTHETICALLY EACH TELEVISION 
SO YOU MUST UH THE THE THE THE FUNCTIONS KNOW 
LIKE THE MENUS OR THE THE PARENTAL CONTROL MUST BE ALL UH BY THE DONE BY THE REMOTE CONTROL AND NOT BY THE TELEVISION 
I THINK THAT'S THE POINT WHAT UH 
WE DISCUSSED 
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE UH UH N YEAH BUT YOU HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET RANGE SO YOU HAVE I THINK A BIG RANGE OF 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND IT'S NOT TOO COMPLEX TO DO IT 
YEAH 
JUST BUILD IT IN 
YEP 
OKAY 
WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO GO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO YEAH 
IT'S VERY SENSITIVE 
YEAH 
OKAY WELL UH IT'S ALMOST AT THE END 
SO WE HAVE NOW A LUNCH BREAK FINALLY YEAH 
UH AFTER THE LUNCH BREAK UH IT'S BACK TO UH INDIVIDUAL WORK ONCE AGAIN UH THIRTY MINUTES 
UH I WILL PUT MY MINUTES UH I HAVE UPDATED THEM IS UH SO THEY'RE UPDATED IN THE SHARED FOLDER TOO 
THIRTY MINUTES THE 
FAILURE 
UH UH THE SPECIFI UH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE NEXT UH MEETING YOU WILL ALL WILL RECEIVE UH AT THE UH THE THE EMAIL 
I DON'T THINK I CAN UH SAY MUCH ABOUT IT 
SO UH OH WAIT FOR YOUR EMAIL AND UH HOPEFULLY YOU GET IT DONE UH IN THE ON THE THIRTY MINUTES 
AND I W WELL AS YOU AFTER THE LUNCH BREAK AND THE THIRTY MINUTES 
YEAH 
UH WELL UH THIRTY MINUTES 
OH YEAH 
THIRTY MINUTES LUNCH BREAK YEAH 
OH 
FORTY FIVE 
UH THEN WOULD TO BE UH ONE O'CLOCK 
ARE WE WE ASK OUR PERSONAL COACH 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
THANK YOU UH THAT WAS A VERY UH GOOD SESSION I THINK WE UH W 
UH YOU WILL 
YEAH BECAUSE UH ALL UH THINGS ARE UH STORED IN SMART BOARD DOT UH X. D. K. AND THAT'S ONE 
NO 
WELL I CAN I CAN UH 
YOU ALL UH HAVE THE THE QUESTIONNAIRE AGAIN BUT UH THE FUTURE WORK 
DESKT HUH 
NO 
PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH 
OKAY THANK YOU 
UH WELL IT'S IT'S SIMPLY FILLING OH NO IT'S UH IT'S ALSO FILLING OUT IN I'D DO IT AFTER LUNCH I THINK 
I'M HUNGRY SO DO IT AFTER LUNCH 
THANK YOU ALL 
YOU'RE WELCOME 
YEAH 
WELL I BRING IT TO MY UH PERSONAL ROOM 
MY EXECUTIVE UH BIG ROOM WITH THE WITH THE PAINTING 
OH 
I SEE MY BUNNY IS STILL STANDING 
NO NO DRAWING IT 
UH I FIGURED UH THAT MUCH 
WHEN YOU MENTIONED UH IMPROVING FUNCTIONS WHAT UH WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU THINK ABOUT 
UH THE FUNTIONABILITY 
OH OKAY SO FOCUSING MORE ON THE SIDE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
COULD YOU USE PERHAPS UH ONE BUTTON FOR MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS LIKE EXAMPLE PRESSING IT IN LONGER MAKES IT SWITCH IT IN DIFFERENT FUNCTION FOR EXAMPLE 
THANK YOU 
YEAH UM PERHAPS JUST JUST AN IDEA 
YEAH 
OH YEAH YEAH I'LL GO SURE 
RIGHT UH I'LL BE UH EXPLAINING A BIT ABOUT UH WORKING DESIGN BUT UH THE PROJECT 
WELL UH WHAT I DID WAS I DISSECTED UH UH CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS AND UM I VIEWED HOW HOW THEY WE LOOKED 
HOW THEY WORKED UH WHAT KIND OF COMPONENTS ARE INVOLVED AND HOW THEY ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER 
AND UH AFTER THAT I PUT UP A SCHEME ABOUT HOW UH THESE THINGS ARE ORGANISED AND I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU IN IN A IN A FEW SECONDS 
AND I'LL EXPLAIN A BIT ABOUT UH HOW IT WORKS AND HOW WE COULD UH BUILD IN AND WHY I THINK SEVERAL POSSIBILITIES UH THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE EARLIER MEETING FALLS OFF 
UM RIGHT 
UH WELL WHAT I DID WAS UH I I CHECKED UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND THE UH REMOTE CONTROLS OF TODAY ARE ALL INFRARED NOT LIKE ALL PROBABLY KNOW 
AND THE THING ABOUT THAT IS UM THE REMOTE CONTROLS UH HAVE TO CUT AS A T. V. OR UH A STEREO OR SOMETHING 
AND THIS UH HAVE A TRANSMITTER THAT'S ALSO FOCUSED ON INFRARED 
SO IF WE WANT TO UH BUILD UH MM A REMOTE CONTROL UH WITH BLUETOOTH FOR INSTANCE THEN UH THE T. V. SHOULD HAVE BLUETOOTH IT IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE 
SO THAT WOULD MEAN EXTRA COST FOR THE USER AND THIS UH THAT'S THAT WOULDN'T MEAN A A CHIP UH REMOTE CONTROL FOR US 
SO THAT'S PROBABLY WHY MOST CONTROLS ARE STILL INFRARED 
FURTHERMORE THEY ALL HAVE UH A A VERY SIMPLE STRUCTURE 
SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY UH MEAN LOWER COSTS AND UH I THAT COULD MEAN FOR US A GOOD THING UH 'CAUSE UH WELL WE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD A RELATIVELY CHEAP UH A CHIP UH REMOTE 
WELL UH SO I MENTIONED READY WE HAVE SOME BLUETOOTH WELL IT MAY BE POSSIBLE BUT UH I FIGURED IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE IN WITHIN OUR BUDGET 
BUT THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE BUT THAT'S MAYBE SOMETHING FOR MARKETING TO LOOK INTO 
F BECAUSE UH WELL MY PERSONAL OPINION IS UH IS NOT TO DO UH BLUETOOTH OR OR RADIO WAVES ALTHOUGH 
YEAH ACTUALLY I HAVE TO 
YEAH 
YEAH I ACTUALLY I FIGURED THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE RATHER NICE BUT THEN YOU'D STILL HAVE THE UH THE INFRARED FUNCTION 
SO IN IN THEORY YOU'D ACTUALLY JUST MOVE THE PROBLEM 
BUT UH WHAT I DID UH THINK ABOUT WAS WHEN YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE UH THE CUP HOLDER 
SO WHY NOT UH INTRODUCE A SPEECH FUNCTION LIKE WHERE IS THE REMOTE 
IF SOMEBODY SAYS WHERE IS THE REMOTE THEN IT GOES UH BEEP UH BEEP BEEP BEEP OR SOMETHING I DUNNO 
MAYBE UH MAYBE SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO I DUNNO UH WHAT THE COST THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE 
BUT IT MAY BE UH MAY BE SOMETHING TO EXPLORE 
UH I'LL I'LL JUST EXPLAIN A BIT OF THE COMPONENTS 
UH FIRST YOU HAVE THE ENERGY SOURCE 
THE ENERGY SOURCE WOULD BE A BATTERY SIMPLE UH BATTERY UH THAT YOU CAN FIND ANYWHERE 
I FIGURED THAT WOULD BE BEST 'CAUSE WHEN THE BATTERY UH STOPS FUNCTIONING UH WE COULD JUST UH SO YOU COULD JUST GO OUT AND BUY A NEW ONE 
SO WE DIDN'T AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL UH TO BE TOO COMPLICATED BUT THAT 
UH THE ENERGY SOURCE IS CONNECTED TO THE INFRARED BUTTON 
BUT UH THE INFRARED BUTTON UH WORKS ONLY VIA THE CHIP AND THE SUBCOMPONENT TO UH THE SWITCH THERE IS A SWITCH UH BETWEEN THIS 
WHEN THE SWITCH IS PRESSED IN A W IN THIS THIS CASE IT SWITCHES A BUTTON 
WHEN A BUTTON IS PRUSH PUSHED IN UH A ELECTRIC CURRENT GOES THROUGH HERE 
AND ONE UH IMMEDIATELY A L A BULB LIGHTS UP UH DISPLAYING TO THE USER THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED 
THAT'S UH THAT'S AS THE UH USER WON'T BE UM THINKING WELL UH DID THE BUTTON BE PRESSED W WHAT HAPPENED UH 
OR I PRESS BUTTON BUT NOTHING'S HAPPENING IN THE T. V. S S S SOMETHING WRONG OR SOMETHING 
SO THAT'S JUST TO UH TO TO EXPLAIN THE IF IT TO UH MAKE IT CLEARER TO THE USER 
UH W WELL THE SIGNAL GOES VIA CHIP THAT'S TRANSLATED INTO UH ELECTRIC SIG UH ELECTRONIC SIGNALS AND THEN IT'S PROCESSED AND THEN IT'S SENT TO THE INFRARED BULB WHERE IT WILL BE UH UH RECEIVED ON THE RECEIVING END 
AND THIS UH INTERPRETED BY THE DEVICE WELL IN THIS CASE THE TELEVISION 
UH WELL MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES HERE WELL WE HAVE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE 
NOT TOO MANY UH GADGETS AND FUNCTIONS 
JUST LIKE YOU SAID UH WELL THE MOST USERS IN UH YOU HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS AND YOU U U USE YOU DON'T USE THEM 
SO WHY WHY SHOULD WE INVENT UH W SPEND MORE TIME IN THIS 
UH I I THINK WE SHOULD STICK BY WITH INFRARED TRANSMITTING AND UH NO RECEIVING 
SO UH AN INPUT FROM THE TELEVISION 
SO I THINK WE SHOULDN'T BE UH SPENDING TIME ON UM TELETEXT AND ST THINGS LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU UH WANT TELETEXT ON UH INFRARED YOU'D HAVE TO BUILD IN A RECEIVER TOO 
AND SO IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE SIGNALS FROM UH WHAT'S ON T. V. AND SUCH 
SO I FIGURE THAT WOULD BE UH SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY AND TIME AND 
YES BUT WHAT SHOULD WE UH SO I I I IF I AGREE WITH YOU 
BUT SHOULD WE SPEND MONEY OR AND TIME ON BUILDING A RECEIVER INTO THE UH REMOTE CONTROL 
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE I MEAN EXTRA COMPONENTS EXTRA DESIGNS UM LARGER G UH REMOTE CONTROL 
THIS ALL UH ALL STUFF THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT 
SO I I MY PERSONAL OPINION IS NO NO NO RECEIVER AT ALL 
UM WELL WE SHOULD UH LOOK INTO THE DESIGN AND THE FUNCTIONABILITY 
LIKE I SAID UH IS ONE BUTTON FOR INSTANCE FOR M MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS 
OR WELL UH JUST HAD THE FEW BUTTONS O OF SWITCHING TO OPEN OR SOMETHING THE USUAL UH STUFF 
AND UH DON'T OVERBUILD WE SHOULDN'T MAKE A BIG UH REMOTE CONTROL FOR SIMPLE FUNCTIONS BUT WE WE SHOULD STICK TO THE BASICS 
SO THAT WAS MY UH MY PERSONAL OPINION 
AND THAT WAS MY UH MY PRESENTATION UH 
YEAH BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT 
YEAH BUT 
WELL YOU DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT UH SEVERAL T. V. S UH DON'T EVEN HAVE A MENU STRUCTURE OR THEY HAVE A VERY SIMPLE MENU STRUCTURE 
SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT NOT ALL UH DO NOT OUR REMOTE WON'T BE ABLE TO WORK ON ALL TELEVISIONS 
AND THAT WOULD BE UH A CONSIDERABLE PROBLEM 
YEAH 
NOT EMBED 
YEAH BUT THEN WITH SOMETHING LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN COULD COULD MAKE MORE MENU UP POP UP OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS 
YEAH 
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO MAKE JUST ONE BIG TOUCH SCREEN 
OH NO NO SMALL UH TOUCH SCREEN UH APPLET AND UH I'LL JUST MAKE UM UH LET'S SAY FIFTEEN BUTTONS ON IT 
AND UH WE HAVE THREE OF THIS UH ACTUALLY JUST UH MEANS WITH SUB MENUS WITH OUR SUB ITEMS SUB FUNCTIONS 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH LIKE LIKE THE IPOD IDEA THAT THAT WE JUST SAW 
YOU JUST HAVE A OF A FEW SELECTED BUTTONS AND UH A FEW MENUS 
AND WITH THIS DO YOU COULD ACTUALLY MAKE UH SEVERAL YOU CAN ALSO IMPROVE UH LATER ON 
UH UH I THINK THAT WILL BE GREAT 
YEAH I W I WOULD ACTUALLY GO FOR THE 
YEAH 
THAT IS POSSIBLE THAT WILL THAT ACTUALLY DEPENDS ON THE TELEVISION BUT I THINK I FIGURE THAT WOULD BE 
WELL Y YOU SEE YOU USE THE F UH THING IS WHEN YOU BUY A REMOTE YOU YOU SET THE UH CHANNELS 
THE THE CHANNELS ARE DIFFERENT IN EACH TE TELEVISION THEY AREN'T SET IN A PRESET ORDER 
SO UH IF YOU UH LACK IN A REMOTE UH LET'S SAY CHANNEL FIFTEEN 
WELL CHANNEL FIFTEEN ON THIS TELEVISION IS DIFFERENT THAN CHANNEL FIFTEEN ON THE OTHER TELEVISION SO THAT WOULD BE UH THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY THE MAIN CONCERN 
YES 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE 
YEAH THAT 
OH 
I I D 
UH I DO AGREE BECAUSE WELL IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME WHEN YOU TOUCH A TOUCH SCREEN OR WHEN YOU TOUCH A BUTTON 
BUT WELL WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S OUR TARGET UH AUDIENCE 
WE WE ARE AIMING FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE AND THEY THEY CHOSE 
SO THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY UH A 
BUT THEY 
WELL THEY UH THEY ALL HAVE TO BE PROGRAMMED TO FIT YOUR T. V. AND THAT THAT IS BIT OF A TRICKY JOB 
I ACTUALLY IS ONE OF THOSE WHEN THEY ARE THEY ARE KINDA KINDA TROUBLESOME 
BUT BUT THE THING IS WHE WHEN YOU UH START UH BUILDING SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU HAVE TO BUILD A RECEIVER INTO THE UH IT INTO THE REMOTES 
BECAUSE UH IN ORDER FOR THE REMOTE TO PROCESS SOMETHING FROM THE T. V. LIKE UH TO SYNCHRONISE AND YOU HAVE TO SEND AND RECEIVE AND THAT'S WELL 
YEAH 
YES 
YEAH 
OH OKAY YEAH SURE UH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OH YEAH YEAH SURE THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE YEAH 
PROFILES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE 
YEAH SURE 
NO THAT WOULDN'T BE UH 
YEAH A FEW VARIABLES 
YEAH 
UH TO USE 
IT IS DEFINITELY UP 
YEAH FIRMWARE UPGRADE 
THAT'S MAYBE THE CUP HOLDER 
YEAH 
WELL NOT EVERYBODY HAS UH HAS UH A P. C. AT HOME 
WELL THE MOST MOST PEOPLE HAVE BUT NOT NOT EVERYBODY AND 
YEAH 
YEAH MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE SERVICE CEN OR YOU COULD WELL YOU COULD USE ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE PLACE HOLDER YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER 
AND YOU COULD PROBABLY UH MAKE A CONNECTION TO UH AN TELEPHONE LINE OR A INTERNET CONNECTION 
YEAH 
WELL THEN THEN IT'S BE UH BACK TO THE BUILDING A RECEIVING UH WELL UH IF IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH IT TO BUILD IT IN 
WE COULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT NOT TOO BUT I DUNNO IT IT WOULD BE UH BRINGING MORE COSTS UH WITH WITH IT AND 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY BEST YEAH 
LIKE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BUY A T. V. YOU JUST ASK WELL I'LL 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE BEST YEAH 
NO NO 
EXACTLY SO 
YEAH MY VOTE GOES TO TO THE RIGHT 
FLIPS OPEN 
EXPERT 
MAYBE NOT EXPORT FUNCTION 
G. YEAH J. PEG 
NO UH 
IT ROOM 
I'LL JUST UH SAVED IN MY DOCUMENTS 
YEAH IN MY OWN UH IN MY OWN MESSENGER 
YEAH 
OKAY NICE 
AYE CHEERS 
OH 
YEAH TRUE 
MM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YES I CAN GO AHEAD 
LAST PRESENTATION 
OKAY 
WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE A PRESENTATION ABUT SOME OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THIS DESIGN AND UH USABILITY FUNCTIONS 
UM WHAT'S MY OPINION ABOUT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO COMBINE THE DESIGN 
TECHNICAL POSSIBILITIES AND THE USER FRIENDLINESS IN ONE IS IF YOU UM GOING TO DESIGN A REMOTE THAT LOOKS GOOD 
THAT SHOULDN'T WEIGH OVER THE UH IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE OF COURSE BUT ALSO THE USER FRIENDLINESS SO THA THAT'S THAT'S SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS 
AND ANOTHER ONE IS UM THE SO UM OF MANY FUNCTIONS WILL WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT 
SO SO SO SO LITTLE FUNCTIONS AS POSSIBLE OR AT LEAST DON'T DISPLAY THEM ALL AT ONCE IN THE SAME REMOTE 
IF YOU HAVE FIFTY FUNCTIONS YOU DON'T WANT FIFTY BUTTONS UH TO UH TO BE SHOWN AT THE SAME TIME 
'CAUSE WHEN YOU VISIT AN INTERNET UH SET YOU DON'T WANT FIFTY LINKS UH TO USE BUT MAYBE IS A HIERARCH HIERARCHY UH STRUCTURE 
AND UH WELL ONE OF THE IDEAS WAS MAYBE UH S TOUCH SCREEN BUT SO I DON'T KNOW ON HOW FAR THAT IS POSSIBLE 
SINCE WE ARE STICKING TO UH UM INFRARED AND AND THE REMOTE CANNOT RECEIVE ANYTHING ABOUT UH WE MIGHT UH CONSIDER THAT 
UM WELL OF COURSE I I HOPE THIS IS ALL CLEAR TO YOU 
IF YOU YOU CAN USE REMOTE LIKE THIS WITH ALL THE FUNCTIONS 
MANY FUNCTIONS BUT WELL YOUR THUMB IS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN THE IT THEN THIS 
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT YOU PUSH 
AND UM IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TELETEXT YOU'LL BE UH SEARCHING FOR HALF AN HOUR FROM UH UM YEAH WELL WHERE IS IT 
WHERE THE HELL HE HERE I GUESS AND YEAH WHEN YOU HAVE TO UH IS SOMETHING ELSE 
SO JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE MAKE CLEAR BUTTONS EASY TO USE 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO USE A PLAY AND BACK AND STOP 
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
UM WELL THIS WAS BECAUSE OF OUR LAST DISCUSSION IF MULTIPLE MACHINES ARE USED CREATE EASY SWITCH BETWEEN THE MACHINES BUT UM IT'S NO LONGER UH APPLYING 
WELL YEAH I PREFER TO USE IT ONLY FOR T. V. 
AND UM 
NO UH NOT TO GIVE TOO MANY OPTIONS AND AND IF POSSIBLE UH THE BUTTONS SHOULD GIVE A DR DIRECT ACTION NOT FIRST SELECT 
YEAH AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFICULTIES LIE 
YEAH THIS IS THAT'S THE THING YOU HAVE TO WEIGH AGAINST EACH OTHER 
DO WE WANT TO USE A FEW OPTIONS AND MIGHT NOT BE AS OUR ORIGINAL 
OR UH MULTI PURPOSE AS WE THOUGHT OR DO WE WANT TO USE M MANY BUTTONS 
SO UM WEIGHING THOSE FACTORS 
THE DOESN'T 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WHEN ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAD DO WE WANT TO USE UH A MENU DISPLAY ON THE T. V. 
OR UM DOES HAVE TO F EVERYTHING UH BE ON REMOTES 
'CAUSE IF YOU USE A MEMORY DISPLAY ON THE T. V. 
YOU CAN SIMPLY PUSH UH A MORE MENU AND THEN SELECT THE OPTIONS YOU WANT TO HAVE AND PRESS OKAY 
UH SO THAT'S MY RECOMMENDATION IF YOU SO MANY OPTIONS IN ONE BUTTLE BUTTON 
UM DISPLAY THE MENU ON THE T. V. AND DON'T UM SO COMBINATION OF OUT OF TWO BUTTONS AT THE SAME TIME OR PRESSING BUTTONS THREE TIMES FOR FIVE SECONDS 
SO TOO COMPLICATED FOR MOST USERS 
YEAH THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM 
YES 
SO IF WE HAVE TO STICK WITH CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES AND UH 
UM 
WELL YEAH THE RESTRICTIONS OF WHAT'S UH SO ON THE MARKET TODAY UM YOU SHOULD KEEP IT IS IT THIS 
SO BIG CLEAR BUTTONS 
NOT TOO MANY 
SO MAYBE WE'LL ALSO A FEW OPTION UH OPTIONS BUT I THINK I THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT 
UM 
ESPECIALLY THE IMPORTANT BUTTONS UM IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH CHANNEL CHANGE YOUR VOLUME UH USE TELETEXT 
IT UH IT HAS TO WORK AT ONCE AND MORE ADVANCED OPTIONS MAY BE PUT IT IS SOMEWHERE AWAY ON THE REMOTE 
BEHIND UH A LITTLE UH LITTLE THING OR A TOUCH SCREEN 
AND YEAH IF YOU WANT TO UH UH S PUT ON STAND BY OUR CHANGE THE CHANNEL THAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE POSSIBLE TO DO 
NOT FIRST CHANGE MENU OPTIONS OR SWITCH SOMETHING 
UM WELL YEAH SO YOU ALREADY TOLD GIVE SOME FEEDBACK 
OF THE USER IS PUSHING A BUTTON UH SHOULD KNOW IF THE TELEVISION OR IN AT LEAST REMOTE IS REACTING AND NOT JUST THAT THE BATTERIES MAY BE LOW 
AND UM WELL MY CONCLUSION IS UH SO UH LESS IS MORE KEEP IT SIMPLE 
SO UH MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST USE DOWN ON THE FUNCTIONALITY TO UH TO KEEP IT ACCESSIBLE ON IT BECAUSE YOU ALL KNOW 
IF THERE ARE A LOT OF FUNCTION IN THE THE TELEVISION SOME YOU YOU'LL NEVER KNOW UH AND NEVER USE 
AND THEREFORE IT'S UH IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE VOLUME OR CHANNEL THAT IS ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE AND SAY AND OTHER FUNCTIONS UM THAT ARE NOT AS IMPORTANT UM WELL YOU WE SHOULD CONSIDER JUST NOT USING THEM OR AT LEAST PUTTING THEM SOMEWHERE IN THE REMOTE WHERE THEY'RE NOT IN THE WAY FOR THE FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS 
MAYBE THAT'S AN OPTION 
UM KEEP THE PRIMARY BUTTONS VISIBLE 
UH MAKE A REMOTE THAT FITS EASILY IN THE HANDS AND FOR SOME DESIGN ISSUES UH WELL 
PUT A LOGO ON IT AND MAYBE IS IT UH IN SOME AESTHETIC UH AESTHETIC FORM 
BUT UH THE THE IMPORTANT BUTTONS M MAKE THEM ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE AND PUSHABLE AND COLOUR AND MAYBE IS A TOUCH SCREEN 
OR IF THAT'S UH WILL BECOME TOO DIFFICULT JUST UH 
LIKE TELEVI SOME O OLDER TELEPHONES USE A L UH MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE TO TO FLIP THEM OPEN AND UH JUST EXPAND THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT ARE NORMALLY VISIBLE 
UM 
YEAH 
THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS YOU UH YOU JUST AS A MENU FROM SYSTEM FUNCTIONS ARE TELETEXT FUNCTIONS 
AND YOU JUST CHOOSE ONE AND THEN ALL ALL THE OPTIONS WILL BECOME AVAILABLE AND YOU JUST C S YEAH TO SCROLL THROUGH THEM 
WELL UM THEN I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PROPOSAL 
IF YOU MAKE ONE BIG TOUCH SCREEN 
SO THE SAME CONCEPT IS HERE KEEP THE BUTTONS ALWAYS AVAILABLE AND SO THE LOWER PART OF THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR THE REST 
YEAH 
YES 
OKAY 
OKAY I AGREE BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY ALWAYS M MAKE THE SAME BUTTONS ACCESSIBLE 
SO SO JUST FOR SPECIAL OPTIONS A PART OF THE TOUCH SCREEN 
AND SO UM AN ELDER DESIGNER PICKS UP THE THE OF AN ELDER PARENTS OR GRANDPARENT PICKS UP THE REMOTE FROM THE LITTLE CHILD AND WHO'S ALL IN THE SYSTEMS FUNCTIONS 
YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO TURN OFF THE T. V. OR TO SWITCH THE CHANNEL WITHOUT UM WELL USING ALL THE MENU STRUCTURES TO GET BACK TO THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH WH 
SO THAT POSSIBLE TO USE OR NO 
WELL YEAH WELL DOES IT HAVE IT DEPEND ON THE TELEVISION 
WELL I THINK THAT HE MEANS THAT UM MAYBE BY SOME OPTION UH MAKE SURE THAT UM REMOTE CONTROL AND THE T. V. MATCH 
AND THEN AFTER THAT YOU CAN UM SO SOME S INSERT SOME PASSWORDS AS BEING APPARENT THAT THE CHILDREN CANNOT USE THIS UH CHANGE THE SETTINGS OF THE T. V. 
LIKE COLOUR AND THEN VOLUME AND UH 
MM-HMM 
UH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WELL B BUT MAKE IT A SEPARATE OPTION ON THE MAIN IS THAT IT'S IT'S DIF DIS DISPLAYED FROM UH DISPLAYED HERE IS UH PARENTS UH 
YEAH YOU CAN DO DISPLAY IT IN THE ON THE OLD STYLE 
YOU CAN DISPLAY ACTUAL BUTTONS ON THE TOUCH SCREENS 
YEAH OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES 
WELL YOU CAN USE UM WHEN YOU UH HOW DO YOU CALL IT IS UM SYNCHRONIZED THE UM REMOTE AND THE T. V. THEN THERE'S ALWAYS 
THERE ARE ALWAYS UH POSSIBILITIES TO CHANGE THE COLOUR AND THE BRIGHTNESS AND THE VOLUME AND UM WELL MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT IF THERE'S OPTIONS THAT THE REMOTE UM IN ITS MEMORY CAN SEE WHAT KINDA T. V. TO USE 
FROM UH IT'S A PHILIPS THIS AND THIS AND THAT AND THEN GIVE THE OPTIONS THAT ARE CAPABLE THE CAPABLE FROM THE IT 
WELL THERE ARE UNIVERSAL D UM UM REMOTES AND THEY ALL HAVE A FUNCTIONALITY FOR ALL THE T. V. S 
UH SO THIS WOULDN'T BE A EXTRA FEATURE TO INCORPORATE THE MENU MENUS OF THIS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
UH UM UM NO YOU CAN JUST SAY UH THE C 
YEAH 
IN CODES Y Y YOU GOT A B A BOOK WITH CODES 
YOU LOOK UP 
I HAVE A PHILIPS H. FIFTY FIVE AND IT SAYS PRESS CODE FOUR FIVE FIVE AND YOU PRESS CODE FOUR FIVE FIVE IN THE UH IN THE REMOTE AND IT DISPLAYS ALL YOUR UH MENU OPTIONS 
MEMORY IN THE ON THE REMOTE 
YEAH WELL UM IF YOU LOOK AT THE UM MANUALS FROM UNIVERSAL UH REMOTES THERE ARE MAYBE UM THREE FOUR HUNDREDS T. V. IS IT MAXIMUM 
IF YOU HAVE ALL OF THEM ALL THE OLD AND NEW T. V. S SUMMED UP SO UH I THINK UH IT IS POSSIBLE 
YEAH 
WELL THEN YOU HAVE TO BUY A NEW ONE IT'S VERY GOOD FOR MARKETING 
MAYBE OR AN UPDATE SOFTWARE UPDATE 
FIRMWARE UPDATE YOU SAY 
YEAH 
WELL IT UH YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE SHAPE AND UH THEY 
YEAH SER O AND THEY CAN DOWNLOAD IT FOR YOU 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WELL ALREADY DIGITAL INFORMATION IS SENT TO TO THE THE STANDARDS T. V. UH CONNECTIONS 
YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S UH PROGRAMME IS IN IN THE NEW UH CHANNELS SO MAYBE J THEY WE CAN SEND THAT INFORMATION ALONG WITH STANDARD T. V. UH 
RECEIVING 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
DIFFICULT 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH UH SO I THINK SOME I THINK IT'S GOOD IDEA YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY LET'S UH SAVE THIS IN THE MEANWHILE UH 
UM UM FOR WHICH ONE OR WE GOING 
MY MISTAKE 
THAT IN OUR UH 
YOUR VOTE AND YOUR OKAY 
WELL I WAS UH DOUBTING ABOUT WHICH ONE TO TAKE 
BUT UH YOU'VE CONVINCED ME THAT UH IF YOU D DISPLAY BUTTONS BUT THE SAME AS THEY WOULD LIKE IN A NORMAL UM REMOTE ALL ELDERLY PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO 
OPENS UP SO TOO DIFFICULT OR UH 
BREAK IT I DON'T GET 
UH SO YEAH 
YEAH 
A QUARTER TO ONE MAYBE 
OKAY 
YEAH SO IT POSSIBLE TO STORE THIS IN THE SHARE DOCUMENTS OR WHAT 
'KAY SAVE IT IS AN IMAGE ON THE EARS 
ONE AND AS AN IMAGE OF POSSIBLE 
J. PEG 
J. PEG 
YEAH IT'S BETTER 
YEAH 
OH YEAH IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE 
IT OR P. C. S 
IT'S CONNECTED 
YEAH 
IT GIVES THE ONE UH 
YES 
THE QUESTIONNAIRE FILL IN UH WE FILL IT D AFTER LUNCH OR UH 
OKAY 
YES 
WE CAN LEAVE THE P. C. NO I THINK YEAH AND RETURN TO THE 
YEAH BRING IT I GOTTA BRING TO HIM 
A BIG OFFICE 
YES 
HEY GUYS 
TOO WICKED 
OKAY 
'KAY WELCOME 
I HAVE SOME UH NEW FINDINGS IN UH MARKETING EXPERT LEVEL 
WHICH I WILL SHOW YOU 
THE METHOD I SAID WAS UM GIVING ORDERS TO OUR USABILITY LAB UH TO DO A QUESTIONNAIRE 
UM ONE HUNDRED RESPONDENTS WERE INVOLVED 
AND MY MARKETING UH DEPARTMENT GENERATED A REPORT WITH A LOT OF RESULTS 
UM 
THESE WERE A COUPLE OF FINDINGS FIRST PAGE OF THREE 
UM 
WE HAVE THREE AUDIENCES OF TWO AUDIENCES I'M SORRY 
UH THE FIRST ONE THIS SCALE FROM SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE AGE 
UH THE SECOND ONE IS FROM SIXTY FOUR UH FORTY SIX TO SIXTY FIVE 
UM SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THE MARKET SHARE FOR THE FIRST AUDIENCE IS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT UM SIXTY FIVE 
UH SECOND AUDIENCE AUDIENCE IS UH THIRTY FIVE PERCENT 
MM AND SOME INTERESTS FROM THE FROM THE AGE GROUPS 
UH IT SEEMS LIKE THE YOUNG USERS OF REMOTE CONTROLS REALLY LIKE THE FANCY UH NEW TECHNOLOGY STUFF LIKE UH AN L. C. D. SCREEN ON THE REMOTE CONTROL UM 
SPEECH RECOGNITION 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S UH REALLY APPROPRIATE 
UM AND WHEN YOU USE UH THE AUDIENCE 
THE AGE IS GOING UP UH 
YEAH THEY DON'T REALLY WANT IT ANYMORE AT LEAST THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES 
SECOND FINDINGS OUT OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE UM ARE THE OPINION 
THE OPINIONS UH OF THE AUDIENCE ABOUT CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
FIRST POINT IS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS FIND THE MOST REPO REMOTE CONTROLS VERY UGLY 
UH AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY 
SO THAT'S MAYBE SOMETHING FOR THE USER INTERFACE UH DESIGNER 
OKAY THIRD FINDINGS 
ACCORDING TO THE FREQUENCY OF USE VERSUS IMPORTANCE INVESTIGATION UM FOLLOWING BUTTONS ARE MOST IMPORTANT 
UM I WILL TELL SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THIS UH THIS TEST WAS YEAH DONE 
UM PERSONS WERE ASKED 
UH WHAT THE BUTTONS WERE UH THEY USE MOST HOW MUCH AN HOUR AND UH IN THE SECOND TABLE THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE BUTTONS 
UM WHEN YOU MULTIPLY THEM YOU GET THE THESE OTHER POINTS 
SWITCHING CHANNELS UM YEAH 
THAT'S PRETTY UH 
PRETTY NORMAL THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH A REMOTE CONTROL 
UM THE SECOND TELETEXT UH AND THE THIRD UH VOLUME CONTROLS 
UM I THINK IT'S GOOD UH THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE USER WANT WANTS UH AT LEAST THE THESE OTHER POINTS HAVE TO BE UH VERY CLEAR 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH OKAY BUT UH AT THE MOMENT UH TELETEXT IS 
YEAH THE THE BEST THING YOU CAN GET UH ON T. V. LIKE GETTING INFORMATION 
SO UH WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE WHAT DO THEY USE 
THEY USE TELETEXT AND NOT THE INTERNET ON A REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT'S RIDICULOUS 
THAT'S A ONE I IT IT'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S NOT INCORPORATED RIGHT NOW 
OKAY MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
UM 
I THINK WE SHOULD AIM AT THE UH AUDIENCE FROM SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE 
MM FIRST OF ALL UM IT'S THE BIGGEST SHARE THE BIGGEST AUDIENCE SIXTY FIVE PERCENT 
UH SECOND I THINK YOU WILL GET THE MOST REVENUE FROM I FROM IT 
UM 
YEAH PEOPLE FROM SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE WATCH A LOT OF T. V. MORE THAN UH PEOPLE WHO ARE L UH OLDER 
UM SECOND POINT WE HAVE TO IMPRO IMPROVE THE MOST USED FUNCTIONS SO I SAID HERE SWITCHING CHANNELS TELETEXT AND VOLUME CONTROLS 
THIRD POINT UM THAT CAME OUT OF THE UH OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE UH PEOPLE SAID IT UH 
GET LOST OFF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER SO MAYBE IT'S AN IDEA FOR US UH TO DESIGN EX KIND OF PLACEHOLDER UH ONE SIDE OF THE 
YEAH OF THE T. V. WHERE YOU CAN PUT THE THE REMOTE CONTROL IN 
UM 
THAT'S ABOUT IT I THINK 
YEAH 
UH NOT NOT THE OR NOT THE FUNCTIONS BUT UH TO COME TO THAT A LOT OF BUTTONS WEREN'T EVEN USED UH IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO YOU CAN HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL FULL OF BUTTONS A HUNDREDS HUNDREDS OF BUTTONS BUT IF YOU DON'T USE THEM YEAH IT'S 
YEAH THEY HAVE TO BE ON IT JU JUST TO TO TO GET IT DONE IF NECESSARY 
BUT UM THE MOST USED BUTTONS UH HAVE TO BE BIGGER OR 
YEAH PERHAPS 
JUST FOR THE MINOR FUNCTIONS PERHAPS 
JUST TO GET LESS BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL TO MAKE IT EASIER AND QUICKER TO LEARN 
YEAH 
'KAY THAT'S IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH INCORPORATING BLUETOOTH OR A RED UH RECEIVER UH IN THE PLACE HOLDER NEXT TO THE T. V. CONNECTED TO THE T. V. 
SO IT'S IN THE WRONG PRODUCT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
YEAH MAYBE ANOTHER PROBLEM UH 
I THINK CURRENT T. V. S CAN EVEN SEND INFRARED 
HUH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM IT'S MAYBE AN OPTION UH IF YOU USE AN L. C. D. OR A TOUCH SCREEN UM 
THAT IN THE MIDDLE OR THE THE MAIN KEYS LIKE DISPLAYED ON THE 
OH YEAH 
YEAH THIS 
NO 
YEAH 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OKAY JUST UH IN THE MIDDLE THE GENERAL FUNCTIONS LIKE PLAY UH 
CHANNEL SWITCHING AND THEN UH AT THE TOP OR AT THE BOTTOM SOME MEANS LIKE UH SETTINGS OR THAT YOU CAN DROP DOWN 
MM 
NAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK SO IT BUT AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE UM UH A LOT OF T. V. S HAVE DIFFERENT MENUS 
AND WHEN YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR MENU UH TO YOUR DEVICE UH IT COULD BE THAT DON'T CORRESPOND TO THE MENU WHAT'S ACTUALLY ON T. V. 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH I THINK THE D UH BUT UH TOUCH SCREEN 
UM IS VERY GOOD 
UM 
BECAUSE RECENTLY UH I SAW NEWS ITEM ON T. V. UM BUT 
UH NEW TELEPHONES UH FOR OLDER PEOPLE 
UM THEY HAVE LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN WITH UH REALLY BIG PICTURES ON IT LIKE UH UH CALL UH HANG UP UM 
AND THAT'S A BIG AD ADVANTAGE I THINK BECAUSE 
IN THE ONE HAND UH 
YOU MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL COMPATIBLE FOR ELDER USERS JUST BY UH SCALING UP THE PICTURES OR SOMETHING 
IT'S UH 
VERY VISUAL INTENDED 
WHAT WAS I TO SAY MORE 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY BUT BUT IF YOU PICK THE THE DO THE LEFT IDEA 
THEN WHAT'S GONNA BE DISPLAYED ON THE TOUCH SCREEN 
YEAH BUT L LIKE MAIN FUNCTIONS ARE 
OH OKAY 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH OF COURSE 
YEAH I HAD ANOTHER UH DO BUT MAYBE PARENTAL CONTROL 
UM 
LIKE BUILDING IN UH SOME KIND OF PIN CODE UH WHICH ALLOWS UH PARENTS TO SWITCH IT ALL CHANNELS 
UH BUT CHILDREN UH IF CHILDREN DON'T DON'T KNOW THE PIN CODE THEY CAN'T SWITCH TO UH VIOLENT UH CHANNELS OR 
TH THERE'S JUST 
JU JUST A SIMPLE LOG IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH THA THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT MAYBE UM IF YOU LOG IN FIRST IS A PARENT UM 
YOU ADDRESS THE THE CHANNELS AND LIKE UH UH THAT'S CHANNEL FIFTEEN THAT'S UH 
VI VIOLENT CHANNEL UH M MY KI MY KIDS UH I DON'T WANT MY KIDS TO WATCH THAT THEN YOU SET THE PRIORITY TO ONLY PARENTS 
FOR EXAMPLE 
BUT 
YEAH OKAY BUT BUT YEAH THAT'S JUST 
THAT'S IN A AN ADDED FEATURE 
YEAH TH TH THESE THINGS ARE NICE 
PARTIAL 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT BUT IF YOU DISPLAY IT AN L. C. D. SCREEN WITH OUR OUR REALLY BIG NUMBERS 
THAT'S JUST AS E JUST AS EASY 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S DIFFERENT 
YEAH AGE B BELOW FORTY 
AND THE THIS YOUNG PEOPLE YEAH 
YOU YOU SAW IT IN MY MARKETING REPORT THEY LIKE THE NEW FANCY STUFF SO 
A TOUCH SCREEN LIKE MICROSOFT AL ALREADY DEVELOPED SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR UH UH MULTI MEDIA APPLICATIONS 
I TH I THINK WE CAN DO THAT IT 
DONE 
YEAH YEAH SOME OF THEM 
THE MENUS UH OR NOT IDENTICAL FOR ALL THE FOR ALL T. V. S SO YOU HAVE TO DISPLAY IT IN IN UH T. V. 
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE 
MM-HMM MM YEAH 
DID THE THAT THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY 
YEAH 
BUT 
NO 
NO NO NO 
UH UH UH UH UM UH MEANS JUST JUST ONE OTHER THING 
UH WITH THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS THE UNIVERSAL ONES UM YOU HAVE TO PRESS YEAH YOU HAVE TO PRESS A CODE FOR T. V. 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NOW WE UH JUST CONNECT UH THE T. V. TYPE UH IT A SET OF OPTIONS IN JUST JUST IN THE MEMORY 
SO THAT IF YOU YEAH LIKE PROFILE SO THAT IF YOU UH TOUCH IN LIKE UH ONE FOR ONE ZERO KIND OF T. V. UH 
THE MEMORY UH 
POPS UP THE OPTIONS 
I TH DON'T THINK THAT'S UH THAT TAKES A LOT OF STORAGE SPACE OR SOME JUST VARIA VARIABLES 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BUT IN THE OTHER HAND ON THE OTHER HAND UH IF YOU HAVE A REMOTE AND BUY A NEW T. V. THAT ISN'T INCORPORATED IN THE REMOTE 
NEW REMOTE 
A FIRMWARE UPGRADE OR SOMETHING ABOUT FROM WHERE 
OH 
MAYBE WE 
NO M MY ONE MAYBE WE CAN INCORPORATE SOME KIND OF UH U. S. B. OR A FIREWIRE CONNECTION 
SO THAT YOU CAN UH CONNECT IT AT THE P. C. AND DOWNLOAD THE NEWEST FIRMWARE FROM UH FROM THE INTERNET 
YEAH LIKE A S KIND OF SERVICE CENTRE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I I THINK IT'S UH 
MOST CHEAP OR CHEAPEST TO JUST DO THE UPDATES UH AT THE SERVICE CENTRE OR AT THE SHAPE 
IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT A LOT OF WORK JUST AN UH DOCKING STATION WHERE YOU PUT IT IN PRESS START BLING BLING UPDATED 
YEAH 
YOU DON'T BUY A T. V. EVERY WEEK NEW TEEV SO 
LET'S VOTE 
MY VOTE TOO 
AND YOUR VOTE 
YEAH 
AND ALSO LIKE A CLAPPING UH 
LI LIKE DEVICE THAT UH POPS OPEN 
UH TOO DIFFICULT UM MAYBE UH IT'S EASIER TO BREAK IT 
YEAH THA THA THA THAT I UH 
YEAH 
LIKE MY TELEPHONE IT'S UH IT'S SENSITIVE TOO 
OH 
THIRTY MINUTES 
HOW MINUTES 
ONE QUESTION UH HOW LATE DO WE HAVE TO GET BACK BE BACK HERE 
THIRTY MINUTES LUNCH BREAK 
I THOUGHT FORTY FIVE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH ME TOO 
SAVE US 
YEAH V 
BUT BUT YOU CAN OPEN A FROM YOUR PR FROM YOUR LAPTOP 
YEAH MAYBE 
SAVE US 
NO 
EXPERT 
EXPORT H. T. M. L. 
HUH IMAGE 
PAPER SIZE A. FOUR 
UH SCREEN SIZE 
NO THIS DIRECTORY 
NO 
YEAH IT IS CONNECTED 
YEAH I THINK SO 
OH 
THANK YOU 
YEAH OF COURSE 
TO MY EXAVE EXECUTIVE 
YOU 
YEAH 
OKAY 
HELLO AGAIN 
MM YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YES 
YES 
YOUR PROJECT MANAGER 
WELCOME TO THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING 
FOR REAL REACTION 
UH HELLO AGAIN 
UH IT'S UH THE SAME AS THE LAST TIME 
UH UH ALSO THIS TIME THERE WILL BE UH THREE PRESENTATIONS 
AND WE M MOST UH REACH A DECISION ON UH THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS 
UM UH AND AT THE AND UH I UH WHEN I FINISH IT OFF I HAVE SOME UH INPUT FROM UH A MASTER CLASS I UH VISITED 
INFORMATION 
THE THE THE THE THE CONCEPTS IN UH WE UH WHERE WE UH MUST REACH A DECISION ON 
UM UH OR FROM UH OUR OF TWO SORTS 
COMPONENTS CONCEPTS AND USER INTERFACE CONCEPTS 
UH THE FIRST ONE IS UH REALLY ABOUT THE THE THE THE THE TOTAL PACKAGE UH WITH UH WELL 
WE HAVE DECIDED TO DO A D THE UH WITH A TOUCH SCREEN THAT MUST BE A CASE AROUND IT IS UH IT WON'T BE UH UH AS BREAKABLE 
UH HOW HOW ABOUT THE ENERGY 
CAN YOU UH CAN YOU RELOAD IT OR UH JUST HAVE BATTERIES WHICH YOU MUST EXCHANGE 
UH THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT 
UH WITH THE TYPE AND UH THE THE SUPPLEMENTS 
SO UH WHERE TO PUT WHAT BUTTON 
AND UH UH I WOULD SAY UH JANS CAN YOU BEGIN 
OKAY 
AT THE AND UH I WILL TAKE NOTES UH AND AT THE END OF THE MINUTES UH WELL UH B TO THE SHARED FOLDER 
MM-HMM 
NO NO LITTLE QUESTION 
UM BUT THE THE MATERIAL 
UH A SOFT MATERIAL FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THANK YOU 
MM-HMM 
OH 
BUT YOU PREFER KINETIC 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T MOVE A A REMOTE CONTROL TOO MUCH 
AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO TO KEEP THE ENERGY LEVEL UH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THANK YOU TIM 
YEAH 
DYNAMIC DYNAMIC LOOK 
A LITTLE ARTISTIC 
OKAY 
IT'S SOFT 
THAT'S THE MATERIAL THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WANT UH AIN'T IT 
JUST LIKE THE WATCH FROM SEIKO 
YEAH 
I I UH I WOULD PREFER UH BOTH UH IT 
YEAH 
COMBINE THEM 
RUBBER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
UM IT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM YEAH 
THANK YOU 
YEAH 
DO YOUR THING TIM 
BRING IT IN 
YEAH 
FLASHY 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WOOD IS NOT A NOT A MATERIAL YOU WHICH YOU BUILD A A REMOTE CONTROL OF 
YEAH BUT NEVER SEEN ONE 
CASE 
UH A WOODEN LOOK YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WOULD YOU PREFER UH UH THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE THE COLOUR OF YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL OR 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MAYBE YOU COULD USE YOUR REMOTE IS A PHONE 
THERE ARE NUMBERS ON IT IS UH 
SO THAT YOU SAY UM S. P. S. S. AND IT GOES TO UH OKAY 
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T SEE THAT THE GAMES WHEN YOU WATCHING TELEVISION I THINK 
YEAH OKAY 
YOU TAKE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WITH YOU 
OH GREAT 
OH OKAY 
OH 
I THINK WE CAN DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT THE THE OTHER UH KIND OF REVOLUTIONARY THINGS UH TIME UH COME WITH 
THE PARENTAL CONTROL THE GAMES AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
OH 
THERE'S NO NOT UH TOO MUCH DECISION ON UH THAT ONE IS UH I THINK THAT PARENTAL CONTROL IS A GOOD FUNCTION TO UH TO PUT IN THE REMOTE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU THINK ABOUT IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE UH FIND IT UH MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT THEIR CHILDREN DON'T WATCH UH SIX OR VIOLENCE UH IN THE TELEVISION 
AND UH WAIT UH TEN OR FIFTEEN SECONDS LONGER SO THEY CAN UH FINALLY WATCH IT UH BECAUSE OF THAT 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK THAT'S A B THERE'S A BIG MARKET FOR IT BECAUSE UH Y YEAH 
YOU READ MANY TIMES IN MAGAZINES SAME KIND OF STUFF AND YOU HEARD ON THE NEWS THAT UH THAT UH YEAH 
THEY BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN UH ARE INFLUENCED BY THE TELEVISION AND UH WELL WE'RE WE'RE AIMING UH TO UH BELOW UH FORTY UH YEARS 
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF UH PEOPLE WILL BELOW FORTY WHO HAVE UH CHILDREN IN YOUNG AGE UH WHO WHO WANT ME TO UH NOT WATCH UH VIOLENT OR UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
THAT'S A THAT'S A BETTER IDEA 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH WITH AND ONE WITHOUT 
YEAH 
YEAH MAYBE IT CAN WORK WITH SHOW VIEW 
UH Y YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR VIDEO RECORDER WITH SHOW VIEW 
UH WHEN YOU TACK ON A NUMBER IT WILL UH START AND AND UH RECORDING 
BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOME OPTION THAT UH THAT IT UH THE KIND OF SHOW VIEW NUMBERS ARE VIOLENT AND THAT THEY ARE BLOCKED OUT 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I WOULDN'T PUT IT IN AN OPTIONAL DEVICE 
THAT THAT THEN THEN THEN IT BECOMES TOO MUCH I THINK 
IF WE DO IT W WE MUST DO IT IN A KIND OF WAYS THAT LIKE A PROFILE 
A PARENT PROFILE AND A FAMILY PROFILE AND OTHERWISE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND WHAT DO YOU UH GUYS THINK OF THE GAMES ON THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THAT BECOMES TOO MUCH 
IT'S MORE LIKE IT GETS YOU TO THE FUNCTIONALITY BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND GAMES 
THAT WOULD 
OKAY 
SO THAT WILL UH THAT THAT THAT MUST BE ON IT YOU THINK 
OKAY 
SO THE GAMES UH ARE ON IT 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION OR NOT 
AND THE PARENTAL CONTROL OR 
OPTIONAL 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
UH BUT UH WELL THERE UH UH LIKE THE FIRST IDEA UH FROM UH YOU CAN BUY IT WITHOUT AND UH WITH PARENTAL CONTR CONTROL 
OR ARE WE GOING TO PUT IT ON AND UH JUST UH 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
YEAH Y Y YEAH BUT MOST OFTEN NOT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO UH I THINK WE HAVE DECIDED ON THE THINGS THAT UH FROM JANUS THE ENERGY THE COMBINATION BETWEEN BATTERY AND KINETIC 
THE CASE WILL BE DOUBLE CURVED AND UH RUBBER ON A FR FLASHY FRUITY COLOUR UH THAT WITH COVER IS REMOVABLE 
THE BUTTONS WILL BE UH TOUCH SCREEN 
UH BUT THERE MAY NOT BE TOO MANY BUTTONS 
AND IN THE THE MENU STRUCTURE UH THERE MUST NOT TO BE UH 
FIVE MINUTES TO GO 
UH TO UH TOO MANY LEVELS 
AND UH IT MUST BE EASY TO USE 
THE PARENTAL CONTROL WILL BE INCORPORATED BUT IT MUST BE NOT TOO COMPLEX 
AND THE GAMES ARE ON IT 
SO 
I THINK WE HAVE UH WE HAVE DECIDED UH OKAY 
UH LITTLE MORE 
YEAH 
LIKE A LIKE A MOAT OR S OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE THAT IN THE 
YEAH 
YOU USE THE 
YEAH 
IT'S ALREADY INCORPORATED A LITTLE ON THAT CONCEPT 
OKAY 
WE TAKE IT AT THE OTHER MEETING OKAY 
I HAVE A LITTLE W UH LITTLE CHAT TO DO AND UH THEN WE UH FINISH 
I WANT TO UH A MASTER CLASS AND UH UH TWO THINGS UH OUR UH OUR UH CAN COME IN HANDY UH FOR US 
FIRST THING UH SO UH WE TALKED ABOUT KNOWLEDGE UH MANAGEMENT 
KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING AND UH UH THE FACT THAT UH THAT UH THAT THE IDEA OF KNOWLEDGE UH SHARING AND LEARNING KNOWLEDGE FROM OTHER COMPANIES IS UH LIKE THAT 
IT'S IT'S UH VERY HOT AT THE MOMENT SO IT'S IT'S MOSTLY FOR THE MANAGEMENT EXPERT TO TO LIKE WHAT OTHER UH MARKETING OR DID I SAID MANAGEMENT 
OH 
JUST TALKING ABOUT MYSELF 
UH W 
WHAT OTHER COMPANIES UH HAD TO UH ALSO WITH THE THE THE THE MARKETING CAMPAIGN WHEN THEY PUT IN A NEWER REMOTE JUST SOME UH YEAH 
IMPORT EXPORT 
AND UH ANOTHER ONE 
UH THEY'RE A UH THEY'RE IT YEAH BENCHMARKING THAT'S THE WORD I SAW 
I UH COULDN'T UH OKAY UH ANOTHER UH THING IS UH THERE WERE THERE THERE WAS A SURVEY 
AND UM UH TO COME TO THAT UM PEOPLE LIKE TO BUY THINGS FROM A SINGLE LARGE PROVIDER INSTEAD OF THOSE WHO UH ARE PARTNERING UH WITH US 
SO WE MUST UH WE MUST BRING TO USE OF UH REAL REACTION IS UH SO BIG COMPANY UH A TRUSTFUL COMPANY AND UH IT HAS UM 
OKAY 
I HAD A I HAD ANOTHER IDEA TO PUT UH UH THE WHOLE THE WHOLE IDEA OF UH REAL REACTION AND UH UH UH A SINGLE BRAND AND UH UH THAT KIND OF THING 
WHEN YOU UH PUT IN REMOTE YOU USE A KIND OF A JUST LIKE WHEN YOU TELEPHONE YOU USE A LITTLE UH ANIMATION 
REAL REACTION REMOTE 
AND UH WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE MOTTO WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
AND THEN YOU GO UH 
THE 
YEAH 
BUT W THE THE IDEA FROM THIS UH THING IS THAT WE MUST PRESENT IT IS A AS WE ARE A A SINGLE LARGE PROVIDER WHO WILL STAND ON OUR OWN 
MM YEP YEAH 
ALSO ALSO 
BUT WE WE ARE UH 
YEAH YEAH Y YEAH YEAH 
OKAY BUT UH THINK ABOUT THAT KIND OF THINGS 
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID IN THE MASTER CLASS 
NO UH NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES 
SO UH MAYBE YOU CAN GO TO PARIS AND MILAN UH ONCE AGAIN 
THE MASTER CLASS 
FRANZ MEHLER'S 
UH VERY SPECIAL UH NEXT UH SESSION 
UH DO THAT YOU UH THE THE INDUSTRIAL UH DEVELOPMENT UH CENTRE AND UH USER INTERFACE UH WILL WORK TOGETHER ON A PROTOTYPE 
AND UH WILL DRAWING IT IN THE SMARTBOARD 
SO THAT'S A KINDA NEW UH THING 
AND UM THE MARKETING EXPERT WILL UH WELL UH KE HE WILL BE KEEPING BUSY WITH THE PRODUCT UH EVALUATION 
BUT THE MOST UH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY EMAIL 
YEAH THE WELL UH DIDS THIS WHAT I UH WHAT I HEARD 
I 
NOT IN THE MASTER CLASS 
SO YOU UH JUST WAIT FOR THE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS AND UH BUT I THINK IT WAS A VERY UH VERY GOOD UH SESSION UH GENTLEMEN 
I WILL THANK YOU ALL 
AND UH 
GIVE ME A GOOD EVALUATION 
CHEERS 
SO YOU IN A HALF HOUR 
BUT KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR UH LAPTOPS FOR A REAL UH 
YEAH BUT TH THERE'S THERE'S STILL THE MY UH INSTRUCTIONS THAT YOU WILL WORK TOGETHER 
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM 
BYE BYE 
THE PROJECT MANAGER ALWAYS WORKS ALONE 
OH 
YEAH SURE 
OKAY 
UH LET ME SEE 
I THINK IT'S THIS ONE 
OH 
RIGHT 
UH WELL I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE COMPONENTS 
UH WHAT I DID WAS I REVIEWED PREVIOUSLY USED ITEMS UH BY UH TWO TWO UH DIFFERENT UH AGE GROUPS 
UH BELOW FORTY FIVE AND ABOVE 
AND UH I JUST UH WATCH WHAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE AND I CHECKED UH WELL WHAT WHAT DO DO WE WANT 
AND HOW CAN WE UH D UM A T UH THE TARGET GROUP 
WELL UH WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT A SENIOR UM 
SENIOR CITIZENS UH 
YOU UH IT'S IT'S OKAY 
UH THEY WILL THEY LIKE MORE TH THEY LIKE THE TRADITIONAL MATERIALS LIKE WOOD AND AND SUCH MORE 
WOOD AND CHROME 
AND UH UH THEY LIKE UH STRAIGHTFORWARD SHAPES 
UM UH THEY THEY THEY THEY LIKE LUXURIOUS UH STYLES WHERE WHEREAS THE YOUNG AND DYNAMIC THEY LIKE A MORE UH SOFT MATERIALS 
THINK OF THE TELETUBBIES FOR INSTANCE 
UH UH SOFT AND FLUFFY AND COLOURFUL AND WELL UH SHAPES ARE CURVED AND ROUND 
Y Y YOU GET THE PICTURE 
AND UH THEY LIKE SPORTS AND GAMING AND THAT GIVES THEM UH THE VITALITY 
UH SO WE WILL UH FIRS YES 
YEAH 
NO I'LL I'LL GET OUT THAT 
Y YOU'LL SEE 
YEAH 
UH WELL F FIRST OFF LET'S START START WITH THE ENERGY 
W I UH I HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN UH A FEW DIFFERENT UH SOURCES 
BUT UH THE TWO BASIC SOURCES THAT I FOUND WERE THE BEST POSSIBLE WERE THE BATTERY UH VERSUS KINETIC 
UH KINETIC THAT'S WHEN YOU MOVE SOMETHING THEN UH IT GETS ENERGY 
I FIGURED WELL THAT'S KI KINDA HIGH TECH WHEN WHEN YOU HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT WELL WHEN YOU PICK IT UP IT HAS POWER 
THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY VERY NICE UH I FIGURED 
WELL WE COULD ALSO IS A BATTERY THAT'S A BIT 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YOU C JUST YOU HAVE TO SHAKE IT AROUND A LITTLE BIT 
AND THEN THEN TO DO THEN IT HAS SOME MORE UH ENERGY 
WELL Y YOU COULD JUST GO FOR A BATTERY 
OR YOU CAN GO FOR BOTH 
YEAH I ACTUALLY DID 
BUT UH THE THING IS ABOUT SOLAR PANEL SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE L UH LIGHT 
WELL SUNLIGHT PREFERABLY 
UH AND YOU YOU COULD YOU COULD USE NORMAL LIGHT BUT UH YOU WOULDN'T GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT YOU WOULD FROM A BATTERY OR SOMETHING 
UH FOR UH ULTIMATE B UH IN UH SO IF UH SOLAR PANELS YOU COULD ACTUALLY SO UH YOU COULD USE UH SOLAR PANELS 
BUT UH YOU HA YOU'D HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THEM INTO UH THE REMOTE CONTROL LEAVING YOU UH A BIT LESS SPACE FOR THE INTERFACE 
SO UH SO I I IT IT W WHAT'S ACTUALLY I I C JUST ONE OF I'VE FIGURED OUT TO THAT WELL 
UH USING THAT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE UH WITHIN THE L UH DISTANCE OF T. V. AND THE FROM T. V. THERE COMES A A A WHOLE BUNCH OF LIGHT 
SO IT WOULD ACTUALLY POWER ITSELF UH FROM A T. V. 
BUT WELL YOU JUST TAKE UP ALL THE SPACE AND YOU WOULDN'T UH HAVE THE FULL AMOUNT OF POWER ACTUALLY USED 
SO I I PREFER KINETIC BECAUSE IT'S UH WELL THE COSTS AREN'T THAT MUCH HIGHER 
AND UM JU JUST A BIT MORE HIGH TECH THAN THAN A NORMAL BATTERY 
I MEAN IF 
NO BUT UH D WELL YOU PICK IT UP AND YOU PRESS BUTTONS AND YOU WILL YOU 
YEAH WELL UH ACTUALLY TO USE 
AND IT OUT OF IT ISN'T YOU JUST SHAKE IT A BIT AND AND DID DID WITH POWER UP AGAIN 
BUT WHAT EL WHAT JAREK SAID YOU COULD YOU COULD USE A BATTERY THAT YOU'D JUST KEEP IT IN THE RECHARGING WHENEVER IT MOVES 
AND FOR REST YOU'D JUST ADD JUICE ON THE BATTERY 
EXACTLY 
AND SO THAT UH UH WELL F FURTHERMORE YOU YOU W UH CHECKED UH THE CASES 
WE HAVE UH DIFFERENT OPTIONS UH CONCERNING THE CASES 
YOU UH I YOU SOME UH YOU SIMPLY ADD A BASIC UH STANDARD UH MODEL UH IT WAS KIND OF SQUARE AND UH I FIGURED THAT'S A BIT BORING 
SO YOU YOU WE COULD GO FOR UH THE SINGLE CURVED OR THE DOUBLE CURVED 
UM SINGLE CURVE IT'S JUST A WELL UH YOU KNOW IT'S JUST UH A NICE CURVE 
OR BUT BUT YOU COULD GO ON A ONE ONE DOUBLE CURVES 
AND THAT'S LIKE SEVERAL DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS 
THAT GIVES YOU ONE WHOLE NEW UH OFFICE 
YEAH THAT GIVES YOU A YOUNGER AND UH MORE HIGH TECH LIKE I IF I FIGURED 
BUT THAT UH WE'LL DISCUSS LATER 
WHAT 
YOU WANT ME TO DRAW IN THREE D. 
OH YEAH I C I C I COULD I COULD SHOW YOU 
I COULD SHOW YOU 
WELL UH LET'S SAY YOU UH YOU UH 
LET'S SAY THAT'S YOUR STANDARD UH 
THAT'S A BIT YOUR D STANDARD DESIGN 
BUT YOU COULD ACTUALLY GO LIKE UH SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
AND THEN UH IN THREE D. EFFECT YOU COULD GO 
SO Y Y YOU JUST 
YEAH THIS IS A THIS BUT UH DIFFICULTY IN I DIDN'T TAKE A MAJOR IN ART 
SO BUT BUT YOU COULD HAVE UH UH A WHOLE NEW UH THE BACK BACK THE THE THE DEPTH 
YOU COULD YOU COULD UH JUST PLAY AROUND A BIT WITH 
YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE STANDARD UH 
YEAH YOU COULD YOU IT LEAVES MORE SPACE FOR CREATIVITY 
UH THAT MIGHT BE AN IDEA BUT JUST A WELL FURTHERMORE UH WELL UH PLASTIC VERSUS RUBBER 
YOU WE COULD CHOOSE UH WHAT UH WHAT'S BETTER PLASTIC UM OR RUBBER 
I I CH PREFER RUBBER BECAUSE IT FEELS UH YEAH 
YEAH IT'S SOFT AND IT'S THAT I LIKE SOFT 
YEAH YEAH I MEAN UH PLASTIC UH USE PLASTIC ALSO HAS THAT CHEAP FEELING TO IT 
LIKE PLASTIC UH YOUR YOUR I USUALLY ASSOCIATE PLASTIC WITH UH SOMETHING THAT'S CHEAP 
OH THAT'S MAYBE JUST UM BUT UH WE COULD UH 
UH UH TALK ABOUT IT LATER 
UH FURTHERMORE BUTTONS 
UH TRADITIONAL UH OR A TOUCH SCREEN 
WELL WE DISCUSSED IT IN A PREVIOUS MEETING SO I FIGURED I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THE L. C. D. 
AND UH CHIP SET WILL UH IF WE ARE GOING TO USE TRADITIONAL BUTTONS WE COULD GO UH WITH A SIMPLE CHIP SET 
BUT UH IF WE DECIDE TO GO ON A ONE UH UM L. C. D. SCREEN WE WOULD USE AN UH WE HAVE TO USE IN A ADVANCED CHIP SET 
AND THAT WOULD BRING UH THE NECESSARY COSTS WITH WITH IT 
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE TH HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND 
IF IT ISN'T UH MANAGEABLE UH BUDGET WISE WE'D HAVE TO GO OVER TO UH TO SUM IT SIMPLE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
YEAH PROBABLY 
YEAH PROBABLY BUT BUT UH YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THAT SHOULDN'T SHOULDN'T BE UH THAT BIG A ISSUE 
I'LL I'LL I'LL JUST ADD UH UH I PUT A BIG SUMMARY HERE SO WE COULD DISCUSS IT A BIT 
UH WHAT I WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS CONCERNING BATTERY VERSUS KINETIC 
YEAH Y Y YOU SHOULD WE SHOULD A COMBINATION 
UH YOU USE THE BATTERY AND W CHARGE IT UP WITH KINETIC 
WHEN YOU PICK IT UP IT CHARGES UP 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH I KNOW 
YEAH I CAN EXACTLY 
WHAT UH WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YOU AGREE 
YEAH 
BOTH 
OKAY 
UH WELL THAT WOULD BRING THE UM UM SOME MORE COSTS BUT I MEAN THE 
WHO CARES RIGHT 
THAT'S THE PROJECT MANAGER'S PROBLEM 
YEAH WELL FIFTY CENT UH UH WHY DOESN'T AND THEN WE HAVE SINGLE CURVED VERSUS DOUBLE CURVED 
THAT 
OKAY 
NO WE'LL WE'LL JUST WAIT AND UH UH PLASTIC VERSUS RUBBER 
ANY IDEAS 
UH RUBBER 
YOU 
UH I FIGURED IT WILL BE UM RATHER THAN HARD NAH RUBBER C UH THIS IS A CASING YEAH 
RUBBER CASING BECAUSE WELL IF YOU USE AN UH DO A TOUCH SCREEN UH IT'S JUST A CASING UH AROUND IT 
SO UM YOU COULD GO FOR PLASTIC BUT I FIGURED 
I I I WOULD CHOOSE RUBBER 
WELL UM I DON'T KNOW 
NO 
YEAH 
THAT ISN'T 
YEAH THAT WOULD COVER IT 
THAT THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
SO MM UH UH SO UH SO WHAT ARE THE OPINIONS 
UH RUBBER OR PLASTIC 
I I I PREFER RUBBER 
YEAH YOU IT 
YOU SURE 
Y Y YOU SEEMED TO HESITATE A BIT 
YEAH IT IT SHOULDN'T IT SHOULDN'T FLOP OVER WHEN YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND UH NO 
THAT THAT THAT THAT'S GONNA THE THE CHIP SET WILL HOLD IT FROM ONE PLACE AND UH AND AND UH AND A L. C. D. SCREEN ALSO 
YEAH IT M MIGHT IT MIGHT 
UH TRA UH TRADITIONAL VERSUS L. C. D. WELL I FIGURED WE WE ALL SET ON THAT 
AND UH THEN ALSO THE SIMPLE VERSUS ADVANCED 
WELL I FIGURE IF WE GO FOR L. L. C. D. WE WE SHOULD HAVE THE ADVANCED 
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM 
OKAY WELL THAT'S MY UH 
OH YOU'RE WELCOME 
WELL THE TELETUBBIES SH 
WELL YOU COULD 
YOU YOU COULD 
WELL UH 
YEAH 
WELL I ACTUALLY SAW A PHONE THAT YOU COULD USE AS A REMOTE SO YEAH 
HEY 
THAT MIGHT BE A NEXT STEP 
WELL YEAH 
YOU TAKE YOUR UH REMOTE WITH YOU TO SCHOOL 
YEAH 
VERY NICE 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH UH THE TIME AND EFFORT WE ARE GOING TO SPEND ON IT 
BECAUSE WELL IT'S A SIMPLE FUNCTION BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF RESOURCES AND A LOT OF TIME UM TO PROGRAMMING IT 
BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE TO START WORKING WITH THE PROFILES AND SUCH 
AND I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH UH INVESTING THAT MUCH TIME AND EFFORT INTO IT 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
BUT WELL IF YOU WANT TO I I I IF WE IN INCORPORATE UH THE PARENTAL CONTROL 
UH LET'S SAY WE DO AND AND WELL WHATEVER CHO UH CHILD JUST GOES UP TO THE T. V. AND PRESSES UP FOR INSTANCE 
WELL UH NOB NOBODY'S STOPPING THE CHILD FROM UH WELL CHECKING UH THE CHANNEL 
BUT THAT 
WELL I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE UM FOR THAT IT HAPPEN YOU DO YOU WILL HAVE TO RECEIVE A SIGNAL FROM THE UH REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IT WOULD YEAH HAVE TO BE CONSTANT UH CONSTANT SIGNALLING 
WHAT UM WHAT MAY BE BETTER IS TO INCORPORATE AN UH A SEPARATE DEVICE THAT UH THAT YOU CAN PROGRAM WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THAT UH PROVIDES PARENTAL CONTROL FOR INSTANCE 
AND THAT'S JUST AN OPTIONAL UH DEVICE 
SO THERE'S NO THAT'S THERE'S UH BESIDES UH THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU'LL HAVE A SEPARATE UH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
THAT'S TRUE BUT UH AT SAME INSTANT SAME HAPPENS WHEN UH YOU HAVE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO 
BUT ONLY DIFFERENCE IS UH THE UH THE PEOPLE BUYING THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL NOW GET THE F ADDED FEATURE OF PARENTAL CONTROL 
AND THESE PEOPLE WOULDN'T UH NECESSARY WANT IT 
SO YOU YOU'D BE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I CAN SEE GAMES HAPPENING 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT WILL BE NICE 
WELL I DON'T KNOW 
I I FIGURE IF YOU HAD TWO DIFFERENT REMOTES YOU COULD BE CHOOSE ONE WITH UH WELL UH UH A RECEIVER ON IT 
SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY EASILY UH BUILD IN UH PARENTAL CONTROL 
BUT IT WOULD WOULD BE UH MORE EXPENSIVE 
IS A AND THAT THAT WAY UH YOU COULD MAKE CHEAP MODEL AND A EXPENSIVE MODEL 
COULD MA MAKE THE UH SIMPLE MODEL AND THE DELUXE MODEL UH FOR INSTANCE 
YES THEY ARE 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU YOU HAVE SOME T. V. S ANY 
YEAH 
THAT IS TRUE THAT IS TRUE 
WELL YEAH YOU COULD YOU COULD EASILY YOU COULD EASILY YOU COULD EASILY TO THE MOTE CONTROL 
BUT YOU STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM BUT UH THE TELEVISION ITSELF 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT IS TRUE 
YEAH THAT IS TRUE 
YEAH YOU COULD YOU COULD YOU COULD GO LIKE UH THAT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE UH THINGS A LOT MORE EASY 
YOU COULD JUST BLAME IT ON TELEVISION AND UH MAKE IT OTHER PROBLEM 
YEAH I FIGURED I FIGURE WE COULD DO THAT 
YEAH YEAH SURE 
UH I'M NOT SURE WHAT MARKETING THINKS ABOUT IT BUT 
USER PROFILE 
WELL YEAH YOU YOU COULD ACTUALLY BUILD IN A FUNCTION THAT YOU CAN PROGRAM IT YOURSELF FOR THE MORE ADVANCED USERS 
YEAH WHICH BUTTONS DO YOU WANT IT ON IT 
BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN LIKE BUILD IN A BACK FORWARD BUTTON AND UH SOME PO SOMEBODY WOULD JUST WANT TO WATCH TWO CHANNELS 
YEAH YOU COULD YOU COULD UM HAVE PEOPLE WANT UH WANT THAT 
OH YEAH SURE 
WELL IF YOU IF YOU HAVE THE L L. C. D. SCREEN YOU CAN YOU CAN UH HAVE A SMALL LOGO I UH AT THE BOTTOM 
AND IT COULD JUST STAY THERE 
YEAH THAT SPINS AROUND OR SOMETHING 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
A SMALL ICON 
SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER RIGHT NOW 
DEFINITELY 
WELL THANK YOU IT 
YOU WISH 
UM YOU 
CHEERS 
HEY 
YEAH UH I'M NOT SURE IF WE UH WE BECAUSE I SAW SOMETHING ABOUT INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS 
WELL YEAH 
HELLO 
UM PROJECT MANAGER I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU 
I HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEMS WITH MY LAPTOP 
AND UH SO SO SO SO I HAD A LITTLE LESS TIME TO COMPLETE 
IN A LITTLE PROBLEM UH BIG PROBLEM 
I JUST THOUGHT UM IT DIDN'T WORK ANYMORE 
THE ENTIRE WINDOWS UH 
IT IT HUNG 
DURING LUNCH YEAH 
HE'S THE MASTER YEAH 
WOW 
UH HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE OPTION OF USING A SOLAR PANEL 
W NAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
TH TH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
YEAH 
UM I THINK YOU SHOULD USE KINETIC AS A BACK UP 
A COMBINATION YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
PSYCHO KINETIC 
YEAH 
BY A FIFTY CENTS BATTERY AND UH 
WELL MAYBE I HAVE SOMETHING IN MY PRESENTATION TO UH TO COPE WITH THAT 
UM ISN'T POSSIBLE TO MAKE COMBINATION WITH KIND OF RUBBER IS OR BENDABLE REMOTES WHERE YOU'VE GOT A 
OR DO YOU THINK IT RUBBER CASING YEAH 
YEAH 
UM WELL D MAYBE I CAN ASK IT RIGHT NOW THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE 
UH IS IT POSSIBLE UH OF USE IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A TOUCH SCREEN SQUARE 
IT ISN'T I THINK YEAH 
WE'RE WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS SO MAYBE WE CAN UH 
MM YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OH YEAH 
OKAY I I GET IT 
OKAY 
THAT'S GOOD 
WELL AS LONG A AS LONG AS IT'S IT'S UH IT'S FROM 
AND YOU DON'T UH IT'S NOT BENDABLE OR SOMETHING I TH I THINK THAT GOES OUT FOR 
OH 
OKAY 
IT MIGHT EVEN BOUNCE BACK WHEN YOU DROP IT IN THE FLOOR 
OKAY 
DO YOUR THING 
SPONGEBALL 
IT'LL FLOAT 
TABLES 
OH 
HEY 
TWELVE FIFTY UH 
WHEN YOUR PARENTS ARE WATCHING SOME BORING PROGRAM YOU CAN TAKE THE REMOTE AND DO SOMETHING ELSE 
TAKE IT 
OH 
MM-HMM 
NO 
OKAY 
UM THE INTERFACE CONTENTS 
WELL THAT'S A JUST SIMPLE POWERPOINT MOCK UP I WANT TO M MAKE IT MORE AS DYNAMIC FOR YOU SEE I'LL DRAW THERE 
BUT THE MAIN CONCEPT IS UM TAKE ONE BIG TOUCH SCREEN 
UM ALWAYS DISPLAY THE PRIMARY BUTTONS COLOUR AND VISIBLE 
MAYBE EVEN LI LIKE THIS WITH UH U USES OF A LOT OF SPACE 
AND UH MAKE THE MENU STRUCTURE CHANGEABLE 
SO IF YOU PRESS UM SYSTEM THAT'S YEAH WELL M MULTIPLE SYSTEM OPTIONS CAN MAYBE FIVE OR TEN OR OR NO CAN FIT IN 
OR MAYBE EVEN A STEP FURTHER WHEN YOU WANT TO ME 
IT UM HAVE SOME OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE NOT PROGRAMMABLE WITH ONE HORIZONTAL BUTTON 
AND UM OTHER BUTTONS CAN MAY BE DISPLAYED HERE IF THAT'S NECESSARY 
AND UM WELL HOW DO UH DO WE WANT TO LOOK AT UH UH OF UM YEAH DOES A REMOTE LIKE WELL 
IT'S YOU'VE GOTTA HOLD IT IN ONE HAND 
SO UM THE MIDDLE LIKE ALL REMOTES HAVE TO BE IN A LITTLE BIT SMALL SO YOU CAN PUT IT IN 
INSIDE YOUR HANDS 
AND SOME REMOTES YOU CAN USE WITH YOUR THUMB 
BUT I THINK THAT'S TOO DIFFICULT FOR THIS ONE 
SO YOU CAN MAKE IT IS A LITTLE BROADER 
YEAH 
AND HERE 
AND MAYBE USE YOUR THUMB 
IN THE ON THE MAIN BUTTONS 
AND USE YOUR OTHER HANDS 
IN THE MENU STRUCTURE 
SO HERE ARE GONNA BE THE PROGRAM BUTTONS 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR ET CETERA 
AND THE THE VOLUME CONTROL AND PROGRAM CONTROL MAYBE 
AND DOWN HERE 
UM I ADDED THIS COULD BE IN UH BIG L. C. D. 
UM THE MENU STRUCTURE 
SO YOU CAN USE IT IN UH IN THIS WAY 
UM 
ONE THING YOU'VE GOTTA KEEP IN MIND KEEP THE REMOTE COLOUR OF TOO MUCH FUNCTIONS AT THE SAME TIME 
UM KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE CHANGING THE MENU STRUCTURE HERE UM 
AND WELL I STILL BELIEVE YOU SHOULD KEEP DISPLAYING THE BUTTONS 
BUT IF YOU'RE PROGRAMMING THE COLOUR OF THE T. V. DO NOT DISPLAY TWENTY OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE POSSIBLE 
JUST KEEP IT IS SIMPLE IS UH AS POSSIBLE 
AND DO NOT SO TOO MANY LEVELS 
DO NOT HAVE TO SELECT A SCREEN FIRST AND THEN BRIGHTNESS AND THEN COLOUR AND ONE PLUS AND UM PUSH PLUS TWENTY TIMES 
BUT JUST THE UM UH JUST ONE ONE BUTTON IF POSSIBLE 
AND UM WELL YOU KN YOU ALL KNOW THE T. V. LEVELS 
UM CHANNEL ONE TWO 
AND WHEN YOU GET IT ON IT UH TO TEN YOU NEED WANT TO GO BACK UH WELL YOU HAVE A PROBLEM 
JUST MO MOST MOST MODERN T. V. S YOU YOU PRESS ONE ZERO AND IT GOES TO TEN 
AND ALSO IT ON AND THROUGH AFTER THAT 
SO THE USE A BUTTON LESS 
AND UM THINGS LIKE TELETEXT PUT THEM IN THE MENU 
THINGS LIKE UM UM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH W YEAH I I FOUND I MUST TRYING TO UH TELL IT 
SO UH VOLUME PLUS AND MINUS 
AND THIS IS PROGRAM UH PLEASE 
AND MINUS 
OH 
YES 
OR IF YOU'RE WATCHING STUDIO SPORTS ON UH ONE SEVENTEEN AND YOUR WIFE IS WATCHING SOME SOAP ON TWO WELL YES I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
BUT UM WELL M MY PREFERENCE WOULD TO BE PUT IT IN THE MENU STRUCTURE 
AND IF YOU'RE USING THAT BUTTON A LOT OF TIMES WELL OF COURSE THE MENU WILL STILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN 
YOU JUST DON'T HAVE TO PLAY GAMES UH IN BETWEEN 
BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY SWITCHING BETWEEN TWO CHANNELS YOU WON'T HAVE TIME UH TO DO IS THE OTHER OPTIONS 
UM YEAH ALREADY ALREADY TOLD THAT 
YEAH 
THAT'S MY CONCLUSION 
WELL I AGREE JUST PUT IT IN THE MENU STRUCTURE SOMEWHERE 
UM YEAH UM SYSTEM PROPERTIES UM PARENTAL CONTROL 
YEAH 
MM 
UM WE WILL YEAH 
IT IT HAS TO BE FAST 
YOU DON'T WANT TO TO GO DOWN AND WATCH THE NEWS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND TURN IT ON AND WAIT TWENTY SECONDS FOR FOR UH THE LOGO ON SCREEN AND THEN REMEMBER YOUR CODE AND ALL KINDS OF SETTINGS 
MM-HMM 
WHY 
MM-HMM 
YOU C MAY AS LIKE WHEN THERE'S UH X. P. UH A SIMPLE LOG IN DO YOU JUST PUSH UH ONE OR TWO OR THREE 
AND IF YOU PUSH PARENTS THEN YEAH 
IT LOGO ON 
YEAH 
AND IF YOU PUTS A YOU 
UH-HUH 
AND IF YOU W YOU PUSH P CHILDREN UH YOU DON'T HAVE TO UH LOG IN BUT YOU CAN ONLY WATCH UH CHILDREN'S CHANNELS OR UH OKAY 
WELL 
YEAH 
WELL MAYBE UM SOME IDEA ON THAT 
JUST MAKE THROUGH A REMOTE IS IT IS BUT MAKE AN OPTION TO INSERT PROFILES 
'CAUSE OF MY GRANDAD WOULD BUY THIS REMOTE UH WOULDN'T WANT TO BOTHER WITH ALL ALL THE ALL THE UH THINGS TO DO 
JUST MAKE IT AN OPTION IN MENU INS INSTALL POWERFUL PROFILES OR SOMETHING 
UM BE WILL STILL SOME QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT HOW TO INCORPORATE THESE ONES 
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SOME CHANNELS THEY UH CANNOT USE BUT WELL I I WHEN I THINK UH YEAH FOR THE F FOR ALL THE STANDARD CHANNELS 
AND ONLY FOR MAYBE AFTER TEN O'CLOCK UH IN THE EVENING VIOLENT FILMS AND MOVIES UH WILL COME AND UH MAYBE MAYBE SOME SOME TIMING UH WILL BE UH NEEDED INSTEAD OF UH OF CHANNELS 
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WATCHING UH I DON'T KNOW YOU'RE IN THE AT DAY UH CARTOONS WILL COME UP UM ONE MAYBE FRIDAY NIGHT 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH THE DISADVANTAGE VANTAGE IS THAT SOMEONE WILL HAS TO SEND ALL THE SHOW VIEW NUMBERS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY REMOTES AND DATA AT ALL 
WELL HAVE TO DECIDE UH 
THAT ISN'T POSSIBLE 
WELL YEAH YOU COULD SAY IF PARENTAL CONTROL IS ONLY IT IT'LL GO FROM FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN WITH THE PAGE UP THEN BUT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH IN A SEPARATE MENU UH OPTION 
YEAH WELL YEAH I 
A MAIL IT FROM MANAGEMENT THAT IT'S VERY POPULAR TO USE VOICE RECON RECOGNITION 
BUT I DON'T THINK WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. UH HEARING LOUD NOISES FROM THE T. V. SOMEONE SCREAMING ONE AND YOU IF THE CHANNEL SWITCHES UH YEAH 
YEAH 
W YOU CAN PUT IT ON CHIP ANYWAY SO UH 
AS LONG AS IT'S ISN'T A PRIMARY FEATURE OF THE REMOTE BUT UH 
OPTIONAL IN 
BUT HOW WE DO IT 
WELL I THINK ALSO IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUTS VERY DIFFICULT TO INCORPORATE 
SO WE SHOULD MAKE IT TOO COMPLEX 
SO AT SOME MENU UH FUNCTION YOU CHOOSE PARENTAL CONTROL AND MAYBE FOUR FILES WILL EMERGE FROM MENU WHERE PUT IT IN 
BUT UH HOW HOW IT'S GONNA WORK UH UH WELL F BE A PROBLEM 
MM-HMM 
WELL 
YOU I I THINK BEST WOULD BE UH TO PUT IT ON AND MAKE IT IN MENU OPTION 
YOU CAN PUT IN YEAH 
AND YOU CAN JUST UH SO WHEN YOU BUY IT YOU CAN SELECT UM PERSONAL PREFERENCE PARENTAL CONTROL ON AND THE PASSWORD OR SOMETHING 
UH IT'S A P YEAH 
WELL MAYBE YOU JUST HAVE TO RESTRICT IT OUT WHAT PROGRAMS WHERE THE PARENT SAYS YOU CANNOT WATCH CHANNEL SEVEN 
NINE AND TEN AND YOU CANNOT WATCH ALL CHANNELS AFTER TEN O'CLOCK 
AND THERE'S JUST SOME LITTLE UH CLICK ON THE REMOTE 
NO NO IT'S VERY SIMPLE 
THREE UH TH I UH I'VE SEEN SOME OF REMOTES WHO HAVE A CLICK ON IT 
SO THE REMOTE DOES DOESN'T TRANSMIT WHEN IT'S AFTER TWELVE CLOCK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL THAT'S TO PUT IT VERY BLUNT THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM 
JUST HAVE UM THE PARENTS BUY UH SOME GLUE AND UH IT'S NOT NOT A PART OF THE REMOTE 
YOU HAVE TO F YEAH 
UH OR MAKE IT OURSELVES VERY DIFFIC 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OH 
YEAH 
I'M LISTENING 
UM WELL 
WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT IS JUST A MENU STRUCTURE WHEN YOU DON'T USE IT IS SIMPLE 
AND WHEN YOU PUSH UH SYSTEM PROPERTIES UH ENTIRE LIST POPS UP WITH E EV ALL KIND OF OF STUFF YOU CAN PROGRAM 
SOME SOME BENCH MARKER 
OH 
UH LOGO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL YOU CAN SHOW SOMEBODY A LOGO FOUR POINT FIVE SECONDS THEY'LL STILL REMEMBER IT 
AND IT TO L LINGER ON EVERY TIME YOU USE IT 
VERY ANNOYING 
YEAH 
YEAH I IT'S OK FOR F 
UH FOR THE NEXT MEETING RIGHT 
UM 
STAY HERE AND 
P. 
OH NO NEW EMAIL 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
SO YOU 
YEAH 
HERE 
OR UH 
YEAH 
IF YOU GOT A ONE 
SO STUPID MANAGER 
HEY PROJECT MANAGER 
WHAT WAS IT PROBLEM 
THE LAPTOP 
IT HANG HUNG 
UH UH 
OH 
PROJECT MANAGER 
YOU'RE OUR PROJECT MANAGER 
MISTER 
MISTER OF 
I'M SORRY 
OKAY 
GO ON 
YEAH BUT WHEN THE POWER GETS LOW YOU HAVE TO SHAKE IT OR SOMETHING 
UH AND UH UH 
HMM 
MM YEAH 
IT'S TOO LESS SPACE 
AND WHEN THE BATTERY DOESN'T WORK I USUALLY SHAKE IT IT 
SO LIKE SLAMMING ON IT 
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME 
HMM 
BUT ARE YOU GOING TO DRAW IT 
THE YEAH 
YEAH 
UH I C I CAN'T IMAGINE 
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HOW HOW IT LOOKS LIKE 
YEAH 
DESIGN 
MM-HMM 
OH 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL I THINK UH WE'RE GOING TO SELL TELL TEN MILLIONS OF THEM 
SO UH I BET A BIG COMPANY ON UH KOREA OR TAIWAN LIKE UH SAMSUNG CAN GIVE US UH A BIG DISCOUNT ON THE CHIPS SO 
U USUALLY CHIPS OR UH AREN'T MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ONE DOLLAR 
SO 
THAT THAT SHOULDN'T BE A REAL ISSUE I THINK 
YEAH A COMBINATION 
YEAH 
LIKE AN UH K UH 
C UH YEAH 
WELL 
YEAH 
COMBINE THEM 
OKAY 
OF COURSE 
FIFTY CENT 
RUBBER 
RATHER HARD 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK THAT TOUCH SCREENS ARE GENERALLY SQUARE 
BUT IT'S THE CASE YOU PUT AROUND IT THAT MAKES THE SHAPE 
HMM 
YEAH OKAY BUT IF YOU HAVE A SQUARE UH L. C. D. SCREEN 
AND YOU PUT A CASE AROUND IT THAT HAS UH LIKE BULBS OR THAT THAT COVERS PART OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
THAT 
THAT'S IT'S CUSTOM CUSTOMISABLE AND 
YEAH ME TOO 
MM YEAH 
YEAH 
CAN I UH DO MY THING 
IT UH 
EXPERT MAP 
OKAY UH 
LAST WEEK 
I WANT TO UH PARIS AND MILAN FOR SOME TREND WATCHING 
FOR MARKETING 
OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND I WANT TO PARIS AND MILAN 
IN PARIS AND MILAN WE UH ASKED DIFFERENT PEOPLE UH DIFFERING IN GO AND AN INCOME 
UH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO SPEND UM WHAT THEY LIKE IN DESIGN UH AND MATERIAL NOWADAYS 
FINDINGS 
OUR MAIN AUDIENCE UH SO THAT'S PEOPLE BELOW FORTY UH PREFER THE FOLLOWING 
AT FIRST THE COLOURS OF FRUIT 
VERY BASIC COLOURS LIKE JANUS EXPLAINED 
UM FRESH COLOURS UH GREEN RED UH STRAWBERRY RED UH YELLOW BANANA YELLOW 
UM CONSIDERING MATERIAL UM 
YEAH 
THEY LIKE SPONGY MATERIAL LIKE YEAH A SPONGE BALL 
LIKE A S SOFT MATERIAL 
JANUS M UH MENTIONED IT ALSO 
I THINK UH DID SOME UH 
SOME FINDINGS HIMSELF 
YOU WERE YOU WEREN'T IN PARIS 
OKAY 
LIKE THIS 
LIKE BIG UH G FLASHY COLOURS 
FRESH 
IT'S NICE I THINK 
OKAY OUR SECONDARY AUDIENCE UH PEOPLE ABOVE FORTY A FORTY YEARS IN AGE THEY LIKE THE DARK TRADITIONAL COLOURS 
OH 
YEAH UH MATERIALS LIKE WOOD THAT 
NO NO JU JUST J JUST A W 
NO OKAY BUT JUST JUST A WOODEN UH LIKE 
LIKE UH YOU HAVE THOSE FAKE UH FAKE PANELS ON THE FLOOR 
TH THAT ISN'T WOOD ANYWAY BUT OKAY 
BUT THAT'S OUR SECONDARY AUDIENCE 
SO UH WE DECIDED TO TAKE 
MM YEAH THE PEOPLE BELOW FORTY 
SO THAT THIS DOESN'T APPLY 
'KAY THE THIRD 
OH THERE'RE SOME OVERALL THOUGHTS ABOUT NEW REMOTE CONTROLS 
THEY HAVE TO LOOK FANCY 
UM THEY SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICAL IN INNOVATIVE 
THAT MEANS UH THERE HAVE TO BE FANCY THINGS IN 
UH AND EASY TO USE 
BUT THAT'S COMMON 
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
WE HAVE TO ME TO A UM AT THE MAIN AUDIENCE 
AND UH THEREFORE USE FRESH COLOURS 
UH I'LL I'LL COME TO THAT IN A SECOND POINT 
HERE THINK ABOUT REMOVABLE COVERS AS SOON IN MOBILE TELEPHON TELEPHONE MARKET 
TO CUSTOMISE YOUR OWN REMOTE CONTROL 
LIKE THE NOKIA UH THE REMOVABLE COVERS UH JUST PUT A RED ON IT AND GO TO THE SHAPE AND BUY A GREEN ONE 
UH A THIRD MATERIAL BEING USED UH COULD WILL BE STUFF LIKE RUBBER 
UM TWO ADVANTAGES 
UH IT FITS WITHIN THE CURRENT MARKET TRENDS 
AND UH IT ADDS SAFETY TO YOUR REMOTE UH WHEN YOU DROP IT 
SO 
UH TO COME BACK TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK UH AND THE PEOPLE IN MILAN AND PARIS ALSO THINK THAT UH THE RUBBER SHOULD BE PRETTY HARD 
LIKE UH 
SEEN ON REGULAR MOBILE PHONES 
ACTUALLY THEY HAVE A LOT IN COMMON 
THE PHONES AND THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH EXACTLY 
UH IN MY SECOND SHEET OF PERSONAL PREFERENCES UH WE HAVE TO RECONSIDER THE SPEECH FUNCTION UH RECOGNITION 
UH IT'S VERY INNOVATIVE 
INNOVATIVE 
YEAH LIKE SOMETHING 
YOU YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MARKET IS JUST SCREAMING FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE SPEAK UH SPEECH RECOGNITION AND STUFF 
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP THE COST IN UH IN MIND ABOUT IT 
YEAH IT IT CAN BE UH VERY EXPENSIVE 
'KAY SECOND 
UH BUILDING GAMES LIKE SNAKE OR TETRIS TO AMUSE THE YOUNGER USERS 
UH ALSO THE LINK WITH UH MOBILE PHONES 
OH 
NO BUT NO OKAY 
BUT YOU DON'T SEE GAMES WHEN YOU'RE D WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A TELEPHONE CALL 
IT'S JUST THE SAME 
YEAH 
WHEN YOU'RE AT COLLEGE 
OH NO 
YOU AL YOU ALSO TAKE UH TO YOU TAKE YOUR IPAC AND GO UH PLAY GAMES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I DO THAT BUT OKAY AND UM 
AND THIRD I STICK WITH AT THE LOGO ON FUNCTIONALITY UH WITH THE SLOGAN TAKE PARENTAL CONTROL TO A NEW DIMENSION 
THAT'S IT 
YEAH 
UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A BACK AND FORTH COME UP UH BUTTON 
LI LIKE AN UH INTERNET EXPLORER 
YEAH OKAY BUT DOES IT THAT IS FOR UH GOING FROM FRO TO FIVE 
BUT IF YOU GO FROM TWO AT EIGHT AND YOU WANT 
YEAH AND ONE TWO 
THAT YOU CAN SWITCH SWITCH EASY 
YEAH IT IS 
YEAH 
MM NO 
THAT'S IT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT 
WHAT I SEE UH HOW I SEE IT AS YOU PUT IT IN THE THE REMOTE AND THEN YOU HAVE LIKE A WINDOWS LOG ON SCREEN WITH PARENTS CHILDREN 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND W WHEN YOU WANT TO USE THE PARENTS UH OPTION YOU HAVE TO 
YEAH OK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
P PUSH PARENTS 
THAT THEN THEN THEN YOU HAVE TO UH GO TO THREE DIGIT UH LOGO ON 
LIKE TWO IN THERE 
AND IT'S ONE 
IT AUTOMATICALLY GOES YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
VI VIOLENT T. V. 
YEAH OF COURSE 
YEAH 
YEAH W IT JUST HAS TO BE W WHEN IT'S DELIVER OUT OF THE STORE IT HAS TO BE JUST SIMPLE AND PLAIN 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL IT PERSONALLY UH 
IF I GOT KIDS AND I COULD CHOOSE BETWEEN UH TWO REMOTE CONTROLS 
NO UH W WITH PARENT CONTROL AND ONE WITHOUT AND I WOULD WOULD BUY THE ONE WITH 
I TH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT YEAH BUT THAT ISN'T POSSIBLE 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH AND 
AND AND YOU KNOW W UH WHEN YOU INSTALL ANOTHER DEVICE 
UH CHILDREN CAN STILL GO UP TO THE T. V. P POP OPEN UH THE THING AND AND AND GO 
GO TO A CHANNEL 
YEAH YEAH OF COURSE 
BUT 
YEAH 
UH IT'S YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
BUT IT'S JUST AN AN ADDED FEATURE FEATURE 
MM YEAH 
YEAH LIKE IF VOICE RECOGNITION IS TOO MUCH I THINK 
BUT GAMES 
IT DOESN'T 
YEAH 
THAT THAT DOESN'T C THAT DOESN'T C 
YEAH THAT THAT DOESN'T COST A LOT OF EXTRA RESOURCES I THINK 
YEAH IT'S IT'S ON IT 
BUT IT UM I I THINK SO BUT 
YEAH 
TO PUT YEAH TO PUT IT IN ALWAYS 
YEAH BUT T. V. S AREN'T CAPABLE OF SENDING 
YEAH 
I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST 
A ABLE TO RECEIVE 
YEAH SOME 
BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH J JUST SOME RULES 
YEAH OKAY 
BUT IN THE T. V. 
AT LEAST MY T. V. S A AS A COMPARTMENT WHICH YOU CAN PRESS 
AND THERE ARE BUTTONS UH BEHIND IT WHICH YOU CAN SEE IF YOU DO IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T HAVE A 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH OF COURSE 
YEAH 
OR J YEAH 
UH I HAVE TO UH CONSULT MY LEGAL ADVISOR ABOUT IT 
CONSENSUS 
OH 
OH 
I I HAVE ONE THING LEFT 
MAYBE FOR UH JEROME 
UM THE VIEWS 
MAYBE IT'S UH HANDY TO BUILD IN AN EXPERT VIEW AND A SIMPLE VIEW 
YEAH 
LIKE IT IN THE EXPERTS VIEW YOU HAVE A LOT OF MORE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
MM YEAH OKAY 
FAIRLY ENOUGH 
YEAH 
YEAH WH WHICH BUTTONS YOU LOOK OR NOT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
JUST LEAVE THE OTHER NUMBERS AWAY 
OKAY 
GO ON 
A LITTLE CHAT

UH AND UH IN THE SURVEY FROM UH MILAN AND PARIS UH TO UH TO COME TO THAT UH UH THE DO THE OLDER PEOPLE ARE UH MORE WILLING TO UH TO SPEND MONEY AN EXTRA FEATURES

THEY WANT UH THEY WANT MORE LUXURY STUFF BUT THEY HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT AND THEY WANT TO BE TO BUY THAT

OH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
DO YOU THINK 
WELL NOW YOU CAN SHAKE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
KINETIC 
YEAH 
WHO BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO GO TO KINETIC YOU'RE UH YOU'RE IN THIRTEEN AND A HALF AND YOU MUST GO TO FLAT 
AND I THINK NOW IT'S IT'S MORE OF UH A COMPROMISE 
THING 
AND IF YOU MAKE THE SINGLE CURVE UH JUST A BIG CURVE 
THEN IT'S UH THEN IT'S UH YEAH ONE BIG GOOD CURVE 
I WAS GOING TO UH SAY NASTY WORDS BUT I DON'T 
THIS IS STRANGE BY THE WAY 
WOOD IS UM SO IS IS CHEAPER THAN RUBBER 
WE THOUGHT THAT WOOD WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE 
YEAH MAYBE 
BUT UH THAT THIS IS THIS IS IT 
YEAH 
OKAY THIS IS IT 
I'M GONNA SAVE IT 
YEAH 
OKAY WELL 
CONSIDERING WE HAVE

YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU HAD EXPECTED TO TO TO BE UH MORE MORE UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP YEP 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH AND AND MAYBE SOME UH FUNCTIONS FOR UH UH UH CIRCLE OR UH A SQUARE 
YOU HAVE TO DRAW IT YOURSELF NOW

HMM 
SORRY

OH SORRY 
SELECT 
YEAH 
HERE THAT 
SO YOU HAVE SO YOU SAW YOU HAVE A LITTLE UH 
UH YOU CAN 
YEAH THANK YOU 
YOU CAN GO UH 
THERE 
SO THERE THE THE THE FUNCTIONALITY IS THERE BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IDEAL AND IT'S IT'S VERY IT COSTS A LOT OF TIME TO UH 
IT IS 
AND THAT'S A PITY IF YOU UH IF YOU HAVE UH THIRTY FORTY MINUTES UH FOR THIS KIND OF THINGS 
AND WE ARE NOW WITH FOR PEOPLE BUT IT WILL IMAGINE YOU ARE HERE YOU'RE WITH THE TEN PEOPLE AND EVERYONE UH 
YEAH 
TWO MINUTES OF DRAWING YEAH 
YEAH

YEAH JUST LIKE HE SAID WITH THE WITH THE A SCREEN WHICH YOU CAN WRITE ALSO UH A KIND OF VOTING UH MECHANISM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY SO 
UH WELL JUST ABOUT BECAUSE UH 
YEAH TOMORROW 
UH THE COSTS ARE WITHIN THE BUDGET 
UH THE PROJECT IS EVALUATED 
BUT BEFORE WE GOING TO CELEBRATE UH I HAVE UH A LITTLE QUESTION WHICH YOU CAN'T ANSWER BECAUSE UH THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF END REPORT 
I AM BUSY WITH THE END REPORT RIGHT NOW 
YOU MIGHT THINKING WHAT THE HELL WAS UH DOING UH

BUT IT'S NOT UH FULLY FINISHED YET 
UM THIS IS ABOUT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THE THINGS YEAH YEAH 
OH YEAH 
I'M UH WHEN I SAID IT I REMEMBER I HAD TO HERE 
MARKETING EXPERT OKAY 
UM 
BUT THE OTHER FUNCTIONS WHERE UH WHICH ARE MOST USED AND UH WHICH MUST UH IMMEDIATELY BE VISIBLE IN OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL 
UM IT MUST BE UH SIMPLE IT IS VERY CLEAR WHAT TO DO NEED TO THE YOUNGER PEOPLE 
SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WHO UH WHAT KIND THINGS UH MUST BE ON IT AND UH YEAH 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND YOU I CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT DUTCH 
OK OKAY OKAY I 
I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT 
SO THIS ONE'S FIRST 
YOU GO THERE AND YOU GO THERE 
SO OKAY 
WELL MAYBE I CAN THEN DO IT IN TWO THREE 
OF THE ORDER IS AN UH SO SO UH IMPORTANT THAT'S THE WORD FOR 
OH 
THEN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
UH WELL ALL THE THINGS WE HAVE UH DISCUSSED UH THE ENERGY WHICH UH TURN IT TO BE UH BATTERIES SO THAT'S 
YEAH BECAUSE YEAH 
UH UH HERE IT IS STILL DOUBLE CURVE THE RUBBER THE FLASHY THE FRUITY THE REMOVABLE 
UH THE BUTTONS HMM 
NOT DOUBLE ANYMORE 
ANY ABOUT THAT THIS IS WHAT UM 
YEAH 
AND THE THE ADDED FUNCTIONS LIKE TETRIS SNAKE IT'S UNDER THE PARENTAL CONTROL THE TOUCH SCREEN 
SO IT'S UH JUST A SUMMARY OF WHAT UH WE HAD DISCUSSED UH 
UH IT'S VERY CHEAP YOU YOU MAYBE YOU YOU YOU YOU COME TO UH 
IT'S VERY NECESSARY 
YEAH BUT IT STILL HAS SOME YEAH 
OKAY BUT SO WE CAN DISCUSS THAT UH 
WE CAN DISCUSS THAT KIND OF THINGS I THINK WITH THE 
WITH THE THE BOARD OF UH 
WHAT'S OUT WHAT'S THE COMPANY CALLED 
I JUST KEEP FORGETTING IT 
REAL REAL REACTION 
REAL REACTION YEAH 
OKAY SO UH ANYBODY UH MISSES SOMETHING HERE BUT UH 
YEAH OKAY THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA WRITE B BETWEEN NOW 
BUT I IN HERE NOTHING UH 
MM-HMM 
YES 
YEAH TOUCH SCREEN I'VE MENTIONED 
YEAH OKAY WELL I GONNA REDESIGN UH SOMETHING NEW 
NO 
BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL UH FIVE MINUTES FROM TO FINISH MEETING 
OH THAT'S COOL TIM 
FINISH MEETING NOW 
WELL I'M I'M

I AM THE ONE WHO CAN SAY THAT 
YEAH 
HEREBY THE MEETING IS FINISHED 
YEAH 
EVALUATION 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S GONNA BE TOO PROBLEM 
YEAH WELL SURE 
OH 
YEAH UH WELL AND SO YOU SAW WE WOULD JUST HAVE THE BASIC REMOTE WITH THE PANEL L. C. D. UH SCREEN 
WELL THIS WOULD BE THE MAIN BUTTONS UH YOU COULD UH CHANGE THEM LATER ON ON YOUR OWN PROFILE IF YOU WANT IT 
BUT WELL IT'S STANDARD THEY WILL BE DELIVERED WITH THIS KIND OF UH SET UP 
WE HAVE THE MORE ADVANCED MENU UH SETTING RIGHT HERE 
WE HAVE THE SUB MENUS AND STU STUFF 
WE MADE A TAPE UH OR A FRONT VIEW 
JUST USE LIKE YOU WANNA UH BACK VIEW 
SO YOU CAN USE THIS UH THERE THERE ARE UH TWO UH WEIRD BUMPS IN IT 
THIS IS FOR UH THE ADDED UH EFFECT OF UH WELL UH Y YOUTH AND DYNAMIC 
AND UH THIS IS FOR THE ARTISTIC EFFECT 
WELL WHAT WE FIGURED IS UH WE'LL SHOW YOU A PICTURE LATER ON YOU HAVE MORE BE A BETTER IDEA AFTER THAT 
BUT DO IS FREE TO STAY IN BALANCE WITH THESE TWO UH WITH THESE TWO 
AND SO WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE TABLE IT WILL JUST LAY DOWN 
IT WON'T UH ROLL AROUND OR STUFF 
BUT IT WILL LIE MORE IN YOUR HAND LIKE AN OLD TELEPHONE MAYBE OR LIKE THIS OLD UH PHONES 
Y Y YOU MAY GET THE IDEA 
SO TH THIS IS ABOUT UH HOW WE FIGURED IT SHOULD BE 
THE S PANEL WE GO YOU WOULD HIDE WITH SOME MORE UH RUBBER LAYERS LIKE WE DISCUSSED EARLY ON 
UH YOU WOULD SO YOU WOULDN'T IS THE UH STRAIGHT PANEL BUT MORE FLUIDLY AND ROUND 
YEAH 
AND UH IN THESE BUMPS YOU COULD ACTUALLY UH PUT SOME ELECTRONICS UH THAT WOULD YOU CAN MAKE A MORE THINNER UH DESIGN 
AND THAT WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK VERY NICE YEAH 
AND UH ABOUT THE COLOUR WHAT HAVE 
YEAH OF UH S COLOURS DO YOU DO YOU HAVE THE PICTURE IN UH 
OH YEAH 
NOW WELL THIS IS THE IDEA BUT UH THE BUMPS 
UH YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A V A VERY UH YOUTHFUL UH DYNAMIC UH EXTERIOR 
IT UH YOU JUST WANT TO HOLD IT YOU UH YOU ARE YOUNG AND UH DYNAMIC LIKE SO 
YEAH IT'S LIKE AN E BUT THIS IS FOR CHILDREN 
WE WE WANT A MORE ADULT VERSION 
BUT THIS IS LIKE A REMOTE CONTROL FOR CHILDREN 
A WEEMOTE 
YEAH 
HEY THAT'S ACTUALLY A BRILLIANT UH MARKETING STAND 
UH BUT IS THIS ACTUALLY BASIC THE IDEA 
WE WE JUST WANT TO BUILD A MORE UH ADULT VERS ADULT VERSION OF OF THIS 
AND AND FOR COLOURS WE WE FIGURED STARTING WITH BASIC COLOURS LIKE UH WHAT ARE METALLIC GREY 
THESE ARE THE TECHNOLOGICAL COLOURS ACTUALLY IS TO DO 
OR BLUE OR WHATEVER 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH MAYBE YEAH PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT 
UH I I WOULD I WOULD ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THIS SOUNDS LOGICAL 
NAH 
YEAH 
YEAH L LOOK LIKE THIS LIKE THIS 
THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T TOO MUCH AS IT 
I IF 
YEAH 
THE BUTTONS I 
YEAH UH SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD BE NICE 
OKAY THAT'S THAT'S IT FROM US 
UH UH 
WHY 
YEAH IT'S NOT JUST UH DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF FORTY 
IT'S ALSO DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE ABOVE FORTY 
SO 
I HAVE I'VE YEAH TWO OR THREE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST UH THE QU QUESTION IS MADE IT IS IT DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH AGE BELOW FORTY 
BUT IT'S ALSO DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE OF AGE ABOVE FORTY 
SO 
I'LL SAY IT'S ABOUT THREE 
YEAH I I THINK 
YEAH 
YES 
YES 
YEAH 
LEADS TO USER FACE YEAH 
YEAH FALSE 
UH HMM 
YEAH TH THEY ARE BIG AND COLOUR 
YEAH BUT BUT THE TELETEXT BUTTON 
YEAH YOU CAN ACH THAT'S IN A MENU 
SO IT'S W YEAH IT IT IT IT ISN'T ENTIRELY UNCLEAR BUT SO I WOULDN'T GIVE IT A SEVEN 
I WOULD GIVE IT A MORE A FIVE OR A SIX 
UH I DON I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT DO YOU THINK UH MISTER PROJECT MANAGER 
YEAH 
YEAH IT HAS THIS ALL THESE FRUITY COLOURS AND IT HAS A STRANGE SHAPE 
SO IF YOU SEE IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE FINDING OUT 
WELL THEN UH THEN I'LL GO FOR FOR 
BECAUSE UH FOR US BETWEEN THREE AND UH UH ALSO BETWEEN BETWEEN TRUE AND FALSE 
SO I'LL I'LL GO FOR FOR 
WOAH 
YEAH THAT THAT'S A BETTER QUESTION ACTUALLY 
WELL IF I IF YOU USE A STRANGE SHAPE LYING SOMEWHERE UH THEN YOU'D UH RECOGNISE IT AS WHOA THAT IS STRANGE 
YEAH 
YEAH WHAT IS THAT 
SO IT'S 
YEAH 
YEAH RUBBER IS KIND OF SOFT 
WELL I DON YEAH IT IS KIND OF 
IT 
NO 
OH 
IT COULD YEAH 
FUNCTIONAL ABILITY 
NO IT'S IT I I'LL GO FOR TWO 
MY VOTE'S ON TWO 
YES 
YES IT 
YEAH THEY ARE BUILT IN 
NOT DOWN 
YOU REALLY LIKE THE PARENTAL ADVISORY 
YEAH UH MADE IT 
NO 
UM IT 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH NO NO 
NO 
YES 
NO 
UH WE HAVE NO 
WE HAVE NO 
NO SEV ZERO 
WELL THAT'S UM YEAH SPEECH RECOGNITION AND SO 
A ZERO 
NO 
NO 
YEAH 
JUST GO ON 
THEN WE'LL SEE UH WE'LL WE'LL SEE UH WHA HOW MUCH WE ARE OVER BUDGET 
ZERO 
I DON'T THINK SO 
NO THIS IS A STANDARD COLOUR 
YES THIS IS A SPECIAL COLOUR 
THAT'S AN ADD ONE 
NO 
THESE THREE 
WELL WE'RE ONLY FOR OUR OVER BUDGET 
BUT 
WELL THERE CASE WE CAN MAKE IT SINGLE CURVED OR UNCURVED 
YEAH 
OKAY SURE 
YEAH SURE 
OKAY WELL Y YOU CAN GO FROM DOUBLE CURVED IT SINGLE CURVED 
AND THAT WOULD SOLVE THE BUDGET PROBLEM 
YEAH 
IT'S JUST YEAH WELL THE SINGLE CURVE THAT 
YEAH 
EXACTLY YEAH 
WE GOING TO CUT 
YEAH WE JUST MAKE IT FLAT 
BUT YOU DO L 
FUNCTION 
WORTH DOES IT HAVE ADDED WORTH 
NO UM 
YEAH WELL LET'S ASSUME IT IS 
WE WE SHOULD ASSUME IT I THAT IT IS 
BUT I I FIGURED THAT THE KINETIC WOULD BE A MARKETING PROMOTION 
OR IF YOU UH PROMOTE A KINETIC UM I KINETIC REMOTE CONTROL I MEAN THAT WOULD BE SELL BETTER THAN IN A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL 
NO WELL Y I MEAN UH Y YOU CAN GO INTO YOUR NEIGHBOUR AND TELL HIM UH MY K UH REMOTE CONTROL IS KINETIC 
YOU HAVE STANDARD OLD BATTERY CONTROL UH REMOTE CON 
TRUE 
IT IS POSSIBLE BUT YOU CAN'T USE DOUBLE UH CURVES FOR TITANIUM 
THAT'S ONE OF THE FUNCTIONABILITY UH 
WELL I TH I THINK YOU TWO UH ESPECIALLY YOU AND UH AND UH DANIEL 
YOU DO YOU YOU BOTH HAD UH THE LESS CREATIVE UH RELIES ON THE PROJECT 
'CAUSE I THINK UM 
I THINK JEROEN AND I WE HAD A MORE DESIGN WE COULD HAVE MORE WE HAD MORE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY THEN THEN YOU TWO 
OH 
NAH THE LEADERSHIP WASN'T CRAPPY IT WAS THE OLDER THAT WAS CRAPPY 
NAH 
IN THE LEADERSHIP WAS OKAY 
YEAH IT WAS GOOD 
TRY TO LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKE 
AND WE WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN 
YEAH THAT WENT W IT WENT WELL 
IT'S IT'S JUST UH 
NAH 
YEAH WE WE HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH THE PEN BUT 
YEAH BUT SO 
YEAH 
OH 
NO I HAVE TO WORKING 
BUT UH YEAH WELL UH 
NO IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH ADDED VALUE AT THE 
YEAH 
KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
OR TEXT FUNCTION 
JUST TO TO TYPE TEXT AND THAT THAT WOULD BE UH EXCELLENT 
MINE 
OH 
BUT UH PROBLEM AS WELL YOU CAN'T DISCUSS ANYTHING WELL Y YOU C UH YOU CAN 
BUT YOU WILL DISCUSS A LOT LESS THAN L LIKE WE DID NOW 
W I MEAN UH W W W IN ONE PERSON SO MAYBE SAID THERE 
BUT WELL UH I WE SAID UH NO I W TH THINK TWO BECAUSE THIS AND THIS AND THEN YOU CAN REACT UH ON IT 
BUT IF YOU YOU PUT A THREE ON IT UH JUST FIGURE WELL EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT I'M KNOWING SO THEY'LL ALL JUST PUT A TWO ONE 
YEAH BUT IT WOULD YEAH 
YEAH OKAY THE FOR PROCESSING PART 
BUT THEN UH I THINK THE IDEA OF ONE PERSON ENTERING IT AND THE REST UH DISCUSSING AT THAT UH ISN'T THAT BAD IDEA ACTUALLY 
NOT THAT YOUR OPINION ISN'T VALUED BUT BUT STILL 
YEAH SURE 
Y YIKES 
SEVENTY FIVE PAGES 
SO YOU YOU FINISHED IT ACTUALLY AND SO WE JUST HAVE TO READ IT AND SAY YES OR NO 
IT'S NOT DOUBLE 
UH IT'S NOT DOUBLE ANYMORE EH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
ONE THING UH 
ONE SMALL THING UH THE ADDED FUNCTIONS 
HE WAS IT INCLUDED IN THE COST 
I DON'T THINK SO UH 
IT'S VERY CHEAP 
OKAY UM HEREBY IS THE MEETING IS FINISHED 
YOU 
EVALUATION CRITERIA 
OOPS 
SOME CREATIVE UH 
OH 
YEAH 
OK OKAY 
SHALL I GIVE A SHORT INTRODUCTION AND THEN UH 
OKAY 
J. AND J. OKAY 
TAKE IT AWAY 
UM THIS WAS OUR FIRST CONCEPT 
WE DECIDED TO USE A SINGLE TOUCH SCREEN 
SO WE'VE WORKED OUT THIS CONCEPTS HOW TO HOW TO HOLD IT WHERE TO PUT THE BUTTONS AND AND STUFF 
AND UM WELL WE BEGIN WITH UH WITH A FORM OF SHAPE 
THAT IS UH IS EASY TO HOLD W IN ONE HAND LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED 
SO WE MADE I IT A LITTLE BIT LESS THICK AND UH IT HAS SOME AR ARTISTIC MEANING 
NO 
THIS UH ISN'T NOTHING 
DO MAYBE UH IS BETTER 
UM WELL DURING THE MEETING I SHOWED YOU THE CONCEPT OF UH PLACING THE BUTTONS ON TOP USABLE WITH YOUR THUMB 
AND UH THE MENU STRUCTURE UH IF NECESSARY WITH YOUR OTHER HAND SO IT'S JUST GONNA HOLD IT EASILY 
AND IT HAS TO BE ACCE ACCESSIBLE WITH YOUR UH OTHER HAND OUT OF COURSE 
SO WE BEGAN UH WORKING OUT A CONCEPT 
YEAH THE PANEL JUST UH OF COURSE GOES LIKE THIS 
BUT THE OVERLAYING LAYER IS UH A LITTLE BIT UH CURVED AND STUFF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH WE ADDED THAT THIS UM CAN BE HELD WITH YOUR HANDS FOR THIS MAXIMUM IS UM YEAH ONE AND A HALF CENTIMETRES 
SO YOU HAVE ROOM HERE FOR YOUR BATTERY AND MAYBE EVEN OTHER UM ELECTRONIC CHIPS 
SO AND YOU CAN JUST BE THE THE LAYER OF THE TOUCHSCREEN AND SOME HAVE SOME WIRES UNDERNEATH IT TO MAKE IT IS UH THEN AS POSSIBLE IN THE MIDDLE FOR GOOD GRIP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT WOULD BE BEST TO TO APPEAL TO A BROAD PUBLIC AND MAKE THE COVERS EXCHANGEABLE 
SO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BUY AN ORANGE AND A RED AND BLUE AND A PURPLE 
BUT WHEN THE O OLDER PEOPLE UH GO ON THE SHAPE AND THEY USE UH AN ORANGE UM REMOTE CONTROL IT WOULD BE LESS APPEALING THAN A WHITE ONE 
AND YOUNG PEOPLE WE THINK OR A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE THEY THINK UH I'LL BUY FOR A COUPLE OF REUSE SOME NOI NICE HIP UH 
WELL 
UM I THINK A COVER IS NECESSARY 'CAUSE ALS OTHERWISE YOU'LL JUST HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
SO THERE MUST BE SOME CHEAP STANDARD COVER UM MAYBE WHITE OR SOMETHING 
THAT'S COULD COMES WITH IT AND YOU CAN BUY SO WE CAN MAKE EXTRA MONEY 
OKAY 
THE OTHER WAY AROUND YOU MEAN 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY YEAH 
WELL YEAH A COLOUR OF A WOOD STYLE A WHITE C AND UH A COUPLE OF UH HOPE UH FRUITY COLOURS 
AND L UH L DELIVERED STANDARD WITH A FRUITY COLOUR BUT NOT TOO NOT TOO MUCH 
THIS IS BANANA AND MANGO NOT NOT PURPLE OR P ORANGE AND YELLOW 
OH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
NO 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
IT'S MY TURN 
MM 
YEAH 
IN IN A LITTLE MORE ON THE MIDDLE 
NO UH THERE ARE YEAH 
YEAH IT WILL BE PRIMARY APPEALING TO TO M MINUS FORTY BUT ALSO APPEALING TO 
YEAH 
IT'S WOW 
YEAH IT'S THE MARKETING UH ANGLE ON TELEVISION 
WE HAVE A WONDERFUL 
YEAH 
WELL IT'S ALSO FANCY THEN 
YEAH 
OF COURSE 
WE HAVE A PERFECT REMOTE 
YES 
YEAH YEAH UH THEY HAVE TO AGREE BUT 
I'M THE USER INTERFACE UH EXPERT 
UM UH NO 
YOU YOU'VE DIFFERENT MENU 
AND VOLUME IS IMPO YEAH 
YEAH YEAH BIG AND COLOUR 
BUT YOU COULD MAKE A TELETEXT BUTTON UH SIX 
OTHERWISE THE PEOPLE WHO READ THIS UH ARE GONNA THINK WE HAVE NO TELETEXT BUTTON 
NO 
YEAH 
BLACK AND RED 
OKAY DON'T FORGET TO SAVE IT 
OH 
UH WELL WHEN WE PUT IN FANCY COLOURS YEAH AND YEAH 
BUT UM IT IT'S NOT MAKING ANY SOUND UH HAVE WE DECIDING 
SO 
IT'LL MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
WE HAVE THE BETTER OR I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH I THINK SO 
MY REMOTE CONTROL'S BLACK 
A LITTLE BIT BUT YEAH 
OH 
OK YEAH 
IF IF YEAH F FIVE IS 
YEAH OKAY YOU'RE RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IF YOUR UH FIFTEEN REMOTES IN A DRAWER UH YOU FIND IT YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S STUPID 
UH BUT WHEN YOU LOST IT YOU'RE JUST NOT 
YEAH MOSTLY WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL IT IT'S UNDER YOUR 
MOST OF TIMES WHEN YOU LOSE IT YOU'RE SITTING ON IT 
OH 
UM I WOULD CALL UH CHOOSE TWO 'CAUSE WE DECIDED NOT TO MAKE TWO OF UH FRESH COLOURS SO IT WOULD NOT 
UM 
KINDA SOFT BUT BUT NOT THIS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH EASY TO USE VERY AFFORD 
NO YOU CAN DO TWO BECAUSE UM IT CAN BE EASIER 
BUT THEN YOU'RE L YEAH BUT THEN YOU'LL LOSE FUNCTION OF YEAH FUNCTIONALITY AND OUR FANCY UH LIKE SO 
BUT 
IT IS OUR IT IS RATHER EASY TO USE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE PRIMARY BUTTONS ALWAYS VISIBLE 
NO 
YEAH ME MEAN IT 
YEAH BUT WAITS JUST A MINUTES 
INSPIRATION 
THESE ARE THE M REGULAR REMOTES 
YES TRUE ONE 
YES ONE 
VERY MULTIFUNCTIONAL 
NO 
THIS IS USED WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION THIS 
YES 
BUT UH MAYBE MAKE IT TWO BECAUSE THE GAMES ARE IN A SUB MENU AND NOT UH IT'S NOT AN ENTIRE GAME 
YEAH OKAY 
YES 
THE DID YOU MAKE THESE ARE THE 
YEAH 
IT CHANGES TO MAYBE 
OH YAY 
OH DEAR 
HMM 
IF THEY'RE UNDER TWELVE FIFTY 
YEAH 
C 'CAUSE SO IT'S OKAY 
BATTERY YES 
NO 
NO YEAH 
KINETIC ONE 
YEAH 
NO 
IN THE ADVANCED CHIP IS UH 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU GIVE IT A SIMPLE UH NO 
NO 
Y NO 
YEAH 'CAUSE UM THE LAYER AROUND IT FITS AROUND THE BUBBLES ON THE O ON THE UH THE BACK OF THE 
UH WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE 
SO 
COULD YOU STOP A LITTLE AT THE RIGHT UM YEAH 
OH SORRY 
OR 
AND ZERO 
SPECIAL UH IS THE SPECIAL COLOUR 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH IF IF YOU'RE HONEST WE'LL UH TYPE ONE SPECIAL COLOUR

NO 
SCROLL WHEEL ON 
NO 
NO YEAH 
NO 
MM IS IT IN 
NO 
SO 
NO 
NO 
MM SINGLE CURVES 
YEAH 
JUST CUT OFF THE KINE YEAH 
OR YEAH 
YEAH WE JUST PUT A GOOD BATTERY IT IT 
MOBILE PHONES NOWADAYS 
BUT YOU CAN USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES ANYWAY JUST YOU SEE YOU HAVE TO RECHARGE THEM MANUAL 
YEAH THAT'S A COST REDUC 
OH 
YEAH SO WE HAVE TO BAKE THE B BACK FLAT AND THEN 
NO IT'S IT'S JUST ONE CURVE AND NOT A BACK UH CURVED I THINK 
OR 
OR OR THESE TWO CURVES 
OH 
YEAH BUT WHAT ELSE UH DO WE HAVE TO CUT OUT 
AN ADVANCED CHIP UH THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF PROBLEM 
ALTHOUGH CAN WE MAKE IT WITH A REGULAR CHIP 
CURVY 
EXPLANATION 
TWELVE FIFTY 
WELL 
YEAH BUT DOES IT FIT WITH OUR DESIGN 
DO WE HAVE TO U ADAPT IT 
IT'S SINGLE CURVES 
WE 
COULD WE JUST MAKE THE BUBBLES UH CUT OFF THE BACK AND THEN WE'RE HE HAS 
OKAY 
MORE 
YEAH 
YOU MAKE IT OPTIONAL 
FUNCTIONAL 
UH THERE'S AN A A ATHE AESTHETIC VALUE BUT NOT FUNCTIONALITY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT IT DOESN'T FIT IN OUR CO COST PROFILE 
SO 
YOU UM CAN MAKE AN AN ESPECIALISED EXTRA GOLD VERSION 
YEAH 
YEAH JUST ONE BIG CURVE 
UH THIS UH AMERICAN FIGURES 
YOU JUST CUT DOWN SOME TREES 
WHOEVER MAKES UH A REMOTE CONTROL OUT OF TITANIUM 
YES 
NO 
WE USE 
W YEAH WE'LL START HERE ALL O ALL OVER AGAIN 
UM 
FOUR IS THERE WAS A LOT OF CREATIVITY 
WE COULD JUST SIGN UP ON UH REMOTE IF WE LOOKED 
OH 
CRAPPY 
CARE 
YEAH 
YEAH EXAMPLE OF CRAPPY LEADERSHI 
OKAY YEAH 
YOU COULD F SAID SHUT UP YOU FEEL 
YEAH MORE MORE CONSENSUS 
EV EVERYBODY W WAS AGREEING EVERY YEAH 
WELL WE WORK TOGETHER ON A PROJECT BUT EVERYBODY HAS HIS OWN TASK 
SO IT IS A LITTLE BIT 
YEAH 
NO 
WELL IT WENT OKAY 
STUPID STUPID PEN BUT UH 
YEAH BUT BUT DRAW SOMETHING UH DIFFICULT 
DO UH JUST WRITE YOUR NAME RIGHT NOW 
TRY TO WRITE YOUR NAME IN IN WRITING LETTERS OF COURSE YEAH 
YEAH NORMALLY UH THIS UH THE W BLOCK LETTER SIGN IT YEAH 
JUST JUST WRITE YOUR NAME ON ON ON LINE 
IF IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO SMALL BIT QUICKER NOW 
IT DIDN'T 
UH HE HE KNOWS HOW IT WORKS YEAH 
YOU WILL YEAH 
TH TH I 
THE IDEA IS GREAT BUT IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY 
YEAH 
NO 
SO UH SO I USED A UM A C FEW MOMENTS AGO IT I WOULD LIKE MYSELF TO WRITE WITH A NORMAL PEN BECAUSE MOST UM 
YEAH IT'S ALMOST THE SAME CONCEPT BUT YOU CAN JUST SOME MORE SIMPLY PUT IT IN OUR SCANNER 
I IT'S THE SAME CONCEPT IS THE PEN WHERE YOU OF HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE OR IS UH VERY UH SLOW 
YES 
ONE AND IT DOESN'T GIVE ANY ADDED VALUE 
YEAH NOT USER FRIENDLY 
YEAH AND IT'S IT'S NOT VERY PRECISE 
WE'RE TRYING TO ME TOO 
YEAH IT MAY UM YEAH AND TR TRY TO WRI WRITE YOUR NAME UH IN A IN A NORMAL UH SIZE YEAH 
SMALLER 
YEAH SMALLER 
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU'RE WRITING ON A LETTER 
IN A AS YOU SAW IN IN THIS DRAWING JUST OPEN OPEN THIS ONE OR THAT ONE 
IT'S UH THE T T YEAH UH WE HAD MORE PROBLEMS EVEN HERE WHEN WE TRYING TO DRAW THESE BUTTONS 
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET CLEAR UH WHEN YOU'RE UH 
AND THE ERASER WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM 
IT W IT IS IS THIS LARGE 
AND WHEN YOU TRY TO ERASE THIS LINE YOU 
I'M GONNA ERASE MY NAME THERE 
UM AB WHAT KIND OF NEW IDEAS 
YEAH UH 
NEW IDEAS ABOUT UH THE WORKING OF THIS SOFTWARE ABOUT ABOUT THE PROJECT ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE 
HELLO 
YEAH 
SO TRUE 
NOT REALLY JUST THEY HAVE TO IMPROVE IT 
UH THE CONCEPT IS OKAY BUT IT HAS TO BE QUICKER 
UH IT IS STILL OPENING MY PROGRAMME 
N ALMO ALMOST UH MY ENTIRE COMPUTER IS LOCKED UP DURING THE PROCESS AND IT YEAH JUST TAKES TOO MANY TIME 
PEOPLE WILL STILL FEEL THE NEED TO TO WRITE IT QUICKLY ON UH A PAGE AND NOT DOWNLOAD IT AND SAVE IT AND 
MORE USER FRIENDLY 
'CAUSE WHEN YOU USE A PEN YOU CAN JUST DRAW LIKE YOU D DRAW NORMALLY AND YOU DO 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT L 
WOULD BE EASIER 
OR AT LEAST WHEN YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO ADAPT TO THE TECHNOLOGY JUST YOU CAN WRITE ON THE WAY YOU NORMALLY WRITE 
AND NOW YOU HAVE TO UM KEEP CONSTANTLY IN MIND THAT YOU'RE DRAWING ON THIS SCREEN 
AND THAT'S A VERY BAD CONCEPT 
NAH OKAY I I IT'S MY OPINION THAT I 
YEAH IT'S CAN BE SAVED EASIER 
BUT IF YOU'RE IN NORMAL FLIP OVER YOU A LOT OF PEOPLE WRITE TEXT 
THERE'S NO TEXT OPTION 
AND WRITING TEXT UH YEAH YOU'VE GOTTA REALLY DO YOUR BEST TO WRITE SOME 
YEAH 
OR MAYBE EVEN INSERT PICTURE 
IF YOU HAVE UH SOME PRESENTATION AND YOU HAVE SOME OF 
YEAH 
'CAUSE THEN YOU COULD 
OH OKAY 
SO YOU CAN 
WITH UH W. W. DOT GOOGLE DOT COM 
OH YEAH 
MAYBE 
YOU'LL JUST MAKE A LINK IN 
YEAH 
THERE'S NO WAY TO UH 
MAYBE IF IF YOU'RE NOT USING THE ERASER 
SOMETHING ELSE TH YEAH ARROW 
OKAY 
WELL IT'S 
YEAH OKAY 
BUT 
IT IS YEAH 
YEAH 
AND THAT'S ME 
THAT'S MOSTLY THE CASE FROM THE OVER HERE WITH THE MANAGEMENTS YOU GOT TWO MINUTES TO MAKE YOUR CASE AND IF YOU HAVE TO DO ALL THOSE KIND 
YOU'LL RATHER USE POWERPOINT AND WORK IT IT IN ADVANCE 
AND THE THE ONE OR TWO THINGS YOU HAVE TO DRAW WHEN YOU'RE EITHER JUST AS A FLIP BOARD 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YO MANAGER 
WHEN ARE WE 
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO PRODUCE IT 
OH 
A CHAIRMAN 
YES 
IT'S A READ ONLY VERSION 
OH OKAY 
OH 
ONE TWO THREE 
YEAH 
WELL OKAY MAYBE YOU CAN ADD IT LATER THAT WE DECIDED ON THE END BECAUSE OF THE COST 
A SINGLE CURVED 
UH IT'S VERY CHEAP 
YEAH 
HE'LL DO IT ON HIS FREE TIME 
SO UH 
OF DIRECTUR OR DIRECTORS 
YEAH 
YOU CAN ASK YOUR PERSONAL 
YEAH THE END CONCLUSION 
BUT UH 
UM THE DECISION TO MAKE UM THE BUTTONS ON THE TOP AND THE MENU ON THE 
IN THE BOTTOM 
AND CLEARLY YEAH TOUCH SCREEN YOU'VE MENTIONED 
OKAY 
OKAY THIS ONE YEAH 
PARTY PARTY 
UH BEFORE YOU CHANGE ANYTHING MAYBE YOU UM SAVE IT FIRST 
YOU CAN'T YOU CAN SELECT FILE AND EXPORT AND THEN THIS J. PEG FILES 
WELL EIGHT 
AND WE HAVE UH ANOTHER BLANK ONE 
DID WE CHANGE ANYTHING 
WOW 
YEAH 
IT'S A NEW UH COMMERCIAL LOGO 
DON'T SAVE IT YOU 
OH 
WHY ARE ONLY THE FIRST FIVE SMARTBOARD FILES

THEY'LL PLEASE THE ELDER USERS AS WELL 
YES 
NOT NOT TO UH YEAH 
YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH 
OR BLUE OR 
WELL I I I THINK SO 
YEAH EXCEPT FOR THE BUTTONS IT'S IT COULD BE A STANDARD MODEL 
'KAY IT'S MY TIME NOW 
OKAY 
DURING THE 
OH 
DURING THE DESIGN UH DESIGN LIFE CYCLE WE UH 
WE MADE LOT OF REQUIREMENTS AND TREND ANALYSIS AND STUFF 
UM NOW IS THE TIME TO UH EVALUATE OUR PROTOTYPE CONCEPT TO UH 
AT THE PAST REQUIREMENTS 
SO WE ARE GOING TO EVALUATE THE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THE PAST USER REQUIREMENTS AND TRENDS ANALYSIS 
UM WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT WITH A SEVEN POINT SCALE 
OPENING A WORD DOCUMENT NOW 
OKAY 
NO UH OKAY UH I HAVE TO EXPLA EXPLAIN SOMETHING 
WE HAVE TO 
OH 
BE CONSENSIVE ABOUT ABOUT THINGS 
SO IT HAS TO BE A GROUP UH GROUP DECISION 
OKAY 
OH 
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE 
W YEAH 
THE PROTOTYPE 
YEAH 
OKAY ONE 
THE REMOTE CONTROL IS DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH AGE BELOW FORTY 
SEVEN IS FALSE 
YEAH B ONE OR 
MOST TRUE 
YEAH SO AS A O ONE IS APPROPRIATE 
OR MORE LIKE A FOUR 
THERE 
UH EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
THERE 
YEAH 
BUT ALSO FOR YEAH OKAY 
UH SECOND 
THE REMOTE CONTROL IS BEAUTIFUL 
YEAH ACCO ACCORDING TO USE IT'S ONE 
OR 
YEAH UP SO 
IF C OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO BE UH VERY POSITIVE AND UH ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT YOUR OWN PRODUCT 
THERE 
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL LOOKS FANCY 
NO 
GOOD 
FOUR 
THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS BIG CLEAR CHANNEL SWITCHING BUTTONS 
DANIEL 
UH TELETEXT BUTTONS AND VOLUME BUTTONS 
FALSE 
AND VOLUME 
TRUE 
BIG AND COLOUR 
HEY 
HEY 
HIDE 
IT'S IT'S NOT YEAH IT 
JA 
FIVE 
OKAY 
YEAH IT'S IT'S YEAH 
RED 
OKAY 
VOLUME 
THE REMOTE CONTROL IS EASY TO BE FOUND 
OH OKAY BUT 'KAY LOOK 
IF YOU PUT UH YOUR NORMAL UH REMOTE CONTROL UNDER YOUR BED OR YOU THROW THIS REMOTE CONTROL UNDER YOUR BED IS IT BETTER FINDABLE 
A L LITTLE BIT MAYBE 
FOUR 
IF 
I 
UH I I I THINK FIVE 
IT'S IT'S IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A LOT OF 
FOUR 
YES BUT FIVE IS BETWEEN FOUR AND SIX 
B. 
YEAH IT IT'S 
YEAH YEAH 
BUT BUT THE SURVEY UNDER USERS WAS THAT THEY UH REALLY LOST IT 
LIKE N NOT UH NOT USING IT BUT LOST IT IN THE HOUSE OR SOMETHING 
BUT OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH I I AGREE I AGREE 
OKAY 
EIGHT THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS FRESH FRUITY COLOURS 
YEAH YEAH NOT TOO FLASHY 
THE REMOTE CONTROL IS MADE OF SOFT MATERIAL 
THERE 
EASY TO USE 
TOP EASY TO USE 
IT'S IT'S NOT THE MOST EASY TO USE 
IT CAN BE EASIER 
JUS JUST WITH TEN BUTTONS THAT'S THE EASIEST 
YEAH BUT THE MOST UH EASY TO USE IS JUST WITH ONE BUTTON 
NO IT 
YEAH OKAY BUT EASY N NOT NOT THE MOST EASY TO SEE I THINK 
TWO 
WE ALSO HAVE TO COMPARE IT AT THE UH 
AT THE REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE MARKET NOWADAYS 
SO 
YEAH YEAH I'M UH HURRYING 
OKAY ELEVEN 
THE REMOTE CONTROL IS INNOVATIVE 
A VERY OF COURSE 
THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS M REMOVA REMOVABLE FROM MULTILUX 
THE REMOTE CONTROL I IT HAS SPEECH RECOGNITION 
FALSE 
THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS BUILT IN GAMES 
YEAH 
AND THE LAST PAREN PARENTAL ADVISORY FUNCTION 
YES I D 
SAVE US 
OKAY I WILL UH 
DO THE THE MATH 
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN 
NO 
ADVANCED CHIP

DANIEL WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HERE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH PUTTING A BATTERY IN IT BUT ALSO SELLING LIKE UH THE COVERS 
A DOCKING STATION JUST APART FROM THE FROM THE THING IS THAT YOU CAN UH PUT UH 
RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES IN IT AND JUST 
YEAH YEAH OKAY 
JUST AN IDEA

YEAH OF COURSE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HEY THOSE AR ARCS WHY ARE THREE FOUR

BUT 
NO BUT 
DOES IT HAVE A LOT OF EXTRA UH FUN FUNCTION MORE LIKE 
YEAH 
YEAH UH AESTHETIC 
I MEAN UH YOU MAKE LIKE ELEVEN AND A HALF EUROS PROFIT 
INSTEAD OF TWELVE AND A HALF 
BUT 
I DON'T KNOW OF TWELVE AND A HALF IS UH A FIXED UH FIXED PRICE 
NO WE CAN'T GO ABOVE THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
THEN IT'S OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH 
WHAT A WHAT ABOUT ALL THE UM THE ENVIRONMENT FREAKS

THIS IS IT 
OH NO WE HAVE TO DO ALL THOSE HOURS AGAIN 
GO BACK 
NO BACK 
COSTS ON UH NO REDESIGN 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY YEAH 
HMM 
I I DIDN'T THINK SO 
THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF ROOM FOR IT 
BUT THAT'S MAINLY BECAUSE UH OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS DELIVERED TO USE 
IT WAS JUST FIXED INFORMATION AND GET YOUR STUFF FROM THERE AND I COULDN'T GO ON ONE I IN THE INTERNET AND SEARCH MY OWN STUFF 
BU 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
LEADERSHIP WAS UH CRAPPY 
OKAY 
NO LEADERSHIP WAS UH

BUT YOU COULD HAVE UH STRUCTURE TO A L LITTLE BIT MORE 
SO LIKE I I WAS TALKING MOST OF THE TIME THE FIRST MEETING MEETING AND YEAH 
BUT 
BUT UM 
YEAH YOU MADE UP 
NO IT YOU DID BETTER 
YEAH 
MUCH MORE CONSTRUCTIVE 
TWO GUYS 
OKAY 
MEANS 
DIGITAL PEN I THOUGHT UH THE THE FIRST TIME I DID INDIVIDUAL WORK I SAID IT 
BUT A AND THE FIRST TWO MEETINGS I BROUGHT IT WITH UM BUT I DIDN'T USE IT AT ALL AFTER THE FIRST THE FIRST MEETING 
IT'S IT'S NOT REAL REAL USE FOR ME 
NOT REALLY NO 
YEAH LIKE WHEN YOU DO THIS 
SMALLER 
OH 
SORRY 
OKAY 
NEW IDEAS 
DO YOU

SO THAT'S FAIRLY UH FAIRLY GOOD I THINK 
UH THAT UH 
ALL THE REQUIREMENTS UH OUR OUTER ARE VERY TRUE RIGHT 
YEP 
YEAH 
MAY MAYBE THE DO YOU PROPOSED IS UH A SCREEN HERE 
AND DRAW IT AND IT'S IT'S PLACED OVER THERE 
HMM 
NO 
UH VERY BAD 
BUT 
I THINK THIS IS BETTER THAN REGULAR FLIP OVERS BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT INSERT IMAGE ISN'T AVAILABLE 
HERE 
PICTURE FROM SCANNER CLIP ART 
HYPERLINK 
HEY WHAT IF YOU DO LIKE HYPERLINK 
TYPE TYPE IT 
OR REAL REACTION DOT N. L. 
YES SO NOW IS OKAY 
OKAY 
HUH 
'KAY DOUBLE CLICK IT 
YOU'RE ERASING 
DOUBLE CLICK IT 
YEAH 
YEP 
WHAT I REALLY MISS ALSO SO UH 
IS A DO IS A TURTLE IS A DECISION UH DECISION SYSTEM LIKE UM 
WITH THE EVALUATION YOU HAVE TO 
POLLS LIKE WHAT DO YOU WANT A IN A TWO 
MAYBE A A L A LITTLE APPLICATION LIKE UH UH GIVE YOUR OWN NUMBER AND CLICK ON TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN 
YEAH J J J YEAH V VOTING APPLICATION 
JUST A LITTLE GROUP GROUP DECISION APPLICATION 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH OF COURSE 
BUT UH YOU CAN STILL DISCUSS ABOUT IT BUT BUT CLICK IT IN AN APPLICATION THAT'S A LOT EASIER TO PROCESS

FIVE MINUTES FOR FINISHING 
MANAGEMENT EXPERT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THAT 
MARKETING 
YEAH BUT YOU CAN SAVE IT U THE UNDER ANOTHER NAME 
MAYBE UM THE 
THE 
YEAH 
Y YEAH 
NO YOU HAVE TO PUT UH SWITCH CHANNELS UH AT THE TOP BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST USED FUNCTION AND TELETEXT AT THE SECOND 
OH NAY A VOLUME CHANGING SECOND 
SO SWITCH YES 
YEAH 
OKAY GO ON 
YES VERY GOOD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE ORDER 
SINGLE CURVES 
NO OKAY 
WAS UNTIL THE PLAN 
THE INITIAL PLAN 
NO IT'S IT'S NOT VERY CHEAP BUT THAT ONE BUT IT'S A DEVELOPMENT INSIDE CORPORATION 
LIKE UH WE WE DON'T HAVE TO BUY PARENTAL CONTROL 
OUR OWN PEOPLE CAN MAKE THAT I THINK 
YEAH IT IT HAS SOME COST BUT 
YEAH 
REAL REACTION 
OKAY 
STILL THE END CONCLUSION 
THAT'S ALL I THINK 
YEAH BUT BUT THE THE DECISIONS ARE PUT IN THE UH CONCLUSION I THINK 
WHY WE DECIDED TO USE A FLAT UH L. C. D. 
YEAH 
UM 
SAVE IT 
HMM 
YEAH BUT THEN YOU HAD THE SAME THING 
EXAMPLE IF CHILDREN REMOTE 
OH WAIT 
WAIT 
HMM 
THAT'S A PITY 
YOU DECLARE 
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PLACE YOUR LAPTOP EXACTLY ON THE MARKED SPOT 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO PLACE YOUR LAPTOP EXACTLY ON THE MARKED SPOT OVER HERE 
NO 
YEAH 
TRY THE POWER BUTTON 
HUH 
YEAH MY NAME IS NAME 
YEAH 
EVERYBODY'S READY 
GREAT 
WELL WELCOME TO THE KICK OFF MEETING 
I UH FORGOT TO PUT MY NAME OVER HERE IT'S UH IT'S MARTIN 
UH SO YOU ALL KNOW 
WELL THIS IS THE AGENDA FOR TODAY 
WELL THE OPENING IS WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW 
UH WE GONNA DO SOME ACQUAINTANCE ACQUAINTANCE THINGS 
UH GIVE SOME UM 
EXAMPLES OF THE TOOL TRAINING PROJECT PLAN DISCUSSION AND THE CLOSING 
WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE MINUTES 
OKAY THE PROJECT AIM IS TO DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
UH SOME OF THE OJE OBJECTIVES ARE THAT IS HAS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY 
SO NOW WE ALL KNOW WHAT ARE 
GOAL IS 
UM I UH FORGET I FORGOT THE WHOLE ACQUAINTANCE PART BUT WE WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER 
WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER'S NAMES 
JOOST GUIDO ANTEK 
OKAY 
I THINK WE UH AL ALREADY UH BEEN THROUGH THAT PART 
OKAY IT CONSISTS OF UH THREE LEVELS OF DESIGN 
UH WE BEGIN WITH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THEN WE GO TO THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THE DETAILED DESIGN 
VERY UH LEVEL OF DESIGN CONSISTS OF SOME INDIVIDUAL WORK AND WE UH CLOSE IT WITH A MEETING 
YOU ALL RECEIVED AN EMAIL WITH A EXAMPLE OF OUR EXPLANATION OF WHAT UH THE PARTICULAR LEVEL OF DESIGN UH MEANS AT THE DIFFERENT UH FUNCTIONS 
AND UH YOU P YOU PROBABLY READ THAT ALREADY SO I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THAT 
OKAY FIRST WE'RE GONNA UM UH GONNA TRY SOME DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THE TOOLS WE HAVE OVER HERE 
SO YOU GET ACQUAINTED WITH THIS UH UM UH MEETING TOOLS 
WE HAVE THE SMART BOARDS UH THE THESE THESE TWO BOARDS 
THIS IS THE PRESENTATION BOARDS WH WHICH ONE I'M USING RIGHT NOW 
YOU CAN UH UM THERE'S A DOCUMENT FOLDER CALLED UM THE SH SHARED DOCUMENT FOLDER 
YOU CAN UPLOAD YOUR UH DOCUMENTS TO THAT FOLDER AND THEN YOU CAN OPEN THEM OVER HERE SO YOU CAN DO YOUR POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS ON THIS SCREEN 
WE ALSO HAVE THE WHITE BOARD 
UH WE'RE GONNA SKIP THROUGH THE 
NO NO 
JUST IN THE ON THE SCREEN OVER THERE 
OH NO 
PROBABLY IS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE SOFTWARE IS IN THE LAPTOP 
SO SO IF IT'S MAINLY A THING FOR IN THE MEETING SO I DON'T THINK IT'S I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IMPORTANT 
THIS AN EXPLANATION OF THE SMART BOARDS 
THERE IS A TOOL BAR OVER HERE 
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE 
YOU HAVE THE THE PEN FUNCTION ERASER FUNCTION 
IT'S LIKE A VERY SIMPLE UH PAINT APPLICATION 
UH W WELL WE USE THE SAME FILE DURING UH THE WHOLE DAY 
AND UH YOU CAN MAKE NEW SHEETS BY UH BY PU PUTTIN PRESSING ON THE BLANK BUTTON 
IT WORKS LIKE THIS 
OH 
IF PEN IS SELECTED YES 
OH NO NO 
IT'S NOT 
BUT IT IS OPEN 
IT'S NOT WORKING LIKE A PEN YET 
HUH 
HUH 
IT'S DOING SOME STUFF NOW 
SO YOU CAN USE A PEN 
YOU CAN USE AN ERASER 
AND YOU CAN MAKE NEW UH OF UH NEW BLANKS 
AND YOU CAN CHANGE UH THE LINE WIDTH AND THE COLOUR OF THE PEN BY PRESSING ON FORWARD WHICH YOU YOU HAVE TO SELECT PEN FORMAT 
AND THEN SELECT CURRENT COLOUR OR LINE WIDTH 
SO IT'S QUITE EASY 
UH WELL NOW YOU'RE ALL UH ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIFFERENT TOOLS 
RIGHT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO THE ELECTRONIC WHITE BOARDS 
UH EVERY PARTICIPANT SHOULD DRAW HIS FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND SOME OF ITS FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS ON BLANK SHEETS WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS WITH DIFFERENT PEN WIDTHS 
UH I'LL START OFF THEN 
I'LL SEE THIS UH SOME SHEET 
ALRIGHT 
UH LET ME THINK 
DIFFERENT COLOURS 
OH 
WELL I'M GONNA DRAW UM A P PIRANHA 
UH A FISH 
OH 
MM-HMM 
I'M GONNA USE SOME DIFFERENT COLOUR NOW 
SOME A LITTLE WHAT 
LOOKS LIKE A FISH 
THINK IT IS 
OH 
OH 
UH COLOUR 
THIS IS BLACK 
I THINK SO 
OH 
UH THIS IS JUST UH 
USELESS UH 
DRAWINGS BUT UH TEETH 
I NEED TEETH 
WELL THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN OR WHATEVER COLOUR THIS IS 
OKAY 
WHAT WAS UH I HAVE IS TO SUM UP ITS FAVOURITE CHARACTERIS WELL I LIKE ITS UH SHARP RAZOR SHARP TEETH 
PLUS UH THE THE BIG UH FOREHEAD AND UH A SMALL UH WELL A SMALL ACTUAL FACE 
AND I LIKE ITS OVERALL UH AGGRESSIVE LOOK AND 
WELL THAT'S WHAT I LIKE BUT UH PIRANHA 
I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHAT UH THE INTENTION SHOULD BE 
WELL WHO WANTS TO BE NEXT 
YOU G GOOD 
OKAY 
UH MAKE A NEW SHEET 
UH IT'S BY PRESSING ON BLANK 
YEP 
YEP 
AND UH SO ON THE FORMAT MENU YOU CAN CHOOSE THE DIFFERENT UH COLOURS AND UH PEN WIDTHS 
WELL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT UH YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS UH PARTICULAR BIRDS 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
NO UH IT'S CLEAR 
NO NO NO 
WE GET YOUR POINT 
OKAY 
WHO WANTS TO BE NEXT 
OH 
I'LL DO IS 
OKAY 
WELL YOU CAN HAVE A PIRANHA AT HOME 
HUH 
I DON'T THINK UH I DON'T THINK UH DARWIN WOULD AGREE WITH THAT 
OKAY 
WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT THEN 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY AND THEN WE ARE UH THROUGH THE TOOL TRAINING I GUESS 
OKAY THIS IS UH SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROJECT FINANCE 
THE SELLING PRICE OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL IS GONNA BE TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
AND OUR PROFIT AIM IS FIFTEEN MILLION EUROS 
WE'RE VERY AMBITIOUS ON THIS ONE 
THE MARKET RANGE IS INTERNATIONAL SO IT'S GONNA BE SOLD WORLD WIDE AND THE PRODUCTION COST SHOULD BE A MAXIMUM OF TWELVE EURO FIFTY PER REMOTE CONTROL 
SO THAT'S CLEAR 
YEAH 
OKAY WE'RE NOW GONNA DISCUSS SOME STUFF WHEN WELL WE'RE GONNA BRAINSTORM ABOUT UH WHAT KIND OF KEMORO ROMO REMOTE CONTROL IT'S GONNA BE 
UH WILL TELL ME ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH THE REMOTE CONTROLS 
DO YOU HAVE UH KNOW WHAT GOOD EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS 
OR DO THEY ANNOY YOU SOMETIMES 
ARE THEY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND OR MAYBE THEY DON'T INTERACT WITH DIFFERENT KIND OF UH EQUIPMENT VERY WELL 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF OF UH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND UH IS IT GONNA BE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S UM WHAT IT CAN BE USED FOR DIFFERENT KIND OF EQUIPMENT LIKE YOUR T. V. AND YOUR HOME STEREO 
OH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BUT UH THE D. V. D. PLAYERS AND HOME CINEMA SETS OFTEN DOUBLE IS STEREO HI FI SETS PROBABLY 
IT'S WHAT FROM MY EXPERIENCE 
OKAY 
BUT WE GONNA 
UH TO USE ONLY FOR TELEVIS 
SO WHA WHAT 
WHAT WHA WHAT UH WHAT DOCUMENT 
BUT WHERE WHERE DID IT UH WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT 
OH OKAY 
YEAH BUT MOST TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROLS SUPPORT OTHER FUNCTIONS AS WELL 
SO WE CAN NO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT 
OKAY UH BUT UH WE'VE GONNA PUT SOME A UH IS IS IT IS USER FRIENDLINESS IS A AS A PRI PRIORITY IN THIS CASE OR 
OKAY 
WELL THIS THE MAYBE IS UH SOME ASPECT OF THE UH OR OR SOME POINT TO TO WHICH WE CAN EXCEL BY MAKING IT VERY USEFUL 
THAT WE WILL THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE THE USABILITY UH MINE IS THIS UH GONNA BE A VERY IMPORTANT TASK FOR YOU THEN 
OKAY 
WELL OTHER IDEAS 
HOW CAN WE MAKE IT TRENDY OR SOMETHING 
DO UH BY JUST SHA SHAPE AND THE LIKE IF IT 
MAYBE A CAN OPENER UNDERNEATH IT 
I DON'T KNOW 
OR SOMETH SOMETHING SPECIAL LIKE UH M. P. THREE PLAYER INSIDE OF IT OR UH UH WELL THEN THE PRODUCTION COSTS ARE GONNA BE TOO HIGH PROBABLY 
OKAY 
MAYBE WITH DIFFERENT TYPE OF FRONTS OR UH WELL UM HAS TO BE SOMETHING SPECTACULAR OR UH IN WHICH MAKES IT WE GONNA SKIP BACK TO THE GOALS PROBABLY 
OH 
ORIGINAL TRENDLY AND USER FRIENDLY WELL WE AL ALSO ALREADY TALKED ABOUT USER FRIENDLINESS 
NO WELL SOMETHING TRENDY AND ORIGINAL WELL THAT THAT GOES HAND ONE HAND I GUESS 
WHEN SOMETHING IS ORIGINAL IT TENDS TO BE TRENDY PROBABLY ARE WE SHOULD MAKE IT COMBINATION OF THAT 
'KAY SO YOU THE UM TECHNICAL PART OF THE PROCESS IS SOMETHING YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AFTER FOUR 
SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF UH EQUIPMENT YOU WANT TO UH YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO MANAGE WITH IT 
WELL AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART FOR YOU THEN WITH GOGORS REGARDS TO THE USER FRIENDLY PART OF IT 
WELL AND YOU UH SHOULD LOOK AT FOR WHAT MAKES IT TRENDY 
WELL YOU KNOW YOU LIKE SOME SPECIAL FEATURE 
OR SOME DOES IT DOES IT GETS SOME GADGETNESS OR SOMETHING 
OKAY 
WELL THE CLOSING 
NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES 
INDIVIDUAL I THINK SO 
THE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WILL WE ARE THE WORKING DESIGN OF COURSE WE WILL UH 
ALREADY S SAID THAT 
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER SO IT A USER INTER USER INTERFACE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN 
AND THE MANAGEMENT EXPERT OF UH THE MARKETING EXPERT 
USER REQUIREMENTS SPECIFI WELL THIS ONE WAS ALREADY CLEAR TO USE 
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE LEFT 
UH NOT MANY I GUESS 
WE STARTED AT TWELVE 
UH AND WHAT DOES IT SAID 
WE 
OKAY WELL UM 
NO WE'RE UH AHEAD OF SCHEDULE THEN 
YEAH CLOSE IT 
I'M GONNA MAKE SOME MINUTES OR TAKE SOME MINUTES 
AND UH IT'S IT'S CLEAR YOU CAN PUT THE STUFF ON THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS PRESENTATIONS 
YOU CAN ALL OUR WE'RE ALL UH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH UH UH MICROSOFT POWERPOINT OR WE 
YEAH OKAY 
I'M GONNA WR UH WRITE SOME STUFF DOWN AND THEN WE'RE READY 
ARE WE CAN LEAVE ALREADY I GUESS 
OR UH OR SHE OR SHOULD WE UH OR IS IMPORTANT THAT WE LEAVE IT EXACT UH 
OKAY 
YES 
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER ONE UH THIRTY MINUTES 
YEAH GOOD LUCK 
I'VE LOST MY SCREEN 
OH 
YES 
I CLOSED THE 
NO 
YES 
ANTEK

I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY FOR TELEVISION 
SO SO WE PROBABLY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE TO UH HAVE THE FUNCTIONS FOR D. V. D. PLAYER OR V. C. R. 
UH IN THE EMAIL 
I THOUGHT IT SAID UH YEAH TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL 
TRUE 
YEAH 
TRUE 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
TRUE 
OH MY GOD 
OKAY 
FOR THE BEAR 
OH 
I I UH NO I THINK IT 
UH I TH I THINK YOU WE HAVE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE TO GET A WHOLE MARKET

NOBODY I GUESS 
FORMAT 
YOU KNOW I THOUGHT OF THAT ACTUALLY 
YEAH 
ITS SIMPLICITY 
YEAH WHATEVER 
I'LL GO NEXT 
THANKS 
I HAVEN'T GOT A FAVOURITE ANIMAL TO USE 
OH 
WHAT SHOULD I DRAW 
THANK YOU I'LL DRAW A PENGUIN 
YEAH 
I'LL DRAW A PENGUIN 
WHATEVER 
I CAN'T DRAW US 
YOU CAN START TO LAUGH ALREADY 
WHATEVER 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
COME ON 
MM-HMM HMM ORANGE 
WHATEVER 
UH IT'S BETTER THAN YOUR BIRD 
EVERYTHING'S BETTER THAN YOUR BIRD 
WHATEVER 
HEY IT'S BLUE 
NO 
WHATEVER 
UM I LIKE ITS UGLINESS AND UH YEAH WHATEVER 
THE WAY IT WALKS OR WHATEVER 
YOUR TURN 
DRAWING 
OR A LINE 
I MEAN A BIRD 
HMM 
IT'S A HANDICAPPED CAT 
HE'S CRYING BECAUSE IT'S UGL BECAUSE OF HIS UGLINESS 
I WOULDN'T CALL IT TRAINING BUT 
ALRIGHT 
I DON'T TH I DON'T THINK THE FOUR OF US GOT PROBLEMS WITH REMOTE CONTROLS BUT IF YOU SEE ELDERLY PEOPLE 
ALL THESE BUTTONS AND THEN THEY BUY NEW T. V. BECAUSE THEIR PREVIOUS ONE WAS STOLEN OR WHATEVER 
AND THEN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROL WITH WITH DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND HALF OF THE FUNCTIONS A ARE REMOVED OR WHATEVER 
UH SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS IS A COLOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL WITH 
UH GROUPED BUTTONS YOU KNOW 
ALL THE ALL THE BUTTONS WHICH APPLY TO THE TEXT FUNCTIONS IN IN IN UH 
WELL ONE OR OR WHATEVER NOT LIKE THE BUTTON TO ENTER TEXT ON TOP OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE BUTTON TO ME 
YEAH IT MINIMISE IT AT THIS THIS OR WHATEVER O O OTHER FUNCTIONS TOTALLY SOMEWHERE ELSE 
I THINK WE SHOULD GROUP THEM 
AND SOME FOR THE FOR THE VOLUME BUTTONS AND THE THE IT 
WELL I WAS I WAS THINKING UH SINCE A T. V. S UH MOSTLY USED TOGETHER WITH A V. C. R. OR D. V. D. PLAYER OR RECORDER 
AND NOT WITH A STEREO I THINK IT SHOULD BE GOOD TO INCLUDE FUNCTIONS FOR V. C. R. S AND D. V. D. PLAYERS RECORDERS 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
HI FI SET IS UH NOT OFTEN USED UH SO I KNOW IF IN COMBINATION WITH TELEVISION 
YES 
YES IT IS ONLY FOR TELEVISION BUT UH 
WELL 
WELL WE WE'RE GONNA BRAINSTORM ABOUT THAT 
IF WE THINK IT'S USEFUL WE DO IT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
IT'S A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT I WAS THINKING SINCE IT IS USEFUL WITH D. V. D. 
YEP 
YEAH ALSO NO ONE'S GONNA BUY IT 
I GUESS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH WAY TOO HIGH 
YEP 
WELL THAT'S AN IDEA OF COURSE YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES WHAT THE MARKET WISHES 
YEAH 
YOU JUST GOT A MESSAGE 
AND IT SAID UH FIVE MINUTES SO WE GOT FOUR AND A HALF 
NO 
HE'S THE WHATEVER 
TEAM LEADER 
UH IS THE WHATEVER 
YES 
PROJECT JOC PROJECT DOCUMENTS IS FOR SHOWING UH IN THE WHITE BOARD 
YEAH 
YES 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
NO 
I DON'T THINK SO 
YES 
GREAT 
YEAH 
GOOD LUCK 
I WILL NEED TO 
OKAY 
EVERYBODY READY 
WELCOME TO THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING AGAIN PRESENTED BY MAARTEN 
UH THIS IS THE AGENDA THE OPENING 
OH WE'VE GOT THREE PRESENTATIONS 
AND I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOME OF THE NEW PROJECTS REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE SENT TO ME 
AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS 
WE HAVE UH FORTY MINUTES 
UH WELL THIS IS THE THE CLOSING ALREADY 
SO UH WELL WE START OFF WITH THE THE THE FIRST PRESENTATION THEN 
UH I THINK UM IN UH WE HAVE TO DO IT IN UH ONE RIGHT ORDER 
MAYBE THE 
WELL IT 
UH THAT 
IT WON'T DOESN'T MAYBE WE SHOULD START WITH THE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
YEAH 
WELL IT'S YOU DUMPED THE FILE IN THE UH IN THE SH IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENT FOLDER 
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THAT 
WELL LET'S CLOSE THIS ONE 
WE'LL JUST UH OPEN A NEW ONE 
UH WELL 
YES 
UH UH 
NEW THING 
OH YEAH UH I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING 
UH DO IT SOME UH TECHNICAL PROBLEMS I HAVEN'T UH DIGITIZED THE LAST UH THE MEETING MINUTES 
BUT I'LL UH MAKE SURE THAT UH HAPPENS NEXT TIME 
AND I'LL GET THIS ONE UH IN DIGITAL UH FROM IT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
BUT IT'S THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
OH 
OKAY 
WELL WE'LL WE'LL HAVE TO SKIP THAT PART THEN 
BUT YOU DON'T THINK IT'S A PROBLEM UM TO DESIGN UH THE TECHNICAL PART OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S GONNA BE EASY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
R REGARDLESS OF WHAT TYPE OF FUNCTIONS WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT 
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL WE'LL SEE 
WE'LL SEE LATER ON 
NO 
WELL UH WELL THERE BE SOME UH USER REQUIREMENTS LATER ON 
THE ONES I I'VE UH RECEIVED FROM THE ACCOUNT MANAGER 
YEAH 
WELL WE'LL KEEP THIS IN MIND AND THEN DISCUSS IT LATER ON 
UH-HUH 
OKAY BUT THIS REAL THIS UH BIG D UH DISTINCTION BETWEEN THIS TYPE OF REMOTE 
WE SHOULD WE SHOULD CHOOSE ONE UH WE SHOULD NOT COMPROMISE BUT UH REALLY CHOOSE FOR UH EXPERT VIEWER OR NOVICE V YEAH 
WELL WHAT THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TRYING TO SAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH WELL SOME OF THIS UH YEAH 
WELL SOME OF THAT WELL YEAH BUT I BUT IT WILL BE MORE CLEAR WHEN WE COME TO THE UH U UH SOME OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS 
SO 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
WELL THEN THE MARKETING EXPERT CAN UH TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THE CURRENT MARKET 
OKAY 
VISUALLY PRESENTS 
OKAY 
WELL THEN WE I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOME OF THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS AND THEN WE GONNA DISCUSS ON UH WHAT FEATURES WE FIND IMPORTANT 
UH WELL SOME OF THE UH NEW REQUIREMENTS MAKE SOME OF YOUR FINDINGS QUITE UH IRRELEVANT I THINK 
BECAUSE UM 
UH S DECIDED TO PUT THEY HAVE DECIDE TO PUT TWO ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FORWARD 
WELL NOW I AS FAR 
THAT'S KINDA STRANGE 
WELL THEY SAY TELE TELETEXT BECOMES OUTDATED SINCE THE POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET 
WELL I THINK THAT MAY BE SO BUT WELL WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE THE TELETEXT BUTTON OFF 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I THINK 
SO THE COMPROMISE WE COULD MAKE IS JUST TO MAKE ONE TELETEXT BUTTON YOU KNOW LIKE ONE AND OFF 
AND DON'T MAKE A LOT OF SPECIAL PUT A LOT OF SPECIAL FEATURES ON IT TO MAKE IT TRANSPARENT OR YOU KNOW 
IT'S JUST YOU WANT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF TELETEXT BUT NOT TO PLAY WITH IT THAT MUCH 
SO WE HAVE TO THINK OF THAT 
THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TELEVISION 
OTHERWISE THE PROJECT BECOMES MORE COMPLEX WHICH ENDANGERS THE TIME TO TO UM UH THE TIME TO MARKET 
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE ALL D. V. D. AND V. C. R. RELATED FEATURES OFF COMPLETELY 
I DON'T KNOW 
I THINK THAT UH 
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY 
UH OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS ARE WITHIN THE AGE GROUP OF FORTY PLUS 
NEW PRODUCTS SHOULD REACH A NEW MARKET WITH CUSTOMERS THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN FORTY 
SO YOU UH TALKED ABOUT THE ELDERLY WHO WERE WILLING TO SPEND MORE IN A REMOTE CONTROL AND WHO WERE INTERESTED 
BUT WELL THEY'RE NOT RELEVANT BECAUSE WE ARE AIMING AT A YOUNGER 
YEAH BUT IT SO IT'S IS A DIF IT'S A FACT THAT TH TH TH THAT BIGGER MARKET YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WE ALREADY COVER THAT 
OUR COMPANY ALREADY SELLS REMOTE CONTROL TO THE OLDER PEOPLE BUT WE WE ALSO WANT YOU KNOW A NEW CUSTOMER GROUP 
THAT'S THE ONE WE HAVEN'T COVERED YET 
SO I THINK THAT'S 
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS 
WE HAVEN'T GOT REMOTE CONTROLS FOR UH WELL I THINK YEAH 
YEAH I THINK SO 
MAYBE IF IT'S NO NO BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO JUST KEEP IN MIND WHAT THE OLDER AGE GROUP WANTS 
SO MAYBE WE CAN 
MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S PRIMARILY INTERESTING FOR THE YOUNGER GROUP BUT ISN'T THAT BAD FOR AN OLDER PERSON THREE 
UH OUR CORPORATE IMAGE SH SHOULD STAY RECOGNISABLE IN OUR PRODUCTS 
OUR PRODUCT'S CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEW DESIGN 
OKAY SOMETHING ELSE NICE TO KNOW 
SORRY 
YEAH YOU WILL HAVE TO LIKE THAT UP 
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE UH OKAY 
I THOUGHT IT WE MIGHT BE LET'S MAKE THINGS BETTER OR SOMETHING ABOUT 
OKAY WELL LET'S GO BACK TO THE 
THE AGENDA 
SO WE'VE NOW HAD TO THE THREE PRESENTATIONS 
WE KNOW ABOUT THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 
THAT MEANS WE CAN UH WELL D YEAH DISCUSS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS 
WELL IF I CAN UH MAKE A START I THINK IT'S BECOMING MORE CLEAR WHAT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL IT'S GONNA BE 
AND I ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE MAYBE YOU HAVE A F FAMILIAR WITH THE REM REMOTE CONTROL THAT HAS THE THE CAN OPENER UNDERNEATH IT 
I THINK WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME YEAH WE WE'RE LOOKING FOR A REALLY SIMPLE REMOTE CONTROL WITH ONLY BASIC T. V. FUNCTIONS 
YOU WILL THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
UM YEAH THAT'S WHY UM WELL A LOT OF UM THE USE THE REQUIREMENTS THE THE ACCOUNT MANAGER SENT ME 
I THINK THEY ARE ARE C ARE CONTRADICTING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY WANT A SIMPLER DESIGN 
AND ONE UH THERE UH S FUNCTIONS THEN JUST T. V. BUT THEY USE D UM IT A YOUNGER WELL UM 
BUT I THINK UH YOU WE CAN MAKE SOME DISCUSS UH DISTINCTIONS IN UH WHAT KEEN ON THE KNOW THE THE ONE FUNCTIONS YOU HAVE 
WELL YOU HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF UH EQUIPMENT IN YOUR ROOM LIKE A T T. V. AND A D. V. D. PLAYER 
YOU CAN UH KNOW 
YOU YOU CAN MAKE VERY DO YOU CAN PUT VERY DETAILED FUNCTIONS REGARDING THE T. V. SET ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL UH WITH THE WITH UH THE 
YOU KNOW AUDIO SETTINGS AND UH V UH SCREEN SETTINGS 
WE DON'T WANT THAT 
I THINK THAT WAS THAT BECAME CLEAR 
WE DON'T WANT 
BUT WE MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT SOME FUNC UH I KNOW THAT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE A D. V. D. PLAYER THEY WANT IT 
YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO UH 
CONTROL REMOTELY 
NO YEAH THE THE THE USER REQUIREMENTS OF THE THE THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS TOLD US INTO IT BUT MAYBE WE YEAH 
I THINK WE MAYBE SHOULD 
YEAH WELL WE SHOULD UH PUT SOME FUNCTIONS FOR OTHER MAYBE FOR OTHER EQUIPMENT IN IT 
BUT JUST THE BASIC FUNCTIONS 
MAYBE LIKE REWIND AND WIND OR ON WHAT DO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK 
YEAH OF AS FAR AS POSSIBLE 
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK 
DO THE SHOULD WE IMPLEMENT FEATURES THAT UH UH OUR FUNCTIONS THAT TO CONTROL OTHER DEVICES 
NO YOU DON'T THINK SO 
YEAH THE NEW REQUIREMENTS SAY SO 
WELL 
MAYBE IT'S MAYBE THERE THERE THERE IS SOMETHING THE M MOST OF THE TIME THESE FUNCTIONS DON'T SUPPORT THE PARTICULAR DEVICE AS WELL AS THEIR THEIR OWN REMOTE CONTROL 
YOU KNOW A LOT OF D. V. D. PLAYERS HAVE SOME TRICKY SETTINGS WITH 
YEP EXACTLY 
THAT'S THAT'S WHA 
NO NO YOU DON'T NO NO YOU DON'T NEED TO 
NO NO 
OKAY BUT WE HAVE TO THINK UH WE WE HAVE TO THINK D. V. D. I TH UH I GUESS 
SO UM BUT UH FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT'S KINDA A LOT OF D. V. D. PLAYERS YOU KNOW LIKE FORWARDING GOES DIFFERENTLY 
UH YOU GOT TWO SPEED OR EIGHT SPEED OR SIXTEEN SPEED 
IT'S C SOMETIMES A BIT DIFFICULT 
MAYBE IF WE JUST LEAVE THE D. V. D. FUNCTIONAL UM UH WELL I WAS THINKING ABOUT PUTTING IT IN 
BUT CONCERNING THE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT YOU JUST SAID I THINK WE UM SHOULD FOCUS ON THE T. V. THEN 
AND UH AND IT'S JUST AN UH A COMPLIMENTARY REMOTE AND NOT A UNIVERSAL ONE 
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE YOU CAN MAKE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE 
OKAY 
IT'S JUST A IS IT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS LIKE A GADGET ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE 
AND IT'S JUST FOR WHEN YOU YOU YOU JUMP IN THE COUCH 
YOU PICK UP THE THE THE NICE REMOTE THE SIMPLE ONE JUST TO PUT IN THE TELEVISION NOTHING MORE 
OKAY 
UM BUT WHAT TELEVIS 
YEAH WE WE'LL MAKE W THIS ONE TRENDY 
AND SIMPLE 
WELL WE WE WILL COME TO THAT BUT JU FIRST ON THE ON THE FUNCTIONS 
SO WE SHOULD PUT UH ZAP BUTTONS ON IT 
UM ALSO NUMBERS TO UH TO GO TO THE SPECIFIC CHANNELS 
OH 
OKAY A IT A TELETEXT BUTTON SHOULD BE THERE 
BUT JUST ONE BIG TELETEXT BUTTON ON AND OFF 
PROBABLY 
OH OKAY 
YEAH BUT UH I THINK THAT BECOMES TOO DIFFICULT IT'S NOT A VERY COMMON FUNCTION AND PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO READ UP ON THEIR REMOTE THEN 
YEAH YEAH BUT MAYBE YOU S YEAH YEAH MAYBE YOU YOU DO BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT IN THE FIRST PLACE 
AND 
WE HAVE TO WELL IT YEAH AND IT AND TELETEXT IS BECOMING OUTDATED 
WE JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT PROGRAMMES ARE ON AND WHAT TIME IT IS PROBABLY 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
I THINK THAT THAT'S KIN GETTING TOO COMPLEX FOR OUR REMOTE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THE GUYS THINK 
YEAH BUT DO YOU LIKE TO HAVE A SUCH A S STOP BUTTON 
OR DO YOU THINK IT UH 
I THINK IT'S A KIND OF UH UH VERY RARE AND SPECIAL FUNCTION 
YEAH 
OKAY IT GOES YEAH BUT THAT'S KIND OF STUFF WE SHOULD DO IN THE INTERNET RIGHT NOW 
THAT'S WHY IT WAS UH USED IN THE ON THE S IN THE OUR NEW REQUIREMENTS 
WELL YEAH UH LOTS OF NEW TELEVISIONS CAN STORE PAGES YOU KNOW 
AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SKIP MANUALLY THROUGH THEM USING I THINK WE SHOULD JUST PUT IN TELETEXT BUTTON ON IT 
THEN WE MEET UH THE NEW REQUIREMENTS 
WE ALSO MEET THE OTHER THAN YOU YOU SHOU YOU JUST ARE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FOR THE THE SIMPLE DESIGN I GUESS 
OKAY 
UM WELL WHAT FUNCTIONS DO WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON 
OR DO WE UH I DUNNO IF WE HAVE T STIF SPECIFICALLY NAME ALL THE FUNCTIONS WE N WE WANT 
WE HAVE THE ZAP AND UH THE VOLUME 
SHOULD WE DO M MAKE THEM VERY BIG 
THE THE THE ZAP BUTTON 
D D 
TH THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S CONSIDERED TO BE TRENDY ALSO 
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD PLACE THEM IN A UH IN A SPECIAL WAY 
YEAH SOMETHING OR UH SOMETHIN SPECIAL WAY TO TO ZAP THROUGH THE IT HAS TO USE IT HAS TO BE YEAH AND QUICK 
YOU HAVE TO USE IT VERY QUICKLY 
YEAH AND AT THE BUTTONS SHOULD MAKE IT UM POSSIBLE TO TO ZAP THROUGH YOUR CHANNELS IN A RAPID AT A RAPID PACE 
UH WHAT SHOULD WE DECIDE ON THEN 
I THINK IN A IN A CASE OF THIS SIMPLE REMOTE CONTROL 
THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS WHICH UH WEREN'T WORKED OUT ALREADY BUT IT WE SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM THEN 
YEP 
NO OKAY BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO UH WHEN WE DON'T WANT TO UH CONTROL OTHER DEVICES I THINK IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE SIMPLE 
I THINK 
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD USE UH D YEAH 
NOT NOT UH THE B THE WATCH KIND TH THE MOST UH WELL IT HAS TO BE SIMPLE AND I W 
WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE FOUND SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE YOU KNOW 
OH 
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE UH WE HAVE LEFT UH 
UM M M MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES 
UH TEN TWENTY MINUTES 
WELL UH THIS THIS SHOULDN'T 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
BUT THAT'S THAT'S 
DO YOU UH HAVE YOU HAVE YOU THINK ABOUT THE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT 
HOW WE CAN WHAT THE EXTRA TOUCH CAN BE 
DO YOU SUGGEST DESIGN OR THE SHAPE OR SOME GADGET F F KIND OF FEATURE OR WELL IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HOW WE LOSE THEM 
MAYBE IT SHOULD BE A REMOTE CONTROL WHEN YOU YOU CLAP YOU HANDS IT MAKES SOME NOISE OR SOME GADGET KIND OF THING 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
NAH UM A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE SUCH KIND KIND OF KIND OF GAY KIND OF THINGS 
IT W IT WE SHOULD BE LIKE A BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR SOMETHING THAT YOU GIVE SOMEONE AND IT SO I HAS SOMETHING NICE 
OR MAYBE IT WE SHOULD HAVE A BIG UH LIGHT THAT CAN FLASH OR SOMETHING ON IT 
OR MAYBE IT SHOULD OR ONE OR THE LIKE THE THE CAN OPENER 
MAYBE IT CONTAINS SOME AFTER THAT YOU DON'T NORMALLY LINK TO A REMOTE CONTROL 
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPOR BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA MAKE SUCH A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE IT SPECIAL 
IT'S GONNA COST TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
YEAH BUT THE WELL IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE 
NAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
BUT AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE UH VERY UH IT HAS TO BE STURDY OR SOMETHING 
SO MAYBE WITH WITH BOUNCING PADS SO THAT YOU CAN JUST THROW IT IN THE FLOOR OR SOMETHING 
IT HAS TO BE USED SOMETHING SPECIAL AND YOU REALLY IT HAS TO 
YOU KNOW YOU NOT SO PEOPLE WHEN THEY BUY IT THEY HAVE TO THINK WELL THIS ONE LASTS FOR A LONG TIME 
WE'RE REALLY GONNA USE THEM 
NOT SAME THING YOU YOU THROW AWAY NEXT WEEK YOU KNOW 
SO MAYBE UH THAT'S I I THINK THAT'S WHEN UH WHEN WE DECIDE ON THIS TYPE OF FUNCTIONS 
KNOW BASIC FUNCTIONS UH IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO FIND SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
SO THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT TASK FOR YOU 
AND MAYBE WE CAN ALL THINK ABOUT IT 
UH ALSO FOR YOU MAYBE WHEN IT YOU IT'S VERY NICE WHEN YOU CAN BE ENTRA WHEN YOU CAN BE TRENDY 
AND AND UH AND L AS IN A FRIEND USE FRIENDLY AS WELL YOU KNOW 
SO BIG BUTTONS FLASHY DESIGN AND MAYBE SOME KIND OF GADGET KIND OF THING 
UH-HUH 
YEAH OR JUST DIFFERENT COLOURS WOULD BE UH I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE ALSO WANNA SPEND MORE MONEY ON FRONTS FOR THEIR UH REMOTE CONTROL 
IT COULD BE B YEAH YOU NEVER KNOW BUT 
BUT IT AND I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE IT QUITE BIG 
YEAH PEOPLE 
SO AND AND ALSO BECAUSE UH IT IS EXPENSIVE 
IF YOU WANT TO TO BE SOMETHING YOU KNOW IT'S UH DOESN'T HAVE MUCH FUNCTIONS WANT TO BE YOU DON'T WANT TO GET TO L MAKE IT 
MM-HMM 
AND SHE AND SHOULD NI LOOK NICE WHEN YOU PUT IT IN A TABLE 
I I THINK YOU M MIGHT WANNA PUT IT UH YEAH THAT IT IT IT IT STANDS UP 
YEAH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN ITS SO IT'S LIKE A VASE OR UH SOMETHING YOU PUT IN A TABLE 
NO NO PUT STUFF INSIDE IT 
BUT IT'S LIKE LIKE A STATUE OR SOMETHING 
YEAH YEAH BUT YEAH BUT YOU ALSO CAN PUT IT SOMEWHERE NEAR THE WINDOW IN 
THAT IT'S IT'S FASHIONABLE 
I I DON'T 
OH YEAH 
YEAH BUT BUT WHEN YOU WHEN IT GETS LOST HOW CAN YOU PRESS THE BUTTON TO MAKE IT 
OH OKAY 
OH THAT'S KIND OF NICE 
AND THEN ALSO YOU DON'T EVEN NEED BATTERIES BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE IT UH CHARGEABLE 
YEAH THAT WE YEAH BUT YEAH THE PRO NO WELL I THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE IT UP WELL NO BUT WE DON'T YEAH 
MAYBE YOU BUT WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT PRODUCTION COST 
BUT WHEN YOU YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT WHEN YOU SPEND TWENTY FIVE EUROS ON A REMOTE CONTROL AND IT'S A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL 
THEN THE THEN THE MONEY THERE MUST BE MONEY TO SPEND ON THAT KIND OF SET YOU KNOW RECHARGEABLE UNITS 
YEAH BUT WE WOULD DO UM WE'D DO IT IN TAIWAN AND SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT EXPEN 
UH I I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA 
SO SOME KIND OF B I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE AND YOU MAKE IT UH UM BE UH YOU USE IT WITH UH THE UM THE MOUSES NOWADAYS 
WELL I WELL IT'S REALLY CH YOU CAN RECHARGE IT AS YOU HA NEVER HAVE THE BATTERY PROBLEM 
THAT'S ONE 
AND UH YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND YOUR REMOTE CONTROL UP 
OH OKAY 
WELL MAYBE YEAH YOU COULD WHEN THAT'S WHEN IT'S TOO COSTLY YOU COULD PROBABLY SKIP THE RECHARGER 
BUT YOU WILL YOU DO AND UH ALSO IN UH ALSO YOU WOULD NEED A BATTERY IN THE THE BASE UNIT AS WELL YOU KNOW 
DOES IT MAKES IT KINDA 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THEN IT'S VERY EASY TO MAKE IT ALSO A RECHARGEAB I DON'T THINK THAT IS GONNA COST MUCH TO MAKE IT ALSO A RECHARGE FUNCTION ON IT 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
AND MAKE IT YOU KNOW W W UM 
WELL WE UH IT'S IT ISN'T A IT A MOST UH COSTLY UH REMOTE CONTROL 
WE CAN SAVE ON THE ON THE FUNCTIONS 
WE JUST PUT SOME SIMPLE BUTTON ON MAKE IT BIG AND STURDY NOTHING MORE AND JUST MAKE SO SURE THERE'S SOME ONES THAT IT CAN MAKE 
ARE PROBABLY SOME KIND OF CHEAP LIGHT THING AROUND IT OR THAT IT UH THAT IT LIGHTS UP IT'S ALSO NICE 
AND IF YOU PUT IT AWAY I THINK IT'S UH WE WE HAVE TO WE UH THAT'S UH IT'S NOT A EASY MARKET 
WE HAVE TO SOMETHING SPECIAL 
AND FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING REMOTE C SPECIAL FROM YOUR MOTE CONTROL 
AND WE CAN'T DELIVER THAT ONE OR WITH UH REGARDS TO THE FUNCTIONS BECAUSE WE AREN'T GONNA PUT 
YEAH 
AND THEN UH WHEN MAKE IT YOU KNOW NICE LOOKING SHAPE AND THIS AND THEN YOU ALSO YOU GET THE STAND UP THING 
YEAH 
I THINK I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
UH IF IT LET'S WELL WE WILL SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE THE COSTS AND IF IT'S POSSIBLE WE'LL DO THAT 
AND WE EVEN TRY TO SAVE UP ON THEIR STUFF TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO SUCH A THING 
AND THE FIRST THING WE THE MOST LIKEABLE THING TO IT ON TO SKIP IS THEN PROBABLY THE RECHARGE FUNCTION OR SOMETHING 
IF THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE WE WON'T DO THAT 
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE 
IT'S THE IDEA 
I KNOW THAT BATTERIES LAST LONG NOWADAYS 
AND AND WHAT PEOPLE JUST THINK ABOUT WELL I'LL NEVER HAVE TO BUY ANY R BATTERIES AGAIN 
SO YOU B BECAUSE IT'S VERY ANNOYING WHEN YOUR BATTERY IS EMPTY 
AND YOU KNOW THEN WHEN YOU HAVEN'T BATTERIES AROUND AND PROBABLY FOR TWO WEEKS YOUR REMO I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT THAT 
YEAH OKAY 
SO EASY FUNCTIONS 
WELL WE WILL W WELL I THINK WE'LL WORK THAT OUT ZAPPING NUMBERS ON TO BE 
YEAH 
BUT IT'S ALSO ANNOYING 
'CAUSE AS LONG AS IT STAYS AS IT KE KEEPS WORKING YOU'RE NOT VERY MOTIVATED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
THEN IT BEEPS ALL THE TIME AND 
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE EVER HAVE THESE PROBLEMS AND YOU WON'T HAVE IF IF YOU HAVE THE RECHARGEABLE 
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THE UNIT YOU CAN ALSO PUT IT IN THE SIDE OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT 
UH I I IN THE ON THE UM YEAH BUT IT W I MEAN 
IF IF THEY PAY FOR IT BECAUSE THEY THINK UH THAT'S A GREAT IDEA I'M GONNA USE IT 
AND WHEN IT YOU KNOW WHEN TIME GOES BY AND THEY THINK WELL I'LL NEVER PUT HIM IN THE RECHARGER 
I THINK LAST LONG ENOUGH THEN THEY PUT IT ONE SIDE AND THEY CAN USE IT NOW AND THEN 
THEN WHEN THEY LIKE GET UM I I I KNOW FOR SURE THAT EVERYBODY WHO BUYS THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS IF THEY WILL BE IN THE SITUATION THAT THEY THEY'RE SEEKING FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
THEY WANNA SEE SOMETHING QUICK AND UH JUST PUSH THE BUTTON AND THE UH I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT 
YEAH I'VE NEVER IT'S SO SIMPLE BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT 
UM MAYBE WE SHOULD REALLY DO THIS 
OKAY NOW WELL HOW MUCH TIME HAVE WE GOT LEFT 
THESE CLOCKS AREN'T UH SYNCHED 
UH NOW I'VE PUT UH WELL IT IS TWENTY P OKAY SO WE HAVE TEN MINUTES OR SOMETHING 
YEAH BUT WE'RE UH WE'RE DONE 
I THINK 
WE'VE DECIDED ON THE FUNCTIONS 
WELL THERE IS SOME UH 
THERE IS A CLOSING SHEET 
WE HAVE LUNCH BREAK AND THEN WE HAVE THIRTY MINUTES OF INDIVIDUAL WORK 
OH OKAY I'LL MAKE SURE I'LL I HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH UH THE DIGITISING THE THE FIRST MINUTES 
THE THE USE THE NEXT MINUTES WON'T BE A PROBLEM 
BUT I'LL TRY TO MAKE SURE THE FIRST ONE WILL BE IN THE FOLDER TOO BUT MAYBE IT WON'T WORK BUT YOU'LL SEE 
I THINK THESE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE FIRST ONES SO 
OH FIVE MINUTES 
YEAH BECAUSE UH I I D I DID UH THE FIRST MINUTES I DID WERE WERE WERE A BIT SCRATCHY YOU KNOW 
THEN I DID A S SECOND ONE WITH A NICER LAYOUT WHICH I COULD UH KNOW 
SO FOR THE OTHER ONES WELL BUT UH I DO THINK UH I FORGOT TO DO PUT DONE UNDER THE FIRST ONE 
AND WHEN YOU GO WRITE A SECOND UH IT'S GOT IT'S NOT WORKING WHEN YOU TRY TO WRITE SECOND UH PAPER OR SOMETHING 
AND THEN YOU YOU HAD TO OVERWRITE IT OR SOMETH I DON'T KNOW 
BECAU I D UH IT WAS NOT MY UH PEN 
THIS KIND OF LOOKS YOU LOOK 
OF THE SHAPE 
YEAH PROBABLY IT WOULD BE NICE 
NO BIGGER 
WELL I I I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE THIS UH CAN OPENING REMOTE CONTROL IN MY HEAD MOST OF ALL 
OR I THINK SOME MAYBE WE SHOULD IN THAT WILL BE TOO COSTLY 
WE SH WE COULD ALSO THAT WAS A WOULD ALSO BE AN IDEA BUT I DON'T THINK IT I DON'T KNOW IF IT EXISTS ALREADY 
YOU SHOULD LIKE MAKE ALESSI OR SOMETHING DESIGN IT 
THAT WOULD ALSO BE NICE 
BUT THAT'S GONNA THEN YOU C THEN YOU DON'T 
YEAH BUT THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO YEAH IT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I THAT'S IN THE PRODUCTION COST A ONE IT'S A ONE TIME 
YOU KNOW IS WAS IT'S A SINGLE COST 
YEAH UM BUT BUT THEN YOU CAN NAH I DON'T THIN I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE 
BECAUSE I'VE BOUGHT THE ALESSI STUFF MORE OFTEN AND EVEN SMALL PENCIL HOLDERS OR SOMETHING OR MORE EXPENSIVE 
WOULD BE A NICE IDEA THOUGH 
I DON'T KNOW 
I THINK IT UH HAS TO BE A R IT HAS TO HAVE ROUND FORMS OR SOMETHING 
LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT ARE S OR SO 
AND IN THE AND THEN UH AS A BASE UNIT UNDERNEATH IT 
IT'S ALSO AROUND 
PUT IT IN THEIR UH WERE IN IT 
MAYBE UH I DON'T KNOW SOME SOME LIGHTS A BIG BUT WELL 
VOLUME AND PROGRAMME YEAH 
AND SOME OF THE EXTRA FUNCT 
SOME OF THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS OVER HERE 
NUMBERS 
AND AND LIGHTS 
HOW WE'RE G WELL MAYBE UH AS A RANGE OF NO NO YOU HAVE TO MAYBE IN THE SIDE OF IT 
ALONG THE SIDE UH STRIP OF YEAH 
YEAH BUT I ALSO MEANT THE THE BLINKING LI W YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT ALSO BLINK WHEN YOU TRY TO UH UH LOCATE YOUR REMOTE 
WELL THEYS HAVE TO BE 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
EXACTLY 
WHEN YOU YOU USE IT FROM THE SIDE THEN IT WOULD LIKE JUST LIKE THAT 
AND THEN YOU HAVE 
A STRIP OF UH LIGHTS OR SOMETHING 
WELL UH I THINK IT'S NICE FOR ONE THING 
MAYBE PUT SOMETHING ON TOP OF IT OR YOU KNOW LIKE THAT'S LOOKS FUNNY 
I DON'T KNOW 
OR SOME BUMP 
MAYBE SOME YEAH 
WE'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT 
I THINK WE'RE WE'RE DONE 
WE CAN SAVE THIS ONE 
MM MM 
YEAH THAT WAS WHAT UH 
MM WE'LL HEAR ABOUT IT 
MY MOUSE IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE 
HE'S UH WHEN I PUT IT ONE IS IS GOING TO BEEP BEEP BEEP 
HUH 
OKAY HOW CAN I GOT THIS IN THE WHITEBOARD 
OKAY I'VE DONE THAT 
YES 
'KAY WE'RE GOING TO ME 
UH TALK ABOUT WORKING DESIGN 
UM THE METHOD OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS UH ELECTRICAL ENERGY IT ACTIVATES A CHIP UH IN THE REMOTE 
IT'S AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT 
WHICH COMPOSE UH MESSAGES IN THE FORM OF UH UH INFRARED SIGNALS TO CONTROL THE TELEVISION 
MM IT'S A NOWADAYS VERY UH KNOWN A KNOWN UH UH TECHNOLOGY 
UM THE KNOWN TECHNOLOGY CAN MAKE A COST VERY LOW 
UH IT'S A WILD UH A WIDE SALE UH OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE WORLD 
AND AND THE COMPONENTS ARE VERY UH VERY CHEAP 
UM 
UH DIODES UH BAT BATTERIES AND UH UH LED LIGHTS THEY'RE NEEDED AND THEY'RE UH EVERYWHERE AVAILABLE 
UH AGAIN IT'S A FAIR PRICE 
IT'S A COMMON UH TECHNOLOGY UH LIKE I TOLD ME UH THE CIRCUIT BOARD IT'S THE MOST UM IMPORTANT UH 
UM PART OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UH WE CAN USE FOR THAT UH FIBREGLASS WITH COPPER WIRES IT'S IT IS UH 
CAN BE MADE AS FAST AS PRINTING PAPER 
IT'S UH IT'S ALL VERY UH 
YEAH THEY'RE MAKING IT UH ALL THE TIME 
OH 
AND IT'S NOT UH VERY SPECIALISED UH TECHNOLOGY 
I HAVEN'T COME TO HEAR ABOUT 
UM I'VE GOT UH SOME UH IMAGES OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS 
THEY WERE NOT UH VERY UH TRENDY OR JUST UH 
JUST A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE EVERYONE KNOWS 
SO I DON'T KNOW UH WHY I SHOULD PUT IT HERE 
OH 
YES BUT UH I UH HAVEN'T MADE IT BECAUSE UH OF THE TIME 
BUT 
WHAT 
NO 
YES 
UM NO IT'S UH IT'S JUST A PART OF UH A KNOWN TECHNOLOGY YEAH 
REMOTE CONTROL IS NOTHING SPECIAL NOWADAYS 
UM 
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE OF THE ALL THE TELEVISIONS UH THERE ARE A FEW MAYBE A COUPLE OF TELEVISIONS WITH THE NEW FUNCTIONS 
BUT IS IT USEFUL TO PUT THEM IN A IN A STANDARD UH REMOTE 
NO 
BUT YOU CAN PUT THEM UNDER THE SAME BUTTON 
BUT YOU CAN PUT A PLAY AND STOP AND AND REWIND 
YES BUT WE 
HUH 
YES BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE 
BUT HOW WE HOW WELL YOU BE ABLE TO HANDLE A WHOLE MARKET 
THERE ARE UH A DOZEN OF UH DOZENS OF OF REMOTE CONTROLS THAT HAVE 
YES BUT YOU COULD PUT 
IN THE Z ON THE ZAP BUTTONS YOU CAN PUT IT TO UH TO UH ACCESS ALL THE SAME PAGES 
IF YOU HAVE SEVEN PAGES YOU CAN GO UP AND DOWN 
YES 
YES 
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE UH A KIND OF A JOYSTICK 
BUT 
NO IT'S O JUST SIGNALS UH AND THE TELEVISION D UH DOES THE REST 
NO 
THE MOST STANDARD BATTERIES 
BUT I IN A WAY WE HAVE TO BE UH UH SPECIAL 
MAYBE THE UM 
FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT'S IT BE UH A FORMED FOR YOUR HAND 
MORE LIKE A JOYSTICK THEN 
BUT THAT'S THAT'S FINE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THEN THE SECOND 
OR YOU CAN 
YEAH 
WITH RECHARGER 
YES BUT IS THAT HANDY 
BUT BUT REMOTE CONTROLS REMOTE CONTROLS NOWADAYS CAN CAN LAST UH TWO YEARS THREE YEARS WITH WITH IT TWO BATTERIES 
AND THEN YOU 
YES 
OR 
BUT YOU PAY FOR IT 
MAYBE LIKE THIS PEN 
IT HAS TO FEEL NICE IN YOUR HAND 
HERE WE GO AGAIN 
OH 
OKAY 
MM OKAY 
YEAH IT'S OKAY 
OKAY 
NO 
NO PROJECT 
NO CAN THAT PEN 
OPEN IT THERE 
OKAY 
BUT THE GET 
OKAY 
BUT NOTHING RESTRICTED FOR USER INTERFACE 
WITH TECHNICAL 
I DON'T KNOW 
'KAY 
OKAY 
BUT I KIND OF UH 
YES 
OH 
WELL THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
UM WELL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET THE SAME UH PICTURES AS I GOT ABOUT UH I GOT THESE TWO 
AND I THINK THEY'RE WE HAVE TO FOCUS UH IN UH THE UH ONE HAND THE EXPERT VIEW OR THE NOVICE USER 
TH I THINK IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH UH DEPENDING ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS I DON'T USE UH KNOW WHO'S DOING IT 
YEAH BUT IT I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO WATCH UH WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONS THERE WE WANT TO UH PUT IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH WELL YOU WE CAN PUT FUNCTIONS ON IT WHEN UH YEAH WHEN WE UH GET THE USER REQUIREMENTS UH AND WE CAN UPDATE IT 
WELL YEAH WE IF YOU WANT TRY A A A HUGE MARKET IF YOU WANT TO REACH A HUGE MARKET 
UH LIKE ELDERLY PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FOR NOVICE USER 
BUT I DON'T KNOW 
IT'S IT'S REALLY UM DEPENDING ON HOW HOW HOW FAR THE THE THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE ALREADY IN IN UM ONE IS 
YEAH PROBABLY YEAH 
UH WELL THERE ARE L AT LEAST UH BASIC FUNCTIONS UH LIKE JUST THE THE CHANNELS UH ONE TILL NINE 
UH ONE AND OFF SWITCH WHICH MUST BE CLEAR WITH A RED BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UM MOST STANDARD UH HAVE VOLUME OF COURSE AND A MUTE FUNCTION AND OF COURSE THE NEXT AND PREVIOUS CHANNEL 
I THINK THAT'S JUST BASIC WHAT WE NEED 
AND FROM THAT ONE WE CAN USER REQUIREMENTS WHAT WE NEED MORE 
OH 
YEAH I JUST UM UM I THOUGHT JOOST WAS LOOKING AT THE TRENDY THE TRENDS IN THE MARKETS 
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE UH OR ANY UM UH IF YOU PUT MORE FUNCTIONS MORE BUTTONS MAYBE IT'S COM BECOMING LESS TRENDY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UM YOU CAN JUST YOU CAN KI YOU CAN KEEP IT IN MIND THAT 
I DON'T KNOW 
UH I TH I THOUGHT THE THE WITH LESS BUTTONS YOU CAN MAKE A MORE TRENDIER UH YEAH MORE TRENDIER DESIGN I THINK 
I THINK 
YEAH 
UH WELL THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY I THINK 
YEAH THAT WAS IT 
OKAY 
WELL 
NO WAY 
YEAH 
BUT WHAT'S OUR SLOGAN 
THE SLOGAN UH 
PUTS FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
SENSE SIMPLICITY 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WHA 
BUT 
YEAH BUT YOU SEE YOU SAID THAT THAT A LOT OF FUNCTIONS AREN'T USED 
SO WHY SHOULD J WE PUT THIS FUNCTION IN 
I THINK MORE I THINK UH PEOPLE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE MORE LOOKING FOR JUST A TRENDY LOOK THAN UH MORE FUNCTIONS 
YEAH BUT UH YOU SAID YEAH D YEAH BUT THE THE FUNCTIONS ARE NOT IN THE REMOTE CONTROL WE'RE MAKING 
IT'S ONE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
NO NEW REQUIREMENTS SAY NO 
SO 
YEAH BUT 
I I IF IT'S IT SIMPLE UH TH THEY WON'T USE THE REMOTE CONTROL THEY USE THEIR OWN TH TH WITH LOT MORE FUNCTIONS 
NO NO 
EXACTLY 
MM YEAH 
YEAH BUT JUST 
KEEP IT SIMPLE AND LIKE MORE AT THE 
NO 
IT'S ONLY FOR TELEVISION 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH NOTHING MORE 
EXACTLY 
YEAH 
THE USER INTERFACE IS EASY 
AND THE BASIC YEAH BASIC FUNCTIONS YEAH 
IT'S TOO MUCH INTEGRATED IN THE OTHER 
YEAH 
WELL YOU LOOK 
LOOK AT THE MARKET 
WELL 
YEAH I UH IT'S SUNDAY I ALWAYS USE IT FOR THE UH YEAH FOR THE SOCCER UH 
WELL UH WHEN YOU UH UH WHEN YOU LIKE UH FOR EXAMPLE UM 
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I LOOKED AT THE FOR THE FLIGHTS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF FLIGHTS IN ONE PAGE IS IF IF THE 
YEAH BUT 
TRUE 
A SIMPLE YEAH 
BUT TRENDY YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
ORIGINAL 
IT WAS UH 
TRUE 
YEAH 
MAYBE UH 
UH MAYBE WE UH UH THE BATTERIES MAYBE 
IF YOU USE LARGE BATTERIES ARE SMALL BATTER BATTERIES 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
EARLY BREAK 
TO FIND HIM 
THAT'S MAYBE YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THAT'S YEAH 
YEAH 
BE ORIGINAL YEAH 
MM-HMM 
AND USE FRIENDLY YEAH 
YEAH 
MUST BRAIN STORM 
WELL 
WHY NOT 
MORE MONEY FOR US 
YEAH 
QUITE BIG 
YEAH YOU THINK 
A STANDARD OR SOMETHING 
IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE UH FOUR PHONES 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IN THE TELEVISION 
UH LIKE THIS 
A CHAR CHARGEABLE 
YEAH 
WHY NOT 
PRODUCTION 
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
TO MAKE A BASE OR SOMETHING 
IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S 
IT'S NOT THE PURPOSE TO BE HANDY IT'S 
MM 
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT IT'S UGLY I THINK 
NO 
YEAH 
TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH IT MUST BE MUST BE A GADGET TO HAVE 
YEAH 
YEAH WE C 
OR JUST GIVE A BEEP WHEN THE BATTERY'S OUT OR UH DOWN 
YEAH 
TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND YOU CAN LEAVE IT JUST THERE 
YEAH 
YES 
YEAH I'LL 
UH FIFTEEN MINUTES 
CAN YOU MAKE AN UH UH 
A PART OF F FOLDER FOR THE MINUTES MAYBE 
THAT NOT NOT EVERYTHING IN IN IN UH FOLDER 
YEAH 
MAYBE 
OR THE SH 
DO YOU GET AN IDEA OF THE SHAPE 
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER YEAH BUT 
UH UH LIKE UH LOOK AT THE PICTURES 
YEAH FLASH LIGHTS AT THE SIDE 
AT THE SIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH SIDE OF IT 
JUST TWO LEDS OR SOMETHING ON THE SIDE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL UH PROBABLY AT THE SIDE 
YOU KNOW LIKE TO THE FRONT BUT 
YEAH EXACTLY AND THEN THERE IS YEAH 
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH 
NO 
NO 
BUMPER OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
LUNCH BREAK 
OKAY THEN 
OKAY FIVE UH 
OH 
OH 
UH I GOT A NICE LITTLE SCREEN HERE OVER HERE 
I GOT LIKE THIS BIG BLACK BORDER UH ON EVERY SIDE 
I'LL I'LL FIX IT 
YEAH WHATEVER 
YES 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ORDER IS 
SO 
MM-HMM 
YES I AGREE 
YEAH 
YES 
YES 
I HAVEN'T REALLY FIND A CONCLUSION LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
DESIGN 
SOUNDS INTERESTING 
ALRIGHT 
YES 
YEAH 
IT'S ALRIGHT 
UM 
ALRIGHT I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH FOR FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
UM YES 
THE WORKING METHOD UM THERE WERE HUNDRED UH UH WE UH ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE UH 
HOW DO YOU SAY UH F WATCHED USING REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE USABILITY LAB AND THEY ALSO UH FILLED OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE UH WITH A FEW QUESTIONS 
OH I'VE LINED THEM UP HERE 
UH ASK WHETHER UM COMMON REMOTE CONTROL LOOKS GOOD OR NOT ABOUT WILLINGNESS TO SPEND MONEY ON REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT ZAPPING BEHAVIOUR AND UH AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
I UH HAVE FOUND SOME INTERESTING THINGS 
WE DO WE DO GET A MARKET 
UM THERE TO F FOR PEOPLE CLAIM M UH TO FIND REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY 
SO IF WE MAKE A TRENDY DESIGN WE SURE HAVE SEVENTY FI SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MARKET WHICH YOU CAN REACH 
UM THERE TO F FOR USERS UH ZAPS A LOT SO I UH QUOTED HERE FROM THE UH RESULTS 
ZAP BUTTONS ARE USED ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES PER HOUR 
THAT'S QUITE A LOT 
UM 
RELEVANT OPTIONS ARE OF COURSE POWER BUTTONS 
ALTHOUGH ONLY USED ONCE PER HOUR 
UH CHANNEL SELECTION VOLUME AND BUTTONS FOR TEXT AND THE MORE UM YEAH 
OTHER FUNCTIONS LIKE AUDIO SETTINGS VIDEO SETTINGS SOUND SETTINGS OR NOT USED TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND UH VERY MUCH USED 
FURTHERMORE FIFTY PERCENT SAYS 
UH THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT DOESN'T SAY WE GOT WE CAN LEAVE NINETY PERCENT OFF 
BUT 
IT EASIER UM SAYS WE SHOULDN'T MAKE IT TO UH COMPLICATED 
FIFTY PERCENT ALSO CLAIMS UH TO HAVE LOST A REMOTE CONTROL VERY OFTEN IN THE ROOM 
AND UM AN IMPORTANT THING HERE THE MOST IMPORTANT CUSTOMERS UH 
WHICH IS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR MARKET IS IN THE AGE RANGE OF THIRTY SIX TO SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD 
AND UH ELDERLY PEOPLE ARE MARKET OR LESS INTERESTED IN UH NICE FEATURES BUT MORE WILLINGLY TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO WHAT I WAS THINKING UH WRONG SIDE 
WE SHOULDN'T IMPLEMENT TOO MUCH FEATURES IN UH IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE ELDERLY PEOPLE WILL GET THE LAST 
GROUP FEATURES FOR A HIGHER USABILITY UH WHAT I WAS CLAIMING IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
UM ALL THE SETTINGS ABOUT AUDIO SETTINGS VIDEO SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS WHICH ARE NOT VERY OFTEN USED 
WE COULD GROUP THEM UH IN ONE BUTTON 
AND MAKE THEM ACCESSIBLE UH NO NO MENU BUTTON OR WHATEVER BECAUSE THEY ARE USED VERY RARELY AND WELL 
IT UH THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS THERE IS WE CAN REALLY MAKE UH YEAH HOW DO YOU SAY 
WE CAN SPARE AT BUTTONS OVER THERE 
AND UM IF YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT V. C. R. AND D. V. D. OPTIONS GROUP THEM IN THE BUTTON NOT TO UH 
YEAH 
SMALL BUTTONS SO THEY WON'T BE VERY UM HOW DO YOU SAY 
YES WON'T BE VERY PRESENT THANK YOU 
AND A TRENDY LOOK WELL UH ALTHOUGH SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET IS UH CONSISTS OF ELDERLY PEOPLE UH WHO DON'T REALLY CARE FOR TRENDY LOOKS OR WHATEVER 
I GUESS IT CAN DO NO HARM TO MAKE IT TRENDY FOR THE OTHER THIRTY PERCENT 
THAT WAS KIND OF WHAT I FOUND 
OKAY 
YES 
TWO 
NO UH I AGREE I AGREE 
NOT TOO MUCH ON 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
I DON'T REALLY AGREE ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST 
IT'S A VERY SMALL MARKET WHICH WE WILL APPROACH THEN IF WE UH WANT TO REACH CUSTOMERS YOUNGER THAN FORTY 
IT'S ONLY LIKE THIRTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MARKET 
MAYBE YEAH 
OKAY 
MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN COMPROMISE A LITTLE BIT 
NOT TOO MUCH THEN BE ALRIGHT 
YES 
YEAH I'LL HAVE A LOOK 
WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
SENSE AND SIMPLICITY 
WELL TO BE HONEST IF UM OUR UH AIM GROUP IS UH TILL FORTY 
NOT OLDER THAN FORTY MAYBE THAT'S NOT VERY UH YEAH WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO HAVE A SIMPLE REMOTE CONTROL 
I THINK WE CAN IMPLEMENT MORE FUNCTIONS THEN BECAUSE UM BASICALLY UH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE MORE ABLE TO ADAPT TO NEW TECHNOLOGY AND THEREFORE WILL BE A MORE 
YES 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK 
YES 
YEAH CONTROL 
NOT MUCH MORE THAN THAT 
YEP 
ARE WE CAN U U WE COULD PUT 'EM BEHIND THE FLIP FLAP OR WHATEVER 
SO IT 
YEAH 
Y YES 
BUT BUT FOR FOR EXAMPLE V. C. R. THAT'S BETTER EXAMPLE IN THIS CASE 
I THINK IN A REMOTE CONTROL FOR TELEVISION YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROGRAMME UH THE V. C. R. TO START RECORDING AT THEIR P. M. OR WHATEVER 
JUST PLAY STOP REWIND AND UH FAST FORWARD 
YEAH I KNOW ABOUT UH 
YES 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
YES DEFINITELY YEAH 
YEAH AND MAYBE TWO OR THREE OTHER OPTIONS BUT NOT NOTHING MORE THAN THAT 
I THINK STOP FUNCTION IS VERY USEFUL 
IF YOU HAVE A UH A PAGE WHICH CONSISTS OF MORE PAGES AND YOU ARE NOT A VERY QUICK READER 
THEN I THINK IT'S VERY IRRITATING OF THE NEXT PAGE SHOWS UP BUT 
WELL I SEE IT VERY REGULARLY THE ACTION 
I RE I SEE IT QUITE OFTEN 
MIGHT BE 
MIGHT BE 
I THINK THE PLUS AND THE MENUS BUTTON SHOULD BE UH QUITE PRESENT YEP 
YEP 
IF YOU GRAB THE REMOTE YOUR HANDS SHOULD BE ON TOP OF THE PLUS 
YES 
I THINK DOUBLE A. 
YEP 
THE MOST ORDINARY UH BATTERIES 
YEP 
I THINK ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES 
I THINK THAT'S NO THAT'S MORE FOR A FOR AN AGE RANGE OR UH TEN TO TWELVE OR WHATEVER 
YEAH YEAH THAT'S GOOD ONE YEP 
YOU I THINK THE CAN OPENER I SEE A BRILLIANT IDEA ACTUALLY BECAUSE TELEVISION AND BEER IS NOT A RARE COMBINATION 
YES 
YEP 
NO THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH A SWAPABLE FRONT OR WHATEVER 
YEAH 
YES DEFINITELY DEFINITELY 
YES IT IT IT SHOULD BE F BE VISIBLE NEARLY ANYWHERE IN THE ROOM 
SO I UH SO I SAID DURING MY PRESENTATION FIFTY PERCENT UH O 
YEAH 
A FACE 
OR UH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN YEP 
IF YOU DO THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S POSSIBLE WITHIN THE PRODUCTION COST OF TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS 
I IN IN THE BASE WE COULD LIKE MAKE UH A BUTTON AND IF YOU PUSH TO THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF IS MAKES NOISE 
THAT'S PROBABLY STUPID BUT UH SO I FOUND HERE UH FIFTY PERCENT WAS TO FIFTY 
UH FIFTY PERCENT 
FIFTY PERCENT OFTEN LOSES REMOTE CONTROL 
NO UH OF THE BASE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THING YOU PUT IT IN 
IF IN A BUTTON ON ON THAT UH 
YEAH YOU CAN MA MAKE RECHARGEABLE ONE YEAH 
WHY NOT 
IT SHOULD ONLY COST TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS OF COURSE 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
YES 
YES DEFINITELY 
YEAH 
WELL Y Y YOU COULD CONNECT THAT IT TWO HUNDRED TO TWENTY VOLTS OF COURSE 
I DON'T KNOW 
IN THE OTHER HAND IF YOU DON'T DO IT WE CAN ALSO MAKE A NICE BAY 
I MEAN IT LOOKS TRENDY AND STILL STILL PUT A BLEEP FUNCTION ON IT BUT UM I THINK THE BAY IS DEFINITELY UH 
SURE WHY NOT 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
DEFINITELY 
WITH EYE CANDY EAR CANDY WHATEVER 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
YEAH 
DEFINITELY YEAH 
IT WOULD BE NICE YES 
MOST TELEVISIONS BREAK DOWN BEFORE THE BATTERY PACK IS EMPTY SO YES 
YEAH WHY NOT 
HMM 
NO THAT'S TRUE 
WHY NOT 
BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP OH THERE IT IS YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
NEARLY 
YEAH 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH 
OH 
WE'LL SEE 
MAARTEN FIVE MINUTES 
NO THAT'S TRUE UH YEAH 
SHOULD WE BY THE WAY DRAW UM 
IN OUR NICE WHITEBOARD UM A LITTLE UH IDEA OF YEAH 
I DUNNO 
HAS ANYONE GOT UM A LITTLE BIT DETAILED IDEAS ABOUT THE SHAPE 
I DON'T FOR ONE 
A BIT BIGGER I GUESS BUT 
THE SHAPE SO ONCE IT'S UM 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND WE WANT WE WANT THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY YEAH 
YEAH BUT TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS VERY ERGONOMIC 
SO 
YEAH 
YES VOLUME AND PROGRAMME SHOULD BE THERE I GUESS BECAUSE YOU HANDS WI UH Y YOUR HANDS WILL BE IN THE SMALLER PART 
YEAH AND THE NUMBERS ON TOP I GUESS 
MAYBE RO ROUN ROUNDS UH UH L SORRY 
MAYBE LIGHTS ALSO AROUND THE VOLUME AND THE P THE PLUS MINUS PROGRAMME BUTTONS 
OH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY YEAH 
I THINK I THINK THAT'LL BE TOO BIG THA TOO BIG THEN 
YEAH 
YES WE ARE 
ALRIGHT 
YES I GUESS IT'S LUNCH TIME 
I DON'T KNOW 
HALF AND HERE 
I THOUGHT OUR NEXT UH NEXT INDIVIDUAL ROUND WAS HALF AN HOUR 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE LUNCH BREAK 
WELL 
OKAY ALL SET 
WELCOME TO THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING 
THE AGENDA 
THE OPENING 
I'LL AGAIN BE THE SECRETARY AND MAKE MINUTES TAKE MINUTES UH AND IT WILL BE THREE PRESENTATIONS JUST LIKE THE LAST MEETING 
SO UM WHO WANTS TO START OFF 
TECHNICAL UH DESIGNER AGAIN 
OKAY 
OH YEAH 
UH BEFORE WE BEGIN IT I WANT TO SAY I'VE I'VE PUT THE MINUTES OF THE UH SECOND MEETING IN THE SHARED FOLDER 
BUT THEY'RE STILL NOT UH QUITE OKAY 
IT UH TO UH STILL SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES SO THE THE FIRST PART OF THE MINUTES OR VERY HARD TO READ 
BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO DOCUMENTS THAT UH WERE LAYERED OVER EACH OTHER 
SO BUT UH FROM NOW NO I WON'T USE MY PEN ANYMORE SO WILL BE P JUST ORDINARY KEYBOARD 
I THINK IT WILL 
WILL BE MORE UH EASY FOR YOU TO READ THE MINUTES 
TWELVE AND A HALF 
ACTUALLY 
WHAT ARE THOSE T TOOTH UH BRUSHES OR SO 
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF UH WELL IT RESEMBLES THE DESIGN I HAD IN MIND FOR THIS PROJ YOU KNOW THE THE CARTOONISH ALESSI KIND OF DESIGN 
AND WE CAN WE CAN STEAL THEIR IDEAS 
HUH 
WELL IT'S A POSSIBILITY TO 
UH UH 
OKAY 
NEXT TIME WE'RE HERE 
OH OKAY 
OKAY 
UH WE DECIDED UPON THAT IN THE LAST MEETING 
DIDN'T WE 
OH OKAY 
WELL TH I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY NEW REQUIREMENTS OR SOMETHI JUST ONE BUT WE DECIDED TO USE ONLY BE BASIC FUNCTIONS ONLY 
OKAY 
WELL WE MAYBE WE CAN THINK OF THAT LATER 
WE JUST THOSE ARE THE ONES YOU ALREADY SUMMED UP ON THE 
OKAY 
YEAH 
THAT MIGHT GET REDUNDANT ALSO MAYBE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IT WOULD 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S OKAY 
OKAY 
THAT'S NOT 
IT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA 
OKAY 
NO 
NO 
BUT YOU DO MENTION THE NEXT AND PREVIOUS UH BUTTON 
OH OKAY O OKAY OKAY 
HUH 
MM-HMM 
WELL W WHEN WE ONLY USE BASIC FUNCTIONS WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO MAKE THE BUTTONS LARGER 
WELL I THINK WE ALREADY AGREED UPON THE FACT THAT THE THE THE SKIP BUTTONS AND THE CHA AND THE VOLUME BUTTONS 
TH TH THOSE TWO HAVE YEAH THEY HAVE TO BE LARGE 
UH I MEAN THE THE THE THE TWO TWO BASIC BUTTONS YOU KNOW THE TO SKIP CHANNELS AND IT UH 
I THINK YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I THINK THAT SO THAT'S IT TRENDY TOO BECAUSE THAT'S THE UM TO TO YOU KNOW 
IT'S UH ACC ACC UM ACCENTU UH HOW DO YOU SAY IT 
IT PUTS AN EXTRA ACCENT ON THE THE ON THE SIMPLICITY OF OUR REMOTES TO J TO MAKE THESE TWO MOST BASIC FUNCTIONS EXTRA BIG LIKE IT 
YEAH 
AND YOU WANT TO ACC ACCENTUATE THAT YOU KNOW 
SO 
OKAY 
NO UH THAT'S COO IT'S COOL 
WELL MAYBE C THEN WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH SPONGE BOB THEN 
IT DOESN'T STROKE WITH THE WITH THE DARK COLOURS 
NOT THE DARK COLOURS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
FOR DIVERSITY OR SOMETHING 
OH 
NO BUT I I I THINK THAT UH OUR DESIGN ALREADY RESEMBLES AS A PIECE OF FRUIT 
IT'S LIKE A PEAR OR SOMETHING 
NO I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO DO IT LIKE 
YEAH BUT IT THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU YOU KNOW LIKE EXPLICITLY OF US ARE OF OF A OF A SPECIFIC PIECE OF FRUIT 
BUT JUST YOU KNOW LIKE THE THE THE THE ROUND CURVES 
AND SO YOU I I THINK THIS YOU TO ALREADY SEM RESEMBLES UH SOMETHING LIKE A PEAR TO ME OR SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YOU DO GET THE D UH 
THE FRUITY KIND OF ROUND 'KAY 
YEAH UH YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
UH THIS IS A B YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
OF COURSE WE HAVE UH 
WE HAVE A VERY BIG UH THE S 
IF D DESIGN TEAM YEAH 
YEAH BUT 
IT'S PR I GUESS 
NO 
NO BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S ALREADY WHAT WE WERE WERE UP TO 
UH IT'S IT DOESN'T HAVE TO RESEMBLE UH WHAT I ALREADY SAID 
A SPECIFIC PIECE OF FRUIT BUT JUST YOU KNOW LIKE A FRUITY THING GOING ON 
AND IT'S IT LOOKS FRUITY TO ME 
AND UH BUT I DO LIKE THE YEAH I DO LIKE UH THE F UH AT THE IDEA OF MAKING A A YOU UH 
A CATCHY COLOUR DESIGN AND A IDEA BECAUSE I D I THINK A DARK COLOUR WOULD BE NICE TO 
MAYBE IT'S TOO MUCH YOU KNOW 
OKAY BUT WHAT ARE THE THIS IS YELLOW 
BUT I DON'T THINK OUR OUR COMPANY COLOURS ARE THESE FASHIONABLE 
YEAH IN UH IN UH IN THE BOTTOM OF THE REMOTE YOU CAN DO 
OKAY 
OKAY YOU CAN YOU OPEN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PRESENTATION 
SO WHAT WAS IN THE AGENDA 
THIS IS HIS OWN REMOTE 
BECAUSE UM MAYBE WE CAN START WITH THE TECHNICAL UH FUNCTIONS 
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THREE UH YEAH UM DO WE WANT TO ME AS AN L. C. D. DISPLAY FOR EXAMPLE 
UM ANOTHER 
YEAH BUT IT'S SO 
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO IT 
YEAH BUT NO 
I D I THINK IT'S A BIT REDUNDANT ACTUALLY 
AND IT'S ALSO NOT I DON'T TH EVEN THINK IT IT LOOKS IS LIKE SEXY OR SOMETHING IT'S 
BUT YOU'RE ALREADY WATCHING THE T. V. YOU'RE NOT GONNA WATCH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
I REALLY UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR JOB MORE EXCITING BY PUTTING AN L. C. D. ON IT 
BUT I I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD N GOO BECAUSE IT ALSO DOESN'T STROKE WITH WE WANTED UH C WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE MATERIALS 
UH IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO USE THIS PLASTIC MATERIALS WITH SOFT RUBBER STUFF ON IT 
IT WAS OR DO YOU KNOW TO GIVE IT A MORE STURDY LOOK AND THAT YOU CA LIKE YOU CAN THROW WITH IT 
BUT I DON'T THINK A L. C. D. DISPLAY FITS IN THAT IMAGE 
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE MORE VULNERABLE AND IT ADDS NOTHING REALLY YOU KNOW 
YEAH YEAH 
YOU COULD MAKE IT BUT IT'S JUST TO IT DOESN'T I DON'T THINK IT IT'S COHERENT WITH THE DESIGN WE'RE AFTER 
BUT THAT'S MY OPINION 
WELL Y Y Y OKAY WE CAN VOTE FOR IT 
YOU WANT THE L. C. D. DISPLAY 
I DON'T WANT IT AND HE DOESN'T SO IT'S UP AT HOME 
IF WE WANNA 
AND I'VE READ SOMEWHERE THAT I'VE GOT SOME KIND OF VETO VETO UH RIGHTS 
SO I CAN ALSO SAY 
BUT DID WE SKIP THE YEAH YOU COULD DO UM BUT WHAT WHAT I SEE WHAT I BUT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD 
WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE WHAT WHAT INFORMATION WE WANT TO DISPLAY ON IT 
SO 
NAH THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK 
YEAH 
UH WELL UH I'VE SEEN IT DONE BEFORE 
DO YOU KNOW THE LIKE THE THE BIGGER REM UH UNIVERSAL REMOTES THEY HAVE D L. C. D. DISPLAYS 
BUT THEN IT'S VERY FUNCTIONAL TO INDICATE WHICH WHAT UH UH DEVICE YOU ARE CONTROLLING 
SO IT'S THAT THAT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN 
BUT IT JUST TO J IT DOESN'T DOESN'T MATCH WITH THE OUR WHOLE BASIC CONCEPT 
WELL YEAH YEAH OKAY 
THAT'S MAYBE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT BUT IT'S JUST 
I DON'T THINK SO 
YEAH WELL DO YOU UH DO YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AFTER THE TRENDINESS OF L. C. D. DISPLAYS HAVE YOU 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH BUT WE'RE GONNA IF IT 
THEN UH THEN YOU BETTER DON'T YEAH D 
UH UH I REALLY DON'T FEEL THE WHOLE IDEA OF AN L. C. D. DISPLAY 
I'M SORRY 
IT CAN'T CO YOU CANNOT CONVINCE ME 
I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL HOW IT WITH YOU GUYS BUT 
I DON'T REALLY FEEL IT 
WE ALREADY WE'RE UH YEAH WE ALREADY HAVE THE THE THE THE THE BASE STATION GADGETS 
AND WANT AND IT UH UH DO IT HAS TO BE A SIMPLE DESIGN WHICH STURDY WHICH SOFT 
I DON'T THINK 
I J UH AND REALLY I DON'T SEE HOW THE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY IS GONNA ADD ANYTHING YOU KNOW IN A DESIGN LEVEL 
UH I THINK IT'S SLICKER TO HAVE AN L. CEDS 
YOU WE WANT IT IT'S SIMPLICITY 
W YOU HAVE TWO BIG BUTTONS AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH THESE TWO BUTTONS AS YOU DON'T NEED AN L. C. D. 
IT DOESN'T FIT IN OUR PHILOSOPHY UH BEHIND THE WHOLE REMOTE 
YEAH BUT WE ALREADY HAVE THE DOCKING STATION WHICH IS 
IT HAS TO BE DEVELOPED BUT NO BUT IT THAT'S THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR KILLER FEATURE 
THAT'S OUR WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL 
YEAH WE'RE GONNA DEVELOP OUR OWN R N DOCKING STATION 
UH BUT ARE WE REALLY HAVE TO CUT THIS OFF 
I RE I KNOW YOU I I I I I GOT THE DO YOU REALLY LIKE TO YOU KNOW 
THE THE L. C. D. THING BUT I I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA AND WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED ALL THE ARGUMENTS 
I DON'T UH DO YOU GUYS AGRE HOW DO YOU GUYS THINK 
I D 
OKAY WE S SKIP THE L. C. D. DISPLAY 
I'M SORRY MAYBE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING IF WE ARE AT YOUR OWN PLACE OR MAKE IT MAKE IT MAKE IT HAPPEN IN YOUR BASEMENT OR SOMETHING 
BUT 
PROBABLY IS 
OKAY 
BUT FOR THE TECHNICAL PART 
THE M MATERIAL I THINK UH IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO USE THE PLASTIC AND UH THE RUBBER 
OH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH P EXACTLY 
THIS IS WHAT IT W YEAH BUT IT IT WAS ALREADY WHAT WE'RE UH WE'RE AFTER 
YOU KNOW TO GIVE IT UH YOU KNOW THE SOFT TOUCH IN YOUR HANDS AND ALSO IT 
KNOW LIKE YEAH THAT AS YOU THE B AIRBAG KIND OF THING 
YOU CAN ST THROW IT TO YOUR LITTLE BROTHER'S HEAD 
YEAH 
NO NO NO NOT THAT COMFY 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE DARK T COL DARK COLOUR BUT YOU KNOW 
BECAUSE IT MAY BE THE DESIGN UH IT'S UH MAYBE IT IS A BIT OF THE 
IT'S A BIT NINETIES MAYBE WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE UP TO RAT FUN TO THIS POINT 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S TRUE BUT BUT IT HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIG SOLID 
IT MUSTN'T BE IT IN YOU KNOW THE TOO OVERWHELMING THEN WHEN YOU PUT IT IN YOUR JUST 
YEAH 
YEAH MAYBE SO 
NO UH I DON'T LIKE THE YELLOW AND BLACK COMBINATION 
BUT IT IS OUR COMPANY COLOURS 
APPARENTLY 
I DON'T LIKE YELLOW AND UH MAYBE I DON'T KNOW 
BUT 
OKAY BUT WHAT UH WHAT ARE OTHER TEF TECHNICAL THINGS WE HAVE TO DISCUSS 
SHOULD WE DO THAT 
I DON'T THINK YOU WE SHOULD DO THAT 
MAYBE JUST BRING IT IT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS BUT NOT OF THAT YOU CAN SWITCH FRONTS AFTERWARDS THAT'S ALSO TOO MUCH 
PEOPLE DON'T WANNA SPEND MORE MONEY ON THEIR REMOTE CONTROL I GUESS 
YEAH YEAH 
BUT UH WITHOUT GON UH OKAY 
SO ARE WE THROUGH THE TECHNICAL PART THEN 
OKAY 
SO WE UH AGREED UPON UH IN UH WELL NOT U UNANIMOUSLY OR HOW YOU CALL IT BUT YEAH 
THE MATERIALS YOU UH MENTIONED IN YOUR YOUR PERSONAL PREFERENCES WERE ALL WERE QUITE OKAY 
O O ONLY ONLY THE LAST POINT YOUR NO TITANIUM'S NOT NOT TO F QUESTION I GUESS 
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE BOTH THE THE PLASTIC AND SO UH SOFT THINGS AND IT UP TITANIUM AS WELL 
MAKES IT IN A HOMOGENEOUS UH DESIGN 
IT WILL IT WILL BREAK OTHER STUFF W WHEN IT'S PLASTIC AS WELL 
YEAH 
NO BUT UH UH YOU SHOULD UM YEAH 
OKAY THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES AND MAKE IT IN COMPLETELY TITANIUM 
WELL WOULD TO BE MORE TRENDY 
MORE CHOICE 
YEAH BUT I I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF THE THE THE PLASTIC AND THE BIG KIND OF THING 
BUT THE QUESTION IS I THEN IT'S YOU KNOW 
SO SO IT FITS IN OUR S PHILOSOPHY TO MAKE IT UH STURDY AND SIMPLE AND UH KNOW LIKE UH 
WHEN YOU MAKE IT TITANIUM IT BECOMES MORE LIKE SOME KIND OF GADGET YOU ACTUALLY DON'T NEED 
AND WHEN IT'S BIG AND PLASTIC IT'S LIKE SOME FUN STUFF YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE AROUND 
IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO HAVE SOMETHING BIG AND PLASTIC AROUND 
YEAH THAT'S BEAUTIFUL 
UH MAYBE THE MAYBE THIS IS NO 
NO I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF MAYBE A T TITANIUM KIND TYPE OF BODY W AND THEN WITH IS PLASTIC COLOURATION AROUND IT 
YOU KNOW LIKE THE THE SOFT STUFF BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE 
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE THE PLASTIC GIVE UH THE TI TITANIUM LOOK 
BUT MAKE IT JUST LIKE SHINY 
MAYBE WE SHOULD UH SH 
AND UH AND 
MAYBE WE SH SHOULD WE IT I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT UH HOW HOW MUCH TIME HAVE WE GOT LEFT 
FORTY MINUTES 
OKAY 
YOU PUTTING IN DIFFERENT COLOURS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT W YEAH 
WELL IT IS 
IT'S A POSSIBILITY 
BUT LET'S THINK ABOUT THE BASE 
MM-HMM MM-HMM 
BUT WHA THE OUR BASIC IDEA YOU I MEAN YOU GONNA WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE LIKE TWO TYPE OF MATERIALS 
LIKE THE D D B THE PLASTIC UH ENCLOSURE AND THEN THE THE PADS THAT SURROUND IT 
AND AND PRO AND LIGHTS 
WE HAVE TO INCORPORATE THE LIGHTS IT 
BUT UH DO WE GONNA GONNA ARE WE GOING TO GIVE IT A TWO TONE COLOUR LIKE 
LIKE THE THE PLASTIC MOULD IS NO NO ONE COLOUR AND THE USE THE CUSHION PADS AROUND IT OR IN ANOTHER COLOUR 
SO THAT THE IDEA 
SO THAT A GOOD IDEA 
HOW MANY COLOURS ARE WE HOW MANY COLOURS ARE WE GONNA WE'RE UH UH OF UH F ONLY FIVE MINUTES LEFT BY THE WAY 
HOW MANY COLOURS ARE WE GONNA GIVE IT 
LIKE TWO TONE COLOUR 
IT 
I THINK MAYBE THE CASE ITSELF SHOULD BE IN ONE COLOUR AND THEN THE RUBBER OF THE BUTTONS AND THE CUSHIONS AS WELL SHOULD BE IN ANOTHER COLOUR 
OKAY BUT NOT MORE THAN WELL YEAH IT'S ONE 
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT IN A L IN A LATER MEETING 
OKAY 
BUT WE HAVE TO UH THINK OF SOME OTHER UH IMPORTANT THINGS 
UH UH YEAH THE THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE THE BUTTONS 
NO 
I THINK THIS IS OKAY THE SO WE HAVE THE BASIC 
THEN WE HAVE THE NUMBERS 
WE HAVE THE POWER BUTTON 
WE HAVE WE HAVE A TELETEXT BUTTON 
AND MAYBE WANT TO ACCESS A A MENU OR SOMETHING 
MOST T. V. S HAVE A MENU 
YEAH BUT I THINK YOU UH I REALLY NEED A MENU BUTTON 
THAT'S JUST I THE ONLY BUTTON ONLY 
YOU KNOW I 
NO I THINK MOST T. V. S HAVE AN UH A MENU NOWADAYS TO ACCESS THE UH UH SCREEN SETTINGS 
AND SO 
BUT THAT THAT COVERS ALL THE ALL THE OTHER SETTINGS 
IT COVERS EVERYTHING THEN 
NO YOU CAN USE THE 
AND YOU AL CAN ALSO USE THE NORMAL SKIP BUTTONS FOR THAT 
THE ON THAT WAY WE HAVE LIKE ONLY THE NUMBERS THE POWER BUTTON SKIP AND VOLUME AND THEN UH UH TEN UH REM UH YEAH MUTE 
A TELETEXT AND A MENU AND THEN THEN I THAT'S IT 
IT'S ALL WE NEED 
OKAY UH ANOTHER STUF SOME STUFF ABOUT THE THE THE DESIGN OF THE DOCKING STATION 
SOMETHING IMPORTANT BUT A S UH IN UH WHICH SH UH SHOULD REMIND EASE OF THE REMOTE ITSELF I GUESS 
OH NO ONE COLOUR 
JUST USE 
I THINK THE SPONGY THING ALREADY UM COMES FORWARD ON THE ON THE ON THE CUSHIONS PADS AND THINGS IN THE SO HE SAID 
AND WE WILL MAKE IT SPONGY AND AND UH AND UH WELL 
THE FRUITY THING IS JUST THE SHAPE SHOULD BE FOR I DID I THINK THIS IS KIND OF FORTY YOU KNOW 
JUST ROUND SHAPES WITH UH 
YEAH BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WE REALLY HAVE TO THINK I THINK COLOURS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE FLASHY 
BUT AND BUT TO DO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANNOYING THAT WHEN YOU UH KNOW SOME THINGS IS JUST OVER THE TOP 
AND WHEN YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR TABLE FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS YOU TO JUST GETS ANNOYING BECAUSE IT'S SO BIG AND FLASHY 
UH IT HAS TO BE SOME LEVEL OF SUBTLETY BUT WE HAVE TO STILL HAVE TO THINK OF HOW WE MANAGE TO UH 
TO GET OUT THAT 
OKAY 
GUESS WE'RE THROUGH THEN 
BUT W I THINK ALSO WE JUST SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH COLOUR BUT ALSO 
I I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THE DARK COLOUR THING IN MIND 
I THINK THAT'S UH ADDS TO THE TOO MUCH COLOUR MAYBE UM UM 
BUT OUR DES DESIGN EXPERTS WILL UH WORK THAT IT 
OKAY WELL I THINK THE MEETING WILL BE OVER WITHIN A MINUTE 
SO WE WILL WRAP UP 
OR IS THERE ANYTHING WE'D LIKE TO DISCUSS 
THAT'S RIGHT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL YOU WILL READ THE MINUTES UH IN THE YOU CAN FIND THEM IN THE PRO PROBABLY 
YEAH UH ONE FOR US FOR SURE BECAUSE I'M WELL NOW TYPE THEM OUT 
UH Y YEAH 
I THINK UH 
BUT TOILET PAPER ROLL AND UH 
OKAY 
YEP 
I WAS WAITING FOR THE L LAST MESSAGE BUT 
MM YEAH 
YES 
OKAY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT UH COMPONENTS DESIGN 
UM IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE MATERIAL AND THE AND UH UH REALLY THE STUFF WE BUILD UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS OF 
UM A REMOTE CONTROL CONSIST OF UH COMPONENTS AND THE COMPONENTS OF A REMOTE CONTROL CONSIST OF UH PROPERTIES AND MATERIAL 
WE HAVE TO CHOOSE THE UH THIS UH WISELY AND IT COULD AFFECT UH UH A KIND OF GROW OF AN UH IN BUYING UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM THE COMPONENTS OF A REMOTE CONTROL OR OF COURSE UH THE CASE 
UH THE PROPERTIES OF THE CASE 
UM IT HAS TO BE SOLD UH NO HARD MATERIAL LIKE UH HARD PLASTIC UH WITH SOFT RUBBER FOR UH FALLING AND AND UH UH YEAH 
IT FEELS UH GOOD IN YOUR HAND 
MM THE BUTTONS HAS TO BE UH SLIDE IT AND THE MATERIAL IS SOFT RUBBER 
OH I'VE GOT A UH EMAIL FROM THE POSSIBILITIES OF REAL REACTION 
UM 
UH THEY'RE TELLING ME THAT UM WHEN WE BUILD UH A REMOTE CONTROL OF UM OF PLASTIC OR RUBBER THE UH BUTTONS HAVE TO BE UH RUBBER TOO 
MM 
IT'S OKAY 
YEAH 
I WHEN WE USE A RUBBLED A DOUBLED CURVED CASE 
WE MUST USE A RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS TO UH THE THE RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED CASE IS A AS A T UH THREE DIMENSIONAL UH CURVE ON THE ON THE DESIGN 
WHICH IS UH NECESSARY WHEN WE WANT TO BE TRENDY 
OH 
UM 
THE ENERGY SOURCE UH I'VE GOT A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES FOR THAT IT 
UM 
UH THE BASIC BATTERY WHICH I THI PREFER BECAUSE OF ITS UH ITS NON UH NON DEPENDING IF IF IF UH UM 
UH HERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HAND UH YEAH KINETIC UH 
ENERGY 
ALSO IN UH THIS ONE LIKE IN THE WATCHES BUT A REMOTE CONTROL CAN LIE IN A TABLE FOR A DAY 
AND THEN YOU PUSH UH A BUTTON AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO UH WALK WITH IT ALL THE ALL THE TIME 
MM SOLAR CELLS ARE ALSO UH A BIT WEIRD FOR UH REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM 
UH ALSO THE CASE MATERIAL UH I THINK THAT PLASTIC IS THE USE THE BEST WITH RUBBER BECAUSE UH WOOD OR TITANIUM 
WOULD ALSO BE A BIT WEIRD 
UH THEY DON'T TELL ANYTHING ABOUT THE COST OF UH TITANIUM 
UM 
THE CHIP UH THE CHIP SET UH AND THE BOARD SO UH ALL OFF THE SHELF 
ALSO THE SPEAKER ON THE REMOTE CONTROL WHEN WE WANT TO RETRIEVE IT 
UM THE BASE STATION IS ALSO OFF THE SHELF ALL THE MATERIALS AND THE 
COMPONENTS ARE UH JUST AVAILABLE IN UH 
IN OUR UH FACTORY 
MM 
I'VE TOLD ABOUT UH THE OTHER FIRST POINTS 
MM THE SIMPLE ELECTRONICAL CHIP UH IS IS AVAILABLE UH WITH THE LED TRANSMITTER UH TRANSMITTER 
UH IT'S ALL UH OFF THE SHELF AND EVEN THE SPEAKER AND THE WIRELESS RETRIEVER ARE ALL UH AVAILABLE IN OUR COMPANY 
UM ANOTHER POSSIBILITY 
I UH 
YEAH I LOOKED UP ONE WAS UH THE L. C. D. DISPLAYS 
COULD BE UH 
SOMETHING SPECIAL TO OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL AND IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT ONLY COST A BIT MORE 
BUT MAYBE IT CAN BE UH WITHIN THE LIMITS OF TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
OH YEAH 
I TH I GOT AN EMAIL WITH UH SOME EXAMPLES AND TO THESE WERE WERE THE MOST TRENDIEST ONE 
YOU USE UH A COVERS WHICH CAN BE 
UM I DON'T KNOW 
UM 
YES 
YES MAYBE WE CAN UH BRI UH BRING A COUPLE OF UH COUPLE OF TYPES OF UH MAYBE A KIND OF UH WHILE UH 
UM 
A WHOLE SET OF UH DIFFERENT UH REMOTE CONTROLS 
MAYBE WE CAN BRING A WHOLE LINE UH WITH UH 
WITH A HUGE VARIETY OF UH 
UH HAS UH STUFF 
LIKE UH MAYBE RADIOS AND UH TELEVISION ALSO UH IN THIS IN THIS IN THE SAME STYLE BUT 
YES BECAUSE WE HAVE TO UH WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO BRING THE LOGO AND ALL THE STUFF UH BACK INTO IT 
THANK YOU 
UH-HUH 
MAYBE WE CAN BRING IT UH UH TELETEXT AT THE TO TO THE REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT YOU'RE THE EXPERT 
YOU DID THE RESEARCH 
IT'S FROM YOUR RESEARCH 
GROUPS 
FOR A BIG TEAM OF ARTISTS 
BUT UH BUT I THINK WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE 
WE CAN'T MAKE ALL UH TEN DESIGNS 
WE HAVE TO MAKE AN DESIGN I TH I I THINK 
BUT PICTURES OF FRUIT VEGETABLES VEGETABLES 
YES YOU CAN PUT A LOGO ON TOP OF IT 
YES IT'S REALLY FRUITY 
WITH A STRAWBERRY ON TOP 
ONLY IF WE 
MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN MAKE A T. V. GUIDE ON IT FOR THE CHANNEL YOU'RE IN 
NO NO ONLY THE T. V. CHANNEL WITH THE WITH UH WITH UH FOUR PROGRAMMES 
YOU CAN UH ZAP THROUGH THEM WITH THE PAGE UP PAGE DOWN BUTTON 
YES IT CAN 
IN YOUR 
IN IN YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN YOU YOU CAN READ TEXT ALSO 
SO WHY NOT IN YOUR REMOTE 
UH PROGRAMME UH INFORMATION OR OR OR OR GO OR A GOOD 
NO IT ON TELETEXT YES 
ALSO IN THE INTERNET 
BUT 
YES BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S NEXT 
YES THAT'S UH REALLY POSSIBLE 
NO 
NO UH UM 
Y YES YOU CAN USE UH BUTTONS UH UH W THAT ARE ALREADY UH IN THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR DOUBLE FUNCTIONS 
UH THEN YOU PUSH A BUTTON 
THE TITLE AND THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAMME 
BUT BUT UH YEAH WHAT HE SAID WAS RIGHT BUT THE TELEVISIONS THEY HAVE TO BE UH CUSTOMISED TO THE 
BUT MAYBE IN FUTURE IT WILL BE A GIANT HIT AND WHEN YOU ARE THE FIRST 
YOU HAVE THE BIGGEST UH 
YES YOU CAN PUT UH A LITTLE L. C. D. DISPLAY ON IT WITH UH WITH LOTS OF INFORMATION 
BUT UH I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT 
BUT WHA BUT WHEN YOU PUT A A A TRANSPARENT UH PLASTIC UH 
UH SCREEN ON TOP OF IT IT I IT ISN'T VULNERABLE 
YOU CAN THROW WITH IT AND 
WHEN WHEN YOU PUT UH MAYBE A COLOUR L. C. D. TO UH SCREEN ON IT IT'S VERY SPECIAL AND VERY TRENDY TO HAVE UH A REMOTE CONTROL FORM 
BUT UH I'VE GOT A THE EMAIL WITH UH WITH THE POSSIBILITIES 
AND L. C. D. WAS A POSSIBILITY FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO WHY DON'T WE USE IT 
NO BUT IT DOESN'T SA SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A COLOUR OR BUT MM 
I ALF I ALSO GOT A POSSIBILITY TO PUT UH A SCROLL BUTTON ON IT 
BUT 
I DIDN'T THINK THAT 
YES BUT O ON THE 
NO WHEN YOU 
BUT IT LIKE 
YES BUT THAT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE ALREADY ON THE MARKET 
THE SIMPLE 
YES BUT BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL 
YES BUT YOU HAD A PICTURE OF IT FROM ANOTHER COMPANY 
YES IT WAS ALREADY MADE 
THE THE REMOTE CONTROL IN THE DOCKING STATION 
YES UH HAVE A PICTURE OF IT 
OKAY 
MAYBE 
I WILL RULE THE WORLD WITH IT 
YES MAYBE A BIT OF A CUSHION IS 
YES 
LIKE A B YES 
MAYBE IT BUT THEN WE HAVE TO LIKE THAT IT UH WE UH WELL NOT UM BE TOO CHILDISH TO USE 
YES REAL REAL GOOD COLOURS 
HMM 
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY FRUITY 
UH FRONTS 
OF THE 
WE CAN HAVE UH DIFFERENT UH UH FRONTS OF THE 
TELEPHONE 
OR THESE DESIGNS 
YES 
AT THIS A REAL UH YOUNG YOUNG AND DYNAMIC UH UH STYLES 
YES 
YES 
BUT ALSO WE 
YES B B BUT WHEN WE S S SOFT 
MM 
MM 
BUT IT IT THEN IT UH YOU CAN'T THROW IT IT 
IT WILL UH MAKE A HUGE NOISE OR BREAK OTHER STUFF 
WHEN YOU THROW WITH UH TITANIUM WITH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
NO UH 
TITANIUM IS A BIT UH IT'S A BIT HARDER 
BUT ALSO IN THE COLOURS THE YOUNG 
YES BUT A TITANIUM REMOTE CONTROL WHEN YOU'RE UH WATCHING T. V. UH ARE YOUR HANDS ARE A LITTLE BIT SWEATY AND THE 
YES 
SPORTS AND GAMING 
DEFINE 
YES IT'S W BUT IT IS UH PLASTIC 
YES WE WE CAN DO THAT IN THE ON THE 
WE CAN MAKE THIS IS A STYLE IT 
UH THIS IS UH JUST A 
NO WE C WE CAN MAKE IT FROM THE SAME KIND OF PLASTIC 
OH 
I DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION 
UH I I DIDN'T GET IT 
YES 
LIKE THE M. P. THREE PLAYER 
UH IN A LOT OF THEIR UH 
IN A LOT OF THEIR PRODUCT UH CATEGORIES LIKE UH EVEN IN BE IN BAGS INDUSTRY 
UH THEY BEGIN WITH UH T TYPICAL UH LEATHER BAGS BUT THEN THEY BECAME STYLISH 
WITH ALL ALL IS ALL SORT OF COLOURS AND WE KIND OF FON OF UH OF FRONTS LIKE WE CAN SEE IN THE TELEPHONE AND IT 
LIKE EASTPACK UH BEGAN A REVOLUTION WITH IT WITH ALL THESE UH KIND OF BAGS AND AND COLOURS AND AND 
YES AND AND STYLES 
THEY HAVE UH ALSO UH A KIND OF UH UM 
UH ROSES ON IT A AND UH 
THEN WE CAN ALWAYS UH IS THE SAME DESIGN FOR A GREATER RESEMBLANCE BUT WITH NEW UH WITH NEW COLOURS NEW YES 
THERE THERE ARE THERE UH COMPONENTS THREE COMPONENTS TYPE 
YOU HAVE THE BUTTONS THE THE CASE UH ITSELF AND THE RUBBER AND THE 
YES 
YEAH OR OR WHEN YOU USE THE BUTTONS AS BLACK IT YOU CAN USE TWO COLOURS AS WELL UH 
BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO PUT UH UP AND DOWN AND UH LEFT AND RIGHT 
OKAY 
OH 
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW 
I WILL MAKE AN ON THE NEXT UH TWENTY MINUTES 
BACK TO THE PEN 
OH OKAY 
AGAIN 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH MAY BE BETTER YEAH 
YEAH 
UH TITANIUM IS 
PROBABLY TRENDY I THINK 
WELL MAYBE A LITTLE BIT EXPENSIVE 
I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH PRODUCTION COST 
I 
DIFFERENT COLOURS ALSO 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OH 
OH 
WELL I SHALL GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE 
UM 
UM I STILL DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT USER REQUIREMENTS 
I WAS THINKING ABOUT JUST UH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS AND I GOT UH 
YEAH BUT BUT THEN WH I DON'T KNOW WHEN THERE ARE NEW USER REQUIREMENTS 
I UH I UH I HAVE THE I HAVE 
NOTHING 
WELL I HAVE HERE A COUPLE OF BASIC FUNCTIONS I COULD THINK OF 
I DUNNO IF THEY'RE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT 
YEAH 
YEAH I I UH WELL I POINTED THEM TO HEAR JUST TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER 
UM 
ANOTHER FUNCTION UH USE OF COURSE WE ALREADY DISCUSS IT IN THE SIDE 
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT COSTS OF IT 
OH I'VE NO IDEA ABOUT IT 
UH I WAS ALSO LOOKING FOR WHAT YOU SAID FOR I GOT AN EMAIL UH UH BUT UH L. C. D. IN IN IN FRONT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA OR MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE BIT 
TOO MUCH FOR TWELVE AND A HALF 
PRODUCTION 
IF WE GOT ALREADY UH SOMETHING LIKE A BASE 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
I D I UH JU I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT IT 
THEN I GOT A POP UPS TO GO TO THE MEETING 
BUT 
THE REMOTE CONTROL 
A LITTLE UH IT A LITTLE BIT 
A LITTLE BIT TOO BIG I THINK 
EXACTLY 
UM YEAH 
WELL THE FUNCTIONS ARE ARE NOT MORE TO DISCUSS I THINK 
IT'S IT'S JUST THE BASE THINGS WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT THE ONE V. C. R. OR THAT KIND OF UH SO THAT'S VERY EASY 
UM 
MM-HMM 
WELL THAT'S NEXT CHANNEL 
I MEAN NEXT CHANNEL 
OH 
UM UH I I GOT AN EMAIL WITH WITH AN UH A REMOTE CONTROL WITH A BASE 
SO IT'S UH JUST AN IDEA 
AND I UM 
UH THINKED OF THE BUTTON SIZES AND I'M NOT SURE UH IF THEY HAVE TO BE BIG OR UH JUST SMALL 
WELL I'M NOT A E I'M THE EXPERT FOR USER FRIENDLY BUT NOT FOR TRENDINESS 
MAYBE IT 
WELL UH OKAY THAT'S YOUR POINT 
UM YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH I'VE NOTHING TO USE 
UH WITH A LITTLE BIT LARGER YEAH 
I THOUGHT SO BUT MAYBE WITH THE 
YEAH THAT GROUPS 
LARGE 
YEAH 
MOST THE MOST USED UH BUTTONS 
TRUE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH THAT WAS ALL YOU UH PERSONAL PREFERENCE I DIDN'T HAVE 
I DIDN'T HAD ANY TIME LEFT 
SO YEAH 
IT'S THERE 
YEAH CLICK ON IT 
COUPLE TIME 
WELL HOW UH 
BUT HOW DO WE USE UH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN CHRIST'S SAKE WITH REMOTE CONTROL 
UH MAKE IT A BANANA 
YEAH BUT TH YEAH BUT THAT 
YEAH BUT THAT'S 
YEAH UH UH 
BUT DO DON'T WE NEED A CREATIVE ARTIST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT M MAKE IT TO FEEL LIKE A A A A VEGETABLE OR FRUIT 
YEAH 
BUT WE WE HAVE TO UM THERE HAVE TO BE THE THE THE THE FIRM COLOURS OUR OWN UH COLOURS HAS TO BE ON IT 
YELLOW A REAL REACTION 
OH YEAH 
WE UH F 
A YELLOW DO 
OH YEAH 
YEAH AND THE BUTTON THEN 
OKAY YEAH 
OKAY 
LAZY 
YEAH 
WELL WELL WHAT WOULD YOU DISPLAY ON IT THEN 
BUT IS IT ISN'T THAT A ALREADY ON T. V. A LOT OF NEW T. V. S 
YEAH 
YEAH AND WE ALSO HAVE TO YEAH 
AND I ALSO 
YEAH I DUNNO 
OH OKAY 
WE CAN YOU AWAY 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
UH UH I I IF IT'S IT'S A SIMPLE UP 
NO THAT THAT'S RIGHT AND UH I ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT NEW FUNCTIONS MAYBE BUTTONS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO CONTROL IT 
KIND OF L. C. D. OR SOMETHING OR 
BUT HOW DOES IT DISPLAY THEN 
W WHEN I GO TO THE SECOND CHANNEL WHAT WHAT DOES IT SHOW ME 
BUT THAT PROGRAMME 
YEAH 
SO IT FASHION 
I DON'T KNOW 
THAT'S NOT UP TO YOU 
THAT'S UP TO MARKET IF I IF IT'S TRENDY 
BECAUSE OUR OUR MOTTO IS WE PUT FASHION 
YEAH IF YOU WANT TO BE TRENDY YOU HAVE TO BE COLOURED 
COLOURED 
IF YOU HAVE BLACK AND WHITE OR SOMETHING OR GREY THAT'S 
IT'S TOO MUCH UH MAYBE UH WITH WITH THE L. C. D. AND THE DOCKING STATION AND 
WITH ONE THING SPECIAL 
NOT A WHOLE PACKAGE OF SPECIALTY 
AND UH THE 
YEAH 
IT'S JUST ONE IT'S JUST AN IDEA 
IT'S A IT'S 
TRUE 
WELL UH I UH 
YEAH I DUNNO 
NO IT'S TOO MUCH 
IT'S OVERDONE 
DEMOCRATICALLY 
WITH A SPONGY BOB FEEL 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU JUST CAN DROP IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT NOT BLACK I THINK 
WELL IF IF IT'S FRUIT AND VEGETABLES TO HAVE TO BE COLOURFUL 
BUT CAN WE GO UH UH 
CAN WE COMBINE IT OR SOMETHING 
UH WITH UH YELLOW AND BLACK

UH YOU CAN YOU CAN L UH LET CHOOSE THE CUSTOMER WHICH COLOUR HE WANTS YEAH 
YEAH THERE THERE ARE FOR UH FOR UH COLOURS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WELL YEAH THE 
THERE IT IN 
THAT'S 
AND TITA UH TITANIUM IS UH IS IS IT A ONE 
SO 
IT'S JUST LIKE THAT TH THIS TITANIUM 
NO NOT ALL NOT ALL OF THEM 
UH I THINK TITANIUM NOWADAYS IS WAY MORE OFTEN USED THAN PLASTIC 
NO TRENDY THINGS 
YEAH 
IT'S COLD IN THE WINTER 
YEAH 
YOU HAVE THAT UH M. P. THREE PLAYER OF NIKE I SAW 
ISN'T THAT TITANIUM WITH A LITTLE BIT OF RUBBER 
ISN'T IT 
SO PLASTIC 
WELL IT'S TITANIUM LOOKING 
YEAH UH SO 
HERE UH SO 
UH TH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THE M. P. THREE PLAYER OF NIKE 
'KAY UH THAT THAT'S VERY UH WITH RUBBER SO IT'S VERY 
ARGH 
TRUE 
YEAH YEAH TRUE 
YEAH MAYBE THAT'S GOOD IDEA YEAH 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO L UH YEAH LAST LONGER THAN TWO WEEKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN MAYBE 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT TIME DOES 
THE RUBBER 
YEAH 
OH NO NOT TOO MUCH I THINK 
OR YOU JUST MAKE UH ONE COLOUR UH MAYBE WITH A A Z A KIND OF LIKE A BIG WAVE OR SOMETHING LIKE UH 
NO ONE ANOTHER COLOUR 
NOT MORE THAN TWO COLOURS I THINK 
IT'S A G A LITTLE BIT TOO FLASHY 
THE FUNCT YEAH I WAS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE THE ST DO WE STILL WANT A JOYSTICK IDEA 
YEAH 
THE VOLUME TELETEXT AND 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH B 
YEAH BUT WHA WHAT KIND OF MINE 
SO UH ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM EVERY TELEVISION 
MUTE 
YEAH 
OKAY THAT'S NOT UM NOT MUCH FUNCTIONS 
SO 
OKAY 
YEAH 
TOO MUCH COLOUR I IT UH WHEN YOU GET IT IN A LIVING ROOM IT'S TOO MUCH MAYBE 
IT HAS TO BE 
YEAH 
NO 
OH OKAY YEAH 
YEAH 
I HOPE SO 
AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE KIND OF PROTOTYPE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YOU USE A KINDA PROTOTYPE YOU CAN A LITTLE BIT MORE UH 
YEAH 
WITH YOU LAPTOP 
YEAH 
OH MY GOD 
WELL YOU ARE 
WE'RE NOT 
OKAY 
KEYBOARD WORK 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
THAT'S TRUE I GUESS 
YEAH 
HUH 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH THAT'LL BE FOR THE FUTURE I GUESS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
DEFINITELY 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
THAT'S OKAY 
MM YEAH 
THEN YOU AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A FLAG IS VERY BIG R. C. 
YEAH 
NO 
NEXT CHANNEL PREVIOUS CHANNEL 
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE FUNCTION 
WELL IF YOU SAVE UH PERHAPS UH S TINY BUTTONS AREN'T USER FRIENDLY THEN WE WOULDN'T IM IMPLEMENT THAT OF COURSE 
OH THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEP 
THESE ARE PROBABLY THE THE THE 
YES 
THESE ARE PROBABLY THE B FOR MOST MOST USED BUTTONS ON THE THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SORRY 
YEAH SURE 
YOU DON'T CARE 
NO SORRY 
YEAH 
OH 
GO AWAY 
COME ON 
OH GREAT 
WELL I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH AGAIN ABOUT TRENDS IN THE INTERNET 
UM I'VE DONE SOME INVESTIGATION AND UH WELL 
I UH GET SOME INFORMATION FROM FASHION WATCHERS FROM PARIS AND UH MILAN 
SOME UH SOME FINDINGS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FANCY LOOK AND FEEL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UH WELL WE WERE GOING TO IMPLY THAT SO THAT'S NICE 
THE SECOND IMPORTANT THING IS UH INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY IN THE R. C. 
UH OUR MARKET REALLY LIKES REALLY LIKES THAT 
AND UH THE THIRD POINT THREE IN THIS UH ORDER OF OF IMPORTANCE THE THIRD POINT IS A HIGH EASE OF US 
AND UH WELL FOR THE IDEA I'VE PUT SOME TRENDS UH FOR THE MARKET OF ELDERLY PEOPLE 
DARK COLOURS SIMPLE RECOGNISABLE SHAPES 
SO WE PROBABLY WON'T DO THAT 
THE YOUNGER MARKET LIKES UH WELL THE THEMES OF OF THIS YEAR OR UH SURPRISINGLY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND SPONGY MATERIAL 
I FOUND THIS IMAGE WHICH IS UH WELL IT SYMBOLISES THE IDEA OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
I DON'T USE THE SPONGY PART IN IT 
BUT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF FANCY 
EXACTLY 
I GOT SOME IDEAS UH WELL YEAH PICTURES ISN'T REALLY GOOD WORD BUT UM 
SOME SYMBOLS OF FRUITS OR VEGETABLES MAYBE 
UH CATCHY COLOURS 
FRUIT IS UH YELLOW GREEN RED WHATEVER 
SO REMOTE CONTROLS IN IN CATCHY COLOURS 
OH NO WE DON'T WANT DARK COLOURS 
NO I JUST PUT THEM THERE TO UH YEAH UH FOR GENERAL IDEA 
AND UH THE DOCKING ST UH I THINK THE SPONGY MATERIAL IS IS VERY IRRITATING FOR THE UH REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF 
BUT IT 
YEAH THE TO IMPLEMENT SOME SPONGY THING MAYBE WE CAN DO IT IN THE ON THE DOCKING STATION 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOCKING STATION OR WHATEVER 
AND UH WE COULD BRING IN LINE WITH A DARK COLOUR UH TO UM UH P UH YEAH UH UH V HOW DO YOU SAY 
YEAH ALSO A BIT FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT CRAZY AND WANT MAYBE WANT A LITTLE YOUNGER DESIGN BUT STILL THE DARK COLOUR 
I MEAN IT IT IT REACHES A DIFFERENT MARKET UH 
BUT IT IT IT DOESN'T COST REALLY MUCH EFFORT TO BE TO UH BRING UH LIKE A BLACK R. C. ON THE MARKET OR WHATEVER 
YES 
YEAH THERE'S THERE'S ALWAYS A 
WELL THERE THERE'S ALWAYS EMPTY SPACE OF COURSE IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
I MEAN I THINK THIS PART OF THE R. C. UH WELL THE UPPER THE UPPER PART OR WHATEVER IS UH IS NOT NOT USED WITH BUTTONS I GUESS 
SO YOU YOU CAN PUT SOME FRUITY THINGS 
ONE OF COURSE NOT 
ESPECIALLY I 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH EXACTLY 
IF WE MAKE IT LITTLE BIT GREENISH 
A AND WE COULD USE ONE OF THIS FOR THE UH W WHAT IS IT 
OH 
ISN'T 
WHA WHATEVER 
YEAH SURE 
YEAH 
WELL WE WE CAN UH WE WE CAN WE CAN PRODUCE MULTIPLE UH MULTIPLE THINGS 
THIS IS THEN THE UH PER 
I DON'T KNOW THE ENGLISH WORD IS FORGET IT 
AND UM MAYBE YEAH A B A BANANA IS UH IS NO NOT EASY FOR A REMOTE CONTROL BUT UM YEAH 
MAYBE MAYBE TWO OR THREE 
YEAH 
NO SURE BUT BUT 
BU BUT THAT'S GREAT AND AND AND WHAT I WAS WHAT WHAT I WAS SAYING THE CATCHY COLOURS 
YEAH 
YEAH UH NOT REALLY 
PICTURES WAS A WAS A BAD WORD BUT 
WELL WE C YEAH 
YEAH SURE 
MAYBE WE CAN IF IF WE GOT OUR DOCKING STATION OVER HERE 
I CAN'T DRAW WITH THIS THING BUT I'LL TRY 
IF THIS IS OUR DOCKING STATION WE CAN MAKE OUR LOGO OVER HERE 
IT DOESN'T WORK 
AND THEN 
WELL THE BUTTON BUTTON OVER HERE OR WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW 
IN THE FRONT OF COURSE BECAUSE ELSE YOU CAN'T FIND OUT 
WELL THAT WERE MY IDEAS A LITTLE BIT 
I'LL CLOSE 'EM DOWN 
UM GO AWAY 
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN YES 
THE AGENDA 
WELL IT'S NICE OF COURSE 
BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DISPLAY ON IT 
I MEAN 
YEAH BUT IT SHOULD BE LI LIKE THIS BIG AND I DON'T THINK 
YES SURE 
BUT IT IT HAS TO TO SHOW AN ENTIRE TITLE OF A PROGRAMME OR AT LEAST A Q A QUITE QUITE LARGE PART OF IT AND THEN YOU GOT A VERY LARGE L. C. D. SCREEN 
BECAUSE 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
PROGRAMME INFORMATION 
BUT 
WELL A LOT A LOT OF T. V. S INDEED SHOW UH WHEN YOU UH ZAP TO A 
BUT THEN WE ALSO UH WE NEED TO BRING IT A LINE OF T. V. S WHICH WE WERE PLANNING TO BUT WHATEVER 
BECAUSE THE T. V. HAS TO SEND INFORMATION BACK TO THE R. C. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S POSSIBLE 
YES YES O OF COURSE IT'S POSSIBLE BUT YOU GOTTA UH IMPLEMENT IT IN THE T. V. S 
AND I DON'T THINK EVERYONE'S GONNA BUY A REAL REACTION T. V. WITHIN A MONTH AFTER THE RELEASE OF OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE IT BREAKS F YEAH IT IT IT'S NOT VERY SOLID IT'S UH FRAG FRAGILE 
NO 
NO 
I DON'T THINK SO EI EITHER 
OH 
BASTARD 
YEAH I GUESS 
NO 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE IF YOU UH YEAH 
NO 
WELL I THINK IT'S UH I THINK IT'S PRETTY TRENDY TO BE HONEST 
UH BUT UM I DON'T KNOW IF IF IF WELL I'M COMING BACK TO THE COSTS AGAIN 
BUT I THINK UH WE GOTTA BUILD A B PRETTY CHEAP DESIGN IT TO STAY WITHIN OUR LIMITS 
AND I THINK UH ESPECIALLY COLOUR L. C. D. WHICH IS INDEED PRETTY TRENDY 
BUT I DON'T THINK UH I THINK IT WILL BE TOO EXPENSIVE 
UH ADD TO SAY A PRICE ALSO UH FOR FOR UH MONOGRAMME UH L. C. D. OR UH COLOURED L. C. D. 
YEAH REALLY IF YOU IF YOU C I 
I IN ONE TWO THOUSAND AND FOR YOU CAN'T UH PUT SOMETHING ON THE MARKET WHICH IS A MONOGRAMME 
REALLY 
YEAH 
WE WE'VE WE'VE GOTTA FIND A BALANCE OF COURSE 
AND I THINK 
WE HAVE A PEAR 
SO THAT IS 
WAS IT IT WASN'T JUST A PROTOTYPE 
EXACTLY I'VE NEVER SEEN IT IN A STEREO 
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE TOO MUCH YEAH 
OKAY 
NO 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH FOR THE SPONGY UH FILE 
YEAH 
YEAH AIRBAG 
IF YOU DROP IT IF YOU DROP IT THE AIRBAG COMES TO YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
YEAH B YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE I I WAS POINTING OUT 
WHAT 
UH A B 
OH 
YEAH 
HMM 
WELL WE CAN SEE SO I 
DRAW REALLY NICELY OVER THERE 
WE CAN PUT THE LOGO ON OUR UH IN OUR BASE STATION 
OH YEAH 
AND MAYBE VERY VERY TINY ON THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF 
BUT I 
YEAH 
I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S ENOUGH 
THAT'S WAY TOO NOKIA 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
JUST BRING MORE DESIGNS ON THE MARKET 
WHY NOT YEAH 
SURE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH I THINK IT I THINK IT DOES 
YEAH O 
IN THE OTHER HAND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE FRUIT FRUITY STUFF WITH UH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE 
YES 
YEAH 
WHAT 
OH YEAH 
OKAY YEAH 
YEAH I SEE 
YEAH BUT BUT BUT 
YEAH I TH I THINK THAT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE UH THAT'S DIFFERENT MATERIAL AND THEN YOU GOTTA HAVE LIKE UH UH UH TWO MATERIAL LINES OF OF OF 
YEAH IF IT'S JUST A COLOUR UH WHICH YOU UH WHICH YOU CHANGE THEN I GUESS IT'S IT'S NICE TO HAVE ONE OF THIS 
OH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YEAH YEAH 
YES 
NEW PRINTS ON IT 
YEP 
HOW DO YOU MEAN 
THE THE THE UH BASE IN A ONE ANOTHER 
YES 
HOW THE BUTTONS YEAH 
YEAH 
NO DEFINITELY NOT 
YES DEFINITELY 
NO I THINK THAT'S TOO VULNERABLE 
YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S I WAS THINKING THAT'S GOTTA BE IN THE TELEVISION 
MM 
YEAH IF IT'S C OF 
YEAH I THINK IT'S OKAY TO TO ADD A MENU BUTTON FOR UH AND OF THE T. V. DOESN'T HAVE A MENU THEN 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU CAN PUT THAT IN THE TWO EIGHT FOUR AND SIX OR WHATEVER 
MM YEAH 
A MUTE AND A TELETEXT AND A MENU 
THAT'S ALL 
HMM 
GREAT 
YEAH 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
ARE WE GONNA DO SOMETHING WITH THE UH SPONGY THING THERE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH IT'S KINDA FRUITY AND WITH THE WITH CATCHY COLOURS UH UH W 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
I GUESS SO 
YES 
Y YEAH 
YEP 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I GUESS NOT 
DO YOU GUYS 
NO 
IN THE SHARED FOLDER 
YOU'LL SEE IN YOU EMAIL I GUESS 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
CONSTRUCT ONE YEAH 
ALRIGHT SHALL WE GET BACK TO WORK 
GREAT 
YEAH 
BASTARD 
YOU LAZY 
OKAY WELCOME TO THE DETAILED DESIGN MEETING 
AGAIN I'M GONNA TAKE MINUTES 
UH WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION FIRST 
UH WHO'S GONNA GIVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION 
YOU TWO GUYS 
OKAY 
GO AHEAD 
UH IN THE THE THE MUTE BUTTON MISSES NOW 
DO YOU DO YOU DID WE WANT TO HAVE A M MUTE BUTTON 
HUH 
WAIT THERE'S WAS ONE THING I WANTED TO ASK 
OH THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS FOR REMOTE CONTROLS TO UH D UH LIKE 
UH D I CALL IT TEENS AND TWENTIES 
UH YOU THE THE THE THE TWO NUMBERS 
YEAH BUT DO WE HAVE DO WE NEED EXTRA BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE SOME UH SOME HAVE TO 
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED THEM 
BECAU B L A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS WORK THAT YOU WHEN YOU THAT YOU WHEN YOU FOR YOU PUSH THE ONE FIRST 
THEN YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF SECONDS NO I DON'T THINK SO 
NAH I DON'T THINK IS REALLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A I KNOW SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT DON'T HAVE THESE BUTTONS 
BUT YOU STILL CAN KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN STILL SELECT THE TWENTY UH A NUMBER IN THE TWENTY OR IN THE TEN 
NO I THINK UH I REALLY THINK IT'S ONE BECAUSE YOU CAN WHEN WHEN YOU PUT A BUTTON ON IT WITH LIKE ONE AND UH THEN A DASH 
IT'S THE SAME THING IS WHEN YOU JUST PUSH THE ONE 
BECAUSE IT I IT FIRST GIVES YOU THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THAT THAT UH SEPARATE BUTTON YOU ALSO HAD TO UH APPLY 
YEAH BECAUSE THAT'S I IT'S FOR TELEVISION 
IT'S EXACT THE SAME THING 
NO LISTEN LISTEN 
WHEN YOU PUSH THE BUTTON THE REMOTE CONTROL GIVES A SIGNAL 
I IN THE ON THE FIRST PLACE IT GIVES A SIGNAL WHICH IT WOULD ALSO SEND WHEN YOU PUT A SEPARATE BUTTON ON IT 
THE ONE WITH DASH THAT SIGNAL GI AND WHEN YOU WHE WHEN YOU DON'T PUSH ANOTHER BUTTON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL WITHIN FIVE SECONDS 
THEN THE REMOTE CONTROL GIVES A SIGNAL FOR CHANNEL ONE 
I THINK IT WORKS THAT WAY REALLY 
YEAH BUT IT'S EXACT THE SAME THAT WE WOULD APPEAR WHEN YOU PUT A SEPARATE BUTTON PUSH A SEPARATE BUTTON 
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T UNDERST UH YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND MY POINT 
I THINK IT'S EXACT THE SAME THING WHEN YOU 
NO BUT THEN THEY WOULD A WOULD ALSO SUPPORT THAT BUTTON BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME THING 
LISTEN WITH THAT THAT'S THAT SPECIAL BUT BUTTON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT UH 
THAT'S JUST A SIGNAL TO RECEI JU THEY SEND A T SIGNAL TO THE V TV T. V. THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT A IN IN IN YOUR SCREEN AND A DASH 
WHICH YOU CAN PU SO YOU CAN UH STILL PUT ANOTHER NUMBER IN IT 
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THAT SEPARATE BUTTON AND YOU PUSH Y NO IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING 
DO YOU YOU THE REMOTE CONTROL GIVES THAT SOME SIGNAL IS IT WOULD GIVE WHEN YOU ONLY HAD 
YEAH 
BUT YOU GIVE THE INPUT 
YOU PUSH THE ONE 
THAT'S THE SAME THING IS THE BUTTON WITH THE ONE AND IT YES IT TO USE 
THINK ABOUT IT 
AND IT'S THE SAME THING WHAT HAPPENS AND A G REMOTE CONTROL GIVES ANOTHER SIGNAL AFTER FIVE SECONDS THAT IS JUST ONE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH BUT I M UH BUT IT'S I I KNOW FOR SURE THAT SOME TELEVISIONS THAT WE TH TH THE REMOTE CONTROL SUPPLIED 
ONLY HA HAS THE C THESE BUTTONS WITH A ONE AND A DASH AND A TWO AND A DASH 
BUT WHEN YOU USE A B A ONE REMOTE CONTROL THAT DOESN'T SPORT THESE BUTTONS IT STILL WORKS 
BUT OKAY WE WE'LL IMPL 
NO WE'LL APPLY THEM THEN FOR NOW 
YEAH APP JUST APPLY THEM NEXT TO THE ZERO THE ONE AND THE TWO 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YEAH FOR NOW IF WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHETHER 
YEAH BUT OKAY 
WHAT I SAID ABOUT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL SENDING ANOTHER SIGNAL THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE 
BUT I STILL THINK I IT AT ALL T. V. S IN SOME WAYS SUPPORT IT I DON'T KNOW 
I THINK IT'S MORE C IS M MAYBE WE DON'T UH WE BOTH DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW IT I HOW IT REALLY WORKS 
BUT I THINK THERE'S MORE TO ONE THAN WHA THAN WHAT YOU JUST SAID 
I DO THINK THAT UH UM T. V. S SUPPORT MUR MULTIPLE KIND OF REMOTE CONTROLS 
THE WON'T WORK WI WITH UH TO HAVE THAT SPECIAL BUTTON 
OKAY WELL WE'LL SEE 
BUT 
WELL LET'S UH LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DOCKING STATION LATER BECAUSE UH MAYBE WE HAVE WE HAVE TO UH CONSIDER THE DOCKING STATION ANYWAY 
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME UH COST ISSUES STILL TO COME 
BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK ON I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YES 
THAT'S IT 
I THINK ADDED LIGHTS ARE GONNA BE A PROBLEM IT 
OKAY 
FOR NOW UH THIS IS UH IS GOOD ENOUGH 
YEAH WHAT WAS UH IN THE 
OKAY BUT IN THE UH YEAH THE COLOUR 
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA USE UH ONE COLOUR FOR THE THE PLASTIC ENCLOSURE AND ONE COLOUR FOR THE RUBBER ISN'T IT 
THEN WE'RE GONNA DO THE BUTTONS ON THE I OR WE'RE GONNA HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS 
AND THEY'RE BE A THEY'LL BE IN THE SAME COLOUR IS THE RUBBER ON THE SIDE 
OKAY 
AND I THINK WE SHOULD USE A A DARKER COLOUR FOR THE UM PLASTIC AND MAYBE SOME MORE M BRIGHTER AND FLASHY STUFF 
YEAH WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE LIGHTS LATER 
'CAUSE I ALSO DON YEAH IT'S DEPENDS ON THE COSTS AND SUCH 
BUT UH AND WE HAVE TO AGREE UH OPEN THE EXACT COLOURS BUT MAY I DUNNO IF THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER 
OKAY FOR NOW THIS IS THIS IS OKAY 
UM THE NEXT UP YOU YOU GONNA GIVE A PRESENTATION IT 
UH I HAVE TO USE THE AGENDA 
DETAIL DESIGN 
EVALUATION CRITERIA 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH I THINK FOR MAYBE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT'S 
YEAH MAYBE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON TASTE 
UH I MEAN IT'S KIND OF OUR DESIGN 
IT'S SO IF MAYBE A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND IT REALLY UGLY YOU KNOW O OTHER PEOPLE FIND IT REALLY COOL 
I DON'T KNOW OR UH I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU 
CASTING 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT WE DO WE DIDN'T WE'RE WE'RE NOT PLANNING TO USE FRONTS I BELIEVE 
WITH A COLOUR A C A COLOURS 
OH OKAY 
OKAY BUT 
UH MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THREE OR SOMETHING THAT WE YOU KNOW OR 
YEAH 
UH I WAS THINKING ABOUT FOUR AS I THINK THERE IS UH 
YEAH WELL LET THAT LET'S MAKE THAT A ONE 
THAT'S ONE THING FOR SURE 
YEAH TWO OR A ONE I GUESS 
IT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY PUT WORK INTO 
YEAH 
BUT 
WELL MAYBE A TWO BECAUSE OF THE MENU BUTTON OR SOMETHING 
AND TELETE 
YEAH WE DON'T KNOW IF THE UH THEY'RE NECESSARY 
I THINK A TWO 
COME A LONG WAY BUT NOT WE DIDN'T NOT UH 
NO W W IT CAN ALSO ALWAYS BE MORE SIMPLISTIC ABOUT TWO SO YEAH 
YEAH UH A T I THINK A TWO 
YEAH YEAH Y I IT'S HARD TO SAY FROM THIS PICTURE 
BUT I DO THINK IT'S MORE 
BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S MORE TRENDY THAN BEAUTIFUL 
SO SO I THINK MAYBE IT HAS TO SCORE HIGHER UH IN THIS THEN ON THE 
A THE A THREE 
I I UH WHEN YOU COMPARE TO THE 
UH UH WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITH 
OKAY 
NO 
YEAH BUT WE UH YOU MEAN THE RUBBER STUFF 
YEAH BUT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE LIGHTS UH 
AND I DON'T U ALSO IT'S ALSO REALLY NOT INNOVATIVE IT'S MORE 
NO SIX 
OR SEVEN MAYBE YEAH 
OR SIX 
YEAH MINE IS SEVEN 
UH IT'S UH DEPENDS ON THE ON THE MAYBE 
NO I THINK I THINK ACTUALLY IT'S A SEVEN MAYBE BUT THERE'S NOTHING INNOVATIVE BUT IT 
NO NO NO IT 
YEAH I MEAN THE DOCK STATION BUT BUT UH I THINK THE THE DOCKING STATION IT'S GONNA BE A KIND OF A PROBLEM 
BUT 
WELL LET'S LEAVE IT OPEN FOR UH FOR US LATER TO SEE WHAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REEVALUATE ANYWAY 
WELL I I YEAH 
NO 
OKAY FOR NOW IT'S A SIX OR A SEVEN UH SEV SIX MAYBE BECAUSE 
YEAH BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S VERY INNO YEAH 
YEAH V 
YEAH MORE THROUGH UH LIKE FUNCTION T. V. FUNCTIONALITIES AND NO NO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
YOU HAVE MUST BE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR REMOTE CONTROLS BUT MORE ON HOW YOU CONTROL STUFF NOT ON HOW YOU FIND YOUR YEAH 
YEAH IT'S THAT'S THAT'S THINK ABOUT IT LA LATER ON AND UH 
YEAH AS A A ONE OR A TWO UM UH AT LEAST 
YEAH IT'S GOOD 
NO I WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT ONE BEFORE 
UH YOU SKIPPED ONE UH 
UH HERE 
REMOTE CONTROL WILL BE BOUGHT BY 
YEAH 
DEFINITELY 
WELL 
UH JUST IN GENERAL 
YEAH A TWO 
YEAH BUT I THINK I THINK TWO 
UH THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION 
IT'S JUST W IT WILL BE BOUGHT BY PEOPLE UNDER FORTY 
YEAH YOU CAN YEAH YOU CAN BE VERY PICKY ABOUT IT 
OH YEAH JUST MAKE IT WE'LL MAKE IT A TWO 
OH NO 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU HAVE MAKE AN SLOGAN IS QUITE OBVIOUS 
UH THE UH SORRY NO NOT NOT THE SLOGAN 
YEAH YOU CAN PUT THAT IN THE SIDE IF IF WE WOULD LIKE IT 
YEAH AND I WILL I TH STILL THINK IT'S GONNA BE A TWO OR A THREE 
MAYBE A THREE THIS TIME 
AND UH 
UH IT'S A ONE OR A TWO 
YEAH MAKE IT A TWO 
IT'S NOT THAT BAD 
YEAH AND THAT'S MOSTLY THE INNO WHEN WE UH SCORE HIGHER IN INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY WE WOULD SCORE TWO 
WHICH IS UH QUITE A GREAT SCORE 
OKAY 
UH THIS IS WAS UH THE EVALUATION 
BECAUSE I I STILL THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS MEETING STILL HAS 
YEAH 
STILL OPENED OR UH 
YEAH 
OKAY FINANCE 
BECAUSE UM 
I RECEIVED UH A SPREADSHEET 
YEAH BUT I UH ACTUALLY DON'T NEED THIS PRESENTATION I GUESS 
OH 
I'M GONNA OPEN THE SPREADSHEET AND WE'RE GONNA WORK THIS IT TOGETHER BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALLY FIN UH I HAVE A 
DIDN'T REALLY FINISH IT 
WELL WE UH WE'LL SEE 
WE'LL STUMBLE UPON SOME PROBLEMS 
I PROBABLY HAVE ALREADY OPENED IT HERE 
TRY IT AGAIN 
FIRST OF ALL THE MM ALL THE DOCKING STATION AND COSTS AND SUCH ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS LIST 
BUT LET'S LET'S ST START WITH BEGINNING 
WE INCLUDE ONE BATTERY 
I I UH I'LL EXPLAIN ITS UH THE THE COMPONENTS ARE LISTED OVER HERE 
UH PRICE IS GIVEN 
WE UM YEAH WE WE UH INDICATE THE AMOUNT OF COMPONENTS OF THE SPECIF SPECIFIC COMPONENT HOW MUCH WE NEED OF THEM 
AND THEN UH WE'LL UH CALCULA DON'T WATCH THE NUMBER YET 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S FILLED IN PROPERLY 
OKAY WE NEED ONE BATTERY 
NO BATTERY 
I THINK ONE BATTERY IS ENOUGH 
WE DON'T NEED KINETIC SOLAR CELLS HAND DYNAMO 
A S OKAY THIS THIS IS A P FIRST PROBLEM 
UH I THINK 
WE SHOULD KNOW HOW MANY 
SIMPLE CHIPS REGULAR CHIPS 
OKAY 
BUT 
WHERE DID WE FOUND THIS INFORMATION 
WAS IT 
I THINK IT WAS UH YOUR JOB IN THE FIRST UH MEET UH 
IF YOUR FIRST PRESENTATION TO MAKE THIS COLOUR BUT THEN YOU HAD SOME TO TIME PROBLEMS 
BUT DO YOU THE YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT CHIP WE NEED 
MAYBE YOU CAN UH LIKE IT UP RIGHT NOW 
OKAY BUT OKAY 
WHEN WE DON'T WHEN WE LEAVE THE UH RETRIEVER AND SUCH ASIDE WHAT THEN IT WOULD BE A SIMPLE CHIP 
AND WITH THE RETRIEVER IT WOULD BE AN ADVANCED CHIP 
OKAY 
YEAH BUT IT WILL IT WILL IT WILL BE CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
THE SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER 
WHAT IS IT UM SO THAT THE SPEAKER WE WERE T I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
OKAY WE WENT FOR THE DOUBLE CURVED CASE 
MADE OUT OF PLASTIC 
AND RUBBER 
AND WITH A SPECIAL COLOUR 
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT WE WERE 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SPECIAL COLOUR BUT I THINK WE UH 
YEAH I THINK WE UH WE HAVE SPECIAL COLOURS 
OKAY THEN THE PUSH BUTTON I WAS JUST COUNTING THEM 
UH I THINK YOU HAVE TO INDICATE THE AMOUNT OF PUSH BUTTONS WE WANT TO USE ISN'T IT 
WELL THAT'S BIT OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE I RE BUT I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I CAN IMAGINE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH FOR MORE PUSH BUTTONS 
AND IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO THIS UH SHEET 
YEAH 
YEAH IT WOULDN'T 
FILL IN THE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS YOU PLAN TO USE IN THE AND THE TOTAL COST I DON'T KNOW 
I 
AND I COUNT THEM LIKE THIS 
ONE TWO THREE UH FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE AND THIRTEEN 
BECAUSE UH THIS IS UH THIS IS AN OKAY 
TWELVE OKAY THEN IT WOULD BE EIGHTEEN BECAUSE UH I UH RATED THEM IS UH UM 
SO UH UH UH SEPARATE BUTTONS 
YES 
AND PLUS THESE TWO OF UH PLUS THE MUTE BUTTON AND IT'S WILL BE UH EIGHTEEN 
YEAH I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
YOU I D I DON'T GET THE POINT BECAUSE IT'S WOULD BE 
SO RELATIVELY SO EXPENSIVE JUST THIS UM SMALL BUTTONS 
WELL OKAY WELL WELL LET'S MAKE IT JUST ONE 
HERE NOW IT'S NOW IT'S ALREADY SO SHALL WE JUST 
GIVE OUR OWN INTERPRETATION TO BECAUSE ELSE WE WOULD REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM 
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE IT 
AND AND LESS BUTTONS THAN THIS ISN'T POSSIBLE 
THIS IS THE MOST SIMPLE YEAH IT IS POSSIBLE BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE 
YEAH WITHOUT THE NUMBERS 
THAT'S POSSIBLE 
YEAH WE COULD SKIP THE NUMBERS 
THEN UH TELETEXT WOULD ALSO BE IM IMPOSSIBLE 
OKAY WE'LL WE'LL JUST OKAY 
BUT THEN STILL WHEN WE THERE'S NO ROOM FOR A DOCKING STATION OR SOMETHING 
THE W LE LET'S SEE THE WE HAVE UH UH YEAH BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS 
WE'LL GIVE THE BUTTONS SPECIAL COLOUR 
WE'LL GIVE THEM A SPECIAL FORM 
UH I THINK WE SHOULD MARK THE SPECIAL FORM THING BECAUSE AT THIS WILL BE SOME SPECIAL FORMS INCORPORATED IN THIS BIG BUTTONS I GUESS 
BECAUSE THE BUTTONS WILL BE UH D WILL BE MATCHING COLOUR BETWEEN THE BUTTONS AND THE RUBBER SURROUNDINGS 
I THINK THAT'S THE WHAT THEY MEAN BY A SPECIAL COLOUR 
I THINK ALL THE SPECIAL COLOUR THINGS HAVE TO BE MARKED OVER HERE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WERE PLANNING TO DO MAKING IT 
YEAH SPECIAL MATERIAL ARE ALSO BECAUSE I HAS RUBBER 
AND THE BUTTONS HAVE TO BE RUBBER 
'KAY BUT THE PROBLEM NOW IS THAT THE 
THERE'S NO SUCH THING IS A DOCKING STATION IN THIS LIST BUT WE CAN ALL IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A DOCKING STATION FOR THIRTY CENTS 
SEPARATELY 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH BUT I DO LIKE THE IDEA BUT W YEAH 
IT UH BUT IT THEN THE DOCKING STATION ISN'T RELEVANT FOR THIS PROJECT ANYMORE 
BUT WE CAN BUT THEN YOU STILL HAVE TO USE WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT CHIP WE U AND 
I THINK WE CAN AGREE ON THIS 
I I THINK THE SPECIAL COLOUR THING HAS TO BE UH MARKED 
'CAUSE I THINK WE UH YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHAT WHAT WHAT THEY UH MINE 
BUT CAN WE FIND IT UH BUT UH THESE CHIPS 
BECAUSE WHEN WE DON'T NEED A D A DOCKING STATION THEN PROBABLY WE ALSO HAVE ONLY WE ALSO NEED A SIMPLE CHIP 
AND MAYBE THEN WE CAN DO SOMETHING EXTRA 
OH NO HE HE STILL UH IT'S GONNA GET MORE EXPENSIVE WITH 
TWO 
THEN WE HAVE SOME MONEY LEFT 
WE CAN PUT THEN 
WE CAN PUT A SCROLL WHEEL ON IT OR SOMETHING 
YEAH WELL WHO KNOWS 
OR A LITTLE BIT OF TIN TITANIUM 
YEAH OR WE CAN KI DO THE KINETIC CELLS 
THAT'S ALSO MAYBE AN IDEA 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT THEN WHAT HE HAS TO FIND OUT 
MAYBE YOU CAN UH FIND IT IN YOUR EMAIL RIGHT NOW THEN WE KNOW THEN WE EXACTLY KNOW WHAT IT WILL COST US 
MAYBE IS THAT THAT'S NICE TO KNOW 
YEAH B B BUT WHEN WE YEAH BUT WHEN WE SKIP WHEN WE UM WHEN WE DON'T USE THE D WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE THE DOCKING STATION 
THEN WE STILL YEAH WE NEED SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE TO MAKE IT KIND OF SPECIAL BECAUSE THAT WAS OUR OUR SPECIAL FEATURE 
YEAH OKAY YOU CAN ALSO DO THAT BUT MAYBE 
IT STILL USE A SPECIAL REMOTE CONTROL CONS UH YOU KNOW WI ITS FORM IS SPECIAL AND MATERIAL 
YEAH BUT FOR TWO EUROS THEN WE HAVE STILL MAYBE WE HAVE TO USE THE ADVANCED CHIP THEN TWO EUROS ISN'T EVEN POSSIBLE 
YEAH THEN BECAUSE THEN WE'D THIRTY CENTS LEFT 
YEAH BUT YEAH I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE MAYBE D UH YEAH WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WITH THE SIMPLE CHIP 
YEAH AND WE NEED AND WE UH AND IF AND WHAT IS THIS 
SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER 
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FOR US PRESENTATION 
S TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
OH 
UH UH UH 
HEY 
MM 
I DON'T THINK HERE IT'S AN HOUR ALREADY 
IT'S NOTHING ABOUT IS YEAH 
NO 
BUT I IN THE PRESENTATION OF YEARS THERE WAS ALSO SOMETHING ABOUT DIFFERENT COMPONENTS 
WHICH ONE WAS IT 
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
OH 
OH YES IT WAS THE SECOND ONE 
YEAH IT WAS YOUR SECOND YOUR FIRST PRESENTATION 
SORRY 
UH THIS IS IN THIS IS NOT THIS ONE THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE 
I DON'T UH 
NO THIS IS THE OTHER ONE 
OR MAYBE SOMETHING IS UH MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING BE IN IN THIS 
HERE 
YOU KNOW THAT A PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP BUT A SCROLL WHEEL TO TO ME REQUIRES OKAY SO WE ONLY NEED A SIMPLE CHIP 
NO NO THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE CHIP 
A SCROLL WHEEL TO USE UH ONLY STATES THAT A SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRES A REGULAR CHIP AND THAT A DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP 
SO WE DON'T NEED ANY OF THEM 
AND WHAT'S THE SAMPLE SENSOR SLASH SAMPLE SPEAKER 
OKAY 
BACK TO THE COSTS 
SO WE'RE GONNA USE THE SIMPLE CHIP 
NAH THERE IS SOME MONEY LEFT TO BE SPENT 
OKAY BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT NOW IS THAT IS IS IT STILL A SPECIAL REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT I MEAN IT ISN'T IT HASN'T GOT ANY INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY WE AREN'T GONNA APPLY ANY UH INNOVATED INNOVATIVE TE TECHNOLOGY ANYWAY I THINK 
I DON'T I DON'T SEE ANY POSSIBILITY TO DO IS BECAUSE IT WOULD WOULDN'T FIT OUR DEFI DESIGN PHILOSOPHY 
BUT WHAT WE SEE THERE SOME EXTRA MAYBE I THINK MAYBE THE KINETIC THING IS SOMETHING 
INSTEAD OF THE RECHARGEABLE THE RECHARGEABLE THING WAS SOMETHING TO ME KNOW SO YOU S PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR BATTERIES ANYMORE 
MAYBE WE IF WE PUT THE KINETIC THING ON IT 
YEAH YOU LEAVE THE P YEAH I KNOW BUT STILL I THEY WILL THINK ABOUT THAT 
I MEAN IF YOU U 
THE UH IT'S MADE FOR US PEOPLE WILL TH THEY DON'T IF IT WAS UH UH R USELESS TECHNOLOGY THEY WOULDN'T PUT IT UH AS A POSSIBILITY 
AND I IT AT THE THE THE THE TARGET THE TARGET UH GROUP ARE PEOPLE WHO ZAP REGULARLY AND THROW WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROL IS A MATTER OF SPEAKING 
BECAUSE I THINK IT WHEN WHEN THERE WE WAS A REMOTE CONTROL WHERE IT WAS USEFUL TO HAVE A KINETIC UH UH POWER SOURCE 
THEN IT WOULD BE THIS ONE 
BECAUSE IT'S ON IT GETS THROWN AROUND THROWN AROUND A LOT AND IT GETS USED A LOT 
HEY THAT MAYBE THAT'S COOL THAT'S A COOL THING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW 
YOU DON'T USE BATTERIES 
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
NO WE WE WE CAN'T MAKE A DOCKING STATION ANYWAY 
YEAH WE CAN ALSO OUR UH ALSO UM WE WE CAN MAKE ONE WE CAN STILL MAKE 
YEAH BUT BE SERIOUS THEN UH THE DOCKING STATION WILL BE A FIFTH OF THE PRICE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH BUT WE UH WE DON'T INC WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE THESE COSTS OF THE SPEAKER AND OTHER STUFF 
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALISTIC FOR YOU TO DO IS 
UH BECAUSE WE 
WE WILL LOOK AT ALL THE SPECIAL STUFF WE HAVE 
COLOUR A THE COLOURS ARE SPECIAL THE FRAME IS SPECIAL 
AT THE THIS IS WHOLE CONCEPT 
UH MAYBE IT WITH THE KINETIC THING I THINK WE COULD DO UH DO A COMPROMISE UH WITH THE KIM KINETIC THING 
OH NO 
YEAH I DON MY SUGGESTION IS IT JUST FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE DOCKING STATION THING AND MAKE IT UH LIKE A 
UH UH I I I I STILL FEE I ALSO FEEL THIS CONCEPT OF MAKING IT KINETIC 
BECAUSE OF THE YOU KNOW TO GO IT GIVES SOMETHING DYNAMIC TO THE REMOTE CONTROL 
NO THAT WOULDN'T N NO 
YEAH AND IT IS ALSO NOT A GOOD IT'S NOT YOU HAVE TO REALLY DO IT ONLY KINETIC YOU DON'T WANT TO TO THINK ABOUT BATTERIES ANYMORE 
NO NO 
YEAH IT'S GREAT 
NO NO NO 
NO NO THIS IS VERY SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY 
WHEN YOU USE IT YOUR REMOTE LIKE ONCE A DAY OR MAYBE EVEN LESS I I IT 
IT WE CAN MAKE IT YEAH NO 
BECAU B BUT A REMOTE CONTROL GETS WHY DO THEY STATE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED IF IT 
YEAH UM BUT A W UH UH IN UH A CALCULATOR ALSO WORKS ON OR NO SOLAR CELLS 
BECAUSE I THINK THE D WHOLE DYNAMIC PART DO YOU KNOW APPEALS TO ME QUI UH THINKING OF OUR DESIGN PHILOSOPHY YOU KNOW 
WITH THE RUBBER PARTS AND UH STURDINESS OF THE THING AND YOU WHEN YOU MOVE IT AROUND A LOT 
THEN PEOPLE FIND THE IDEA FUNNY THAT WHEN I MOVE MY REMOTE CONTROL AROUND AND 
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
TRUST ME 
THE IDEA OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS THAT YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT IT JUST HAPPENS 
OKAY THEN WE D OKAY WELL YOU WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT BUT WHAT THAT WOULD JUST HAVE A LACK OF KEY FEATURES YOU KNOW 
YOU M HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING ON YOUR BOX 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE PEOPLE BUY IT AND UH 
WE CAN REALLY CAN DO THE DOCKING THING UH IT'S NOT YEAH UH WE CAN DO IT BUT IT'S WOULD BE A EASY WAY IT 
OKAY BUT WE HAVE TO AGREE TO AGREE UPON SOMETHING BECAUSE UH WE ONLY HAVE A MINUTE LEFT OR SO 
NO NO IT'S NOT POSSIBLE 
OKAY WE B WE CAN SEE WE CAN LEAVE IT IN B WELL THEN THEN THE IT'S THIS IS THEN THEN OUR CONCEPT IS READY 
YEAH WE MAKE SOME EXTRA PROFIT OF IT 
HUH ANY IDEAS 
NO NO UH THERE'S STILL THERE'S STILL SOMETH CONCEPT AND SOMETHING SPECIAL LEFT 
I MEAN WE'RE GONNA IT'S GONNA EXCEL IN IN IN IN THE THE RANGE IN THE FIELD OF DESIGN AND AND UH LOOKS AND FEEL 
THAT'S WHAT IT'S MAKES IT SPECIAL 
YEAH AND I WOULD AL I WOULD HAVE LIKED A KINETIC PART AS WELL TO GIVE IT SOME 
JUST TO GIVE IT SOME EXTRA SPECIAL FEATURE AND UH I KNOW IT WILL WORK 
BUT UH IT'S IT'S NO THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT PUTTING TECHNOLOGIES ON THIS BUT IF IT IF IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO 
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN 
OKAY WELL WE LEAVE IT LIKE THIS 
THEN IT'S C THEN WE'RE YEAH 
OKAY PROJECT E UH WELL WE WERE GONNA WHAT LIKE TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAST SHEET 
YEAH WE HAVE TO YEAH IT'S 
UH I DON'T KNOW 
YES 
'KAY WE'VE MADE A PROTOTYPE 
UM WE'VE GOT UH 
UH OUR ASPECTS FROM THE LAST MEETING 
UH ESPECIALLY WE LOOKED AT THE FORM MATERIAL AND THE COLOUR 
UM WE'VE UH DRAWN HERE THE P PROTOTYPE 
THE LOGO IS UH 
SO UH 
IS PRETTY UH OBVIOUS TO USE IN THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL BUT 
IT IS NECESSARY WHEN YOU WANT TO BUILD YOUR UH COMPANY OF IT A LEVEL HIGHER 
UM 
OR INTERFACE ELEMENTS THERE ARE SHOWN IN THE ON THE DRAWING 
MAYBE YOU CAN UH POINT THEM UH 
THE FUNCTIONS 
BUT UH THAT IT'S UH HERE THEN ON THE MIDDLE 
YES UM 
WE'VE DISC 
MOST OF THE USERS 
YES YOU THERE THERE WILL BE A P A LITTLE A LITTLE P. ONE THAT AND A LITTLE UH YEAH 
YES 
IT'S A TELEVISION 
YES 
YES YES YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A LOT OF STANDARD BUTTONS THAT HAS TO BE UH ON IT 
UH THE WITH THE ONE AND A DOUBLE UH UH YES 
YES YOU HAVE TELEVISIONS THEN YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO UH PRESS 
YES BUT BUT A LOT UH 
YES BUT 
SOME TELEVISIONS DON'T ACCEPT UH THAT THAT 
NO NO BUT SO 
YES BUT SOME SOME OLD TELEVISIONS UH YOU HAVE TO UH CLICK ON UH A SPECIAL BUTTON 
UH THEN YOU GO TO A A NEXT LEVEL YOU CAN PUSH TWO BUTTONS 
YOU WANT 
YES BUT SOME TELEVISION DON'T SUPPORT IT 
IN A REMOTE CON 
YES SO THEY NEED AN THEY NEED 
NO BUT UH 
YEAH IT 
AND THE BUTTON FOR THE SCART UH AUDIO VIDEO UH EXTERNAL INPUT 
NO NO 
UH REMOTE CONTROL SENDS ONE SIGNAL TO ONE BUTTON UH PRESS 
UH SOME 
IN SOME TELEVISIONS WHEN WHEN YOU WANT TO GO FURTHER THAN UH TEN 
NO YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO UH GIVE THE TELEVISION UH TWO OR MORE SIGNALS 
WHEN YOU UH PRESS ONE BUTTON YOU GIVE NO SIGNAL 
AND THE OLDER TELEVISIONS NEED MORE SIGNALS TO GO A LEVEL HIGHER 
BUT 
WHEN YOU MAKE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THAT IT WILL UH GIVE MORE SIGNALS 
IT COULD WORK BUT 
JUST A BASIC IDEA OF OF OF THE MOST UH MOST YOU 
MOST COMMON UH AND SIMPLE UH OPERATIONS ON THE REMOTE 
YES 
IT'S HERE IN THE 
WE CAME UH 
YES 
BUT MAYBE WE CAN MAYBE WE CAN MAKE THE DOCKING STATION UH UH A BIT STANDARD FOR FOR UH THE OTHER PRODUCTS WE SELL 
BECAUSE REAL REAL REACTION SELLS MORE PRODUCTS THAN ONLY REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO MAYBE WE CAN UH IS THE DOCKING STATION FOR EXAMPLE UH M. P. THREE PLAYERS OR OR UH 
UH HEARING DEVICES 
YES BUT WHEN YOU PUT THAT SAME VOLT VOLTAGES ON IT 
YOU CAN PUT UH WHEN THE WHEN THE WHEN UH O THE THE THE LOWEST PART OF IT 
WHEN IT'S O THE SAME AS THE OTHER PRODUCTS YOU CAN PUT IT ALL IN THE SAME UH 
YES BUT WE CAN MAKE 
NO WE CAN MAKE UH MAKE THE MOST LOWEST PART ALL THE SAME 
WHEN WHEN THE THE RECHARGER HAS A HAS A BIT WHAT POINTS TO WE CAN PLACE ALL ON TOP OF IT 
JUST HAVE TO BE BIG ENOUGH FOR THE BIGGEST 
NO WHEN YOU MAKE IT LARGE ENOUGH ON IT IT WILL NOT 
BUT THEN IT'S A LITTLE BIT 
BUT IT'S JUST AN IDEA 
BUT IT'S FLAT IT'S FLAT SO SO THIS IS WE CAN P MAKE ALL THE PRODUCTS IS FLAT SO THIS 
YES BUT WHEN YOU MAKE UH UH A BIT OF BIG 
YES LITTLE HOLER LITTLER UH LITTLE PRODUCTS GO DEEPER IN IT 
YES 
AND UH UH 
THE OF THE LOOK AND FEEL WOULD BE GREAT ON THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL 
BECAUSE UH YOU ALWAYS UH WELL UH PICK UP THE REMOTE CONTROL IN THE ON THE SMALLEST UH OR 
THEN YOUR UH LEFT THUMB OF UH YOUR RIGHT THUMB IS UH NEAR THE PROGRAMME UH BUTTON 
WHICH IS THE MOST COMMON USED UH FUNCTION AND ALL THE OTHER BUTTONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR UH THUMB 
SO IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY GOOD DESIGN 
YES UH IN THE SIDE UH THERE WILL BE A STRIP OF RUBBER 
AND IN THE MIDDLE UH THERE IS UH A HARD UH A HARD MATERIAL A BIT HARD PLASTIC WITH A LIGHT UH BEHIND IT 
YES WE CAN MAKE ALSO N NEON LIGHTS ON IT OR OR THE BUTTONS THAT CAN MAKE UH LIGHT ON IT 
YES 
BUT IT WILL ALSO UH UH USE BATTERIES AND DO WE WANT IT 
THE ALL THE ASPECTS OF THE INTERFACE BUTTONS WERE UH 
YES 
YES 
YES MAYBE WE CAN SEE IN THE ON THE LIGHTS ON THE SIDE WE CAN USE UH UH MULTIPLE UH LIGHTS IS IT WILL UH 
YES 
NO 
YEAH 
I THINK I THINK THE THE FRONTS WILL GIVE IT A MORE UH UH UH LESS UGLIER UH SAID 
BECAUSE YOU CAN UH MAKE IT IN YOUR OWN YES YOU CAN MAKE IT IN YOUR OWN UH 
MORE TO YOUR OWN PERSONALITY OR OR HOUSE STYLE 
YES 
OR FORTY 
I THINK TWO OR THREE 
YES 
YES 
YES 
YES 
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BUTTONS 
ALSO THE THE THE BUTTONS OF THE ON THE TWO THE THE DIGITS O THEY'RE USED UH UH 
CAN YES THREE TWO 
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL WITHOUT THEM BECAUSE 
YES 
YES 
A ONE 
WE WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE IT UH THE THE BEST TRENDY LOOK UH OVER 
YES 
YES 
NO 
NO NOT L. C. D. S 
BUT THAT THAT'S NOT INNOVATIVE 
LIGHTS LIGHTS ARE 
SIX 
BECAUSE WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT INNOVATIVE BUT IT BUT IT 
WITH THE LIGHTS IT IT'S IT'S KIND OF FEATURE 
BUT STILL YOU CAN RETRIEVE IT WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S GONE WITH THE WITH 
YES 
THE DOCKING STATION IS A AS A LITTLE BIT INNOVATIVE 
IT'S A PART OF THE REMOTE 
AND WITH THE SPEAKER ON THE THERE'S ALSO A SPEAKER 
OKAY 
BUT THE RETRIEVAL OR THE 
YES HOW WOULD YOU INNOVATE A REMOTE CONTROL MORE 
TO PUT IT IN YOUR HEAD 
YES 
YES 
YOU LIKE THE BUTTONS 
YES 
NO NO AND COMPARING WITH UH PEOPLE OF THE OF THE AGE ABOVE 
WE DON'T KNOW 
BUT 
YES TWO BUT ONLY ONE C WHEN YOU COMPARE IT WITH WITH ELDERLY 
THIS IS JUST GUESSING 
MAKE IT A TWO 
WHEN IT SUCCEEDS UH IT CAN GET A TWO UM 
A LOGO 
YES UH ENCRYPTED UH WITH 
YES 
YES 
SO THERE SOMETHING AFTER THIS UH MEETING 
OR 
OKAY 
YES 
UH IT'S IT'S NO NO CHIP BUT BUT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE FROM IT 
THE SIMPLE CHIP IS E ENOUGH I I THINK ABOUT WITH THE LIGHTS WITH THE LIGHTS AND THE RETRIEVAL IT CAN BE UH 
NO UH I 
YES MY MY MY UH 
THE THE EMAIL I GET USED UH SIMPLE CHIP BUT WHEN WE PUT IN THE SPEAKER AND THE RETRIEVER UH DEVICE 
IT WILL UH COST A A BIT MORE LIKE I THINK THE ADVANCED CHIP MAYBE 
BECAU IN THE THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT A RETRIEVER OR A SPEAKER UH ON IT 
THEN IT'S A SIMPLE CHIP 
YES I I I SEE I 
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR FUTURE UH RECOMMENDATIONS 
I DON'T KNOW IT UH THERE 
YES 
OTHERWISE YOU GET UH A STANDARD UH PLASTIC COLOUR 
STANDARD RUBBER 
SET 
YES 
NO IT'S ONLY UH WHEN YOU USE PUSH BUTTONS IT WILL COST THAT MUCH 
IF YOU USE A SCROLL WHEEL 
MAYBE IT'S THE KIND OF PUSH BUTTONS 
YOU CAN HAVE F FOR KIND OF PUSH BUTTONS 
RUBBER 
YOU CAN HAVE UH 
DIFFERENT YES 
WHY IS THAT IS UH EXPENSIVE 
SO WHE WHEN YOU SO THEN IT 
IT'S EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PRICE OF THE OF THE AMOUNT OF 
WHEN YOU HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF BUTTON YOU HAVE TO PUT IN W IN YOUR CREATION 
BIRD 
AND THEN THROW IT 
BUT WHA 
I'VE SEEN ONE UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL WITH ONLY THE P YEAH ONLY WITH UH PAGE UP PAGE DOWN AND VOLUME BUT BUT 
UH IT'S IT'S STILL FOR LITTLE CHILDREN 
THEY CAN HANDLE THAT REMOTE CONTROL BUT BUT IT ISN'T FO 
YES IT'S FOR IT'S L UH IT'S JUST FOR A LITTLE 
OTHERWISE IT 
OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE THE 
SPECIAL FORM ALSO IT SAYS 
WHAT IS THE NORMAL MATERIAL 
SH YEAH 
CLASSIC 
UH PLASTIC 
BUT WE CAN UH SELL THE REMOTE CONTROL AND UH SELL THE DOCKING STATION YES 
AND AND BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO TELL IT 
BUT WHAT WE CAN SAY IF CAN UM ALMOST MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BUY A REMOTE CONTROL WITHOUT THE DOCKING STATION 
NO BUT YOU OTHERWISE YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE IT 
BUT FOR TWO EUROS AND THIRTY CENTS WE UH WE DON'T GET A DOCKING STATION 
FOUR 
FOR TWO EUROS 
IT ISN'T IN MY INFORMATION SO I DON'T KNOW IT UH THERE 
IT ISN'T IN MY INFORMATION I UH I I'VE GOT A 
SCHEMATIC VIEW OF THE REMOTE CONTROL BUT NOTHING ABOUT UH ADVANCED CHIPS OR 
OH I'VE GOT HERE IN UH I WILL PUT A I WILL PUT A PAGE ON IT 
WHEN MY MOUSE WORKS AGAIN 
MY MOUSE IS UH 
YES 
OH 
OH I'VE GOT IT 
I WILL PUT UH 
MY EMAIL ON THE 
THE NETWORK 
IT'S ON IT 
YES 
UM 
YES THAT WAS MINE 
BUT THAT WAS MY SECOND 
MM 
BUT THIS IS THE SAME UH 
THIS IS O ONLY THE POSSIBILITIES 
YEAH 
WE CAN USE A SIMPLE A REGULAR OR ADVANCED CHIP 
OH OKAY 
WITH THE LIGHT 
L. C. D. 
MAYBE YOU CAN SAY AGAINST THE REMOTE UH PAGE UH OF UH PAGE UP PAGE DOWN 
ALL IN TWELVE EUROS 
TWELVE EUROS AND FIFTY CENTS 
AND THE LIGHTS 
WHERE UH ARE THE LIGHTS 
BUT BUT SOMETIMES YOU PUT A 
KINETICS AREN'T UH NOWADAYS ONLY USED IN WATCHES AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS WALKING 
UH SOLAR CELLS R USELESS 
F FOR A DOCKING STATION 
WITH A CABLE WITH UH BUTTONS ON IT WITH RETRIEVAL UH DEVICE ON IT 
W WITH A BUTTON IT 
W WITH A BUTTON TO RETRIEVE IT IS IT WILL BEEP 
UH SO IT'S UH WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY 
LOOK AT THE CASE THE CASE THE CASE OF OF UH OF UH 
NO THEN WE HAVE TO SELL IT FOR THIRTY EUROS 
IT'S THE 
MAYBE WE CAN UH CAN DO IT BOTH 
MAYBE WE CAN DO IT BOTH UH IN THE ON THE ON THE REMOTE 
BATTERY AND KINETIC 
YES BUT WHEN IT'S THEN WHEN IT THEN YOU HAVE TO SHAKE IT UH AND ALL WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S EMPTY 
YOU ASKED FOR OTHER D 
NO THAT'S NO THAT'S NOT TRUE 
UH A WATCH SO UH KINETIC BECAUSE YOU WALK ALL THE TIME 
YES SOLAR CELLS ARE ALSO STATED 
WHY DON'T WE USE SOLAR CELLS THEN 
THAT'S TRUE 
OUI 
YOU CAN DO IT FOR FIFTY CENTS 
THE C THE CASE THE CASE ALONE IS IS IS UH 
THE CASE ALONE FOR UH REMOTE CONTROL IS AT LEAST ONE OR 
THEN WE HAVE ONE EURO THIRTY FOR THE WHOLE DOCKING STATION 
BUT NOW 
GREAT 
IT'S GREAT 
OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
YES 
SEVENTY EUROS 
WHY NOT A HAND DYNAMO THEN 
WE'RE DONE 
SO THIS IT 
OKAY 
YES 
WHERE'S THE CHAMPAGNE 
I DON'T UH HERE A BALL 
BYE 
UH-HUH 
JUST FILL THAT NO NO

YEAH 
YOU UH YOU CAN WE WHEN YOU PUSH THE ONE YOU CAN SHOW ON THE TELLY A ONE AND JUST A DASH 
AND THEN WAIT UH TWO UH SECONDS OR SOMETHING 
WE'LL DISCUSS THEM IN THE USABILITY LAB 
UH EVA EVALUATION 
I DON'T KNOW UH I DON'T KNOW IF IF IT'S IT'S NECESSARY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OUCH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL IT YEAH UH THERE'S NOTHING I THINK IT'S PRETTY BASIC

AND THEN WE CAN GET A DOCKING STATION 
BUT WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO 
BUT UH WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THE SIMPLE CHIP AND WHAT'S DIFFERENCE WITH A REGULAR CHIP AND A ADVANCED CHIP 
IF IF I 
REGULAR CHIP AND BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE UH SPECIAL FUNCTIONS IT IS UH AN ADVANCED CHIP FOR EXAMPLE 
YEAH 
WE'LL GO BACK UH TOMORROW 
THAT'S THE QUESTION 
IF WE DO I DO WE NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP OR IS IT OKAY IF 
NO 
NO NO THEY WERE UH MINE YEAH 
DID 
YEAH IT'S OPEN 
IT'S CIRCUIT BOARD 
IT'S ONLY JUST BASICS FOR FOR 
AT THE END CIRCUIT THERE IS AN INFRARED LED 
COMPONENTS DESIGN 
COMPONENTS DESIGN MAYBE 
ON ON TOP 
WORKING DESIGN 
YEAH BUT IT'S THE THE OTHER ONE

CAN WE DO IT W WITHIN TWO TWO OR 
MM-HMM 
BUT IT'S ORIGINAL 
BUT THEN WE COULD MAKE A DOCKING STATION 
WOW W WHY NO LI LIKE IT NOW WE GOT TWO 
TWO THIRTY LEFT 
C CAN'T WE MAKE A DOCKING STATION OF THAT 
I DON'T KNOW 
WELL WE WE UH 
YEAH THEN WE DON'T HAVE ANY INNOVATION THINGS 
NO WE ONLY MAKE LESS PROFIT OF IT 
NO 
CHEAP REMOTE CONTROL 
IT W IT WON'T TELL BUT 
NO UH NO NO 
YEAH WE JUST HAVE TO GO ALL WHAT WE DID TODAY AGAIN 
YOU HAVE TO DO IT OVER 
YEAH 
THE 
NO BUT NO 
YEAH YEAH

YEAH WE'RE DOING NOW 
BUT IT'S 
OH OKAY 
NICE 
ALRIGHT I 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT AND UH YOU GOTTA POINT AT WHICH IS THE VOLUME UM UH BUTTON AND WHICH IS THE PROGRAMME BUTTON 
YEAH BUT YOU YOU GOTTA MAKE IT CLEAR ON THE ONE 
YEAH AND A AND A TRIANGLE ONE THAT 
YES 
NEXT TO THAT I KINDA MISS A ZERO ACTUALLY 
ALL IN ONE THAT'S UM KINDA DEPENDENT ON THE TELEVISION 
I THINK 
YEAH I THINK YOU SHOULD ADD 
A CROSS OR WHATEVER 
YEAH LINE 
NO THAT'S DEPENDENT ON THE TELEVISION 
I DO KNOW SO 
YEAH 
YES BUT UH UH IN UH REMOTE CONTROL NOWADAYS ARE UM THEY COME WITH THE TELEVISION 
ARE ACTUALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND 
BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL BUT EASE OF 
NO NO NO 
SO SOME TELEVISION RESPOND DIFFERENTLY 
LIKE IF UH I I 
YES 
YES THAT'S TRUE 
NO 
NO IT IT IT WORKS UH IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT UH A SPECIAL BUTTON FOR IT UH IF YOU PUSH A ONE 
THEN ON YOUR TELEVISION THERE WILL APPEAR A ONE AND A A LINE WHICH IS AN EMPTY SPACE 
YEP 
TRUE 
ONE IS SOME SOME TELEVISIONS AND THE INPUT FIRST UH AND AND YOU C 
NO THAT'S NOT TRUE 
IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE 
IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE 
OH

I KINDA MISS THE DOCKING STATION 
NO NOTHING REALLY TRENDY ABOUT IT 
THE BUTTON 
YEP 
I THINK THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT SHAPES OF UH UH DEVICES 
YEAH OF COURSE 
MM-HMM 
WELL IT TO GET IT IT HAS GOT TO FIT INTO THE SHAPE OF COURSE 
THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE VOLTAGE CAN BE THE SAME 
THAT'S UH THAT'S TRUE 
BUT UH I IF YOU ALL MAKE THE UM HAVING A BOTTOM LIKE THIS THEN THEY ALL FIT 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE BUT UH 
YES BUT UH I I GO 
SHOULDN'T IT FALL THEN

WHY UH WHY NOT A SEVEN 
HOW 
YEAH YOU THINK THE LIGHTS ARE INNOVATIVE 
WELL IT'S N TRUE 
UH I AGREE UM BUT 
I'LL 
YEAH YOU YOU DIDN'T DRAW THE DOCKING STATION 
YEAH IT IT'S I THINK I THINK WITH ITS 
I THINK MORE UM 
UH THAT THAT'S ONE 
NO UH WELL THE AGENDA SAYS EVALUATE NOW SO I THINK WE 
IT'S IT'S A SIX 
THAT UM F YEAH FOR THE RETRIEVAL FUNCTION 
YEAH 
I THINK THAT'S VERY INNOVATIVE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH SURE ABOUT 
BUT I D I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK IT'S A FIVE BUT 
REMOTE CONTROL IS EASY TO USE 
I THINK A TWO 
YEAH 
COME ON 
THE REMOTE CONTROL HASN'T GOT UH 
I'VE JUST FILLED UH 
GO AWAY 
I FOUND TWELVE QUESTIONS SO MUCH ABOUT IT STILL USE TEN 
IT WILL BE BOUGHT BY PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF FORTY 
NO NO NO 
NO JUST IF THEY IF THEY BUY IT 
YEAH WHAT DO YOU THINK 
ANTEK 
NO THAT'S NO COMPARISON 
AND I DON'T MEAN TWO PEOPLE

I HAVEN'T GOT AN IDEA IN IN WHICH WE NEED IT IS REALLY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW 
I MEAN YOU GET THAT EMAIL 
DID IT POINT OUT WHAT TO USE THEM FOR 
ALRIGHT WELL POINT AT THE ADVANCED CHIP FOR NOW I GUESS 
I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S VERY SPECIAL 
ALRIGHT THAT'S OKAY 
NO 
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE IT SAYS AMOUNT 
THE THE THE YELLOW ROW IS THE AMOUNT OF 
IT NO THAT'S TOTAL OF FOUR BUTTONS 
I THINK THAT 
EIGHTEEN

FIFTY CENTS FOR ONE SINGLE STUPID BUTTON 
YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH 
I CAN'T I I I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT IF IT WAS FIFTY CENTS PER UH UH PER BUTTON 
REALLY 
YEAH YEAH

YEAH YEP 
I THINK SO IT 
UH I DON'T KNOW 
UH WHY 
I MEAN I I IF YOU IF IT WOULD COST TWO EUROS THAT HAD A TOTAL A TOTAL THING 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO I MEAN UH WE'RE NOT GONNA ADD UH A TRIP TO HOW IT IT 
I LIKE THE HAND DYNAMO PART 
WE CAN MAKE A PLAIN DOCKING STATION FOR TWO EUROS 
I MEAN 
WE WI WITHOUT RECHARGE 
YEAH BUT BUT WE CAN MAKE A DOCKING STATION FOR TWO EUROS UH IF YOU DON'T PUT THE RECHARGE FUNCTION ON IT 
I MEAN 
IT HAS A SHAPE 
OF COURSE IT HAS A SHAPE BUT I I 
WHY SHOULD THAT NOT BE POSSIBLE 
NO FOR FOR THE UH FOR THE DOCKING STATION IF YOU DO IF YOU CHOOSE THE SIMPLE CHIP 
YES

WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE 
UH WHATEVER 
THIS ISN'T HELPFUL 
NO THAT WAS MY PRESENTATION 
IT'S ALREADY OPEN 
IT'S AT THE BOTTOM

NO THAT'S TRUE 
UM BE 
OR THE HAND DYNAMO DYNAMO 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT BUT IF WE C 
I DON'T KNOW IF 
FIVE MINUTES 
THAT'S NOT TRUE 
WE CAN MAKE A DOCKING STATION FOR TWO THIRTY 
TWO THIRTY 
WE CAN MAKE A DOCKING STATION 
SURE 
SURE 
THE POWER DEVICE SO SO I I IS VERY CHEAP 
THAT'S JUST A REGULAR UH POWER CABLE AND WHATEVER 
SO 
YEAH 
WELL THEN IT'S A USELESS PROJECT 
CAN'T WE UH 
CAN'T WE SAY FIFTEEN EUROS 
NO STA YEAH I MEAN 
NO 
YOU CAN SELL FOR TWENTY SEVEN AND A HALF 
THEN YOU MAKE AS MUCH PROFIT SO YOU WOULD WITH TWELVE AND A HALF PRODUCTION COSTS 
I DON'T THINK 
NO 
THIRTEEN TWENTY 
AND I THINK ONLY 
YEAH BUT ONLY KINETIC THEN YOU GOTTA 
YOU YOU GOTTA THROW UH THROW IT THROUGH THE ROOM LIKE TWENTY TIMES AN HOUR REALLY 
NO 
YEAH IT'S FUNNY FOR A WEEK 
I GUESS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT AROUND VERY FREQUENTLY IS DEMOTIVATING 
NO I I DON'T MOVE MY UH MY REMOTE CONTROL VERY MUCH SERIOUSLY 
WELL WE'VE GOT MORE THAN FIFTY CENTS 
YEAH 
NO WE WON'T BUT THAT'S UM SOMETHING ELSE 
NO THIS NOT GONNA SELL 
NO 
OF COURSE NOT 
WE COME BACK TOMORROW OKAY

UM SO EVERY TIME WE WE'LL DO SOME INDIVIDUAL WORK GET MEETING TALK ABOUT IT UH AND THEN GO INTO THE NEXT PHASE 
THAT'S JUST TO 
UM 
WE HAVE UH THESE TWO SMARTBOARDS 
UM WELL SO I JUST SHOWED THERE'S A PROJECT MANAGEMENT FOLDER A PROJECT DOCUMENT FOLDER ON THE DESKTOP 
IT JUST WORKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS A COMPUTER 
YOU JUST UH CLICK ON THE ON THE FOLDER AND YOU OPEN THE EVERYTHING YOU YOU PUT ON IT WITH YOUR LAPTOP

KEEP UH THAT IN MIND WHEN WE UH TALK ABOUT OUR UH MATERIALS ONE OF AND STUFF AND UH MARKETING UH RESEARCH 
NOW THEN WE ALL UH WE CAN UH SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS UH WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT OUR CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
FIRST ABOUT DESIGN UH BUT UH UM IN THE MARKET

LINE WIDTH 
UH FIFTEEN 
AND I CAN DRAW 
OH 
UH THE LINE WIDTH IS TOO THICK BUT UH WELL 
OH 
IT SMILES NICELY 
NOW I HAVE TO CHANGE THE LINE WIDTH 
OH NO 
THESE ARE WHISKERS YOU KNOW

I FEEL TOTALLY TO USE 
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO 
ALRIGHT 
WELL I I DIDN'T HAVE TO PREPARE ANYTHING ABOUT UH IT'S NOT 
IT'S IT'S NOT MY TASK TO UH TALK ABOUT UH EXPERIENCE WITH CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS BUT UH 
MM-HMM 
NO BUT UH THE B THE BUTTONS HAVE TO UH HAVE TO HAVE UH INTERNATIONAL RECOGNISABLE BUTTONS AND UH 
AND NUMBERS AND UH THAT EVERY CULTURE IN UH YEAH PEOPLE IN EVERY COUNTRY CAN RECOGNISE 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH SO IT DOESN'T UH BECOME TOO COMPLICATED WITH TOO MUCH BUTTONS AND UH 
AND STEREO UH SO UH AUDIO INSTALLATIONS 
MOST PEOPLE DO YEAH 
IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 
YEAH 
WELL 
HMM 
IT HAS TO BE DIFFERENT AND FAMILIAR AT THE SAME TIME 
YEAH THE SHAPE WILL WILL HAVE TO BE RECOGNISED 
I THOUGHT ABOUT UH LIKE MOST UH REMOTE CONTROLS UH OUR UH A LONG BOX SHAPED THING YOU CAN MAKE IT UH TRIANGLE SHAPED 
BUT THAT'S NOT UH VERY RECOGNISABLE 
VOILA 
I 
MM 
UH BUT IT UH IT HAS TO BE UM YEAH 
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO KNOW IT'S A REMOTE AND NOT ANOTHER 
YEAH 
YEAH SO THE LONG BOX UH SHAPED THING MUST BE UH YEAH USEFUL 
ARE ALSO UH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ANO ANOTHER SHAPE 
YEAH 
YEAH A L THE LONG BOX SHAPE YEAH 
YOU HAVE TO USE ONE HAND

BUT NO NO NO AT THE AND IT'S STILL THIS LONG 
BOX SHAPE WITH CONVENIENT UH ROUND UH SHAPES UH 
TO FIT 
YEAH YES I THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH 
A BIG RECOGNISABLE BUTTON ON TOP OR SOMETHING 
THE BUTTONS SHOULD UH ALSO BE NOT TOO SMALL NOT TOO BIG OF COURSE AND UH IN UH UH NOT TOO CLOSE UH TOGETHER 
UH-HUH 
YEAH OF COURSE UH TO UH TO UH TO HAVE ICONS TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS 
YEAH 
COLOURS YEAH 
I THINK WE HAVE TO TALK ALSO BUT UH THE THE MATERIALS FOR ME 
ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING TH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH NOW WE CAN STILL TALK ABOUT THE MATERIAL WE HAVE SOME SOME MINUTES LEFT UH I W WROTE DOWN UH THAT THE CASE SHOULD BE PLASTIC OF COURSE 
HARD PLASTIC THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE UH RUBBERY I THINK UH 
NO NO NO 
MM 
ALRIGHT 
AND OF COURSE THERE ARE SEVERAL ELECTRICAL CABLES IN IT TO UH TO CONNECT THINGS UH TO EACH OTHER 
I THINK SO 
IT'S A A COMMON STAN STANDARD WAY INFRARED BEAMS AN INFRARED BEAM I THINK 
IT IT'S A W WE MAKE AN A UNIVERSAL REMOTE IS IT UH HAS TO WORK WITH UH ALL KINDS OF BRANDS AND THINGS 
AND HAVE WELL YEAH I'VE WROTE SOMETHING DOWN BUT HOW IT WORKS 
THE USER PRESSES A BUTTON AND WITH AN INFRARED BEAM IT SIGNALS THE TELEVISION SET ACCORDINGLY BUT THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS I THINK 
WELL BUT THE ABOUT THE STANDARD FRONT WILL BE UH JUST GREY OR SOMETHING UH BE A SIMPLE COLOUR NOT NOT VERY FLASHY 
PINK TELEVISION SETS PINK REMOTE 
ALRIGHT 
I MUST NOT FORGET MY PEN THE NEXT TIME

IT CERTAINLY IS 
EASY TO LEARN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I ALSO THINK WE SHOULD NOT ADD TOO MANY BUTTONS 
MODERN DAY UH REMOTES HAVE TOO MUCH BUTTONS I THINK 
PRECISELY 
YEAH 
YEAH INDEED 
YEAH WE SHOULD MAKE IT COMPATIBLE PERHAPS WITH EVERYTHING WE SO WE UH WE MAKE 
YEAH 
AND I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO WHO WILL BUY OUR UH REMOTE ALREADY HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTES 
SO WE CAN KEEP THAT IN MIND 
W WELL IT'S A ONE IT'S A NEW REMOTE AND YOU DON'T BUY A REMOTE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO UH TO CONTROL WITH IT 
YEAH ALRIGHT BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH WE COULD USE ANOTHER FORM OR SHAPE OR COLOUR THAT KIND OF THINGS

NO IT LOOKS GREAT 
JUST SAVE IT 
OH GREAT 
IT'S GOOD FOR GROUP SPIRIT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
I THINK IT'S UM IT'S IMPORTANT TO UH LOOK AT UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS OF OUR COMPETITORS 
GET THE GOOD POINTS UH TRY TO MERGE THEM INTO UNI UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL 
IN OUR CORPORATE SITE I SAW UH A NEW D. V. D. PLAYER UH WE'RE GONNA PRODUCE 
MAYBE IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT COMPATIBLE WITH THE D. V. D. PLAYER 
SO YOU CAN UH IS YOUR TELEVISION AND YOUR D. V. D. PLAYER WITH THE SAME UH REMOTE CONTROL 
FURTHERMORE IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT UH ACCEPTABLE FOR THE WHOLE WORLD FOR DIFFERENT CULTURES MAYBE BECAUSE WE WANT TO WE WANT TO WELL FIFTY MILLION 
YEAH YEAH AS A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
MM-HMM 
RIGHT 
MAYBE WE COULD MAKE ONE BUTTON TO SWITCH BETWEEN D. V. D. PLAYER AND T. V. AND MAKE THE OTHER BUTTONS UH MULTI FUNCTIONAL OR SOMETHING 
YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH SO BUT TH THAT'S KIND KIND OF STANDARD T. TELEVISION SO IT ALSO WORKS ON THAT 
YEAH BUT 
WE NEED TO TO KEEP IT CONSISTENT WITH THEIR D UH 
YEAH BUT IT'S IT HAS TO BE USEABLE

IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO BOXY YOU KNOW 
IT'S 
NO NO NO 
YEAH 
YEAH IT SHOULD BE 
RIGHT MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THESE ARE AND THEN A BUTTON HERE TO SWITCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS LIKE D. V. D. PLAYER AND SO YOU CAN I'VE 
YEAH RIGHT AND I DO THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS KIND OF IDEA 
WITH THE WITH THE NUMBERS AND 
RIGHT 
BUT IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO TO M MAKE IT 
AP APPARENT THAT THERE ARE TWO FUNCTIONS FOR EVERY BUTTON 
SO THERE HAS TO BE SOME SPACE BETWEEN THE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT AND MAYBE WE SHOULD USE COLOURS 
YEAH 
THAT'S KINDA TRENDY 
YEAH RIGHT 
RIGHT 
BUT 
I THINK IT'S UH IT'S IMPORTANT TO UH NOTATE ALL THE THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE SO WE 
YEAH 
NO PROBLEM 
YEAH 
YEAH IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HEAVY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH IT'S UNIV YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEP

TO MAKE IT MORE TRENDY 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT PEOPLE OF OFTEN DON'T LIKE BRIGHT COLOURS OR SOMETHING

YEAH YEAH YEAH 
I WILL INVESTIGATE 
RIGHT 
IT'S 
YEAH YEAH YEAH JUST IF YOU START UP YOUR INTERNET EXPLORER 
YEAH

I THINK YOU HAVE PREPARED UH ALL THEIR UH 
UM WE'LL LOOK AT THE THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS WE UH I DUNNO 
YOU YOU ALSO HAVE UH RECEIVED THAT EMAIL THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS FROM OUR BOSSES 
OH I'VE RECEIVED A MAIL WITH UH SOME ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
AND I'LL HAVE A LOOK OF WELL I THINK WE SHOULD SHOW THEM BEFORE YOUR PRESENTATIONS BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY UH 
SMART UH TO UH TO INCLUDE SOME THINGS UH WE CAN'T BECAUSE OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS 
WELL UM THEN WE CAN MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT OUR REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS 
WE HAVE TO DEB WE HAVE TO DECIDE IT IN THIS MEETING WHAT ARE FUNCTION WILL BE 
AND THEN UH WE CAN DISCUSS UH SOME MORE CLOSELY 
OH 
OH YEAH I THINK SO 
WELL UH THE CLOSING UH WE'LL NOT UH LOOK AT IT YET 
UM NOW I'LL LOOK AT SHOW THIS BOARD 
UM 
WELL UH NOTES FIRST MEETING 
NOW 
I GIVE A DISC A A PRESENTATION 
UH WE FAMILIARISED OURSELF WITH THE BOARDS AND THEN WE DISCUSSED SOME FIRST IDEAS 
SO 
WE SAID THAT UH 
WE HAVE TO MERGE THE STRONG POINTS FROM OUR UH COMPETITORS AND UH LOOK AT THEIR UH REMOTE CONTROLS 
WE SHOULD MAKE IT UH COMPATIBLE WITH OUR NEW D. V. D. AND OTHER RELEASES WE HAVE OUR TECHNICAL RELEASES 
UH NOT TOO MANY NO BUTTONS 
NO RECOGNISABLE BUTTON ON THE MIDDLE WHERE YOU DO THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS WITH 
AND UM WELL THEY CAN HAVE TWO FUNCTIONS BECAUSE UH YOU HAVE A D. V. D. AND A TELEVISION 
UM THE DESIGN HAS TO FIT THE HAND BE ORIGINAL BUT ALSO BE FAMILIAR 
IT'S UH ONE OF OUR IDEAS 
YEAH WELL THAT W IT'S JUST THIRTY MINUTES AGO SO IT'S NOT QUITE UH BUT WELL I HAVE TO DO IT 
THE MATERIALS UH WELL SHOULD BE HARD PLASTIC WITH RUBBER FRAME AND UH WELL THE LABELLING OF THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE INDESTRUCTIBLE 
IT SHOULD BE UH RECOGNISABLE AT ALL TIMES 
YES 
WELL FRONTS WERE TO BE JUST LIKE MOBILE TELEPHONES 
AND UH THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS UM AND ALSO LABELLING OF THE BUTTONS THE FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL STANDARDS 
WELL THAT'S JUST UH SOME IDEAS FROM THE FIRST MEETING 
IT'S QUITE LOGICAL AL ALL OF IT 
UM NOW THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS I'LL JUST SHOW THEM 
I GOT THIS EMAIL 
FROM UH OUR BOSSES 
WELL TELETEXT GOES OUT 
WE WILL NOT USE TELETEXT 
MAYBE A NEW SORT OF THING BUT NO BUT NOT TELETEXT 
WELL 
THE SECOND IS A BIT 
SH PITY BECAUSE WE JUST SAID WE WANTED TO DO INCLUDE THE D. V. D. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE OF OUR TIME WE HAVE FOR THIS PROJECT 
SO THAT'S A SHAME BECAUSE UH ESPECIALLY FOR THE THIRD REQUIREMENT WE WANT TO REACH PEOPLE UNDER THE THIRTY YEARS 
BECAUSE UH WE DON'T HAVE THOSE CUSTOMERS A LOT TO THE AT THIS POINT 
UM WELL IT'S A BIT PITY BECAUSE IT'S JUST THOSE PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL FOR ALL THESE TECHNICAL DEVICES THEY CAN UH REACH IT 
YEAH 
WELL AND UH OUR CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD STAY REC RECOGNISABLE IN OUR PRODUCTS 
SO UH WE HAVE TO UH SO UH MAYBE A SLOGAN MAYBE A COLOUR 
AND UM YEAH WELL UH IN OUR REMOTE CONTROLS THE DESIGN HAS TO BE UH WELL SO WE ALREADY USED A ACTUALLY UH FAMILIAR 
UH NOT ONLY JUST UH THE SHAPE BUT ALSO OUR COMPANY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YES 
I I UH NOTED UH OUR UH SLOGAN THAT WE HAVE OUR COMPANY 
IT'S UH WE MM PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
SO MAYBE THAT'S A SLOGAN WE CAN PUT UH SOMEWHERE IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL OR SOMETHING 
ALRIGHT THEN UM WE'RE GOING TO UH HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS 
YOU WANT TO START 
UH YOU HAVE TO START 
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT UH WHO HAD TO START 
WELL SO THEN START 
OKAY 
WELL UH 
YOU ALREADY UH OPENED UH POWERPOINT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WELL 
IT SHOULD ACTUALLY UH IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE LOOSE FROM THE TELEVISION BECAUSE IT CAN ALSO BE USED FOR OTHER TELEVISIONS 
SO IF YOU DELIVER A SMALL UH CLICK ON DEVICE THAT YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR TELEVISION THAT BLEEPS TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL EVERYONE CAN USE IT 
NO YOU CAN CLICK IT IN YOUR TELEVISION 
YEAH IN ANOTHER ROOM YEAH 
WELL YES 
YEAH 
WELL WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT IT YEAH 
YEP 
WELL THERE SHOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE A MENU BUT IT C CAN BE VERY SHORT 
YES OKAY 
WELL WE ARE A DESIGN TEAM WE CAN EASY TO SOME UH WRITER UH MAKE A MANUAL POINT 
SO 
WELL WE'LL HAVE A LOOK 
UM YES 
YEP 
WELL 
WELL WITH TWELVE EURO FIFTY AS PRODUCTION COST WE CAN'T UH AFFORD AN L. C. D. UH 
YEAH 
WELL YEAH WELL UH IT'S YOUR YOUR TASK TO UH LOOK INTO THE COSTS UH OF THIS UH NIGH I KNOW 
IT'S NOT YET A STANDARD UH DEVELOPMENT UH THIS IS 
WE SH 
YEAH ABSOLUTELY

YOU UH GET UH 
YES 
WELL GO AHEAD 
YEP 
F. FIVE 
F. FIVE 
CLICK 
YEP 
YEAH 
SO IT IS ALSO WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE A BUTTON THAT SAYS UH I'M NOW BUSY WITH A D. V. D. UH IF WE HAD DONE THAT 
AND A BUTTON FOR T. V. 
SO 
WELL BUT BUT IF YOU HAVE UM THE MOST USED BUTTONS ALL IN ONE PLACE AND YOU KEEP MAKING THE SAME UM WELL MOVES 
BUT IF YOU IF YOU WOULD PUT IT IT A DIFFERENT PLACE THEN YOU HAVE TO MOVE YOUR HANDS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT R. S. I. 
NO BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS M MAYBE YOU CAN JUST PUT THEM A BIT APART SO YOU WOULD 
REJECT R. R. S. I. R. S. I. 
YES I'VE SAW THAT ONE UM IN M MOBILE TELEPHONES THEY ALSO HAVE UH THESE BUTTONS 
WELL IT IT'S 
WELL ALSO I IF SOMEONE PUTS PICKS UP HIS UH REMOTE 
YEAH 
IF SOMEONE PUTS UP I UH PICKS UP HIS REMOTE AND UH PICKS UP TO UH HE TOUCHES THE SIDE THEN HE'S A ALREADY ON THE NEXT CHANNEL 
THAT'S VERY IRRITATING I THINK 
WELL 
NO 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S YOUR PART OF THE JOB 
YEP 
OKAY 
WELL WE UNDERSTAND 
WE UNDERSTAND 
OH RIGHT ONE 
NICE

MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I LIKE USER CENTRED 
YEAH 
WE ALSO DO THAT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL ABSOLUTELY BUT I TH THEY ALL HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT UM THE RECOGNITION FROM OUR COMPANY 
SO WE CANNOT JUST UH 
MAKE SOMEONE W 
NO BUT THAT'S THE THE SIDE THEY LIKE UH LIKE TO USE THE FRONT 
SO IF YOU IF YOU MAKE A A FRONT WITH JUST A A TIGER ON IT THEN UH OUR RECOGNITION IS TOTALLY GONE 
YEAH WE MUST 
YEAH WELL AND AND 
YES 
'KAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
OR THE THE THE THE LOWEST PART OF THE REMOTE ISN'T CHANGED BY THE FRONT 
THIS KIND OF THINGS 
YES 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
WELL WHAT IF WE UM I IT I AT HOME HAVE A REMOTE THAT HAS UM THE MOST FAMILIAR UH BUTTONS ON THE TOP 
AND THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE FRONT HAS A LITTLE CLIP 
A OF A LITTLE UH YOU CAN CLICK AWAY AND THEN YOU HAVE F MUCH MORE FUNCTIONS THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T SEE BUT IS SOME DA DA 
WELL BUT BECAUSE YOU SAY THEY OTHER FEATURES ARE IMPORTANT THEY WANT ME UM A LOT BUT NOT 
YEAH 
COMPETITORS 
YEAH 
WELL MAYBE WE WE COULD UH SO ON UM SOME UH CALCULATORS YOU HAVE LO THOSE LITTLE LITTLE L. C. D. TH THAT YOU CAN CLICK ON OR SOMETHING 
OR THAT YOU CAN CLICK UH TO UH OF THE REMOTE 
AND IF IF THAT'S GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF STA STATUS INFORMATION 
YEAH 
THIS KIND OF THINGS UH BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE THIS UH THIS PROGRAM RECOGNITION FOR YOUR V. V. C. R. S 
AND UH WELL IF YOU IF YOUR REMOTE PICKS THAT UP ALSO YOU THEY CAN DISPLAY WHICH PROGRAMME YOU'RE CURRENTLY WATCHING 
YEAH 
FOR EXAMPLE 
IT IT COULD BE SUCH A LITTLE UH TH THAT YOU CAN CLICK ON AND IT AND YOU AND YOU HAVE TO 
YEAH 
WELL MAYBE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
R. D. S. S OR SOMETHING 
WELL I THINK IT'S YOU GET IT JUST MEANS IT'S A SCRIPT THAT'S UH KEEPS IT UH ROLLING

WE'RE G NO BUT WE'RE WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT 
UM WE CAN USE THIS BOARD AGAIN I THINK 
UH WE CAN PUT SOME UM DECISIONS ABOUT UM THE CONTROLS WE WANT THE THE ISSUE 
WHERE IS MY PRESENTATION 
OH 
OH 
WELL 
I MEAN WE'RE ALL HERE NOW I THINK 
THIS I'VE ALREADY GIVEN YOU 
SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS 
SO WE WANT TO HAVE A SMALL L. C. D. SCREEN THAT'S SPECIAL 
YES 
YEAH 
THAT THING IS TERRIBLE 
OH 
WELL 
WELL I TH I THINK MIKE MIKE HAS A POINT 
BECAUSE UM WHEN WHEN UH WHEN I SEE A REMOTE I LI I HATE THE BUTTONS BUT BUTTONS AT THE AT THE BOTTOM 
SO AND AND I I LIKE TO USE THE ONES 
IN THE TOP 
SO WHEN I U WHEN I HAVE TO HAVE AN L. C. D. S SCR WINDOW 
YES BUT WE WE WE WE DON'T WANT THAT 
WE DON'T WANT THEM TO LOOK LIKE A CALCULATOR 
WE WANT TO LOOK AT LIKE OUR ORIGINAL BUT FAMILIAR 
YOU 
MAYBE A BIC UH BETTER UH WHAT UH W WHAT 
WIDTH 
OH FORMAT YEAH FORMAT 
LINE WIDTH 
WIDTH 
YEAH 
IT'S A BIT OFF 
WELL 
WELL UH LET'S UH TALK ABOUT THAT LATER UH 
IT'S SPECIAL PEN 
YEAH 
NO 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE AT THE BUTTON BOTTOM 
BOTTOM 
THE L. C. D. 
YEAH 
WELL BUT UH WHAT WHAT IF WE WE FIRST DECIDE THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AND THEN LOOK AT THE DESIGN 
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DECIDE THIS 
YEAH 
YES 
WELL WE HAVE A POWER BUTTON 
GUYS 
GUYS 
WE HAVE A POWER BUTTON SETTING BUTTONS L. C. D. WINDOW THE NUMBER BUTTONS 
OH 
YES 
UH THE MUTE BUTTON 
I UH LEAVE THAT ONE 
YES 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
WELL THAT'S THAT'S ALSO DESIGN 
YES 
UM 
WELL UH UH 
YES 
YES 
THEY ARE FOR SOME UH VIDEO UH 
PART 
SO PEOPLE HAVE TO MOVE THEIR HAND 
AND THEY GET LESS UH COMPLAINTS OF R. S. I. 
THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS DO BECAUSE ALL MY I IMPORTANT BUTTONS ARE THE SAME PLACE 
YES 
WELL NOT 
YES 
UH-HUH 
UP AND DOWN FAR APART FROM EACH OTHER 
WELL NOT TOO MUCH 
WELL FOR EXAMPLE THE POWER BUTTON YOU CAN IF SOMEONE IS CONSTANTLY Z ZAPPING 
IT'S NOT GOING TO MISS THAT IT THAT THE POWER BUTTON IS NOT RIGHT BESIDE IT 
BECAUSE I HAVE SOMEONE ABOUT THE BUTTONS IS WAY 
SO THAT ONE CAN BE PUT AWAY 
THE POWER BUTTON CAN UH B UH UH 
YES 
OH MAN FIVE MINUTES 
YEAH WELL FIVE MINUTES LEFT 
YEP 
UM HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT WITH THESE NUMBERS 
WELL I HAVE TO HERE 
YEAH WELL THAT'S GOING TO TAKE IT TOO MUCH TIME 
YES 
YES 
WELL THE L. C. D. 
UM YOU ARE INDUSTRIAL YOU ARE USER INTERFACE 
SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO GO TO MAKE 
BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE CONSENSUS WITH 
WELL 
WELL IT'S A BIT HARD BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE UH INDIVIDUALLY 
THAT'S A BIT UH 
YES 
YES IT IS 
WELL WHAT IF WE'RE GOING TO NOW DECIDE ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS AND THE DESIGN COMES INTO THE NEXT ROUND 
PLUS THE DO THE THE DESIGN ROUND IS STILL TO COME HUH 
ALRIGHT THESE FUNCTIONS 
THE NUMBER OF WELL YES THAT'S ALRIGHT 
W THE NUMBER FUNCTION 
ARE WE GOING TO UH DO IT LIKE UH ON MIKE'S SCREEN WITH UH ONE BUTTON THAT SAYS I'M GOING TO DO A T TWO NUMBER DIGITAL 
HOW DO YOU WANT TO TO DO THEN 
IT IT HAS TO R RECOGNISE ONE IS THERE COULD STILL COME MORE 
YES 
ALRIGHT SO ONE BUTTON FOR THAT 
OKAY UH ANYONE ANY UH THE OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES OF OUR UH REMOTE 
SO 
NO WE'D UH JUST SAID WE DIDN'T UH 
WELL UH 
UM WELL BECAUSE WE CAN'T INTEGRATE IT WITH ANY OTHER UH REMOTES ALL THESE BUTTONS ON THOSE PICTURES OR UH IRRELEVANT 
SO JUST FOR A TELEVISION SO THAT ALL WE NEED 
TELETEXT IS AGAIN 
SO ALL THESE BUTTONS THAT ARE ARE TO DO WITH TELETEXT UH SCREEN PLACING 
WE'LL HAVE UH THIS UH BUTTONS BUT UH 
AND UH THE TWO IMPORTANT ONES WE'RE L F FORGETTING 
UH THERE'S UM SCREEN 
YOU CAN MAKE IT WIDER AND LESS WIDE 
AND THE BUTTON THAT YOU CAN GO TO A. V. FOR YOUR VIDEO 
THESE TWO 
BUT IT'S JUST TWO AND WE MAKE A CLIP 
TH THAT'S A BIT UH WASTE 
YES 
OR AT THE TOP 
YOUR L. C. D. SCREEN IS GOING TO GO 
YES 
YEAH 
WELL I THINK THEY SHOULD IN IN IN AN ISOLATED PART OF THE REMOTE 
YES 
YES 
YES 
WELL ANY OTHER UH 
GO TO AVOID THAT'S ALWAYS ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
TO A. V. UH TO A. V. I. V. I. V. 
WELL L N N NOT TOO NOT TO MY REMOTE 
YEAH 
YES 
I DON'T 
I GO TO NINETY NINE 
TH THAT'S THE BUTTON UH NO 
NO YOU CAN CH PUSH ZERO 
YEAH 
YEAH I I THINK THAT ONE BUTTON IS UH I SEE IT UH 
YEAH 
THESE BUTTONS I DON'T HAVE BUTTONS FOR CHANNEL SETTING UH ESPECIALLY IN MY REMOTE 
IT'S IT'S INCORPORATED WITH UP UM PLUS AND DOWN UH THIS 
SO WE STILL HAVE AN UH FOUR 
CH CH 
OKAY 
UH THE OKAY BUTTON 
UH YOU ALWAYS HAVE ON THE CENTRE ONE OKAY BUTTON FOR YOUR MENU 
MENU BUTTON 
CHANNEL SETTING MENU 
WE HAVE TO GO 
OKAY 
SO UM SAVE 
YES SO 
YES I HAVE PUT IT IN 
HERE 
ALRIGHT 
GUYS 
WE'RE GOING TO UH GO TO OUR UH ROOMS AND UH WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE S THINGS IN OUR OWN I THINK 
SO 
WELL AS YOU UH W W WE HAVE LUNCHTIME BY THE WAY NOW UH SO UH 
LUNCH 
OH 
WE DIDN'T EXACTLY DO EVERYTHING BUT SO 
MM 
WELL YEAH 
NO 
OH 
WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES FOR THIS UH DISCUSSION 
ALRIGHT 
HUH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM NOW IT'S RIGHT 
IT'S MEANT TO BE EASILY WIPED OUT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
I I DISAGREE BUT UH IT'S NOT UH IT IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO DISAGREE I GUESS 
OH ALRIGHT 
YEAH WE ARE A REAL FASHIONABLE COMPANY 
I READ UH I READ IT IN THE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT COMPANY WE WERE BUT WE WE DESIGN UH ESPECIALLY TRENDY UH TRENDY TRENDY STUFF 
SO IT HAS TO BE UH A MODERN DESIGN 
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW UH WHEN YOU DESIGN A THING OF COURSE 
YEAH 
THE ORDER 
NO 
YOU CAN ZAP AWAY 
YEAH 
OH 
OH 
MM-HMM 
I THINK OUR UH USER UH EXPERT SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER MANUAL A MANUAL FOR THE REMOTE OF COURSE 
OH 
I DIDN'T READ IT 
OH ALRIGHT 
USERS TO UH ADD ONE 
DO YOU THINK 
MM-HMM 
YEAH ALRIGHT 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T USE IT 
ALRIGHT 
WELL MAYBE FOR THE IF YOU DON'T RECOGNISE A BUTTON WHO D WHO D WHO D I CALL UH WH WHEN I DON'T KNOW IT 
ISN'T IT PART OF THE OF THE U NO 
NO 
NEVER MIND 
CONSIDER THE UM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE 
YEAH 
WELL WE'LL UH CONSIDER IT UH 
WE'LL THINK ABO WE'LL THINK 
NO WE'LL LOOK WE'LL LOOK INTO THAT LATER 
ALRIGHT 
WE HAVE VERY DEMANDING CLIENTS 
YEAH YEAH ALRIGHT 
WELL WE'LL CONSIDER BOTH AND AND SO WHAT UH WHAT WHAT WE CAN FIND I THINK 
WE DON'T RULE THEM TO UH YET 
SHALL I GIVE A TECHNICAL TALK 
ALRIGHT 
WELL UH IT IS MY TASK TO UH EXPLAIN UH OR TO POINT TO A WORKING DESIGN 
WE HAVE THAT HERE 
OKAY HOW DO YOU ENLARGE IT IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE F. F. FIVE 
YEP 
WELL THE WORKING DESIGN THAT'S MY UH 
WELL ALRIGHT UH YOU KNOW WHO I UM AND WHAT I D 
SO UH WE HAVE THIS 
IT'S A BIT UH UNCLEAR BECAUSE I WANTED TO COPY PASTE SOMETHING 
IT WAS ORIGINALLY IN BLACK AND WHAT ABOUT IT BECAME BLACK AND PURPLE 
BUT I THINK YOU CAN READ IT 
UM WELL UM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UH FOR YOU TO REALISE THE BASIC FUNCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL 
UH WELL YOU CAN USE UH 
AND I THEN CAN SELECT I CAN SELECT ON THE DINGS IT GOES TO THE NEXT PAGE 
WELL YOU CAN READ IT IT'S NOT TOO DIFFICULT 
MEANWHILE THIS IS A SCHEMATIC UH UM VIEW OF UH HOW A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL WORKS 
YOU HAVE UH BASICALLY UH THE ENERGY THE POWER OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL UH AND THE SENDER 
W WHICH IS THE OLD TH TH TH TH TH TH TH TH THE BULB THAT SENDS THE THE INFRARED BEAM TO THE ONE AT THE SET 
AND UH THE SOURCE IS OF COURSE THE USER 
UH THE USER INTERFACE IS UM UH THE THE THE BUTTONS OF COURSE 
AND THE THE USER INTERFACE SENDS UH THE THE DIFFERENT SIGNALS OF THE DIFFERENT BUTTONS AT THE CHIP 
AND THE CHIP UH SENDS IT AT THE OLD AND THE LED SENDS IT AT THE RECEIVER 
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE BASIC IDEA 
VERY BASIC 
UM WELL I HAVE UH UH PUT IT IN A IN IN IN A A COUPLE OF BASIC STEPS 
UH THE REMOTE UH SO BASICALLY JUST WAITING FOR A USER TO PRESS A OKAY 
IT DOES NOTHING UNTIL UH OF COURSE UH THE KEY IS PRESSED 
THE KEY A SIGNAL TO A CHIP UH THE CHIP SENSES THE CONNECTION 
UH AND RECOGNISE THE OKAY 
AS WELL YOU UNDERSTAND 
THE CHIP UH PRODUCES MORSE CODE UM A SPECIFIC CODE TO INDICATE THAT SPECIFIC BUTTON THAT IS PRESSED OF COURSE 
AND IT USES TRANSISTORS IN THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL TO AMPLIFY AND TO SEND UH THAT SIGNAL AGAIN TO THE AT THE OLD 
WHICH IS THE BULB OF COURSE 
NOW THE LED PRODUCES AN INFRARED BEAM AND SIGNALS THE WELL IT'S UH VERY SIMPLE AND SIGNALS THE UH SIGNALS TO THE SENSOR ON THE T. V. SET 
AND THE T. V. SET UH ALSO RECOGNISES THE THE THE SIGNAL AND PERFORMS THE ASSIGNED TASK 
UH B YEAH BUT WE DON'T 
UH WE NO NO BUT YEAH 
EXACTLY 
UH WELL THIS IS UH THE BASIC UH FUNCTION OF A REMOTE 
I'VE SOME COUPLE OF PICTURES HERE 
IT'S A VERY BASIC ONE 
AND UH IF WE IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD AN UH IN UH L. C. D. SCREEN TO TO TO UH WON'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THIS BUT 
THIS IS VERY BASIC UH BASICALLY THE THE SHAPE OF UM OF A REMOTE CONTROL 
IT HAS UH VERY LITTLE BUTTONS AND BUT IT TO UH IT'S IT'S QUITE UM YEAH YOU CAN EASILY RECOGNISE THE BUTTONS 
THEY'RE UH FAIR ENOUGH APART AND AN ANYTHING 
IT'S NOT VERY UM 
UH NOT VERY HIGH TECH UH INDEED AND IT'S NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY 
UH IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHAPE IT'S UH JUST A SIMPLE LONG BOX UH SHAPE 
SO WE HAVE TO UH CHANGE A LITTLE BIT UH TO THAT UH SO THAT UH IT BECOMES MORE USER FRIENDLY 
AND THAT UH PROBLEMS LIKE UH R. S. I. AND UH THESE KINDS OF THING DON'T DON'T OC DON'T OCCUR 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BECAUSE THEY ARE THE THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS AND YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AND AND SEARCH FOR THEM 
WELL Y YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY UH EVERY BUTTON UNDER THE THUMB OF COURSE 
YEAH 
WELL 
BUT AN E IN ANY CASE THE THE BASIC FUNCTION SHOULD BE UH INDEED AND SO YOU SAY AT THE THUMB 
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND UH AND THAT THE LESS IMPORTANT UH BUTTONS LIKE THE THE THE DIFFERENT CHANNELS 
UH THE NUMBERS ON TWO THREE FOUR FIVE AS WELL SHOULD BE UH YEAH WELL NOT IN REACH BECAUSE UH THEY DON'T USE IT UH ALL THE TIME 
WELL IT'S UH PRETTY PRETTY BASICALLY UH SO YOU SAID 
AND I HAVE SOME PICTURES OF THE INSIDE WORKINGS BUT UH I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO TECHNICAL BECAUSE UH THAT'S NOT UH VERY UH USEFUL FOR YOU 
SO YEAH EXACTLY THIS IS UH HOW TO UH LOOKS FROM THE INSIDE 
AND UH WELL THAT'S ABOUT IT I THINK 
OH YEAH I STILL HAVE THIS 
UH I HAD TO DELETE THIS BUT I HAD TO MAKE A SCHEMATIC UH OF THE OF THE NEW BUT I HAD TO TO LITTLE TIME 
BUT UH DON'T UH 
DON'T LOOK AT IT PLEASE 
I I THINK IT'S IT'S CLEAR UH HOW IT WORKS 
ALRIGHT 
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
ALRIGHT 
OH 
RIGHT 
YEAH UH THERE ARE DIFFERENT UH WE HAVE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT HOME PAGES WITH DIFFERENT LINKS 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YOU CAN'T REALLY IS UH THE DIFFER FROM DIFFERENT SIDES 
BUT I THINK UH 
UH YOU CAN DRAW IT IF YOU YEAH 
WE CAN PUT IT IN THE ON THE BACK SIDE 
YEAH SO THAT YOU DON'T REPLACE THE SYMBOL YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MAKE UH CAN YOU PUT UH THAT PICTURE FROM UM IN THE ON THE WORD DOCUMENTS FILE 
NO MAP 
THE YOUNGER UH 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I THINK UH THE MOST FUNCTIONS UH UNDERNEATH THAT UH UH IN UM MM USUALLY 
BUT 
YEAH I THINK M MOST 
MOST UH 
MM-HMM 
OH 
YEAH 
OUR COMPETITOR 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO IT IT JUST SIGNALS THE THE DIFFERENT UH SIG UH THE DIFFERENT SYMBOLS ON THE SCREEN YOU HAVE 
UH BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE IT IS CHANNEL TWO YOU HAVE TWO ON THE SCREEN AND TWO IN YOUR IN YOUR UM IN YOUR L. C. D. SCREEN 
BUT SHOULD IT UH REALLY BE UH CLICKABLE UH OR OR JUST INTEGRATE INSIDE TO TRY TO MAKE IT D MORE TRENDY 
BUT THAT'S OF COURSE UH A BIT MORE UH EXPENSIVE THAN UH THE BASIC UH CALCULATOR DESIGN WITH THE SCROLLING TEXT AND THAT KIND OF THING 
ALRIGHT 
SHOULDN'T WE START WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS 
THE L. C. D. SCREEN ALRIGHT BUT WE SHOULD START WITH THE POWER BUTTON 
OH 
HUH 
AND THEN UH 
MAYBE WE SHOULD UH CENTRALISE THE DISCUSSION HERE 
I DUNNO WHAT UH YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT 
WE ARE BUSY WITH SOMETHING 
UH-HUH 
WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S BETTER TO THE BOTTOM 
BUT YOU JUST CAN PUT UH THE THE THE THE THE WHOLE INTERFACE A BIT DOWN SO THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR THE FOR THE INTERFACE 
UH-HUH 
AND AND WE CAN 
BOTTOM 
WELL THAT'S A BIT EXAGGERATED 
WELL I AGREE WITH YOU 
IT'S IT'S ALSO MORE RECOGNISABLE 
IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A CALCULATOR TO PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE THE L THE THE 
THE THING ON TOP 
YEAH W WELL BUT UH YOU DON'T HAVE TO THROW UH UM IMPORTANT ASPE IMPORTANT ASPECT LIKE FAMILIARITY UH COMPLETELY AWAY UH BECAUSE I THINK IT'S UH 
I THINK IT'S STILL IMPORTANT TO HAVE TO TO THE TOP BECAUSE IT'S UH 
IT'S MORE FAMILIAR THAT WAY 
A LITTLE A LITTLE BIT 
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ANOTHER PEN 
MAYBE THAT'S UH BETTER 
YOU E YOU ONLY HAVE AN OPEN FOR THAT SCREEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I I AGREE 
WELL I'M THE I I'M THE DESIGNER SO UM 
YEAH 
UH WE UH WE WERE BUSY WITH THAT 
OH YEAH WE SHOULD UH SUMMON THE THE DIFFERENT UH ASPECTS OF THE THING 
SO WE HAVE THE POWER BUTTON 
YEAH OF COURSE 
UH IT'S UH 
YEAH 
W WH 
WHILE YOU HAVE TO AGREE I CAN SAY IT'S LIKE THIS AND YOU MUST AGREE 
YEAH 
CHANNEL YEAH 
VOLUME CONTROL 
UM 
WELL LET'S LOOK AT YOUR UH DESIGN 
OH 
UH-HUH 
YEAH 
BUT THE THE ON THIS REMOTE TH THESE CONTROLS ARE FOR SOMETHING ELSE A D. V. D. PLAYER OR SOMETHING 
SO 
YEAH IT'S IT'S ALSO NOT GOOD TO COMPLETELY STAY IN IN POSITION CONSTANTLY WITH ONE HAND 
Y YEAH 
IT'S GOOD TO MOVE UH FROM TIME TO TIME 
YEAH 
NO BUT NOW YOU WE WOULD WE HAVE TO CHOOSE A 
WAY IN MIDDLE 
MM-HMM 
OH 
FOR PART 
I THINK YOU CAN HAVE THE TWO BUTTONS OF UP AND DOWN CLOSE TOGETHER 
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE UH HAVE TO HAVE VOLUME CONTROL AND AND ZAPPING BUTTON CLOSE TOGETHER 
YEAH 
C C CAN YOU MAKE YOU MAKE WE CAN USE UH THE DRAWING BOARD NOW I THINK 
UH IT IT DOESN'T WORK WELL BUT BUT IT IT WOULD BE PRETTY PRETTY UH NICE IF WE COULD JUST DRAW A SIMPLE THING 
MM 
ALRIGHT 
WELL UH YEAH I I STILL THINK IT'S IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT THOUGH IT UH TO HAVE TO TO THE TOP SO YEAH 
YOU SAY FAMILIARITY ISN'T IMPORTANT BUT 
YEAH D 
YEAH 
SO WE WE WE WE AGREED WE DO HAVE A L. C. D. 
SO THAT'S 
THAT'S ENOUGH 
YEAH 
THERE'S ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE ZERO 
UH LIKE THAT 
UM 
THEY'D RECOGNISE IT 
TH THAT'S THE MOST THAT THAT'S VERY EASY 
YEAH 
I THINK THESE ARE THE THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS 
BASIC FUNCTION 
OH YEAH 
UH JUST TWO JUST TWO UNDER UH UNDER UH 
I I THINK UH 
BUT YOU YOU CAN PUT UH TWO OR THREE BUTTONS UNDER UH ANOTHER SECTION 
OH THAT'S THAT'S TOO COMPLICATED 
YOU CAN JUST PUT IT SOMEWHERE THEY THEY AREN'T USED MUCH NOT AS MUCH SO THIS THERE IS YOU CAN PUT IT SOMEWHERE 
YEAH S BIT SMALLER AND AS WELL UH AND AND I THINK MORE AT THE BOTTOM 
YEAH 
YEAH OR AT THE TOP YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK UH THESE THESE BUTTONS 
ABOVE OR DOWN 
AND WE WHERE 
WELL WE DESIGN IT LATER 
WE HAVE TO AND WE DESIGN LATER WHERE EVERYTHING GOES 
YEAH 
THE THE VIDEO CHANNEL UH 
NO NO NOT ALWAYS 
ZE YEAH ZERO IS A DIFFERENT CHANNEL THAN UH THE THE VIDEO CHANNEL 
BUT IT'S EASY TO GO IF YOU ARE TO UH TO CHANNEL UH FIFTY FIVE AND YOU WANT TO UH GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE VIDEO CHANNEL 
YOU DO YOU HAVE TO PUSH A T TO GET BELOW ZERO 
IT'S MORE EASY TO GET TO UH WHERE THE SPECIFIC UH VIDEO CHANNEL BUTTON 
YEAH WELL UH D DIFFERENT SCREEN SETTINGS A YEAH SK YEAH Y Y Y Y YOU HAVE SCREEN WIDTH 
YEAH IT UH UH YEAH OF COURSE TO CONFIGURE THE PROGRAMME THE YEAH 
YEAH 
YOU SHOULD YEAH 
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT 
UH AND AND THE SETTINGS TO CHANGE THE BRIGHTNESS THE SETTINGS TO CHANGE THE BRIGHTNESS AND THE CONTRAST 
CHANNEL YEAH 
CHIEF 
CHIEF 
THE THE MAIN MENU BUTTON IS ALSO IMPORTANT 
THEN YOU CAN UH 
WHERE 
I DON'T USE IT 
UH MENU ALRIGHT 
IN THE MENU 
AND YOU CAN UH THEN ADJUST IT WITH THE ZAPPING BUTTONS OR SOMETHING 
BECAUSE UH THE ZAPPING BUTTONS AREN'T USED THEN IF YOU ARE IN THE MENU 
YEAH 
OR THE VOLUME YEAH 
YES CHIEF 
YEAH THIS IS THIS IS YOUR THING 
I AM HUNGRY 
SO YOU LATER MATE 
MM 
OH 
OH 
OH THAT'S A SHAME 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
I DON'T THINK 
YEAH 
YES YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND AND AND KNOW HOW TO HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK 
YEAH BUT NOBODY READS A MANUAL ABOUT A REMOTE CONTROL I THINK 
YEAH RIGHT 
IT SH IT SHOULD BE THERE THE MANUAL 
BUT BUT NOT TO EXPLAIN HOW THE REMOTE WORKS 
ONLY 
HMM 
NO 
I THINK THAT'S UH DIFFICULT TO REALISE ALSO 
ONE AND WE HAVE CUSTOMERS IN MULTIPLE UH COUNTRIES I THINK 
YEAH 
NO 
UH YOU GO 
YEAH GO AHEAD 
HIGH TECH 
YOU CAN ALSO LIKE 
YEAH I WAS THINKING YOU CAN 
OR SOME OF THE THE THE UM 
MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE FOR FOR CHANNEL CHANGING TWO LITTLE BUTTONS ON THE SIDE OF THE REMOTE SO YOU CAN JUST DO LIKE THIS 
LIKE SOME UH LITTLE UH GAMEBOY THINGS ARE SOME HMM 
WELL 
YEAH ALRIGHT BUT 
YEAH BUT IF YOU S SAY THEM UP AND DOWN THEY THEY'LL UNDERSTAND IT I THINK 
EIGHTY PER CENT WOULD 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH BUT 
MM 
WELL I THOUGHT UM EVERYBODY IN THE WEBSITE UH WOULD USE THE SAME THING BUT 
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE 
YEAH 
FOR INSTANCE YOU COULDN'T USE THIS 
UM 
YEAH 
WELL I'M MIKE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
THE THE METHOD 
WELL 
I SAID MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTES TOOK A GOOD L LIKE UH AT THE REMOTES ON THE CORPORATE WEBSITE WHICH ARE THESE TWO 
UM 
YES THESE ARE FROM FROM ANOTHER UH MANUFACTURER 
UM 
THIS ONE IS ENGINEERING CENTRED SO THIS ONE HAS THE MOST FUNCTIONS AND UM THINGS 
THIS ONE IS USER CENTRED 
UM 
I LIKE USER CENTR CENTRED UH UH ALSO THE BEST 
UM 
WELL I THOUGHT UH THAT WE UH REDUCE THE THE OPTION TO CONTROL THE D. V. D. ALSO AND TELETEXT AND THAT KIND OF STUFF 
UH SO I THOUGHT WE WE WE WOULD USE MORE OR AND MORE BUTTONS THAN THIS ONE 
BUT 
YES 
TH THAT'S WHY THIS MM IS NOT RELEVANT ANY MORE I FEEL 
UM 
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BUTTONS UH WE'LL NEED 
I AM I KINDA LIKE THE SHAPE 
I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT 
BUT 
NO I'VE WELL I SHOWED IT SOMEWHERE 
UM 
OH YEAH 
I THINK WE SHOULD GO FURTHER WITH THE IDEA OF A REMOVABLE FRONT 
SO WE CAN CAN UH YEAH CUSTOMISE THE 
MM 
YEAH 
IT'S A FRONT 
IT'S NOT THE THE WHOLE REMOTE THAT CHANGES OF COURSE 
YOU CAN 
MM 
OR YOU CAN YOU CAN CAN PUT THE SAME SYMBOL ON ON EVERY REMOTE 
SO L LIKE ERICSSON DOES VERY UH 
SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
IT'S RECOGNISABLE 
UM 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE YEAH 
YEAH 
UM WELL SO UH UH LIKE I SAID I THOUGHT WE'D WE'D USE MORE FUNCTION 
IF WE WE HAD TO INCLUDE MORE FUNCTIONS 
BUT WE DON'T 
SO UM 
YEAH 
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BUTTONS WE NEED 
MAYBE SOME LESS 
LIKE EJECT WE DON'T NEED AND SOME OTHER BUTTONS WE DON'T NEED 
I THINK UH 
YEAH I WILL 
I THINK UH FOR THE REMOTE UM UH LESS IS MORE 
THE LESS BUTTONS THE BETTER THE DESIGN 
UM 
WE SHOULD GO WITH THAT CONCEPT I THINK 
I KNOW 
MM 
YEAH BUT WHAT KIND OF FEATURES 
LIKE L. C. D. SCREENS AND VOICE RECOGNITION 
BUT I'VE 
YEAH THAT'S NICE 
YEAH WE SHOULD KEEP THAT SIMPLE TO 
IT WILL 
NO IT SHOULD BE UH INTEGRATED 
I THINK 
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE IN UM SOME RADIOS IN CAR 
YOU WHERE IT'S YEAH WALKING TO YEAH 
W YEAH 
YEAH WELL WE WE WE STILL NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH THAT WILL COST 
OR MAYBE YOU WILL GET THAT INFORMATION UH YEAH 
AT THE TOP OR AT THE BOTTOM 
YEAH BUT 
YEAH BUT WITH WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN ON THE TOP IT GETS A BIT UNNATURAL 
'CAUSE MOST REMOTES HAVE SOME SPACE LEFT AT THE BOTTOM 
YEAH NO MM 
UH WELL BECAUSE MOST UH REMOTES HAVE UM SOME SPACE LEFT AT THE BOTTOM AND THAT WAY YOU CAN KEEP THE SHAPE RECOGNISABLE FOR EVERYBODY 
I C 
WELL I D I THINK THAT'S THAT'S UGLY BUT 
I TH 
YEAH 
POWER BUTTON ALWAYS YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU YOU GOTTA ZAP LIKE THESE ARE YOU WANT TO YEAH 
YEAH YOU DON'T WANT YOU WANT UH YEAH IT IT IT MUST BE A REMOTE 
YEAH 
AT THE BOTTOM 
IN A FEW MINUTES UH YEAH UH YEAH I TOTALLY AGREE 
YEAH 
HE'S THE BOSS 
NO IT'S OUR JOB 
FOR ALL OF SO I THINK 
THE TEN NUMBERS 
YEAH 
VOLUME 
I THINK WE WE SHOULD USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS UM TO ME 
THE THE CHANNEL UP AND CHANNEL DOWN BUTTON 
YEAH IN CIRCLE YOU KNOW 
AND AND A VOLUME CONTROL ALSO ON IT 
YES SO I ALREADY SAID WE COULD DROP SOME OF THESE BUTTONS 
YEAH 
I THINK THIS SHOULD BE IN ONE BIG CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE 
YEAH BUT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN OTHER BUTTONS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE 
THEY THEY NEED TO BE CENTRED 
VOLUME HARDLY 
NO I DON'T THINK 
YEAH BUT 
YEAH BUT NO 
THE OTHER THE OTHER TWO UH FRUSTRATIONS OR FOR MORE IMPORTANT 
SO 
WELL THEY ARE USED FOUR TIMES AN HOUR SO 
POWER BU BUTTON SHOULD BE LEFT AT THE TOP 
MM 
YEAH 
WELL CONSENSUS UM WE WE CAN PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE SO 
ALRIGHT 
NO 
WELL JUST WHEN YOU PUSH A ONE ONE AND 
NO IF YOU IN MOST T. V. S IF YOU UH PRESS TWO NUMBERS SHORTLY AFTER EACH OTHER DO IT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WE WE CAN MAKE MAKE UH A LITTLE ROW OF LIKE FOUR BUTTONS DOWN HERE 
OR IT YEAH ALRIGHT THEN 
UH THEY CAN BE SMALL OR ROUND LIKE BUTTONS 
WHY GO TO VIDEO 
THAT'S JUST ZERO 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT YOU CAN CAN ZAP DOWN 
YES I THINK THE 
NO THEN YOU PRESS NINETY NINE 
I THINK GO TO AVOID S 
NO IRRELEVANT BUTTON BUT 
YEAH WELL Y YOU MUST HAVE 
YEAH Y YEAH YOU HAVE ONE ONE BUTTON FORM IS SET FREQUENCY O OR SOMETHING AND THEN WITH PLUS AND MIN MINUS YOU CAN UH ADJUST THE UH 
YEAH ALRIGHT 
I THINK THINGS LIKE UH CONTRAST AND BRIGHTNESS SHOULD BE UM IN THE MENU YEAH 
YEAH THE 
OR THE VOLUME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YOUR PEN 
I THOUGHT WE'D UH LAUNCH UH RIGHT NOW OR NOT 
YEAH LUNCH BREAK 
GREAT MAN 
WHO STARTS 
ALRIGHT GREAT 
ALRIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YES 
'KAY 
YEAH 
NO 
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE 
ALRIGHT 
'KAY 
ALRIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
BUT LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT 
IT'S JUST TIME CONSUMING SO WE UH HAVE TO GO ON 
YES 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I THINK I HAVE TO START 
OH NO NO PROBLEM 
I I JUST HAVE TO UH TO THINK WHICH FILE'S MINE 'CAUSE I WAS UH BUT IN A HURRY 
I THINK IT'S THIS ONE 
BUT I'M NOT SURE 
HMM 
YEAH 
SO 
RIGHT 
YES 
THIS IS IT 
WELL I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
UM TO START WITH THESE POINTS 
UH NEXT SHEET 
UM AT FIRST I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE DISLIKE ABOUT THE CURRENT UH CONTROLS BECAUSE IT'S UH A SMART THING TO EXCLUDE THOSE THINGS 
UH FURTHERMORE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHAT THEY DO LOOK AND WHAT THEY DO IS 
UM THEN I TELL SOMETHING ABOUT UM THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES 
SO WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THIS OTHER THING OTHER THINGS 
AND IN THE AND I'LL UM SHOW YOU OUR TARGET AUDIENCE OUR OUR TARGET PRODUCT USERS CUSTOMERS 
WELL UM THE FIRST FINDINGS ARE THAT PEOPLE UM 
THINK MOST CONTROLS ARE VERY KIND OF UG UGLY 
THAT'S SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE CURRENT USERS 
THEY DON'T LIKE IT SO WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT FRONTS ON THAT SECTION 
UM 
THEY ALSO SAY THAT'S ABOUT UH I THOUGHT IT WAS FIFTY PER CENT UH THAT MORE MONEY WILL BE SPENT ON UH BETTER LOOKING CONTROLS 
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DESIGN A A NICE LOOKING CONTROL 
UM THE CURRENT USER USES HIS MACHINE JUST ABOUT 
WELL ALL OF THE TIME FOR A FEW FUNCTIONS 
UH ALMOST EVERY USER USES TO DO THE THE CONTROL FOR JUST TEN PER CENT OF ITS CAPACITY 
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE THE BUTTONS FOR THE COMMON UH TASKS KIND OF BIG ARE KIND OF UH FLASHY 
FURTHERMORE IT'S UH SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE USERS UH ZAPS A LOT 
THIS IT MIGHT BE UH MIGHT BE SMART TO MAKE A A BIG UH ZAPPING BUTTON OR SOMETHING ON THE MIDDLE SO YOU CAN REACH IT WITH YOUR THUMB 
YEAH YEAH RIGHT 
RIGHT 
A LOT OF LOSERS UM USERS LOSE THEIR CONTROLS IN THERE IN THEIR LIVING ROOM 
SO IT MIGHT BE SENSIBLE TO MAKE SOME KIND OF A BUTTON ON YOUR TELEVISION 
THAT'S YOUR UM YOUR CONTROL BEEPS OR SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN FIND THIS VERY EASILY 
I DUNNO MAYBE THAT'S AN IDEA 
'CAUSE IT'S UH A BIG I THINK FIFTY PER CENT OF THE USERS LOSES HIS ITS CONTROL WITHIN THE SAME ROOM 
SO 
YEAH BUT WHAT IF YOU LOSE YOUR CLICK ON DEVICE 
YEAH BUT IF SOMEONE D SOMEBODY ELSE USES IT IN ONE OTHER ROOM OR SOMETHING 
NO BUT IT IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS IT'S UH THE THE CONTROL IS LOST IN THE SAME ROOM 
SO 
WELL A BEEPING DEVICE WOULD BE UH FURTHERMORE THE LEARNING TIME AS A PROBLEM 
UH THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR PER CENT UM THINKS IT'S IT'S IT UH TOO DIFFICULT TO LEARN 
SO THE THE LEARNING CURVE SHOULD BE VERY SHORT UH FOR THE DUMBEST PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT 
YEAH BUT PEOPLE DON'T READ MANUALS 
NO 
I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT MORE TIME IN THE ON THE DESIGN OF UH PICK UP AND SO THEN A MANUAL 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
AND IT SHOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH CONSISTENT WITH OLDER REMOTES 
ALRIGHT 
AND WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME 
SO IT'S BETTER TO UH PUT OUR ATTENTION TO THE THE DESIGN 
SO YOU CAN PICK UP AND SO IT THEN I THINK 
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT 
NEXT POINT 
UM R. S. I. 
WELL THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT I THOUGHT 
BUT UH THE DESIGNER SHOULD UH TAKE IT UH SHOULD UH WIE ZEG IK DAT 
YEAH CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF USING YOUR REMOTE 
IT SHOULD BE A GOOD IN YOUR HAND 
RIGHT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART 
UM WE'RE LIKE THE REQUIREMENTS SAID WE'RE GONNA SPECIFY IF WE'RE GONNA TARGET A YOUNGER AUDIENCE 
UM THAT'S ABOUT SIXTY PER CENT OF THE MARKET SO IT'S UH QUITE IMPORTANT 
UM RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THEY LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE L. C. D. SCREEN IN THERE IN THEIR UH ZAPPING UH DEVICE 
OH 
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE AGE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY NINETY NINE PER CENT OF UH THE PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY HAVE THAT IN OUR UH DESIGNS 
YEAH BUT THEY THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT 
SO IF WE WANT TO SEE IF WE HAVE A BIG 
IF WE MAKE LOTS OF UH OF THE STUFF MAYBE WE CAN UH BUY IT VERY CHEAP I DUNNO 
WE HAVE TO UH 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT 
SO 
RIGHT 
AND UH ANOTHER THING IS UH SPEECH UH RECOGNITION 
THEY ALSO LIKE THAT BUT RESEARCH IS VERY UH COSTLY 
SO 
YEAH BUT 
IT IT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT FOR THE USUAL 
WELL I DO THINK L. C. D. IS MORE REACHABLE THAN THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
SO WE MIGHT CONSIDER L. C. D. SCREENS 
ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
UM I THINK THAT'S IT 
UM 
I THINK 
IT IS SENSIBLE 
TO U UH TO TAKE THIS TAKE THESE POINTS INTO THE NOTES 
SO YOU CAN RIGHT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
NEXT BUTTON 
OH RIGHT 
PURPLE 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
A BIT 
MAYBE YOU CAN SELECT IT 
SO IT UH INVERTS 
THE P THE WHOLE PICTURE 
NAH UH NEVER MIND 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
RIGHT 
CAN I SAY SOMETHING 
UM I HAVE A TABLE HERE BUT UH THE L THE RELEVANCE OF THE BUTTONS 
UH THE POWER BUTTON IS USED VERY MUCH CHANNEL SELECTION VOLUME AND TELETEXT 
WELL TELETEXT IS NOT AN OPTION IS THAT UH BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE UM THE POWER 
CHANNEL AND VOLUME BUTTONS UH NEAR TO THE THUMB SO YOU CAN'T HAVE R. S. A. UH CONSEQUENCES 
RIGHT 
MAKE THEM BIG MAKE THEM EASY TO UH TO PRESS 
RIGHT 
YEAH RIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
WE 
BUT 
YEAH 
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
AND 
BUT IS THAT IS THAT USEABLE 
DO PEOPLE UH WHEN THEY PICK UP A REMOTE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THAT 
IT'S A IF IT'S A NEW FEATURE YOU CAN MAKE MAKE A DOUBLE FEATURE L LIKE A BUTTON ON THE TOP AND UNDER IT 
YEAH HE FEELS IT IMMEDIATELY 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH 
RIGHT CONTINUE 
SORRY 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH IT'S CLEAR 
I DUNNO 
I THINK UH W 
BUT TWENTY MINUTES AGO 
LOSING TIME LOSING TIME 
YEAH RIGHT 
SO 
I DON'T THINK SO 
YEAH RIGHT 
THESE ARE ALREADY ON SO 
ALRIGHT OKAY 
WELL YEAH ME TOO 
MM 
BUT WE HAVE TO REJECT THAT BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENTS 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH 
BUT IT 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S A MOST 
WE MUST HAVE THAT 
WE CAN MAKE A SYMBOL OF THE COMPANY RIGHT HERE 
AND IF YOU PUT A FRONT ON IT THERE'S A HOLE ON THE FRONT 
SO THE SYMBOL'S ALWAYS ON YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
BUT LET'S NOT FOCUS ON THE FRONT 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH I AGREE 
I'VE I'VE GOT ANOTHER POINT 
UM THERE ARE TWO TARGET AUDI AUDIENCES AND WE'VE UH CHOOSE FOR THE YOUNGER ONE 
UM RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT UM IT'S A HIGH INTERESTED UH IN FEATURES 
THEY ARE HIGH HIGH INTERESTED IN FUTURE 
BUT THEY ARE MORE CRITICAL 
F YEAH CRITICAL 
SO THE YOUNGER AUDIENCE 
SO WE MUST UM MOST DESIGN UH A CONTROL THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE PEOPLE 
MM-HMM 
CLIP AREN'T USED MUCH 
YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH BUT YEAH 
HERE LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS 
THE NEWEST FEATURES OR LIKE I SAID OR UH L. C. D. AND UH SPEECH UH CONTROL 
OUR AUDIENCE THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY LIKE THIS UH FEATURES 
YOU SEE 
SO WE MUST BUILD IN SOMETHING OR THEY WILL IT UH GO TO THE CONCURRENT 
THE CONCURRENT 
COMPETITORS RIGHT 
SO I DO THINK WE HAVE TO UH HAVE SOME FEATURES 
EVEN THOUGH THEY COST A LITTLE MORE 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
LIKE A TICKER TAPE 
WHICH PROGRAMME YOU ARE L WATCHING OR SOMETHING 
YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH RIGHT 
NO NOT CLICKABLE 
NAH NO NO NO 
YEAH JUST TO TO THE TOP 
SO WHEN YOU SEE YOU SET LIKE THIS YOU CAN CAN WATCH 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE AT THE TOP 
YEAH RIGHT 
IT'S A TICKER TAPE IDEA 
WELL IT'S JUST ONE SCRIPT 
YEAH FIVE MINUTES OF JA JA FOR PROGRAMMING 
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE 
ALRIGHT WE GO WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
'KAY 
RIGHT I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN FIND THAT BUT 
NEXT TIME 
YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
WE SHOULD HAVE A GENERAL IDEA OF HOW IT'S GONNA LOOK 
RIGHT 
AT THE TOP 
I THINK THE TOP IS MORE UH 
WHEN YOU SEE HOW DO YOU ZAP 
YOU JUST SIT ON YOUR CHAIR 
WITH THE REMOTE 
YEAH BUT THAT'S WHERE YOUR HAND BALL MIGHT BE 
YEAH I DUNNO 
WE'LL DRAW TWO AND THEN WE'LL SEE UH 
NO UM HE THINKS YEAH RIGHT 
HE THINKS IT'S BETTER TO PUT THE L. C. D. AT THE BOTTOM AND I THINK IT'S BETTER TO THE TOP 
BUT YOUR 
YEAH 
THE THE TICKER THE L. C. D. S LIKE LIKE SMALL 
IT'S IT'S WIDE 
IT'S NOT NOT HIGH 
BUT 
YEAH RIGHT 
BUT 
WE'RE MAKING A REMOTE WITH WITH A FEW FUNCTIONS YOU KNOW 
WE 
HIGH TECH 
WIDTH 
TH THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
WHEN I DRAW HERE TO UH 
HUH 
YEAH IT'S OFF 
IT IT NEEDS TO BE CALIBRATED AGAIN 
WELL 
WHERE 
ALRIGHT WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME 
UM 
I THINK WE HAVE UH A FEW FUNCTIONS AND WE CAN PUT UH THE L. C. D. ABOVE IT 
AND STILL HAVE LOTS OF ROOM AT THE BOTTOM WHERE YOU CAN PUT YOUR HAND 
AT THE BUT 
SO 
WE ARE TWO UH V. S. TWO 
RIGHT 
GREAT 
AND MOREOVER I THINK THAT YOU TWO SHOULD BE UH COME TO CONSENSUS ABOUT THE L. C. D. S 
IT'S UH YOUR IT'S YOUR JOB 
YEAH RIGHT 
ALRIGHT LET'S KEEP IT CONTROL 
MM 
RIGHT 
YOU SHOULD PUT THAT UH POWER BUTTON CHANNEL AND VOLUME SHOULD HAVE THE MOST UH IMPORTANCE 
YEAH BUT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT R. S. I. 
WAS IT KINDA TRUE 
WHEN WHEN YOU UH PUT THEM ALL IN THE SAME PLACE 
THE MOST USED BUTTONS YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING ALL THE TIME AND THAT'S JUST WHAT R. S. A. 'S ALL ABOUT 
SO IT MIGHT BE SMARTER TO PUT THEM A LITTLE MORE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER 
UM 
FREQUENCY OF UH BUTTON IS 
UM CHANNELS OR UH MOST UH USE MOST USED WITHIN THE HERE 
YOU CAN SEE 
SO THE THE CHANNEL UH CHANNEL BUTTONS SHOULD BE FOR FOR PART I THINK UP AND DOWN 
YOU THINKING UH ABOUT R. S. I. 
YOU LOOK AT UH LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY 
NO NOT TOO MUCH ABOUT 
NO NO NO NO I I TOTALLY AGREE 
BUT JUST 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
I AGREE 
AND SHOULD AND SHOULD BE RED 
RIGHT JUST MAKE SOME DECISIONS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE HAVE TO UH 
I DO THINK YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT CENTRAL NOW 
JUST UH YOU DECIDE THAT YOU DECIDE THAT AND READY 
YEAH 
NO 
WE'RE IN WE'RE DECIDING NOW IS 
TOP OR BOTTOM 
OKAY 
YEAH RIGHT 
OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
NO 
DO YOU STILL HAVE THE PICTURES OVER THERE 
YEAH THAT'S ABOUT IT 
YOU DO AND THE UH MULTI OR DID UH IN LIKE THIS ONE 
YOU DO NEED THEM 
YEAH I KNOW 
BUT ARE WE 
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT UH NEW OKAY 
RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S MOST USEABLE THIS WAY 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
I DO THINK WE HAVE TO PUT THAT UNDERNEATH A CLIP 
YEAH 
OKAY RIGHT 
WELL IF YOU YOU TAKE THIS THE IF YOU 
YEAH BUT YOU CAN Z YOU CAN ZAP T YOU CAN YOU CAN ZAP AT THE VIDEO CHANNEL FROM ZERO TO UH 
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU ZAP DOWN ZERO YOU GET TO A. V. 
UH UH WELL WHATEVER 
YEAH BUT IF WE'RE CHOOSING TO UH INCORPORATE THESE BUTTONS YOU HAVE TO HAVE UH CHANNEL SETTING IF YOU W IF YOU HAVE A NEW T. V. 
YOU HAVE TO SET THE CHANNELS 
RIGHT ALL THE THIS UH DIFFERENT BUTTONS YOU HAVE TO 
UH I D 
RIGHT 
THAT'S THE ONLY ONE WE PUT UH IN THERE 
FOR A SCREEN UH OF UH CHANNEL SETTING 
PROGRAMME RIGHT 
OH 
OH 
GREAT 
ALRIGHT 
OH 
OKAY 
GET INTO MY BELLY 
OKAY 
OH DEAR IS CLOSED 
WELL LET'S BEGIN 
BECAUSE IF WE HAVE AS MUCH TIME IS THE LAST UH MEETING WE'LL HAVE TO HURRY UP 
UM WELL I'LL START WITH THE PRESENTATION AGAIN THE AGENDA 
YOU 
SO 
UH THIS ONE I THINK 
OH YEAH 
WELL ALRIGHT 
UM WELL I'LL SHOW YOU THE NOTES 
IT'S NOT SO UH INTERESTING IS IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE WE JUST UH HAD THE MEETING BUT I'LL SHOW THEM 
WE'LL GET YOUR PRESENTATIONS AGAIN IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
UM 
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO DEC DECIDE ABOUT THE CONTROL THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS 
I'VE PUT A F UH A FILE IN THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT FOLDER WHICH SAYS EXACTLY UH WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS WE SHOULD TAKE 
SO THIS TIME WE EXACTLY KNOW WHAT TO DECIDE ABOUT 
AND THEN WE'LL CLOSE AGAIN 
OH 
WELL THESE ARE SOME EXAMPLES BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THEM LATER 
WE'LL FIRST LOOK AT YOUR UH PRESENTATIONS 
ALRIGHT 
WALTER WILL UH START AGAIN THIS TIME 
YOU 
'KAY 
'KAY 
LESS 
WELL YEAH 
L. C. D. AND OUR UH OUR FRONTS 
WELL EASY TO USE UH AS AS A BIT UH CONTRADICTIONARY WITH THE FIRST UH FUNCTIONAL IS NOT AN ISSUE AND THEN EASY TO USE 
WELL WE HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE OF THEM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
WE'LL WE'LL LOOK AT UH 
'KAY 
SO 
WELL 
YEAH WELL 
YEAH 
WELL THE THE HANDY THING ABOUT OUR FRONTS IS THAT WE CAN FOLLOW THESE TRENDS E EV EVERY YEAR 
TH THIS YEAR IT'S FRUITS BUT NEXT YEAR IT'S IT'S SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
YES 
YEP ALRIGHT 
WOOD IS POPULAR 
OH 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
NICE UH WILL SHOW US 
WELL MAYBE IT IT IT IS ABOUT IT DOESN'T LOOK STRONG 
SO MAYBE 
BUT WE STILL HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR PRICE OF COURSE 
BECAUSE UH IF WE WANT AN L. C. D. UH WINDOW ETCETERA UH 
YEAH 
YES 
SPORTS UH THEY'RE UH THAT UH ARE ACCESSIBLE ON ON YOUR L. C. D. UH WINDOW UH-HUH 
THAT'S NICE 
ALL THE RESULTS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
NO 
OH NO 
IT'S T TERRIBLE 
ALRIGHT 
HMM 
YEAH ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
AND IT'S AROUND 
WELL YOU CAN MAKE THE THE THE THAT MIDDLE RING CAN YOU YOU CAN MAKE ANOTHER COLOUR 
SO UH THIS KIND OF THINGS YOU CAN YOU CAN COMBINE 
NO IT ISN'T 
OKAY 
YES 
SO IF YOU IT 
WELL 
YOU YOU MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE UH SOME SOME COLOURED TITANIUM OR SOMETHING 
SO IT IT LOOKS PRETTY BUT IT FEELS STRONG 
NO TITANIUM 
WHAT DO YOU EXACTLY MEAN WITH DOUBLE CURVED 
DOUBLE CURVED 
IT IT MEAN YEAH WELL OKAY 
WELL 
THIS SOFT MATERIAL THING FROM UH YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
WE WILL TAKE THAT 
AND THEN UH MAKE 
OKAY 
OH 
THAT'S INTERESTING 
OKAY 
BUT YOU CAN ALSO SAY THAT WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING IT DOES SOME FUNCTION 
OH 
THAT'S A BIT UH 
YES 
I UNDERSTAND 
BUT IT HAS AN FUNCTIONALITY FOR OUR REMOTE AT ALL 
HMM 
SO YOU PUT A MENU ON THE L. C. D. 
OH 
BUT THEN WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE AN UH NO OKAY BUTTON 
JUST UH THERE IS ALREADY A BLANK 
YES 
SO YEAH 
NO UM NEXT YEAR THAT'S IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YES 
AND WHAT'S THE MENU BUTTON 
BUT HOW DID HOW DO YOU GET OUT OF THE MENU THEN 
YEAH 
MAYBE I YOU COULD J JUST DO AN AN EXIT WITH OKAY 
YES WELL BUT BEC BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUSH MENU YOU GET ONE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PUSH OKAY WHEN YOU GET IT A CHOICE 
AND 
WELL THAT'S ALSO THE OKAY BUTTON 
THAT'S YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE UH 
OR YOU CAN PUT IN THE L. C. D. 'S UH WINDOW AN OPTION GET IT 
EXIT 
WELL IT'S JUST A CHOICE 
HUH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL OKAY ALRIGHT 
UM THEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE DECISIONS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE 
I'D I AGREE 
FINE 
YEAH 
YES 
TOO BIG 
THEY'RE ALL BLACK 
HEY THAT ONE I LIKE 
NO 
THE REMOTE 
TERRIBLE 
IT'S IT'S ALL TOO MUCH BUTTONS 
TOO MANY BUTTONS 
THAT'S 
WELL THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE I THINK 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
HUH 
MM NO 
'KAY 
NO NOT VERY STRONG 
IT STILL HAS TO 
YES 
THE A A KIND OF BRIDGE 
SO IT F FALLS OVER THE HAND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I HAVE TO HIM A REMOTE WITH A BRIDGE 
IT'S JUST A HALF ROUND HALF HALF CIRCLE AT AND THEN IT FALLS EXACTLY OVER THE HAND AND THAT'S VERY NICE 
THAT'S IT FEELS COMFORTABLE 
YEAH 
YEAH ALRIGHT 
UM WHERE DID I PUT IT 
UM CONCEPTUAL PHASE I THINK THIS IS IT 
I GOT THIS FROM OUR FRIENDS 
SO UH YEAH THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
THESE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES WHICH WE HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT 
ALL THE THE MATERIALS FROM THE CASE UH THE ELECTRIC CABLE THAT'S ALL YOUR UH YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY 
UM 
YEAH 
UM NOW FROM THE USER INTERFACE YOUR UH PACKAGE 
UM WHERE N WELL THAT'S MORE LIKE THE BUTTONS WHERE THEY HAVE TO COME 
AND UM 
BE A BIT OF YEAH WELL A BIT OF UH DESIGN 
YES BUT WE HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THIS NOW 
AND UH THE TREND WATCHING 
SO SO YOU SAID FRUITY IS NO WELL SELLS GOOD 
WOW 
UH THESE THINGS 
OH YES 
UM SO IF WE UH GO THROUGH THEM 
YEAH WELL UH 
WHY SHOULD I UH 
YEAH 
SO 
WHAT WHAT KIND OF PROPERTIES SHOULD TO HAVE 
WELL WE JUST LISTENED 
YOU KNOW WHAT 
ALRIGHT 
I'VE UH 
TITANIUM BACK PLASTIC FRONT 
OKAY 
UM WELL I AM GOING TO PUT IT IN HERE UH BECAUSE WE CAN UH LIKE 
I AM SOLID FEEL AND TRENDY LOOK 
SO MATERIAL UM HARD PLASTIC FOR THE FRONT 
OKAY 
AND WELL THE THE ELECTRICAL CABLE IS JUST NORMAL UH 
IT'S UH FROM UH OUR COFFEE UH 
OF COURSE 
WELL UH ALL THE ALL THE INSIDE WORK OF OUR REMOTE IS UH STANDARD 
WORK 
SO 
THE CHIP IS NORMAL SILICON 
UH THE BUTTONS ARE NORMAL ETCETERA 
OKAY 
SO THAT'S JUST SAY 
UH WE DECIDE ABOUT THAT JUST BY LOOKING AT OUR COMPETITORS AND OUR EARLIER UH REMOTES 
THE CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION OF THE USER INTERFACE 
UM WELL WE HAVE OUR BEAUTIFUL DRAWING 
WELL YOU CAN PUT THAT ONE UH NOT THE SHARED FOLDER AND THEN I'LL PUT IT IN OUR END REPORT 
YES YOU CAN 
MM YEAH 
YOU CAN UH PUT SOME UH WHICH BUTTON IS WHAT 
OKAY 
UM THE TREND WATCHING 
INCLUDED THESE DAYS 
AND WHAT DO WE 
WE THING THAT FRUIT AND BRIGHT COLOURS OR 
YES 
WE CAN ALSO UH IMPLEMENT UM WE CAN ALSO IMPLEMENT FRONTS FROM UM MOVIES THAT ARE VERY HOT 
UH THIS KIND OF THINGS 
YEAH 
LAUNCH DIFFERENT LINES AT ONCE 
WE SHOULD NOT GIVE THEM THE UM THE MOST LOVELY FRONT 
WHEN THEY BUY IT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
YEAH 
COME ON 
WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE THIS FIFTY MILLION YEAH 
THE MOST UGLY 
TWO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
UM WELL THE BUTTONS ETCETERA WE GOT FROM MIKE 
UH THIS FRUIT AND BRIGHT COLOURS YEAH WELL I THINK WE'LL HAVE IT IN THE NEXT UH HALF AN HOUR 
WE'LL HAVE TO UH S S SPECIFY THE DIFFERENT UH TYPES WE WANT TO LAUNCH WHEN WE UH WILL INTRODUCE OUR REMOTE 
YES 
YES 
WELL I'LL HAVE TO BEFORE I GOT ANOTHER WARNING FOR FIVE MINUTES I'M GOING TO GET 
WHERE IS MY MOUSE 
UH WHERE IS MY MOUSE 
OH YEAH 
UM THIS IS IT 
WELL UM THIS WE HAVE 
UH BASIC STUFF 
INTERFACE WE HAVE 
SUPPLEMENTS L. C. D. 
MAYBE A A CHEAP VOICE RECORDING 
WELL YES 
ALRIGHT 
INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS 
INDUSTRY DESIGNER 
USER INTERFACE MIKE 
YOU'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER 
IN A PROTOTYPE DRAWING ON THE SMARTBOARD 
THAT'S WHAT I GOT UH IT HERE 
YES WELL WE'LL GET TO TO HEAR THAT I THINK 
BUT I THINK SO 
TH THEY'RE SAYING SMARTBOARD AND THAT'S IT 
THIS IS THE SMARTBOARD SO 
UM SO YOU CAN UH Y YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A PROTOTYPE AND YOU WELL THAT'S INCLUDES UH SPECIFYING THE BUTTONS ETCETERA 
YEAH 
SO YOU'LL GET IT IN YOUR UM IN YOUR LAPTOP 
UM WELL YOU WILL GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE UH IN THE PROJECT YEAH PROJECT EVALUATION 
SO UM 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO 
UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT PRODUCT EVALUATION EXACTLY MEANS BUT UH YOU'LL GET UH THE SPECIFICATIONS 
YEAH 
THAT'S WHY I UH 
BUT UH 
HOW LONG DO WE STILL HAVE 
YEAH 
WHY DOES 
UH F FUCK YOU 
HUH 
WE CAN'T GET 
TS IT DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE

SO WE'LL JUST HAVE THEM UH STANDING THERE 
NO 
IT'S A BIT UH ABOUT A PITY 
WELL WE STILL HAVE UH MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES 
UM 
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO 
I AS PROJECT MANAGER HA DON'T HAVE A COOL 
UH WE CAN UH DECIDE HOW WE IMPLEMENT THE FEELING FROM OUR COMPANY INTO THE REMOTE 
ALSO THE SLOGAN 
IN THE 
WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS 
IN THE TOP 
YEAH 
WELL IN IN IN THE RIGHT TOP CORNER 
AND WELL YOU C ON THE BACK YOU CAN PUT UH UH AT THE BOTTOM YOU CAN PUT THE LOGO WITH THE 
YEAH 
JUST JUST SMALL 
YEAH WELL 
CARVED INTO THE MATERIAL 
NO YOU YOU CAN CARVE IT INTO THE TITANIUM AT THE BACK 
WELL MANAGEMENT WOULD LIKE IT 
THE FRONT SIDE NO NO L IN SLOGAN 
SORRY 
YES SLOGAN FROM 
COMPANY 
IN THE BACK 
WITH LOGO AND 
LOGO ALSO ON 
THE FRONT BUT NOT EXCHANGE UH

ALRIGHT THAT'S DECIDED 
FIVE MINUTES LEFT 
IS A BIT OF TITANIUM BETWEEN 
THAT'S A BIT UH THAT THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY COOL 
NO 
YES 
I ALREADY HAVE UH ALL KINDS OF UH 
FILTH BETWEEN THE MOBILE 
YEAH 
ROUND FORMS 
YEP

WHAT 
SO ROUND WHERE 
OH YEAH 
YES THAT ALSO SOUNDS UH PRETTY UH NOT 
WE WANT IT 
AND IT'S ONLY OF TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
COME ON 
NO THAT'S NOTHING 
THE PHILLIPS REMOTE UH COSTS MORE 
WELL UH YOU TWO ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER 
YOU'LL GET YOUR UH SPECIFICATIONS ON YOUR UH LAPTOP AND THEN UH YOU UH 
WELL I THINK WE CAN I JUST IT'S 
YEAH O 
OH 
UH WE HAVE A ONE 
SO YOU CAN UH DRAW A YEAH 
WELL I'LL GET A I'LL GET THE MESSAGE

OR GET YOUR MOUSE 
BECAUSE IT'S LITTLE BIT UH HARD TO WORK WITH THIS UH PLATES 
I ALWAYS HAVE A MOUSE NEXT TO MY LAPTOP 
I HATE THESE 
UGH 
AND IN YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
SO WE PUT A TOUCH PAD ON IT AND SAY UH UH 
YEAH 
WE KNOW YOU'LL YOU'LL YOU'LL HATE IT BUT 
BUT THEY DO WANT SOME GADGETS 
SO THAT'S WHA WHAT WE'RE DOING 
WELL WE WON'T 
OUR BOSSES WILL BE RICH 
WELL THAT'S NOT BAD IS IT 
MM 
SO 
OH 
UH HE'S TOTALLY OFF AGAIN 
WELL 
BUT WHEN I START HERE 
IT'S HERE 
SO SO IT 
NOPE 
YEAH 
LET'S GO 
FINISH THE MEETING NOW 
ALRIGHT NOW WE KNOW WHAT TO DO IS 
UM 
MESSAGE 
NO GET AWAY 
UM I I'M NOT SURE 
MAYBE YOU YEAH 
WELL YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK ON THIS ONE 
YEAH 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
WELL 
GOOD LUCK 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
ALRIGHT 
EASY TO USE 
I THINK THAT'S YOUR IT 
MM 
Y YEAH 
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN MAKE A VERY COMPLICATED UH UH REMOTE ANYWAY SO SO IF SO IT'S NOT A VERY COMP COMPLICATED DEVICE 
ALRIGHT 
UH YOU THINK 
MM 
MM 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH AMONG THE OLD PEOPLE YEAH 
RIGHT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE COMPONENTS DESIGN 
UH AGAIN I HAVE UH PUT UP THE SPECIFICATION PROPERTIES 
THIS UH SO UM UH THE DIFFERENT UH COMPONENTS OF THE OF OF THE DEVICE 
AND THE MATERIALS 
UM I HAVE HEARD SEVERAL THINGS SO I UH I'LL HAVE TO CHANGE THAT IN THE WAY 
BUT UH THE CASE 
UH I SUGGESTED UH IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING HARD PLASTIC 
BUT UH SO YOU INDICATED UH IT SHOULD BE STRONG 
IT SHOULD FEEL STRONG 
SO MAYBE PLASTIC IS NOT UH SUFFICIENT 
WE SHOULD MOVE TO UH SOMETHING 
WELL YEAH 
Y HARD PLASTIC I USE OF COURSE UH PRETTY PRETTY TOUGH BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A REALLY REALLY TOUGH LOOK 
SO 
YEAH 
ALSO YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BUT WE'LL RETURN TO THAT 
UH THE BUTTONS OF COURSE RUBBER I THINK EVERYONE AGREES 
AND ELECTRICAL CABLES COPPER IS ALL PRETTY BASIC STUFF 
THE CHIPS MADE OF SILICON I GUESS 
I THINK THAT'S THE BEST UH WAY TO DO IT 
AND INFRA INFRARED L LED IS UH JUST A SIMPLE BULB 
THEN I'VE UH HAD A FEW FINDINGS MADE A FEW FINDINGS 
UH THE TARGET AUDIENCE PRODUCT STYLE 
UM IT'S UH UM GENERALLY THE CASE THAT UH SENIOR AND WEALTHY PEOPLE ABOVE UH FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD UH LIKE 
SO YOU SAID UH PARTICULARLY THE TRADITIONAL MATERIALS AS SUCH AS WIDE AND MATERIALS SUCH AS THAT 
THEY ALSO LIKE STRAIGHTFORWARD SHAPES AND LUXURIOUS STYLE 
BUT OF COURSE THAT'S NOT OUR UH THINGS THIS 
SO THIS IS THINGS WE MUST NOT DO 
AND THEN WE HAVE UH YOUNG UH AND DYNAMIC UH PEOPLE WHICH IS OF COURSE OUR UH GROUP THE PEOPLE WE UM IT 
UM UNDER FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD 
UH THEY LIKE SOFT MATERIALS UH WITH PRIMARY COLOURS 
SOFT MATERIALS EASE OF COURSE UH AGAI AGAIN A BIT A CONTRADICTION WITH UH OUR UH MATERIAL CHOICE OF WHAT YOU SAID 
THAT UH IT SHOULD BE HARD ON AND AND AND AND STRONG LOOKING 
BUT THEY LIKE SOFT MATERIALS UH SO WE MIGHT UH WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT 
AND 
ALSO THEY LIKE CURVED ROUND SHAPES 
IS NOT UH TOO FORMAL LIKE LIKE UH THE OLDER PEOPLE WANT 
AND IF UH ALSO A FINDING BUT NOT VERY AP APPLICABLE HERE THAT SPORTS AND GAMING DEVICES SUCH AS UH 
DISCMANS FOR JOGGING AND THAT THIS KIND OF DEVICES GAMING DEVICES SHOULD DEFINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEVICE 
BUT UH SINCE WE DON'T HAVE A REALLY A SPORTS OR GAMING DEVICE SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT 
MM 
WELL I ALSO HAVE UM 
SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF UH STYLES SO YOU CAN GET A CLEAR PICTURE OF UH WHAT I MEAN 
UH THESE ARE THE BASIC UH OLDER OLDER PEOPLES' STUFF 
IT WAS NOT VERY UH INTERESTING UH VERY CLASSICAL LOOKING BUT THAT'S NO THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT 
WE HAVE THIS KIND OF THINGS 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY THEY ARE 
IT LOOKS LIKE WELL YOU KNOW UH YOU RECOGNISE THE SHAPES IT'S VERY PRIMARY COLOURS UH BRIGHT COLOURS AND UH ROUND SHAPES 
YOU ALSO UH SO UH THIS DEVICE IT'S NOT VERY ROUND AND FRUITY OF COURSE 
YEAH IT UH THAT'S TRUE 
AND UH WELL ROUND SHAPES PRIMARY COLOURS 
YOU CAN USE IT ALL HERE 
AND OF COURSE UH THIS FAMOUS DEVICE 
I THINK SO YOU KNOW SOMETHING UH SOME DEVICES LIKE THIS 
SO TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF UH 
THIS HAS A STRONG LOOK 
ALTHOUGH IT'S PLASTIC IT'S IT'S GREY TO TO TO GIVE IT RUN LIKE 
THAT'S UH 
YEAH 
WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE A 
WELL WE CAN'T REALLY MAKE A ROUND UH A ROUND REMOTE CONTROL 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY PRACTICAL BUT BUT UH IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO UH TO THINK ABOUT THE COLOUR 
BECAUSE IF WE MAKE IT GREY OR OR SILVERY LOOKING AT IT DOES MAKE IT A LOT MORE UH DOES MAKE IT LOOKING A LOT MORE STRONGER 
'CAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS AT IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY VERY STRONG BECAU BUT THIS IS PLASTIC AND AND THIS IT BUT 
THE FILE 
OH ALRIGHT 
WELL 
MM-HMM 
AND I THIN I HAVE SOME MORE FINDINGS 
UM UH ABOUT THE ENERGY ENERGY SOURCE OF THE OF THE DEVICE UH I UH SUGGEST UH THE BASIC BATTERY 
I UH GET SOME OTHER UM UH UH ENERGY SOURCES OF COURSE 
BUT SOLAR ENERGY IS NOT VERY PRACTICAL INSIDE A HOUSE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A HAVE A LOT OF UH SOON 
AND UH KINETIC AND AND AND DYNAMOS ARE ARE NOT VERY PRACTICAL I THINK 
FOR UH FOR A SIMPLE REMOTE THAT'S A BIT UH THAT'S A BIT UH 
THAT'S A BIT UH MUCH 
AND I ALSO SUGGEST UH AS A SHAPE UH A DOUBLE CURVED CASE 
UH THE DISADVANTAGE OF THAT THAT YOU CAN SEE IN TITANIUM 
THAT THAT'S THE INFORMATION I RECEIVED 
IF YOU USE THE CURVED CASE UH A CURVED CASE DOUBLE CURVED THEN YOU 
CAN'T USE TITANIUM 
NOW UH THIS UH TO GIVE IT A MORE MODERN LOOK 
AND UH NOW THE THE SHAPE YEAH A CURVED CASE 
UM YEAH I THINK UH SORT OF TRIANGLE SHAPED BOTTOM OR SOMETHING 
UH A MORE MODERN LOOK INTO PLAIN LONG BOX STYLE BUT 
I'LL DRAW IT BUT MAYBE LATER 
AND IT MAKES UH IT GIVES IT A MORE U USER FRIENDLY SHAPE THEN IF YOU HAVE UH 
UM ANYWAY 
UM OF USE UH FOR THE BUTTONS SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS 
NO UH OTHERWI UH IN UM DIFFICULT SCROLL THINGS ARE SOME UH THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT MAKES MORE COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE 
AND UH SO WE AGREED WE DON'T USE A SPEAKER OR A SENSOR OR UM UH SPEAK UH SPEECH UH CONTROLLED DEVICE 
BECAUSE IT MAKES IT ALSO MORE COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE 
BUT WE DO IS AN L. C. D. SCREEN SO WE UH WE DO HAVE TO CONSIDER UH IF WE HAVE TO USE A MORE ADVANCED CHIP 
WHICH IS MORE COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE 
BUT 
IT'S WORTH THE TROUBLE I THINK BECAUSE 
UH RUBBER IS A SOFT MATERIAL I GUESS 
UH SOFT ENOUGH 
SO THAT'S UH BASICALLY WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
OH YEAH I UNDERSTAND 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT IT IT'S IN NICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
THEY LIKE GADGETS 
YEAH 
IF IT'S CHEAP 
YEAH 
CAN YOU DRAW IT NOW IF HE CAN YOU DRAW IT NOW 
MM 
ALRIGHT 
BUTTON YEAH 
I SUGGEST A BANANA SHAPE 
BECAUSE OF THE FRUITY UH FASHION 
YELLOW AND 
YEAH ALRIGHT YEAH 
JUST A HUNCH 
THESE ARE THE THE CH THE CHANNEL BUTTONS OF COURSE 
AND THEN BELOW IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
ALRIGHT YEAH 
MM-HMM 
UH BY PE PRESSING THE MENU BUTTON AGAIN 
BY PRESSING THE MENU BUTTON AGAIN YOU GO UH IT 
IT'S USUAL THE THE THE IDEA KIND OF THE WAY IT WORKS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT YOU CAN MENU YOU CAN PRESS MENU AGAIN TO GET IT 
NO 
WHY WOULD YOU PUT IT UH THEN AND WHERE IS THE RECORDING UH THE MICROPHONE 
WHERE WOULD YOU PUT IT 
UH-HUH 
MICROPHONE YEAH 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND 
UH BUT UH WE COULD UH D D BUT IT'S PERHAPS MORE EXPENSIVE UH THE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OR SOMETHING 
ALRIGHT 
WELL YEAH YEAH YEAH 
I CAN LIVE WITH IT 
THEY DO THEY DON'T LIKE FRUITY ENOUGH 
THE YEAH THIS 
BUT IT DOESN'T UH THE 
YEAH OK YEAH 
BUT IT IT MUST NOT LIKE TOO CHILDISH OF COURSE HUH 
BUT IT YEAH 
NOT NOT TOO STRANGE 
NO 
EXOTIC YEAH 
WE HAVE TO YEAH YEAH 
I WILL DESIGN IT WE DESIGN IT LATER 
SO WE'LL GET OUT THAT LATER I GUESS 
THE SPECIFIC SHAPE 
THE 
OR SOURCES 
BUT UH WE SHOULD DECIDE NOW 
SO WE HAVE TO UH PUT IT IN IN UH DOCUMENT 
COPY PASTE UH THIS STORY INTO A NOT A WORD DOCUMENT AND THEN UH PUT THE ANSWERS AFTER THE SUBJECTS 
YEAH 
WELL WE HAVE TO DECIDE ALL THESE THINGS 
WE WE CAN UH OVERRIDE THEM 
WELL A CASE 
OH THAT'S ME 
UH I SUGGEST WELL WHAT DO I SUGGEST ACTUALLY 
UH S SOLID YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND 
YEAH 
SO WE HAVE TITANIUM 
YEAH BUT THE NON REMOVABLE ELEMENTS OF THE OF THE REMOTE IS NOT THE FRONT COULD BE TITANIUM TO GIVE THAT UH STRONG LOOK 
AND THEN THE FRONT IS MADE OF PLASTIC 
AND YOU CAN PUT THAT ONE AND OFF AND SWITCH IT 
NO BUT YOU HAVE TITANIUM OF COURSE 
UH YOU HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS 
AND OF COURSE YEAH YOU HAVE THE THE THE PLASTIC FRONT END 
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE TITANIUM 
YEAH OF COURSE BUT YEAH YOU HAVE TO MAKE A 
DECISION 
I GUESS SO 
UH TITANIUM I SH I THINK UH 
HUH 
WELL WELL THE 
ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES UH IT'S IT'S TOTALLY POSSIBLE TO MAKE AN ENTIRE UH UH UH TITANIUM IS AVAILABLE 
AND UH WE CAN UH MAKE UH AN ENTIRE REMOTE OUT OF IT IF WE WANT 
MM 
MM 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S A NICE TRADE OFF 
ALRIGHT 
YEAH FOR THE FRONT AND THEN TITANIUM FOR THE BACK 
FOR THE NON REMOVABLE UH PART 
WELL BUT 
THE TITAN TITANIUM ISN'T ISN'T V VERY YEAH I IT DOESN'T UH CURVES

RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL UM NAH THE METHOD UM WE WILL UM INCLUDE THE BUTTONS SO WE DISCUSSED UH EARLIER 
UM AN L. C. D. S SCREEN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED

YES WE WE SHOULD REALLY UH INCLUDE THAT ONE I THINK 
UM 
WELL SO I SAID UH EARLIER I THINK THE UH L. C. D. SCREEN SHOULD BE UH POSITIONED AT THE LOWER END OF THE REMOTE 
UM THE BUTTONS FOR SCREEN WIDTH AND GENERAL SETTINGS AND UH AND THAT KIND OF STUFF 
UM WE CAN ALSO DO LET THAT KIND OF FUNCTIONS UM BE SHOWN IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN UH INSTEAD OF UH EXTRA BUTTONS 
I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE AND YEAH WE WILL VERY USER WOULD LIKE THAT 
UM THE BUTTONS UM SHOULD BE POSITIONED UH POSITIONED THE SAME WAY SO THEY ARE IN A WELL CONVENTIONAL REMOTE I THINK 
FOR THE LEARNABILITY AND UH WELL TO KEEP IT RECOGNISABLE 
A VOICE RECOGNITION CAN BE UH IMPLEMENTED 
AND UH I DRAW AN EXAMPLE BUT IT DID NOT WORK QUITE THE WELL UH THE WAY I WANTED TO TO DO 
HMM 
WELL I HAVE THE I CAN DRAW IT AGAIN AND I KNOW WHAT I DID WRONG

UM 
UM WITH THE UH THE UP AND DOWN AND AND WELL BUTTONS AND THE 
WELL I WILL DRAW WHAT I HAD DRAWN ON THE SCREEN

UM I SHALL DRAW THIS 
IF IT UH WORKS 
MM SO HAVE I 
NAH 
WELL THIS LITTLE BUTTONS ARE A BIT DIFFICULT TO UH DRAW UH 
CORRECT 
YEAH JUST UH THE NUMBERS 
THIS THIS WILL BE BIGGER IN THE THE REAL DESIGN 
THIS MUST BE THE OKAY BUTTON USED TO UH INTERACT WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
AND WITH THIS YOU CAN UH YES GO TO THROUGH THE MENUS AND THAT CAN 
UM THE VIDEO BUTTON SHOULD BE UH AN APART BUTTON BECAUSE YOU WANT TO TO UH IT YEAH IT IS TOO FAST WITHIN ONE UH CLICK

WELL THEY THAT COULD BE ANYWHERE 
THAT'S VERY SMALL 
IT COULD BE UH DOWN HERE

YEAH 
WELL THE SPEAKER AND THE MICROPHONE I THINK ARE THE SAME UH LITTLE HOLE THINGY 
YEAH 
WELL I 
UM THERE ARE A ALL ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED IN IN COFFEE MACHINES SO THEY WON'T BE UH VERY EXPENSIVE 
BUT 
THIS IS MY SUGGESTED DESIGN 
UM YES 
AND UH I THINK SO YOU CAN USE IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN DOES LOOK BETTER UH AT THE LOWER END OR AT THE BOTTOM 
BUT

UH WE'LL BEGIN UH WITH THE FRONT 
WE HAVE OF COURSE UH THE THE ROUND SHAPE UH THE ROUND UH BASIC SHAPE 
UM WITH UH THE UPPER PART BEING THE FRONT 
THE SO THERE'S THIS PART UM WHICH IS MADE OF HARD PLASTIC THE FRONT 
AND UH WE'RE WE'RE USING DIFFERENT COLOURS 
OF COURSE FOR THE LUNCH WE USE THE BASIC UGLY COLOURS AND LATER WE'LL PUT IT UH MORE INTERESTING COVERS WITH DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND PICTURES AND EVERYTHING 
BUT BASICALLY DIFFERENT COLOURS BRIGHT COLOURS NOT BLACK TOO DARK 
FANCY COLOURS 
UM THEN WE HAVE UH THE LOWER PART 
OF THE OF THE DEVICE 
UH WHICH IS OF COURSE UM PART OF THE BACK ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT'S ALSO TITANIUM 
YOU CAN USE IT ALSO IN THE ON THE ON THE SIDE VIEW THAT ONLY THIS PART IS THE FRONT 
AND THE REST OF AT THE UNDER UH THE UNDER SIDE UH IF IT 
YEAH THE BACK SIDE AND THE LOWER PART OF THE FRONT IS OF COURSE TITANIUM MADE OF TITANIUM AND HAS THE TITANIUM COLOUR OF COURSE THE LOOK 
UM THEN WE HAVE UH ONE BACK IN THE FRONT UH THE LOGO ON THE UPPER CORNER 
UH WHICH IS UH MADE UH WHICH IS ALSO PART OF THE BACK PART OF THE TITANIUM UH TITANIUM PART 
YEAH 
IT'S A DOUBLE R. 
YEAH THE LOGO UH UH IT'S DIFFICULT TO DRAW SO SMALL BUT IT'S OR DOUBLE R. UH LOGO IS IN THERE 
UM SO THAT'S THE LOGO ON THE UPPER LEF UH RIGHT CORNER 
THEN WE HAVE THE BUTTONS 
UH IT'S DIFFICULT TO DRAW AGAIN THE LITTLE OVAL OR ROUND I THINK OVAL WILL BE BETTER FOR THE FOR THE IDEA FOR THE DIFFERENT UH CHANNEL BUTTONS 
SO UH VALUE IN THESE ARE HERE 
AND THEN WE HAVE THE UM 
THE UM 
YEAH THE THE CON THE THE THE YEAH THE T VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL CONTROLS UH IN THE MIDDLE HERE 
UM UM WITH KIND OF ARROW SHAPES WHICH MAKES IT ALSO A BIT MORE EXCITING THAN BASIC ROUND OR UM UH 
UH SQUARE BUTTONS 
AND ALSO HERE ARE THE TWO UH BUTTONS WE AGREED ON

OH NO WE UH THE OKAY BUTTON'S HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OF THE OPERATORS OF THE CHANNEL AND UH VOLUME UM CHANGERS 
AND THEN WE'VE HERE THE MENU BUTTON AND THE 
AND THE VIDEO BUTTON

WE HAVE THEN THE LOGO IN FRONT AND IN THE BACK 
MAYBE THAT'S TOO MUCH BUT YOU HAVE TO SAY UH SAY THAT IF YOU THINK THAT WAY 
AND THE COMPANY SLOGAN WE THOUGHT IN A KIND OF ARC SHAPE UH ABOVE THE LOGO 
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT AND 
UH AND UH BEFORE I FORGOT

AND YOU CAN RECORD IT UH USING YEAH THE THE THE BACK OF THE IF WE DEVICE 
WHY 
WELL IT FITS UH IT IT IT IT FITS THE HAND MEAN UH THE THE THE THE 
IN THE MIDDLE IN THE 
THAT'S THE QUESTION 
UH WELL YEAH

YEAH 
SO AND WE UH WE HAVE ANSWER NOW

I YEAH I THINK IT 
WELL L WELL LET'S START WITH THE BEGINNING JUST ONE BY ONE 
WELL I GUESS UH I THINK UH IT'S UH IT'S IT'S UM POINTED TOWARDS THE YOUTH OF COURSE 
UH IF YOU LOOK AT THE DESIGN AND AND THE COLOURS AND EVERYTHING 
THAT WAS OUR TARGET AUDIENCE OF COURSE 
BUT IT'S ALSO NOT COMPLETELY UM 
UH U UNACCEPTABLE FOR OLDER PEOPLE I GUESS 
UH IT'S IT'S NOT OF A DEVICE THAT 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S UH FOR OLDER PEOPLE IT'S IT'S MORE THAT CLASSICAL LOOK 
SO 
OH NO 
I THINK YEAH THEY LIKE BLACK OF COURSE 
BUT I THINK THEY'LL UH THEY THEY THINK UH THE THE TITANIUM LIKE IF IT IS ALSO UH I THINK IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR THEM 
SO I THINK WE BOTH UH HAVE UH CONSIDER CONSIDERED UH THE YOUTH AND ALSO A BIT OLDER PEOPLE 
SO I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD LOOKING AND NOT ONLY FOR YOUTH UH YOUNG PEOPLE 
YEAH THE FOURTEEN YEAH 
SO IT EASY TO TO CHANGE CHANNELS 
YEAH WELL I THINK SO 
I THINK IT'S UH S SAY SO HE CAN BE MADE 
OH 
SO I YEAH 
YOU HOW CAN YOU MAKE IT ANY EASIER 
YEAH HUGE IS A YEAH 
DO WE DO WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE UH THAT IS 
YEAH 
WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE DEVICE THAT BEEPS UH WHEN YOU LOST IT OR IS ABOUT UM UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
ARE WE TAKE TOO MUCH TIME 
YEAH VERY MUCH 
NO 
YEAH 
AND I THINK FANCY FEELING TO BECAUSE OF THE TITANIUM BACK 
YEAH 
AS WELL MAYBE TWO BECAUSE OF THE VOICE RECORDER 
IF 
YEAH 
ONE OR TWO 
YEAH 
FOUR 
WELL IT DOESN'T REALLY RESEMBLE ANY FRUIT UH THAT'S TRUE 
BUT BUT WE HAVE THE THE THE THE THE SPARKLY FRUITY COLOURS OF COURSE 
AND YOU CAN ALSO HAVE FRONT WITH UH WITH FRUIT ON IT 
I KNOW THINGS UH WERE GOING UH TOO SMOOTHLY 
THERE HAD TO BE SOME KIND OF TROUBLE ALONG THE WAY 
MY GOD 
THE WHAT 
THE 
YEAH WE TH THAT'S UH THAT'S A BIT AN OPTIONAL OPTION 
NO 
NO IDEA THE ONE 
YEAH 
NO 
UH WELL WE HAVE A BIT OF A PROBLEM I THINK 
BECAUSE UH 
THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH 
NO 
BECAUSE UH THAT UH Y BECAUSE MY INFORMATION SAYS IT 
HUH 
UH WELL YEAH I I READ SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT 
YEAH I I READ SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT IT WASN'T VERY CLEAR 
I D I DIDN'T IN INCLUDE IT IN MY REPORT 
SINGLE 
WELL YOU HAVE TO USE 
A CHIP 
SO 
WELL YOU HAVE TO USE THE ADVANCED CHIP IF YOU HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
BUT IF YOU HAVE A REGULAR CHIP YOU CAN'T HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
THAT THAT'S A FACT 
OH 
YEAH BUT IT'S ONLY IN HALF 
UH TO DO IT DOESN'T 
BUT WE DO THEN WE HAVE TO LOSE THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH I KNOW BUT THAT'S WHAT MY INFORMATION SAYS 
I D I DIDN'T UH PUT UH THE ADVANCED CHIP ON THERE FOR FUN 
YOU HAVE TO USE IT 
FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL UH AND WHAT DO THEY MEAN WITH CURVES UH AGAIN 
BECAUSE WE YOU HAVE UNCURVED 
YEAH 
WELL 
BUT WHAT WHAT DID WHAT DO NO SORRY ABOUT WHAT DO THEY MEAN WITH THE CURVES 
SO THE USE THIS A CURVE 
ONE CURVE 
YEAH THIS IS ACTUALLY TWO CURVES YEAH 
IT'S HOW YOU IT'S HOW YOU LOOK AT IT 
WELL THEN WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM I THINK 
W IT WE CAN NEVER GET UH BELOW THE TWELVE AND A HALF 
BUT UH I 
HEY BUT UH I THINK YOU'LL AGREE THAT UH THAT WE THAT NOW WE HAVE THIS UH SCREEN 
IT'S IT'S VERY UH NOT PRACTICAL TO UH TO CONSIDER THIS FEATURE WE HAVE DESIGNED THE ENTIRE THING 
WELL THAT'S PRETTY UH L 
NO NOT VERY PRACTICAL 
WELL 
BUT I'M NO I DON'T AGREE 
I THINK 
I THINK THE TITANIUM JUST UH PROVIDED THE THE TOUGH LOOK AND THE AND THE 
AND ALSO THE THE OLDER PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT BECAUSE OF THAT 
AND BECAUSE I ALRIGHT IT'S NOT OUR TARGET AUDIENCE BUT IT'S IT'S USEFUL IF IT'S UH IMPORTANT FOR OLD PEOPLE 
YEAH 
I THINK THE TITANIUM IS VERY IMPORTANT 
YEAH WE HAVE A PROBLEM YEAH 
W BUT YOU CAN BETTER YEAH DUMP THE L. C. D. SCREEN THEN 
WELL WHAT ELSE 
W I MEAN UH 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
I AGREE WITH THAT 
SO WE U WE USE UH 
UNFORTUNATELY 
UM 
TITANIUM COLOURED PLASTIC 
SO TITANIUM COLOURED PLASTIC FOR THE BACK 
YEAH THIS IS GOOD BUT IT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH 
SO WE HAVE TO USE THE DITCH THE TITANIUM I'M AFRAID 
WHAT DO WE WELL WHAT DO WE KNOW 
ALL WE WANT IS A AS A FANCY DESIGN BUT WE DON'T REALLY CONSIDER THE COSTS 
SO 
YEAH AL ALRIGHT YEAH 
BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT NOW 
SO 
SO 
TITANIUM GONE AND ADD PLASTIC 
AND IN PLASTIC TIMES TWO AND THEN WE UH OR THREE 
NO 
NO YEAH WELL UH SIX 
A LOT OF PLASTIC YEAH 
ONE TWO FOR THE TO MAKE IT CLEAR 
I WANT GOLD PLATING 
NO NO UM 
WE HAVE WE HAVE TO UH FULL 
WE WE UH NO NO NO BUT TH THAT'S NOT OF UM 
WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN DOUBLE CURVE IF YOU DON'T HAVE TITANIUM 
AND THAT WE DROPPED SO IT IT CAN BE DONE 
BUT IT'S PRETTY FUNNY 
WE WE DO WANT TO REACH 
TWELVE POINT FIVE 
BUT IT ISN'T BAD AT IT TO STAY AT ELEVEN 
WE GOT MORE SALARY IF WE MAKE IF CHEAPER THAN TWELVE UH TWELVE AND A HALF 
OBJECTION 
WELL I CAN'T GET AN SATISFACTION BUT UH I THINK IT'S UH WELL NO NO IF WE CONSIDER THE COSTS THEN THIS IS THE BEST YEAH 
ITS IT'S UH RIDICULOUS ACTUALLY BUT 
WHICH ISN'T VERY PRACTICAL BUT THAT'S THE WAY 
UH-HUH 
WELL UH THEY THEY DIDN'T THINK OF THE REQUIREMENTS 
IT'S THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE USER UH I GUESS 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT THEY BASE THAT IN IN THE USER SPECIFICATIONS 
IT WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER 
NO UH TO TO TO UH IT IS UH 
NO IT'S EITHER WAY AROUND 
THAT'S THE SMARTBOARD 
THAT'S THE DIGITAL PANEL 
THAT'S THAT'S THE SMART 
A TELEVI YEAH 
YEAH 
LEFT OR RIGHT 
WELL I DIDN'T SEE UH 
NO IT IT'S MUCH UM 
BUT UH YOU CAN UH I I SENT TO ABOUT THREE TIMES NOW 
UH A GREEN UH BOARD WITH UH CHALK IS MUCH MORE USEFUL THAN THAT THING 
THE SIMPLE UH SCH SCHOOL BOARD 
I I DIDN'T USE IT 
I WRITE THINGS DOWN BUT I DIDN'T IMPORT IT INTO MY LAPTOP 
THAT'S THE 
W BUT ALSO YOU YOU WRITE THINGS DOWN 
AND I YOU CAN ALSO BRING YOUR YOUR YOUR NOTE BLOCK 
SO WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE THE WHAT'S THE POINT OF IMPORTING IT INTO 
YEAH ALRIGHT 
FOR DRAWINGS BUT NOT FOR PERSONAL NOTES 
I THINK THAT'S NOT VERY 
UH I MEAN YOU CAN BRING YOUR PAPERWORK ALONG AND P WELL OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PAPER IF YOU'VE IF YOU'VE 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND 
BUT I THINK UH DO THIS OPTION IS ONLY USEFUL IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PAPERWORK

UM YEAH RIGHT 
CAN WE KEEP THEM 
WELL DID YOU REALLY UH 
DID YOU REALLY TAKE UH TAKE THIS IN ACCOUNT 
I HALF OF TIME I DIDN'T NOTICE THEY WERE THERE

BECAUSE THIS IS A REALISTIC ENVIRONMENT 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
BUT YEAH 
W WELL TH THAT'S JUST THE THE ENVIRONMENT THEY SET US UP F WITH 
SO 
WELL FOR DRAWING FOR DRAWINGS 
YEAH 
WELL 
NO

BUT IF WE YEAH 
WELL AND IF 
AND BUT WHAT IF UH MAYBE THIS THIS BOARD UH SMARTBOARD IS MALFUNCTIONING OR SOMEONE

LIKE YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR TELEPHONE 
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A SCREEN ON IT YOU WANNA LOOK AT YOUR SCREEN 
YEAH I AGREE ON THIS 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
THAT'S NOT UH THE POINT 
AND YOU MIGHT BE UH YOU MIGHT BE TARGET CUSTOMER 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
GREAT 
WELL THIS IS JUST A SHORT INTRO 
I'M GOING TO DO UH THE EVA EVALUATION 
THAT'S GONNA BE DONE AT THE END OF SEVEN POINT SKILL CRITERIA 
SO I MADE A I MADE A FEW QUESTIONS ON THE HAND OF UH UH THE IMPOR MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS AND TRENDS 
AND WE HAVE TO LOOK OF OUR UH OF OUR DEVICE UH IS WORKING CORRECTLY 
WELL I PUT SOME QUESTIONS ON A WORD FILE 
SO IF I CAN FIND THEM 
UH UH UH UH MM 
WELL 
I UH THANK YOU HAVE ALL SEEN UH THIS KIND OF EVALUATION IS UH I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT 
UH THE FIRST QUESTION IS UH IS THE DEVICE GOOD LOOKING 
BECAUSE NORMAL P UH MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT UM EARLIER DEVICES WERE UGLY UGLY 
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEM 
SO WHAT DO WE THINK 
YEAH 
NO I KNOW BUT I HAVE TO UH EVALUATE IT 
SO I HAVE TO TAKE THIS QUESTIONNAIRE 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT I CAN'T CAN SEE 
YEAH BUT UH YOU KNOW 
WE DIS WE DO WE DESIGNED IT TO BE PERFECT 
SO BUT WE HAVE TO BE CRITIC CRITICAL ABOUT IT 
AND I HAVE TO UH TAKE ALL THESE POINTS AND GET A AVERAGE AT THE END 
SO WE WE KNOW WHERE WE STAND 
'CAUSE THE THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE MIGHT HAVE UH BI MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN 
RIGHT SO 
RIGHT 
UH IS IT GOOD LOOKING 
THE TITANIUM MIGHT BE UH F 
FOR OLDER PEOPLE 
IT YOU PUT UH PUT A BLACK FRONT ON IT OR SOMETHING 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
RIGHT A NUMBER PLEASE 
SO THE LAST ONE IS SEVEN 
EASY TO CHANGE CHANNELS 
OH SORRY 
YEAH RIGHT 
CHANGE CHANNELS 
RIGHT 
THE POWER CHANNEL AND VOLUME BUTTONS ARE EASY ACCESSIBLE 
TWO 
ALRIGHT 
THE UH DEVICE IS EASY TO FIND IF YOU LOSE IT 
YEAH 
SIX 
RIGHT 
YEAH I AGREE 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
TWO 
YEAH YEAH I AGREE 
NO 
YEAH 
RIGHT R. R. S. I. SENSITIVE 
R. S. I. SENSITIVE 
FOUR 
UM 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S GREAT 
WELL WITH THE UH THERE 
NAH F FOR I THINK 
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS 
NO 
THREE ALRIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
BUT 
RIGHT 
THE AVERAGE WILL UH COME LATER 
IT HAS TO GO TO TWELVE RIGHT 
TWELVE AND A HALF 
IT 
THAT'S EASY 
KICK IT IT 
YEAH 
THE SPEAKER 
THAT'S SOME WRONG INFO MAN 
NO 
IT'S UH 
IT'S JUST EXTRA 
KICK IT IT 
WHAT MORE 
BATTERIES OR UH QUITE 
OH NO NO NO NO 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH WE NEED TO HAVE THE THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
NO 
YEAH BUT NO THAT'S NO IT'S NOT RELEVANT 
YEAH 
NO THEN THE WHOLE CONCEPT IS UH 
YOU 
YOU CAN MAKE YOU CAN MAKE IT CHEAPER 
BUT IF YOU DON'T SELL 
NO NO NO NO 
IF IF YOU MAKE PEOPLE BRAND AWARE THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE 
BUT 
BECAUSE WE WE USE A BRAND AT THE FRONT AND UH I DUN AT THE BACK 
IF YOU HAVE UH LOTS OF UH MARKETING 
PEOPLE MIGHT BUY 
IF YOU IF YOU MAKE IT COOL TO HAVE 
OH THAT'S JUST GREAT 
OH ALRIGHT 
THAT IS PRETTY STUPID 
YOU 
YEAH I AGREE 
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD DUMP THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
OR YOU SHOU IT'S R CHANGE THE TITANIUM OR DUMP THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
BUT I THINK YOU COULD BETTER CHANGE UH TITANIUM TOO HARD A HARD KIND OF PLASTIC LOOKING LIKE TITANIUM THEN ALSO THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE LOTS OF FUNCTIONS ON IT IT 
YEAH I AGREE 
SEAL 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY YOU CAN'T MAKE IT 
SO SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY YOU CAN'T MAKE IT 
SO THIS IS TOO EXPENSIVE 
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE IT CHEAPER 
RIGHT 
IT'S JUST FOR MINE 
YEAH RIGHT 
I WANT CHROME 
WELL TH THAT THAT IS THE PROBLEM 
YEAH 
SHIT 
YEAH 
YEAH ME TOO 
RIGHT 
LEADERSHIP 
WELL IT'S IT WAS VERY DEMOCRATIC 
YEAH YEAH 
WELL 
YEAH THINK SO IT 
YEAH I DON'T LIKE IT 
YEAH 
THIS THIS THIS ISN'T A SMARTBOARD RIGHT 
YEAH RIGHT 
BU BUT YOU THIS IS JUST A LARGE T LARGE TELEVISION 
YOU U YOU USE THE 
YEAH BUT YOU CA THIS IS JUST A BEAMER FUNCTION 
AND HERE IN THIS ONE YOU CAN UH DRAW THE PICTURES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
BUT 
THAT ONE 
THAT ONE ISN'T ACCURATE 
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK 
YOU CAN 
YEAH BUT I THINK THERE'S A BIG DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE THOSE TH I DON'T NEED A SMARTBOARD 
YEAH BUT GIVE ME A BEAMER 
THAT'S UH THAT'S MUCH UH MUCH CHEAPER 
RIGHT 
YEAH 
I AGREE 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT ISN'T PRACTICAL 
RIGHT 
YOUR NOTEPAD 
YEAH 
YEAH IT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR DRAWINGS 
I I AGREE ON THAT 
YEAH RIGHT 
THAT STEFAN USE 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
IT'S IT'S ONLY USEFUL IF YOU HAVE TO DRAW SOMETHING 
YEAH 
YEAH GREAT 
YEAH 
WIRELESS UH WIRELESS THINGS 
WELL THESE CHAIRS MAN 
REALLY GREAT 
COMMUNICATE IN BETWEEN 
YEAH RIGHT 
YEAH 
YEAH I AGREE 
WELL MORE MORE INFORMATION ON THE BEGINNING 
THAT'S 
FOR PEOPLE WHO UH SKETCH TH THE WHOLE DAY I CAN IMAGINE THAT IT'S USEFUL 
WELL 
YEAH I AGREE 
MOUSE IS JU JUST ISN'T WORKING IF YOU'RE SKETCHING 
YEAH BUT HE'S SAYING IF IT IS CORRECT AND YOU CAN DRAW VERY YEAH VERY PRECISE 
YEAH UM 
IT SAVES TIME 
CELEBRATION 
WELL 
YEAH 
YOU BETTER GET STARTED 
HUH 
OH ALRIGHT 
OH GREAT MAN 
I'M GONNA BUY ONE BY ONE FOR MY BEDROOM 
MAYBE YOU ARE BROKEN 
YOU KNOW 
I THINK SHE'S LISTENING 
I FEEL WATCHED 
YEAH 
DO THAT 
YEAH 
VERY CATCHING 
I'M SURE MANAGEMENT WOULD LIKE THAT 
OH THAT'S JUST GREAT 
SO WELCOME 
THE FIRST KICK OFF MEETING 
WHAT SHALL WE DO 
FIRST THE OPENING THEN THE REST 
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO 
WE UM HAVE TO MAKE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
IT HAS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY 
SO WE WILL GET BACK THE ON THAT 
FIRST WE HAVE TO MAKE A FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 
AFTER THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THEN AFTER THAT A DETAILED DESIGN 
SO WE'LL DISCUSS THAT LATER 
FIRST WE HAVE A LOOK AT 
SO FIRST TO WE HAVE TO MAKE A SMALL PAINTING 
WHAT HAVE DO WE HAVE TO DO 
FIRST YOU CAN SAVE THE DOCUMENTS 
WE HAVE TO DO THAT EVERY TIME WE MAKE SOMETHING 
YOU CAN PRINT OUT 
NO 
AND WE HAVE TO USE THE PEN AND THE ERASER 
SO NOW 
WE ALL HAVE TO USE THIS ONE 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR OWN FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
SO I'LL MAKE AN EXAMPLE 
FIRST DON'T TOUCH THAT THINGS 
YOU CAN USE THE PEN 
AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE UM 
SOMETHING 
UM YOU CAN CHANGE SOME THINGS 
UM FORMAT 
LINE AND 
CHANGE IT 
AND YOU CAN CHANGE THE 
COLOUR 
SO THAT'S IT 
SO 
SO AND AFTER IT YOU HAVE TO SAVE IT 
NOW WE CAN MAKE A NEW ONE 
YOU HAVE TO POINT NOW 
SO YOU'RE NEXT 
WHAT IS GOING ON 
WHAT ARE YOU WHAT 
UM 
IS A IT IS A IT IS A 
A DUCK 
YES 
BLANK YES 
OKAY NEXT ONE 
OH 
VERY GOOD 
OKAY 
VERY GOOD 
SO UM YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK 
SO 
THAT'S IT 
SO THAT WAS TWO 
NOW NEXT 
THE BUDGET 
THE B UH WE WILL SELL THE TO TO TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
AND WE HAVE ONLY TWENTY OF TWELVE AND A HALF EURO TO MAKE IT 
SO NOW WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WILL MAKE 
FIRST I WANNA HEAR FROM YOU 
UH WHAT ARE YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS 
SO 
F FIRST 
SO THIS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE THAT UH BIG BUTTONS 
POSITIVE 
OKAY 
WHAT ARE YOUR EXPERIENCES 
MM 
SO AND DO THEY ALWAYS HAVE THAT 
IT'S EASY TO YOU 
OKAY 
'KAY 
OKAY SO THEY HAVE TOO MUCH 
SO NEXT 
FOR OUR OWN REMOTE CONTROL WE HAVE TO THINK HOW DO WE MAKE IT 
SO WHAT DOES DO YOU HAVE FOR IT FOR THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL 
WHAT WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE 
NOT TOO HEAVY 
YES 
YEAH 
YES 
LIKE A PHONE 
OKAY 
SO THAT'S 
OKAY 
YES 
OKAY 
THIS IS IT HAS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER THINGS 
OKAY 
YES 
NO BATTERY SO 
SO MORE IDEAS 
NO OKAY 
IT'S ONLY THE FIRST IDEAS 
SO UH WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW IS NEXT MEETING IS IN HALF AN UH HERE 
OH 
OKAY 
NEXT MEETING HALF AN HOUR 
UM WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO 
WELL LIKE IN YOUR 
AND 
NEXT INSTRUCTIONS YOU'LL GET IN YOUR EMAIL 
SO 
THIS IS THE FIRST MEETING 
SO YOU LATER IN HALF AN HOUR 
NICE 
AN ELEPHANT 
'KAY 
POP UPS 
WHAT IS THIS PICTIONARY 
UH A BIRD 
BIRD 
YEAH 
WOAH 
UH NOT 
OH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
NO PROBLEM 
SHIT HAPPENS 
A PARROT 
SH 
UH DID IT BEFORE 
OH 
THANK YOU 
UH I WILL START 
UH BIG ONE THEY ARE UH NOT EASY TO USE 
UM I HAVE ONE SET AND UH A REMOTE CONTROL WHEN I DROPPED IT UH TO BREAK 
SO THAT WON'T BE UH OUR GOAL I THINK 
AND UH G BIG BUTTONS UM UH THAT'S EASIER TO USE THAN UH I THINK 
NOT ALL THE SMALL BUTTONS YOU DON'T KNOW 
BIG BUTTONS POSITIVE 
ALL ALL SMALL BUTTONS LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE UH LIKE A HUNDRED BUTTONS ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WORKING FOR 
THANK YOU 
HELP ALSO 
THANK YOU 
THE WEIGHT 
NOT NOT TOO HEAVY 
NOT MUCH BUTTONS 
BUST FREE 
THAT WHEN YOU DROP IT IT WON'T BREAK 
LIKE UH SOME KIND OF RUBBER ON IT 
OR HARD UH HARD PLASTIC 
UH BUTTONS NOT TOO SMALL 
UH SOMETHING LIKE WHEN YOU UH LOSE YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL SOMETIMES IT HAPPEN 
UH IT BETWEEN THE COUCH AND YOU CAN'T FIND OUT 
WHEN YOU PUSH A BIT A BUTTON ON THE T. V. THEN YOU HEAR SOME UH SOME SORT OF BLEEP 
AND THEN YOU UH HEY THERE THERE'S REMOTE CONTROL 
NEXT 
I HAVE ONE MORE IDEA 
JUST POPPED UP 
UH IT IT WON'T TAKE A LOT OF BATTERIES 
SO YOU DON'T WON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE BATTERIES UH ONCE A WEEK OR UH ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
HMM 
THAT'S UH STRONG 
YEAH 
OKAY 
LET'S TRY THIS 
OH 
UM 
MM-HMM 
MM 
OH 
NO NO 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH BLANK 
NO 
UH WELL I THINK THE THE THE GOAL OF A REMOTE CONTROL IS THAT IT'S IT IT HAS AN INFLUENCE ON THE T. V. SET 
AND THAT IT CONTROLS THE CHANNELS AND THE THE VOLUME 
AND UH I I I THINK IT'S POSITIVE IF THERE'S A A LED UH UH A LED ON THE CORNER OF THE OF THE REMOTE 
SO THAT YOU KNOW IT IS IT STILL HAS BATTERIES IN IT ON IT 
AND THAT IF YOU PUSH THE BUTTON THE OLD UH GIVES A LIGHT AND UH AND YOU SEE THAT IT'S WORKING 
AND UH YEAH 
OH 
YEAH BUT 
NO NO NO 
BUT I MY MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT IT IT IT'S CONVENIENT TO HAVE THAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH WELL THAT'S THAT ARE GOOD IDEAS 
OH 
YEAH WELL THE LED ON THE CORNER THAT THAT INDICATES THAT IT'S WORKING 
IF YOU PUSH A BUTTON 
UM 
YEAH 
AND LOOKING ON THE BUDGET NOT TOO EXPENSIVE UH MATERIAL 
SO PROBABLY PLASTIC OR SOMETHING 
OH 
MM NO 
YES 
OKAY 
OH 
WELL WE WILL TRY 
WHERE IT GOING 
HMM 
OH 
MM 
SO 
NOW SAVE 
NOW UH BLANK 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
I'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING UH IN MY SCREEN NOW 
OKAY 
WOW 
OH 
NICE 
UH AT HOME WE HAVE A T. V. A VIDEO UH RECORDER A D. V. D. PLAYER AND A SATELLITE RECEIVER 
WE HAVE UH FOUR DISTINCTIVE REMOTE CONTROLS FOR THAT 
THAT'S NOT REALLY EA EASY 
SO IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE HAVE ONE FOR ALL 
AND WE ALSO HAD A REMOTE CONTROL FOR OUR RADIO SET 
BUT UM I IT IT HAD A LOT OF BUTTONS ON IT AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHICH ONE WAS WHAT 
AND IT WAS UH UH V NOT EASY TO USE 
SO WE N BARELY USED IT 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK IT UH FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW IT ALSO HAS TO LOOK NICE 
OR YOU WON'T SELL IT 
AND UM YEAH UH IN OUR WEBSITE WE CAN SEE WHAT PRODUCTS WE ALREADY HAVE 
AND IT SHOULD WORK WITH SO MANY UH AS POSSIBLE OF THEM 
YES 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO WELCOME BACK 
WHAT DO DO WE HAVE TO DO 
SO FIRST 
I WANT TO SAY I'M THE SECRETARY SO I MAKE THE MINUTES 
YOU FIND THEM IN YOUR IN THE MAP IN THE 
FROM THE GROUP 
THERE'S THE MINUTES FROM THE FIRST MEETING 
YOU'LL FIND THE NEXT MINUTES ALSO THERE 
THEN 
I WANNA HEAR FROM YOU WHAT YOU'VE DONE 
AND AFTER THAT I HAVE SOME NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS 
SO AND AFTER THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS WHAT WE WILL DO 
AND THEN WE'RE READY 
WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES FOR THIS MEETING 
AFTER THAT WE'LL HAVE LUNCH 
SO FIRST I WANNA ASK THE 
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TO TELL WHAT HE DID 
SO 
YEAH IN YOUR COMPUTER OR THE 
WHAT'S THE NAME 
WHAT'S THE NAME OF IT 
IT'S THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION OR THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
WORKING DESIGN 
WORKING DESIGN 
WHAT IS THIS 
PRODUCT DOCUMENTS 
IN THE DESKTOP 
UP 
UP 
UP 
UP 
UP 
YES 
MY DOCUMENTS 
NOPE 
AGAIN 
WELL YOU UM NAH 
NAH NAH NAH 
POWERPOINT 
WORKING DESIGN 
AND 
PRESENTATION 
OF WORKING DESIGN 
SAVE US 
UH IT'S 
PROJECT 
SAVE 
VERY GOOD 
OKAY 
SO 
NOW HAVE TEN MINUTES TO TELL IT 
OKAY 
UH UH 
TWO QUESTIONS 
THE BATTERY 
YOU SAY ONE BATTERY IS CHEAPER 
WHY 
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU USE TWO YOU CAN USE IT TWO TIMES LONGER 
OKAY SO IT'S THE SIZE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY AND THE BUTTONS 
WHEN YOU USE IT IN THE TELEVISION YOU'VE YOU NEED THE TELEVISION WH WHICH CAN USE IT 
OKAY 
I THINK WE HAVE TO USE IT ALSO IN THEIR TELEVISIONS THOUGH 
SO 
YEAH BUT I DON'T I THINK IT THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THOUGH 
WE HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE 
IT HAS TO WORK ON O UH ALL TELEVISIONS 
OKAY 
YEAH 
GOOD IDEA 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT THERE ARE MUCH MORE NOKIA TELEPHONES THAN UM THESE ONES 
YEAH BUT ARE THERE 
PROFITS BIGGER THAN THEIR COST 
YEAH BUT THERE ARE ALSO DESIGN COST 
I DON'T THINK WHEN YOU HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL DO YOU CHANGE THE COVER 
WOULD YOU CHANGE THE COVER 
NO 
NO YEAH BUT 
I THINK THAT IT LESS PEOPLE WOULD CHANGE IT FOR GOOD PROFIT 
SO 
YES IT IS BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT 
OKAY 
THAT'S CLEAR 
OKAY THANK YOU 
SO NOW THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
WE'LL GET BACK IN THAT LATER 
'KAY THANK YOU 
THEN IT'S YOUR TURN THE MARKETING EXPERT 
OKAY THANK YOU 
YES 
I THINK UH THE L. C. D. IS CHEAPER THAN SPEECH RECOGNITION 
SO I THINK THAT CAN BE AN IDEA GOOD OPTION 
L. C. D. 
YES 
ONLY THE L. C. D. 
SO BUT WE'LL COME BACK IN THAT 
NOW 
UH GO ON 
WHAT D D D UM 
UM 
UH WE GO BACK IN THE DECISIONS LATER 
NOW WE HAVE A FEW NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS 
FIRST TELETEXT 
WE HAVE INTERNET NOW SO WE DON'T NEED THE TELETEXT ANYMORE 
SO 
NOT NECESSARY 
NEXT 
ONLY FOR THE TELEVISION 
SO WE DON'T LOOK AT THE OTHER THINGS LIKE THE RED OR SOMETHING 
ONLY THE TELEVISION 
THIRD 
WE LOOK AT THE AGE GROUP OF FORTY PLUS 
OH NO YOUNGER THAN FORTY 
IS A G BIG GROUP AND LIKE YOU SHOWED N NOT VERY MUCH PEOPLE BUY OUR STUFF 
FOURTH POINT 
OUR CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN MUST BE USED 
VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE DESIGN 
SO YOU CAN USE IT IN OUR SET 
NEXT 
UM ONE 
WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR DECISIONS WHAT WE WANT TO DO 
SO LIKE 
YOU SAID WE NEED THE 
MAYBE IT'S GOOD TO PUT IT IN A DOCUMENT 
NOW WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT CONTROLS DO WE NEED 
SO MAYBE YOU CAN TELL US 
SORRY 
YES 
YES IT'S OKAY 
YEAH BUT WE DON'T USE IT 
IT'S A NEW REQUIREMENT 
SO IT'S NOT MY REQUIREMENT 
WE HAVE TO DO THIS 
NO 
SO 
WHAT CONTROLS DO WE NEED 
WHA FIRST 
OKAY 
UH POWER 
UH MM CHANNEL 
CHANNEL 
ZERO TO NINE 
VOLUME 
MAYBE IT'S EASY TO PICK 
WHAT WAS WI YOUR NO 
TECHNI 
OKAY 
WE HAD WE UH NO NO NO NO 
WHERE WAS THAT EXAMPLE OF THE 
JOHAN 
THAT WAS THE THE THE THE THE TECHNICAL 
HELLO 
OKAY 
WHAT DO WE NEED 
ON OFF 
ZERO TO NINE 
YEAH THAT'S THE CHANNEL 
MINE 
OH YES THE N NEWER TELEVISIONS UH DO HAVE MENUS 
OH 
UM MENU 
I THINK UM 
THE 
ONLY ONE OR 
TWO NUMBERS 
AND 
HELLO 
THAT'S CH 
YES 
IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YOU MEAN 
THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE IT IT HAS TO WORK ON ALL TELEVISIONS 
SO 
WE NEED 
NO YES 
BUT IF WE 
HAVE THIS 
SO NOW WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS 
SO THIS ENOUGH 
MUTE 
MAYBE IN THE MENU 
MUTE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MAYBE MORE 
NO 
WELL 
THEN THAT'S ALL 
THIS WILL BE THE BUTTONS 
AND 
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH FOR THE NEXT PHASE 
SO WE CAN GO ON IT 
YES 
NO THAT'S FOR THE NEXT PHASE 
UM 
PHASE TWO IS THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
SO THEN WE'LL HAVE THE CONCEPTS 
THAT'S FOR THE S UH NEXT POINT 
NOW WE HAVE LUNCH BREAK 
AFTER THAT WE HAVE TO THIRTY MINUTES FOR WORK 
AND YOU CAN FIND THE MINUTES IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER INCLUSIVE THE UH BUTTONS 
NO 
YOUR INDIVIDUAL ACTION YOU CAN FIND THEM IN THE EMAIL 
SO NOW IT'S TIME FOR LUNCH 
THANKS FOR COMING 
THAT'S MY TASK 
OKAY 
OH I'VE 
WHERE HAVE I PUT IT 
MY DOCUMENTS OR NOT 
HMM 
I'VE SAVE IT IN MY COMPUTER MY PRESENTATION 
BUT WHERE 
UH UH UH 
IT WAS ABOUT THE WORKING OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
NOPE 
NOT A F 
WAIT 
THE WORKING DESIGN 
BUT I'VE SAVED IT 
BUT NOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS 
HMM 
YEAH 
AND I IMPORT THIS UNTIL 
NO MORE 
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS 
YEAH THAT'S THE EMPTY ONE 
I HAD NO 
UH-HUH 
OPEN IT 
OKAY HERE TO USE 
PROJECT 
OKAY 
A LITTLE LATER BUT HERE TO USE 
SO OKAY 
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT WHAT I'M GONNA TELL YOU 
IT'S ABOUT THE WORKING OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
I JUST HAD IN HALF AN HOUR J TO STUDY IT AND I DON'T GET IT 
TEN MINUTES TO TELL IT 
OKAY 
I THINK IT WILL BE A FEW MINUTES AND FIRST UH I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE FINDINGS WHAT I DISCOVERED ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROL 
THE WORKING BUT IT UH IF IT 
UH THEN I'LL HAVE UH SOME KIND OF MAP AND IT'S THE TOP OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SCIENCE UH Y I WILL SHOW THAT UH IN IN A FEW MINUTES 
AND THEN UH WHAT I'LL THINK ABOUT IT 
FIRST THE FINDINGS 
THE REMOTE CONTROL IS A VERY DIFFICULT UH THING TO UH TO EXPLAIN IT JUST ALL OF YOU WHO WHO HAVEN'T SEEN A REMOTE CONTROL UH INSIDE 
UH THERE'S A LOT OF UH PLASTIC ON IT UM BECAUSE ITS UH NOT SO EXPENSIVE 
AND THERE ARE UH A LOT OF UH WIRES UH WHICH UM CONNECT THE COMPONENTS IN IT 
THE BATTERY AND THERE ARE UM SWITCHES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
THERE'S A LOT OF SMALL UH ELECTRONICS 
SO IT WON'T BE UM UH TOO EXPENSIVE TO BUILD IT 
ONLY TWELVE EURO FIFTY I THINK UH WE WILL MAKE IT 
NOW AND HERE I HAVE THE TOP OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UH HERE'S SOME KIND OF CHIP 
UH ON TOP OF THESE THREE OR UH THE NUMBERS 
UH YOU HAVE ALL IN YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
AND UH THE TELETEXT UH BUTTON 
AND UH HERE'S THE BATTERY 
AND WHEN YOU PUSH THE BUTTON IT WILL UH WILL BE SENT TO THE CHIP 
AND THE CHIP WILL UM SEND IT AT ALL KIND OF SUB COMPONENTS 
THAT'S WHAT I SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT 
AND AFTER THAT IT WILL BE SENT TO THE INFRARED 
AND THAT WILL SEND IT TO YOUR TELEVISION 
THAT'S A SHORT H HO HOW IT WORKS 
UH I THINK I CAN UH MAKE IT UH DIFFICULT BUT WE ALL 
WE ALL DON'T GET IT 
MY PREFERENCES 
IT'S UH IT WON'T BE UH WE SHOULDN'T MAKE IT TOO BIG 
UH ALSO FOR THE COST UH WE SHOULD ONLY PUT ONE BATTERY IN IT 
A LONG LASTING BATTERY 
UH ALSO FOR THE COST UH IS ONLY PLASTIC 
NOT OTHER MATERIALS 
ALSO BECAUSE OF THE COST UH NOT TOO MUCH BUTTONS ON IT 
WE CAN ALSO MAKE UH A BUTTON UH WITH A MENU UH BUTTON 
AND THEN UM THAT THAT YOU WILL USE IT IN THE T. V. 
AND IN THE T. V. YOU CAN UH SWITCH INTO THE MENU 
THAT'S I THINK IT'S EASIER 
AND THE BLEEP SIGNAL YOU UH YOU TOLD US 
UH BUT WE CAN ALSO USE IT UH A BLEEP LIKE SOMETHING WHEN THE BATTERY'S EMPTY THEN THERE IS A BLEEP 
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO CHANGE IT IN A IN A WEEK OR SOMETHING 
AND ALSO THE BLEEP WHEN WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT UH WHEN YOU LOST IT 
AND YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND THEN YOU HEAR BLEEP BLEEP AND WE WILL FIND OUT 
THIS IS UH JUST UH YEAH 
YEAH 
IF WE WE IF WE USE ONLY JUST AN UH SMALL PEN LIGHT THEN IT WILL BE CHEAPER THAN WHEN WE USE TWO 
YEAH BUT THEN WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE THE UM REMOTE CONTROL UH LONG LASTING 
JUST 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT UH I THINK THIS OUR REMOTE CONTROL IS FOR THE TELEVISIONS WE UH WE SELL IN OUR COMPANY 
OR IS IT ALSO FOR OTHER COMPANY UH FOR OTHER TELEVISIONS 
THEN THIS IS AN OPTION 
MAYBE JUST A MENU BUTTON TO USE IT IN OUR TELEVISIONS 
AND THEN WE MAKE IT EASIER UH FOR OUR TELEVISIONS 
AND IN THE OTHER TELE TELEVISIONS YOU CAN ALSO USE IT BUT THEN WE WON'T USE THE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
THEN I THINK UH THE MENU BUTTON UH WILL ONLY WORK ON THE NEWER TELEVISIONS 
AND WE WILL UH LOOK FORWARD AND DON'T MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH FOR THE OLDER TELEVISIONS 
AND I JUST UH HAVE ONE MORE IDEA 
UH MAYBE IT'S ONE OF YOUR TASKS 
BUT UH TO HAVE A TRENDY REMOTE CONTROL WE CAN ALSO M MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THE NOKIA M MOBILE PHONES 
TO CHANGE COVERS 
SO IF YOU HAVE UH A TRENDY HALF WITH ALL READ UH YELLOW AND SOMETHING 
AND THEN YOU CAN PUT A RED COVER ON IT 
AND ALSO DIFFERENT THINGS 
YES 
UH THEN IT WON'T BE UH WILL HAVE JUST ONE COVER ON THE UH ORIGINAL ONE 
AND THEN YOU CAN BUY THE COVERS 
I THINK IT WILL BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT BUT NOT TOO MUCH 
JUST LIKE WITH THE NOKIA UH MOBILE PHONES 
JUST ONE 
YEAH BUT THEN WE'LL HAVE TO TO JUST UM PUT FIVE COVERS ON IT AND SO IF IT WORKS 
IF IT WON'T WORKS THEN WE'LL GET SOMETHING ELSE 
THEN WE UH WON'T GO UH GO FURTHER WITH IT 
UH A P A A COVER MADE IN UH IN CHINA IT IT WON'T BE I GUESS SO EXPENSIVE I THINK 
MAYBE 
I W I WON'T 
BUT MAYBE I THINK TRENDY PEOPLE ARE LIKE CHILDREN WHERE YOU CAN POINT IN IT 
AND UH THE THE CHILDREN THINK UH THIS IS MY REMOTE CONTROL UH I MADE A PICTURE ON IT 
OH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
AND THE OTHER PEOPLE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YOU'RE THE PROJECT MANAGER 
YES 
THAT'S IT 
'KAY 
YEAH 
I HAVE UH ONE QUESTION 
IF WE AIM FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE UM AND THERE WILL BE UH A LOT OF FEATURES LIKE L. C. D. OR THE THE THE SPEECH UH F RECOGNISING 
UH THE COST WILL BE A LOT OF UH UH A LOT HIGHER 
UH I THINK WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN OUR BUDGET 
DO YOU THINK 
LIKE 
NO 
NO 
UH-HUH 
'KAY WE'LL JUST HAVE TO DO THAT 
OKAY 
NO DISCUSSION ABOUT IT 
OKAY 
UNFORTUNATELY 
TO CHANGE AT THE NEXT CHANNEL JUST ONE BUTTON 
TO MOVE UP MOVE DOWN 
BUT THEN WE COME TO THE COSTS 
BUT NOW WE HAVE ONLY THE BUTTONS 
AND UH WE DON'T YET HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK LIKE 
OR 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM 
YEAH IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
BUT 
IF IF IT YEAH I DON'T I'M NOT SURE IF IT WILL MAKE PROFIT ENOUGH TO UH BUT IT'S UH YEAH IT'S UH ORIGINAL IDEA 
NO 
OH 
THAT'S ME 
OH 
COME ON 
OH 
YES WELL UH UH I SHALL GIVE A SHORT TALK ABOUT THE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN 
UM I THOUGHT THE THE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN WAS UH TO UH FOR A REMOTE CONTROL TO TO TO HAVE SOME INFLUENCE ON THE T. V. SET 
UH BOTH AUDIO AND VIDE VIDEO UH IN A CORDLESS WAY 
NO CORDS ATTACHED 
AND UH WELL AT ALL BY PUSHING A BUTTON ON THE REMOTE 
THAT WAS FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND UH AND UH THE PREVIOUS MEETING 
UH I FOUND SOME UH SOME INTERESTING QUOTES ON THE WEB 
UH WELL THE SAME IDEA HERE 
UH MESSAGE TO THE TELEVISION 
AND UH AND AND AND WELL BASIC UH OPERATIONS LIKE ONE AND OFF AND UH SWITCHING CHANNELS AND UH AND MAYBE UH TELETEXT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UH WELL THESE ARE TWO UH REMOTES AND THAT'S OUR UH OUR DILEMMA I THINK 
OH 
WE JUST HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER HOW UH DIFFICULT TO USE 
BUT UH SHALL WE MAKE A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL UH JUST UH SWAPPING CHANNELS AND VOLUME AND UH POWER BUTTON AND WELL NOTHING MUCH MORE 
OR UH UH MORE FUNCTIONS ON THE REMOTE 
UH MAYBE MORE DEVICES YOU CAN INFLUENCE 
UH A RED OR A V A VIDEO RECORDER UH V. C. R. 
YEAH WELL THAT'S OUR DILEMMA 
UM ANY IDEAS ABOUT THAT 
BASIC OR MULTIFUNCTIONAL 
OKAY YEAH 
YEAH WELL TH THAT WAS JUST IN MY MIND 
SO UH I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT UH 
WHAT WAY WE WOULD GO 
MM YEAH WELL THAT WAS MY UH FUNCTIONAL UH TALK 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
NO 
AND I DON'T UH I DON'T THINK TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR A REMOTE IS REALLY CHEAP OR SOMETHING 
SO IT'S 
YEAH IT'S HARD TO UH 
GET THE YOUNGER 
GROUP 
MM-HMM 
JUST THE L. C. D. 
MM-HMM 
WELL A POWER BUTTON 
UH THE WELL UM I THINK SEPARATE CHANNELS 
SO 
BUT THEN BOTH THE THE SEPARATE CHANNELS 
SO SO UH ZERO TO NINE OR SOMETHING 
UH VOLUME 
OH MAN 
TECHNICAL 
MM YES 
MUTE 
UM 
YEAH BUT THEN IT'S ALWAYS UH MORE THAN ONE UH 
THING TO DO 
DESKTOP 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL 
MAKE IT 
HMM 
HMM 
WELL THIS WILL THIS ADD TO THE COST 
YES BUT YOU HAVE TO UM UH BE ABLE TO CHANGE IT 
D DOES IT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DESIGN 
NOT MUCH 
'KAY 
UM 
MM 
YEAH 
YES 
OKAY 
UH UM UM 
YEAH 
UM YEAH OKAY 
THIS BUT IT FOR 
SO 
SO I'M UH GONNA HAVE A PRESENTATION ABOUT UM THE MARKET BUT UM YEAH WHAT PEOPLE THINK 
UH WE DID A USABILITY LAB TEST WITH A HUNDRED PERSONS 
AND WE LOOKED AT UH SEVERAL UM THINGS 
UH AMONG THEM DESIGN UH D D HOW D DID THEY LIKE THE EASE OF IT UH WHAT FRUSTRATIONS THEY HAD WHILE USING REMOTE CONTROLS 
UH WELL WHAT WHAT WILL BE OUR MARKET 
AND UH WE ASKED THEM IF WE HAD SOME NEW FEATU FEATURES 
IF UM THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA OR NOT 
WELL OUR FINDINGS 
UH OUR USERS THEY DISLIKED THE LOOK AND FEEL OF CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS 
UM UH THEY ESPECIALLY FOUND FOUND THEM VERY UGLY 
AND UM THE THEY ALSO FIND THEM HARD TO TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT 
UH WELL THEY ALSO ZAP A LOT 
SO UH ZAPPING UH SHOULD BE VERY EASY 
AND UH FIFTY PERCENT OF THE USERS ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS 
IS A LOT OF UNUSED BUTTONS 
THERE IS MORE FINDINGS 
UH IN THE BUTTONS 
WHICH UH BUTTONS FIND USERS UH VERY IMPORTANT AND WHICH WHICH NOT 
AND HOW MUCH WOULD THEY USE THEM 
WELL UH THE MOST USED BUTTON IS THE CHANNEL SELECTION 
AND UH WE ASKED THEM HOW UH RELEVANT THEY THINK UH THE BUTTONS ARE 
THE POWER VOLUME AND CHANNEL SELECTIONS ARE VERY RELEVANT 
UH TELETEXT IS UH LESS RELEVANT BUT ALSO IMPORTANT 
UH NOT IMPORTANT THEY FIND THE D UH THAT'S NOT THE VOLUME BUT UH SPECIFIC THE THE PITCH OR THE LEFT OR RIGHT 
UH THE SCREEN AND THE BRIGHTNESS 
AND UH CHANNEL SETTINGS 
UH THE AND THEY ALSO OR NOT USED VERY OFTEN 
THEN WE HAVE A FEW UM GRAPHS ABOUT THE MARKET 
UH HERE WE CAN SEE WHAT THE MARKET SHARE SO IF UH SEVERAL GROUPS 
UM SO YOU CAN USE MOST USERS ARE UH BETWEEN THIRTY SIX AND FORTY FIVE 
UM THE THE THE YOUNGER GROUP BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE IS NOT VERY BIG 
AND TO COME BACK IN THE THE SWAPPING UH THINGS UH I DON'T THINK UH I I THINK THE YOUNGER WILL BE MOST INTEREST IN IT 
BUT UH THEY ARE NOT A VERY BIG GROUP 
UM IN THE WE ASKED THEM UH HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A AS A NEW FEATURE 
IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE CONTROL WHAT WOULD YOU THINK IF IT 
NOW YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE YOUNG USERS SAY 
I WILL THAT WOULD VERY NICE 
AND OLDER USER THINK UH THEY WILL BE SCARED OF CHANGE I THINK 
AND THEY WON'T LIKE IT 
AND ANOTHER THING HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A SPEECH RECOGNITION ON IT 
WELL HERE WE USE THE SAME 
YOUNG USERS UH THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA 
AND OLD USERS NOT 
UH WELL WE UH FIND OUT THAT THERE ARE TWO SEVERAL MARKETS AT WHICH WE CAN UM 
UH THE FIRST OR THE YOUNGER THE AGE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND FORTY FIVE 
UH THEY ARE HIGHLY INTERESTED IN THE FEATURES SO YOU CAN USE UH HERE 
AND UM THEY ARE MORE CRITICAL ON THEIR MONEY SPENDING 
UH THE SECOND GROUP IS THE OLDER GROUP 
AGED BETWEEN FORTY SIX AND SIXTY FIVE 
THEY ARE LESS INTERESTED IN UH NEW FEATURES 
BUT UH THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY MORE EASILY 
NOW IF WE LOOK BACK TO THIS GRAPH WE CAN SEE THAT AMONG THE FIRST GROUP IS ABOUT UM SIXTY PERCENT 
AND THE SECOND GROUP ABOUT FORTY PERCENT 
SO THE THE FIRST GROUP IS BIGGER 
WELL THEN I COME TO MY UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
OH YEAH THE FIRST QUESTION IS UH ALSO WE HAVE TO ASK IS TO THE WHICH MARKET DO WE UM IT 
UH OF COURSE N UH SAYING WE AIM AT THE YOUNG GROUP DOESN'T SAY THAT OLD PEOPLE WON'T BUY IT 
BUT LESS OF THEM WILL BUY IT 
UM WELL I UH OKAY 
WHAT I THOUGHT UM EVEN YOUNG PEOPLE SAY IT'S HARD TO USE 
REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IF YOU MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT IS UH VERY EASY TO USE 
THAT'S ESPECIALLY AIMED AT THIS GROUP EVEN UH THE YOUNG GROUP WILL ALSO BE MORE INTERESTED 
AND UM WE CAN MAKE SPECIAL FEATURES 
BUT UH I THINK IT LOOKS NICE IN THE FIRST TIME 
BUT WHEN IS IT UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UH GOOD THING OF SPEECH RECOGNITION 
UM WELL THE UH THAT'S MY SECOND POINT 
UH LESS IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE DISCARDED FROM THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S ABOUT DISCUSSION WE HAD EARLIER 
UM 
YOU CAN FIND MOST FUNCTIONS IN A T. V. SET 
SO UH YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF AUDIO OPTIONS ARE SCREEN OPTIONS TO CHANGE THE BRIGHTNESS 
AND SUCH THINGS 
UM WELL THE DESIGN IS VERY IMPORTANT 
ONE THING I DID NOT SAY I THINK 
SO THAT A LOT OF USERS ALSO SAID THEN I WOULD UH BY A GOOD LOOKING UH REMOTE CONTROL IF THERE WILL BE ONE 
BUT THEY FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS VERY UGLY 
SO THE DESIGN OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL IS VERY IMPORTANT 
AND UH YEAH IT SHOULD BE VERY ZAP FRIENDLY SO MOST USERS USE IT FOR THAT 
THAT WERE MY FINDINGS 
YES 
OKAY 
YEAH MAYBE WE CAN FIRST HAVE A DISCUSSION UH IN THE THE PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS YOU JUST UH SAID 
THE THE REQUIREMENTS YOU JUST SAID MAYBE WE SHOULD FIRST HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT 
I UH PERSONALLY THINK UH TELETEXT IS A GOOD OPTION 
UH NOT EVERYONE UM WHO IS LOOKING T. V. CAN GO TO INTERNET WHEN THEY WANT TO USE THE LATEST NEWS 
OKAY 
OKAY SORRY 
THEN UH 
MINE 
IT'S THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
D YEAH 
DO WE MAKE A MENU 
OH 
I THINK IT WILL BE UM Q QUITE EASY TO USE TO HAVE UH UH FOUR ARROWS 
UP DOWN FOR CHANNEL SELECTION AND LEFT RIGHT UH FOR VOLUME 
AND UH A MENU UH BUTTON 
AND IF YOU PRESS THE MENU BUTTON YOU GET INTO THE MENU AND YOU CAN USE THE SAME BUTTONS 
BUT TH THEN TO SCROLL THROUGH THE MENU AND TO CHANGE THE OPTIONS 
UH WELL YEAH THAT DEPENDS ON IF YOU HAVE UH THE MENU ON THE T. V. 
OR YOU GET THE MENU ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
YES 
BUT WELL IF YOU AIM AT THE YOUNGER MARKET UM A S THEY USE UH SO UH SO WE SEEN IN THE USABILITY UH LAB 
UH THEY WILL BUY A NICE LOOKING UM 
REMOTE CONTROL 
AND ALSO TO FIND THE EASY TO USE UH PART VERY IMPORTANT 
SO IF WE HAVE A L. C. D. SH UH SCREEN AND UH NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS 
I THINK THAT WILL INCRE UH UH EVEN WHEN IT'S A BIT MORE COST IT WILL STILL SELL 
MM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
GOOD IDEA 
OKAY 
WELL LET'S START 
WHAT ARE WE DOING 
OOPS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
NOT DOING 
OH 
VERY GOOD 
OKAY 
WE HAVE PRESENTATIONS 
SO FIRST IT'S YOUR TURN 
YEAH 
ISN'T IT AMAZING 
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
INTERFACE CONCEPT 
CAN YOU GO BACK ONE PAGE 
FOR THE UH MEAN WHAT DO WE USE FOR THAT 
WE DON'T HAVE BUTTONS FOR THE MENU 
ARE WE MAY HAVE TO USE CHANNEL OF THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL 
OKAY 
BUT UH 
YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN THE 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT HAS TO BE CLEAR THAT YOU CAN USE THE ARROWS 
MM-HMM 
YES 
THE SECOND ONE 
OKAY 
NOT TOO MUCH COLOURS 
NO IT'S NOT FLOWER POWER 
SO OKAY 
OKAY 
THANK YOU 
SO YOU'RE NEXT 
HMM 
NO ISN'T 
BUT THE L. C. D. S SAY WHEN YOU USE THE SCROLL UH BUTTONS 
THEN YOU CAN SCROLL YOU SEE WHAT NUMBER AND THEN YOU PUSH 
BUT THEN IT'S NOT EASY TO USE SCROLL UH 
WHEEL 
IF YOU DON'T 
HMM YES 
BUT THEN 
YEAH THEN YOU GO ONE DOWN ONE UP 
WHEN YOU SCROLL 
YEAH BUT LIKE WE SAID BEFORE IT HAS TO BE USED IN EVERY TELEVISION 
SO YOU MAY NOT BE UH 
NO 
THE TELEVISION MUST DO THAT 
SO 
YEAH BUT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE ALL THEIR UH ROOM 
AND MOSTLY THEY ARE SMALLER 
SO 
MOST THE TIMES THAT ARE NOT ADVANCED TELEVISIONS 
OKAY 
THAT'S IMPORTANT 
YEAH 
MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK HOW HOW MUCH TO USE FOR THE L. C. D. 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
YEAH MORE EXPENSIVE 
BUT HOW MUCH 
OH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL THANK YOU 
NEXT 
NO 
IT'S CLEAR 
SO NOW 
IT'S UH UH LET'S SEE 
NOW WE WE HAVE TO DECIDE 
WELL WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE CONCEPT 
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT 
'S NEXT 
COMPONENTS AND USER INTERFACE CONCEPT 
SO 
NOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME CONCEPT 
MAYBE IN IF YOU CAN PAINT IT IN THE BOARD 
FIRST UH USER INTERFACE 
YES A CONCEPT ON UH JUST 
YEAH BUT MAYBE WE CAN PAINT IT 
UH WHAT DO WE WANT 
I'LL POINT 
OKAY 
WELL 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
OR 
SHAPES ARE WHAT DO WE NEED 
YES OKAY 
OKAY 
AND YOU HAVE TO 
YEAH 
SO IT HAS TO BE SOFT 
OKAY 
AND UH THE BUTTONS 
BUTTONS 
NO IT WON'T 
BUT WELL THERE IN FOR THE SOUND AND ONE FOR THE CHANNELS 
UH TWO SCROLL UH WHEELS 
THAT'S THE THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT 
IT'S BETTER ONE 
BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE A L. C. D. WE DON'T HAVE A MENU 
YEAH BUT AGAIN MAYBE THE HOW DO WE KNOW THE T. V. CAN HANDLE IT 
YOU DON'T KNOW 
SO THERE'S NO MENU 
NO 
SO YOU CAN'T USE IT 
OKAY WE MAKE TWO CONCEPTS 
ONE WITH L. C. D. 
ONE WITHOUT L. C. D. 
GOOD CONCEPT 
BUT 
THAT'S ONE 
IT'S ONE 
TWO 
NUMBER TWO 
NO 
BUT WHEN YOU HANDLE IT YOU PUT IT ON AND OFF 
IT'S NOT GOOD TO USE 
YEAH BUT I'LL ZAP 
FUCK 
IT 
NO IT'S NOT GOOD 
NOW SECOND CONCEPT 
ONE WITH L. C. D. ONE WITHOUT L. C. D. 
THEN UH 
PAINT IT 
ONE WITH TWO SCROLL BUTTONS AND ONE WITH WITHOUT 
YEAH 
UH IN WITH A WITH A MENU AND ONE WITHOUT A MENU 
AND THE ONE WITH WITH A MENU HAS AN L. C. D. 
UNBELIEVABLE 
DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING 
BLANK 
YOU HAVE 
NOT SO DIFFICULT 
OH THAT'S THE MENU 
THERE FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YOU HAVE TO 
FOR THE MENU 
MM-HMM 
NO 
THAT WAY 
AND ONE 
THAT WAY 
SO 
THEN IT DEPENDS ON THE COST 
SO ON AND OFF 
WHEN IT'S NOT TOO BIG 
JUST LIKE A A PHONE 
YES OKAY 
VERY GOOD 
SO IT BETTER 
WHEN YOU UH THE MENU YOU HAVE TO GO THERE THERE THERE THERE 
YEAH OKAY 
THAT'S THAT'S THE OUTSIDE 
BUT NOW THE FIRST THE BUTTONS 
SORRY 
MUTE 
AND THE OTHER 
YEAH 
NOT SO DIFFICULT 
BUT HOW DO YOU WANNA SOLVE IT 
YEAH BUT IN THE MEAN THAT'S NOT UH SAY 
THEN YOU GO DOWN YOU SWITCH YOU GO INTO THE RIGHT YOU SWITCH YOU GO DOWN 
YEAH 
A JOYSTICK 
YEAH 
BUT IS IT UH 
DOES THAT BROKE A JOYSTICK 
OR A SMALL ONE JUST LIKE IN A LAPTOP 
MEAN IT'S BETTER 
BUT HOW EXPENSIVE TO USE 
OH 
WHY DO I PAY YOU FOR 
UM WELL UM 
BETTER IDEAS 
FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLES I THINK SCROLL BUTTON'S GOOD 
SO 
THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THEM 
YEAH BUT IS IT THAT'S NOT EXPENSIVE THAN UH JOYSTICK IS BETTER 
A SMALL ONE 
NO JUST LIKE IN A 
A LAPTOP 
SMALL ROUND 
THEN IT'S 
NOT SO BIG 
UH THE SH YEAH BUT THEN YOU CAN YOU HAVE TO USE IT WITH ONE HAND 
SO 
MAYBE IF IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE I THINK A JOYSTICK IS BETTER 
A SMALL ONE 
SO PLEASE LOOK AT IT 
YEAH W I THINK YOU GET IT 
SO AFTER THIS MEETING YOU HAVE HALF AN HOUR TO UH FIX IT 
YES 
YOUR PROBLEM 
NOT MINE 
OKAY 
SO DO WE HAVE THREE CONCEPTS 
THEN FOR THE COMPONENTS 
WE USE A NORMAL BATTERY 
THEN IT'S 
CH CHEAPEST WAY I THINK 
NO NO KINETIC 
KINETIC IS UH CH MAKES IT MORE EXPENSIVE 
SO WE USE A NORMAL BATTERY 
CHIP 
DEPENDS ON THE L. C. D. 
SCROLL 
YEAH 
AND UH W IF YOU USE THE L. C. D. WE HAVE TO 
YES OKAY 
SO DEPENDS ON THE L. C. D. AND THE SCROLL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO UH THE SHAPES OF THE 
DESIGN 
DEPENDS ON THE L. C. D. AND BUT 
IT HAS TO BE SMALL 
I THINK 
IF YOU HAVE PISTOL IT L. C. D. 'S NOT EASY 
Y Y YEAH BUT 
IF YOU USE A PHONE 
OK YEAH BUT BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO 
LIKE THE IF YOU HAVE PISTOL YOU HAVE TO USE 
AND THE SCREEN IS 
WELL THEN YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT THIS WAY TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN 
YEAH 
NO 
NO NO 
YEAH BUT THEN YOU LOOK FORWARD 
AND THEN YOU CAN YOU 
NO WELL IF YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT 
THEN IT GOES LIKE THIS 
OF THE ON WELL 
YES OF COURSE 
THAT'S GOOD GOOD 
BUT THE UM IT MAY NOT BREAK 
OKAY 
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE 
OKAY 
YEAH OF COURSE 
OKAY 
THEN THIS IS THE DESIGN 
AND THE BUTTONS ARE IN THE NEXT PAGE 
SO DEPENDS ON THE COST 
SO UM WE HAVE ONE MINUTE 
I THINK 
NO 
MORE 
SEVEN 
NEXT MEETING 
THIRTY MINUTES 
SO HURRY UP 
YOU TWO STAY HERE 
PAINT IT 
NOW YOU HAVE TO 
SO 
I THINK IT'S CLEAR 
CHECK YOUR EMAIL 
SO 
IT HAS TO BE READY IN THE NEXT MEETING 
SO 
NEXT MEETING IS CALLED THE DETAILED DESIGN 
SO 
EVERYTH EVERYTHING HAS TO BE READY 
THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION 
AH PINBALL 
HUH 
UH MAYBE I'LL HAVE SOMETHING IN MY UH PRESENTATION 
AND YOU WILL USE IT 
I'M NEXT OKAY 
YES 
NO 
HERE WE GO 
UH AT FIRST WE WILL UH I WILL F UH SAY SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT YOUNGER PEOPLE WANT 
OR UH GROUP W UH WE UH WE WANT TO UH SELL OUR REMOTE CONTROLS OUT 
AND THEN I'LL DISCUSS WHAT MY OPINION IS ABOUT THE COSTS BUT UH WHAT BATTERY IS ONE TO WHAT KIND OF BUTTONS ALSO 
FIRST UH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE THEY WANT LIKE SOFT MAT UH MATERIALS AND PRIMARY COLOURS 
LIKE TOTALLY YELLOW TOTALLY RED 
UH SO IT'S VISIBLE 
UH THE SHAPES ARE CURVED AND ROUND LIKE UH YOU ALSO SAID 
MAYBE IT'S NICE TO UH GET A REMOTE CONTROL NOT LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES STRAIGHT AND UH FLAT AND LONG 
BUT TO GIVE HIM THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND SO YOU IT'S EASIER TO USE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT THAT'S JUST AN IDEA 
AND THEN 
I'LL HAVE TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE COSTS UH OF ALL THE THINGS FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL 
THE BATTERY THERE ARE FEW OPTIONS 
UH I THINK THE BEST OPTION IS IT IS UH THE BASIC BATTERY 
SO EVERYBODY CAN BUY IT UH AT THE AT THE SUPERMARKET 
OR IS UH A K UH KINETIC BATTERY LIKE UH WITHIN A WATCH 
WHEN YOU UH SHAKE IT A FEW TIMES IT IT'S LOADED 
UH THE THE FORM OF THE REMOTE CONTROL I THINK IT'S ALSO NICE HAVE TO CURVED 
AND MAYBE LIKE IT'S HAND SHAPED 
UH SO UH YOU TAKE IT HERE IN YOUR HAND AND HERE ARE THE BUTTONS 
UH MATERIAL YOU USE PLASTIC 
HARD PLASTIC UH BECAUSE UH IT WON'T HAVE TO BURST UH LIKE IN THE IN IN TIME 
AND ALSO RUBBER BECAUSE THE YOUNGER PEOPLE LIKE THAT WHAT WE USE IN THE RESEARCH 
UH THE PUSH BUTTONS 
WE HAVE AN NEW THING UH DISCOVERED 
IT'S A SCROLL PUSH UH THING LIKE A MOUSE 
MAYBE IT'S UH EASY TO USE UH FOR THE CHANNELS 
WHEN YOU WANT TO GO M MOVE UP YOU JUST SCROLL UP AND CLICK ON THE BUTTON 
IF YOU WANNA USE THE NEXT UH IF YOU WANNA SEE THAT CHANNEL 
AND ALSO FOR THE MOUSE UH FOR THE VOLUME IT'S ALSO UH EASY TO USE 
JUST SCROLL A BIT UP SCROLL A BIT DOWN 
AND THAT'S ALSO SAY JUST W WHEN YOU HAVE A THING LIKE THIS AND YOU GET IT HERE 
YOU CAN DO IT WITH YOUR THUMB 
AND WITH YOUR L LEFT HAND YOU CAN UH PUSH THE BUTTONS UH IF YOU PUSH UH CHANNEL ONE YOU CAN SEE CHANNEL ONE 
THE ELECTRICS UM WITH A SCROLL PUSH UH BUTTON WE MUST USE REGULAR UH CHIPS 
THERE ARE ALSO UH SIMPLE CHIPS 
THEY ARE UH CHEAPER 
UM BUT THEN WE HAVE JUST A BASIC UH UH REMOTE CONTROL 
AND I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THIS UH THINGS AND PEOPLE WON'T BUY IT ANY MORE 
THEY HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF IT 
AND YOU HAVE ALSO ADVANCED UM CHIPS 
BUT THAT'S WITH THE L. C. D. UH SCREEN 
AND THE COSTS WILL INCREASE A LOT MORE 
AND I THINK OUR BUDGET IS TOO LOW TO USE AND AN L. C. D. AND THE CHIP WHO IS MORE EXPENSIVE 
AND MAYBE IT'S ALSO THEN UH THOUGHTFUL IF WE U UH SO UH SO UM DIFFERENT KIND OF UH SHAPES FOR THE FOR REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT WE THEN USE THE PRIMARY COLOURS 
LIKE YOU GOT A YELLOW UH REMOTE CONTROL RED IN BLUE ONE ET CETERA 
YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS 
I THINK THE MAIN THING SO WE LOOK AT THE COSTS 
AND NOT TOO BASIC NOT A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL WHO EVERYBODY ALREADY HAS 
NOT WITH AN L. C. D. 
NO 
YEAH 
BUT THEN WHAT I SAY THE COSTS WILL UH GET A LOT HIGHER 
TH THEN YOU'LL SEE IT IN THE TELEVISION 
YEAH BUT L WHEN YOU USE A MENU UH IN THE TELEVISION 
IT'S LIKE YOU USE UH ONE TO TWENTY YOU GO UH UH USE SCROLL UP AND PUSH NUMBER TW TWENTY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I THINK THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WILL HAVE NEWER TELEVISIONS WHICH 
CAN PROVIDE OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL 
YES 
BUT THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM 
I THINK 
NO BUT THEN WE'LL GET TO THE REGULAR UH REMOTE CONTROLS 
AND I THINK WHAT I SAID EVERYBODY HAS THEM UH HAS THEM ALREADY 
AND THEY GO TO A UH SUPERMARKET AND BY THEM UH FOR TWO EUROS 
UH AND GO AND GET THE MOST CHEAPEST UH THING 
AND I THINK WE MUST LOOK FURTHER TO UH TO DEVEL D DEVELOP SOMETHING NEWS 
I GET IT IN MY SCREEN AND IT WAS UH HIGHER 
BUT I DON'T KNOW UH HOW MUCH HIGHER 
THAT'S TRUE 
BUT THEN WE'LL I THINK WE MUST DISCUSS WHO UH WHAT WILL BE BETTER 
IF WE HAVE A BETTER SHAPE OF THE UM REMOTE CONTROL OR BETTER OPTIONS ON IT 
WITH A SCROLL MENU A W SCROLL THING AND A L. C. D. 
AND THEN A FLAT UM REMOTE CONTROL 
OR A MORE HAND SHAPED REMOTE CONTROL WITH SCROLL WITHOUT L. C. D. 
I CAN UH LIKE IN MY UH 
OH 
NOT THAT THE PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP CHIP 
A SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRES MINIMALLY A REGULAR CHIP WHICH IS A HIGHER PRICE RANGE 
THE DISPLAY REQUIRES A ADVANCED CHIP WHICH IS WHICH IN TURN IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE REGULAR CHIP 
DOESN'T SAY 
THAT'S FROM MY MANUFACTURING DIVISION 
YES 
CHANGING COVERS 
NOPE 
UH UH UH 
HOW WE HOW WE HOW WE MAKE IT 
OH 
SHOULDN'T WE FIRST DISCUSS ABOUT LIKE WHAT WE WE ALL 
YEAH BUT IF I PAINT WITH 
MORE LIKE SOMETHING 
UM LIKE YEAH I CAN'T DR I CAN'T DRAW IT 
UH I HAVE TO 
I'M NOT A DESIGNER 
IT'S MORE THREE D. 
LIKE UM WHEN YOU HAVE 
A PART HERE 
THIS IS THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE 
TH THOSE UNDER IT 
SO IT'S EASIER TO GET IT LIKE THIS 
IT'S LIKE A AGAIN 
AND IT HAS TO BE SOFT YEAH 
SO YOU CAN SQUEEZE IN IT AND SORRY 
BUTTONS ON TOP OF IT 
AND HERE 
THE SCROLLING 
YOU CAN DO IT WITH YOUR THUMB 
BUT NOW WE USE ONE SCROLL BUTTON AND THE OTHER ONE IS HERE 
ONE TILL UH UH ZERO TILL NINE 
AND THE B 
YEAH 
OR TWO BUTTONS 
IF UH 'KAY C IF WE DO IF WE USE ONE THEN WE'LL HAVE JUST A SWITCH ON IT 
AND YOU'LL JUST SWITCH IT AND NOW IT'S THE SOUND TO SWITCH BACK 
WITH THE MENU UH BUTTON 
AND THEN YOU ALSO CAN SCROLL UH SCROLL ON IT 
JUST NOT LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES WITH UH THIS THING AND UH HERE AN ARROW HERE AN ARROW HERE AN ARROW HERE AN ARROW 
BECAUSE UH FROM UH HUNDRED UH REMOTE CONTROLS NINETY NINE HAVE TO 
UH THEN WE HAVE IT IN THE T. V. THE MENU 
I DON'T KNOW 
IT'S LIKE SOME SORT OF UH TELETEXT OPTION BUT WE DON'T HAVE TELETEXT 
AND IF WE PUT AN L. C. D. THING ON IT THEN THE COSTS WILL UH BE MUCH HIGHER 
'KAY 
BUT YOU ALL LIKE THIS KIND OF THING 
OH 
WITH THE SCROLL BUTTON 
AND AND THIS ONE HAS TO BE SOFT 
AND THIS HAS TO BE HARDER BECAUSE WHEN IT FALLS IT MU MU MUST NOT BURST 
OR SOME KIND OF RUBBER AROUND IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH THAT'S NICE 
HERE 
TRIGGER 
PAINT IT 
WITH THE SCROLL THING IN LIKE THIS 
SO 
DRAW IT 
BUT IS IT EASY TO USE 
WHEN YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR LEFT SIDE AND 
SEPARATE MORE SEPARATE UH YEAH 
YEAH 
IN THE LEFT A SCROLL BUTTON AND IN THE RIGHT A SCROLL BUTTON 
BUT WOULD TO BE EASY TO USE THEN 
IF IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE A BIG UH 
I ALSO THINK THIS CONCEPT IS NOT WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE LOOKING FOR 
THEY WERE LIKE ROUND CURVES UH DIFFERENT UH 
OKAY OKAY OKAY 
MM-HMM 
PERSONALLY I THINK TWO SCROLL BUTTONS UH AREN'T EASY TO HANDLE 
WITH THE SWITCH BUTTON 
NO LIKE UH 
UH YOU MEAN LIKE THAT 
UH THEN YOU CAN ALSO HAVE LIKE UH THE UM 
YEAH AND JOYSTICK I THINK 
YEAH LIKE IN A LAPTOP IS UH S SOME SORT OF THING 
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER WITH USER THE 
I DON'T KNOW 
OR ONE SCROLL UH THINGS 
JUST A SHAPE 
AND NO NO 
IT WON'T WORK 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
OR A REMOTE CONTROL MORE LIKE JOYSTICK 
A SMALL ONE LIKE THIS LIKE A NINTENDO UH K 
PLAYSTATION THING 
NO NO NO 
I MEAN THE THE SHAPE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL 
JUST LIKE A PLAYSTATION THING 
YEAH 
NO THAT'S OKAY I GOT 
UH THEY'RE NOT UH 
NO DETAILS 
IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE OR LESS EXPENSIVE HUH 
THEN I HAVE TO COME WITH IT 
I GOT MY PERSONAL COSTS 
I I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THE COSTS 
THEN I'LL UH MAKE SOMETHING UP 
YEAH OR THE OR THE KINETIC UH WITH NORMAL BATTERY 
YEAH I THINK IT'S UH YEAH MORE EXPENSIVE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
DEPENDS ON THE SCROLL 
IF WE USE A SCROLL THEN WE HAVE THE UH REGULAR CHIP 
IF WE DON'T USE A SCROLL THEN WE CAN USE THE SIMPLE CHIP 
AND THAT'S 
UH THE MOST EXPENSIVE 
YEAH 
IF WE YEAH 
IF WE N OKAY SCROLL WHEEL 
SO I HAVE THIS 
SO IT WILL BE UH THE ADVANCED CHIP OR THE UH REGU UH ARE THE REGULAR CHIP 
OR SHALL WE JUST PUT IT IN THE PISTOL THING 
AND THEN JUST PUT ALSO AN L. C. D. ON IT 
JUST USE YOUR THUMB 
IF YOU YEAH 
I SEE MY THUMB 
YEAH 
IF YOU HAVE A JOYSTICK ON 
NO IF YOU HAVE LIKE UH IN UH UH A IN A UH PLAYSTATION UH GAME CONTROLLER 
AND YOU MOVE UP F FORWARD DOWN LEFT 
THEN YOU HAVE UH JUST YEAH A LITTLE BIT CURVED 
IT'S NOT JUST UH STRAIGHT 
THAT'S HOW WE USE IT 
THAT'S WHY THEY MAKE JOYSTICKS LIKE THAT I THINK 
YEAH 
'KAY 
HERE'S OUR DESIGNER 
YEAH 
YEAH WHY NOT 
IT'S FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE 
IT'S SOMETHING NEW 
NOW WE PUT UH RUBBER AROUND IT 
HARD PLASTIC UH THE SHAPE AND AROUND IT HARD UH AROUND IT RUBBER 
AND THE UH THE HAND SHAPE IS ALSO RUBBER 
HUH 
THIS IS SOMETHING NEW 
COSTS ARE OKAY 
OH THAT'S US TOGETHER 
YES 
'KAY 
BYE BYE 
HMM 
OH 
MINE 
OH GREAT 
OH 
YES WELL UH LET'S UH TALK ABOUT THE INTERFACE UH CONCEPT 
UH FIRST I'LL UH I'LL UH DISCUSS THE BUTTONS WE JUST CHOOSE UH SHOW YOU SOME SAMPLES UH 
UH DISCUSS SOME COLOURS AND DESIGN MAYBE ALREADY 
AND UH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
WELL WE CHOOSE THE POWER BUTTON TO SWITCH THE TELEVISION ON AND OFF 
THE B UH THE MUTE BUTTON TO SWITCH THE VOLUME ON AND O ONE AND OFF 
THE CHANNELS BUTTONS ON TO NINE AND UH OFF UH UH ZERO TO NINE AND THE UH BUTTON TO CHOOSE UH HIGHER CHANNELS THAN NINE 
UH THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL QUADRANTS UH LEFT AND RIGHT UP AND DOWN ARROWS TO UH DO THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL 
AND THE MAIN MENU BUTTON TO MAN MANIPULATE THE L. C. D. UH DISPLAY 
UM I FOUND SOME UH INTERESTING UH UH SAMPLES 
EXAMPLES 
UM WELL UH WHAT'S PRETTY STANDARD IS UH THAT IT'S THAT THEY'RE ALL PRETTY UH UH HIGH UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
LARGE AND AND AND PRETTY THIN AND UH AND LONG 
UM POWER BUTTONS ARE MOSTLY AT THE TOP 
UH LEFT OR RIGHT 
UM WELL WE USE THE THE THE SAME UH 
ARROWS 
LIKE THREE 
AND UH 
YEAH WELL ARROW B BUTTONS CAN BE ABLE 
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE THE THE ICONS ON THE BUTTONS 
SOME BUTTONS HAVE ICONS LIKE THE PLAY AND STOP BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT 
BUT UH THIS WE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT ICONS OR OR LETTERS 
UH THIS IS THE V. FOR VOLUME BUT THEY'RE BOTH UH A V. 
SO IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY VERY UH CLEAR WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THAT 
UM 
YEAH 
SO THAT'S 
UH WELL 
YEAH 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS OUR UH DO 
SO UH HOW 
LIKE THIS 
OR OR THIS 
AND THAT THE MENU BUTTON IS OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
UH IS THE 
THE ICONS ON THE ARROWS AS WELL YOU MEAN 
YEAH 
UH WELL THAT'S SOMETHING TO UH THINK ABOUT 
OKAY 
UM WELL I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS ALREADY OR IN THE NEXT UH MEETING 
BUT UH 
SO WE HAVE TO UH TO TO DESIGN THE THE CASE AND THE WHOLE UH REMOTE CONTROL IN OUR UH OUR OUR CORPORATE UH COMPANY UH UH COLOURS AND THE LOGO 
I WOULD UH RECOMMEND A YELLOW CASE 
UH ROUND EDGES 
THE LOGO AT THE BOTTOM 
AND UH WELL MAYBE EACH EACH UH SET OF BUTTONS UH HAS UH HIS HIS OWN COLOUR 
SO IT'S GOOD 
UH RECOGNISABLE 
OK SO I THINK 
OH NO 
NOT TOO MUCH 
BUT UH NO NO NO 
BUT THIS HAS TO BE HAS TO BE TRENDY AND UH AND 
OH YEAH SO GOOD UH GOOD ICONS ON THE BUTTONS AND UH AND BIG BUTTONS SO MY UH PERSONAL UH 
OPINION 
THAT WAS THAT 
HMM 
NO 
MM YES 
WHAT 
MM 
YEAH 
BUT BUT I THAT'S THE ONLY SCROLL UH BUTTON ON IT THEN 
YEAH OKAY 
BUT BUT HOW 
YEAH 
HOW 
OKAY 
MM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
AND YOU CAN AND YOU CAN UH MAKE THE THE POWER BUTTON IS A TRIGGER 
LIKE UH 
JUST TO UH 
UH LIKE A 
YEAH 
BUT IF YOU PUT PUSH THE THE MENU BUTTON 
YEAH WH WHAT 
YES BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH OF THE SCROLL BUTTONS YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S UH 
OR YOU CAN UH 
TURN IT INSIDE 
BUT THAT'S 
NO THAT'S TRUE 
OKAY 
COOKIE 
MM 
OH 
HEY 
OH 
NOW I HAVE MY SCREEN BACK TO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
VERY INTERESTING 
LARGE 
A LOT A LOT OF BUTTONS BUTTONS 
YEAH 
YES 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
YEP 
YEAH 
BUT TH I UH THIS IS WITH AN L. C. D. 
NO NOT 
UH CAN YOU GIVE AN INDICATION IN B UH IN THE COST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UH THE CHIP WITH L. C. D. OR WITHOUT 
'CAUSE IT I THINK IF WE HAVE AN L. C. D. IT WILL ALSO SELL A LOT BETTER 
AND THAT MIGHT UH BRING BACK THE COSTS UH 
HUH 
'KAY 
MY TURN 
MM 
SO 
SO 
YEAH 
SO MY UH PRESENTATION IS ABOUT TREND WATCHING 
UH I DID SOME TREND WATCHING 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UH KEEP UP WITH LATEST TRENDS 
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOU WON'T SELL 
AS WELL HOW WE DID DO THAT 
UH WELL WE MADE AN INVESTIGATION OF THE MARKET BY TRENDWATCHERS 
THEY UH WATCH IN UH CITIES LIKE UH PARIS AND MILAN 
OF COURSE WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR UH TREND UH TRENDS 
AND WELL UH WHAT DID YOU FIND 
UH WE HAVE TWO GROUPS YOUNG AND TRENDY AND THE OLD AND RICH 
WELL THE AND THE YOUNG AND TRENDY THEY UH THEY STARTING TO LIKE UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES UH AS A THEME FOR AN UH CLOTHES 
SHOES AND ALSO UH PRODUCTS 
AND UM MATERIAL 
THAT SHOULD FEEL HAVE UH A SPONGY FEELING 
AND TO GET A FEELING FOR WHAT IT IS UH HERE IS AN IMAGE OF IT 
THEN THE OLD AND RICH 
THEY LIKE UH DARK COLOURS AND SIMPLE RECOGNISABLE SHAPES 
AND UM THEY ALSO LIKE UH FAMILIAR MATERIAL UH ESPECIALLY WOOD 
NOW ANOTHER PICTURE 
TO GET A FEELING FOR THIS 
WELL UH THEN ALREADY COME TO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES 
WE UH UM AT THE YOUNGER MARKET 
SO WE SHOULD ALSO BE UH LOOK AT THEIR UH TRENDS 
HOWEVER WITH TRENDS IT'S ALWAYS IF THERE'S IT'S NOW 
IT IT IT MIGHT LAST ONE YEAR AND NEXT YEAR TO BE UH CAN BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
AND I THINK WE WANT TO SELL OUR PRODUCT FOR LONGER THAN ONE YEAR 
SO WE M MUST NOT JUST ONLY LOOK AT WHAT THE TREND SO NOW IS IT MIGHT BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT NEXT YEAR 
SO THAT'S UH ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND 
YEAH 
ANY QUESTIONS 
YEAH 
MM 
CAN MAKE SEVERAL UH CONCEPTS 
WE HAVE THIS AND WE HAD THE IDEA OF ONE UM A MORE UH UH UH LIKE SH IN THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND 
YEAH I I I UH YES 
YEAH 
A G MM 
YEAH 
AND I IF WE GO TO UH 
BUT IF WE HAVE UH A UM YEAH 
IF WE HAVE A MENU UH HOW DO WE UH CHOOSE OTHER OPTIONS 
YEAH 
UH UH 
UH UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM UH YEAH MAYBE IT'S BETTER IF THE UH SCROLL WHEELS ARE M MORE SEPARATE YEAH 
LIKE YOU HAVE THE MENU BUTTON IN BETWEEN UH 
YEAH 
THINK WE HAVE WE HAVE NOW TWO BUTTONS MISSING 
THE UH UM

HMM 
WELL UH WE CAN'T DO THAT 
UM SO UH YOU HAVE TO THINK IF IT IS UH THE REMOTE CONTROL IS TECHNO TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE 
UH AND THEN WE HAVE TO UH AGREE ON THE RATING TOGETHER 
AND IN THE END WE WILL C UH COUNT AN AVERAGE 
OF ALL RATING 
THE FIRST UH IN EACH TIME 
YEAH I THINK IT'S UH UH WELL TECHNOLOGICALLY USING IT'S NOT UH IT DOESN'T CONTAIN MANY NEW FEATURES 
ONLY THE L. C. D.

THE FIRST TIME 
SO OKAY THE SECOND TIME 
UM THIS PRODUCT IS FOR ALL SORTS OF CUSTOMERS

BECAUSE WE UH REALLY UM UH TO TO YOUNG MARKET AND I THINK THE WAY IT LOOKED UH C UH TOTALLY IN YELLOW 
IT'S NOT UH REALLY AIMED FOR ALL CUSTOMERS 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT 
THAT'S UH A SIX 
FOUR 
OH OKAY 
MM 
THAT'S UH THE MOTTO OF OUR COMPANY 
YEAH WELL DO WE DO THIS WITH UH THIS PRODUCT

YEAH AGREE 
A THREE 
YEAH OKAY 
THE NEXT ELEMENT UM SO THE PRODUCT LOOKS GOOD

SO I WOULD GIVE THIS A FIVE 
WE HAVE TO DO OUR UH TWO OR THREE 
TWO 
OKAY 
AS WELL WE GONNA DO THE NEXT PART 
UH YEP 
UH UH THE NEXT STATEMENT 
IT HAS NOT TOO MUCH BUTTONS 
UM YEAH I I HAVE UH SAID IS NOT BECAUSE UH A LOW NUMBER IS BETTER 
AND IN THE END WE CALCULATE AN AVERAGE 
SO UM THAT'S WHY IT'S A NEGATIVE IN IT 
UM WELL THIS ONE OF OUR AIMS NOT HAVE TOO MUCH BUTTONS 
SO UM UH DID WE UH DO THAT 
WELL UH IF WE GO TO UH THIS FASHION I WE STILL HAVE CAUSED UH A LOT OF UH BUTTONS FOR THE NUMBERS 
BUT YOU CAN YOU CAN GO FOR THAT 
AND UM THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS OVER 
SO I WOULD GIVE THIS A TWO 
NO 
UM BUT WHERE WHERE IS THE 
SO 
YEAH DID WE IMPLEMENT UH THE SOUND

WELL IT HAS A UM A NICE COLOUR UH WELL COMPARED TO FOOD BUT WE DIDN'T UH 
WE DID NOT PAINT ANY UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE ON IT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO I WOULD DID NOT GIVE THIS UH A ONE OR TWO

SO THERE A SCHEDULE FOR THIS MEETING 
I SHALL CLOSE THE DOOR 
THAT'S CORRECT 
OKAY 
UM SO THERE ANY ROOM FOR A LITTLE PRESENTATION 
UH MAYBE DURING THE DISCUSSION UH SECTION 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
I'M JUST UH GUESSING WHAT SHOULD BE MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
WELL I'LL GIVE IT A TRY 
MM 
VERY GOOD 
I WAS VERY GOOD IN DRAWING 
WELL I GUESS YOU UH GET THE IDEA 
BEAUTIFUL 
YES UM I HAVE SOME TECHNICAL UH ISSUES WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT IT YOU UH BEFORE WE START THE DISCUSSION 
BECAUSE UH THERE MIGHT BE SOME UH INFLUATIONS INFLUENCES 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM FIRST ABOUT MY ROLE ROLE OF THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER 
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ABOUT UH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UH OF THINGS AND THE TECHNICAL POSSIBILITIES AND IMPOSSIBILITIES 
SO IF SOMEONE IF YOU COMES UP WITH UH DOES UH I'LL TRY TO TRANSLATE THEM IN TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS BUT UH THERE MIGHT BE SOME IMPOSSIBILITIES 
SO THAT'S ONE 
UH I ALSO WILL PROPOSE SOME UH UM 
UH SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR THAT BUT WELL THESE ARE QUITE THE SAME 
SORRY ABOUT THAT 
UM AND I ALSO WILL REMIND PEOPLE OF SOME NEW TECHNICAL POSSIBILITIES WHICH ARE AVAILABLE AND WHICH MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO IMPLEMENT IN OUR PRODUCT 
I HAVE SOME UH INITIAL IDEAS ABOUT SOME THINGS UM WHICH ARE MAYBE NICE TO TAKE WITH YOU IN THE UPCOMING UH DISCUSSION 
ONE THING ABOUT UH INTEROPERA OPERABILITY 
UM I THINK A MODERN UH REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD UH CONTROL A DEVICE DIVERSE SUBSET OF EQUIPMENT 
UH FOR INSTANCE UH D. V. D. PLAYERS CELL PHONES VIDEO AND AUDIO EQUIPMENT 
SO IN OUR UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL FOR ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT 
WELL THERE SHOULD BE SOME INTEROPERABI INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN THEM 
I THINK IT COULD COME IN HANDY 
WE SHOULD DISCUSS THAT 
UM AND WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE WAY HOW THESE THINGS UH SHOULD COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER 
WE'RE NOT UH LIVING IN THE UH NINETEEN EIGHTIES ANYMORE SO INFRARED IS NOT UH 
IS NOT REALLY UH HOT UH TECHNICAL STUFF ANYMORE 
BUT YOU SHOULD UH THINK ABOUT THE THINGS LIKE UH BLUETOOTH 
MM-HMM 
BUT IT'S COST EFFECTIVE 
YES 
MM-HMM 
WELL NOT ALL NOT ALL 
SO THAT'S THE POINT 
SO 
MAYBE BUT THAT'S UH SOMETHING WE SHOULD DISCUSS AND UH BUT EVERY EVERYBODY SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT 
SO THAT'S JUST MY ROLE I'LL JUST UH GIVE YOU UH EVERYBODY SOME TECHNICAL INPUT 
AND I THINK NOW THE TIME IS TO HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT UH THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE AND HOW IT SHOULD LOOK 
BUT TAKE THESE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT WHEN YOU START THE DISCUSSION 
YES SO ONE THING UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD UH CONTROL ONE OR MORE UH PIECES OF EQUIPMENT AND THE WAY OF COMMUNICATING WITH THESE EQUIPMENTS 
OKAY 
THAT'S IT 
YES I THINK IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WE'RE NOT DEVELOPING THIS PRODUCT FOR A SPECIFIC VENDOR ARE WE 
NO WE'RE JUST DEVELOPING THIS PRODUCT AND WE WANT TO SELL IT IT A VERY BROAD UH PUBLIC SO IT SHOULD FIT IT EVERY DEVICE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
AND YOU YOU USE UH THE BUTTONS AS A AS A MEANS OF DOING THIS 
OR ARE THERE ANY O OTHER CONTROLS 
OR THREE ONLY ANY OTHER CONT 
WELL I I'VE SEEN THIS REMOTE CONTROLS WITH UH THIS LITTLE STICK UH WHICH YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD SIDEWORDS 
YOU KNOW THESE THINGS 
AND UM IT'S VERY EASY FOR A USER TO TO SWITCH W YES 
IT TO SWITCH B UH BETWEEN UH CHANNELS OR UH CHANGE UH BETWEEN TRACKS ON A IN A C. D. 
IN IN A CHAPTERS YOU KNOW IN A D. V. D. PLAYER 
SO MAYBE THAT'S AN IDEA I DON'T KNOW 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
UH SO THAT UH ARE THERE RESTRICTION FOR THE RANGE THE OPERATING RANGE TOO 
SO WHEN YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO POINT AT THE DEVICE UM THE RANGE IS VERY LIMITED 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
DO DO YOU 
UM WELL YES I HAD UH ABOUT THREE MINUTES AGO BUT I'VE SEEM TO FORGET THEM FORGOT THEM 
UM UH YES I REMEMBER 
UM YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT VISIBILITY IN THE DARK 
UM 
UH WOULD TO BE NICE FOR A USER TO HAVE DISPLAY ON THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL IN WHICH YOU CAN SEE FUNCTIONS 
WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO OPERATE IT 
I I DON'T KNOW 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YES BUT THERE'S A COST LIMITATION TOO 
WELL THAT'S MORE 
SO THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM I THINK 
I THINK THE THE FINANCIAL PART OF THIS PROJECT UH IMPLICATES THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A HIGH HIGH END PRODUCT 
THE COST PRICE IS VERY LOW 
UM 
OKAY 
VERY GOOD POINT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
HMM 
IT'S SO UH A LOT OF UH WELL WELL CELL PHONES HAVE UH INTEGRATED BLUETOOTH ALSO AND WELL IT'S IT SEEMS TO WORK UH QUITE OKAY 
SO UH TECHNICALLY IT WILL BE POSSIBLE 
NO YOU CANNOT 
OKAY 
OKAY 
GOOD MORNING FLORES 
MARKETING EXPERT 
RIGHT 
FOR THE CAMERAS 
ALRIGHT 
GEEZ 
YOU HAVE THE SAME MESSAGE OF UH WINDOWS CANNOT UM 
SEN OH STAND BY 
CLOSE THE THE WINDOW 
SO 
THAT'S RIGHT 
RED 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
ALRIGHT 
OKAY 
PROGRESSIONS 
IT'S FOR THE VISION 
YEAH 
SENSORS 
BUT WE ALL USE THE SAME WHITE BOARD FILE 
SO WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON IT WHILE WE'RE OR SHOULD WE ONLY USE IT IN THE ON THE MEETINGS 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH ALRIGHT 
YEP 
IT'S A BUNNY 
BUT OF COURSE FLORES 
BLANK 
YEAH I'M THINK ABOUT IT IT 
FORMAT 
WELL IT LOOKED MORE THAN A BUNNY THAN A CAT BUT IT WORKS RIGHT 
WITH A VERY SMALL LEGS 
YOU SHOULD FEED THAT UH THAT ANIMAL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
AND FOR A CELL PHONE 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
BUT 
YEAH BUT THE INFRARED IT'S UH WELL A LITTLE BIT OLD FASHIONED IF YOU WOULD CALL IT LIKE THAT 
BUT ALL THE T. V. S OR UH EQUIPPED WITH INFRARED IS 
Y Y YOU CAN 
MOST OF THEM 
OR YOU SHOU SH IS A YOU SHOULD EQUIP INFRARED AND BLUETOOTH TOGETHER ON ON REMOTE 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL I HAD A FEW UH THINGS IN MIND 
UM WELL THE INTEROPERABILITY JUST LIKE UH SEBASTIAN SAID UM THE REMOTE SHOULD WORK IN DIFFERENT T. V. S OR EVEN DIFFERENT UH UM 
YEAH UH WHAT IS IT DEVICES 
UM SO I I I THINK IT'S A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL FOR CUSTOMERS TO BUY JUST NOW IN UH A STEREO 
IT'S NOT FOR UH FOR UH FOR UH PHILIPS OR WHATEVER IT BY OUR REMOTE FOR THEIR OWN PRODUCT RIGHT 
YEAH I D I DON'T KNOW THAT 
IT'S NO I HAVE UH DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION FOR IT 
NO OKAY 
YEAH 
UM 
WELL THE TECHNI FU TECHNICAL FUNCTION UH WHAT YOU SAID IS JUST BY PRESSING THE BUTTON YOU SHOULD CHANGE THE STATE OF THE T. V. 
THAT'S JUST THE BASIC FU TECHNICAL FUNCTION 
SO THAT WAS MY REALLY MY PART FOR UH THIS SESSION 
UM 
WELL THAT'S JUST THE OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION IS PURE WHAT SHOULD THE REMOTE CONTROL DO 
WHA WHAT IS HIS TASK UH AS AN UH AS AN UH DEVICE 
IT JUST SHOULD CHANGE THE T. V. 'S STATE 
SO THAT'S IT 
UM BUT FURTHERMORE 
YEAH 
YEAH WITH BUTTONS 
YEAH OR MAYBE YOU WANT A TOUCH SCREEN OR 
BUT 
YEAH 
THEY'RE VERY VU VULNERABLE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND FOR OTHER USER INTERFACE I HAD UM WELL IT'S MORE INDUSTRIAL THING 
UH POINT TO A T. V. I THINK IT'S IT'S QUITE DISTURBING WHEN YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO POINT DIRECTLY AT THE T. V. 
SO YOU MUST POINT EVERYWHERE SO MAYBE INFRARED IS 
YEAH JUST DON'T EVEN POINT TO USE IN THAT CASE INFRARED SHOULD UH MAYBE UH BE RESTRICTION TO THAT 
YEAH IF YOU GO IF YOU GO TO READ OR OR YEAH 
FOR T. V. YOU'RE ALWAYS ON ON THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF A T. V. S I DON'T THINK THINK 
THE RANGE SHOULD BE A PROBLEM TO THAT BUT IF YOU WANT TO UH GET IT WORKING WITH A RED 
AND YOU'RE IN OUTSIDE YOUR GARDEN WITH JUST AN UH SPEAKER THEN MAYBE THE RANGE SHOULD BE UH 
BUT 
YEAH 
TWO MORE THINGS 
UM 
YOU SHOULD ABLE TO FEEL THE BUTTONS WITHOUT UH IT MIS UM YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE BUTTONS 
SO IT SHOULD BE AS USER INTERFACE UM FOR FEELING SHOULD BE UH GOOD TO UNDERSTAND 
YOU MUST FEEL THE BUTTONS FOR VOLUME OR WHATEVER I THINK 
AND OF COURSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHERE ALL BUTTONS OR IS IT SHOULD BE VISIBLE AL UM IN DARK IT 
SO WHEN IT'S DARK 
THESE ARE TWO REALLY UH USER INTERFACE 
YEAH 
THAT'S PERFECT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL MAYBE I UM BUT IT IT CAN BE QUITE SIMPLE YOU CAN JUST HAVE WHAT BUTTONS WITH A BLACK MARK ON IT 
THE UH THE THE DIGITS IN BLACK 
UH THEN IT'S ALREADY VISIBLE IN DARK 
SO IT IT DON'T HAVE TO BE A LIGHTNING OR OR A FANCY WELL IT CAN BE FOR DESIGN OF COURSE 
JUST REMIND SOMETHING 
THE DIGITS OF UH THE THE PAINTING ON THE BUTTONS SHOULD NOT FADE 
YOU HAVE A UM UH 
ALWAYS HAVE IS THE SOFT BUTTONS ALWAYS UH 
COLOUR THE THE THE POINT IN IT 
THE MARKS 
YEAH 
BUT UM 
NECESSARY YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT THEN BLUETOOTH UH MIGHT BE PROBLEM 
'CAUSE I THINK BLUETOOTH UH 
YEAH I KNOW IT FROM THE CELL PHONE 
BUT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T USE BLUETOOTH ALL THE TIME TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY 
DOES IT 
IT'S OVER 
OKAY 
GREAT 
OKAY 
GOOD MORNING 
OKAY 
UM GREEN 
AN ANIMAL 
OKAY 
UM 
UH A WEE RABBIT 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT YEAH 
UH I THINK MOST MOST THINGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN USED LIKE UH CONTROL MULTIPLE DEVICES 
AND UH YEAH INFRARED MIGHT BE AN ISSUE 
UH WELL HE SAID ABOUT N ABO WHAT HE SAID ABOUT POINTING 
BUT UH LOTS OF DEVICES ALREADY USE INFRARED 
SO 
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THAT 
YEAH 
WELCOME BACK 
UH LET ME SEE 
OKAY 
ROO WELCOME BACK 
THE WAITING IS FOR SEBASTIAN 
THREE UH SO 
SORRY 
OH NO 
YOU CAN'T SORRY 
WELL THIS IS LIFE 
SORRY UH OR 
OKAY 
OKAY 
PEOPLE WELCOME BACK WITH THE SECOND MEETING 
UM FOR NOW ON THE SCHEDULE ARE A FEW POINTS 
UH FIRST OF ALL THE OPENING WHICH WE ARE DOING NOW 
UM SECOND I RECEIVED UM SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU RECEIVED THEM AS WELL UM BUT I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT 
UM THEN UM THE OTHER IF YOU UH PREPARED A PRESENTATION I THINK 
SEBASTIAN 
OR 
RED 
ALMOST OKAY 
THEN WE'LL DO YOUR IN UH UH SO L UH THE LAST 
UM THE TOP GOAL OF THIS UM 
UM WE WILL FIGURE THAT IT 
CA CAN YOU TRY TO 
YEAH WE WE WILL SEE 
UM IT IS YEAH 
YEAH 
UM THE TOP GOAL OF THIS MEETING IS TO REACH A DECISION ON THE PRODUCT 
IN THE TARGET GROUP UM AND AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL SO KEEP THAT IN MIND 
UM 
WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES 
SO 
IT'S NOW 
YEP 
OKAY 
UM THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS FIRST OF ALL UM WE DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT BUT WE SHOULD NOT UM SUPPORT TELETEXT ON THE REMOTE 
UM BECAUSE OUR B UM BOARD UH FEELS THAT UH TELETEXT IS OUT OF DATA AND INTERNET IS REPLACING TELETEXT 
SO UM WE ARE NOT EVEN GOING TO TRY TO IM IMPLEMENT IT IN OUR PRODUCT 
IT'S A BOARD DECISION 
UM THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TELEVISION BECAUSE IT'S NOT UH OF UH FEASIBLE 
IT'S NOT UH WE UH UH WE WE CANNOT MAKE IT BECAUSE OF THE TIME TO MARKET UM THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH 
UH THE THIRD REQUIREMENT IS THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN UH FORTY 
WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU UH RED AND AS WELL FOR UH OR 
BECAUSE THE PRODUCT SHOULD UM BE UH INTERESTING AND AND UH SHOULD BE BOUGHT BY PEOPLE YOUNGER THAN FORTY 
UM 
THEN FOR OUR AS WELL UH IMPORTANT THE CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD BE RECOGNISABLE IN OUR PRODUCT 
SO THE COLOUR COLOURS AND THE SLOGAN UM DO HAVE TO BE UH IN THE PRODUCT 
SO THAT COLOUR 
ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS 
REQUIREMENTS 
NO 
OKAY 
UM THE INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS I TH UM OR OR SEBASTIAN WHO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START 
UH UH YEAH 
OKAY GREAT 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
OKAY 
UH RUUD DID YOU GET THAT 
OKAY SO THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS 
IN THE MARKET YEAH 
YEAH OKAY W W WELL SO WE ALL UH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SEBASTIAN 
NO IT'S NOT VISIBLE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
SO IT'S FAIRLY EASY 
OKAY 
OKAY GOOD 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER UM TWO OR FOUR BUTTONS MAKES UH M MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN THE COSTS IF YOU ALREADY PLAN TO UH INCLUDE FANCY LIGHTNING TECHNIQUES 
I GUESS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY RUUD 
OKAY WELL WE ARE WE ARE VERY CURIO CURIOUS TO WHAT THE MARKET UM WILL FEEL ABOUT SUCH A PRODUCT 
SO ANY INCOME IS WELCOME 
INPUT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL THAT'S INTERESTING 
YEAH THAT'S DEFINITELY INTERESTING 
IT UH IT SEPARATES OUR PRODUCT FROM OTHERS UH AS WELL 
OKAY GO ON 
OKAY 
SO THAT'S WHAT THE MARKET TELLS US 
YEP 
OKAY 
YEP 
WELL MAYBE MAYBE LIKE CLAPPING IN YOUR HANDS LIKE UM TURNING ON AND OFF THE THE THE LIGHTS 
REPORTS REP RESPEND RESPONSE TO IT 
BUT UH THE 
YEAH BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A A A A A HOME UM 
OKAY 
SO WHAT ABOUT THE CLAPPING TECHNIQUE 
UM BECAUSE YOU SEE 
WELL YOU USE IT A LOT IN ONE LIGHT UH LIGHTNING UH UH 
YEAH A PEAK 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
WELL UH 
YEAH 
YEAH M MAYBE UM WE WE UH WE DO AGREE ON ON THE THING THAT THE REMOTE SHOULD HAVE SUCH A FUNCTION 
IF IT'S POSSIBLE WITHIN THE COSTS AND ALL THAT KIND OF THINGS 
UM MAYBE SEBASTIAN SHOULD HAVE UH A DETAILED LOOK LATER ON AND UM COME UP WITH A SOLUTION BECAUSE THAT'S HIS HIS FIELD OF EXPERTISE 
MM-HMM 
YEP 
YEAH IT'S A DISTINCTION IN THE MARKET 
IT'S A DIFFERENT EXACTLY 
IT'S NO NO NO UNIQUE FEATURE AND UM I THINK UM IT'S WORTH UM UH LOOKING AND AND PROBABLY MORE I INTERESTING THAN UH THEN THE LIGHTS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL UM ACCORDING TO READ UM PEOPLE DO NOT SO UM ALL THE EXTRA FEATURES VERY VERY OFTEN 
SO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL WE WE DO HAVE A WISE BOARD SO I'M NOT QUESTIONING THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY SO ON THE RELEVANCE SCALE UH THE CHANNEL SELECTION THE VOLUME SELECTION AND THE TELETEXT 
WELL WE SKIP THAT 
OKAY 
NO 
YEAH 
UH UH UH I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR THE USER ONE 
NO 
YEAH 
OKAY RUUD HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
UH DO YOU AGREE DO YOU THINK THE MARKET WOULD WOULD RESPOND TO UH A SIMPLE 
MM-HMM 
MM YEAH 
OKAY SO THIS IS IS KIND OF UH 
YEAH 
BUT BUT ARE WE NOT IN IN THE ON THE MANUAL UH I MEAN IF YOU HAVE FEW BUTTONS ON DISPLAY 
UM I MEAN UH I GUESS IT'S L IT'S WORKING WITH WITH A SHIFT FUNCTIONS AND UM ONE BUTTON CAN UH 
BUT BUT HOW DOES HOW DOES THE REMOTE UH REPORT UH OUR UH GIVE BACK TO THE USER W ON WHAT STATE IT IS 
BECAUSE WE DO NOT IMPLEMENT UH A USER HISTORY 
I KNOW BUT BUT IF WE USE UH LIKE A STICK FOR EXAMPLE UM 
YEAH 
UH AND WE COULD HAVE THREE BUTTONS FOR THE FOR THE ADVANCED UH FUNCTIONS 
YEAH DRAW DRAW IT IN THE BOARD 
YEAH IT CAN BREAK DOWN 
UH-HUH 
OKAY YEAH 
OKAY BUT WE WE STILL WE'RE STILL IN THE QUESTION OF UH UM UH PUTTING AN ADVANCED OPTIONS 
UM RUUD JUST TOLD US UM THE MARKET IS INTERESTED IN SOME ADVANCED UH NEW TECHNIQUES 
UM HOWEVER UH KEEPING IT SIMPLE AS AS IMPORTANT FOR THE COSTS AND ALL ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS 
WE NEED TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN UH THE ADVANCED TECHNIQUES AND AND THE USER FRIENDLINESS 
UM WELL FOR WE DO HAVE TO UH DECIDE THIS THIS MEETING 
YEAH 
WE NEED TO UM HAVE THE UH THE USER FUNCTION UH THE FUNCTIONS DECIDED AND UM 
UH OUR TARGET AUDIENCE 
UM WELL I DO NOT WANT A FULL UH IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO TO HAVE A FULL LIST BUT I WANT UM THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS 
FOR EXAMPLE UH THE THE MOST IMPORTANT OR VOLUME AND UH PROGRAMME SELECTING 
WELL FOR EXAMPLE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT 
L HOW IS THE REMOTE GOING TO LOOK 
NOT NOT IN THE USER INTERFACE BUT 
YEAH 
A BIT OF A SPLIT MODE 
UH L LIKE YEAH 
DUAL CHANNEL WATCH 
OKAY WELL M M MAYBE I SHOULD WRITE THAT DOWN 
UH RUUD UM WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME 
MIELSEN BECAUSE I I WAS WRITING IT DOWN ON THE LAST UH MIELSEN 
RIGHT 
UM I PUT ALL THE MINUTES I MAKE INTO THE SHARED FOLDER 
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND OUT 
UM 
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S IF YOU WANT TO DO IT SEBASTIAN 
OKAY UM 
OKAY SO SO UM UH 
VOLUME 
PROGRAMME 
UH DUAL CHANNEL 
OH 
AND AND DO WE WANT ME 
THE TEN DIGITS 
YEAH 
I AGREE ACTUALLY 
BUT WE DO HAVE THIRTEEN DIFFERENT DUTCH CHANNELS 
OFTEN 
WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE ON THE ON THE LOOKS ON THE ON THE 
YOU C YOU CAN DO MAKE THEM VERY FANCY BY UM 
I MEAN NOKIA THEY HAVE TEN DIGITS ON THEIR PHONES AND IT STILL LOOKS VERY FANCY 
SO I'M I'M I DO NOT AGREE 
OH 
EXACTLY EXACTLY 
OKAY SPEECH 
YEAH 
TO FIND YEAH 
OH 
IF IF WE WOULD UM DROP THE TEN DIGITS BUT KEEP THE PROGRAMME AND THE VOLUME BECAUSE MAYBE PEOPLE DO NOT ALWAYS WANT TO USE THEIR VOICE UM 
YEAH 
BUT WE DO FOCUS ON YOUNGER PEOPLE 
WE DO IT IT'S A BOARD UH DECISION 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY G GOOD 
OKAY 
MM 
YEP 
OKAY 
BUT 
BUT BUT CAN WE MANAGE TO BE UH FOR THE COSTS 
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY 
IS A CRADLE VERY CHEAP 
I KNOW B UH BUT THERE SHOULD BE AN ADAPTER AS WELL 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WE WE HAVE UH ABOUT TEN MINUTES LEFT THIS MEETING 
UM 
I WOULD LIKE IT HERE UM MAYBE MAYBE YOU ALL HAVE THE UH THINGS INTO UM SPOKEN ABOUT YEAH BUT THAT ARE IMPORTANT 
UH RUUD Y YOU CAME UP WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH DATA 
UH OR THREE THREE THINGS ABOUT THE MARKET WE SHOULD KNOW 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO ALTHOUGH WE ARE FOCUSSING ON YOUNGER PEOPLE UH TO MAKE IT UH PROFITABLE UH 
PROFITABLE 
W W YEAH WE STILL NEED TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT THE THE BIT OLDER PEOPLE 
OKAY 
O OKAY 
UM OR 
NOTHING TO ADD 
SEBASTIAN 
YEAH 
GREAT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH AND THAT WAS THE MAIN ISSUE RIGHT 
THE THE BOARD 
YEAH 
THE BOARD 
NO IT'S THE YEAH 
IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND YEAH 
IT SHOULDN'T BE A BIG ISSUE 
OKAY 
I'M NOT SURE HOW HOW WE'LL F UH DETERMINE THE COSTS I WILL HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
MAYBE YOU WILL GET SOME INFORMATION ON THAT 
UM I'M NOT SURE HOW HOW THAT 
YEP 
OKAY GREAT 
UM 
WELL I THINK WE'RE QUI QUITE DONE 
UM FOR NOW WE WILL HAVE THE LUNCH BREAK 
UM I'M DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE BREAK WILL BE BUT WE'LL FIND OUT 
UM THEN WE WILL HAVE THIRTY MINUTES OF TIME TO PERFORM OUR INDIVIDUAL WORK UH AND I'M SURE YOUR PERSONAL COACHES WILL UH ASSIST YOU WITH IT 
UM I WILL PUT THE MINUTES I JUST MADE IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER 
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT UM WELL JUST DO 
UM THE INTERFACE DESIGNER UM I WOULD LOOK AT THE NEXT MEETING I WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE THE UH COMPONENTS CONCEPT 
UH OUR UM FROM YOU I WOULD LIKE TO USE 
OH 
I'M SORRY YEAH I'M SORRY 
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER UH OR I WOULD LIKE TO USE THE USER INTERFACE C UH CONCEPT 
AND UM 
WELL I IT SHOULD BE EASY THAT'S W W WHAT WE CONCLUDED 
IT SHOULD BE AN EASY INTERFACE WITH NOT AS MUCH BUTTONS 
SO JUST A A P A P A VOLUME AND A PROGRAMME IN 
AND UM 
UM YEAH SOME SOME FANCY LIGHTS 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE DECIDED 
NO NO NO WE DIDN'T BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE INTEGRATED YEAH IT'S OF COURSE IT'S USER INTERFACE 
BUT UM I I WAS TALKING ABOUT REALLY THE DESIGN OF THE 
NO 
WE CAN DECIDE THE NEXT MEETING 
YEP 
YEAH 
I GUESS ALL OF YOU HAVE I UPDATED INFO 
I'M SURE THE MARKETING EXPERT WILL RECEIVE UH TO UH YOU WILL DO SOME TREND WATCHING 
AND I'M SURE THE MARKET WILL UM UH 
UH WILL CHANGE ADAPT AND UM SO WE WILL SEE THAT 
UM YEAH THAT'S IT FOR NOW 
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CAN WE HAVE THE LUNCH 
YEAH OKAY 
GOOD 
SO THERE ANY TIME FOR A CUP OF COFFEE 
CAN I GOT A CUP OF COFFEE 
OKAY 
WELL DURING MY WORK I HAVE ONE TIME THERE 
SO 
I THINK SO IT 
IT IS 
IT IS 
YES 
OKAY 
EXCUSE ME 
UM 
OKAY IT'S STILL THE RIGHT THING 
OKAY 
UM WELL THERE ARE SOME CHANGES IN THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS IS THERE ARE SOME CHANGES IN THE METHOD ALSO 
UM BASICALLY ALL THIS DEVICE HAS TO DO IS SEND MESSAGES TO A T. V. SET 
AND THE M MOST EASY WAY TO DO THIS IS BY UH SENDING PULSES OF INFRARED LIGHT TO A T. V. SET 
WELL I TH I TRIED TO UH IMPLEMENT A PICTURE HERE BUT IT'S HARDLY READABLE 
CAN YOU USE IT 
NO 
WELL 
UM THERE'S A ENERGY SOURCE HERE 
AND UM BASICALLY THERE IT'S CONNECTED TO OTHER THINGS 
THE USER INTERFACE CONNECTED TO A CHIP WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE SENDER WHICH GENERATES MESSAGES USING UH INFRARED LIGHT WHICH ARE SENT TO THE RECEIVER 
THAT'S BASICALLY THE IDEA 
AND THERE'S A LITTLE PICTURE JUST FOR YOUR IMAGINATION HOW A DEVICE LIKE THIS SHOULD LOOK OR CAN LOOK 
OKAY 
UM WHAT HAVE I FOUND 
USUALLY THIS KIND OF THINGS CONSIST OF A BATTERY INFRARED DIODE BUTTONS CHIPS AND CIRCUIT BOARD 
THAT'S ALL 
IT'S CASED TOGETHER NOTHING MORE THAN THAT 
IT'S ALMOST EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT UM 
EVERY PIECE OF UH EVERY T. V. SET IS CONTROLLED INFRARED 
THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS BUT MOST OF ALL HAVE UH INFRARED CONTROLS 
AND UH THE MORE LUXURY UH REMOTE CONTROLS HAVE LITHIUM BUTTONS 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE WE YES 
IN THE AND IT'S A LITTLE MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE FANCY ALSO 
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT 
OKAY 
I HAVE A BASIC SCHEME OF THE THINGS UH WHICH ARE IMPLEMENTED 
UM BASICALLY THIS IS ALL THERE IS 
THERE'S JUST ONE CHIP 
THERE ARE A FEW BUTTONS CONNECTED 
UH THE BUTTONS ARE LOT 
AND THE WHOLE THING IS TRANSMITTED BY A INFRARED LI DIODE AND THERE IS NOT A POWER SOURCE HERE 
SO THAT'S BASICALLY THE TOTAL DESIGN OF THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO IT 
IT'S FAIRLY EASY 
IT'S BEEN DONE MANY TIMES BEFORE AND I THINK WE SHOULD UH WE SHOULD C S SUCCEED IN IN OUR PLAN TO DO THIS 
SO 
OKAY SO UH PERSONALLY I THINK WE SHOULD INFRA USE INFRARED BECAUSE UH OTHERWISE OUR DEVICE CANNOT UH COMMUNICATE WITH UH ALMOST EVERY T. V. SET 
SO I THINK THAT UH SHOULD BE CLEAR 
UH ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT IS UH WE REALLY SHOULD USE UH ENERGY UH SPARSE FRIENDLY COMPONENTS 
OH THERE ARE SPECIALLY UH DESIGNED UM ENERGY FRIENDLY COMPONENTS WHICH CONSUME UH FOR LESS POWER THAN UH CONVENTIONAL COMPONENTS 
AND UM IF WE WANT TO USE UH A RECHARGEABLE DESIGN OR UH A ENERGY SAVE DESIGN WE SHOULD REALLY IMPLEMENT THEM 
UM FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS WE SHOULD REALLY IS A VERY LOW COST UH CIRCUIT BOARD 
UM BECAUSE MOST OF THE PRODUCTION COST OR OR IN THIS UH PART OF THE EQUIPMENT 
AND UM THE MONEY WE SAVE ON USING THIS WE CAN USE UH FOR ELABORATE FANCY LIGHTING UH TECHNIQUES BLINKING LEDS AND ALL THAT KIND OF FANCY STUFF 
I THINK OUR UH USERS WILL REALLY UH WILL REALLY LIKE THAT 
NO THEY'RE P F UH POWER FRIENDLY LEDS ALSO 
SO WE CAN USE THEM 
SO THAT'S NO PROBLEM 
OH NO THEY'RE UH THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE BUT BY UH UM UM MAKING 
WE CAN WE CAN MAKE ITS I THINK 
OKAY 
HMM 
YES 
WELL IT'S NOT IN LIGHT OUT THERE ARE MORE LIGHTS ON A IN A IN A MOBILE DEVICE 
NO NO NO NO 
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT 
AS WELL THIS UH SHOULD BE TOO 
UM HAVE A THINK ABOUT IT 
MM 
OR A FIND A FINDING FUNCTION YOU KNOW 
THAT'S QUITE A YES 
YES 
YES 
YES WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT I GUESS 
WELL THE TECHNICAL UH THERE I THINK THERE ARE IN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES 
THERE'S NO UM ELABORATE TECHNIQUE HE SAID IN THIS UH KIND OF EQUIPMENT 
SO UM I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY HICCUPS THERE 
SO WE CAN FULLY CONCENTRATE ON DEVELOPING A PRODUCT THAT IS REALLY UM WHAT THE MARKET NEEDS 
SO MAYBE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO THINK ABOUT THESE BUTTONS AND AND UH AND A SOUND SIGNAL 
WELL 
YES 
TH THAT'S A BIT OF THAT'S A PROBLEM 
USUALLY 
OH YES 
YES 
WELL THERE THERE ARE SOME DEVICES WHO UH INCORPORATE THIS TECHNIQUE ALREADY 
UM THERE ARE VIDEO SETS AND UM THEY HAVE A SPECIAL BUTTON THE FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL BUTTON 
YOU PRESS IT AND YOUR T. V. SET STARTS TO MAKE A UH KIND OF WEIRD SOUND AND YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROLS THEN START TO BEEP 
AND UM 
YES 
YES THAT'S IT 
YES SAME THING 
NO SO WE WE SHOULD USE SOMETHING ELSE 
WE DO NOT CONTROL THE T. V. SET AS WELL 
YES UM YES 
SO AND WE B WE WANT TO MAKE SO IT'S IS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS SO WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT 
IT'S QUITE COMPLICATED 
WELL IT'S QUITE COMPLICATED 
BECAUSE HOW CAN YOU SEPARATE THE CLAPPING SOUND FROM OTHER SOUNDS 
YES YES 
WELL BASICALLY THE CHARACTERISTICS UH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CLAPPING IS JUST AN INCREASE IN THE VOLUME 
THE AMPLITUDE OF THE SOUND WHICH IS UH GENERATED A FEW TIMES WITHIN A UH CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME 
BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER SOUNDS UH WHICH ARE EXACTLY THE SAME FROM THE POINT OF VIEW FROM A REMOTE CONTROL 
YES SO WE DON'T WANT THAT 
MAYBE WE CAN 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WELL SO THERE NOT SOMETHING IF SOMETHING MORE EASILY 
WELL I DON'T THINK UH 
NO 
AND YOU THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR PEOPLE USE THAT THERE'S A CENTRAL POINT AT WHICH THEY CAN GO AND UH B UH PERFORM A A SOME KIND OF UH 
AND THEN UH THE REMOTE CONTROL UH REPORTS ITSELF SO WE WE SHOULD USE HAVE UH WE SHOULD USE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YOU DO NOT WANT ANOTHER DEVICE WHICH CAN BE UH EVERYWHERE IN THE HOUSE WHICH YOU HAVE TO FIND FIRST BEFORE YOU CAN FIND YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
YES SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT THAT WILL BE VERY COSTLY I THINK 
SO THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA 
MM-HMM 
I WILL 
YES 
YES 
BUT UM BEFORE I DO THAT I W I WANT TO WARN YOU THAT UH BY IMPLEMENTING THIS KIND OF A FUNCTION THE TECHNICAL DESIGN WILL BECOME MORE COMPLICATED UM AND IT WILL BECOME MORE COSTLY ALSO 
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS WHICH WHICH UH WILL BE USED 
AND THERE ARE SOME IMPLEPE IMP 
WELL I I THINK SO BECAUSE UM WHEN YOU HAVE A P NEWSPAPER OVER YOUR REMOTE CONTROL YOU CANNOT USE IT 
SO 
OKAY 
NO NO 
SO THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION 
SO 
I THINK ALSO 
YES 
WELL 
WE SHOULD SAVE COSTS UH BY NOT IMPLEMENTING A LOT OF FUNCTIONS AND UH THE MONEY THAT WE CAN SAVE FROM THAT WE SHOULD USE FOR UH HAVING A NICE DESIGN AND UH THINKING ABOUT THE USER INTERFACE AND 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
MM 
OKAY 
WELL SO IT MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER POSSIBILITY 
YOU CAN MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AN EASY S PIECE OF EQUIPMENT BUT IT'S QUITE ELABORATED UH BECAUSE IT HAS MANY FUNCTIONS 
MAYBE IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A VERY UH FRIENDLY EASY TO CATCH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT BUT UM NEVERTHELESS 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OK LIKE THAT 
WELL I WAS MORE THINKING ABOUT A MORE ELABORATE WAY OF CONTROLLING BY BY THESE KINDS OF STICKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I DON'T KNOW IF IF IT'S USER FRIENDLY 
THAT'S YOUR FIELD OF EXPERTISE 
MM-HMM 
THERE'S NO BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE CANNOT IMPLEMENT THAT KIND OF THE SYSTEM 
WE 
MM-HMM 
WELL MAYBE WE CAN USE A LIGHT FOR THAT 
WHEN YOU MOVE THE STICK TO A IT A POSITION MAYBE UH A LIGHT NEXT TO IT CAN LIT UP 
SO YOU KNOW I'VE JUST UH PUSHED THE BUTTON OR I CHANGED THE CHANNEL OR AT UH TURNED UP THE VOLUME 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YES 
OH YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IT'S NOT REALLY A STICK BUT 
YES 
YES 
HMM 
YES YES 
AND 
YES AND THIS ALSO LOOKS MORE FANCY I THINK 
I THINK IT IT WILL ATTRACT UH 
MORE UH UH PUBLIC I THINK 
BUT YOU'RE THE MARKETING MAN 
OKAY THAT'S GOOD 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
DO DO YOU WANT A LIST OF FUNCTIONS 
DO YOU WANT AN EXPLICIT LIST 
UH WHICH UH INCORPORATES ALL FUNCTION AVAILABLE IN THE DEVICE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES 
CHANGE 
YES YES 
YES 
WELL YOU'RE THE SECRETARY 
MM OKAY BUT MAKE A S MAKE A SUB FOLDER FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S STARTING TO FILL UP ALREADY 
SURE 
YES THAT'S IMPORTANT 
WELL OR OR YOU SURE 
I'M NOT SO SURE 
WELL THAT'S COMPLICATED BUT IS THAT IS RELEVANT 
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ABOUT YOU SHOULD UH SH YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT 
IF IT WERE SO 
OKAY I CAN IMAGINE WHEN 
I CAN IMAGINE WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU HAVE A SATELLITE DECODER AND AND YOU HAVE WELL ABOUT SIX HUNDRED CHANNELS I CAN IMAGINE YOU WANT THIS 
BUT IF YOU'RE UH A REGULAR T. V. USER AND YOU JUST WANT UH TO WATCH THE THE DUTCH TELEVISION NETWORKS 
WELL YOU CAN UH YOU CAN USE UH ABOUT TEN BUTTONS 
THAT'S ENOUGH 
WELL BUT HOW HOW OFTEN DO YOU WATCH ALL THESE CHANNELS 
NO YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT 
OKAY 
BUT I THINK THIS UH TEN UH BUTTONS LIKE A BIT DULL 
DON'T YOU THINK 
THE DESIGN 
OKAY 
WELL YOU THEN THERE SHOULD BE SHOULD DONE BE DONE SOMETHING SPECIFIC WITH IT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO YOU CAN EXPERIMENT BY UH WITH WITH SHAPE OR WITH SIZE OR WITH COLOUR THAT KIND OF THING 
OKAY 
WELL MAYBE IT CAN BE COMBINED WITH THE FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO UM WHEN YOU ADD UH SPEECH RECOGNITION TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL UH IT'S VERY EASY TO CHANGE UH THE CHANNEL 
THAT'S ONE THING 
AND IT'S VERY EASY UH TO FIND YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
SO MAYBE THAT'S A POSSIBILITY BUT I'M AFRAID IT WILL BE A BIT COSTLY 
BUT MAYBE WHEN WE UH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL 
I I THINK IT SHOULD UH SHOULD WORK IT SH WE SHOULD MANAGE THAT 
YES 
WELL THE VOICE RECOGNITION HAS THE MAIN ADVA HAS ANOTHER ADVANTAGE 
IT'S MAS IT MAKES IT VERY EASY FOR US TO IMPLEMENT THE FIND UH FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL BUTTON UH REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTION 
SO THAT'S THAT'S A BIG ADVANTAGE I THINK 
THERE'S ONLY ONE DISADVANTAGE UH BY IMPLEMENTING THIS 
UM THE POWER SAVING POWER SAVING WILL BE A BIT MORE DIFFICULT 
SO WE CAN EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE A LESS LONGER LIFE TO THE BATTERIES 
BUT MAYBE CAN WE WE CAN THINK SOMETHING SMART ABOUT IT 
THERE ARE SOME UH HYBRID HYBRID DEVICES WHICH INCORPORATE A SOLAR PANEL AND RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES 
SO WHEN YOU JUST LEAVE THE DEVICE IN A IN A LIGHT ROOM IT CHARGES ITSELF 
YOU HAVE TO DO NOTHING FOR IT 
MAYBE MAYBE NOT 
I'LL HAVE TO FIND THAT IT 
YES 
SO 
NO THAT'S VERY CHEAP 
IT'S UH IT'S VERY CHEAP 
THAT'S NO PROBLEM 
IT'S JUST A A CASE WITH TWO UH METAL CONTACTS 
IT'S 
YES BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE MASS PRODUCTION 
THEY'RE VERY CHEAP 
SO IT WILL COST US P PRACTICALLY NOTHING 
YEAH 
PROFITABLE 
UM I JUST WANT TO MAKE A SUMMARY OF ALL ALL THINGS UH SPOKEN AND UH THE DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES 
UM 
SO UH BASICALLY WE'VE DECIDED TO IMPLEMENT A SEEMINGLY UH EASY DESIGN 
SO ON THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKS EASY BUT UH WE CAN MAKE IT EASY ON THE INSIDE OR ELABORATE ON THE INSIDE 
SO THAT'S IN THE THESE ARE THE CHOICES WE HAVE TO MAKE 
BUT I THINK THERE'S A BIG ADVANTAGE IN MAKING IT MORE ELABORATE BY UH IMPLEMENTING UH SPEECH TECHNIQUES UH VOICE RECOGNITION THAT THESE KINDS OF THINGS 
UM IT MAKES IT ALSO MORE UH ATTRACTABLE I THINK IT OR UH AUDIENCE 
UM THERE ARE SOME ADVANTAGES AND SOME DISADVANTAGES AND THE MAIN ADVANTAGE IS THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT UH FANCY TECHNIQUES WHICH UH I THINK OUR CUSTOMERS WILL LOOK 
THE DISADVANTAGE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT UH THE THE COSTS AND UM THE THINGS LIKE UH BATTERY LIFETIME ENERGY SAVING 
UH ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS THAT THE CIRCUIT BOARD WILL BECOME MUCH MORE EASIER IF WE DO NOT DO NOT IMPLEMENT THESE BUTTONS 
IF WE JUST ADD UH UH A CHIP WHICH DOES THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH OUR CIRCUIT BOARD WILL BECOME EVEN MORE CHEAP 
SO THAT'S ANOTHER WELL IT W IT W IT WAS AN ISSUE BUT WE ALSO THOUGHT THAT WE ALREADY THOUGHT WE SHOULD DO IT AS CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE 
AND THIS EVEN UH MAKES IT MORE CHEAPY 
SO 
MM-HMM 
THE CIRCUIT BOARD 
THE FEWER BUTTONS YOU HAVE THE CH CH THE CHEAPER THE CIRCUIT BOARD YES 
AND IT'S VERY CHEAP UH TO INCORPORATE UH UH AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT A CHIP 
SO THAT'S 
THAT'S ANOTHER ADVANTAGE 
SO 
YES BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW 
YES 
I D I REALLY DON'T KNOW 
SO 
IT CAN BE COSTLY 
MAYBE NOT 
YES 
YES I LI I I HOPE MY PERSONAL COACH WILL UH HAVE A L UH LOOK AT IT 
HOW NICE 
WELL WE UNDERSTAND 
WELL 
MM YES 
SO WE DROP THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
OR UH 
OKAY 
WELL UM DO WE REALLY HAVE TO DECIDE NOW OR CAN WE DECIDE NEXT MEETING 
OKAY 
BECAUSE I'LL HAVE SOME UPDATED INFO ON THAT UH 
ADAPT 
WE CAN HAVE THE LUNCH 
HELLO 
THERE'S ONE OF MINE 
HELLO FLORES 
WE HAVE A SLIGHT PROBLEM 
I OPENED UH THE C. D. ROM BOX UH GUYS 
SO JUST CANCEL IT 
YEAH I OPENED THE C. D. ROM BOX 
ACCIDENTALLY 
BUT IT'S ALRIGHT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
BUT YOU CAN'T UPLOAD YOUR PRESENTATION FROM HERE I BELIEVE 
OKAY 
I DON'T THINK IT'S WIRELESS HERE 
OR TO USE 
YEAH 
OKAY GREAT 
YEAH 
TIME YEAH 
YES 
YEAH I'LL START 
UM 
UH HOW CAN I UH 
GEEZ AND SLI AND SHOW 
UM 
JUST UH PRESS IT 
OH YES 
ALRIGHT 
UM WELL WE WE UH WE HAD DISCUSSED THIS ALREADY ON THE FIN IN THE PREVIOUS UH DISCUSSION 
UH THE METHOD OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS JUST THE FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS BASICALLY TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET 
SO THAT WAS 
THE MENU UH IMPORTANT THING WHAT A REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD DO 
THEN I FOUND UH TWO DIFFERENT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROLS THE MULTI FUNCTION UH REMOTE CONTROL WITH MANY POSSIBILITIES 
BUT UM THE LACK OF THE FEELING I ALREADY MENTIONED UH IN THE PREVIOUS UH DISCUSSION 
AND THE EASE OF USE REMOTE CONTROL WITH UH THE LESS P POSSIBILITIES BUT A GREAT FEELING IN IN TOUCHING THE BUTTONS 
UM BUT UM YEAH 
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES WERE EASE OF UH THE EASY TO USE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE UH THE USER FRIENDLINESS AND UH IT CAN BE MORE TRENDY IN IN USER DESIGN 
BUT UM YOUR NEW GOAL OF WAS FOR UH PEOPLE THAN LESS THAN FORTY YEARS OLD 
SO MAYBE UM THE MULTI FUNCTION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN UH IN OUR DESIGN 
BUT IT SHOULD BE I THINK IT SHOULD BE A COMBINATION BUT TELETEXT BUTTONS ARE NOT UH IN OUR DESIGN 
SO IT SHOULD UH 
TAKE IT WILL EIGHT BUTTONS ARE SO 
BUT MY IN MY OPINION THE THE EASY TO USE R. C. S UH THE BEST UH POSSI POSSIBILITY FOR US 
YEAH 
AND IT'S ALSO I INDEED UH UH RUUD'S UH INSIGHT IN THE ON THE TOPIC 
YEAH WHAT WHAT DOES THE MARKET WANT 
I I DON'T KNOW 
JUST FOR UH FOR USER DESI UH USER UH FRIENDLINESS I UH SHOULD CHOOSE FOR THE THE EASE OF USE REMOTE CONTROL 
SCUSI 
ENERGIES AND UH 
YEAH 
THE GLOW IN THE DARK UH CONCEPT UH WE DISCUSSED 
SUCCEED IN IT ALSO 
AND WHAT'S THE UM IF WE USE THE LEDS I DOES IT AS MUCH MORE ENERGY OR 
OKAY 
FOR THE SAME COSTS IT'S CAN BE UH ONE OR 
COMBINED WITH THE LOW COST CIRCUIT BOARD SO IT'S UH 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK 
YEAH I THINK IT'S THE SAME AS IN THE CELL PHONE JUST LIGHT ON ON THE DEVICE THAT THAT SHINES ON ALL THE BUTTONS AND NOT FOR 
YEAH BUT NOT FOR EACH BUTTON ON LED I THINK 
COULD YOU STOP A LITTLE BIT MORE AT THE RIGHT 
YEAH THANK YOU 
YEAH 
SOUND SIGNAL 
YEAH 
THE VOLUME AND UH THE ZAP BUTTONS ARE THE MOSTLY USED 
SO 
YEAH WELL IT SHOULD JUST HAVE A DESIGN 
THE PERFECT DESIGN FOR THIS ONLY THOSE BUTTONS 
AND FIRST UM 
YEAH 
YEAH THE SOUND SIGNAL 
JUST ONE THING I'M JUST WONDERING THE SOUND SIGNAL FROM WHERE DO YOU EXECUTE TH THE S SOUND 
ANOTHER DEVICE IS NOT A SOLUTION 
IT SHOULD BE UH UH 
YEAH BUT MAYBE YOU'LL UH GET SOME NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR IT 
YEAH JUST LIKE UH THE PHONES THE 
BUT BUT T. V. S DON'T HAVE ALL UH 
UH BUTTONS 
OH 
BUT I BELIEVE YOU WILL HAVE NO 
I'M CONVINCED UH SEBASTIAN WILL UH FIND UH ONE SOLUTION FOR US 
BUT WE CAN HAVE JUST UH UH A HOME STAT UH OF A BASE STATION NEXT TO THE T. V. 
JUST A LITTLE ANTENNA OR UH SOMETHING 
WELL IF YOU LOST THE I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD BOTHER WALKING TO THE T. V. AND PRESS THAT BUTTON BECAUSE THEY LOST THE OTHER REMOTE 
OH THAT'S JUST UH 
JUST A BASE STATION NEXT TO THE T. V. S THE BEST POSSIBILITY 
YEAH 
AND DO WE EVEN UH PREFER THE SOUND ABOVE THE THE LEDS THE LIGHTNING UH 
FUNCTION 
IT'S A UNIQUE ITEM UH 
IT WILL BE IN A UNIQUE FEATURE OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
YEAH 
AND JUST ABOUT UH THE USER INTERFACE I CAME UP WITH UM AN EASY REMOTE CONTROL AND AN ADVANCED REMOTE CONTROL 
WHAT SHOULD WE CHOOSE ONE IN DESIGN 
WELL THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS 
USED OPTION 
WELL SO IT JUST THE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS 
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO USE IT FOR D. V. D. PLAYERS UH AND ALL KIND OF STUFF 
SO 
YEAH 
JUST THROUGH UH THE EASY UH DESIGN 
WE CAN MAKE UH A NICE DESIGN WHEN WHEN THERE'S NOT UM UH MUCH BUTTONS ON IT 
SO 
UH JUST A FEW BUTTONS TRENDY DESIGN NICE LIGHTNING EFFECTS WH AND THE SOUND 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW YET 
BUT DOES IT UH I THIN SHOULD IN JUST USE UH I INSTEAD OF THE STICK 
UH LIKE MANY CELL PHONES JUST A ROUND UM WELL SHOULD WE JUST AS A 
UM IT'S ALREADY UH UH WE HAVE A BLANK 
OH 
IT'S JUST AN EASY UH WAY OF OF A ROUND BUTTON WHAT WHICH CAN BE PUSHED IN FOUR DIRECTIONS 
INSTEAD OF A STICK 
A STICK IS V VULNERAB VULNERABLE 
WHEN IT'S FALLING DOWN OR UH JUST A ROUND UH BUTTON SHOULD BE THE TRICK I THINK 
YEAH 
GEEZ 
WELL VOLUME AND 
SOMETHING UH 
LIKE THAT 
THE PROGRAMME UP AND DOWN 
AND THE VALUE YEAH THE PEN DOESN'T UH REALLY DOES WHAT I WANT 
BUT I THINK OUR OUR NEXT STEP TO LOOK AT IS JUST THAT 
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S UM WE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO 
UH WE CAN'T DISCUSS IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IN IN ONE OF US HAVE HAS THE INFORMATION TO DISCUSS ABOUT THAT 
I THINK 
YES 
MM-HMM 
'KAY BUT TELETEXT IS IS UH IS JUST SCRAPPED 
THE TEN DIGITS 
UH AND JUST ONE FUNCTION 
THE THE THE THE PROGRAMME TO PROGRAMME BUTTON THE SWITCH TO UH TWO CHANNELS 
WHEN YOU HAVE UH SOMETHING ON CHANNEL FOUR AND SOMETHING ON CHANNEL SIX JUST ONE BUTTON WHICH WHICH CAN UH CHANGE YEAH 
YEAH 
ALRIGHT 
OR B. S. C. UH W. UH 
THE TEN DIGITS 
YEAH I BELIEVE SO 
YEAH 
I WOULDN'T BUY IT PERSONALLY 
A REMOTE CONTROL WITHOUT THE TEN DIGITS 
UH AND I THINK THE MOST 
JUST ELDER ELDER PEOPLE WOULD WOULD BUY IT BUT 
YEP 
THE OLDER PEOPLE ONLY USE FIVE OF THEM 
YEAH 
IN THE DESIGN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO WE HAVE TO I TO MAKE UM A DECISION BETWEEN THE TEN DIGITS OR THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
MM-HMM 
TWELVE DOLLAR FIFTY 
I HAVE NOTHING UH NOTHING TO ADD I THINK 
BUT THE CHEAPER THE CH UH THE THE CHIP OR THE WHAT WAS IT 
THE CIRCUIT BOARD 
THE FEWER BUTTONS YOU CAN SEE ON IT 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH 
WELL IT THEN WE SHOULD JUST UH TAKE A LOOK AT THE COSTS AND UH ESPECIALLY FOR THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
NO 
WE'RE DONE I THINK 
UM ANOTHER 
INTERFACE INDUSTRIAL 
YEAH 
UH THE ONLY PROBLEM IS IT THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE DIVISIONS THE DECIS UH DECISIONS SEBASTIAN MAKES 
BUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
WELL 
YEAH 
YEP 
ADAPT 
THAT'S IT 
'KAY 
I'LL TAKE THE LUNCH 
HELLO 
ALMOST 
UH IF IT IF IT IF IT'S WIRELESS I COULD JUST UH PUT IT IN THE 
OH OKAY 
YEAH UH B UH MOST 
UH USER FRIENDLY 
WELL YOU COULD ONLY LIT UH THE BUTTONS THE BUTTONS THAT ARE USED MOST 
SO THE CHANNEL SWITCHING 
OR 
HMM TRUE 
OH MINE IS ALREADY OUTDATED 
SINCE UH 
OKAY MAKE 
WELL 
UH THEN I'M SURE THE TARGET MARKET IS UH TEN MILLION UNITS 
IF IF WHICH WE SHOULD SELL ABOUT UH FORTY PERCENT TO MAKE THE FIVE MILLION 
BUT UM SINCE UH THE OTHER PART IS UH FORTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET I UH THOUGHT EARLIER WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSTRAIN THAT PORTION OF THE MARKET 
BUT UH SINCE UH THE REQUIREMENTS CHANGED THAT'S UH NOT A GOOD IDEA 
UH WELL SKIP THIS 
WELL IT'S THIS TILL TRUE OF COURSE 
THAT THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT THE BUTTONS 
THE BUTTONS TO ZAP ARE USED THE BUT UH FIFTEEN HUNDRED TIMES WHEN UH THE POWER BUTTON IS ONLY USED IN TIME 
AND THE VOLUME BUTTON'S ONLY FOUR TIMES 
SO THEY'RE OBV OBVIOUSLY UH THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS 
AND UH LOTS OF PEOPLE COMPLAINED THEY KIN CAN'T FIND THEIR REMOTE CONTROL 
SO WE MIGHT WANT TO BUILD IN A FEATURE TO UH SUPPORT THEM 
SOME UH AUDIO SIGNAL 
LIKE UH HOME PHONES 
OR 
YEAH 
WELL I JUST SAID THAT 
AND UH WELL THIS OBVIOUS AND UH ALSO SAID IT 
OH THAT'S ABOUT IT YES 
UH UM UH ZAP BUTTONS MOST 
VOLUME THEY ARE UH AS A LOT 
BUT 
MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER BUTTONS 
SO 
YEAH THAT'S UH A PROBLEM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND YOU 
YEAH AND USUALLY 
AND EVEN IF THE T. V. SET WOULD HAVE SUCH A BUTTON UH YOU WOULD HAVE TO WALK TO YOUR T. V. AND IT'S 
AND BE 
SO IF IF YOU'D BE WATCHING A MOVIE IT WOULD CONSTANTLY BEEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I HAVE THE NUMBERS OR I HAVE THE NUMBERS RIGHT HERE 
WELL IT UH WE WON'T SUPPORT TELETEXT WHICH WHICH WAS THE THIRD MOST THE SECOND MOST USED FUNCTION 
UH WELL YEAH CHANNEL SELECTION IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST IMPORTANT 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
SO 
NOPE 
UH WELL IF WE UM INCLUDE OTHER UH INNOVATIVE 
FUNCTIONS UH THEN THEY UH MIGHT 'CAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE UH LIKE NEW FEATURES 
SO 
AND IF YOU SEE THAT STICK FOR VOLUME CONTROL AND CHANNEL UH SELECTION YOU HAVE THE UM TWO MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS IN IN UH BUTTON 
YEAH 
A YOUNGER UH-HUH 
AND IT'S ALSO QUITE EASY TO USE SO IT'LL IT UH ATTRACT YOUNGER PEOPLE BECAUSE WELL NOW AND IT MIGHT ATTRACT OLDER PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO USE 
MIELSEN 
YEAH 
WELL IF YOU WANT TO GO TO CHANNEL NINETY AND YOU HAVE THE THAT BUTTON 
WELL 
BUT 
YEAH AND IF IF WE 
AND IF WE ARE TARGETING AT THE YOUNGER AUDIENCE THEY WILL PROBABLY WATCH MORE CHANNELS THAN THE OLDER PEOPLE 
SO 
WELL 
AND 
AND UM THERE ARE SOME NUMBERS BUT UH SPEECH RECOGNITION HERE THAT UH YOUNGER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT 
UH IT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE AND UH HARD TO IMPLEMENT BUT IT WOULD BE A SOLUTION UH 
FOUR 
YEAH 
ESPECIALLY ELDER PEOPLE UH DON'T LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION 
SO THEN WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT SUCH A BIT 
YES 
UM 
AND UH IF WE IF WE COULD INC UH INCLUDE A C A CRADLE IN WHICH IT COULD RECHARGE 
THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE UH A BIG PROBLEM 
'CAUSE WHEN 
YEAH 
UM I THINK WE DEALT WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION 
JUST THAT THE YOUNGER PART OF UH THE MARKET ISN'T THE FORTY PERCENT WE UH 
WANT TO SELL IT 
SO WE WE SHOULD UH FOR LOST A BIT UH LOOK AT THE UH OLDER PEOPLE 
BUT WITH UH BUTTONS LIKE THAT WHICH ARE EASY TO USE WE UH MIGHT ATTRACT THEM OUT 
SO 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM 
YES 
YEAH PROFITABLE 
YES 
HMM 
LEFT 
YEAH 
DO YOU NEED TO CHANGE ANYTHING ON IT 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE I WILL ALREADY OPEN IT 
OKAY 
SO TOO MUCH CHANGES 
UH I DIDN'T NO NO 
I DO HOT HAVE 
ONLY THE SAME INFORMATION 
HELLO SEBASTIAN 
I BELIEVE UH MISS UH TENTEL IS WITH US AS WELL IN THE CONTROL ROOM 
UH IT'S THAT ARE AGAIN ALWAYS LATE 
BONGIORNO 
HMM 
I SEE SOME INTERESTING OKAY 
PEOPLE WELCOME BACK 
THE THIRD MEETING 
UM I HAVE SOME POINTS I WOULD LOOK AT UH SOME SOME ISSUES I WOULD LIKE TO PAINT IT 
UM FIRST OF ALL UM IF YOU MAKE MINUTES YOURSELF AS WELL UH LIKE SEBASTIAN DOES UM COULD YOU PUT THEM IN THE SHARED FOLDER 
IF YOU DO NOT MAKE MINUTES NO PROBLEM BUT IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SEE WHAT YOU UH WRITE DOWN 
SO I COULD UH CAN UH UM SO THAT IN THE ON THE REPORT 
UM THE SECOND THING UM 
I WAS THE UH S THINKING IT MYSELF I HAVE THIS LITTLE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND I'M TALKING TO IT BUT I STILL NEED TO POINT AT THE TELEVISION BECAUSE IT WORKS WITH INFRARED 
THAT'S QUITE STRANGE 
OKAY 
WE'LL COME TO THAT LATER I G I THINK 
UM THE AGENDA FOR NOW UH UH ARE THERE ANY PRE DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 
OKAY 
UM WE WE WE WILL HAVE YOUR INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS UH THEN THE DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPT UM AND UH THE CLOSING 
FORTY MINUTES IN TOTAL FOR THIS 
SO UM I THINK WE WE CAN IMMEDIS IMMEDIATELY START WITH THE INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS UM THE PROGRESS YOU'VE MADE 
UM I THINK IT MIGHT BE SMART TO LOOK AT UH RUUD'S UM INFORMATION FIRST BECAUSE I UNDERSTOOD THERE ARE SOME UH SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MARKET SITUATION 
UM YEAH 
UH W WAIT A SEC WAIT A S UH COULD YOU GO TO THE PREVIOUS SLIDE 
UM BECAUSE I'M TAKING MINUTES AND IT 
UM WERE THE IMPORTANT THEMES ENCLOSE 
YEAH OKAY 
THE FEEL OF TO BE SPONGY 
OKAY SO SO YEAH IT MIGHT NOT BE TO UH IT IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD 
IT IT MAYBE IT RUBBER OR OR YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
WELL THAT'S INTERESTING 
YOU COULD MAKE A FEW V VERY COLOURFUL ONES AND UH A VERY TRADITIONAL CO COVER 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH IT IS IT SO I YEAH 
YEAH 
DO YOU KNOW THE PHONE 
IT'S THE SIEMENS UH C. TWENTY FIVE I BELIEVE IT'S IT'S THE ON THE POST BANK UH GAVE AWAY THE VERY 
YOU KN YOU KNOW RUUD AS WELL 
BUT THE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
UM OH OKAY 
DO YOU HAVE UH THAT THAT WAS OKAY 
OKAY SO THE THE UM UH IMPORTANT FINDINGS ARE UH INNOVATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EASE OF USE FOR THE OUR TARGET GROUP 
AND UM COLOURING IS IMPORTANT AND AND UH SOFT MATERIALS 
OKAY 
OKAY OR 
COULD YOU DO YOUR PRESENTATION 
OKAY WELL IT'S GOOD TO TO SUM UP UH THE THINGS WE ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT 
SHAPE 
YEAH 
AND WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT MAYBE UM WE SHOULD MAKE VERY LIGHT BUT UM UH A GROUP UM I MEAN THIS IS HOW YOU HOLD A REMOTE CONTROL 
UM IT SHOULDN'T BE TO UH GLATT TOO SLIPPERY S BECAUSE UM 
YEAH 
YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH 
YEAH EX FOR YOUR FINGERS YEAH 
YEAH 
IT GRIPS AUTOMATICALLY 
YEAH OKAY 
OKAY GOOD 
YEAH 
WAY TOO MUCH I THINK FOR OUR GOAL YEAH 
OKAY B BUT I THINK WE'LL YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL IT WOULD BE VERY NEW TO THE MARKET BUT 
YEAH 
I THINK UM IF IF I CAN HOOK ON IT THAT UM THE KINETIC THING IS VERY FUNNY 
I MEAN SOLAR EASE OF COURSE IT'S NICE BUT IT'S WELL YOUR UH YOUR CALCULATOR HAS A SOLAR PANEL 
UM HAND DYNAMO 
WELL MAYBE UM 
YEAH I KNOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND WHO 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY BECAUSE I GUESS THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE U CONSUMES QUITE A F UH A LOT OF POWER 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WELL 
THIS WILL BE THE REMOTE RIGHT 
UM WITH UH MAYBE A CHANNEL SELECTOR 
WHAT ABOUT 
INTEGRATING A SCROLL BAR ON THIS SIDE 
BECAUSE THIS IS HOW YOU KEEP IT 
VOLUME 
WELL WHAT ABOUT MUTE 
TH I I AM I GUESS UH TH THIS IS MY VOLUME BUTTON 
AND I CAN EITHER IN THIS SIDE OR THIS SIDE UM 
AND CLICK IT TO MUTEN THE DEVICE 
AND AND IT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM THE TRADITIONAL UH DEVICES IN THIS MARKET 
SO I'M LOOKING FOR A WAY IT 
UH MAKE IT A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE TRADITIONAL ONES 
SO MAYBE UM I GUESS THAT THAT'S SOMETHING YOU TWO UH NEED TO THINK ABOUT 
UH RUUD WHA WHAT DO YOU THING ABOUT UH A SCROLL BAR 
UH SCROLL WHEEL 
OKAY 
YEAH 
WELL ALL THE SONY TELEPHONES USE IT FOR EXAMPLE FOR VOLUME 
NOKIA HAS A WELL OKAY IT'S NOT REALLY A SCROLL WHEEL 
BUT IN OTHER SIDE THE THE THE VOLUME BUTTON IS IN THE SIDE BECAUSE YOU GRI GRAB IT LIKE THIS 
YEAH 
I KNOW IT'S NOT REALLY A SCROLL WHEEL 
NO 
YEAH 
FOR YOU TO YEAH 
OKAY 
SEBASTIAN 
UM 
YEAH 
IT PERFORMS THE ACTION 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH WELL UH D DID WE ALREADY DECIDE ON THE DISPLAY 
IT 
NO 
ON SCREEN DISPLAY 
YEAH 
OKAY THE 
OKAY 
GOOD 
KINETI OKAY 
OKAY IT'S MAYBE A BIT TOO TOO FLASHY TOO YEAH 
YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S THE SAME WITH THE SOLAR CELL 
THAT'S IN DIFFERENT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
NO NO BUT THE UH UM THAT'S WHAT SEBASTIAN SAID 
HE SAID UH THIS IS WHAT UH THIS IS MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE 
BUT BUT YET I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MARKET IS DIFFERENT 
SO UM 
ONE OR RUBBER WITH COLOURS 
COLOURFUL AND 
YEAH 
BUT BUT DO WE WANT THE CURVED UH UH DESIGN OR 
I IT'S TOO DULL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY WHAT ABOUT UM THE ISSUE I AM ADDRESSED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING 
UM THE VOICE FUNCTION W WITH THE INFRARED UH ISSUE 
BECAUSE IT IT'S OF COUR 
YEAH 
WELL 
IT DEPENDS ALSO IN YOUR IN YOUR 
WELL IT DEPENDS ON YOUR WALLS ACTUALLY 
IF YOU HAVE UH HAVE UM SMOOTH WALLS IT IT IT PROBABLY YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT 
BUT IF YOU HAVE CARPETS ON THE WALL WHICH ARE NATURAL LOVING FRIENDS PROBABLY DO HAVE 
THEN UM YEAH TH TH IT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE OF A ISSUE 
SO 
YEAH 
I LIKE THE SCROLL WHEELS UH DO 
YEAH 
WELL IT LOOKS UH YEAH WELL UM ACCORDING TO READ THE THE THE MARKET LIKES UM NEW FLASHY TECHNOLOGY 
AND I MEAN L. C. D. S WELL OK I KNOW BUT IT'S UM IT'S LESS UM SO STANDARD THEN THEN 
WELL WE ARE NOT VERY W WE DO NOT KNOW UH MUCH ABOUT THE THE OF THE FINANCIAL PART 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
BECAUSE IF WE DO HAVE ENOUGH UM SPACE IN IN OUR FINANCE I WOULD SAY DO INTEGRATE IT BECAUSE 
IT IT ADDS A LITTLE EXT EXTRA HIGH TECH FEELING TO IT 
MM YEAH 
OKAY OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY I I AGREE 
I THINK I READ DO YOU HAVE ANY UM ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE IT 
UM DID OR OR MAYBE THOUGHTS OR 
NO 
SEBAST UH ONE OR 
OR DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER 
NOTHING MORE 
UM 
SEBAS 
WELL WE WE NEED TO DESCRIBE UH DECISIONS NOW 
SO UM IN THE ENERGY WELL WE DECIDED 
CHIP 
THE CASE UH RUBBER WITH UH C IN IN UH ONE CURVE 
USER INTERFACE UM 
UM THEN THE CORPORATE IDENTITY SHOULD BE UH IN THE PRODUCT 
I GUESS THAT IS SOMETHING FOR OUR AND SEBASTIAN 
UH YOU TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE THE COLOURS GREY AND YELLOW 
KEEP IT IN MIND 
AND UM THE BUTTONS WILL WE TALKED ABOUT IT NOW 
THE NEXT PHASE UM SEBASTIAN UM SO UM THE DESIGN OF THE LOOK AND FEEL 
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
AND FOR YOU THE PRODUCT EVALUATION 
UM I'M SURE YOUR PERSONAL COACH WILL GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THAT 
UM AND UH THE I. D. AND THE U. I. D. AND TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE PROTOTYPE DRAWING ON THE SMARTBOARD 
AND I'M GOING UH TO PLAN MY HOLIDAYS 
YEAH IT'S IT'S UH WHEN WE COME BACK IN THIRTY MINUTES UH YOU WILL HAVE A UH PROTOTYPE READY 
YEAH 
I CAN 
UM MAYBE IN IF YOU COULD WRITE IT DOWN 
GREAT 
UM 
UH Y YOU NEED TO HELP ME 
UM 
THE CASING IS CURVED SINGLE CURVED 
TRADITIONAL BATTERIES UH AND SOLAR 
NO THEY CAN BE COMPLEMENTARY 
UH L LI I UH 
EVERY DEVICE 
YEAH 
OKAY UM THE 
BATTERY AND SOLAR YEAH 
YEAH WITH COLOURFUL RUBBER 
UH IF IT'S POSSIBLE WITH UH DIFFERENT UM COVERS BUT I'M NOT SURE IF OUR SUPPLIERS CAN UH CAN HELP US WITH UH WITH SUCH UH UH A WISH 
UH GREY AND YELLOW OR BLACK AND YELLOW 
YEAH 
YEAH ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY COLOURFUL 
EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW OF COURSE BUT UM I COULD THINK OF A MORE UH ATTRACTIVE UH C UH SET OF COLOURS 
WELL I WAS MORE THINKING ABOUT THE FRUIT COLOURS THAT THE RUUD SHOWED US BEFORE 
WELL IT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RED 
UH I MEAN THE UH I THINK THESE COLOURS ARE REALLY WHAT ARE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR 
UM SO MAYBE IT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE TWO COLOURS 
IT SHOULD BE A FULL COLOUR COVER WITH SUCH AN IMAGE OR OR I MEAN THINKING ONE TWO COLOURS SO SO TOO BLACK AND WHAT FOR OUR UM UH C UH MARKET GROUP 
I GUESS 
BLACK AND YELLOW YEAH 
OKAY SO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH WH WHAT'S POSSIBLE HERE 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM MORE OF MORE MORE DECISIONS WE MADE 
UM 
UM 
THE SCROLL HEEL 
YES THE VOICE RECOGNITION WE ALREADY DECIDED 
YEAH 
UH I'M GOING TO LEAVE THAT UP TO YOU TWO 
YEAH 
I THINK RUBBER IS NICE 
BECAUSE IT UH I I MEAN WHAT DO YOU TOUCH THE BUTTON AND WHAT DO THEY WANT SPONGY UH UH DEVICES OR OR I 
UH SO THAT HE DOES OUR OUR SUPPLIER SAY SO 
YEAH 
YOU COULD PLACE A UM UH THIS THIS WOULD BE THE BUTTON 
THE SCROLL WHEEL I MEAN 
AND YOU COULD PLACE 
THE INDICA TH TH THE SIGNALS THE 
NO NO THERE'S NO PAINTING ONLY UH YELLOW OR 
BUT IT'S NOT THE RUBBER 
YEAH BUT THIS IS IN THE PLA YEAH I KNOW 
UM I THINK UH I KNOW WHICH YOU UNDERSTAND AF UH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
WHAT ABOUT UM MAKING THIS RUBBER 
AND MAKING THIS PLASTIC 
YEAH 
WELL ACTUALLY WE SHOULD HAVE TO THE OTHER WAY AROUND I GUESS 
A PLASTIC COVER WITH RUBBER FINISHING 
I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS THE FINISHING 
THIS IS UM WHAT'S ON THE DOG 
WHAT YOU FEEL 
BUT THE FRONT 
IN WHICH THE THE BUTTONS ARE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RUBBER 
I MEAN 
I KNOW BUT DO YOU TOUCH THIS OR DO YOU TOUCH THIS 
I MEAN I I NEVER TOUCH BETWEEN THE BUTTONS 
YEAH THE SIDE EXACTLY THE SIDEWAYS 
THE SIDE BUT DO YOU TOUCH BETWEEN THE THE THESE BUTTONS 
OKAY 
WELL WE DO NOT HAVE VERY MUCH TIME UH LEFT 
UM I GUESS YOU TWO HAVE TO FIGURE THAT IT 
I'M GOING TO LEAVE THE DECISION TO YOU UM BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE ITS PROTOTYPE 
AND UM YEAH YOU YOU HAVE THE MOST KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SUPPLIERS THE POSSIBILITIES AND UH SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE AT THE DECISION WITH YOU 
UM SEBASTIAN DID YOU WRITE ENOUGH DECISIONS DOWN 
YEAH 
OKAY 
WITH THOSE REGULAR CHIPS WE CAN STILL UH CONTROL ADVANCED FUNCTIONS 
THE CHIP IS IS NOT REALLY 
OKAY WELL 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM OKAY THEN I THINK WE ARE UH QUITE FINISHED 
UM I'LL SEE YOU GUYS IN THIRTY MINUTES AND UM 
YEAH 
YEAH UM IF YOU WRITE WROTE ANYTHING DOWN UH COULD YOU PUT IT IN THE SHARED FOLDER 
YEAH 
I KNOW BUT WELL 
GREAT 
RIGHT 
HELLO HELLO MISTER P. M. 
WELL THAT'S WHERE THE THINKING GOES ON 
I THINK YOU SHOULD PUNISH HIM 
YOU'RE THE P. M. 
POSSIBILITIES YEAH 
YES 
SO 
NOT AT ALL 
OKAY 
JUST PRESS THE OKAY BUTTON IT WORKS 
HOW SURPRISING 
OH WAIT UH WAIT UP 
UH SO DO YOU THINK UM WHEN FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE IMPORTANT FOR CLOTHING AND SHOES THAT THEY ARE IN REMOTE CONTROLS ALSO 
NOT SOMETHING DULL 
OKAY 
BUT CAN YOU CAN YOU GO BACK TO THAT SLIDE 
THE UH JUST ONE SLIDE BACK NO NO NO 
YES 
OKAY AND THE FEEL OF THE MATERIAL HAS TO BE SPONGY 
HAS TO SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT UH NATURAL FEELING ALSO DO YOU THINK 
OKAY 
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING 
YES 
I DON'T KNOW THE PHONE BUT I CAN IMAGINE IT 
UH THAT ONE YES 
NOW I KN UH UH I KNOW I KNOW 
YES I I'VE SEEN IT 
I'VE SEEN IT 
SO SO SO IF IS IS IMPORTANT BUT TECHNOLOGY IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT 
AND WHAT WAS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT 
OKAY 
SO THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR OUR CUSTOMERS 
MM-HMM 
BUT IT'S IT'S KIND OF UH IT'S KIND OF O ORGANIC SO THAT'S VERY GOOD 
YES 
SLIPPERY 
YOU HAVE TO GRAB IT 
YES 
THERE ARE THERE ARE ALSO REMOTE CONTROLS WHO HAVE UH A LITTLE SHAPE UNDERNEATH WHERE YOU CAN PUT YOUR FINGERS IN 
SO YOU CAN GET A REALLY GOOD GRIP ON IT 
SO YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO UM ATTAIN MUCH PRESSURE TO IT 
IT'S IT'S A LOT EASIER 
SO UM 
YES 
BUT I'LL I'LL GO INTO THAT DEEPER IN MY PRESENTATION 
OKAY BUT I'LL I'LL GO INTO THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE ARE SOME POSSIBILITIES AND SOME IMPOSSIBILITIES 
UM I HAD A TALK WITH UH OUR MANUFACTURING UH DIVISION AND UH WE HAD A TALK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS UM WHO ARE IN THIS DESIGN 
UH THESE ARE THE THINGS WE'VE LOOKED AT 
AND OF COURSE I SAID THE WEB TO UH FIND MY INFORMATION 
BUT THE CASING WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT CASING POSSIBILITIES 
WE HAVE THE UNCURVED OR FLAT CASE 
OH THAT'S THE MOST COMMON UH REMOTE CON CONTROL FROM UH WE'RE USED IT IS JUST A IT JU IT'S JUST A BOX 
I'M SORRY I I DON'T HAVE ANY PICTURES OF UH OF THIS THING 
WE HAVE UH A CURVED ONE 
IT'S UH CURVED ONE TWO DIMENSIONS 
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IT'S A BIT LIKE A WAVE FORM 
SO IT'S UH A LITTLE MORE ADVANCED IN ITS IN ITS SHAPE 
UH AND WE HAVE AN EVEN MORE ADVANCED UH SHAPE WHICH IS CURVED IN THREE DIMENSION 
I C I THINK YOU CAN COMPARE IT A LITTLE BIT WITH THE UH BIG GREY IMAGE UH YOU HAD IN YOUR PRESENTATION 
THE THE BIG REMOTE CONTROL SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT IT'S QUITE UH ADVANCED AND IT'S 
IT'S QUITE DARING TO TO SEE I THINK 
UM FOR THESE CASINGS WE HAVE UH DIFFERENT TYPES OF FINISHING 
WE CAN USE PLASTIC WHICH IS UH VERY SLIPPERY AND MAYBE NOT SO ONCE 
BUT YOU CAN GIVE IT ANY COLOUR UH WHICH IS THE SAME FOR RUBBER BUT IT'S NOT SLIPPERY 
WE CAN USE WOOD AND TITANIUM 
WELL UM WE CANNOT USE THE TITANIUM ON THE DOUBLE CURVE CASES 
AND THESE LATEX CASES THERE'S THERE'S JUST THE PLASTIC ONES UH WON'T ALLOW THE EASE OF SOLAR CELLS AS AN ENERGY SOURCE SOURCE 
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE DIFFERENT ENERGY SOURCES 
UM WELL WE EVEN SEEM TO HAVE UH HAND DYN DYNAMOS FOR UH POWERING OUR UH REMOTE CONTROLS 
YOU REALLY HAVE TO IMAGINE LIKE WINDING UP YOUR UH I D 
IT WOULD BE VERY NEW BUT IT'S A KIND OF A RETRO UH STYLE I THINK 
UH WELL THIS IS QUITE INTERESTING 
UH THERE'S THERE'S ALSO A KINETIC ENERGY SUPPLY 
SO UM WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. UH OR WHEN YOU'RE YOU YOU HAVE TO M MAKE SOME KIND OF ENERGY KINETIC ENERGY BY SHAKING THE REMOTE OR THROWING IT AGAINST THE WELL 
WHATEVER YOU WISH 
TO HAVE TO IT HAS TO MOVE THAT'S THE THE SENSE OF IT 
AND YOU CAN STORE THE ENERGY IN THE ON THE THING 
MM-HMM 
IT'S VERY FUNNY INDEED 
MM-HMM 
INDEED 
MM-HMM 
YES 
BUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW FROM YOUR OWN WATCH YOUR WATCH USES UH A MINIMAL CON IT CONSUMES A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF ENERGY 
THE THE SHAKING OF YOUR BODY WHICH IS ALMOST UH EVERY ACTIVITY MAKES YOUR UH BODY SHAKE UH IT CHARGES IT 
BUT UH THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IT IT SUPPLIES A A VERY LITTLE AMOUNT OF KINETIC ENERGY 
SO I THINK UH YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVIE AND UH YOU HAVEN'T MOVED THE REMOTE UH I REMOTE CONTROL IN A N N AMOUNT OF TIME 
AND YOU WANT TO TO SWITCH UH THE CHANNEL OR SOMETHING WELL UM IT MIGHT NOT WORK 
SO THAT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND 
SO BUT MAYBE MAYBE THERE'S A POSSIBILITY COM TO COMBINE IT WITH UM UH TRADITIONAL BATTERIES 
SO WE CAN SAVE ON THE BATTERIES AND UM WHEN THERE'S ENOUGH KINET KINETIC ENERGY IS THE KINETIC ENERGY AND OTHERWISE IS THE BATTERIES 
OH YES IT DOES 
I'LL COME TO THAT LATER 
AND WE OF COURSE HAVE THE TRADITIONAL UH SOLAR POWER 
WHICH IS JUST UH UH UH UH UH A PIECE OF MATERIAL ON THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH TRANSFERS LIGHT ENERGY INTO ELECTRICITY 
THE USER INTERFACE CONTROLS UM OF COURSE WE HAVE THE PUSH BUTTONS AND UH WE ALSO HAVE SCROLL WHEELS 
AND THIS SCROLL WHEELS CAN ALSO BE INTEGRATED WITH BUTTONS 
SO IT'S JUST LIKE A MOUSE 
YOU CAN SCROLL 'EM YOU CAN ALSO PUSH IT 
UM UH IN THE INDICATORS WE HAVE THE L. C. D. DISPLAYS 
WHICH MEANS UH YOU CAN WATCH UH IN A DISPLAY W WHICH CHANNEL YOU HAVE CHOSEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF THE LI AMOUNT OF VOLUME WHICH IS UH CURRENTLY UH AND WE ALSO HAVE DOUBLE SCROLL BUTTONS 
WHICH ARE JUST TWO OF THESE THINGS 
SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE THE KIND OF BUTTON WE HAD IN MIND IN OUR UH UH IN OUR LAST MEETING 
THE THE THING WITH THE THE AROUND WITH THE FOUR 
YES 
THAT IS POSSIBLE TO 
YES 
MM-HMM 
WELL MAYBE UH WELL UM UM ANOTHER 
MAYBE WHEN YOU INTEGRATE SOME FUNCTIONS 
UH IT'S D IT'S DONE BEFORE 
YES 
IT'S QUITE QUITE GOOD YES 
WELL IT'S TOO WELL I WHAT HE MEANS SO THERE'S ONE BUTTON INTEGRATED IN THE SCROLL WHEEL 
THERE'S NO SCENARIO WHERE YOU USE UH THE BUTTON ON THE SCROLL WHEEL 
YOU JUST USE THE WHOLE 
BUT MUTE 
WELL YES 
OKAY 
YES 
WELL OKAY 
WELL THAT THAT THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY OKAY 
WELL OKAY 
IT'S QUITE GOODS 
MM-HMM 
YES 
HMM 
BUT IT'S DONE BEFORE UH THERE ARE MANY OTHER DEVICES UM LIKE UH TELEPHONES AND OUR UH RADIO POCKET RADIOS 
WE USE THIS 
AND 
WELL IT'S IT'S BEEN DONE YEARS AGO AND I DON'T USE IT ANYWHERE NOW 
SO MAYBE IT'S NOT IN 
HMM 
YES BUT IT USES TWO SEPARATE BUTTONS 
IT DOESN'T USE A 
WELL 
UH SOMETHING FOR UH ARE HERE 
W WITHIN REACH 
YES YOU HAVE TO 
YES 
YES 
YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY UM WE HAVE TO KNOW IF YOU WANT TO USE UH THIS RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED C UH CASE UM YOU MUST USE THIS PUSH UH PUSH BUTTONS 
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN INTEGRATE L. C. D. DISPLAYS 
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN INTEGRATE SCROLL WHEELS BECAUSE IT'S ALL CURVED 
THERE'S THERE ARE IN UH FLAT AREAS WHERE YOU CAN INCORPORATE THESE THINGS 
SO THAT'S A LIMITATION 
BUT UM THE COMPONENTS UH JUST THE HARDWARE 
WE BASICALLY HAVE UH THREE TYPES OF CHIPS WE CAN USE AND UH THESE CHIPS INCORPORATE ALL THE LOGIC AND UM UM UH HARDWARE THAT IS NEEDED TO SEND UH TO SEND A SIGNAL 
UH WE HAVE A SIMPLE REGULAR AND ADVANCED CHIP 
AND THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE A SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER WHICH IS A LITTLE CRYPTIC UH TO ME 
BUT I THINK THAT'S THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING THAT WE ARE UH THINKING ABOUT 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO SO OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO THAT'S BASICALLY THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION ITEM WE WERE SEARCHING FOR 
OKAY 
THIS SAMPLE SENSOR UH REQUIRES AN REGULAR CHIP I THOUGHT 
UM NO OP I'M NOT VERY SURE 
NO IT'S NOT AN HOUR 
IF WE WANT TO USE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY WE REALLY NEED THE ADVANCED VERSION WHICH IS A BIT L LITTLE BIT MORE COSTLY 
IF WE WANT TO USE THE SCROLL WHEELS WE NEED THE REGULAR VERSION 
AND IF WE DON'T WANT TO USE UH ANY OF THIS UH MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS WE CAN KEEP WITH THE SIMPLE UH CHIP WHICH IS A BIT CHEAPER 
OKAY 
UM NO BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING FOR UH ARE HERE 
TO THINK ABOUT 
I I DON'T THINK THERE 
NO 
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO 
OKAY 
OKAY WELL MY CONCLUSION UM UNFORTUNATELY THE MARKET HAS DECIDED THE A LITTLE UH OTHER THAN I THOUGHT 
I THOUGHT UM THE MARKET WOULD LIKE UH A SORT M SORT OF TITANIUM CASING BUT THEY SEEM TO LOOK NATURAL UH STUFF 
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT UH WOOD FINISH 
UM I'VE CHOSEN THE MORE BATTERY WITH SOLAR CELL UH SOLUTION FOR THE ENERGY 
IT'S MORE RELIABLE IT'S CHEAPER 
SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD USE THE DYNAMO THING 
THE KINETIC THING IT IT'S IT'S A POSSIBILITY 
IT'S IT'S MORE ADVANCED BUT I'M I THINK YOU SHOULD COMBINE IT WITH BATTERIES 
OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT TOO ADVANCED UH WELL 
IT'S IN IN IN SOME WAY IT CAN GIVE US IN ADVANCE BECAUSE YOU WILL SAVE ON YOUR BATTERIES 
BUT 
YES 
AND I THINK IT'S MORE ROBUST 
IT'S MORE UH 
UH IT'S MORE FUNCTIONAL 
THE TITANIUM THING UH 
WE HAVE TO SKIP IT 
SO I THINK WE SHOULD SKIP THE TITANIUM UH STUFF AND WE SHOULD UH USE WOOD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OH OKAY SORRY 
SO IT IT NEEDS TO BE RUBBER 
OKAY 
OKAY SPONGY MATERIALS 
OKAY UM WELL UM THIS SCROLL WHEELS I THINK UH THEY THEY CAN BE THEY CAN BE HANDY 
SO 
YES THEY CAN 
BUT THEY REALLY NEED THE REGULAR CHIP YOU CANNOT USE THE S SIMPLE 
WELL I'M NOT VERY SURE 
MAYBE THAT'S AN UH A DIFFERENT 
I THINK SO IF YOU IF YOU STICK WITH THE THE SIMPLE UH STRAIGHT FORWARD UH NOT CURVE DESIGN I UH IT'S TOO DULL 
I DON'T THINK C OUR CUSTOMERS WILL LOOK AT 
AND UM IF YOU UH TAKE THE DOUBLE CURVED UH THEN YOU CANNOT UM YOU CAN ONLY USE THE RUBBER BUTTONS AND YOU CANNOT USE THE SCROLL WHEELS 
SO I THINK THIS IS THE BEST OF TWO WORLDS 
YES 
IT'S IT'S UH I UH I CAN IMAGINE IT'S VERY DULL TO TALK TO A DEVICE WE IF YOU HAVE TO POINT TO ANOTHER DEVICE 
IT'S VERY UNLOGICAL 
WELL TH THERE HAS TO BE SOME POINTING OUT 
BUT 
ALL LIGHTS GET ABSORBED YEAH 
YES BECAUSE THE WALLS THEY THEY REFLECT THE INFRARED LIGHT 
SO IT HAS NO IT'S EASIER 
UM I SUGGEST WE USE THE THE SENSOR SAMPLE 
UH THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER 
UM WITH A WITH A REGULAR CHIP 
I THINK UH IT GIVES US THE ADVANTAGE OF 
YES YES 
AND UH SKIP AND SKIP THE L. C. D. PART 
I DON'T THINK IT IT'S ANY UH VALUE ADDED THING 
SO 
OKAY 
TECHNOLOGY 
YES 
IT'S NOT VERY FLASHY AND NOW 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES 
UH I THINK OUR CUSTOMERS WILL GO INSANE 
IT'S IT'S TOO MUCH 
OKAY 
UH THE ON THE NEXT PHASE WILL BE UM 
THE UM INTO THE WHAT IS THE NEXT PHASE F FLORES 
OKAY 
SO I 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY OKAY 
YES THEY CAN WORK 
THEY CANNOT WORK WITH DOUBLE CURVED 
THAT'S THAT'S PROBLEM 
I'LL CHECK IT FOR YOU 
YES 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SO YOU WILL BE IN THE BAHAMAS 
OH 
OKAY 
SO CAN YOU UH GIVE US A SUMMARY OF ALL UH DECISIONS WE'VE MADE 
I'LL DO 
OKAY 
WE START WITH THE CASING 
OKAY SINGLE CURVED CASE 
OKAY 
WHAT ABOUT THE ENERGY SOURCE 
I I THINK THEY CAN 
YES 
WELL UH 
IT IT SHOULD BE 
THERE SHOULD BE REALLY NO PROBLEM 
THEY CAN BE SUPPLEMENTARY 
THAT'S NO PROBLEM 
SO 
SO UH UH JUST UH THE ENERGY SOURCE IS UM THE BATTERIES AND THE SOLAR 
OKAY 
WHAT ABOUT UH THE FINISHING OF THE CASE 
WE HAVE DECIDED WE WANTED TO USE THE RUBBER 
OKAY AND I THINK WE SHOULD USE THE COMPANY COLOURS 
SOMETHING LIKE BLACK AND RED 
UH BLACK AND YELLOW 
GREY YELLOW OKAY 
UH I THINK IT'S UH IT'S NOT VERY DULL 
IT'S QUITE MODERN ACTUALLY 
DON'T YOU THINK 
HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY BUT UH I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO PRINT A PICTURE IN UH THE DEVICE 
BECAUSE UH I AGREE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE DEVICE ITSELF 
BUT 
OH I'VE READ 
YES 
YES BUT OUR MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT IS NOT AS ADVANCED IN ITS UH TECHNIQUES 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY VERY SLOW IN ITS TECHNIQUES 
SO 
SO I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT POSSIBLE 
OKAY SO SCROLL WHEEL 
BUT THERE WILL BE SOME ADDITIONAL BUTTONS I GUESS 
AND THE THE THEY SHOULD BE SPONGY ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE RUBBER TOO 
WELL UH YOU CAN AS WELL WHEN YOU USE THE BUTTONS THEY'LL THEY'LL BE MADE OF RUBBER TOO 
SO IT HAS THE THE SPONGY UH FILE ALSO 
SO I I THINK THAT'S OKAY 
YES 
THAT'S OKAY 
YES THE SIGNS 
UH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN 
WELL MAYBE THAT'S POSSIBLE BECAUSE UM UH OUR MANUFACTURING DIVISION ALSO OFFERS PLASTIC FINISHING 
SO MAYBE THEY CAN COMBINE THESE TWO 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL I'M I'M NOT SO SURE I THINK IT C SHOULD BE 
WELL I'M NOT SURE I HAVE TO ASK WITH MANUFACTURING BUT I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT 
BECAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR THE SPONGY FEEL AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WITH RUBBER 
SO IF YOU WANT THE SPONGY FEEL YOU AND UH TO MAKE THESE BUTTONS ALL ALL OF RUBBER 
I THINK BOTH 
I D 
I THINK 
OKAY 
UM NOT QUITE 
UM WHAT ABOUT 
UH THE CHIPS 
WE USE THE REGULAR CHIP 
OKAY 
AND 
WELL NO I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT 
YES 
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ADVANCED AND THE REGULAR VERSION IS THAT THE ADVANCED UH VERSION OF THE CHIP SUPPORTS L. C. D. 
THAT'S ALL 
AND WE'VE DECIDED NOT TO USE L. C. D. 
SO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
I'LL PUT IT ONLINE 
BONGIORNO 
PUNISH 
YOU WISH 
WELCOME 
OH 
YEAH 
NO 
ALRIGHT 
BUT THEY LIKE DARK COLOURS YOU SAID IN THE P 
OKAY 
WELL THEN I SUGGEST THAT THE CORPORATE COLOURS OR GREY AND YELLOW 
I HAD 
ARE WE COULD MAKE UH 
YEAH O O 
I'M THINKING ABOUT UH THE BANANARAMA TELEPHONE UH TELEPHONE FROM UH SIEMENS 
THE YELLOW UH RUBBER TELEPHONE 
IT'S THE IT'S THE RUBBER UH 
COVER 
AND IT'S UH COLOURFUL 
IT LOOKS LIKES A BANANA 
WE HAVE THE FRUIT WE HAVE THE COLOURS 
WE HAVE THE SIMPLE DESIGN 
UM THIRTY FIVE 
AND THE B THE LIGHT BLUE AND IT'S ALSO IN YELLOW 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
WELL I DON'T UH REALLY HAVE MUCH TO ADD UM BECAUSE MOST OF THINGS WE ALREADY SAID IN UH 
THE PREVIOUS UH DISCUSSION 
UM 
UH THE PREVIOUS IDEAS WERE VOICE RECOGNITION AND UH THE ROUND BUTTON FOR UH THE UP CHANNEL PROGRAMMING AND UH VOLUME 
WELL A FEW INTERFACE I UH I FOUND IN THE INTERNET OR OR THIS 
THESE ARE BOTH WITH UH WITH VOICE RECOGNITION BUT THEY'RE VERY ADVANCED AND VERY HIGH TECH AND JUST UM WELL A WORD UM 
SHAPE 
SO I SUGGEST I COULDN'T UH I HAD A SMALL UH MOCK UP UH SIGN IN THE ONE PAPER 
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK 
MY PEN DIDN'T LOAD UM THE INFORMATION 
SO I MADE A REALLY SIMPLE OF UH A SHAPE ON UH IN UM 
POWERPOINT 
BUT WE COULD MAKE UH A ROUND UH AN OVAL UH UM REMOTE CONTROL 
UH YELLOW 
BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE UH THE SIEMENS PHONE IT'S RUBBER 
SO IT'S EASY ON YOUR HAND UH INDEED 
YEAH 
GREAT 
UH AND UM TO ADD IN UM RUUD'S INFORMATION ON THIS UM INTERFACE WE CAN HAVE UH HIGH TECH WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND UH 
WELL THE THE FANCY COLOURS AND UH AND SO ON AND STILL HAVE THE EASE OF US BECAUSE WE HAVE AN EASY INTERFACE 
AND ALL THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS ARE HIGH TECH NO BUTTONS AND UH AND SO NO 
YEAH 
SO IF YOU HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION YOU CAN YOU CAN PROGRAMME LIKE THIRTY UH UM 
THIRTY C UH CONTROLS ON IT 
YEAH 
RIGHT 
GREAT 
LIKE THE WATCH 
BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVIE HOW MANY TIMES UH YOU TAKE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL AND END OF UH IF YOU HAVE A WATCH 
YOU HAVE THE KINETIC UH DO IN A WATCH ALSO 
YOU YOU WALK AND UH BUT UH Y YOU'RE SITTING ON A CACHE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
UH WE CAN JUST MAKE FOUR PUSH BUTTONS ON A FORM OF A ROUND 
BUT I TH I DON'T THINK UH THE SCROLL WHEELS I HAD SOME I HAD SOME INFORMATION ABOUT IT IT 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY POSSIBILITY FOR US TO USE SCROLL WHEELS 
I D I CAN'T USE UH ANY UH SCENARIO WHERE YOU WOULD USE A SCROLL WHEEL WITH A BUTTON ON IT 
YEAH 
YEAH UH THAT'S A POSSIBILITY BUT 
BUT FLORES 
THINK ABOUT A SCENARIO WHERE YOU WHERE YOU WOULD USE THE SCROLL BUTTON FOR 
A VOLUME OKAY 
YEAH 
WHEEL 
YEAH I BELIEVE UH IF YOU HAVE UH WHAT WE'VE EARLIER SAID UM THE GROUP UH PLACES IN IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
YOU HAVE YOUR HAND ON ONE PLACE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL SO YOU HAVE TO PLACE ALL THE BUTTONS ON A RANGE OF YOUR THUMB 
SO ON THAT CASE UH THE VOLUME BUTTON ON THE SIDE UH OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE PERFECT 
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN UM I HAVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT IT 
UH IN THE VOICE RECOGNITION YOU SAY A WORD YOU CAN PROGRAMME WORDS LIKE UH V UH VOLUME UP 
OF MUTE LET'S SAY MUTE 
UM YOU PROGRAMME IT 
YOU M MUTE AND YOU GO YOU GIVE ME IN UH AN ACTION TO TO THAT THAT'S REALLY THE MUTE FUNCTION AND UH WHEN YOU SPEAK IN THE THE REMOTE CONTROL 
IT REPEATS UH YOUR SAYING 
SO THAT'S THE SAMPLE SENSOR 
SO IF YOU SAY MUTE IT SAYS MUTE AGAIN AND THEN IT'S UM WELL I BELIEVE IT'S UH 
YEAH AND THEN HE HE HE REPEATS ITS ACTION WHAT WHICH HE BELIEVES IT IS 
SO YOU SAY MUTE HE REPEATS MUTE AND YOU MAKES A COMPUTER SOUND MUTE AND THEN GOES TO THE MUTE FUNCTION 
YEAH 
WELL I DON'T HAVE UM I HAVEN'T LOOKED FOR UH FOR INFORMATION ABOUT IT 
BUT I DON'T THINK INFORMATION UH Y I DON'T THINK YOU NEED IT IN A DISPLAY 
ESPECIALLY WHEN WHEN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A COST 
I DON'T THINK UH 'CAUSE UH UH ALL ANY T. V. CAN UH CAN UH VIEW A DIGIT ON UH ON SCREEN YEAH 
BUT WHAT ABOUT UM THE MARKETS 
HE WANTS COLOURFULS 
UH DESIGNS 
SO IF YOU USE TITANIUM 
OKAY 
OH SORRY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND I WOULD THINK 
AND THEY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITH A REGULAR CHIP 
OKAY BUT WE ALSO UH WE ALREADY AND THE REGULAR CHIP FOR THE SIMPLE UH SENSOR SPEAKER UH VALUE 
BUT MOST INFRARED UH REMOTE CONTROLS DON'T HAVE TO BE POINTED AT ALL 
WELL IF YOU IF YOU TAKE YOUR HAND BEFORE IT OKAY IT WON'T WORK BUT YOU CAN POINT TO JUST TO THE OTHER WELL 
YEAH 
AND THE REGULAR CHIP 
AND AND THE SCROLL UH SCROLL WHEELS 
YEAH 
NO 
THINK SO IT 
BUT WE ALREADY HAVE THE SCROLL WHEELS THE SP UH THE SPEAKER UH THE SPEAK RECOGNITION THE RUBBER 
THE FANCY COLOURS 
UM ONE 
NOTHING MORE 
UH BUT UH CAN'T SCROLL WHEELS UH WORK WITH AN UH ONE CURVED CASE 
YEAH OKAY 
SORRY YEAH 
OH SORRY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THE PROJECT DRAWING IS FOR THE NEXT 
YEAH RIGHT 
SINGLE CURVED 
BUT CAN EITHER BE UH WOR CAN THEY WORK TOGETHER 
OR DO WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM 
'CAUSE IF WE HAVE TO CHOOSE YEAH 
OKAY 
WHAT IF NOT 
OKAY 
YEAH 
GREY AND YELLOW 
YELLOW CASE AND GREY BUTTONS I THINK 
I BELIEVE THE 
BUT YOU HAVE ALREADY UM YOU MUST HAVE A RED UH ONE AND OFF BUTTON 
AND UM 
WELL WELL 
WELL THERE IS 
JUST A WEEK AGO A KEYBOARD MANUFACTURER WOULD PRINT WITH AND UH 
NO 
A SCROLL WHEEL 
VOICE RECOGNITION OF COURSE 
WHAT WHAT DID YOU SAY 
YEAH 
YEAH OR YOU COULD USE PLASTIC BUTTONS 
IN THE RUBBER 
YEAH B 
BUT THEN YOU JUST HAVE THE THE FACT THAT UM THE DRAWINGS ON THE BUTTONS WILL DISAPPEAR EVENTUALLY 
WHAT I SAID IN THE ON THE FIRST UH DISCUSSION UH THE DIGIT SIX ON THE BUTTON IT WILL DISAPPEAR WHEN IT'S FROM RUBBER 
IT IS NOT UH SOMETHING UH IT'S AN INFORMATION I READ ABOUT IT OR SO BUT IT'S JUST FROM 
NO BUT BUT UH IT 
YEAH B YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT THEN YOU HAVE STILL THE IMAGES ON THE RUBBER OF THE CASE 
SO STILL THEN IF YOU FEEL UH L UH IF YOU FEEL YOUR REMOTE CONTROL YOU JUST RUB ON THE COVER SO YOU RUB ON THE PAINTING 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT BUT THE THE PLUS OR THE MENUS 
YOU HAVE TO DRAW THE 
YEAH IT'S IN THE COVER 
SO IF YOU UH 
YOU JUST MOVE THE PROBLEM 
YOU UH CAN YOU SEPARATE THESE UH THIS 
I D 
OR THE S UH THE SIDEWAYS 
OR THE THE BACK 
OR THE BACK 
I THINK 
YES ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE L A FEW BUTTONS ON IT YOU HAVE UH A LOT OF SPACE TO TOUCH 
SO YOU JUST HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND COMPLETELY OR OR I YOU PLAY WITH IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
REGULAR 
SO WITH 
FOR THE FINISHING TOUCH 
OH YEAH 
BUT UM 
SEBASTIAN HAS EVERYTHING 
UM 
MM DON'T THINK SO 
UNLESS UH THINGS HAVE SUDDENLY CHANGE AGAIN 
UH DON'T KNOW 
MAYBE UH YOU'VE GOT NEW INFORMATION LIKE UH LAST TIME 
OKAY 
UP 
NO 
'KAY 
HMM 
OH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MY METHOD 
WELL FINDINGS 
OH 
SO IF IS IS IMPORTANT BUT UH INNOVATION IS MORE IMPORTANT AND A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL IS UH EVEN MORE IMPORTANT 
AND UH SOME FASHION WATCHERS HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THE YOUNG TARGET GROUP LIKES FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 
IN THEIR UH CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE AND THAT THEY WANT SPONGY MATERIAL 
PROBABLY WATCH TOO MUCH SPONGE BOB 
UH THE OLDER GROUP UH STILL PREFERS DARK COLOURS 
SIMPLE SHAPES UH M MATERIAL 
BUT WE SINCE WE ARE CONCENTRATING ON UH 
THE YOUNGER GROUP 
'KAY 
WELL UH AN EXAMPLE GIVEN WAS THIS IS UM I ASSUME THEY JUST WANT SOMETHING COLOURFUL 
NOT UH SPECIFICALLY UH AN APPLE AS A REMOTE CONTROL OR SOMETHING 
NO UH THE YOUNGER GROUP LIKES UH MORE COLOURFUL 
OH 
OBJECTS 
BUT 
WHICH ONE 
THIS 
YES 
UH WELL IT MIGHT 
BUT PERSONALLY I WOULDN'T LIKE A SPONGE AS A REMOTE CONTROL 
BUT 
MAYBE SOFT MATERIAL OR SOMETHING 
BUT NOT A REAL SPONGE 
YEAH EXACTLY 
YEAH AND LIKE UH THE OLDER GROUP LIKES FAMILIAR MATERIALS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD USE WOOD 
SO 
WELL THIS THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE 
BUT SINCE WE'RE CONTEN CONCENTRATING ON UH THE YOUNGER GROUP 
I THINK WE SHOULD USE SOFT MATERIALS 
AND UH MAKE IT COLOURFUL OR UH LIKE CELL PHONES EXCH EXCHANGEABLE COVERS 
SO WE COULD PROVIDE 
BOTH FOR THE YOUNG AND THE OLD WHAT THEY LIKE 
I'VE SEEN IT BUT 
'KAY 
OH THAT'S ABOUT IT 
YES 
UH SOFT MATERIAL 
UH THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
YES 
APPARENTLY 
YEAH 
UM 
UH WELL IT'S OBVIOUS OBVIOUSLY NOW 
SO IT MIGHT ATTRACT UH THE YOUNG CUSTOMERS 
HMM 
AND YEAH TH YEAH THE OLDER PEOPLE LIKED WOOD 
IN THE 
YEAH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE LIKED SOFT MATERIAL 
YEAH 
YEAH 
STANDARD 
NAH UM NO NO I DON'T THINK SO 
UM 
OR BLACK AND YELLOW 
YEAH 
HE DIDN'T DID WE INC UH INCLUDE THE DIGI DIGITS OR UH LEAVE THEM AT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
'CAUSE THINGS LIKE UH VOLUME COULD BE UH PLACED NEXT TO THE BUTTON 
THERE THE ICONS 
SO YOU DON'T TOUCH THE ICONS THAT MUCH 
OKAY 
COULD COULD I SEE THE SCROLL BAR IS UH AS AS A SORT OF SHORTCUT 
A A AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION AS WELL THE MAYBE YOU COULD UH COULD UH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY GOOD 
AND AND THE CASE IS IS RUBBER 
AND THE BUTTONS 
OKAY AND UH THE COLOURING 
WITH WITH GREY OR BLACK 
OKAY WE'LL WE'LL COME TO THAT LATER 
UM 
OKAY 
ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD OR 
YEAH 
UM UH YEAH 
UM UM BUT MAYBE YOU DO WANT A PROGRAMME BUTTON TO UH FOR EXAMPLE ACTIVATE THE VOICE RECOGNITION OR TURN THE VOICE VOICE RECOGNITION 
YEAH AL ALTHOUGH BY PRESSING THE BUTTON FOR I NO DON'T KNOW TWO THREE SECONDS 
YOU COULD ALSO EASY TO YOU'D DISABLE IT WITH A LITTLE BEEP AND AND BUT O OKAY THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT 
THE BASIC OKAY 
OKAY 
UM YOU THOUGHT OF SOME EVALUATION CRIT CRITERIA 
OKAY 
YOU ARE NAMELESS 
NO 
OKAY SO THESE THESE ARE THE CORE UH THE CRITERIA 
OKAY WELL 
TH THEN WE'LL SWITCH TO MY PRESENTATION 
UM 
THE PRODUCTION COSTS 
THE COSTS ARE NOT UNDER 
CAN I 
UM THIS IS THE 
YEAH IT'S IT'S W WAY ABOVE UM UH ABOVE THE THE THE TWELVE EURO FIFTY 
AND WHAT MAKES IT VERY EXPENSIVE SO UH FOR EXAMPLE THE SOLAR CELL 
SO I GUESS WE SHOULD SKIP THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT 
YEAH THE THE PRICE THE THE NUMBER OF TIMES AND THE THE SAME 
UM WELL THIS IS WHAT I WOULD CALL OUR LUXURY MODEL 
UM IF YOU WOULD IF YOU LOOK AT THE UH W W W WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE IT MORE UM 
TO MAKE IT JUST BETWEEN THE TWELVE EURO FIFTY UM THEN I 
DID THE FOLLOWING CHANGES 
TWELVE EURO FORTY CENTS I CAME UP WITH BY LEAVING OUT THE SOLAR CELLS 
UM BY NOT USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE BECAUSE IT'S UH IT'S A FOUR OR UH ADDITION TO THE PRICE 
UM 
YEAH I BELIEVE 
UH PUSH BUTTON WELL 
IT MAKES IT THE THIRTEEN YEAH 
PUSH BUTTONS ARE BUTTONS ARE ARE NOT THE MOST EXPENSIVE BUT DO ADD EXTRA COST 
SO UM YEAH TH THIS DESIGN IS NOT UM 
WITHIN OUR PRICE MODEL 
UM 
YEAH 
IT'S STILL TOO EXPENSIVE YEAH 
UM 
I I GUESS IF WE LEAVE THE IF WE LEAVE THIS ONE TO UM UH 
AND UH MAYBE NOT SO THE SPECIAL FORM 
IT BECOMES A VERY DULL REMOTE CONTROL I KNOW 
BUT IT'S THE BOARD DECISION 
UM 
AND UM YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I KNOW 
MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT ONE UH FOCUS ON ANOTHER UH 
YEAH UM UH MAYBE NOT NOT ALL THAT FANCY BUT JUST WAY WAY MORE EASY UH UH UM BASIC AND UH M MAXIMISE THE PROFITS AND UM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I KNOW I KNOW 
YEAH 
ALTHOUGH I THINK WE YEAH 
BUT WE COULD STILL MAKE UH A REMOTE CONTROL THAT P UH UM APPLIES UM MORE TO YOUNG PEOPLE UH BY GIVING IT ANOTHER COLOUR ALREADY 
UM SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE UH UH A DEVICE THAT ATTRACTS A LITTLE BIT MORE TO YOUNG PEOPLE 
UM BUT UH I AGREE IT'S IT'S NOT A FANCY HIGH TECH UH DEVICE 
DEFINITELY NOT IN 
IT'S NOT THAT INNOVATIVE 
OR HOWEVER YOU S PRONOUNCE THAT 
UM SO OKAY 
UM 
UH THIS IS THE WRONG ONE 
SO UH THAT MEANS REDESIGN 
WE DO NOT HAVE THE TIME O UH NEW TO TO REDESIGN THE PRODUCT 
UM BUT WE CAN EVALUATE THE PROCESS AND UM UH 
UH THE SATISFACTION ON HOW THINGS WENT 
UM I'M NOT SURE IF WE NEED TO EVALUATE UH THE DEVICE FIRST 
I GUESS 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
WE L WE CAN LEARN 
YEAH 
YEAH 
I AGREE 
WELL 
I DO IT IS IT IS 
YEAH I THINK SO 
YOU LIKE THE RUBBER UH OR 
YEAH 
NO I'LL I'LL I'LL GIVE IT A TWO 
YOU LIKE TITA 
THAT'S A FLAVOUR AS WELL 
RIGHT 
UM 
YEAH I KNOW BUT BUT IT BUT THAT'S FANCY IN THE WAY UM 
I MEAN FANCY HAS HAS A LOT OF 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT APPLIES 
IT YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH I I AGREE 
WELL WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE AND UH 
NO WE ARE EVALUATING THIS THIS UH DESIGN NOW 
THIS PROTOTYPE 
YEAH 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A THRILL 
YEP 
I'M NOT SURE 
I'M NOT SURE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UH I'M DOUBTING DOUBTING AS WELL 
UM 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UH TWO OR THREE 
THERE 
WH WH WHAT WOULD BE YOUR GUESS 
I MEAN EASE OF US UM DOES NOT ONLY APPLY TO THE MOST BASIC FUNCTIONS 
IT'S THE UH IT'S IT'S OVERALL 
SO THE DEVICE EASY TO USE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
OKAY 
UH OR A THREE 
RED 
OKAY 
SO I COULD MAKE IT E EASY 
OR 
NO I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET 
OKAY BUT IF I WOULD SAY A THREE THEN IT'S SIX AND FOR USE TEN 
DIVIDED BY FAR AS TWO POINT FIVE 
BUT I'M FILLING IN A THREE 
DOES IT WILL USE IT WILL BE A TWO POINT FIVE 
YES IT IS 
I HAVE A VOTE 
EXACTLY 
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CONTENT IT'S ABOUT OKAY UM SO IT EASY TO F 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
YEAH OR BEEPS OR YEAH 
I'M HERE I'M HERE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL I UH WE SHOULD NOT UH STAY TOO LONG ON THIS SUBJECT UH BECAUSE OF THE TIME BUT I PERSONALLY GIVE IT A ONE 
UM SEBASTIAN 
RIGHT WELL 
THE FEEL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS SPONGY 
WELL UH IT CAN'T BE MORE SPONGY 
SO 
NO OKAY BUT BUT 
FOR THE OPTIONS GIVEN IT'S THE MOST SPONGY ONE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
THEY'RE OUT THERE 
YEAH 
I'LL GIVE IT A ONE 
YEAH I KNOW BUT YOU HAVE TO NAME A FIG UH A NUMBER 
BECAUSE WE NEED TO GO ON ONE FOR THE TIME 
YOU ARE OKAY 
THE REMOTE CONTROL OFFERS ENOUGH FEATURES 
WELL RUUD WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT 
YEAH 
YEAH I KNOW 
WHAT WHAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IS UM UH 
I THINK IT HAS 
YEAH 
BEC BECAUSE YOU CAN UM WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT BUT YOU DO HAVE UH REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE ABLE TO ADAPT ANOTHER SIGNAL 
SO YOU PLACE A A REGULAR UH REMOTE CONTROL IN FRONT OF THE OTHER ONE HIT THE ONE OR THE TWO OR THE OTHER 
WHATEVER AND IT R RECORDS THE UH THE UM THE THE SIGNALS 
SO YOU COULD UH UH UH 
ENTER ANY COMMENT YOU LIKE AS LONG IT'S ABLE TO AS LONG AS OUR DEVICE IS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE INFRARED SIGNAL 
SO I THINK TH THIS UH THIS IS UH A A REMOTE CONTROL WITH A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF FEATURES 
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE I A FEW BUTTONS BUT THE INSIDE IS IS QUITE UH ADVANCED 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEAH 
OKAY UM LET'S GIVE IT A NUMBER 
I'LL GIVE IT UH A ONE 
FOR FOR THE FOR THIS TO UH TYPE OF MARKET I THINK IT'S A ONE 
YEAH 
SO HIGH QUALITY LOW ACCEPTANCE 
THE PRODUCT IS IS IS UH B HIGH QUA UH HAS A HIGH QUALITY AND AND SO UH ADVANCED 
BUT 
WHETHER OR NOT OUR CLIENTS ARE ARE UM WILLING TO PAY TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR THIS KIND OF DEVICE IS DOUB AS WELL IS NOT SURE 
DO DO YOU AGREE 
YEAH 
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A RADAR UH FUNCTION 
TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
BU BUT WELL YEAH I KNOW BUT YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE FOR THE BRAND 
BECAUSE THERE ARE UH REMOTE CONTROLS WHICH CONTROL YOUR STEREO TELEVISION D. V. D. C. D. PLAYER FOR UNDER TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
UM YOU HAD AN OVERALL RATING 
UM 
THAT'S COUNTING 
OKAY

I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY EASY IF YOU COULD SAY OKAY I WANT TO USE THIS FOR MY OWN WORK OR MY OWN PRESENTATION FURTHER ON OR 
OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND THAT YOU COULD SHOW BUT UM 
I KNOW 
I KNOW BUT 
I KNOW BUT WE COULDN'T SEE THAT FEATURE AS I MISSED OUT

AT LEAST THE UM I WASN'T EXPLAINED HOW TO DO SUCH A THE 
OKAY

NO LET'S FIND UH THE WAY IT 
I DON'T BELIEVE SO 
WELL MAYBE WE'D 
GET AN EMAIL 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
FORTY MINUTES 
A MINUTE OR OR TEN MAYBE 
UM YEAH TEN OR FIVE 
SO WE CAN UH 
REDESIGN OUR UH 
UH I WOULD LIKE IT 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'S BLUE TONGUE 
YEAH 
THIS IS A NEW MODEL 
BUT 
BLUE TONGUE 
IT'S SPONGY 
THAT IS UH IT'S A NEW FEATURE NEXT TO BLUETOOTH TO UM DISABLE ALL BLUETOOTH DEVICES 
UM 
YEAH WE'RE DONE HERE 
GENTLEMEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION 
YES 
LIKE THIS ONE 
IT'S IMPORTANT 
UH I THINK TH THIS IS DEVICE WHICH WHICH HAS A LEARNING CURVE 
UM NOVICE USERS U USE THIS DEVICE IS UH NORMAL USERS USE UH A C A REMOTE CONTROL 
AND AFTER A WHILE THEY START TO DEVELOP UH SOME SKILLS IN THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION FUNCTIONS AND THEN THEY WILL NOT SO THIS DIAL AS OFTEN 
BUT OTHER USERS WHO ARE NOW AT THIS DEVICE AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THEY N THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT UH HOW TO CHANGE CHANNELS AND UH CHANGE THE VOLUME SO IT'S EASIER FOR THEM 
YEAH MAYBE SO 
YES IT'S 
WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S ANOTHER APPROACH IT'S MORE THAT ARE UM 
THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF DOING UH THINGS UH IN SUCH A DEVICE 
IT'S IT'S QUITE EASY 
YES RUBBER 
THERE ARE PLASTIC OR RUBBER 
UH YELLOW WITH UH 
GREY OR BLACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WHATEVER COST UH COST UH THE LAST 
NO 
UH MAYBE WE SHOULD UH THINK ABOUT THESE BUTTONS 
BUT 
YES BUT IT BUT THOSE ARE TASKS THAT ARE ONLY EXECUTED ONCE I THINK 
OR NOT 
WELL OKAY 
OKAY YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
OR SOMETHING LI LIKE THAT 
YES 
SO IT SPONGY 
I BELIEVE IT'S FANCY IT 
OKAY 
WELL IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE 
OKAY 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
OKAY 
BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT COMPLETE 
BECAUSE WE USE SPEC UH SPECIC UH SPECIAL MATERIALS THE LAST TIME 
AND YOU HAVE NOT ADDED ONE TIME THERE 
SO IT'S C WAY TOO EXPENSIVE 
BUT IT 
YES 
WILL BE BASICALLY IT WHEN WHEN THIS IS OUR ONLY OPTION WE SHOULD EVEN CONSIDER CHANGING THE CASING 
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S VERY LITTLE ADDED VALUE IN UH AN ENHANCED CASE WITH THESE DULL FUNCTIONS 
SO 
TYPE OF UM MAYBE ANOTHER MARKET SEGMENT 
YEAH 
YES 
THAT'S MAYBE THAT'S BETTER 
MAYBE WE COULD UH WE SHOULD GO FOR STRAIGHT AND SIMPLE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE HAS BEEN ASKED 
SO WE SHOULD KICK THE BOARD'S UH WELL 
HMM 
YES 
WELL MAYBE IT'S GOOD TO DO IT ANYWAY BECAUSE IF WE EVALUATE IT W WE CAN ALSO DETERMINE OF OUR OBJECTIVES ARE GOOD 
SO 
SO IT FANCY 
I THINK SO 
BUT IT'S NOT THAT FANCY 
I MEAN 
I THINK UH I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FANCY IF WE SAID THE TITANIUM HOUSING THE CASING 
IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE UH YOU REALLY LIKE TITANIUM 
I'M I'M NOT TOO 
IT HAS FLAVOUR 
YES THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU SHOULD TEST IT 
IT HAS TO DO WITH FASHION I GUESS 
SO DO 
OKAY 
YES 
I THINK I TH I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN I WOULD HAVE THINK UH IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE FANCY BY USING THE DOUBLE CURVED CASE 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE FANCY BUT WE DECIDED NOT TOO BECAUSE IF WE USE A DOUBLE CURVED CASE WE COULD NOT USE SOLAR 
SO 
YES 
YES I AGREE IT 
IT'S OKAY 
WE DID YES WE DID GOOD 
WELL LET'S LET'S THIS PRODUCT 
SO I I I THINK IT IS 
I THINK IT'S INNOVATIVE 
NO 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE INNOVATIVE U BY USING THE KINETIC UH ENERGY SOURCE BUT IT'S IT'S WAY TOO YES BUT 
I THINK UH IT'S A TWO 
WELL BUT THERE ARE TWO PARTS IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL 
WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS IS THE BASIC PART 
EVERYBODY CAN USE IT SO THAT'S EASY TO USE 
THAT'S FOR A NOVICE USER 
WHEN YOU HAVE A MORE ADVANCED ELABORATE USER WILL SUCH A USER REALLY WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE ALL THESE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS 
SO ON THAT IN THAT WAY TO USE ADVANCED 
AND I THINK IT'S EASY TO USE FOR FOR BOTH UH TYPES OF USERS 
SO UH 
IT'S MAYBE IT'S NOT VERY UH SAY FOUR 
OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU'RE RIGHT ON THAT BUT I I GUESS UH AN ADVANCED USER WILL WILL FIND THE VOICE RECOGNITION FUNCTION EASY TO USE 
BECAUSE UH IS ALREADY UH OR SHE IS ALREADY AN ADVANCED USER 
SO 
AFTER ALL I THINK PERSONALLY I WOULD GIVE A TWO 
BUT 
SO IT'S TWO TWO AND THERE 
TWO THREES 
SO THAT'S TEN 
SO THAT'S W 
ONE TWO AND A HALF 
SIX AND FOR 
SIX AND FOR USE TEN 
DIVIDED BY FAR AS TWO AND A HALF 
SO 
YES 
FOUR 
TWO 
DIVIDED BY FOUR 
THAT'S NOT EVEN 
BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO FILL IN SO WE HAVE TO AROUND IT 
YES 
IT AT MOST DEFINITELY SO IT'S VERY EASY 
YES 
MAYBE UH I I THINK I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO UH PROGRAMME IT ONCE IS IT THAT L RESPOND TO UH A CERTAIN WORD OR A CERTAIN SENTENCE 
SOMETHING LIKE WHERE ARE YOU AND THEN IT WILL SING I'M HERE 
SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO I TH 
YEAH ME TOO 
WELL IT CAN BE 
THERE ARE CASES UM IN WHICH THE OUTSIDE CASING IS UM CAN BE UH HOW DO HOW DO YOU PRONO IS IS MOLDABLE 
NO IT'S NOT ONE OF OUR OPTION BUT WHEN YOU LOOK ON THE MARKET WHEN YOU LOOK 
OH YES BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT UH WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT I THINK 
BECAUSE WE COMPARE ALL THESE UH CHARACTERISTICS CHARACTERISTICS WITH UH MARKET UH WITH WITH THE REAL MARKET 
SO THERE ARE UH REMOTE CONTROLS OUT THERE WHICH ARE A LOT MORE SPONGY 
THEY'RE OUT THERE 
YES BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH SO IT'S A TWO 
YOU TAKE ONE 
WHAT DO YOU GIVE IT 
NO NO NO 
UH I'LL I'LL CHANGE IT I'LL MAKE IT M MY MY MARK WILL BE A FOUR 
BASICALLY IT'S IT'S COMPLETELY PROGRAMMABLE 
YOU CAN ADD VERY M MUCH FUNCTIONALITY BY UH USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION MODE 
SO IT'S QUITE ADVANCED 
YES 
HAS UH THE SIGNALS SENT TO IT 
ABSOLUTELY 
YES 
BUT THAT THAT'S ITS POWER I GUESS BECAUSE UH A REGULAR PROGRAMMABLE UH REMOTE CONTROL CONTAINS WELL UH REALLY A LOT OF BUTTONS 
IT AT LEAST UH FORTY BUTTONS 
SO IT'S IT'S QUITE AS COMPLICATED TO GET UH TO GET USED IT 
AND THIS IS QUITE AS SIMPLE 
YOU CAN USE YOUR VOICE TO TO PROGRAMME IT 
IT'S 
YEAH I'LL GIVE IT A ONE 
YES 
I I'VE I THINK WE'VE UH SUCCE SUCCEED IN IN DEVELOPING A PRODUCT THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD 
BUT NOT FOR THIS KIND OF MARKET AND NOT FOR THIS KIND OF PRICE 
SO 
HMM 
YES 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YES I AGREE 
I 
YEAH OKAY 
BUT 
YES 
UM ABOUT FIFTY EUROS 
THAT'S QUITE EX WELL IT'S NOT IT'S NOT VERY EXPENSIVE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL THAT THAT HAS THIS FUNCTIONALITY 
YES IT'S MORE THAN FIFTY EUROS 
IT'S QUITE EXPENSIVE YES 
YES 
YES BUT YOU CAN YOU C 
YES BUT YOU CAN LEARN THIS THING ALL THESE FUNCTIONS 
AND IT'S EASIER TO USE BECAUSE THIS UH REMOTE CONTROLS DON'T OFFER VOICE RECOGNITION AND THIS ONE DOES 
SO I THINK IT'S WORTH ITS PRICE 
WELL IT'S IT'S ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WELL 
WELL I THINK 
MM 
ACTUALLY WE HAD 
YES 
WE HAD WE HAD TO LITTLE INFORMATION ACTUALLY 
SO AND UH UM THE THE THE WELL LOOKING AT ROOM FOR CREATIVITY THERE WAS 
W WAY TO THE THE CHOICE OF COMPONENTS WAS WAY TO NARROW 
SO THERE WAS NOT REALLY A PROCESS OF UH 
WELL 
YES 
WELL IN THE FIRST MEETING WE WE ALREADY WERE VERY CREATIVE 
WE WE THOUGHT OF POSSIBILITIES WHO ARE NOT POSSIBLE UH WITH THE THE CURRENT UH OFFER OF UH MANUFACTURING COMPONENTS 
SO 
WE'RE TEMPERED BY THAT YES 
YEAH OKAY 
I THINK WE'RE A GOOD TIME 
YES 
WELL I TRIED ONCE BUT THAT WAS NOT ALLOWED 
I THINK SO IT 
OH 
THE DIGITAL PEN WAS OKAY BUT SMARTBOARD WAS REALLY BAD 
IT IT'S 
THE RESPONSE IS VERY SLOW AND THE POSSIBILITIES ARE VERY LIMITED 
IT'S NOT ACCURATE 
MAYBE IT'S IT NEEDS TO BE CALIBRATEDS 
IT IS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
I I THINK SO IT 
YES 
YES 
MM-HMM 
BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT SOLUTION FOR UH FOR UH A KNOWN PROBLEM UH WRITING DOWN SOME NOTES 
SOME SOME INF UH INFORMATION AND THEN UM FORGETTING YOUR NOTEBOOK SOMEWHERE AND LOSING ALL THAT INFORMATION 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING IN ONE PLACE AND IT'S QUITE EASY QUITE EASY IT'S IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION DIGITAL AND SHARE IT WITH OTHERS IN A QUITE EASY WAY 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT 
I ONLY THINK IT'S THE THE THE SHAPE OF THE PEN IS TOO BIG 
IT'S NOT QUITE UH ERGONOMIC 
ECO ERGONOMIC 
YES 
YES YES 
THAT'S QUITE WHAT POWERPOINT DOES 
AN OBJECT YES 
YES 
THE DRAWING CAP CAPABILITIES ARE VERY LIMITED 
AND AND UH W YOU WERE WHEN YOU'RE USING UH WINDOWS YOU'RE USED TO A CERTAIN INTERFACE AND CERTAIN BUTTONS UH WHICH YOU CAN USE FOR DRAWING 
AND A LOT OF THESE BUTTONS DON'T APPEAR HERE 
SO IT'S 
NOT NOT UH N NOT WAY 
IT'S QUITE UH LIMITED 
OKAY 
UH VERY GOOD CELEBRATION 
POP UH POP UP THE CHAMPAGNE 
OKAY 
I SEE SOME ACTION OVER THERE 
OKAY 
UH WE'RE DONE WE'RE FINISHED I BELIEVE 
SO 
ARE THERE ANY MORE CYCLES IN THIS PROCESS 
I THINK NOT 
BUT UM HOW MUCH TIME DID WE GOT FOR THIS MEETING 
AND HOW MUCH TIME IS LEFT 
TEN MINUTES 
OKAY 
OKAY 
WELL I THINK WE WE WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE REDESIGN SHOULD BE 
A SIMPLE DULL UH ONE COLOURED BOX 
NO IT'S IT'S JUST THE SAME PRODUCT THAT IS ALREADY ON THE MARKET 
WHAT IS THAT 
IT'S A GIRAFFE EATING A EATING LEAVES FROM A TRUE 
SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY PROMOTING BLUETOOTH 
OR BLUE TONGUE 
BLUE TONGUE 
OKAY 
LET'S WRAP IT UP 
THANK YOU MISTER MANAGER 
NOW LET'S HAVE UH A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE 
THAT'S THE SAME AS UH IN THE TOP OF IT UH WITH THE THE ROUND UH BUTTON 
BUT UH WE DON'T UH WE DON'T UH WE DO THINK IT'S UM WELL WHAT IF WITH EASE OF US 
W WHICH PREFERS THE WHICH THE THE CUSTOMER OF THE USER PREFERS 
PLASTIC OR RUBBER 
WELL YEAH 
AND A BUTTON FOR DISABLING THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
YEAH 
THAT'S THE BASIC IDEA YEAH 
OF OUR PROTOTYPE 
SO JUST WALK THROUGH TO STOP BY STEP 
I MEAN IS IT FANCY EVERYTHING I BELIEVE UH 
I BELIEVE IT'S FANCY 
OH SORRY 
TWENTY TWO 
YIKES 
WHY DOES THE PRICE AND AND THE S UH IN UH EXA YEAH 
THE NUMBER OF UH YEAH 
AND AND DOES IT 
BUT THAT'S THAT'S ONLY FOR THE BUTTONS 
SO THE BUTTON WE CAN USE PLASTIC 
AND THE PLA UH 
AND A PLASTIC B JUST PLASTIC BUTTONS A PLUS UH INSTEAD OF RUBBER 
YEAH TOO BAD 
MM-HMM 
UM THE YELLOW RUBBER I THINK SO 
I'M NOT TOO 
IT'S TRENDY TRENDY FUN YEAH 
WELL JUST GIVE IT A TWO 
IT'S NOT THE ULTIMATE UH FANCY TWO BUT 
YEAH BUT THAT'S STI THAT'S UH 
LOOKING AT THE USER HE NEEDS WE ONLY UH DON'T WE DON'T HAVE THE DOUBLE CURVED CASE 
WE WE WE DO HAVE UH THE RUBBER WE DO HAVE THE COLOURS 
THAT'S TWO T IF THERE 
SO I BELIEVE UH WE ARE CLOSE UH T TWO 
BUT THAT'S NOT ON IT 
OV OR CAN WE 
OKAY 
AND THE SCROLL UH WHILE 
THE SOLAR NOT MANY REMOTES 
HAVE THE SOLAR I THINK 
YEAH 
WELL YEAH THE VOICE RECOGNITION OF COURSE IS HARD TO LEARN I THINK 
WELL HARD IT'S NOT FOR THE FOR THE E FOR THE ELDERLY 
THEY WON'T USE IT 
I THINK 
I THINK A THREE 
WOULDN'T GIVE IT MORE 
YEP 
IF YOU MAKE IT A FOR IT WILL BE THERE IN GENERAL 
IF UH MAKES IT A FOUR 
NOT A THREE 
DARN 
NO 
A SEVEN A THREE NO 
A FOUR AND A THREE TOGETHER 
YEAH YOU HAVE A TWO UH HAS A TWO 
THERE 
AND A THREE 
NO 
I KNOW 
YES 
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE CONCLUSION IS A THREE THREE 
THEN YOU WOULD MAKE A FOUR 
IF YOU FILL OUT A FOUR 
YEAH WE HAVEN'T OR UH OUR UH REALLY WORKED OUT IT BUT YOU C YOU CAN YOU CAN JUST SAY FIND AND HE REPEATS FIND 
YEAH BUT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE THE BASIC IDEA OF THE THE SPEAKER UH 
BUT EVEN WITHOUT IT 
YEAH 
UM IT 
WAS IT ONE OF OUR OPTIONS 
SO ON THE ONE 
YEAH 
BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE IN THIS CASE WE'VE DONE THE BEST WE COULD 
I WAN I'LL TAKE ONE 
IT WILL BE A ONE 
YEAH BUT IT UH DOESN'T HAS THE DIGITS 
I BELIEVE IT'S 
IF YOU UH ASK YOURSELF IT OFFERS ENOUGH FEATURES I DON'T I DON'T THINK 
IT IS IT HAS ALL THE FEATURES UM A NORMAL REMOTE HAS 
YEAH 
I'LL GIVE A TWO 
BUT WE COULD COULDN'T UH WHAT WHAT'S THE SELLING PRICE 
FIFTY 
UH TWENTY FIVE 
AND COSTS WERE TWELVE FIFTY 
BUT EVEN NOW IF ONLY OUR PRODUCTION COSTS W UH WERE EXCEEDED THE DOUBLE 
THINK 
PRODUCTION COST WAS WERE TO UH WAS TWENTY TWO 
SO UH SELLING PRICE UH WOULD BE UH YEAH 
THAT'S PRICE BUT W W 
NO 
AN ORIGINAL REMOTE CONTROL OF ANY T. V. KINDA UH A PHILLIPS REMOTE CONTROL YOU YOU PAY UH 
YEAH I KN I KNOW UH FROM A FEW YEARS AGO IT IT IT COSTED HUNDRED GILDERS 
FOUR SIX SEVEN EIGHT 
NINE DIVIDED BY SIX 
HMM 
YEAH I THINK UH 
THE PROCESS WAS GOOD 
BUT WE UM WE WEREN'T AWARE OF THE PRICES OF THE COSTS 
AND AND THAT WAS THE THE BIG DEAL 
I IF WE KNOW THAT BEFORE WE C WE COULD HAVE MADE THE THE CHOICE BETWEEN WHAT YEAH 
NO NO 
FANTASTIC 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
RESPONSE AND 
UH IT IT HAS YEAH 
YEAH IT'S NOT ACCURATE 
THE P THE POINTING OF THE PEN IS NOT UM THE PLACE WHERE IT IT WRITES ITS UM UH WHERE IT UH 
YEAH WHERE IT DRAWS 
IT'S UH THE DRAWING ON ON THE B IN THE BOARD SO ARE RIGHT FROM THE PEN 
SO UH 
YOU TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT THAT YOUR Y UM YEAH UH 
IT'S TOO SLOW 
HMM 
YEP 
IF IT HAS O. C. R. UH I THINK UH I WOULD USE BUT UH I I JUST UH TAKE NOTES FOR MYSELF AND AND AND THAT'S IT 
IT W IT W YEAH 
IT WAS NECESSARY FOR ME TO UH 
YEAH BECAUSE IF I WANT SOMETHING ON THE COMPUTER I JUST TYPE IT 
I TYPE FASTER THAN I WROTE 
SO 
ECONOMIC 
YEAH 
BUT YOU YOU CAN IF YOU SAVE THIS IMAGE YOU CAN OPEN IT IN YOUR SHARED WORK FOLDER 
SO IT'S ALMOST YEAH 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
A AND THE FUNCTION OF OF FILLING IN IN UH AN OVAL OR IN AN OBJECT 
I IT'S NOT POSSIBLE YEAH 
UH IT LOOKS LIKE PAINT ACTUALLY 
GREAT 
IT WAS A PRIVILEGE WORKING WITH YOU 
TO PRIVATE ROOMS 
BUT YOU USE THE PROBLEM Y YOU CAN'T CONTINUE YOUR UH YOUR LINE 
WELL IT'S FLUFFY ALRIGHT 
SPONGY 
A GIRAFFE 
RIGHT 
THAT'S ALRIGHT 
WELL YOU COULD USE TWO OF THEM TO PROGRAMME THE UM CHANNELS IN THE TWO CHANNEL BUTTON 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO ASSIGN TWO CHANNEL NEW CHANNELS 
YOU 
YES 
OH MY NAME IS NOT NAME BUT 
UH WELL I SAID THE THE UH DOCUMENTS 
AND THIS UH 
WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA 
IT SHOULD BE 
YEAH THAT'S UH HOW THE FASHION GUYS UH STATE IT 
FANCY LOOK AND FEEL 
SO 
UH WELL APPAR 
YEAH BUT APPARENTLY UH WE SHOULDN'T EVALUATE YET 
SO 
YEAH I THINK THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA 
SO UH THAT'S ABOUT IT 
UM WELL SINCE WE'RE NOT GONNA MANUFACTURE IT ANYWAY 
OH 
YAY 
SO IT 
SO IT FANCY 
SO UH NO 
SO IT UH 
AND WE YEAH W WHAT THEY WANT WANTED WAS UH COLOURS AND SOFT MATERIALS 
SO ON THAT WAY 
IT IT'S FANCY 
OKAY AND HE WAS IT 
INNOVATIVE 
YEP 
YEAH AND UH 
SO UH ALSO A UH TWO 
SO IT EASY TO USE 
WELL THE P THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IS EASY TO USE 
THE THE ZAPPING CHANNEL SWITCHING VOLUME 
BUT THE MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS ARE PROBABLY 
A BIT HARDER 
GOOD QUESTION 
UH I'LL GO UH FOR THE TWO 
HMM 
HUH 
YEAH 
I YEAH 
YEAH TWO TWO THREE 
NO 
SO IT EASY TO FIND 
YEAH I AGREE 
NO 
UH THIS THIS WAS A MOST SPONGY OPTION 
WELL YEAH IT DEPENDS 'CAUSE IT'S THE MOST SPONGY WE COULD BUT YEAH 
WELL IF I GIVE IT A ONE 
THERE'LL BE ONE HELL OF A CALCULATION 
SO I'LL JUST GIVE IT A TWO AND MAKE THIS A ONE POINT FIVE 
WELL THE BASIC LAYOUT DOESN'T OFFEM OFFER MUCH ABOUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION COULD ADD A LOT 
SO 
YEAH DEPENDS 
UH DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU UH IMPLEMENT IN THE SPEECH FEAT 
SIGNAL 
UM I THINK THINK A ONE 'CAUSE V WITH A VOICE RECOGNITION YOU COULD ADD ANYTHING YOU WANT SO THAT'S LIKE UM 
MAYBE EVEN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK ADVANCED 
YEAH BUT UH WITH THESE RATINGS UH 
SHOULD BE ABOUT ONE POINT IS SEVEN YEAH 
YOU 
THE PRICES 
I AGREE 
DRAWS 
NO 
NOT REALLY 
UH I ONLY USE IT TO DRAW A RABBIT SO CAN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT IT 
ONE OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND

UH-HUH 
MM 
OKAY 
OKAY YOU SHOULD PRESS NEXT 
OKAY 
OKAY WELL THE ANIMAL I'D LIKE TO DRAW US A TIGER 
MY DRAWING SKILLS ARE REALLY BAD SO 
THEY ARE REALLY BAD MY DRAWING SKILLS 
I'M NOT SURE HOW THE LEGS SHOULD GO ABOUT 
UH THESE ARE STRIPES 
I'VE PICKED THIS ANIMAL BECAUSE IT'S VERY FAST 
IT IS UH IT KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTS 
UH IT HARDLY EVER WASTES ANY RESOURCES 
UH WELL BASICALLY UH IT HUNTS FOR PREY BUT IT DOES IT ALWAYS ON A VERY WELL THOUGHT WAY 
UH IT KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTS 
IT NEVER KILLS AN ANIMAL UH JUST FOR THE KILLING SO IT'S VERY EFFICIENT 
AND IT TRIES TO DO EVERYTHING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE 
AND IT ALWAYS GOES FOR UH SECURITY IN SEEKING UH UH A HIDE SPOT AND UH AND DOING EVERYTHING SECURITY SPEED AND EFFICIENCY IS IMPORTANT 
AND I THINK UH THESE THINGS WE CAN SEE 
YEAH 
OH 
HMM 
ONLY ONE THING UH THAT HAS TO BE ADDED ACCORDING TO UM SO UH THE THE MATERIAL IT IS MADE OF IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIGHT 
THAT'S IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF BUT SOME UH YEAH 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
GOOD LUCK EVERYONE 
GOOD DAY 
NICK BROER USER INTERFACE DESIGNER 
I'M GOING TO UH LOOK AT THE TECHNICAL DESIGN FROM THE UH USER POINT OF VIEW 
THE CREATIVE GENIUS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WELL I'M MORE INTO THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF DRAWING SO I'M NOT REALLY GOOD AT DRAWING ANIMALS BUT UH THE ANIMAL WHICH I UH 
OPEN 
OH FORMAT 
ALSO MY ANIMAL WILL BE LIKE KING SIZE 
I PRETTY MUCH LIKE A DOLPHIN BECAUSE OF ITS UH ITS FREEDOM BASICALLY 
LET'S SEE 
A HEAD 
ACTUALLY WORKED WITH THIS 
IT'S LIKE UH IT'S A VERY 
UH HIGH TECH 
BUT LOW RESPONSIVE THOUGH 
PREFER PEN AND PAPER 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A NUCLEAR BOMB 
THIS THING ISN'T DOING WHAT I'M 
WHAT I WANT 
SO 
YEAH WELL IT DOES LOOK LIKE A NUCLEAR BOMB 
I'LL JUST FINISH UP REAL SOON BECAUSE I'M 
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY LIKE LIKE A DOLPHIN BUT THEN AGAIN THIS IS ALL NOW FOR ME 
LIKE THE OCEAN LIKE SWIMMING 
DO THAT IN MY SPARE TIME SO THAT'S BASICALLY IN 
NOW WE CAN FORGET THIS EVER HAPPENED 
IT'S NOT REALLY THAT RESPONSIVE NO 
AND YOU WAS MAKING COMMENTS ON MY DOLPHIN 
YOU PICKED A HARD ON DIDN'T YOU 
GET IT 
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE HAVEN'T YOU 
WELL I BASICALLY HAD A QUESTION 
DO UH ARE WE GOING TO INTRODUCE A MULTI REMOTE CONTROL 
SO IT JUST THE T. V. OR DO WE WANT TO ONE 
JUST FOR T. V. REMOTE CONTROL 
OKAY 
WELL I WAS THINKING ABOUT DESIGN REMOTE CONTROL WITH OUR UH MOTTO AND ALL 
UH THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT WE NEED TO STICK TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH 
NO RATIONAL CHANGES OR WHATEVER 'CAUSE IT REVOLUTIONARY CHANGES YES 
UH WE MIGHT HAVE TO CONSIDER OTHER DESIGN ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCT 
SO THAT WAS SOMETHING I WANTED TO ADD AND PERHAPS SOME USABILITY ASPECT 
T. V. IS BECOMING CENTRAL IN MOST HOMES 
DO WE WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED IN ANY WAY TO UH YEAH TO BE ABLE TO USE IT AS WELL 
YEAH 
OKAY WELL THAT'S NOT THAT MUCH TO WORK WITH 
MM GOOD LUCK 
MORNING

I'M NOT SURE IF HE'S LATE OR DELAYED OR WHATEVER SO I'M GONNA START SOON WE HAVE NOW DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME ANYWAY 
THERE YOU ARE OKAY 
OH NO PROBLEM 
WE'RE ABOUT TO START S HAVE A SET 
OKAY WELCOME AGAIN 
TODAY FUNCTIONAL DESIGN PHASE 
I'LL TAKE YOU OVER THE MINUTES OF LAST LAST MEETING 
OKAY THAT WAS JUST TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER HAVE A LITTLE THOUGHTS ON WHAT YOUR VISION IS AND IN THIS PROJECT IS 
I PUT THE MINUTES IN THE I MADE IN THE ON THE P THE THE PROJECT SHARE SO IF YOU WANNA REVIEW THEM THEY'RE THERE 
I WILL DO IS AFTER EVERY MEETING SO IF YOU HAVE SOME INFORMATION YOU WANNA TAKE BACK YOU CAN FIND OUT THERE 
ANYWAYS UM TODAY THREE PRESENTATIONS FROM EVERY ONE OF YOU 
UM AFTER THAT I GOT SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS FROM PROJECT BOARD SO WE'RE GONNA GO AF GO AFTER OVER THIS LATER 
BUT I WANNA START WITH UH STUFF YOU DID FIRST SO WE CAN SEE WHAT EVERYBODY CAME UP WITH 
AND AFTER THAT WE CAN HAVE THE NEW REQUIREMENTS AND SHARE SOME THOUGHTS SO 
WHO WOULD LIKE WANNA GO FIRST 
TAKE IT 
ANYWAY LET'S SEE WHAT YOU HAVE 
UH IT'S STILL A BIT OPEN 
YOU SHOULD CLOSE IT IN YOUR OWN NOTEBOOK I GUESS 
YEAH 
SO THERE 
OKAY 
IF I CAN CUT ONE IS IT PEOPLE ARE MENU 
SO IT PEOPLE OKAY 
'CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY MEN SO 'KAY 
SO WE HAVE TO USE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT 
OKAY 
OKAY JUST TALK AHEAD 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY THAT'S OKAY 
THAT'S A LITTLE WEIRD 
OKAY WE CAN WE CAN HIDE THOSE UNDER A MENU OR SOMETHING OKAY 
THAT'S LIKE A BUTTON ON YOUR T. V. 
REMOTE OKAY 
OKAY 
WE WANNA HAVE A LITTLE PREVIEW ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 
PREVIEW WHAT'S ON THE CHANNEL 
OKAY 
THAT SENDS IT IT'S POSSIBLE BUT UH I THINK IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT DO CONTINUE 
OKAY YOU DON'T SET IT YOURSELF IT JUST REMEMBERS THE CHANNEL THAT YOU ARE IN MOST FOR EXAMPLE 
YOU WANT THE YOU WANT TO TO BE PROGRAMMED FOR EXAMPLE Y PROGRAMMED F OR YOU WANT TO TO RECOGNISE YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL 
LET'S SEE YOU YOU SPEND TWENTY MINUTES EACH DAY ON THAT CHANNEL IS IT RECOGNISES YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL 
OKAY SO IT'S IT IT DOES IT RECOGNISE ITSELF YOU DON'T HAVE TO SET IT OKAY 
OKAY 
I SEE 
OKAY 
NO PROBLEM IT'S IT'S OKAY THAT'S YEAH GO AHEAD 
THAT SEEMS VERY GOOD 
MM-HMM 
OKAY SO HAVE TO MORE MAKE IT MORE DURABLE ACTUALLY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
WOW 
THE S YEAH 
MAKE IT MAKE THEM BIGGER 
EVEN MORE DURABLE UH 
OKAY 
YEAH IT'S TRUE 
YEAH THAT'S CLEAR 
ONE OF COURSE UH 
YEAH 
I MUST SAY THAT IT 
HMM 
THAT WAS IT 
OKAY THAT WAS GOOD 
SO WE AGREE ON THE THE PART THAT WE NEED TO GET SOMETHING ON THE ON THE REMOTE TO FIND IT SOMEWHERE AND INCREASE AT THE DURABILITY OF OF THE THING 
SO THE OTHER ASPECTS WE'LL JUST SEE HOW WHAT YOU CAME UP WITH AND WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR THAT BUDGET 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
OF COURSE HMM 
YOU MEAN INTEGRATE THEM ALL INTO THE CIRCUIT BOARD 
OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
SO YOU HAVE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
OKAY 
THAT WAS IT 
I'LL GET BACK TO MY THING THEN 
OH 
OKAY BACK THIS UP TO THE SCREEN 
SO I GOT SOME NEW INFORMATION ON THE PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS ARE CHANGING A LITTLE 
LIKE YOU SAID UH TELETEXT IS NOT NOT VERY POPULAR ANYMORE BECAUSE THE UH THE INTERNET 
NOWADAYS PEOPLE DON'T USE THE TELETEXT ANYMORE OR HARDLY SO IT CAN EITHER 
WELL I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD REMOVE THE BUTTON BECAUSE THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO ARE USING IT 
BUT I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE VERY IT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE BIG BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE 
JUST PUT IT SOMEWHERE OR UNDER SECOND OPTION OR WHATEVER 
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE 
UM WE'RE TARGETING YOUNG PEOPLE NOW BECAUSE OUR UM 
THIS IS A NEW PRODUCT AND WITH THIS NEW PRODUCT WE WANT TO APPEAL TO YOUNGER PEOPLE WHICH ARE UM THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WERE DEFINED UNDER FORTY 
I SEE I THINK IT'S THAT'S ALSO GOOD WITH THE FASHION AND EVERYTHING IS YEAH 
THEY WANT TO PAY FOR IT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO SPEND MONEY ACTUALLY TO BUY A UM REMOTE THAT THEY LIKE 
IF THEY LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS THE WAY TO FUNCTIONS SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA SPEND UH SPEND MONEY ON IT 
YEAH 
SO HOW FAR WE CAN GO WITH IT ANYWAY SO AND ONE THING THAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT IS THAT THE CORPORATE L COLOUR AND SLOGAN ARE RECOGNISABLE 
WHICH IS APPARENTLY BLACK AND YELLOW BUT 
I'M NOT SURE IF WE I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP THE THE LOGO IN MIND 
BECAUSE WITH COLOURS YOU CAN UH HAVE A LOT OF UH FASHIONABLE COLOURS AND EVERYTHING IN IT WHICH SUITS EVERYBODY'S TASTE 
SO 
WITH THAT CONCEPT I STARTED THINKING 
SO WHY NOT JUST STEAL NOKIA'S IDEA AND JUST MAKE CHANGEABLE COVERS FOR YOUR I MEAN THIS COST HARDLY ANYTHING I THINK AND PEOPLE COULD EVEN SPEND EXTRA MONEY 
IN BUYING A COVER AND SO HAVE AN ENTIRE NEW REMOTE CONTROL THAT THEY LIKE TO USE 
ARE WE CAN SH FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT A BASIC DESIGN 
AND SELL THE COVERS SEPARATELY FOR EXAMPLE 
THAT'S JUST A LITTLE MARKETING IDEA THAT COULD BE APPLIED SO YOU CAN P IT APPEALS TO REALLY EVERYONE 
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO I THINK YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE ENTIRE REMOTE CONTROLS 
WE MAKE A BASIC ONE AND MANUFACTURE THIS COVER SEPARATELY 
SO THAT WAS THAT WAS MY IDEA ON WHAT WE COULD DO TO APPEAL THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE 
SO JUST 
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAME UP WITH ANYTHING IN THE MEANTIME AFTER MAKING A PRESENTATION 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE 
OKAY 
OH YEAH 
I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO THE L. C. D. SCREEN LIKE YOU SAID 
I THINK FOR EXAMPLE IT'S IT'S HUGE I THINK THE L. C. D. IS HUGE IT CONSUMES BATTERIES LIKE HELLO 
I THINK IT TAKES UP A LOT OF A LOT OF POWER 
IT COSTS A LOT I THINK 
WHAT WE COULD DO WHAT COULD BE POSSIBLE SO MAYBE NOT AN L. C. D. SCREEN BUT WITH A PREVIEW BUT Y I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE 
FOR EXAMPLE A LITTLE T. V. GUIDE 
LIKE YOU HAVE A LITTLE JUST JUST A TEXT ONLY NOT CLEAR JUST A LITTLE TEXT THING SO YOU CAN USE YOUR REMOTE IS A T. V. GUIDE 
I'M NOT SURE IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE BUT MAYBE OKAY MAKE IT YEAH FIND A LITTLE COMPROMISE IN THAT BUT WHAT DID I WROTE DOWN 
I THINK THE P YEAH THE BEEP IS A VERY SIMPLE THING TO IMPLE IMPLEMENT 
JUST MAKE A BUTTON ON YOUR T. V. AND JUST HIT THE BUTTON IT BEEPS SOMEWHERE 
I THINK IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT WE SHOULD GO FOR THAT 
UH SPEECH RECOGNITION 
I THIN YEAH I MEAN WHERE ELSE SHOULD YOU PUT IT 
YEAH BUT HOW ARE YOU GONNA USE THAT IF YOUR I MEAN IF YOUR REMOTE CONTROL IS LOST 
HOW ARE YOU GONNA PRESS WHERE ARE YOU GONNA PRESS THE BUTTON 
A SLAP ON STICKER 
UH YOU MEAN IS LIKE A SEPARATE THING YOU CAN ATTACH TO YOUR T. V. 
YEAH THAT COULD BE POSSIBLE 
A LITTLE LITTLE BOX YOU CAN ATTACH TO YOUR T. V. IS FINE THEN OKAY 
I THINK IT'S UNIVERSAL 
I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR UNIVERSAL BECAUSE APPARENTLY WE'RE A SEPARATE COMPANY MAKING SEPARATE C REMOTE CONTROLS TO SELL IT A LOT OF DIVERSE PEOPLE 
I THINK UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE POSSIBLE 
YEAH I THINK WE'RE TARGETING EVERYONE IS REMOTE 
OKAY UNIVERSAL IS GOOD 
SPEECH RECOGNITION I THINK IT'S VERY HARD BECAUSE WE'RE SELLING ACROSS MULTIPLE COUNTRIES 
SO I THINK IMPLEMENTING SPEECH RECOGNITION AS SUCH A SMALL UM APPARATUS IT'S VERY HARD TO DO 
YEAH BUT I DON'T SEE ARABIAN PEOPLE SPEAKING ONE TWO UH WHATEVER 
IT'S YEAH 
IT'S NOT A MATURE TECHNOLOGY I THINK IT TAKES A LOT OF MEMORY AND EVERYTHING IN IN A REMOTE CONTROL IS 
I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A REMOTE CONTROL YET UH 
WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE 
UM WELL YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO THE N NOT THE MATERIALS THAT ARE REAL DURABLE 
SO THE THE THE SYMBOLS WON'T FADE MAYBE A LITTLE HARDER PLASTIC OR ESPECIALLY LI WE DON'T MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE HAVE TO DO ALL THE BUTTONS 
BUT ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT ARE UM THE POPULAR BUTTONS SO THIS ALWAYS FADE FIRST 
MM THE THING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE HAVE NOW 
LET'S SEE 
FOR EXAMPLE 
WELL WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TARGETING OLDER PEOPLE WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT 
EVERYTHING WE TARGET IS UNDER FORTY SO 
YOU ASSUME THAT THAT THEY READ CORRECTLY AND I THINK THEY'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BUT YOUNG PEOPLE USE THAT THEY'RE REALLY SENSITIVE TO TO TRENDS THAT ARE PASSING THROUGH THE WORLD 
SO 
ONE OF COURSE 
NO I THINK IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU YOU PUT OVER THEM BECAUSE YEAH WE C YEAH YOU C WELL 
TH THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT A BAD THAT'S NOT EVEN IT'S NOT EVEN A BAD IDEA 
I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE NOT THE DURABILITY ISSUE 
YOU COULD FOR EXAMPLE OF YOUR BUTTONS ARE FADED 
AFTER I MEAN IF YOU MAKE A DURABLE REMOTE THEY ARE FADED YOU CAN JUST BUY A NEW COVER 
UH I'M NOT SURE IT'S IT'S HARD TO MAKE 
SO IT'S A GOOD AND A BAD IDEA 
MM-HMM 
YEAH I KNOW IT'S JUST JUST A ONE ONE PIECE OF RUBBER FOR EXAMPLE OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SOMETHING I HAVE TO LOOK INTO 
THREE THREE CHANGE BOTH THE BUTTONS AND AND THE COVER OR JUST THE COVER I'M NOT SURE WHICH WHICH IS USER IS 
UM ANYWAY YEAH THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AFTERWARDS 
JUST LUNCH BREAK AND HAVE MORE INDIVIDUAL WORK AFTER THAT SO LET'S SEE WHAT WE LET'S SEE W 
SO YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH A COMPONENTS CONCEPT YEAH 
I WANT SOME YOU SHOULD DO SOME TREND WATCHING BECAUSE EVEN IF WE'RE IF WE'RE GONNA DO THOSE COVERS AND EVERYTHING WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT 
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW IN THIS PHASE BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA BE THE ESSENTIAL FINAL DESIGN THAT WE'RE GONNA COME UP WITH 
UM 
YEAH I THINK USER INTERFACE IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS 
I MEAN IT SHOULD BE VERY INTUITIVE S YEAH IT SHOULD SPEAK FOR ITSELF 
UH FOR EXAMPLE I BOUGHT A REMOTE CONTROL LAST WEEK WITH A NEW T. V. 
IT WAS IT L IT'S LIKE ALL BUTTONS AND YOU HAVE AN IDEA WHAT IT DOES IT FIRST AND I'M TOTAL T. V. NEW ANYWAY 
SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE HAVE LESS OR L VERY LITTLE BUTTONS AND MAYBE A SECOND SECOND LEVEL MENU FOR THE ADVANCED THINGS 
OR MAYBE JUST STICK 'EM UNDER A MENU LIKE YOU SAID THE UM THE SOUND OPTIONS AND THE SURROUND AND WHATEVER THEY'RE MORE COMPLICATED 
JUST STICK 'EM UNDER ONE MENU AND UH GIVE IT A JUST PUT IT IN ONE IS IN A SOFTWARE PIECE 
YOU CAN MENU AND YOU CAN UH SELECT EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO TO SIT ON YOUR T. V. 
THAT IS TRUE 
NO THAT'S TRUE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BUT UH THERE'S A CHANCE IT'S NOT SO 
A DOUBLE SIDED REMOTE CONTROL 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S USEFUL 
YEAH BUT THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF WASTED BUTTONS 
FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A SONY T. V. AND THE HALF OF THE BUTTONS WON'T FUNCTION IF YOU HAVE A FOR A SONY THAT WON'T FOR A PHILIPS T. V. 
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD YEAH FOR EXAM 
I'M NOT SO YEAH 
FOR EX YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A LITTLE DECISION BETWEEN THE PART OF YOU WANT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL THAT IT SHOULD DO WHAT PEOPLE USUALLY DO WITH THEIR T. V. S 
NOT NOT THE VERY COMPLICATED SETTINGS THAT YOU CAN USUALLY DO THAT WITH UH THERE A OLD OLD REMOTE CONTROL IF THEY REALLY HATE THAT THING BUT 
YOU CAN'T YOU CANNOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL THE DIFFERENT BRANDS OF T. V. S 
I THINK THERE'S I THINK THERE IS A STANDARD FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN UH BECAUSE USUALLY THE THE MAIN IS THE MENU BUTTON IS IS USABLE BETWEEN DIFFERENT BRANDS 
ESPECIALLY THE BIG ONES THE BIG BRANDS SO 
'CAUSE EVERYBODY I HAVE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL AND IT CAN USE THE MENU BUTTON 
SO I THINK I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN PUT SOME RESEARCH INTO THAT IF IT'S POSSIBLE 
UH I THINK JUST A B AND THE NAVIGATION IS VERY BASIC IT'S USUALLY THE SAME THING 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
I THINK SO UH WE NEED TO PUT SOME RESEARCH INTO THAT IF IF WE CAN OPEN THE MEAN I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE JUST THE WAY HOW IT 
YEAH THEN THEN YOU COULD DO EVERYTHING I SUPPOSE BECAUSE USUALLY THE T. V. S HAVE THE THAT INSIDE IN THESE OTHER LITTLE PIECE OF SOFTWARE SO IT'S OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE DISTINCT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE IT'S THERE IT'S BOTH MAYB MAYBE THE SHAPE CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT 
MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE MORE CURVES OR WHATEVER 
SO UM 
YEAH THIS 
NOT SURE WHAT BECAUSE WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE LEFT FOR THE MEETING ANYWAY SO 
YEAH BUT IT WASN'T ME IT WAS HIM CLOSING SOMETHING 
SO ANYWAY YEAH WE COULD DO SOME I DO SOME WORK NOW IN IN THE DESIGN FOR EXAMPLE 
I MEAN WHAT DO YOU WANT DO YOU WANT BUT 
YEAH MAY MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
BUT THOUGH SMOOTH INSIDE 
SO YOU HAVE THE TRANSMITTER HERE FOR EXAMPLE 
LET'S SEE THAT YOU WHAT WOULD BE HANDY 
I THINK THAT THE THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE THE CHANNEL BUTTONS SHOULD BE UH IN THEIR OWN 
LET'S SEE IN TWO GOD DAMN IT 
YEAH OKAY 
ANOTHER ONE HERE 
LET'S SEE WHAT I THINK THIS SHOULD THESE ARE ALWAYS ON TOP OF THE OF THE CONTROL SO THEY SHOULD BE HERE 
THINK IT'S LIKE THIS 
WITHI WITHIN THE YEAH JUST TAKE IT 
DO YOU TAKE TRIANGLES OR 
UM I THINK IT SHOULD BE I THINK IT MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE 'EM BIGGER OR WHATEVER 
YEAH 
YEAH IN THE MIDDLE 
IT'S IT'S USUALLY UH THERE BUT 
MM 
YEAH BUT FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S LOST IN YOUR ARMCHAIR WE'LL NOT SO THE FLASH 
AND FLASH TAKES UP A LOT OF BATTERIES AGAIN 
YEAH 
YEAH I THOUGHT ABOUT FOR DEAF PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE SO 
WE COULD DO THAT 
UH LET'S SEE 
OH YEAH IT'S TRUE 
UM THAT THING SHOULD BE CONTROL 
YOU SHOULDN'T BE YOU UH SHOULDN'T PRESS IT BY ACCIDENT BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE STACKED AWAY SOMEWHERE 
YEAH 
YEAH LIKE THAT'S GONNA WORK 
YEAH I THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD MOVE THE BUTTONS DOWN AND PUT IT HERE FOR EXAMPLE IT 
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YOU SHOULD I THINK THE B THE POWER BUTTON SHOULD BE ON TOP 'CAUSE IT'S THE FIRST THING YOU DO TURN IT IN 
SO POWER BUTTON ON TOP 
UM 
MUTE 
DO WE HARDLY I THINK IT SHOULD BE AT THE BOTTOM SOMEWHERE 
MUTE 
TURN THE SOUND OFF 
I DON'T THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BUT I THINK IT I THINK IT SHOULD BE YOU C YOU COULD PUT IT SOMEWHERE HERE 
NO BECAUSE IT YEAH PEOPLE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO THAT IT'S 
CAN I HAVE THAT 
THAT'S J 
TAKE THIS OUT AND HERE IS 
UH ARE WE GONNA TAKE TRIANGLES ANYWAY 
I'M DRAWING TRIANGLES BUT 
YEAH IT'S MAYBE A BIGGER LESSER THAN THING 
SO ANYWAY I THINK THIS IS SHOULD BE 
THE CHANNELS AND OR SH 
HERE OKAY 
OKAY SHOULD WE CHAN OKAY THESE TWO CHANNEL 
UP AND DOWN 
WELL FOR THAT SO IT'S IN ONE PART IT'S UM IT'S A GOOD THING TO RECHARGE IT 
MAYBE WE SHOULD WHAT WHAT COULD BE POSSIBLE IS ONE WITH RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES FOR EXAMPLE 
YOU HAVE JUST PUT PENLITE BATTERIES THAT ARE RECHARGEABLE BECAUSE IT'S NO IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY ANNOYING 
I'M NOT SURE Y I'M NOT SURE IT'S IF IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT JUST TAKE A LOOK AT IT BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE A VERY GOOD IDEA 
BECAUSE IF IT'S IT'S UH USEFUL TO HAVE TO RECHARGEABLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
IF YOU DON'T WANT RECHA IF YOU FORGOT TO RECHARGE IT AND YOU WANNA WATCH T. V. NOW 
YOU WANNA BE ABLE TO PUT DIFFERENT BATTERIES IN IT IS IT NOW AND NOT IN HALF AN HOUR 
HOW ABOUT 
I THINK I HAVE A NICE IDEA 
NOT EXACTLY UH 
I THINK IT'S UH IT'S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA TO HAVE UH LIKE SORT OF A MAYBE A BASE STATION THAT YOU PUT IN THE T. V. 
COULD BE FLAT YOU COULD INSERT YOUR UH REMOTE INTO IT 
I'M NOT SURE 
A WHITE 
WELL 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE WANTED TO INSERT EITHER A BEEP OR A FLASH INTO THE THING WITH A LITTLE SEPARATE SIGNAL OR SO YOU COULD PUT THAT IN A T. V. FOR EXAMPLE 
IT COULD BE VERY FLAT COULD BE VERY SMALL 
IT'S A VERY SMALL YEAH I'M DRAWING TOO BIG NOW BUT AS YOU CAN PUT YOUR REMOTE ON FLAT FOR EXAMPLE 
AND AT THE BACKSIDE OF REMOTE JUST JUST JUST A LITTLE HOLE 
FOR EXAMPLE UM YOU JUST PUT IT DOWN TO RECHARGES FOR EXAMPLE 
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE 
I'M NOT SURE IF IT COSTS A LOT THAT THAT'S WHAT UH OR 
THAT'S THAT YOU THAT'S WHAT YOU BUY YOURSELF 
IT'S JUST AN IDEA WE HAVE TO FIND OUT IF IT'S POSSIBLE 
DO THEY WANT BUT THEY WANT A RECHARGEABLE ONE 
I'M NOT SURE YOU SHOULD FIND OUT IF IT'S IF RECHARGEABLE IS IMPORTANT 
YEAH 
THEY WANT TO PAY FOR COMFORT 
WE JUST ASSU WE WE COULD EITHER MAKE A SEPARATE STATION WHICH JUST SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE REMOTE CONTROL TO EITHER BEEP OR FLASH TO FIND OUT 
UM AND 
YEAH WE HAVE TO EITHER THAT OR MAKE IT INTEGRATED WITH A WITH A DOCKING STATION 
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD ACTUALLY 
I LIKE THE BEEP PART ANYWAY 
SO UM LET'S GO THROUGH THE 
COVERS IS COVERS IS GOOD 
YEAH IT'S UH WE CAN SAVE THIS 
UP AND SAVED 
WE EVEN SAVED THE UNIT 
UM 
OKAY 
SO WHAT WE HAVE SO YOU HAVE I THINK YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT OF WORK ON IF IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THE COST 
MAYBE YEAH OR MAYBE YOU CAN FIND IT I WHAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY 
WE ARE GOING FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS SALES PRICE BUT JUST TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT 
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY MORE 
WE COULD ALSO A LITTLE PROFIT AND MAYBE ATTRACT MORE CUSTOMERS UH WE JUST HAVE TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
YEAH IF YOU HAVE SOME FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT THAT'D BE NICE SO 
HMM 
NO IT WASN'T WASN'T ALLO IT WAS POSSIBLE NOT ALLOWED US 
SO THAT'S UM WHY I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SHARE DOCUMENTS IN THE ON THE DRAFT 
I DON'T CARE 
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY COMPLAINTS YET SO 
UM 
YEAH THE UH THEY INC UH THEY INCLUDE THE NEW ONE 
OR JUST FOR YOU 
OH NO I DIDN'T HAVE THAT 
ALL IT TELLS JUST LET'S MAKE MAKE A NEW TICK THE NEW ONE 
UM OTHER SIDE 
YEAH LET'S INCREASE IT A LITTLE BECAUSE 
YEAH DRAW US UP SOME SOME DESIGNS IF IF POSSIBLE JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THE IMPORTANT BUTTONS SHOULD BE ON TOP AND EITHER BIG 
SO THE MORE LESS IMPORTANT 
MORE OR LESS 
JUST PLAY A LITTLE WITH THIS PUT L SHIFT A LITTLE UP OR DOWN AND WE'LL SEE WHAT LOOKS BEST 
OR JUST PO POST YOUR DESIGNS FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PRODUCT SHARE 
YEAH SO WE DON'T WANT WE WANT VERY LITTLE BUTTONS JUST THE BUTTONS YOU USE A LOT 
WELL WHAT WE HAD FUNCTION THAT WHAT PEOPLE DO IS 
PEOPLE CHANGE CHANNELS PEOPLE THEY CHANGE THE VOLUME AND THEY THEY CHANGE CHANNEL THEY TURN T. V. OFF AND ONE FOR EXAMPLE 
THAT'S THE BASIC FU THAT'S WHAT YOU D I'M NOT SURE WHO PRESENT THAT AGAIN 
BUT THOSE ARE THE BASIC FUNCTION THAT PEOPLE USE IT FOR US THIS SHOULD BE VERY WELL REPRESENTED 
THAT'S TRUE BUT THAT'S WHAT WE STICK UNDER THE MENU BUTTON 
EVERYTHING SO YOU SAY ON EVERY T. V. THAT'S CONFIGURED UNDER THE MENU 
YEAH BUT 
BUT I THINK MOST MODERN T. V. S HAVE IT IN THEIR MENU 
UH WE'LL WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN COME UP WITH 
UNDER FORTY 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
THE WANT TO PAY FOR UH 
UH SHALL WE 
YOUNGER AGE SIXTEEN AND FORTY FIVE 
THAT'S ALL HERE HERE IT SAYS 
YEAH AGE SIXTEEN FORTY FI INTEREST IN MAIN FEATURES MORE CRITICAL 
OKAY SO WE'RE NOT FOCUSING ON THIS 
UM 
ALL THE INTEREST IN FEATURES NOT REALLY THE L. C. UH HERE 
WOULD YOU PAY FOR UH SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL 
HMM OKAY 
SPEECH RECOGNITION IS QUITE 
YEAH JUST LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITIES THEN BECAUSE IF APPARENTLY IT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT 
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A LUXURIOUS REMOTE MAYBE IT'S NOT EVEN THAT EXPENSIVE 
OR FIND A COMPROMISE MAYBE JUST A BLACK AND WHAT ARE FOR SOME EXTRA INFORMATION ON IT IN YOUR PROGRAMMES 
UM IT 
I MEAN WE ALL DO 
RIGHT 
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD PUT INTO CONSIDERATION 
APPARENTLY IT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT SO 
WE SHOULD USE OF WHAT IT COSTS IF IT'S POSSIBLE 
YEAH 
YEAH WE SHOULD DO A LITTLE THING ABOUT DESIGN BECAUSE IT LOOKS BORING REALLY TO ME 
EVEN IF YOU PUT IT EVEN IF YOU PUT A DIFFERENT COVER ON IT IT LOOKS STILL LOOKS BORING SO 
I HAVE NO CLUE 
I JUST DRAW SOMETHING WHAT WHICH WOULD FIT INTO YOUR HAND EASILY 
I THINK IT'S A VERY 
SORRY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE TO JU JUST KEEP IN MIND IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HEAVY 
I MEAN WE CAN STICK IT IN IN THERE I THINK 
HUH EVEN IF IN THE WORST CASE WE CAN EVEN COULD YOU GIVE ME THE PEN BACK 
SO LET'S SAY THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT AN L. C. D. THING 
LET'S TAKE TAKE THE BASIC DESIGN AGAIN WHAT WE OH CRAP UH COME UP WITH 
I'LL JUST MAKE IT A LITTLE BIGGER NOW 
IS A TRANSMITTER HERE 
ANYWAY 
WE COULD LET'S SAY WE HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN PEOPLE WANT AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
SO THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY PUT IT HERE 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE REALLY BIG BUT JUST JUST HAVE TO BE HAS TO BE THERE 
THINK IT'S A GOOD PLACE PEOPLE DON'T 
NO 
IT'S NOT THAT UH IT'S NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IT'S JUST AN EXTRA THING 
IT JUST YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS ON TOP BECAUSE YOUR FINGER IS ON TOP 
HOW CAN YOU USE AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH BUT WHY I I'M NOT SURE 
UH IF YOU T IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON YOU CAN USE IT OR I'M NOT SURE WHA I'M TRYING TO IMAGINE MYSELF WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE 
YOU WOULD PREFER TO AN OKAY 
SO WE HAVE OTHER PEOPLE SAYING IT SHOULD BE ON TOP 
OKAY BUT THEN YOU WOULD WOULD S HAVE TO STACK AWAY YOUR BUTTONS SOMEWHERE ELSE 
ANYWAYS 
UH THIS LOOKS A LITTLE 
BUT THE L. C. D. S THING 
WELL IF IT IF IT'S IF IT'S POSSIBLE WE IF IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE WE SHOULD INCLUDE IT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S COOL 
UH WE HAVE GREEN NOW UH 
OR MAYBE WE SHOULD UM WE COULD UH DRAW DRAW SOMETHING A BIT THAT HAS TO IN IN IN THE BOTTOM 
MAYBE IN A CIRCLE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE WE LIKE IN THIS EXAMPLE 
I THINK THIS IS NOT GOOD BUT FOR WE COULD MAKE CIRCULAR BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE 
FOR UP AND DOWN MA MAKE IT A CIRCLE IN IT BECAUSE IT 
I THINK THE CHANNEL BUTTON SHOULD BE IN THE CENTRE 
CHANNEL BUTTON SHOULD BE ST STICK TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN THIS SECTION 
BECAUSE IT'S UH 
WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THE SIZE ANYWAY JUST A GENERAL DESIGN 
YOU CAN MAKE IT IS BIG SO YOU WANT 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU TAKE UH 
NO LET'S SEE 
FOR EXAMPLE JUST 
YEAH 
I DON'T THINK IF WE IF WE EVEN AS AN L. C. D. SCREEN WE NEED TO DEFINITELY 
YEAH BUT WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE SO WHAT THE SIZE SO 
THE L. C. D. DOESN'T HAVE TO N DOESN'T NEED TO BE VERY BIG 
MM LET'S SEE 
FINISH MEETING NOW 
OKAY WE WILL 
SO THERE 
WE THERE WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT 
EITHER THIS IN THIS THIS COULD BE THE LUXURIOUS ONE 
SO WE HAVE CHANNEL BUTTONS HERE 
I'M JUST DRAWING SOMETHING UH 
OH 
I THINK THIS WOULD THIS WOULD LOOK COOL 
YOU COULD HAVE TO FOR EXAMPLE 
SMALL BUTTONS HERE FOR SOME EXTRA FUNCTIONS SO IF YOUR BASIC FUNCTION'S HERE WE SHOULD LIKE WE DECIDED BEFORE PROGRAMMES UP AND DOWN 
AND VOLUME HERE 
WELL YOU CAN JUST ONE I'M NOT SURE IF WE CAN DO THAT BUT WE COULD PUT A MICROPHONE ON HERE FOR EXAMPLE 
JUST TO DO RESEARCH INTO BOTH W WHAT IT COSTS AND WHAT IT TAKES FREE SPACE 
BUT LET'S CUT THE MEETING FOR NOW YES 
YEAH LET'S THINK OF A NAME OKAY 
OH OKAY 
OKAY AT ANYWAYS THE THE MINUTES WILL BE IN THE ON THE WEB SHORTLY SO THERE WE GO UH 
YEAH IT ALL 
OKAY WE 
MM 
OKAY THAT'S FINE 
UM 
OKAY NOW WORK A LITTLE WITH UM 
OKAY 
WELL LET'S START TO USE IT IS 
OKAY UH THE METHOD 
THERE ARE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED UH YOU ALREADY UH TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT 
WHICH BUTTONS ARE WANTED UH IS OUR REMOTE CONTROL UNIVERSAL OR SHOULD TO BE PROGRAMMABLE 
UH IF IT SHOULD BE PROGRAMMEAB GRAMMEALE THEN WE NEED UM SOMETHING LIKE A MODE THAT YOU CAN SWITCH IT 
BECAUSE THEN THE BUTTONS HAVE TO SEND IT A DIFFERENT SIGNAL THEN THEY WOULD NORMALLY DO 
AND UH HOW BIG IS THE REMOTE CONTROL UH GOING TO BE 
I'LL TELL YOU WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME 
UM THERE ARE A LOT OF TECHNICAL PARTS IN THE REMOTE CONTROL 
SO UH UH THAT'S WHY I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SAY UH G A LITTLE BIT EASY ON THE DESIGNS 
UH I HEARD AB UH YOU TALKING ABOUT BEEPS AND BUT UH VIDEO SCREENS BUT UH THE MATERIAL INSIDE AND THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS ARE QUITE COMPLEX ALREADY 
SO KEEP IN MIND THAT EVERYTHING THAT YOU KEEP UH THINK IF IT HAS TO BE TO BE BUILT 
SO IT'S THAT'S NOT SO EASY AS IT IS MIGHT LOOK LIKE 
UH MATERIAL STUDY I'M WORKING ON THAT UM FOR THE THE COSTS 
I HAVE TO CHECK OUT HOW FAR I CAN GO WITH THAT 
NORMALLY A CIRCUIT BOARD IS MADE OF FIBREGLASS UH AND THE WIRES ARE MADE OF COPPER 
UH THAT IS HOW IT IS DONE AND ALL THE REMOTE CONTROLS WORK THAT WAY I THINK WE CAN JUST GO ON WITH THAT 
UM THEN I'VE READ MORE INTEGRATION OF MATERIALS MEANS LESS COST FOR THE PRODUCTION 
THE MORE WE CAN MAKE UH AT ONCE UH IN ONE PIECE UH THAT IS CHEAPER 
EXACTLY SO IF WE MAKE A CIRCUIT BOARD WITH THE THE CONNECTIONS ALREADY ON IT THEN THAT'S CHEAPER 
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TOO DIFFICULT IN DESIGN AGAIN 
THIS IS WHAT LOOK LIKE UH LOOKS LIKE IF YOU PRESS ONE BUTTON IS THIS IS NOT THE ENTIRE THING 
YOU HAVE THE THE POWER COMING IN THEN YOU HAVE LIKE A SWITCH 
THE SWITCH UH UH UH IF YOU P PRESS IT THEN SOME ELECTRICAL CHARGE GOES INTO THE PROCESSOR 
THAT THINKS OVER A MORSE CODE THAT'S HOW YOU SHOULD USE IT 
THE MORSE CODE GOES TO THE AMPLIFIER THEN UH THE SIGNAL IS SENT TO TWO UH LIGHT BULBS 
YOU HAVE INFRARED AND ONE INTERV UM UH HOW TO SAY IT 
UH A LIGHT IN INDICATION LIGHT THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S FUNCTIONING 
UH HERE AGAIN THAT'S MY STORY ABOUT THE DIFFERENT MODES IF YOU DO WANT TO MAKE REMOTE UH UNIVERSAL 
THEN THE PROCESSOR HAS TO UH MAKE UP A DIFFERENT MORSE CODE WHEN SOME BUTTON IS PRESSED 
THAT MAKES IT MUCH MORE COMPLEX SO WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A LOOK DO WE WANT THAT ARE NOT 
UH I DON'T HAVE ANY PERSONAL P UH PREFERENCES UH AS FAR EXCEPT FOR UH THE MATERIALS TO BE USED UH LIGHT THAT THEY ARE LIGHT 
THAT WAS IT 
HMM 
YEAH 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
NO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA 
BUT 
GO AHEAD 
YOU 
YES I THINK SO IT 
YEAH 
OKAY UH 
MM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
I HAVE TO CHECK THAT IT I'M NOT SURE 
THAT MUST BE POSSIBLE 
JA 
I'M SORRY WHE WHERE DO YOU WANNA HIT THE T. YOU WANNA WE WANT A BUTTON ON THE TELEVISION 
IN THE OKAY BUT THAT RULES OUT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL 
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE UH 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
OKAY THEN UH I'D I'D LIKE TO KNOW NOW IF WE WANT THE UH UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL OR NOT BECAUSE THAT'S UH DETERMINES EVERYTHING I'M GONNA DO 
IF NOT OKAY 
OKAY THEN I GO FOR THAT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
NO IT'S FINE WITH UM BUT THEN I KNOW WHAT IT LIKE FOR 
UH-HUH 
MM-HMM 
EXACTLY 
I ALREADY NOTED THAT 
MM OKAY 
OKAY 
HMM 
IF WE UH MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH CHANGEABLE COVERS THEN WE CAN ALSO MAKE UH A COVER FOR EVERY LANGUAGE OR 
THAT'S OF USE UH ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN READ IT READ IT IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE 
THAT'S OKAY OKAY 
HUH 
OH OKAY 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 
OKAY 
UH BUT I KNOW THAT THE BUTTONS ARE LIKE A NOKIA TELEPHONE IN UH ONE SLEEVE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR WHOLE COVER 
UH WE CAN MAKE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN ONLY REMOVE THE SLEEVE 
KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
IT WORKS THE SAME AS A NOKIA TELEPHONE IT'S IT'S IN MY UH 'KAY 
EXACTLY 
HMM 
MM 
I DON'T THINK SO 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
BECAUSE THE TELEVISION NEEDS TO RESPOND TO THE SIGNAL AND IF IT DOESN'T KNOW HOW IT'S EXACTLY THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE 
HMM 
MM 
MM 
BUT THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
MM OKAY 
MM 
BUT I THINK THERE MUST BE A WAY UH TO INVOKE THE MORE COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS OF A TELEVISION 
FOR INSTANCE IF YOUR OLD REMOTE CONTROL IS BROKEN AND YOU BUY OURS 
THEN UH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET EVERYTHING OUT OF THE TELEVISION THAT'S ON IT 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'LL LOSE FUNCTIONS BY BUYING OR 
OKAY I TH I THINK SO IT 
AND I THINK THAT OUR OUR REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD NOT LIKE LIKE UH ANY OTHER 
FOR INSTANCE UH SONY MAKES ALL THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS EXACTLY THE SAME FOR ALL THEIR DEVICES 
AND YOU ALWAYS GRAB THE WRONG ONE BECAUSE FORMATTING OF THE BUTTONS IS EXACTLY THE SAME ONLY THE LABELS ARE DIFFERENT 
WE SHOULD NOT DO THAT 
EXACTLY 
MM THAT'S YOUR UH DIVISION 
HMM 
YEAH 
PERHAPS WE SHOULD ALSO MAKE UH SOMETHING LIKE A FLASH ON IT IF YOU IF IT'S LOST FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE DEAF 
THEY THEY WON'T HEAR THE THE BEEP 
YEAH 
OH 
YEAH IT'S TRUE BUT IT'S IT'S ONLY HAS TO DO IS WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTON THAT IT'S LOST 
SO 
DEAF PEOPLE 
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S POSSIBLE 
MM 
YEAH ME TOO 
SHALL WE UH ALSO LIKE IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE A RECHARGEABLE REMOTE 
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY NEW BATTERIES OF EVERY 
MM YEAH 
OH 
BUT THAT'S ALREADY POSSIBLE 
YES 
YES 
OKAY 
UH YOU COULD MAKE A DEVICE BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT UH AS POSSIBLE WITH THE COSTS THAT YOU CAN PUT IN NORMAL BATTERIES 
RECHARGEABLE BUT IT YOU'RE THE REMOTE ALSO CAN ACT AS A RECHARGER 
SO THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE YOU HAVE EVERY DECISION 
KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
YOU CAN UH PUT IN NORMAL PENLITES RECHARGEABLE PENLITES BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE RECHARGED WITH THE REMOTE WITH A WIRE 
SO BUT 
BUT I THINK THAT WILL COST A LOT 
UH A NORMAL WIRE WOULD BE BETTER 
LIKE A LIKE A P. D. A. A HAND HELD 
YOU CAN UH JUST PUT IT IN THE ELECTRICITY AND IT CHARGES ITSELF YOU DON'T NEED BASIC STATION 
YES 
THAT IS POSSIBLE THAT'S TRUE 
MM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
YES 
I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIND THAT IT 
I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THIS BUT 
HMM 
THESE ARE UH COMFORT ISSUES 
SO I THINK PEOPLE WILL PAY THEY WANTED TO PAY FOR COMFORT 
WELL THIS IS COMFORT 
YES 
HMM 
YEAH 
EXACTLY 
I THINK THIS IS A BRILLIANT PRODUCT 
I WOULD BUY IT MYSELF 
OH 
I LIKE THE COVERS 
THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA 
I NEVER THOUGHT 
I HOPE IF I HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT I'M GONNA 
MM 
YEAH 
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A DECISION 
WHAT IT COSTS AND WHAT KIND OF MATERIALS THAT WE CAN UH CHOOSE WHAT WE WANT ON IT AND EXACTLY I NEED TO 
WAS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO UH SEND EMAILS AROUND THE OFFICE 
NOT 
YEAH OKAY 
WHAT UH WHAT DID YOU WANNA SAY 
MM 
MM 
MM 
BUT THAT'S THE QUESTION IS IT 
BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE CONFIGURED IN THE TELEVISION UNDER THE MENU 
IF IT ISN'T THEN WE CANNOT REACH IT 
I THINK SO IT 
I THINK SO IT 
UH ISN'T THERE A POSSIBILITY TO DO RESEARCH ON THAT SO WE KNOW THAT FOR SURE 
IF YOU RULE OUT FUNCTIONS THEN UH AND THAT GETS KNOWN THEN PEOPLE ARE NOT GONNA BUY IT 
THEN THE CONSUMER BOND OR SOMETHING SAYS UH YOU CANNOT DO THIS AND THAT WITH IT 
THAT'S A BAD BAD COM COMMERCIAL FOR OKAY 
THAT'S TRUE 
HMM 
HMM 
DID THEY REALLY SAID IT LIKE THAT 
THESE TWO THINGS 
DO THEY REALISE HOW MUCH THAT COSTS 
THAT'S ALMOST UNDOABLE 
NO THAT'S THAT'S 
EVEN IF I IF WE HAVE THIS LOST UNIT THEN WE CANNOT DO IT FOR THAT PRICE 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
MM 
HMM 
OH 
UH I 
BUT I REALLY NEED FINANCE INFORMATION 
WE ALL DO 
MM 
OH 
HMM 
AND THE DESIGN IT SHOULD DIFFER 
THIS IS PHILIPS HUH 
PHILIPS HAS THIS 
OKAY 
HMM 
OH 
MM 
UH I REALISE IF WE MAKE IT SMALL THEN IT NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE THICKER BECAUSE I NEED TO PUT ALL THE ELECTRONICS IN IT 
IF WE MAKE IT IS UH SMALLER UH LESS WIDE 
THEN WE NEED TO M MAKE IT A LITTLE THICKER BECAUSE I HAVE TO PUT ALL THE ELECTRONICS IN IT 
NO 
HMM 
UM IT 
UH BUT 
HMM 
NO 
UM I PERSONALLY WOULD PREFER IT IN THE TOP 
HUH 
BUT IT 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
THEY WANT TO UH 
WE SHOULD JUST TRY TO MAKE THAT IF IT'S POSSIBLE 
IF IT IS POSSIBLE WE SHOULD REALLY DO IT BUT WE NEED THAT INFORMATION 
ALSO KEEP IN MIND AGAIN THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS VERY FLAT BUT IT NEEDS TRANSISTORS RESISTORS I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE AND THAT NEEDS SPACE 
SO I HAVE TO LOOK IF THAT'S POSSIBLE 
BUT IF WE 
HMM 
HMM 
IF WE HAVE A A SPACE ISSUE WE CAN ALSO LOSE ONE BATTERY 
TO USE RECHARGEABLE SO WE CAN STICK WITH ONE INSTEAD OF TWO 
THAT MIGHT BE AN OPTION 
YEAH BUT IF WE NEED TWO BATTERIES AND AN L. C. D. SCREEN THAT MEANS A LOT OF SPACE THAT WE NEED 
BUT IT HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER 
OKAY 
NO BUT THE THINGS BEHIND IT 
SPACE 
LIKE A PROCESS UH 
I LIKE THIS ONE MORE 
MM 
MM 
I'LL TRY TO 
NO MORE UH THING I'D LIKE TO SAY UH LET'S GIVE THIS UH A NAME 
AND NOT LIKE SOME VAGUE SERIAL NUMBER THAT ONE ONE UNDERSTANDS LIKE WITH CARS 
SHALL WE ALL TRY UH TO THINK ABOUT A NAME 
GOOD LUCK 
YEAH I'VE DO WE UH SAVE THE 
OH THERE UH SO 
GO AHEAD 
THAT'S PRETTY SHOCKING UH 
WHICH CHANNEL SELECTION 
OH OKAY 
SO THAT MANAGEABLE 
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS PRETTY EXPENSIVE TO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
SHALL I GO 
OKAY 
SO SOME TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS 
BASICALLY I HAVE SOME ISSUES WHICH YOU DISCUSSED EARLIER 
UH LET'S JUST START WITH THE METHOD 
IT SOUNDS REALLY SAY WHAT DOES THE USER DO WHAT DOES THE THE REMOTE CONTROL DO BUT THERE ARE QUITE SOME ISSUES 
SO THE THINGS I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON OR THE USER ASPECT BECAUSE THE TECHNICAL ASPECT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH COVERED 
WE CAN DO THAT 
WHAT GOES WRONG 
AT THE USER 
GETS THE REMOTE CONTROL 
WHERE IS THE REMOTE CONTROL 
WE'VE ALL HAD IT ONCE I WANT TO WATCH SOME TELEVISION WHERE'S THE REMOTE CONTROL 
THAT WAS ONE OF YOUR IDEAS WHICH YOU POSTED IN THE NETWORK FOLDER A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
UH THESE ARE JUST THE ISSUES 
I CAME OUT SOME UH PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FINDINGS POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS LATER 
SEARCHES FOR THE BUTTON 
THERE ARE MANY BUTTONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH ARE NOT CLEAR 
UH IS THERE WE ALSO THOSE ARE WE TRY TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR 
UH ALSO SYMBOLS TEND TO FADE AFTER A WHILE 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE ANNOYING THAN FADED SYMBOLS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH CHANNEL IS THIS BUTTON IS POSSIBLY WE COULD FIND UH SOMETHING FOR THAT YES 
UH COVERED THAT 
OH YES USER PRESSES THE BUTTON 
UM USUALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS BUTTONS ARE SMALL 
SO YOU PRESS MORE NICE REMOTE CONTROL GOES 
KABLOUEY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION NOT TO PUT IT MINE TOO MANY BUTTONS ON UH THE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND POSSIBLY ALSO THE SIZE IS MORE IMPORTANT BUTTONS BIGGER S 
SO THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT I UH HAD IN MIND IN THE FADE PROOF SYMBOLS LOCATOR A SOUND UH IS CLEAR WE SHOULD STICK TO EXISTING SYMBOLS 
BUT MAYBE WE COULD DO A LITTLE UH INVESTIGATION TO SEE WHETHER SOME SYMBOLS ARE UH NEED TO BE REPLACED BY OTHERS 
OH 
THIS I PRETTY MUCH COVERED 
SO WHAT WE WANT TO GO TO USE INTO THIS ONE BIT MORE LESS BUTTONS EASY SOME BIGGER BUTTONS 
SO THAT'S BASICALLY UH WHAT I HAD IN MIND 
THIS IS NOT THE FINAL DESIGN THIS IS JUST A GENERAL IDEA OF HOW I'D LIKE TO USE UH BASICALLY THE GENERAL IDEA 
SO THAT WAS IT 
YEAH I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OH 
SO IT MANAGEABLE 
SO IT EASY 
YEAH 
AND IT COSTS TOO MUCH TO FABRICATE SO WE'RE IN A TIGHT BUDGET HERE 
AND IT'S 
MAYBE JUST A SLAP ON STICKER WITH A BUTTON WHICH SENDS OUT A SMALL SIGNAL 
YEAH EXACTLY 
AND IT'S 
BESIDES THAT THE TECHNOLOGY ISN'T REALLY SUPER YET SO THAT IS A PROBLEM IN IMPLEMENTING THIS 
IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT IT'S JUST NOT I DON'T THINK THE MARKET'S RIPE FOR THAT YET 
BUT SHOULD THE EXCHANGEABLE COVERS INCLUDE THE BUTTONS THEMSELVES OR JUST THE 
C THAT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE WITH THE TEXT THEN 
OH YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
YEAH 
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD 
SO IT TECHNI TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE TO UH SEND A SIGNAL TO A TELEVISION AND THEN POPS UP A MENU 
BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF TELEVISION SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THAT 
IT'S IN IN BUILT MENU ISN'T IT 
YES 
SO BASICALLY WE 
ARE WE COULD USE A DOUBLE SIDED FOR LESS USED FUNCTIONS YOU 
YEAH WITH THE COVER 
I IT'S BASICALLY AN IDEA TO OVERCOME THESE ISSUES BECAUSE 
NO BUT BASIC FUNCTIONS BUT FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE NOT FREQUENTLY USED 
BECAUSE IF WE USE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MOST BUTTONS ON IT IS 
YEAH 
YEAH I HAVE SOME IDEAS 
I HAVE SOME IDEAS 
I'LL PUT SOME ON PAPER AND PRESENT THEM NEXT TIME UH THE IDEAS THAT I HAVE 
I HEARD A BEEP GO 
YEAH BUT WE LIKE SOME SOME CURVES OR 
YEAH 
UH WE GET THE GENERAL IDEAS YES 
YEAH AND SINCE YOU'RE HOLDING IT LIKE THIS I SUGGEST YOU PUT THE CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN AND VOLUME YEAH YEAH 
SO YOU HAVE THE UP CHANNEL 
THE DOWN CHANNEL THE VOLUME DO WE WANT THAT HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL 
THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO USE 
YEAH BUT THIS IS JUST A G GENERAL IDEA 
UH MAYBE THE MENU BUTTON CAN GO I IN THE MIDDLE 
WOAH 
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND OUT 
WE COULD MAKE A COMBINATION THAT IT GOES BEEP AND THAT YOU THAT SOME LIGHT LIGHTS UP 
SO WE HAVE THE BASIC CHANNELS WE'VE GOT HERE UH THE POWER BUTTON 
SOMEWHERE OVER HERE 
I USUALLY 
PRESS IT ON TOP 
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I'M ACCUSTOMED TO 
WHAT WOULD YOU LOOK AT 
OKAY MUTE BUTTON 
SO THAT SOMEWHERE HERE 
SO THAT USED OFTEN 
THE MUTE BUTTON 
DO PEOPLE USE THAT OFTEN 
'CAUSE UH I'M PRETTY MUCH ACCUSTOMED TO IT RIGHT OVER HERE AT LEAST IN GENERAL BUT 
IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT ONE 
SURE 
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO AREN'T THEY 
WELL I'M ACCUSTOMED TO THE CHANNELS BEING ON TOP 
BUT ISN'T THAT EXPENSIVE IN THE ENTIRE PACKAGE 
BUT AGAIN ISN'T THAT TOO EXPENSIVE 
'CAUSE THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES A DOCKING STATION 
AND DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT THAT 
TO PAY EXTRA THEY WANT TO PAY FOR RECHARGEABLE 
CAN CAN WE SAVE THIS OR 
YEAH 
COULD YOU POST SOME OTHER ESSENTIALS OF WHAT PEOPLE WANT IS THAT I CAN WORK WITH SOME BUTTONS WHERE TO PUT IT 
YOU SEEM TO HAVE INFORMATION ON THAT I'D LIKE TO UH 
SO SOME OF IT 
NO IT'S NOT 
NO 
UH YOUR COMPUTER 
OKAY 
WELL I HAVE YOUR POWERPOINT PRESENTATION I CAN GET SOME INF INFORMATION OUT OF THAT 
LET'S SEE 
UH WHERE WOULD WE 
WHERE WOULD WE WANT THE UH TELETEXT BUTTON 
BECAUSE WE DECIDED THAT IT'S N NOT THAT IMPORTANT 
DO WE PUT IT SOMEWHERE OVER HERE 
OR MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING FOR THE NEXT MEETING I CAN DRAW IT SOME IDEAS 
YEAH 
WELL WE HAVE DECIDED MORE OR LESS THE BASIC STRUCTURE 
I CAN PUT THE OTHER BUTTONS ON 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MAYBE ANOTHER IDEA UH 
YES BUT IT SHOULD COVER ALL THE FUNCTIONS SO POSSIBLY JUST AN IDEA THAT POPPED IN 
YEAH BUT WE COULD GO A STEP FURTHER BECAUSE SOME T. V. S HAVE THE UH POSSIBILITY TO ADJUST BRIGHTNESS THAT KIND OF MENUS 
YES BUT IT 
BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING 
WE NEED TO ADJUST IT THE TECHNOLOGY 
TRUE 
NO I TH 
UH WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE THEN WITH AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
WELL I DOUBT IT BUT 
WELL I HAD BASICALLY 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
TO MAKE IT KIND OF FUTURISTIC 
SO WHAT KIND OF 
YEAH SURE 
NOW IT'S PRETTY MUCH TUCKED AWAY ON YOUR HAND 
I'M 
I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED OF THE 
YEAH 
SO BASICALLY CAN I WHAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE NOW IS UH WHAT GOES ON TOP 
DO WE PUT THE VOLUME CONTROL AND THE CHANNEL CONTROL HERE OR DO WE PUT IT IN UH WOULD WE LIKE TO PRESS IT IN THE MIDDLE 
YES BUT WE DO AGREE THAT WE KEEP THIS AT THE CENTRE BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION 
WELL THAT WOULD MAKE THEM QUITE SMALL 
SO MAYBE YOU'D PUT THEM HERE 
YES BUT A BIG REMOTE CONTROL PROBABLY NOT SOMETHING WHICH PEOPLE WOULD LIKE 
SO WOULD WE LIKE THIS OR WOULD WE LIKE THE 
LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE HERE 
OKAY 
SO I THINK OF A NAME 
SO 
YES GO AND FINISH UP AND I'LL SEE YOU TO LUNCH 
YEAH 
YES 
SORRY A LITTLE BIT OF PL LITTLE PROBLEM WITH COMPUTER 
OH 
YEAH SURE NO PROBLEM 
UM THERE WAS A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH MY COMPUTER IS NOT UH THE WHOLE UH PRESENTATION UH 
YEAH 
UM 
OKAY AND 
I WANT TO OPEN THE MY IS UH NO 
OH NO THAT'S OKAY 
UH SLIDE SHOW 
YES 
THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS IT'S UH UH VERY IMPORTANT FOR UH THE USER HE HE WANTS TO YEAH 
THE THE METHOD WE SAID UH IT IT'S NOT UM NOT A SLIDE BECAUSE IT WENT WRONG ABOUT THE METHOD WE USE UH 
UM WE TESTED IT W UH WITH UH A HUNDRED UH MINE 
AND WE ASKED THEM TO WE UH WHAT THE REMOTE UH F FEEL UH LOOK AND UH WHAT WHAT'S UH IMPORTANT 
OH 
PEOPLE SORRY 
BOTH WOMEN AND MINE YEAH 
OKAY 
UH THE FINDINGS UM UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY 
UM 
YEAH AND YEAH MOST TH TH THEY WANT TO SPEND MONEY FOR A BETTER SYSTEM FOR BETTER REMOTE CONTROL 
SO WE CAN DO UH A L A LITTLE UH NICE THINGS WITH IT AND UM THEY S YEAH 
THEY USE ZAP A LOT UM UH FIFTY PERCENT SAY THEY ONLY 
SO THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS 
UM UH YEAH NOT ALL OF IT IS IT ON MINE 
IN MY POWERPOINT PRESENTATION ABOUT UM UH THE RELEVANT BUTTONS ARE THE POWER THE CHANNEL SELECTION AND THE VOLUME SELECTION 
IT'S UH THE MOST BASIC BUTTONS THAT A USER WANTS UH TO USE 
UH LESS IMPORTANT IS TEL TELETEXT 
UH UM THEY USE IT 
BUT IT'S NOT UH VERY UH IMPORTANT UH IN THE SCALE OF ZERO TO TEN THEY SIX AND A HALF UH AND BUT NOT IMPORTANT IS THE CHANNEL SELECTION 
THE THE HMM 
UH THE THE NO NO NO NO NO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT UH WE NEED NOT IMPORTANT IN THE AUDIO SETTINGS DISPLAY SETTINGS AND UH 
YEAH 
UM NEW PREFERENCES PREFERENCES 
UH UM UM BEEP TO FIND YOUR CONTROL WAS THAT WAS IN THE TEST 
THE THE MOST PEOPLE UH F FIND IT UH IRRITATING UH WHEN THEY CANNOT FIND A REM THEIR REMOTE CONTROL 
SO UH I THINK IT'S A BEE BEEP TO SEND IT AND UH YOU CAN FIND OUT 
AND ANOTHER THING UH THEY WANT WAS UH SPEECH RECOGNITION UM SO THEY CAN SAY UH WHAT THEY WANT TO LET'S GO TO CHANNEL ONE AND UH THAT'S UH KIND OF THINGS 
AND THEY WANT MAYBE IN UH L. C. D. SCREEN UM TO TO LOOK AT UM WH WHAT'S ON EVERY CHANNEL UH AND UH WHAT DO I WENT WITH IT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
UM 
OH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES IS UH A BUTTON FOR MY FAVOURITE CHANNEL SO I CAN UH I DUNNO SO I CAN ZAP TO MY UH 
IF UH QUICK UH TO MY FAVOURITE CHANNEL WH WHAT I UH IS THE REMOTE MU MUST USE OUR UM 
MOST UM SO WHA WHAT MINE PREFERENCES ARE FOR WHICH CHANNEL SO I CAN ZAP T T 
WHAT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
RECOGNISE 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S UH WHAT MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE LIKE 
IN ITSELF 
MAYBE IT'S EASIER TO TO SELL IT BUT 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S MANAGEABLE BUT WE WILL UH WE WILL SEE 
YEAH IT'S A LITTLE BIT UH IT'S THE END OF IT 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT UH I LOST AT THE COMPUTER UH CRASHED SO 
YEAH 
DARN COMPUTER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM UH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH AND THEY WANT TO PAY FOR IT AND UH 
WITH MORE 
WHERE WITH MORE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS 
IN THE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT UH 
YEAH WITH WITH AN L. C. D. SCREEN YOU CAN 
WHY 
NOKIA W 
OH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM UH 
YEAH 
UM 
EVERYONE HE WANTS TO BUY IT IS W W YEAH 
YEAH 
OR NO 
OR WHEN YOU SAY ONE TWO UH I IT UH IT'S ENOUGH RIGHT 
BUT 
OH YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT B 
BUT EVERY 
OH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
MM YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
UM YEAH 
AND UH WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS UH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OH 
AND A LIGHT UH 
VOLUME 
UH IT'S IT'S FINE I THINK 
UH DO 
YEAH 
JUST 
AND L. E. D. UH ON IT 
JUST A LIGHT ON IT OR 
VERY IMPORTANT 
OH THAT'S 
IT'S 
AND 
BUT YOU ARE 
AND YOU ARE READING FROM THE T YOU ALWAYS READ FROM THE TOP TO THE THE BOTTOM OF IT 
YEAH SO IT'S 
YEAH 
SO I IT'S SORRY 
NO IT'S ONE 
OH 
HMM 
OR OR WITH THE VOLUME SELECTION 
ROUND UH NOT UH NOT AT TOP TO THE AROUND THE VOLUME SELECTION 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE EXACTLY BUT 
WOAH 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S BETTER 
IN THE RIGHT 
YEAH 
MAYBE IT'S MORE EX EXPENSIVE 
YEAH 
HMM 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S G 
BUT 
WHICH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
BUT 
YEAH THEY WANT TO PAY FOR IT 
YEAH 
THE UH THERE WAS NOT A EL ASK ESQUE 
BUT 
BUT IF HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MY COMPUTER CRASHED SO UH 
I LOST MY UH PRESENTATION ABOUT 
I HAVE THE UH 
YEAH BUT I 
HERE I HAVE THE THE USE THE HOMEPAGE OF UH OR 
INTERNET AND HERE IS MY 
HERE IS MY MARKETING REPORT MAYBE YOU C YOU CAN LOOK AT UH THAT AND 
OH YEAH 
AND ONE 
AND UH WHA WHAT PEOPLE WANT 
I'VE UH 
I HAVE ANOTHER THING UH 
YEAH 
UM 
UH WHAT I AL ALREADY SAID IS THE THE UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE ALWAYS LOST 
BUT IT IT'S ALSO FOR PEOPLE THEY WANT TO LEARN IT FAST NOT UH THEY WANT IT 
NO 
IT'S YEAH IT'S EASY TO LEARN WI AND UH 
UM 
AND 
THE 
IF 
UM 
IF UM 
ANOTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT UH WE ARE LOOKING AT THE MARKET FOR THE AGE UH YOUNGER THAN FORTY 
UM IN MY REPORT I DIDN'T UH SH I DIDN'T SHOW IT IN MY UH PRESENTATION BECAUSE MY COMPUTER CRASHED 
UM THEY WANT TO PAY FOR AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND SPEECH RECOGNITION 
SO 
I YEAH 
YEAH AND 
YEAH 
UH BUT 
IF IF THEY 
SO UH 
WE CAN 
WE CAN LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITIES FOR AN UH L. C. D. AND UH I DUNNO 
YEAH 
HOW MUCH IT WILL COST AND 
UM 
IT WILL COME UH 
YEAH 
DIFFERENT COLOURS MAYBE 
BUT ALL 
OKAY 
IF YOU'RE READING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM I THINK IT'S BETTER TO PUT IT UH AT THE TOP 
IT'S J 
OH 
BUT I IF YOU IF YOU ARE GOING TO UH PUT THE L. C. D. ON IT 
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO USE IT UH BECAUSE IT'S SO IT UH 
BUT IN THE FUNCTION OF IT 
SO YOU CAN USE IT MAXIMUM BECAUSE UH IT'S A LOT IT COSTS A LOT 
SO 
YEAH 
IT'S EXPENSIVE TO BUILD IT IS 
YOU MUST USE THE MAXIMUM OF IT 
HUH 
OH 
BUT UH 
YEAH I KNOW UH 
IN MIDDLE OF IT 
IN THE MIDDLE 
YEAH 
IT'S THE MOST IMPORT YEAH 
FINISH MEETING NOW 
IT'S IN YOUR COMPUTER 
OH 
OR 
AND UH WHAT ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION UH 
YEAH YEAH BUT OR OR AN L. C. D. OR IN UH SPEECH 
I THINK IT'S L. C. D. IS BETTER NOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH OKAY YEAH THAT'S YEAH THAT'S OKAY 
OH GOOD 
YEAH 
SOME 
HELLO 
SO ARE YOU DO WHAT WERE J YOU GUYS DISCUSSING 
OKAY 
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING NEW 
MM-HMM 
GREAT GREAT 
COME ON 
WHAT'S UH HERE 
AND THERE WE ARE 
WHAT THE F UH YEAH UH 
IT DOESN'T DO WHAT I WANT IT 
OKAY FINE THAT'S TOO BAD 
YEAH I HAVE TO START OR 
'KAY 
OKAY GO AGAIN 
WELL SECOND PHASE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
IT'S FINE EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
SO TAKE YOU PAST THE MINUTES OF LAST MEETING AGAIN 
AGAIN YOU GET YOUR THREE PRESENTATE TO SEE WHAT YOU CAME UP WITH 
SO TOO BAD WE DON'T HAVE ANY FINANCE INFORMATION APPARENTLY 
SO THAT'S TOO BAD 
SO THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE TO DO UH HAVE TO GO ON YOU KNOW 
THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE MAKE FINAL DECISIONS ON UH IN A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
SO 
HERE WE GO 
ANYWAY LAST W LAST W WHAT DISCUSSED LAST TIME YOU ALL REMEMBER THAT THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP THE ELECTRONICS SIZE IN MIND 
SOME GOES FOR YOU 
WE HAVE TO HAVE AN EASY DESIGN WITH BIG BUTTONS WHICH ARE DURABLE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY SPEN WILLING TO SPEND MONEY TO DO TO GET MORE FEATURES AND UH AMONG THOSE FEATURES L. C. D. SCREEN AND VOICE RECOGNITION ARE VERY POPULAR 
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE A MOVE ON THAT ARE I GUESS 
SO ESPECIALLY S WHEN WHEN THE NEW UH COMPONENT IS APPLICABLE IN OUR UH PRODUCT WE'LL BE FINE 
ANYWAYS WELL TELETEXT WASN'T IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHAT I TAKE 
AND THE CONSUMER YEAH WE AIM FOR YOUNG CONSUMERS SO THAT'S FINE 
AND WELL ACTUALLY WE YEAH WE DID AND SOME MORE DATA ON FINANCES BUT W YEAH WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT APPARENTLY 
THAT'S TOO BAD 
YEAH WE NEED TO UM DO WE ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE BEEP AND THE FLASH THING TO RECOVER YOUR REMOTE 
SO ONE OF THESE INTERCHANGEABLE COVERS APPARENTLY WHICH WILL MAKE IT A MORE FASHIONABLE PRODUCT 
SO ANYWAY 
GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO DO THIS AFTER THE AFTER THE YOU GIVE YOUR PRESENTATIONS 
SO I'LL JUST CLOSE THIS ONE NOW AND LET'S UH LET'S SEE 
WE HAVE A LOT TO TELL 
YOU HAD A LOT TO GO ON 
SO UH HOW ABOUT YOU GO FIRST 
OKAY 
DOES IT PROVIDE ENOUGH ENERGY 
ALSO IF IF WE WERE CHOOSE THE THE L. C. D. OPTION WOULD TO GIVE ENOUGH ENERGY OKAY THAT'S THE JUST ASSUME IT TAKES 
WELL I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S SHAKEN ENOUGH BECAUSE 
NO I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE UH WATCHES CAN GO ON KINETIC ENERGY BECAUSE THEY MOVE ALL THE TIME 
BUT I'M SURE IT I MEAN REMOTES LIE STILL I THINK LIKE NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME 
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE WERE SOLAR CELLS 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPLICABLE BECAUSE 
I THIN WHY WHY SHOULDN'T WE TAKE A BASIC BATTERY 
WHY NOT 
I MEAN EVERYBODY EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW IT IS THAT 
IT'S IT'S COMMON 
SO AND IT'S AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE 
SO WHY SH MM I THINK BETTER 
YEAH BUT IT'S 
YEAH UH IT WASN'T IT WASN'T IN THE OPTIONS A RECHARGEABLE M MODULE ACTUALLY 
OKAY YEAH B YOU C OF COURSE YOU COULD PLACE RE RE CHARGEABLE BATTERIES 
BUT THAT'S UP TO THE CONSUMER HIMSELF 
SO 
WELL MM IT'S NOT IN THE LAST 
SO WE CANNOT CHOOSE FROM IT 
SO 
OKAY WELL JUST TAKE REGULAR BATTERIES 
OKAY WE'LL GET BACK IN THAT LATER 
JUST 
BUT WHAT WERE THE IMPLICATIONS IF YOU IF PUT MORE CURVES IT IT'S GETS MORE EXPENSIVE 
OKAY SO I THINK WITH WITH THE EXTRAS THAT WE HAD THERE IT'S TWO CURVES I SUPPOSE 
OKAY 
ALSO DECREASES OKAY 
OKAY 
MORE THAN ONE CURVE UH YEAH OKAY 
WE'LL JUST GO UH 
'CAUSE IT YEAH I'M NOT SURE 
WE'LL DISCUSS THAT LATER 
OKAY WE HAVE SO I THINK WE CAN RULE OUT UM I'M NOT SURE WE CAN RULE ANYTHING TO 
WE'LL DO THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET YOUR DESIGN 
NO WOOD I WOOD'S NOT AN OPTION 
WELL IT IT'S STYLISH BUT WE CAN YEAH BUT YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR COVERS ANYWAY 
YEAH SO TO KEEP IN MIND THAT IT IT'S IT'S UH TO FEEL UH REMOTE CONTROLS FALL A LOT ON THE GROUND 
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO TO BREAK 
SO THERE HAVE RUBBER EDGES ARE A RUBBER REMOTE CONTROL IS VERY DURABLE 
BUT CONTINUE 
DON'T HAVE TO BE UN BREAKABLE IT'S UP IT'S A IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO J YEAH BREAK AFTER ONE IS 
I MEAN IT THEY THEY FALL A LOT 
SO 
WELL YOU HAVE FOR IF YOU F FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU TAKE HARD PLASTIC 
IF IT FALLS IT MIGHT CRACK 
AND RUBBER UH KIND OF SOFTENS THE FULL 
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S THE IT'S THE ENTIRE COVER YOU CHANGE 
UH IT'S COULD BE 
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WE'RE FOCUSING VERY MUCH ON THE COVERS NOW 
I THINK IT'S JUST WE NOW WE'RE GOING FOR THE BASIC DESIGN 
IF WE WANNA EXPAND OUR OPTIONS F BE FASHIONABLE THEN WE CAN GET CHANGEABLE COVERS 
BUT I THINK THE BASIC THING LET'S JUST RULE OUT WOOD FOR NOW AND CONTINUE 
WE'RE DEFINITELY FOCUSSING ON THE YOUNGER PEOPLE 'CAUSE THAT WAS OUR MAIN GOAL 
OKAY OKAY WE WILL 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
EVIDENT 
YEAH O OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA USE 
BUT I DIDN'T I DIDN'T GO ON THE THOUGHT OF A SCROLL WHEEL ACTUALLY 
I'M STILL DECIDING ON WHAT WHAT WHAT COULD YOU USE IT FOR 
MAYBE FOR VOLUME CONTROL 
CHANNEL I THINK THAT WOULD BE ANNOYING BECAUSE IT MIGHT ACCIDENTALLY SCROLL INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL 
I THINK A PUSH BUTTON FOR CHANNEL WOULD BE BETTER 
I MEAN IT FOR VOLUME CONTROL IT'S IT'S A SMOOTHER MOTION YOU CAN JUST INCREASE OR DECREASE 
BUT NOT SURE 
FOR CHANNELS WILL BE GOOD 
I DON'T THINK SO 
I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T TAKEN IT INTO CONSIDERATION 
I DON'T THINK WE REALLY NEED ONE 
BUT WHY DO WE NEED TO 
IF WE DON'T NEED TO 
WHY PUT IT IN YOUR WHY PUT IT IN YOUR IN YOUR IF IT'S IF IT'S NOT SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR OR IS USEFUL 
ARE THEY 
YEAH BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S NOT USEFUL I DON'T THINK IT I DON'T THINK IT GIVES AN EXTRA FUNCTION TO THE REMOTE 
ANYWAY 
WHAT YOU WHAT WHAT'D YOU GET IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
SO TOO EXPENSIVE 
DOES IT 
AND HOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE SO THAT 
OR 
NO ABSOLUTE NUMBERS BUT IT'S JUST MORE EXPENSIVE AND TAKES MORE ROOM I SUPPOSE IN YOUR IN YOUR DESIGN 
DON'T THINK IT'S AN ISSUE OKAY 
UH LET'S GO FOR LET'S SAY BECAUSE IT IS UH VERY HOT IN IN OUR TARGET GROUP I THINK 
WE SHOULD TAKE TO TAKE IT TO TO CONSIDERATION TO BUILD AN L. C. D. SCREEN ON IT 
OKAY 
WHICH BASICALLY HAS THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY BUT LACKS THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
OKAY 
WE'LL PICK A WE'LL PICK FROM UH WE'LL JUST COMBINE EVERYTHING LATER 
MM-HMM 
ONCE AGAIN I WAS WOULD ASK YOU IF IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT APPARENTLY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY DATA 
SO 
WELL WHAT DO WHAT WAS EXACT WHAT YOU GET IN THE ON THE NEW COMPONENT 
THAT'S SMALL 
SO WE CAN IMPLEMENT IT 
SO WHY WHY IF IT'S SMALL AND WE CAN IMP WHY SHOULDN'T WE 
AND THERE'S UM GET YOUR MAR MARKETING REPORT 
WHAT WAS UH THE LAST NUMBER OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED IN VOICE RECOGNITION 
ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD FOR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF COURSE 
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROGRAMME IT YOURSELF I SUPPOSE WITH YOUR OWN VOICE 
MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION 
IF IT'S SMALL IF IT'S FITS IF IF PEOPLE LIKE IT WHY NOT 
SO 
YEAH BUT WE GOT SOME DATA ON PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY ARE NOT ARE INTERESTED IN THAT AND I DON'T THINK A SCROLL WHEEL OFFERS NEW FUNCTIONALITY 
WHEREAS SPEECH RECOGNITION AND L. C. D. SCREEN DO OFFER NEW FUNCTIONALITY IN YOUR PRODUCT 
UH I THINK SO BECAUSE IF I THINK WE'RE SPECIALLY W IF YOU'RE GOING MAYBE UH IF YOU HAVE THE TWO EDITIONS YOU WANNA WANNA GIVE IT 
PROBABLY YOU HAVE ONE WITH UH WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION AND 
UM 
YEAH HOLD ON A MINUTE 
WERE WERE YOU WE'RE FINISHED 
OR 
OH 
BECAUSE IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT 
'CAUSE HAVE DID YOU HAVE ALL THE MATERIALS 
OR EVERYTHING THAT YOU DESC 
OKAY SO UH JUST JUST GO FOR DESIGN FOR NOW 
JUST UM HAVE A SET FOR A SECOND 
OH 
WE'LL COMBINE EVERYTHING AFTER THIS 
WHY IS IT IS WHY IS IT SQUARED 
WHY DID YOU PICK SQUARE 
OR UH NOT SQUARE BUT WHY IS IT YEAH SHARP CORNERS 
LOOKS LIKE A STAR TREK PHASER 
IT'S TRUE 
YEAH 
OR OKAY SO JUST YEAH YOU CAN REST IT IN YOUR FINGER 
OKAY 
MM-HMM 
NO IT JUST UH IT'S A CURVE INSIDE A THING 
SO 
IT'S IN THE BACK 
YEAH I THINK IT'S OKAY 
KEYS ARE PROBABLY THE ON THE NUMBER KEYS I SUPPOSE 
OKAY 
WELL YOU CAN WORK ON THE ACTUAL CONCEPT OR ACTUAL DESIGN LATER WITH HIM 
BUT 
WELL I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT UM YOU'RE MOVING THE THE THE NUMBER KEYS FROM THE TOP 
UH IN THE THE SIMPLE DESIGN YOU HAVE THEM OUT A TOP AND THE UH COMPLEX DESIGN YOU HAVE THEM AT THE BOTTOM 
SO IT WOULD THAT WOULD GIVE US A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DESIGN 
SO WHICH ACTUALLY MAKING A WHOLE DIFFERENT PRODUCT INSTEAD OF TWO DIFFERENT MODELS 
I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE TWO WHOLE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS 
SO 
YEAH UH OR FOR EXAMPLE WHY DID YOU PICK THE MM THE NUMBERS UH ALL THE WAY BELOW AND THE AND THE CHANNELS AND VOLUME CONTROL 
OKAY 
THAT'S FINE 
THAT'S FINE 
JUST AS LONG AS YOU TAKE TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT PEOPLE WOULD PREFER 
OH OKAY IF YOU ALL AGREE I'M FINE WITH IT 
BUT 
OKAY 
YEAH I THINK WE'LL 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TOWARDS THE DELUXE EDITION ANYWAY BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT 
BUT LET'S SEE WHAT'S WHAT THEY WANT NOW 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S MINE 
NO YOU SHOULD SEND IT AT THE F TO THE FOLDER FIRST 
OKAY UM LET'S JUST ASSUME WE GO TO FORTY ONE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
I THINK SO 
OKAY 
OKAY SO WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING FOR RUBBER 
LET'S JUST GO 
UH-HUH 
NAH I THINK WE'RE IN THIS CASE YOU'RE LOSING THE THE FOCUS ON THE YOUNG GROUP BECAUSE WE'RE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSSING ON 
SO I THINK THE SPONGY FEEL GIVES US RUBBER 
YEAH WE TH APPARENTLY 
YEAH APPARENTLY YEAH MAYBE ALSO YEAH I TEND TO DISAGREE WITH WITH UH WITH A SHARP FORM 
I SUPPOSE IT BASI IF YOU'RE UH SAYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES MAYBE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A LITTLE LITTLE MORE ROUND 
YEAH FOR EXA MAYBE LIKE UH LIKE A PEAR OR SOMETHING 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING 
MM 
I THINK SHAPE IS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY S THEY REALLY EXTEND 
YEAH BUT NOW YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR LIKE YOUR STAR TREK PHASER THING SHAPED CONTROL 
SO I I TH THE EDGES ARE REALLY REALLY SHARP 
I'M UH NOT SO 
OR MAYBE JUST MAKE IT MAKE IT UP INTO INTO A LOW A SMOOTH CURVE INSTEAD OF JUST LESS SHARP TWIST ON THE OUTSIDE 
I THINK I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE I THINK IT'S TOO TOO SHARP 
THE EDGES ARE TOO SHARP 
THE BOTTOM IS FINE OF COURSE IF IT'S SQUARE 
BUT MAYBE JUST THE MAKE UH THE TOP A LITTLE AROUND IT OFF IN THE SIDES 
SO I MEAN YOU 
THAT WOULD BE TWO CURVES 
ONE CUR YOU COULD ALSO MAKE THE CURVE GO THROUGH OF COURSE 
BUT THAT WOULD MAKE MAKE THE TOP ROUND 
BUT LET'S SEE TITANIUM WOULD GIVE US ONLY ONE CURVE 
SO BUT WE'RE NOT D WE'RE NOT USING TITANIUM 
RIGHT WE DID 
SO 
JUST DOODLE SOMETHING ON THE BOARD ON THE LEFT 
WELL ACTUALLY WE'RE SETTING OURSELVES APART FROM BY TECHNOLOGY ALONE ACTUALLY 
SO THAT LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
OH OKAY 
I DON'T THINK LIKE THAT 
NOT NOT REALLY THE CURVES IN THE ON THE SIDE OF THE REMOTE 
OKAY NOW I UH OF COURSE NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAVE MORE UH LIKE UM 
WHY THE CURVES 
UM DECREASE THE THE UM THE SIZE THE ELECTRONICS THAT CAN BE INSIDE 
SO OKAY 
I DON'T THINK THE OUTSIDE WOULD BE CALLED AS A CURVE REALLY 
I THINK IT'S FOR ALL THE BASIC WELL LOOKING FROM THE SIDE ANYWAY 
WELL IF YOU SEE WHAT I HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME DESIGNS FAST ANYWAY 
SO 
OKAY 
WELL YOU SHOULDN'T FOCUS ON THE MOSTLY ON THE COVERS BECAUSE LOT OF THINGS WE COME UP WITH 
SHOULDN'T BE IT REALLY TOO MUCH SHOULDN'T BE TOO FOCUSSED ON THE COVERS BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF AN IDEA OF OUR OWN 
BUT WE'RE NOT SURE IF WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THAT 
THAT'S THE ONE THING I'M ALSO AFRAID OF WITH THIS ONE BECAUSE AT THE EDGES ARE REALLY UM THEY MIGHT STICK IT IN THE ON THE SIDE FOR EXAMPLE 
IF YOU HAVE A BASIC DESIGN A LITTLE UM A LITTLE SMALLER ON THE ON THE S IN THE EDGES 
YOU COULD PUT MORE COVERS ON IT YOU IN IN WITH SQUARE OR UM SHARP CORNERS IF YOU WANT IT 
SO UM JUST AROUND IT OFF A LITTLE I GUESS BECAUSE SO WE HAVE MORE OPTIONS I SUPPOSE 
I THINK SO BECAUSE IT LOOKS LEANER AND WE SHOULD JUST GO WITH THAT 
ANYWAY YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO MAKE IT MAKE THE FINAL DESIGN IN A MINUTE WITH HIM 
SO SO WE DECIDED ON WHAT WHAT DID YOU GUYS WANNA KNOW AGAIN BECAUSE THIS IS UM ANYWAY I'LL FIRE UP MY THING 
SO SO WE CAME OUT A DECISION 
UH WHAT THE 
OH 
YEAH 
OKAY ANYWAY 
UH ENERGY WE CHOOSE REGULAR REGULAR BATTERIES 
THE CHIP IS ADVANCED BECAUSE WE HAVE THE ADVANCED FEATURES 
THE CASE IT WILL BE THE MATERIAL WILL BE RUBBER SUPPOSE 
WOULDN'T THE B THE DESIGN WE TALKED ABOUT 
UH USER INTERFACE TYPE 
WELL I THINK WE TAKE ALL THE COMPONENTS SEPARATELY WHAT WE WANT 
UM LET'S SEE UM SUPPLEMENTS 
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT 
ANYWAY UM APPARENTLY YOU GUYS YOU SHOULD WORK TOGETHER ON THE FINAL DESIGN BOTH AN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DESIGN 
SO 
YEAH YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD PROBABLY FIND OUT HOW THE PRODUCT WILL FALL INTO THE MARKET 
HOW UH WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH THE FINAL DESIGN SO WE HAVE TO NOW 
SO YEAH OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT YOUR SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION AS USUAL 
SO WANNA SPEND SOME MORE UM I THINK WE'RE IN A PRETTY MUCH IN AGREEMENT ACTUALLY WHICH IS GOOD 
SO 
LEF LET'S SEE WHERE THE PEN GO 
HERE 
YEAH UH OPEN YOUR THING AGAIN 
LET'S SEE WHAT IF YOU CAN COME UP WITH ANYTHING NEW 
UM I'LL JUST DO A NEXT ONE 
SO WHAT WOULD GIVE US YOUR IN YOUR DESIGN WOULD BE THE LIGHTS WOULD BE ON TOP RIGHT 
UH IN IN EACH ONE ON EACH SIDE 
SO IT IS TO THE LIGHTS FOR FOR FINDING THE FINDING REMOTE OR LIGHTS THAT IT THAT 
YEAH I THINK THAT SHOULD JUST BE A SIMPLE LED OR SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT OF COURSE 
IT JUST LIKE A MATTER OF A A BEEP IF YOU PRE THAT YOU JUST KNOW THAT THAT THERE'S CONTEXT 
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S SUPER IMPORTANT 
BUT 
HMM 
OH SH OH 
LET'S SEE I'LL JUST MAKE 
ONE LIGHT HERE 
AND JUST MAKE IT RED NOW 
BUT IT COULD BE ANY COLOUR 
SO 
OKAY WHATEVER 
FINE ANYWAY 
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE 
UM I'LL MAKE IT UM ARE WE GONNA USE SQUARE BUTTONS OR ROUND ONES ACTUALLY 
PERSONALLY I WOULD PREFER ROUND ONES 
YEAH FOR 
OKAY 
OKAY I ASSUME IT FOR SO WE TAKE A R TAKE A ROUND POWER BUTTON RIGHT HERE 
WHATEVER 
UH BACK TO BLACK 
UH NOT TOO BIG THOUGH 
SO THIS WOULD BE GOOD 
UM LET'S SEE 
OR THIS FOR ANY EXTRA CONTROLS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
IF WE GO FOR FOR ROUND BUTTONS IN GENERAL DO WE WANT TO THE MENU KEY IN THE MIDDLE TO BE AROUND 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LET'S SEE PUT IT THIS HERE 
I THINK WE'LL GO WITH THE TRIANGLES THAT COME ON 
TRIANGLES ARE GOOD 
YEAH THEY'RE A LITTLE TOO BIG NOW 
BUT 
ANYWAY OKAY 
SO DO YOU WANT FOR EXAMPLE A 
ROUND BUTTON ON THE MIDDLE OR SQUARE ONE 
I'M NOT SURE UH I JUST JUST CAME UP WITH IT 
THIS ALIGNS NICELY 
SO 
OKAY 
WE'LL JUST TAKE THE TAKE THE ROUND BUTTON SUPPOSE 
UH UH THE SQUARE BUTTON SORRY 
I SUPPOSE SO 
OKAY 
SO THERE'S OUR NUMBERS 
THINK WE NEED AN EXTRA BUTTON HERE OF COURSE FOR YEAH LIKE YOU HAD FOR THE 
HIGHER NUMBERS 
AND YOU COULD INCLUDE A BUTTON HERE FOR THE MUTE I SUPPOSE 
FOR SOMETHING ELSE JUST TO 
MIRROR MIRROR THE EFFECT WITH THIS 
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE IT YOU CAN TAKE THIS WAY BUT THERE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A HOLE THERE JUST TO MIRROR THE EFFECT 
OKAY SO WE HAVE A FEW 
NAH I THINK IT IT WOULD BE NICE TO PUT THE LOGO HERE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE SOME BUTTONS HERE 
WE COULD PUT A LOGO HERE BECAUSE IT'S VERY ALWAYS ON YOUR FIELD OF VISION 
IF YOU'RE WATCHING AT THE L. C. D. SCREEN BLAH BLAH 
WELL WE COULD WE COULD INCLUDE EITHER HERE 
OR HERE FOR EXAMPLE 
BUT YOU THINK HERE ARE HERE 
I KNOW 
NO WE COULD PUT THIS ONE IS FAVOURITE CHANNEL FOR EXAM 
WHAT ARE THESE FOUR 
OKAY 
WHAT 
YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO ELEVEN 
MY UH OKAY HAVE TO YOUR WAY 
I MEAN THINK THIS LOOKS RATHER LIKE LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING FOR EXAMPLE 
I MEAN WHY WOULDN'T YOU INCLUDE A 'CAUSE THERE IS A UM A PIECE OF ELECTRONICS UNDER THERE ANYWAY 
SO WHY NOT GIVE IT A FUNCTION 
LET'S SAY I MEAN COULD BE ANYTHING 
BUT THE 
NO I DON'T THINK BECAUSE THIS IS A ZERO 
BUT YOU WANT ZERO TO BE MIS ALIGNED WITH THE REST 
ANYWAY SO THIS IS THE BASIC DESIGN WE WANNA HAVE UM ONE AND OFF WHAT ARE WE MISSING 
IF IT LOOKS UM 
OKAY SO WE WANT THE REMOTE TO BE THE USE THE SIDE VIEW ACTUALLY WHAT I'M GONNA DRAW 
SO 
UM 
PROBABLY THANK YOU WANT THE CURVE TO BE HERE 
SO HAVE YOUR FINGER UNDER HERE LIKE THIS I SUPPOSE 
OKAY 
JUST GONNA BE SH 
YEAH 
WANT THIS STRAIGHT OR WHAT 
LET'S KEEP IT AT THIS 
SO IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS 
DO WE WANT SOMETHING INTERESTING WITH IT OR SO 
WOULD GIVE US A LIGHT HERE 
MAYBE IT'S BORING 
YOU WANT IT CURVED OR WHAT 
MAYBE YOU WANT 
SHOULD LIKE THIS 
WILL GIVE US DESIGN PROBLEM BECAUSE WE HAVE 
IT CAN BE CURVED 
OKAY 
I THINK SO 
THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU 
OKAY 
SO 
OH CRAP 
YEAH 
OH 
ANYWAY SO YOU WANT TO A LITTLE MORE LIKE THIS 
AND JUST SO SO 
STOP THE CURVE HERE OR CONTINUE IT 
SO WE HAVE OUR L. C. D. SCREEN 
LET'S SEE 
NO 
BANA IT'S BANANA VISION 
SO YOU HAVE YOUR L. C. D. SCREEN RIGHT HERE SUPPOSE 
UM THAT WOULD MAKE 
WE USE THE COLOURS NOW 
BUT 
UM 
YOU GOT SPONSOR NOW YOU GOT A FOR ONE WITH EVERY PACK OF CHIQUITA 
SO IT WOULD GIVE THE BUTTONS HERE 
I SUPPOSE I SUPPOSE WE CAN PUT UM LET'S SEE 
UM 
UH I SUPPOSE WE CAN PUT THE BATTERIES IN HERE BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST SPACE FOR EXAMPLE 
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST PART OF THE UH OF THE UH 
LET'S 
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE 
I THINK IT'S THE BEST PLACE YEAH YOU COULD ALSO PUT 'EM HERE 
BUT 
OKAY SO WE PUT THE BATTERIES HERE 
THAT'S FINE 
YEP 
BLAH 
UM ANY OTHER COM WHAT WHAT ARE WE MISSING HERE 
SOMETHING A SPEECH RECOGNITION 
UM 
WHERE DO WE WANT THE MICROPHONE FOR EXAMPLE TO BE 
IN THE SIDE OR IN THE OR FOR EXAMPLE ON TOP 
LIKE HERE 
TO BE 
OKAY I WE THOUGHT MAYBE IT'S EITHER BE HERE OR BECAUSE IT'S UM IT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THE TRANSMITTER I'M NOT SURE 
BUT 
'CAUSE TRANSMITTER WOULD BE HERE 
WHY UH ONCE AGAIN LIKE YOU SAID THE COMPONENT CAN BE SOMEWHERE AT THE BOTTOM WHILE WE WERE THE MICROPHONE UP THERE 
ANYWAY 
UM YEAH IT COULD BE THERE BE HERE OR MAKE A DOUBLE MICROPHONE 
I WOULDN'T MIND 
IT'S ABLE TO TALK TO YOU 
A SPEAKER SENSOR 
I THINK SO IT I THINK IT COULD 
YEAH 
I MEAN IT COULD BE A ALL THIS STUFF COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO THE L. C. D. SCREEN WHICH YOU COULD NAVIGATE WITH THIS I SUPPOSE 
NAVIGATE THROUGH EVERYTHING 
IF YOU HAVE I THINK YOU SH I THINK THE ADVANCED OPTIONS SHOULD BE I THINK IT SH THE ADVANCED OPTION COULD ALSO BE INTEGRATED IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
OF COURSE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A BUTTON FOR EVERYTHING 
YOU CAN JUST NAVIGATE THROUGH THE UM YOUR MENU THAT YOU HAVE HERE FOR ADVANCED OPTIONS WITH THIS 
THINK THAT WOULD BE FINE 
SO THAT'S W UM WOULD BE MAKING USE OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
MM 
BEEP 
UM SO THE FLASHING OF THE BEEP WE HAVE WELL ANYTHING 
WE COULD YEAH BUT YOU COULD PUT A SPEAKER OR SOMETHING IN IN THE SIDE FOR EXAMPLE 
FOR HOW DO YOU DRAW THAT AGAIN 
UH WHATEVER LOOKS STUPID 
I THINK THIS IS PRETTY 
I THINK YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE BECAUSE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO FIVE MINUTES TO FINISH THE MEETING 
OH 
LIKE MY THE INFO THAT I GOT WAS THAT YOU'RE UH WE'RE GONNA WORK ON OUR OWN BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA DO THE MARKET MARKET UH ANALYSING I'M SUPPOSED TO DO THE LITTLE WORK ON THE YEAR END REPORT 
SO THE PROJECT REPORT 
HMM 
OKAY I THINK WE'RE EVERYBODY SATISFIED WITH THE WITH THE CURRENT DESIGN WE HAVE 
SO WE'RE IS SUPPOSED TO BE RUBBER 
I THINK WELL I THINK THE THE REMOTE CONTROL IS GONNA BE BLACK BECAUSE WE WE FORGOT TO TALK ABOUT I MEAN THE THE COMPANY COLOURS ARE IMPORTANT APPARENTLY 
SO WE HAVE THE LOGO UP THERE 
SO ARE WE GONNA BASE COLOUR IS BLACK 
AND YEAH OF COURSE WE COULD USE YELLOW BUTTONS ARE YELLOW NAVIGATION OR WHATEVER 
YELLOW BUT YELLOW CONTROL 
IT'S 
OKAY 
WELL DON'T DON'T STICK YOURSELF ON THE COVERS RIGHT NOW 
BUT DON'T STICK YOURSELF ON THE COVER BECAUSE 
NAH 
YEAH BUT THE INFO 
I THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH UH WITH THE COMPANY COLOUR BECAUSE WHAT SPECIFIC INFO THAT I GOT FROM THE PROJECT BOARD 
SO I THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH THAT 
THEY WANT SOMETHING TRENDY 
I THINK WE SHOULD TH THEN TAKE TO TAKE YELLOW 
TAKE WHAT YOU C YELLOW REMOTE CONTROL 
SO LET'S SEE IF IF WE CAN DO THE OLD INTO IT 
UH UH 
YOU KNOW WHAT 
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS 
THAT'S UP TO YOU GUYS 
YOU DOODLE A DOODLE US A NICE NICE DESIGN FOR FOR THE NEXT MEETING WE'LL BE DONE 
I THINK WE'RE ALL HAPPY NOW 
YEAH 
STUPID SCROLL WHEEL 
'KAY 
I'M NOT SURE UH I REALLY I'M NO I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT WE COULD USE THE SCROLL WHEEL FOR 
IT TAKES SPACE A LOT OF SPACE 
AND IT COULD 
I'M NOT SURE IF IT IF IT HAS NO FUNCTION WHY EVEN PUT IT THERE 
AND TH THAT'S JUST AS MUCH THINGS THAT MAKE IT LOOK FLASH 
I THINK CHANNEL SELECTION WOULD BE ANNOYING BECAUSE IT JUST C YOU COULD SCROLL PAST THE CHANNEL OR 
ONE OR ONE SCROLL WHEEL 
OKAY 
UM I DON'T SEE ANYTHING MISSING REALLY 
YEAH WE SHOULD TOO BAD WE DON'T HAVE THE FINANCE 
WE COULD'VE 
YEAH 
IT'S I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE GONNA GET FINANCE ANYWAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE C I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE AN ISSUE AT THE FIRST TIME WE STARTED 
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE A COST ISSUE WHICH MATERIAL WE WERE GONNA TAKE RELATIVE TO THE ADVANCED CHIPS OR ANYTHING 
SO YOU JUST DO WHATEVER YOU LOOK AND HE DOESN'T CARE WHAT IT COSTS 
I THINK WE'RE RUBBER IS NOT EXPENSIVE 
DEFINITELY 
YOU CAN MAKE RUBBER IN ANY COLOUR 
IN ANY COLOUR 
SO I MEAN YOU CAN'T MAKE YELLOW TITANIUM BUT YOU CAN MAKE YELLOW RUBBER 
OH YEAH WE CAN MAKE UH FOR EXAMPLE IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU CAN CLICK ON IT LIKE UH THAT'S BUT IT'S NOT SOM NOT APPARENTLY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING WITH IN THE BASIC DESIGN 
YEAH IT COULD BE 
IT CAN BE DONE FOR E 
DID YOU MANAGE 
OKAY 
OH 
HELLO 
NO JUST UH ASK IF IF HE COULD MANAGE 
I HAVE A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION 
HEY EVERYTHING ALRIGHT 
DID YOU MANAGE 
OKAY 
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION 
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION 
THAT'S TRUE 
HUH 
ALRIGHT 
I HAVE A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION 
I HAVE A COMPLETE LIST OF UH EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN USE ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT ALL AV AVAILABLE 
I HAVE NO I STILL DON'T HAVE ANY FINANCE INFORMATION ABOUT AT LEAST WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO GO ON NOW 
YEP THAT'S RIGHT 
LET'S SEE WHERE MY 
PRESENTATION SO 
OKAY UM THIS I MENTIONED BEFORE 
EVERY FEATURE FOR OUR REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS TO HAVE THEIR OWN OPERATING ELECTRONIC DEVICES 
WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THAT 
THEN WARNING UH THERE HAS TO BE A CHIP ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL 
AND THE CHIP REQUIREMENTS UH NEEDED FOR A NORMAL BUTTON UH IS JUST A SIMPLE CHIP UH SCROLL WHEEL AND L. C. D. IS AN ADVANCED 
OF COURSE THIS IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THIS 
SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THAT IN A MINUTE 
THE AVAILABLE UH COMPONENTS FOR ENERGY ARE WE HAVE A BASIC BATTERY A HAND ON UH DYNAMO LIKE AN UH OLD TORCHES 
WE HAVE A KIN UH KINETIC PROVISION THEN YOU HAVE TO SHAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO GET THE ENERGY 
AND WE HAVE SOLAR CELLS 
I SUGGEST THAT WE UH DECIDE ON THAT ONE UH IMMEDIATELY 
THEN I HAVE ALL LISTS 
SO 
MY PERSONAL UH FAV FAVOURITE IS THE KINETIC PROVISION BECAUSE UH I UH 
I THINK SO YES 
YES 
YES 
BECAUSE I HAD THE INFORMATION UH YOU TAKE UH THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU PICK IT UP AT LEAST TWO TIMES A DAY 
SO THEN IT'S ALREADY SHAKEN AND GIVES ENERGY 
OR 
THINK 
HMM 
HMM 
OTHER OPTIONS OR SOLAR CELLS HAND DYNAMO AND BASIC BATTERY 
ONLY BASIC BATTERY 
OKAY BUT I THINK THIS IS NOT A R 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT I THINK THIS RULES OUT OR NOT OUR RECHARGEABLE UNIT 
THIS IS REALLY A REALLY BASIC BATTERY A NORMAL BATTERY 
HUH 
OKAY THAT'S UH 
OKAY 
OKAY BUT THEN WE DON'T OFFER A RE CHARGEMENT FUNCTION 
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS 
EXACTLY 
ALRIGHT 
RIGHT 
YEP 
NEXT ONE IS CURVING 
UH WE CAN MAKE A MODEL THAT HAS ONE CURVE TWO OR THREE 
AND UH UH THE UH THE SHAPE 
OF COURSE UH THE MORE CURVES THE MORE EXPENSIVE 
EXACTLY 
YES 
HMM 
HMM 
I THINK ONE CURVE IS UH FINE 
MORE EXPENSIVE 
MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE 
EXACTLY 
AND I BELIEVE EVEN THAT THE OR THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS WE HAVE AN PUTTING THINGS ON IT UH GOES DOWN WITH EXACTLY 
MATERIAL 
I HAVE TO OFFER A PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD OR TITANIUM 
UH IF WE CHOOSE PLASTIC WE CANNOT CHOOSE SOLAR CELLS FOR ENERGY 
IF WE CHOOSE TITANIUM UH WE CANNOT USE MORE THAN ONE CURVE 
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT AS FAST 
MM 
MM 
OKAY 
BUT I THINK WOOD IS NOT AN OPTION THERE 
OKAY 
HMM 
OKAY 
MY PERSONAL THOUGHT WAS UH RUBBER BECAUSE I HAD AN EMAIL I BELIEVE IT WAS FROM YOU UH F AGAINST FALLING 
HMM 
OKAY 
OH 
MM 
YEAH 
MM 
I THINK WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THIS ANYWAY 
UH BECAUSE IF WE MAKE REMOVEABLE COVERS IT HAS TO BE ONE OF THOSE MAT MATERIALS 
WE HAVE ONE MORE THAN THIS 
SO 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
ALRIGHT 
THEN I PROCEED BUT I NEED TO KNOW AFTER THIS MEETING 
SO INTERFACE UH I HAVE FOUR THINGS TO OFFER PU UH NORMAL PUSH BUTTONS OF COURSE 
UM UH WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE ON THAT ONE 
WE HAVE A LARGE HISTORY OUR COMPANY IN PUSH BUTTONS 
SCROLL WHEELS UH THIS CAN BE PUSHED AS WELL ALTHOUGH THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE 
UM LIQUID CRYSTAL COLOUR DISPLAY AND UM 
WHAT IS THIS 
OKAY AND IF WE USE RUBBER I ALREADY MENTIONED THAT WE CAN ONLY USE RUBBER BUTTONS 
SO RUBBER CAN ONLY MATCH WITH RUBBER 
WHICH ONE OF THESE ARE WE GONNA USE 
PUSH BUTTONS THAT'S B UH I THINK BASIC 
HUH 
NO 
I THINK THE CHANNELS 
YEAH 
HUH 
HUH 
HMM 
BUT 
HUH 
OH 
UH SO BUT IT LOOKS COOL 
MM NO 
OH 
OH 
FLASHY AND YEAH 
I THINK WOULD BE COOL SCROLL WHEEL 
IT'S NOT THAT MUCH UH IF WE TAKE A NORMAL SCROLL WHEEL WITHOUT THE PUSHING THEN IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE 
WE CAN DO THAT 
THINK 
UH WE DON'T NEED TO BUT IT'S UH IT'S DESIGN A DESIGN THING 
I THINK THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THAT 
OF COURSE WE HAVE UH A YOUNG TARGET GROUP 
SO THEY MIGHT FIND THAT ATTRACTIVE IN A REMOTE CON 
OKAY 
SO PUSH BUTTONS WE WILL SEE 
UH L. C. D. SCREEN 
SO THAT IS 
UH I ONLY KNOW THAT IF WE ARE USING THAT WE NEED AN UH AN ADVANCED CHIP ON IT 
AND THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE 
I HAVE AN IDEA 
I HAVE AN ABSOLUTE NUMBERS 
I ONLY HAVE 
YEAH BUT I DON'T THINK ROOM IS REALLY AN ISSUE 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
ELECTRONICS UH THE FIRST ONE IS THE CHIP 
OH THAT'S NO LONGER AN OPTION IT HAS TO BE AN ADVANCED ONE NOW 
'CAUSE WE HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
THEN WE HAVE AN INFRARED SENDER I THINK THAT'S BASIC WE CANNOT DO WITHOUT 
OTHERWISE IT'S NOT AS A REMOTE CONTROL 
AND WE HAVE THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SPEAKER THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING 
ARE WE GONNA DO THAT ARE NOT 
I ONLY HAVE UH UH RELATIVE INFORMATION 
UH HOW DID YOU 
THAT GOES ALSO FOR THE SCROLL WHEEL BY THE WAY 
HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
BUT DON'T WE HAVE ANY W UH INFORMATION ABOUT SCROLL WHEEL 
SCROLL WHEEL 
IF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THAT 
THAT'S STRANGE BECAUSE THAT'S THE SAME STORY 
IT'S IT'S NOT NECESSARY LIKE AN L. C. D. BUT IT'S JUST IT ADDS SOMETHING TO THE DESIGN 
HMM 
NO 
OH THAT'S OUR 
BUT I THINK UH WE NOW ALREADY HAVE TO UH IMPLEMENT UH AN ADVANCED CHIP 
SO IT'S UM 
NO BUT THAT'S THAT'S OKAY 
THERE IS STILL TIME 
YES THIS WAS UH THE LAST M. S. 
I HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE 
HMM 
HMM I AGREE 
HMM 
NO 
YEAH UH I AGREE 
OKAY AGREEMENT 
MM-HMM 
THAT'S TRUE 
HMM 
HMM 
OH THAT'S TRUE 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
BUT I THINK ACCORDING TO MY INFORMATION THIS WOULD BE TWO CURVES 
WE HAVE ONE LEFT AND ONE RIGHT AND THAT DISABLES WHAT WAS IT AGAIN 
IT'S SAME IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT DO THEN 
OKAY THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
THAT'S ONLY FOR THE TITANIUM 
WE DON'T HAVE 
YES 
THEN WE YEAH BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT 
SO WE HAVE 
WE HAVE NO 
BUT THEY UH 
THEY TH THOSE WHO ARE WHAT THEY CALL THE CURVES 
THIS SIDE THIS SIDE THIS IS HOW THEY COUNT 
NO NO 
THIS IS WHAT THEY UH WHAT THEY MEAN 
OKAY THAT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD 
IT'S LIKE THIS 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
YEP 
SO I CAN UH QUI OH 
I CAN QUICKLY MAKE A CONCLUSION 
OF WHAT WE HAVE DECIDED AS FAR 
HMM 
HMM 
UM IT 
HMM 
HMM 
I WOULD PREFER ROUND 
BUT DOESN'T MATTER DOESN'T MATTER 
THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL THINK 
HMM 
HMM 
HUH 
IT CAN BE CURVED 
YES 
I WOULD CURVE THE WHOLE ACTUALLY 
I WOULD CURVE THE WHOLE 
LIKE UM LIKE IT HANGS OVER YOUR HAND A LITTLE BIT 
THEN IT WILL BOUNCE AND YOU DON'T DROP IT IS EASILY 
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT YES 
YES EXACTLY 
I THINK CONTINUE LIKE THAT 
THEN THERE'S ALSO ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE ELECTRONICS 
YEAH 
LET'S MAKE IT YELLOW THEN 
OH 
MAYBE ONCE WE CAN MAKE A SPECIAL EDITION IN ACCORDING WITH CHIQUITA 
HAVE OURSELVES SPONSORED 
UH BUT IT'S A GOOD TRADE OFF FOR THEM IF THEY CAN HAVE THEIR LOGO ON IT 
MM-HMM 
THEY MIGHT WANNA BE THE FIRST ONES TO UH 
UH PERHAPS THEY CAN USE IT 
OR GIVE A SPECIAL EDITION UH WITH WITH 
MM 
I THINK THIS IS POSSIBLE 
HUH 
IT DOESN'T MATTER 
YOU CAN ACTUALLY UH PLACE A CHIP FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND AT THE BOTTOM AND AND WERE TO 
DOESN'T MATTER 
I THINK ON TOP 
MM-HMM 
IT SO I BELIEVE ALSO ABLE TO TALK 
I HAVE A SIMPLE UH SAMPLE SENSOR AND THE SPEAKER SENSOR 
UH THE SPEAKER SENSOR WE ALREADY HAVE BUT SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY EXACTLY MEAN BY A SAMPLE SENSOR 
COULD TO TALK BACK 
LIKE UH G UH GIVE CONFIRMATION OR SOMETHING 
I THINK IT CAN 
I THINK IF YOU HAVE A A SPEECH RECOGNITION COMPONENT THEN A S SPEAKING COMPONENT IS NOT THAT HARD TO TO PUT IN THERE 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
BUT 
MM-HMM 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
MM 
HMM 
WE ALREADY HAVE A SOUND COMPONENT BY THE WAY FOR THE BEEP 
SO BEEP 
HMM 
I'M NOT SURE 
I SHOULD BE GETTING NEW INFORMATION I GUESS 
YES 
BUT WE HAVE 
ANY COMPANY LOGO 
WE HAVE YES BUT AND YELLOW 
I WOULD CHANGE 
I WOULD TAKE A YELLOW REMOTE CONTROL 
TO HAVE TOO FLASHY TO HAVE IT IT'S FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
AND DO BE DIFFERENT 
HMM 
BUT WE NEED TO BE DIFFERENT 
MM-HMM 
HUH 
IT'S EITHER BLACK COVER WITH YELLOW BUTTONS OR VICE VERSA 
AND I WOULD SAY TAKE A YELLOW COVER AND BLACK BUTTONS 
TO BE DIFFERENT 
YEAH WE HAVE SO MANY COLOURS ALREADY 
SO 
UH IN THAT I THINK IT'S GOOD THING TO BE DIFFERENT THEN 
WELL 
MM-HMM 
I STILL DON'T HAVE MY SCROLL WHEEL THOUGH 
OH THAT'S NAH THAT'S TRUE 
NO FORGET IT 
NO LIKE IT 
NO THAT'S NOT MY POINT 
IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S FUNCTIONAL BUT IT'S JUST TO ADD TO THE DESIGN TO HAVE TOO FLASHY 
IT IT HAS NO FUNCTION I AGREE 
I AGREE 
UH SO MANY THINGS HAVE NO FUNCTION JUST DESIGN 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
LET'S VOTE ON IT 
THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT ANY LONGER 
WHAT DO YOU WANT 
ONE OR IT 
OKAY 
YOU ARE OUT OF COURSE 
YOU ARE OKAY COLOUR 
I HAVE ALL MY ANSWERS YES 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
THERE IS I HAVE ONE QUESTION 
HMM 
HMM 
I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION WITH THE MATERIAL BUT I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION THAT 
WE'VE CHOSEN RUBBER 
NO BUT CAN WE MAKE YELLOW RUBBER 
I THINK SO 
OKAY 
OKAY 
HMM 
WELL I HAD JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TIME SO I HOPE IT'S SOMETHING UH WE CAN WORK WITH 
BUT 
HMM 
WELL I HEARD THAT THERE WAS A NEW UH COMPONENT SPEECH RECOGNITION COMPONENT 
WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH UP TO STANDARD SO WE MIGHT SEE THAT I PUT THAT IN MY DRAWING BUT AGAIN I DIDN'T NOT HAVE THAT MUCH TIME 
SO 
OKAY THAT'S JUST SUPER 
LET ME JUST 
OH 
YOU NEED TO START IT UP FIRST 
OKAY 
OKAY WHAT IT 
OKAY YEAH 
SO THAT ENOUGH 
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY IS PEOPLE SHAKING THEIR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE USING IT 
NO 
AND WHAT DOES THE HAND DYNAMO OH SORRY 
OH 
CURVES BEING 
OF THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF OKAY 
I WAS THINKING ALONG THE LINE OF ONE CURVE 
I'LL SHOW THAT IN MY DESIGN 
SO WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT 
OKAY I T I'D GO FOR PLASTIC BECAUSE I HAVE A COUPLE OF CURVES IN MY DESIGN 
WELL G LET'S JUST GET BACK TO THAT 
NO WOOD'S NOT AN OPTION 
NO 
YEAH BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE UNBREAKABLE BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO KEEP SELLING THIS THING 
OKAY WELL THAT THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE 
BECAUSE IT WILL OR WILL RUBBER ACTUALLY PROTECT THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF 
BECAUSE IT 
YEAH BUT THEN YOU BUY A NEW COVER 
BUT RUBBER 
OKAY 
YEAH OF COUR 
YEAH BUT THERE IS A IS IT REALLY NECESSARY 'CAUSE A NORMAL PUSH BUTTON CAN DO THAT JOB 
YEAH BUT WHY WOULD WE USE IT 
PERHAPS 
I HAVE TO I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT 
OKAY 
I HAVE TWO DESIGNS ONE INCLUDING UH AN L. C. D. SCREEN WH WHICH IS BASICALLY THE DELUXE EDITION 
AND THEN I ALSO HAVE A STANDARD EDITION WHICH WE WE CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO DEVELOP IT 
EXACTLY 
BUT WE'LL 
YEP 
BASICALLY IT 
UH I GOT 
I GOT AN EMAIL THAT IT'S RELATIVELY SMALL 
YES LET ME JUST 
GET BACK 
WELL THEY BE THEY BASICALLY CAN HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
I MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE L. C. D. UH ASPECT 
'CAUSE YOU WANTED TO USE THEM RIGHT 
SO THIS IS BASICALLY THE DELUXE EDITION 
I J 
WHY IS IT SQUARE 
IT 'CAUSE IT'S DESIGNY 
IT'S BASICALLY IT HAS SOME FUTURISTIC 
POTENTIALLY YEAH 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW 
BUT I JUST THOUGHT THAT UH IN NORMAL REMOTE CONTROLS YOU HAVE LIKE SMOOTH CURVES AND THIS AND THAT 
AND THIS IS SOMETHING NEW THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT SOMETHING FRESH 
AND BASICALLY WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT IT HAS A LITTLE YEAH LET'S SAY GAP WHICH YOU CAN PUT YOUR FINGER IN 
SO YOU CAN YOU CAN HOLD IT REALLY COMFORTABLE THAT'S BASICALLY THE IDEA 
OR LEFT HAND 
I DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
SO YOU CAN USE THIS IS THE REMOTE CONTROL 
UH YOU CAN'T REALLY IS IT THAT WELL BUT THIS IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
SO JUST IMAGINE IT GOES THAT WAY 
THEN YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN HOLD IT IN YOUR LEFT OR IN YOUR RIGHT HAND 
AND I ALSO MADE A QUICK IMAGE 'CAUSE I DID NOT HAVE THAT MUCH TIME 
OF THE STANDARD EDITION 
WHICH HAS BASICALLY THE KEYS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME 
YEAH 
I HAD TO DO THIS REALLY FAST 
SO EXCUSE ME FOR THE UH INCONVENIENCE HERE BUT AS YOU CAN USE THE KEYS MOVED 
YEAH 
SO THESE ARE BASICALLY THE TWO TYPES WE HAVE 
SO IF WE WERE TO SELECT THE L. C. D. SCREEN THE TRANSMITTER HERE YOU CAN USE THE LIGHT I 
WELL WE CAN SHIFT THAT 
BUT NORMALLY AS YOU CAN SEE THERE WE PUT THE UH NUMBER BUTTONS RIGHT ON TOP 
WHEREAS BECAUSE WE HAD THE L. C. D. SCREEN HERE WE HAD TO MOVE THEM DOWNWARD SO WHAT YOU COULD SAY IS THAT 
BECAUSE THESE ARE BASICALLY THE FUNCTIONS YOU USE THE MOST 
SO IF YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND LIKE THIS YOU PUT YOUR FINGER IN THE GAP THIS IS THE M MOST EASY PART 
BUT 
FOR ZAPPING CAU BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ZAPPING MOST OF THE TIME 
OKAY 
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH UH WHICH I HAD IN MIND 
SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THIS CAN BE SPACED FOR EXTRA KEYS WHICH IS THE DESIGN THINGYS 
YEAH 
SPEECH RECOGNITION 
THEN RUBBER WOULD BE THE BEST IS A MATERIAL INDEED 
IF THAT IS THE UH 
IT COULD BE A C IT COULD BE A COVER 
BUT IT'S NOT 
OR FOCUS IS THE YOUNG AUDIENCE 
SO LET'S STICK TO THAT 
YEAH BUT THAT'S JUST MORE A AS A SEASONAL A TREND THING 
THE IDEA NOW IS IS IS THAT YOU CAN UH PUT A COVER ON IT FOR EXAMPLE WITH FRUIT LIKE A SHAPE OR WHATEVER 
BUT NOT 'CAUSE A N NEXT YEAR IT WILL IT'LL BE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR APPLE SHAPED REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS NOT TRENDY ANYMORE 
SO I THINK THAT'S MORE SOMETHING YOU CAN FOCUS 
WELL YOU CAN SEE 
WHAT YOU CAN DO IS SMOOTH THE EDGES INDEED 
BUT THAT WILL BRING EXTRA C EXPENSES 
WELL WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT LIKE ONE CURVE HERE 
FOR THE GAP 
AND WE COULD HAVE AN HOUR 
NO NO NO NO NO 
WHAT I'M JUST 'CAUSE YOU MENTIONED THAT MORE CURVES THE MORE EXPENSIVE SO I'M JUST TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT 
WELL WE PICKED RUBBER RIGHT 
SO BASICALLY WHAT WE CAN DO IS M MAKE THESE EDGES A LITTLE BIT LESS SHARP 
BUT THE PROBLEM THEN IS THAT IT WILL START TO RESEMBLE M THE REMOTE CONTROLS AS WE HAVE THEM TODAY 
WE WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING FRESH SOMETHING TRENDY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO THAT'S BASICALLY SILLY 
BUT ISN'T THE OF THE FRUIT LIKE A COVER THING BECAUSE WE 
NO BUT 
BUT IF WE PUT THAT DIRECTLY INTO THE DESIGN WE LIMIT OURSELVES EXTREMELY 
BECAUSE IT THAT'S JUST FOR ONE SEASONAL TREND 
OKAY SO THAT'S WELL THAT'S PROBABL 
YOU'D JUST LIKE TO TO GO A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE THIS 
OKAY 
DID YOU PRESENT E EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO 
OKAY 
UH WE STILL NEED TO DECIDE ON A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU YOU NEEDED TO KNOW 
ARE WE ALL IN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE WELL THE PRIMARY STRUCTURE OF THE OF MY DESIGN 
EXCEPT FOR THE EDGES 
LIKE THE KEYS THERE 
YEAH 
TO CREATE A KIND OF DISCO EFFECT WHEN YOU 
THAT WAS BASICALLY WHAT WE 
LIGHT FOR THE FINDING OF THE REMOTE 
WE CAN ALSO IS ONE LIGHT FOR 
SHOWING THAT THE SIGNAL IS BEING SENT 
BUT 
SO WE HAVE THE TELETEXT WE HAVE HERE WE HAVE THE MUTE 
L. C. D. SCREEN 
THIS IS THE ON OFF BUTTON 
SPEECH RECOGNITION I WHERE DID I IMAGINE 
I DID THAT PRETTY MUCH OVER HERE IS THAT YOU COULD USE IT LIKE THIS 
AND SPEAK TO IT 
THEN YOU HAVE THE UH EXTRA KEYS FOR TELETEXT MUTE TWO BUTTONS WHICH CAN BE PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING OR NOTHING 
WE CAN ALSO JUST NOT USE THEM 
MAIN CONTROLS AND A KEY PAD 
WILL BE FINE 
YEAH BUT THAT WOULD THIS WAS JUST IN THE DESIGN 
BECAUSE IF YOU I HAD A SQUARE DESIGN 
SO I HAD SQUARE BUTTONS 
BUT IN THAT CASE THE ROUND BUTTONS WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE 
YEAH 
THE LEFT ONE IS TELETEXT AND THE RIGHT ONE IS MUTE 
AND THESE TWO BUTTONS ARE ARE NOT NECESSARY OR 
YEAH THE TRIANGLES WOULD BE BEST INDEED 
I PERSONALLY THINK THAT A ROUND B BUTTON LOOKS BIT SILLY BUT 
DOES EVERYBODY AGREE ON THAT 
YOU PREFER A ROUND 
OKAY 
YEAH YOU CAN 
BUT IT BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY BECAU 
WE COULD PUT OUR LOGO THERE 
UH THAT COULD BE THAT BE 
WELL NOW IT'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT TOO CROWDED UP THERE 
SO IS YOUR 
SO IT CAN BASICALLY BE THE BUTTON DOWN BELOW OR ONE OF THE FOUR BUTTONS UP THERE 
BECAUSE 
ONE OF THE FOUR IS BETTER I SUPPOSE 
BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING TO HAVE TWELVE BUTTONS DOWN THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY ACCUSTOMED TO ELEVEN I'D SAY 
UH WE STILL NEED AN OKAY BUTTON 
WELL YOU COULD ALSO SHIFT THE TWO BUTTONS TO BE NICELY ALIGNED 
UH WE'RE PRETTY MUCH MISSING AN OKAY BUTTON BUT WE HAVE A BUTTON UP THERE WHICH IS STILL FOUR 
SO 
YEAH PRETTY MUCH 
WELL I THINK IT LOOKS BETTER CURVED 
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY UH 
IT CAN BE CURVED BECAUSE THAT YEAH IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE TRENDY TO BE CURVED 
HMM 
BUT IT PRETTY MUCH LOOKS LIKE A BANANA ALREADY 
OH 
IT'S FRUIT 
YEAH 
ARE THEY CAN DESIGN THEIR OWN COVER 
WE COULD SET UP A A MARKETING UH AGREEMENT 
WON'T THAT BE A PROBLEM WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN 
YEAH BUT THE L. C. D. SCREEN PROBABLY NEEDS QUITE THE CHIP 
OKAY 
OKAY THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
OKAY 
I THINK WE GET THE IDEA 
UH BASICALLY THE IDEA THAT I HAD WAS IT TO BE PRETTY MUCH IN COMBINATION WITH THE TRANSMITTER 
'CAUSE YOU CAN TALK TO TO LIKE THIS 
WELL THE EMAIL SAID IT WAS A QUITE A SMALL COMPONENT 
SO I DON'T SEE THAT 
IT'S A 
WELL THE 
YEAH BUT DO YOU ACTUALLY NEED THE REMOTE TALKING BACK 
BEEP 
AT THE BACK YEAH 
LIKE THAT 
OR AT THE SIDE 
WHICH IS 
SO WHAT'S BASICALLY EDI THE EDITI IDEA SORRY NOW 
WE NEED TO STAY HERE AND WORK OUT THAT 
WELL I SUPPOSE WE'LL 
PRETTY MUCH 
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU USE COVERS IT BASICALLY EASIER TO HAVE A N HAVE A NEUTRAL COLOUR ON THE BASE 
NO WE'RE DESIGNING THE REMOTE CONTROL NOW BUT TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A NEUTRAL BASE COLOUR THAN TO HAVE A FLASHY 
IT IS MORE TRENDY 
THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE 
UH WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PUT IT 
UH YOU COULD USE IT FOR THE CHANNELS AND FOR THE VOLUME 
BUT IT'S HAS NO REAL ADDED VALUE 
YEAH BUT IF IT HAS NO FUNCTION THEN 
BASICALLY IT 
I DON'T USE THE 
DO YOU HAVE ALL YOUR ANSWERS 
OKAY 
YES YOU CAN COLOUR RUBBER YEAH 
YEAH SH NOT QUITE 
YOU WILL SEE UH 
WOAH 
YEAH 
MM UH NOTHING SPECIAL 
OH 
YEAH THE FOR UH THE TRENDY UH STUFF 
A LITTLE BIT 
I UH NEW WILL SHOW IT 
OKAY 
YEAH I HAD THE SAME 
IT JUST UH 
SHUTS ITSELF DOWN AND 
OH 
YEP 
MM UH-HUH 
I BUT 
OH OKAY 
UM 
YEAH 
A RECHARGEABLE MAYBE 
OR RECHARGEABLE BASI 
YEAH 
YEP 
BASIC 
OKAY 
OKAY 
BUT 
BUT 
AT IDIAP 
BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
DEPENDS ON THE USER 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO 
NO 
OR ARE WE FOCUSSI FOCUSSING ON ON THE 
BUT 
BUT 
NOT THAT BUT ARE WE FOCUSSING ON THE UH YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE THE OLDER PEOPLE 
YOUNGER OKAY 
YEAH THAT'S OKAY 
NAH THAT'S 
BUT 
BUT THE THE YOUNGER PEOPLE MY INVESTIGATION TURNS OUT THAT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WANT A LITTLE BIT UH MATERIAL THAT THAT IS UH SPONGY AND UH 
SO 
A SEC 
YEAH 
YEAH YOU GET 
NO 
SCROLL WHEEL 
UH I DON'T KNOW 
YEAH THAT'S IT 
YEAH 
FOR THE FUTURE 
YEAH 
YEP 
YEP 
UM UH 
THE MOST OF THEM UM 
UM UH MORE THAN UH SIXTY PERCENT 
YEAH 
MEAN IF UH SEVENTY PERCENT I THINK 
UH I'M I HAVE TO LOOK AT UP 
NO 
NO ONLY 
OH 
I DON'T KNOW 
IN THE MOST SPEE 
BUT 
YEAH FOR THE FUTURE 
YEAH 
PEOPLE 
OR 
SO ONLY R RIGHT HANDED 
BUT IT BUT IT'S ONLY RIGHT HANDED THEN 
NOT FOR THE LEFT 
OR 
WHERE 
UH IN THE BACK OKAY 
OH YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
OH YEAH YEAH 
OKAY 
YEAH 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
I THOUGHT IT 
WELL IT IT'S YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
NO IT MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO LIKE UH WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT 
SO I CAN UH SHOW MY UH INVESTIGATION 
YEAH MAYBE IT'S BETTER 
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
UM WHERE IS THAT 
WHERE IS THE 
OH 
OH 
YEAH 
MM I FORGOT THAT 
OKAY NOW IT MUST BE THERE 
YEAH HERE TO USE 
OH YEAH 
OKAY UH THE INVESTIGATION TURNS OUT THAT THE MOST APPEAR UH PEOPLE WANT ME UM UH LOOK AND FEEL LIKES IS UH UH THE USE THE SAME AS BEFORE 
BUT IT MUST BE W A LITTLE BIT FANCIER THAN UH THE THE LIKE IF IT 
UM THE SECOND IMPORTANT THING IS UM THE IT MUST BE UH TECHNOL TECHNOLOGICAL UH INNOVA VATIVE 
SO THAT'S THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS PERFECT I THINK AND NOT UH 
YEAH THA THAT'S UH VERY IMPORTANT 
AND A THIRD THING IS 
UM YEAH IT'S UH SHOULD BE EASY TO USE IS NOT NOT TOO MUCH BU BUTTONS AND UH CHANNEL SELECTION 
I THINK THAT'S UH WHAT YOU SHOWED US UH PERFECT 
AND WHAT THE PE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT IS UH IN PARIS AND AND IN MILAN UH IT SHOWED OUT THAT THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE UH ARE TRENDY 
TH THEY YOU SEE YOU USE IT IN THE CLOTHES AND EVERYTHING 
AND UM THE CONTRAST UH IF IT IT MUST UH THE THE BUTTONS MUST A LITTLE BIT SPONGY MATERIAL 
SO UH RUBBER I THINK UH TH THAT'S THE BEST 
NO 
SO WE ARE UH WE WERE FOCUSSING UH IN THE YOUNGER PEOPLE 
SO THE ELDER YEAH THEY WANTED A LITTLE BIT OF WOOD ON IT AND UH THAT'S UH TH THAT'S NOT UH IMPORTANT NOW 
YEAH 
YEAH BUT 
YEAH 
'CAUSE UH NO I I I I THOUGHT UH IT MAKES A YOUNG UH CLASSIC REMOTE WITH UH 
YEAH THAT'S WHY I I D UH 
DECIDED 
WITH A FRUIT UH 
COVER OV OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
OH 
YEAH IN IN FORM OF AN UH VEGETABLE OR IN UH FRUIT MAYBE 
AND 
UH WHERE IS YOUR 
A TRENDY 
HERE HE HERE YOU CAN PUT A 
UH MAYBE IT 
BUT 
YEAH 
ALL UH VEG UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE AROUND 
SO IT'S BETTER 
YEAH 
TWO 
BUT IT 
BUT IT'S THAT THAT'S FOR THE COMFORT 
IT'S IT'S NOT FOR THE TRENDY THING IF IT 
YEAH 
OKAY YEAH 
SO THE ONE 
WE UM 
FROM 
YEAH 
BUT YOU CAN MAKE UH IF YOU WANT TO USE A FRUIT ON UH IN UH 
OH 
HEY YOU 
YOU CAN MAKE IT LIKE 
LIKE THIS 
WELL 
OH 
IS A EXAMPLE 
BUT 
I D 
HMM 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
AND SPEECH W RECOGNITION 
ARE WE 
WE 
LITTLE UH VOICE UH 
RECORD AND A UH NO 
YEAH 
FORM OF FRUIT 
IT'S BETTER 
YEAH 
YEP 
AND WHAT ABOUT UH 
WHAT ABOUT A BUTTON FOR YOUR UH FAVOURITE CHANNEL 
OH YEAH 
WITH THE EXTRA CONTROLS 
OH 
OH NO NO SET 
YEAH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT UP UH 
ONE OF THE FOUR 
UH IT'S BETTER THAN I THINK 
IT'S A FAVOURITE CHANNEL 
WHAT 
NO UH ONE OF THE FOR UH 
IT'S BETTER TH 
YEAH 
HMM 
MM 
WHY 
YEAH 
UH-HUH 
YEP 
YEAH 
PERFECT 
YEAH IT'S PERFECT 
YEAH 
OKAY 
TOP 
IN THERE 
NO 
MM-HMM 
BEEP 
OH 
YEP 
OKAY 
OH THAT'S FINE 
ROUND 
WOAH 
WHY 
IT'S THE COLOUR OF A 
BUT THE EYE 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT UH A TRENDY UH REMOTE CONTROL 
SO COLOURFUL UH SO 
YEAH 
YOU HAVE THE BASIC COLOURS BLUE GREEN RED 
UH IT'S OKAY 
YEAH 
COLOURFUL YOU YOU 
YEP 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OH YEAH 
YOU CAN 
OH MY 
BUT UH UH SCROLL FOR A CHANNEL S SELECTION OR VOLUME 
UM 
OH OKAY 
OH OKAY 
IT 
I HAVE TO CALL THIS IN A FORM 
OH 
BUT WE UH WE WE DON'T UH IS OUR RECO UH WE UH REMOVABLE COVER 
NO HUH 
MAYBE MAYBE LATER MAYBE WE CAN UH 
CAN I CLOSE THIS 
OH OKAY 
THERE WE GO 
OKAY HERE WE ARE AGAIN 
DETAILED DESIGN UH COME ON 
WELL UH S FORGOT TO INSERT THE MINUTES BUT IT'S ABOUT THE SAME THING WE DISCUSSED BEFORE 
OH 
COULD OPEN THAT ANYWAY THINK 
OTHER DESIGN ANYWAY WE TOOK AS WE TOOK W WE TOOK RUBBER IS IS THE MATERIAL LAST TIME 
WE ALSO THAT YOU'RE JUST BUSY WITH IT 
TAKE THE ADVANCED CHIP TO TO UH IMPLEMENT THE ADVANCED FEATURES 
WELL WE DISCUSSED THE DESIGN NO SHARP CORNERS WE ROUNDED IT OFF LIKE YOU SEE IN THE OTHER SCREEN WHICH IS FINE 
UM WE AGREED THAT THE COLOUR SHOULD BE B UH YELLOW AND BLACK 
YELLOW IN THE BACK BECAUSE IT'S M TRENDY MORE TRENDY THAN BLACK ANYWAY 
SO THEN WE C YEAH 
WE AGREED THAT WE WOULD IMPLEMENT BOTH THE L. C. D. AND SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT I'LL GET OUT THAT IN A MOMENT 
'CAUSE SOME CHANGES IN THE FINANCES HAVE 
LEFT US IMPLICATIONS ANYWAY 
SO SO LIKE I SAID WE HAD NO INSIGHT IN FINANCES NO PRICES BUT WE HAVE 'EM NOW 
AND IT'S BAD 
ANYWAY 
WE ARE 
OH 
PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION WILL FIRST YOU GUYS BUILT THE PROTOTYPE 
SO YOU COULD COULD PRESENT THAT 
BUT UM LET'S SEE WHAT BE HANDY TO DO 
NO NO YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND PRESENT THE W WE'LL SCRAP IT LATER BECAUSE 
WHAT 
OH THAT'S 
HASN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH HUH 
I DIDN'T EXPECT ANYWAY 
YOU JUST COLOURED IT 
MM-HMM 
I LIKE THE MENU 
MM-HMM 
AND I SUPPOSE THE THE THE YELLOW IS NOT PRINTED ON THE ON THE RUBBER 
IT'S IT'S PART OF THE RUBBER I SUPPOSE 
I THINK THAT'S MORE I THINK THAT'S MORE DURABLE ANYWAY THAN PRINTED ON IT 
OH YEAH 
MM-HMM 
OKAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
NOW IT'S MY TIME TO RUIN EVERYTHING 
WELL NOT RUIN EVERYTHING BUT NO NAH 
FINANCES THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE WHAT YOU DRAW 
WE HAVE BATTERY POWER WE HAVE ADVANCED CHIPS AND THE SAME THE SENSOR 
THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND UH FOR SPEAK RECOGNITION ANYWAY 
SO WHICH YOU USE THE WHICH IS DE O ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PARTS 
AS WELL WE HAVE SEEN ONE CURVE A DESIGN 
RUBBER DESIGN 
AND WE HAD A SPECIAL COLOUR 
SUPPOSE YELLOW IS A SPECIAL COLOUR 
SO JUST HALF A OR FOR YOU HAVE PUSHBUTTONS AND AN L. C. D. DISPLAY 
YOU HAVE THE TITLE OF SEVENTEEN EUROS IN PRODUCTION COST WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE TWELVE AND A HALF THAT WE ARE PERMITTED TO USE 
SO EASY 
WHAT DO WE SCRAP 
WELL THINK I HAD THE BEST SOLUTION THAT I CAME UP WITH IS JUST TO USE TAKE OUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
BECAUSE THE L. C. D. HAS MORE SUPPORT ON CUSTOMER SIDE 
THERE ARE NINETY ONE PERCENT OF UH THE PEOPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT NINETY PERCENT WHO FAVOUR AN L. C. D. DISPLAY AND ONLY SIXTY PERCENT THAT FAVOUR SPEECH RECOGNITION 
I THINK IT'S ALSO HARDER TO 
SO I JU I TAKE THAT IT 
SO AND SO IT'S STILL STUCK WITH THIRTEEN SO I HAD TO TAKE OUT THE SPECIAL COLOUR I SUPPOSE 
AND YEAH I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE I COULD TAKE IT 
YEAH I COULD TAKE OUT THE PUSH BUTTONS BUT WE NEED THIS 
SO GENERALLY WHAT I CAME UP WITH IN ORDER TO BE C IT TO HAVE PRODUCTION COST OF TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS 
SPE SCRAP SPEECH RECOGNITION AND THE SEPARATE COVERS CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE OF PEOPLE WANT TO WE'LL JUST THEN WE'LL DO IT IN BLACK 
WE'LL JUST DELIVER IT IN BLACK HAVE THE IT HAS ALL THE FUNCTION THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE 
AND IF YOU WANT TO IF YOU WANT THE CUSTOM DESIGN THEN YOU CAN BUY THE SEPARATE COVERS 
YOU MAKE IT D ORANGE OR WHATEVER YOU WANT 
IT WAS A BIG ISSUE BUT 
I'LL JUST GO BACK 
UH LET'S JUST LET'S SEE WHAT OKAY LET'S JUST SEE WHAT WE N WE WE HAVE TO BE UNDER TWELVE AND A HALF 
IT IT'S NOT UH THE PROJECT IS A ONE G IF WE GO OVER TWELVE AND A HALF SO 
I THINK YOU THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE ASS ASSIGNED TO DO REALLY TO TO SEE HOW B THE BOTH THESE WORK TOGETHER 
SO I THINK YEAH IT'S I THINK IT'S YOU ONE OF THE IT'S A GOOD WAY TO ME 
TO HELP PEOPLE UH TO MAKE IT KEEP THE PRODUCT TRENDY TOO 
JUST KEEP YOU JUST MAKE NEW COVERS FOR THE FOR IT LIKE WE AGREED BEFORE 
AND EVERYTHING THAT'S LEFT IS IS THE BASIC FUNCTION THAT UH THAT WE WANT OUR PRODUCT TO HAVE 
BECAUSE THE EXPENSIVE PARTS ARE IN THERE THE ADVANCED CHIP 
BUT WE NEED THAT FOR THE L. C. D. DISPLAY 
THEN AGAIN WE HAVE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY WHICH IS ALSO EXPENSIVE 
B YEAH BUT THIS GO TOGETHER 
AND YEAH WE COULD TAKE OUT THE CURVE 
COULD WE COULD TAKE OUT THE CURVE 
SO THAT ONE OPTION 
FOR YOU 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S IT IT DOES RUIN IT BUT THE FACT THAT I IT TOOK THAT DECISION OR IT 
TAKE THIS EXAMPLE ACTUALLY NOT REALLY DECISION ABOUT THE EXAMPLE IS BECAUSE WE DO OFFER THE UM THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDING YOUR OWN CUSTOM COVERS 
SO YOU CAN CHANGE ANY COLOUR YOU WANT 
SO IT'S JUST YOU DELIVER A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL WITH A POSSIBILITY TO CHANGE YOU INTO WHATEVER YOU WANT 
YOU CAN TAKE PLASTIC 
BUT I D IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S STUCK INTO MY MIND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT REALLY CAME FORWARD FROM THE MARKETING RESEARCH IS THAT PEOPLE LIKE THE THE THE THE SQUISHY FEELING OF THE SPONGY FEELING OF THE AND IT REALLY MAKES IT ALSO MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM THE EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS 
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL PLASTIC 
SO WHICH ONE IN TURN RUBBER WOULD INCREASE DURABILITY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T BREAK 
I LI LIKE I SAID I LOST THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND I LOST THE SPECIAL COLOUR WHICH WOULD MAKE THIS BLACK A BLACK AND GREY 
YEAH THAT'S THAT THAT THAT'S ENOUGH BECAUSE 
I GUESS THOSE ARE THE BASIC COLOURS 
SO UH 
I THINK THESE ARE BASIC COL 
THEY WANT IT 
TO ENSURE THE PROFIT 
THAT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ORDER 
WE'RE JUST UH WE'RE THE PROJECT TEAM AND WE GOT OUR OUR ORDERS FROM THE PRO FROM THE BASIS OF OUR COMPANY WHICH SAY WE DON'T WANNA SPEND MORE THAN TWELVE FIFTY FOR THIS 
BUT THAT'S NOT FOR OUR THAT'S NOT OUR DECISION TO TAKE 
WE HAVE A BUDGET OF TWELVE FIFTY PER PRODUCT 
SO 
STICK THAT 
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY BAD EITHER 
I MEAN IF WE WE HAVE THE THE BACKUP OF OR THE BACKUP DESIGN THING 
TO HAVE I THINK THEY WOULD DO 
TH I THINK THEY DO LIKE BECAUSE YOU W YOU WE AGREE UPON THAT TH THAT THE THE THE COVER THING WAS A NICE IDEA 
BECAUSE P YOU COULD HAVE ALL SORT OF DESIGNS WHILE TO THE SAME TIME JUST MANUFACTURING ONE PRODUCT 
NO BASIC PRODUCT WHICH YOU COULD TURN INTO ANY ANY TASTE YOU WANT 
SO I THINK IT'S THE BEST SOLUTION TO MAKE THOSE CU CUSTOM COVERS FOR THE DESIGN ASPECT AND KEEP THE FUNCTIONALITY BETWEEN OF WITHIN THE THE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE YOUR F UH YOUR BUDGET 
SO 
WELL I DON'T THINK YEAH 
SO IT WORTH US TO USE IT DOES IT MEAN ANYTHING TO THE CUSTOMER 
LIKE IT LIKE WE DON'T CARE WE DON'T CARE THAT YOU HAD TO 
TRUE BUT WE DID WE DIDN'T GET THAT 
SO I THINK IT'S IT SHOULD EITHER BE A PACK 
MAYBE WE SH THAT SHOULD BE SOLD ON ON THE S IN STORES WITH WITH A STANDARD COVER OR SOMETHING 
BUT 
THEY COULD BUT UH 
IT'S AN OPTION BUT YEAH IT'S TRUE 
SO ACTUALLY UH IT'S NOT THAT MUCH OF AN INCREASE BUT YEAH 
WE CANNOT CONTACT THEM 
IT'S JUST THE ORDER THAT WE GOT 
SO THAT'S WHAT WE GOTTA GO WITH 
SO IT'S EITHER ONE OF JUST JUST TO GET OUT OF JUST TO GET IT THROUGH FINAL IT'S EITHER TURNED INTO PLASTIC 
DROP THE SQUISHY FEEL MAKE IT MAKE IT MORE BREAKABLE UM OR TURN IT YELLOW 
SO 
IT'S UH SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON 
I SAY LOSE THE CURVE 
OH THAT'S TRUE WE COULD ALSO THE C YEAH I FORGOT THAT SORRY 
UH THE CURVE 
SO THAT'S JUST THIS ONE JUST DO THIS IS THE BANANA CURVE 
SO THIS WOULD THIS WOULD BE STRAIGHT 
NO UH IN THAT WOULD BE A CURVE INSIDE THE THING I GUESS 
ONE WOULD JU THEN IT WOULD JUST BE A STRAIGHT REMOTE 
JUST LIKE LIKE THAT 
WHICH WOULD YEAH TURN IT INTO SOMETHING FOR MORE ORDINARY 
WE COULD MAKE IT YELLOW THEN BUT 
YOU SECOND THAT YOU SECOND THAT WE ALSO THE CURVE 
OKAY YEAH 
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP THE CURVE TO SEPARATE IT FROM THE REST OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WORLD IS TO SPEAK 
SO WE KEEP THE CURVE 
SO THE ONLY ONLY SOLUTION IS THERE IT IS THE L YOU LOSE THE YELLOW OR LOSE THE RUBBER 
AND I'M IN FAVOUR OF KEEPING THE RUBBER BECAUSE IT HAS MORE MORE ADVANTAGES THAN THE COLOUR YELLOW HAS 
MM-HMM 
YEAH UM I GUESS PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR THAT 
SO I THINK WE CAN TAKE THAT OPTION AND JUST WITH UH WITH THE IDEA ON THE BACK OF OUR HEAD THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMISE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
SO I THINK THAT WOULD STILL MAKE IT A NICE PRODUCT 
OKAY WE'RE FINAL ON THAT 
SO IT'S TOO BAD WE CAN'T MAKE THE WHOLE SUPER THING 
BUT ANYWAYS WE'RE HERE 
UM YEAH 
THIS WE DISCUSSED JUST NOW 
THAT'S JUST NOW JUST WE COULD JUST DISCUSS HOW THE PROJECT WENT 
I MEAN WAS KIND OF 
I SORT OF EXPECTED THAT EVERYTHING WOULD TURN IT THIS WAY BUT BECAUSE YOU YEAH EVERYTHING CANNOT BE FOR FOR 
WE DIDN'T I THINK IT WAS TOO BAD WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL INFO THE LAST TIME 
BECAUSE THAT WAS I TH IT WAS REALLY ESSENTIAL REALLY TO UM BECAUSE WE SPENT UH UH ENTIRE STAGE DESIGNING A PRODUCT OF WHICH WE HAD AN IDEA WHAT IT WOULD COST 
SO WE JUST PUT SOMETHING I THINK IT'S REALLY NOR NOT IN STROKE WITH REALITY ACTUALLY 
SO 
YEAH 
YEAH I THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN 
MATERIALS WOULD BE OK AT LEAST THE LAST MEETING I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED HAD TO HAVE THAT 
SO I SUPPOSE 
YEAH LET'S SEE IF IT SELLS 
I MEAN I SUPPOSE THIS SELLS BECAUSE IT'S VERY VERY EXTENDED 
BUT 
I SUPPOSE IT SELLS BECAUSE IT'S GOOD 
I MEAN IT'S GOT EVERYTHING FOR THE FOR THE REASONABLE PRICE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GONNA COST ANYWAY 
OKAY 
HAVE BEEN MET OKAY 
YEAH 
THEY'RE STUCK UNDER MENU 
FOR THE MENU 
I THINK THESE ARE TOTALLY MET BECAUSE WE WE REALLY TAKE THEM FOR THE THEY HAVE THE FEEL THEY WANT THEY HAVE THE SIMPLICITY THEY WANT 
I THINK IT'S VERY UH VERY WELL MET 
EITHER TWO OR NO MAYBE 
I THINK WE TAKE THAT EVERYTHING THEY WANTED INTO CONSIDERATION 
SO IT COULD EITHER BE A TWO OR A ONE 
NO NEED A HALF 
JUST CREATE OUR OWN OPTION 
YEAH 
IT'S PERFECT 
EVEN FOR DEAF PEOPLE YEAH 
IT'S I DON'T THINK IT'S PERFECT BUT WE DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TO GET IT BACK 
BECAUSE IF IT'S STUCK IN YOU COUCH YOU CAN USE THE LIGHT 
MAYBE YOU CAN HEAR IT 
BUT I MEAN WE TRIED SO I THINK IT THAT'S THAT DESERVES A ONE 
DEFINITELY 
I'D IS ONE REMOTE CONTROL 
IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD UH-HUH 
I THINK BUT WE DIDN'T EVEN THERE WAS AN ISSUE IN MAKING A MANUAL ACTUALLY 
WE DIDN'T REALLY DISCUSS IT BUT 
I DON'T THINK IT TAKES ON IT REALLY DOES DOESN'T TAKE TIME TO LEARN I THINK 
WE TAKE IT SO IT'S S SAY WE HAVE AS LITTLE BUTTON EVERYTHING SPEAKS FOR ITSELF REALLY 
SO I THINK THAT'S YEAH WE DIDN'T IT'S EITHER TWO OR NO I GUESS 
MAYBE IT'S A TWO BECAUSE D UH THE L. C. D. IS A LITTLE AS A LITTLE NOW AND THERE IS THERE ARE SOME OPTION HIDDEN UNDER THE MENU BUTTON 
SO I MIGHT MAKE THIS A TWO INSTEAD OF A ONE I GUESS 
SO JUST MAKE THAT A TWO 
YOU CAN USE THE L. C. D. IN A GOOD WAY 
I THINK SO 
I THINK IT'S PERFECT THE W WHERE IT IS WHAT IT CAN DO IF IT USEFUL 
I THINK SO 
NO YOU I MEAN IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN THE SMALL SCREEN 
WHAT DOES IT DISPLAY 
WELL I THOUGHT IT WAS I THOUGHT IT WAS I THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE WANTED PREVIEWS ON THEIR I'M NOT SURE IF THAT EVEN POSSIBLE 
BUT 'CAUSE IT'S THIS REQUIRES A QUITE QUITE A BIT OF BAND WIDTH 
I DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE REALLY 
BUT 
TH THEY DIDN'T REALLY DEFINE ON WHAT SHOULD BE USED FOR 
BUT I THINK ONE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE T. V. GUIDES I THINK THAT'S THAT TH THAT YOU CAN TRANSMIT THROUGH IT AND EVERYTHING 
JUST FOR EXTRA INFORMATION ON YOUR PROGRAMMES 
BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE LIKE LIKE MENUS OR P HOW ABOUT PREFERENCES OF YOUR UH WITH CONFIGURING YOUR REMOTE CONTROL FOR FAVOURITE YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL FOR EXAMPLE 
HOW DO YOU CONFIGURE THAT 
SO THAT COULD BE DONE BY L. C. D. DISPLAY 
I THINK IT'S GOOD 
NO MAYBE IT'S NOT A ONE BECAUSE IT'S WE'RE NOT USING IT PERFECTLY 
WE DIDN'T GIVE IT I DON'T THING OVER DISCUSSING 
NOW WE GIVE IT ENOUGH THOUGHT THOUGH 
I THINK WE D SHOULD JUST LOWER THIS 
MAYBE MAYBE IT'S A THREE THOUGH 
WE COULD'VE USED IT MORE EFFECTIVELY PROBABLY 
YEAH WE ARE USING IT BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT POORLY USED BUT IT'S NOT EFFICIENTLY USED I THINK 
WE COULD HAVE EV EVEN LOST THE SELECTION BUTTON AND UH DONE EVERYTHING VIA L. C. D. SELECTION 
IT'S NOW IT'S JUST EXTRA TO ILLUSTRATE IM UH EXTRA FEATURES BUT OKAY 
CAN YOU TALK TO REMOTE CONTROL 
WELL IT CAN'T TALK ANYMORE 
SO WE SCRAP THAT 
OH YEAH JUST TO BE A PRICK BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING 
BUT YOU C YOU CAN TALK TO IT 
WELL WE DID TAKE EVERYTHING INTO CONSIDERATION OF COURSE 
UH THE SHAPE I SHAPE SO I 
I THINK WE YEAH I THINK THAT'S OKAY 
YEAH SPECIAL CO BUT WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT IT'S CUSTOMISABLE TO THE FISH 
WE DON'T HAVE TO WE DO HAVE IT IT'S JUST SOLD AS A PACKAGE 
IT DOES IT'S NOT PART OF THE BASIC PRODUCT 
IT THAT THAT'S WHAT I CALL TRENDY 
I MEAN THE SHAPE IS TRENDY 
THE THE SH THE THE FUNCTIONS ARE TRENDY 
IT'S JUST THE COLOURS THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTING THE BASIC MODEL 
BECAUSE YOU UH IT'S JUST NOT AFFORDABLE AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S POSSIBLE BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR THE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING IT IN A OF A DIFFERENT COLOUR 
OVERALL SCORE 
ONE TWO THREE 
SIXTEEN 
TWO TWO POINT SOME TWO POINT SOMETHING 
TWO AND TWO THIRDS 
IT'S OKAY BUT THAT'S YOU M MOSTLY IT'S IT'S INFLUENCED BY THE FACT THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT SPEECH RECOGNITION 
'CAUSE YEAH THAT GIVES YOU A SEVEN WHICH RUINS YOUR YOUR AVERAGE 
WITHOUT THAT IT WOULD BE LIKE UNDER IT WOULDN'T YEAH IT WOULD BE UNDER TWO 
SO I THINK WE HAVE EVEN WITH THIS IT'S REASONABLE 
WELL I THINK IT'S TWO IS OKAY 
YEAH TWO IS PRETTY GOOD 
DEFINITELY 
YEAH 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY I I DO ADMIT THAT WE D DID MISS A LITTLE OR DIDN'T SP DIDN'T TALK TALK ENOUGH ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE L. C. D. DISPLAY 
WE COULD HAVE SAID IT MORE EFFICIENTLY WE JUST DIDN'T THINK IF IT THAT WAY 
SO LIKE I SAID CHANGING CHANNELS EVERYTHING HIDDEN IN YOUR L. C. D. DISPLAY SO YOU JUST NEED THE NAVIGATION BUTTONS TO DO EVERYTHING 
I THINK WE DIV I THINK WE DID VERY WELL UH EV EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THIS SCRO WE DID QUITE WELL 
IT JUST LOOKING FOR IMPROVEMENTS WHAT WHAT YOU COULD HAVE IMPROVED 
SO 
THEY SH THEY SHOULD GET KIDS AND JUST STICK 'EM ON T. V. AND SAY CHANGE THE CHANNEL 
I DON' THINK SO 
UH IT'S JUST NOT TOO IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE 
OR YOUR SH YOU SHOULD ALSO THE L. C. D. SCREEN PROBABLY BUT I THINK THAT'S I THINK THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS MORE WORTH THAN SPEECH RECOGNITION 
DEFINITELY 
OKAY THAT WAS THAT 
SO THAT'S THE FINAL PRODUCT WITHOUT THE SPEAKERS I GUESS 
LET'S SEE WHAT WAS LEFT ON THE THE ANOTHER ONE 
HMM 
YEAH WE EVALUATE THE PRODUCT 
GENERAL PROJECT WHAT'S I IN FOR EXAMPLE I TH I THOUGHT WE WERE PRETTY CREATIVE IN WHAT WE CREATED 
WE TAKE THE WHOLE NEW APPROACH OF MAKING EXCHANGEABLE COVER FOR EXAMPLE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY CREATIVE BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER NEVER EVER LISTED SOMEWHERE 
WELL 
ANYWAYS 
YEAH LEADERSHIP IS UP TO YOU 
I MEAN PERHAPS I SCREWED UP BECAUSE I D PUT A PUT A SPEECH RECOGNITION INTO IT 
BUT THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE 
I THINK WE DID PRETTY WELL AS TEAM WORK THOUGH 
BECAUSE YEAH WAS VERY HARD TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER IF YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE IN THE MEANTIME 
BECAUSE WHEN I GOT THE WHEN I GOT THE INPUT FOR THE FINANCIAL RESULTS INITIALLY OF COURSE I WANTED TO CONTACT YOU 
SAY LIKE THIS IS YOU'RE DOING THE WRONG THING YOU'RE SO YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME NOW BECAUSE WE'RE IMPLEMENTING STUFF THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD 
SO IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU IF THERE WAS MORE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN UH BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WOULD WE YOU WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY DO 
EITHER CALL OR EMAIL SOMEONE 
SO THAT WAS TOO BAD CON WAS IMPOSSIBLE HERE ANYWAYS 
IT DIDN'T HAVE OR DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY COSTS OR WHATEVER 
THERE WAS JUST TOO LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THINGS ACTUALLY COST AND IF YOU COULD USE THEM 
SO THAT WAS A LITTLE UNCLEAR I SUPPOSE 
I THINK A SMARTBOARD SMARTBOARD IS PRETTY COOL 
I THINK UH S ESPECIALLY FOR DESIGN ISSUES IT'S VERY EASY JUST TO GIVE YOUR GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS A LITTLE IT'S EASIER TO SHARE THEM 
IT'S A LITTLE LESS AT THE RESPONSE TIME AS L IT'S VERY BAD 
IT'S GOOD TO VISUALISE EVERYTHING BUT I THINK THE RESPONSE TIME SHOULD COULD BE A LOT BETTER 
DEFINITELY 
YEAH IT'S TRUE 
NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
NO YOU DON'T 
I JIN I DIDN'T CHECK THE FINISH BUTTON 
I JUST YOU JUST DITCH IT AND YOU CAN COPY IT OR WHATEVER 
UH ONLY IF YOU UH CHECK THE NOTES OR PRESS DONE 
THEN IT UM THEN YOU CAN THEN IT EXPORTS TO WORD AUTOMATICALLY 
BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO CHECK EITHER ONE OF THESE TWO 
YOU CAN JUST PREVIEW YOUR P YOU CAN JUST PREVIEW YOUR PAGE ON THE ON THE PROGRAMME 
OKAY BEFORE STARTING A IN A NEW PAGE 
OKAY THAT COULD BE B 
OKAY 
YEAH OKAY 
THAT'S 
YEAH IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE OKAY 
ANY NEW IDEAS 
YEAH MORE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BETWEEN UH THAT'S THE THING I NOTICED THAT COMMUNICATION IS VERY UM VERY IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE IF YOU GET NEW INFORMATION IT'S ESSENTIAL F FOR THE OTHER TEAM MATES TO KNOW THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
BECAUSE YOU WOULD AVOID MAKING DOING EXTRA WORK BECAUSE YOU WERE DOING EXTRA WORK NOW UH UM WORKING ON THE ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 
YOU HAVE LIMITATION BOTH IN THE TECHNICAL ON THE IDEA ON THE DESIGN SIDE 
SO I THINK THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
BUT THAT'S I THINK IT'S MORE OF A A SETTING HERE THAT YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE THAN UH THEN SOMEWHERE ELSE 
SO 
YEAH I THINK SO 
AND L LESS P LESS SPAM PROBABLY 
I'M NOT SURE I I'M NOT SURE YOU GET SPAMMED AS WELL 
BUT I GOT SPAMMED LIKE VERY IT EVERY TWO MINUTES THERE WAS A THERE WAS ANOTHER EMAIL ABOUT MASTER CLASSES OR SOMETHING 
SO WHICH WERE TOTALLY USELESS ACTUALLY 
I THOUGHT I SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK INTO THEM BUT THEY WERE ALL USELESS 
SO I JUST 
OH OKAY 
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY UH MORE INFORMATION IT'S JUST ALWAYS THE SAME HERE 
SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF A 
IT WOULD CHANGE BUT NOT FOR ME 
SO I'D I HAD AN EXTRA INFORMATION TO GO ON THAT ONE THEN WHAT YOU GIVE ME ACTUALLY 
I COULDN'T DO ANY RESEARCH MYSELF OR I SEE THAT'S YEAH W I COULD HAVE DONE A LITTLE EXTRA WORK PROBABLY THEN 
BUT I WAS BUSY ENOUGH ANYWAY 
SO 
ANY NEW IDEAS FOUND 
OR IS THAT A 'CAUSE UH YEAH IT'S WILL PROBABLY IS 
I HAVE NO CLUE 
THAT'S LIKE IT 
SHOULD I IF THE PROJECT IS EVALUATED AND IT WAS IT WAS IN B WITHIN BUDGET WE SHOULD CELEBRATE 
SO 
OH OKAY THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT 
OH 
I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE SHOULD STILL DO THOUGH UH IT LET'S SEE WHAT ALL YOUR TASKS WERE FINISHED RIGHT 
WHAT YOU UH FROM YOUR ASSISTANT 
SO LET'S 
OKAY I SHOULD I THINK I SH I STILL HAVE THE THE TOTAL REPORT TO FINISH UP 
I THINK WE TOOK VERY LITTLE TIME NOW BECAUSE 
YEAH WE'RE IN AGREEMENT EVERYTHING THE DESIGN IS OKAY 
THE ONE THING WE MISSED THOUGH 
WE DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT NAME 
HOW ABOUT YOU COOK A HOW ABOUT YOU COOK UP A PRODUCT NAME 
JUST UH THINK OF A CATCHY NAME 
I'LL BE WORKING ON THIS UNTIL THE BEEP UNTIL IT BEEPS 
SO 
WHAT 
FRUIT 
YOU DON'T WANT TO TO RESEMBLE A BANANA 
IT'S NOT YELLOW ANYWAY 
IT'S NOT YELLOW ANYMORE 
IT IS CURVED BUT 
NO IT'S 
HMM 
REAL REACTION FUTURE R. C. 
STEP INTO THE FEATURE OF OF REMOTE CONTROLLING YOUR T. V. 
NO THAT'S A THAT'S A CATCHY SLOGAN 
CONTROL YOUR REMOTE CONTROL 
I GO FOR FUTURE R. C. PROBABLY 
SOMETHING LIKE 
IT'S SHORT F 
REAL REACTOR 
UH THAT THAT'S 
THAT MAKES ME THINK OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAN A REMOTE CONTROL REALLY 
I'M NOT SURE 
REAL REACTION IN A REAL 
REAL REACTOR 
DIDN'T NOTICE 
MM 
I TAKE F YEAH TAKE A BANANA 
HMM 
NO NOT LIKE THAT 
IT SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE LONGER BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PRODUCT NAME THAT YOU F PRINT ON A BOX 
JUST WRITE IT TRIPLE LIKE A WORD TRIPLE R. C. TRIPLE STRIPE OH 
TRIPLE DASH R. DASH S S C. 
YEAH 
R. DASH C. 
DASH 
TRIPLE R. OR TRIPLE R. C. 
HOW ABOUT DO BOTH 
SURE IF IT LOOKS STUPID 
UH I THINK THAT THE THE R. C. TOGETHER TAKES AWAY THE THE THE IMAGE IF IT'S A TRIPLE 
UH THE FIRST THE FIRST ONE LOOKS LIKE IT'S A TRIPLE REMOTE CONTROL BUT IT'S ONLY A SINGLE REMOTE CONTROL 
AND IT'S ESPECIALLY IN THE TRIPLE R. THAT'S IMPORTANT 
THE REAL REACTION REMOTE 
YEAH TRIPLE R. YEAH YOU CAN 
YEAH TRIPLE R. 
BANANA REMOTE 
I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE TRIPLE R. 
I THINK TRIPLE R. S COOL 
AND IT LOOKS COOL WHEN YOU PRINT IT IN FONT LOOKS PRETTY COOL 
JUST LIKE THIS JUST AND YOU JUST PRINT TRIPLE R. IT LOOKS DOESN'T LOOK BAD IT'S SHORT IT'S OKAY 
SO HAVE TO WRITE MY REPORT NOW I GUESS 
UM 
UM 
YEAH SO WE HAVE EVERYTHING 
WE HAVE THE PRODUCT WE HAVE THE COSTS WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF EVERYTHING 
OKAY 
I THINK IT'S ADJOURNED 
RETIRE TO MY LAIR AND FINISH THE REPORT 
THAT WAS A SHORT MEETING 
BUT EFFICIENT THOUGH 
PROBABLY 
SO 
OKAY GOODBYE 
COULD YOU GUYS DRAW UM A PICTURE OF THE FINAL DESIGN TO PUT IN THE COVER OF THE REPORT 
I THINK IT'S MORE OR LESS THE SAME AS WE HAD 
NO MUCH SO 
NO NO NO NOT AT ALL 
HMM 
YEAH OF COURSE 
THAT'S UH THE INTEGRATION STORY AGAIN 
NO UH THIS IS JUST A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE SEE THERE 
SO 
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF 
HMM 
I D 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
HUH 
OKAY BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM 
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM 
IF WE TAKE ANOTHER COVER FOR INSTANCE BLACK THEN WE ALSO NEED ANOTHER BUTTON FORM 'CAUSE BLACK AND BLACK DOESN'T WORK OBVIOUSLY 
HUH 
HUH 
YEAH 
HMM 
HMM 
RIGHT 
I AGREE 
MM-HMM 
OR SAY LET'S ALSO RUBBER TAKE PLASTIC 
YES 
ALTHOUGH WE ARE DEMOLISHING A LITTLE BIT THE STYLE 
BUT 
YEAH 
CAN WE THEN NOT ALSO UH CHANGE THE MATERIAL 
WE TAKE PLASTIC FOR THE BASIC COVER AND 
WE CAN PUT THIS AT THE AT THE OTHER COVERS 
THAT'S TRUE 
BUT OKAY 
BUT WHAT DO YOU THEN SUGGEST WE'D LOSE 
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOSE TWO THINGS AND I GUESS 
YES 
OKAY AND THAT'S ENOUGH 
HMM 
HMM 
PERHAPS WE SHOULD MAKE UM 
HUH 
PERHAPS WE SHOULD MAKE CLEAR TO OUR CUSTOMER THAT WE HAD TO DO THIS TO STAY UNDER THE COST 
AND THAT'S UH THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS AN OPTION AND THAT WE HAD TO DROP THE OPTION TO STAY UNDER THE COST THAT THEY KNOW THAT 
PERHAPS THEY DECIDE THE 
OF COURSE 
PERHAPS THEY UH NO BUT PERHAPS THEY THINK OH OKAY THE COVER AS SUCH A NICE IDEA 
UH LET'S THAT THAT THEN THEY UH THAT ALLOW US TO MAKE SOME MORE COSTS 
WE C WE UH WE CAN AT LEAST TELL THEM THAT 
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT 
HUH 
NO I'M NOT UH TALKING ABOUT THAT COST BUT THE ON THAT G HAS GIVEN US THE ORDER TO DESIGN THIS 
WE COULD AT LEAST UM UH MAKE IT LIKE THIS LIKE YOU SAID AND THEN TELL THEM OKAY 
WE HAD TO DROP THIS AND THAT JUST THAT YOU KNOW 
IT IS AN STILL AN OPTION BUT NOT FOR THIS PRICE 
EXACTLY BUT 
HMM 
I'D SAY LOSE THE CURVE AND THE COLOUR AND 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
OH 
I AGREE 
NO 
HMM 
YES 
HUH 
HMM 
UM IT I FELT A BIT BLIND THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING I HAD AN LIST OF AVAILABLE MATERIALS 
AND THEN I D HAD NOT LIST OF AVAILABLE C FINANCES 
SO 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
NO 
HMM 
MANUAL 
I THINK THE L. C. D. DISPLAY COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT THAN A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL BUT THEN AGAIN IT'S FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
SO 
YEAH I TH 
EXACTLY 
NO THAT'S TRUE 
I THINK IT WON'T BE A BIG PROBLEM 
OH 
UM 
WITH THE MORE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS ON 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
THE MENUS UH 
THINGS LIKE BRIGHTNESS AND UH THIS KIND OF THINGS WE'VE PUT IN THE MENU BECAUSE WE HAVE NO BUTTONS FOR THIS 
YES 
MM 
YES 
NAH IT'S NOT REALLY ONLY AN EXTRA 
NO MENUS 
THINK ABOUT 
HMM 
BUT 
UM 
CHANGING COVERS IS ALSO TREND THAT WE FOLLOWED 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM 
SIX 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
MM-HMM 
HMM OF COURSE 
MM-HMM 
BUT I THINK FOR THIS PRICE THIS IS IT'S REALLY A REASONABLE PRODUCT 
IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT 
OH 
OH 
YEAH 
BUT IF PEP PEOPLE REALLY WANT SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN THEY MUST BE PREPARED IT UP TO PAY MORE BECAUSE IT'S CANNOT BE DONE FOR THIS 
HMM YEAH 
UH BUT FOR THIS PRICE UH YOU CANNOT ASK THAT 
YOU CANNOT TH THINK OF THAT 
NO IT'S NOT 
MM-HMM 
UH IT'S ALSO MORE ATTRACTIVE 
HMM 
YES 
HMM 
HMM 
YEAH 
HUH 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT I HAD IN THE BEGINNING 
EVERYBODY WAS USING MATERIALS THAT SO I DIDN'T HAVE 
SO 
OH 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
BUT THERE'S UH ALSO NO PROBLEM WITH THIS I NOTICED 
UH YOU HAVE TO FINISH A PAGE BEFORE GOING TO A ONE 
OKAY I SAW THAT UH 
HMM 
YEAH BUT I MADE 
OKAY BUT I MADE THREE PAGES AND THEY WERE NOT FINISHED 
AND WHEN THE THIRD ONE WAS FINISHED I WANTED TO DOWNLOAD IT AND THEN IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE ANYMORE 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO CLOSE ALL THE PINNITS UH THE PAGES BEFORE GOING FURTHER 
EXACTLY 
SO WE CANNOT WORK ON MORE THAN ONE PAGE AT SOME TIME 
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE 
YOU HAVE TO FINISH IT COMPLETELY THEN DOWNLOAD IT IT'S THEN START A NEW ONE 
THAT'S NOT VERY UH HANDY BUT IF YOU KNOW THAT THEN IT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
HMM 
MM-HMM 
WELL 
HMM 
HUH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
MM 
HMM 
HMM 
HMM 
NO 
OKAY BRING TO THE BEAR 
I HAVE ONE MORE EMAIL 
MY COACH IS UH BEING VERY SILENT NOW 
NO WE HAVEN'T THINK ABOVE ABOUT THAT 
HUH 
IT'S BETTER THAN THE I THINK THAN A SERIAL NUMBER 
SONY UH T. R. SOMETHING UH F MEANS NOTHING TO ME 
OH 
LIKE FRUIT NAMES 
UH AT LEAST IT'S NOT SOMETHING WITH NUMBERS 
NUMBERS OR SO MEANINGLESS TO THE PEOPLE 
I MEAN 
REAL REACTION 
REAL REACT 
THE REAL REACTOR I DON'T FIND THAT UH THAT BAD AT ALL 
YEAH 
BECAUSE OUR NAME IS REAL REACTION 
I'M LOOKING FOR THINGS IN THE NAME 
SO THAT THE FIRST THREE LETTERS ARE IS THE SAME 
R. U. I. R. U. I. 
THE TRIPLE R. 
REAL REACTION REMOTES CONTROL 
TRIPLE R. 
YEAH 
YEAH THAT 
I THINK 
TRIPLE R. 
DOESN'T SOUND 
YEAH 
OH 
I THINK I LIKE IT LIKE THIS MORE 
HMM 
MM 
I WOULD HUH 
I WOULD ALSO THE C. AND JUST NAME IT TRIPLE R. 
IT SOUNDS LIKE UH THINKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND COMBINING IT 
I WOULD JUST SAY TRIPLE R. S TRIPLE R. 
THAT'S ALSO SHORT CATCHY 
BANANA 
YES 
DID YOU DO NOW 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEP 
MM-HMM 
THE BOSS IS ALWAYS THE LAST ONE TO GO HOME 
SO 
SO YOU IN A MINUTE 
OKAY 
CAN'T WE TAKE THIS ONE 
OTHERWISE WE HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN 
SO IT OKAY IF I TRY 
SO THAT OKAY WITH YOU 
I'LL PUT IT BACK IN A MINUTE 
OKAY IT HAS BEEN SAVING SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE IT I DON'T KNOW 
UH CAN I SAY EXP YES I CAN 
EXPORT AS J. PEG 
OKAY CAN I NOT PUT THIS 
WHEREVER I WANTS 
MY DOCUMENT IS THE WRONG ONE HUH 
I CANNOT 
I DON'T THINK SO 
DOCUMENT AND SETTINGS 
THAT'S A PITY 
THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE IT GONNA DRAW IT AGAIN 
OR YOU GONNA DO THAT 
OKAY 
THAT 
YES 
OKAY 
OKAY 
OKAY 
YES THAT'S CORRECT 
OKAY 
NO 
UH IT'S EXPORT 
OKAY 
UH OF COURSE 
SORRY 
UH WE DON'T HAVE ANY CHANGES DO WE 
SO NO 
IT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE AGREED UPON BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIED 
UH SO 
FINAL DESIGN 
BASICALLY ON WHAT WE DISCUSSED COVER AND BUTTONS WILL BE MADE OF RUBBER YELLOW COLOUR BLACK COMPONENTS AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT OVER HERE 
WE CHOOSE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF COLOUR FOR THE MENU 
A BIT DARKER YELLOW IS THAT IT COM REALLY SHOWS ON THIS KEYPAD 
IF YOU PUT THEM ALL BLACK IT'S NOT REALLY THAT GOOD A CONTRAST 
SO 
PROBAB YEAH 
THAT'S THE B 
AND IT I GUESS IT'S MORE EASIER TO JUST PAINT IT IN THE RUBBER THEN IT UH 
SO WE HAVE IT'S A BIT ROUND SHAPED THAT'S WHAT WE HAD UH 
WE CHOOSE THE BUTTONS TO BE UH TELETEXT OKAY BUTTON FAVOURITE CHANNEL AND THE MUTE 
SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE CHOOSE EITHER 
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD PLEASE INTERRUPT ME 
OH 
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT 
OH SORRY 
I'D SAY THAT IT 
UH WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A EXTRA FUNCTION WITH THE SPEECH SAMPLE WHICH YOU CAN'T DO WITH A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL WHICH PEOPLE ALREADY DO 
SO 
WELL I'D I TEND TO DISAGREE WITH YOU IN THAT BECAUSE THE TREND ISSUE WAS A BIG ISSUE WHEN WE STARTED DESIGNING THIS 
SO CAN'T WE JUST BASICALLY EXTEND IT TO THIRTEEN 
OKAY 
YEAH 
WE DO 
WE COULD TAKE IT A CURVE INDEED 
I THINK THE COLOUR IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE REALLY THE CURVE BECAUSE IF YOU JUST END UP WITH AN ENTIRELY BLACK REMOTE CONTROL 
SO BLACK AND GREY IS OKAY 
WHICH WE CAN FABRICATE OKAY 
NO WE BASICALLY 
WE NEED TO STICK TO THAT 
BUT THEY DON'T 
WELL 
AND IF WE 
SO WHICH CURVE IS THAT BE THAT'S BASICALLY THAT CURVE 
SO WE COULD U STILL HAVE THE COMFORT 
I SECOND THAT 
NO THAT IT WOULD TURN IT TO BE A PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD REMOTE CONTROL 
SO THAT'S NOT REALLY THAT 
I WOULD 
YEAH 
I WOULD SAY I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU IN THE COLOUR BECAUSE THAT'S AN EXTRA OPTION 
AN EXTRA SERVICE WE CAN DELIVER FOR A LITTLE BIT OF MORE MONEY 
SO WE CAN ALWAYS DO THAT 
WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT WE DISCUSSED 
YES WE COULD HAVE 
WELL I HOPE IT SELLS 
WHICH ARE BASICALLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE MENU BUTTON 
YEAH 
WHICH IS NOT AN OPTION 
TO MAKE IT THAT WAY YEAH 
MM YEAH 
AND IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD YOU HAVE A NAVIGATION NO KEYS TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE L. C. D. MENUS 
SO 
NO I DO AN CAT 
NO IT IT IS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
WELL BASICALLY THE MENU OPTIONS INDEED 
BUT 
NO 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TWO OR THREE 
SO 
YOU CAN SEVEN 
ARE WE COULD SAY IT 
ARE WE COULD SAY NEUTRAL WE 'CAUSE WE SCRATCHED THE 
C 
NO WE DON'T HAVE THE COLOUR 
SO I 
YES BUT THE END PRODUCT IS 
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO WITH A TWO THEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT PERFECT BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO IT INITIALLY BUT WE 
YEAH 
OVERALL SCORE 
TEN SIXTEEN 
DIVIDED BY 
SO TWO TWO THIRD 
THERE'S 
YEAH IF WE MAKE IT INTO A FOUR IS IN NEUTRAL BECAUSE WE DIDN'T IMPLEMENT IT 
SO WE CAN'T SAY THAT WE THAT IT'S REALLY NOT WELL IMPLEMENTED 
WE CAME OUT IN A AVERAGE OF TWO ONE EIGHTH 
SO WHICH IS PRETTY W GOOD 
IT'S AT LEAST IN THE POSITIVE SIDE 
SO WE COULD DEFINITELY HAVE DONE BETTER IF WE'VE HAD MORE RESOURCES BUT 
YEAH 
TRUE 
SO DID YOU 
YEAH 
AND WE COULD SHARE INFORMATION WHICH WE RECEIVED 
YEAH 
ALTHOUGH FOR ACTUAL DESIGN I'D SAY THE RESPONSE TIME SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BECAUSE 
THE DIGITAL PEN WAS DEFINITELY BETTER TO DRAW MY IDEAS AND IT 
FURTHER ELABORATE ON THAT 
SO 
UH CAN YOU 
OKAY 
YEAH WELL IT COULD ALSO POSSIBLY BE WELL SO IT A MORE REAL TIME INFORMATION BASE SO WE CAN ALL IS WHICH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO ONE ANOTHER 
WELL I PERSONALLY DID NOT HAVE THAT BUT 
THAT'S PROBABLY YOUR L DESCRIPTION 
BUT I ALSO DIDN'T NOT REALLY 
BUT STILL YOU HAD THAT AS WELL 
SO THAT WE FINISHED UP THE DESIGN AND THEN WE CHECKED THE WEBSITE AND THEN THERE WAS JUST EXTRA INFORMATION 
THERE WAS A LITTLE DELAY ON THE BIT OF A C 
CRUCIAL DELAY 
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE FOR THIS ANYWAY 
YEAH 
CHAMPAGNE 
PRODUCT NAME 
THE BANA 'CAUSE IT'S NOT YELLOW ANYMORE 
WELL UH I WAS GOING FOR THE R. C. DELUXE BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A CATCHY NAME OR ANYTHING IT'S MORE 
SOMETHING WITH OUR COMPANY NAME CAN WE DO ANYTHING WITH THAT 
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE WEBSITE WHICH WILL HELP US TO 
THE REACTION DELUXE 
SO THAT A NAME OR A C CAMPAIGN 
YEAH 
OR THE 
THE REAL REACTOR 
YOU SHOULD WRITE IT DOWN AS A AN OPTION 
SO THAT'S AN OPTION 
SHOULD I WROTE THE BANANA DOWN OR 
SURE 
WELL I 
UH DO YOU MEAN IT LIKE 
YOU MEAN IT LIKE THIS 
DASH C. 
LIKE A C. RIGHT NOW OR A DASH IN A C. 
SO IT TRIPLE R. C. S 
NO 
WELL THAT'S ANOTHER OPTION 
OKAY SO WHICH ONES ARE WE GOING TO SCRATCH 
DEFINITELY 
I SAY THIS ONE AS WELL 
TRIPLE R. 
TRIPLE R. TO USE 
YEAH SURE 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHETHER WE CAN SAVE IT IS A PICTURE OR NO 
SURE 
NETWORK PLACES
