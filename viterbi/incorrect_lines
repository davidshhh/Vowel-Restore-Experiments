BUT THERE IS NO I. D. FOR AN UTTERANCE I THINK
YOU ALWAYS COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE TIME STAMPS AND THEN TAKE THE ONES THAT UH BELONG TOGETHER TO FORM AN UTTERANCE
UH YEAH
YOU S UH YOU SAID YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN UH IMPLEMENTING THE IDEA
BUT UM I'VE ONLY JUST GOT THE NOTES
YEAH B I UH W THAT'S WHAT I WAS UH THOUGHT
UM WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS THAT THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF THINGS WITHOUT WITHOUT S TIME STAMPS IN THE BEGINNING
F MAYBE THE FILE NUMBER OR SOMETHING THAT IS IN THE BEGINNING
UM I THINK THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF NUMBERS IN THE BEGINNING WHERE N THERE IS NO TIME STAMP FOR THE NUMBERS
YEAH THERE I ARE NUMBERS IN THE UM THE W. TAG BUT THERE ARE NO TIME STAMPS
OKAY SO BUT THERE ARE NO TIME STAMPS ANNOTATED TO THAT
B. R. E. AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IS IT EVERYTHING ORDERED ARE THE TIME STAMPS GLOBAL OR UH ARE THEY LOCAL AT ANY POINT
YEAH IT'S QUITE EASY TO JUST COUNT AND S OR SORT THEM BY UM FREQUENCY
IS IT TOO BIG
UM IT'S IN WHAT IS IMPLEMENTED IN RAINBOW IS INFORMATION GAIN AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THEY CALCULATE THAT
UH THAT'S WHAT RAINBOW DOES
UH OKAY
UM YEAH W WOULD IT BE BEST
UH
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO MAKE THE FREQUENCY COUNTS WITH A JAVA HASH TABLE
AND DEPENDING ON WHAT OUR UM ZOOM LEVEL IS WE JUST DISPLAY A PART OF IT
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU WOULD UM GIVE A HIGH VALUE TO THOSE UM SEQUENCES YOU WANT TO DISPLAY IN THE MEETING SERIES SUMMARY
AND THAT'S NOT SO MUCH WHAT HE MEANT WITH NOT POSSIBLY LOADING EVERYTHING WAS THAT YOU M UM LOAD ALL THE UH ANNOTATION STUFF
IN
UM I R I I'M GETTING QUITE LOST UM AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE UM W WHAT'S UM OUR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UM SE UM UH THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE AND THE SKIMMING
I MEAN DO WE DO BOTH OR IS IT THE SAME THING
SO BUT WHEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SUMMARIES YOU TALK ABOUT THIS UH ABO ABOUT SKIMMING AND NOT ABOUT
YEAH BUT IT USE THE SAME DATA
AND YEAH I THINK WE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT COMBINING THAT MEASURE WITH UM THE MEASURES I GET FROM UM S UH HOT SPOTS AND SO ON
SO THAT WOULD ALSO BE ON UTTERANCE LEVEL I THINK
FOR EXAMPLE IT LOADS ALL THE UTTERANCES AND SO ON BUT IT DOESN'T LOAD UM THE DISCOURSE ACTS AND FOR EXAMPLE NOT THE AND WHAT'S WHAT ELSE THERE
Y YOU MEAN THAT YOU UM BASICALLY SPLIT UP TH THE BIG THING INTO UM DIFFERENT SUMMARIES
N UH NO NO IT'S F FOR
IT'S FOR
NO I I THINK WE WOULD JUST TAKE THE SEGMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY THAT WERE YEAH THERE'S UM THIS SEGMENTS FILE
YEAH THAT'S UM
SEGMENTS UM AND FOR TH UM SEGMENTS IS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA WHAT IS DISPLAYED IN ONE LINE
UM FOR EX UM I I COMPARED IT WITH WHAT I DID FOR THE PAUSE UM DURATION EXTRACTION
BUT SOMETIMES UM HOWEVER THERE ARE UM SHORT PAUSES IN IT AND THEY'RE INDICATED BY SQUARE BRACKETS PAUSE OR SOMETHING IN THE DATA
FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE DIALOGUE ACTS AND SO ON
YEAH EVERYTHING THAT'S A WORD HAS A STI TIME STAMP
THAT'S AT THE END I THINK HER TIME
UH I I THINK IT WOULDN'T AS IT OCCURS I MEAN IT WOULD BE IT OCCURS IN EVERY MEETING
AH IT'S JUST TO TEST THE SYSTEM I THINK
UH TH YEAH
UM I JUST UM WONDERED SO WHO'S UH THEN DOING UM THE FREQUENCIES ON ON THE WORDS
BECAUSE I'M I THINK I WILL ALSO UM I COULD ALSO MAKE USE OF IT UM FOR THE AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT THING
BECAUSE I UM I IN MY OUTLINE I TALKED ABOUT UM USING THE UM DISCOURSE ACTS FIRST
AND UM THEN IN THE CHUNKS OF TEXT I FOUND LOOKING FOR WORD PATTERNS AND SO ON
SO UM I WOULD FOR EXAMPLE NEED THE UM MOST FREQ UM FREQUENT WORDS
SO IF YOU CUT OFF ALL THAT I'D WON'T BE USE OR
YEAH I I BUT I NEED IT FOR MY CHUNKS THEN
SO I WOULDN'T NEED IT
I THINK IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW L AS AS BIG AT AS THE HOT SPOT ANNOTATION THINGS
SO I WOULD PROBABLY JUST CONCATENATE ALL MY UM TEXT CHUNKS AND THEN LET'S SAY M I WILL RUN OVER IT
YE
AND SO ON
PE AND YOU HAVE A LOOK AT IT WILL IT MAKE SENSE FOR WHAT YOU WANT
YEAH I MEAN T I I HAVE ONE WHAT I GIVE YOU WOULD BE ONE FILE FOR EACH MEETING
UM THE YOU YOU THE DATA IS OF THE FORM YOU HAVE UM THREE IDENTIFICATION LETTER
SO B. E. D. OR B. B. D. OR SOMETHING AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE SAME GROUP
AND THEN AFTER THAT THERE'S UM A NUMBER LIKE O. O. ONE O. O. TWO
YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY QUITE EASY TO SEE BECAUSE THEY'RE NAMED
BUT I I MEAN AS UM THE START UH START TIMES UM START FOR EACH MEETING AT ZERO
YOU COULD JUST PROBABLY JUST UM ADD THE UM FINAL SECOND TIME TO THE NEXT MEETING AND SO ON AND JUST PUT IT ALL TOGETHER
BUT THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE UM THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHO ON WHICH CHANNEL IT WAS SET UM TO BY WHICH PERSON IT WAS SET
YEAH I W WOULD THEN JUST NOT PRINT OUT THE UM START AND END TIMES
NO I DIDN'T DO A SEA NO
FOR THE SERIES
YEAH ONE SERIES HAS THE UM SAME THREE STARTING LETTERS
YEAH YOU WANT IT ORDERED
YEAH SOMETIMES THEY'RE CONTAINED IN ONE ANOTHER
JUST AFTER TH MM-HMM
NA UM ALL THE WORDS TOGETHER UM FOR ALL THE MEETINGS
UM WHAT I BECAUSE NINE MEGA BYTE IS WHAT I GOT FOR WHEN I SAID FOR EVERY UM UTTERANCE THIS IS GOES FROM THERE TO THERE AND
SO SO UM I WILL PROBABLY SEND UM JUST ONE FILE OF THE FIRST MEETING UM TO ALL THOSE WHO NEED IT SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK WHETHER THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
UH MINE'S GONNA BE MOSTLY USING THE OFF LINE
IT'LL BE SO MUCH EASIER
I DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY MUCH POINT IN DOING LIKE THAT WHEN IT'S JUST GONNA FEED OFF IN THE END THE INFORMATION DENSITY MEASURE BASICALLY
SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SAY IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SERIES OF MEETINGS YOU JUST SAY WELL OUR WHOLE DOCUMENT COMPRISES OF ALL THESE STUCK TOGETHER
IS THAT
WELL ON THE UTTERANCE LEVEL I WAS THINKING
SO THE UTTERANCES WITH THE HIGHEST LIKE MEAN INFORMATION DENSITY
WELL THE TROUBLE WITH DOING IT ON THE WORD LEVEL IS IF YOU WANT THE AUDIO TO SYNCH UP
BUT LIKE AT FIRST IT'S JUST GONNA BE I. D. F.
YEAH THAT'S THE OTHER TH
I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO BUFFER THE AUDIO
LIKE JUST BUILD AN ANOTHER F WAVE FILE ESSENTIALLY
AND JUST BUILD ONE IN MEMORY
I HAVE NO IDEA
WELL WHAT I THINK I MIGHT TRY AND BUILD IS BASICALLY A CLASS THAT YOU JUST FEED IT A LINKED LIST OF UM DIFFERENT WAVE FORMS
IF IT SCORES HIGHER THAN THE ONES ALREADY IN THE SUMMARY SO FAR JUST REPLACE THEM
OKAY SO MAYBE WE SHOULD BUILD A B STORE A MEAN MEASURE FOR THE SEGMENTS AND MEETINGS AS WELL
IT MAY NOT BE EXACT EVERY TIME BUT IT'S A SO SORT OF SIZE WE'RE LOOKING FOR
BUT WHY DON'T WE JUST WRITE IT AS A NEW X. M. L. FILE
WE CAN JUST PROCESS IT ALL IN CHUNKS IF IT GETS TOO BIG TO LOAD IT INTO MEMORY
AND THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO DISPLAY
WELL IT MAY NOT FOR THE WHOLE MEETING BUT LIKE
DID HE NOT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT NAMED ENTITIES
IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO KNOW HOW EVERYONE'S GONNA STORE THEIR THINGS THOUGH
ARE YOU FREE AFTER THIS
YEAH NOTHING IN THE AFTERNOON
I'VE GOT NOTHING IN THE AFTERNOON
SO YOU HA YEAH
WHERE ABOUT JUST IN APPLETON TOWER
I'VE GOT SOME OTHER STUFF THAT NEEDS DONE ON MATLAB SO IF YOU'RE NOT THERE AT TWELVE I CAN JUST WORK ON THAT
WHY W
OH MINE'S JUST GONNA USE THE UM HASH MAP ONE IN UM JAVA
'CAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA DO IT ON SMALL DOCUMENTS
SO IT'S ONLY GONNA USE QUITE SMALL DOCUMENTS YOU SEE TO START WITH
'CAUSE IF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE UM FREQUENCY STATISTICS I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD BE CHANGED BY THE CLASSIFICATION
I THE
BUT ONE OF THESE BIG CORPUSES HAS A LIST OF STOP WORDS THAT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD AND THEY'RE JUST BASICALLY LISTS OF REALLY UNINTERESTING BORING WORDS THAT WE COULD FILTER OUT BEFORE WE DO THAT
IT'S LIKE THAT'S ONE THE PAPERS I READ
THAT'S UM ONE THINGS THEY DID RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING IS THEY'VE GOT THIS BIG S STOP LIST AND THEY JUST IGNORE ALL OF THOSE THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT
WELL ALL YOU REALLY WANNA DO IS LOOK INTO GETTING SOME SUB SET OF THE ICSI CORPUS OFF THE DICE MACHINES
HA HAS A C. D. BURNER THOUGH
'CAUSE I COULD JUST SAY AT UM GOING OVER S. C. P. ONE NIGHT AND JUST LEAVE IT GOING ALL NIGHT IF I HAD TO
I CAN IF I GET DOWN I CAN PUT TO C. D.
IS HOW MUCH DO WE GET
OH NO NO I WAS THINKING OF SSHING JUST INTO SOME MACHINE AND THEN JUST SCPING IT FROM THERE
BUT TH FIRST UH HOW BIG ARE THE CHUNKS
HOW BIG ARE THE CHUNKS YOU'RE LOOKING AT
SO QUITE SMALL THEN
YOU JUST DO THAT ON LINE 'CAUSE THAT WON'T TAKE LONG TO BUILD A LITTLE DICTIONARY THAT BIG WILL IT
UM WELL THAT'S THE T ARE YOU USING T. F. I. D. F. FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY
YOU ALSO NEED HOW MANY TIMES THINGS OCCUR WITHIN EACH DOCUMENT
MAYBE IF YOU JUST DO IT ONCE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IT IT WILL BE FINE
BUT I SUPPOSE IF YOU JUST DID IT GLOBALLY TREATING A MEETING AS A DOCUMENT
LIKE UM YEAH FOR EACH WORD OR WHATEVER BUT ACROSS THE WHOLE LOT IS WHAT I MEAN BY HIGHEST LEVEL
YEAH BUT YOU'D PROBABLY LOOK AT EACH MEETING AS A DOCUMENT
I MEAN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST BUILD AN X. M. L. FILE AND IF YOU WANT IT TO GET DOWN TO THE UTTERANCES YOU'D GO TO THE LEAVES
YOU'D GO TO THE PARENTS OF THOSE AND LIKE JUST GO FROM LIKE THE LEAVES INWARDS TOWARDS THE BRANCH TO BUILD UP THINGS LIKE UM YOU KNOW
LIKE THEN IF YOU NEED SOMETHING NEXT UP SO LIKE A TOPIC SEGMENT YOU'D GO TO HERE
BUT IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT SAY THIS ONE SO ONLY WENT LIKE THIS
RIGHT SO YOU IT'S SAME YOU'D START WITH THE LEAVES AND YOU GO OH I WANT A TOPIC SEGMENT
SEE AND THEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH JUST A TOPIC SEGMENT IN THERE IT'S THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
AND LIKE EACH TIME YOU WANT A HIGHER LEVEL YOU JUST NEED TO GO UP THE TREE
WELL NO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
BUT I MEAN IT COULD BE AS MANY NODES AS YOU WANT
SAY
THAT MIGHT BE A BIT CONFUSING THOUGH 'CAUSE YOU HAVE THINGS ON DIFFERENT LEVELS
I D HAVE NO IDEA
I'VE PROBABLY GOT A REASONABLE AMOUNT BECAUSE UM EVERYTHING ON MY DICE ACCOUNT CAN ACTUALLY BE DELETED 'CAUSE I STORE IT ALL AT HOME AS WELL
IS THAT GUARANTEED TO STAY THE
'CAUSE THAT'D BE REALLY USEFUL IS IF WE HAD A BIG DIRECTORY
NO ME NEITHER
MIGHT BE FUNNY TO SEE WHAT IS SUMMARISED THE WHOLE CORPUS AS ANYWAY
IS THAT IT
IF YOU'RE DOING IT IN JAVA COULD YOU UM SERIALIZE THE OUTPUT AS WELL AS WRITING IT TO A FILE
IF YOU'RE DOING IT IN JAVA COULD YOU SERIALIZE THE UM DICTIONARY YEAH AS WELL AS WRITING IT TO A FILE
TONIGHT I'LL TRY AND UM I'LL EITHER WORK SOME MORE ON UH THE T. F. I. D. F. SUMMARIZER OR DO THE AUDIO THING
I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE WE HAD TO SPECIFY IT OURSELVES THAT IT'S NOT AS UM LIKE FOCUS THE SPECIFICATION OF MOST UM WORK WE HAVE TO DO
DOES ANYONE WANT TO SEE UH STEVE'S FEEDBACK FROM THE SPECIFICATION
IT ONLY LOADS WHEN IT NEEDS A PARTICULAR TYPE OF FILE
YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE IDEA IT JUST LOADS THE PARTICULAR ONES IT NEEDS
YEAH WE DO NOT WANT IT IN TO DEVELOP A LITTLE TREE DISPLAY AS WELL FOR MULTIPLE RESULTS
YE THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I GET YEAH
YE
SO I GUESS UM IF I'M GONNA BE SEGMENTING IT WITH A L. C. SEG THEN THAT'S LIKE SAME FORMAT I'D WANT TO UM PUT IT BACK OUT IN SO IT'D BE EQUIVALENT
YE YEAH
YEAH AND THEN WE'LL MAYBE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE SOMEBODY INTO JUST INTEGRATING IT
UH YEAH
I WAS HAVING A LOOK IN IT A LOOK AT IT AS WELL AND I NOTICED THE UM THE SPEAKERS ARE ALL IN THAT SEPARATE FILE
YE YEAH C
MM I THOUGHT THEY WERE LOCAL TO TH A PARTICULAR MEETING
YEAH SHOULD WE NOT HAVE LIKE A GROUP DIRECTORY OR SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN PUT ALL OUR CODE IN AND THAT KINDA THING
YEAH IT'S JUST MO CHANGING IT A BIT
SUPPOSE WE'RE JUST GETTING ON WITH ALL OUR
WA
IS THERE MUCH MORE IN IT THAN HE D
IS THERE MUCH MORE IN IT THAN HE SAID YESTERDAY
YEAH NOW I'D SAY IF FOR THE PROTOTYPE IF WE JUST LIKE WHEREVER POSSIBLE P CHUNK IN THE STUFF THAT WE HAVE UM PRE ANNOTATED AND STUFF
SO THAT WE WE TAKE THE THE READY MADE PARTS AND JUST SEE HOW WE GET THEM WORK TOGETHER IN THE INTERFACE THE WAY WE WANT AND AND THEN WE HAVE A WORKING PROTOTYPE
AND THEN WE CAN GO BACK AND REPLACE PIECES EITHER BY OUR OWN COMPONENTS OR BY MORE SOPHISTICATED COMPO PO COMPONENTS OF OUR OWN
THE THING IS I'M AWAY THIS WEEKEND
UH PROBABLY LIKE AFTER TODAY'S MEETING WE THEN ACTUALLY NEED TO
WELL GO BACK FIRST OF ALL AND LOOK AT NITE X. M. L. TO SEE IN HOW FAR THAT THAT WHICH WE WANT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THAT WHICH NITE X. M. L. OFFERS US
SO I THINK IF TODAY WE DECIDE ON WHAT DATA WE WANNA HAVE NOW AND AND LATER MAYBE EVEN TODAY
JUST TRYING TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF THAT CODE AND SEE HOW DOES THE REPRESENTATION WORK IN THEIR SYSTEM
I'VE LOOKED LOOKED AT THE DOCUMENTATION AND N LIKE SEEN ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK THAT WE WANT TO USE THE NITE X. M. L. FRAMEWORK BECAUSE UM THEY HAVE A GOOD A EVENT MODEL THAT SYNCHRONIZES SORT OF THE DATA AND AND EVERY DISPLAY ELEMENT
BUT BEYOND THAT I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT AT ALL WHICH IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD REALLY DO
WHO ACTUALLY LIKE FOR THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION I MEAN WHO OF US IS DOING STUFF THAT IS HAPPENING ON LINE AND WHO OF US IS DOING STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING OFF LINE
TH YEAH THE SEARCH IS I GUESS THE SEARCH IS SORT OF A STRANGE BEAST ANYWAY BECAUSE FOR THE SEARCH WE'RE LEAVING THE NITE X. M. L. FRAMEWORK
AND NOBODY IS MODIFYING THAT DATA AT AT ON LINE TIME AT ALL IT SEEMS
YEAH BUT NOBODY OF US IS DOING MUCH OF SEARCHING FROM THE DATA IN THE ON LINE STAGE
I THINK WE ARE EASIER IF WE IF IT'S SITTING ON THE X. M. L. THAN IF IT'S SITTING ON THE S. Q. L. STUFF BECAUSE IF IT'S SITTING ON THE X. M. L.
AND WE CAN JUST MORE OR LESS LOOK AT THEIR CODE LIKE HOW THEIR PLAYER MOVES FORWARD
SO I THINK IN THE ACTUAL BROWSER ITSELF I DON'T WANNA SIT ON THE S. Q. L. IF WE CAN SIT ON THE X. M. L. BECAUSE SITTING ON THE X. M. L. WE HAVE ALL WE HAVE SO MUCH HELP
AND FOR Y FOR LIKE THE P THE CALCULATIONS THAT WE'RE DOING APART FROM THE SEARCH IT SEEMS THAT EVERYONE NEEDS SOME SPECIAL REPRESENTATIONS ANYWAY
YEAH IN IN THE NITE X. M. L. X. M. L. FORMAT SO WITH THEIR TIME STAMPS AND STUFF SO THAT IT'S EASY TO TO TIE TOGETHER ST THINGS
WHAT I'M LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IS IF WE GO WITH THIS MULTI LEVEL IDEA
LIKE THIS IDEA THAT SORT OF IF YOU START WITH A WHOLE MEETING SERIES AS ONE ENTITY AS ONE THING THAT YOU DISPLAY AS ONE WHOLE SORT OF
IF WE IF WE DO IT THIS WAY LIKE WE F WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THAT IF WE DO IT THIS WAY
SO THAT THE INTERFACE IN THE SENSE LIKE DEALS WITH IT AS IF IT'S SAME SO THAT THE INTERFACE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO WORRY WHETHER IT'S A MEETING IN THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES OR A SEGMENT WITHIN A MEETING
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THAT LIKE THE SUMMARY OF A MEETING WITHIN THE WHOLE MEETING CORPUS OR MEETING SERIES Y IS MEETING SERIES A GOOD WORD FOR THAT
UM SO IN IN THE MEETING SE SERIES SO THAT A SUMMARY FOR A MEETING WITHIN THE MEETING SERIES ARE SORT OF
SO THE ONLY THING THAT YEAH SO THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN BASICALLY IF I DOUBLE CLICK LET'S SAY FROM THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES ON A SINGLE MEETING
IS THAT THE ZOOM LEVEL CHANGES
LIKE THE TH THE START AND THE END POSITION CHANGES AND THE ZOOM LEVEL CHANGES
SO I'M S NOT SURE IF I GOT IT
I WA I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE TOTAL MEMORY COMPLEXITY OF IT
BUT I I COMPLETELY ADMIT I MEAN I JUST SORT OF LIKE TH TOOK THAT FROM SOME THING THAT JONATHAN ONCE SAID ABOUT NOT LOADING EVERYTHING
SO WHAT WE HAVE IS WE WOULD HAVE A WORD
ARE WE DOING IT ON TH THE WHOLE THING ON THE UTTERANCE LEVEL
OR ARE WE DOING IT ON WORD LEVEL LIKE THE INFORMATION DENSITY CALCULATION
WE I THINK WE HAVE START AND END TIMES FOR WORDS ACTUALLY BUT IT'S YEAH
BUT IT M IT MIGHT S BUT IT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY IN THE PLAYER
BUT THERE'S MAYBE SOME MERIT IN ALTOGETHER DOING IT ON AN UTTERANCE LEVEL IN THE END
WELL BUT ALSO ABOUT THE DISPLAYS I MEAN THE DISPLAYS IN THE IN THE TEXT BODY
IN THE IN THE LATEST DRAFT THAT WE HAD SORT OF WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT IT ISN'T DISPLAYING UTTERANCE FOR UTTERANCE
BUT IT'S ALSO DISPLAYING UH A SUMMARISED VERSION IN YOU KNOW LIKE BELOW THE BELOW THE GRAPH THE PART
YEAH R
OH YEAH F IT'S JUST LIKE THERE THERE'S LIKE AUDIO SKIMMING AND THERE'S DISPLAYED SKIMMING
MA MAYBE THERE'S SOME MERIT OF GOING ALTOGETHER FOR UTTERANCE LEVEL AND NOT EVEN BOTHER TO CALCULATE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT INTERNALLY
BUT MAYBE LIKE NOT EVEN STORE THE IMPORTANCE LEVELS FOR INDIVIDUAL WORDS AND JUST SORT OF RANK UTTERANCES AS A WHOLE
IF YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING ELSE JUST SORT OF MAKE THE MEAN OF THE WORDS OVER THE UTTERANCE
WELL WHAT'S THE SMALLEST CHUNK AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE THINKING OF OF ASSIGNING AN IMPORTANCE MEASURE TO IS IT A WORD OR IS IT AN UTTERANCE
SO WE'RE THINKING OF LIKE MAYBE JUST STORING IT ON A PER UTTERANCE LEVEL
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S LESS STUFF TO STORE PROBABLY FOR DAVE IN THE IN THE AUDIO PLAYING
AND FOR IN THE DISPLAY IT'S PROBABLY BETTER IF YOU HAVE WHOLE UTTERANCES THAN I DON'T KNOW
THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL WHEREAS IF YOU JUST UH SHOW IMPORTANT UTTERANCES BUT THE UTTERANCE AS A WHOLE IT MAKES MORE SENSE
THEY ARE ON
OH SO THAT'S GOOD ANYWAY THEN YEAH
BECAUSE THAT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER THAN TO T PUT IT ON UTTERANCE LEVEL
SORT OF LIKE BUT THAT LIKE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IT'S EASY TO DO IN THE TEXT LEVEL
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN IT WOULD STILL PLAY THE UH IN YOUR AUDIO UNLESS WE SORT OF ALSO STORE WHAT PIECES WE CUT OUT FOR THE AUDIO
BUT YEAH BUT NOT BUT NOT STORED ON THE HARD DISK AND THEN LOADED IN BUT LOADED IN DIRECTLY FROM MEMORY
BUT IT'S PROBABLY A STREAM IF IT EXISTS IN JAVA IT WOULD BE PROBABLY SOME BINARY STREAM GOING IN OF SOME TYPE
OKAY SO I MEAN SO THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S PROBABLY EVEN IF YOU GO ON AN PER UTTERANCE LEVEL
THERE'S STILL SOME MERIT ON WITHIN UTTERANCES CUTTING OUT STUFF WHICH CLEARLY ISN'T RELEVANT AT ALL AND THAT MAYBE ALSO FOR THE AUDIO WE'D HAVE TO DO
YEAH MAYBE EVEN I MEAN THAT'S SORT OF THAT DEPENDS ON HOW HOW ADVANCED WE GET
YOU CAN PROBABLY JUST MAKE SOME SIMPLE SIMPLE NORMALIZATION BUT THAT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE AND AND HOW MUCH IS NECESSARY
YEAH IF LIKE I D I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AUDIO AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PLAYER
SO IF YOU FIND THAT THE PLAYER ACCEPTS SOME N INPUT FROM MEMORY AND IF IT'S EASY TO DO THEN I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S FAIRLY DOABLE
SO BUT THAT MEANS IN THE GENERAL STRUCTURE WE'RE ACTUALLY QUITE LUCKY
WELL THE I GUESS THAT GOES WITH THE UTTERANCE WHO'S SPEAKING
BECAUSE THEN WE CAN ALSO DO THE DISPLAY ABOUT WHO'S SPEAKING
ON THE OTHER HAND
ACTUALLY FIFTY HUNDRED MEGABYTE IS QUITE BIG IN RAM
SO OUR HOPE IS ESSENTIALLY THAT WE LOAD LESS INTO IT
AH OKAY
SO THAT IS THAT ONLY BY TYPE OF FILE
IF IF UTTERANCES ARE SPLIT OVER THREE OR TEN OR W HUNDRED DIFFERENT FILES
IS THEN A CHANCE MAYBE THAT IT DOESN'T TRY TO LOAD THEM ALL INTO MEMORY AT THE SAME TIME BUT JUST
SO WHY DOES IT FAIL THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE
YEAH BUT YEAH BUT UM IT UH IT IT FAILED RIGHT WHEN YOU LOAD IT RIGHT THE NITE X. M. L. KIT SO THAT'S INTERESTING
LET'S CHECK THAT OUT
LIKE SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS THE WHOLE SERIES IN IN A V IN A STRUCTURE VERY SIMILAR TO THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH WE REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL UM MEETINGS
SO INSTEAD OF HAVING AN SINGLE UTTERANCE THAT WE DISPLAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE LIKE THAT WOULD BE REPRESENTING A WHOLE UM TOPIC A SEGMENT IN A MEETING
AND SORT OF SO THAT WI USING THE SAME DATA ST
AND TREATS THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITHIN THE SERIES AS IF THEY WERE SEGMENTS AND TREATS THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS WITHIN MEETINGS AS IF THEY WERE UM UTTERANCES
YOU KNOW SO WE JUST SORT OF WE SHIFT IT ONE LEVEL UP
AND IN THAT WAY WE COULD PROBABLY USE THE SAME ALGORITHM AND JUST LIKE MAKE VIR LIKE ONE OR TWO IFS THAT SAY OKAY
IF YOU ARE ON A WHOLE DOCUMENT UH A WHOLE SERIES LEVEL AND THAT WAS A DOUBLE CLICK
THEN DON'T JUST GO INTO THAT UM SEGMENT BUT LOAD A NEW FILE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT BUT IN GENERAL USE THE SAME ALGORITHM
YEAH AND IF YOU MAKE THAT STRUCTURALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THE THE LE LIKE ONE LEVEL DOWN
THEN MAYBE WE CAN MORE OR LESS USE THE SAME CODE AND JUST MAKE A FEW IFS AND STUFF
YEAH SO SO BUT STILL SO IN IN GENERAL WE'RE HAVING WE'RE HAVING UTTERANCES
AND OF COU AND THEY ALSO HAVE A TIME A TIME INFORMATION OF COURSE
YEAH SO AN INFORMATION WHICH TOPIC THEY'RE IN YEAH
AND AND PROBABLY SEPARATE TO THAT AN INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TOPICS LIKE THAT
SO THE SKIMMING CAN WORK ON THAT BECAUSE THE SKIMMING JUST SORT OF SORTS THE UTTERANCES AND PUTS AS MANY IN AS IT NEEDS
YEAH AND THEN YOU SORT OF FEED THE TIME STAMP TO AND THE NITE X. M. L. CENTRAL MANAGER
SO HOW MUCH DO THEY DISPLAY AND STARTING POSITION AT WHERE THE OR MAYBE THE MID POSITION OF IT
I DON'T KNOW LIKE W IF START WHERE THE THING WAS FOUND OR IF THAT THING WA WAS FOUND IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PART THAT WE DISPLAY
BUT THAT WE CAN DECIDE ABOUT BUT A GENERAL SORT OF
IT'S THE SAME THING IF LIKE WHETHER YOU PLAY AND IT MOVES FORWARD OR WHETHER YOU JUMP TO A POSITION THROUGH SEARCH
SO WE JUST WE TIE UH P JUST A VERY SHORT X. M. L. FILE
FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY AND WE JUST TIE THAT TO THE EXISTING UTTERANCES AND TIE THEM TO THE EXISTING SPEAKER CHANGES
WELL OTHERWISE WE PROBABLY HAVE TO GO OVER IT AND LIKE ADD SOME INTEGER THAT WE JUST INCREMENT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM SORT OF TO EVERY UTTERANCE AS AN AS AN I. D. SOME TYPE
OR UN OR TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW NITE X. M. L. I. D. S WORK AND MAYBE THERE'S SOME SPECIAL ROUTE WE HAVE TO FOLLOW WHEN WE USE THESE I. D. S
YEAH THE THE GIRL SAID THE UTTERANCES THEMSELVES ARE NOT NUMBERED AT THE MOMENT
IS THAT A BOARD MARKER PEN ACTUALLY
THAT'S JUST SO LIKE TO MAKE A LIST OF ALL THIS STUFF OR WE PROBABLY CAN SOMEBODY CAN DO IT ON PAPER
SO WHAT SO THE STUFF WE HAVE WE HAVE UTTERANCES AND SPEAKERS AND WEIGHTS FOR UTTERANCES
OR WE JUST TIE IT TO IT
OH SO SORRY UM
AND IF THE TIME STAMPS ARE ON A WORD LEVEL THEN WE B SOMEHOW HAVE TO EXTRACT TIME STAMPS FOR UTTERANCES WHERE THEY START
IS THE UH IS THAT THE SAME AS UTTERANCES THAT IS THAT THE SAME AS UTTERANCES THAT
WHAT SO THAT'S OH
LIKE IT'S IT'S THE SA IT'S SORT OF LIKE ONE PERSON'S CONTRIBUTION AT A TIME SORT OF THINGY DINGY
OKAY SO YEAH SO WE HAVE THOSE AND AND THEN WE HAVE SOME F FIELD SOMEWHERE ELSE WHICH HAS
YEAH AND AND A TOPIC'S BASICALLY THEY ARE JUST ON THE I. D. PROBABLY WITH A START TIME OR SOMETHING
AND AND THE UTTERANCES REFERENCED TO THOSE TOPICS I GUESS
SO IF THIS LAZY LOADING WORKS THEN THIS SHOULD DEFINITELY FIT INTO I MEAN NOT MEMORY THEN BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T ALL BE IN MEMORY AT THE SAME TIME
SO IF WE JUST HAVE THOSE SORT OF THAT INFORMATION LIKE A LONG LIST OF ALL THE UTTERANCES SLASH SEGMENTS AND LIKE SHORT OR SMALLER LISTS WHICH GIVE WEIGHT TO THEM
LIKE IF IF THERE'S A LOT OF BUREAUCRACY INVOLVED WITH HAVING TWO DIFFERENT TREES AND WHETHER ONE TIES TO THE OTHER BECAUSE THE ONE HAS THE WEIGHT FOR THE OTHER
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WHOLE BEAUTY THAT LIKE YOU CAN JUST MAKE A NEW X. M. L. FILE AND SORT OF TIE THAT TO THE OTHER AND AND IT TRE
SO NO I DIDN'T I DIDN'T MEAN TREE
THEN IT WOULD PROBABLY BE FOR US EASY TO JUST LIKE OFF LINE PUT THE THE WEIGHT INTO INTO THE FILE THAT HAS THE SEGMENTS
UH YEAH SEGMENTS SLASH UTTERANCES ALREADY
BUT OTHERWISE WE'RE DOING IT THE SAME WAY THAT THEY ARE DOING IT
WE IN A SENSE WE I THINK WE ARE RUNNING QUERIES IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT UM WHAT WE LOAD AND WHAT WE DON'T LOAD
BUT WE'RE L RUNNING QUERIES IN THE SENSE THAT WE DYNAMICALLY SELECT BY BY WEIGHTS DON'T WE
WHETHER THAT'S TOO MANY RESULTS AND WHETHER WE SHOU
IF 'CAUSE IF IT I LET'S SAY I MEAN IF IF THEIR QUERY LANGUAGE IS STRANGE AND IF IT WOULD RETURN B TEN MILLION RESULTS AND IT CAN'T HANDLE IT
THEN WE CAN JUST WRITE OUR INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS IN THE WAY THAT THEY KNOW WHICH WHAT THE THRESHOLD IS
SO THEY STILL GET ALL THE DATA AND JUST THEY INTERNALLY SAY OH NO THIS IS LESS THAN THREE AND I'M NOT GONNA DISPLAY IT OR SOMETHING
BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL MODULE LIKE THE PLAYER AND THE DISPLAY SAY LIKE THEY STILL GET SORT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT UTTERANCES
UH ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES BUT THEY SAY OH THIS PIECE I LEAVE OUT BECAUSE IT'S BELOW THE CURRENT THRESHOLD LEVEL
WHEN DO WE NEED THE ONE FOR THE MEET
YEAH I GUESS FOR THE SO WHEN WE HAVE THE DISPLAY WILL WE DISPLAY THE WHOLE SERIES
IF I MEAN W IF ONE OF THE PEOPLE DOING DIL HAS SOME NAMED ENTITY CODE TO SPARE
AND JUST LIKE AT LEAST FOR THE FOR SORT OF FOR FINDING TOPICS TITLES FOR FOR SEGMENTS
BUT LIKE ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE SPARSE PROBABLY INDIVIDUAL NAMED ENTITIES WHICH DESCRIBE WHAT A WHAT A SEGMENT IS ABOUT WOULD PROBABLY BE QUITE GOOD
SO YOU'RE DOING THAT ON A ON A PER WORD LEVEL
BUT IT'S JUST DONE OFF LINE AND EVERYONE CAN HA REPRESENT IT ANYWAY THEY WANT AS LONG AS THEY SORT OF STORE IT IN A USEFUL X. M. L. REPRESENTATION IN THE END
YEAH I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THIS STUFF MUCH AT ALL
I'M SORT OF LIKE I THINK I'LL TAKE OVER THE DISPLAY JUST BECAUSE I'VE STARTED WITH A BIT AND FOUND IT FOUND IT DOABLE
LIKE WITH THE WITH THE BROWSER AS A WHOLE AND WHERE THE DATA COMES IN AND
I KNOW BUT UH B I GUESS WE CAN DO IT LIKE SEVERAL PEOPLE TOGETHER
YEAH OR OR READY MADE VERSIONS OF THEM FOR THAT MATTER AND
YEAH BUT I THINK ACTUALLY LIKE AT THE MOMENT THE INTEGRATION COMES FIRST I MEAN IT'S SORT OF AT THE MOMENT THE BUILDING THE BROWSER COMES FIRST
IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE TO REALLY SEE HOW MUCH THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IS MAKING SENSE BECAUSE YOU JUST WELL I GUESS YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING FROM THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL X. M. L. S FILES FILES THAT YOU CREATE
OR JUST ADAPT LIKE THEIR LIKE JUST SORT OF GO FROM THEIR SYSTEM AND AND ADAPT THAT PIECE FOR PIECE AND SEE HOW WE COULD
HOW WE COULD ARRAN LIKE ADAPT IT TO OUR
DOES ANYONE WANT TO LIKE JUST SIT WITH ME AND LIKE PLAY FOR THREE HOURS WITH NITE X. M. L. AT SOME POINT
BUT IF THERE'S ANY TIME T HMM
YOU HAVE NOTHING NO FREE TIME ON WEDNESDAY
LIKE AT THE MOMENT YOU CAN ALL DO YOUR STUFF AND I CAN DO MY L. S. A. STUFF
AND I CAN EVEN DO THE DISPLAY TO A VAST DEGREE WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THEIR SUPPLYING FRAMEWORK WORKING
YEAH I THINK WE ALL NEED THE RAW TEXT IN DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT FLAVOURS DON'T WE
YEAH WE HAVE TO PROBABLY CUT THAT OUT ANYWAY FOR OUR PROJECT I DON'T KNOW
IF NOT SURE IF IT WHAT IT DOES TO DOCUMENT IT WOULD PROBABLY MAKE THE YEAH IF IF YOU HAVE SEGMENTS FOR THAT PROBABLY THE
UH I'M JUST THINKING LIKE IT PRO IT PRO PROBABLY LIKE THE L. S. A. WOULD PERFORM QUITE WELL ON IT
YEAH I THINK IT'S IT THE IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WANTED TO CHECK OUT HOW WELL THEY WERE DOING WITH OVERLAPPING AND STUFF
BECAUSE BASICALLY IT'S LIKE THEY'RE READING THEM AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS BUT YOU KNOW IN WHICH ORDER THEY ARE SAID
UM DAVE IF YOU WOULD OR ACTUALLY FOR WELL IF YOU'RE DOING I. D. F. S OR YOU WHATEVER YOU CALL YOUR YOUR FREQUENCIES I ALWAYS MIX UP THE NAME
LIKE YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME REPRESENTATION OF A WORD AS NOT NOT THAT SPECIFIC OCCURRENCE OF THAT WORD TOKEN BUT OF OF OF A GIVEN WORD FORM
DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE O THE ORD
DOES SOMEBODY WO WHO WAS IT OF YOU TWO WHO SAID THAT UM THERE'S SOME PROGRAMME WHICH SPITS OUT A DICTIONARY PROBABLY WITH FREQUENCIES
IS ANYONE OF YOU FOR THE FOR THE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY OVER TOTAL FREQUENCY YOU GONNA HAVE TOTAL FREQUENCIES OF WORDS THEN WITH THAT RIGHT
W USING WHICH TOOL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
LIKE MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE BRITISH NATIONAL CORPUS WAS THAT THERE'S FAR MORE WORD TYPES THAN YOU EVER THINK BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT'S SORT OF UNUSUAL GENERALLY IS A NEW WORD TYPE
AND ALSO ANY NUMBER AS A WORD TYPE OF ITS OWN
SO GENERALLY DICTIONARIES CAN GROW BIGGER THEN YOU THINK THEY DO
THEN SKIP IT BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WITH A DOT IN BETWEEN WHICH IS USUALLY NOT SOMETHING YOU WANNA HAVE AND
SO WE NEED LIKE SEVERAL OF US NEED A DICTIONARY
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NEEDS IT WITH FREQUENCIES
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NEEDS IT WITH FREQUENCIES
WE CAN PROBABLY JUST START WITH THE JAVA HASH MAP AND LIKE JUST HASH MAP OVER IT AND SEE HOW FAR WE GET
I MEAN WE CAN PROBABLY ON A MACHINE WITH A FEW HUNDRED MEGABYTE RAM YOU CAN GO QUITE FAR
OH YEAH BURNING IT ON A LIKE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BURN THE WHOLE CORPUS JUST THE X. HMM
AH I SEE I ASKED SUPPORT ABOUT THAT TWO DAYS AGO
SO IF IT'S FROM S WELL ACTUALLY I THINK IF IT'S MOUNTED YOU CAN DIRECTLY BURN FROM THERE
NO YOU YOU WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT AT I DON'T THINK IT WAS I DON'T THINK IT WAS A GIGABYTE
SEE I WOULD OFF I WOULD OFFER YOU TO TO GET IT ON THIS ONE AND THEN UM LIKE COPY IT
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THE WAY HOW THEY ACCESS THE HARD DISK HOW THEY MOUNT IT WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE
WH WHAT CONNECTION DO YOU HAVE AT HOME
SO IF ANYONE OF US GETS IT WE CAN THEN JUST USE AN EXT HMM
YEAH BURN IT TO C. D. OR YEAH PUT IT ON ON HARD DISK WHATEVER
AH YEAH BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE TEMP DIRECTORY OFF THE MACHINE YOU CAN S. S. H. INTO DIRECTORY OF S. S. H.
SORRY IF THIS IS BORING EVERYBODY ELSE
I CAN PROBABLY JUST IMPLEMENT LIKE A FIVE LINE JAVA HASH TABLE FREQUENCY DICTIONARY BUILDER AND SEE
OH DID YOU NOT SAY FREQUENCIES F OF WORDS IN THE WHOLE SORRY DID UH
OH YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE DIFFERENT COUNTS FOR EACH CHUNK BUT JUST LIKE SORT OF FOR FOR SOMETHING FROM OLD CHUNKS
SO ONCE I WRITE AN AR LIKE W IF I WRITE LIKE AN ALGORITHM WHICH DOES A HASH UM TABLE DICTIONARY WITH FREQUENCY FROM A RAW TEXT
SO HOW FAR ARE WE G UH HOW F HOW FAR ARE YOU GETTING RAW TEXT OUT OF IT DO YOU THINK
WELL I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE A LOT IN COMMON WHAT WE CALCULATE BECAUSE I FOR MY LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS NEED LIKE COUNTS OF WORDS WITHIN A DOCUMENT
OH SO THAT'S WHAT F RAINBOW DOES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT L. S. A. BUILDS ON
LIKE IT BUILDS A F A DOCUMENT BY FREQUENCY MATRIX
IT MORE AND MORE APPEARS TO ME THAT IF WE IF WE SCRAP THE NOTION OF THE MEETING AS AN INDIVIDUAL THING AND SORT OF JU SEE MEETINGS AS AS TOPIC SEGMENTS AND HAVE SORT OF LIKE HIERARCHICAL TOPIC SEGMENTATION INSTEAD
THEN IT'S B LIKE A MORE COHERENT FRAMEWORK
WAIT ARE WE ARE WE USING THIS UM FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE DO FOR THE WEIGHTING IN THE END NOW THIS THIS MEASURE YOU'RE CALCULATING
BECAUSE IF WE'RE DOING LIKE I THINK FOR FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY WE UH WE SHOULD CALCULATE IT ON THE LOWEST LEVEL NOT ON THE HIGHEST
YEAH BUT W IT DON'T YOU HAVE TO LIKE GO SORT OF LIKE FOR IN A DOCUMENT VERSUS THE WHOLE THING
ISN'T THAT HOW IT WORKS THAT YOU C LOOK LOOK AT R
SO THAT WOULD MORE BE THE THE TOPIC SEGMENTS THEN
SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S WAYS TO ABANDON THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF OF MEETINGS AND SORT OF BUT JUST NOT REALLY TREATING SEPARATE MEETINGS AS TOO MUCH OF A SEPARATE ENTITY
I'M I'M NOT SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE M A MEETING PLUS SOMETHING ELSE I'M MORE TALKING ABOUT LIKE YEAH
AND THE SUPER TOPICS ARE IN THE END WHAT THE MEETINGS ARE BUT IN GENERAL AT SOME LEVEL SUPER TOPICS ARE TREATED LIKE LIKE TOPICS
SO THAT WOULD BE THE SERIES AS A WHOLE
THAT WOULD BE SORT OF M MEETINGS YEAH
SO SO I'LL IS TH IT LIKE IS THIS AND THIS STRUCTURALLY THEN ALWAYS IDENTICAL
I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT'S LIKE MORE THAT OH WHATEVER I'M A CAN'T THINK OF IT AT THE MOMENT
PROBABLY THIS IS ALL TOO COMPLICATED WORRYING ABOUT THAT AT THAT MOMENT ANYWAY
S WEDNESDAY WE ARE MEETING AND LOOKING AT THEIR AT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN SOME MORE DETAIL TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON
WE HAD TWO THINGS FROM THEIR STUFF JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LIKE UNDERSTAND IT WE UNDERSTAND IT ENOUGH TO TO M MODIFY IT
'KAY WHO HAS MOST FREE SPACE ON THEIR
SAME HERE
WELL WE ALTERNATIVELY WE CAN PROBABLY JUST MAKE ANOTHER DIRECTORY ON THE BEEFY SCRATCH SPACE
I MEAN THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING GIGABYTES AND GIGABYTES OF STUFF AT THE MOMENT
BUT I THINK IF HE SENDS TO THE I THINK IF HE SENDS TO THE PORT HE'D PROBABLY BE IN A BETTER POSITION
I THINK HE SAID YES TO THAT
I MEAN WE HAVE ACCESS TO IT HERE AND I GUESS IT PROBABLY MEANS THAT WE WE CAN'T GIVE IT TO ANYBODY ELSE
BUT IF THEY GIVE US ACCESS TO IT HERE O SITTING ON A DICE MACHINE
THEN THERE SHOULDN'T BE A REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE IT ON OUR LAPTOP
WHAT I JUST REALISED WE SHOULD REALLY T KEEP DIFFERENT SERIESES COMPLETELY SEPARATE FOR VIRTUALLY ALL PURPOSES
I MEAN YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN ONE SERIES
IS THE IS THE DATA ALWAYS CLEARLY SPLIT UP BY DIFFERENT SERIES
SO AT AT EVERY LEVEL EVERYONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL TO REALLY JUST TAKE EVEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL
YEAH SO SO T SO LIKE IF EVEN IF WE MAKE ONE SINGLE TEXT FILE WHICH HAS THE WHOLE CORPUS
WOU BUT IT WHAT YOU'RE PRODUCING AT THE MOMENT IS LIKE INDIVIDUAL TEXT FILES THAT SORT OF HAVE THE RAW TEXT FOR A WHOLE A MEETING AS A WHOLE OR
YEAH THA 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA NEED AS WELL
OR IS IT FOR EVERY SINGLE THING IN
IF YOU'RE INTO IT CAN YOU MAKE A TEXT FILE WHICH JUST LIKE MAKES JUST THE WORDS
'CAUSE I WOULD NEED SOMETHING THAT MARKS THE END OF UH OF UH IS IS YOURS SEGMENTED BY TOPICS THEN THAT LIKE IS THERE ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE TO THE TOPIC
TO THE AUTOMATED TOPIC TOPIC SEGMENTATION
OH THEN I NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT LATER ANYWAY
YOU'RE GONNA PUT THAT AS AN OUTPUT OF YOURS THE SEGMENTATION
OR FOR FOR THE SERIES
SO GIVE M GIVE ME DIFFERENT FILES AS LONG AS LIKE IT M IF YOU COULD NAME THEM IN A WAY THAT IS EASY TO ENUMERATE OVER THEM
IS IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S EASILY ENU LIKE TO ENUMERATE OVER
IS IT SOME JUST SOME ORDERED PATTERN
THAT IS FOR ARE WE ARE WE PICKING ONE PARTICULAR SERIES AT THE MOMENT
YEAH I GUESS WE CAN PROBABLY PROCESS THE DATA FOR ALL DIFFERENT SERIES AND THEN CHECK WHICH SERIES IS THE BEST FOR THE PRESENTATION
ADD ADD THE STRUCTURE YEAH
YEAH YEAH BUT I'M SA I'M SAYING FOR THE WHOLE THING IN THE END
OH FROM THE TIME I GET THE FILE I CAN DO THAT IN AN AFTERNOON THE NEXT SORT OF THE NEXT MORNING
OH YOU MEAN HOW LONG PROCESSING TIME IT TAKES
AH IT'S A IT'S A BOG STANDARD ALGORITHM
IT'S JUST YOU PUT THEM IN A HASH TABLE AND AND SAY WELL IF IT EXISTS ALREADY IN THE HASH TABLE THEN YOU INCREASE THE COUNT BY ONE AND I'LL PROBABLY IMPLEMENT SOME FILTER FOR FILTERING OUT NUMBERS OR SOMETHING
UH I'VE NEVER SERIALIZED ANYTHING
SO YOU WANT LIKE A SE LIKE A FILE WHICH IS THE SERIALIZATION OF A HASH TABLE
THERE'S A THERE'S A SERIALISE COMMAND SO THAT GIVES ME ONE MEGA MOTHER OF A S
YEAH BUT DO THEY AUTOMATICALLY WRITE TO THE FILE ANYWAY I'LL I'LL FIGURE THAT OUT
YES IS THAT PRETTY MUCH
SO DAVE AND ME LOOK AT HOW NITE X. M. L. WORKS AND WE'RE
I'LL BUILD A DICTIONARY AS SOON AS I GET THE TEXT
NO NO NOT DEMONSTRATE BUT LIKE DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT UH DIDN'T WE SORT OF AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE A DEMONSTRATOR OF IT
AH WELL LET'S GO
I FEEL LIKE LIKE HANGING MID AIR AND NOT REALLY LIKE FINDING A POINT WHERE YOU CAN GET YOUR TEETH INTO IT AND START WORKING PROPERLY AND SO IT'S ALL SO FUZZY THE WHOLE
LIKE WITH THE DATA STRUCTURES I'M JUST LIKE OVER THESE VAGUE IDEAS OF SOME TREES I'M F
THAT'S JUST WHAT FREAKS ME OUT
OKAY YEAH AND Y THEN I CAN MAKE FILES OF THAT
NO I DON'T KNO KNOW IT NO
I JUST I JUST NEED A A TITLE FOR THE FILE BUT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT IS
SO UH WE HAVE THEN WHEN WE ARE MIXING OUR UM VALUES TOGETHER IS IT UM A VALUE FOR EACH UM EXPRESSION FOR EACH SENTENCE OR SOMETHING
UH YEAH
SO WHAT WE WHAT WE WOULD FIT IN INTO THE XML FILES WOULD IT BE UH UM A VALUE FOR EACH UTTERANCE
FOR ALL THOSE THAT POINT TO THE ACTUAL WORDS
SO YOU MEAN AN A AN ATTRIBUTE
BUT THEY DISPLAY THE SEGMENTS IN OR THAT THE UTTERANCES I IN THEIR UM
USER INTERFACE AS WELL WHERE THE WORDS ARE Y UM DISPLAYED
SO SO THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR UTTERANCES DISPLAYED IN THEIR INTERFACE
UH
YEAH THE PROBLEM IS PROBABLY THAT UM I EXTRACT ALL THE WORDS AND THEN UH I DON'T UM USE AN I. D. OR SOMETHING FOR IT
UM WOULD YOU THINK IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO JUST TAKE UM FILE FILES BY SPEAKER
IT'S IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT INPUT I GIVE TO UM TO RAINBOW
SO I JUST COULD G USE THE FILES AS THEY ARE
BUT YEAH IT'S IT'S S STRANGE
BUT I UM IF THE ORDER STAYS THE SAME IT'S NO PROBLEM AT ALL TO I JUST WRITE BACK AGAIN
BUT IF UH IT'S ORDERED BY INFORMATION GAIN I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WORDS COME FROM BECAUSE IT'S IT HAS A BAG OF WORDS REPRESENTATION
UH YES
IS IT IS
AND IF YOU GET A NEW DOCUMENT IT WILL UM COMPARE WHICH WORDS ARE IN THAT NEW DOCUMENT
IT WILL ASSIGN IT TO THAT CATEGORY AND IF IT'S TYPICAL FOR ANOTHER ONE IT WILL ASSIGN IT TO THAT ONE
YEAH IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE UM Y UM YOU HAVE UM OTH DIFFERENT FILES
IF IF THIS IS YOUR DIRECTORY YOU HAVE UM UM A DIAGRA UM A DIRECTORY ONE TWO AND THREE
EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THERE IS IN CATEGORY ONE
UM EACH MEETING AND I JUST PUT ONE IN EACH CATEGORY
SO UH IT'S IT'S NOT VERY SENSIBLE AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE I'M WAITING FOR THE UM TOPIC SEGMENTS OR I'M JUST YEAH
YEAH MAYBE IT'S IT'S BETTER IF I WRITE IT MYSELF BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S TOO EASY TO JUST SPLIT THINGS UP INTO BINS
YEAH BUT THAT'S THE SA UH ALMOST I THINK SIMILAR TO WHAT I'M DOING BECAUSE WORDS THAT ARE IN EVERY CLASS
THAT ARE NOT VERY INFORMATIVE BUT WORDS THAT ARE ONLY IN ONE CLASS ARE ARE VERY INFORMATIVE FOR THAT CLASS
YEAH THAT'S TH YEAH
BUT IN THAT CATEGORY IT WOULD HAVE THE SAME VALUE AT EACH PLACE
UM THAT WOULD BE BEST BUT I I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK IF THAT
OH NO I LI I TH I THOUGHT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE D UM WE JUST SPLIT I NEED SOMEWHERE TO SPLIT
SO IF YOU HAVE JUST ONE DOCUMENT IN EACH CATEGORY AND THERE ARE A LOT OF UM OCCURRENCES OF THE WORD THE IN EACH ONE
SO IT SHOULD WORK FOR ONE BUT I'M NOT SURE IF HOW EXACTLY IT IT UM CALCULATES EVERYTHING
UH I THINK IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO LOOK THAT UP
YEAH BUT HOW CAN WE GET TO KNOW WHAT MAKES SENSE AS A A FUNCTION FOR JOINING EVERYTHING TOGETHER
MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO FIND THAT OUT
WE COULD EVEN YEAH WE COULD EVEN HAVE A LOOK AT OUR DIFFERENT MEASURES IF THEY UM
IT'S STATED FROM WHERE TO WHERE THE SEGMENTS GO
SO YEAH THAT'S QUITE EASY BECAUSE IT'S IT'S AN ATTRIBUTE AND YOU JUST S SAY THAT YOU WANT THE VALUES OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES
IS LAUGHTER ANNOTATED AT ALL
BECAUSE YOU COULD TAKE THAT ON OURS OUT MAYBE
OH I DON'T KNOW
SO UH NO HOW ABOUT THE THE PROTOTYPE
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD BE M I MEAN UH FOR ME IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO SAY O ON
I THINK IT WOULD WORK BEST WITH UTTERANCES OR SEGMENTS
I THINK JUST THE SEGMENTS AS THEY'RE SEGMENTED IN THE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE POINT SE POINT SIX FIVE
AND YOU WOULD S PROBABLY STILL NEED UM YOUR VALUES FOR THE WORDS UM PERHAPS FOR FOR UM THE KEYWORDS THAT ARE DISPLAYED
YEAH BUT THAT'S ANOTHER REPRESENTATION THEN I THINK F FOR THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE
UM PO
IT'S UM FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S UH B. D. B. O. O. ONE C. POINT SIX
OKAY SO HERE THERE'S FOR UM EACH SEGMENT UM UH THAT'S REALLY ALL SEGMENTS I MEAN IT'S IT CAN BE WORDS OR TOPICS OR UM ANYTHING I THINK
UM THAT'S WHY TH IT'S FOR EXAMPLE TIME PROVENANCE DIALOGUE ACT OR TIME PROVENANCE SEGMENT OR TIME PROVENANCE
YEAH IT P OH WELL SOME OF THEM POINT TO THE WORDS OTHER OTHERS POINT TO THE UM DIALOGUE ACTS
THE SEGMENT IS WHAT IS DISPLAYED IN ONE LINE UM BY NITE
YEAH IT LOOKS UH UH THE SEGMENT THING LOOKS IN THE INTO THE WORDS X. M. L. FILE AND THE DIALOGUE ACTS
NO THEIR THEIR ANNOTATION OF DIALOGUE ACTS
AND ONE UM SEGMENT CAN HAVE OR ONE UM OF THOSE WORD STRINGS THAT ARE PRESENTED IN ONE LINE CAN HAVE SEVERAL UM DIALOGUE ACTS ANNOTATED ON IT
BUT I THINK THESE SEGMENTS ARE PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST O ONE TYING ALL THE OTHERS TOGETHER
AND THE INFORMATION OR R I MEAN WE ARE GOING TO CREATE A FILE THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE UM THE WORDS FILE
YEAH THAT'S THERE NO NO UP UP
YOU AND THE SPEAKER D.
YEAH I THINK WE WOULD ALSO NEED TWO OF THOSE
YEAH I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURE ONE THAT POINTS TO IT WHERE WE TIE TOGETHER ALL OUR INFORMATION
YOU CAN'T REPRESENT THEM ON THE SAME FILE
YEAH IN SEGMENT POINT ONE
UM YOU KNOW TO
BECAUSE OTHERWISE IN THE IN THE OTHER THINGS THERE IS NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE PARTICIPANT NAME IS AND SO ON
I MEAN THAT WOULD BE NO PROBLEM
BUT UM FOR MY SEGMENTS WERE THE UM F. ZERO MEASUREMENTS AND ALL THOSE VALUES I GET FROM THERE
UM I ALWAYS STORE THE BEG UH START AND END TIME OF EVERYTHING I CALCULATED THERE SO I WOULD JUST HAVE TO PU PUT IT UH YES
UH ACTU BUT ACTUALLY MY SEGMENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME AS THEIR SEGMENTS BECAUSE AND THEIR SEGMENTS THERE ARE UM PAUSE UM PAUSES SOMETIMES
I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE SAME THING AS I GAVE YEAH AS I GAVE TO YOU
BECAUSE IT WOULD THEN SAY HOW IT FIND THAT IT'S THAT SPEAKER
OR OR VALUE YEAH
BECAUSE I MEAN THE THE WORDS WE'RE LOOK REALLY LOOKING FOR APPEAR NOT TOO OFTEN
EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE ALL THE OTHER SAME TOPICS WHERE IT DOESN'T OCCUR
SO WOULD IT BE HIGHER SCORED THAN A WORD THAT UM OCCURS
IN
EVERY UM SEQUENCE OF THE SAME TOPIC
YEAH I MEAN UM WE HAVE UH S UH OUR SEVERAL TOPICS
AH
AND THEY THEY ARE NOT RELATED THEN TO OTHER BLOCKS OF
UM THE HIS INFORMATION THEN BE USEFUL FOR IN R RAINBOW
UM I THOUGHT THE POINT ABOUT THAT WAS THAT WE WOULD PUT UM INTO S UM SERIAL CATEGORIES ALL THE SEGMENTS OF THE SAME TOPIC ACROSS MEETINGS
YEAH I MEAN I HAVEN'T REALLY DECIDED ON UH HOW TO REALLY GET THE INFORMATION OUT OF THIS NOW
BUT I COULD GIVE UM THE INFORMATION ABOUT YEAH HOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS
YEAH BUT THEN OKAY BUT TH AT THAT MOMENT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO JUST MAKE IT ON A PER SEGMENT BASIS RIGHT WAY
AND LET HER ADAPT IT ALSO TO THE SEGMENT BASIS
SOMETIMES THEY'RE TWO SEGMENTS AND ONE WITH A GAP IN BETWEEN BUT UM THE HAVE UM TH TH THEY DON'T OVERLAP
THEY'RE I MEAN MY SEGMENTS OVERLAP IN THE SAME WAY AS THEIRS DO
BUT SOMETIMES I HAVE UM SPLIT ONE OF THE SEGMENTS INTO TWO SEGMENTS BUT IT'S EASY TO MATCH THE START AND END TIMES TO MAP IT TO THEIR SEGMENTS
I UH HOPE SO YEAH
YEAH I MEAN THAT'S WHAT I'M ALREADY DOING WITH MY S UH SEPARATE
YEAH IT'S TELLS YOU EVEN WHICH WORDS IT IS
I MEAN PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE OF LAUGHTER OR SOMETHING THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING BUT I DIDN'T HAVE
BUT UH AR YEAH
BECAUSE UM YEAH M I MEAN WE HAVE SEVENTY FIVE HOURS PER YEAH
YEAH WHAT I DID AT THE MOMENT IS UM I UM YEAH I GOT THE F. ZERO VALUES FROM FOR EACH SPEAKER FOR HIS HEADPHONE
AND I ONLY TAKE THOSE UM THE W UH THAT WERE RECORDED AT THE TIME WHERE HE WAS ACTUALLY SPEAKING
AND FOR THOSE I CALCULATED UM THE AVERAGE
SO THAT GAVE ME UM NOW ONE VALUE PER SPEAKER PER MEETING
YES I MEAN I R JUST UH NEEDED TO HAVE THIS VALUE NOW TO RELATE UM M HOW YEAH
UM AMUSEMENT AND SO ON IS YEAH
YEAH SURE BUT
YEAH AND I AM AT THE MOMENT FIDDLING AROUND WITH MY DATA AND NOT QUITE SEEING HOW I GET TO A SENSIBLE ABSTRACTION LEVEL YOU KNOW
IT'S GOT DELIMITERS IN BETWEEN THE MAR THE BOUNDARIES
BUT I MEAN THE MOST I CA YOU DON'T NEED A ONE
WELL I COULD GIVE YOU AN I. D. BUT IT'D BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY GIVE A TOPIC A TITLE
UM IS IT NOT SEGMENTS
N NO IT JUST POINTS TO THE TO THE WORDS
THE I SUPPOSE SO THE UTTERANCES
OH I'M SURE IT'D BE QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD SOME OF THE TASKS WE HAVE TO DO
BUT YET NO ONE REALLY UNDERSTANDS THEM THE ACTUAL X. M. L. PARSING
AH SOD THAT
DA
IT'S YEAH I NEVER GET THIS SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF IF THIS IS STRAPLESS IF THIS STRAP'S SUPPOSED TO GO BEHIND M I OBVIOUSLY DOING THIS WRONG
OBVIOUSLY FAILING THIS LIKE WHATEV CALLING CENTRE AND TRA
YES SO UM ACTUALLY I JUST REALISE I DON'T HAVE POWER LET ME JUST SWITCH ON THE OTHER WHICH IS GONNA RUN OUT
SO WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING IS MAYBE IF WE TRY TO REALLY MAKE SENSE TOGETHER OF THE X. M. L. FORMAT TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN ALL PRODUCE THE DATA THAT WE ARE PRODUCING IN A WAY OR AT LEAST I MEAN I GUESS MY DATA I'LL PROBABLY LOAD IN FROM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY ANYWAY BECAUSE IT'S MATRIX
UM WHAT I DID JUST NOW IS I DOWNLOADED
FILES
OR BUT I DON'T R I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN IDEA LIKE WHAT OTHER WORDS WHAT WE WOULD DO TODAY IN THIS MEETING
YES SO DOES ANYONE HAVE A GOOD IDEA WHERE TO START LIKE WHICH WHAT SO WHAT IS IT WE TALK ABOUT GETTING IN AT THE MOMENT
WE'RE BASICALLY JUST 'CAUSE THE TWO OF YOU WILL MERGE YOUR DATA TOGETHER RIGHT
SO THE ONLY THING WE'RE TRYING TO TIE IN IS JUST AN ADDITIONAL ANNOTATION WHICH IS SIMILAR TO
THE ANNOTATION ABOUT WHAT WHAT WOULD IT BE S MOST SIMILAR TO
I'M NOT SURE IT AH
SEE THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING
NOT SURE WHAT SOFTWARE I HAVE AT THE MOMENT WHICH WOULD BE HELLO
YOU KNOW WHA WHA EACH TURN SO IF WE
SO D
IS IS CALLED IS THAT
IS IT
WHAT DOES IT END WITH
DOES IT WITH WITH SAX
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IT
LET'S ACTUALLY JUST SEE IF MAYBE K. RIGHT
OH THIS IS HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND JUST GETTING THE RIGHT SOFTWARE GOING
IS THAT BETTER TO SEE
I GUESS YEAH WHITE AND BLACK IS BETTER TO SEE
SO JUST SEE IF I CAN VIEW
NO BUT W LIKE UH SO THEY ARE THEY ARE SEGMENTS IN WHAT SENSE
SO IS THAT JUST ANOTHER REPRESENTATION OF TEXT
JUST SEE CAN WE HAVE THIS FILES SOMEWHERE
SO LET'S FOR EXAMPLE LOOK AT
OKAY LET ME JUST TRY TO GET THEM ALL TO A DIFFERENT SCREEN
UH UH IS THAT WHAT WE WERE
SORRY I'M JUST I'M TRYING TO ARRANGE THEM SO THAT WE HAVE ONE ABOVE THE OTHER SO TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF THAT
UM I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS SEGMENTS FILE IS ABOUT
TO A CERTAIN POSITION IN THE IN THE WORDS FILE
SO IT'S THAT NON VOCAL SOUND ONE HERE
BUT WHAT'S THE DOES IT ALWAYS JUST OH NO IT'S IT'S REFERENCING TO SEVERAL WORD STRUCTURES
ARE THEY NOT ORDERED OR OH YEAH FROM W. FIFTY TWO DOWN TO W. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
SO THIS SO THIS IS SOMEBODY SAYING IT IT DOESN'T
SORRY IN SPEAKER D. 'S FILE
AND THEN IT ONLY STARTS AT A LATER TIME BECAUSE OH YOU DON'T SEE WHEN I'M POINTING AT SCREEN IT'S JUST FOR THIS
WOULD THAT BE LIKE THE SEGMENTS FILE GIVING A START WORD AND END WORD OR OR WOULD THAT
SEGMENT IN HERE ATTACHES ACTUALLY CAN WE NOT TIE IT TO THE SEGMENTS FILE
WOULD THAT NOT BE THE WAY HOW THEY WOULD WANT IT TO HAVE TO DO AS IF WE IN THE END
YEAH SO WOULDN'T IT I MEAN THE PROBLEM IS THEY'VE ME HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE EXACT INNER WORKINGS OF THEIR OF THEIR ENGINEERED
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WANTING TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT X. M. L. FILES WITH ONE THE REFERENCE AND ONE JUST TH JUST THE NUMBER
WHICH IS REFERENCING TO THESE SEGMENTS HERE AND ANOTHER ATTRIBUTE WHICH IS THE THE VALUE
SO THIS WHOLE INFORMATION WE WOULD THEN STORE IN THIS AH NO
SO WE WOULD ADD THAT TO THAT FILE
SAYING THAT SORT OF WE BRING IN INFORMATION DENSITY
AND THEN WE WOULD CREATE THE FILE OF THAT TYPE WHICH WE PROBABLY COULDN'T CALL IT SEGMENT
SO MAYBE IF WE G IF WE GO AHEAD
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO AN LIKE SOMETHING LIKE SEGMENTS OR MAYBE JUST A COPY OF SEGMENT WHICH HAS AN ATTRIBUTE FOR FOR EACH SEGMENT
WOULD IT BE EASIER THOUGH BECAUSE ALL YOUR METHODS ARE SORT OF NOT WORKING WITH THEIR WHOLE TIME FRAME STRUCTURE THERE
SO WOULD IT BE EASY FOR YOU TO TO TIE THE THINGS TOGETHER
LIKE IF YOU'RE DOING IT ON ON THE WORD BASIS HERE WITH THOSE WORDS THAT IN THE END YOU THEN TIE IT BACK IN INTO THE RIGHT SEGMENT HERE
SO THIS ISN'T DIRECTLY HAVING TIME REFERENCES BUT YOU CAN GET THE OH IT IS ACTUALLY HERE
THIS PROBABLY WOULD BE A LOT EASIER WOULD I REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE HANDLING THE DATA INTERNALLY 'CAUSE THEN WE C THEN I COULD SAY OH
IT'S EASY TO JUST TIE IT IN IF YOU JUST HAVE IT TIME STAMPED THAT JUST REFERENCE BY WORDS AND STUFF
BUT T AT THE MOMENT
IT BE D DEPENDS ON THE POSITION
OH BUT THIS IS BY SPEAKER HERE WHICH MAKES IT SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT
IF YOU IF YOU ALREADY HAVE YOU HAVE IN THE RIGHT ORDER ALL THE WORDS WITH A WITH A SCORE TO THEM
SO THOSE TWO TIED TOGETHER HAVE EACH WORD AND ITS TIME AND
'CAUSE IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S JUST IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT IN IN D MANY ASPECTS
AND W
IN I IN THE T IN THE TOPICS IN THE IN THE HUMAN TOPIC S UM SO YOU'VE SPLIT THEM UP BY TOPIC AT THE MOMENT
THE ENTROPY CALCULATION IS THAT SHE BOXED IT UNDER THE SIMPLE CALCULATION THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY WRITE THE SCRIPT IN NO TIME AT ALL AND
I CAN JUST LIKE K K I CAN SIT TOGETHER WITH YOU FOR TWENTY MINUTES AND JUST SHOW YOU THE ENTROPY CODE THAT I WROTE FOR MY OTHER PROJECT AND IT PROBABLY AND WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S WE USED T WE HAVE TO WE'D USE THE SAME MATRIX AS I'M USING IN MY LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
SO IN THAT SENSE IT'S DOING SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT
AND LIKE W BASICALLY THE SCORE THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS A CONDITIONAL ENTROPY SCORE WHICH JUST CHECKS HOW MUCH INFORMATION
I THINK THE OFFICIAL LE SORT OF THE OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IT TELLS YOU IS UM HOW MUCH THAT LIKE THE FACT THAT A GIVEN WORD OCCURS TELLS YOU ABOUT WHAT'S THE NEXT WORD'S GONNA BE
BUT IT IT JUST WORKS OUT IN THE WAY THAT WORDS WHICH ARE PROMISCUOUS AND WHICH OCCUR WITH EVERYTHING ALL OVER THE PLACE HAVE VERY LOW A SCORES ON THAT
AND ALSO USUALLY END UP BEING THE WORDS WHICH ARE P
YEAH FUNCTION WORDS OR JUST VERY GENERAL NOUNS
PR PROBABLY LIKE WHAT WHATEV FOR EXAMPLE THE WORD COMPUTER IN THAT CONTEXT
YOU COULD IMAGINE IT TO F LIKE BE IN ALL IN ALL THE CONTEXTS
YEAH SO WE WOULD WE W WOULDN'T DO IT BY WORD WE WOULD SORRY OKAY
UM I WAS I WAS GETTING THAT W ACTUALLY SORRY I WAS GETTING THAT WRONG I WAS GETTING IT FROM WHAT I DID MY PROJECT
NOW IN THIS CASE WE WOULD DO IT BY PER MEE WORDS PER MEETING
BUT I'M JUST SAYING LIKE WITH THAT THING YOU WOULD EASILY HAVE AN ALGORITHM WHICH AT THE MOMENT PROVIDES YOU FOR EACH WORD WITH A SCORE WHICH WE CAN USE
UM NO UM I WAS I WAS I WAS DESCRIBING THE WRONG THING
IN THIS CASE WE WOULDN'T BE DOING HOW MUCH IT TELLS YOU ABOUT ANOTHER WORD
IN THIS CASE WE WOULD BE DOING GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW A WORD HOW GOOD IS IT AT PREDICTING FROM WHICH UM SPECIFIC TOPIC THAT WAS
BUT BUT YOUR CATEGORY THING DEPENDS ON THAT WE NOT JUST HAVE TOPIC SEGMENTS BUT ALSO THAT THESE TOPIC SEGMENTS WE HAVE THEM IN CATEGORIES
OR SEVERAL SEGMENTS FOR EACH CATEGORY
DO BUT WILL IT WORD WITHOUT THAT AT ALL
YEAH I MEAN S SO IN OUR CASE BASICALLY EVERY
BUT WHAT I'M REALLY LIKE BECAUSE THE ENTROPICAL UM CALCULATION IS SO SIMPLE MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK INTO MAKING THAT SCORE JUST AS A PRELIMINARY SCORE THAT WE HAVE
IT GIVES YOU BASICALLY SOMETHING IN THE END WHICH VAGUELY TELLS YOU JUST WHETHER A WORD IS A VERY SPECIFIC WORD
YEAH IN IN A SENSE I MEAN THIS IS A BIT LIKE THE WHAT LIKE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY OVER TOTAL FREQUENCY
WITHIN TH WITHIN THE TOPIC SO LIKE TOPIC WE HAD TO WHEN YOU SAY TOPIC
WELL I'M I'M DOING ONE ON SEGMENT SIMILARITY IN THE END YEAH
IT'S ONLY LIKE I'M WRITING AN ALGORITHM THAT WHICH THEN TRIES TO ALSO AGAIN BASED ON WORD P OCCURRENCE PATTERNS TRY TO LINK TOGETHER MAYBE DIFFERENT ONES OF THOSE
YOU KNOW WHAT AS A BYPRODUCT OF MY L. S. A. I'LL PROVIDE UM A VOCABULARY LIKE SORT OF A DICTIONARY WHICH FOR EACH WORD GIVES AN ENTROPY SCORE ENTROPY SCORE
BUT JUST LIKE HOW MUCH THIS WORD TELLS YOU ABOUT WH HOW LIKELY THAT W THE OCCURRENCE OF THAT WORD MAKES IT THAT IT'S A SPECIFIC SEGMENT TOPIC SEGMENT
WHICH IS SOME MEASURE ALREADY OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS WORD IS VERSUS HOW SPECIFIC F TO A CERTAIN SEGMENT THAT IS
AND I'LL JUST PROVIDE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST NOT MUCH MORE WORK THAN JUST THE USUAL THING
AND THEN WE CAN SEE HOW WE CAN TIE THAT IN WITH THE OTHER STUFF
SO IF YOU UM KEEP ON WORKING ON RAINBOW MEANWHILE AND TRY TO FIND A WAY HOW TO TIE YOUR RAINBOW STUFF INTO
SOME WAY THAT WE CAN ATTACH IT TO A CERTAIN TIME SEGMENT
IT IT USED IS EACH WORD COMPLETELY UNIQUE LIKE SORT OF DOES IT TREAT EACH WORD EACH OCCURRENCE OF WORD AS A COMPLETELY UNIQUE EVENT
OR DOES IT I MEAN NO IT IT HAS TO I MEAN BASICALLY THE THE FORM OF THE WORD IS IMPORTANT RIGHT
BECAUSE IT LOOKS IF THE SAME WORD OCCURS AGAIN AND STUFF
YEAH IT IT HAS TO WORK WITH A M YEAH WELL I THINK IT'S A STUPID QUESTION
LIKE IT IT IT HAS TO WORK ON ON ON THE WORD LIKE ON
WHAT I WAS THINKING IS WHETHER IF WE REPLACE THE WORD BY SOMETHING UNIQUELY ID IDENTIFIABLE THEN IT WOULDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENT WHICH ORDER IT IS
IT'S THE WORD AND THAT LOOKS IF THAT WORD OCCURS AGAIN AND VERSUS HOW OFTEN THAT WORD OCCURS IN OTHER CONTEXT RIGHT
BUT WOULD IT HAVE THAT IN THE UNTRUNCATED VERSION THEN LIKE WOULD IT S WOULD THE OUTPUT BE THE UNTRUNCATED VERSION
YEAH I THINK IF WE WORK TOGETHER ON AN ON AN ENTROPY BASED SCORE
T I MEAN LET'S JUST KEEP ON TALKING MEANWHILE AND I'LL TRY TO START THAT UP
IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY D IT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING BUT IT IT BASICALLY JUST
IN A SENSE IT'S IN A IT'S IT'S BASICALLY JUST TO TO A HIGH DEGREE REALLY TELLING YOU HOW R HOW RARE A WORD IS OR HOW COMMON A WORD IS
BUT UH AS AS THE FIRST STEP THAT'S PROBABLY FOR FOR A PROTOTYPE FOR NEXT WEEK THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A BAD THING I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S JUST THAT
IF WE GET IT ON A WORD BY WORD BASIS WHATEVER YOU DO IT'LL PROBABLY APPEAR IN A WORD BY WORD BASIS
AND WHAT YOU HAVE ON A SORT OF SEGMENT BUT NOT QUITE SEGMENT BASE
BUT WHAT IF WE IF WE TAKE TIME AS THE STANDARD UNIT FOR NOW AND SORT OF LIKE MAKE A MASSIVE ONE SEGMENT SPLIT SUPER ARRAY
BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING CAN IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BE TI TIED DOWN TO ACTUAL TIME
SO IF WE IF WE IF FOR IF FOR EACH ONE SEGMENT TIME SLOT WE COULD ATTACH A VALUE
AND RE MAP THAT ONTO ONTO THE LENGTH OF A SEGMENT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
SO IF YOU HAVE FOR EACH WORD SAY AND WE KNOW THAT WORD STARTS AT THIS SEGMENT AND ENDS AT THAT SEGMENT
AND THEN WE COULD JUST IN M IN MATLAB OR IN SOMETHING JUST CREATE SOME MASSIVE SUPER ARRAY OF
WE CAN GO WITH THE SCRIPT AND SORT OF GO FOR EACH SEGMENT TO THE STARTING AND END TIMES AND SAY OKAY
THIS IS FROM OUR TIME SEGMENT F HERE TO THIS TIME SEGMENT THERE
SO WE TAKE THE SOME OF THOSE AND DIVIDE THEM BY BY THE NUMBER OR SOMETHING CREATE THE AVERAGE AND PUT IT IN AS THE VALUE FOR THE SEGMENT
THA THAT'S THAT'S A FIDDLING PLAY IN THE END BUT THAT PROBLEM WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE
LIKE RUNNING IT WITH DIFFERENT DIFFERENT FACTOR LOADINGS AND SEEING OKAY THIS WAY IT WORKS THIS WELL AND THIS WAY IT WORKS THAT WELL
BUT IT PROBABLY BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR MAPPED T TO MAP FOR YOU TO MAP IT ON SO FOR YOU SORT OF I
YEAH BUT SO YOU SAY THAT INST LIKE YOU BASICALLY SAY W HAVING AN ARRAY WHERE EACH EACH CELL IS IS ONE LIKE IS O IS ONE WORD
YOU HAVE GET ALL MULTIPLIED WITH THE SAME VALUE ALL THE ONES THAT ARE WITHIN THAT UTTERANCE
SO THAT WE BECAUSE IN THE END WE DON'T WANT IT ON A PER WORD BASIS BUT PROBABLY ON A PER SEGMENT BASE
OH YEAH YEAH ACTUALLY THAT YEAH THAT'S TRUE SO THAT IT'S EASIER IF YOU
BUT YOU SAID IT WI BUT YOU SAID IT'S MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOUR SEGMENTS AREN'T THOSE SEGMENTS EXACTLY
UH THE THO THOSE DO OR THOSE DON'T
WELL I GUESS I MEAN FOR YOU IF YOU KNOW FOR EACH WORD IF YOU FIND THAT OUT THEN IT HAS TO BE POSSIBLE
BECAUSE IF WE KNOW SORT OF THIS IS GOING FROM WORD TO WORD OR IT THIS IS GOING FROM TIME TO TIME AND THEN THERE HAS TO BE A WAY THEN FOR YOU SAY OKAY
THIS CONCERNS THESE FOLLOWING WORDS AND THEN JUST MAKE MAKE A SIMPLE MEAN OVER THEM
LIKE PLAYING AROUND WITH LOOK LIKE IT'S PLAYING WITH DIFFERENT WEIGHTINGS FOR THAT THE UTTERANCE BASED ONE VERSUS THE WORD BASED ONE AND SORT OF LOOK AT IT DYNAMICALLY
WE'D JUST PLACE THEM IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEN SEE HOW THEY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER
SO DO YOU THINK Y LIKE BOTH OF YOU THEN CAN MAP SOMETHING ONTO THEIR SEGMENTS LIKE JUST EACH OF YOU PROVIDE ONE VALUE
LIKE DOUBLE VALUE OR WHATEVER LIKE ONE DECIMAL VALUE OR WHATEVER ONTO ONTO EXACTLY THEIR SEGMENTS
UH
HOW MUCH EASIER WOULD IT BE IF WE TRULY UNDERSTOOD THIS
OF THE NITE DATA SYSTEM NOW SO THAT MAYBE AS SOON AS I'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT WE FIND WAYS OF DOING THAT IN WITHIN THE NITE FRAMEWORK ALREADY
AND IF YOU'RE BOTH ABLE TO MAP INTO THOSE SEGMENTS THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ONE FILE WHERE WE HAVE LIKE WHATEVER TWO VALUES
AND THAT WE COULD LOAD INTO A PROTOTYPE AND SEE WHAT TYPES OF DISP WHAT WAYS OF DISPLAYING THIS INFORMATION ARE THERE
THERE'S PROBABLY ALSO SOCIAL INTERACTION FACTORS IN THAT THERE'S SOMETIMES JUST A MEETING LIKE IF PEOPLE ADAPT THEIR F. ZERO TO EACH OTHER THEN THEY'RE SOMETIMES P
RI SO THE AVERAGE
SO THAT WOULD SHOW YOU HOW MUCH RELATIVE TO HOW HE SORT OF HOW HE'S PERFORMING GENERALLY IN THAT MEETING RELATIVE TO THAT HOW HE'S IN A SPECIFIC SEGMENT
HE OR SHE
UH
OH THEY W THEY DO EXIST
OH WELL
SEE AS SOON AS AS SOON AS I'M HALFWAY THROUGH MY L. S. A. LIKE BASICALLY AS SOON AS I HAVE THE THE MATRIX BUILT
IF OF THE DOCUMENT BY WORD STUFF IT'S VERY EASY TO THEN CALCULATE FOR EACH WORD A SCORE
YEAH I THINK COLIN DAVE AND ME WILL ACTUALLY WORK ON ON THE JAVA STUFF
AND IT AND WE'LL JUST SEE WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOU SUPPLY US WE'LL TRY TO TIE IN AND VISUALISE IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER
UM I'LL ASK JONATHAN IF WE CAN POSTPONE THE MEETING TO ONE O'CLOCK
I'M NOT SURE IF I'M SUPPOSED TO EXPECT A CONFIRMATION FOR MY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM NOW OR BUT I'LL JUST EMAIL HIM AGAIN AND S ASK HIM IF WE CAN MAYBE MAKE IT ONE SORRY
AND IT'S A BIT TOO FAR INTO THE MEETING FOR THAT AND INTO THE PROJECT FOR THAT
I GUESS AS SOON AS WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK IN THE W IN THE TYPE OF THE PROTOTYPE WHERE LIKE SORT OF EACH OF US CAN TIE IN THEIR STUFF AND SEE WHAT IT L HOW HOW IT LOOKS LIKE AND HOW IT PERFORMS
THAT PROBABLY MAKES IT A LOT EASIER THEN BUT IT'S SORT OF IT'S A BOOT STRAPPING PROBLEM LIKE FOR THE PROTOTYPE WE NEED SOME TYPE OF DATA
SORT OF LIKE IF BASICALLY IF WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS SEGMENTS FILE BUT FOR EACH OF YOU LIKE JUST HAVE ONE ATTRIBUTE
BECAUSE THEN WE CAN EASILY D DISPLAY THEM INDIVIDUALLY C CONTRAST THEM TO EACH OTHER AND PLAY AROUND WITH HOW Y TO COMBINE THEM
HOW Y HOW DO YOU DO THE SUMMARY
IS IT
SO ARE YOU BASING IT ON CERTAIN THRESHOLDS UH OVER A SPECIAL D UH S OKAY
MAYBE THEY HAVE GOT UM THE MINUS IN THE CODE AS WELL AND THEN SOMETHING IN IS MESSED UP
AND THE AREA COULD BE SMALLER
YEAH AS SOON AS I'VE FINISHED ALL THE MEETINGS I THINK THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH TO DO UNLESS I GET SOME EVALUATION METHOD
YEAH HE'S REALLY KEEN ON THAT ISN'T HE
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THAT N YEAH IT MIGHT BE OF HELP
UH YEAH F PER UTTERAN UH I PRINT THE UTTERANCES IN THE I. D.
UH NO THE THE I. D. OF THE UTTERANCE AND UH THE MEASURE I THINK
IF I JUST TAKE WELL M A FILE OR WHERE ONE MEETING IS IN OR
IS THAT WHAT V WHAT YOU'VE GOT BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THE DIFFERENT MEETING SERIES OVERLAP
BUT WE HAVE GOT THE INDEX UM FOR CONVERTING FROM VERA'S I. D. S TO TO YOURS
HAVE YOU GOT THAT FOR NO IT'S JUST FOR ONE MEETING AT THE MOMENT
SO WHAT KIND OF CHANGE WILL YOU IMPOSE ON THE SUMMARISATION
SO YOU AT THE MOMENT YOU HAVE GOT A THRESHOLD AND EVERYTHING THAT'S ABOVE IT IS DISPLAYED
OR HOW DO YOU D
AH YEAH
AH HA
I THINK THOSE S. S AND E. S AND SO ON THE SINGLE LETTERS ARE BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WITH MY UM FIRST VERSION OF THE TEXT THING
OTHERWISE YOU GO IN TOO SLOWLY YEAH
UM UH SORRY THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE FIRST MEETING IS FOR EX THAT THERE'S NO UM A HOT SPOT ANNOTATION FOR THAT
M
WHY BECAUSE UM I UM STEVE LAY QUITE A LOT OF UM WEIGHT ON UM YOU KNOW UH SURFING THROUGH MEETINGS
AT THE BEGINNING HE UM TALKED QUITE A LOT ABOUT THAT
UH OKAY
SO IT WOULDN'T BE DISPLAYED IN IN THE UH GRAPHICAL DISPLAY
UM NO
OH I I HAVE THAT FILE
YEAH BUT ALSO SPEEDING UP THE AUDIOS AND S
UH F I'M PRETTY SURE THAT I CAN UH ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO IMPROVE THERE
SO SO YOU WANT UM THE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBERS TO BE UM CONTINUOUS THROUGHOUT THE CORPUS SO THAT SECOND MEETINGS BEGINS WITH THREE HUNDRED UM SOMETHING
FOR EXAMPLE AS THERE ARE NOT UM F. ZERO VALUES FOR EVERY SPEAKER OR ON SOMETIMES NOT FOR EVERY MEETING UM HOW WILL I COUNT THAT UP
AH OKAY
AT THE MOMENT I DON'T EVEN GENERATE ANY DOCUMENT UH DOCUMENT FOR THOSE
BUT BECAUSE I MEAN IT'S NOT ZERO IT'S JUST A NOUN
BUT WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER FOR THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE IF THAT JUST WOULDN'T BE PART OF IT THEN
YEAH BUT DO WE REALLY WANT DO DISPLAY THEM SEPARATELY BECAUSE THE USER WON'T OKAY FOR NOW FOR OUR S OKAY
YEAH BUT THEN THE USER WOULD HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT S W WAS WHAT AND WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE BLUE STRIPES AND WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE RED ONES
COULDN'T WE COULDN'T WE WRITE ONE PROGRAMME THAT CALCULATES ALL THE UM F FOR ALL OUR DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE THE UM A ABSOLUTE UM DIALOGUE ACT NUMBERS FOR THE MEETING
IF YOU CONTROL CLICK AN UTTERANCE IT WILL PLAY WHERE IT SHOULD BE IN THE FILE
ARE YOU MISSING THE SOUND
OH THERE IT IS
OH THAT ONE LOOKS ALMOST COM JUST YOU NEED TO
NO IT IS ON YOUR DISPLAY
YEAH THE EASIEST THING IS IN PROGRAMME MANAGER WHERE IT MAKES THE SUMMARY
MAYBE IT WILL BE IN S THE SUMMARY CONSTRUCTOR THEN
WELL IT READS THEM INTO SEPARATE ARRAYS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST CHANGE A FLAG TO SELECT ONE I WHICH ONE IT GIVES BACK
ON MINE IT COMPLAINS ABOUT
I MEAN THAT'S QUITE TRIVIAL TO CHANGE AND WE GOT A LOT OF OTHER WORK TO DO
YEAH WE NEED TO GET ON THAT PRETTY SHORTLY I THINK
SO I THINK I'M THINKING I'LL JUST WRITE OUT A SCRIPT AND DO IT WITH A SYSTEM CALL
YEAH THE I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH WASTING TOO MUCH TIME ON IT
UM I DON'T THINK I'LL NEED THAT REALLY 'CAUSE I'LL JUST DUMP OUT A TEMPORARY FILE
I THINK WE SHOULD DECIDE WHAT WE WANT IT TO ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE IN THE END
SO OTHER THAN YEAH OTHER THAN WELL WE'LL JUST CREATE A HARD BOUNDARY IN BETWEEN EACH ONE SO YOU CAN SEE THE THING
BECAUSE I DEFINITELY THINK WE SHOULD RESTRICT IT TO I THINK WE SHOULD UM BE ABLE TO RESTRICT IT TO SPECIFIC SPEAKERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
BUT NOTHING TOO FANCY
OH I UH WELL WITH A SPEAKER I. D.
IS IT IN THE GROUP DIRECTORY
UH FROM YEAH ON THE DIALOGUE ACT LEVEL
I'VE NOT GOT IT READING IN THE TOPIC SEGMENTS YET
IF WE MOVE EVERYTHING TO THE RIGHT A LITTLE BIT AND MAKE A LITTLE BAR ON THE LEFT
OR JUST DELETE OR BACK UP IT
OH J SO I CAN PRINT OBSCENE MESSAGES IN THE BACKGROUND TO UM STANDARD OUTPUT
IT'S CAPABLE OF SLOWING DOWN THE AUDIO BUT SPEEDING UP DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK AT ALL
OH IT'S ALL PART OF THE SAME COMPONENT THAT DOES THAT
UH NO WE'D HAVE TO LOOK IN THEIR CODE AND SEE WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES
ALSO THEIR GRASP OF ALGEBRA IS TERRIBLE
BE YEAH UH
EITHER THAT OR ANOTHER
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE QUITE COOL IS IF YOU COULD UM YOU KNOW LIKE SOME APPLICATIONS WHEN YOU OPEN A FILE YOU GET LIKE A LITTLE PREVIEW
IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT DISPLAYS LIKE A FIVE LINE SUMMARY WHEN YOU YOU'RE ABOUT TO OPEN THE FILE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
ANOTHER QUITE GOOD THING MIGHT BE UM HOW ARE YOU DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT IS TO APPLY TWO TIPS TO THINGS IN JAVA
'CAUSE WHAT WOULD BE QUITE COOL IS IF ON THIS SEARCH RESULT YOU COULD GIVE IT EACH ONE A TOOL TIP THAT HAD THE CONTEXT
UM THE HEIGHT IT DOESN'T CHANGE IN VALUE DOES IT
SO IF YOU JUST REMEMBER THE COLOUR THAT IT WAS LAST AT AND YOU RE DRAW A LINE BEHIND IT OF THAT COLOUR AND THEN THE NEXT ONE
OH SO THAT'S A BIT ANNOYING 'CAUSE LIKE IT'S MY HOPE WE COULD JUST GO COBBLE SOMETHING TOGETHER AND JUST SAY LOOK IT'S GREAT
SEE I'LL PROBABLY JUST BE STARTING STUFF THEN 'CAUSE I'LL BE STARTING THE UH S. N. L. P. THING AND THE D. M. PROJECT
IS YEAH I KIND OF NICKED THE IDEA
HE WENT ABOUT CODE M. L.
UH
SEE HOW FAR I GET ANYWAY
TO SET THE PAR
DOES HIS
UH I THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO GO FOR THE WHOLE CORPUS BECAUSE THE MEET THE UM THE I. D. S GONNA HAVE GAPS AND STUFF IN THEM OTHERWISE
WELL AT THE MOMENT FROM THE DUMP FILE IT'S JUST GOT THEM UNIQUELY NUMBERED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CORPUS
AND IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO DO THAT ANYWAY BECAUSE UM THAT MEANS YOU GOT MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH HOW YOU WANT TO GROUP THEM
AND ONE THING YOU REALLY DON'T WANT IS EVER TO HAVE TWO UTTERANCES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE THE SAME I. D.
AND THOSE MIGHT NOT BE THE ONES THAT WE ENUMERATED AS ONE MEETING IN WHICH CASE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE CONFLICTING I. D. S AND THINGS LIKE THAT
WHEREAS THE DA IF YOU DO IT IN THE DATA MANAGER
I THINK IT SH EVERYTHING SHOULD BE LIKE THAT CONTINUOUS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
IF THERE'S NO VALUE I GUESS YOU HAVE TO PUT A ZERO IN
WELL IT MIGHT BE MORE SENSIBLE TO ASSIGN IT AN AVERAGE VALUE
WELL WE'D W ONLY USE F. ZERO WHEN IT WAS PRESENT THOUGH WOULDN'T WE
WE WELL WE'D WANT TO USE F. ZERO WHEN IT'S PRESENT
YOU COULD USE UM RED GREEN AND BLUE TO DISPLAY UP TO THREE
THE TROUBLE IS THAT HUE ISN'T A VERY SENSIBLE SCALE
WELL THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT CAN'T SWAP MEETINGS AT THE MOMENT IF THE DATA'S THERE FOR IT
THREE
WELL THAT'S WHAT I MEANT IS IT'S A BIT POINTLESS HAVING IT AS FILE OPEN 'CAUSE IT WILL BE OPENING THOSE FILES ALL THE TIME
IT'S MORE SENSIBLE TO HAVE IT AS AN OPTION AND THE LOCATION OF THEM
OH OF COURSE T THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T MAKE A DEVELOPMENT VERSION THAT DISPLAYS BOTH HAS TWO WIN UTTERANCE WINDOWS AND UH TWO GRAPHICAL DISPLAYS
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU IT'D HAVE TO PICK WHICH ONE TO SYNCH THE CLOCK TO
OH LIKE SAY IF YOU COULD MAKE A UM CHANGE TO YOUR THING SO IT COULD DISPLAY UH LIKE IT IN TWO HALVES
SO LIKE THE TOP HALF ONE THE BOTTOM HALF THE OTHER
OR MAYBE THREE ACTUALLY
MAYBE TOP HALF ONE BOTTOM HALF THE OTHER AND THE THIRD ONE AN AVERAGE THAT WE CAN CHANGE THE PARAMETERS FOR
AND THEN YEAH I COULD EASILY MAKE IT THROW OUT THREE DIFFERENT DIALOGUE ACTS
NO NO ONLY ONE OF THEM SYNCHS AND TWO OF THEM ARE JUST YEAH
HOW EASY WOULD IT BE TO MAKE IT SO YOU CAN ADD ARBITRARY NUMBERS OF THEM DO YOU THINK
SO YOU HAVE TO STOP IT AND START IT TO MAKE ANY EFFECT
'CAUSE LIKE WE COULD MAKE THAT NOT EVEN HAVE LIKE A A REAL SORT OF MEANING JUST PUT LIKE MAX AND MIN
BUT IT WON'T MAKE ANY HUGE CHANGES LIKE IT'LL ALWAYS HAVE THE EF THE ABILITY TO READ THE ORIGINAL ONES
LIKE JUST A WEIGHTED AVERAGE IS PROBABLY THE MOST SENSIBLE WAY TO ABOUT IT AND POSSIBLY THRESHOLDING IT
NO IT JUST TAKES THE TOP LIKE TWENTY OR FIFTY OR HOWEVER MANY
UM WELL I WAS GONNA GO TO THE GYM AT ABOUT THREE
OR TO BE HONEST LIKE IT'S MUCH QUICKER FOR ME TO GET STUFF DONE ON MY OWN
'CAUSE I'M GONNA GO AT THREE
YEAH I THINK WHAT BASICALLY WHAT I NEED AT IS UM JUST A LIST OF WORDS WITH AN INDEX TO START WITH FOR EACH MEETING
UM I SUPPOSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AS LONG AS THEY'RE UNIQUE AND IT CAN I CAN PASS 'EM BACK TO YOU AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO THE DISPLAY
YES IT'S NOT REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET IT LIKE NICE AND C CLEAN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
UM IT P IT'D PROBABLY SELECT IT YEAH
IF YEAH IF IF YOU CAN PASS ME LIKE THE DIALOGUE ACT WITH
YEAH WAS IT THE SPEAKER
IS IT SORRY COULD I D USE THAT
AT THE MOMENT IT'S READY TO LIKE GET DIALOGUE ACTS OUT WITH
IS IT
YEAH I SUPPOSE YOU COULD CALCULATE THEM OFF LINE AND JUST YEAH HAVE A LIKE LIKE A L LITTLE THUMBNAIL OR SOMETHING
IS THAT QUITE EASY TO DO TO GET UM A MOVING CURSOR
YEAH I SUPPOSE HE CAN SEE THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE WORK IN
UM I'M GONNA DO LIKE AN ON LINE MUSEUM ARCHIVE
YOU GET LIKE A DOCUMENT FOR EACH EXHIBIT
OH THAT'D BE QUITE A GOOD ONE ACTUALLY
BUT YEAH TH THAT'S THE PLAN
BUT FOR THE UTTERANCES I'VE JUST GOT ONE MEETING SO FAR
YEAH I MAY AS WELL COME AND YOU CAN SHOW ME HOW IT THE MANAGER WORKS
NO I'M JUST LIKE SORT OF LIKE PREPARING PEOPLE FOR UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE REALLY NOTHING
IT LOOKS LIKE BASICALLY LESS THAN N TH THEIR STUFF
THEN WE SHOULD FAIRLY EASILY FROM NOW GET TO A STAGE WHERE WE CAN LIKE SELECT INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS AND CLICK ON THEM
YES SURE BUT SO AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE A DIALOGUE ACT WINDOW AND A GRAPHICAL DISPLAY W I'M NOT SURE
NO THE INTERESTING THING IS THE SOUND CAME WHEN I TRIED IT LAST TIME AFTER I I TRIGGERED OFF SOMETHING BY CLICKING ON SOMETHING
YEAH THE SEGMENTS ARE MADE UP AT THE MOMENT BUT THE CODE'S THERE FOR INTEGRATING REAL SEGMENTS
CREATES AN AUDIO FILE DYNAMICALLY FROM JUST THE CHUNKS THAT WE WANNA HAVE AND THAT RUNS IN SYNCH WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN THE
SO WE SEE THAT RUNNING ALONG WITH PLAYING
OF THE MUSIC WE SEE THE THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE DIALOGUE ACTS
OKAY S
UM SHALL I JUST LOAD IT WITH JASMINE'S DATA JUST TO SEE A DIFFERENT WHERE'S THE
AM I LOOKING FOR IN DATA MANAGER
WHERE AM I LOOKING
OR IS IT F IS IT WHERE THE IS IT WHERE THE FILE NAMES ARE
IS IT HERE
IS IT UH SH IS IT HERE WHERE UM WORDS IMPORTANCE FILE
UH LET ME T
OKAY SO WH WHERE DID YOU SAY IN PROG
LIKE IN
IN THIS MAIN IN THIS ROUTINE
SO THIS SHOWS IF WE SEE ANYTHING AT ALL THEN WE SEE AT THE MOMENT AT LEAST THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY BE UM HAVING A DIFFERENT SUMMARY
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING A DIFFERENT IM UM IMPORTANT MEASURE
LIKE AT THE MOMENT I THINK THIS WAS YEAH YEAH THAT'S AN OLD OLD OLD VERSION
THEN YOU SEE IT MAKES SENSE THAT WORDS LIKE PROSODY JUST LIKE A SING IF THAT WAS THE ONLY UTTERANCE THEN THAT PROBABLY SCORED QUITE WELL AND STUFF
UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T GET THE THE BAR ON THE DISPLAY WORKING JUST YET
WE JUST NEVER BOTHERED TO UPDATE THE STUFF BECAUSE WE WERE WORKING ON SO WE SEE THAT WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT DENSITY CURVE AS WELL FOR THIS ONE
PUT A SLIDING BAR INTO THIS SO THAT PEOPLE SEE WHERE THEY ARE
SO I'M UH I'M I'M CONSTANTLY TOUCHING STUFF ON MY SCREEN I REALISE
NOW WHAT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE IS WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR LIKE HOW THE SUMMARISER WORKS
SHOULD IT ALWAYS COMPRESS A SEGMENT TO A CONSTANT LENGTH THOUGH BY A CONSTANT FACTOR OF TIME
SO ALWAYS LIKE A
'CAUSE AN AL LIKE AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW WOULD BE THAT
'CAUSE AN AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW WOULD BE THAT YOU COULD SORT OF MAKE IT THAT IT ALWAYS IS THE SAME LENGTH
SO IF YOU LIKE IF THE WHOLE MEETING IS SELECTED IT COMPRESSES THE WHOLE MEETING TO FIVE MINUTES
BUT THAT'S SORT OF THAT GIVES PEOPLE A BIT LESS CONTROL OVER SO MAYBE WE SHOULD DO IT INSTEAD THAT IT YEAH IT C IT YOU CAN SPEC
SHALL WE ABANDON THE WHOLE NOTION OF SEEING THE WHOLE M ONE WHOLE GROUP AS ONE SINGLE THING AND JUST WORK ON A P CERTAINLY FROM NOW ON PROBABLY FOR GOOD THAT MEANS
LIKE IS IT ARE YOU Y ARE YOU ALL WORKING ON THE SAME MEETING
DID ANYONE EVER CHECK IF THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD MEETING LIKE OR F COMPARABLY TO OTHERS
UH
THINK WE SHOULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT IF IT TAKES QUITE SOME TIME THAT THAT THE CLOCK DOESN'T START BEFORE OR THAT THE AUDIO AND THE CLOCK ARE IN SYNCH SORT OF
SO TH
I HAVE SOME CODE FOR SYSTEM CALLS LIKE THAT HANDLES THE IN AND THE OUTPUT IF YOU NEED SOME OF THAT
SEE THERE'S THERE'S ONE WEEK AFTER MY DISSERTATION
OR DO YOU THINK IT WILL I MEAN DO YOU THI LIKE
AS ONE MEETING YEAH
SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THE DISPLAY THAT KNOWS WHERE MEETINGS PICKING IT OVER
YES BUT APART FROM THAT WE DON'T REALLY DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT AS IF IT WAS JUST ONE MEETING
SO THE ONLY THING IT WOULD BE THAT THE DISPLAY GETS INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE AND DISPLAYS THEM AS HARD BOUNDARIES
AND THEN IN THE SAME DISPLAY WHERE WE DISPLAY THE SEARCH RESULTS FROM THE SEARCH
WHA
WELL I'M NOT SO YOU THINK DISPLAYING UH LIKE AN INFORMATION ABOUT SIMILARITY TO THE SELECT UH LIKE TO A SELECTED MEETING IN TO A SELECTED SEGMENT IN THE OTHER SEGMENTS
AND IF IT'S JUST THE SINGLE HIGHEST UM IMPORTANCE MEASURE O PHRASE OF A SEGMENT SO THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING TO DISPLAY FOR THEM
AND IT WOULD JUST BE A LIST LIKE THIS AND YOU CLICK ON ONE AND THEN W YOU THO YOU KNOW
AND THEN WE COULD LIKE WE COULD SORT OF USE THE SAME THING FOR UM YOURS AND MINE
MAYBE SE WELL MAYBE ALSO SOMETHING WHERE SOMETHING ENDS LIKE FOR MINE AND SOME STRING THAT WE PASS TO DESCRIBE WHAT LIKE WHAT IT IS
WOULD IT RETURN JUST THE SPECIFIC LIKE IT WOULD GO RIGHT TO THE UTTERANCE RIGHT
AH GOOD QUESTION
I THINK WE PROBABLY LIKE WE CAN LEAVE THOSE LIKE I. FRAMES AND JUST ARRANGE THEM SORT OF
UH APPARENTLY MICROSOFT SOMETIMES OR LIKE AT LEAST IN THE PAST THE DEMONSTRATIONS WHERE THEY JUST EXACTLY KNEW WHICH FIVE PERCENT OF THE SYSTEM WERE WORKING
THEY HAVE ALL AH
IF ANYTHING WE BUILD IN A TIME BOMB THAT ONLY FAILS IF THE DATE IS THE DATE OF THE PRESENTATION
SO IF SO SOMETHING LIKE THEIR SKIPPING WOULD IT ACTUALLY CORPORATE WITH OUR SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT
BUT I IN A SENSE I MEAN IF WE SEE UH YEAH BUT LIKE PROBABLY THAT WOULD BE THE SAME THING THAT WE ALSO DISPLAY UP HERE
BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT HAVING LIKE SOME BUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY EVEN BE SHORTER THAN FIVE LINES
LIKE REALLY JUST GETTING I THINK GETTING ONE OR TWO BEST UTTERANCES FOR EACH SEGMENT WOULD BE REALLY WORTHWHILE
TO TO APPLY WHAT
AND A TOOL TIP IS I THINK A VERY STRAIGHTF YEAH
UH I'VE NEVER SEEN TOOL TIPS DISPLAYING SEVERAL LINES AND STUFF THOUGH SO I WONDER HOW GOOD THAT'LL LOOK
WELL SO FAR ONLY SEEN TOOL TIPS OF FEW WORDS LENGTH
YOU SEE LIKE IT TAKES A FRACTION OF A SEGMENT TO DISPLAY BUT PROBABLY TOO MUCH TO UPDATE IT TO COMPLETELY REPAINT THE WHOLE THING EVERY SECOND
I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT TO DO AND JUST REPAINTING THE THING AS A WHOLE WITH A MOVING BAR THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA
WHAT I'LL JUST DO IS I'LL JUST I'LL PROBABLY NOT HAVE A MOVING BAR THE WHOLE LENGTH BUT JUST SOME INDICATOR SOMEWHERE
AND THEN I CAN JUST LIKE REPAINT A SMALL AREA OR SOMETHING
WILL WILL YOU TWO JUST UH KEEP ON WORKING ON IMPROVING THE INFORMATION DENSITY MEASURES OR DO YOU THINK THERE'LL BE A POINT WHEN YOU SAY WELL THAT'S THAT'S IT
SO OKAY WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EVALUATION L IN THE FIRST REPORT AND THERE'S NOTHING NEW WE CAN SAY ABOUT IT THIS TIME
AND I THOUGHT WE SAID THAT IN THE MEETING BEFORE WE WROTE THE REPORT
AND THEN HE CAME BACK WITH THIS WHOLE CRITICISM SAYING LIKE OH
WE SAID WE'RE NOT GONNA GO OH BUT NOW I EXPECTED IT IN MORE DETAIL AND OH
IF THAT TRANSLATES TO EIGHTY PERCENT LIKE IF IF THOSE ACTUALLY TRANSLATE TO TO REALLY LIKE THEIR PERCENTAGE SCORES THEN THAT WOULD BE GOOD
WE ALSO IT IT JUST MEANS THAT HE'S RELATIVELY LENIENT BECAUSE I MEAN THE REPORTS WERE I THINK THEY WERE OK GOOD REPORTS
SEE THE THING IS
LIKE THE WEEK JUST BEFORE THE PRESENTATION I HAVE MOST OF THE STUFF THAT I I'M DOING NOW I'M RID OF IT INCLUDING THE DISSERTATION AND DIL
SO JASMINE IF IF YOU GOT SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND LIKE THIS FOR FOR YOUR CURRENT DATA WOULD THAT HELP IN
I MEAN DAVE I IT'S A PRETTY MUCH R IT SH SHOULD BE A QUESTION OF COPYING IT OVER IT R OVER RIGHT
OR THAT W YEAH
YEAH I KNOW SURE IT J LIKE IT IT WOULD NOT NECESSARY NEED TO BE A PART OF THE FINAL THING
BUT WHY DON'T WE JUST PROVIDE SOME MEANS
FINDING THE JAVA MEDIA THE JAVA X. MEDIA STUFF ON ALL THE JARS FOR THAT
AND THEN I GOT THAT THING
YOU'RE YEAH F SO YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCING THE RIGHT FORMAT WITH THIS NO UM WITH JUST PER UTTERANCE
SO WOULD IT BE EASY SLASH DISSU DIFFICULT SLASH IMPOSSIBLE LIKE AT THE MOMENT IF WE SKIP TO A S TREATING A WHOLE SERIES AS ONE THING
NO NO N
WHEREAS UH S MAYB MAYBE WE'RE TALKING K LIKE SO SO YOUR DATA MANAGER WOULD THAT THEN HANDLE THE WHOLE THING
SO IF THE DATA MANAGER FILTERS IT OUT AND LIKE I JUST THINK THAT IN IN THE LOGIC OF THE PROGRAMME IT'S IT'S MUCH EASIER TO JUSTIFY WHY WE SAY WE TREAT A SERIES OF MEETINGS AS ONE SINGLE THING RATHER THAN W
UH BUT I SEE THIS TWO COMPLETELY G DEF LIKE I SEE EACH SER EACH GROUP IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT SHOULDN'T
DOES ANYONE HAVE A GOOD IDEA LIKE AT THE MOMENT TO PLAY AROUND WITH IT
WHAT'S A GOOD WAY OF DISPLAYING TWO TYPES OF INFORMATION IN THE IN THE COLOUR DISPLAY
I MEAN UH THERE'S PROBABLY LOGICAL WAYS LIKE IF ONE IS WHATEVER IF ONE IS THE DARKNESS AND THE OTHER IS THE REDNESS OR SOMETHING
HAS ANYONE EVER EXPERIMENTED WITH SORT OF DISPLAYING TWO DIMENSIONAL INFORMATION IN IN COLOUR
WHA WHAT'S DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THIS HUE AND SATURATION THING LIKE WHAT THAT NO NOBODY'S DONE MUCH COLOUR WORK
OKAY WELL I GUESS I'LL JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE PHOTOSHOP COLOUR CUBE OR WHATEVER IT IS GIMP COLOUR CUBE AND LOOK AT
IS THAT RIGHT DAVE
AND THAT'S UH AT THE MOMENT ARE W SO ARE WE ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT USING THAT ONE MEETING THAT EVERYONE IS USING NOW
ARE TALK ABOUT SWAT SWI SWAPPING NOW
IS ANYONE IS ANYONE PROVIDING THAT AT THE MOMENT
AS IN I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND MUCH ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DO TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS
YEAH SO IF WE EMAIL OUT A SCRIPT ON HOW TO LIKE F LOAD IT
UM SO YOURS WOULD ALWAYS LIKE YOURS WOULD ALWAYS BE LOADED IN I GUESS
LIKE YOU Y THERE WOULD ONLY BE ONE VERSION OF YOUR DATA AND YOU CAN JUST OVERRIDE THAT VERSION IF YOU WANT
BUT LIKE SO MAKE IT AN OPTION WHICH ONE IT DISPLAYS OR WHICH ONE IT USES FOR THE SUMMARISATION OR 'CAUSE IT 'CAUSE I WAS JUST THINKING SORT OF SO THAT BOTH JASMINE AND VERA COULD UM SEE THEIR DATA WORKING AND
MM IS THAT NOT GETTING TOO MUCH
FOR JASMINE AND VERA
WELL I GUESS REALLY I MEAN LIKE ALTERNATIVELY WHY DON'T WE GO FOR THE SIMPLEST THING AND JUST CREATE THREE SCRIPTS OR TWO SCRIPTS WHICH LOAD A PARAMETER UH F COMMON LINE PARAMETER
OH YOU OH YOU JUST HAVE THREE SUMMARISERS AND THEN THEY'RE ALL SYNCHED UP WITH ONE CLOCK
LIKE THREE OR
'CAUSE WE'LL NEVER HAVE MORE THAN TWO AND WE'LL NEVER HA WELL WE'LL EITHER HAVE ONE OR TWO
SO IN THE END 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF WELL I GUESS YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
AND JUST PROVIDE LIKE SOMETHING WHERE EACH OF THEM JUST IF IF THERE'S UH A JASMINE SCRIPT AND A VERA SCRIPT AND THEY EACH CAN LOAD THEIR STUFF AND SEE THEIR DATA IN IN THE THING
THEY CA THEY EACH CAN SEE IT SUMMARISED BY THEIR DATA AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE STATIC ONE
I THINK IT WOULD BE COOL IF WE COULD CHECK THE NITE CLOCK F CODE OR WHATEVER CODE IT IS FOR THIS COMPONENT AND SEE IF WE CAN ACCESS THOSE RATE THINGS AND AND DO SOMETHING USEFUL WITH THEM AND GET NOTIFIED WHEN THEY CHANGE AND STUFF
YEAH SO IT SHOULDN'T LIKE EVEN IF TO EVEN IF UH IF WE HAVE TO EXTEND NITE CLOCK
AND WE COULD JUSTIFY ALL SORTS OF STUFF LIKE THAT BY R IN THE PRESENTATION BY SAYING WE DELIBERATELY TRIED TO KEEP ANY COMPLEXITY AND NUMBERS AND STUFF AWAY FROM PEOPLE
I THINK THAT'S SORT OF A LINE WE SHOULD GO BY IN GENERAL SORT OF SAYING YEAH WE COULD'VE DONE OH SO MANY TH
IN FACT THAT'S WHY WE'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF A DOG SITTING IN A FIELD INSTEAD OF A MEETING BROWSER
AH OKAY I WAS ACTUALLY I WAS PLANNING THE SAME BUT WE WON'T GET SO MUCH DONE BEFORE THREE THAT'S THE THING
S OH SO WE COULD MEET AT FIVE AND I HAVE THE DISPLAY CODE READY BY THEN
SO WE CAN MEET IN FIVE IN APPLE AT FIVE IN APPLETON TOWER AND JUST WORK ON SO I'LL I'LL HAVE MY DISPL I'LL MAKE SURE THAT MY DISPLAY DOES ALL THE STUFF WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT UN UNTIL THEN
AND THEN WE'LL PUT THOSE THINGS TOGETHER
BUT I MEAN LIKE WE WE SHOULD DISCUSS TOGETHER WHICH W LIKE HOW THE THE SEARCH INTERACTS WITH THE REST
SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT COLIN SHOULD JUST DO IN HIS OWN
IT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM FOR ME AT THE STAGE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I BASED EVERYTHING ON NOT HAVING THOSE UM
AND SO THEY DIDN'T ANNOTATE THE N N UH UH THE SPACES AND EVERYTHING WOULD MESS UP
I THINK IF I HAD SPACES FOR THE UM NEW VALUES SO WHEN I WENT TO DO CORRELATION IT WOULDN'T WORK ANYMORE
OH WHAT I COULD DO IS UM WORK UM FURTHER WITH UM WHAT I'VE GOT NOW AND THEN JUST WHEN I HAVE MY UM UM YEAH
THE FINAL FORMULA READY I COULD UH T APPLY TO THE NEW STUFF
NO MY UM YEAH WHAT MY UM T. F. I. D. F. IS BASED ON COLIN'S DATA
IS IT STILL THE OLD OLD T. F. I. D. F.
I THINK SO TOO
HOW ABOUT THE SUMMARISATION AGAIN YOU WANTED TO BASE IT ON SENTENCE LENGTH AS WELL
ARE WE STILL WITH THAT IDEA THAT WE WANT TO DISPLAY BARS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SPEAKERS
NO ONE
AND THE PROBLEM IS UM IT'S PERHAPS MORE UM DANGEROUS TO GET MISTAKEN WITH ALL THOSE NUMBERS AND NOT KNOWING WHY THINGS HAPPEN IF WE JUST DEVOTE NUMBERS AND N MAKE NEW UH N N
YEAH SURE BUT I MEAN FOR ALL THOSE MEASURES THAT ARE BASED ON WORDS UM I CAN AUTOMATICALLY JUST THROW THOSE WHERE IT'S NOTHING
BUT ACTUALLY I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE AUDIO SHOULDN'T THERE
IF THERE'S UM EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT A WORD I THINK IN THE AUDIO THERE WILL BE SOMETHING AT THAT POINT BECAUSE IT HAS A DURATION
SO D YOU CUT IT OUT
YEAH I MEAN BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE A SPECIAL FOR THOSE
OH OKAY S
DID YOU TAKE THE ONE YOU FOUND IN THE IN THE UM X. M. L. FILE AND JUST KNOW PUT IT THERE
UM UH AND RE I THINK WE SHOULD START TO THINK ABOUT EVALUATION BY NOW
YEAH I THINK WE SHOULD HA TAKE THE TIME BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL BE
BUT WE'LL ALSO HAVE TO WRITE THE THE THING IN THAT TIME
YEAH IT WOULD BUY US SOMETHING
OR DO WE HAVE ANYTHING MORE ON THIS
M PERHAPS MY LIST OF AGREEMENTS
HERE IS UM A LIST OF THE UH UM MOST IMPORTANT OR YEAH MOST PROBABLE WORDS THAT OCCUR IN AGREEMENT
UM SO THE NUMBER IN THE FIRST BRACKETS IS UM SO I RUN IT ON ALL THE B. E. D. B. M. R. AND B. R. O. MEETINGS TO LEARN IT
AND UM THE FIRST NUMBER IN EVERY LINE IS UM HOW MUCH MORE OFTEN THAT IS PER SAME UM SAME TEXT LENGTH
SO UM THE NUM UH THE WORDS THAT UH IT GIVES IT ARE LOOK QUITE GOOD I THINK
IT'S UM YEAH EXCITING PERFECT TRUE INTERESTING EXACTLY CORRECT SUPER AND SO ON
UM AND THEN I RAN IT ON THE FIRST MEETING GETTING UM THE SO WHAT'S IN THE IN THE BRACKETS IN THIS WINDOW HERE IS THE UTTERANCES
UM AND THE MOMENT IT CAN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCES BETWE I MEAN YOU GET THE SAME VALUE FOR EVERY UTTERANCE THAT IS EXACTLY OR EVERY UTTERANCE THAT IS SURE
AND UM FOR THE LONGER UTTERANCES I JUST UM LOOK HOW OFTEN UM ONE OF THESE WORDS IS IN THERE AND SIMPLY ADD IT UP
UM AND YEAH AND SO THESE NUMBERS HERE UM ONE OR ZERO THESE HERE UM THAT'S UM
SO HERE UM FOR THOSE WHO GET A V THAT GET A VERY HIGH SCORE
UM THEY'RE MOSTLY NO NOT ZERO AND SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE ZERO ARE O ARE STILL VERY GOOD
UM AND WHEN YOU GET FURTHER DOWN YEAH YOU SEE THOSE WITH VERY LOW PROB UM SCORE ALSO HAVE UM NO AGREEMENTS
THEN FOR DISAGREEMENT I DID ALSO BUT UM IT'S A BIT MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THERE'S SO LITTLE DISAGREEMENT
YEAH SO THERE YOU S AGAIN SEE THE LIST
BUT IT'S MUCH SHORTER AND IT'S MU MUCH WORSE
UM THAT IS UM HERE AT THE LIST OF UTTERANCES IT UM GETS US FOR THE FIRST MEETING
UH YEAH
THINK IS ALSO RATED HIGHER IN THE NON AGREEMENT THAN IN THE AGREEMENT
AND THEN SCORE YEAH IT THIS WAS JUST FOR SHOWING IT
UM ONE PROBLEM I USED TO HAVE IS WITH ALL THE YEAHS
SO UM I WAS THINKING PERHAPS AT LOOKING UM AT THE UM ACOUSTIC MEASURES I HAVE
SO FOR EXAMPLE AT MY F. ZERO UM DEVIATION
I MEAN THERE IS A P DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO REALLY MAKE USE OF IT
BUT I PERHAPS INVESTIGATE SOME TIME STILL TO
IT WILL SOUND DIFFERENT THAN IF IT THAN INTO IF IT IS JUST A BACK CHANNEL
BECAUSE YOU HAVE UH YOU HAVE UM YOU DON'T HAVE IT ONLY WITH YEAHS
YOU HAVE IT ALSO WITH WORDS THAT ARE MUCH HIGHER RANKED
YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WITH YEP IS MUCH HIGHER RANKED BECAUSE IT OCCURS LESS OFTEN UM IN THE TRAINING THING
BECAUSE Y UM THIS RIGHT YEP AND OKAY THINGS ARE TYPICALLY ALSO BACK CHANNELS
I MEAN THE B THE BEST ONES ARE DEFINITELY THOSE ON THE FIRST SCREEN HERE
THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER
I ONL ONLY KEEP UH THE STUFF I ACTUALLY NEED ON IT AND THEN I CLEAN IT UP EVERY YOU KNOW EVERY
BUT ACTUALLY THIS ALL HERE IS N. L. S. S. D. BECAUSE IT WAS DATA A. THAT DIDN'T FIT ON MY UM QUOTA ANYMORE
YEAH SAME THING UH UM WITH THE YOOHOOS AND SO ON
OKAY THEN YOU YOU WILL PROVIDE A FILE WITH ALL THE MAPPINGS FROM THE OLD ONES TO THE
AND YOU WOULD OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE TOO COMPLICATED TO COPE WITH THE THI UH SYSTEM IF YOU HAVE TO RE ADJUST IT UH TO A DIFFERENT ZOOM LEVEL TO GET BETTER RESULTS
I HAVE TO CHECK THAT OUT
BUT I'LL CHECK IT OUT ANYWAY
SO WOULD IT BE WOULD IT BE EASIER IF THERE'S A REFERENCE FILE WITH THE ACTUAL REAL I. D. AND THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER
IS THERE SOME ALREADY
UM IT'D BE A LOT OF WORD FOR REALLY NO EXTRA P FEATURE GAIN AT ALL
WELL IF IT'S SOMETHING IN THE AUDIO THAT'S JUST LIKE A NOISE THEN WE DON'T WANT IT
YOU 'CAUSE THE THING IS IT DEPENDS IF WE WANT TO HAVE IT DISPLAY THE WHOLE THING AT ONCE
WELL EITHER WAY
EITHER WAY IS FINE BY ME AS LONG AS THE TWO WO THINGS UM TIE UP
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHETHER THOSE ARE IN OR OUT
OH IT'S THE BAR IS WORKING NOW
OH SO THE SUMMARY IS PROBABLY OKAY 'CAUSE IT DOES THE JOB
OH I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH ONE IT IS AT THE MOMENT
IS IT VERY COMPLEX OR IS IT R OH JUST MULTIPLYING TOGETHER
TO A POWER
AH IT'S STILL WORKING LIKE IT SHOULD DO
I'M JUST QUITE SURPRISED IT ALL ACTUALLY WORKED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING IT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON LIKE INCOMPLETE VERSIONS THAT HAVEN'T WORKED FOR A LONG TIME
AND LIKE TO SEE IT ALL COME TOGETHER
AND A SCRIPT THAT SETS THE CLASS PATH SO IT CAN BE RUN WITH JUST A SCRIPT
BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T NEED IT EVALUATED FOR THE PRESENTATION DO WE
IS IT
OH 'CAUSE IT WAS MOVED BACK WASN'T IT
I CAN ROPE PEOPLE IN TO TO DOING IT A FEW PEOPLE AT LEAST
WE SHOULD PROBABLY WRITE SOME USER DOCUMENTATION 'CAUSE I BET THAT WILL GET US MARKS
IN DIRECTORY YEAH
WELL WE SHOULD WAIT TILL WE HAVE IT READY FOR UM YOU GUYS TO USE
AND AS LONG AS I DON'T RUN INTO PROBLEMS I DON'T SEE IT TAKING TOO LONG
HOPEFULLY WE CAN TAKE OVER THAT RIGHT ONE 'CAUSE WE DON'T NEED IT
I BET YOU CAN JUST UH JUST ADD IT TO THE UM PANEL
LIKE WHAT I BET THAT'S A PRE MADE SWING COMPONENT THAT LITTLE SLIDER AND ALL YOU DO IS ADD IT TO A PANEL
CAN YOU SEND ME A LINK TO THAT PAPER SO THAT I'LL IMPLEMENT THAT IN SUMMARIZER
BUT CAN'T SEE IT TAKING LONG AGAIN
BUT TO BE HONEST I DID LIKE NOTHING REALLY ON IT LAST WEEK
IT'S JUST ANNOYING BECAUSE I NEED TO DO THAT ON A DICE MACHINE
AND AS LONG AS I CAN TEST THE SCRIPT LIKE ONCE AND IT'S WORKING FINE I CAN JUST MAKE IT RETURN DUMMY STUFF SO IT WORKS ON OTHER MACHINES
I CAN JUST ADD S. S. H. STUFF IN TO EV EVOKE THE SOUND TOOLS ON THE UH ON DICE AND THEN COPY 'EM BACK
IF IT COMES TO IT I'LL JUST UM INSTALL NETBEANS AND STUFF ON MY LINUX MACHINE AND WORK ON THAT
THEN RE MAPPING THE LOWEST REMAINING ONE TO ZERO AND SCALING IT LIKE THAT 'CAUSE YOU GET A MUCH NICER DISTRIBUTION LIKE THAT
UM I'VE NOT USED IT TO DO THAT BEFORE BUT
YEAH I CAN'T REMEMBER IT OFF HAND BUT I KNOW THERE IS ONE
THEY USED TO NOT UM CLOSE THE PROCESS WHEN YOU CLICK THE CROSS
YEAH YOU STILL YOU ST YEAH YOU STILL GET THE WRITTEN ONE AND THE DISPLAY
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BOTHER 'CAUSE WE'LL RUN IT ON A SOUND CARD VERSION
TH YES THEY CAN
YOU STILL GET THE DISPLAY IN THE SUMMARY
UM OH THERE MUST BE A WAY OF DETECTING WHETHER THE CLOCK'S LOADED
YOU CAN TRY AND SET SOMETHING ON THE CLOCK AND USE TRY AND CATCH AND THEN IF YOU CATCH THE EXCEPTIONS SET THE FLAG
WE COULD PUT THOSE ON DISPLAY
CAN YOU CLICK ON A POINT IN TIME IN DISPLAY AND JUMP TO THERE YET
NO I DON'T GET THAT ON MY MACHINE
SO WILL THAT PRODUCE BASICALLY AN AGREEMENT AND A DISAGREEMENT SCORE FOR EVERY DIALOGUE ACT
AND I'LL MAKE US T TO READ IT IN
YOU CAN PUT BOTH THE SCORES IN ONE FILE IF IT MAKES IT EASIER
ONE IS UM THE WELL I'VE CALLED IT WORD IMPORTANCE BUT THAT'S A REALLY M MISLEADING NAME
UH THE PROBLEM IS YEAH IS OCCURRING NOT ONLY AS AN AGREEMENT BUT REALLY FREQUENTLY AS LIKE UH AN ENCOURAGEMENT AS WELL ISN'T IT
'CAUSE IF IT'S BELOW ABOUT 'CAUSE I SAW THERE'S ONES UP IN THE EIGHTIES WASN'T THERE
IF IT'S BELOW LIKE FIFTY IT'S PROBABLY OR EXACTLY NO THEY'RE ALL BUT ONE
'CAUSE WE ON THE DISPLAY WE PROBABLY TAKE QUITE HIGH
SO IT'D ONLY MATTER IF IT OCCURS ON ONES THAT ARE REALLY HIGHLY RANKED
TO WE PROBABLY WON'T WANT TO DISPLAY NINETY
WE'D WANT TO RATE THEM AS HOW IMPORTANT THEY WERE WOULDN'T WE
AN AGREEMENT AT THE END
YEAH AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE SOME LOGIC WHEN IT DISPLAYS IT THAT SAYS IF THERE'S ONES VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IT JUST CENTRES IT AMONG THE
THEIR DESKTOP'S REALLY TIDY AND WHEN YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO USE IT ALL THE TIME THERE'S STUFF EVERYWHERE
YEAH I MEAN SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT
IF THEY LOOK GOOD THEN THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF DOING IT AS ANY I SUPPOSE
ACTUALLY WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IS TAKE THE HIGHEST THREE OR FOUR AND THEN JUST MERGE THEM TOGETHER INTO ONE UTTERANCE
JUST DRAW A BIG BLACK LINE ON THE BORDERS I THINK
WELL Y YOU YOU CAN IF YOU WANT TO
'CAUSE IT JU IT CAN DISPLAY FROM ANY UTTERANCE TO ANY OTHER UTTERANCE
AH
BECAUSE THAT WAY ALL WE HAVE TO DO TO DISPLAY EA MORE THAN ONE MEETING IS HAVE A HARDER BOUNDARY DRAWN
ONE THING WE WILL HAVE TO DO IS WE WANT WE'D REALLY WANT A DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR IF WE CLICKED ON A WHOLE MEETING THAN A SEGMENT
IT SHOULD UM IF YOU CLICK EVEN ON ONE THE SEGMENTS OF THAT MEETING I THINK IT SHOULD RE INITIALIZE AND DISPLAY THAT JUST THAT MEETING
SO I'M NOT SU I'M NOT SURE HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE TO DO
BUT ANYWAY WE CAN SORT THAT OUT IF WE HAVE TIME ONCE WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING ELSE
BASICALLY DO A CODE FOR EASE ON IT
AND UM IF YOU COULD DOCUMENT IT FOR ME THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH FOR ME TO ADD IT IN
IS THERE ALL IS THAT G VERSION ALL IN THE
WE REALLY NEED TO GET IN CONTACT WITH THE OTHER GROUP AND SEE IF THEY WANT TO DO A JOINT EVALUATION
'CAUSE I WAS HOPING THAT STEVE WOULD MENTION IT IAN 'CAUSE WE'VE MENTIONED IT TO HIM SO MANY TIMES
BUT HE OBVIOUSLY HASN'T
S THERE'S THE FRAME PROBLEM
I CAN'T SEE IT GOING ON FOR AN HOUR TO BE HONEST
I WE MAYBE YOU SHOULD PRESENT IT ON YOUR LAPTOP 'CAUSE WE CAN BE REALLY SURE IT'S RUNNING BEFORE WE COME
I COULD PROBABLY GET MY COMPUTER IN IF I COULD GET SOMEONE TO GIVE ME A LIFT
IN FACT YOU WON'T EVEN YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN NEED EITHER AS LONG AS YOU GOT JAVA INSTALLED
AND I'LL YEAH I'LL MAKE A SCRIPT TO RUN IT AND PUT THAT IN THE GROUP DIRECTORY
IT'LL BE THE BIT WHERE IT CREATES THE CLOCK
OR IS THERE STUFF IN THE DISPLAY AS WELL
WHAT IT WILL HAVE TO DO IS DE REGISTER EVERYTHING AS TIME HANDLERS AND THEN UPDATE AND THEN RE REGISTER THEM
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DE REGISTER EVERYTHING THAT'S A TIME HANDLER FIRST BEFORE YOU ADD THE STUFF IN
DOES IT NOT
YEAH BUT IT W IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE UM IF IT'S JUMPED TO IN THE END TEXT AREA
SO MAY WE PROBABLY WANT A DIFFERENT SUMMARY CONSTRUCTOR THAT TAKES AN AN ADDITIONAL ARGUMENT OF AN I. D.
BUT THE TROUBLE IS THAT STILL DOESN'T GUARANTEE THAT IT'LL APPEAR BECAUSE IF YOU GET ENOUGH OF THEM THAT ARE HIGH SCORED IT PREFERS THE FIRST ONES IT SEES
BUT YOU COULD D YOU CAN UM ACHIEVE THE SAME EFFECT
PROBABLY THE WAY TO HANDLE THAT WOULD BE TO MAKE A SUMMARY THAT'S THE SAME LENGTH AS THE SELECTION AND THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE SEARCH TERM CAME UP
AND I'LL START WORK IN SAY TWO
WILL IT BE DONE BY THEN
BUT I CAN FIT 'EM BACK IN IF
YEAH IT'S A CER UH
YEAH MY TOPIC SEGMENTER DOESN'T LIKE BLANK LINES EITHER
IS IT NOT IS IT NOT ONLY TWO DAYS ANYWAY
NO ONE YET
UH
YEAH ARE WE GONNA HAVE TIME TO MAKE IT DISPLAY LIKE A WHOLE ARCHIVE OF MEETINGS
YEAH THE SEE AT THE MOMENT THE DIALOGUE I. D. S JUST THEY START AT ZERO FOR EACH MEETING THEY DON'T RUN UM CONTINUOUSLY
NO OH YEAH
YEAH I THINK THEY'RE ON THE N. L. S. S. D. WEB PAGE
YEAH I'M SURE HE'LL LET US UH TEST IT OUT BEFORE WE DO IT
YEAH DAVE SEE IN THE PROGRAMME MANAGER DO YOU HAVE A A METHOD TO LIKE SET THE CURRENT I. D. SO IT'LL UPDATE THE DISPLAY
YEAH WELL AS FAR AS I'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT I'VE MADE A RESULTS CLASS THAT'S GOT LIKE THE I. D. AND THE STUFF
YOU COULD JUST LIKE SORT OF ZOOM BACK OUT SO YOU GOT THE FULL TEXT FOR THAT SEGMENT OR THAT MEETING RATHER THAN A SUMMARY
SO WHAT I'M HAVING IS SO WE WE HAD A WE HAD A LONG PROBLEM ABOUT NOT FINDING OUT WHY THE TIME SYNCHING UP BETWEEN THE RELATIVE TIME IN IN A IN A SORT OF IN A IN A SUMMARISED SECTION AND THE ABSOLUTE TIME DIDN'T CORRESPOND AND STUFF
AND WE FOUND IT WAS SOME STUPID WELL
AT THE MOMENT OUR BEST GUESS IS THAT IT WAS SOME STUPID JAVA THING ABOUT IF YOU IF YOU ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE TWO OBJECTS AND YOU SAY OBJECT IF YOU SAY A. EQUALS B.
SO ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO ONE ARE MADE TO THE OTHER AND IF YOU DO THAT AROUND FIVE CORNERS
AND IT TURNS OUT IT IS ZERO BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME THING THAT YOU ANYWAY UH SO WE FIGURED OUT IT'S INTERESTING
YEAH BUT LAST TIME I PRESSED THAT KEY COMBINATION EVERYTHING WENT WRONG AND I THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT JUST FINE ON THE SCREEN
SO THAT'LL PROBABLY KEEP ME FROM POINTING ON MY SCREEN WHICH I USUALLY IT MIGHT JUST BE AT THIS POINT
LIKE THERE'S SOMETIMES A POINT TO LOADING NOT USUALLY THAT LONG
ANYWAY SO N UH LET'S JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS
OH SEE I GET YEAH
AH SO NOW I'M HAVING A COMPLETE MESS OF LIKE SPLIT
SO BUT I THINK IF I THIS IS A LOG OUT COMMAND AND USUALLY IT RESETS THIS AMAZING STRANGE COLOUR COMBINATIONS I SEE IN FRONT OF ME AT THE MOMENT
I GOT IT FIXED IN THE LAST WHATEVER ONE HOUR OR SOMETHING
BUT SO AT THE MOMENT THE PROGRAM IS SORT OF IN BETWEEN WORKING AND NOT WORKING BECAUSE WE'VE DONE LOTS OF CHANGES TO WHAT THE ERROR WAS
LIKE IF YOU IF YOU FIRST IF YOU READ THROUGH THE SUMMARIES THEY READ SUSPICIOUSLY FLUENT LIKE AS IN PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
AND THEN IF YOU PLOT THEM ON THE SCREEN WHERE WHERE THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT THEY SEEM TO O
SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THIS MEETING IS ABOUT TO BE HONEST
UM I'M I'M GONNA SHOW THIS JUST WHAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT BUT IT NOT GONNA LOOK VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAD LAST TIME
DON'T ASK HIM WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PROMISE THAT YOU'LL GET YOUR SCRIPT WHERE YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN STUFF BECAUSE ACTUALLY THAT WAS SORT OF READY BUT THEN WE SORT STARTED TRYING TO GET SOMETHING MORE WORKING AND THEN WE GOT INTO BIG PROBLEMS
SO AT THE MOMENT I MEAN AGAIN WE SHOULD BE AT A STATE WHERE PEOPLE CAN LOAD THEIR OWN SC OKAY
BUT FROM MONDAY ON I CAN JUST DO TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FOR THIS ONE UNTIL IT UNTIL IT'S DUE
EEK
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE WHATEVER YOU GET AND THEN JUST SEE HOW FAR THAT GETS YOU
LIKE IF WE THOSE A SPECIAL INFORMATION DENSITY I. D. OR IF YOU JUST PUT A SPE YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND THEN JUST MAKE SURE THAT SUMMARY EVEN IN THE IN THE MOST SUMMARISED MODE JUST NEVER PUTS THEM IN
YEAH IT DID S IT DID SUMMARISE JUST NOW
DO YOU KNOW Y ARE W ARE WE UM SO AT THE MOMENT THE CONFIGURATION IS THAT WORD IMPORTANCE FILE IS TEST THREE AND T. D. I. D. F. FILE IS TEST TWO
UM THAT'S BASICALLY IT'S IT'S T GOING ON ABOUT THIS FANCY CALLED GEOMETRIC MEAN WHICH EFFECTIVELY JUST MEANS MULTIPLYING THEM
BUT I I HAVE SOME GOOD F INFORMATION ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS HOW YOU CAN SORT OF WEIGHT TWO DIFFERENT FACTORS
SO THERE IS SOMETHING FOR JUST FOR PUTTING THEM TOGETHER IN A RELATIVELY SIMPLE WAY BUT STILL A WAY THAT WE CAN SORT OF JUSTIFY
NO IT'S MULTIPLYING THEM AND AND LIKE PUTTING THEM ONE OVER THE POWER OF SOMETHING AND THE OTHER OVER MINUS ONE ONE MINUS THE POWER OF SOMETHING
AND THAT'S SORT OF AND THEY THEY'VE PLOTTED SOME GRAPHS ABOUT LIKE WHERE THEY SHOW F LIKE ONE GOING FROM ZERO TO THE ONE AND THE OTHER GOING ZERO TO ONE AND LIKE HOW THE HOW THE LANDSCAPE CHANGES AND HOW I THE PARAMETER CHANGES
UM THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT WE GO AT
IT'S IT'S SORT OF IT'S OVERRUNNING THE F LIKE IT SO OKAY SO AT THE MOMENT WE'RE THAT FAR THAT IF I NOW CLICK ONTO A SEGMENT HITS
SO THEN I H I DID I GET A NEW SUMMARISATION
YEAH I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE
YEAH SO YOU SEE IT'S A DIFFERENT TEXT
AND YOU SEE IT IT'S RUNNING THROUGH IT
AND ALSO YOU SEE THE INDICATOR IN WHERE WE ARE IS JUMPING
NOW I DON'T THINK THE SUMMARY AT THE MOMENT IS WHAT WE WANTED TO BE SEEING THE WORDS LIKE OH AND MM AND EXACTLY EXACTLY RIGHT SURE
S
S SO AT THE MOMENT I'VE HARD CODED IT TO JUST UM TAKING ONE TENTH OF THE NUMBER OF UTTERANCES WHICH WERE IN THE ORIGINAL SELECTION
AND IF YOU SELECT THOSE THAN IT'S HAVING AN
THAT'S BL I MEAN AN AN ABSOLUTE LENGTH IS SORT OF A BIT STRANGE BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT SOME UTTERANCES WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN LENGTH
DOES ANYONE HAVE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OVER THE WHOLE TIME ISSUE LIKE AS IN WHAT DATE IS IT TODAY
WHAT DATE DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS PRESENTED WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK IS THAT AND ISSUES LIKE THAT
SO THE PRESENTATION IS NOW SH TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY
AH
HOW LONG IS IT EXPECTED TO BE
I KNOW BUT UH IF EVERYONE LIKE IF EVERYONE IS MANAGING THREE PAGES FOR THEIR BIT THEN THAT'S GONNA BE THAT THAT'S A BIG REPORT THEN
AH
WE SHOULD PROBABLY INQUIRE ABOUT THAT OR LIKE INTEGRATE TOOL TIPS THAT WOULD BE VISIBLE
HAVING SAID THAT DAVE WE COULD PROBABLY W LIKE IF WE WANT
WE COULD PROBABLY GO BACK TO THE C UM TO THE GROUP DIRECTORY AND JUST USE THIS TRICK
HOW WE CAN JUST HAVE A SLIDE BAR WHICH WE CAN READ AND WRITE TO WHICH IS IN A FRAME OF THAT TYPE
BUT IF YOU'RE UNLUCKY IT MIGHT BE QUICKER TO JUST WRITE A VERY SIMPLE STRING COMPONENT WHICH IS JUST THE S JUST A BAR
ONE FOR CONTROLLING THE LENGTH OF THE SUMMARY AND ANOTHER ONE FOR
UM FOR THE MERGING FACTOR IF WE DO IT THAT WAY WITH THE CHI METRIC
IS THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY NOT HAD TIME TO WORK ON THAT
'KAY IT SEEMS THAT AT THE MOMENT A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT HAS TO BE DONE AT SORT OF AT THE MOMENT I'M SAYING OH DAVE
'CAUSE I THINK I MEAN THE AUDIO IS A V IN THE END THE AUDIO IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF IT
JUST BECAUSE IT'S IT'S GONNA LOOK STUPID IF WE HAVE EVERYTHING WORKING BUT JUST IF
IS THERE ANY WAY FOR X. FORWARDING SOUND
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE SORT OF THE NICE WAY TO SIT AT HOME AND HAVE IT FORWARD THE SOUND AT THE LOWEST BIT RATE TO YOU
Y ARE YOU NOT CREATING FILES ANYWHERE LIKE SORT OF REAL FILES
SO THAT YOU CAN DO ON A DICE MACHINE INDEPENDENT OF W
ONE PROBLEM WITH S. S. H. ING IN GENERAL IS THAT THE MACHINE THAT LIKE ON THE ONLY GATEWAY MACHINES THEY HATE YOU FOR DOING ANYTHING ON THEM
AND THERE'S NO SIMPLE WAY AT LEAST I HAVEN'T FOUND ONE TO DIRECTLY IN IN A SINGLE STEP SORT OF S. S. H. AND THEN S. S. H. AGAIN
WHICH I HAVEN'T BECAUSE IT ALWAYS FUCKS UP ON MY SYSTEM
UH
EVERYTHING ELSE BEING EQUAL IT TOOK THE FIRST ONES MORE OR LESS
BUT NOW IT'S WORKING BETTER BECAUSE NOW IT'S ON A MUCH MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED
YEAH IT'S IT'S A G IT'S A VERY SIMPLE SIMPLE FORMU IT'S BASICALLY JUST WHATEVER THE AVERAGE OF R MEAN SQUARE DIFFERENCES FROM THE MEAN OR SOMETHING
WHICH THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT GENERALLY YOU FIRST HAVE TO GET THE MEAN AND ONLY T ONLY ONCE YOU HAVE THE MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT
IN ONE GO
ONE STANDARD DEVIATION BELOW THE MEAN IS ZERO AND ONE STANDARD DEVIATION ABOVE THE MEAN IS ONE OR TWO STANDARD DEVIATIONS OR SOMETHING
Y THAT WOULD INDIRECTLY ALSO DROP STUFF
LIKE THE STANDARD STANDARD DEVIATION FORMULA JUST REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE THE MEAN INITIALLY
BUT ANYWAY WE ONLY WE ONLY GONNA PRESENT THIS ONCE AND WE CAN PROBABLY JUST LIKE SORT OF START IT UP BEFORE THE PRESENTATION STARTS
NO IT DOES NOT IT DOES NOT IF Y I CHANGED IT
SO YOU WOULD FORGET THAT THAT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD START IT FIFTEEN TIMES OVER AND HAVE FIFTEEN ZOMBIES RUNNING
'CAUSE THE THING IS WE CAN LIKE THIS AT THE MOMENT WOR IS WORKING BECAUSE IT HAS A SOUND CARD
SO YOU B YOU BASICALLY WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO CODE VERSIONS THEN
ONE FOR SOUND CARD AND ONE FOR NON SOUND CARD MACHINES TO TEST IT ON
SO THERE ISN'T A SIMPLE WAY TO JUST TELL WHICH ONES THE SOUND CARD MACHINES ARE AND JUST TO USE SOUND CARD MACHINES IS THERE
NO BUT I GUESS I MEAN IF YOU JUST IF YOU TRUST IN DAVE'S SUMMARY FOR THE AUDIO
JUST PUTTING ALL THESE THINGS INTO SOUND THEN THEN HAVING A WRITTEN SUMMARY
SO I THINK DAVE REALLY THE EASIEST WAY IS IF YOU JUST MAKE A SOUND CARD AND A NON SOUND CARD VERSION OF IT
YES BUT WITHOUT THE CLOCK YOU DON'T HAVE WELL ACTUALLY YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOESN'T LIKE F IT DOESN'T STRICTLY HAVE TO DO ANY MOVEMENT IN IT YEAH
LIKE AT THE MOMENT IF YOU CLICK ON A SEGMENT IT AUTOMATICALLY SETS THE WHOLE CLOCK THING GOING AND STUFF
YES THE P THERE IS
SO ANYWAY SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE IT SEEMS JUST THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF DICE MACHINES DON'T HAVE SOUND CARD
SO APART FROM LIKE UH A SEARCH BOX AND THE SIMILARITY THING F ONCE THAT KICKS OFF
SO I MEAN WE'LL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE T
UH YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD DAVE'S RIGHT
BUT I THINK DAVE WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS THAT TH UH THE TIME CLICK OF THE CLOCK I THINK THAT'S CHANGEABLE
BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S ZERO POINT ONE SECONDS AND THAT'S JUST THERE IS ACTUALLY THERE ARE SOME BACKGROUND NOISE WHEN IT'S WORKING AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE DOING SO MUCH EVERY TIME
IF I CAN SKIP MORE ACCURATELY THEN
UH YOU'RE
SO MAYBE IT'S JUST LIKE MAYBE B IT'S JUST GOOD TO HAVE LIKE SOME GENERIC COMPONENT WITH THREE SLIDE BARS OR SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN RELATIVELY EASILY ADD A FOURTH ONE OR SOMETHING
UH WELL IT DEPENDS WE WE COULD LIKE IN SOME CASES WE COULD PUT IT AS A FEATURE AND SAY YOU KNOW YOU CAN DYNAMICALLY
SO AND YEAH AND EVERY AND EVERYTHING ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD I COULD THEN ADD THE UTTERANCE WHERE IT OCCURS
SO FOR EACH UTTERANCE YOU HAVE ONE AGREEMENT AND ONE DISAGREEMENT SCORE
SO BASICALLY A CONSTANT LIKE THAT'S JAVA'S TYPE OF A CONSTANT AND GIVE THEM NAMES LIKE SO ZERO T. D. I. D. F.
ONE THAT PROBABLY MAKES THE CODE A LOT MORE READABLE FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S PLAYING AROUND WITH IT
I WOULD ALSO TH YEAH BUT I WOULD ALSO TH
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD PUT THE THRESHOLD FOR THAT ONE IN THE END QUITE HIGH ANYWAY
NOW THIS IS LIKE SO THE THIRD COLUMN IS THE UTTERANCE WHERE IT OCCURS RIGHT
I'D SAY PROBABLY A GOOD WAY OF GOING ABOUT THAT QUESTION IS TO HAVE A CONTROL WHICH WE CAN VARY IN THE DIS AND THEN JUST SORT OF BECAUSE THAT'S IN THE END HOW IT'S GONNA BE EVALUATED
YOU KNOW IN THE END IT THIS IS GONNA LI I MEAN WE'RE GONNA PRESENT IT AND SAY YEAH SO THIS OUR IT SHOWS DISAGREEMENTS
OR LIKE OR LIKE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN THE THREE AND AND FIVE AGREEMENTS BUT NOT MORE
OR PROBABLY MAYBE LESS BUT NOT MUCH LESS AND ACTUALLY THE I THINK THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ONE IN EVERYTHING
N YES BUT MAYBE IN AN EXPENSIVE WAY OR MAYBE IN A STUPID LOOKING WAY THOUGH
YEAH D I'M YEAH I WAS JUST THINKING THAT IT CAN ACT IT CAN PROBABLY BE DONE ON DISPLAY LEVEL
MINE JUST CRASHED I THINK WHICH IS BAD
IT PROBABLY JUST IT KEPT ON PLAYING AND NOW REACHED SOME WHATEVER
I THINK SORT OF THE BOTTOM LINE AND WHICH MIGHT WELL END UP WHAT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE IS THAT WE TAKE THE SINGLE HIGHEST RANKED UTTERANCE AND PUT THAT AS A T AS A TITLE
THERE W
YEAH MAYBE EVEN ON A S ON A SING LIKE I IS THAT ON A R LIKE IS THAT ON A WORD BASIS WOULD THAT BE SINGLE WORDS
'CAUSE BE CHECK OUT WHAT THEY WOULD BE LIKE ON A WORD BASIS
BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE THE ONLY TIME THAT UH WAS SPELLED WITH THREE A. AND STUFF
IF IT'S JUST LIKE I HAVE ARBITRARILY LONG LISTS FROM THE BRITISH NATIONAL CORPUS OF WHEN T USUALLY
YEAH SO IF YOU IF LIKE I MEAN IF THE SINGLE HA BEST ONE WORD FOR A FOR A SEGMENT IS INTERESTING THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD
USE A RANDOM S
I MEAN THAT WAS PART OF IT THAT SORT OF WITHIN THE SEGMENT YOU HAD THESE SUB SEGMENTS AND EACH OF THEM HAD DIFFERENT WORDS AND WHATEVER HAPPENED TO OUR DREAMS
OH SO J YOU YOU ARE THINK OF LOADING THEM ALL AT ONCE
EVEN THOUGH WE
UM YEAH SO IF PERFORMANCE WISE IT GENERALLY WORKS FINE FOR THE DISPLAY IT SHOULDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
SO IF IF THE OTHER PERFORMANCE IS OKAY THEN WE SHOULD REALLY JUST LOAD THE WHOLE THING IN
I'M VERY DIS
SEE THAT PROBABLY JUST MEANS THAT THE DISPLAY SORT OF HAS AN INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT LEVEL OF ZOOM IT HAS
WE THEN NEED SOME WAY OF GETTING BACK UP AGAIN IN THE HIERARCHY
BUT THAT IN THE WORST CASE IT WILL JUST BE A STATIC SORT OF ARROW UP BUTTON IN THE RIGHT HAND TOPPER CORNER OF THE DISPLAY
AND YOU PRESS THAT AND THEN YOU'RE ON THE DISPLAY THE WHOLE THING AGAIN
BUT FOR THAT AT THE MOMENT MY DISPLAY CODE NEEDS THAT THING TO WORK THE ONE OH NO THAT'S WORKING AT THE MOMENT ANYWAY
THE ONE THAT I JUST SAY GIVE ME ONE HUNDRED VALUES OVER THAT LENGTH AND THEN YOU'RE INTERNALLY OKAY
BUT YEAH BUT UH THAT'S OKAY AS LONG AS MY DISPLAY I WAS JUST THINKING MY DISPLAY CAN'T HANDLE DISPLAYING A MILLION DIFFERENT SEGMENTS
BUT NOW R NO BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
UM SO DAVE CAN YOU JUST TURN THIS WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IN
UH AND IF AN
IF ANYONE FEELS THAT THEY HAVE FREE TIME UH THIS IS A JOKE
UM ONE THING THAT WOULD BE CONVENIENT FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND WHICH I HAVEN'T FOUND OUT ABOUT IT IS HOW TO DO TOOL TIPS IN AN ARBITRARY WAY IN IN IN SWING GRAPHIC DISPLAYS
AND THAT WOULD BE QUITE CONVENIENT FOR A LOT OF THINGS BECAUSE THEN WE CAN SORT OF HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THE DISPLAY IN THE IN THE WAY THAT JUST WHEN THE MOUSE IS OVER IT
I FOUND SOME STUFF ABOUT IT ON THE WEB AND IT JUST LOOKED TO ME LIKE PROPER CODING
LIKE I SAW HALF PAGE CODE SAMPLES WHICH EFFECTIVELY JUST DISPLAYED A TOOL TIP AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME AT THAT POINT TO GET DEEPER INTO THAT
IS THERE ANY DICE MACHINES IN THIS BUILDING
NO MAYBE HE HAS MENTIONED IT TO THEM BUT THEY JUST NEVER TALKED TO US
AND THEN I KNEW OH NOW THE PRESENTATION IS SHIFTED
BUT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO FACTS THE INTERDEPENDENCIES THERE'S SOME FANCY PLANNING LANGUAGE ABOUT THAT
SO FOR A DEMO I THINK REALISTICALLY SINCE EVERYTHING IN THIS UNIVERSITY SORT OF WORKS IN ONE HOUR SLOTS AND STUFF
NO WHY IS TH THIS IS GONNA BE SO BAD
I MEAN LIKE AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT TOO BAD APART FROM I THINK THE SOUND IS STUTTERING AND THAT'S B I THINK BECAUSE OF THE LAPTOP
HOW FAST IS YOURS VERA
WELL NET WOULD RUN ON ANYTHING
YEAH SEE THAT'S 'CAUSE THAT'S THE THING LIKE THAT WOULD RELY ON I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO RUN THE SPEECH TOOLS IN
NO NO NO NO D WHEREVER THIS IS GOING IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD
WE CAN HE CAN USE MY LAPTOP AS SORT OF LIKE AS A AS A SERVER AS A SOUND SERVER
NO YOU KNOW I THINK I MEAN THE WAY JAVA WORKS IS THAT T
I THINK IT'LL RUN ON ON THEIR DICE MACHINE IF WE'RE DOING IT IN IF WE WELL WE SHOULD DEFINITELY TEST IT THE DAY BEFORE
SO DAVE ARE YOU GONNA MAKE SOMETHING PRIMITIVE THAT PEOPLE CAN LOAD THEIR DATA IN
YEAH THE YEAH
NO BUT THE THING IS THE DISPLAY CALLS METHODS WHICH PROBABLY EXPECT SOME SO I THINK IF THE DISPLAY ITSELF ISN'T DOING ANYTHING CLOCKY
'CAUSE THEN IN THE END I 'CAUSE OTHERWISE WE ALWAYS HAVE TWO CODE VERSIONS AND PEOPLE MIGHT BE CHANGING THE WRONG ONE
I'M NOT ACTUALLY LIKE FOR THE PROGRAMME MANAGER THEN TO CALL
I'M NOT ACTUALLY A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT THE DISPLAY HAS SOME METHOD WHERE YOU TELL IT WHERE TO START AND WHERE TO END
NO SORRY I'VE UH I WAS WRONG I WAS THINKING IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN WE SAY SET SELECT NO IT DOES NOT
BECAUSE WELL IT IT DOESN'T TELL THE DISPLAY WHICH PART TO DI WHICH PART TO TO DISPLAY BECAUSE THE DISPLAY HAS JUST CALLED SET SELECTION TO
SO ACTUALLY A TIME CHANGE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY PUT THE POSITION OF THE DISPLAY IN THE RIGHT PLAY
UH NO BUT THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THAT COULD WELL BE OUTSIDE THE DISPLAYED AREA THEN
YEAH YOU CAN SET THE WINDOW START UTTERANCE AND WINDOW END UTTERANCE
AS A HACK YOU KNOW LIKE JUST AS LONG AS YOU THEN DON'T WELL PROBABLY PEOPLE WOULDN'T KNOW
WELL YOU COULD YOU COULD PUT ONE POINT ONE WHEN THE OTHER ONES ONLY GO UP TO THE ONE
YEAH PROBABLY THAT ACTUALLY TRUE THAT IF YOU'RE DOING A SEARCH YOU'RE USUALLY NOT INTERESTED IN A CONDENSED WAY BUT IN THE IN THE FULL THING ANYWAY
SO IF WE'RE DOING IT BY A PROPORTION THEN JUST HAVING ONE POINT ZERO OR SOMETHING MAKES IT VERY EASY TO ALWAYS END UP AT THE ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT I'VE CURRENTLY LIKE THE CURRENT CODE JUST TAKES A TENTH OF THE SUMMARY LENGTH
AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF SLIDER THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY LEAVE IN AND LIKE SHOW 'CAUSE THAT'S THAT'S FUNCTIONALITY
YEAH OTHERWISE YOU'LL YOU'LL DEFINITELY SEE ME IN M. S. N.
CAN YOU JUST REMIND ME I DON'T HAVE TO TICK THE NO N OKAY THING UNTIL I FINISH WRITING
SO IF I'M WORKING O IF I'VE DONE A PAGE I'M ON THE SECOND PAGE
I TICK IT SO UM I FINISH THAT PAGE AND I GO BACK TO THIS I CAN JUST WRITE AND THEN NOT TICK UNTIL I FINISH WRITING AGAIN
YEAH SO IT'S ALWAYS AFTER N YOU NEVER HAVE TO IT BEFORE
WELL THE FIRST THING I THINK IS WE NEED TO UH SORT OUT THE CALL FOR ABSTRACTS OR THE C THE CALL FOR TITLES
UM SO I VOLUNTEER TO DO THAT IF YOU LIKE
UM UH OKAY
BY TRYING TO THINK WHAT IS IT THURSDAY TODAY I'LL D I'LL DO THAT BY THE END OF THE WEEK ANYWAY
YEAH WE'RE GONNA DO THAT BUT I THINK WE SHOULD S PROBABLY SEND OUT UM SEPARATE CALLS OKAY
SO WE'LL SEND ONE BUT WEREN'T MEN I MEAN WE COULD MENTION THE FACT THAT WE'RE INVITING OTHER PEOPLE
BUT I THINK IT WILL PROBABLY JUST UH I MEAN IT PROBABLY WON'T MATTER TOO MUCH TO THE OTHER LINGUISTS THAT WE'RE HAVING OTHER PEOPLE THERE
SO SO THAT'S THE ONE FOR LING BASICALLY AND I'LL SEND THAT OUT
SO I IF ROBERT EMAILS CLAIRE AND WE'RE N GONNA NEED TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S GONNA SAY ON THERE
SO WHAT WE'LL DO I MEAN THE THING IS THE THE MAIN CALL WILL GO OUT BEFORE SHE'S GOT ROUND TO IT ANYWAY
SO WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL COPY IT
I'LL C. C. HER ON THE UM
I JUST TH THE ONLY THING I'M THINKING IS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT STANDS OUT AS SOMETHING APPLICABLE TO THEM
THAT THEY DON'T GO OH WE'RE JUST GETTING RUBBISH FROM Y YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
UM AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT CLAIRE SENDING IT IS SHE'S PROBABLY GOT A PSYCH EMAIL ADDRESS AS WELL AND IT IT MIGHT LOOK A BIT MORE RELEVANT TO THEM
UM SO YEAH SO IF IF WE'VE S IF I'VE C. C. ED THE ORIGINAL ONE THEN YOU CAN TELL HER THAT THAT CAN BE THE BASIS FOR
UM THE BASIS FOR HER EMAIL BUT JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW IT'S RELEVANT TO THEM ET CETERA
IN A WAY WE COULD SEND OUT THAT FIRST CALL TO THEM JUST AS PART OF THE SAME EMAIL
AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD INVITE THEM BUT THEN WE'VE STILL GOT THE PROBLEM OF UH A PRIORITY ISSUE
IF THEY WANT TO SHOULD THEY HAVE PRIORITY
THIS IS A KIND OF LOWER POINT BUT UH IT KIND OF IT CROSSES OVER WITH DECIDING
OH SO JUST HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF IN THE MORNING
NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE I MEAN THE GOOD THINK IS N
SO IT'S TH SO IT'S TWELVE THIRTY SIX TALKS IS THAT RIGHT
UH
WELL I COULD LOOK 'CAUSE I I'VE GOT THAT THERE'S THE LIST ISN'T THERE OF POST GRADUATES I MAINTAIN IN IN LINGUISTICS
UM THERE ARE PROBABLY ABOUT THIRTY ON THERE
UM BUT A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM ARE FIRST YEARS AND I DON'T KNOW I MEAN JUST TO GET AN IDEA ARE YOU PLANNING ON TALKING
ARE YOU PLANNING ROBERT
SO YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE THAT WE ONLY GET SAY FIFTEEN ANYWAY
PLUS
UH ONE A. M. OR P. M. OF POSTERS
DURING THE SESSION LIKE HOW MANY CAN YOU HAVE GOING ON AT ONCE
WALL SPACE AND
I'VE BEEN TO DURHAM UH POST GRADUATE CONFERENCE AND I MEAN EVERY CONFERENCE I'VE EVER BEEN TO
THE POSTERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE COFFEE BREAK WHICH IS WHY PROBABLY BECAUSE NORMALLY THEY'RE LIMITED ON SPACE AND THEY
WHAT WOULD IT BE AT THE BEGINNING
YEAH BUT I D I DON'T THINK HE MEANS THAT IT WOULD BE
YEAH I I MIGHT DO I D I STILL TH I'M LITTLE BIT DOUBTFUL
WE COULD HAVE IT IN B. NINE BUT THERE'S THINGS ALL OVER THE WALL
AND WHA UH UM WHAT I'LL DO I'LL EMAIL MITS ABOUT THAT OKAY
WELL WHAT WE'LL DO IS SA WE CAN JUST SAY UH IF YOU WANT TO DO A TALK
EVERYONE'S KIND OF DONE IT AS A COP OUT THEN WE MIGHT HAVE TO SORT OF SAY TO THEM WELL YOU KNOW
I MEAN W
SO I'VE UH OKAY SO ENGLISH LANGUAGE UM WE'LL PUT ON THE MAIN CALL
AND I'LL JUST I I'LL JUST KINDA MARKET IT AS AN LINGUISTICS AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK
AT WHETHER THEY DO PHILOSOPHY OF A LANGUAGE AND LOGIC AND STUFF HERE AND THEY KIND OF DO
THERE'S ABOUT THERE'S ABOUT THREE OR FOUR UH FULL TIME MEMBERS OF STAFF THAT LIST UM PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE AS A MAJOR INTEREST
THE THING IS WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BIAS IT TOWARDS ANY PARTICULAR KIND OF LINGUISTICS IN A SENSE
I I THINK THAT I THINK THAT BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY INFORMATICS AND UM PSYCHOLOGY YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT QUITE A LOT OF BREADTH THERE ANYWAY
SO WHAT KIND OF PROVISOR CAN WE PUT ON
OR WE CAN JUST YOU KNOW T UH TAKE WHATEVER WE GET AND PICK THE BEST BETWEEN US WHICH IS
SO WHO WANTS TO SEND SOMETHING OUT TO INFORMATICS
UM BUT PUT A WARNING THAT IF IT'S LOGIC THEN THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT NO ONE WILL UNDERSTAND OR NOT THAT MANY
AND THEN BETWEEN US WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER MEETING AND AND I MEAN AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE SORTING THROUGH ALL THE OTHER TITLES AND AND DECIDING UM HOW TO DIVIDE UP THE SESSIONS
SEE SOMEONE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER TO HAVE TALKS ON A SIMILAR TOPIC SPREAD OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHICH TO ME JUST SEEMED ABSOLUTELY CRAZY
BUT I THINK THAT BALANCE AGAINST THE FACT THAT MOST PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY WELL LOOK I CAN HAVE JUST THIS ONE DAY OFF
AS OPPOSED TO WHEN I'LL NEED AN HOUR OVER THREE DA YOU KNOW AN HOUR EACH DAY FOR THREE DAYS
UH I THINK A LOT OF THE TIME SIMON KIRBY HAS ALREADY SAID TO ME THAT ANYONE ANY OF HIS STUDENTS HE WANTS TO BE ON THE FIRST DAY
ON THE WEDNESDAY RIGHT
SO AND THE OTHER THING IS UM WHEN WE GET SOME CALLS SAY WE HAVE
AND THEN WE CAN PUT THEM IN A BLOCK AT ONE TIME
AND IT'S ALSO GOOD IF TALKS ARE ON THE SAME TOPIC FOR A WHOLE MORNING OR A WHOLE AFTERNOON BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE WILL COME ALONG AND GO OH
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ANYWAY
NOW WE NEED IF I'M GONNA SEND OUT THIS CALL UH WE NEED A DEADLINE FOR TITLES
END OF MARCH MIGHT BE OKAY
AND THEN I'M COMING BACK JUST IN TIME FOR THE CONFERENCE
UH IT'S STARTING ON THE WEDNESDAY AND THE FIRST DAY BACK IS TUESDAY
MIGHT EVEN HAVE TO COME IN IN THE EVENING
SO NOT ONLY IS THERE A PRESSURE TO HAVE UH
TALKS THAT ARE ON A SIMILAR TOPIC TOGETHER BUT ALSO IF PEOPLE NEED THE SAME KIND OF COMPUTER SET UP
BUT HE JUST NEEDS TO KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT PEOPLE NEED SO THAT HE CAN BE THERE AND AND GET IT READY FOR THEM
WELL HOPEFULLY MOST PEOPLE WILL D EITHER HAVE SOMETHING LIKE POWERPOINT OR THEY'LL JUST HAVE UH P. D. F. SLIDES OR SOMETHING
HOPEFULLY NO ONE WILL HAVE ANYTHING TOO SPECIALIZED
S SH Z
BUT I THINK IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF I MEAN UH I THINK SOMETIMES MAYBE PEOPLE NEED TO BE IN LINUX RATHER THAN WINDOWS AND SO BOOTING IN AND OUT
M IS SOMETIMES AN ISSUE I THINK
BUT I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD SAY IS WHEN I PUT OUT THIS CALL
YOU NEED TO MENTION THAT ANY TECHNOLOGY YOU INTEND TO USE SO THAT AT LEAST IF WE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION YEAH
IF IF WE GAVE THEM A WHOLE MONTH OR JUST OVER A MONTH THEN
IF WE GAVE THEM THE WHOLE MONTH THAT'D GIVE US HARDLY ANY TIME
SO IF WE GAVE THEM SAY TILL MID MARCH THAT WOULD BE GOOD
SO GIVE THEM SOMETHING LIKE GIVE THEM SOMETHING LIKE TEN DAYS OR WHATEVER TO GET THE TITLE IN
JUST ENOUGH THAT WE CAN SEE WHETHER IT'S INTERESTING OR WHAT KIND OF AREA IT FITS INTO
BUT I THINK W
UH
THIRTY ONE OH NO IT'S TWENTY EIGHT THIS
SO IF WE HAVE IT LIKE A MONDAY MONDAY THE FOURTEENTH'D PROBABLY BE QUITE GOOD FOR THE FINAL DEADLINE
AND THEN UM IF I SEND IT OUT TOMORROW WE'LL SAY SOMETHING LIKE THE EL
SO GIVE THEM A W YEAH A WEEK FOR THE TITLE AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE ABOUT TEN DAYS FROM THEN TO ACTUALLY GET THE ABSTRACT IN
SO I'M SAYING A WEEK FROM WHEN I SEND IT OUT
OR IS IT GONNA BE ON THE BASIS OF THE TITLE DO THEY WANT MORE TIME TO WRITE THE ABSTRACT
THEY CAN SEND IT TO P. G. C. AT LING AS LONG AS WE CAN GET THE WH I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO THEN
I'LL GO AND SEE MIKE TH TODAY AND AND GET THE PASSWORD AND EVERYTHING
WE POSSIBLY HAVE IT BUT I'LL JUST SORT THAT OUT WITH HIM
'CAUSE UH SO FAR I'VE JUST BEEN USING MY OWN UH EMAIL ADDRESS
'CAUSE YOU CAN SEND FROM ANY EMAIL ADDRESS YOU LIKE
IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT YOU NEED TO P UH IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT WHEN THEY REPLY TO IT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO UH ACCESS IT
OH WELL THAT'S IT THEN
YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW BUT THE THING IS IF YOU WANT TO SEND THIS CALL FOR ABSTRACTS
BUT YOU CAN GO F IF IF YOU DID IT FROM WEB MAIL
YOU CAN JUST CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT FOR YOURSELF AND WHERE IT SA IT ACTUALLY HAS A SEND FROM ADDRESS
I'LL SEND IT FROM P. G. C. SO IF ANYONE REPLIES IT WOULD JUST GO TO THAT ACCOUNT AND ANY OF US CAN ACCESS IT AT ANY TIME
YOU YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR TWO HAVEN'T YOU
SO VERY QUICKLY THEN CAN WE ARRANGE A NEW TIME TO HAVE A MEETING
HAVE WE GOT ENOUGH TO BE GETTING ON WITH
SO I MEAN MAYBE M I MEAN IDEALLY I SUPPOSE WE'LL MEET AGAIN HERE
SO WE CAN WITH MELISSA AND WE'LL JUST SEND OUT AN EMAIL
AND UM YOU'RE GONNA WAS IT YOUR IDEA TO STICK THE BIT IN IT WHERE YOU SAY UM UH
IS IT WAS THAT A VOLUNTEERING YEAH OR GREAT
ACTUALLY HAVE AT THE WHOLE THING
THEN WE JUST SUBTRACT THE NUMBER OF SECOND AND THIRD YEAR STUDENTS AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST I'D I WOULD FAVOUR DOING IT JUST ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS
AND SO HOW MANY HOW MANY POSTERS AND TALKS ARE WE GONNA ACTUALLY GONNA GET IN
AND I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD RATHER DO A POSTER THAN GIVE A TALK
UH YEAH
BUT W WOULDN'T WE WANT TO ACTUALLY JUST LIKE DEDICATE AN AFTERNOON OR A MORNING TO BEING A POSTER SESSION
I MEAN THE JU JUST BECAUSE LIKE ONES THAT I'VE BEEN TO AS WELL UM
BUT THAT'S JUST JU I MEAN JUST BASED ON THE ONES THAT I'VE BEEN TO
THEY DID IT LIKE UM I HA I SHOULD HAVE FOUND THIS OUT
ARE YOU GUYS SECOND YEARS OR FIRST YEARS
SO N SO NONE OF US HAVE BEEN TO THIS BEFORE
OH YOU MEAN UM UH W ON THE OCTOBER THING
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WAS SAYING THAT EVERYONE WOULD DO IT JU BECAUSE ITS GOAL WAS TO GIVE THE NEW IN TAKE UH IDEA OF
UM WELL WE SHOULD FIND OUT IF UM GENERALLY THEY USE POSTER BOARDS IF THERE ARE SOME POSTER BOARDS THAT WE CAN GET AHOLD OF THEN THAT'S
I MEAN I GUESS THAT THAT WILL EVOLVE UH WHEN WE GET A RESPONSE FROM PEOPLE PERHAPS
AND IS THE THE OTHER MAIN GROUP THEN UM PHILOSOPHY
UM WEED OUT THE NUMBERS OR SHOULD WE JUST SAY TO THEM OH YOU KNOW WE'RE HAVING THIS THING ABOUT LANGUAGE AND
YOU KNOW IF YOU GOT SOMETHING YOU THINK ABOUT LANGUAGE COME TO
NO ONE WILL UNDERSTAND
OH I SEE RIGHT HE WANTS THEM THERE BECAUSE HE SO HE CAN MAKE IT
OH NO NO NO I WAS S I WAS SAYING JU JUST GIVE THEM A BIT LONGER TO GET BACK WITH THE TITLE
SAY GET BACK WITH THE TITLE BY THE SEVENTH
OH SO AM I
IS IT FIVE T IS IT ALMOST TWO
BUT I'LL TRY AND GET A GOOD ADDRESS TO SEND IT TO
SO THAT WAS A NOTE
BUT THE THE TEXT FOR THE ACTUAL CALL IS SHE GOING TO RE WORK SOMETHING OR UH SHE SHOULD
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE GLAD TO SEE KINDA THERE LINGUISTICS TO ADAPT
AB
THEY KNOW HER
I W WELL LET'S SEND OUT THE CALL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SEE WHAT REACTIONS WE GET
SEE IF WE HAVE TO PUT ON SOME RESTRAINTS
UP TO THREE BUT DON'T EXAGGERATE YEAH
I'M THINKING IF WE GO FOR SAY
SO THREE LECTURES EACH THAT WOULD BE UH THREE PER DAY TIMES THREE WILL BE TWENTY SEVEN
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
IN TWO THOUSAND IT WAS HELD SEPARATELY IN OCTOBER
THE INTENTION WAS TO USE IT AS A WAY TO INTRODUCE INCOMING POST GRAD STUDENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT'S RESEARCH CULTURE
HOWEVER I DID NOT PURSUE THIS IDEA THE FOLLOWING YEAR BECAUSE THE COMMENTS I RECEIVED FROM STUDENTS IN TWO THOUSAND WERE GENERALLY DISCOURAGING
ON THE OTHER HAND I LATER LEARNED THAT SOME STUDENTS DID FIND THE OCTOBER POSTER SESSION QUITE A USEFUL EXPERIENCE
BUT THE ULTIMATE DECISION IS ON OUR SIDE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SEE HOW IT DOES IT WORK OUT WITH THE POSTER SESSION
SEE WHAT HAPPENS
I THINK SOMEBODY'S MASTERS PROJECT TO LOOK IN HOW FAR ENGLISH IS ACTU UH OR IN HOW FAR ENGLISH IS A SHAPING INFLUENCE ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
OF
END OF MARCH
IN MY EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU USUALLY SHOULD HAVE IS SOME KIND OF UM WHAT'S IT OVER HEAD THINGO UM BEAMER
IN SOME CASES WE MIGHT IF IT'S REALLY TOUGH WE MIGHT BE IN NEED OF A OF SOME SOUND SYSTEM TO PLAY RECORDINGS
I COULD CREATE US ANOTHER CALENDAR
UH F I THINK IF THEY'RE REALLY SERIOUS
TO BE A BIT LATE WITH THE TITLE MIGHT NOT BE BAD BECAUSE IT WILL HELP THEM TO
GETTING ACCESS TO THE UH TO THE ACCOUNT
WE'VE GOT IT ALL WRITTEN DOWN
I THINK LATEST S SOON AS THE CALL IS OUT
BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE THE CALL THING WE HAVE THAT AWAY AND LOOK AT THE BOAR ORGANISATORIAL STUFF LIKE UH
SO THE THREE OF YOU AND LET'S SEE M UM MYSELF AND MAARIKA
UM BUT THE EXTRA STEP THAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO DO F IN THIS CASE IS TO LOOK AT THE SILENT REGIONS AND LISTEN TO THEM FOR EACH CHANNEL AND UM MAKE SURE THAT NO BACK CHANNELS WERE LOST FOR EXAMPLE
SO YOU CAN UM START S CHECKING BY Y WELL YOU YOU KNOW
GO DOWN HERE TO THE UH TRASCRIPTION TRANSCRIPTION TIER AND SELECT THAT IT SO THAT UH WHEN YOU PLAY
UM OTHERWISE IT IT'S LIABLE TO KEEP ON RUNNING AND YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE WHERE IT WHERE IT FINISHES
I YOU YOU COULD JUST LISTEN TO THE SPEECH SEGMENTS AGAIN AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS CORRECT FOR THOSE AND SO YOU COULD JUST HIT UM
HOW IT IF IF YOU WANNA MAKE YOUR JOB A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING YOU CAN D DO IT IN M DIFFERENT WAYS ON A DIFFERENT DAY
YOU'RE DOING SO THAT'S THAT'S THE ROLE OF THE CHECKER IS TO CHECK WHAT'S SAID IN THE SILENT REGIONS UH IN THE SPEECH REGIONS AND THEN MAKE SURE NOTHING WAS LOST IN THE SILENT REGIONS
AND IN THAT CASE IT WILL BE UP TO YOU TO USE THE AT SYMBOL
AND SO THAT UM ONCE YOU GO THROUGH ALL THE S UM SPEECH REGIONS AND ALL THE UM NON SPEECH REGIONS
AN O YOU COULD MAKE ANOTHER STEP OF DOING A SEARCH USING UM GOING UNDER THE EDIT MENU YOU CAN
DO A SEARCH FOR YEAH FIND REPLACE FOR OPEN PARENTHESES AND THAT'LL TAKE YOU TO ANY THAT IT ANY THAT THE FIRST TRANSCRIBER MIGHT HAVE MARKED OUT
SO THERE'S ONE
AND THEN YOU CAN JUST RESOLVE THOSE ALL ONE BY ONE AS AS A DIFFERENT SET OF UM CHANGES ALTOGETHER
JUST ONCE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH UM AND RESOLVED ALL THE OPEN PARENTHESES YOU CAN DO THE SAME FOR OP UH DOUBLE QUESTION MARKS
IF YOU CAN UM JUST GIVE IT YOU KNOW GIVE IT YOUR BEST GUESS IN THESE CASES
YEAH IT'S I WOULD UH IF YOU'RE V IF YOU'RE QUITE CERTAIN THEN I WOULD GO AHEAD AND UM TYPE WHAT YOU THINK IT WAS SAID
IF IF YOU V THINK THAT N Y THERE'S MAYBE A TH THIRTY PERCENT CHANCE YOU'RE WRONG OR OR MORE
SO MAYBE A GOOD IDEA WOULD BE TO LISTEN TO EACH CHANNEL ONE BY ONE DO LISTEN TO THE SILENT AND NON SILENT REGIONS AND MAKE ALL THOSE CORRECTIONS
YOU'LL YOU'LL KNOW ALL TOO WELL WHAT WAS SAID IN THIS MEETING BY THE TIME YOU
CHOOSE ONE IT C I MEAN Y THINK OF IT FROM A SPEECH RECOGNITION POINT OF VIEW AGAIN
WHAT IS MOST ROBUST FOR A SPEECH RECOGNITION AND AND LEAVE OUT ANYTHING SO YOU'RE WELL GEARED TOWARDS THIS TASK
SO UM THIS IS ONE I'VE GONE THROUGH
I'VE JUST DONE ONE CHANNEL
UM SO THIS PERSON DIDN'T HA UM TH OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT CAPITALISATION
WHATEVER UM MAKES SENSE TO YOU
UM BUT NO IT IT CAN CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT SEGMENT AND THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE
TH THESE ARE THINGS THAT I'VE AFTER CHECKING UM T EVERYBODY'S WORK UM THESE ARE THINGS THAT WERE COMMONLY LEFT OUT OR YOU KNOW MISC MIS TRANSCRIBED WHATEVER
SO I'LL GO OVER THOSE T AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE WHITE BOARD
SO UH THIS PERSON LEFT OUT A LOT OF END PUNCTUATION AND UM HERE'S A CASE WHERE I THINK SHE WAS TRANSCRIBING AN OUT BREATH UM OR POSSIBLY AN IN BREATH UH T UH IN AND USED THE HASH MARK
THAT'S N INFORMATION WE DON'T NEED
OH YOU KNOW THIS IS THE HEAD SET MIC AND I HEARD SOMETHING THERE
IT WAS BUT IT WA YEAH IT WAS A BIT OF A YEAH IT WAS CREAKY SO YEAH F UH
YEAH WELL I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IM LET'S SEE WAIT
S THERE'S THERE'S ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT MORE IN THERE THAN THAN I HEARD BEFORE
SO I ADDED THAT IN
MISSED FALSE STARTS UM MISSED M
I MEAN THE IT I THINK SYLLABLES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR FOR TH
BUT IF YOU C IF IT'S SAY FOUR REPEATED UM IF THE WORD IS REPEATED FOUR TIMES UH THEN THAT'S NOT TOO HARD TO COUNT
WELL THERE AGAIN F UH THINK ABOUT ROBUSTNESS AND SPEECH UH RECOGNITION AND IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
IT YOU'RE MARKING IT AS A FRAGMENT AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT
UM I MEAN AND AND FOR THAT MATTER A LOT OF N NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS' REALISATIONS AREN'T GOING TO BE SO TRUE TO UM
LIKE UM I'M THINKING OF I I'VE USED THIS EXAMPLE BEFORE
THERE'S A GUY WHO SAYS PROJECT INSTEAD OF PRODUCT AND UH IT'S SOMETHING LIKE PROJECT AND IT'S PROBABLY JUST HIS HIS PRONUNCIATION OF OF
SO SO UH I M I MARKED THAT AS A M UH MISPRONUNCIATION OR S OR SOMETHING TO FLAG ANYWAY
OH EVALUATION
YEAH I KN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO S TELL YOU ABOUT N UM CERTAIN SPEAKERS
SO OOP I LOST MY LAPEL LAPEL MIC
SO JUST REALLY KEEP AN EAR OUT FOR THOSE
BUT UM THIS THIS SECOND PASS WE SHOULD REALLY TRY TO CATCH ALL OF THEM OR AT LEAST MOST OF TH YEAH
SO AT THIS POINT THE UM THE ONLY FILE THAT'S BEEN CHECKED IS MELISSA ONE THAT MELISSA DID AND THAT WAS CHECKED BY ME
UM SO W WE WE'RE STARTING FRESH WITH THESE AND YOU KNOW
CHANGES LIKE THAT THAT WERE JUST ANNOUNCED WE'LL WE'LL BE ABLE TO CATCH FOR THESE FIRST PASSES
SO YEAH Y IF YOU DO SEE UM SOMETHING LIKE UM U. H. M. FOR UM YOU YOU WOULD CHANGE THAT TO THE REGULARISED V VERSION
UM AND WE JUST CH YOU KNOW THIS IS ARBITRARY BUT WE HAD TO CHOOSE SOMETHING AND NOT LET IT GET TOO CONVOLUTED WITH UM WITH CHOICE
I'M NOT SEEING WHERE THIS IS
AND THERE WAS A VOWEL IN THERE BUT YOU NOTICED THAT SHE JUST USED THE AND THAT'S FINE
THAT'S SHE WOULD LIKE SEE
SHE
I DIDN'T GO F BACK FAR ENOUGH
AND YES ANY G
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT SPELLINGS I I I THINK I M MIGHT HAVE SENT AN EMAIL TO THIS EFFECT JUST CHECK THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY ONLINE
UH AND THAT'S THAT WILL BE OUR GUIDE
UM SO A AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS IS JUST MISSING AN E. CETERA
YOU COULD TAKE THIS AS AN EMACS FILE AND RUN A SPELL CHECK ON IT
SHE I THINK SHE MEANT TO USE THE INFINITIVE BUT SHE JUST LEFT OFF THE TO
A SPACE BETWEEN SHE WOULD LIKE SEE
SHE WOULD LIKE SEE
SO SHE T SHE TRANSCRIBED THAT AS WOULD
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE GONNA BE CA
NO YOU TRY TO KEEP IT AS TRUE TO WHAT'S BEING SAID
THEN USE UM
UM M I'D YOU DON'T WANT TO B UM BE PRESCRIPTIVE AND AND TYPE WHAT YOU THINK THEY SHOULD'VE SAID
SO ANOTHER MISSED FALSE START
THERE WAS CREAKINESS ON THE SHE
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO MARK THAT AS A SEPARATE SOUND
IF YOU HEAR JUST LAUGHTER ON EITHER SIDE YEAH DO THAT
S
I'LL FIGURE THAT ONE OUT AND PUT IT UP ON THE WIKI OR EMAIL YOU
MM SEE
THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF THINGS I WANNA POINT OUT
UH YEAH
UM Y THAT MAY BE BUT I PROBABLY WOULD FLAG IT
IT'S GONNA BE YOUR CALL IN A LOT OF THESE CASES
HERE'S A CASE OF UM WHERE I FOUND IT N UH FOUND A CASE OF DISCONTINUITY
UNMARKED FOR HER
MAYBE THAT WASN'T UH HER RE STARTING MAYBE SH THAT WAS
THAT W THAT WAS MY REFLEX AT THE TIME TO PUT THAT THERE
UH YEAH YEAH
YEAH I WOULD TYPE IT AS TWO
OH LET'S SEE THERE WAS A C
THERE IS AN EXTRA LITTLE SYMBOL IN HERE AND THAT WAS JUST KINDA CARELESSNESS
UH NO
UH
OH SO YOU HAVEN'T PUT A HYPHEN THERE
FOR G FOR THAT S TYPE OF SITUATION
I I LIKE COMMAS AND THEN UH STEVE RENALS WHO'S PROJECT MANAGER HAD A LOOK AT M I THINK IT WAS MY TRANSCRIPTIONS
WHAT ARE ALL THESE COMMAS DOING IN HERE
SH OH SHE SPELLED CUTEST UM WITH AN I. SO THAT THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I POINTED OUT
SO SHE TYPED UH OUR AND I I DIDN'T QUITE HEAR THAT
OH I WAS S I WAS SUGGESTING THAT SH IT BE UH INSTEAD OF OUR
WELL OH SHE'S
THE BUT THIS BEING A HEAD SET MIC CHANNEL M MAY MAKE IT EASIER TO HEAR
UH
OH GOD
IN FACT THEY REPLACED ALL THE LAPEL MIC FILES ON THE M. M. M. SERVER WITH HEAD SET MIC FILES
BUT BUT APPARENTLY OTHER THAN THAT THEY'RE JUST AS GOOD
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA GO THROUGH UH ANY MORE OF THESE BECAUSE I I THINK I'VE GOTTEN THROUGH MOST OF THE TYPES THAT I MEANT TO POINT OUT
UH RIGHT RIGHT
I D I DID SEE S I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME GUIDELINES FOR ANOTHER CORPUS AND I DID SEE SOMETHING ABOUT PROPER NAMES
UH YEAH QUITE POSSIBLY BUT SINCE IT'S COMING FROM ICSI UH IT'S COMING FROM IDIAP IN SWITZERLAND
YEAH IT W IT SHOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO GET BUT IT'S IT'S ONE OTHER STEP
BUT BUT THERE SHOU WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE A W A MEANS OF DEALING WITH PROPER NAMES WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS OR HOW IT MIGHT BE SPELLED AT ALL AND AND FLAGGING THAT IN IN SOME WAY
OH JUST JUST TYPE MISTER FULLY
I M. I. S. T. E. R. YEAH
AND SAME WITH MISSUS M. I. S. S. U. S. I BELIEVE
IS IT I BELIEVE I BELIEVE CHECK CHECK THE DICTIONARY
UM WELL I'M SURE THERE'S A SPELLING IN THE O. E. D. YEAH
UM IT SHOULDN'T BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE LEFT LIKE THE ASTERISK WILL BE LEFT FOR THE PROC THE SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING
IF YOU IF IF F IT'S A FOREIGN WORD AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS JUST ENCLOSE IT IN CARETS
O. C C O. CAPITAL O. CAPITAL K. AND HUGE NO NO I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE MISSED THAT IN THE IN THE GUIDELINES
SO NO UM N NO TRANSCRIBER WILL BE CHECKING NO CHECKER WILL BE CHECKING THEIR T OWN TRANSCRIPTION
AND ON SO I'LL JUST GO UP TO THE BOARD DO I HAVE TO KEEP THIS STUFF ON
SO OH OKAY
OKAY S ALRIGHT
RATHER THIS IS A LIST OF THINGS TO DO AS THE CHECKER
AND AS PART OF THAT YOU WANT TO UM CHECK THE BOUNDARIES
AND OH BY THE WAY THIS SHOULD BE UM
AND WITHIN THIS CHECKING THE SPEECH SEGMENTS YOU WANT TO LISTEN FOR OR LOOK FOR MISSED UM
LOOK FOR MISSED PUNCTUATION
IT'S JUST SO IF SOMEBODY SAYS THE THE THEN IT'S JUST THE THE
THOSE ARE THE COMMONLY MISSED THINGS
AND THEN UM LOOK FOR CASES OF MIS TRANSCRIPTION
SEEMS SO SILLY TO BE WRITING THIS ALL
BUT ANYWAY MIS TRANSCRIPTION SO MAKE SURE IF THE SPEAKER SAID WILL
UM THA CASES OF ELLIPSIS WHERE UM MAYBE THE TRANSCRIBER TYPED THEM BUT REALLY WHAT WAS SAID WAS 'EM SO WHERE YOU USE THE APOSTROPHE
AND LOOK FOR CAPITALISATION I'M NOT GONNA GONNA DO ANY MORE OF THIS
UM USE THE O. E. D. TO CHECK ON THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT
OH WAS THAT
W
I USED TO ALWAYS LOVE SMELLING MARKERS
WHAT ELSE DID I FIND
UM THE SO MAKE SURE THE DA THE DASH THE HYPHEN WHATEVER YOU CALL IT
IS BEING USED APPROPRIATELY IN CASES OF DISCONTINUITY UM BUT NOT IN STUTTERING LIKE I SAID
AND AND DON'T USE IT WHEN THE UTTERANCE IS CLEARLY CONTINUED IN THE NEXT SEGMENT OR WHATEVER
AH
I WOULD JUST TRY TO KEEP SEGMENTS VERY MANAGEABLE UM AND A BUT U YOU KNOW USE THESE WAVE FORMS TO HELP YOU
AND YOU CAN ADJUST THE RESOLUTION SO THAT OH
AH RIGHT THAT'S GOOD
YEAH SO TO HELP YOU MAKE CUTS JUST LOOK LOOK F YOU KNOW USE THIS WAVE FORM AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT L LOSING ANY SIGNAL INFORMATION
BUT UM CUTTING SEGMENTS DOWN IS A L A LOW PRIORITY BUT IT IT WILL HELP ULTIMATELY I THINK POST PROCESSING WISE
BUT I D I THINK FROM A SPEECH RECOGNITION POINT OF VIEW IT SHOULDN'T MATTER THESE SEGMENTS BEING WHATEVER LENGTH THAT THEY HAPPEN TO BE
UM AND THEN YEAH JUST M UM BE SURE AFTER YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE FOUR CHANNELS TO UM DO A SEARCH ON ALL THE UNKNOWNS
THE WAY WE'LL BE ALLOCATING THIS IS IS THE SAME AS BEFORE TH IT'S GONNA BE ON THE TH THE SAME THE SAME PAGE JUST FURTHER DOWN
SCROLL DOWN YOU'LL SEE W ALL THE FILES
YEAH I'D SAY FOR NOW UM W WE DON'T EVEN HAVE UH MUCH NEW STUFF TO BE UH TO BE GONE OVER FOR A FIRST PASS
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE D UM DO THIS SECOND PASS
M I THINK I HIGH TYPED HIGH IF IT'S HIGH PRIORITY
UM SO D THOSE WOULD BE THE ONES YOU WOULD FOCUS ON FIRST OBVIOUSLY
AND WHEN IT COME YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE FILE NAME IN ANY WAY
SO TH
RIGHT BUT IT'S BE S Y SIMILAR
BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE CREATING A THEIR A GUY JONATHAN IS CREATING A WEB FORM FOR YOU TO DO THIS ALL VERY SIMPLY AND LIKE JUST UM UPLOAD EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE UH UP UPLOAD THE FILE THAT YOU'VE TRANSCRIBED AND AND YOU'LL BE NOTING WHETHER IT'S THE FIRST PASS OR THE SECOND PASS AND Y YOUR NAME UM AS THE PERSON WHO DID THAT PARTICULAR PASS
AND THEN WHEN YOU CHECK IT IN IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE REGISTERED EVEN THOUGH THE THE FIRST PASS WAS CHECKED IN WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS CHECKING IN BUSINESS
IS IT THREE MONTHS I THINK
BUT IT'S JUST A LOGISTIC THING WITH PERSONNEL WHERE WHERE WE HA THAT WAS THE MINIMUM WE WERE ABLE TO OFFER A CONTRACT FOR
I MEAN THE WHOLE POINT W OF KEEPING WELL AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO YEAH
WORK OUT USE OF YOUR COMPUTER WITH THE OTHER PERSON THAT'S FINE YEAH
YEAH I DON'T SEE WHY NOT AS LONG AS YOU'RE YOU KNOW DOING YOUR GIVEN SET OF HOURS FOR THE WEEK
I THINK YOU'LL ALL BE PAID UH WELL HAVE YOU NOT
IF YOU HAVE ANY TH PROBLEMS LIKE THAT MM UM SEE CAROLINE HASTINGS
I MEAN IF IT'S FOR THIS JOB AND AND GETTING PAID THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARY AND CAROLINE HASTINGS OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU SORT THAT OUT
I'M HERE FULL TIME NOW SO I'LL I'LL BE HERE M MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AND I L I LEAVE AT FOUR NOW
HE'S UH FOUR AND HALF MONTHS
YEAH WELL UM ONLY AS OF FRIDAY ACTUALLY
IT TOOK LI IT LIKE THE THIRD TIME 'TIL I THOUGHT OH YOU'RE SAYING F. FIVE
WE JUST STARTED OUR SPEECH RECOGNITION ASSIGNMENT JUST NOW
YOU'RE AN S. L. P. PERSON
AS IN LIKE IT'S
AND SOMETIMES WITH THE I WOULD BE THINKING ARE YOU ANTICIPATING A OR YOU'RE YOU T TRYING TO SAY THE AND YOU'RE JUST SAYING THE THE THE THE THE
THEN I THINK OKAY I'LL LET THAT IN BUT IF IF IT COMES OUT AND LIKE ONE WORD IS
AH
HOPE HE'S NOT INVOLVED WITH THESE ACTUALLY
IT'S EASY TO 'CAUSE YOU'RE SO USED TO T T TUNING THEM OUT
DO A QUICK PASS OF THE MAIN SECTIONS AGAIN AND THINK AH YEAH
THAT WOR THE HYPHEN
SO I HAVE TO RE DO THE MEETINGS FROM THE MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING
WAS SHE WAS THAT A LIKE W R REAL DEFINITE I'M STARTING A NEW SENTENCE HERE
'CAUSE I'D SOMETIME IF IT SOUNDS LIKE HE COULD CARRY ON SAYING THE WHOLE SENTENCE I SOMETIMES DON'T HAVE A HYPHEN THERE
BUT IS IT A T ANY HESITATION
JUST ONE TO THE NEXT DOOR YEAH
IS THAT A
SHE WAS CUTTING OFF RATHER THAN SAYING SHE WOULD LIKE S TO HAVE SEE SOMETHING
'CAUSE THE LOOSE UH IS CONTINUING FROM ONE SENTENCE ISN'T IT
'CAUSE I'VE NOT BEEN SURE IF THERE'S AN IF THE LAUGHTER'S BEEN CUTTING EVERYTHING OFF
JUST UM IF IT'S HER I JUST CAUGHT THE END OF IT AND
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE IF HA I DID THAT ONE 'CAUSE IT IS WELL A LANGUAGE TEACHER WOULDN'T LOW ALLOW THAT TO MO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STAGE
IF SOMEBODY THAT I'D POINT IT OUT TO THEM
JUST IF
UH AS IN A WHOLE S LIKE BACK CHANNEL
OH D
OH I JUST NOTICED THE THE RANDOM YEAHS LIKE WITH HAVING THE HYPHEN BEFORE THEY'RE S
YEAH THAT HA UM THE SECOND ONE FROM THE TOP
NO I'VE I'VE TH I'VE SORT IT OUT
I I READ SOMEBODY'S P. H. D. PROPOSALS YESTERDAY AND S AND IT'S SAYING WELL YOU COULD HAVE A COMMA IN HERE AND ONE THERE AND
I'VE HAD ONE PERSON WITH A DODGY HEADPHONE WITH WITH DODGY SOMETHING WHERE MOST OF THE TIME IT'S IT'S AS IF THEY'VE GOT THEIR HAND OVER SOMETHING
YES THE UH YEAH IT W IT'S FOR
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SAY IS THIS ON AND THEY HIT IT A FEW TIMES
HOW ABOUT NAMES THAT SOMEBODY SAYS THE NAME OF SOMEBODY AND YOU THINK WHO
OH IT
IS THAT
OH YEAH 'CAUSE EVERY TIME SOMEBODY'D BE GOING OVER THERE YOU'D HEAR ALL THIS SOUND OF
OKAY WHEN IT'S JUST AS 'KAY BUT IT'S AT THE BEGINNING OF A SENTENCE SHOULD THE K. BE CAPITALISED
OOH
AH
THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE IT S 'CAUSE I I APPEAR TO HAVE NOTHING
BUT I WAS HEARING STUFF BUT I G THERE WAS NOTHING ON MY WAVE FORM
I THINK I'VE GONE A BIT FAR IN CUTTING MINE DOWN AT THE MOMENT
IT DO YES
AND THE CONTRACTS SAY EIGHTH OF MAY WHICH IS LONGER IN ADVANCE THAN WHICH IS A GREATER AMOUNT OF TIME THAN SIX WEEKS
OR ELSE YOU CAN LIKE P YES
I'M HAVING SORT SOME S I'M HAVING TO SORT SOME TAX STUFF OUT BEFORE I CAN EVEN SEND MY STUFF IN
'CAUSE IT TOOK ME IT WAS ABOUT TO TAKE ME HALF AN HOUR WELL IT DID WHEN I WAS LIKE JUST GOING THROUGH THE FORMS AND FILLING IN ALL THE DETAILS
A COUPLE OF HOURS GETTING PHOTO COPIES OF DEGREE CERTIFICATES TO GIVE YOU FOR YOUR FILES IF I'M JUST GONNA BE HERE A GOOD TH THEY WON'T I THINK IT TH AT ONE PLACE IT SAID GIVE US COPIES OF DEGREES
OH MAYBE I'M GETTING MIXED UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT WANTED A
OH SO IT IS YOUR BABY THEN ON THE PHOTOS
OH DO WE HAVE TO TICK OUR NOTE THING AGAIN WHEN WE FINISH THIS
SO WE SO ARE WE CHECKING WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN TRANSCRIBED ALREADY AS WELL AS THE SILENCES
WHEN YOU GET LIKE UM SOMEONE'S TALKING AND THERE'S THEY SORT OF PAUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE THAT'S LONG ENOUGH FOR IT TO PUT A BREAK IN
BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY SORT OF CARRYING ON THE SENTENCE DO YOU HAVE TO CAPITALISE EACH TIME YOU TRANSCRIBE A BIT IF IT'S MID
YEAH JUST CHANGE IT TO UM
OH R OKAY
'CAUSE I GET I GET QUITE PROLIFIC WITH MY COMMAS AT TIMES
E. S. T.
SOMETIMES YOU GET LIKE AN UH AND IT G YOU'RE NOT SURE IF IT'S AN AN A. YEAH OR AN M IT YEAH
AS AN
YEAH DO IT AS OKAY
M. I. S. T. E. R.
M. I. Z.
SO UM ABOUT UM FOREIGN WORDS WHAT DO WE WHEN WE'RE CHECKING UM IF WE COME UP SOMETHING SO WE JUST LEAVE IT AS
I GOT ONE WHICH I IT WAS FRENCH SO I KNEW HOW TO EX SPELL IT
OR COULD WE JUST CHANGE IT TO AN AT BETWEEN THE CARETS
SOMEONE'S GONNA FIND SOME OF THOSE
W
IS THAT ZOOM IN
I TURNED THE PAGE
SO IS THIS THE PRIORITY THEN
ONCE WE ACTUALLY GET INTO THE LIKE UM EASTER HOLIDAYS 'CAUSE WE'RE AT HAVING LECTURES AT THE MOMENT
IT'S USUALLY A CONTEXT PROBLEM BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES IF IT'S NOT INTELLIGIBLE YOU EITHER TEND TO BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT IT TO FIT THE CONTEXT
I'VE DONE THAT TOO
UH UH WHEN I DID MY MASTERS UM I TOOK UH S. P. ONE AND S. P. TWO WITH SIMON KING
I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY THE ONLY CASE WHERE YOU DON'T OR WHERE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO CAPITALISE RIGHT
AND HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO LISTEN TO IT REALLY UNTIL YOU'VE GOT THE EXACT NUMBER OF A THINGS RIGHT
WELL IT'S NOT THAT THE WORD IS IF THE WORD WERE THE WHOLE WORD WERE BEING USED FOUR TIMES
AND THAT KIND OF THING SO IT'S I THINK IT WAS A WORD STARTING WITH D. AND THE PERSON WAS GOING OR S YOU KNOW
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT THAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT BUT UM THE ONE THERE'S ONE I'M TRANSCRIBING RIGHT NOW
AND THERE'S ESPECIALLY ONE THERE THAT UM I THINK HE'S EASTERN EUROPEAN AND I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING AT ALL
BECAUSE I'M EASTERN EUROPEAN AND UH BUT IF WE WOULD JUST PLAY IT I THINK TO A RECOGNIZER
THEN WHAT HE SAYS YOU KNOW THE WAY HE REALISES WORDS SOUNDS NOTHING AT ALL LIKE IT IT SHOULD BE
NO IT'S LESS OF A S IT'S LESS OF A STRESS
IT'S REALLY LIKE UH HIS UH I DON'T KNOW JUST THE PHONEMES SOUNDING DIFFERENTLY
OH I THINK I'VE TRANSCRIBED HIM AND I HAD PROJECT AT ALL UM EVOLUTION CRITERIA
AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DIALOGUE IT DAWNED ON ME THAT HE ACTUALLY MEANT EVALUATION
YEAH BASICALLY TH I THINK JUST DO YOUR BEST AND HOPE FOR THE BEST
UM SORRY I'M JUST SEEING THIS WITH THE T. V. THERE IS T. UNDERSCORE V. UNDERSCORE
OKAY SORRY THEN I'VE DONE IT WRONG SO FAR
YEAH I THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW NOT EVEN MAYBE TO WELL
IF I TH IF YOU THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF A SYNTACTIC TREE
IT N DOESN'T HAVE TO GO BACK ALL THE WAY TO THE S. NODE
BUT IT JUST M IT MIGHT GO BACK TO THE LAST NODE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IS IT ONE WORD OR IS IT TWO WORDS
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE ET ALII
NO NO NO LIKE ET W YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE UH WHEN YOU HAVE A CITATION AND YOU SAY ET AL IT MEANS AND OTHERS
OH IN IT IS OKAY YEAH
BUT UH TO JUST USE SIMPLE EMACS IT WILL UH BASICALLY MARK UM ALL THE WORD FRAGMENTS FOR YOU AND UH YOU KNOW
BUT SEE IS A ACTUAL FULL WORD SHOULDN'T IT THERE B SHOULDN'T THERE BE A SPACE BETWEEN SEE AND THE HYPHEN
AFTER THE NO THE THE C. AND THE HYPHEN SHOULDN'T THERE BE A SPACE
UM THE WOULD AND W
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE SAYING WILL OR WOULD
YEAH HE IT IT'S HIS YEAH
WHEN THEY SAY INSTEA YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY SWALLOW UP THE THE LAST BIT
UM OKAY SO WHAT ABOUT IF A WHOLE UTTERANCE IS UTTERED WHILE LAUGHING
OR IN WHAT I USU WHEN THAT HAPPENS WHAT I DO IS I PUT LAUGHTER IN FRONT
SO THEY SAY EITHER SO THERE IT'S REALLY NOT AMBIGUOUS WHETHER IT'S JUST LAUGH FOLLOWED BY AN A NORMALLY SPOKEN UTTERANCE OR WHETHER IT'S AN UTTERANCE SPOKEN WHILE LAUGHING
I THOUGHT ASTERISK IS SOMETHING WHERE UM IT'S C IT'S PRONOUNCED AS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WORD LIKE EVALUATION AND EVOLUTION
YEAH CAUSE I THIS IS A VERY FREQUENT MISTAKE THAT NO NATIVE SPEAKERS MAKE TO SAY CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF CIRCUIT
IS PUSH BUTTONS TWO WORDS
YEAH WITH SOME PEOPLE IT ACTUALLY LEADS TO SOME REALLY SCREECHING NOISES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO LOUD OR PROBABLY THE MIC IS SO CLOSE
I HAD THIS ONE UM IN ONE OF THE FIRST DIALOGUES I DID THE G THIS GUY CALLED ED
YOU COULD UH ALWAYS SEE THE WAVEFORM ACTUALLY YOU KNOW
OH I HAD ONE GUY ONE OF THE PROJECT MANAGERS WAS UM HE HAD A REALLY WEIRD ACCENT AND HE WAS CALLING UM ONE GUY MISTER ED
HIS NAME WAS ED AND IT TOOK ME A WHOLE TIME TO YOU FIND OUT THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY MISTER ED
MI U. S. MI MISSUS THE MISSUS
OH SO EVEN IF WE KNOW WHAT THAT WORD MEANS WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO RIGHT
YEAH 'CAUSE I HAVE THERE IS ONE DIALOGUE WHERE I THINK TWO SPEAKERS ARE FRENCH LIKE ONE IS DEFINITELY FRENCH
AND I KNOW SHE IS SAYING AND THEN SOMEBODY S SAYING SOMETHING TO HER AND SHE GOES COMMENT AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THAT SO YEAH
OH NOT REALLY BUT ON COMMENT YEAH
OH THE WHITE BOARD MARKER HAS A CAMERA AS WELL
SO IF SOMETHING IS A MINUTE AND THREE SECONDS I CAN STILL HAVE IT RIGHT
YEAH ON THIS ONE
NO NOT NOT THE OTHER ONE THIS ONE
OH AND YOU CAN ALSO IF YOU GO TO SIGNAL AND
UM THE VERTICAL ZOOM YOU CAN ADJUST THAT AS WELL SO IF IT SEEMS TOO FLAT FOR YOU OR YOU CAN'T REALLY
WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT I KNOW ABOUT THIS FOR THE SUMMARISATION I HAVEN'T DONE THIS WITH UH TRANSCRIPTION YET
IS YOUR HUSBAND NOW A STAY AT HOME DAD
I THINK THEY PROBABLY OUGHT TO BUT UH THEY WELL
THEY'VE ONLY JUST STARTED REALISING THAT TREATING THIS AS A LEGAL ISSUE IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT WAY TO LOOK AT IT
I MEAN I YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY COULD BUT IT'S R IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE HARD WORK
THE LAW ISN'T VERY CLEAR
LIKE THE CITIZENS ADVICE BUREAU IS SO HARD TO ACTUALLY GET ACCESS TO BECAUSE THEY'VE THEY HAVE SO MANY CASES AND SO FEW PEOPLE
M
SO BASICALLY FOR HIM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HE WHAT PROGRESS HE'S BEEN MAKING AND THEN FOR US TO UM FOR HI FOR HIM TO DESCRIBE WHAT WORK HE INTENDS OVER THE NEXT PERIOD OF THE PROJECT
WHERE YOU THINK SOME OF THEM ARE LIKE A BIT LIKE DIALOGUE AND SOME ARE A BIT LIKE MONOLOGUE
SO WHAT MEASUREMENTS WOULD YOU APPLY TO UM FIND OUT WHICH IS WHICH
S
SO SO AM I RIGHT IN THINKING YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN SEGMENT MEETINGS MAYBE INTO TWO T TYPES OF AREAS INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE
SO WHAT ARE TH WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INTERACTIVE AREAS
SO W SO OKAY SO BUT YOU JUST SAID I THINK THAT YOU WOULD CHARACTERISE SHORT TURNS AS BEING THE NON INTERACTIVE PARTS
I MEAN UH C ARE YOU IS IT OKAY IF WE TALK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE 'CAUSE I'M CONFUSED
OR OR DO YOU GET A C
I THINK WE SHOULD UH HAVE INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE ON THE BOARD AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT PROPERTIES GOING TO EACH JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR WHAT THE TWO MEAN
UH
SO Y DO YOU MEAN ALL OF THE SPEAKERS ARE INVOLVED IN IT
IS IT SUFFICIENT FOR TWO SPEAKERS
OKAY BUT THAT'S N YOU CAN THAT'S DEFINITIONAL RIGHT
SO SO I MEAN YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY CONSIDER THAT TO CHANGE THE TURNS
THOSE ARE JUST BACK CHANNELS
WELL DO Y
IT DEPEND IF YOU HAD SO A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ALL JUST GIVING INFORMATION AND OPINION AROUND THE TABLE AND THEY NEVER ACTUALLY ASK QUESTIONS OF EACH OTHER
BUT THE TURNS WERE ACTUALLY QUITE SHORT WHICH ONE WOULD IT BE
SO WEI XUN QUITE TAKES QUITE A STRONG POSITION ON UM THIS UM DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO UM KINDS OF GROUP ACTIVITIES BECAUSE HE SAYS THAT THEY ADMIT DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANALYSES
AND UH WHAT YOU GET IS A MESSIER VERSION OF THE ARGUMENT STRUCTURE BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME ARGUMENT IN THEIR BRAIN YOU KNOW FOR THIS
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP UM THAT IN MIND
BUT TO THE GROU DEGREE THAT A GROUP IS BUILDING AN ARGUMENT TOGETHER
AND SO IT'S MAYBE IT'S NOT R. S. T. UM BUT IT'S UM MORE AKIN TO UM I DON'T KNOW IS IT TOOLMAN
ARE ARE THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF IT FOR THIS ANALYSIS REALLY THAT SUBSTANTIVELY DIFFERENT THOUGH
OKAY SO THE R THE RELATION NAMES AREN'T AREN'T RIGHT BUT UM
WELL THE RELATION NAMES ARE LESS IMPORTANT
THAT THAT'S MORE APPARA APPARATUS THAN YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY NEED FOR UM FROM DOING THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS
YEAH C I JUST THINK WELL I MEAN IT ALL OF THESE THINGS WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER A NEW GENRE OF UM OF UH ACTUAL DATA
THAT'S THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THESE
I JUST PREFER IT TO BE ONE THING RATHER THAN TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE THINGS AND THEN THE ADDED EXPLANATION OF WHY IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE SAME THING APPLIED TO BOTH HALVES
I MEAN IT REALLY IS MORE IN THE SPIRIT UH OF THE R. S. T. ISH RELATIONS THAN UM THAN IN THE DAMSEL KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS
AND THAT IS THE CRITICAL THING THAT WE'RE MISSING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO UM UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE MEETINGS
SO WE WOULDN'T WE WOULDN'T WANNA DO THE SAME THING AS WHAT UM SHE DID IN THIS CASE
OH DOES IT
OKAY UM I HAVEN'T SEEN IT ON THAT THIS KIND OF DATA
RIGHT OKAY BUT ARE WHAT I MEAN IS YOU KNO WANNA MAKE SURE YOU GET THE ARGUMENTATIVE RELATIONS HOWEVER YOU DO IT
I'M JUST SAYING WE NEED THE CORRECT ONES FOR TH THE STRUCTURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS
WELL WHAT YOU'LL NEED IN THE END IS SOMETHING OPERATIONAL
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN USE TO ACTUALLY SEGMENT MEETINGS INTO THE UM THE AREAS THAT YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR THIS ANALYSIS RIGHT
SO UM IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR TO ME WHAT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ARE
UM I MEAN WE HAVE W WE HAVEN'T DONE PAST WORK HERE ON SEGMENTING MEETINGS IN THAT WAY
IT'S IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE MEETING UM TAKE SOME TAKE EQUAL PART IN IT AS OPPOSED TO UM LIKE THE HIGHEST STATE IS PEOPLE IN THE MEETING JUST DRIVING IT AND AND UH THE OTHER PEOPLE FOLLOWING WHATEVER THE HIGH STATE IS PEOPLE WANT
WE COULD USE TO UM TO DO THIS KIND OF SEGMENTATION IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE ANALYSIS RIGHT
W BUT WE NEED CLEARER DEFINITIONS OF WHAT THE DIFFERENT THINGS ARE HOW MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF OF UM ACTIVITIES ARE THERE
YOU KNOW IS IT JUST INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE OR IS THERE ARE THERE THERE MORE GRADES OF SHADING THAN THAT
AND UM YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU EXPECT IN EACH
DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS WHETHER SOMETHING IS KNOWLEDGE OR OPINION IN THE WAY IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROUP PROCESS
I I SORT OF HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN THE VIEW THAT UM THAT WELL PEOPLE AREN'T VERY GOOD AT AT THIS KIND OF RATIONALITY YOU KNOW
WELL YOU YOU CAN'T DEFINE 'EM THAT WAY
YOU OFTEN DISCOVER THAT THEY WEREN'T ACTUALLY SOLID FACTS ANYWAY YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE I THINK THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THESE IS KIND OF FLUID
SO YOU'RE YOU'VE GOT BOOKS THAT HIGH ON YOUR DESK
SO Y UM I'M SORT OF GETTING THAT YOU THINK THERE IS A LACK IN THE UH THEORY TO DO WITH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE AT THE MOMENT
UM THE WELL ARE YOU THINKING IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE READ THIS LITERATURE
AND THEN THE REMAINING MOVES UM WILL UH CONTRIBUTE TO EITHER THE UM THE MEETING OF THAT DISCOURSE GOAL OR THE DECISION NOT TO BOTHER WITH THAT DISCOURSE GOAL
BUT I TH I THINK THERE ARE OTHER OTHER PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT EXCHANGE STRUCTURE AND DESCRIBED IT IN THESE TERMS IN A WAY THAT SHOULD REALLY SUIT YOUR NEEDS
SO SO IS YOUR COMPLAINT LESS ABOUT UM LESS ABOUT KNOWING WHAT MAKES AN EXCHANGE AND MORE ABOUT KNOWING HOW YOU PARAMETERISE EXCHANGES FOR THIS GENRE
SO SO HAVE HAVE YOU TRIED I MEAN UM I KNOW OF ONE PREVIOUS ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH WHAT EXCHANGES ARE NEEDED FOR F UM SOME KINDS OF INDUSTRY MEETINGS
THAT EXCHANGES ARE CLEAR IN UM WELL I THERE'RE CLEARER IN WHEN YOU'VE GOT FEWER PEOPLE
SO WHEN YOU'VE JUST GOT INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND YOU KNOW THE OR THERE'S A CLEAR TASK THAT THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO AND THEY'RE FOCUSSED ON THAT TASK
AS IS NORMAL IN DIALOGUE ELICITATION LIKE MAP TASK OR LIKE YOUR
SO UM THE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION MIGHT BE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE CATALOGUE OF EXCHANGES IS FOR REAL MEETINGS BECAUSE UM OR FOR THESE DECISION MAKING MEETINGS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY EXCHANGES
TH COULD TELL YOU THAT THERE IS NO CASE WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR INITIATION AND RESPONSES THAT'S GONNA WORK YOU KNOW
'CAUSE YOU COULD GO THROUGH AND SEE THAT UM ACTUALLY THE PATTERN OF OF ADDRESSING DIFFERENT DISCOURSE GOALS IS TOO DISPERSED TO UM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT KIND OF MARK UP
OH SO THAT'S NOT A PHYSICAL ACTION RIGHT
WELL THERE ARE VERY FEW UH SCHEMES FOR MARKING UP EXCHANGES ON ACTUAL DATA RIGHT BECAUSE UM PEOPLE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED IT VERY IMPORTANT
BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW OF OTHER CASES WHERE PEOPLE BOTHERED MARKING ANYTH ANYTHING HIGHER LEVEL THAN THE MAP THAN THE MOVE STRUCTURE
YOU DON'T KNOW OF
ON YEAH I'VE S UH SORRY
UM BUT IT C IT'S NOT BEEN VERY POPULAR CAR PROBABLY 'CAUSE IT MAKES UM
WELL THE FIRST STEP IS FIND OUT IN THE WHAT HOW MUCH OF THE MATERIAL DOES THE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING COVER
B TH BUT THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD THAT ARE MOVING THAT DIRECTION LIKE MARTIN
AND ALSO WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS THE THEORETICAL CLARITY ABOUT WHAT AN INITIATION AND A RESPONSE IS
BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOOKING AT UM WHETHER PARTS OF THE MEETING ARE HIGHLY INTERACTIVE OR NOT SO INTERACTIVE IS UH LOOKING AT WHAT SORT OF TASK THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO AT THE MOMENT
ARE THEY DOING UM UH I ARE ARE THEY UH I AS IN THE KICK OFF MEETING JUST EXCHANGING INFORMATION TO GET STARTED WITH A PROJECT OR ARE THEY UH ACTUALLY ADDRESSING SOME SPECIFIC DESIGN UM CRITERIA AT THE MOMENT
AND SO THAT IS MUCH MORE LIKE UM THE UM THE LITERATURE FROM MCGRATH ABOUT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES GROUPS GET INTO
OR YOU EXPECT DIFFERENT KINDS OF RELATIONS FROM SOME OVER ARCHING SET IN UM THOSE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES
UH
P S
IT'S NOT GOING TO PRESENT ANY S ANY MICRO STRUCTURE
SO IT'S JUST GONNA SAY FROM HERE TO HERE THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING
W
IT'S N
THAT'S NOT NO THOSE WELL THAT'S INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
AND THE MEETING ACTIONS ARE MEANT TO B UH BECOME MORE UM SEMANTIC AND MORE THEORETICAL THAN THE KIND IDIAP HAVE TRADITIONALLY USED
WELL YOU MIGHT NEED THE MEETING ACTION SEGMENTATION IN ORDER TO KNOW WHERE WHAT UH WHAT AREA YOU'RE CIRCUMVENTING FOR SO
IT'S JUST EXCHANGE STRUCTURE IN THIS AREA THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND THEN THAT'S A SOLID BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE NEXT BIT OR SOMETHING
UM BUT W WELL TIME'S GETTING ON
SO Y SHOW WHAT ELSE
WELL M MARKING UP EXCHANGE STRUCTURE IF IF IT'S THERE AND IF UM IF YOU'VE GOT A WORKING SCHEME FOR IT IS RELATIVELY CHEAP
YOU KNOW THAT WE NEED EXCHANGE STRUCTURE MARKED UP ON X. AMOUNT OF DATA AT THIS POINT IS KNOWING UM WHERE YOU'RE HEADED WITH THIS I THINK
I THINK IS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HERE
FIGURE OUT HOW TO BOOT STRAP IT SO WE WE GET THIS UM UH HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SELL THAT AS A AS A PROJECT GOAL YOU KNOW
'CAUSE PEOPLE ARE GONNA SAY EXCHANGE STRUCTURE SO WHAT
SEE 'CAUSE I THINK THAT UM JUST TO MAKE THIS M MORE EFFICIENT
BUT I THIS MORE GOAL DIRECTED MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE IT EASIER TO UM BRING THESE THINGS TO PUBLICATION IN THE LONG RUN RIGHT
AND IN FAVOUR OF UM THESE THESE MORE ARGUMENTATIVE THINGS
SO I MEAN UH I DO THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND WHAT THE FINAL GOAL IS SO THAT YOU CAN PLUG THIS INTO SOMETHING AT THE END AND AND UM SHOW SOME BENEFIT OF HAVING THE MARK UP
WE HAVE TO GET THE HUB STUFF THROUGH BUT UM YOU KNOW HE'S N NOT READY WITH AN ANNOTATION SCHEME THAT CAN BE USED AT THE MOMENT ANYWAY
YEAH IT UH AND IT'S TOO DIFFERENT A GENRE YEAH
BUT YEAH THEY'RE SURE TO DO THAT
IN THE M
Y
UM WELL I DON'T REMEMBER THAT ABOUT THE W I MEAN THE
OH BUT THAT WAS ABOUT WHAT TASK THE PERSON DOING THE BROWSING WAS GONNA DO
LIKE UH JOIN A MEETING LATE AND CH UM CATCH UP ON WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE MEETING SO FAR BE AT HOME WAITING FOR THE WASHING REPAIR GUY
BUT YOU KNOW TH THEY WEREN'T CONCENTRATING
AND YOU DON'T THINK THAT CAN BE DONE IN OPEN DOMAIN AT ALL
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT ONE
SO YOU'RE ADVISING WEI XUN THAT HE SHOULD BE USING LIKE ANY ONTOLOGIES AND PROPOSITIONAL CONTENT THAT UM D. F. K. I. AND T. N. O. BANK IN THE C. V. S. REPOSITORY OR OR NOT
W WE'VE GOT FIVE ISCA MEETINGS ACTUALLY WHICH ARE STILL UH AN ELICITATION TASK BUT THEY'RE NOT OUR DOMAIN
AND IT MAY BE EVEN MORE MECHANICAL THAN THAT BASED ON THE UM EXAMPLES WE'RE SEEING FROM D. F. K. I.
AND IT YOU KNOW SO Y I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW
SO IT I LIKE THINGS KINDA TIDY
SO HOW MUCH WORK IS THERE LEFT AND WHEN DO WE ACTUALLY NEED IT BY WOULD BE USEFUL TO DISCUSS
BUT THEN HE THERE WERE TWO POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOR UH FOR DOING THIS ON THE AMI DATA
DO THE PENN TREE BANK AND THEN CREATE THE CHUNKS OFF THAT OR YOU COULD CHUNK DIRECTLY
AND IT WASN'T CLEAR TO US WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWO METHODS WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS
IS TH IS THAT SIMILAR ENOUGH THAT THAT THIS SAME METHOD COULD APPLY THAT WE DERIVE CHUNKS OFF THE H. P. S. G. OUTPUT
I THINK YOU MIGHT LOSE A LOT IN YOU KNOW THIS STEP
SO Y THAT SORT OF ASSUMES THAT WE THINK IT'S BETTER TO DO THIS BY DERIVING CHUNKS FROM UM SOME PARSED FORMAT THAN JUST HAND CHUNKING THE STUFF
SO LET'S TRY IT THIS WAY
AND THEN THAT THAT PUTS OFF THE QUESTION OF UM WHEN DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS TO WHEN WE GET H. P. S. G. STUFF RIGHT
SO CAN YOU ASK UM D. F. K. I. WHETHER THEY CAN GIVE US A COUPLE AMI MEETINGS RUN THROUGH THEIR H. P. S. G. PROCESS
OH I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE I'VE MISSED
SEE I WASN'T THERE
IF IT DOES ASK D. F. K. I. EITHER FOR DATA OR A TIME SCALE AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH DATA YOU NEED IN ORDER TO DO THAT
WELL I GUE IF WE DID A CHUNKED VERSION OF THE AMI DATA AND STUCK IT INTO C. V. S. UNDER THE AUTOMATIC CONTRIBUTIONS THEN UM PEOPLE WOULD END UP USING IT
SO THE QUESTION IS AT WHAT STAGE SHOULD WE PUT THAT IN
NO BUT HE'S RELYING IT ON IT TH THIS SUMMER
OH FOR THE NEXT ONE MM-HMM
IS THAT THE TIME SCALE YOU'RE THINKING OF OR
UH THAT'S ALL I THINK
UH
SO AND THEN WE CAN EVALUATE ON THE ICSI YOU KNOW PRETTY EASILY
YEAH EVEN IF IT'S JUST A YOU KNOW ON A WIKI THE UM THE REFERENCES AND THEN WHY THEY'RE RELEVANT RIGHT
BUT THAT WOU THAT WOULD HELP US BE A LOT MORE SPECIFIC AB THAN THAN JUST UM YOU KNOW
BUT UH SO THE PRACTICAL ACTIONS YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE'RE GONNA GO AWAY AND DO
I'M NOT IN MONDAY BUT THE OTHER DAYS I'LL BE AROUND
S
AND I WHAT I REALLY WANNA DO CONCENTRATE JUST NOW IS IS FINDING OUT THE HOW WE'RE GONNA HELP UM WEI XUN WITH WITH MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS
AND WE CAN PUT THAT ON A WIKI OR WE CAN DO IT SOME OTHER WAY
UM AND THEN UH HOW DO WE YOU'RE ACTUALLY SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS TAKING ALL OF THE THE THE MOST IMPORTANT REFERENCES FOR UM FINDING ARGUMENT STRUCTURE THAT MIGHT I EVENTUALLY BE OF SOME USE TO A MEETING BROWSER AND TRYING TO LOOK AT ACTUAL DATA AND APPLY AND AND SEE LIKE WHICH ONE HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA DO WITH THIS PARTICULAR DATA
YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'D WANT AND LOOK YOU'RE GONNA NEED UM THIS KIND OF DIALOGUE OR ARGUMENT STRUCTURE FOR IT
I MEAN I'M SURE THEY'RE NOT ON THE WEB YET
SO SO WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH THE REQUIREMENTS LIKE THAT AND DID DID YOU THINK THAT'S THAT WAS REASONABLE TO AFTER THAT TO TRY AND UM ACTUALLY
BUT W
UH
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU WERE GONNA DEFINE THIS MORE ON THE SLIDES TO COME OR IF THIS IS AS MUCH AS YOU'RE GONNA TELL US
SO SO WHAT DID YOU HAVE MORE ON LATER SLIDES ABOUT THIS
SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T OTHER THEO SO FOR
BUT THOSE ARE VERY THOSE ARE REALLY DIFFERENT UM THEORIES THAT ARE AT ARE TRYING TO GET AT DIFFERENT THINGS AND IT AND THEY ADMIT OF M YOU KNOW
YEAH THE ENTIRE THEORY IS BASED ON INTENTION AND THE INTENTION OF ONE INDIVIDUAL
SO YOU KNOW WITHIN A SPEAKER TURN YOU CAN HAVE THINGS LIKE EXPLANATION AND CAUSE AND ALL THAT
WELL HER THE RELATIONS HAVE A S
D YES BUT SO I MEAN THE RELATION NAMES IT'S NOT THE NAMES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IT'S THEIR SEMANTICS THAT ARE IMPORTANT RIGHT
NOW I DON'T REMEMBER WAS WHICH SPEAKER YOU IN THE C IN THE EXAMPLE SHE SHOWED YESTERDAY
WAS IT THE CASE THAT THE REPRESENTATION OF THE UTTERANCES AND THE RELATIONS INCLUDED WHICH SPEAKER WAS UH
'CAUSE SHE DID REPRESENT UM DISCOURSE STRUCTURES 'CAUSE THESE WERE THE VERBMOBIL SCHEDULING DIALOGUES
SO THE UTTERANCES IN THE IN THE REPRESENTATION WERE UTTERED BY TWO DIFFERENT PARTIES THAT WASN'T THE YOU KNOW
IN THE IN THE EXAMPLES SHE SHOWED US THERE WERE THERE WAS SOME THAT WAS JUST YOU KNOW ONE PARTY
I MEAN I 'CAUSE YOU WERE SAYING YOU'RE JUST GONNA YOU YOU'RE YOU WANNA LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW VERY LOCAL STUFF
BUT I'M JUST Y I MEAN WHAT YOU CAN IMAGINE SOMEONE SAYING WELL HOW DID THEY DECIDE TO MAKE IT BLUE
SHE SAID THAT HE SAI YOU KNOW TO ANYWAY I YOU KNOW I MEAN I I DON'T THINK ESPECIALLY UH
SO IF YOU LOOK AT AMANDA STENT'S THESIS AND THE ANALYSIS THAT SHE DID SORT OF WITHIN A TURN SHE USED SOMETHING LIKE R. S. T.
D SO I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE IMPOR I THINK IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO GO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FIGURING OUT WHAT KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS WE WANT AND THEN FINDING AND
YOU KNOW LIKE SETTING DOWN WHAT THE CONSTRAINTS ARE ON THE ANALYSIS GAME
HE'S BEEN LOOKING AT THE DATA OKAY S TO GOOD
YEAH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO KNOW WHAT M
WHO
WELL I MEAN I THINK THAT UM W IT I DON'T KNOW UH W IT'D PROBABLY GET TO RE HEAR YOU KNOW
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO KIND OF GET AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE CANDIDATES ARE M IF THERE'S LIKE TWO OR THREE THAT WE THINK ARE GOOD CONTENDERS
OH SO THAT WAS IT ON DIALOGUE OKAY
SO UH IT'S VERY UNCLEAR TO ME WHY YOU THINK EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION IS MORE PRINCIPAL T UH DID YOU I MEAN WHAT DID YOU HAVE SPECIFIC SCHEMES IN MIND THERE
SO HE HAS THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW ADOPT UM SO BASICALLY IT'S TO
YOU KNOW COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING YOU KNOW MORE THAN ONE PERSON INVOLVED AND TRYING TO CHARACTERISE THINGS AS UM
NO SO SO THE COCONUT PROJECT IS A PROJECT THAT I DID WITH RICH THOMASSON AND BARBARA DIGINIO
BUT YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT NO IN VERY MUCH DETAIL
SO UM WHILE THESE SCHEMES MAY NOT HAVE THEY HAVE SOME ES OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS THAT YOU NEED TO CHARACTERISE UM JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING
SO WHILE TH UM
WELL YOU CAN ADOPT IT YOU CAN WELL I CAN'T REMEMBER YOU KNOW OKAY BUT HE HAS UH HE HAS A TAXONOMY YEAH RIGHT
WE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME LOOKING AT IT AND IT DID STRIKE ME THAT FOR JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING THERE W THERE WERE SOME GOOD IDEAS
AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT YOU KNOW CL YOU KNOW CLARK ON JOINT ACTION
I MEAN I THINK ACCOUNTS FOR A LOT OF THE WAYS IN WHICH UM YOU KNOW THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE THI ARE THINKING
ON MEETINGS WITH SOME OF THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN DONE ON COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING 'CAUSE THERE'S ELEMENTS OF EACH THAT SEEM REALLY IMPORTANT
AND I THINK TH
SO I MEAN ALL THE CONVERSATIONAL ANALYSIS STUFF I MEAN THOSE GUYS NEVER COUNT ANYTHING YOU KNOW
I MEAN THEY'RE UH PS SO THEY SEE A PATTERN AND THEN THEY THINK IT'S KINDA CUTE AND THEN THEY SCOUR THE WORLD FOR THIRD TURN REPAIRS YOU KNOW
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SAY HOW OFTEN DO THOSE HAPPEN
IF YOU L IF YOU TAKE THE EXCHANGE STUFF IT'S NOT GONNA D QUITE DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT
I MEAN I I REALISE IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WEI XUN GOT UP AND WENT TO THE WHITE BOARD
BUT I D WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT THOSE MEETING ACTIONS
WELL I THINK WE SHOULD APPROACH IT BOTH WAYS
SO I MEAN I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT SOMETHING AT THIS LEVEL NEEDS TO BE THERE
I MEAN AND TO ASK QUESTIONS LIKE WHO DISAGREED OR WERE THERE ANY COUNTER PROPOSALS OR WHATEVER
EVEN THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS YOU NEED SOME KIND OF MARK UP LIKE THIS
YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE
TASKS SORT OF PUT ON YOU KNOW SORT OF AS PART OF THE OFFICIAL AGENDA
SO BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE UM WERE THERE ANY COUNTER PROPOSALS TO THE BANA YOU KNOW BANANA SHAPE OR WHATEVER
UM UH OR TO SOME SPECIFIC YOU KNOW RECOMMENDATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT
I MEAN YOU KNOW THOSE YOU KNOW STRIKE ME AS CL CLEAR THINGS THAT YOU KNOW
SO IT WOU IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET SOME OF THESE THINGS ON THE OFFICIAL AGENDA AND SAY LOOK
NO M SO
AND I THINK WE WOULDN'T WANNA NECESSARILY DO THIS ON ICSI DATA
I THINK THE ICSI DATA IS TOO TOO COMPLEX AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH REAL DECISIONS MADE YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD CLEARLY IDENTIFY
BUT UM I THINK W IT YOU KNOW W WELL SO ONE THING THAT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING IS THE I THINK TO ME
IS THE UM WHAT CAN YOU DO BECAUSE PRESUMABLY THE UM D. F. K. I. FOLK OR SOMEBODY IS GONNA MARK UP A LOT OF THE DATA WITH SORT OF TAGS ABOUT ONTOLOGY
SO WE KNOW YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WILL HAVE GONE AND BY HAND AND SORT OF MARKED UP SOM SOMETHING L LIKE SHALLOW SEMANTICY KINDS OF THINGS RIGHT
OR MAYBE DEEPER SEMANTICY THINGS BUT THAT BUT YOU KNOW
LET'S TAKE THESE SEMANTIC FEATURES INTO OR THESE FEATURES INTO ACCOUNT AND SEE HOW WELL WE DO WITH THE THE LEARNING
I MEAN T. N. O. IS AND D. F. K. I. IS RIGHT
AND THERE WILL ALSO BE PRESUMABLY SOME KIND OF TASK HIERARCHY MODELLING GOING ON IN I MEAN 'CAUSE THE WHOLE BROWSER WORKING GROUP UM FINAL UM SORT OF PRESENTATION ON THAT SECOND DAY WAS ABOUT
WHICH SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE REALLY HARD IN AN OPEN DOMAIN
THEY'D SPENT THE MORNING TALKING AND THEY CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA
NO THOSE ARE THE S THOSE ARE THE SCENARIOS
THOSE ARE THE USER SCENARIOS
THE TASK WHAT WHAT HE CAME BACK AND SAID THAT AT THE END
AND AND THE DOMAIN TASKS OKAY THEY'RE NOW THEY NOW HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MANY BUTTONS TO PUT ON THIS THING
UH IT IT'S REALLY SCARY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO IN AN OPEN DOMAIN WHERE YOU DON'T WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TASKS ARE
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO FIGURE THEM OUT UH VERY RELIABLY
I DO BUT THE WHOLE PROJECT IS YOU KNOW FOCUSSED ON AMI HUB DATA AS THEIR FIRST PRIORITY
N NO NO NO NO NO
BUT I MEAN IF THE IF THE IF THEY HAD TH THEY HAD THIS SORT OF EPIPHANY AT THE END OF THIS MEETING WHERE THEY DECIDED WELL WHY ARE PEOPLE BROWSING THIS
WELL I THINK WHEN HE DOES RE WHEN HE DOES LEAR THESE LEARNING EXPERIMENTS HE SHOULD DO 'EM TWO WAYS
BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH OR WITHOUT
ALEX WAS SHOWING UM YESTERDAY WELL WITHOUT KNOWING THE HEAD WORD OF THE UTTERANCE AT THE LEAF
YOU KNOW YOU GET THESE KINDS OF RESULTS AND WHEN YOU ADD THAT IN YOU GET THESE OTHER KINDS OF RESULTS
UM SO I THINK IF WE HAVE THOSE FEATURES IT'S YOU KNOW
IT'S A RARE ORP OR RARE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRY ONE HEAD TO HEAD AGAINST THE OTHER
I MEAN A ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE A CLOSED DOMAIN I MEAN WE WE CAN'T USE ANY DOMAIN INFORMATION NECESSARILY
UH
I MEAN THERE PROBABLY ARE A BUNCH OF ISSUES LIKE IF YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED HOURS OF MEETINGS AND THEY ALL TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS
SURE SO WE MIGHT FIND THAT WHEN WE MOVE FROM WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS OPEN DOMAIN BUT ON THE HUB
IN THE BEGINNING YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT YOU WERE DOING THIS CHUNKING UM AND YOU'RE DOING IT ON THE ICSI DATA
BUT THIS WAS DID YOU SAY IT TH WASN'T PICKED UP IN AMI OR YOU I I I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT W
THA THAT'S FINE
SO THAT'S STILL ON THE AGENDA TO DO AT SOME POINT
I MEAN SO I MEAN WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW S CHUNKING INTERACTS WITH THE AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION YOU KNOW
AND I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CHUNKING SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF SO IF IF YOUR DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTER SAYS THERE'S THERE'S A SEGMENT HERE
BUT YOUR CHUNKER SAID NO
THIS IS A COHERENT CHUNK THEN Y Y YOU KNOW W I MEAN MAYBE THEY COULD WORK TOGETHER TO DO A BETTER JOB THAN
OH AFTER UH RIGHT
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WELL W
WELL HOW MUCH AMI
BECAUSE M
SO WE GOT STUCK AT SOME POINT ON EVALUATION OF CHUNKING RIGHT
AND SO IT IT MI
OKAY IF THERE IF THERE WAS IF THERE WAS HAND LABELLED DATA THAT YOU COULD EVALUATE AGAIN SO TRAIN ON SOME AND EVALUATE ON SOME
SO IF YOU HAD SOME ICSI DATA THAT YOU COULD MAYBE USE I DON'T KNOW
UM AS A WHAT'S THE N THERE'S T THERE'S A TRAINING SET AND THEN THERE'S THE DEVELOPMENT SET AND THEN THERE'S THE TEST SET
BUT YOU KNOW W H I MEAN I CAN SEE WHY WEI XUN DIDN'T WANNA SPEND HIS TIME CHUNKING ICSI D
IS ANYBODY GONNA PARSE
IS ANY GONNA TRY TO ANYBODY TRY TO PARSE THE AMI DATA
WELL THEY'RE USING THE E. R. G. RIGHT
IT'S I'M T IT'S PROBABLY EASY TO DUMB DOWN THE H. P. S. G. PARSE TOO
AND YOU MIGHT WANNA TALK TO ALEX TO FIND OUT IF SOMEBODY'S ALREADY DONE THIS TURN REDWOODS STUFF INTO TREE BANK STUFF SO THAT THEY CAN COMPARE
WELL THE GOOD THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THEN YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH AND PARSE YOU'LL BE GETTING THE SAME CHUNKS AS WHEN YOU DO THIS PROCESS AUTOMATICALLY
'CAUSE THE PROBLEM W WHEN YOU GO THROUGH AND HAND DO IT IS THEN SUDDENLY YOU INTRODUCE YOUR AUTOMATIC METHOD AND YOUR ACCURACY GOES CAN GO WAY DOWN
THEY TALKED ABOUT IT AT THE MEETING THAT WE WENT TO IN
WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER THE N THE F THE RIGHT NAME OF THIS PLACE
I I I KNOW YOU MISSED A MEETING AND S AND SO THERE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN YOU MISSED THE ONE IN T. N. O.
ON ON WHICH PROJECT
SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT AND SEE WHAT THE PARSE TREES LOOK LIKE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU THINK OH THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAP THESE INTO PENN TREE BANK STYLE BRACKETING
SO IT'S IT'S WORTH ALSO TALKING TO HER ABOUT THAT
YOU KNOW I MEAN THE TYPICAL THING IS TO DO LEAVE ONE OUT CROSS VALIDATION WITH YOU KNOW EIGHTY NINE DIALOGUES
OKAY SO I TRAINED ON EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEN OR I TRAIN ON ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE AND OKAY BUT WE SHOULD SPEAK TO STEVE
I THINK CHUNKING COULD HELP AS YOU MENTIONED NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION
YOU GET THESE VERY BIZARRE RESULTS BECAUSE THE DATA IS NOT REALLY VERY GOOD
SO UM BUT I AND NOBODY HAS EXPRESSED LIKE MASSIVE INTEREST IN T IN CHUNKING
THE TH NOT TO HAVE NOT TO HAVE IT DONE BUT JUST TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT COULD INTERACT WITH AUTOMATIC DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTATION
UM AND WE I GUESS WE SHOULD TALK TO YOSHI ABOUT ABOUT IT IN RELATIONSHIP TO NAMED ENTITIES
SO ONE THING THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVEN'T READ I THINK WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE JEAN YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW HERE'S A COUPLE OF YOU KNOW HERE'S THE TWO MOST RELEVANT WORKS THAT I'VE READ OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW TO JUST
JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT GONNA GO REA OFF AND READ ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME
SO IT JUST IT JUST MAKES IT A LOT EASIER UM TO GET THAT
I THINK IT'S A REAL ADVANTAGE THAT WE'VE READ DIFFERENT THINGS AND COME AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT SIDE BECAUSE I THINK THIS HA THEY THE THE PREVIOUS APPROACHES HAVEN'T REALLY
I WILL SEND YOU OR WE CAN YOU KNOW
CHAT OFF LINE FOR A MINUTE A ABOUT A LIST OF THINGS THAT I THINK YOU REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT
M
WELL I THINK WE NEED TO UM LIKE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER UM FACTOR IN WHAT THIS MIGHT BE USED FOR IN THE END
AND SO I THINK GOING THROUGH THE PRESENTATIONS THAT UM WERE GIVEN AT THE WORK PACKAGE SIX MEETING WHERE UM AND I THINK IT WAS UM IT WASN'T WHA WAS IT ANITA OR WAS IT OH I'VE FORGOTTEN HER NAME
AND THEN STEVE PRESENTED UM THE RESULTS OF FOLLOWING PEOPLE AROUND AND LOOKING AT HOW THEY USED THEIR NOTES FROM MEETINGS
BUT JUST TO HAVE TO KEEP SOME OF THESE GOALS IN MIND 'CAUSE THEY'RE T O ONE SCHEME MIGHT LET YOU ANSWER THIS SET OF QUESTIONS BUT WOULDN'T HELP YOU AT ALL WITH ANOTHER SET OF QUESTIONS
SO SHOULD WE EXPECT THAT ALL THE SLIDES FROM LIKE THE WORK PACKAGE SIX MEETING OR THE JOINT WORK PACKAGE FIVE WORK PA WILL BE U UP ON ONE OF THE WORK PACKAGE WEB SITES
SOME OF THIS WAS PRESENTED IN AT LEAST THE ONE SPIDER PHONE OR THE SECOND SPIDER PHONE TELECON I WENT TO FOR WORK PACKAGE SIX
SO IF THEY'RE NOT ON THE WEB WE CAN TRY TO LOOK AT THAT
WH
AND STEVE M AND HIS I'VE FORGOTTEN THE NAME IS IT WAS IT SIMON HIS YEAH
BUT I WOU WOULD HOPE THAT'S ON THE WORK PACKAGE SIX WEB SITE AS WELL
I DO AS I ONCE HE'S READ A COUPLE MORE I MEAN HE'S JUST COMPLETELY MISSED OUT THE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING WORLD
OR T OR OR TWO AND SEE THIS ONE GIVES YOU THIS AND THIS G AND CAN'T YOU KNOW ARE THEY FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE
IS THAT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU DO YOU THINK
IS THAT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU TO TO READ AND THINK ABOUT
IF Y IF IF IT'S TOO TIGHT YOU KNOW I THINK M WE CAN SAY FOUR
OR ARE YOU GONNA BE ON HOLIDAY
SO WHEN ARE YOU GONNA BRING THIS BEAUTIFUL BABY IN TO SEE EVERYBODY
J BECAUSE UH AFTER TALKING TO JANE UM JUST UH WE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS WHETHER UH MEETING ACTION WILL BE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS TOPIC SEGMENTS
SO UM IT WOULD BE GOOD TO UM T RIGHT NOW I'M DOING THIS
AND THEN DO TOPIC SEGMENTATION AGAIN TO SEE IF THE BOUNDARY ACTUALLY COINCIDE WITH EACH OTHER
YEAH IF IF THAT THAT DO THEN MAYBE WE CAN TALK AGAIN WHETHER UM I IT IT MAKE SENSE
AND UM SO FAR UM I S THINK UH IT'S UH IT I THINK IT IT'S A STILL UM ABOUT THE S ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL OF SEGMENTATION WE'RE TALKING HERE
I WANT TO SEE
ALRIGHT IS IT IT'S READY
FROM UH LAST YEAR I WAS UH UH S UH SUPERVISING THE ANNOTATION OF SEGMENTATION
SUMMARISATION UH UH WITH JEAN UH OF THE I UH IC ICSI CORPUS AND UH UH UH ON THE OTHER HAND UH I W N UH DID S SOME VERY PRELIMINARY WORK ON CHUNKING THE SWITCHBOARD CORPUS
BUT UH THAT WAS NOT UH WELL PICKED UP IN THE AMI CORPUS WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE
SO UH AND CURRENTLY I'M MORE INTERESTED IN SEE UH UH YEAH ANALYSING THE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS
'CAUSE MEETINGS IS A LIT DIFFERENT FROM NORMAL TEXT OR A N A NORMAL DIALOGUE OR MONOLOGUE
THE BIG QUESTION THAT I'M CONCERN HERE IS WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UTTERANCES IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS
OR HOW DO WE ANALYSE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE RIGHT ABOVE UTTERANCES INSTEAD OF UH THOSE HIGH LEVEL INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE OF DISCOURSE
THE DIALOGUE ACT WHICH WE'RE CURRENTLY UH WORKING ON OR UH AND UH FOR MEETINGS
YEAH SO I'VE MENTIONED UH UH BEFORE THAT MEETINGS IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM UH MONOLOGUE AND UH DIALOGUES
BUT UH FOR SOME PART PART WHERE THE INTERACTION IS VERY WEAK UH JUST UH LIKE THE UH CHAIRMAN OR PROJECT MANAGER IS MM
UH UH AND ALSO OTHER PR UH PARTS LIKE UH THE BACK CHANNELS WITHOUT ANY UH SEMANTIC CONTENT UH FROM OTHER PARTICIPANTS
SO YEAH SPEAKER CHANGE IS
YEAH YEAH B BUT UH SH SHORT UH TURNS UH LIKE MM OR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR MIGHT BE THE UH SEG SECOND TYPE OF INTERACTIVITY
THAT MIGHT NOT BE ANALYSED AS A UH MONOLOGUE BUT AS A DIAL UH NO NO NO WRONG UH NOT AS DIALOGUE BUT AS UM A MONOLOGUE
SO FOR THAT PART UH FOR THAT KIND OF BACK CHANNELS WE CAN JUST SKIP THAT AND UH UH TO NOT TREAT THEM AS INTERRUPTIONS OR SOMETHING LIKE
IF IF IT'S UH JUST SOME KIND OF BACK CHANNEL OR IT'S JUST A SIGNAL SIGNAL THE S THE SPEAKER IS LISTENING OR IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON YEAH
UH YEAH
IF WE GO FURTHER WE MIGHT DISTINGUISH UH THE INTERACTIVITY BETWEEN TWO F THREE OR ALL THE GROUPS
S YEAH YEAH ACTUALLY 'CAUSE UH I'VE LOOKED UH
WE MIGHT UM YEAH NEED A MORE STRICT OR FINER UH DEFINITION OF INTERACTIVITY
YEAH JU UH FOR THIS USE OF THE UH FOR THE USE OF THIS TERM FOR THE INDICATOR OF THE UH DEGREES OF INTERACTION
AND ALSO 'CAUSE UH I HAVE UH READ SOME OF THE M. O. T. A. UH CORPUS
UH SO FOR SOME PART OF TH THAT KIND OF MEETINGS UM UH SEVERAL UTTERANCES OR DIALOGUE ACTS ARE JUST UH TAGGED AS STATEMENT
UH YEAH
YOU COU YEAH
YEAH I TO UH JUST WE NEED TO SEE UH HOW WELL WE COULD WORK OUT OF THE UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE
IF WE NEED MORE THEN WE MIGHT USE SOME MORE FINER UH F FINER UH DEFINITION FOR INTERACTIVITY
UH
BUT UH IN THESE TWO STRANDS OR WORK THEY UH JUST COME UP WITH A LIST MAYBE NOT UH EXHAUSTIVE
SO UH I'M BEEN THINK ABOUT UH IF WE COULD COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF MORE PRINCIPAL SCHEME UH TAKING SOME OF THE UH INFORMATION IN THE UH UH UH IN THE UH INTERACTION UH INTO ACCOUNT
BUT UH WHEN THE SPEAKER IS UH PRE UH IS UH TALK ABOUT WHAT HE FEELS WHAT HE THINKS
IS PROPOSING SOMETHING OR S UH THEN OTHER SPEAKERS MIGHT MIGHT CHAN CHALLENGE HIM OR HER
BUT UH THAT MIGHT B BE SOME DIFFERENCE INTER INTERACTION PAR PATTERNS
'CAUSE UH FOR INFORMATION IF WE UH SOMEBODY'S UH SEEKING SOME INFORMATION THEN HE UH ASK SOME QUESTION AND UH THE ONE KNOWS WILL UH GIVES GIVES THE ANSWER
MM SEE 'CAUSE UH SO FAR I'M S STILL LOOKING FOR A UH SO CALLED PRINCIPAL SCHEME FOR THE INTERACTION UH FOR THE INTERACTION
BUT UH THEY HAVE NO UH NO CLASSIFICATION JUST TO COME UP WITH OKAY SO UH YOU MEAN UH
ALSO AT GENEVA SCHOOL THEY I DON'T THINK THEY LIST SOME KIND OF EXCHANGE
BUT UH THE UH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE UH AND UH YEAH EXCHANGE IS FIRST UH DEVELOPED IN UH SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONAL GRAMMAR ALONG THE UH UH HALLIDAY AND AND MARTIN'S WORK
THIS IS I YEAH W
SO FROM UH UM MY ANALYSIS OF THAT KIND OF DIALOGUES I COULD SAY THAT THERE'S ONLY THERE ONLY FOUR BASIC UH EXCHANGES DEPEND ON THE INFORMATION UH DIRECTION OF THE INFORMATION FLOW
THAT IS MAIN UH UH INFORMATION PROVIDER UH WHILE THE CUSTOMER IS THE INFORMATION SEEKER MAINLY
UH THE SPOTS THEY'RE GOING TO UH VISIT AND ALSO ON THE UH KINDS OF UH VE UH VEHICLE OR OR TRANSPORTATION YEAH
YEAH YEAH S YEAH YEAH
A AND ALSO S IN 'CAUSE IN THE MEETINGS UH THE SPEAKERS MIGHT MIGHT REPORT SOMETHING UH THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND UH UH UH UH TALK ABOUT TH WHAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DOING AND ALSO PLANNING SOME FUTURE ACTIONS
JUST UH FOR MY UH READING OF THE UH I. I. S. ONE O. EIGHT UH FOUR MEETING SERIES
OKAY SO NO FURTHER UH INFORMATION IS HERE
UH
UH
MM 'CAUSE UH SO FOR THE INFORMATION AND ACTION THE UH THE ACTION HERE IS NOT DIALOGUE ACT BUT UH SOME KIND OF UH UH PHYSICAL ACTION UH THAT UH THE UH PARTICIPANT'S UH I I IS GOING TO UH OR HAS DONE IN THE PAST
UH
SO THERE MIGHT BE THE UH S SPEAKER AND HE UH A HEARER
S SO THIS IS THE UH UH SO DIRECTION OF THE INFORMATION FLOW AND ALSO SO SPEAKER ROLE MIGHT BE FIRST UH PARAMETERS FOR THE UH EX UH INFORMATION EXCHANGES
UH NO NO
OKAY YEAH THAT'S N
UH YEAH
UH SO SO 'CAUSE I'M I MIGHT NOT FAMILIAR WITH THESE NA
SO UH IS IT THE WORK UH DESCRIBED IN THE C UH IN IN UH IN THE COCONUT PROJECT OR SOMETHING SIMILAR
Y YEAH LOOK UH NOT VERY MUCH DETAIL YEAH
NO NO IN SAA SAARBRUECKEN
YEAH I KNOW HER
OKAY SO WELL W
SO YEAH UH TH THE THE MAIN ACTIONS THAT UH YOU'RE TALK ABOUT I THINK MIGHT BE YEAH BUILT UP FROM THE EXCHANGE YEAH
JUST A LIST OF THESE UH RELATIONS
AND AFTER THAT UH WE W 'CAUSE THIS MM IS NOT IN THE HUB CORPUS
SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET L ALL THE MEETINGS ANNOTATED WITH THAT KIND OF
YEAH IF UH IF IT'S BASED ON THE UH UM DIALOGUE ACTS YEAH
BUT IT UH MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF UH UH INFORMATION WHICH MIGHT BENEFIT MEETING ACTIONS OR SOME MORE HIGH LEVEL DECISION MAKING OR PROBLEM SOLVING
SO AFTER THIS IF UH IF UH UH WE MIGHT DO SOME MM PE UH FROM HERE WE MIGHT BE SOME UH UH
YE YEAH
YEAH MA MA UH S
YOU KNOW TO SEE IF THE CHUNKER CHANNEL SWITCHBOARD WORKS WELL ENOUGH OR NOT
N NO
UH SO TH UH WE UH D. F. K. I. 'CAUSE THEY'RE WORKING ON SOME H. P. S. G. PARSING
IF THE
UH IF UH I'M I GUESS THAT IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT THEN WE MIGHT JUST UH WRITE ANOTHER SCRIPT TO DO THE TRANSLATION
I NEED TO LOOK AT SOME OF TO SEE
AT LEAST BIO
S SO THEN LATER YEAH
UH I M I MIGHT YEAH 'CAUSE UH JULIE AND THE BOY IS HERE
UH YEAH
SO I MIGHT TAKE TWO WEEKS OFF TWO WEEKS OFF IN UH MAY YEAH SOMETIMES YEAH
UH YEAH HOPE I HOPE SO VERY SOON
SEE
ON YOUR MARKS GET SET GO
SUCH A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE DONE THESE
WE DID A TRAINING SET DIDN'T WE AND THEN COMPARED TO SEE
AND THEN WE DID TH ALL THE REST OF THEM SEPARATELY
DO YOU RECKON IF WE GET A COPY WOULD THAT BE USEFUL
CAN WE GET BEN TO PRINT US OUT ONE
YES HE'S HE'S BEEN E EMAILED IT YEAH
OTHERWISE WE CAN GO ONTO OUR SYSTEM AND GET IT
I OH
BUT NO HOW LITTLE WORK WE DID
I'M DOING THAT AT YES
AND THEY FLY YOU TO GERMANY AND PUT YOU ON A FOUR WAY TELECONFERENCE WITH THREE PEOPLE IN CHILE
AND HAD THEY ASKED WE COULD HAVE DONE IT FINE AT A. T. C. AND SAVED ME HAVING TO TO GO TO GERMANY FOR A DAY
THEY HAVEN'T GOT THAT FAR
W WE HAD IT WAS A FOUR WAY SPLIT SCREEN WITH ME AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE AND IT JUST STAYED LIKE THAT
AND I HAD THE TALK ON A LAPTOP IN FRONT OF ME AND THEY HAD THE TALK ON THEIR LAPTOPS
AND SO I HAD SOMETHING WITH WITHOUT VERY MANY UM N NOT LITTLE FLYING IN AND THINGS BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST MAKE IT REALLY DIFFICULT
BUT I PRACTISED THE TALK YEAH STANDING UP IN FRONT OF IT AND POINTING TO THINGS
AND YOU'RE SITTING DOWN IN FRONT OF AND YOU COULD SEE YOURSELF BUT NOT ONLY COULD S YOU SEE YOURSELF YOU SEE YOURSELF BOUNCE BACK TWO SECONDS LATER
SO YOU'RE LIKE OH DID I JUST DO THAT
AND THEN YOU REACTING TO WHAT YOU DID A WHILE AGO
AND THEN WE CAN START FIGHTING ABOUT
FLUX ON ITS OWN WOULDN'T BE A SPECTRAL FEATURE
OOH
SO EVEN ON ONE WE CAN TELL
OOH
IS IT
IT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING IN THE ABSORPTION THAT YOU'RE SEEING
AH THERE'S ONE WITH THE EQUIVALENT WIDTH
AS A SOURCE TYPE
SHOULD WE SEE WHEN THE MANUAL COMES
I WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT THAT EITHER
BREAKING THE POWER LAW INDEX I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A YOU CAN POINT TO IT BUT EQUALLY IT'S NOT A IT'S SOMETHING YOU'VE DERIVED
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY W
BECAUSE IT WAS AT A CERTAIN POINT
IT'S IT'S NEAR RATHER THAN AT
IS THAT K. CLEAR
AN ABSORPTION FEATURE
THERE IS NO STEEP SOFT COMPONENT BUT OUR TWO K. V.
IS THAT THE VALUE OR IS THAT THE WORD
UM NOT A BIS SPECIFIC TYPE OF SOURCE BUT I THINK STILL THE THE SPECTRAL FEATURE GE COUNTS EVEN THOUGH IT'S M A MODIFIER OF SOMETHING
Y YE
IT IT IF IT WAS IF IT WAS SOME OTHER SPECTRAL FEATURE AND THEN ABSORBERS
WHICH I WOULD PROBABLY SAY IT WAS BUT THEN I'VE NEVER LOOKED AT I ONE
I GUESS Y YOU KNOW WE WE SAY A UH BIG BLUE BUMP OR A SOFT OR A CONTINUUM
AND WE INCLUDE THOSE
THAT TRUE BUT W WE HAVE INCLUDED C POWER LAW THOUGH
OH WE WERE INCLUDING FEATURE WITHIN SPECTRAL FEATURE
I THINK I JUST MISSED IT
I THINK IT'S NOT AS IF IT'S A ALTHOUGH IT'S FOUR WIDTHS HALF MAXIMUM IT'S STILL THE S THE LINE WITHIN IT
IN THIS CONTEXT
IF WASN'T IN THERE THEN YOU'D HAVE IT SILICONE TWO LINES AT BUT WITHOUT WITH THE I THINK THAT MEANS SILICONE TWO DERIVED FROM THESE TWO FEATURES
LYMAN ALPHA FOREST YOU CAN POINT TO ON THE SPECTRUM
SPECTRAL FEATURES WITHIN OR REFERRING TO S TYPES OF SOURCE WHEN WE'RE NOT BOTHER MARKING THE SOURCE
IT'S AN BUT JUST TO KNOW THIS IS A LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUD WE'RE SEEN LYMAN ALPHA FOREST
BUT IT'S STILL A SPECTRAL FEATURE EVEN IF IT'S NOT IT MIGHT BE A SPECTRAL FEATURE I NOT IN THE CLOUD
NO ONE ELSE CAN READ THAT SORRY
OKAY SO TH LYMAN ALPHA FOREST AGAIN
AND THAT DEFINITELY IS A SPECTRAL FEATURE ON ITS OWN THEN 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T EVEN SAY LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS
OH WE MARKED THE SAME LINES
THEY'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF THESE
LINE FEATURE NEED THAT
AND AND A DA IS EQUIVALENT OF SPECTRUM
THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS TALKING ABOUT S BUT IF IT'S SAYING SILICONE TWO LINE
I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT IN THE CASE OF IT BEING DATA
BUT IF IT JUST SAID EM BUT IF IT JUST SAID EMISSION LINE WE WOULD
IT THE EMISSION LINE IS STRONG
IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA AT MORE THAN THE NINETY NINE PERCENT
OR THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA FEATURE IF YOU PUT FEATURE THERE RATHER THAN DATA THEN YOU'D MARK IT
BUT I THINK DATA IS EQUIVALENT IF
IN RED WHATEVER THAT IS
IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH
CONTINUA
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU WERE DOING SEVEN THOUSAND OF THESE AN HOUR
YES IT'S THE AMOUNT OF STUFF IN THE BLUE WING
I THINK LINE PEAK IS SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT TO
NO BUT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T S ALSO POINT TO INCREA INCREASING BLUE WING
YE YES
FEATURE
IF IT WAS HYDROGEN ALIGN YOU WOULD SO YOU SHOULD MARK IF IT WAS OR H. BETA ABSORPTION
BUT SO IS H. BETA ABSORP UH EMISSION AS A PROCESS FROM H. BETA
IS JUST A PAIN
AS IN WE'RE PUTTING WEAK AND STRONG ABSORPTION WOULD COUNT SO I THINK BLUE SHIFTED SHOULD
SO THAT SHOULD BE IN
THAT'S JUST THE WRONG COLOUR AS IS THAT
YES THAT WAS ONE I WASN'T SURE ABOUT 'CAUSE INFRARED
THAT'S JUST THE WRONG NA THAT'S JUST THIS SHOULD BE A SOURCE NAME
I GUESS THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO WHAT DOES THAT M MEAN
IS IT
'CAUSE THAT'S ONE I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT
OKAY WE'LL JUST GO BACK AND CHANGE THOSE
YEAH OKAY MODIFIERS WITH THEM WHICH IS GIVE A YELL IF YOU SEE ONE
BUT THEN I'M I I P I PROBABLY USE THAT RULE SO HALF THE TIME AND JUST FORGOTTEN TO USE AT OTHER TIMES
SO LET'S TAKE THAT OUT
BUT LYMAN ALPHA FOREST SHOULD BE IN HERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TALKING ABOUT UH M IT'S NOT MODIFIED
I THINK DATA'S THE SAME AS SPECTRUM 'CAUSE THE DATA IS A SPEC M
MM LET'S TAKE THAT OUT
WHAT HOWEVER YOU PICK IT OUT
LINE ON ITS OWN
I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF THOSE WHICH MAKES LIFE SIMPLER
IS IT A SYSTEM
OH IS IT
V. L. B VERY LONG BASELINE ARRAY
IF IT HAD AN A. ON THE END IT WOULD BE THE NE INSTRUMENT
YES 'CAUSE IT TA IT TAKES AN IMAGE
SO OH BUT THEN A M RESEARCH GROUP COULD TAKE AN IMAGE
OKAY LET'S OH HOW MUCH OF MODIFIERS ARE WE PUTTING IN
BUT S
ANYTHING ENDING IN OBJECT WE DON'T INCLUDE YEP
SO NONE OF THOSE
AND THERE IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE IONIZING CONTINUUM WHICH IS A PRE
I THINK YOU CAN POINT TO LINE PAIRS
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA STICK TO IT LET'S STICK TO IT
I THINK WE WOULD PUT STOP PUTTING THE IN WE COULD GET CONFUSED
LINE BLANKETING YOU THINK Y
YEAH I THINK I IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU CAN POINT TO
THE SOFT X. RAYS OR OR THE HARD X. RAYS YOU CAN POINT TO THE RED AND THE
IF YOU HAVE A GALAXY SPECTRUM THOUGH YOU CAN SAY THERE'S THE BLUE COMPONENT THERE'S THE RED COMPONENT TO THE SPECTRUM
OH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN I LIKE IT COMES FROM ADDING TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER
IF YOU MODELLED IT WITH TWO PARTS ONE THAT HAD A A HA A HARDER AND SOFTER SPECTRUM HUBBLE IN HUBBLE DEEP FIELD SOUTH
WH WHAT DID WE SAY ABOUT ACRONYMS WHERE
I THINK THEY PROBABLY ARE
MISSION LINE FEATURE WE'RE GONNA INCLUDE
AH NOW THIS IS ONE
WHERE IT SHOULD BE THIS ONE BUT WHAT IF YOU'D UN IF THESE ARE DOUBLY UNDERLINED
HAS IT JUST PLOTTED THE TOP COLOUR
WE CHANGED IT SO THAT YOU COULD
LIST THE WRONG WRONG COLOUR FOR A FEW THINGS
OH IT'S ALL HERE
I. S. M.
STRONG DROP IN THE CONTINUUM
THE QUESTION IS ARE EMISSION LINE OBJECTS A SEPARATE CLASS OF SOURCE
AND SEYFERT GALAXIES W SHOULD BE ONE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
I THINK WE DID TWO TRAINING SETS AND THEN WE HAD AT LEAST ONE MEETING WITH YOU WHERE WE TALKED IT ALL THROUGH
BUT I D I MEAN I THOUGHT WE HAD BASICALLY THE SAME IDEAS TO B I DON'T REMEMBER EVER HAVING STRONG ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE IN WHAT GROUP OR IT WAS JUST THE RULES ABOUT THINGS THAT S YEAH
AND WHAT COUNTED AS WHA AS FOR THE SPECTRAL FEATURES IT WAS MORE CONFUSING WHAT COUNTED AS A SPECTRAL FEATURE AND WE HAD A LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT
WE DID SEND IT TO HIM YEAH
UH
IT'S A VERY STRANGE INTERVIEW FEELING AS WELL BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THEM WHILE YOU'RE GIVING YOUR TALK
BECAUSE THEY JUST SHOW USUALLY THEY HAVE A CAMERA ON YOU AND A CAMERA ON THEM
BUT DURING THE TALK PART THEY HAVE A CAMERA ON I BELIEVE THEM 'CAUSE I COULD SEE THAT GUY READING A NEWSPAPER HALFWAY THROUGH MY TALK
IT IS REALLY STRANGE
SHALL W SHALL WE DIVE IN IN THE INTERIM
AH
BEN SAID HE HE LEFT IT OUT ON PURPOSE WHICH IS REASON
UH
IF YOU GET LINE I GET SOFT COMPONENT
IT'S A BIG BUMP IN THE SOFT BIT
YEAH THAT'S THE THING YOU POINT TO AND THIS IS A PH A PHYSICAL MECHANISM
UH
A BREAK IN A SPECTRUM IS SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT AT
'CAUSE YOU CAN SEE BOTH THE SLIGHT DEPRESSION AND THE LYMAN LIMIT
THERE'S A LYMAN LIMIT WHICH YOU COULD SEE AND THEN THERE'S A SLIGHT DEPRESSION NEAR IT
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE ABOUT THAT
YEAH IF IT WAS THERE'S AN ABSORPTION FEATURE OR ABSORPTION TO SEE IT THE SPECTRUM AT THIS WAVE LENGTH
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT TO
YOU COULD POINT TO IT IF IT WERE THERE
UH LINE IN IN LINE IN LINE RATIOS IS MODIFYING RATIOS
YEAH IT SHOULDN'T BE IN
OH I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE CIRCLING THE ONE WE LIKE RIGHT
UH RIGHT DAMPED LYMAN SEE AGAIN THAT'S UH THESE ARE SOURCE TYPES THE UM I MEAN IT'S NOT A SOURCE TYPE
BUT DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBERS ARE TH ARE PHYSICAL THINGS NOT SPECTRAL FEATURES
YE
D DON'T WITH DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA OBSERVERS YOU THEM A VARIETY OF PLACES ALONG THE LINE OF SIGHT
IF YOU LOOK AT A QUASAR AND YOU SEE A BUNCH UH IF YOU GOT A BUNCH OF CLOUDS OF GAS IN THE WAY
YOU CAN SEE THESE THINGS AND BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO POINT AT ONE OF THEM AND SAY AH THAT'S A DAMP YEAH
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO TH THAT
YE
WELL NO BUT YOU SEE THEM IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT RED RED SHIFTS
YOU CAN'T POINT AT SOMETHING ON A SPECTRUM AND SAY THAT'S DEFINITELY A D DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SOME I G AND I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE MODIFIERS OF THIS SOURCE TYPE
STEEP SOFT COMPONENT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT AT IN A SPECTRUM AND SAY THERE IT IS
UH
ANYTHING BLOBBY I DI I DIDN'T MARK
UH
UH YOU'VE GOT LINE BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES
FEATURE
BUT WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS IS WE'VE MADE SOME MEASUREMENTS BASED ON DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA MEASUREMENTS AND THEY TELL US THIS ANSWER
M
B BUT
TAKE IT AGAIN BUT SYSTEMS SHOULD BE OUT
SEE THAT I THAT'S TALKING ABOUT THE THE FLUX OF KIN OF IONISING PHOTONS RATHER THEN THE CONTINUUM OF THAT SPECTRUM
THAT'S OKAY WITH ME I DON'T CARE
UH
YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LINE FROM AN ION AND A LINE LINE FROM SOMETHING ELSE
AH UH
YOU CAN POINT TO IT BUT CAN YOU POINT TO A LINE PEAK VELOCITY SHIFT
YEAH I'M NOT SURE EITHER
B OH YEAH EITHER THAT IF THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN NEITHER SHOULD EITHER OF THOSE
IS IT
UH
IF THAT'S TRUE THEN THEIR LEAVING OUT THE WORD LINE I DON'T SHOULD MEAN THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE MARKED
UH
OH IS THAT WHAT THAT MEANS
OH YEP
YEAH THE AND THIS SHOULDN'T BE SHOULD IT
M M DOES THOSE COUNT AS MODIFIERS ACTIVE WE DEFINITELY INCLUDE ACTIVE
THOSE CAN DOES THAT NOT MEAN A A BROAD BAND DETECTION
AH
I'M RIGHT LOOK
G AH LOOK AT THAT
BASED ON THIS BUT WE COULD CHANGE THIS RULE RATHER THAN CHANGING ALL THOSE THINGS
WHAT'S THE WHAT WAS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO AT THIS POINT
'CAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWED THAT RULE
AH WE'RE BACK TO DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA DATA
I DO I STILL DON'T THINK THAT GOES IN
UH
BROAD BAND DETECTIONS IS IN DON'T INCLUDE
OH SO IT WOULD BE A NARROW BAND DETECTION A NARROW BAND IMAGING DETECTION
AH RIGHT
YEAH V. L. B. I. IS UH A NET UH IT'S IT'S A V. L. B. I. IS IT'S A TECHNIQUE
THE V. O.
IS IT IN IT IT'S AN INTSTRU GROUP INSTRUMENT NOT A RESEARCH GROUP
YEAH IS THAT SO THIS WHOLE THING IS AN INSTRUMENT YOU SAY
OH I SEE I SEE
SO IS THIS LIKE IT'S A SUBSET OF THE V. L. B. A.
WE ONLY AGREED THAT SO FAR WE'VE ONLY AGREED THAT WE CAN'T INCLUDE SPECTRAL FEATURES MODIFYING NEBULA
YEAH BUT THE SEE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF NEBULA
I THINK IS WHY I WASN'T DOING IT
AH
WE DID JUST HAVE IT DON'T KNOW
LINE YEAH WE TOOK BLANKETING OUT SO I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD BE IN
IS THAT IT
UH THAT'S A SOURCE NINE
MM THE SOFT EXCESS YOU CAN DEFINITELY POINT TO ON AN X. RAY THING
YOU KN YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ONE THERE OR NOT YOU COULD SAY THAT'S THAT
W OH YEAH
LIKE A BREAK YOU SAY OH LOOK THERE'S
IT'S JUST A T
UM HUBBLE AND HUBBLE DEEP SENT TO US
SO SHOULD W DID WE HAVE A SOFT COMPONENT EARLIER
THERE IT IS
DO WE HA DID WE S MAKE A DECISION ABOUT RADIO GALAXIES
OH DO THEY
BUT IN
RIGHT BUT I'M ON THE
YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD GO IN
OH UP HERE
IS IT
OR IS IT OH RIGHT
AND Q. S. O. IS NOT YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT
THE I. S. M. ISN'T A SOURCE TYPE
IS IT
OH NO WE AREN'T DOING THAT EITHER YOU'RE RIGHT
HE HAS HAD IT CERTAINLY
WE SHOULD HAVE THESE THINGS IN OUR AREA
THAT'S NOT NO
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT ALTHOUGH YOU OH IT ISN'T ACTUALLY USED ALL THAT OFTEN THESE DAYS I THINK
RIGHT AYE
IS THERE
AND WE CAN POINT AT IT
OH YOU WANT TO S SPLIT THAT ONE AND DO YOU INTO TWO
BUT IF IT HAD BEEN THERE UM YOU WOULD'VE
HAD IT AS A FEATURE
OH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
WELL I MEAN YOU COULD LOOK AT THIS THIS SPECTRUM AND SPOT THAT UM TH L LYMAN ALPHA HAS BEEN DAMPED
THAT IS A N SPECTRAL FEATURE
RIGHT WELL TH YEAH TH THAT'S IN THE THE MANUAL
UH IS THAT RIGHT
YEAH I THINK SO TOO IN THAT
M
WELL THAT'S P WHAT I'M P PONDERING REALLY
OKAY TH
BUT IT'S IN THIS S SP SP SP SP SPECTRUM OF ANOTHER OBJECT THOUGH
UH AND HE COULD POINT AT IT THAT'S TRUE AND SAY THAT IS
UH YEAH
AS THE DATA
WE'LL GO P COULD BE HERE ALL DAY
WELL I Y
IS IT IT ISN'T JUST ONE DISCRETE
WELL IF YOU T
ON THE ABUNDANCE ALL OF THE S SPECIES ACTUALLY USE THE OLD LINES
OH WELL WHAT'S NEW
WELL THEN HAVE IT IN
IT'S E. V. N. ISN'T IT
THIS IS AN INSTRUMENT IF YOU HAVE IT ALL ISN'T IT
OH I THINK IT'S UH UM S S S STARTING WITH UM EU EUROPEAN I THINK
UH YES
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MERLIN AND ALL THE I UM INTERNATIONAL LOGS IN EUROPE ALL
HOOKED UP INTO ONE INSTRUMENT BASICALLY
WELL I WOULD ARGUE ABOUT SEE BECAUSE I THINK THAT I MEAN TH THAT YOU ONLY EXTRACT THAT AFTER YOU ACTUALLY MODEL A SP SPECTRUM DON'T YOU
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY UM AFTER YOU ACTUALLY MODEL THE S A SPECTRUM NOT JUST ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE SPECTRUM
Y
YEAH BUT UM COMPONENT IT IS M MEANS IT'S AN ELEMENT ACTUALLY IN THE MODEL THOUGH
INTERESTING BECAUSE ON THE HOUR IT YEAH
BUT T Y ARE YOU ARGUING NOT TO HAVE ANYTHING WITH OBJECT IN IT THOUGH
LIKE THAT INITIALLY HAD QUITE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THE PHRASE TYPES AND AND MARKATIONS AND THEN EVENTUALLY YOU CAME UP UH WITH SOME KIND OF RULES THAT YOU SET UP BETWEEN UH THE TWO OF YOU
OKAY RIGHT IT'S PRINTING IT OUT AS WELL
SO SO YOU SORRY UM JUST FOR THE CONVENTION YOU YOU YOU MARKING WHICH UH WHICH THE ANNOTATION YOU THINK IS IS THE RIGHT ONE
WOULD THERE BE OTHER CASES WHERE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY MARK AN AB ABSORPTION
IS THAT THE NEBULA
WAS IT THE NEBULA THIN YEAH
UM SO SO CAN I JUST ASK W W NOW YOU JUST UH ALIGNED D UH SORRY YOU CIRCLE THE WORD IN THE IN THE OUTLINE WHICH DIDN'T
OK OH I SEE OKAY
UM SORRY CAN WE JUST GO BACK TH UH ONE PAGE
DID DID YOU RESOLVE THE THE LI THE DIFFERENT UM SEGMENTATIONS LIKE UH THE MAIN PROBLEM WAS
OH SORRY I I THOUGHT IT WAS A PROBLEM OF LIKE UH ONE HAVING UNDERLINED THE ENTIRE OH SORRY
NO NO I I SE OKAY SORRY
SO I TH I THINK TH THERE THERE WAS ALSO THIS ONE GUIDELINE OF SAYING FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMETHING UH IS SITTING UNDER A NEGATION
RIGHT THE THERE WAS NO UM DAMPED L. Y. ALPHA SOMETHING
SO IT'S MORE LIKE UH A S IT'S UH UH IT'S UH SORT OF LIKE A QUITE LITERAL TASK THAT'S REALLY LIKE FINDING THESE KIND OF UH THESE TYPES OF STRINGS UH RATHER THAN REALLY REFERRING TO THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL REALITY
WHICH I MEAN SORT OF LIKE IF IF YOU IF YOU WERE TO RESOLVE THESE KIND OF UH CASES IN ORDER TO PUT THEM SAY IN A DATABASE OR SO
THEN YOU'D PROBABLY BE RIGHT IN THIS CASE RIGHT
BUT UH TH GIVEN THAT THE KIND OF THING IS THAT THAT THIS NAMED ENTITY RECOGN TASK IS IS A MUCH IS A MUCH MORE UH LITERAL THING
I THINK IN THIS CASE UM I W I WOULD SAY THIS IS PROBABLY AN ENTITY
RIGHT SO UH I MEAN THIS REALLY ONLY DISPLAYS UH TH THOSE CASES WHERE YOU DISAGREED
BUT IF YOU SORTA LIKE CHANGE A RULE NOW ON THE FLY THEN THAT MIGHT BE THEN THAT MIGHT B UH CREATE INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE
LIKE T ON THE TYPE OF FILTER OR IS IT OH OKAY
OH WAS IT ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO DOUBLY UNDERLINE THINGS
I DON'T KNOW WH WHICH ONE IT WOULD DISPLAY THEN
I I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HAVE THESE SO YOU YOU YOU ALLOWED THESE KIND OF EMBEDDED UH ANNOTATIONS
AND THE IN THAT CASE
I THINK HIGH EXCITATION SHOULD BE IN BECAUSE IT'S JUST SAYING
ESO I DON'T THINK IS AN INSTRUMENT
TO NOT YES TO KEEP HUBBLE
WELL IT IS THE WHOLE NAME YES I GET
AND LYMAN ALPHA CLOUD SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE EITHER
FOR SOME REASON I SEEM TO HAVE JUST DIED ON THIS ONE
HE GOT BORED
UM IT IS
MM I DIDN'T IT I JUST LOOKED AT THE PLU
SO YEAH I'M HAPPY WITH THAT AS LONG AS THAT'S RED AS WELL WHICH IT IS
I THINK YOU'RE R YOU'RE RIGHT AGAIN THERE
OH IS IT
OR THERE MAYBE THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY YEAH I THINK SHOULD STILL BE ABSORPTION
WHAT IS AS ASSOCIATED ABSORPTION
I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS
SO IS THAT WHAT IT MEANS IN THAT C CONTEXT
IT DOESN'T SAY IN THE MANUAL ABOUT FEATURES OR NOT BUT WE D WHEN WE SAW ONES PREVIOUSLY WE MARKED FEATURES
IS IT
AN ABLE CLUSTER IS JUST A A DISCOVER
OH IT'S STILL TOO HOT
IT'S THE SAME IT'S JUST IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR BEFORE THE SO CALLED
AS IT IS
HAVE YOU GOT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE
OR IS IT CUT OFF
ARE WE THE SAME ON THE BOTTOM LINE
OKAY SO THE QUESTION IS OH NO IT'S DIFFERENT
SO THERE'S A RIGHT BUT I THINK WEAK LINE SHOULD BE IN
BEC I IN THE SAME WAY THAT IF YOU HAD BROAD LINE IT WOULD BE IN THERE
OH NO IS IT
STAR FORMING GALAXIES SHOULD BE IN
W NOT GONNA GET AWAY WITH THAT ONE
IT'S A LUMP
OH COVERS YEAH
IS A FEATURE A SPECTRAL FEATURE
AFTER AND THE REST IS THE SAME
NOW A LINE SHOULD BE IN
YES I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN
OH IT'S JUST IT'S LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION
YES WE ARE TAKING OUT LINE ON ITS OWN
SO WE HA YES
LINE CENTRE YOU CAN POINT TO
NOT LIKE LINE WIDTH BUT YOU CAN POINT TO LINE CENTRE
YOU CAN POINT TO THE LINE WINGS
YEP NO THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE
BUT A. G BUT A AN A. AN A. G. N. IS A CLASS
YES I THINK IT WAS MA MAYBE IF IT WAS STAR FORMING LIKE ACTIVITY THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
UM WE'VE JUST GOT THIS SPLIT UP
BUT GALAXY SHOULD BE IN
MM BUT THREE SHOULD BE IN
ALTHOUGH I WAS TALKING ABOUT CONTI YEAH CONTINUUM LUMINOSITY CONTINUUM FLUX IT SHOULD BE IN
THIS IS NICE TEA
NOW WHAT WERE WE DOING IF
DOESN'T REALLY SAY
WHAT HAVE WE DONE T
AS ONE OKAY
Y UM YES TAKE IT OUT
EMISSION LINE OBJECTS SHOULDN'T BE IN EITHER OF THEM
RADIO QUIET QUASAR SHOULD BE GO MM
NOW YOU'VE DONE ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
I. G. M. I'VE DONE AGAIN
THIS IS NICE AND EASY
H. V. C. IS IT THIS
KNOWN TO LIE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIGH VELOCITY CLOUDS
EVEN LINE IF IT IS LINE WIDTH
H. BETA SHOULD BE IN
OH BUT THE SECOND ONE
OH IT'S INCLUDED BESIDE MARK IT ALL AS ONE ENTITY YES
NO THAT'S TRUE SO WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE EITHER OF THOSE
RED CONTINUUM SHOULD BE IN
CONTINUUM SOURCE SHOULDN'T BE IN
AND ASSOCIATED SHOULDN'T BE IN
C. T. I. I. O.
YES BUT IT'S ALSO A TELESCOPE AND I THINK HE IF THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OF DESCRIBING IT THAT TELESCOPE
THE C. T. I. O. FOUR METRE TELESCOPE IS MUST BE WHAT IT'S CALLED
ION SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE
IRON AND ABSORPTION
IS IT CONTAMINATION FROM BLENDED IRON AND ABSORPTION LINES
I IF THE COMMA WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE IN
SO SO IT SHOULD BE IN
G OH
THERE'RE GONNA BE HUNDREDS OF THOSE
I THINK IT SHOULD P
OH SORRY I'M I ME
YEAH I DON'T THIN I DON'T THINK THERE WAS S BUT
NO ABSORPTION LINES SHOULD BE IN AND THE SAME HERE
NICE NOT TO DO ASSOCIATED FOR ONCE
AND WE W OH GOSH WHAT WERE WE GONNA TO DO ABOUT A. AND AGAIN
AND ABSORPTION AND SMALL CLOUDS IS OUT
AH NOW THIS IS THE CONJUNCT RULE AGAIN
AND THIS IS ONE DOUBLE LINE
I THINK I IF THE LINE'S TOO LONG Y YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED ALL I AS ONE
I THINK IF THE LINE'S TOO LONG
IT'S ONLY HA PUTTING THE BOTTOM LINE BECAUSE OLIVIA WOULD'VE MARKED FROM BLUE ALL THE WAY TO THE END AS ONE LONG LINE
YEAH BUT I THINK IT'S JUST M MISSING OUT THE PRINTING IF THE LINE GOES OVER THE END
LINE BROADNESS AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE IN
TO THE FEATURE OF THE SPECTRUM
IT IT'S POINTING THERE AND SAYING LOOK THERE'S A HIGH EXCITATION EMISSION
YOU CAN POINT TO THE DAMPED LYMAN A ALPHA RESORPTION IN IN THE SAME WAY YOU CAN POINT TO H. BETA EMISSION
NO THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION SYSTEMS WE CROSSED OUT
WOULD IT BE IF IT WAS H. BETA ABSORPTION
AND YOU JUST TOOK OUT THE LOW RED SHIFTS
YES IT'S DEPENDS WHETHER IT HAS T WHETHER IT MEANS WITH LOW RED SHIFT DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA CLOUD ABSORPTION
THERE'S THE IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE YEAH H. BETA EMISSION IS A PROCESS
IS IT GONNA BE A DECENT SOURCE TYPE IN THE FUTURE
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THEY HAVE MA
MM ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE'RE HAVING HYPER LUMINOUS GALAXIES WHERE YOU KNOW THEY'VE JUST GOT ULTRA LUMINOUS AND OH EVEN MORE HYPER LUMINOUS
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ACRONYM BECAUSE THAT'S HAS THAT SHOULD BE IN
BECAUSE THE ACRONYM HAS STAR BURST IN IT UH GALAXIES IN IT IN THE S. AND IF THE ACRONYM INCLUDES ITS
U. V. AND OPTICAL EMISSION LINE RATIOS
U. V. AND OPTICAL EMI U. V. AND OPTICAL EMISSION SHOULD BE IN THERE THOUGH
OH GOSH NO EMISSION L OKAY SO I'VE HIGHLIGHTED THIS IN R RED AND THEN THE WHOLE THING IN GREEN BECAUSE TYPE TWO SEYFART GALAXIES ARE ONE
NEITHER
OH THERE'S EMISSION FROM THE NARROW LINE REGION YEAH
NARROW LINE EMISSION SHOULD BE IN
YOU USED TO B OH NO KECK OBSERVATORY
YES WE DID DECIDE KECK WAS GOING IN
OH NO RADIO LOUD AND RADIO QUIET ARE
YE I THINK THEY'RE A SEPARATE CLASS YES
NO YOU CAN'T POINT TO IT YEAH
AND MORE TO THE POINT CAN I GET TO IT WITHOUT GOING AH I CAN CARRY MY LITTLE BITS IN THE WITH ME
AND THIS ISN'T A SEPARATE THING SO I W I WOULD AGREE THAT YOU UNDERLINE THE YOU UNDERLINE THE GOO IN EACH CASE BUT NOT THE AND
ESO ISN'T AN INSTRUMENT
I DON'T YEAH I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING YEAH
I WIN
UH
IS THERE A PRIZE AT THE END
YE
I THINK IN PHIL'S PAPER HE DOES DOESN'T HE
THE PAPER I POINTED YOU TO A FEW WEEKS AGO OR LAST WEEK
UH YEAH
THERE HE IS
IT MEANS IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH SOME PHYSICAL THING BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SPECTRAL FEATURES I DON'T THINK
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN
THOSE ARE MECHANISMS
YEP I JUST MISSED IT
RI RIGHT
THAT DEFINITELY GETS TO GO IN
UH I CAN AGREE WITH TAKING THAT OUT
THAT THE SO CALLED YEAH I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE SHOULD IT
MM NO I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT OUT
YEAH NO YOU'VE GOT LINE IN THERE
M
FAR INFRARED GALAXIES WE CAN'T HAVE
YEAH THAT CAN'T BE IN
UH YES IT SHOULD BE
YEP THAT SHOULD BE IN
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE REGIONS GLOBS NEBULAE
THAT DOESN'T GO IN AND THAT'S OKAY
WE'VE BEEN TAKING OUT LINE AS A
RIGHT I AGREE THAT THAT CAN GO OUT 'CAUSE THAT'S A FITTING THING
UH RIGHT
THIS TIME YOU HAVE IT
BUT GALAXIES SHOULD BE IN
UH OH WHAT HAVE WE DONE
UH YEAH
YEAH THAT DOESN'T GO IN
THAT MEANS OBJECTS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AND MAYBE AT A PARTICULAR RED SHIFT BASED ON IT
MINE TOO
THE RULE WAS TO LEAVE IT IN WAS IT
Z. EQUALS TWO IS UM MEANS AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE
UM SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN BUT RADIO LOUD QUASARS IS A THING
SO IT'S WHETHER TO INCLUDE THE Z. EQUALS TWO IN THE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT H. V. C. STANDS FOR BUT SINCE THEY'RE COMPLEXES WE CAN CROSS IT OUT
SHOULD BE THIS AND IT PROBABLY IS THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THAT MEANS
OH I SEE
BETA LINE
UM OH BETA YEP
OH I DON'T THINK I WAS DOING THAT
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE OUT
NOT THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT TO
MM THAT SHOULD BE OH WAIT IS THAT S THAT'S AN OBSERVATORY ISN'T IT
THE C. T. IS THE C. T. I. O. FOUR METRE UH THE NAME OF THAT TELESCOPE
AND THE A. A. T. IS AN OBSERVATORY AS WELL ISN'T IT
YEAH NO OH I SEE I SEE I SEE YEAH
UH YEAH
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA Q. S. O.
ONE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA Q. S. O. S
YEAH LOW LUMINOSITY Q. S. O. S NO
THEY ARE AS AS MUCH AS ULTRA LUMINOUS GALAXIES ARE
AND YEP THAT SHOULD BE IN
OH A. AND B.
IF YEAH
UH
AND I DIDN'T OOH
OH I HIGHLIGHTED ALL AS ONE RIGHT
OH I SEE
MM OH SO IT IS
RIGHT THAT'S NOT SHOULDN'T GO IN
IS THAT EVERYTHING
LINE EMITTING GAS DOESN'T GET IN
WELL I'M NOT CERTAIN IF HIGH EXCITATION SHOULD GO IN BUT IF HIGH EXCITATION SHOULD GO IN I THINK IONIZED MEANS THE SAME THING DOESN'T IT
S
S YEAH OKAY
OOH
NE YES
I THINK IT'S A PROCESS TOO I THINK
THAT'S NOT REALLY SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT TO
SO LET'S LEAVE IT THERE
BUT W DO THEY WHAT DEFINES A MICRO QUASAR
UH YEAH YOU Y THERE'S NOT BEEN MORE THAN ONE STUDY OF DWARF AMORPHOUS NUCLEAR STAR BURST GALAXIES
SO THAT DO WE SAY WE TAKE THAT OUT
YEP THAT'S IT IN IT
NEITHER
UH
SO WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW H. OR HELIUM TWO O. SPECTRUM EITHER
ISO ELECTRONIC
U. V. ACCESSORS ARE RIGHT ISN'T IT
UH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
UH YES COURSE OF COURSE IT IS YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT ALL IS YEAH I THINK IT IS ALL M ONE NAME
YEAH THESE ARE S S SPECIES IONS AGAIN NOT INDIVIDUAL LINES
UH
WELL IT'S ONE OF THEM OUT UM OVER HERE I THINK ACTUALLY AT THE MOMENT
SO 'CAUSE OUR SUN IS A IS A T. DWARF
UH
WELL I THINK Y BU Y Y YOU CAN ACTUALLY MARK IT IF IT ISN'T ALTERING WHAT'S IN THE MANUAL
WELL N I THINK I WOULD ACTUALLY LEAVE IT UM WITH ONLY TH ON THOSE
UM BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S S WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING EARLIER ON
AND AN AND
BUT WASN'T THERE ONE JUST A MINUTE AGO IN WHICH ONLY HAD A LINE
UH YES
AS IS AN A. G. N.
UH
UH
UH
ARE YOU
N
UM M UH Y YE WELL I DON'T KNOW
I GUE I GUESS KEEP IT THEN
H H
YE YE
UH YEAH
YOU HAVE ALL THE L LINES OF ACTUALLY LOTS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS AND YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT AT ALL THE ONES SP WHICH ARE ION LINES
THEN AFTER THAT YOU LOOK AND SAY UM HA HAS A LOT OF ION IN IT
IS IT JUST UM TO S SCRUB YOUR MECHANISM THERE
IT ISN'T UH A SPECTRAL FEATURE SUCH AS OH IT'S A PROCESS
I FORGOT TO KEEP TRACK OF THE OVERALL SCORE LIKE WHO WINS AND WHO LOSE
W WITHIN THE SENTENCE THAT YOU SORT OF CURRENTLY LOOKING AT UM FEEL FREE TO CORRECT IT THAT WAY THAT YOU'LL DO YOU KNOW LIKE IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT RESOLUTION BUT IT'S SORT OF LIKE COMING UP WITH A CORRECTED VERSION BASED ON THESE
HAVE YOU DO YOU'VE SEEN THAT THERE ARE THE OTHER ONE THERE THE QUASAR RIGHT
NO IS IT
G. B. H. C. OOH
WAIT FR FROM THE LINGUISTIC SIDE IF YOU IF YOU MARK STAR BURST BEFORE AND IF YOU FEEL THAT STAR BURSTS ARE LIKE OBJECTS
IS IS GOO AGAIN OR IS IT REALLY Z. EQUALS TWO
IF IT WAS RADIO LOUD QUASAR THEN YOU WOULD MARK IT AS ONE THING
I I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO UM MARK THE WHOLE THING THEN AS ONE
MARK THE LA LA
BUT IT'S S SO YOU'RE MOSTLY SETTLING UH SETTLING FOR FOR THE UH SOLUTION WHERE YOU MARK ALL CONTACTS INDIVIDUALLY
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN POINT TO RIGHT
OH I SEE
SO IN THAT SENSE IT'S LIKE LIKE A DERIVED PROPERTY
SO YOU YOU F YOU FOUND THAT DWARF AMORPHOUS BLAH BLAH GALAXIES THAT THAT'S NOT A PROPER NAME
I MEAN M MY VIEW ON THIS WAS THAT UM THE NEED FOR PEOPLE TO BACK UP THEIR DATA PERSONALLY WAS MADE SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR TO LAB USERS
I I'M JUST THINKING YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WHEN THERE'S A A PROCESS ERROR LIKE THAT YOU THINK OH THEN THERE'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD CHANGE
IS IT YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH DISRUPTION DOES THIS CAUSE
D IS THIS A DAY
TO ACTUALLY DO THE RE INSTALL
SO UH I UH DID HE GET HIS DATA IN
SO BETTER YOU THAN ME
OH SO YOU NEED TO BORROW SOMEBODY'S HEAD AND MOUTH AND STUFF TO TO RUN IT RIGHT
I'LL TH I'LL ASK HER IF SHE'D MIND COMING DOWN AND HELPING YOU OUT FOR UH A WHILE
SO UM UH MINE IS WELL SHE'S ACTUALLY CLIMBING BEN NEVIS TODAY I THINK
DID YOU GUYS MEET HER
OH WHO IS THAT
UH RIGHT WHAT AM I WRITING
UH OKAY NYNKE TO VOLUNTEER
WELL UH NO UH I WILL ACTUALLY GIVE HER THE THE OPTION
I THINK IT'S QUITE USEFUL WHEN YOU'RE AT THAT STAGE TO SEE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES PEOPLE USE
WELL YOU FOUND THAT THEN
OKAY SO YOU YOUR JOB IN THIS IS TO UM ENSURE THAT IT ACTUALLY IS A BUG AND THEN PASS IT TO JOE
I MEAN THE THIS GEOMETRY STUFF IS REALLY TRICKY IF YOU DON'T DO THE FOLD THE BOXES STUFF IN YOUR HEAD WELL SO I CAN IMAGINE
'CAUSE I COULD GET IT BACKWARDS EASILY YOU KNOW AND SO IT IS JUST AS WELL FOR W FOR YOU TO CHECK THIS
OH SO YEAH I SUGGESTED YOU DO THAT IN X. FIG
IS THAT A REASONABLE THING TO DO OR NO
THEY ARE THE PAID
JUST ASK THEM LOOK YOU KNOW SAY WE YOU NEED SOMETHING THAT DOES S. V. G. AND THEN UM IF THEY IF THEY COME BACK AND SAY HA
THEN Y YOU MAY NEED TO POODLE AROUND A BIT LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
OH SO WELL I CAN IMAGINE THERE BEING UH SHAPES THAT YOU COULD CONSTRUCT IN S. V. G. FORMAT THAT WOULD FOX THE MODEL BUILDER IN SOME WAY
WELL BUT BY SELF INTERSECTION HERE I'LL DRAW HERE IF I CAN FIND THE RIGHT END OF THE PEN
Y DO YOU MEAN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO UM ARE TH
WELL YOU LET'S UM ENCOURAGE THEM NOT TO USE UM ANY SOFTWARE THAT MIGHT HAVE IDIOSYNCRATIC IDEAS ABOUT WHAT S. V. G. IS
I HAVE NO OOH THAT I WASN'T GONNA SAY
I I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THEY HAVE IDIOSYNCRATIC S. V. G. OUTPUT OR WHETHER BUT UM THEIR TRACK THEIR TRACK RECORD COULD UH ON SOME OF THE OTHER STANDARDS HAS NOT THERE HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY STRANGE THINGS ABOUT IT
SO UM BUT IN MY UH YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY SH THAT SHOULD BE IF
I HAVEN'T LOOKED THROUGH OTHER MAIL
I DID SEE SOMETHING FROM MARLOES
IS THERE ANYTHING THEY'RE WAITING ON FROM US THAT IS A PROBLEM OR I THEY REASONABLY HAPPY AT THE MOMENT
OH THEY'VE DONE THE PILOTS
AND THEY HAVE TO GET OUT TO US SOME WAY
UM UH WE HAD A UH BRIEF DISCUSSION JUST BEFORE I LEFT ABOUT UH THIS IDEA OF EXCHANGING DATA BY FIRE WIRE DRIVE AND I DO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT EVER GOT RESOLVED
OH SO YOU'RE MANAGING THAT OKAY AND YOU HAVEN'T RUN INTO C. V. S. BEFORE
RIGHT AND WHAT ABOUT UM THE PROJECT AS A WHOLE
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT RUUD OR ANYBODY IS AFTER THAT WE AREN'T SUPPLYING
THEY'RE THEY'RE CRITICAL THE TO THE SUCCESS OF A PROJECT
Y UH YEAH AND GENERAL PLACES
WELL WHILE YOU DO THAT I'LL BE TRAINED IN HOW TO HIRE PEOPLE
SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ON FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK BESIDES GETTING THIS STUFF UP AND RUNNING AGAIN
I MEAN I SORT OF WROTE THE INITIAL DRAFT OF IT I SUPPOSE
YEAH AND YOU'LL GET NOTHING BACK UNLESS I LOOK AT IT RIGHT
I I UM YEAH I I MEAN IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT YOU'RE Y UM PUTTING THINGS OUT FOR FOR REVIEW AND SAYING LIKE WHY FOR STUFF
BUT UM WE DON'T WE ALSO DON'T WANT UM TO BURN TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME RECORDING STUFF THAT THAT NOBODY'S EVER GONNA LOOK AT NECESSARILY
SO I MEAN THIS THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD CASE FOR OR IT MIGHT UH OR IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU SHOULD JUST LIKE YOU KNOW
TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS STUFF IF I HAPPEN TO BE AROUND AT THE TIME THAT YOU'RE DOING IT AND NOT Y SO I IF THE WRITING STUFF DOWN ON THE WIKI GETS TO BE TOO HIGH A PROPORTION OF THINGS
ESPECIALLY IN IN BIG DISPERSED GROUPS BUT THIS IS KIND OF A SMALLER GROUP
UM SO IT YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THINGS MORE INFORMALLY WHERE F YOU FEEL THE WIKIS ARE GETTING IN THE WAY OF THINGS
OH YEAH IT WELL IF IT AIDS YOU IN THINKING TO WRITE IT DOWN THEN DEFINITELY WRITE IT DOWN
SO UM IS THAT GONNA HAVE A VOICE OVER OR IS IT WE HAD DISCUSSIONS BEFORE YOU STARTED ABOUT WHETHER IT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY SILENT SO THAT THEY COULD USE IN CASE WE EVER WANTED TO DO THIS IN IN DUTCH
YOU COULD JUST HAVE SORT OF WELL THE I THINK WE DISCUSSED HAVING IT WITH AN ENGLISH VOICE OVER OR HAVING IT WITH NO VOICE OVER AND THEN HAVING IT W JUST WITH CARTOON NOISES OR SOMETHING LIKE OR YOU KNOW WHEN THINGS BREAK
OH SO WE COULD PRODUCE A DUTCH VOICE OVER FOR THE SAME THING
OKAY THE OTH THE OTHER ISSUE IS UM UH I IF WE DO A VOICE OVER UH DOES THAT AFFECT THE LANGUAGE THAT THE PEOPLE CHOOSE TO USE
S SO THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER REASON FOR NOT DOING THAT
SO I THINK MAYBE THAT WAS ANOTHER REASON FOR UM JUST HAVING
OR OR OR DING FOR YOU KNOW YOU GOT IT OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WELL THAT Y
OR OR YOU COULD JUST POINT TO YOU KNOW HAVE B GREAT BIG ARROW THAT POINTS AT THE TWO PIECES THAT BROKE
SO YOU GONNA CLEAR OR R HOWEVER YOU DO THIS WITH ELLEN RIGHT
'CAUSE SHE'S THE ONE THAT HAS THOUGHTS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE AND STUFF
OH WELL REMIN REMIND HER THAT THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THERE OUGHTA BE ONE
AH I THINK IT'S REALLY UP TO US TO
IS IT HARD
YOU DON'T WANNA GIVE 'EM THE SPECIFICATION YOU KNOW 'CAUSE THAT'S IN TOO HIGH FALUTIN A LANGUAGE
BUT UM OH I IT CAN'T BE THAT HARD TO GENERATE SOMETHING THAT SAYS
OH UM UH ON MY HOLIDAYS WE ENCOUNTERED A CHILDREN'S TOYSHOP WHERE THERE WE THERE WERE TAMGRAMS
OR DO Y DO YOU FIND IT HELPFUL TO HAVE IT
OH BUT IT'S SO TACTILE TO HAVE THE LITTLE METAL BITS
IF YOU IF YOU'RE USING IT KEEP IT
IS THERE A BIG TAMGRAM COMMUNITY THAT RANKS THESE THINGS
BUT THAT STILL WON'T TELL YOU WELL HOW MANY TAMGRAMS ARE THERE THAT THEY'RE USING
SO THAT'S NOT GONNA G SO THAT'S NOT GONNA TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT RELATIVE COMPLEXITY
CA UH IF YOU LOOK AT 'EM DO YOU JUST KNOW
I WOULD EITHER
I IF H MISTER GEOMETRY
CAN YOU TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT THESE HOW HARD PEOPLE FIND THEM
WELL THERE WAS STUFF IN THE SEVENTIES AND THE EIGHTIES RIGHT
ARE THE REST OF THE Y UH ARE IS THE REST OF WHAT YOU'RE TO DO WITH THAT SOFTWARE FAIRLY CLEAR
W WHAT OTHER TH ANALYSES WE WANT O WANT OUT OF THIS THAT AREN'T SETTLED
SO THAT MIGHT BE THE FOCUS OF DISCUSSIONS NEXT WEEK OR SOMETHING RIGHT THAT UM WHAT NEED OUT OF THIS AND
IF YOU GET THAT FAR
TRY AND COME EQUIPPED WITH A LIST OF THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU WANT OUT OF IT AND AND SO WE CAN LOOK THROUGH AND SEE
SO UM YOU KNOW IF WE DO TALK ABOUT THAT THEN IT MIGHT BE NICE TO HAVE HER ALONG FOR IT
UM IS IT A PAPER YOU CAN GET
'CAUSE WE WANT WANNA ASK ELLEN AHEAD OF TIME IF SHE WANTS TO COME ALONG FOR A DISCUSSION ABOUT OH WELL THAT'S THAT'S FINE THEN
THERE'S ONLY ONE MESSAGE SO FAR
UH
BU I DON'T THINK THAT LIST IS OUR FINAL WORD ON THINGS AND
OH WELL MAYBE IT IS THEN
SO Y ACTUALLY YOU'RE BREAKING THIS DOWN INTO TWO STEPS NOW
IS THAT TH
OH WELL THAT ALL SOUNDS GOOD
AND AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT'S IT FOR ME
SEE I HAVE TO EXPLAIN
AND I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT THIS IS QUITE A GOOD IDEA 'CAUSE I WORRY ABOUT NOT DOING THE STUFF PEOPLE EXPECT OF ME
SO YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF ME
UH YEAH
SO WE'VE MOVED OVER AND ONTO THE OTHER EYE LINK
SO UH 'CAUSE SHE'S RUNNING AT THE MOMENT
BUT MA
SHOCK AND WORRY AT UH I THINK YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S A MAILING LIST UH AND MM-HMM YEAH
SO THE THE EYE THE THE LIST IS NOW UPDATED
SEE LAST WEEK BY THE TIME EVERYTHING AND AND THEN IT'LL BE HOPEFULLY NO MORE THAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TWENTY MINUTES TODAY TO
YOU MEAN FROM WAS THAT JOE
UH WELL THAT WA THAT WAS RUUD WELL A FEW WEEKS AGO
AND WAS R WAS RUNNING
'CAUSE FRANK DID ALL THAT BECAUSE HE THEN HAD AN EXPERIMENT
UH HE'S HE'S DONE HIS AND GOT HIS AND YES
MAYBE TOO WELL PLACED YEAH
UH YES WITH THE UM THE BLEEP WAS A HARDWARE BLEEP ORIGINALLY
H MM-HMM
YOU HAVE ALTERED THE UM TASK PROGRAMME BECAUSE UH TO PUT THE UM LITTLE EYE ICON AND THE MOUSE UH TO MAKE IT
RATHER THAN JUST A BLOB UH ELLEN WANTED SOMETHING TO LOOK MORE LIKE AN EYE SO THAT YOU KNEW THAT WAS THE EYE
WANT IT A REASONABLE SIZE SO THAT IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT WE KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT THOUGH
UH YES HE'S PRODUCED AN ANOTHER VERSION THAT DOESN'T UH HAVE THE OVERLAP PROBLEM
UM MARLOES DISCOVERED SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THE ORIENTATION OF PARALLELOGRAMS FROM WHEN IT WAS CONSTRUCTED TO WHEN IT APPEARS IN THE UM ACTUAL TASK
SO I'LL CHECK THAT OUT UH TO SEE IF IT REALLY IS A PROBLEM OR NOT
AND BASICALLY THE PARALLELOGRAM WAS APPEARING IN A SORT OF AS A MIRROR IMAGE OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THE UH MODEL BUILDER IN THE ACTUAL YEAH
UH SOMETHING LIKE X. FIG UH CAN OUTPUT THE VERTEX POINTS UM FOR CREATING THE AIR THE ACTUAL POLYGONS IN THE FIRST PLACE
W OR SOMETHING I I UH UH
UH
OR SOMETHING THA YOU KNOW
SO UH NO IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S UH M. S. N.
UH NO IT SH WELL UH UH HOPEFULLY THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PARALLELOGRAM PROBLEM IS
BECAUSE IT IT DOES HAVE SORT OF SUM OF ANGLES AND THINGS
BUT UH NO AS FAR AS UH I MEAN IT
I Y YEAH BUT THAT'S WHY UH WE NO WE'LL ONLY BE WORKING AS I SAY WITH SORT OF SOLID OBVIOUS POLYGONS AND AS PARTS
THE LAST POINT TO THE YEAH
I HAVE NO IDEA EITHER
UH
UH BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WITH IT OTHER THAN DUMP THE DATA
UH THEY WELL THEY DUMPED IT ON THE MM B. S. C. C. W. SERVER
BUT I'VE MOVED WELL I HAVEN'T MOVED IT I'VE COPIED IT ONTO THE C. S. V. YEAH
NOTHING FURTHER IS
UH
AND I'VE UH SENT A THING OFF TO MARLOES TALK TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HER AGAIN TO REGISTER FOR THE C. S. V. AND UH AND WHAT TO THE C. V. S. AND UH WHA WHAT TO DO AND UH WHICH BIT OF SOFTWARE I USE THAT SEEMS TO BE QUITE EASY AND SIMPLE
WELL YES AND NO AS IN YES IT'S NEW AND NO I HAVEN'T GOT A PROBLEM
OH SO FAR
UH AND I AM JUST USING IT THROUGH UM A WINDOWS BOLT ON SORT OF PIECE OF SOFTWARE
NO I'VE JUST YEAH STRAIGHT FORWARD AND THEN YOU JUST RIGHT RIGHT YEAH R AND RIGHT CLICK THINGS IN IN WINDOWS EXPLORER
ON A DAY LIKE THIS I KNOW IT'S A YEAH
THE ONLY THING THAT'S BEEN GOING AROUND IS THE VERSION OF THE FLIER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT REAL PURPOSE OF UH THESE LITTLE FOLDED UP A. FOUR FLIERS
BUT IT THERE'S THAT'S WHAT'S CIRCULATING AROUND THE THE GROUP AS A WHOLE AT THE MOMENT
AND WE'RE ALL OFF ON THE FOURTEENTH OF DECEMBER
COMING BACK ON THE FRIDAY
THAT'S A SO THAT'S HOW TO HIRE OR HOW TO INTERVIEW IS THAT THAT UH BOOK
UH WHAT EL UH WELL I'LL HAVE TO GET TO GRIPS WITH CRA CAMTASIA UH PROPERLY UH TO GENERATE A LITTLE SORT OF INTRODUCTORY VIDEO I SUPPOSE UH FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPERIMENT
SO PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE UH AND SO THAT THE P YOU KNOW EXAMPLE MOVEMENTS UH AND THINGS LIKE THAT WILL BE
UH NO THAT MUST HAVE BEEN BEFORE ME
SO UH UH UH P IT
SO THE I MEAN TH I DON'T THINK I THINK IT'D BE MORE SENSIBLE JUST TO DO THE NON THE THE VIDEO PART OF IT FIRST AND THEN YOU ADD THE VOICE OVER AFTERWARDS
MIGHT USE
OR ARE YOU GOING TO PRIME THEM IN ANY WAY
IF YOU START TALKING ABOUT HAVE TO AVOID OR UH YEAH TALKING ABOUT THE PARTS OR JUST NAMING THEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
OR DID NO N NO NOISE IN FACT I THINK IS PROBABLY UH YES
SO IF THEY MAKE MOVE A PIECE AND IT BREAKS AND THEY DON'T HEAR THIS CRASH AND THEY GO OH WHAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED
IS THAT REALLY ALL WHAT HAPPENED
YES BUT UH OR IN OUR DISCUSSION WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED UH IT WAS ASSUMED THERE'D BE A VOICE OVER
YES 'CAUSE WE'VE GOT TO THINK OF THE INSTRUCTIONS AND SORT OF BASIC INTRODUCTION TO IT ALL AS WELL
BUT IT PROBABLY I S I SUSPECT SO BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD A REPLY BACK
YEAH TOO TOO UH IT WAS JUST IN CASE THEY HAD SOMETHING THAT WHAT
UM OH UH T UH NO UM TH IT'S NOT GOT IT'S UH YEAH IT'S I WELL B ACTUALLY I COULD PROBABLY JUST PHOTO COPY THE MANUAL
UH OH I'VE HOPEFULLY WELL I WON'T HOPEFULLY NEED IT FOR MORE THAN ANOTHER WEEK OR TWO ANYWAY
SO AS LONG AS YOU CAN HOLD OFF HIS NO NO
UH NO NOT EVEN THAT
THEY'VE OF THIS RELEVANT TYPE TO WHAT WE'RE WANTING TO USE PROBABLY THREE
UH WE'VE TO GENERATE SIXTEEN IN TOTAL
UH I'LL TR I'LL TRY THE GOOD OLD GOOGLE AND SEE IF THERE IS UH IF THERE ARE SOME SORT OF RANKING SITES OR WHATEVER
UH
MM WELL OR MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T USE MM ANYTHING LIKE THAT I SUPPOSE FOR
AS LITTLE AS IT IS BUT YEAH
UM OH I FOUND HAVEN'T FOUNT IT PHYSICALLY YET BUT UH A REFERENCE TO UH A NINETY TWO PAPER
IT'S IN THE ROYAL PROCEEDINGS OF SOMETHING OR OTHER SOMEWHERE BASED ON A UM AN EXPERIMENT THAT HAD BLOCKS A MODEL
BLOCKS OF PARTS AND THEN AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE HAD TO BUILD YOU KNOW REPLICATE THE MODEL OUT WITH THE PARTS
UH JUST ONE PERSON AT A TIME OF COURSE
BUT UH IT DID INVOLVE UM EYE MOVEMENTS AND MONITORING WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING COMPARED TO THEIR HAND MOVEMENTS AND UH THAT SUBJECT
SO THERE SHOULD STILL BE WELL NOT THAT ON
IS IT
UH THAT'S WHAT I'VE M I'LL HAVE TO TRY AND FIND OUT
IF NOT UM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IS BOUND TO HAVE IT
OH IS THAT WHAT YEAH SHE'S GOT A MM YAHOO ACCOUNT OR SOMETHING THAT THINGS ARE GETTING FORWARDED TO AND
AH
OR OR OH WELL
THAT'S ONLY IF THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING THROUGH
AH
THE THE THERE'S THE PROVISIONAL LIST OF WHAT WE NEED ON THE WIKI ANYWAY THAT I PUT IT UP
BUT UH OR WHEN I ADDED IT
UNLESS Y
SO SO EVERYONE ON THAT LIST HAS NOW BEING REMINDED
YEAH DON'T STORE ANYTHI ANYTHING SENSITIVE ON YEAH DON'T STORE ANYTHING YOU YOU CARE ABOUT ON THE MACHINES
YEAH WITH THE YEAH I MEAN I DI I DI I DID DO HARD DRI HARD DRIVE CHECK UM AND A MEMORY CHECK
AND IT SAYS THERE'S NO UH THERE'S NO PROBLEMS BUT SOMETHING CAUSED IT TO GO WRONG IN THE FIRST PLACE
WE'LL JUST FINGERS CROSSED AND HOPE HO YEAH HO HOPE THAT ALL THIS IS JUST A SOFTWARE THING THAT WE CAN JUST FIX LIKE THAT AND THAT'LL BE IT
YEAH I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S SO WHAT WE YEAH ONE ONE FOR ONE
ONE WE'LL TRY AND GET DONE TODAY YEAH GET GET WINDOWS BACK ON THERE
TRY AND GET CAMTASIA ON THERE AND GET THAT TESTED OUT
NO I HAVE TO MANAGE TO GET AT THINGS WORKING ON ON MONDAY
SO THAT THAT EVERYTHING WENT DOWN LIKE ON THE TUESDAY MORNING
UM SO MY M I SHOULD GET EVERYTHING WORKING ON THE UM YEAH ON MONDAY
UM I HAD DINNER I WASN'T ACTUALLY AT DINNER BUT I D HAVE THE EYE TRACKER STUFF WORKING 'CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME RUNNING ROUN RUNNING ROUND THE LAB
BUT UM BUT IT LOO IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS DOING ALL THE CALIBRATION AND DRIFT CORRECTION THINGS THAT S ELLEN WAS WANTING ON IT
DON'T S DON'T SOUND DON'T SOUND FAMILIAR
YEAH SO I'LL TRY AND TRY AND GET CAMTASIA UP AND RUNNING SO I CAN TRY IT OUT WHEN WHEN WHEN WE'VE GOT HER COMING IN
AND WE'LL JUST SORT OF DO A RUN THROUGH OF PROPER PILOT JUST TO JUST JUST SO I CAN SEE TH
UM YEAH I'LL MAKE SURE MAKE SURE THEY CAN ACTUALLY PICK UP THE F UM AUDIO SIGNAL AS WELL
SO AS LONG AS AND WHAT WE'LL HAVE DONE IS JUST GONNA SET UP SO THE UH WHATEVER THE ASTERISK SOUND IS ON WINDOWS IS WHAT GETS PLAYED
SO SO JUST CHANGE SOUND TO WHATEVER YOU LIKE JUST GO THROUGH THE WINDOWS CONTROL PANEL
UM SO LA LAST WEEK I TRIED IT WITH A ONE KILO HERTZ SOUND
DID IT WITH TEN KILO HERTZ AND IT'S JUST REALLY CLEAR WHERE YOU CAN TELL EXACTLY WHERE EXACTLY WHERE THE BEEP IS NOW
SO THA IT'S JU JUST A MATTER OF UM YEAH YOU JUST BA BASICALLY JUST PLAY IT
YEP YEAH THE THE ONE THE ONE IN JUST INSTALLED SHOULD HAVE THAT NOW
UH NO THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE AS THE AS THE ORIGINAL BLOBS BASICALLY
UH I'LL TRY IT
SO SO YOU CAN YOU CAN DO IT IN X. FIG EXPORT THEM AS S. V. G. AND YOU JUST GET A YOU JUST GET A LIST OF X. Y. COORDINATES
UM AND THEN I'LL JUST WRITE IN A LITTLE SCRIPT THAT TURNS THOSE X. Y. COORDINATES INTO A PART
SO SO LONG AS I'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT WILL OUTPUT S. V. G.
SO I'LL ALS I'LL ALSO HAVE A LOOK HAVE A LOOK AT THAT
BUT THE THERE'S THERE MUST BE PLENTY OF WINDOWS THINGS FOR TH THAT I O OUTPUT S. V. G.
MIN UH I KNO I KNOW I KNOW
UM SO OTH BUT OTHER I I'D B I'D BE VERY SURPRISED IF THERE WASN'T A FREE PACKAGE FOR DOING IT
UM I HA I HAVE A FEELING THAT THE UM AMAYA THE W. THREE C. BROWSER DOES IT
UM WHEN WILL YEAH BUT NO I'LL I'LL CREATE A C I'LL CREATE A CONVEX PART UM JUST SO NEXT WEEK UM JU YEAH
BUT IT JUST IT IT JUST JUST HAPPENED TO BE A CONVEX PART THAT I WAS THAT I WAS I WAS PLAYING WITH
UM S SO IT'S SORTA LIKE A B
BUT UM ONES ONES YOU ONES THAT ACTUALLY HAD TURN UP INTO PARTS LIST UH IT CREATES A CLOSED POLYGON BY LINKING THE L END POINT TO THE START POINT
SO SO SO AS LONG AS THEY'RE THEY'RE DRAWN WELL ENOUGH IT SHOULD BE ALRIGHT
BUT IT MI IT MIGHT BE WORTH JUST CHECKING WHAT SOFTWARE THEY ARE USING 'CAUSE IT MIGHT CREA IT MIGHT CREATE OUTPUTS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM X. FIG
THAT SHOULD THAT SHOULD BE FUN
UM SO I'LL I CA I CAN EASY DOUBLE CHECK IF UH NIJMEGEN CAN'T FIND ANYTHING
COPY AND PASTE THE STUFF OUT THE OFF OFF THE WIKI
YEAH I MEAN UH ALSO DOUBLE CHECKED IN THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA W COULD ACCESS THE C. V. S. FROM HOME WHEN I WAS WORKING FROM HOME LAST LAST WEEK
UM ON THURSDAY I MANAGED TO MANAGED TO GET IN AND JUST JUST CHECK THE STUFF AND MAKE SURE IT WAS ALL MAKE SURE TH MAKE SURE MA MAKE SURE I COULD ACCESS IT
SO NOT YET I'M AFRAID
UH WELL ON ONCE UH ONCE I'VE TRIED OUT THE CAMTASIA STUFF I'LL SEE IF THE IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS GONNA TR GONNA TRY AND FIX THEM
NEXT TIME I'M WORKING ON THIS UH G. D. F. STUFF UM SO SO I'VE I'VE I PU UH PUT ON A D. T. D. AND A SAMPLE X. M. L. FILE ON THE WIKI FOR THE G. D. F.
SO IT'S BA BASED ON SOME STUFF YOU PUT ON THERE ON THE G. D. F. SPECIFICATION
YEAH I MEAN WITH I CHA I CHANGED A COUPLE OF THINGS FROM YOUR ORIGINAL DRAFT
SO THE THE YOU YOU YOU HAD A YOU HAD A THING CALL I THINK IT'S MOULD OR SO OR SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID WHICH IS SORT OF TO CREATE A NEW PART
SO I'M NOT SU SO I'M NOT NOT SURE IF YOU WANNA KEEP THE MOULD OR NOT
UH
YEAH BUT IT'S IT'S JUST THE G. D. F. SPECIFICATION PAGE ON THE UH ON THE WIKI
I'VE UH I MEAN I'LL TRY TRY TO PUT IN JUSTIFICATION FOR FOR THE CHANGE THAT I MADE UH ON THE PAGE
SO UM BUT I'VE I'VE SENT IT OUT FOR REVIEW SO THAT S ANYONE WHO IS GONNA USING THE FORMAT CAN HAVE A LOOK AT IT
WELL THE ONES THAT THIS STUFF I MEAN IS IT'S HELPFUL
IT WAS HELPFUL FOR ME TO PUTTING IT UP ON THE WIKI 'CAUSE I COULD ACTUALLY THIN THINK ABOUT IT AS I PUT IT UP AND SAY WELL THIS IS THIS IS WHY AND TH THIS IS WHY I WANNA DO THINGS THIS WAY
WELL UH WELL I KN I KNOW ON CAMTASIA IF YOU GOT A CA IF YOU'VE GOT A CAMTASIA PROJECT
SO SO WE JUST ENDED THE JUST ENDED THE THE DUTCH STREAM YEAH THE VIDEO AND OUR AUDIO
AND THEN THEY CAN EASY CREATE THEIR AUDIO OUT OF MM FROM THAT OUTP
WELL ONE THING UH ONE ONE THING THAT CAMTASIA CAN DO YOU CAN HAVE LITTLE VIDEOS WHEN OTHER HAVEN'T GOTTEN GOT ANY CAMERAS FOR DOING THAT
THAT'S A S THAT'S PSYCHOLOGY THING HOW HARD THEY
UM SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS ACTUALLY CREATE AN OUTPUT UH A G. D. F. OUTPUT PART TO IT
I'LL GET GET WORKING ON THE CAMTASIA STUFF THIS WEEK AND THEN SO ONCE UH ONCE UH ONCE WE'VE GOT SOME SOME IDEA ABOUT WHAT ANALYSIS YOU WANT OUT OF THIS
I CAN THINK ABOUT WHETHER G. D. F. 'S GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED IN IT
'CAUSE THEY I MEAN WE W WE GOT ALL THIS IN THE ASCII FORMAT AT THE MOMENT AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHAT DATA DO WE NEED TO PULL OUT OF THAT INTO THE G. D. F. SO I CAN ACTUALLY DO THE PROPER ANALYSIS
UM 'CAUSE I THINK ALL THE ANSWERS ARE GONNA BE RUN OFF THE G. D. F. FORMAT 'CAUSE 'CAUSE WE'VE DECIDED THAT IF WE WENT AND LOOKED WELL IF WE'RE LOOKING AT DYNAMIC REASONS AND WHATEVER ELSE
WHICH IS YEAH WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE TO DO IT OFF THE G. D. F. AS AS OPPOSED TO THE E. D. F. FORMAT
SO SO THE G. D. F. IT'S GOT YEAH SO IT'S IT'S GOT UH THE ALL TH THE STUFF ON THE UM E. D. F.
AND THEN YEAH YEAH AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT G. D. F. CAN ALSO IT WILL ALSO HAVE INFORMATION SUCH AS RIGHT
AT THIS POINT IN TIME THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE NEW PARTS AREA OR THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE TARGET
SO THE THE G. D. F. IS GONNA HAVE THAT SORT OF INFORMATION IN IT
AND THEN ALSO 'CAUSE IT'S X. M. L. FILE WE CAN THEN DO X. S. L. T. OR WHATEVER ON TO IT TO GET EXTRACT WHATEVER BITS OF DATA YOU NEED FOR YEAH
I MEAN IF YOU'RE EVER YOU KNOW LATE 'CAUSE OF THAT IT'S NOT WE'LL FIND A WAY AROUND IT
I WAS TH SO WHAT'D THEY HAVE TO DO BACK UP
AH
GO I WE'RE GLAD THEY'LL LOOK AFTER THAT BIT
OH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S DOING
UM THE OH WELL UM I DON'T KNOW THE MOZILLA STUFF
UH WELL Y TH THERE ARE CERTAIN COMPANIES UM THAT I DON'T WANNA NAME WHO DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT
I C BUT M YEAH MOZILLA
YEAH BUT MOST M MOST BROWSERS WHEN WHEN YOU UH PUT AN X. M. L. FILE UP IN IT
IT'LL JUST APPLY SOME DEFAULT STYLE SHEET TO IT ANYWAY THAT SHOWS YOU
EV EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THESE THINGS
UM BUT SINCE I HAVEN'T TRIED IT THIS PARTICULAR WAY YOU KNOW UM BUT YEAH THAT SOUNDS GOOD
SO UM I SO YOU SAY WE HAVEN'T FINALISED WHAT THE G. D. F. LOOKS LIKE
IS THAT AN IMPLICIT REQUEST FOR ME TO DO SOMETHING
AS A WELL I MEAN THERE'S TWO TWO CASES IN HERE RIGHT
U WHETHER YOU CONSIDER G. D. F. FORMAT TO BE UM THE THING THAT'S JUST THE STRAIGHT FORWARD TRANSLATIONS OF WHAT'S IN THE ORIGINAL EYE TRACKING OUTPUT
SO Y ARE YOU WORKING UH ACTIVELY ON THIS ANAL THESE ANALYSIS THINGS OR YOU JUST WORKING ON THE TRANSLATION
UH SO THE DATA FORMAT TRANSLATION
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE BUT WE SHOULD CHECK WHAT OTHER THINGS WERE BEFORE THIS ON THE LIST OF THINGS TO DO
UNTIL YOU GET THE OH MICROPHONES
IT IS I SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE M YEAH
SO YOU CAN FIND OUT WHETHER THEY HAVE IT
AH YEAH
YEAH THEN YOU KNOW PUT YOUR MIND AT REST
'CAUSE YOU KNOW YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT TO BE THE MORNING YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE RECORDING AND THEN SUDDENLY DISCOVER YEAH
UH CHECK THEY GOT 'EM FIRST THOUGH
'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE AN AREA TO WALK THROUGH IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANYTHING OUT OF IT
SO OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE ON THE WIKI DO I NEED TO PULL UP THE WIKI
AH IT IS GONNA LET ME LOG IN
UH YEAH NO NO
OH SO HE'S GOT OURS LEFT
BUT NO HE WAS BILLING FOR HE WAS BILLING BY THE HOUR
OH WELL THEY'RE PROBABLY AWAY THEN
OH YEAH IT COULD BE IT
OH YOU HAVE NO MODELS AT ALL
UH HE WOULDN'T HAVE SENT IT JUST TO ME WOULD HE
UH
OH HE JUST WANTS TO KNOW HOW TO GET PAID
SO WELL I SUPPOSE HE WON'T COME BY 'CAUSE CRAIG'S ON HIS DESK
UH WELL I SO THE LAST THING I'VE GOT FROM HIM ABOUT WORK WORK WAS THE NINETEENTH OF OCTOBER THAT SAID HE UPLOADED SOME CHANGES THAT YOU WANTED
OH SO YOU DIDN'T GET THAT
IT WAS ME AND HIM
BUT PRESUMABLY THE HE PUT IT ON THE WIKI
SO HE'S JUST TELLING US 'CAUSE HE THINGS WE PROBABLY DON'T READ WIKIS
S I HAVEN'T REPLIED TO HIM ABOUT UM
SO UM BUT THAT SUGGESTS HE'S AT AT THE END OF THINGS BUT W WE COULD JUST ASK HIM
UH RIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT IT DOES AND MAKING SURE IT DOES WHAT YOU WANT I GUESS
SO TH THE PROBLEM IS YOU WANT YOU WANTED TO CONSTRUCT SOME MODELS IN IT FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT BUT YOU WERE HOPING TO GET SOME FROM MARLOES
AH YEAH YEAH
THAT'S WHAT I DO WHEN I NEED THINGS THAT
YEAH OR RE CHANGE THE SCHEDULE
UM SUBJECTS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE D
SO S Y Y YOU DON'T HAVE SUBJECTS LINED UP BUT YOU DON'T EXPECT ANY TROUBLE GETTING THEM
BY
SO THEY WELL THEY NEED TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT IT
WHO WHO'S THEIR IS THAT A STAFF MEMBER OR A STUDENT
IS IT A
UM IT'S JUST SOMETIMES UH ACADEMIC STAFF HAVE A BIT OF A CHIP ABOUT UM RESEARCH STAFF
AND SINCE I DON'T KNOW THE PERSON I CAN'T TELL WHETHER IT'S ONE OF THOSE OR NOT
SO I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE BOOKING SYSTEM WORKS
UM I V MIGHT TALK TO ELLEN ABOUT THAT AHEAD OF TIME 'CAUSE UH THEY MAY HAVE SHE AND MARTIN MAY HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT APPROPRIATE USE OF THE LAB
S SO IN THE WORST CASE UM YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT IF YOU ACTUALLY NEED THAT WEEK THAT YOU CAN COLLECT IN THE MORNINGS THAT WEEK
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S KNOWN OUTSIDE ELLEN'S HEAD
IT'S ON THE W BOOKING SYSTEM
OH WELL
OF COURSE TRY TO BE KIND TO OTHER PEOPLE
SO THOSE ARE THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE WORRYING YOU CAMTASIA AND LAB ACCESS
OH AND THE MODEL BUILDERS YEAH
H UH-HUH
THESE THIS IS GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WHILE
YEAH BUT YOU WERE GONNA TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO OVERLAY SOMETHING ON TOP OF THE VIDEO THAT OR NO
YOU WERE JUST G REALLY GONNA RUN A VIDEO OF THE SEP OF THE TRIAL
TH THE UM WHICH ONE YOU IS GONNA LOOK AT WHAT IT DOES SO FAR AND YOU'LL JUST T TRY OUT DO THAT
UM HOW MANY MODELS WERE YOU RELYING ON HER FOR
WELL WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS IS YOUR START TIME GONNA BE DELAYED 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MODELS READY IF SHE DOESN'T COME THROUGH
UM CAN YOU DRAFT CRAIG IN TO BUILD SOME IF NECESSARY
YOU KNOW I IF IT'S NOT THAT SEE YOU KNOW
BUT PRESUMABLY WHATEVER IT IS THEY'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH IS NOW OVER
I'D JUST HATE FOR THAT TO C UM TO SLOW YOU UP IN COLLECTING STUFF THAT'S ALL
OBVIOUS YEAH UH OKAY THAT'S TRUE
YOU'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF THINGS TO UM F DO THAT WE HAVEN'T SET YOU UP FOR ANY TIME SOON
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING FROM ME FOR THAT 'CAUSE THAT'S ALREADY SORTA SPECED
I MEAN AGAIN THAT'S THE PAIR OF YOU
OR WILL THERE BE TIMES WHEN YOU DON'T RECORD ALL DAY
'CAUSE HE MIGHT OH YEAH NO NO NO I UNDERSTAND THAT
IT WAS IT WAS MORE LIKE OH IT WAS MORE LIKE YOU KNOW
YOU SO THIS WEEK HE'S GOT YOU KNOW THE G. D. F. STUFF TO DO
WHAT I DO DON'T KNOW IS WE WANNA BOTHER WITH A PART BUILDER
OR DO Y
M YEAH BUT NOW NOW THAT THE GUY BUILDING THESE MODELS KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO DO THE ROTSYM SOME STUFF
SO HOW HOW MANY PERSON DAYS WOULD IT BE WORTH LIKE IF CRAIG DISCOVERED IT COULD BE DONE IN X. DAYS
YOU YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S THINGS ABOUT THIS PROJECT WE'VE HIDDEN FROM YOU SO FAR THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT
OH THAT ONE'LL JUST BE A LITTLE ADD ON
IT TAKES STAND OFF LINKS AND STUFF AND IT'S UM SOME SOME PEOPLE IF THEY'RE NOT USED TO LINGUISTIC ANNOTATION C UM UH IT C TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO GET THEIR HEAD AROUND THE WAY THE DO DATA DATA MODEL WORKS
OH R RIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY NEXT WEEK
THAT SHOULD BE FUN
THAT COMES AT AN IDEAL TIME FOR YOU THEN
YEAH ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN
OH WELL
UH
SO UM IT'LL BE LIKE IN UH MONITOR
WELL EYES AND MOUSE
EYES AND MICE
OH SO YOU DON'T WANT A PA UH PART OF THIS DATA
AYE
WITH IS IT IS IT PART OF SO TH THESE ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE SETS OF CODES AGAINST TIME RIGHT
BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE BLINKING BASICALLY IT'S LIKE AN A NIL CODE
THAT YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT
OH I HOPE N NOT TO MUCH RELIES ON MISSING STUFF 'CAUSE PEOPLE BLINK
AND YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE TIMES WHEN YOU WANNA TREAT THAT AS ONE THING RIGHT
IN THAT CASE THEN UM THESE TIERS ARE ALREADY LIKE BLINK CORRECTED
YOU'D WANT BLINKS AS A SEPARATE TIER IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IT IN
YEAH SO THE KEY THING IS HE HERE IS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE
UH YEAH I SUPPOSE IF YOU KNOW ABOUT EYE TRACKERS THEN YOU'LL JUST KNOW
BUT WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW IS LIKE AT WHAT STAGE IN THE EYE TRACKING STUFF WHERE IT DOES THAT AND WHETHER THAT GETS THROUGH SO THAT UM CRAIG GETS IT AUTOMATICALLY IN WHAT HE'S TRANSLATING OR TO G. D. F.
WHETHER HE NEEDS TO REDO THE SAME ANALYSIS BECAUSE SOMETHING ABOUT THE DATA PATH CUTS OFF THAT ANALYSIS FOR THE EYE TRACKER
SO YOU KNOW IT IT TREATS IT AS A FIXATION AROUND BLINKS AND IT ALSO JUST HAPPENS TO TELL YOU WHERE THE BLINKS ARE
'CAUSE IT IF YOU'RE JUST ADDING THE LENGTH OF THE BLINK TO THE FIXATION YOU'RE NOT TREATING IT AS A SACCADE
I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE MULTIPLE FIXATIONS ON AN OBJECT
WELL IT'S NOT OKAY I MEAN THIS IS KINDA WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THIS CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE G. D. F.
I MEAN YOU MIGHT SEE IT AS THE INITIAL G. D. F. IS JUST WHATEVER STRAIGHT FORWARDLY TRANSLATES WITHOUT
SO I SEE THIS AS YOU KNOW
A BUNCH OF LITTLE ROUTINES THAT TAKE THE THE G. D. F. WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION IN IT AND ADD NEW INFORMATION INTO TH SUB SCRIPT VERSIONS OF THE G. D. F. FILE THAT CONTAINS THESE POST PROCESS ANALYSES
I MEAN IT TO SOME EXTENT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH DATA FORMAT IT'S IN N. X. T. OR G. D. F.
ALL IT DOES IS DO THIS THIS STUPID DATA FORMAT CONVERSION
AND IT IT'S JUST YOU KNOW SEPARATING IT OUT IN THE LITTLE STEPS
SO YOU KNOW THERE HAVE TO BE THESE OTHER SCRIPTS THAT ADD ANY UM DATA TRANSFORMS UM NOT DATA FORMAT TRANSFORM FORMS BUT DATA TRANSFORMS
SO Y YOU KNOW I IF WE KEEP IT SIMPLER LIKE THAT SO THAT IT'S IN LITTLE PIECES
YOU WANNA KNOW WHETHER IT'S ONE OF THESE LITTLE POST PROCESSES GOING WRONG OR WHETHER IT'S JUST THE THING THAT DUMPS IT INTO THE MULTIPLE FILES FOR THE AND G. D. F. TO N. X. T. TRANSFORM IS C IS PRETTY SIMPLE
SO THAT'S LIKE ALL THE ANALYSIS THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO THINGS
ARE YOU JUST GONNA COPY WHAT THEY DO
AH
I'M JUST THINKING YOU KNOW LIKE I SO THIS TAKES THE ASCII TO TO A D SIMPLIFIED ASCII
THAT YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE THE AND ALS WELL WHY DO I THINK THIS
UH YEAH I CAN IMAGINE I CAN IMAGINE THAT ALSO REQUIRING SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER WHAT THEY DO IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANNA DO
UH
AND IF IN DOUBT UM DON'T FILTER STUFF OUT KEEP IT IN RIGHT
'CAUSE WE ALWAYS DUMP IT TO THIS OTHER N. X. T. TRACK THAT WE DON'T NEED TO LOAD NECESSARILY
SO UM THE IDEA IS YOU JUST KEEP STUFF UNLESS
OH YEAH AND IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO DUMP STUFF INTO AN INTO SEPARATE TRACK
W WE GOTTA TEACH YOU ABOUT THIS AT SOME POINT THOUGH
SO JONATHAN MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO UM TELL YOU ABOUT IT WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVED 'CAUSE YOU WERE GONNA GET OVERLOAD ABOUT LEARNING EYE TRACKERS AND NO
IT'S JUST TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE AND IT WASN'T IMPORTANT THAT IT BE THEN
IS IT SLIDING PAST
IS EVERYTHING GOING SMOOTH
AS LONG AS IT COMES OUT IN THE END
THE THEY'RE THEY'RE DUE UH I I WAS TOLD THE BEGINNING OF THIS WEEK
UM TH THEY ARE QUITE STRANGE
MM UH UH IT'S W UH R UM A AVRIL HAS ORDERED THEM FROM SOMEWHERE POSSIBLY
N NO
THE THEY SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE LAST WEEK
BUT UH CAROLINE THEN PHONED UP TO CHASE THEM AND THEY THEY WERE S THEY WERE TOLD TO BE HERE
UH R B WELL WE CAN STILL TEST WHETHER CAMTASIA RUNS ANYWAY
UH RIGHT
IT NO IT'S TWO BATTERIES WE NEED
UH NO NO
D UM
THE ONLY THING THAT WELL THE THING THAT'S HOLDING S ME SLIGHTLY UP IS UM CHECKING WHETHER JOE'S F FINISHED THAT THERE I THERE IS A WORKING UM MODEL BUILDER
YEAH HE STILL HAD N HOURS LEFT
I WASN'T SURE UH IF IT WAS DOWN TO THE NUMBER OF HOURS OR WHETHER THIRTY FIRST OF OCTOBER F UH CERTAINLY UH UH HE RIGHT
BUT UH N I'VE N NI NIJMEGEN HAS GONE DEAD FOR ALL THOSE LAST TWO WEEKS
N NO UM BUT I THINK WHAT THEY HAD WAS SOME BIG REVIEW
WELL WE DON'T NEED TO UM MAKE THE THE PARTS ARE ALL THE STANDARD TANGRAM ONES I HAD BEFORE ANYWAY
UM YEAH IF YOU GOT RIGHT
HOW R F HOW RECENTLY THAT NOTHING I HAVEN'T I HEARD ANYTHING FROM JOE FOR A A WEEK OR SO ANYWAY
IT'S THE LAST THING WAS IN SP RESPONSE TO THE THING I WAS SAYING LAST WEEK ABOUT THE PARALLELOGRAM BEING THE WRONG WAY AROUND AND UH W FROM THE MODEL BUILDER TO THE ACTUAL YEAH
UM THAT NOTHING HAS I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING SINCE FROM EITHER SORT OF THE NETHERLANDS OR FROM YOU
OH IS HE BACK
OH IS HE
OH NO RIGHT OKAY
YES OR AT L LEAST UM SHE WAS MEANT TO HAVE HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY
'CAUSE THEY D THEY D HAVE ACTUALLY RUN THINGS AND TO UH GET AN IDEA OF THE SORT OF STYLE AND TO CHECK THAT THEY'D BE ALRIGHT
UH NO IT HAS JUST BEEN EMAIL RATHER THAN UH F F THE TELEPHONE TYPE OF UH REQUEST
WHAT'S THE SEVENTH IS A W A WEEK TODAY I THINK
BUT UH WE'RE WE'RE NEEDING WE'RE CERTAINLY NEEDING SOME DATA IN THE BAG BY THE FIRST OF DECEMBER I THINK
THE ONLY OTHER SLIGHT COMPLICATION IS UM WHICH WILL BE B I THINK BROUGHT UP AT THE MEETING ON THURSDAY FOR ALL THE EYE TRACKING USERS
HAVE DI
BUT UH IT'S SORT OF QUITE SOLIDLY BOOKED UH FOR F CERTAINLY W WHAT SIX DAYS FROM TEN TILL FIVE FOR TWO OR THREE OF THOSE DAYS
UM I WOULDN'T I NO I CAN PROBABLY AT LEAST EMAIL HER AND ASK HER UH IF SHE'S REALLY NEEDING IT ALL THAT TIME
I I WELL YEAH AT THE M YEP
WHEN PEOPLE JUST UH IF THEY CAN LOG ON TO IT CAN BOOK IT
UH I TH IN THEORY JAST IS MEANT TO HAVE IT EVERY MORNING
UH NO
UH YES IT'S UM IT'S ON THE P UH IT'S NOT ON THE BOOKING SYSTEM
IT'S ON A WEB PAGE THAT FRANK CREATED ABOUT THE LAB
I'VE ALSO GOT TO GET CAMTASIA WE WELL YES THE M THE MODEL BUILDER
I'VE GOT TO GET CAMTASIA WORKING UM AS A SORT OF LITTLE MULTI MEDIA THING TO GENERATE A VIDEO OF HOW TO MI SORT OF A AN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO
UM I'VE I UH IT HASN'T BEEN DIVIDED UP IN THAT SORT OF WAY
UM DEPENDS HOW QUICKLY I MANAGE TO GET A GRIP OF IT HOW LONG IT TAKES ME TO GENERATE THEM OR HOW I GET ON WITH THE CAMTASIA
IT IT SHOULDN'T THE THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY GREAT UH PROBLEMS
WELL I'LL TRY AND GET AHOLD OF HER AGAIN TODAY AND SEE WHAT
UH N UM NO
UH I CAN'T JUST GO IN LET THEM GET START AND THEN COME BACK
IT'S UH SO SOME PEOPLE CAN BUT
W
UH IT STARTS THE UH ON WE THIS WEDNESDAY AND GOES THROUGH TO NEXT WEDNESDAY
UH YEAH
FOR I'VE GOT TWO WEEKS OF THAT FO FOUR LECTURES AND FOUR LABS
UH YES
UH NO I SUPPOSE RATHER THAN BEING NOBODY'S BOTHERED SO FAR IS IT
UH WELL I DON'T REMEMBER BEING ASKED FOR AN INDUCTION
IN APRIL
I HAVE ONE N. X. T. QUESTION WHICH HOPEFULLY WON'T BE WELL IT'S NOT ONE
IS THAT CORRECT
DOES THAT T JUST IN IN SORT OF LAYERS LIKE THAT
M THAT'S THAT'S JUST THE THE EYE MOVEMENT UH OTHER SORT OF STUFF YEAH
UH YEAH WHATEVER THAT IS
I SUPPOSE IT COULD GO IN
UH I MEAN I SUPPOSE IT WE'RE AS WELL TO HAVE IT IF WE CAN
M UH YES MM-HMM
BLINKING AT THE SAME TIME AS THE OTHER PERSON WAS DOING SOMETHING I THINK TO MM-HMM
NORMAN NORMALLY UH WOULD BE JUST AS I SAY LIKE ADD THE BLINK TIME AND DURATION TO THE PREVIOUS FIXATION
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT ABSORBING ANY NEW INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHAT THE CRITICAL SORT OF DECIDING FACTOR IS
SO I I YEAH WOULD HA IT WOULD BE AS A SEPARATE TIER WHERE JUST TO MARK
WHAT'S INCLUDED AND WHAT'S N YEAH
KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND WHAT NOT TO YEAH
THEN IT'S UH I IT IS AT TH HMM AT WHAT STAGE
THE SOFTWARE THAT I'VE USED UH P POOLS UH THE BLINKS SO WILL ADD IT ON
YEAH SO I'M NOT SU I CERTAINLY IT'S LISTED AS A SEPARATE EVENT IN THE STREAM
BLINKS ARE A TAG UH FROM THE E. D. F. AND AND THAT SORT OF THING
SO BASICALLY THE TIME FROM WHEN SOMEBODY STARTS LOOKING AT AN OBJECT UNTIL THEY LEAVE IT
SO IT'S JUST THE TIME IN TO THE TIME OUT
IT SHOULD JUST BE A MATTER OF TREATING A B ADDING ON THE BLINK TO THE LAST FIXATION OR SOMETHING ANYWAY
SO THE THEY W FIXATION DURATION ISN'T DOESN'T INCLUDE THE BLINK IN THE ASCII A OUTPUT
IS IT IT'S A A SORT OF COMPOSITE UH VIEWING TIME
UH YEAH I'M AFRAID UH MM-HMM
ALTHOUGH WE'LL ALSO STILL NEED A COUNT OF THE FIXATIONS JUST SO WE CAN HAVE YOU YOU'VE GOT MEASURE FIXATION DURATION AGAIN JUST TO S SEE IF THOSE THEY SPEND LONGER JUST F AMOUNT OF MORE STABLE MOVE UH EYE FIXATION OR NOT
UH
TO YE YEAH MM-HMM
BUT THAT'S WHAT I WANT OUT IN THE END
UH
AN
THAT'S ALSO WHY I SENT YOU THE MM SAARBRUECKEN SOFTWARE F THAT UH THE STUFF THAT TAKES THE ASCII SORT OF FORMAT ORIGINALLY AND THEN JUST UH SORT OF COMPRESSES IT AND THINGS
UH BECAUSE THAT LITTLE UTILITY UM DOES THINGS LIKE T WELL BUT YOU CAN TELL IT TO WHAT TO DO WITH BLINKS
UH WHAT THE MINIMUM FIXATION DURATION FOR A STABLE FIXATION WOULD BE SORT OF YOU HAVE IF IT PICKS UP T FIXATIONS LESS THAN SAY FIFTY MILLISECONDS
YOU CAN TELL IT JUST TO AGAIN LUMP THEM ALL TOGETHER THAT'S NOT A SORT OF RELIABLE ENOUGH FIXATION
UH YOU CAN PUT IN THESE SORT OF OF THINGS
UH NO THERE'S VERY LITTLE DOCUMENTATION AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE FOR THESE SORT OF THINGS
AND IT CAN STRI IT STRIPS OUT A LOT OF THE JUNK UH AS WELL
UH B FINE
THE PR
UH YEAH
IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE S IT SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE QUITE GRABBABLE 'CAUSE IT IS IT'S WRITTEN IN JAVA
WELL I'M I AM
UH MY PAGE IS BLANK STILL
UM THE STRA THE TRAINS WEREN'T STOPPING AT THE STATIONS
UM THE AND THEY'RE BUSSING PEOPLE INTO STATION HAVE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS ON IT 'CAUSE IT'S ON A 'CAUSE IT'S ON A HILL OR SOMETHING
BUT YEAH AT L AT LEAST IT WAS SPEED RESTRICTIONS INSTEAD OF LIKE TRAINS FLYING PAST INTO BARRIERS AND THINGS
OH F YEAH
UM SO SO TH YEAH SO JUST JUST BEEN READING THROUGH DOCUMENTATION
JUST 'CAUSE TO JUST SEE HOW THINGS WORK IN THAT UM AND
IT WELL THING IS THAT THE A. THE A. WELL THE A. P. I. IS STANDARDIZED BY THE W. THREE C.
SO THE A. P. I. IS STAN IS STANDARD BETWEEN EVERYTHING
UM WELL YEAH BUT IF THEY WILL B BUT IT DOE DOES LOOK LIKE IT DOES DOES THAT THIS IS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
SO I WAS DOING THE IS ANYWAY
ADD THINGS TO AND TAKE THINGS AWAY AND DON'T SEE EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE TIME
OH WELL JUST 'CAUSE X. H. T. M. L. HAS A NICE YOU KNOW YOU GOT BROWSERS THERE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE DIRECTLY WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON
JU JU JU JUST BA JUST 'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T UH WE HAVEN'T F HAVEN'T QUITE FINALISED THE UM THE G. D. F. FORMAT
SO JUST JUST WELL JUST
SO ALL HAVE TO DO IS JUST CHANGE IT CHANGE THAT SORT OF THING SO IT'S UH YEAH
UM THAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT I'M DOING THE MOMENT I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE S THE UH STUFF THAT ROBIN PUT ON THE WIKI TO SAY WHAT'S
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE NEED IN THE IN THE T UM IN THE OUTPUT FORMAT FOR THE FOR THE TASK YOU KNOW
UM SO I'M MAKING SURE THAT I CAN TAKE GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OF THE G. D. F. AS IT ST STATE OF THE MOMENT
AND IF I FIND SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT THEN I CAN ADD THAT TO THE ADD THAT TO THE G. D. F. FORMAT
WELL I'M I'M I'M JU TRY I'M MAKING SURE THAT THE G. D. F. FORMAT WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT WILL D WILL OUTPUT SAY WELL I'VE OUTPUT OLD ANALYSIS THAT THAT ROBIN'S LOOKING FOR
UM SO SO I'M USING THAT AS A WAY TO TO GET INTO HA HA USING THE DOM THINGS AS WELL
UH NO
WHICH IS WHAT I'LL M PLAN TO USE THAT AS THE BASIS FOR IT
SO YOU GET SO SO IT KNOWS WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PART OR WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT TARGET AREA OR WHAT OR WHATEVER
UM SO YES AS LONG AS IT GOT THAT IN IT SOMEWHERE
SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PULLING THAT OUT AND PUT THAT INTO THE UM INTO THE G. D. F. STUFF
YEAH UM BU
I UM I THINK THE O THE ONLY THING I'VE GOT LEFT TO DO BEFORE THE EXPERIMENTS CAN BE RUN IS GET S IS GET THE CHECK CAMTASIA WORKS
AH
WELL HE MUST SOME THESE DAYS ANYWAY ISN'T IT
SO WE ALL GOT OFF EASY
AH WELL CA I CAN EASY I CAN EASY GET TO MAPL UH TO MAPLIN I KNOW WHERE IT IS OFF I USED TO LIVE THERE
WELL I SUPPOSE I COULD GI I COULD GIVE YOU A CALL ON THE WAY IN TOMORROW AND IF TH NOT BI IT'S NOT BEEN IN YOUR IN YOUR F UM PIGEON HOLE
I CAN EASY GO OFF THE TRAIN AND EARLY AND JUST PICK 'EM UP FROM THERE
WELL I'LL MAKE SURE I MAKE A I'LL MAKE SURE OF I GOT THE F THE PHONE NUMBER IN MY PHONE SO I CAN CALL THEM
IF HE WANTS TO POP IN FOR FIVE MINUTES THE THE WINDOWS MACHINE IS FREE FOR HIM AT THE MOMENT
YEAH I MEAN I CONSIDERING WE GET AN EMAIL FROM UH THE I THINK IT GOT SENT THROUGH SAYING THAT HE'D UPDATED THE THE WHATEVER IT WAS ON THE WIKI
SO YOU DO HE'D HE'D UPLOADED A NE A NEW ZIP FILE AND OVERWRITTEN THE OLD ONE
IF YOU TH ANYTHING PROB ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT UM THINK THERE'S A WIKI PAGE UP FOR THAT F FOR THAT PIECE OF UH FOR YEAH FOR THAT THING
AND LIKE THESE YEAH I MEAN I'VE USED THE SOFTWARE AND THERE'S NOT THAT HARD I MEAN
UH
SO WELL I CAN'T IMAGINE THE BUILDING THE BUILDING THE MOLD IS GONNA BE THAT HARD
I MEAN I CAN EASILY JUST WELL HOWEVER MANY THOUSANDS ARE ON THAT UH DUTCH WEB SITE YOU FOUND
I MEAN UH SO THE THE MAJOR THING I'VE GOTTA D GOT TO DO IS GET THIS CAMTASIA SORTED OUT
UM P
NO THE THE ANALYSIS I THINK THE ANALYSIS WILL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE
UM BUT ONCE W
UM YEAH SO I STILL GOTTA WORK ON THE GEST ANALYZER AND TURN THAT INTO THE T INTO A G. D. F. OUTPUTTER
UM AND UH OH YEAH AND I'LL I CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE MODEL BUILDER AS WELL
UM 'CAUSE ONE THING I'M THINKING ABOUT IS W WE'RE LOOKING AT THE THE PART BUILDING PA TYPE STUFF
BUT I'LL WANNA HAVE A QUI HAVE A QUICK LOOK AND SEE SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO ADD THIS THINGS TO IT
UM SO IF I IF I CAN USE THE MODEL BUILDER TO AUTOMATICALLY DO THAT THEN THAT WOULD SA THAT WOULD SAVE QUITE A BIT OF WORK AND IT'LL D SAVE A FEW BUGS
YEAH OTHER I SAW SAW SAW SAW SOMETHING ABOUT MAP TASK LIKE LITTLE FURTHER DOWN MY TASK LIST
UM YEAH 'CAUSE THAT'S THE YEAH O OTHER THAN YOU HAVE FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT IS BOTH X. M. L.
I'LL D I'LL HAVE TRY TO FIND I'LL I'LL HAVE PLEN PLENTY OF UH PLENTY OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU ONCE I ONCE I GET TO THE LAST STAGE
WELL THE WE'RE GONNA GET CAMTASIA SORTED OUT THIS WEEK AND THEN IT'S CONCENTRATE ON THE ON THE GEST ANALYZER THE G. D. F. STUFF
ONCE ONCE WE'VE DONE THAT IT'S WHATEVER WHATEVER YOU WHATE WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOU WANT ME DO ONCE I DONE THE ONCE I'VE DONE THE G. D. F. I GUESS
ACTUALLY YEAH THAT REMINDS ME I WO WO I WO I WON'T BE UH ON THURSDAY I'M GONNA BE OVER IN MY INDUCTION DAY
I MEAN IT'S FIFTEEN MINUTES ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TOPICS
SO IT'S JUST IT'S UH IT IS
UH YES IT IS
YEAH I MEAN I CAN REMO
YEAH I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I START BEING A ST WHEN I WAS STA STARTING BEING A STUDENT
I MEAN HA WE HAD THE INDUCTIONS WERE COMPULSORY BECAUSE UM A LOT OF STUDENTS WERE DOING TE WERE DOING TEACHING
'CAUSE YOU WERE THE RESPONSIBLE PERSON IN THE IN THE CLASS ROOM
SO SEE HOW IT GO
SO TO REMIND ME SO TO TO JUST ADD THAT ANALYSIS TO YEAH TO TO IT
SO IT'S I MEAN IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO DO JUST CHE JUST CHECKING THE TIMES TH TIMES OF THE EVENTS
YEAH 'CAUSE I THINK THE ASCII FORMAT AS IT STANDS DOES CONTAIN BLINK INFORMATION UM 'CAUSE UH D D I'M SURE I'M SURE THAT'S APPEARED IN THE IN THE DOCUMENTATION I'VE READ THROUGH
SO MIGHT MIGHT WORTH US US HAVING A LOOK AT THAT AND JUST JUST SEEING WHAT DAT IS WHAT DATA IS ALREADY IN THE ASCII FORMAT AND WHETHER YOU WANT ME TO DO ANY CORRECTION AS PART OF THE ANALYSIS
'CAUSE I THINK I THINK AT THE MOMENT THE G. D. F. FORMAT HAS FIXATIONS IN IT
UM SO SO I GUE I GUESS THAT'D BE PART OF THE G. D. F. TO TRANSFORMATION WOULD BE TURNING FIXATIONS INTO GAZES AND WHATEVER ELSE
WELL THA THA DON'T DON'T UH WORRY ABOUT THAT JUST THE MOMENT
SO SO SO W WILL YOU ACTUALLY BE DOING MUCH OF THE G. D. F.
OR IS ARE YOU EXPECTING DO MOST THE ANALYSIS ON OUT OF THE N. X. T. STUFF THEN
UH YEAH
YOU TOLD THAT EARLIER 'CAUSE YOU COULD DO A QUICK ANA YOU COULD DO A QUICK ANALYSIS ON THE G. D. F. STUFF WITHOUT HAVING TO BEFORE YOU HIT BEFORE YOU DO THE DIALOGUE ANALYSIS TYPE STUFF
FAIR ENOUGH FAIR EN
YEAH I SUPPOSE I CAN EASY LOOK THROUGH AND START WRITING UP SOME DOCUMENTATION ON IT
THAT'LL GI THAT'LL GIVE US A STARTING POINT FOR US TO SORT TO TALK ABOUT IT TO LOOK FOR WHAT ANALYSIS WE N ACTUALLY NEED TO DO ON IT AND THINGS
SO WE'LL ON ONCE YEAH
WELL ONCE I'VE HAD ONCE I'VE HAD A BIT OF BIT MORE LOOK AT THIS G. D. F. STUFF THEN START LOOKING THROUGH THAT
I'VE L YEAH I'VE NO NO NOTICED THAT THE THE THE GEST ANALYSER KNOWS QUITE A FEW THINGS AS WELL
SO UM BUT AS
WELL UH I USE IT THAT USEFUL FOR GENERATING THIS G. D. F. STUFF
I MEAN BUT WHAT YEAH SAY WHAT WHAT I'LL WHAT I'LL PLAN TO DO WITH IT THEN IS TAKE THE IS TAKE TO THE SOFTWARE
AND THEN USE THOSE FUNCTIONS TO GENERATE THE STUFF THAT GOES INTO THE X. M. L. FILE THE THE G. F. FORMAT
WELL SO SO IT'S SO LONG AS IT'S X. M. L. N. X. T. WILL HANDLE IT WON'T IT
AND IT LOOKS LIKE L LOOKS LIKE I'M COMING TO END OF THE STUFF THE STUFF LIST THERE ALREADY
SO I'M GONNA HAVE START LOOKING AT THAT AS THE NEXT STAGE
WELL I MA I MA I MAY BE MAYBE I WANT TO CHECK OUT THESE BATTERIES AND THINGS WON'T I
WELL WELL WILL THE WILL THE WILL WILL DO IF THE TRAINS ARE THA AS BAD AS TODAY
THERE ISN'T TH SO THERE ARE THINGS IN THE EYE TRACKER RECORD THAT WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT IN THE G. D. F. FORMAT UM LIKE THE FRAME RATE EYE MOVEMENT
YOU KNOW WE WE UH UH I WE'RE IF WE'RE EXPECTING THE G. D. F. FORMAT TO BE UM SORT OF A PARSED VERSION OF EVENTS
YEAH WE YEAH YOU CAN GET BACK TO IT
BUT THE TH BUT THE WAY TO THINK OF THIS IS THIS IS THE DATA THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ANALYSE AGAINST THE OTHER TRACKS OF DATA
S SO IN ESSENCE WHAT YOU WOULD THEN DO IS
WELL WE'RE NOT DOING FRAME RATE AT ANY FRAME FOR WELL MAYBE WE ARE
W WHAT W UM THE KINDS OF EVENTS THAT WE HAD R UH BEFORE TALKED ABOUT PUTTING INTO THE RECORD FOR THEN USE IN ELAN AND N. X. T. ISN'T BASED ON SAYING EVERY X. SECONDS SOMETHING
WHATEVER THE FRAME RATE IS YOU KNOW TEN SECONDS A MINUTE
AND UM A PARSED VERSION OF THE DATA WHICH ISN'T AT UM ANY PARTICULAR LENGTH
BUT YOU'LL GET UH WHAT YOU WANT IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE UM THE CONCEPTS BEHIND THAT DATA THAT YOU WANT REPRESENTED
SO RATHER THAN SAYING THE EYE WAS AT THIS PARTICULAR PLACE
WOULD YOU BE SO THE MORE YOU CAN PLAN
SO YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME IT WAS ON DURING THAT FIXATION
OKAY SO THE PERCENTAGE IS I I IS A CUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE USING FOR MEASUREMENT
IT'S A CUT OFF FOR WHETHER OR NOT IT COUNTS AS A FIXATION
IS THAT
WE LOVE THIS THING
SEE IF THE PENS WORK
AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DRAW THIS RIGHT IS THAT THEY YOU KNOW
SO YOU KNOW HE MIGHT GET TRIANGLE ONE THERE AND NO MAYBE THIS ONE'S GONNA OVERLOOK LAP QUITE A BIT
SO YOU COULD DO IT ON 'CAUSE I IT'S JUST A MATTER OF I THE HARD PART IS DECIDING HOW CLOSE TOGETHER THESE HAVE TO BE BEFORE YOU DECIDE THAT THIS IS A EVENT THAT YOU WANNA PULL OUT
AND UH UM YOU KNOW WE WE'VE GOT AN ALGORITHM FOR DECIDING WHEN THAT'S A LOOK I GUESS
YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT OR NO
SO THE HARD THING IS THEY COULD BE MOVING THEIR EYE ARBITRARILY HERE RIGHT
BUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS WE WE CAN ALREADY BUILD INTO THIS G. D. F. FORMAT THESE REGIONS IF YOU CAN GIVE A DEFINITION OF WHAT YOU THINK THAT IS
BUT I THINK THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS IS TO BE ABLE TO INSPECT THE DATA IN UM SOME TOOL AND PLAY AROUND WITH THE DEFINITIONS
Y YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF THIS
YOU KNOW ADD THIS DATA A AUTOMATICALLY
IT'S JUST THERE'LL BE A BUNCH OF THESE
AH RIGHT
SO IF THEY IF THEY UH THEY HAD A FIXATION ON C. YOU WOULDN'T BE WORRIED
IT NO NO
THE SO EVERY SEPARATE
BUT WHAT WE FIND E WHAT WE CAN GET OUT OF THE DATA EASILY AT THE MOMENT IS AT THIS KIND OF LEVEL RIGHT
SO THIS IS ONE UH WE HADN'T THOUGHT OF ADDING BEFORE BUT WE SHOULD RIGHT
WHICH IS UM WELL HOW WOULD YOU DECIDE WHETHER SOMETHING WAS THE CURRENT ADDENDUM UH THE CU
BUT I MEAN WITH TRANSACTION CODING ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU WOULD USE I Y YOU WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT VERBAL ANALYSIS EXACTLY
I I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALISTIC BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'D ACTUALLY DO IS USE UM THE FULL RECORD OF WHAT YOU HAVE AND DO A SEGMENTATION
I THINK IT'D BE HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IF YOU USED LIKE JUST THE LANGUAGE WITHOUT WATCHING THE VIDEO TO DECIDE WHETHER WE'RE BREAKING DOWN THE TASK
OH YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE CODING TH UH BASED ON THAT THOUGH AND THEN THAT SEEMS A STRANGE WAY TO GO ABOUT THINGS
WHA WHY DO YOU CARE WHETHER THEY CAN DO IT JUST BASED ON THE THE LANGUAGE
IS
IT'S MORE G I CAN'T QUITE SEE WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO IT JUST BASED ON THE LANGUAGE WHEN W YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAD BOTH
WELL I THINK THAT ONE'S JUST BOUND TO FAIL
W THE RECORD THAT WE ARE GETTING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IS ABOUT THE M ABOUT THESE YOU KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT SOME REGION OF THE SCREEN DEFINED DYNAMICALLY
THEY'RE THEY'RE JOINTLY FOCUSED ON THIS REGION AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT S PERCENTAGE OF TIME THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT AS ADDING NEW TIERS OF INFORMATION TO EITHER THE ELAN TRACK OR N. X. T.
THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH SORT OF TRACK BASED IN THIS WAY
AND THEN WE'VE GOT NO OPTION BUT TO UH FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS JUST EXPLORE THIS DATA
SUGGEST WAYS ABOUT DOING IT AND UM BE ABLE TO PLAY THEM BACK AND SEE UM WHEN WE THINK WE'VE GOT THESE THINGS RIGHT
SO TH
W RIGHT
YOU KNOW THIS THING IN ITSELF IS TH BUNCH OF FIXATIONS RIGHT WITH SACCADES
SO Y IT'S POSSIBLE
'CAUSE I YOU'RE NOT GONNA G HAVE THE SAME PIXEL
IF YOU WANT THE SMALLER IF YOU WANT THE SMALLER CODING IN IN HERE
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE RAW FIXATION UM DATA
WE CAN PUT THAT IN AS ANOTHER TRACK
IF YOU THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT IN ONE OF THESE TOOLS THAT SHOWS YOU THE TRACKS AGAINST EACH OTHER
YEAH I D THAT'S ALL HE ASKED FOR
YEAH AND IN N. X. T. THERE'S NO COST RIGHT BECAUSE THE Y THE UH YOU JUST DON'T CHOOSE TO LOAD THOSE
ALL WE'RE DOING IS DUMPING IT AS OUTPUT THAT YOU CAN LOAD IF YOU CHOOSE TO
UM I G S YOU KNOW SO IF THEY'RE THINGS THAT YOU JUST KNOW ARE CRAZY AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT THEN WE DON'T DO IT
SO IT'S THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS THE DID YOU WANT THE YOU
M NOT E WELL IF IT'S EACH YOU HAVE TO D YOU HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO ANOTHER TIER RIGHT
IS THAT I MEAN WHICH WAY DO YOU WANT TO
AND UH Y DID YOU WANT THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME FIXATED AS OPPOSED TO WHICH IS SORT OF ANOTHER VIEW OF THIS NUMBER
YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY OF THESE AS
WELL IT'S NOT UM THE THE EXTRA COST OF HAVING THESE AS ATTRIBUTES IS NOT HIGH
WELL WELL BUT Y THOSE ARE DIFFERENT TRACKS OF INFORMATION
SO WHAT YOU WANT IS ONE TRACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH OBJECT IT'S ONE ONE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ON THE OTHER GUY'S GAZE
AND ONE ABOUT WHETHER IT'S ON UM ONE OF THE MOUSE POSITIONS
YEAH BUT I IN IN THE ANALYSIS YOU SHOULD TREAT THOSE AS COMPLETELY SEPARATE TRACKS OF INFORMATION
SO THE THESE ARE INDEPENDENT
SO SO WHAT WE WANT IS WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT S AT THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE RIGHT
AND THEN THERE IS A. 'S MOUSE NOT THEIR EYES IS ON AN OBJECT RIGHT
YOU KNOW IT'S ON THIS OBJECT
AND THEN UM A. 'S EYE IS ON WELL A. 'S MOUSE I GUESS RIGHT
I GUESSING FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT ALL THESE TRACKS
S SO UM UH YOU KINDA GOT THE IDEA HERE
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU DON'T TREAT THAT ENTIRE SET AS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE
IT'S JUST SO THA THE OBJECTS IS LIKE A SEPARATE LEVEL OF ANALYSIS
IF WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE OBJECTS THAN WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE GAZE
OKAY THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR THE DATA MODELS AND EITHER OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE USING
SEE UH I I'M THE ONE THAT USES THE WHITE BOARD
SO YOU JUST MEAN WHICH I IS IT CLOSER TO THE IS THE CIRCLE I MEAN WHAT IS THIS CIRCLE
S RIGHT
OH SO THOSE VARY IN SIZE
OH BUT WHAT PAIN THAT'S GONNA BE ANALYTICALLY
I THINK FOR NOW WE WE DO IT THIS WAY AND THEN WE WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED OUT OF IT IN THE END
IT'S JUST YOU KNOW IN ELAN IT THAT HAS THE SIDE EFFECT THAT IF YOU GO FOR THE NATURALISTIC WAY OF OF UP TRANSLATING TO ELAN
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT ONE OBJECT ONE LANDMARK AND THEN ANOTHER LANDMARK
YEAH AND WE B WE BETTER ALSO LIKE HAVE IN THE REPRESENTATIONAL LIST OF PAR LIKE EVEN IN THE N. X. T. UP TRANSLATION A LIST OF PARTS
IT'S THERE IS NO THE CONSTRUCT RIGHT
OH AND THIS IS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT IT TO STAY TRIANGLE ONE WHEN YOU START WITH A CONSTRUCT IT'S NOT A CONSTRUCT AT ALL
OH SO THERE'S NO TWO PARTS WITH THE SAME SHAPE
OH SAME SHAPE AND COLOUR
BUT THE THIS ALSO
WE IN WHEN YOU SPECIFY THESE THINGS DO YOU SPECIFY THE MOLDS OR DOES IT FIGURE OUT WHAT THE MOLDS ARE BASED ON
SO IS THIS HARD WIRED INTO TIM'S PROGRAM
OR IS IT JUST AN ARTIFACT OF THE WAY WE S
UH BUT WHAT WERE THE REQ WHA
BECAUSE YOU WERE AIMING AT SOMETHING IN UM THE G. D. F. FORMAT AND I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT
AND W
YOU KNOW EVERY BLACK TRIANGLE HAS A DIFFERENT I. D.
I THINK THAT THIS IS A HUMAN CODING THAT IS PART OF THE ACTION CODING
OH BUT THEY HAVE TO DRAG IT UP PAST THE MOLD LINE
YEAH BUT THERE'S THERE'D BE NO WAY OF CODING THAT AUTOMATICALLY RIGHT
SO W
REMEMBER M ALL THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE F WITH LANGUAGE WITH AND WITHOUT LANGUAGE
BUT TH UM THIS IS PROPERLY PART OF THE ACTION CODING
IS THERE A Y YEAH
WHICH IS THE YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS HE HOLDING YOU UP FROM
OH DO YOU NEED TWO COPIES OF CAMTASIA TO DO THAT
WELL Y C LOOK AT THE LICENCE CONDITIONS IT MIGHT NOT
BECAUSE W UM IT MEANS WE'VE GOT WELL NO THIS IS THREE TIMES RIGHT 'CAUSE WE'VE GOT OH NO
SO UH IS THAT A PROBLEM
OH WE CAN WE CAN PUT 'EM IN THE SAME THING RIGHT
SO YOU SO YOU SHOULD START THE CAMTASIA REALLY EARLY THEN
SO UH HA WOU IS THERE ANY SOUND DEGRADATION THAT COMES ABOUT FROM PUTTING THIS THROUGH CAMTASIA RATHER THAN RUNNING IT OUT STRAIGHT
SO WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING ON DOING IT IS BUNGING IT ON ONE OF THE CAMTASIA TRACKS AND THEN SPLICING IT OFF THE CAMTASIA TRACK
IT'S AN EASY BIT OF YEAH
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA BUNG IT ON THE OTHER CAMTASIA TRACK TOO IF YOU NEED IT RIGHT
AND THE SOUND IS GOING TO START AT THE SAME TIME AS ONE OF THAT ARBITRARY ONE OF THE CAMTASIA VIDEOS
UM THE AUDIO UH W THE TIME STAMPS USED THERE WOULD BE JOINT TIME STAMPS BETWEEN THE AUDIO AND THE EYE TRACKER SO THAT YOU KNOW
UH THE AUDIO RECORD TEN SECONDS IN WAS THE SAME AS TEN SECONDS INTO THE EYE TRACKER RECORD SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY EXTRA HAND WORK
YOU KNOW ANY UH CHOPPING THE STARTS OF AUDIO SIGNALS TO GET THERE WAS NOTHING OKAY
SO WE'RE RELYING ON YOUR MATLAB SCRIPT TO GET US THE CHOPPED VERSION OF THE AUDIO RIGHT
RIGHT SO WE CAN EITHER ADJUST THE EYE TRAI TRACK DATA OR WE CAN ACTUALLY CHOP THE AUDIO SIGNAL TO TAKE OFF THE FIRST WHATEVER HOWEVER MANY SECONDS
BUT UH BUT D UM THE UH LINING UP THE CAMTASIA TWO IS GONNA TAKE WE W HE'S WORKING ON A MATLAB SCRIPT FOR THE SOUND BUT NOT FOR SO THE ONE THAT'S GOT THE SOUND ON IT
THAT'LL ALSO TELL YOU WHERE TO CHOP THE VIDEO TO GET IT TO LINE UP
THE ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE SOUND ON IT IT WON'T
SO IT'S JUST GOT THE BLEEPS
OH OKAY SO W NO HAND SYNCHRONIZATION REQUIRED AT ALL
SO WE JUST HAVE TO W HOPE WE DON'T HAVE AN ANY SUBJECTS WITH THE ODD VOCALIZATIONS
'CAUSE THIS THIS IS THE DROP OUT TEST
I KNOW BUT SO YOU G YOU GOT A SOLUTION FOR THAT THEN
UH WELL IT'S THE MONO
WAIT WAIT W I I THOUGHT THE SOL THAT A BETTER SOLUTION WAS FIXING THIS PROBLEM WITH THE MONO MICROPHONE SOCKET
SO YOU SAID THE PROBLEM WAS THE M IT THE M M I IS EXPECTING A MONO MICROPHONE INPUT
SO IS THAT FIXABLE
UH I THINK A NEW SOUND CARD SOUNDS A BETTER SOLUTION THAN MONKEYING ABOUT WITH TRYING TO FILTER WHITE NOISE OUT
BUT HI BUT IT'S ONLY GOT ONE INPUT RIGHT
SO IS THERE ANY REASON WHY WE WOU DON'T DO THAT
I SO I THINK
TO YEAH YEAH
'CAUSE UM THAT'S QUITE A BIT CLEARER IN MY HEAD AT LEAST AND BUT I THINK MOSTLY WE LEAVE YOU TO GO AWAY AND RE DESIGN THE G. D. F. OR ADD NEW BITS TO THE G. D. F. ALONG THESE LINES
AND THEN W
BUT I THINK THE THING TO DO IS UM FOR YOU TO GO AWAY AND THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY WITH THE DIFFERENT TRACKS FOR THE DIFFERENT OBJECTS AND THE UM THE KINDS OF THINGS WE'VE ADDED ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE AND WHAT HAVE YOU
AND AND TRY TO CHANGE THE SPEC SO IT IT REFLECTS THIS AND MAYBE UM OH MAYBE BY THAT POINT THERE WILL BE SOME SAMPLE DATA OR SOMETHING UH AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS FOR US TO LOOK AT THE SP THE SPEC THE WAY YOU UNDERSTAND IT NOW AND SOME DATA
AND THEN ELLEN'LL HAVE NEW IDEAS ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED OR ABOUT THESE POST ANALYSES YOU KNOW THE AND THEN AND WE CAN ADD 'EM IN
OH SO THE SPEC TO THE OTHER CONVERSATION YEAH
WELL I BUT HE WASN'T GONNA BE BOOKING ANY TIME TO US AFTER THE THIRTY FIRST OF OCTOBER
YOU DON'T KNOW HAVE ANY CHANGE ON THAT RIGHT
'CAUSE HE THAT'S WHAT HE SAID TO US ORIGINALLY
SO I WOULD ASSUME YOU KNOW NO MORE CONTACT WITH JOE
IT'S NOT FAIR TO GET WORK OUT OF SOMEBODY FOR FREE
WELL W HE WASN'T PAID IN ADVANCE
I IF HE CAN GIVE IT YOU KNOW LIKE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS YOU GOTTA HAVE AN IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU DISCOVER A BUG IN THAT
BECAUSE W WE ONLY NEED THIS TO WORK WELL ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN USE IT FOR SOMETHING AND YOU GOT WORK RATS
AND YOU GOT
SO YOU CAN DASH IN THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR AT A TIME
YOU GUYS SORT IT OUT
RIGHT BUT IT WOULD BE KIND TO TELL HER AHEAD OF TIME WHICH OF YOUR MORNING SESSIONS YOU'RE BUMPED
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE PROBLEM THAT YOUR MORNINGS WEREN'T SLICED OFF ON THE BOOKING SYSTEM
'CAUSE YOU KNOW I IF YOU'RE SA TOLD USE THE BOOKING SYSTEM
AND WHAT ARE THE INSTR WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS HAVE UM I YOU KNOW AS RULES ABOUT WHO YOU HAND THE KEYS TO
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WE LIKE PEOPLE TO KNOW TO GROUND THE OH I THOUGHT THE THE LENDING FOR THE BOOKING SYSTEM CAROLINE
SEE 'CAUSE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO UH HAVE TRAINING IN
YOU GOT UH WILLING HEADS
OH I DON'T THINK I BROUGHT MY DIARY UP
YOU ALL HAVE TO B YOU'LL HAVE TO BE THERE TO WHEN IT FALLS OVER
SO THAT ALL SOUNDS F GOOD FUN
WE'RE NOT TH ACTUALLY THROWING ANYTHING AWAY
AS LONG AS THE FORMAT IN WHICH WE PICK IT UP IS A FORMAT WHICH COULD BE GENERALISED TO A FINER TAKE
BECAUSE THE WORST THING THAT CAN EVER HAPPEN TO YOU IS YOU DISCOVER THAT YOU'VE DONE HUGE AMOUNTS OF ANALYSIS AND TH YOU ACTUALLY HAD THE DATA BUT YOU THREW IT AWAY BECAUSE YOU TREATED IT SO GROSSLY
SO WHATEVER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO B YOU KNOW BACKTRACK AND SAY OKAY INSTEAD OF EVERY SECOND EVERY TENTH OF A SECOND OR SOME SUCH THING
BUT YOU KNOW TH
SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE SHU HAVE TO SHOW AT SOME TIME SLICE RATE WHETHER THE EYE WAS ON THE SAME TARGET AS THE OTHER GUY
SO WE HAVE TO B WE HAVE ALL THE PARTS THE INTERESTING PARTS OF THE SCREEN IDENTIFIED AND BE ABLE TO SHOW DISTRIBUTION OF GAZE OVER TIME
BUT BUT MY POINT IS THAT WE MUSTN'T THROW AWAY IN OR LOSE THE CAPACITY OF BEING ABLE TO DELIVER THAT KIND OF DATA
S SO TYPICALLY THE EYE WILL MOVE RIGHT
AND YOU AND SO WHEN YOU SAY THE EYE WAS ON THIS FROM HERE TO HERE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS THAT IS THAT IF YOU USE THE REAL FRAME RATE
IT'S GONNA BE ON THIS LANDMARK
UH IT'S ON THIS OBJECT THAT OBJECT THIS FIXED THING THAT FIXED THING OKAY
I S YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE PERSON WALKING
BUT THE OTHER IS THAT THERE WILL BE A TIME SPAN A KIND OF REACTION TO SOME EVENT SPAN
AND ONE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SEQUENCES OF THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT THE SAME THING AND THEN THEY BROKE IT
OR THEY DID LOOK AT THE SAME THING AND THEN THEY DID OR DIDN'T BREA YOU KNOW
ONE ONE COULD IMAGINE THOSE TWO CATEGORIES
BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UM DUES YOU PAY TO THE WAY THEY DO THINGS IN THE LITERATURE TO GET YOUR PAPERS PUBLISHED
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WILL WANT TO KNOW IS AN EVENT SERIES AFTER SOME CRITICAL EVENT RIGHT
SO THEY'LL BE THEY THEY'LL WANT TO SEE ESSENTIALLY THE GAZE SETTLING ON PARTICULAR INCIDENTS ON PARTICULAR PLACES
THERE IS SOME PART THERE ARE THERE ARE SEPARATE MOVABLE PARTS ON THE SCREEN READY FOR USE RIGHT
NOW IN NEITHER CASE WHEN YOU DRAW THIS HE'S LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE WHICH YOU'RE ACTUALLY DRAWING YOU KNOW
BUT EVEN SO YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET BOUNCING IN AND OUT OF THE REGION RIGHT
TEMPORARILY SIMPLIFY TOO MUCH SO THAT YEAH
'CAUSE THEN YOU LOSE PERCENTAGE AS AN AS A AS A D. V.
YES BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE FOR PART OF THAT TIME BOTH B. AND A. ARE PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT OKAY
AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO FIGURE THAT OUT
SO SO ESSENTIALLY THERE'S THERE'S UM A. E. IS DIVIDED INTO T. R. ONE AND C. AND OTHER STUFF OKAY WHERE C. IS THE CONSTRUCT THE EXISTING THING
I MEAN WE'D TAKE A SEPARATE WE'D LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE TIME I MEAN I HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE LOOK WHEN THEY'RE BUILDING THINGS TOGETHER
SO THERE'S A THERE'S THE ADDENDUM AND THE AND THE CO THE EXISTING CONSTRUCT
BUT IF THEY'RE WHATEVER IT IS THAT ONE IS LOOKING AT IF THE OTHER'S LOOKING THE SAME PLACE THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE
AND THAT'S WHAT THE OTHER STUFF THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT THE DIAGONAL STRIPES ARE FOR
SO SO YOU CAN DEFINE IF ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY CATEGORISED BY THE EYE TRACKER AS TO WHERE THE EYE IS ALRIGHT
THAT THAT'S WHAT HE WAS RE WHAT HE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN WAS THE KIND OF CODING WHICH WOULD DEFINE THE BUILDING SEQUENCE OKAY
HE'S HE'S ACTUALLY UM EMAILED ME WITH A L WITH A LIST OF THINGS HE WANTS TO DISCUSS AT LENGTH
SO I W I'LL BRING THIS ONE BACK TO HIM
IS HE GONNA DEFINE THIS KIND OF BUILDING SEQUENCE IN A WAY THAT WE CAN GET OUT
OR IS HE SO B I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON CONSTRUCTION THERE FOR A WHILE
SO IT MAY BE THAT THEY HAVE A CODING SYSTEM THAT'S READY TO GO AND WE SHOULD JUST APPLY IT
SO THEY MAY WELL HAVE A YEAH
WHAT WELL WE BUT WE HAVE THE NOW ACTIONS I MEAN ACTIONS MIGHT MOSTLY BE THEIRS RIGHT
BUT UM PRESUMABLY WHAT YOU PIOUSLY HOPE IS HAPPENS HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH UM TRANSACTIONS
AS AN AS AN OUTCOME OF THIS IS THAT YOU COULD ANALYSE EITHER END AND YOU'D GET THE SAME CHUNKING OF THE MATERIAL
THE THING WHICH YOU GUYS THOUGHT TO MAKE IN A PAPER
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ONE COULD IMAGINE DOING IS UM SEN IS YOU KNOW
AND IF THE DISCOURSE TELLS YOU WHAT'S GOING ON THAT'S INFORMATION
I MEAN I G ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS HOW THE INFORMATION IS GONNA BE SHARED ACROSS THESE MEDIA
AND IF YOU CAN GET IT ALL OUT OF THE SPEECH YOU KNOW IF THE IF ALL OF THE CHUNKING IS AVAILABLE WHEN THERE IS SPEECH
BECAUSE J. P. 'S QUESTION THE OVERRIDING QUESTION IS SO WHAT'S LANGUAGE FOR
AND WE WON'T AND ESTABLISHING THE FULL SET WILL YOU KNOW TAKE US MUCH OF THE PROJECT
MY ONLY CONCERN W UH YOU A AS I SAID WHEN I BARGED IN WAS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T LOSE THE THINGS THAT WE MIGHT NEED TO PICK UP LATER
BUT SINCE THE L THE DEFINITIONS OF LOOK A THING WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE D UM ARE THE ONES WHICH GET RID OF THE LOWER LEVEL
S
WELL THE IN THAT INTERPRETATION IS DEFINABLE TO FRAME RATE BY OUR BY THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA USE FRAME RATE
AND OKAY I'M I'M ASKING YOU AS AN EXPERT
ON IT
SO YOU THINK THAT IF FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT UM ONE OR ANOTHER UM APEX OF A TRIANGLE IT WOULD JUST THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE
THEY WERE EXPLORING THE THING AS OPPOSED TO THEY WERE SIMPLY ALRIGHT THERE IS IT THERE IT IS
OKAY SO TH UM SO THAT REALLY MEANS THAT WE'RE NOT THROWING AWAY ABSOLUTE FIXATIONS
AS OPPOSED TO OUT OF IT
SO YOU SO I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD YOU TO MEAN EXPLORING THE FIGURE
DURATION OF EACH FIXATION IN THE REGION
SO TO WHAT DEGREE DO WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHETHER THE TWO LITTLE EYES LITTLE CIRCLES ARE EXACTLY IN THE SAME PLACE OR JUST SOMEWHERE IN THE SAME REGION
OR IS IT ONLY THE THE PIECE THAT THE EYE TRA THE OTHER PERSON'S EYE TRACK IS ON THAT'S THAT'S AN OBJECT IN THIS DEFINITION
IS A IS AN OBJECT
WITH SOME WITH PLUS OR MINUS SOMETHING OR OTHER YEAH AROUND IT
UM SO YOU CAN BE ON THE OBJECT BUT NOT ON THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE
BUT IT'S DIRECTLY ADDED WHEN WHEN THESE TWO IN THIS SITUATION WHEN THESE TWO OVERLAP RIGHT LIKE THIS
SO IF YOU Y YOU'RE GONNA HAVE DYNAMIC REGIONS WHICH OVERLAP ONE ANOTHER BY DEFINITION
IF THE MOUSE IS ON THE CONSTRUCT THEN RIGHT RIGHT
BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND THE THE PARTS OF THE C THING TO BE CONSTRUCTED IS THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO OVERLAP WITH OTHER THINGS SO NOTHING BREAKS
YE
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW THOSE THINGS
SO A DEFINITION OF WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT AND TOUCHING THE SAME THING
SO AT THAT POINT YOU SHOULD HAVE A LINE UP OF A. IS ON THE CONSTRUCT A. IS ON THE MOUSE
A. IS ON A. IS ON A. 'S MOUSE A. IS ON B. 'S MOUSE A. IS ON B. 'S GAZE AND B. LIKEWISE
OOH I LOVE THE ERASER
BECAUSE THA SOME MEASURE OF ALIGNMENT IS LOOKING WHERE THE OTHER GUY IS DIRECTING ATTENTION
IN THE IN THE SUPPLIES SET THEY'RE ACTUALLY NEATLY PACKED INTO A LITTLE SPACE
BECAUSE THE TWO ARE SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THEIR REGIONS OVERLAP
HO HO
D OR DECIDING WHICH ONE TO CHOOSE OR THINKING SO YOU DON'T WANT TO DECIDE IT'S ONLY ONE AND THROW THE OTHER ONE OUT
WELL NOT IF THE REGIONS OVERLAP OKAY
IF THE REGIONS I
S A THING
DO YOU STILL IDENTIFY IT AS A PART
I MEAN I THINK ONE SHOULD LOSE THAT I TAKE IT
SO ACTUALLY DEFINING ALL OF THOSE AS THE CONSTRUCT IS GONNA BE THE TRICKIEST THING
SO DO WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UM WE BROKE IT AND IT WENT AWAY AND UM IT'S NOW PART OF THE CONSTRUCT
CAN WE TA CAN WE TAG THE CONSTRUCTS WITH WHAT'S IN THEM
SO SOME FANCY PROGRAMMING'S GONNA HAVE TO BE DONE TO SAY I WAS LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE AND NOW I'M LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE IN CONSTRUCT ONE
SO L LET'S IMAGINE THIS WE'VE MADE A CONSTRUCT OF TWO PARTS AND WE'RE C I A TRIANGLE AND A SQUARE
OKAY BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THE EXAMPLE M F PRESUMABLY THAT'S THE BEST EXAMPLE OF OVERLAPPING OVERLAPPING AREAS
'CAUSE IF IF THE THING THE TWO S THE TWO THINGS ARE NOW ABUTTED
SUPPOSE WE PICK UP AN WE WE WE SCREWED UP THE FIRST TIME WE PUT THE TRIANGLE WITH THE SQUARE AND WE THREW IT AWAY AND DECIDED WE DIDN'T LIKE IT
AND WE TOOK ANOTHER ONE
IS IT TRIANGLE ONE
IS IT TRIANGLE ONE PRIME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
N N
BUT IF I HAVE TRIANGLES ONE TWO THREE RIGHT AND I THROW THEM AWAY ANY TRIANGLES I TAKE OUT ARE TO REPLACE ONE TWO THREE
OH IS THAT TRUE
ONE TWO AND THREE
WHICH KIND OF LEAVES YOU WITH AN OBVIOUS WAY OF MAKING THE SAME TASK HARDER AND EASIER DOESN'T IT
IT'S THE FIGURING OUT STUFF THAT GETS HARDER IF EVERYTHING IS PURPLE
OR ONE
AS LONG AS IT THIS IS POSSIBLE
SO C THAT THAT JUST IS A KIND OF THING WHICH IS SO SIMPLE
SO MUCH LIKE A SINGLE ONE ZERO VARIABLE CHANGE THAT IT IF IT THAT DOESN'T ALREADY EXIST
THE THE V THE NUTS ARE ARE RED OR AND ALL THE UM FLAT THINGS ARE WOOD COLOUR SOMETHING
AND I THINK THAT'S HOW THE ROBOT IS SET UP TO THERE ARE FIVE FIVE GREEN BOLTS
UH HERE IS ONE YOU KNOW
SO W UH ALL I'M I'M DOING IS KIND OF WORRYING OUT LOUD ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN THAT WE'LL MISS BY TH A SIMPLE VIEW OF FOR EXAMPLE REGIONS AND LOOKING AT AT TRIANGLE ONE
UM DOES IT S KEEP ITS IDENTITY
AND I WANTED TO UM TO LOOK AT THE STRATEGY
AND I WANTED TO SEE IF THE STRATEGY WAS DIFFERENT WHEN WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT AND WHEN WE JUST PICKED UP WHATEVER
THERE IT'S GONNA BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY THAT TO YOU
AND THE DIFFERENCE IN THE HISTORY OF CONSTRUCTION RIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT THING AND I WONDER HOW WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION BACK
SO YOU HAVE THE N THE NAMES OF THE THINGS IN THERE
SO CONSTRUCT TWO COULD B UM CONSTRUCT ONE IS UM A RED TRIANGLE AND A GREEN SQUARE
CONSTRUCT TWO IS UM TWO GREEN SQUARES OKAY
CONSTRUCT THREE RIGHT IS A RED TRIANGLE A GREEN SQUARE AND ANOTHER RED TRIANGLE
AND YOU CAN SO HOW ARE WE GONNA TELL WHEN FOR EXAMPLE YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO HUMAN CODING ON WHEN TWO SUB CONSTRUCTS ARE PUT TOGETHER
SO WE COULD ZIP WE COULD ZIP THROUGH THIS AND LOOK AT ALL THE UM ALL THE INTERACTIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE BUILD SUB CONSTRUCT CONTSTRUCTS FIRST WHICH WE EXPECT THEM TO DO BU AS A WILD HYPOTHESIS MORE WHEN THEY HAVE VERBAL COMMUNICATION THAN WHEN THEY DON'T
YEAH WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY MADE A RULE THAT YOU CAN'T UH COLLECT EXTRA PARTS RIGHT
I MEAN YOU HAVE TO B YOU HAVE TO BREAK ONE TO GET ONE OKAY
THERE THERE'S A SO YOU SO SO YOU APPRECIATE YOU APPRECIATE THE COST OF
IS THERE A WAY OF
SUPPOSE THEY START OFF WITH LANGUAGE AND THEN THEY THEY SAY HEY LOOK YOU KNOW LET'S DO IT LIKE THIS
FOR SURE YOU KNOW THAT'S AND L OR WELL N IS NOT NECESSARILY INTENTIONAL
OR I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY GOOD NO WE'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THAT WE'LL GET A BAD SCORE
LET'S JUST THROW THAT AWAY AND START AGAIN YEAH
THEY DON'T SEE THEIR OWN GAZE
THEY SEE THE O ONLY THE OTHER GUY'S GAZE RIGHT
CHECK OUT
IS THERE MM
IS THERE SUCH A THING UM AS UM YOU KNOW DUAL TRACK VIDEO
THE THING THAT YOU'RE DUMPING THEM ONTO JUST STARTS RUNNING WITH THE FLASH AND THE BLEEP
BUT THEY'RE STILL NO
IS THE WHAT WHAT I TH WHAT ARE THEY I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE THE PARTS THAT ARE OPERATING HERE
THERE IS NO TIME STAMP THAT COMES FROM SOME COMMON SOURCE
RIGHT IS THERE A DIV MM
BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU WANNA GO BACK AND FIND OUT IF THIS WAS JUST A PARTICULARLY DUFF SUBJECT
I MEAN THAT NI
ON W ON WHAT
UH SORRY
UH
ON ONE OF THE
CON
ON CAMTASIA
SO WE THERE'S GONNA BE A WAY TO SOONER OR LATER TO ALIGN THE EYE TRACK CAMTASIA ONE CAMTASIA TWO WITH TWO SOUND CHANNELS
AH THE BLEEP WE'LL FIND
YEAH IS THERE AN END SIGNAL
SO WHEN YOU'VE WHEN YOU'VE PRESSED WE'RE FINISHED IT PINGS BACK AT YOU
CAN W
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THIS
THAT THE LINE IS STEREO THE INPUT IS MONO
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID
IS AH
I WANNA SEE I WANNA SEE ONE OF THEM UM LOOK REALLY NICE BEFORE WE START RUNNING SUBJECTS
I JUST WANNA KNOW IT WORKS THE WAY YOU EXPECT IT TO WORK
THIS IS JUST EXPERIENCE THAT UM IF ANYTHING CAN SCREW UP IT WILL
IT'S PROBABLY WORTH MENTIONING THIS TO THE TO THE GUYS IN THE GARAGE IN TORONTO RIGHT
I THINK THAT'S A IF THE DOCUMENTATION SAID IT W COULD RECORD IN STEREO THEN I THINK WE SHOULD TALK TO THEM ABOUT HOW THEY'VE DONE THIS
IS YOU'RE NOT SURE FROM THE DOCUMENTATION WHAT IT SAYS IT CAN DO
WE CAN USE ANY OF THEM AS THE BEGINNING OF ANY OF THEM AS A START POINT FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT
I I'D BEFORE WE BREAK UP FOR LUNCH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THA THAT I KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GONNA BE BEFORE WE'RE IN RUN MODE OKAY
YEAH THEY HAD THEIR
AH
S
WOULD THAT BE A JUST BETTER USE OF OUR TIME IN GET
BUT M HE HE HE IS AROUND AND I BELIEVE
AND IF IF THE IF I IF IT'S A
JOE COULD GIVE IT A COUPLE OF HOURS WHICH I IS WHAT IT MIGHT TAKE JUST TO FIX IT
THEN LET'S DO IT BECAUSE STARTING RUN TIME IS NOW GETTING TO BE FAIRLY URGENT
OKAY HE WANTED TO KN UM
SO WHAT DO WE THINK IF YOU HAVE A FAIRLY HECTIC WEEK ARE WE LOOKING FOR SUBJECTS NEXT WEEK
YEAH I DO
I DO
WE WANT PEOPLE FOR N FOR NEXT WEEK
IS THAT OKAY
IS ANYBODY NOW TERRIFIED AT THE THOUGHT THAT WE'RE LIVE NEXT WEEK
THERE ARE PEOPLE COMING IN HERE ONE AFTER ANOTHER
OKAY IS THE IS THIS IS THIS GENERALISED IS THIS GENERALISED ANXIETY ROBIN
SO WE W WE WANNA DO SOME PILOTING AT THE END OF THE WEEK
S
WE OWN IT
ALRIGHT MAYBE W SHOULD GET ON THERE AND BOOK MORNINGS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE
OH I SEE
BUT NO THEY NEED A THEY NEED AN ACCOUNT ON THIS MACHINE TO ACTUALLY TO USE IT
RIGHT WHICH WHICH WE THINK IS WHAT'S CRITICAL
WE HAVE TO TRY THE MACHI TH THINGS
I GET A EMAIL BACK
FIRST PILOT SUBJECTS THE ONES WHO UM KNOW WHICH QUESTIONS WE WANNA ASK
UH FIVE HUNDRED HERTZ THOUGH
UH M M I UH I YEAH BUT THE P SORT OF START AND END TIMES WILL GIVE YOU BACK TO THAT OUTPUT
B UH UH M YEAH SO I'LL I'LL LAG IN SOME OF IT DURING THE I SUPPOSE THERE'S THE THE SACCADIC MOVEMENT ITSELF FOR EXAMPLE
THE IT SHOULD STILL COME OUT THAT THE LITTLE SKETCH I ASKED THIS P FOR FOR LAST WEEK ABOUT N. X. T. AND WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE THAT SORT OF TIERED EFFECT SO YOU COULD SEE THE OVERLAP OF WHERE ONE PERSON IS LOOKING COMPARED TO THE OTHER AND THEIR MOUSE MOVEMENTS AND THINGS
THAT THAT SHOULD RA UH ADDRESS ALL THAT
BUT BUT BECAUSE IT'S ALSO IN THE I BASED ON THE THE TIME COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BASICALLY GET THE SCAN PATH OF THE PATTERN OF EVENTS FROM THAT AS WELL
I DIDN'T HAVE IT R UH HAVEN'T BROUGHT IT
UH IT M IT M UH BUT UH BR AT THAT POINT THEY'RE ALL OF IT LUMPED ALL THE INDIVIDUAL FIXATIONS AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T MOVE OFF THAT TRIANGLE TOGETHER AS A TOTAL SORT OF GAZE GAZE TIME ON THAT
UH M
M YES SOMEWHERE
M M YEAH
UH WELL IF IT'S JUST BASED ON UH LIKE A A STABLE FIXATION FOR SO LONG OR OR SOMETHING AND CROSSING INTO THAT REGION
TO MM-HMM
BUT W UH MM-HMM MM-HMM
UH BUT Y Y Y
YOU MEAN TO THE TAGS OF THE DATA W WITHIN IT
BI UM YEAH WITH SOME SOME MEASURE OF THE SO WE COULD WORK OUT THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS THAT MADE AND THE AVERAGE FIXATION DURATION AS WELL
UM IF IF THEY'RE HOLDING THEIR IF THERE'S LESS DANCING AROUND THE UM THE COGNITIVE FOCUS TENDS TO BE IN ONE SORT OF PART
UH YEAH
UH NO I WOULDN'T WANT TO THROW OUT
UH IF WELL YES BUT THAT PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY TO GET OUT BECAUSE YOU'D THEN HAVE TO BREAK UP UH THE PARTS SOMEHOW
UH IT IT YES IT CAN DO BUT IT'S ALSO LOOKING AT IT WITHIN THEIR THEIR OWN BEHAVIOUR TO SEE YEAH
UH TH W I I WOULD SAY JUST THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS
I MEAN TO
UH WELL IF YOU'VE GOT THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS IN THE AVERAGE TIME YOU CAN THEN JUST GENERATE IT
UH
BUT THERE'LL ALSO BE A MINIMUM ONE
IT'LL NEED A SLIGHTLY LARGER UH JUST BECAUSE IF WHAT YOU HAVE I IS A SORT OF LARGER ERROR OR OF B ERROR MARGIN AROUND IT
UH NO
THE M THE MOUSE THE GAZE AND THE PART ARE ALL LAYERED
UH UNLE UH BUT IT UH UNLESS WE JUST DEFINE IT AS THERE'S ONLY THEY'RE THEY ARE EXCLUSIVE
AND IT'S IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE EXACTLY FIFTY PERCENT IN ONE OBJECT AND FIFTY PERCENT IN THE OTHER
UH
WELL I UH UH PUT THESE THINGS ON
UH UH WHAT I'M I'M THINKING IS IF YOU'VE GOT SAY ONE OBJECT THERE AND RIGHT
UH PART ONE AND PART TWO
UH THAT'S W UH THAT'S THAT'S A DECISION WE'LL UH UH UH I'M SAYING IS IF THEY'RE LOOKING IF MOST OF WHAT THEIR OVERLAP IS HERE THEN WE STICK WITH THAT ONE
UH THAT'S TH WE NO THAT BECAUSE UM THE GAZE POSITION WILL BE A SORT OF FUZZY AREA
IT'LL IT'LL BE AN ACTUAL LIKE CIRCLE AND AREA
SO YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO SEE THEM FLIPPING BETWEEN UH WHEN YOU DECIDE THEY'RE LOOKING THERE MM-HMM IF THEY'RE REALLY CLOSE YEAH
H YES
SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE QUITE AS CLEAR IF YOU CAN'T CAN'T CHOP IT OFF
I SO EACH
WAI W I TH UH
UH WITH SAME SHAPE BUT NOT THE SAME SHAPE AND COLOUR
UH SAME EYE
UH
UH YES
THAT ALSO MEANS IN THE P NEW PARTS LIST THEY'RE THERE FOR YOU KNOW TWO V LARGE TRIANGLES AND TWO SMALL ONE SMALL ONES SAY
WHEREAS IN IN THE REVISED EDITION IF THEY WERE ALL JUST BLACK THERE'D ONLY BE ONE UH MOLD IN THE NEW PARTS
AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S HARD WIRED
BUT SAME PART IN DIFFERENT COLOURS YEAH
NO WHAT I MEAN THERE'S MORE THAN THEY'RE MULTIPLE PIECES THAT LOOK THE SAME
SO YOU SEE THE MOLD IS THERE
I I IT APPEARS IN THE NEW P UH LIKE UH SUDDENLY THE TH TH THE NEW PART LIGHTS UP SORT OF THING AND IT'S THERE
WE I ASSUME THE THE BAUFIX
THE THERE AREN'T ANY EXTRA PARTS
BUT THEY C YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THE TRASH CAN IDEA THAT THEY BRING A
WHAT I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER IS IF THE PEOPLE DELIBERATELY BREAK THINGS BY MOVING TWO PIECES TOGETHER
SO THE I INTENTIONAL THING IS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY BOTH CLICK ON THE SAME OBJECT AND IT BREAKS
OH UH YES
SO OUR YES RATHER THAN THE NUMBER OF PENALTIES OR OR SOMETHING
NO THE THE SCORE W UH IS FINE
UH YE THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY IT'S WORKED OUT
BUT UH UH THE PROBLEM WAS UM TO DO WITH THE M THE P THEY HAD A RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE PIECE AND UH IT'S ALL TO S TO THE SYMMETRY OF THAT
IT WASN'T IT WASN'T A BUG
UH YES IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD TO BE DEFINED AND THE UH DUTCH LOT DIDN'T
BUT UM IT'S NOT CLEAR ENOUGH IN THE DOCUMENTATION
OR OH WE'RE WELL WE YEAH
THEY DON'T SEE THEIR OWN GAZE TO THE OTHER PERSON
YEAH I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE I WAS ASSUMING WE'D JUST GET ONE AND ONE LICENCE BOTH OF US
OH I MEAN NOT DURING THE TASK
NO THEY'RE THEY'RE ON TWO S THE TWO SEPARATE MACHINES AND THE YOU YOU START AND END THEM SEPARATELY
THE THEY THEY'RE NOT TALKING TO EACH OTHER
YOU START IT RECORDING AND IT STARTS RECORDING WHAT'S ON ONE SCREEN
UH YEAH
SEE HOW HOW LONG IT TOOK THEM ACTUALLY
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE THEM TO CALIBRATE
HOW MANY T HOW MANY TIMES BEFORE UH THE VALIDATION WORKED OR SOMETHING
UH WE'RE JUST GETTING WE'VE GOT ONE CABLE AND TO THE TWO MICS
I SUPPOSE WE CAN DO IT IS IT WOULD IT BE WORTH SPLITTING IT
UH YEAH
SO THE AT AT AT THE MOMENT IT'S INS WELL
WHAT WE'VE FINALLY JUST UH AT TWELVE O'CLOCK TODAY LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT IT SUSSED UM IS TO GET ONE CHANNEL ONE MICROPHONE BEING THE LEFT CHANNEL AND ONE BEING THE RIGHT CHANNEL TO MERGE INTO A STEREO SINGLE FILE
UH UNFORTUNATELY THE ON ONE MACHINE
SO SO M SO I ASSUME THAT WELL ONCE YOU'VE THAT SORT OF INFORMATION YOU WELL YOU GOT THE G. D. F. FORMAT
YOU THEN FILTER IT TO SAY RIGHT BETWEEN TIME X. AND TIME Y. THEY'RE THEY'RE CONSTRUCTING THAT HAVING TRIANGLE ONE TO THE CONSTRUCT
YEAH 'CAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S GONNA CO THAT'S 'CAUSE B THE DIAGRAM WE GOT THERE SUGGESTING THAT THEY'RE ONLY LOOKING THING AT TIME
BUT SO WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THERE IS THEY CAN BE LOOKING AT THE TRIANGLE AND MAYBE A MOUSE POINTER AND MAYBE AN EYE AT THE SAME TIME
AS LONG AS AS LONG AS THEY'VE GOT AN I. D. IN THERE WE CAN JUST SAY RIGHT AT THIS P BETWEEN THESE TIMES THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT OBJECT OR THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE MOUSE
WELL THE THE THE IT DEPEN DEPENDS ON THE DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU BUILD IN
BUT TH BUT SA BUT THING IS IF IF WE IF WE GOT IF WE GOT TRACKS FOR EACH FOR EACH PART WE CAN WE CAN EASILY ANALYSE IT DOWN LATER ON
WELL THE THE THE THE DOESN'T REALLY LIST PART IN THE IN THE G. D. F.
THERE SO THAT BAS BASICALLY WHAT I'VE GOT IS WELL THERE THERE THERE'S PLACES WHERE YOU GOT THE I. D. THOUGH
SO YOU'VE THE AN I. D. FOR A PART YOU GOT AN I. D. FOR A LOCATION ON THE SCREEN
THE TH YEAH THE BUT BUT
BECAUSE IT UH TH IT'S IT'S GENERATING A NEW I. D. WHEN YOU C WHEN YOU CREATE A NEW PART
SO IF THE IF A JOINT EVENT IF IF IF IT'S THERE'S JOINT EVENT LINKED TO LINKED TO THE ITEM THEN YOU KNOW IT'S BECOME PART OF A CONSTRUCT
YEAH THE THE THE YEAH
SO THAT I'M ACT THERE'S ACTUALLY A S A SEPARATE FILE OF THE DATA FORMAT WHICH SAYS FOR EACH CONSTRUCT
WHICH WHICH TWO PARTS MADE IT MADE THAT CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT CONSTRUCT
BUT YOU CAN STILL TA YOU CAN STILL TRACK WHAT PARTS WENT INTO IT
BUT BUT THAT'S EASY N UH IT'S EASY TO DO BECAUSE THE THE CO EACH CONSTRUCT HAS THE I. D. S FOR THE PA THE THINGS THAT CONSTRUCT IT
WELL WE'LL D YEAH WELL WITH THE YEAH D WELL THING IS THAT WE WE STILL HAVE THE X. WA THE X. WAVE TRACES FROM THE ASCII FORMATS
THAT'S IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THAT DATA OUT
BUT I CAN EASILY ADD IT TO GIVE THAT INFORMATION IF YOU WANT
YEAH IF IF YOU TAKE IT IF YOU T IF YOU CREA IF YOU CREATE A NEW PART IT UH IT GETS A NEW I. D.
UH
YEAH I MEAN THE WE E
YEAH I MEAN YOU KNOW WHI YOU KNOW WHICH WAY THEY MATCH
THERE'S THERE'S THEN TWO TRIANGLE ISN'T THERE
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SPECIFY THE MOLDS IN THE IN THE IN THE P THE FILE THAT C THAT GENERATES THE PARTS LIKE A LIST OF PARTS
SO SO HO HOWEVER MANY PART HOWEVER MANY MO HOWEVER MANY PARTS THERE ARE IN THE FILE THAT'S HOW MANY PARTS APPEAR IN THE IN THE PARTS BOX
IF YOU HAVE FIVE BLACK TRIANGLES GONNA BE FIVE FIVE PARTS IN THE FI FIVE BLACK BLACK TRIANGLES IN THE PARTS BOX
BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WELL IF IN THE IN THE INITIAL CONFIGURATION YOU CAN RE USE A TRIANGLE
SO IF YOU SO IF YOU ONLY WANT ONE BLACK TRIANGLE
YOU JUST CREATE ONE BLACK TRIANGLE IN THE PARTS BOX AND THEN RE USE THAT PA THAT TRIANGLE FIVE TIMES IN THE CONFIGURATION
UM AND YEAH AS I SAY THE
THE RESULT THE T WHAT YOU NEED FOR A JOIN ACTION YOU NEED TO YEAH A CONSTRUCT AND A PART TWO PARTS WHATE WHATEVER YOU'RE TAKING TOGETHER
SO YOU'LL SO YOU'LL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE REPLACING
IF IF IF WHAT IF ONE IF ONE PERSON'S TRYING TO GET A PART TO A PART THAT ISN'T THAT THAT SO THE PART THAT'S JUST SITTING ON THE SCREEN THAT'S NOT BEING TOUCHED
NO THE THE THE THERE'S THERE'S VERY SMALL GRAPHICAL BUGS
'CAUSE YEAH THE R THE RECORDING YEAH THE RECORDING THI PRO PROGRAM IS JUST QUITE A IT'S QUITE A SMALL PROGRAM
THEY JUST GEN IT JUST GENERATES THE VIDEO AND SO I DON'T KNOW DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH HAVING A LOOK AT THE LICENSING FOR THAT JUST TO SEE
NO YOU GOT YOU
YEAH YOU GOT EXACTLY THE SAME ACCESS TO SOUND QUALITY AS YOU GOT FROM ANYTHI ANYTHING ELSE ON THE WINDOWS
UH YEAH
BECAUSE THE THE SYNCHRONIZATION THE AUDIO AND VI THE AUDIO VISUAL SYNCHRONISATION COMES AT A SPECIFIC POINT IN THE EYE TRACK FILE
UH WELL THE WELL THE MATLAB SCRIPT UH BAS JUST SA UH JUST SAYS UH YEAH
YEAH THE THE THE THERE'S A SIGNAL AT THE START AND THE END OF EVERY TRIAL
BUT IT'S A MONO BUT IT'S A MONO UH MICROPHONE
SO IT'S A SO IT'S A LIT SO IT'S QUIETER BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS THOUGH IT'S NOT POWERED
THE SO THE SOUND THE SOUND THE S
WELL THE YEAH THE THE YEAH THE THE THE THE JACK THAT IS THAT IT'S PLUGGED INTO IS STEREO
BUT WHEN YOU PLUG IN WHEN IT'S RECORDING FROM MICROPHONE IT RECORDS IN MONO
ALS THINK WE WE HAVE A WELL I SUPPO I SUPPOSE IT WELL ONE TH ONE THING YOU DO IS UH RE IS RECORD THE SOU SPEECH SIGNAL SEPARATELY FOR EACH FOR EACH PERSON
SO IF UH SO IF I I IF EACH MACHINE RECORDED ITS OWN WITH A RECORDED THE RECORDED LIKE THE THE P TH THE UH THE USER ON THAT ONE
OH THEY YEAH
AND THEN THE SO THE YEAH
SO TH
IF IF NOTHING IF NOTHING ELSE YOU H UH IF NOTHING ELSE YOU CAN DO IT IN A MATLAB SCRIPT
'CAUSE YOU GOT A L YOU GOT A LIST OF WHERE THE WHERE THE BEEPS ARE
BUT THEY BOTH SUGGESTED THAT IT IS THERE IS A MONO THAT THERE THERE IS A MONO MICROPHONE
SO AND BASICALLY OUT THE OUTPUT THE G. D. F. IS JUST GONNA BE A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS YOU KNOW WITH START AND END TIME
AND THE EVENT'S GONNA HAVE WHATEVER ALL WHATEVER THE OBJECT UH IS THAT'S BEING LOOKED AT AND THINGS
UM AND THEN YEAH AND THEN IT'S A MATTER OF WE'RE GONNA PUT WHATEVER FILTERS YOU NEED AFTER THAT
I JUST WANT SO YOU CAN SAY FROM THE TIME WHERE THEY PICKED UP TRIANGLE ONE TO THE PART TIME IT BECAME PART OF THE ASSEMBLY
SO YOU GOT MO YEAH
UM AND YEAH AND OH YEAH AND SEE UH LOOKS AT LOOKS AT OBJECTS AND LOOKS WHATEVER ELSE
SO UM S
GET THAT TESTED NEXT COUPLE DAYS AND I ASSU I ASSUME THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU NEED ME FOR T IN TERMS OF THAT
SO WELL UNLE UNLESS UNLESS IT'S A BUG REPORT YEAH
I'LL W YEAH W I'LL I'LL I'LL B I'LL BE AROUND
BUT HO HOPEFULLY IT WILL RUN SMOOTHLY AND YEAH I CAN RELAX
UM SO WE'RE DESIGNING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL AND UM OH I HAVE TO RECORD WHO'S HERE ACTUALLY
UM YEAH SO DES UH DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
UM AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
IS THAT WHAT EVERYBODY GOT
UM AND AT THIS POINT WE GET TRY OUT THE WHITEBOARD OVER THERE
YOU CAN TAKE AS LONG OVER THIS AS YOU LIKE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT AN AWFUL LOT TO DISCUSS
OK OH WE DO WE DO
I'M GONNA HAVE TO THINK ON THE SPOT NOW
IS THAT A WHALE
AH
GOD I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA WRITE ABOUT
M MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS MY OWN DOG AT HOME
THAT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE HIM ACTUALLY
HE LOOKS MORE LIKE A PIG ACTUALLY
AH WELL
OH THAT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU
UH
UM HE'S VERY FRIENDLY AND CHEERY AND ALWAYS PLEASED TO SEE YOU AND VERY KIND OF AFFECTIONATE AND UM
UH AND HE'S QUITE QUITE WEE AS WELL SO YOU KNOW HE CAN DOESN'T TAKE UP TOO MUCH SPACE
AND UH AND HE DOES A FUNNY THING WHERE HE CHASES HIS TAIL AS WELL WHICH IS QUITE AMUSING SO
HE ONLY DOES IT AFTER HE'S HAD HIS DINNER AND UM HE'LL JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST GET UP AND START CHASING HIS TAIL 'ROUND THE LIVING ROOM
UM SO WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING THIS ON AN INTERNATIONAL SCALE
AND UH WE DON'T WANT IT TO COST ANY MORE THAN UH TWELVE FIFTY EUROS SO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE SELLING PRICE
AYE I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN YEAH
OH GOSH I SHOULD BE WRITING ALL THIS DOWN
WELL TWENTY FIVE EURO I MEAN THAT'S UM
OR NO IS IT AS MUCH AS THAT
UM WELL D DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO UH TO THE FINANCE ISSUE AT ALL
THIN
THAT WOULD BE USEFUL THOUGH WOULDN'T IT IF YOU KNEW LIKE WHAT YOUR MONEY WOULD GET YOU NOW
RIGHT SO DO YOU THINK THAT SHOULD BE LIKE A MAIN DESIGN AIM OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL D YOU KNOW
LIKE YOU MIGHT PUT IN THERE OH I WANT TO WATCH SUCH AND SUCH AND LOOK A OH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
UM OKAY UH I'D WEL WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WRAP UP PRETTY QUICKLY IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES
W YOU GET THOSE ONES WHERE YOU CAN IF YOU LIKE WHISTLE OR MAKE A REALLY HIGH PITCHED NOISE THEY BEEP
UM SO INBETWEEN NOW AND THEN UM AS THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL WORKING DESIGN OF IT SO Y YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE
WHAT REQUIREMENTS IT HAS TO HAS TO FULFIL AND YOU'LL ALL GET INSTRUCTIONS EMAILED TO YOU I GUESS
YEAH SO IT'S TH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN STAGE IS NEXT I GUESS
SO I GOT THAT LITTLE MESSAGE A LOT SOONER THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD SO
UM I GUESS THAT'S UP TO US I MEAN YOU PROBABLY WANT SOME KIND OF UNIQUE SELLING POINT OF IT SO UM YOU KNOW
HI I'M DAVID AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
UM I JUST GOT THE PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT WHAT THE PROJECT IS
THERE'S TOO MUCH GEAR
THEY COME IN AND GO EAT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT
FINDING THEM IS REALLY A PAIN YOU KNOW
I MEAN IT'S USUALLY QUITE SMALL OR WHEN YOU WANT IT RIGHT IT SLIPPED BEHIND THE COUCH OR IT'S KICKED UNDER THE TABLE
BECAUSE THERE'S A CAP THERE SO UM DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOU CAN CRAM INTO THAT PRICE
IS LIKE
IS THAT RIGHT
UH RIGHT WELL BASICALLY UM HIGH PRIORITY FOR ANY ANIMAL FOR ME IS THAT THEY BE WILLING TO TAKE A LOT OF PHYSICAL AFFECTION FROM THEIR FAMILY
IS HE AWARE THAT TH IT'S HIS OWN CHA TAIL HE'S CHASING
PROBABLY WHEN HE WAS LITTLE HE GOT LOTS OF ATTENTION FOR DOING IT AND HAS FOREVER BEEN CONDITIONED
SO COST LIKE PRODUCTION COST IS TWELVE FIFTY BUT SELLING PRICE IS IS THAT WHOLESALE OR RETAIL
LIKE ON THE SHELF
WELL RIGHT AWAY I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S UM TH TH UH LIKE WITH D. V. D. PLAYERS IF THERE ARE ZONES
UM F FREQUENCIES OR SOMETHING UM AS WELL AS UH CHARACTERS UM DIFFERENT UH KEYPAD STYLES AND S SYMBOLS
AND THEN A AND THEN AL THE OTHER THING INTERNATIONAL IS ON TOP OF THE PRICE
RIGHT AWAY I'M MAKING SOME KIND OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT WHAT INFORMATION WE'RE GIVEN HERE THINKING
SO I'M WONDERING RIGHT AWAY IS SELLING TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS THAT SORT OF THE THI IS THIS GONNA TO BE LIKE THE PREMIUM PRODUCT KINDA THING OR
DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON LIKE HOW THAT COMPARES TO OTHER
OTHER
YEAH INTERESTING THING ABOUT DISCUSSING UM PRODUCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL FOR ME IS THAT L AS YOU POINT OUT
LIKE SO SORT OF LIKE HOW DO YOU I I MEAN ONE ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT WOULD BE
OR ANOTHER WAY IS MAYBE PEOPLE WHO HAVE T. V. SETS ARE REALLY FED UP WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AND THEY REALLY WANT A BETTER ONE OR SOMETHING
RIGHT SO IN FUNCTION ONE OF THE PRIORITIES MIGHT BE TO COMBINE AS MANY USES
WELL LIKE UM MAYBE WHAT WE COULD USE IS A SORT OF LIKE A EXAMPLE OF A SUCCESSFUL OTHER PIECE TECHNOLOGY IS PALM PALM PILOTS
SO LIKE I WONDER IF WE MIGHT ADD SOMETHING NEW TO THE TO THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET SUCH AS THE LIGHTING IN YOUR HOUSE OR UM
AN
SO THEY W ALL WORK ACTUALLY FUNCTION TOGETHER BUT I HAVE DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS FOR EACH OF THEM
THAT'S JUST REALLY GOOD ID
UH SURE
I REMEMBER WHEN THE FIRST REMOTE CONTROL MY MY FAMILY HAD WAS ON A CABLE
ACTUALLY HAD A CABLE BETWEEN IT AND THE T. V. AND BIG LIKE BUTTONS THAT SORT OF LIKE LIKE ON A BLENDER OR SOMETHING
I DUNNO LIKE A MASSIVE JUNKY THING ON THE TABLE
S
'CAUSE IT COULD B IT COULD IT COULD BE THAT F IT COULD BE THAT FUNCTIONALLY THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY BETTER
BUT THAT JUST THE APPEAL OF OF NOT HAVING YOU KNOW
BEFORE WE WRAP UP JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE HERE UM
ARE WE AT MA RIGHT NOW ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT OUR TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL MAY HAVE FEATURES WHICH GO BEYOND THE TELEVISION
IS THAT ALRIGHT NOW
UM KIND OF UH GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT AND UH GOT FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE EQUIPMENT AND STARTED TO DISCUSS UM A BIT ABOUT THE PROJECT
YOU KNOW COST WISE HOW MUCH HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAD TO S
UM WHICH IS THE THE FIRST ONE IS THAT UM UH THE COMPANY'S DECIDED THAT TELETEXT IS OUTDATED UH BECAUSE OF HOW POPULAR THE INTERNET IS
UM THEY'VE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT WE UM WE ONLY USE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO CONTROL THE TELEVISION NOT THE V. C. R. D. V. D. OR ANYTHING ELSE
UM I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THE CORPORATE COLOUR IS
UH TH BECAUSE ON THE THE COMPANY WEBSITE UH WHAT DOES IT SAY
YEAH I MEAN DO THEY IS THAT SOMETHING THEY WANT ACTUALLY WRITTEN ON IT 'CAUSE IT'S QUITE LONG
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE THINGS JUST NOT TO WORRY ABOUT TELETEXT UH ONLY CONTROL THE T. V.
UM SO IS EVERYBODY OKAY WITH ANY OF THAT OR DO YOU WANT ME TO RECAP AT ALL
OOP
WELL WE CAN CHAT AWAY FOR UH FOR FIVE MINUTES OR SO I THINK AT AT MOST
SHALL WE SH WELL WE'LL STICK TO KIND OF YOUR AREA FOR NOW
I MEAN LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT LOOKS QUITE UM QUITE COMPLICATED AND THAT P. R. T. P P. R. O. T. THING IS INCREDIBLY CONFUSING
UM SO I SEE I SEE WHY YO YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT PREFER THE SIMPLER DESIGN BUT YEAH YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE OUT ON
YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES SO MAYBE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU GET A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE YOU KIND OF FLIP THE THING OPEN
GOD I WOU I WOULD SAY THAT'S REQUIRED
WELL DO YOU WANNA MAYBE JUST AT THIS POINT DECIDE ON WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE AS A P AS A FUNCTION OF THIS
OKA
UH WELL JUST TO TO WRAP UP QUICKLY ON THIS THIS LITTLE SECTION HAVE I JUST LOST OH NO
UM OKAY IF WE CAN MOVE ON TO NEXT PRESENTATION THEN PLEASE
BIT COMPLICATED
OH LIKE OVERLAP BETWEEN WHAT YOU SAID
OH WELL FOR ALL YOU KNOW THAT THAT'LL HAPPEN
OH OH HERE WE GO
SO WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD AND IS EASY TO USE BIG PRIORITIES
WELL UM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON BY THE END OF THE MEETING IS WHO WE'RE GONNA BE UM WHO'S OUR OUR TARGET AUDIENCE
UM SO IF WE WANT SOMETHING THAT THAT LOOKS GOOD AND IS EASY TO USE
BUT HAS Y IS FAIRLY POWERFUL PRODUCT WHATEVER WHO DO WE REALLY WANT TO AIM THAT AT
WELL I IF IF LIKE TWENTY FIVE EURO IS OUR IS OUR SELLING PRICE THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE
SO WHO DO YOU THINK WE'RE AIMING THIS AT
N YEAH
SO UM ANYBODY ANYTHING THERE TO ADD JUST KIND OF YOUNG PROFESSIONALS
UH TH LIKE IF WE ARE GOING TO INCLUDE SPEECH RECOGNITION IT'S KIND OF BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND THIRTY FIVE SEEMS TO BE LIKE A REALLY HIGH RESPONSE TO THAT
UH OKAY
WELL DO YOU WANNA UM GIVE US YOUR PRESENTATION AND THEN THEN WE CAN I DON'T KNOW UM MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA TO ALL DELIVER OUR PRESENTATIONS AND THEN DISCUSS
OH IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S JUST OCCURRED TO ME AS WELL IS IF WE MAKE IT UM SPEECH RECO IF WE INCORPORATE SPEECH RECOGNITION
DO YOU THINK MAYBE WE NEED LIKE FURTHER ADVANCES IN THAT KIND OF AREA UNTIL IT'S WORTHWHILE INCORPORATING IT THOUGH
UH
ARE YOU ARE YOU ALL DONE
WELL WELL A WORRY THAT WAS WAS EXPRESSED IN THE NEW REQUIREMENTS WAS THAT IF WE MADE THIS TOO COMPLEX IT WOULD E IT WOULD EFFECT UM HOW LONG HOW LONG IT TOOK US TO GET THIS TO MARKET
SO I TH SUSPECT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA JUST TO RESTRICT OUR KIND OF OUR CREATIVE INFLUENCE ON THIS ON THE USER INTERFACE AND NOT WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT UH HOW WE TRANSMIT IT UM BECAUSE I MEAN IT IT'S TRIED AND TESTED INTRA RED
SO WE COULD STAY WITH THA
W
UM IS IT WORTH CONSIDERING LIKE HAVING LIKE A CHARGING UNIT AS OPPOSED TO JUST REGULAR BATTERIES
SO BASICALLY THE UM I'M JUST GONNA JUST RECAP UH WHAT I SAID AT THE START
WAS THAT UM THE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MEETING WAS TO F ABSOLUTELY FINALISE WHO WE'RE GONNA AIM THIS AT AND WHAT EXACTLY THE PRODUCT'S GONNA DO
SO UM JUST TO RECAP ON ARE WE ALL HAPPY ABOUT THE IDEA OF UM AIMING THE PRODUCT AT UM THE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE BRACKET
OKAY SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE UM AUDIO WHICH IS GONNA BE LIKE YOU KNOW YOUR BASS SETTINGS AND ACTUAL VOLUME HI OKAY
LIKE WHAT CHANNEL YOU'RE WATCHING TURNING ON AN OFF STUFF LIKE THAT
BECAUSE OF WHO WE'RE WE'RE YOU KNOW TARGETING THIS AT
WHICH WHICH IS THE CLUNKY ONE THE ONE ON LEFT OR ON THE RIGHT
NEXT TO THE CONTROL ON THE LEFT
INCREASE THAT 'CAUSE WE CAN'T SEE THE
IS THAT TOO IS THAT A LOT OF MONEY TO BUY AN EXTRA REMOTE OR A REPLACEMENT REMOTE
UM SO MAYBE NOT THE HIGH END RANGE BUT MAYBE MIDDLE MIDDLE UP ISH
I I THINK TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE IS IS IS FAIR TO ADD THAT IN AS A GROUP AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S MORE THAN HALF YOUR GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO AT LEAST TRY AND USE YOUR TECHNOLOGY
I THINK PERHAPS THAT AGE GROUP IS SIGNIFICANT AS WELL BECAUSE THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO USE THE COMPUTER
I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE MAYBE ABOUT I WOULDN'T SAY THIRTY FIVE
WHEN YOU GO ON TO THEIR WORKING LIVES PEOPLE WHO WOULD YOU KNOW REGULAR YEAH
BECAUSE UM BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE GO Y EVERYBODY'S SAYING RIGHT YOU WANT SOMETHING SIMPLE
BUT AT END OF THE DAY WE DON'T LOOK AT THE TECHNOLOGY BUT WE LOOK AT THE FUNCTION FIRST
WE'VE USED IT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT BUT WE'RE WE CAN'T N WE HAVEN'T NARROWED DOWN UM EXACTLY WHAT THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO FULFIL
UM AND I JUST THE IDEA IS JUST TO GET EVERYBODY TO UM I USUALLY HAVE A HAVE HAVE A DESIGN THAT'S THERE AS A BASIC
BUT I GUESS EVERYBODY DOES HAVE SOME IDEA SO I DON'T THINK UM THERE'S A NEED FOR THAT
UM OKAY THIS FINDING THINGS IS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING SO I'LL GO INTO THE DIAGRAM FIRST
UM AND THAT POWER SOURCE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT TIES YOU DOWN TO UM HOW LONG THE DEVICE WILL LAST
TH OKAY THE BASIC THING IS THERE'S A USER INTERFACE WHERE PEOPLE PUNCH A BUTTON OR TALK INTO IT OR SMILE TO IT OR BLINK THEIR EYES WHATEVER
AND THE DEVICE HAS TO R YOU KNOW BASED ON YOU PUSH BUTTON A. SO I WILL DO SOMETHING WITH BUTTON A.
UM AND THEN IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SEND THE SIGNAL OUT TO THE DEVICE ITSELF WHICH IS THE RECEIVER HERE
RIGHT UM IF IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS IMPORTANT THEN WE JUST ADD MORE POWER RATHER THAN HAVING A THING THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER
SO IT'S NOT REALLY A CONSTRAINT IN THAT SENSE BUT I MEAN THESE ARE FUNCTIONALLY YOU KNOW THE BASE WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS TO DO
UM THESE THESE AREN'T TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS IN THAT SENSE
UH
UM AND THE RECEIVER OKAY AND THE POWER ARE THINGS THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT
UM AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT BASED ON WHAT YOUR USER INTERFACE REQUIRES THEN WE'LL ADD MORE FUNCTIONALITY TO IT
UM THERE MIGHT BE ONE OTHER CONSIDERATION WHICH WOULD BE THAT THE THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE T. V. FOR EXAMPLE
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY BE PHYSICALLY BE POINTING TO
THERE MIGHT BE ONE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION UM IN PARTICULAR RIGHT NOW SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VOICE RECOGNITION
UM IF SOMEBODY'S GONNA H TALK TO THE DEVICE YOU IDEALLY WANT THEM TO HOLD IT TO THEM
THEN YOU NEED TO SEND THE SIGNAL OUT SO BECAUSE IF YOU'RE USING INFRA RED THE LINE OF SIGHT UM SAY THE T. V. 'S AT THAT CHAIR
SO IN THAT SENSE THERE'S NOT REALLY A RESTRICTION BUT IT'S SOMETHING WHICH YOU MAY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT LATER ON IN THE PROCESS
NOT SO MUCH FURTHER DOWN
THERE'S THERE'S NOT MUCH SPECIFIC SPECIFIC INFORMATION BUT I THINK THAT UM ONE INDICATION OF INFRA RED MEAN THAT YOU'RE JUST TARGETING TRADITIONAL DEVICES
THERE'S A THERE'S OKAY FROM FROM A FROM A COMPONENT POINT OF VIEW THERE'S ADDED COMPLEXITY
AND YOU ADD COST TO IT UM AND THEN THERE'S PROBABLY THE FACT THAT YOU NEED ANOTHER PHYSICAL COMPONENT
YOU NEED A DOCKING CRADLE FOR EXAMPLE FOR YOU TO PUT IT IN TO CHARGE
UM AND MOST USERS ARE VERY F USE ALREADY USED TO THE IDEA OF BUYING BATTERIES AND PUTTING IT INTO THE CONTROLLER
UM THIS MAY NOT MAP VERY WELL TO ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY ESPECIALLY BUT I THINK THAT UM FROM A MANUFACTURER'S POINT OF VIEW FROM A PERSON DESIGNING THE DEVICE
BUT I THINK FROM A POINT OF VIEW OF A PERSON USING THE DEVICE YOU KNOW A T. V. IS SOMETHING THEY SEE AND SOMETHING THEY HEAR
UM IT'S SOMETHING THEY DO OTHER THINGS TO LIKE TURN IT ON AND TURN IT OFF
I ME MEAN IN TERMS OF PICTURE AND THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE YOU KNOW UM SO UM AND CHANNEL
ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T TURN OFF THE VIDEO ON YOUR T. V.
SO YOU YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF PUTTING IT ON TO UM OTHERS OR A DEVICE
WE PUT IT OUT
YOU YOU PUT THAT INTO AUDIO
LIKE RANDOM WHICH WE HAVE NO OTHER PLACE TO PUT BUT WE NEED IT SOMEWHERE THERE
UH
UM I'VE HAD A LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS PRODUCTS TO SEE WHAT THEY OFFER AND UM I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU GUYS FOR UM YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THE DESIGN AT THE END OF THE MEETING
THERE'S EITHER UM A VERY COMPLICATED ONE THAT'S GOT LOTS OF BUTTONS LOTS OF COLOURS VERY CONFUSING YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
UM THERE'S AN EXAMPLE I'LL SHOW YOU AT THE END UM SH SHOW YOU NOW
UH
THAT ONE'S PERG AND THAT ONE'S PROG AND IT DOESN'T REALLY TELL YOU WHAT IT DOES
IT'S GOT ONLY THE BASIC FUNCTIONS MM BUT UM IT'S THE SAME SIZE AS THE THE HARD TO USE ONE
THEY'RE VERY BIG AND NOT VERY MUCH USE FOR BUTTONS
UM BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES LACK THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS WHICH I I QUITE LIKE HAVING ON THE CONTROLS
UM SO I BELIEVE THE THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS SHOULD MAYBE BE HIDDEN IN A DRAWER OR SOMETHING LIKE THA FROM THE BOTTOM OF IT
UM THE CLUNKY ONE IS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S VERY SPREAD OUT AND KIND OF YOU KNOW I GET THE IDEA IT'D BE SORT OF ABOUT THIS SIZE
GOT VERY FEW BUTTONS ON IT AND
I MEAN SO FAR I'VE GOT UM ON AND OFF UM SWITCH THE CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AND PUT THE VOLUME UP AND DOWN
UM YOU SAY THAT'S A H A REQUIRED ONE OR A REQUESTED ONE
WOULD YOU LIKE UM THE CHANNELS LIKE THE THE NUMBERS ON THING UM
THERE'S UM ON AND OFF UM VOLUME AND CHANNEL AND SKIP TO CERTAIN CHANNELS WITH THE NUMBERS
THINK MAYBE THE THE WIRE IN THE BACK MIGHT BE LOOSE
UM ON OFF UP AND DOWN CHANNELS UP AND DOWN VOLUME AND UH SKIP TO A CHANNEL
UM JUST ABOUT THE THREE BUCKETS UM WHAT WOULD GO IN THE THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS ONE
COULD YOU PLUG ME IN
M YEAH
LIKE A LOT OF A LOT OF WHAT I'VE UM READ AND PREPARED FOR THIS MEETING FITS IN REALLY CLOSELY WITH WHAT WITH WHAT CRAIG'S JUST GONE OVER
SO IN PART I COULD I COULD GIVE YOU SOME OF MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES BUT I COULD ALSO TH ADD SOME TO THIS WHICH IS JUST ABOUT SORT OF UM SORT OF MARKET RESEARCH
UM CLUNKY IN WHAT SENSE LIKE UM H HEAVIER
UP THE NUMBERS OR THE UP DOWN
WELL I THINK I THINK ES ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE CATEGORISING
WE'RE SAYING WELL WE WANT THIS TO BE A PRODUCT THAT OFFERS ALL THE SORT OF MORE TRICKY FEATURES BUT WE WANT THEM TO BE IN ANOTHER AREA
IS THAT RIGHT
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING
WE'RE KIND OF LIKE SORTING THEM AN OR ARE WE ACTUALLY ELIMINATING THINGS WE JUST DON'T WANT THE PRODUCT TO HAVE
WELL ONE ONE WAY I WOULD LOOK AT THIS UM WOULD BE THAT WE A APPROACH THE DIFFERENT CONTROLS IN TERMS OF UM LIKE CONTROL TYPES
FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAD AUDIO CONTROLS THOSE COULD BE SOMETHING PEOPLE SET UP VERY RARELY
MAYBE THEY'RE UN THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE IN A LITTLE AREA BUT COVERED UP UM THINGS LIKE CHANNEL AND VOLUME UM ARE USED ALL THE TIME
SO WE JUST HAVE THEM RIGHT OUT ON TOP UM VERY JUST VERY SORT OF SELF EXPLANATORY
UM SO MAYBE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HAVING THREE OR MORE GROUPINGS OF CONTROLS
YOU KNOW LIKE ONE WHICH ARE JUST THE THE HABITUAL ONES THAT SHOULD BE RIGHT WITHIN YOUR NATURAL GRIP
KINDA THIS IS SO THIS I'M ALL IN A KNOT NOW
I DUNNO WHETHER THIS IS FOR GOOD OR FOR BAD BUT THERE'LL BE A LOT OF KIND OF UH REDUNDANCY IN THE IN THE THE ISSUES AND THE THE UH THE THINGS
WHICH IS MA NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING
BUT MAY WHAT I'VE ALREADY STARTED DOING IS CR I CREATED A SLIDE IN IN MY PRESENTATION HERE SO UM SO THAT WE KIND OF THINK WELL WHAT'S THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF WHAT WE'VE TAKEN FROM YOUR IDEAS AND AND MINE
OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY WHAT YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME WHAT YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME IMPACTS A LOT ON WHAT UM LIKE MARKET RESEARCH MM THAT THAT I'VE BEEN SO HOW DO I HOW DO I GET THIS UP
OH AND F. EIGHT
JUST UM BEFORE I BRING THIS UP WHAT I'LL JUST SAY IS UM WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE DONE IS TRIED TO COLLECT SOME INFORMATION SO THAT I CAN THEN RELAY THIS TO TO YOU GUYS SO THAT IT'S NOW BECOMES A COLLECTIVE THING
AND THEN KIND OF LEAD US IN THE DIRECTION OF DECIDING 'KAY WHAT WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS
SO WHAT I BASICALLY GOT IS I JUST LOOKED INTO SOME INFORMATION AND SORT OF TH TRIED TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW WE COULD REVIEW IT AND HOW WE COULD AND WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS WE COULD TAKE AWAY FROM IT AND THEN MAYBE BY THE END OF JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE THINGS WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE OUR PRIORITIES
SO UM I'M THINKING HERE ABOUT UH PRIMARILY ABOUT CUSTOMER NEEDS THAT WE START WITH THE CUSTOMER
UH TO THINK ABOUT TRENDS AND ALSO ABOUT TRY AND CONNECT THAT AS YOU SEE WITH THE COMPANY VISION WHICH IS ABOUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
UM AND THEN AS I SAY UH W WE'D LIKE TO PRIORITISE OUR DESIGN FEATURES FROM THIS AND UM
SO THIS IS WHAT I'VE FOUND HERE UM A LOT OF THIS IS NEW TO ME SO WE'LL JUST READ THROUGH TOGETHER
THE VAST MAJORITY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY FOR UM SLIGHTLY MORE INTUITIVE CONTROL SUCH AS VOICE RECOGNITION
UM MOST PEOPLE USE ONLY A F A VERY SLIM PORTION OF ALL THE CONTROLS
SO I GUESS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS PEOPLE WANT THIS H TECHNOLOGY
SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE LIKE IF FOR ME THIS IS SORTA LIKE THREE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM INSPIRATIONS
YOU KNOW ONE IS THAT WE WANT UH SOMETHING THAT'S HIGH TECH BUT WE WANT IT TO SEEM EASY
AND IN SPITE OF THE PRIMITIVE SIDE OF IT AND THE VERY HIGH TECH SIDE WE WANT IT TO JUST BE AN APPEALING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN PEOPLE'S HANDS
THEY GET LOST A LOT S AS IT CAME UP IN OUR LAST MEETING
SO D IT DOESN'T JUST LOOK LIKE A BIG PANEL KINDA LIKE WHEN YOU YOU LOOK AT
IF YOU WANT AUDIO IF YOU WANT VISUAL THEN YOU HAVE THOSE
UH NO THAT DID NOT COME UP AT ALL
AND AND AGAIN HERE AS WE SORT OF MOVE M SORT OF THIN START THINKING ABOUT HOW WE WANNA SELL AND MARKET THIS
I THINK A RECURRING THEME HERE IS THE COMPANY WANTS IT TO BE WANTS US TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S FASHIONABLE AND SLEEK AND TRENDY
SO WE WANNA THINK ABOUT AS WE TAKE ALL THE SORT OF THE TECHIE FEATURES HOW WE CAN UM PUT THAT INTO A UNIT WHICH IS WHICH PEOPLE LIKE
SO YOU KNOW JUST C LOOKING AT WHAT WHAT CRAIG UM CRAIG'S I UH IDEAS ARE S SORTA TELL ME THAT MAYBE WHAT WE WANNA DO IS TRY AND UM SEPARATE THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE WANNA INCLUDE IN THIS
SOMETHING REALLY LIKE ABOUT 'EM IS IF YOU WANNA JUST TURN 'EM ON AND OFF YOU CAN
THAT'S S THAT'S SORT OF THE UM BUT I I'M MY HOPE HERE IS THAT I'M PUTTING OUT THIS INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN THEN SAY OKAY
UM I I HAVEN'T BROUGHT OUT ONE SPECIFIC MARKETING IDEA
ALTHOUGH MY SENSE IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD TRY AND THINK ABOUT IS WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS IN MATERIALS AND SHAPES AND STYLES AND THEN USE THAT
THESE ARE THE AGE GROUPS WHICH WE HAVE INFORMATION ON AND THESE ARE THIS IS A TABLE OF H WHAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY MORE FOR A CERTAIN FEATURE
JUST GIVES US A ROUGH IDEA OF WHERE THE W THE WILL TO SPEND MONEY ON T. V. EQUIPMENT IS
UH YEAH IT'S THE
COULD IT BE AN ON OFF THING
LIKE IF YOU WANT IT ON YEAH
YEAH IT'S GOOD WELL IT'S GOOD TO GET IDEAS OUT WHILE THEY'RE FRESH IN MIND
AND ALSO IT HELPS IN TERMS OF PEOPLE NOT LOSING THIS YOU KNOW THEY THEY'RE SAYING OH IT'S I LOSE IT IN THE COUCH
LIKE WE'RE KIND OF WHAT WE'RE B SORT OF GETTING IN INTO HERE IS MATING DIFFERENT UH DESIGN FEATURES TOGETHER THAT THEY
AND LIKE ON THE MEANS B SINCE WE'RE ON THE TOPIC OF THE TECHNOLOGY UH ARE THERE ANY LIKE WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS
ALRIGHT WHAT'S WHAT I IN IS THIS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE GO ABOUT IT OR ARE THERE OTHER THIN
UH DOES C IS OUR CONTROLLER IS IT HAVE THE OPTION OF BEING UM ON A STANDARD UH FREQUENCY AS ALL OF THE OTHER EQUIPMENT
AND IS IT GOING TO INCLUDE ANY OF THE UH THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES OR ARE WE GONNA ELIMINATE THOSE
R IS IT IS IT IS IT S IS IT NOT AN OPTION STILL THAT WE INCLUDE SOME THINGS JUST AS A SORT OF UNDER LIKE SORT OF UNDER A DOOR OR SOME
'CAUSE WHAT WHAT I'M I'D BE A BIT WORRIED ABOUT IS IF SOMEONE WAS H HAD PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED HABITS OF EXPECTING TO CONTROL SURROUND SOUND OR THIS AND THAT WITH THEIR CONTROLLER AND THEN AND THEN THEY
WHERE WE THINK OF THESE THREE SORT OF BUCKETS AND ANYTHING ANYTHING WE DISCUSS ABOUT THEM IS SORT OF OKAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS
WELL HOW UM ON THE IN THIS MEETING THEN IF WE UM
AND I TOLD YOU GUYS ABOUT THE THREE NEW REQUIREMENTS ABOUT IGNORING TELETEXT IGNORING EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE T. V.
IS THERE ANYTHING HAVE I FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
IS THAT EVERYTHING
OH I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT UM THE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF FINAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS MEETING IS TO REACH A DECISION ON THE CONCEPTS OF THE PRODUCT
AYE A FAIR POINT DEFINITELY
AYE RIGHT
AH
OH SOMETHING COMING NOW YEAH
I THINK IT'S YELLOW BECAUSE LIKE THE WEBSITE IS YELLOW AND THERE'S A BAND AT THE BOTTOM IS YELLOW SO YELLOW
AYE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA YEAH
DO Y DO YOU WANNA SIT IN THE THE LINE OF SIGHT OF THIS UM
WE YOU COULDN'T HAVE LIKE PLASTIC AND RUBBER
UH YEAH YEAH I SEE
AND JUST GIVING AN ID IDEA ON THE TIME WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES TO PLAY WITH AT MOST
SO UM YEAH SO JUST T TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS MEETING IS TO REACH AN DECISION ON THE THE THE CONCEPTS OF THE PRODUCT
SO MAYBE DO Y ARE WE THINKING SOMETHING THAT LIKE S COULD SIT IN YOUR HAND COMFORTABLY OR DO YOU TH YOU'D HOLD ONTO COMFORTABLY OR
COLOUR WISE I MEAN YOU MADE A RE UH WAS IT YOU OR UH I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO MADE THE POINT ABOUT HOW IF YOU'VE A NICE BRIGHT COLOUR YOU'LL NOT LOSE IT
WHOSE ABOUT HOW IF YOU HAVE A BRIGHT COLOUR YOU'LL NOT LOSE IT SO MUCH
OH YOU KNOW LIKE IN CIRCULAR IN SHAPE OR
INTO IT
WELL I'M DO WE REALLY WANT IT IN LIKE THE SHAPE OF A LEMON OR NO I DON'T THINK WE DO EITHER
DO YOU WANNA DRAW IT ON THE BOARD
OOH THAT'D BE GOOD
I MEAN DO YOU WANT THE WHOLE THING YELLOW MAYBE LIKE YELLOW AND WHITE DO YOU WANT SOMETHING
UM AND ALSO I MEAN HOW ARE WE GOING TO INCORPORATE THE SLOGAN IN
OR WHEN YOU LIKE OR IF YOU TURN IT OFF OR SOMETHING IF IT CAN SPEAK IF IT COULD ACTUALLY SAY THE SLOGAN IT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE POWERFUL THAN JUST HAVING IT WRITTEN ON IT SOMEWHERE
I D I D ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT AT ALL
UM UNLESS AN A I MEAN IF YOU ALSO WOULD THAT WORK IF WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE UM AN L. C. D. DISPLAY WHERE WOULD WE PUT THAT
WOULD WE PUT THAT ON THE INSIDE OR
MM OH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
SO SO NO NEED FOR AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS REALLY NO UM
I WOULD SAY NO NEED FOR A TALK BACK
UM I MEAN DO YOU WANNA GROUP THEM INTO S HEAD OF THE SNOWMAN BODY OF THE SNOWMAN INSIDE OF THE SNOWMAN IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
SO I'M JUST GONNA UM POP THIS IN HERE 'CAUSE I HAVE A SLIDE ABOUT DECISION MAKING WHICH I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT
SO YOU'D HAVE THE BATTERY AS THE KIND OF TO KEEP IT TICKING OVER IDEA I'M REALLY SORRY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WRAP UP QUITE QUICKLY
WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS I THOUGHT
OKAY UM AS FOR THE CASE KIND OF DISCUSSED THAT
YEAH I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE RUBBER BUTTONS THAT FEEL KIND OF
AYE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
S SO LIKE CUR SLIGHTLY TRANSPARENT CASE SO IT'S YELLOW LIKE TINTED YELLOW BUT YOU CAN MAYBE SEE THROUGH IT
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN
UM I'M ALL FOR THEM ACTUALLY I THINK THEY'RE QUITE YOU KNOW TH VERY QUICK TO M TO USE
SO DOES ANYBODY OPPOSE THE IDEA OF OF INCORPORATING ONE INTO THE DESIGN AT ALL
UH-HUH OOH OKAY WE REALLY GOTTA WRAP UP SO YEAH
YEAH LET'S LET'S TRY AND GET THE SLOGAN ON THERE UM AND
RIGHT I'M GONNA HAVE TO I'M REALLY GONNA HAVE TO HURRY YOU ON HERE 'CAUSE WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY OVER TIME
UM IS THERE ANYTHING ANYBODY'S UNSURE ABOUT
IS EVERYBODY KIND OF HAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BE DOING
SO UM THAT'S REALLY GOOD LIKE WE'VE S HAD MUCH TO TALK ABOUT THAT UM PRETTY MUCH RUN OUT OF TIME TO DO SO
'S TO DO NOW IS TO DECIDE HOW TO FULFIL WHAT YOUR STUFF IS SO IN THAT SENSE SO IT DOES KIND OF MAKE SENSE YEAH
YEP THERE IT IS
AH THERE IT IS
'KAY THAT SHOULD BE IT
UM AND THAT WOULD HAVE SOME INTE IMPACT ON HOW Y I THINK MORE HOW YOU HOLD RATHER THAN UM THE ACTUAL USE USING THE THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE UM LIKE WE'VE SAID WE'VE DEFINED
LIKE WE ONLY WANT THE BASIC THINGS THAT TO BE VISIBLE AND THE REST OF THEM WE TRY TO HIDE
THESE ARE THE THREE THINGS THAT UM WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOU
UM I'M NOT VERY SURE ABOUT THE VOICE THING 'CAUSE I GOT ANOTHER EMAIL AND IT WAS IN FACT QUITE SKETCHY ON WHAT N THE VOICE OPTIONS ARE
UM IT SAID IT COULD TALK TO YOU BUT IT NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LISTEN
SO MAYBE IF YOU WELL I COULD SEE THE OTHER EMAIL THAT THEY SENT YOU
UM 'CAUSE THEY GOT BACK TO ME WITH LIKE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS OR DIFFERENT OFFERINGS OF WHAT COMPONENTS AVAILA
I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU THE COMPLEXITY AND THE COST THING AGAIN A BIT LATER
UM BUT UM I COULD CHECK BACK FOR YOU BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THEM IN A COMBINATION
BUT THE TITANIUM HAD A DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS ON THE SHAPE OF THE THING SO I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME RESTRICTION ON UM
I THINK WHATEVER IT IS YOU STILL NEED A BATTERY 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO KEEP DOING ONE THING
SO LIKE WHAT I SAID YOU PROBABLY NEED LIKE A BATTERY AND SOMETHING ELSE
UM AND THE KINETIC ONE I GUESS FOR ME IS THE MOST INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE IT'S MOVEMENT AND PEOPLE LIKE TO FIDDLE WITH THEIR AND IT'S A NICE SALES GIMMICK I THINK
UM SMALL AND SLIM I GUESS THAT'S MORE IN THE SENSE OF SMALL AND SLIM IN TERMS OF COMFORTABLE NOT SO SMALL YOU CAN'T
SO THAT'S AGAIN I DON'T THINK YOU CAN USE THEM IN A COMBINATION UM ESPECIALLY THE TITANIUM I I SUSPECT THEY'RE VERY FIXED TO A PARTICULAR NEED
ARE YOU THINKING ARE YOU THINKING OF OF A LIGHT IN THE SENSE OF UM A LIGHT LIGHT
OR A LIGHT IN THE SENSE OF IT GLOWS KIND OF YOU KNOW FRANKENSTEIN IT'S ALIVE
SO YOU COULD TRIGGER THAT TO A LIGHT LIKE I SAID THE BOUNCING BALL THING
OR YOU COULD TRIGGER THAT TO USE THAT TO POWER THE LIGHT AS OPPOSED TO SO WHEN THEY PICK IT UP
I THINK HE MADE THAT
IS THERE A PARTICULAR SHAPE THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
DOES IT NEED WITH A SQUARE THING WHA
PUTTING IN LIGHTS IS CHEAP BUT PUTTING IN AN L. C. D. PANEL JUST TO MAKE IT GLOW IS A BIT OF A
UM I I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S NO NEED FOR AN L. C. D. DISPLAY BUT UM IT'S WHAT'S WHAT WHAT WOULD IT TELL THE USER
'CAUSE THE L. C. D. TENDS TO BE AN OUTPUT AS UH AS OPPOSED TO AN INPUT SO UM DOES THE REMOTE CONTROL NEED TO TALK BACK TO THE USER
WE HAVE THE OPTION OF THE SPEAKER AS WELL THE SA THE SAME THING GOES FOR THE SPEAKER
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO TO TALK BACK
UM I THINK THAT THAT HAS SOME IMPACT ON ON ON MANY THINGS
NO LIKE I SAID WE HAVE A H HYBRID KIND OF THING SO IT'S NOT GONNA CHARGE THE BATTERY IT'S JUST
OR OR THERE MIGHT BE A LIGHT RUNNING THROUGH IT LIKE A MOUSE
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE CORDLESS MICE AND THEY DON'T EAT THAT MUCH POWER RIGHT
UM AND I DON'T THINK HAVING THAT YOU KNOW TOO QUICK TOO SLOW KIN IT'S CONFUSING TO THE I DUNNO
BUT USERS TEND TO TEND TO WANT TO USE THAT AND ONCE THEY LOSE OUT ON THE USER EXPERIENCE THEY'RE LIKE
THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE ONE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF UM IN TERMS OF WHETHER YOU'RE LEFT HANDED OR YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED YOU MIGHT BE LOCKING YOURSELF IN
YOU GOT TO CHOOSE FIRST
OKAY LEMME OKAY I'M GONNA PULL EVERYBODY OUT FIRST AND THEN PUT IN WHOEVER NEEDS TO BE LEFT
I'M GONNA TAKE THE MICROPHONES 'CAUSE IT'S TOO LAZY T TAKE THEM OFF AGAIN
IS IT WORKING
SO THEN THIS WE'RE LOOKING FOR UM SUGGESTIONS ON SIZE TH UM SIZE OF CONTROL AND THE BUTTONS
UM FOR INSTANCE THE STAND BY BUTTON ISN'T ALWAYS RED UH IT REALLY SHOULD BE
UM I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT BUT SOMETHING TO LOOK OUT FOR
UM THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT I'VE I'VE GOT COUPLE OF PREFERENCES FOR THE THE END CONTROL UM I GET 'EM WITH THE THE RED COLOUR BUTTON FOR STAND BY AND S THE OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT UM
THEY SHOULDN'T BE TINY LITTLE THINGS LIKE YOU GET ON SOME MOBILE PHONES
UM ONE OF THE EXAMPLES GIVEN ON THE HOMEPAGE WAS UM THERE'S AN UP AND DOWN VOLUME BUTTON BUT BOTH OF THEM HAVE A V. ON THEM
UM IF THE THE CORPORATE COLOUR SCHEME ALLOWS IT WE SHOULD HAVE A VERY BRIGHT COLOUR SO THAT IT CAN BE EASILY IDENTIFIED ANYWHERE
UM OBVIOUSLY TRYING TRYING TO AVOID BEING TACKY THERE BUT IT COULD UM TIE IN VERY EASILY WITH YOUR YOUR LIME AND LEMON IDEA
THEY SHOULDN'T BE ON THE UM SHOULDN'T BE VISIBLE WITHOUT SOMETHING BE OPENED OR SOME SORT OF SPECIAL EXTRA EFFORT
UM IF WE DID DECIDE TO GO FOR VOICE ACTIVATION THERE SH SHOULD ALWAYS BE A BUTTON AS ALTERNATIVE
AND THEY'VE SAID TH THE VOICE CONTROL UM CAN NOW TALK BACK IF YOU ASK IT A QUESTION
UM I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SLOGAN SHOULD GO OR REALLY WHAT THE SLOGAN IS
I MEAN YOU SAY YOU WANTED THE THE CORPORATE COLOURS BUT THEY DON'T SAY YOU KNOW IF WE CAN USE ANY OTHER COLOURS AT ALL OR
UM YOU COULD HAVE THE SAME SORT OF TEXTURE AND COLOUR AS A FRUIT
UM PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT S SITS IN YOUR HAND COMFORTABLY SORT OF FEELS RIGHT IN YOUR HAND
SEE I'M
UM SO A P SORT OF LARGER BIT SITS IN YOUR HAND AND THEN YOU GOT MAYBE ANOTHER BUBBLE AT THE TOP FOR JUST ANY OTHER FUNCTION YOU NEED
UM SOMETHING LIKE THAT UM YOU GOT TWO GROUPS THERE UM MAYBE IT COULD FOLD UP AND YOU GET A THIRD GROUP INSIDE OR UH YOU HAVE VOLUME CONTROLS ABOUT THERE
YOU TURN IT ON YOUR CONTROL POSSESSED S
WELL BUT THEN FOR UM FOR SKIPPING A LARGE AMOUNT OF CHANNELS YOU DO HAVE TO UH TO SKIP THE CHANNEL BUTTON THE NUMBER PART
OKAY LEMME JUST SEE WHERE I CAN FIND IT
UH BASICALLY WHAT I WANNA DO HERE BEFORE WE GET INTO IT UH TOO FAR
IS I WANT TO SHOW YOU ALL THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION I HAVE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IF WE WANT THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL
AND THEN SORT OF BRING US ALL TOGETHER INTO IT TO SEE SORTA SEE HOW THIS FITS IN WITH THE OVERALL VISION
AND THEN IDE IDENTIFY UH TRENDS THAT ARE ARE SORT OF IN SYNC AND ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR OUR UH P PROJECT PLAN THAT WE HAVE SO FAR
AND THEN UH INITIATE A KIND OF DISCUSSION ON DESIGN OPTIONS SO THAT IT SORTA HELPS US TO TO NARROW IN ON ON ASPECTS THAT WILL INFORM OTHER UH OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE OF THE PROJECT
OKAY SO OUT OF UM DIFFERENT UH FIGURES AND RATINGS OB UH OF PEOPLE IN GENERAL
UM CONSUMERS IN GENERAL THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WAS FOUND WAS THAT UH THE BR T TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL OKAY AND NOT IT SPECIFIED NOT A FUNCTIONAL LOOK OR OR FEEL UH B F F FANCY
NUMBER TWO WAS THAT IT BE INNOVATIVE
UH AND THIRD PRIORITY UH FOR EASE OF USE SO AGAIN THAT KIND OF GIVES US A GENERAL PICTURE OF HOW IT HAS TO BE
SO IT I'LL JUST SAY RIGHT AWAY AS A BIT OF A FORESHADOWING INTO HOW WE PROCEED WITH THIS IN TERMS OF M MARKETING
IS THAT I THINK UM WHAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IS HOW THE UM
ABOUT HOW THE INNOVATION UH CONTRIBUTES TO THE LOOK AND FEEL AND NOT SO MUCH TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT
FOR EXAMPLE LIKE WHEN YOU PICK IT UP AND PUSH IT LIKE IT ALL LIGHTS UP OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE
OR IT'S GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO IT THAT JUST SEEMS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE THING THAT THE MESSAGE HERE IS EASE OF USE
RESEARCH I HAVE HERE IS ON FASHION STYLE OKAY WHICH AS WE'VE AGREED IS A PRIORITY
OR WE GET RIGHT INTO IT OR WE COMPLETELY STEER AWAY FROM IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
SO MY MY FEELING IS THAT WE W DO WANT TO OBSERVE THIS TREND
UM 'CAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'RE IN WHAT WE'RE IN IS PARTLY SORT OF HOME DECOR PARTLY SOMETHING LIKE A COMPUTER
AND THEN IN TERMS OF M MATERIAL TRENDS ARE FOR THINGS TO BE SOFT AND SPONGY AND SORT OF YOU MIGHT SAY ERGONOMIC OR OR FRIENDLY TO HANDLE
SO THESE THIS IS THE SUMMARY OF EVERYTHING
UM STYLE IS NUMBER ONE UH THING IN THE IN THE MARKET OF WHO WE'RE SELLING TO
UH INNOVATIVE DESIGN TECHNOLOGY'S ALSO A MUST IN THAT IT'S SEEN IT'D BE SEEN TO BE UH CUTTING EDGE
UH BUT EASE OF USE T HAS TO BE INSURED THROUGHOUT
SO I'M THINKING IF WE IMAGINE THAT WE'RE TAKING SOME OF THE FEATURES OF A MAC IPOD AND WE'RE THEN MAKING IT S MORE OF LIKE A MORE OF LIKE A COMFORTABLE TYPE OF OR MORE OF LIKE A
UM AND THEN SO THIS IS W WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION WHAT I'M WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IN THIS SLIDE HERE IS THAT WE WE TAKE THESE IDEAS
AND AS WE GET INTO MORE THE MORE UM TECHNI LIKE SORT OF PRODUCTION SIDE OF THINGS
SO SO LIKE I THREW OUT A FEW IDEAS THERE JUST TO KINDA GET US THINKING ALONG THOSE LINES LIKE LEMON
'CAUSE I'M THINKING THAT SOME OF THESE IDEAS WILL SEEM QUITE COHERENT IF WE USE THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR WHAT PEOPLE ASSOCIATE THIS THEM WITH IN TERMS OF TEXTURE
LIKE UM THE ONES THE ONES WHICH I'M MOST FOND OF IN TERMS OF GIVING LIKE A THEME TO IT WOULD BE LIKE UM LIKE LEMON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WHICH IS LIKE YOU SEE A LOT IN IN OTHER AREAS
I'M THINKING MAYBE WE COULD INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE FEATURES INTO A FAIRLY UM INTO SOMETHING WHICH IS WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE SOMETHING TO IT WHICH IS ALMOST GIMMICKY BECAUSE LIKE UM LIKE SOMETHING TO DO WITH LIKE LIGHTING WITHIN IT
LIKE YOU KNOW JUST WITHIN THE SIMPLE SENSE WHEN YOU PICK UP A PHONE AND TOUCH A BUTTON IT UH LIGHTS UP Q USUALLY THE BUTTONS LIGHT UP
HOW CAN WE BUILD ON THAT
MAYBE LIKE IT COULD LIGHT UP IN DIFFERENT COLOURS OR SOMETHING OR OR PEOPLE COULD BUY THE BUY THE CONTROL AND THEN IT COMES WITH DIFFERENT LIKE
ANYWAY THOSE ARE THAT'S ALL I HAVE BUT UH HOPEFULLY WE CAN WE CAN REVISIT THOSE IDEAS WHEN WE GET INTO
CAN WE UH POWER A LIGHT IN THIS
CAN WE GET A STRONG ENOUGH BATTERY TO POWER A LIGHT
SO MAYBE ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN JUST TRY AND INCLUDE IS A REALLY GOOD BATTERY
AND TO MAKE THAT TO MAKE THAT A REALISTIC GOAL I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WILL COME UP LATER IS CAN THE BATTERY POWER IT
WELL M I'M THINKING ALONG THE LINES OF YOU'RE YOU'RE IN THE DARK WATCHING A D. V. D. AND YOU UM YOU FIND THE THING IN THE DARK AND YOU GO LIKE THIS
OH WHERE'S THE VOLUME BUTTON IN THE DARK AND UH Y YOU JUST TOUCH IT OR YOU JUST PICK IT UP AND IT LIGHTS UP OR SOMETHING
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO PUT IN A REALLY GOOD BATTERY SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO CHARGE THEIR R REMOTE CONTROL EVERY FEW DAYS
AND IF WE THINK THAT WHAT WE ARE W OUR NUMBER ONE MARKETING MOTIVE IS UM THE LOOK AND FEEL
THEN WE SHOULD HAVE IT KIND OF COME BACK TO ONE THING THAT WE KIND OF ALL SORTA CAN VISUALIZE
UM MAYBE WHAT WE COULD DO IS T TH THINK ABOUT A CONCEPT WHICH TOUCHES B BACK TO THE ON THE UM THE COLOUR YOU SAID COMPANY COLOUR YELLOW
WHAT CAN WE COME UP WITH SOMETHING WHERE WE WE TRY AND ASSOCIATE IT WITH WITH LIKE THE SERIES
WE JUST COME UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE KIND OF USE IT AS A THEME TO INSPIRE THE
WHAT IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SO AND THEN WE HAVE ONE ONE SORTA THEME THAT WE STICK WITH
UM CAN WE YEAH LIKE TO AND WHA LIKE DO YOU HAVE A
CAN YOU LIKE YEAH JUST T WE CAN VISUALIZE IT
WHAT WOULD IT ACHIEVE
L. C. WELL I'D WHEN YOU USED TO MENTION THE L. C. D. I'D THINK I WONDER WHAT THAT WOULD BE ABOUT
AND THE TH THE THING I COULD SEE IT HELPING WITH WOULD BE IF IT WAS SOMEHOW CONNECTED WITH UM LISTINGS
SO AS YOU SCROLL THROUGH 'CAUSE WE SAID WE MIGHT HAVE A JOG DIAL
SO AS YOU SCROLL THROUGH YOUR STATIONS YOU CAN Y IT ACTUALLY TELLS YOU WHAT IT IS
I MEAN JUST IT'S JUST WORTH POINTING OUT BECAUSE LIKE I'VE I'VE KNOWN I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE TO HAVE KINETIC WATCHES THAT THEY WEAR ALL THE TIME
AND IT'S JUST LIKE MAGIC BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS POWERED AND THERE'S NO BATTERY
I'VE ALSO KNOWN PEOPLE TO HAVE THINGS LIKE LIKE A JEWELLERY WATCH THEY WEAR FROM TIME TO TIME
AND THEY EVENTUALLY JUST SAY IT'S JUST TOO MUCH OF A NUISANCE BECAUSE I DON'T WEAR IT ALL THE TIME
LIKE REMOTE CONTROL IS SIMILAR YOU'RE AWAY ON VACATION I DUNNO WHATEVER YOU SOMETHING AND IT JUST STARTS TO GET WORN DOWN
UM BUT WE ARE LEANING QUITE A BIT TO THE SIDE OF BEING LOW TECH RUBBER BUTTONS PLASTIC FRAME
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE'RE REPRODUCING THE SAME OLD REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S OUT THERE
SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING THIS HIGH TECH USER FRIENDLY UH UM THEME LIKE WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE U WE'RE USING TO TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS
UM AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT WE WE'RE S WE'VE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO ACHIEVING IS SIMPLICITY
AND SO I'M THINKING MAYBE SHOULD WE TRY AND THINK ABOUT HAVING SOMETHING LIKE UM SOME KIND OF AN INNOVATIVE CONCEPT ABOUT HOW THE UM THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNELS ARE CONTROLLED
BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO GO PUSH THE BUTTON
IT'S SMALL AND THAT WE'VE GOT LIKE THE THE L SLOGAN SOMEWHERE LIKE ON THE CASING AT THE SIDE
AND THAT YEAH WELL I MEAN ISN'T THAT WHAT WE JUST H SAID SAID WE S JUST HAVE TO DECIDE NOW
YEAH I THINK THE JOG DIAL YOU KNOW IT JUST AFTER YOU DREW THAT WHAT IF IT WAS FLAT AND YOU JUST SPUN IT THAT'D BE GREAT
AND I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY AND STAY AWAY FROM JUST THE BIG PROTRUDING RUBBER BUTTONS 'CAUSE THAT'D JUST BE SO STANDARD
SO THAT IT HAS AND ALSO T PLASTIC I'VE SEEN CAN GET REALLY TEXTURED SO YOU CAN GET PLASTICS THAT ACTUALLY FEEL SOFT IN YOUR HAND
SO UM JUST FROM FROM LAST TIME TO RECAP WE SAID WE WERE GONNA HAVE A SNOWMAN SHAPED REMOTE CONTROL WITH NO L. C. D. DISPLAY NO NEED FOR TALK BACK
SO IF THIS ISN'T TO SCALE WHAT KIND OF
OKAY SO JUST COULD YOU JUST LIST ALL THE THINGS THAT IT DOES S SO I CAN WRITE THEM IN THE REPORT
OH OH LIKE DEPTH OF THE ACTUAL THING
OH IS THIS K TO GET AN IDEA OF SCALE FROM YOUR FROM YOUR THING THERE OKAY
WELL OF THE DESIGNERS WHAT ARE THEY
UH D CAN YOU CHANGE ANY OF THOSE AT ALL
OKAY IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL IT CAN DO
THE EXCEL SHEET AND PRICE LISTING AND SEE IF WE NEED TO
IS THERE ANY RUBBER AT ALL IN THE BUTTONS OR ANY
SO I'LL HAVE TO PUT THAT OH NO WAIT WE HO HOW MANY COLOURS HAVE WE GOT THERE
OKAY RIGHT SO WE'RE WRITING DOWN FOUR
HOW ABOUT THESE
ARE WE WANTING THEM IN NO THEY'RE JUST IS EVERYTHING GONNA BE PLASTIC
WELL WE H SOMETHING HAS TO GO TO THE TUNE OF TWO POINT T THREE EURO
SO LET ME SEE WHAT ARE WE I MEAN OH YES SORRY FOUR POINT THREE
MY MATHS IS ALL OUT
ONE
UM AND WE HA WHERE ARE THE FOUR THE FOUR PUSH BUTTONS ARE WHERE EXACTLY NOW
LIKE IS IS THAT ONE BIG BUTTON OR IS IT TWELVE BUTTONS HOW CAN IT BE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN
AH
AH
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE L. C. D. ANYMORE AND WE'LL JUST GONNA HAVE AN ON T ON THE T. V. IT'LL SHOW YOU WHAT YOU'RE DOING
SO JUST TO WELL TO BE THOROUGH THEN WIDTH WISE WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT WHAT THREE CENTIMETRES OR SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT BIG
ABOUT TWO CENTIMETRES OKAY
OKAY WE'LL S WE'LL SAY TWO POINT FIVE
OKAY UM SO WE HAVE IT WITHIN COST ANYWAY
SO AT THIS POINT WE UH LET ME SEE DISCUSS UH HOW SATISFIED WE ALL ARE WITH UM
WITH THESE FOUR POINTS WITH THE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY IN THE PROJECT AND LEADERSHIP AND TEAMWORK AND THE STUFF WE HAD AROUND US I GUESS
UM LET ME SEE UH
I WASN'T ENTIRELY SURE WHAT UH WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THAT BUT Y YOU GO FOR IT
OH THERE IT IS
I'D GO WITH THREE OR FOUR MAYBE THREE
YEAH ABOUT THREE OKAY
GONNA HAVE THAT ON THE SIDE AREN'T WE LIKE THERE OR SOMETHING
UH YEAH
SO YEAH AB WELL YEAH ABOUT SIXTY NINE SEVENTY PERCENT YEAH
IS THAT YOU ALL HAVE ALL FINISHED OR
THE UM EVALUATION CRITERIA OR AM I
I DON'T KNOW JUST UM YOUR OPINION ON THOSE FOUR THOSE FOUR POINTS REALLY AND HOW WE USED THEM
BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT MEANS THE ROOM AS IN THIS ROOM
SO STILL ON THE TOPIC OF ROOM FOR CREATIVITY UH NEXT UP IS CRAIG
DID UH DID YOU GUYS GET THE EMAIL I SENT YOU
I WAS WONDERING IF THAT GOT THERE OKAY
OKAY UM SO UM TO S TO TO SUMMARIZE THE TEAMWORK ISSUE SAYING THAT IF WE COULD COMMUNICATE OUTSIDE THE MEETING
YOU KNOW JUST LIKE QUICK QUESTIONS QUICK THOUGHTS WHATEVER IT PROBABLY WOULD BE BIT EASIER
OKAY UM WHAT ABOUT THE YOU KNOW HOW WE USED THE WHITEBOARD THE DIGITAL PENS THE PROJECTOR STUFF LIKE THAT
UM DID ANYBODY THINK ANYTHING WAS LIKE REALLY USEFUL ANYTHING WAS PRETTY UN F
AND POINT AT
AH
SO DO YOU THINK PRODUCING A PROTOTYPE EARLIER IN THE PROCESS WOULDA BEEN A GOOD IDEA
I KNOW I THINK AT THE VERY START OF TODAY I LIKE WROTE A WHOLE LOAD OF STUFF
DIDN'T CLICK NOTE ON ONE THEN WENT BACK AND WROTE ONE TINY WEE THING ON THE ANOTHER PAGE
I KNOW I I LIKE TO HAVE THINGS WRITTEN DOWN IN FRONT OF ME ACTUALLY
LIKE A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT WAS EMAILED TO ME I ENDED UP YOU KNOW LIKE WRITING DOWN THERE OR SOMETHING SO I COULD LOOK AT IT REALLY QUICKLY AND NOT HAVE THE DISTRACTION OF ALL OF THAT
UM WHAT ELSE UH ANY WH I DO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY SAY NEW IDEAS FOUND
UM I DON'T KNOW IS COULD YOU THINK OF LIKE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TODAY AT ALL
I REALLY THI I I THINK MAYBE IF WE'D LIKE ALL BEEN WORKING IN THE ONE ROOM
AND THEY JUST SAID YOU KNOW LIKE EVERY HOUR OR SOMETHING EVERYBODY MAKE SURE YO YOU KNOW JUST HAVE A HAVE A SHORT MEETING AND THEN JUST C JUST TO HAVE LIKE SOMETHING WRITTEN DOWN
THIN OH THERE IT I FIVE MINUTES TO GO
AND IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED YES IT IS
WELL APPARENTLY NOW I WRITE THE FINAL REPORT
SO IS THAT J IS THAT JUST IS THAT JUST A LOGO OR DOES IT DO ANYTHING
OH NO THAT'S COOL IT'S GOT I'M KIND OF I'M SLIGHTLY GUTTED THAT WE COULDN'T GET PLASTIC AND RUBBER I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE
AH WELL MAYBE FROM NOW ON REAL REACTION SHOULD GIVE US MORE MONEY
PLAY DOH S
YEAH UM SO TO WHA WHAT ARE YOUR SUMMARISING WORDS ABOUT PLAY DOH
YEAH YEAH IF THE MEETING'S OVER THEN YEAH I GUESS SO
AND THERE ISN'T UH D IT DOESN'T OPEN UP TO THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS
SO THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS ARE STILL HIDDEN FROM YOU BUT THEY'RE HIDDEN IN THE SENSE THAT UM THEY'RE NOT IN USE
IT MIGHT EVEN BE ONE A BIT MORE COMPLEX L. C. D. PANEL WITH PICTURES LIKE MAYBE THE SUN OR THE
UM THEY'RE AL ALONG THIS YEAH
YOU HAVE THIS SPACE HERE AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS THING ON THE SIDE AS WELL OR AT THE BOTTOM
'CAUSE SLOGANS ARE USUALLY QUITE SMALL RIGHT THEY'RE NOT LIKE HUGE SO THEY'RE S
YEP SO THAT WOULD BE ABOUT A CENTIMETRE FOR A BUTTON SO ONE TWO THREE
SIX SEVEN EIGHT ABOUT YEAH NINE TOTAL
OH WE'VE DISCUSSED HOW H HIGH IT IS BUT HOW WIDE IS IT
NO AS IN THE HEIGHT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WIDTH
I DON'T THINK FIVE IS BE ABOUT TH THREE AND A HALF
ARE YOU HAVING A V. C. R. ARE YOU HAVING YOU KNOW WHICH INPUT DO YOU HAVE
UM A LOT OF THESE THINGS WILL HAVE TO BE UM FREE AND OPEN FOR USERS TO DEFINE THEM
AUDIO WE HAVE LIKE YOUR BASIC Y YOUR BASE YOUR MID RANGE YOUR HIGH RANGE
WE NEED AN
SO THE USER COULD BE LOOKING AT THE T. V. AND PUSHING HIS THING SO WE MAY NOT NEED TO SO WHEN WE SCROLL WE NEED JUST SOME WAY TO GET THE T. V. TO RESPOND
WHICH I THINK IS A TECHNICALLY DOABLE THING SO
FUNCTIONALLY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO INTERCEPT SO FOUR IS A GOOD ESTIMATE FOR
YEAH SO YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY CUT IT'S LIKE THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS FOUR EIGHT TWELVE
WE JUST REPORT THAT IT HAS TO BE OVER BUDGET OR THE COLOURS YOU COULD TAKE AWAY S COLOURS FOR TH FOR THE BUTTONS
THAT'S THE BUTTONS ONLY REFER TO THE PAD SO
UM SO THEN THESE JUST BECOME NORMAL COLOURED BUTTONS SO THAT MIGHT BE SOME SOME WAY OF CUTTING THE COST
SO THERE'S ONE MORE DIMENSION TO THE THING WHICH WE NEED TO TO ADD
BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO THAT FACTOR OF IF IT'S TOO UNFAMILIAR THEN UM BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SHELF
NO THE POWER CORD ITSELF
JUST IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING WHY IS HE STILL PLAYING WITH THE PLAY DOH
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE CAGED WITHIN WHATEVER Y IT'S LIKE A BALLOON IN A CAGE IT CAN ONLY GO SO BIG AND NOT HIT THE SIDE
I THINK ANOTHER POINT IS THAT THE MEETINGS UM ARE MORE BRAINSTORMING SESSIONS THAN MEETINGS SO TIME IS ALSO A VERY S UM STRONG FACTOR AND STRUCTURE
BECAUSE FOR A BRAINSTORMING MEETING YOU WANT A STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ALLOWS IDEAS TO GET TOSSED
AND I GUESS THAT POINT ABOUT THE ROOM NOT BEING R VERY FRIENDLY TO THAT I THINK THAT'S A VERY BIG THING
NOT NOT SO MUCH AN ATMOSPHERE THE ATMOSPHERE IS VERY RELAXED
LIKE A CONSENSUS RIGHT WE GO AROUND AND WE THINK ABOUT IT
BUT UM IT JUST COMES BACK TO US SO SLOW IN THE EMAIL UM IT IT DOESN'T HAVE A YOU KNOW A MESSENGER WILL GO
I THINK THE TOOLS THAT THEY WERE GIVEN THE TOOL SET THAT WERE GIVEN TO US ARE FANCY BUT THEY DON'T SUPPORT COLLABORATION I THINK THAT'S THE WORD
I THINK UM THE THE FOCUS OF IT A LOT WAS THE POWERPOINT AS OPPOSED TO THE TO THE WHITEBOARD
AND I THINK THAT M UM IS ALSO DOES YOU KNOW HINDER US AND THINGS I THINK
IT WILL BE COOLER TO HAVE THE WHITEBOARD RATHER THAN THE THE POWERPOINT
SEE IT LOOKS LIKE HOMER SIMPSON
OH I DID LEARN SOMETHING NEW PLAY DOH IS USEFUL
IT IS USEFUL AND IN IN IN IN IN IN IN UM CONCEPTUALIZING IN BEING CREATIVE
NO ALL PLAY DOH IS EDIBLE
IT'S JUST WHEAT IT'S THE STUFF THAT YOUR MOM COULD MAKE WITH PRESERVATIVES AND UH
I THINK THAT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT IT STARTS TO POP UP WHEREAS ON A PIECE OF PAPER ON A COMPUTER ON A BOARD
UH OH
WELL WE WANT THE OTHER BUTTONS TO BE BIG ENOUGH TO PUSH EASILY WITH A FINGER SO WE RECKON MAYBE THAT'LL BE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
WE'RE GONNA USE IT AS UH IT CAN BE THE POWER BUTTON IF YOU HOLD IT FOR MAYBE TWO SECONDS IT'LL SEND A STAND BY SIGNAL
UM APART FROM THAT IT'S GONNA BE USED AS A CONFIRM BUTTON FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND YOU USE THIS AS A JOG DIAL
SOMETHING BY THERE
BUT UM BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE THE L. C. D. AND THE JOG DIAL WE JUST THOUGHT WE'D UM USE THAT AS THE VOLUME
UM YOU CAN USE IT FOR UM MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS LIKE CONTRAST COLOUR AND
UM JUST WHATEVER ELSE WE WANTED TO INCLUDE AS THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS UM WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY GO THROUGH AND SPECIFY THE
WELL WE COULD TAKE OUT ONES BY MAKING IT SINGLE CURVED JUST FILL IN THOSE BITS
THAT IS ONE
YEAH W
I THINK THERE'S JUST ONE BUTTON SO HANDY
YOU SEE I ENVISION IT AS BEING UM QUITE DEEP SORT OF DEEP ENOUGH TO BE COMFY TO HOLD IN YOUR HANDS RATHER THAN BEING WIDE AND FLAT
SEE ABOUT THAT THICK
IS IT
AH OKAY SO YEAH TWO OR THREE
YEAH ONE
YEAH WELL WE HAVE TO USE UH PLASTIC SO IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE
UM I AGREE WITH HIS POINT IT'S UM IT IS QUITE A LOT OF FUN T TO GO AND THEN YOU HAVE SORT OF HIT THE END THEN GO RIGHT
OH THEY'RE A BIT CLUNKY
IS THIS FOR THE PROJECT OR
GUESS I'D FORGOT HOW GOOD S PLAY DOH SMELLS
I THINK THEY'RE ALL NON TOXIC 'CAUSE IT'S AIMED FOR LIKE TWO YEAR OLDS
AH RIGHT
OKAY SO THE NUMBER PAD IS 'KAY GREAT
ABOUT NINE IN TOTAL
SO THAT WOULD BE THAT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GOOD SIZE IF YOU SEE IT THERE
IS IT POSSIBLE UH I'M JUST GONNA BRING UP THE IDEA OF COLOURS
IS THESE ARE THESE THE COLOURS THAT OF PRODUCTION OR IS THIS JUST WHAT WE HAD AVAILABLE
THREE AND A HALF
AUDIO
UH HOW MM-HMM HOW ARE WE GOING TO ACHIEVE THIS HIGH END PRODUCT IF
WAS THE GOAL IN YOUR IN YOUR PROTOTYPE DESIGN THAT IT BE AS LOW PROFILE AS POSSIBLE
MAYBE CLOSER TO THREE EVEN OR TWO AND A HALF
AND THEY HAVE IT SORT OF STYLIZED OR IN DIFFERENT CONCEPT THAT THAT
DO YOU WANT ME TO D UM
OKAY SO WHAT THIS IS IS A SET UP FOR US TO UM UH USE A KIND OF A LIKE A
AND USED THAT AS A CRITERIA OF EVALUATION FOR THE UM UH FOR THE CURRENT DESIGN UH TH OR THE PLAN AND UH SO WE CAN REVIEW THAT
UH I THINK IT'S GONNA END UP BEING SORT OF ELEMENTARY BECAUSE WE'RE SORT WE'RE IN N WE'RE NOT GONNA PROBABLY USE IT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BUT
SO TO SORT OF B BRING TOGETHER TWO THINGS SORT OF DESIGN GOALS AND ALSO THE MARKET RESEARCH THAT WE HAD UH WHEN WE RATE THIS
ONE IS V HIGH IN IN SUCCEEDING OR FITTING TO OUR ORIGINAL AIM AND SEVEN IS LOW OKAY
SO THESE I THESE I TH ARE THE AND UM WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO UH TO COLLECTIVELY RATE THIS
SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS TRY AND JUST Y WORK ON A CONSENSUS SYSTEM SO
WE JUST COME TO AN AGREEMENT
YEAH UM ME UH MY ONLY RESERVATION WITH IT WAS THAT WE BASICALLY WENT WITH YELLOW BECAUSE IT'S THE COMPANY'S COLOUR
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YELLOW'S GONNA REALLY BE A HIT
FI OH UH JUST ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE
THE SO IT MEANT THREE OKAY
OKAY THREE
SORTA
OKAY AND UM DESIGN IS SIMPLE TO USE SIMPLE IN FEATURES
F F YEAH F FAIRLY BASIC YOU GUYS THINK
YEAH ONE
COULD WE HAVE USED AN ENTIRELY RUBBER FRAME TO IT
WAS THAT AN OPTION
WE ARE AT UH TWO SEVEN EIGHT TEN FIFTEEN POINT FIVE
I THINK 'CAUSE IF YOU TURN THAT INTO
IT WOULD BE ABOUT
ABOUT THIRTY ONE AND THEN INVERT THAT IT'S
YEP OH HUNDRED POUND PEN
I DID HAVE ONE OTHER UM ONE OTHER FRAME I THOUGHT I MEAN I I D NOT KNOWING HOW WE WOULD DEAL WITH THIS INFORMATION
I THOUGHT OKAY IN THEORY THIS KIND OF A PROCESS WOULD BE ABOUT REFINING OUR DESIGN REVISITING OUR ORIGINAL GOALS
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I NEED TO P PUSH THROUGH BUT I THOUGHT SHOULD WE THINKING MORE ABOUT THE DIMENSIONS
I DUNNO THE WHATEVER JUST SOME THEME AND THEN WE HAVE DIFFERENT TONES LIME GREEN LEMON
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE ORIGINALLY SET OUT TO DO
UM YEP SO THERE
TO USE
SURE UM SO WHAT IS IT YOU'RE ASKING OF ME NOW
WELL IS IT UH OKAY I'LL JUST GO THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM THEN
THE THE ROOM UH
IS FAIRLY INSTITUTIONAL BUT UM THE MAIN THING IS I THINK
UM OUR USE OF THIS SPACE IS MORE JUST TO REPORT ON THINGS AS OPPOSED TO BE CREATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE AND IT WOULD PROBABLY HELP TO UM HAVE L SORT OF A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF WE HAVE IDEAS AND WE COME BACK AND THEN THE IDEAS ARE STILL IN DISCUSSION
YOU KNOW AS IN OTHER WORDS THIS THIS ROOM IS SORT OF A CENTRE POINT OF CREATIVITY
YEAH YEAH BUT THAT'S JUST THE THING IS THE QUEST IN TERMS OF THE THE FIRST POINT THERE THE ROOM
AND THEN WE COME HERE AND THEN WE KIND OF PUT OUT OUR IDEAS AND THEN YOU KNOW
NO OF COURSE YEAH
YEAH I TH OKAY ON TH UM YEAH DIF ANSWERING THE QUESTION UH IN THOSE TERMS I'D SAY THAT ACTUALLY THERE'S SORT OF A TEASE OF CREATIVITY BECAUSE WE'RE ASKED TO WORK THROUGH THIS
SAY FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COLOUR SCHEME BUT THEN I THEN WE'RE TOLD OKAY USE THE CO COMPANY COMPANY COLOURS
YEAH WELL WELL I MEAN MY SENSE ON THAT IS SORT OF WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION ENCOURAGEMENT
AND SO IT IS LEADERSHIP ALMOST TO THE POINT OF SORT OF DISEMPOWERING THE THE THE TEAM MEMBER SO
BUT IT'S NOT BAD LEADERSHIP IT'S JUST SORT OF S FAIRLY STRONG YOU KNOW
IT TURNS IT TURNS THE INDIVIDUAL INTO MORE OF LIKE A UM SORT OF A PREDETERMINED MECHANISM AS OPPOSED TO A SORT OF A FREE
YEAH OH YEAH WITHOUT WITHOUT A DOUBT
YEAH IN IT
W THE WAY I SEE THIS I IS THAT IT'S UH THE THE S THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH WE'VE WE'VE APPROACHED THIS WHOLE TASK IS QUITE CONTRARY TO THE P PRINCIPLE OF TEAMWORK BECAUSE THE THE TASKS WERE D D SORT OF UM DIVIDED
AND THEN THE WORK WENT ON IN ISOLATION I I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS DID WHILE YOU WERE TOGETHER MAYBE THAT WAS A BIT DIFFERENT
BUT UM YEAH BUT UM BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU IF YOU IMAGINE NOT ENTIRE THE COMPLETELY SAME TASK GIVEN TO US BUT US SAID OKAY
TO S TO SAY OKAY GO OFF AND DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER IT'S ACTUALLY P SORT OF PREDISPOSES YOU TO QUITE THE CONTRARY OF TEAMWORK
BUT IT'S UM NOT QUITE AS USEFUL AS TO US AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN MAYBE JUST IN THE WAY THAT WE WE USE IT
IN THE SENSE THAT ONCE WE HAVE AN IDEA OUT THERE OR WHILE WORK WAS GOING ON IN BETWEEN MEETINGS
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN UP ON A BOARD UH YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO IN LIKE IN TEXT
UM AND THEN WE COULD THEN KEEP OUR IDEAS SORT OF BUILDING ON THAT
BUT THEY USE IT AS A KIND OF A CONTEXT TO SORT OF WALK AROUND AND PUZZLE AND AND POINT AND DISCUSS AND AND AND IN A WAY EVERYBODY'S AS WE DISCUSS THINGS IN THE IN THEORETICALLY AND OUT OF OUR NOTEBOOKS
LIKE AT ONE POINT I PEEKED ACROSS AND LOOKED AT CRAIG'S PAPER AND I'M LIKE NOW I KNOW WHAT HE'S THINKING 'CAUSE I SAW HIS BOOK
YEAH BECAUSE THE POWERPOINT WAS PROVIDED TO US WHILE WE HAD TIME TO PREPARE WHEREAS I CAN IMAGINE IF I'D BEEN ENCOURAGED TO USE PAINTBRUSH
FOR EXAMPLE OR WHATEVER I WOULD'VE ACTUALLY USED IT UM 'CA YOU KNOW
JUST 'CAUSE THAT'S SORTA HOW WE WHAT WE WERE SET UP TO TO USE WHILE WE HAD OUR TIME
IF THERE HAD BEEN A FIFTH THAT COULDA JUST BEEN SITTING THERE READY TO GO THE WHOLE TIME
NA IN A NATURAL F CONTEXT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED BY THIS NECESSITY TO DISCOMMUNICATE OURSELVES FROM EACH OTHER
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF S HARD TO KEEP F WORKING FORWARD ON A TEAM A TEAM BASED PROJECT WHEN WHEN YOU'RE TOLD YOU MUST NOW WORK AWAY FROM YOUR TEAM
TASTE
DO WE RETREAT TO OUR TO CONTINUE OUR
RIGHT MY NAME'S ADAM DUGUID WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF REAL REACTION UM WE HAVE IN THE GROUP
UM YEAH GO FOR IT MATE
T. R. I. K.
AS YOU CAN SEE W OPENING ACQUAINTANCE TOOL TRAINING PROJECT PLAN DISCUSSION AND CLOSING
UM WE ALREADY GOT N THROUGH OPENING AND PARTIALLY THROUGH ACQUAINTANCE
SO THE REASON WE'RE HERE WE'RE GONNA DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL AS YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW
BUT UH PERSONALLY I THINK THAT THE ORIGINAL IS GONNA BE A VERY KEY ASPECT TO THIS DESIGN
UM THERE'S A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS OUT THERE ANYWAY SO WE'RE GONNA NEED SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY GONNA SET IT APART
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE THREE KAY PHASES AS YOU'VE PROBABLY ALREADY BEEN TOLD THE FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURAL AND THE DETAILED DESIGN
SECOND SEEMS TO BE CONCEPTUAL COMPONENTS PROPERTIES MATERIALS AND THE LAST ONE IS A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF OUR DESIGN SO FAR
OF COURSE YOU'VE ALL GOT THE SIMILAR EMAILS I BELIEVE RIGHT
OH UM YOU CAN CLIP THEM TO YOUR BELT
HARDLY WHAT I'D CALL THE BEST DRAWING IN THE WORLD BUT IT'LL DO FOR NOW
THEY'RE SNOTTY AS HELL AT THE BEST OF TIMES AND UH WHAT CAN YOU SAY YOU GOT TO LOVE THOSE QUALITIES IN AN ANIMAL
I THINK WE'VE ALL MANAGED TO MASTER THE WHITEBOARD THERE BY LOOKS OF IT SO ON TO IT
AS YOU CAN SEE TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS PER UNIT
NOW WE BETTER ACTUALLY JUST GET ON WITH THE UH THE MEAT OF THE PROJECT
WOULD THE THE IDEA SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF ONE ON BUTTON WOULD TURN ON SAY THE VIDEO RECORDER
THE T. V. MAYBE THE SOUND SYSTEM AS WELL ALL IN ONE GO IS THAT KIND OF
ANY TAKES ON THIS
UM ALRIGHT AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE GOT THIRTY MINUTES UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING SO WE'LL HAVE TO TRY AND DECIDE ON SOME OF THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
HAS ANYBODY GOT ANYTHING THEY'D LIKE TO ADD AT THIS STAGE ANYTHING THEY THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISSED SO FAR
IN FACT EVEN THE MOBILE PHONES THESE DAYS ARE BEGINNING TO USE THEM AS WELL SO IT'S PROBABLY AN INTERFACE THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE USED TO
AND THAT COULD ALLOW N EASY NAVIGATION USED AS A JOYSTICK AS WELL
I'D SAY WE FINISH THIS ONE UP WE GET STARTED I'LL GET IN
I'LL WRITE UP WHAT WE'VE UM KIND OF QUICKLY DONE AND I'LL GET THAT OUT TO EVERYBODY
UM AS FAR AS I'M AWARE WE LEAVE THE MICROPHONES HERE UM UNLESS WE GET TOLD OTHERWISE AND JUST TAKE THE LAPTOPS WITH US
T. A. R. I. K.
DO WE TAKE THEM OFF
AH HA
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE CLIPPED AS WELL
UH
AND UH THEY'RE JUST THE MOST FEARED OF OF UH ANIMALS IN THE WILD
DIDN'T SAY AN ANYTHING ABOUT ME REALLY BUT
LIKE UH CONTROL PADS YOU KNOW OF GAMES BUT OR IS THAT A BIT RIDICULOUS
UH DAVE COCHRANE
THE ONE F UH IN FACT THIS IS A SOMEWHAT OBLIQUE REFERENCE IN FACT TO UH WELL MY I HAVE A THREE UH THREE Y YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO H WHO WHO WHO IS AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS MISS MONKEY
AND I MEAN FR AND FROM UH FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SORT OF THE STUDY OF HUMAN EVOLUTION THEY AND OTHER PRIMATES ARE TERRIBLY INTERESTING
AND AND TH TH TH TH THI THI THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE PERHAPS MORE ATTITUDE THAN MOST
WELL ONE THING I'M AWARE OF IS
TH THERE UH UM AT THE SORT OF V VERY HIGH PRICE END OF THE MARKET THERE'S THERE'S A EM EMERGING MARKET FOR SORT OF TOUCH SCREEN L. C. D. REMOTES THAT CAN BE UH PROGRAMMED IN M MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED WAYS THAN SORT OF CONVENTIONAL MODELS
AND YOU GET A MUCH GREATER DEGREE UM UM I MEAN YOU GET IN THESE SORT OF THREE IN ONE FIVE IN ONE WHATEVERS
AND YOU CAN HAVE ONE UH YOU KNOW ONE MACRO TO TURN THE UH YOU KNOW TURN THE T. V. TO THE RIGHT CHANNEL
GET THE UH RE UH REWIND THE TAPE IN THE V. C. R. AND GET IT TO PLAY ONCE IT'S REWOUND FOR INSTANCE
UM B IT OCCURS TO ME THERE MIGHT BE A NICHE FOR UH FOR A REMOTE THAT AIMED TOWARDS SOME OF THAT SORT OF FUNCTIONALITY BUT USING A JUST CONVENTIONAL PUSH BUTTON DESIGN
SOME AND IDEALLY SOMETHING INTO WHICH IT WOULD HAVE SOME AT LEAST LIMITED FACILITY FOR UM RUNNING MACROS
FOR INSTANCE UM LET'S SAY OH OH UM
OR UM YOU KNOW YOU PR UH YOU PRESS UH SAY THE PLAY BUTTON FOR THE D. V. D. PLAYER AND IT TURNS THE T. V. ON AND ONTO THE RIGHT CHANNEL AS WELL
THE OTHER KEY FEATURE THAT UH THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BUILT INTO IT IS T IS IS TO MAKE SOMETHING YOU KNOW FAIRLY SORT OF ERGONOMIC
UH WHICH IT WOULD NEED TO BE TO SORT OF CONFORM TO THE SHAPE OF THE HAND MORE EFFICIENTLY ANYWAY
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SPELL THAT
S
S OKAY
FIRST POINT BEGINS WITH AN E. SAME LIKE EBENEZER
OH OH I THINK YOU GA
OH THAT'S GOOD WE CAN CLIP THEM ON
OH THAT WAS PROFITING THAT WAS AN AMOUNT SO THAT'S THE AMOUNT MADE OKAY
SO PERHAPS ONE THAT WAS MORE UM
YOU SIMPLY STRI SLIDE A BAR TO SAY WHAT TIME IT BEGINS AND SLIDE ANOTHER BAR TO SAY WHAT TIME IT ENDS YOU KNOW THAT'S
Y YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE UH REALLY CLEVER TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL
NO ON THE DESKTOP YOU'LL FIND YOU SHOULD FIND THAT THERE'S A PROJECT DOCUMENTS LINK
HOPEFULLY THAT'S US READY TO UH TO GO
DUE FOR UH TIME TO MARKET AND POSSIBLY ALSO COST ISSUES
UM ALSO KEY IS THE CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD STAY RECOGNISABLE UM F UH YOUR COLOUR AND SLOGAN OF COURSE IS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM THERE
SO TO THE POINT IN MY OPINION ANYWAY THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE WORTH PURSUING
UM I'D LIKE TO IF POSSIBLE HEAR FROM OUR MARKETING EXPERT FIRST TO HELP US GAIN AN IDEA OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO
UH
IS YOURS THE
IF YOU DO YOU WANT ME TO JUST CYCLE THROUGH IT FOR YOU OR
SOR IF YOU COULD SPEED IT UP A BIT YEAH
HEAR FROM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER NOW I THINK MIGHT BE AN IDEA
UM YOU'VE GOT YOUR PRESENTATION NOW IS IT ON THE IS IT
IF YOU LOOK ON THE DESKTOP YOU'LL FIND THAT THERE'S A LINK TO THE PROJECT FOLDER OR PROJECT DOCUMENTS
ARE YOU FINDING IT OKAY OR
AH DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT AT ALL MATE
ARE YOU IS IT YEAH
UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE THAT THERE'S FAIRLY ROBUST SERVICES ON UH COMPUTERS VIA UH VIA VOICE I. B. M. DO UM DRAG AND DICTATE
BUT THESE REQUIRE A LOT OF MEMORY AND USUALLY UM STATE QUITE ADVANCED PROCESSOR REQUIREMENTS
WELL LITERALLY UM IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DISPLAY MAYBE SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN UM THOSE ON A A MOBILE PHONE
SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN READ AN AN UM FAIR AMOUNT OF INFORMATION
TRAVERSE MAYBE QUITE A FEW MENUS IF WE MAYBE USED MOBILE PHONES AS A GOOD EXAMPLE THEY USUALLY INCORPORATE THEY HAVE THE KEYPAD
UM IF WE ARE IF WE WERE TO FOLLOW THAT AVENUE
WE MIGHT BE S YOU KNOW UM WE'RE KIND OF ALMOST RELYING ON THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH A MOBILE PHONE I SUPPOSE
UM I MEAN I IMAGINE AS WELL THAT THE ACTUAL L. C. D. AND MAYBE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE JOYSTICK AS WELL WOULD BE FOR THE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY
I MEAN MAYBE WE HAVE THE FOL UM THE JOYSTICK AS A SEPARATE ONE FOR THE OTHER FUNCTIONS THEN
THAT THERE'S JUST A A SMALL NUMBER OF AS YOU WERE SAYING UH BUTTONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEFINED
WELL THIS IS A REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE TO STICK TO I'M AFRAID THIS ISN'T ONE THAT I'VE JUST ARBITRARILY DECIDED ON
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU BUT THIS IS OUR DESIGN SPEC FOR NOW
B HOWEVER I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE'LL BE GOING WITH THAT BUT IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE THE AVENUE OF THE MARKETING EXPERT
WELL SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WAS UH THE ABILITY TO LOSE A REMOTE WHICH AS YOU SAID YOU'VE DONE IN FACT WE'VE PROBABLY ALL DONE
UM DIGITAL TELEPHONES UH FOR EXAMPLE ONE UNIT HAS OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT BASE UNIT
YEAH IT'S UH PUTTING A LOT ON YOUR SHOULDERS THERE SO I MEAN THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT SEPARATES US A BIT FROM THE MARKET AS WELL
VOL
VOLUME SELECTION OKAY YEP THE TELETEXT WE'RE GAMBLING WITH AND WE'RE GONNA SAY IT'S DEAD THE WAY OF THE DODO
SO WE WELL SORRY WE COULD MAYBE EVEN GO AS FAR AS SAYING POWER BUTTON SMALL JOYSTICK L. C. D.
AND THEN WHAT MAYBE IS IT ONE MORE BUTTON TO SAY THAT YOU'RE USING THE MENU SYSTEM
AND WHAT A BASICALLY A SMALL MICROPHONE UM ON THE ACTUAL UNIT CAN MAYBE HIDE IT IN THE BASE
E US WE MIGHT BE BETTER WITH THE SOUND POSSIBLY WE COULD MAYBE INCORPORATE
TH E THE TRUE FACT CONSIDERING THE COST OF AN L. E. D. WE COULD JUST INCORPORATE IT ANYWAY
E I THINK IT LEAVES YOU OPEN TO A A POTENTIAL WIDE RANGE OF SHAPES SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE IT STAND OUT SLIGHTLY
UM IF YOU COULD LOOK INTO WHAT WE'VE SUGGESTED SO FAR THE FEASIBILITY OF UM SMALL TRANSMITTER
IF YEAH IF YOU COULD MAYBE AS WELL SEE WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF THIS MINIMALIST APPROACH THAT WE'VE TAKEN
BIT OF A WIDE OPEN QUESTION THERE OF COURSE
FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME IF YOU THINK THAT UH WE'VE SCREWED SOMETHING UP AND WANNA GET IT RECTIFIED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
THE ELECTRONICS COULD BE S EITHER PLACED EXTERNALLY OR INTERNALLY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTROL SO THAT'S GOOD
OH ONE THING THAT WE'VE ALMOST NOT TALKED ABOUT AT ALL MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT UM USER INTERFACE
WE ALSO NEED TO MAYBE GET THE SLOGAN IN HERE UM IT'S I'M POINTING AT MY LAPTOP WHAT IN GOD
NO IT COULD WELL BE I'VE PROBABLY MISSED THAT
UM I THINK THAT'S L ALMOST THE LAST MINUTE THING WE CAN JUST INCORPORATE INTO THE ACTUAL PLASTIC ON TOP
AND I'D SAY THAT THAT'S US FOR NOW
HOW DID WHERE DID WHERE DID YOU GET ALL YOUR IN INFORMATION
AH OKAY
CLICK TO SAVE IN WHERE DO I HAVE TO SAVE IT
UH RIGHT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING DESIGN UH THIS IS BASICALLY THE INSIDE GOING ON OF THE
DO WE NEED UH MANY BUTTONS OR DO WE NEED L MANY LIGHT BULBS THAT COULD BE EASIER TO UH TO REALISE WHICH APPLIANCES ARE ON OR NOT
BUT UM OBVIOUSLY THERE'LL BE MORE DETAILS ONCE WE'VE DECIDED WHAT WE'RE PUTTING ON THE USER INTERFACE
I JUST USED THE IT WAS A MESS UH I WAS JUST PUTTING ADDING IT TOGETHER AT THE END THERE
UH
YOU HAVE THE SWITCH TURN IT ON INFRARED BULB
UH WILL CONTACT THE T. V. AND WILL HAVE WHATEVER DEVICE OR D. V. D. PLAYER THE BULB WILL TURN ON TO SAY IT'S ON
UH SO DO WE NEED ON THE CONTROL UH DIFFERENT BUTTONS TO DECIDE OR DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS WOULD IT BE EASIER
L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE JUST TELLING YOU WHAT'S ON OR UH INTERACTIVE L. C. D. OR
YOU KNOW TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING WORKING WOULD IT BE A BIT CONFUSING
NAH YOU'D SEE IT ANYWAY IF YOU HEAR IT
SO I SHOULD JUST LOOK AT UM THE SPEAKER THE SPEAKER AND AN L. E. D.
P
AS UM IS UH THE THE THE PRESENTATION IS UH ALREADY SLIGHTLY OBSOLETE BECAUSE I HAD IN MIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD UH BE I BE AIMED AT CONTROLLING MULTIPLE DEVICES BUT UH THERE'S STILL STUFF OF RELEVANCE
PRESS ON
I'VE LOOKED AT LOOKED AT A NUM UH COUPLE OF OTHER UH REMOTE CONTROL MODELS JUST FOR AN IDEA OF BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES
AND WASN'T REALLY SATISFIED BY WHAT I SAW I HAVE TO SAY SO THIS IS MORE SORT OF SPRINGBOARD FOR UH HOW THESE COULD BE IMPROVED ON
UM UM BASICALLY THE JOB OF THE DEVICE IS TO SEND COMMANDS TO AN APPLIANCE IN THIS CASE THE TELEVISION SET
UM AND THERE'S TWO MAIN TRENDS IN TH IN THE SORT OF DESIGN PRACTICE
ON THE ONE HAND AND THIS UH THIS PARTICULARLY RELATES TO ITS SORT OF EARLIEST MODELS WHERE WITH YOU KNOW I SO SO MANY BUTTONS ON IT SO ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE TELEVISION SET
UM GIVING YOU EVERY POSSIBLE FUNCTION THAT THE THAT THE DEVICE HAS THE REMOTE CONTROL CONTROLS
AND ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A USER FOCUSED APPROACH THAT PARES THINGS DOWN TO JUST WHAT WHAT IS MOST LIKELY TO GET USED
WITH UH A AND A AND OF COURSE THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SORT OF LOSS OF FUNCTION HERE OBVIOUSLY BUT MOSTLY THAT'S RELATIVELY PERIPHERAL FUNCTIONS
AND UM WELL F THE FOR THE MOST PART FOR T. V. REMOTE IT'S UH THA THAT WOULD BE CHANNEL CONTROL AND VOLUME
UM BUT UH THE PRO I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF THE SORT OF USER FOCUSED DESIGNS THAT ARE ABOUT IS THAT THEY SORT OF MAKE ASSUMPTIONS IN ADVANCE ABOUT WHAT UH WHAT A GIVEN USER'S GOING TO UH WANT MO WANT TO DO FROM WANT IT TO DO MOST
UM SO THAT THOSE ARE THEN IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH FAIRLY MINIMAL NUMBER OF CONTROLS
UM I LIKED EBENEZER'S IDEA OF INCLUDING A JOYSTICK IN THAT AND UH POSSIBLY A SORT OF FAIRLY MINIMAL NUMBER OF SORT OF FUNCTION BUTTONS
AND HAVE A DISP YOU THEN HAVE SOME SORT OF BASIC DISPLAY ON IT SO THAT IF YOU'RE UM SORT OF CHA CHANGING FROM DIFFERENT MODES FOR THE DEVICE IT'LL TELL YOU JUST EXACTLY WHAT UH YOU KNOW EACH DIRECTION OF THE UH
OF THE UM JOYSTICK'S GOING TO DO OR WHA OR WHAT EACH FUNCTION BUTTON'S GOING TO DO
YOU KNOW THE PLAYSTATION CONTROL WHERE YOU HAVE FOUR BASIC FUNCTION BUTTONS THAT ARE JUST MARKED WITH UM DISTINCTIVE UH GEOMETRICAL SHAPES BUT THE AND THEN DEPENDENT ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH IT WHAT GAME AND SO ON UM THOSE UH THOSE FUNCTIONS ARE THEN SORT OF FURTHER SPECIFIED
AND SO IT'S TAKING TAKING THE LEAD FROM THAT
I MEAN I W I WOULD SAY THAT UH WE COULD PROBABLY PROBABLY BE REQUIRED TO UM MO MOST OF THE MOBILE PHONE DISPLAYS YOU SEE THESE DAYS ARE COLOUR BUT WE SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO STICK TO BLACK AND WHITE
SI SI SIMPLY TO KEEP M KEEP THE UNIT COST DOWN
UM I MEAN COLOUR COULD BE A SORT OF SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT BUT UH YOU KNOW COST A BIT OF EXTRA MONEY F W W W W W ONCE EVERYONE'S GOT THE FIRST
I TH THE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE UH THE UH JOYSTICK IS THAT UH YOU YOU YOU THEN BASICALLY YOU CAN THEN BASICALLY PUT IT I MEAN FOR FOR T. T. FOR T. V. REMOTE ALONE
YOU CAN PACK ALL THAT ONTO WAS ONTO A SINGLE CONTROL
BUT UH BUT THE BUT THEN O UH OBVIOUSLY IF UH
I MEAN WITH THINGS LIKE CH WITH THINGS LIKE TUNING AND CHANNELS UM YOU KNOW ADJUSTING BRIGHTN UH BRIGHTNESS AND FIDDLY THINGS THAT NO ONE REALLY BOTHERS WITH
UM YOU'VE GOT TWENTY DIFFERENT DEVICES IN YOUR LIVING ROOM YOU WANT ONE WO Y YOU WANT ONE THAT'LL DO THE JOB OF ALL OF THEM
UM IF ALL YOU'RE REPLACING IS ONE OF THE YOU KNOW HOWEVER MANY REMOTES YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIVING ROOM
TRY AND SELL IT T SELL IT TO THEM TO SUPPLY WITH
ACTUALLY I WOULD SAY MAYBE TWO TWO FUNCTION BUTTONS THE Y WE'RE NOW USING THE MENUS BUTTON AND UM AND AN OG AND AN OKAY BUTTON
I MEAN CERTAINLY SOMETHING I'VE FOUND WITH THE JOYSTICK ON MO THE JOYSTICKS ON MOBILE PHONES IS THAT A LOT OF THE TIME TH THE DEVICE MISTAKES YOU TRYING TO MOVE IT IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER FOR PUSHING DOWN FOR OKAY
SO SO A SMALL SPEAKER YOU MEAN
ACTUALLY ONE ONE WEE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
YOU KNOW I THINK I MEAN IF IT W IF WE GET A MAJOR TELEVISION MANUFACTURER TO SAY Y OH YEAH WE'LL HAVE THAT
SAVE US THE BOTHER THEN THAT'S YOU KNOW VAST AMOUNTS OF SALES
I THOUGHT THE UH THE D THE DOUBLE ARC COULD PERHAPS UH BE THE UH THE ENTER BUTTON
JUST PUT IT ON THE DESKT DESKTOP
UM SH WOULD YOU LIKE TO I'LL JUST DO IT FROM HERE
TRY IT YEAH MAYBE
OH I THOUGHT I PUT IN MY LAST NAME I GUESS NOT BUT
GOT A LOT OF RE RESPONSES AND WE ASKED SOME VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD FEEDBACK
PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THIS IS ONLY A HUNDRED PEOPLE SO EVEN WHEN THE GROUPS ARE DIVIDED INTO FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE
AND EVEN IF IT'S NOT LOST PERMANENTLY IT TAKES ME A FEW MINUTES TO FIND IT
AND THERE WERE SO MANY BUTTONS IT TOOK ME I DON'T KNOW MAYBE TEN MINUTES TO TO GO THROUGH EACH BUTTON
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE SHIFT BUTTON TO ACCESS THE YELLOW BUTTONS YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST A LOT OF STUFF THAT NO ONE REALLY USES
YOU HAVE TO HOLD DOWN MORE THAN ONE KEY AT ONE TIME TO DO SOMETHING THEY'RE JUST NOT GREAT TO USE
NOW DON'T GET EXCITED YET I'VE GOT MORE TO SAY ON THAT
THEY WANT IT TO BE FANCY TH THEY THEY WANT IT TO BE DIFFERENT
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TO TO SAY SOM I MEAN MOST PEOPLE USE A REMOTE CONTROL FOR SWITCHING TO CHANNELS
AND THEY SAY THEY DO THAT ABOUT NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE TIME
SO IF YOU HAVE TO SAY UP UP UP UP
HOWEVER OH BECAUSE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE EXISTS ALREADY
THERE'S NO NEED TO SPEND MONEY ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUT THIS DOES MEAN THE NEED FOR MICROPHONES IN THE
SEE YOU COULD THERE'RE TWO OPTIONS
EITHER YOU HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION BY ITSELF WHICH I THINK IS A BIT IMPRACTICAL FOR LIKE NIGHT TIME IF YOU WANNA BE WATCHING TELEVISION AND YOU WANNA BE QUIET
BUT IMAGINE YOU GOT RID OF THE REGULAR REMOTE PART THEN YOU CAN DESIGN THE REMOTE TO LOOK ANY WAY YOU WANT IT TO LOOK
OR SHAPE IT IT COULD BE AS FANCY AS YOU WANT IT TO BE
SO WE HAVE THE THREE BIRDS WE HAVE THE DESIGN THAT WE HAVE THE THE FANCY BIT
AND THEN WE HAVE AN EXTRA BIT I DON'T REMEMBER SO I'M PRETTY SURE PEOPLE WILL BUY THE REMOTE
UM WILL PEOPLE
WILL PEOPLE BE WILLING TO WAIT FOR THE THE PERIOD THAT IT'LL TAKE TO TRAIN THE REMOTE
'CAUSE I THINK IT WILL THE REMOTE WILL UH GET BETTER OVER TIME WITH THE SAME USER USER
I'M ABOUT TO END YEAH
WELL LIKE IF YOU GO TO ONE UH WHICHEVER ONE YOU WERE WORKING YEAH AND YOU JUST CLICK FILE SAVE AS
SURE BUT THE IDEA OF A REMOTE WITH A MENU OR AND A JOYSTICK I THINK LIKE I H IF I WAS IN THE HABIT OF BUYING REMOTE CONTROLS THEN I WOULD WANT ONE
I THINK THAT'S FAIR YEAH
IT'S JUST THE WAY I FIGURE IT TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS PER UNIT WE HAVE TO SELL AT LEAST LIKE THREE MILLION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
NOT TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE THE MONEY WE WASTE ON REMOTES THAT NO ONE BUYS YOU KNOW
IS THIS GONNA BE ENOUGH TO TO SELL
I HAD ONE OF THOSE AND MY BROTHER AND MY DAD COULD HAVE BEAT ME UP BECAUSE IT IT WENT OFF ALL THE TIME ACCIDENTALLY
TO A TELEVISION
THAT'S BY FAR THE BIGGEST ONE AND THEN TELETEXT IS STILL HERE THAT'S LIKE FOURTEEN AND VOLUME SELECTION
I THINK BECAUSE IT'S SO SMALL IT MIGHT BE AN UH I MEAN IF WE ONLY HAVE LIKE TWO THREE BUTTONS IT MIGHT BE ESSENTIAL TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT
W THOSE LITTLE KEY RINGS HAVE BOTH SO
I THINK TO SUM UP THE LAST MEETING WOULD BE TO SAY UM THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE'VE UM SET OUT
THOSE ARE WE WERE GOING TO GO FOR WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FAIRLY MINIMAL DESIGN BASED ON UH A SMALL JOYSTICK
THIS UH MEETING IS THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE AND IS UM
AND IS TO COVER THINGS LIKE UM WHAT THE PARTS MIGHT BE MADE OF UM
CAN WE UH OUTSOURCE THESE FROM ELSEWHERE UM WILL WE HAVE TO CONSTRUCT ANY ITEMS OURSELVES
WHICH ONE DO Y
OH INTERFACE CONCEPT
UM THE BAT UH THE BATTERY FOR A A WATCH WOULDN'T REQUIRE A LOT OF POWER WOULD BE MY ONE QUERY
W
CURIOUS
UM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA SO FAR
JUST COMPARED TO THE CHIP YOU WOULD USE FOR PUSHING BUTTONS I THINK IS THE THE POINT BEING MADE
WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THE COSTS OF THOSE
SO IN THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'VE BEEN SUPPLIED HOW FEASIBLE WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE IDEA OF USING AN L. C. D. LOOKS
BUT PLASTIC OR RUBBER AS A TRADITIONAL FORM OF CASING WOULD SEEM TO BE A GOOD WAY FORWARD
YEAH WELL WILL WE MOVE ON TO USER INTERFACE AND YEAH
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE'LL PROBABLY BE QUITE TIGHT FOR TIME AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT A LOT YOU'D LIKE TO SAY I GUESS
UM I CAN SEE YOUR POINT ABOUT THE NUMBER KEYPAD
MY FEELING WOULD BE THAT EVEN IF AT A LATER DATE THIS WAS TO BE TAKING CONTROL OF UM BOXES AS WELL UM HAVING THE USE OF THE L. C. D. AND THE JOYSTICK WOULD PROBABLY ALLOW YOU TO MANIPULATE ENOUGH CHANNEL NUMBERS FOR YOU TO BE
SO WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME IS WE'LL USE A LARGE NUMBER OF STANDARD COMPONENTS UM
SAY SOMETHING LIKE UM LITHIUM ION BATTERY THE KIND THAT YOU FIND IN MOST UM SMALL HAND HELD DEVICES NOW
THOUGH I'D HAVE TO SAY DEPENDING ON HOW FLEXIBLE IT IS WE MIGHT NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF INNER FRAME
HOWEVER ONE INTERESTING POINT IS I DON'T KNOW HOW SERIOUS YOU WERE THERE
BUT WE IF WE TAKE SOME OF THE IDEAS WHY DON'T WE MAKE THE DAMN THING YELLOW TO INCORPORATE THE DES THE COLOUR OF THE LOGO
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE IT THAT ONE OF THE OPTIONS THEY HAVE IS THAT THEY LOOK UP THE NAME OF THE COMPANY ON THE L. C. D. AND THEN THEY MAYBE LOOK UP DIFFERENT NAMES OF UM DIFFERENT ACTUAL UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED
OR WE HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL JUST GO THROUGH THEM UNTIL IT'S LIKE DOES THIS DO THE CORRECT FUNCTION AND SUCH
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT YOU GOT THAT ANYWAY
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF AND THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER GONNA BE WORKING QUITE CLOSELY AT THIS STAGE 'CAUSE IT'LL BE HARD NOT TO OBVIOUSLY
UM I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE TOLD A LOT MORE ABOUT THAT AS UH PROGRESS
THEY'RE KIND OF IT LOOKS THEY'RE THE IDEA I'VE PUSHED FORWARD SO FAR IS MAYBE MORE OF A PHYSICAL ONE THERE
UM GOT PRODUCT EVALUATION AS WELL
UM SO IT'D BE A CASE OF DO YOU THINK THAT JUST BRINGING USERS IN TO HAVE THEM TEST IT OUT
OR JUST KIND OF HITTING THE STREETS AND YOU KNOW SAYING THIS IS A NEW REMOTE CONTROL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE LOOK OF IT
UM THE REASON I'M SAYING THAT IS WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT A A REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROL
IF THEY'RE BUYING IT THAT OFTEN OR THEY'RE MAYBE LOOKING TO REPLACE SOMETHING THEN
ALTHOUGH OF COURSE I MEAN AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS I DON'T THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT CHARGING THE EARTH FOR THE UH DEVICE
WE DON'T KNOW UNLESS IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO
W
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO
I WOULD SAY TO
UM YOU'RE GONNA LOOK A BIT MORE AT THE KIND OF THE PHYSICAL MAKE UP YOU SAY
YEAH I WOULD S THAT WOULD BE MY MY FEELING
POSSIBLY I'M THINK I'M NOT SURE BUT I'M SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE AROUND MAYBE THE JOYSTICK AREA WHICH COULD BE USED
SEE EVERYBODY IN A HALF HOUR
UH UH OKAY
UH
UH
THE CASE UH LE THAT'S WHAT I WROTE FIRST OF ALL COULD BE PLASTIC OUR PLASTIC
UH BUT LATER ON WE FOUND OUT THAT UM IT CAN BE RUBBER AS WELL OR TITANIUM OR EVEN WOOD
UH
PLASTIC W OR RUBBER EVEN AS WELL
UH
IF YOU GO ON TO F UH FINDINGS IT'S LIKE TWO OR THREE SLIDES DOWN
SO THIS IS WHAT I FOUND WE CAN USE
UH
CAN EITHER USE A HAND DYNAMO OR THE KINETIC TYPE ONES YOU KNOW THAT THEY USE IN WATCHES OR ELSE UH A SOLAR POWERED ONE
UH
UH
AND THESE ARE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OR TWO DIFFERENT TYPES THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHAPES YOU CAN HAVE
UH ONE IS A FLAT ONE AND THEN MORE ORIGINAL ONES ARE SINGLE CURVED ONE OR ONE WITH A DOUBLE CURVED
UM THE MATERIALS ARE THA THERE AS YOU CAN SEE BUT UH YOU CAN'T HAVE A TITANIUM ONE FOR A DOUBLE CURVED UH WHICH WOULD BE
T YEAH
UH
FOR A CURVED WELL I WAS THINKING TO F FOR TO SIT IN YOUR THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
AN OKAY BUTTON AROUND HERE SO THAT THE THUMB CAN UH USE IT QUITE EASILY
UH
UH
IF YOU WANT THE BUTTONS TO BE OH YEAH IF YOU HAVE A DOUBLE CURVE UH CONTROL AND IT'S RUBBER THEN YOU HAVE THESE RUBBER BUTTONS AS WELL
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HA I RECKON YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE UH KEY A NUMBER KEYPAD ANYWAY FOR THE AMOUNT OF CHANNELS THESE DAYS
UH THE PREVIOUS SLIDES JUST EXPLAIN WHAT'S IN THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF THE UH REMOTE CONTROL
IF YOU GO TO THE ONE BEFORE THAT UH SO IT JUST SAYS WHAT IT DOES
UH THE CHIP JUST NEEDS TO DETECT THE SIGNAL OR DETECT THE KEY PRESS AND THEN UH IT'LL SEND IT TO THE TR THE AMPLIFIER
TO UH GET SENT TO THE CHIP
MAYBE USE SINGLE CURVED UH CASE
BECAUSE WE MIGHT NEED IT TO BE CURVED FOR THE UH
AH OKAY
F IF YOU WANNA DESIGN IT THAT WAY
UM I'M ACTUALLY GONNA BE BOLD AND GO OO GO STRAIGHT FOR RUBBER UM FOR REASONS I'LL GO INTO UH IN MORE DETAIL
AN H. T. M. L. FILE GIVING UM VARIOUS IDEAS FROM UH FROM OTHER PREVIOUS REMOTE CONTROL DESIGNS AND PRETTY MUCH DECIDED TO JUST DUMP THEM ALL
I WASN'T VERY IMPRESSED BY THEM AND THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO RE UH NOTHING I SAW SEEMED TO MEET THE SORTS OF DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS THAT WE'RE GOING FOR TODAY
UM SO WHAT I RA RATHER THAN LOOKING AT OTHER REMOTES UH RA OOMP BE BETTER TO SIMPLY LOOK AT THE HUMAN HAND
UM AND TRY AND F UM AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT A WAY OF LAYING OUT THE ELEMENTS WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED ON
UM SO THAT IF R A IF SO THAT THE FINGER IS E EACH FINGER OR THUMB IS WHEREVER IT NEEDS TO BE ALREADY
I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED THE UM THE NUMERIC KEYPAD BECAUSE IF YOU M BECAUSE ONE OF THE MENUS THAT WE COULD HAVE AVAILABLE UM V VIA VIA THE L. C. D. IS ONE WHERE YOU SCROLL THROUGH CHANNELS
SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING F AND BE BEAR IN MIND SINCE THIS ISN'T MEANT TO WORK FOR UM
F F F FOR DI FOR DIGITAL OR UM OR FOR OR FOR CABLE WHATEVER YOU'RE BASICALLY LOOKING AT FOUR OR FIVE TERRESTRIAL CHANNELS
AND OR UM BOX
UM BASI BASICALLY WHAT I BASICALLY WHAT THE WHAT BE HAVING UM I WOULD SAY THE THE WHOLE THING ARTICULATED AT TWO POINTS
SO THAT IF YOU IF YOU'RE HANDING IT FROM A LEF UH LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED USER YOU CAN ADJUST IT SO THAT THE UM THE L. C. THE L. C. D. AND THE UH
AND ALSO THIS IS A RATHER NICER DE UH DESIGN GIMMICK THAT THE THE UM YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THING YOU KNOW IT SHOULD HAVE SORT OF ORGANIC FEEL TO IT THAT IT SHOULD BE
UM OKAY ON TO ON TO THE NEXT UH TO THE NEXT SLIDE
THE UM THE JOYSTICK UNIT SHOULD REST OVER THE UH THE JOINT OF THE F OF THE UH FOUR FINGER SO THAT IT'S DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE FOR THE THUMB
UM AND IT WOULD NEED T THERE WOULD NEED TO BE A IT WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED JUST BELOW THAT SO THAT IT COULD BE SWITCHED AROUND FOR UH LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED USERS
YOU JUST HAVE BIG TWO BIG BUTTONS THAT COVER MOST OF THE AREA SO IT CAN IN THE UPPER PART
ONE FOR THE FOUR FINGER ONE FOR THE MIDDLE FINGER
AND YOU THEN HAVE AT THE UH AT THE BOTTOM THE L. C. D. AND THIS WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED AS WELL
AND BASICALLY I'D WANT THIS TO REST HERE RIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE WRIST
SO I THOUGHT TH THE SIMPLEST WAY AROUND THAT WOULD BE TO HAVE UM
A CABLE TO CONNECT IT TO THE COMPUTER SOME SOME FAIR IV FAIRLY FAIRLY SIMPLE SOFTWARE ON THE COMPUTER JUST SO THAT YOU ON YOUR COMPUTER JUST SO THAT YOU COULD UM PR PROGRAM IT AT A RATHER IN A RATHER MORE COMFORTABLE INTERFACE
UM THOUGH YOU I IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO HAVE UH HAVE A M UH HAVE A HA HAVE A MODE FOR PROGRAMMING IT WITHOUT THE COMPUTER
BUT IF YOU H BUT BUT BUT IF YOU HAVE A ME BUT IF YOU HAVE A MENU STRUCTURE THEN YOU CAN SUB GROUP THEM
I MEAN I MEAN I MEAN THE THE IDEA OF HAVING IT SORT OF ARTICULATED I TH THERE WOULD BE BASICALLY TWO POINTS OF ARTICULATION
W UM ONE BELOW AND ONE ABOVE THE M THE UH THE MAIN SORT OF GRIP
I D I DON'T THI I DON'T THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A A STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS
IF YOU THEN HAVE A SORT OF OUTER SKIN OF MM FLEXIBLE SPONGY RUBBER THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS YOU KNOW VERY MUCH YOU KNOW
ORGANIC AND I THINK WOULD LOOK RATHER CO I MEAN MI RATHER COOL
IT MAKES IT MAKES IT LOOK MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A VIBRATOR THAN A THAN A UH THAN A REMOTE CONTROL BUT UH
USUALLY WHAT'S DONE IS YOU HAVE THIS BIG BOOKLET FULL OF DIFFERENT POSSI YOU'LL HAVE ALL OF THEM SORT OF PROGRAMMED IN TO THE UH REMOTE
AND YOU'LL HAVE THIS LITTLE BOOKLET OF CODES YOU THEN FIND YOUR UM MA UH FIND YOUR MANUFACTURER AND TRY THE DIFFERENT CODES THAT
BUT IF WE HAD UM SOME SORT OF HOOK UP TO YOUR COMPUTER AS AN OPTION THEN IF YOU'VE GOT A COMPUTER YOU CAN AVOID THAT
AND IT'S A NUISANCE VERY CLOSE TO THE TO UM TO ACTUALLY PURCHASING IT SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE THINKING ABOUT
IF YOU IF THERE'S W I IF THERE'S ONE IN THE SHOP THAT'S THAT SAYS IT CAN AVOID MUCH OF THAT NUISANCE YOU MIGHT BE FAVOURABLY INCLINED TOWARDS IT
UM MO MOST OF THE SORT OF LAYOUT DESIGN DECISIONS ARE ARE MADE I WOULD SAY
THE OTHER THING I MEAN IT I MEAN IT WOULD NEED TO HA IT WOULD NEED TO HAVE UM SOME SORT OF ON BOARD MEMORY ANYWAY
I LIKE IT A LOT
I HAVING IT I HAVING IT SORT OF BR BRIGHT YELLOW I THINK THAT'S QUITE A GOOD IDEA THOUGH MAYBE WE COULD HAVE OPTIONS FOR COLOURS AS WELL
I WAS LIKE LIKE I SAID BEFORE I I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE R. R. ON THE UH ON THE TOP FUNCTION BUTTON
UH
COST IS
IS IT NOT ALSO IT'S EXPENSIVE
NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP FOR THE L. C. D.
IS THAT DID I
IS THIS THE JOYSTICK
WE COMPARED UH WHETHER PEOPLE WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO DO A LOT OF STUFF OR THEY WANT IT TO LOOK COOL
AND THEN WE WE RESEARCH UH FASHION TRENDS IN EUROPE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE NEW BLACK YOU KNOW AS IT GOES
UH WE FOUND IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE PEOPLE WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO LOOK COOL MORE THAN THEY WANT IT TO TO BE COOL
AS IN THEY WANT IT TO DO A LOT OF GOOD S THEY WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE IT DOES A LOT
THEY WANT IT TO BE THAT'S SOUNDS A BIT LIKE A CONTRADICTION
PEOPLE WANT IT TO BE THAT BUT S STILL THEY CARE MORE ABOUT THE WAY IT LOOKS THAN WHAT IT DOES
IT IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT UH FROM THE SECOND POINT TO THE THIRD POINT IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT I MEAN THE SECOND POINT IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE THIRD POINT
I IS IT HAS TO BE COOLER THAN EASY TO USE YOU KNOW IF IT HAS THE NEWEST FEATURES
EVEN IF IT'S DIFFICULT TO USE PREFER IT TO HAVE THE NEWEST FEATURES
BUT I I SEE I COME ON TO THAT IN THE NEXT IN THE NEXT SLIDE
BUT WHAT WE WHAT WE NEED IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROM THE FUTURE THAT LOOKS COOL THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT
UM NOW THE FRUIT AND VEG OPTIONS EITHER WE WE GO IN THAT DIRECTION OR WE STAY TOTALLY AWAY FROM IT
SO IF WE STAY AWAY FROM IT S YOU KNOW STAY AWAY FROM IT
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA GO ALONG WITH IT THEN IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE LIKE AN APPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR A KIWI FRUIT
I SAY POTATO PEELER BUT I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE A HAVE A MUCH COOLER IDEA THAN I DO
SO I THINK COOL IS THE KEY
I DON'T KNOW BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THEY FIRST CAME UP WITH REMOTE CONTROLS THEY HAD A REASON FOR IT BEING
AND IF WE ARE GONNA USE SPONGY WE CAN SAY IT'S LONG LASTING YOU KNOW IT'S DAMAGE RESISTANT AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO
IF WE'RE GONNA USE SPONGY MATERIAL WE HAVE TO THINK OF HOW PRACTICAL IT IS AND HOW WE CAN FURTHER PROMOTE THAT IDEA
LIKE THEY DO ON UH SKY DIGITAL KINDA
THE NOISE FOR WHEN YOU LOSE THE BANANA UM F YEAH
Y YOU KNOW YOU LOSE THE MONKEY THE BANANA
Y YOU LOSE THE BANANA YOU PRESS A BUTTON AND YOU HEAR LIKE MONKEY SCREAMS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO DIRECT YOU TOWARDS THE BANANA
S OH I WAS GONNA TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAMMABLE REMOTE CONTROL
YOU KNOW YOU S YOU CLICK A BUTTON AND IT FINDS THE FREQUENCY THAT
IS IT IS IT ACTUALLY A BOOK OF NAMES TO DIGITS OR IS IT LIKE A FEW PAGES
THIS PERSON PROBABLY NEED TO USE THIS FEATURE LIKE ONCE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU FIRST BUY THE REMOTE CONTROL
WE'VE W DEFINITELY TALKING SOME TYPE OF
WELL SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO REDO THE WHOLE THING ONCE THE BATTERIES ARE CHANGED YOU KNOW ONCE YOU TURN OFF THE POWER
I THINK SO TOO
SA
SO JUST TO TRY AND ROUGHLY GO OVER WHAT WE AGREED IN THE LAST ONE UM
SO UM DUE TO YOUR HARD WORK WE MIGHT AS WELL LET THE UH TWO DESIGNERS GO FIRST AND UH SHOW US THE PROTOTYPE
QUITE HOW THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS I'M NOT SURE BUT
UM IF WE CAN LOOK AT THE CRITERIA YOU'RE GONNA EVALUATE AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE PRODUCT EVALUATION IF THAT'S ALRIGHT
YEAH IS THAT
UM SO IS THERE ANYTHING HERE THAT YOU
THAT YOU WANTED TO COVER AS IN THE CRITERIA THAT YOU'VE COVERED
I IS THERE ANY OF THESE CRITERIA THAT NEED ANY EXPLAINING
OR IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOUS THOUGHT THA REALLY WOULD STAND OUT COMPARED TO THE OTHERS
NO AND WHICH WE WILL DO VERY VERY SHORTLY
UM MOST OF IT STEMS FROM THE USE OF THE L. C. D. WHICH I THINK IN THE END ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT HALF OF OUR EXPENDITURE BECAUSE OF COURSE WE REQUIRED A CHIP AS WELL
UM THE ONLY WAY TO GET THIS DOWN WAS EITHER TO DITCH THE A L. C. D.
AT WHICH POINT WE'VE REMOVED A LARGE PART OF HOW WE WERE GONNA INTERFACE REQUIRE MORE BUTTONS ETCETERA
OR WHAT WE DID WAS THAT WE UM WE AS IN I AS I WAS QUICKLY GOING OVER IT WAS ALTERING THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE
EVEN THEN AS WELL UM THERE WAS NO CRITERIA TECHNICALLY DEFINED FOR A JOYSTICK SO I'VE USED WHAT I THINK'S APPROPRIATE
WITH ANY LUCK THAT WON'T MEAN THAT WE'VE INCURRED MORE COST THAN WE CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD TO
IT BLOWS A LOT OF OUR REALLY GOOD IDEAS KIND OF SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE FOR EXAMPLE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A U. S. B. CONNECTION IS DEFINITELY NOT VIABLE NOW
WE'VE GOT AN ADVANCED CHIP WE'VE GOT THE USE OF THE L. C. D.
SO BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES IS STILL VERY MUCH A POSSIBILITY
UM BUT WHAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO DECIDE ON IS HOW WE'RE GONNA GO FROM HERE
WE DO NEED TO TRY AND COME UP WITH AN IDEA WHICH COULD BE CONTINUED WITH OTHER PEOPLE IF NEED BE
I REALLY THINK AS M MUCH AS IT PAINS ME IS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO WITH PLASTIC AND SOME KIND OF SOLID DESIGN
UM B B B DA IS YOU MEAN ON THE PLASTIC OR
YOU NOW HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS I DO
SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE FOR EXAMPLE THE BATTERY
UNFORTUNATELY WE REQUIRE THE ADVANCED CHIP IF WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT WE'RE NEEDING TO
WE REALLY DO NEED IT TO BE THAT WAY FOR THE ERGONOMICS OF IT
UM PLASTIC FOR SOME REASON INCURS NO COST WHICH I'VE HAD TO VERY MUCH MAKE ADVANTAGE OF
PROBLEM COMES HERE AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE INTERFACE
IF I'VE READ THIS THING CORRECTLY THEN WE CAN SAVE POINT FIVE OF A EURO HERE IN THAT IT'S NOT PER PUSH BUTTON
THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THEN A NUMERIC KEYPAD WOULD COME IN AT UM WHAT
FOUR POINT FIVE EUROS WHICH IS AN AWFUL LOT SO THAT COULD WELL BE WRONG
WHICH HAS HAD TO BE PUT TO ONE SIDE
AS YOU CAN SEE
THE USE OF AN L. C. DISPLAY UM ADVANCED CHIP AND WHAT WOULD DETERMINE THE SCROLL WHEEL HERE AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S AN INTEGRATED SCROLL SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON THAT WASN'T QUITE WHAT I THINK THEY HAD IN MIND WITH A JOYSTICK
AS YOU CAN SEE I MEAN THAT'S TAKEN UP WELL OVER HALF OF THE PRICE
THIS ONE COMES IN UNDER PRICE AS YOU CAN SEE BUT THIS WAS THE ONE THAT SACRIFICED THE MATERIAL FOR THE CASE AND FOR THE ACTUAL CASE DESIGN
UH NO WE HAVEN'T NOT
YEAH IT'S JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ACTUAL DEFINITION FOR WHAT A JOYSTICK MIGHT BE THAT
ARE PEOPLE MAYBE NOT HAPPY WITH BUT ARE WILLING TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS IN GOING FOR A PLASTIC SOLID CASE TO KEEP THE L. C. D.
BUT THE CURVES ALL O OVER HAND IS IT
WHICH IS WHAT WE CAN GET ONTO NOW
AS LONG AS SO ARE WE GONNA SAY W WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE TIME AS WELL BUT WE'RE GONNA SAY UM SINGLE CURVED DESIGN
IT COULD WELL BE BUT AT A COST OF
YEAH THAT'S VOICE RECOGNITION SO
MAYBE EVEN SLIGHT WELL OH YEAH PRETTY MUCH POINT TWO EUROS I'D SAY
ONE POINT FIVE OF A EURO FOR ONE PUSH BUTTON DOESN'T SOUND QUITE RIGHT
SO MAYBE IT'S A CASE OF A PUSH BUTTON IS MAYBE ONE OR MORE
AT WHICH POINT IF
WILL WE GO WITH THAT THEN
IT'S NOT AND WE CAN SEE WE'LL COME BACK TO UH YOUR EVALUATION WHICH YOU'RE PROBABLY NOW GOING TO PAN US BUT THERE WE GO
THREE
AS HE MODELS THE
I'D BE TEMPTED WITH THREE YEAH
YEAH W
IS IT INSPIRED BY CLOTHING FASHION
WELL I MEAN IT'S PROBABLY MORE FRUIT AND VEG THAN MOST OTHER THINGS OUT THERE BAR FRUIT AND VEG SO WHAT FOUR
IS THAT BEING TOO GENEROUS
WELL IT'S KIND OF CURVED AND WE CAN MAKE IT YELLOW AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH BANANA LIKE
SI IT'S GOT A CURVE TO IT
AM I DO YOU THINK I'M STRETCHING THE UH THE USE OF THE BANANA
Y OH AND YOU'VE KNOCKED BATTERIES OUT
UM RIGHT OKAY IT'S CONSIDERING THE PRICE WE HAD TO GET THIS IN
TO HAVE A POSITIVE YOU KNOW EVEN BASED ON THE FOUR OF US BEING HEAVILY BIASED UM
WE'VE GOT THESE UH FOUR CRITERIA HERE FOR UH SATISFACTION
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO UM
UM PEOPLE MADE GOOD USE OF THE
AS MUCH AS CAN BE LEADERED IN THIS UH THING
NOT SO MUCH THAT WE WEREN'T FULL OF IDEAS BUT OF ONES THAT ARE GONNA ALLOW US TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE THING
IF YOU'RE GOING TO AIM YOUR A UM PRODUCT MAYBE AT THE TECHNOLOGICAL KIND OF SECTOR
UM I SUPPOSE THESE ARE ALL THAT WILL HAVE TO BE TAKEN UP WITH A AT A DIFFERENT GROUP AT I GUESS
AS TO A THE COSTS INVOLVED
HAD AT OUR DISPOSAL AND UM SUCH
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MEAN WE COULD HAVE COME UP WITH A LOT MORE SOLID DESIGN IN THE END I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE
IT IS VERY MUCH A PITY TO UM GET SO FAR INTO THE STAGE AND THEN FIND OUT THAT MAYBE SOME OF YOUR IDEAS ARE JUST A BIT TOO EXPENSIVE
ARE THE COSTS WITHIN BUDGET
RIGHT UM IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO TO ADD UM
WE MAYBE AREN'T AS HAPPY WITH IT AS WE'D LIKE TO BE BUT
AND OF COURSE SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN AVOIDING TALKING ABOUT 'CAUSE OF WE'VE NO INFORMATION IS SELLING THEM DIRECTLY TO THE MANUFACTURERS
I MEAN WE'VE BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON IT BUT WE'VE NO MORE KNOWLEDGE THEN THERE'S LITTLE WE CAN SAY ON THAT
WE CAN MAYBE ROUND THIS UP SLIGHTLY EARLIER THAN WE'D NEED TO AND THEN WE CAN FINISH UP THE WRITING AND SUCH
UH THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION
ONE
LIKE Y YOU WOULDN'T HEAR THE SPEAKER
OH AND JOYSTICK YEAH
THREE
ARE WE GOING ONE ON
I'D SAY WE GO TWO 'CAUSE LIKE F THE FANCIEST WOULD BE THE DOUBLE CURVED
WELL THIS THIS WHAT WE'RE GONNA T THIS IS THEIR MOTTO LIKE
AND WE'RE WE'RE NOT DOING WELL ON IT
WOMEN WOULD BE GOING OH LOOK AT THAT 'S COOL IT LOOKS LIKE A IT'S
AND WOULD IT HAVE TO BE TWICE THAT
IT TURNED OUT THAT THE ONLY POINT AT WHICH IT NEEDS TO BE ARTICULATED FOR HANDEDNESS IS UM IS H I IS DOWN HERE FOR THE UH L. E. D.
AS IT TURNED OUT THE WHOLE THING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIGHT TO LEFT HAND FAIRLY WELL FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF OPERATING THE UH FUNCTION BUTTONS AND JOYSTICK
SO THAT THE UH STICKY UH SO THAT THE BIT THAT STICKS OUT A BIT MORE IS ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
BUT AS YOU AS YOU SEE WITH THE UH WITH HOLDING IT IN THE LEFT HAND
THE L. UH THE L. C. D. IS NOWHERE USEFUL SO THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED
AS FOR THE UM
AS FOR THE SINGLE CURVE
THE UH TRANSMITTER HERE AND A WEE SPEAKER FOR THE UH FOR THE UH FOR THE UH FI UH FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL FINDER
I MEAN WITH THE WITH THE RUBBER DESIGN IT COULD I YOU KNOW IT COULD PRETTY MUCH MOULD VERY MUCH TO THE TO THE USER'S HAND
ONE NICE WEE FEATURE IF WE COULD IF WE COULD STILL DO THE RUBBER
I THINK W IF IT WAS JUST THE SOUNDER THEN TH I MEAN SOMETHING I'VE FOUND WITH UH W W WITH SAY TR TRYING TO FIND UH A CORDLESS PHONE OR A M MOBILE
YOU CAN HEAR IT BUT YOU CAN'T QUITE PIN IT DOW PIN DOWN WHERE IT IS
MM-HMM I SUPPOSE O ONE THING THAT COULD BE DONE IS H IS HAVE IT UM CIRCULAR AND HAVE IT S SO THAT THE UH THE PINK ACTUALLY GOES A BIT OVER THE PINKIE FINGER
SO THAT UH TH
I THINK IF WE REMOVE THE THE L. C. DISPLAY THEN THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO POINT TO ANY OF THESE MEETINGS AND WE JUST WE COULD JUST PUT OUR BRANDING ON ANY OTHER REMOTE CONTROL
UM YEAH I MEAN ONE THING I MEAN HO UH HOW MUCH EXTRA WOULD IT BE TO TO KEEP I MEAN KEEP THE UM THE ARTICULATION
OH NO I THINK I I IT D THAT IT NEEDN'T REQUIRE IT TO BE DOUBLE CURVED
IT'S UH IT'S JUST IT'S JUST IT'S JUST THAT THE CASE WOULD COME IN T WOULD BE MADE IN TWO PARTS AND THEN JOINED TOGETHER WITH AN ARTICULATION
YEAH I MEAN AND I MEAN THE UH I MEAN IF YOU LOOK UH IF YOU LOOK CLOSER AT THE UH AT THE PROTOTYPE HERE
THE LINES HERE ALONG THE GRIP
UM I MEAN YEAH ON THE ON THE L. C. D. I MEAN ALTHOUGH WE'VE DONE IT WITH A CURVE IT COULD JUST AS EASILY BE DONE UM WITHOUT CURVES
TO PUT UH TO KEEP THE JOYSTICK IN A GOOD ERGONOMIC POSITION FOR IT TO HAVE IT REST ON THE TOP OF THE HAND
MM NO THAT'S THAT VOICE RESPONSE THING THAT WE GOT THE EMAIL ABOUT
YOU KNOW SAY HELLO TO AND IT WOULD SAY HELLO BACK IN A FRIENDLY FEMALE VOICE
OKAY WELL L LET'S SAY THAT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE OUR SPECIAL COLOURED CASE AND THEN WE AT LEAST HAVE MAKE IT A LITTLE HARDER TO LOSE
THREE
I THINK WE CAN DO THREE
TH THE SPECIAL COLOUR DOESN'T WOULD I THINK MAKE A DIFFERENCE
I MEAN THE MENUS THING IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T NORMALLY SEE ON UM ON A REMOTE BUT YOU SEE IT IN A LOT OF OTHER PLACES
I'D S I I'D GIVE IT A SIX TO BE HONEST
WELL I I I WOULD SA I WOULD SAY GIVE A S GIVE A SELECTION OF COLOURS
I I THINK S I I THINK THIS ISN'T NOT PARTICULARLY FRUIT AND VEGGIE
IS THE SOLE CRITERION FOR BEING UM FASHION FASHIONABLE OR INSPIRED BY CURRENT FASHIONS
ARE PEOPLE REALLY GONNA SHELL OUT TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR SOMETHING THAT'S ONLY MARGINALLY GOOD
I S I SUPPOSE ONE THING IS THAT B BECAUSE IT'S TECHNICALLY INNOVATIVE
TRANSFER OUR N OUR PAPER NOTES ONTO THE UH
UNTI UH UH UNTIL UH UNTIL ACCOUNTS CAME ALONG SQUISH
I MEAN I TH I MEAN I THINK TO R RETAINING THE S THE MORE SORT OF BIO MORPHIC FORM IN THE ARTICULATION WOULD GAIN MORE IN S UH WOULD GAIN MORE PROFIT IN SALES THAN IT WOULD LOSE IN UH
IN ADDED EXPENSE
ACTUALLY I WANT TH ONE THING I WOULD SAY I MEAN SOMETHING THAT COULD PERHAPS BE PART OF THE PRODUCT MM THE UM M PRODUCT TESTING MARKET RESEARCH PROCESS WOULD BE TO UH PRODUCE MOCK UPS OF BOTH VERSIONS AND SEE JUST HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE THE OVER GOING OVER BUDGET
UM M WOULD MAKE TO SALES
UM THEN WE WILL IT'S A SEVEN S UM SEVEN
AND UH THE CRITERIA BASED ON REAL REACTIONS' KINDA GOALS AND POLICIES MARKETING STRATEGIES AND ALSO THOSE I PUT TOGETHER FROM THE USER REQUIREMENTS PHASE
SO THOSE ARE THE CRITERIA
WHICH MEANS THAT UH THE PRODUCT WILL SCORE VERY BADLY ON SOME OF THOSE POINTS
ONE T
SEVEN EIGHT OH
SO UM HOW WELL WOULD YOU SAY THE PROTOTYPE IS UH HOW WELL HAVE WE REALISED THE DREAM OF BEING ABLE TO STOP REMOTES FROM FROM BEING LOST
AND ADAM WE CAN KEEP THAT IN
T
OS ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN HOW WOULD YOU GUYS RATE IT FOR FINDING FINDING IT ONCE IT'S LOST
SO THEY SAY WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS WELL THEY REALLY MEAN IT THEY THEY'RE VERY BIG ON FASHION SO
THAT'S THIS BIT RIGHT HERE
AND UH THIS BIT IS THIS ONE EASY TO USE FOR VISITORS OR FOR ANYBODY
AND WE CAN COME BACK TO IT YOU SAID
HAVE WE FACTORED THAT IN
PLUS THE EXTRA DEVICE ITSELF THAT'S GONNA BE ON A T. V.
IS THAT GONNA BE A BUTTON OR
I I MEAN IT'S NOT ON HERE BUT UM
DID THEY S DO WE HAVE TO USE AN ADVANCED CHIP FOR THE L. C. D.
BECAUSE WE WOULD NEED FOUR EXTRA BUTTONS TO REPLACE IT UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT
AND THAT WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A BUT IS A SCROLL WHEEL NOT JUST BACK AND FORWARD
UH K
COULD WE COULD WE NOT GET RID OF THE CURVY THE CURVOUS THE CURVACEOUSNESS AND FOCUS ON THE MENU BEING THE BEST INTERFACE
OH BUT THERE HAS TO BE
SO I THINK THE PRODUCT IS NOT GONNA PERFORM SO WELL FOR MY CRITERIA
IS THAT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO WHAT WE WANT
I MEAN I WE
OH SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE CASE
WHITE OR BLACK
THREE IF WE'RE BEING GENEROUS I FEEL
WE'RE DOWN TO T TWO BUTTONS IS IT
EASY TO USE INTERFACE BUTTONS MENU MENUS THAT'S YEAH THAT'S GOOD
UM EASY TO USE OH OKAY LET'S FORGET THAT ONE
YEAH W MAYBE YOU'D BE A BIT TOO YEAH
YEAH THAT'S M
THAT'S THAT'S BETTER TOO
AND Y WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS MOVING THE MENU FROM THE TELEVISION TO THE REMOTE CONTROL SO IT'S
THREE
THREE
W WE COULD
IS THIS LIKE A BANANA TYPE COLOUR
OH IS THAT 'CAUSE IT'S FLAT
OR WE MIGHT HAVE TO SUFFER BADLY FOR THIS ONE AS WELL
WE DIDN'T M
OKAY THE THE YELLOW BANANA LIKE THING IS I THINK IS OKAY
IS THAT SOUND REASONABLE
SO WE IT'S IT'S NOT BAD
EVEN IF WE WERE TO INCREASE THIS ENTIRE THING BY BY SEVEN WE WERE TO GO DOWN A GRADE TO TO FOUR
YOU KNOW LIKE WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T ADD WE DIDN'T SUBTRACT A WHOLE SEVEN POINTS FROM THESE THINGS SO I THINK WE'RE DEFINITELY ON THE GOOD BIT
SHE USES IT TO MAKE PHONE CALLS AND THAT'S IT
SO I THINK IF SH IF MY MUM SAW A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE THIS WITH ONLY TWO BUTTONS AND A JOYSTICK
SHE'D BE LIKE IS THIS A REMOTE CONTROL I DON'T HOW DO YOU USE IT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO EVEN IF IT IS REALLY USER FRIENDLY TO US BUT WE'RE USED TO USING MENUS ALL THE TIME
I'D YEAH I LIKED IT YEAH
I LI YEAH TOP MARKS
WE WE'RE NOT LACKING IN IDEAS YOU KNOW IT'S THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM
IT'S LIKE MAN WE WE CAN'T HAVE THE LOCATOR THING
AND S YEAH THAT'S JUST BAD
AS YOU SAID THEY COME WITH THE T. V. SO IT'S NORMALLY JUST YOUR BASIC GREY BLACK REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS SO MAYBE WE COULD THINK ABOUT COLOUR
UM AND AS YOU SAY WE NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF GIMMICK
SO UM I THOUGHT MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE IF YOU LOSE IT AND YOU CAN WHISTLE YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS
SO IT'S GO GONNA HAVE TO BE BE PRETTY DAMN TRENDY
I THINK THE THE ONLY ONES THAT I'VE SEEN THAT YOU BUY ARE THE SORT OF ONE FOR ALL TYPE THINGS WHERE THEY'RE YEAH
UH OH ACTUALLY NO WE'LL ALLOCATE
SO YOU DO THE LOOKING AROUND AT OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS
BASICALLY HOW HOW IT'S MADE I. E. LIKE HOW YOU MAKE IT ALL IN ONE HOW WHAT SORT OF MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU WHATEVER
UH
I SHALL I CAN'T IMAGINE THESE ARE WORTH MUCH
'CAUSE I I KNOW AS YOU ADD MORE BUTTONS TO THE REMOTE IT SOMETIMES GETS SO BIG AND CLUNKY AND THERE'S JUST LIKE A HUNDRED BUTTONS ON IT
UH YEAH UH
BEING AS A MARKETING EXPER EXPERT I WILL LIKE TO SAY LIKE BEFORE DECIDING THE COST OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL OR ANY OTHER THINGS WE MUST SEE THE MARKET POTENTIAL FOR THIS PRODUCT LIKE WHAT IS THE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET
WHAT SPECIALITY OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS ARE HAVING AND HOW COMPLICATED IT IS TO USE THESE REMOTE CONTROLS AS COMPARED TO OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET
SO BEFORE DECIDING OR BEFORE FINALISING THIS PROJECT WE MUST DISCUSS ALL THESE THINGS LIKE AND APART FROM THIS IT SHOULD BE HAVING A GOOD LOOK ALSO
BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY LI UH LIKE TO PLAY WITH IT WHEN THEY ARE WATCHING MOVIES OR PLAYING WITH OR PLAYING WITH THEIR C. D. PLAYER
UH
OR IS ARE YOU COMING ON TO THAT
OKAY AND THEN HOW DO I PRESS THE THE BIG ONE TO GET IT ON TO THE BIG
F. FIVE AND I PRESS THAT AGAIN TO GET IT OFF AS WELL DO I
UH I'M CONCERNED WITH UM W WHAT EFFECT THE APPARATUS SHOULD HAVE ON THE USER AND UM I'M I'M ALSO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OUR MOTTO
PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS SO OBVIOUSLY WE AS A COMPANY WE WANT TO MAKE OUR PRODUCTS TRENDY AND FASHIONABLE IT'S A BIG CONCERN OF OURS
OKAY AND HOW DO I PRESS N JUST THE NEXT BUTTON
SO UM I LOOKED AT EXISTING DESIGNS AND ALSO UM THE INFORMATION THAT RAJ GAVE US WAS VERY USEFUL ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE LIKE WHAT PEOPLE DISLIKE
SO UM WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY FIND FASHIONABLE
THESE ARE TWO LEADING UM REMOTE CONTROLS AT THE MOMENT
UM PERSONALLY I PREFER THIS ONE JUST BECAUSE IT'S LOOKS EASIER USE IT'S A BIT MORE SLEEK WITH MORE OF THIS SILVER STUFF
MORE KIND OF HAND HELD MORE UM NOT AS UH COMPUTERY AND OR ORGANIC YEAH MORE ORGANIC SHAPE I THINK
UM SIMPLE DESIGNS LIKE THE LAST ONE WE JUST SAW NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS AND AS RAJ POINTED OUT
SO I THINK WHAT WE CAN MISS OUT ON THE BUTTONS WE CAN MAKE UP FOR IN DESIGN AND AND HOW NICE IT LOOKS
HAND HELD AND PORTABLE I THINK IS PORTAMINT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE T. F. T. HAVE JUST UM RELEASED UM I THINK IS IT A A REMOTE CONTROL FOR PRESENTATIONS OR UH AND A BIG SEVEN INCH BIG SCREEN
NO SEVEN INCHES ISN'T THAT BIG BUT UM ANYWAY UM SO HAND HELD AND PORTABLE AND UH M I THOUGHT ABOUT OTHER FUNCTIONS FOR T. V. BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY WANT THAT
IT'S FOR ONE T. V. OH RIGHT OKAY SURE
AND SO THE LAST THING I THOUGHT W WHICH I QUICKLY MENTIONED IN THE OTHER ONE WAS MAYBE A BIT OF A GIMMICK TO SET US APART FROM OTHER PEOPLE
OH YOU NEED TO TWIDDLE THE THINGAMIBOBSY THING
ALTHOUGH THE THE DANGER WITH THAT IS IT COULD LOOK A BIT CHEAP
ON THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS KIND OF FUNCTIONS AND STUFF
BUT WHAT ABOUT UM SOMETHING THAT'S BUILT INTO THE T. V. UM THAT YOU CAN PRESS AND IT'LL SEND OUT A LITTLE SIGNAL YOU KNOW LIKE THE ONES THAT WE CAN'T HEAR OR SOMETHING UM THAT THAT WILL ACTIVATE THE REMOTE CONTROL STARTS TO BEEP
IF YOU FIND IF Y
MAYBE NOT EVEN ALL OF IT 'CAUSE WE SAID UM COLOURS AND FASHION W WERE IMPORTANT SO MAYBE UM JUST LIKE A LITTLE L LINE THAT'S KIND OF AROUND THE OUTSIDE AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE THE REST A DIFFERENT COLOUR
'CAUSE YEAH THAT W MORE THAN FINDING IT
THAT WAS MORE LIKE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE WATCHING A FILM IN THE DARK YOU CAN UM STILL SEE THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO IS THAT ONE OF OUR DEFINITE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY WA THAT IT NEEDS A T. F. T. SCREEN
IF IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE S I THINK IT'S A GOOD GIMMICK
WHAT I THOUGHT AS WELL ABOUT THE MATERIAL IS UM MAYBE NOT THIS KIND OF MATERIAL
OH I THINK WI WITH THE MORE ORGANIC SHAPE OF IT IT WON'T BE AS IT WON'T AS HAVE MANY SHARP CORNERS AS THAT
YEAH D WITH THE COLOUR UM DOES IT HAVE TO BE ALL YELLOW DO YOU KNOW
OH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD ONE THAT
HOWEVER UM THERE ARE SOME CHANGES THAT I'VE GOT FROM ON HIGH THAT UM
ARE A BIT UH WELL W WHAT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY REALISE IT WAS THAT THE UH THIS IS FOR A SPECIFIC TELEVISION
SO THE ALL IN ONE IDEA GOES OUT THE WINDOW
AND THEY REQUIRE THAT THE UH ACTUALLY I'LL GET TO THAT AT THE END POINT NUMBER FOUR
OH I NEED TO PLUG YOU IN
UH THERE WE GO JUST SCREW 'EM ON IN
GONNA HAVE TO SWAP THEM ROUND SO NOW IT WAS FUNCTION F. EIGHT
AND IF YOU JUST CLICK THAT IT'LL GO AHEAD ONE AT A TIME
P PRESS F. FIVE TO START IT FIRST
OH YOU WANNA GO BACK
WE'RE ALS WE WE'RE LOOKING AT WHO BUYS IT AS WELL
FIFTEEN TO TWE
OH SO WE DO YEAH
FUN AND GAMES
UH
UH IF YOU IF YOU ESCAPE THEN YOU CAN SEE YOUR BAR
UH OKAY
AND ALSO THE COMPANY WANT TO KEEP IT STUCK TO THE T. V. FOR UH TO KEEP DOWN THE PRODUCTION TIME
OOH
WELL I SUPPO UH YOU COULD Y YOU COULD HAVE THE YOU COULD HAVE THE BASICALLY UM INSTEAD OF A WHISTLE IF IT'S GOT THE VOICE RECOGNITION YOU COULD HAVE IT JUST
BUT SURE SURELY THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE UM SORT OF SPECIFIC RATHER THAN ABOVE A THRESHOLD 'CAUSE IF YOU HAD A LOUD MOVIE ON YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET IT BEEPING BACK AT YOU
SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO DERAIL YOU THERE
AH IS THAT WHAT THAT IS
IS THAT JUST SWITCHES ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND IT'S ENTIRELY SPEECH OPERATED IS IT
AH NOW IT'S FIF FIFTY MILLION EUROS WE'VE GOTTA UH WE'VE G GOTTA MAKE PROFIT SO WE'RE MAKING THAT AT TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS A TIME
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE RECHARGEABLE IDEA
IS THAT IS THAT GONNA MARK UP A LOT
I MEAN IF YOU THINK ABOUT THESE BASE STATIONS NOW IT'S ESSENTIALLY JUST A A LEAD WITH A SORT OF SELF CONNECTING BRAKE IN IT
RIGHT ALSO SO UM A NOTICE I GOT NOT VERY LONG BEFORE THE MEETING SO DIDN'T MANAGE TO FORWARD IT ON TO YOU
IT IS LET'S SEE I'LL FIND IT MYSELF UM
AND THE LOGO UH THE SORT OF SLOGAN WE PUT THE FA FASHION IN ELECTRONICS UH
I GUESS IF YOU'RE GOING FOR A SORT OF GLOBULAR SHAPE YOU COULD KIND OF HAVE IT WORKING ITS WAY ROUND IT OR SOMETHING
UH WHERE AM I
WE ALSO WANT TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS SO WE'LL PRETTY MUCH TAKE THAT ONE AS READ
WE'LL USE THE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS FOR A TELEVISION
SO SORTA STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN A A FEW AND A OR IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE JUST CUTTING ON THE UM
SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ABOUT UM WHAT PEOPLE WHETHER PEOPLE WOULD REQUIRE UM TELETEXT IN A REMOTE TELETEXT OPTION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
SO UH I TAKE IT YOUR POSITION ARLO IS THAT THE BELLS AND WHISTLES WE'VE GOTTA COME UP WITH THE A GIMMICK BUT NOT TOO COMPLICATED A GIMMICK
UM GLOW IN THE DARK IS THAT SORT OF WITH A LIGHT INSIDE IT OR IS IT SORT OF GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL
LOST YEAH
I DON'T I'VE I KNOW OF NO PRODUCTS UM THAT USE SPEECH RECOGNITION WELL
AH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
IT MIGHT DO US OUT OF A JOB
UM SO I THINK RATHER THAN AND THAT ALSO KIND OF TAKES OUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IN TERMS OF THE INTERFERENCE OF IT NOT WORKING VERY WELL AND THINGS LIKE THAT
UM BUT I GUESS NOT I THIN WE'LL JUST WE'LL JUST PRETEND THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM
IS THAT
OKAY WELL WE CAN USE WE CAN STILL USE THE GLOW IN THE DARK AS A GIMMICK ESSENTIALLY
UM IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE LOGO ON AS WELL BRIGHT YELLOW LOGO IN OUR OUR UM
AND WE CAN HAVE SORT OF A A A TRIMMING AS WELL OF THE GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL JUST AS GIMMICKYNESS
ALRIGHT SO N SORTA IF IF IF WE'RE GON IF WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THE IDEA OF UM UH OF FEEDBACK
SORT OF REMOTE FINDER THEN THAT KINDA STUFFS THAT ONE OUT THEN
UH
UH YOU WERE FINDING OUT ABOUT TELETEXT
UM I THINK WE'RE GONNA SCRATCH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AS A BIT OF A
IS IT NOT THE CIRCUITS THAT COST
NO ONE DOES
UH
UH PRO UH PROJECT DOCUMENTS
ON
A. M. I. SCENARIO CONTROLLER
WHERE AM I
PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH IT'S ON YOUR DESKTOP AS WELL
AS SOON AS I GET THEM NOW RATHER THAN I WAS ABOUT TO SORT OF TELL YOU ABOUT THE CHANGES BEFORE THE MEETING
WELL I WOULDN'T TH I MEAN MY REACTION TO AN ALL YELLOW REMOTE CONTROL WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN HORROR SO I THINK JUST HAVING IT
S S I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
OKAY THAT FELT A BIT MORE LIKE A SOMETHING WITH ORDER AND AND REASON TO IT THAN THE LAST ONE
YEAH IT JUST I MEAN IT HAS TO BE A CERTAIN KIND OF WHISTLE TOO RIGHT
IT BEEPS BACK AT YOU OR SOMETHING
SO AS THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER MY JOB IS TO TAKE AN INPUT FROM YOU GUYS UM SO IT'S GOOD YOU WENT FIRST
AND UM HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT UH THE CURRENT PRODUCTS DON'T ALWAYS MATCH USERS' OPERATING BEHAVIOUR
HE MENTIONED THAT THEY'RE NOT FUN TO USE
AND ANY NOISE OVER A CERTAIN THRESHOLD UM IT'LL PICK UP AS A A DISTRESS SIGNAL UM FROM YOU AND IT'LL BEEP BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW OH HERE I AM OR SOMETHING OF THIS SORT
YEAH WELL THA THAT'S UH FOR LATER DOWN THE ROAD UM AND THEN AS FOR THE USER INTERFACE IT SHOULD BE TRENDY
UM AND NOT COMPUTERY RIGHT SO MORE LOW TECH AND NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS
SO I TOOK THESE ALL INTO CONSIDERATION AND ALSO I HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS FROM THE BOSS
RIGHT AND HAVING PERSONALLY WORKED WITH ALL THESE PRODUCTS UH I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE WITH UH WITH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN OF THESE
AS FOR THE USER INTERFACE PROBLEM YOU KNOW TOO MANY BUTTONS
GIVE IT ONE BUTTON
AND AND IT'S A YOU KNOW FOR THE THE COWBOY IN ALL OF US I I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE THE FUNCTION IS THERE BUT
AN ENERGY SOURCE WHICH'D PROBABLY JUST BE UH YOUR REGULAR BATTERIES UM WE DON'T WANNA HAVE IT
UH
YEAH YEAH WE COULD DO THAT TOO
RIGHT SO SO THE UNIRS THE USER INTERFACE UH THE CANONICAL USER INTERFACE FOR THESE WOULD BE JUST A BUNCH OF BUTTONS
UM AS YOU CAN SEE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL HAVE PARTS AND THOSE PARTS LOOK LIKE THAT AND UM YOU KNOW IT'S GOT A LITTLE OPERATING PROCEDURE THAT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
JUST UM SO THE USER CAN PUT IN THEIR FAVOURITE CHANNELS AND MAYBE THEIR PREFERRED VOLUME SETTINGS SO THAT WHEN THEY TURN IT ON IT'S NOT BLASTING
OOH THAT'S TIGHT
OH IT'S
RIGHT AND THEN IT WOULD DO JUST YOU KNOW UH SUBTRACTIVE KIND OF CANCELLATION OF THE NOISE
YEAH THAT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THEN AN ANOTHER THING WAS ABOUT THIS LOSING THE REMOTE AND TRYING TO FIND IT AGAIN
IF YOU DO HAVE THIS SORTA SPEECH INTERFACE TO IT YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO FIND IT
YOU KNOW TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR TO UH TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF
AND UH YOU KNOW IT COULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM Y THAT YOU'VE NO IDEA WHERE IT IS AND IT WOULD STILL DO ITS JOB
YEAH NO TH THE MATERIAL'S CHEAP BUT IT'S JUST UH THE THE GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO CHARGE IT YOU KNOW
AND THEN UH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE SITTING IN THE DARK FOR TOO LONG IT UH IT WON'T GLOW ANY MORE
WELL I THINK A CONSIDERATION TOO IS THAT THESE UH REMOTES GET ABUSED A LOT YOU KNOW THEY GET THROWN AROUND
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THE THE T. F. T. SCREEN WOULD BREAK OR UH GET DAMAGED
ON YOUR DESKTOP SO IT GOES SAVE AS OR
AND THEN UH HIT THAT LITTLE FOLDER UP THING AGAIN
DID YOU GET MY EMAIL
AND IT'S GOT THE THING ON THE INSIDE
AND THEN CH CHILDREN WILL LOVE IT
OH YELLOW YELLOW BALL
S
F OH SORRY F. EIGHT
UH ME AGAIN RAJAN THE MARKETING EXPERT
UH AS WE HAVE DECIDED IN THE LAST MEETING THAT I HAVE TO FIND OUT SORRY YEAH SURE
UH ACTUALLY SORRY I HAVE TO SEE THE OTHER SORRY
UH YES I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE UH MARKET POTENTIAL FOR THIS PRODUCT UH LIKE CONSUMER LIKINGS AND EVERYTHING
WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS PRODUCT AND ARE WE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR A NET PROFIT OR OUR AIMS OR NOT
UH THEN UH THE METHODOLOGY I ADOPTED TO FIND OUT ALL THIS WAS MARKET SURVEY
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS THEY DO FIND IT THAT THE REMOTE CONTROLS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET ARE UGLY
AND YES THAT'S WI UH THIS WILL DEFINITELY THIS CAN DEFINITELY PUT UH UH ENHANCE OUR SALES
SO EVEN IF THE AVAILABLE MARKET GOES FOR THE AVAILABLE UH EVEN IF THE MARKET GOES FOR THE AVAILABLE REMOTE CONTROL IS LESS EVEN THEN WE CAN SELL IT AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
WHICH MAYBE WHICH MAY SEEM QUITE HIGH BUT IF OUR LOOKS ARE ARE IF THE RE REMOTE CONTROL WE DESIGN HAVE A GOOD BETTER UH BETTER LOOK UH DESIGNS
AND THE SECOND THING SOME SOME COMPANIES THEY THINK THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE AND MORE FUNCTIONS OF THE USERS UH OR IN THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS
BUT RATHER THAN THOSE HAVING MORE FUNCTIONS IN THE REMOTE CONTROLS WE SHOULD EMPHASISE WHAT ACTUALLY CONSUMER WANT WHAT THEY OPERATE RATHER THAN MAKING IT TOO COMPLICATED
SO THERE IS NO POINT OF HAVING NINETY PERCENT BUTTONS MAKING THE REMOTE CONTROLS TOO BULKY
OTHERWISE THERE IS NO POINT OF HAVING ALL THIS TYPE OF THINGS
UH SORRY
AH T LOOK ALL THE MARKET POTENTIAL WHAT UH HOW WE SHOULD DESIGN CONSU OUR REMOTE CONTROLS
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE THERE SO AS TO EN ENHANCE OUR PROFIT ENHANCE OUR SALES
UH YES
BECAUSE IT WILL DEFINITELY ENHANCE OUR SALES IN THIS AG IN THIS PARTICULAR AGE GROUP FROM UH FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE
UH IF WE LOOK AT THIS DATA HOW HOW UH H HOW WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS THE CONSUMERS ARE FACING WITH THE EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE MARKET
SO IT SHOULD BE IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO LEARN HOW TO OPERATE THESE REMOTE CONTROLS AND WE SHOULD PROVIDE PL UH SPE UH PROPER MANUALS FOR ITS USE ALSO SO AS THAT PEOPLE CONSUMERS COULD EASILY LEARN
THEY NEED NOT TO HAVE ANY MUCH TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE TO SEE UH TO KNOW HOW TO OPERATE THESE REMOTE CONTROLS
SO THIS IS ALSO A VERY GOO UH MAJOR FACTOR TO LOO UH TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION TO ENHANCE OUR PROFITS AND SALES
UH MARKET POTENTIAL BY ME
UH YES TH THANK YOU
YEAH WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT OUT
UH SORRY I HAVE
MM S
FIFTY MILLION WAS UH PROF
AS A PROFIT
ABOUT COST
UH
UH MAY I SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
UH ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY VERY IMPORTANT POINT UH AS IF WE LOOK AT THE MARKET BECAUSE PEOPLE MOR FIFTY PERCENT PEOPLE THEY FIND THAT THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE REMOTE
BUT YEAH ARE LOST AND MEANS THEY FORGET WHERE THEY HAVE KEPT THE REMOTE CONTROL LAST TIME
LIKE IF THEY COME AND SPEAK SOMETHING AT THE REMOTE CONTROL UH REPLIES TO SOMETHING SOMETHING AND IT GLOWS IN THE DARK
TOTALLY IT TAKES CHEAP SPEECH RECOGNITION SHE THEY WI
PROJOCT UH PROJECTOR
SMALL LOGO WITH THE LIKE A SMALL YELLOW STRIP OR Y YELLOW WITH THE LOGO IN IT
IS THAT
UM AND WHAT THE SURVEY TOLD US AND WHAT WE THINK WOULD BE GOOD SO A BIT OF IMAGINATION
WHERE YOU UM HAVE GOT S BUTTONS AND YOU POINT IT RATHER THAN HAVING THE OUTPUT AS A A STREAM OF TEXT OR SOMETHING
BUT I THINK STANDARD KIND OF UM SHAPE AND UH PLAY AND THOSE KIND OF BUT BUTTONS LIKE THE THE TOP RIGHT FOR ON AND OFF OR SOMETHING
UM OH I STILL HAVEN'T GOT MY GLASSES ON
SO THESE ARE THE SOME OF THE PICTURES OF EXISTING ONES
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF IDEA WE'RE GOING FOR
THIS ONE IS GOT A KIND OF SCROLL LIKE A MOUSE WHICH YEAH
BUT THE ONE BELOW THAT HAS GOT LIKE A LITTLE SCROLL FUNCTION ON THE SIDE
AGAIN THAT'S JUST QUITE BORING SHAPE GREY LOOKS QUITE SPACE AGEY BUT TOO MANY BUTTONS I THINK ON THAT ONE
AND THIS ONE THE OVER SIZED ONE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I THINK IT'S A BIT TOO GIMMICKY
BUT POINTING OUT UM THAT THIS ONE THE VOLUME IT IS KIND OF PRESSING DOWN BUT IT WOULD ACTUALLY GO UP BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE
UM BUT THE BUTTONS ON THIS I THINK ARE IT'S JUST SHOWING YOU HOW YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM BUTTONS
SO WE NEED TO COMBINE THOSE ONES UM AND I'VE JUST GOT AN E MAIL FROM OUR TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT THEY HAVE BROKEN THROUGH WITH SOME NEW SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE THAT YOU CAN PROGRAM IN
UM YEAH IT IS JUST IN TIME VERY HANDY
I'M NOT SURE IF THE IF FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS UH PER UH TWELVE EUROS FIFTY M MANUFACTURING COST
S
AND ONE OF THE SURVEY FINDINGS WAS THAT THEY WANT IT EASY TO USE SO I THINK I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE L. C. D.
IT'S A IT'S GREAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT FOR OUR BUDGET AND FOR THE THING WE'RE TRYING TO GO FOR EAS EASY TO USE
THE BIT IT OFTEN GOES MISSING ESPECIALLY WITH CHILDREN
BUT WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE YEAH
I LIKE THE D THE DIFFERENT SHAPES OF THE BUTTONS AND STUFF
AND THE MOUSE ONE I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE PEOPLE USE MO MICE MOUSES NOW WITH THE SCROLLING THING
S YEAH
SO THEY'D BE ABLE TO USE THAT UM AS I SAID I THINK I I'D PRESUME IT WOULD COME UP ON THE SCREEN
SO OKAY I'LL TAKE THIS OUT NOW THEN
YEAH THE BUTTONS W LIKE
'CAUSE THERE'S GONNA BE THE THE COVER THE THE RUBBER OR THE PLASTIC CASING AND THEN THE BUTTONS IN PROBABLY TWO DIFFERENT COLOURS OR I IF WE'RE HAVING BUTTONS ACTUALLY
YOU DO HAVE ONES LIKE UM PLAY COULD BE GREEN OR ON AND OFF IS RED AND STUFF LIKE THAT YEAH
BUT THEN HOW WOULD YOU POINT IT
HOW WOULD YOU POINT IT
UM I MEAN THOSE IDEAS I SAW WERE JUST FOR INSPIRATION I THINK
SO LET'S NOT USE THE WHITEBOARD ANY MORE
AND AS WE SAY WE N WE DON'T WANNA BE TOO RIDICULOUS WITH THE FRUIT THINGS YOU KNOW
WE STILL NEED THE BUTTONS IN THE SAME PLACES THOUGHT DON'T WE
OH HALF A FRUIT
WELL UM BECAUSE WELL I I'M NOT SURE IF WE SHOULD GO SO FAR IN THE WHOLE FRUIT THING
W I THINK WH WHA WOULD WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS WHO WANT IT QUITE TRENDY AS WELL THEY SAID
LIKE GOOD TO HOLD BASED ON FRUITS AND NATURAL THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE AL ALREADY WE'RE GOING A BIT GAUDY WITH THE YELLOW YOU KNOW
OH A D A DYNAMO
BUT W LIKE JUST NORMAL LIGHT
JUST IN TIME
IT'S ON BUT THERE'S NOTHING ON THE SCREEN
FUN
UM WE ARE SO THE MEETING WILL HAVE ABOUT THE SAME FORMAT AS THE LAST TIME
UM AND IS THERE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE THAT ARISED FROM LAST MEETING THAT
N
UH YEAH
EITHER
UH OKAY
UH NO JUST ESCAPE
AH IT'S KINDA LIKE SCROLLING UH RIGHT WELL
IF I S IF I'M THINKING OF THE RIGHT ONE I'VE GOT THE SAME THING IN FRONT OF MY MONITOR
YEAH I M I MEAN THE ONE THING I THINK ABOUT ABOUT THESE ONES IS UM THESE KL UH SECURED AREAS UM
IT'S STILL IT'S STILL GOT TO GET WITHIN OUR TWELVE FIFTY YOU KNOW
I CAN'T SEE THA ALTHOUGH TH I MEAN TO BE TO BE SURE THEY HAVE GOT I MEAN THEY ARE GOING CRAZY WITH THE L. C. D. TECHNOLOGY NOW
BUT I MEAN LIKE I I THE BLACK AND WHITE I GUESS IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK FUNKY ENOUGH
WELL SI SINCE WE'RE GOING FOR THE UH THE K THE SORT OF COMPANY COLOURS
I THINK YOUR LEMON WASN'T THAT FAR S AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK YOU KNOW WE'VE JUST MADE A LEMON
I MEAN WE ARE MARKETING TO SORT OF TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE SO MOST PEOPLE
WILL HAVE COME IN CONTACT WITH THAT KIND OF USE
AND THAT MEANS THA THAT MEANS YOU GET TO BUMP THAT BIT TO THE T. V. MAKER SO
UH
SO CAN WE MAKE THEM TO PRETTY MUCH ANY SIZE WE LIKE OR IS THERE A MINIMUM OR
AND THER THAT'S ALSO F SORTA RELATIVELY CHEAP TO CAST
UM SO MAYBE S UH A SORT OF UH PLASTIC INITIAL PLASTIC WITH A A LATEX KINDA SHEATH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT STUFF IS
OTHER PARTS OR UH
YEAH OR YEAH A LIMIT UH MAYBE EVEN JUST A LIMITED MULTI COLOUR SO IT IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO CHILDISH PERHAPS
I MEAN IF WE ARE GONNA MAKE IT A NOVEL I MEAN DOUBLE CURVED SOUNDS GOOD TO ME IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SORTA ERGONOMIC AND EASY USE
YEAH IT'S UH YEAH THAT THAT'D BE THAT'S SORT OF COMFORTABLE TO HOLD EASY TO HOLD SO YOU DON'T DROP IT
MM AND A LEMON MIGHT BE A LITTLE HARD TO GRIP
I MEAN THAT THAT TH
S
UH
LET'S THAT'LL MAKE US FIFTY MILLION EUROS
I GUESS IT'S KIND OF DRA UH YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE IT SORT OF CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS A FRUIT JUST TO HAVE THAT KIND OF FRUITISH SHAPE
UM I L I SU I MEAN FOR THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS YOU KNOW UP AND DOWN UH PLAY STOP
I MEAN HO H H WEL ARE WE SURE THAT SCROLL WHEEL DOES GIVE EASE OF USE
AND UH I THINK IF THIS THIS NEW SOFTWARE FOR THE SOUND RECOGNITION IS THE MICROPHONE
SO IT CAN BE SORT OF HELD AND W WE REALLY NEED REALLY GONNA NEED TO HOLD IT IF IT'S GONNA BE VOICE RECOGNITION
I S I STILL LIKE IT
YES OR MAYBE IT'S JUST GOING A BIT UH TOO FAR
I MEAN UH SOME UH I L LIKE THINK OF A FRUIT THAT COULD SIT SORT OF INDEPENDENTLY ON ITS OWN LIKE UH I DUNNO AN APPLE
THEN IT'S JUST APPLE SO SORT OF UH YELLOW APPLES THOUGH HMM
SO A SELECTION OF CASINGS
IT KIND OF FI IT FITS WITH F FITS WITH MARKETING UM
I THINK THO I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A FACIA THEN YOU'D WANT TO HAVE IT SO THAT IT DOES GO OVER THE BUTTONS
'CAUSE WHEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF THEY'RE WANTING IT 'CAUSE THEY WANT TO LOOK AT IT
YOU KNOW 'CAUSE THAT'D BE IN THE PALM OF THEIR HAND AND THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT
UNLESS YOU HAVE SORT OF YOU GOT THE BUTTONS OPTIONS ON ONE SIDE
AND YOU GET THE FACIA ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH A MICROPHONE SO THAT YOU CAN PLACE IT FACE DOWN
AND YOU'VE GOT THE FACIA AND YOU CAN JUST TALK AT THE
OKAY SO WE STICK WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT THERE
SO YOU KNOW UM BLUE AND YELLOW TEND TO GO TO WE WELL TOGETHER
W SORT OF
UH YEAH
IT DOES LEAVE THEM WITH AN OBLIGATION TO ESPECIALLY IF THEY WANT TO USE IT UH UH SP UH SPECIFICALLY AS UM VOICE ACTIVATED
I MEAN I W I W UH THAT IDEA THAT I THOUGHT UM JUST ON THE BASIS OF LIKE RIDDING THEM OF BATTERIES AND THAT KIND OF BOTHER IS HAVING A
BUT UM FOR USING IT AS UH RECHARGING IT BUT ALSO FOR USING IT AS SOUND RECOGNITION
UH WOAH
OKAY WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF UH WE'RE KIND OF UM EXCUSE M I'VE JUST DELETED THAT WHOLE THING
UH
AND I JUST TOUCH THE PAD
SO UM YOU KNOW I MEAN LUCKILY WE CHOSE A NICE SIMPLE SHAPE
UH YEAH I HOPE I CAN RECOVER THIS 'CAUSE I'VE ACCIDENTALLY DELETED IT
YEAH CAN YOU SAVE THAT UH SEND THAT LAST ONE AGAIN PLEASE RAJ AS I STILL CAN'T FIND IT ON THE
UH RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT IT GOES THERE AUTOMATICALLY IF YOU PUT IT IN PROJECT DOCUMENTS
PROJECT DOCUMENTS IS ON THE UM DESKTOP
YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF Y IT IT JUST CA IT JUST CAME UP ON MY UM
ON MY AGENDA
S UM PRESUMABLY THERE'S CLAY SOMEWHERE
AND WE'RE USING THIS OUR BASIC CHIP SET SO IT'S ALL GOOD
UH OKAY STILL DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET DOWN ALL THE LAST BITS SO WE HAD RECHARGEABLE AND
UH
'KAY SO WE CAME UP WITH THAT THAT'S OKAY
SEE
IF I KN SEE I I KNEW THAT
UH NO I THINK THAT'S US OUR DISCUSSION OVER UNLESS ANYBODY'S GOT QUESTIONS OR CONFUSIONS 'CAUSE I'M CONFUSED
I ROUNDED IT UP FAR TOO FAST
BUT UH PRICE PRICE NOT WITHSTANDING UM IS IT TOO COMPLICATED IS IT GONNA BE TOO MUCH JUST OVERLOAD
AND I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU THE UH I GUESS TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THOSE
AND I'M GONNA USE THE WHITEBOARD JUST 'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T USED IT
A PROCESSOR THE T. A. ONE ONE EIGHT THREE FIVE WHICH UM RECEIVES INPUT FROM THE BUTTONS AND CH
UM SO THAT TAKES A SIGNALS FROM THE BUTTONS AND TRANSLATES IT INTO A SEQUENCE OF PULSES THAT IT THEN SENDS TO THE TO THE AMPLIFIER
OP AMPS AND THEN THAT GETS SENT TO THE UH TO THE L. E. D. LIGHT
WHICH I CAN KINDA SEE IS THAT LITTLE RED LIGHT BULB AT THE END AND THAT SENDS OUT THE INFRARED UH LIGHT SIGNAL TO THE TELEVISION
OH HERE IT IS
R UM NO I MEAN THIS IS A VERY OLD ONE SO NOW WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THIS IS A A MINIMALLY SMALL AND CHEAP THING TO MAKE
SO THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE FOR CERTAIN
SO YOU KNOW AS WE SAID WE GOT THE OUTER CASING WHICH WE HAVE TO DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT'S IT GONNA BE
UM THE BOARD WE HAVE TO USE BASICALLY UH THE SAME SET UP
PROCESSOR UM WE'LL PROBABLY USE THE MORE ADVANCED PROCESSOR THAN THEY HAD AMPLIFIER AND TRANSMITTER ARE ALL STANDARD
UM SO FOR THE CASING UH THIS AN E MAIL I GOT FROM OUR MANUFACTURING TEAM
UH OR SPONGE I GUESS ISN'T ON THERE RIGHT
UH YEAH IT'S VERY ELASTICY FOR SURE
OKAY SO HERE ARE A A PLASTIC
SO SOMETHING WITH GIVE TO IT
OH I IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH END YOU POINT I GUESS
WE COULD HAVE A LITTLE L. E. D. S ON EACH END
SO A SPONGY BANANA RE YEAH
SEE
SO MAYBE AN AN UNIDENTIFIABLE FRUIT OR FIABLE FRUIT OR VEGETABLE LIKE SO IT WOULD HAVE A STEM PERHAPS AND A
SO IT'D LOOK LIKE THIS KINDA
YEAH AND IT HAS A A CLEAR TOP AND BOTTOM SO Y SO YOU COULD SAY YOU KNOW IT TRANSMITS FROM THIS END
SO SHOULD THE MICROPHONE BE JUST ANYWHERE ON IT OR
UM N WELL WE CAN
I IT COULD EVEN ENCOURAGE HEALTHIER HABITS FOR TELEVISION WATCHERS YOU KNOW THEY HAVE UH FRUITS ALL ROUND THEM
NOW JUST MAKE SURE THEY DON'T EAT THE REMOTE
BUT YEAH ABOUT THE SPEECH THING IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HAND HELD OR CLOSE
YEAH S I GUESS WE DECIDED ON MATERIAL RIGHT
AND THE COLOURS WE GOT DOWN AND THE SHAPE MAYBE WE'LL JUST MAKE IT KINDA MIX AND MATCH TYPE OF SHAPE OR
UM AS FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE UM YOU KNOW ALMOST EVERY REMOTE CONTROL USES JUST BATTERIES BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE LIMITED BY THAT
RIGHT IT'S LIKE THOSE WATCHES THAT YOU C SO
SO IF IT IF IT'S NOT WORKING I GUESS PEOPLE'S NATURAL REACTION ANYWAY IS TO JUST SHAKE THE THING
UH TH THE UH THE ELECTRONICS UM BASICALLY THE MORE FEATURES WE ADD UM
SO THE MORE FEATURES WE ADD THE FANCIER CHIPS WE NEED TO BUY AND PUT IN WHICH ADDS TO THE COST AS YOU CAN EXPECT
SO JUST IN TIME
YEAH AND KEEPING THE L. C. D. SCREEN OUT
OH I GET TO DO IT TOO
OH NEAT
SAVE EVERYTHING TO THE SHARED DOCUMENTS IS THAT RIGHT
UH THESE LAPEL MICS ARE TROUBLE
HI ME RAJ AGAIN
SO WHAT ARE OUR FINDINGS
IN OUR UH IN OUR FINDINGS WE HAVE SEEN THAT WHEN WE DID OUR REMOTE CONTROL MARKET SURVEY WE FOUND THAT UH PEOPLE L UH PEOPLE DO HAVE PREFERENCE FOR THO FANCY MOBI UH F REMOTE CONTROLS WHICH LOOK AND FEEL VERY GOOD
SO WE SHOULD TAKE INTO UH WE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS FACTOR AS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR BECAUSE THIS FACTOR IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT
THE SECOND FACTOR WHICH IS FURTHER TI TWICE THE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SEC AS UH THE THIRD FACTOR
NO THE FIRST ONE IS THE UH THE OUTLOOK OF THE MOBILE THE IT SHOULD HAVE A FANCY OUTLOOK
WE MUST HAVE SOME TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT IN THE REMOTE CONTROL THA RATHER THAN JUST PUTTING IT AS IT IS AS THE OTHER REMO UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE
AND THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IN THE TA TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
SO THAT THEY COULD KNOW HOW TO USE THESE REMOTE CONTROLS
AH YEAH
Y YEAH UH YEAH WE HAVE TO BECAUSE UH D YOU CAN SEE HOW PEOPLE HAVE RELATED THEIR CLOTHES SHOES AND EVERYTHING WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
BECAUSE THE G WORLD IS NOW CHANGING IT'S TREND TOWARDS ORGANIC BECOMING MORE AND MORE ORGANIC BECOMING YEAH
AND PEOPLE UH THE F FEEL OF THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY RATHER THAN JUST HAVING A PLASTIC LOOK HARD LOOK
NO IT CA Y A THE RUBBER WHICH IS GOOD FOR HEALTH AND WHICH IS QUITE DISPOSABLE THAT WE CAN TAKE INTO CO YEAH
S UH WE DIDN'T FIND OUT ANY SUCH POINT
UH YES THERE COULD BE BUT WE COULDN'T FIND OUT ANY SO
UH YEAH
UH I IT WILL BE EASY BECAUSE THERE WILL BE ON L. C. D. S SCREEN
THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT FRENT ICONS THEY CAN JUST CLICK OK OKAY WHATEVER THEY WA
AH YEAH
THAT WHAT OUR DATA SHOWS THAT SO THIS W THIS W
OR WE CAN DO SOMETHING WE CAN DESIGN TWO THREE SHAPES AND WE CAN HAVE A PUBLIC SURVEY LET THE PUBLIC CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT
OR WE CAN WE CAN DO ONE THING WE CAN JUST HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL AND CASINGS OF DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SHAPES
IN THAT W
S S SORRY
UH LIKE IF THIS IS A LIKE IF THIS IS A MOBILE PHONE UH WE WILL DESIGN CASING IN SUCH A WAY LIKE HALF OF
IF SOMEBODY WANTS IT I IN BANANA SHAPE WE WILL FIT BANANA SHAPE CASING ONTO THAT SO IT WILL GIVE A BANANA SHAPE LOOK
IF SOMEBODY WANTED IN APPLE SHAPE WE WILL DESIGN THAT WE WILL PUT WE WILL PUT APPLE SHAPE CASING ON THAT
IT WILL GIVE APPLE SHAPE LOOK
SO IN THAT WAY YOU CAN HAVE ANY THAT MEANS WHATEVER YOU WANT WITHOUT UH YEAH
YEAH BUTTON WILL BE ON THE UPPER SIDE BUTTONS WILL BE THE ON THE UPPER SIDE
YEAH BUTTONS WILL BE ON THE UPPER SIDE LOWER SIDE WE WILL JUST PUT THE CASING
SO HALF OF THAT WILL BE LOOK THE YEAH NOT NOT THE UPPER SIDE
SO FROM LOWER YOU CAN IT MEANS WHILE YOU ARE HOLDING OF FROM THIS SIDE YOU C YOU CAN HAVE BANANA LOOK OR APPLE LOOK WHATEVER
SO IN THAT WAY WE NEED NOT TO D HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SHAPE MOBILES EVERYTHING WE WILL JUST DESIGN CASINGS FRUIT SHAPE
BUT BUT DO YOU THINK THAT IT WILL BE A GOOD IDEA TO USE DYNAMO THA THESE TYPE OF CELLS
BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE HAVE TO WELL LIKE IF THE CELL IS OUT OF BAT YEAH TO MO YEAH
UH SOLAR POWER WILL W ALSO NOT BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEN THEY HAVE TO KEEP M THEIR MOBILES OUTSIDE IN SOLAR ENERGY
YOU JUST TOUCH THE PAD YEAH
OH YOU DIDN'T GET THAT
I WILL SEND NEW
UH YEAH
BUT I COU CAN'T OPEN THAT BECAUSE IT W ASKS UH FOR SOME USERNAME OR PASSWORD
UH
YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR PEN SEPARATE BECAUSE I USED YOUR PEN
S
OR WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS SOMETHING
UM ONE'S BASED ON THE BANANA ONE'S BASED ON THE TOMATO AND THE OTHER ONE IS ST
LOOK
OKAY SO THIS IS THE UM NON TO NON UH NO BUTTONS ONE OR AS MM FEW BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE MAINLY SPEAK RECOGNITION
IF YOU DO NEED BUTTONS YOU CAN FLIP IT OVER AND THERE'S SOME THERE UM BUT MAINLY IT'S SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH AND YEAH THEY MIGHT PROJECT THINGS ONTO THE SCREEN WHICH YOU CAN DO ON THERE
UM AND THIS ONE IS THE ONE W MORE LIKE THE ONE W THAT WE LOOKED AT EARLIER
UM THAT ONE IS OH NO IT'S DELICATE
UH YEAH THAT WELL WE DID THINK OF THAT
YEAH IF IT'S STANDING UP IT'S IT'S ON THERE BUT ALSO WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE COMPANY NAME ON THE FRONT
WE USED THOSE
AND UM THEN THE BIG RED BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE IS THE ON AND OFF ONE
SO THERE WE GO AND AND UM WE HAVE THE BANANA BASED ONE TOO
OOH
YEAH IF WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE DESIGN THERE'S NO POINT IN SPENDING MONEY IF WE DON'T HAVE TO
BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN AN IDEAL PLACE RIGHT NOW
OH YOU GOT A PRESENTATION SORRY
MM LOVE TO EAT THAT NOW
OH COULD YOU PASS THE TOMATO PLEASE
OKAY SO ONE
IS THAT NO IS THAT NOT TRENDS
THA THREE OR FOUR I'M NOT SURE
THREE
IS IT
ONE
YEAH ONE
WOO HOO
WE'LL STA I'LL USE THE POWERPOINT I GUESS
HOW WAS THAT WAS THAT FUN
UH OH I'VE FORGOTTEN TO MAIL YOU THE MINUTES BUT I WILL DO
UM UM WE YEAH
UM WILL YOU GUYS FIRST WITH YOUR PROTOTYPE
I DON'T EVEN HAVE THIS ON
THREE
AH I SEE OKAY
OKAY SO THE BUTTONS WOULD BE LIKE YOU KNOW INDIVIDUAL USERS OR YEAH
AT OH DEAR
LO SORT OF LOCH NESS BANANA
OH THERE ARE ISSUES OH THERE ARE ISSUES
SO BASICALLY UM IN ORDER TO SAVE OUR TWO EUROS
YEAH I MEAN IT'S ALREADY GOT A KIND OF COOL SHAPE SO BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE CURVED SORT OF IN AND OUT
AND BY DOING SO OH NO HOLD ON
THAT'S SORT OF CURVE IN AND OUT
NO I THINK IT MEANS DOUBLE CURVED AS IN UM LIKE UH A SINGLE CURVE ON THAT BOTTOM HALF
WE COU OH NOT QUITE HAVE THE SCROLL WHEEL UNFORTUNATELY
OH WELL NEVER MIND
PROJECT PROCESS HOW DO WE THINK THAT WENT
OH WE'VE BEEN WRITING THIS UP FOR M MONTHS
NO I MEA I THINK IT MEANS SORT OF INDIVIDUALLY
YES NO MAYBE
UH YEAH OKAY
YOU'RE ALL GET YOU'RE ALL GETTING A RAISE
UH RIGHT
UH
IT DIDN'T BOTHER TO TELL ME THAT ON THIS
IS IT
OKAY I DIDN'T REALISE YOU HAD THAT BIT
UH
WHEN THE USER REQUIREMENT IS ESSENTIALLY JUST TO OPERATE THE T. V. SO YEAH OF COURSE WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT A WORKING MODEL YET
ONE YEAH
NO IT'S IT'S LIKE TRUE IS ONE END AND FALSE IS THE OTH
OH I'LL GO FOR A ONE
BASIC REQUIREMENTS BUT OF THE PRO OF THE PROJECT
YEAH TH
COME ON THAT WAS THE THA
OH I SEE
YEAH I AM SORT OF PRET UH JUST THE FRUIT DOES ME IN I MEAN UH IT MIGHT
SO UM UH ALSO UH I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN THE L. C. D. SCREEN IN IT
A ONE AS WE NOT ONLY KEPT IT BUT WE WERE LIMITED BY
UM MAYBE WE SHOULD BRING SO THAT THE CAMERA CAN SEE
IT'S TO UH INDUCE MORE TELEVISION WATCHING I SUPPOSE OR
SAY IT FOR THE CAMERA
WHAT'S ON THE UH ON THE LEFT
IS I
CUT THINGS OUT
WE SHOULD FIRE THE ACCOUNTANTS
FIRE THE ACCOUNTANTS
AH YEAH WE COULD ADD THINGS
IS IT THE OTHER SHIFT BUTTON MAYBE
THESE PENS ARE ARE NEAT THOUGH
OH OK
UH
IT'S FUN TO TOUCH
THERE IT IS
UH
ABOUT ONE POINT F ONE POINT EIGHT
YEAH ROUND IT UP TO TWO
HOW IT HOW CONFORMS TO THE CURRENT TRENDS
AS FAR AS THE UH TECHNOLOGY IT ITS' GOT THE LATEST TRENDS IN SPEECH TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S MISSING THE SCREEN
AS WE SAID UM BUT IT DOES HAVE THE PUSH BUTTONS OR THE SCROLL BUTTONS
I'D GIVE IT A KINDA MIDDLE OF THE ROAD FOR
IS THAT THE QUESTION
SO ONE AND A HALF
S
UH
OH SORRY S
IT THIS ONE IS SINGLE CURVE
WE DISCUSSED ALL THE NEW IDEAS BUT OF COURSE WE COULDN'T REACH ANY PROPER GOALS
WE COULDN'T USE THESE BUT WE H WE ARE USING THESE SCROLL BUTTONS LIKE THIS
THESE ARE NEW IDEAS WE AND NEW SHAPES EVERYTHING
AT LE YEAH
UH MINE NEEDS ALSO THIS
AT LAST MINE IS ALSO THE PRESENTATION
HOW WE ARE GOING TO MEANS UH AT WHAT STANDARD WHAT STANDARD WHETHER IT MEETS OUR STANDARDS OR NOT
HOW MU WHAT RATING WE WILL GIVE TO THESE PRODUCTS
SO OF COURSE THIS IS WILL BE A TEAM WORK W WE TOGETHER HAVE TO DECIDE WHA WHAT RATING WE WILL GIVE TO THIS PRODUCT AND EVERYTHING
THEN TRENDS WHETHER IT IS AS FASHION TRENDS OR NOT
AS WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT OUR COMPANY IS QUITE IN THE MARKET NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF PROVIDING QUALITY PRODUCTS
NOT ONLY IN PRO PROVIDING LATEST TECHNOLOGIES BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL S
I'M HAVING THIS SCALE THIS SCALE SO WE HAVE TO DO IT ON A BOARD
S
UH
BUT I THINK HIGHEST RANKING IS SEVEN OR ONE
UH D YOU CAN YOU CAN TELL ON ON THE LIKE I THINK SHE HAS GIVEN HER VIEWS ON THE BASIS OF DESIGN
BECAUSE SHE WAS OUR I INTERFACE EXPERT
BUT YOU CAN GIVE YOUR VIEWS BASED ON TECHNOLOGY WHETHER THE TECHNOLOGY MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CUSTOMERS OR NOT
AND THE THIRD ONE IS WHAT YOU GE UH THAT IS NOT A F FRUIT LOOK
BUT IF A PERSON DOESN'T LIKE BANANA OR ORANGE YOU ARE LIMITING HIM
UH NO UH PERSONALLY AS A MARKETING EXPERT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE WHATEVER COMPANIES THEY LAUNCH THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE SHAPE OF FRUITS
THEY GIVE A RANGE OF PRODUCTS A RANGE OF SHAPES LIKE IF WE SEE
SO YOU CAN WHAT SHAPE A PERSON WILL LIKE
SO IN THIS CASE GIVING ONLY ONE OR TWO CHOICES WE ARE LIM LIMITING OUR CUSTOMERS
YEAH ON AN AVERAGE WE CAN THINK THREE FOUR SEVENTHS MAYBE
THREE OR FOUR
UH NO SORRY IT SHOULD BE
YEAH UH THREE FOUR FOUR TWO SIX SEVEN SEVEN SEV YEAH ONE PE EXACTLY
UH
UH
UH PERSONALLY I WI UH I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF TRENDS THESE PRODUCTS ARE QUITE GOOD LIKE THESE PRODUCTS ARE IN FRUIT SHAPE
BECAUSE THAT WHA PEOPLE NOW OUR FASHION TREND SHOWS THAT PEOPLE LIKE EVERYTHING ALL F EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING ADVERTISED LIKE CLOTHES
SHOES AND EVERYTHING IS BEING ADVERTISED IN THE FORM OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES OR GETTING THEM OR SHOWING SOME ASSOCIATION WITH THEM
SO THAT IS ALSO EF THAT ALSO OUR PRODUCT MEETS THE F THE FASHION UH TRENDS OF THE MARKET
SO WE CAN IS IT FINE
YEAH AND ME ALSO LIKE THIS PRODUCT ME UH ME UH ME UH THIS MEETS ALL COMPANY STRATEGY LIKE OUR PRODUCT SHOULD BE AS PER CUSTOMERS' REQUIREMENT
AS PER LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND IT SHOULD BE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFE
SO FOUR SIX SIX
SO WE CAN SAY TWO OR ONE OKAY
SO TH SEVEN SEVEN
UH OVERALL WE ARE GETTING TWO SOMETHING BUT WE CAN ROUND IT AS TWO
UM AND I UM LIKE TO SHOW YOU THE AGENDA FOR THE MEETING I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS SENT ROUND TO ALL OF YOU
THEN THE MAIN PURPOSE IS TO SO THAT WE GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT MORE
S SO ANY ANY QUESTIONS
IS I
UM WE WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING ORIGINAL SOMETHING TRENDY AND ALSO SOMETHING USER FRIENDLY
THE METHOD THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT THAT HAS THREE COMPONENTS AS SUCH
WE'RE GOING THE WAY WE'LL DO THAT I THINK IS TO TO WORK INDIVIDUALLY INITIALLY AND THEN COME TOGETHER FOR MEETINGS TO TO WORK ON THAT
I THINK IT TH W WE'RE TALKING THE THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IS MORE YOUR
UM AREA OF THINGS WHERE YOU'LL BE WE WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT FUNCTIONS WE NEED IN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WHAT WHAT SPECIFIC THINGS IT IT HAS TO DO BUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN IS UM PERHAPS BIGGER THAN THAT AND INCLUDES THE HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE IT AND AND THAT KIND OF THING
THE PEN'S JUST UNDERNEATH IT THERE AND DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND THEN TELL EVERYONE WHAT THE F YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL ARE AND WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT TELL US YOUR NAME
IT'S GOT NO EYES
EXCELLENT AND WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S YOUR ROLE WITHIN THE TEAM
THERE'S A AN IF YOU HAVE NOT ENOUGH ROOM THERE'S AN ERASER THERE AND YOU CAN RUB IT OFF
AH IT LOOKS LIKE A DOG
THE OTHER LEGS ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND WHERE I WAS LIVING IN CAMBODIA THEY USED TO LIVE IN MY HOUSE AND THEY WERE ON THE CEILING AND THEY WOULD MAKE LITTLE GECKO NOISES IN THE EVENING
I COME FROM AUSTRALIA AND WE HAVE NASTY SNAKES
IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY SO THAT BY THE END OF THE DAY WE COME UP WITH A GREAT PRODUCT
SO I'VE JUST THOUGHT YEAH I'VE JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THIS THAT WE COULD EVEN PUT IT MUCH MORE PROFESSIONALLY AS THERE WE GO
WE'VE GOT UM WE'RE PLANNING TO SELL THESE REMOTE CONTROLS FOR LET'S MAKE THAT GO AWAY THAT MEANS WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES
AND THAT'S SELLING THEM ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET NOT JUST IN THE U. K.
UM SO TO DO THAT OUR FINANCE PEOPLE ESTIMATE THAT WE NEED PRODUCTION COSTS OF MAXIMUM TWELVE AND A HALF EURO SO THAT WE CAN REACH THAT
THIS IS LET ME JUST SKIP AHEAD TO SEE THAT'S THE LAST THING OKAY
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY FIRST IDEAS TO BOUNCE AROUND ABOUT UM WHAT WE'RE THINKING OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL
OH I HAVEN'T HAD A LOOK YET YEP
IT'S LIKE THOSE FANCY WEBSITES
THAT YOU CAN'T ACCESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO GET IN BUT THE DESIGNERS THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT
OKAY SO WE NEED TO WRAP IT UP NOW SO THAT WE CAN GO AWAY AND GET ON WITH SOME OF THIS
YOU'RE YOU'LL BE GETTING SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ONCE YOU GO BACK TO YOUR WORKSPACE BUT IM BASICALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WORKING DESIGN
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
OOH OOH THINGS FALLING EVERYWHERE
AH THE EYES ALWAYS RUIN IT
I AM THE UM I NEED MY NOTEBOOK MM OOH TOP BANANA
IT LOOKS LIKE EEYORE
IS THAT A LIZARD
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE
SO I'M KIND OF THINKING YOU KNOW LIKE THOSE PHONES THAT THEY HAVE
YOU KNOW SO SOMETHING HEADING TOWARDS THAT
SO IT'S NOT OVERLY I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT H MOST OF THE BUTTONS DO ON MY REMOTE CONTROLS
SO I FIGURE HOW MANY DO YOU NEED YOU KNOW
THEY TURN IT ON THEY WATCH CERTAIN SPECIFIED CHANNELS YOU KNOW AND THEN THEY TURN IT OFF AGAIN
THEN YOU KNOW THAT'S FINE AND YOU CAN DO IT ON THE SCREEN RATHER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE HAVING TO HAVE THOSE BUTTONS WHICH JUST CONFUSE THEM
'CAUSE LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRAIN IT'S JUST VERY LIKE THERE'S NO EXTRA BITS ON IT
THE TRAIN ON THE WEBSITE AND I DUNNO IF YOU CAN PUT IT UP ON THE THING UM BUT IT IS JUST LIKE A LONG LIKE THING USED FOR MU MOVING PEOPLE
BUT IT LOOKS REALLY PRETTY TOO
AH
UM SO MY NAME IS MAARIKA
I M I MEAN I'M NOT SO SURE BECAUSE I'M NOT SO SO VERY UM FAMILIAR WITH ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS BUT I DO LIKE DOGS
UM YEAH AND I DO LIKE DOGS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD FRIENDS TO PEOPLE AND THEY ARE LOYAL
UH I HOPE TO BE LOYAL TO THE PROJECT AND NOT TO N NOT TO UM LET PEOPLE DOING SIMILAR PROJECTS KNOW THE DETAILS OF OUR PROJECT OR SOMETHING
UM SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW
SO AT FIRST I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR UM FOR YEAH DESIGNING THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE UM
UM OF THE REMOTE CONTROL UH THEN IN THE IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STAGE I NEED TO UM COME UP WITH UH INTERFACE CONCEPT AND THEN IN THE LAST UM STAGE I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INT INFA FOR THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
AH A GECKO OKAY
IS A AR ARE THEY ALSO LIKE LIZARDS OR ARE THEY YEAH THEY ARE MM-HMM
AH
I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER WHETHER THERE IS LIKE ANY SPECIAL FEATURE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE W WANT THIS REMOTE CONTROL HAVE AS OPPOSED TO THE ALREADY EXISTING ONES
YEAH BUT UH I MEAN E EVEN THOUGH IT HAS TO BE RE ORIGINAL WE SHOULDN'T UH GO LIKE TOO FAR AWAY FROM FROM THE USUAL ONES
SEE YOU
UH I IS IT JUST UH MORE DETAIL UH AS I UNDERSTAND IT
I'VE GOT NO IDEA HOW TO DRAW A COW
SO I'M SUPPOSED TO DESIGN ALL THE DETAILS OF OF THE PRODUCT UM HO HOW IT WORKS AND WHATEVER IT'LL MM TAKE DURING THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE
WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE PERFORMED BY IT UH DURING THE UM CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
UM I'M FROM INDIA
AH OKAY
THAT WE SHOULD PROVIDE SOME FEATURES THAT ARE QUITE UNIQUE TO THIS
UH WE CAN AIM FOR I MEAN WE CAN THINK ABOUT ALL THESE LITTLE THINGS BUT WE CAN AIM FOR SOMETHING WI THAT GIVES A HIGH BATTERY LIFE
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM FOR REMOTE CONTROLS ANYWAY BATTERY LIFE UH EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU NEED TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANT THAT YOU COULD SEE IT OR NOT
OH WELL
IS IT BEST IF I SEND YOU AN EMAIL MAYBE TO LET YOU KNOW IT'S THERE
UM I'LL ACT AS SECRETARY FOR THIS MEETING AND JUST TAKE MINUTES AS WE GO THROUGH AND THEN I'LL SEND THEM TO YOU AFTER THE MEETING
UM THEN WE NEED TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE SENT TO US
I JUST SENT AT THE LAST MINUTE I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT WE CAN SEE HOW THAT AFFECTS WHAT YOU WERE YOU WERE DOING
BY THE END OF THE MEETING COME TO SOME KIND OF DECISION ON WHO OUR TARGET GROUP'S GOING TO BE AND WHAT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S THE THE MAIN GOAL IS TO COME UP WITH THOSE TWO THINGS
AND WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES TO DO THAT IN
AS UH WHO IT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TRYING TO SELL THIS THING TO YEAH
I ASSUME WE JUST PULL IT OUT
JUST BEFORE YOU START TO MAKE IT EASIER WOULD YOU THREE MIND EMAILING ME YOUR PRESENTATIONS
DO YOU HAVE ANY UM I IDEA ABOUT COSTS AT THIS POINT
OKAY SO DO YOU WANT TO
I THINK THAT HAS TO COME OUT OF THERE
YEAH I THOUGHT THOSE LAST MINUTE THINGS THEY'RE GONNA HIT YOU THE WORST
IT TA TAKES A LITTLE
OH AND HAVE YOU YOU NEED TO THEN ALSO PRESS ON YOURS FUNCTION F. EIGHT SO THE BLUE FUNCTION KEY AT THE BOTTOM AND F. EIGHT
OH IF YOU PRESS IF YOU PRESS FUNCTION AND THAT AGAIN THERE'S THERE'S USUALLY THREE MODES
ONE WHERE IT'S ONLY HERE ONE WHERE IT'S ONLY THERE AND ONE WHERE IT'S BOTH
IF I MEAN THAT WAS THE THE DIRECTIVE THAT CAME THROUGH FROM MANAGEMENT
BUT IF WE HAD A A DECENT CASE FOR THAT WE REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE VIDEO AND D. V. D. I COULD GET BACK TO THEM AND SEE
OH I'M GETTING HUNGRY
UH WE NEED TO DO THE FUNCTION KEY THING SO THAT IT COMES UP ON HERE
IS IT PLUGGED IN PROP IT'S WORKING
IT'S UM SWITCHING BETWEEN CHANNELS SORT OF RANDOMLY GOING THROUGH
OOH THAT'S A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE
IF YOU EXPLAIN IT TO US IT'LL BE FINE
THEN AGAIN I GUESS THE TH WHERE IT WAS MOST POPULAR WAS THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE BRACKET AND THE I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THEY'RE BUYING TELEVISIONS
WHEN PEOPLE ARE REALLY MOVING OUT AND THEY'VE GOT THEIR FIRST JOB AND THEY WANT THEIR NICE TOYS AND
O OH IT'S ON SORRY WE UNPLUGGED IT
USUALLY NOT A CAR AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS
YEAH AND IF WE'RE IF WE'RE TALKING TWENTY FIVE EUROS AS A PRICE THAT'S NOT UNAFFORDABLE EVEN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
YEAH IF WE TA IF WE TAKE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE BUT THAT THEN DOES IMPLY THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND INCORPORATE VOICE RECOGNITION
IS THAT GONNA HAVE A AN IMPLICATION FOR THE TECHNICAL SPECS
WITH UM BUT WITH A T. V. REMOTE IT'S GONNA BE QUITE LIMITED IF WE'RE T SAYING THE MAIN THINGS PEOPLE WANT TO DO IS ON OFF CHANNEL FIVE
AND THEN OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GET TH ANYONE WHO'S OLDER THAN THIRTY FIVE WHO WANTS TO LOOK YOUNG AND HIP AND TRENDY AND HAS THE MONEY
THAT'S BUT THEN IF YOU'RE BUYING THE REMOTE SEPARATELY BUT Y YOU COULD HAVE SOMETHING
SOME LIKE A TWO P IF YOU BOUGHT IT IN A TWO PART PACK SO ONE PART ATTACHES TO THE T. V.
UM SPECIFICATION IN MIND THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS WE WANT IT TO LOOK SIMPLE
BUT STILL HAVE THE BUTTONS SO IT'S EASY TO USE BUT ONLY THOSE KEY BUTTONS THE MAJOR BUTTONS AND THEN ONE SORT OF MENU ONE
AND THEN VOICE RECOGNITION INCLUDED AS AN OPTION UM BUT THAT OBVIOUSLY NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE WORKING OUT AS TO WHETHER IT'S REALLY FEASIBLE AND SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS WE WERE MENTIONING UM
COMPLETE OUR QUESTIONNAIRE AND SOME SORT OF SUMMARISATION WHICH Y YOU'LL GET IMMEDIATELY BY EMAIL
UM I'LL PUT THE MINUTES IN THAT PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER BUT I'LL SEND YOU AN EMAIL WHEN I DO IT SO THAT YOU KNOW
IT SHOULD BE ON YOUR DESKTOP SO ON THE YEAH
YEAH AND EMAIL THEM ROUND
SO IF YOU PUT THEM IN THERE WE'LL ALL BE ABLE TO SEE THEM AND REFER TO THEM IF WE NEED TO
UM AS TO WHERE WE'RE GOING FROM HERE YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT
ON SOMETHING CONCEPTUAL AND YOU'RE WATCHING TRENDS TO SEE HOW WE GO AND SURELY VOICE RECOGNITION'LL FALL OFF THE MAP OR SOMETHING THAT UM WE'LL KEEP KEEP OUR OPTIONS OP HMM
RIGHT ON TIME
AH THAT'S WHY IT WON'T MEET
WH WHERE I'VE GOT MY INFORMATION FROM IS A SURVEY WHERE THE USABILITY LAB UM OBSERVED REMOTE CONTROL USE WITH UM A HUNDRED SUBJECTS AND THEN THEY GAVE THEM A QUESTIONNAIRE
UM SO IT WAS ALL ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU KNOW
WHAT'S THE MOST ANNOYING THINGS ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS AND UM THE POSSIBILITY OF SPEECH RECOGNITION AND L. C. D. SCREENS IN REMOTE CONTROL
NOT THAT THEY ACTUALLY GAVE ME ANY ANSWERS ON THE L. C. D. SCREENS SO I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT BIT OUT BUT ANYWAY
UH THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT HAVE NO FASHION SENSE
UM CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS THEY DON'T MATCH THE USER BEHAVIOUR WELL AS YOU'LL SEE ON THE NEXT SLIDE
UM I DUNNO WHAT ZAPPING IS BUT
BUT YOU HAVE THAT LITTLE THING THAT COMES UP AT THE BOTTOM AND TELLS YOU WHAT'S ON
OKAY WELL I CAN SEND IT TO ALL OF YOU
UM BUT OOH WHERE'S IT GO
WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE IS VOLUME SELECTION IT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN ALL THE OTHERS
YOU KNOW SO ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT AND
THIS IS THE BIT THAT THE EMAIL MESSED UP FOR ME AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FIDDLING ABOUT WITH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THING
WATCHING T. V. THEN THAT'S THE LEAST OF YOUR PROBLEMS BUT YOU KNOW IT'S UP THERE
LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE THE COMPUTER KEYBOARDS AND YOU KEEP YOUR WRISTS UP WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT ENCOURAGES YOU WANT SOMETHING WITH AN ERGONOMIC T DESIGN THAT ENCOURAGES GOOD USE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND YOU KNOW
RIGHT UM SORRY THIS IS PINK BECAUSE I WAS COPYING AND PASTING THE TABLE AND I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO WHITE IT OUT AGAIN
YOUNGER PEOPLE TO THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE ARE QUITE LIKELY TO PAY QUITE A LOT MORE F WELL QUITE ARE QUITE LIKELY TO PAY MORE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
WHEREAS AS PEOPLE GET OLDER THEY'RE A BIT MORE SCEPTICAL ABOUT IT AND THEY'RE LESS WILLING TO TO TRY IT
SO YOU HAVE SLEEK STYLISH SOPHISTICATED YOU KNOW SO SOMETHING THAT'S YOU KNOW A BIT COOL
UM THERE'S A THERE'S AN IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE USE WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE FILLING UP YOUR HOME YOU KNOW
MY FLATMATE AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS ON THE WAY INTO UNI THIS MORNING AND I WAS LIKE I NEED TO GET ONE FOR EVERYTHING
'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT YOUR REMOTE CONTROL BEEPING EVERY FIVE MINUTES 'CAUSE YOU YOU'D THEN DELIBERATELY LOSE IT BY THROWING IT OUT THE WINDOW OR SOMETHING
CA
DO YOU WANT ME TO
UM SO I MEAN LIKE IT IS AN AGE GROUP TO TARGET REALLY I THINK
NO DO TOTALLY
S SO
Y YOU'D MAYBE NEED A CODE WORD
SO LIKE WHEN YOU SAY CHANGE EXCEPT THAT'S BEING SAID QUITE A LOT ON T. V. SO MAYBE LIKE YOU KNOW REMOTE
ALTHOUGH I ONLY WATCH CHARMED SO REALLY I WOULDN'T KNOW BUT LIKE SO YOU'D JUST SAY REMOTE FIVE YOU KNOW REMOTE TEN REMOTE ONE TWO NINE
SO THEN IT WOULD BE YOU'D BE WATCHING CHARMED AND THEN THE SKY ADVERT WOULD COME ON AND IT WOULD CHANGE TO SKY
DO YOU NOT THINK THAT DEFEATS THE OBJECT OF HAVING VOICE RECOGNITION ON A REMOTE CONTROL THOUGH
YEAH YEAH I SUPPOSE NEARER TO YOU BUT A B LIKE IF YOU HAVE SURROUND SOUND THEN
OH SO Y YOU WANT OUR UM POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS IN THERE HEY
UM UM WI ON ON A WHAT
OH PROJECT PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH YEAH YEAH OKAY
OH I
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING I DON'T SEE ANYTHING ON MY COMPUTER NOW
IT'S NOT UM FOR THE FOR THE WHOLE UM PERIOD OF THE UM ALL THE PROJECT BUT IT'S JUST AT TH AT THIS VERY MOMENT
UM UH MY METHOD WAS UM TO LOOK AT UM OTHER UM REMOTE CONTROLS
UH SO MOSTLY JUST BY SEARCHING ON THE WEB AND TO SEE WHAT UM FUNCTIONALITY THEY USED
AND THEN UM AFTER HAVING GOT THIS INSPIRATION AND HAVING COMPARED WHAT I FOUND ON THE WEB UM JUST TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE DE WHAT THE USER REALLY NEEDS AND WHAT UM WHAT THE USER MIGHT DESIRE AS ADDITIONAL UH FUNCTIONALITIES
UH THEN THE USER WOULD LIKE TO SWITCH THE CHANNEL UM FOR EXAMPLE JUST M CHANGING TO THE NEXT CHANNEL TO TO FLIP THROUGH ALL ALL OF THE POSSIBLE CHANNELS
UM UM I ALS OKAY
UM UM AMONG THE FINDINGS I FOUND THAT M M MOST OF THE CURR MM PRESENTLY AVAILABLE REMOTE CONTROLS ALSO INCLUDE OTHER MM FUNCTIONALITIES UM IN THEIR DESIGN
BUT ACCORDING TO THE LAST MINUTE UPDATE UM ACTUALLY UM WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ALL THIS COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS ADDED TO OUR DESIGN
THE MUST HAVE BUTTONS WOULD BE ON OFF AND THEN THE CHANNEL NUMBERS AND THEN UM THE ONE THAT ALLOWS US TO GO TO THE NEXT OR THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL
BUT THEN UM OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES UM COULD BE JUST UH THERE COULD BE A MENU BUTTON AND YOU COULD CHANGE THINGS ON THE SCREEN THEN
UM FOR EXAMPLE BRIGHTNESS AND MM SIMILAR FUNCTIONS COULD BE JUST UM DONE THROUGH THE MENU
AND YEAH THE LAST QUESTION I HAD ABOUT WHETHER WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE N UH MORE FUNCTIONALITIES THE ANSWER WAS ALREADY NO BECAUSE OF THE LAST MINUTE UPDATE
BUT THIS WOULD BE REALLY KIND OF I THINK A LOT OF LEARNING FOR THE USER AND AND I MEAN THE USER JUST WANTS TO GET UM GET A RESULT UM QUICKLY
I THINK I TH I WOULD I WOULD THINK THE PUT THE BUTTONS BUT IF IF YOU HAVE OTHER MM PROPOSALS UM
UH AM I GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
YEAH THIS THIS IS NOT UNAFFORDABLE BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHETHER PEOPLE NEED IT WHETHER THEY DO HAVE A T. V. TO USE ITS FULL
THE S THE STU YEAH AND THE REMOTE CONTROL MIGHT NOT YEAH IT MIGHT NOT EVEN FUNCTION WITH THE OLD T. V.
OR W MAYBE WE CAN JUST KIND OF UH UH
AN
YEAH W WELL NOW THE V THE VOICE RECOGNITION IF IF IT WORKS WONDERFULLY W WE COULD POSSIBLY DO AWAY WITH ALL BUTTONS
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE JUST SO USED TO BUTTONS AND UM YEAH IT'S IT'S KIND OF SAFER SO WE WE NEED BOTH
YEAH BUT M BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
REMOTE CONTROL ISN'T AS CLOSE TO YOU YOU PROBABLY MIGHT JUST JUST UH SPEAK INTO IT AND AND THE T. V. WOULD BE ALREADY FURTHER AWAY
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL IS STILL SOMETHING YOU KEEP N NEAR YOURSELF
NO BUT I I I WAS JUST DEFENDING THE THE FACT WHY WHY WE WANT TO KEEP THE REMOTE CONTROL CLOSE TO US
DID YOU FIND IT
OH SO SO WE'LL JUST PUT THEM I THERE WE WE YEAH W WE WON'T EVEN OKAY
SORRY BUT UM THE NEXT MEETING UM ARE WE GOING TO HAVE IT UM RIGHT AFTER LUNCH OR SHALL WE PREPARE OUR
OKAY SEE YOU
UH OKAY 'KAY
UH OKAY
SO N UH WITH UH WITH REGARD TO THE UH WORKING DESIGN OF THIS UH UH REMOTE CONTROL UH I'VE IDENTIFIED UM A FEW BASIC UH COMPONENTS OF THE REMOTE AND UH SE UH FROM THE DESIGN
THIS IS THE METHOD THAT UH I'LL MOSTLY BE FOLLOWING IN MY UM IN MY UH ROLE
UH WE'LL THEN INTEGRATE THIS INTO THE PRODUCT DESIGN AT A TECHNICAL LEVEL AND UH BASICALLY UPDATE AND COME UP WITH A NEW DESIGN SO IT'S A CYCLICAL PROCESS
UM SO BASICALLY UH THE AS I TOLD YOU THE IDENTIFICATION OF HOW THE REMOTE CONTROL WORKS AND WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS PARTS TO IT
HOW HOWEVER OUR OUR REMOTE CONTROL WOULD ONLY BE DEALING UH WITH THE THE USE FOR TELEVISION IN ORDER TO KEEP THINGS SIMPLE
UM ALSO THE MANAGEMENT WANTS THAT UM OUR DESIGN SHOULD BE UNIQUE UH IT SO IT SHOULD INCORPORATE UM COLOUR AND THE SLOGAN UH THAT OUR COMPANY UM HAS IT AS ITS STANDARD
OKAY SO HE HE HERE IS A FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO IF UH IF THIS IS OUR ENERGY SOURCE AND THIS IS A CELL UH IT COMMUNICATES UH IT FEEDS ENERGY INTO THE
INTO THE CHIP WHICH BASICALLY FINDS OUT H UH HOW HOW TO DO EVERYTHING
UM WHICH THEN SO THE OUTPUT OF THE CHIP IS AN INFRARED BIT CODE
WHICH IS THEN COMMUNICATED TO THE REMOTE SITE WHICH H HAS AN INFRARED RECEIVER
UM THE THERE CAN BE UH A BULB HERE OR SOMETHING TO INDICATE WHETHER THE REMOTE IS ON OR COMMUNICATING
WHATEVER NEW FUNCTIONS THAT WE NEED TO DO UM MAKE THE CHIP MORE COMPLICATED UH AND BIGGER BASICALLY
UM SO I IN MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES UM I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN KE KEEP THE DESIGN AS SIMPLE AND CLEAR AS POSSIBLE
THIS WOULD UH HELP US UH TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AT A FUTURE POINT OF TIME
SO THAT OUR UM UH REMOTE CONTROL DOES NOT BECOME OUTDATED SOON AND IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH MOT MOST UH TELEVISIONS
SO SO THA YEAH WE DEFINITELY NEED TO OPERATE WITHIN OUR CONSTRAINTS
BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY I I DO NOT HAVE ANY DATA SO UH I JUST IDENTIFIED THE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS FOR THAT
IT'LL COME UP IT UM UH NO SIGNAL
YEAH YEAH IT SAYS SOMETHING NOW ADJUSTING
SO IN THE U USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS UH UH UH WE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE BASIC BUTTONS THAT WE DO WANT
UH HOW WE GO ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THOSE BUTTON WE WILL NOT IDENTIFY OR I MEAN IN WE CAN COMPLETELY DO AWAY WITH BUTTONS AND UH HAVE SOME KIND OF A FANCY USER INTERFACE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO WELL WE CAN PROBABLY WAIT UNTIL T WE HAVE MORE KNOWLEDGE ON THAT
UH I IF THE IF THE COSTS ALLOW WE CAN HAVE LIKE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY AND UH WITH UM BECAUSE WE DO WANT SOMETHING FANCY AND FASHIONABLE AS WELL
I THINK ONE OF THE VERY INTERESTING THINGS THAT CAME UP IN UM UH KA KATE CAT CAT'S UH PRESENTATION WAS UM UH THIS THIS ISSUE OF UH UH LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION BEING MORE POPULAR WITH UH YOUNGER PEOPLE
SO IF WE NEED TO HAVE A TARGET GROUP UM THEN UH I THINK AS FAR AS THE M MOTTO OF OUR COMPANY IS CONCERNED
BU BUT BUT THE SURVEY DID SAY THAT F THINGS LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION ARE MORE POPULAR WITH THEM SO IF YOU WANT TO PUT IN SOMETHING STYLISH
THEN UH TH IT'LL CERTAINLY BE MORE POPULAR WITH THIS I YE WITH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE AS COMPARED TO OLDER PEOPLE YEAH
THAT'S ALRIGHT IF YOU CAN JUST LOOK IT UP ON YOUR COMPUTER WH UH UM PEOPLE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE
UH HOW POPULAR WAS SO IT WAS STI STILL STILL QUITE POPULAR AMONGST THEM
SO YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO B
SO MM UH ARE ARE ARE
UM I WAS HAVING A A GENERAL OUTLOOK ON UM M MOST LIKE SOPHISTICATED FEATURES
BUT HOW FREQUENTLY DO WE USE IT ANYWAY AND UM UH H HO HOW GOOD IS IT YOU KNOW UH VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARES ARE STILL QUITE UH
SO WHERE EXACTLY IS THIS I
AH OKAY
CON COMPONENTS OH
SO UM I SENT YOU THE AGENDA IT WAS ON THE IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS
UM AND AT THE END OF THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS WHAT YOU'VE COME UP WITH SO THAT WE CAN MAKE A DECISION ON THE KEY REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS
UH YEAH
UH-HUH HI YEAH
IT'S LIKE THE LIKE YOU SAID NO
THAT'S OVER ON THE INTERFACE IF IF YOU COULD PUT
IT IT IS ALSO QUITE NICE THOUGH TO TO HAVE SOMETHING HERE SO YOU DON'T INTERRUPT THE PICTURE ON THE SCREEN SO IF YOU'RE WATCHING SOMETHING
TO SOME DEGREE
YOU CAN HAVE IT AS LIKE A LITTLE BALL TO BOUNCE THAT FLIPS OPEN
YEAH RUB OFF SOME OF THOSE
I THINK THA
I'D I'D KEEP IT ON
YEAH AND GIVEN THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE SPONGY MATERIAL PREFERENCES I HA WOULD THINK MAYBE RUBBER OR PLASTIC IS MORE
DO WE NEED THEM ON AS BUTTONS OR DO WE NEED THEM AS L. C. D.
EFFECTIVELY IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CURVED ON ONE SIDE AND FLAT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT YOU FOLDED IT IN HALF
TH THAT WOULD BE ON ONE SIDE UH-HUH
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE AFTER
WE CAN'T HAVE SOLAR PANELS WITH RUBBER SO
SHALL WE GO FOR IF WE'RE GOING FOR RUBBER WE THINK UH ON AS OUR CASE AND THEN
I THINK IF WE CAN IF WE CAN INCLUDE THEM AT NOT TOO MUCH EXTRA COST THEN I'D PUT THEM IN BUT IF IT'S
IT'S FROM THE COMPANY SO
AND THE CASE IS CURVED ON ONE SIDE BUT THEN FLAT FLAT SO IT'S FLIPPED INTO EACH OTHER
CAN I PULL THE THING OUT THE BACK OF YOUR COMPUTER
UH OH NOW I'VE GONE TOO FAR
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
THE ADVANCED CHIP AND A CURVED ON ONE SIDE CASE WHICH IS FOLDED IN ON ITSELF UM MADE OUT OF RUBBER AND
I THINK IT'S ON THE
ON THE
AND AS WELL AS THAT
THE TWO DESIGNERS ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON OUR PROTOTYPE FOLLOWING THOSE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WE'VE JUST COME UP WITH USING MODELLING CLAY AND YOU WILL GET EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR PERSONAL COACH
IS THAT ALL OKAY
AND ANYONE WHO HASN'T PUT THEIR THEIR PRESENTATION IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER IT WOULD BE GOOD JUST SO IN CASE WE HAVE TO REFER TO IT
Y AH NOBODY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU
DOES THAT MEAN LIKE A WIND UP ONE
SONY ERICSSON MOBILE PHONES HAS IT
NO IT'S GOT ITS LITTLE CAMERA IN THERE PLUG IT IN
OH IT'S LIKE THE IPOD
AND Y YOU GO ROUND AND I IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT AND YOU SPIN ROUND AND IT YEAH
DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE LOOKIN IF YOU'RE TH SCROLLING THROUGH THE A. TO Z. OF YOUR MUSIC AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AT T.
THEN IT'S A LOT FASTER THAN THE WHEEL BUT YOU'VE GOT A LOT LESS CONTROL OVER IT
OKAY I'VE PUT THE COPY OF THE PRESENTATION IN UM THE YEAH
UM SO WHAT I DID WAS TO SEARCH THE INTERNET TO COME UP WITH MARKET TRENDS AND YOU KNOW WHAT USERS ARE GONNA BE WANTING IN THE THE NEAR FUTURE
NOW THE FIRST ASPECT IS APPARENTLY TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SECOND ASPECT WHICH IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE THIRD A ASPECT
I MEAN WE'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE UM TELEWEST BOXES AND YOU PUT THE NUMBER IN THE REMOTE AND THEN YOU WAIT AND THEN IT GOES TO THE T. V. AND THEN YOU WAIT
AND YOU COULD JUST SEE THAT ON THE REMOTE RATHER THAN
SO YOU GOT YOUR BUTTONS ONE TO NINE YOUR ON AND OFF AND YOUR VOLUME ON THAT AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO MESS ABOUT WITH IT
YEAH SO THAT KIND OF DECIDES YOUR WHOLE CHIP THING
UM SO THESE WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FEATURE FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE
SO I MEAN I'M TAKING THIS TO MEAN YOU KNOW CURVINESS
YEAH BIT OF ASYMMETRY AND STUFF
BECAUSE I MEAN IF YOU THINK MOST PEOPLE USE THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH THEIR RIGHT HAND HA RIGHT HANDS SO YOU WANNA YOU CURVE IT SO THAT IT'S SUITABLE FOR USE WITH THE RIGHT HAND
YEAH BUT I MEAN Y YOU HAVE TO
IT IT DEPENDS ON THE WHOLE ERGONOMICS OF IT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE HOW YOU PUT YOUR HANDS SO Y IT'S THE LEAST MOVEMENT BASICALLY
I I HAVE ONE OF THOSE S SLIDEY PHONES AND I MEAN THE BACK IS ESSENTIALLY STRAIGHT BUT IT'S CURVY SO
BESIDES YOU HAVE FOUR SIDES TO A THING SO I MEAN DOES CURVED ONE SIDE MEAN ONE SIDE IS STRAIGHT AND
UH IT'S IT'S MORE ABOUT THE PROTECTING THE L. C. D. WHICH I THINK IS WHERE IT CAME FROM
BUT NO MY RESEARCH DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE ALL THE PICTURES 'CAUSE I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO WITH MY TIME
IT JUST M DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE I THINK IS THE THING WITH WOOD
IT'S IT'S THE I THINK THE THING IS SO IF SOMEONE JUST WANTS TO TURN ON THEIR T. V. AND PUT ON A CHANNEL
I THINK IS THE THE THE ISSUE THERE
E EITHER OR
I WOULD SAY THE S THE S THE SPINNING GOES AT A HIGH SPEED TO TH TO THE SCROLLING WHEEL
SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO BE GOING SO FAST OR NOT
BUT I MEAN THE THE THING WITH THIS WHOLE IF Y YOU'RE PLANNING ON MAKING IT OUT OF RUBBER
ON THE BASIS THAT IT'S SPONGY THEN I'M NOT SURE HOW WELL A SCROLLING WHEEL WOULD WORK
'CAUSE I KNOW LIKE WE'RE GOING BACK TO IPODS AGAIN N THE WHOLE SPINNING WHEEL
YEAH I THINK THE SPINNING WHEEL IS DEFINITELY VERY NOW
SO YOU COULD HAVE LIKE I MEAN I SUPPOSE VEGETABLE COLOURS WOULD BE ORANGE AND GREEN AND SOME REDS AND UM MAYBE PURPLE AND THAT AND THEN YOU'D PICK THE BUTTONS IN COMPANY COLOURS TO TO MATCH WITH IT
YEAH OKAY SO WE LOSE THAT I THINK
SORRY DO YOU WANT ME TO
WHAT DOES UM I. C. S. MEAN
SO UM ACTUALLY THAT COULD LIKE REALLY CUT DOWN YOUR THING SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR OUTSIDE WHICH IS LIKE MINIMALIST
AND THEN YOU OPEN IT UP AND YOU'VE GOT A SCREEN AND A SPINNING WHEEL WHICH YOU CAN INCORPORATE BUTTONS INTO
UM SO YOU'VE STILL NOT GOT LIKE A LOT OF STUFF IN THE
YOU'VE MAYBE GOT YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU'RE MODELLING ON IPOD YOU'VE GOT FIVE BUTTONS AND A WHEEL
AND FOUR OF THE BUTTONS ARE IN THE WHEEL AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE LITTLE BIT INSIDE THE WHEEL YEAH
UM TO BE HONEST ACTUALLY I MENTIONED SOME SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH WHICH COULD FIT ON THE ON THE THIS TALK UM THIS TIME
I M I MENTIONED THEM ALREADY IN THE PREVIOUS TALK
SO UM YEAH THIS TIME UM I MIGHT NOT HAVE THEM ON THE SLIDES BUT I I CAN JUST MENTION THEM AW AGAIN
SO UM I THOUGHT UM I WOULD ALSO INCLUDE THE DEFINITION OF USER INTERFACE UM SO IT'S THE ASPECTS OF A OF OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM OR PROGRAMME WHICH CAN BE SEEN UH BY THE USER UM AND AND WHICH UH THE MECHANISMS THAT THE USER USES TO CONTROL ITS OPERATION AND INPUT DATA
SO THIS WOULD P INCLUDES THINGS LIKE SHAPE AND SIZE AND BUTTONS AND UM VOICE RECOGNITION AS WELL AND COLOUR AND SO ON
UM UM THE METHOD I EMPLOYED THIS TIME WAS A AGAIN HAVING A LOOK TO RELATED PRODUCTS AND MAINLY ON THE INTERNET AND THEN UM ANALYSE THEM UH FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF USER FEN FRIENDLINESS AND ALSO UM WHETHER THEIR APPEARANCE WAS WAS PLEASANT
THEY'RE JUST SO FULL OF BUTTONS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY UH HARD TO FIND THE ONES YOU YOU REALLY UM WANT TO USE AND UM AND IT'S JUST CONFUSING
IT TAKES Y KNOW TIME TO LEARN
AH NO PLEASE
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE SMALLEST AND AND WITH WITH LEAST UH WITH THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF BUTTONS AS WELL
AND I WOULD SAY EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF SOME OF THEM IS KIND OF NOT SO NICE
OUR OWN COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED A NEW IN USER INTERFACE UH WAIT NO THIS IS NOT THE ONE
UM S ANOTHER NEW DEVELOPMENT IS A SCROLL BUTTON WHICH WAS ALSO TH ALSO ALREADY MENTIONED
BUT IT'S ONCE ONCE THE MM UM GADGET UH RECOGNISES UH THE VOICE OF THE SPEAKER
YOU CAN PICK UP THE REMOTE CONTROL AND SAY SOMETHING TO IT LIKE HELLO AND IT SAYS SOME HELLO AND YOUR NAME OR WHATEVER
I WASN'T COMPLETELY SURE MYSELF BUT I THINK IT'S JUST LIKE UM IT'S IT'S A WHEEL IT'S LIKE NOT SEPARATE BUTTONS
LOOK THIS ONE HERE
BUT I'M I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHETHER WHETHER YOU CAN REALLY TURN IT ROUND IT'S LIKE YOU PRESS THIS OR THIS OR
UH
OKAY WE DECIDED TO INCLUDE VOICE RECOGNITION SO TO HAVE THE STANDARD UH MAJOR BUTTONS LIKE ON
I THOUGHT IT COULD BE FOR FOR VOICE LIKE I DUNNO IT MM LIKE ON A UM I LIKE IT USED TO BE ON WALKMANS OR SOMETHING
THERE IS UH I THINK THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE COULDN'T USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
N WOOD IS I CAN'T N HOW DO YOU UH I MEAN YOU CAN'T KEEP IT REALLY SMALL UH YOU CAN'T MAKE IT LIKE THIN AND
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO YOU N YOU NEED TO PUT ALL THE TECHNOLOGY IN
SO I MEAN IF THE CASE YOU ADD THE CASE AND IT IT BECOMES A BIT BULKY WI MM MM YEAH
IT'S FASTER WITH A M YEAH AND W IF WE DIS AND WHEN WE S UM DISCUSSED THAT WE MIGHT LIKE THIS FLIPPING OPEN THING
THEN I MEAN Y YOU CAN USE IT AS A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL BUT IF YOU DO WANT TO USE L. C. D.
YEAH BUT N I I'M NOT COMPLETELY UM COMPLETELY CLEAR UH I YEAH ABOUT THE SPINNING WHEEL
AH BUT I MEAN YOU CAN
YEAH I UM I THINK SO TOO I MEAN THE CASE WOULD BE YEAH THE CASE WOULD BE RUBBER AND THE THE BUTTONS
YEAH I THINK WE UM IT WAS A A REQUIREMENT THAT WE USE OUR UM TH THE COLOURS OF OUR COMPANY
SO WOULD IT BE LIKE YELLOW GREY AND BLACK OR SOMETHING OR
SO W W WOULD WITH HAVE THE SPINNING WHEEL INSIDE WITH THE L. C. D. OR WOULD IT BE ON THE OUTER
RIGHT S SO I HAVEN'T MADE A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION YEAH I I THOUGHT I'LL USE THE WHITEBOARD INSTEAD
SO BASICALLY I'LL START OFF BY UH I THOUGHT I'LL USE THE WHITEBOARD BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS THAT WE CAN START UM UH RUBBING OFF THE OPTIONS THAT WE DO NOT REQUIRE AND PUTTING IN THE OPTIONS THAT UH ARE M OR HIGHLIGHTING OR UNDERLINING THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OKAY SO W WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS SO THIS IS THE OUTSIDE OF THE REMOTE RIGHT
THIS BASICALLY SENDS INFORMATION TO A TR UH TRANSISTOR HERE WHICH THEN UH SENDS THE INFORMATION TO AN L. E. D. DEVICE HERE
IF YOU FLIP THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD AND THIS IS TH THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT HERE UH EVERYTHING ELSE IS KIND OF
SO YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE A PARTICULAR BUTTON ATTACHES TO A PARTICULAR PLACE ON THE P. C. B. AND UH ON PRESSING THIS BUTTON I A CIRCUIT COMPLETES
WHICH GOES GOES OUT THROUGH THERE
YOU CAN GE GET THEM PRINTED AS YOU WANT TO SO W WE CAN HAVE A CONFIGURATION UM IRRESPECTIVE OF THE COST THE WAY WE WANT TO HAVE
UH THES THESE ARE THE KIND DIFFERENT KIND OF BATTERIES THAT THE COMPANY MAKES RIGHT
SO UH I DON'T KNOW IF EVEN IF YOU WANT TO CONSIDER THIS BUT THESE ARE THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THE COMPANY MAKES
SO TH THEY'LL THEY'LL SINCE UH THEY'LL COME INTERNALLY FROM THE COMPANY THEY'LL BE EAS UH CHEAPER UH ALL THESE OPTIONS
BUT AS SOON AS YOU PICK IT UP IT MOVES AND THEN AGAIN IT UH RE RECHARGES OR SOMETHING
THESE ARE THE THREE OPTIONS RIGHT
YEAH WOULD IT BE FLAT ON BOTH THE SIDES WOULD BE CURVED FROM ONE SIDE OR WHATEVER UH THERE WERE DIFFERENT KIND OF SUPPLEMENTS AVAILABLE
UM THE SO UH WE CAN USE EVEN UM A CERTAIN TITANIUM IS ALSO USED UH IN THE COMPANY TO MAKE UH UH SOME SPACE DESIGN EQUIPMENT
BUT UH IT CANNOT BE USED ON A DOUBLE CURVED SURFACE
UH OKAY THE INTERFACE OPTIONS NOW
WE CAN HAVE PUSH BUTTONS LIKE MOST REMOTES DO AND OUR COMPANY IS AN EXPERT IN MAKING PUSH BUTTONS
OOH
UH SO TH THIS CONCERNS FIRS FIRST OF ALL THE THE CHIPS I I SHOWED YOU AT UH SO THERE'S THERE'S A CHIP BEHIND THIS ONE RIGHT
AS WE GO DOWN OBVIOUSLY
AS SOON AS YOU PRESS A BUTTON IT IT MM UH GIVE GIVES YOU FEEDBACK ONE FIVE OR WHATEVER
YEAH ON
OKAY SO TH THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY NOW NOW UH I THINK THAT UH WE CAN INTEGRATE UM UH YOU KNOW
UH SORRY UH CAN YOU GO BACK FOR A SECOND
UH OH YEAH ARE TH
SO UM UH MAYBE UH AS YOU'RE DISCUSSING THINGS IS IT OKAY IF WE JUST UH KEEP HIGHLIGHTING THINGS HERE
SO MM UH SO IT YEAH SO PROBABLY VOICE RECOGNITION IS IS KIND OF IMPORTANT RIGHT
UM AND AN YEAH
W UH L. C. D. S ARE BASICALLY FOR FEEDBACK RIGHT TO THE USER WHO'S PRESSING BUTTONS
MAARIKA YEAH
SO UM WE COULD USE TITANIUM WOOD OR PLASTIC UH OR UH
YEAH TAP IT ON THE DESK YEAH
OR OR CURVED AT ONE END AND FLAT ON THE TOP BECAUSE I I'M NOT SURE IF IT IS FLAT ON BOTH BOTH THE SIDES
THEN HO HOW MUCH EASY WOULD IT BE TO REACH FOR BUTTONS ETCETERA
YEAH SINGE SINGLE SIDE CURVED OR DOUBLE SIDE CURVED DOES NOT SAY TOO MUCH DOES IT
DI NOW DID IT SAY ANYWHERE IN YOUR RESEARCH MATERIAL ABOUT THIS SLIDING STUFF UH BECAUSE UM ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE
UH EITH EITHER WE HAVE UH A FLAT SURFACED UH CASE OR A CURVED SURFACED CASE
LET'S LET'S TRY TO R RUB OFF THINGS AND YEAH SO UM HAND DYNAMOS ARE DEFINITELY OUT RIGHT
UM KINETIC ENERGY DOES SEEM TO HAVE SOME KIND OF UH UH APPEAL BUT UH
AS AGAINST A WATCH WHICH CONSTANTLY KEEPS MOVING THIS THIS THING WILL HAVE TO BE TAPPED EVERY TIME WHICH WHICH MIGHT BE VERY FRUSTRATING FOR THE USER
UM THE FLAT CO COMPLETELY FLAT CASE IS DEFINITELY OUT RIGHT
YEAH IF IF IT IS REALLY THIN IF IT IS REALLY THIN IT IT'S LIKELY TO BREAK IT'S IT'S MUCH MORE UH
YEAH OKAY WOOD IS OUT
RIGHT SO UH THE THE PUSH BUTTONS IS IS OUR EXPERTISE UH IN THE INDUSTRY
OH IF IF WE HAVE L. C. D. DISPLAYS THAT OPENS UP A WHOLE WORLD YOU KNOW
IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY THEN MM YOU CAN SELECT ALMOST EVERYTHING ON THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
OR ON THE L. C. D. WE CAN YOU KNOW
OKAY SO BUTTONS DEFINITELY IN BUT OH SHALL WE UH TRY TO DRAW A PREC UM
UH OKAY
I'LL RUB THAT OUT
UM BUT WE STILL NEED TO TE THINK ABOUT THE COLOUR OF OUR REMOTE AS SUCH YOU KNOW JUST KEEP IT BLACK OR
UM OKAY IF YOU G GO OVER TO UH THE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
UH SINCE WE'RE HAVING L. C. D. S THERE THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE'RE WILL BE ABLE TO UM WHAT WE DO NEED TO CONSIDER
BUT SINCE L. C. D. S SEEMS TO BE UH A DEFINITE YES SO IT SEEMS TO BE ONE AREA WHERE WE WOULD WANT TO SPEND
OH IS OH THE CONSTRAINT WAS UH YEAH
I MEAN A ALTHOUGH IT DOES SEEM UH INTERESTING
UH OKAY SO R WE UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER NOW THAT UH THE THE SPEAKER IS FOR THE FEEDBACK RIGHT
IT IT SAYS UH THE THINGS THAT YOU TYPE IN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO
YE YEAH WE WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT IT UM
YEAH OKAY SO SO TH THIS IS IN AS WELL THEN THE SAMPLE SPEAKER
UH UM WE WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING IN FOR VOICE RECOGNITION AS WELL AS L. C. D. S MM
THEN I NEED TO SAY SOME ST A FEW THINGS ABOUT FINANCE 'CAUSE WE HAVE TO CHECK THAT IT'S WITHIN THE FINANCE CRITERIA
S
IS THAT RIGHT
Y OR YOU COULD HAVE IT SO YOU ON THE WHEEL IF YOU
TEST IT OUT
OKAY SO MAYBE IF WE GO ON TO EVALUATION CRI CRITERIA AND THEN WE'LL THERE I SUSPECT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A COUPLE OF MINOR FINANCE ISSUES
BUT UM WE'LL SE I'M SURE WE CAN GET AROUND THEM SOMEHOW
WE'LL JUST SEND ALL OF OUR MANUFACTURING TO
SO FOR EACH OF THESE WE NEED TO GIVE IT A ONE TO SEVEN
IS THAT RIGHT
AH OKAY
I THINK IT'S PRETTY GOOD BUT WE MIGHT WANT TO FLAG IT FOR MANAGEMENT THEY WANT MIGHT WANT TO UM
NO WE'RE GONNA PUT IT LIKE WE'VE GOT TH THERE'S THE LOCATOR DOT
I'D SAY SIX 'CAUSE THE I MEAN THE THE STANDARD LAYOUT FOR NUMBERS IS THREE THREE THREE AND ONE RATHER THAN THE WAY YOU'VE GOT IT
I REALLY LIKE THE WAY YOU HAVE IT BUT IT'S NOT THE IMMEDIATE THING THAT YOU'RE USED TO
AH THAT'S THE SECOND ONE
SO YOU MUST HAVE CHANGED IT ON THIS ONE WHERE IT'S GOT SCORE BUT NOT ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE
BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL TECHNOLOGY NONE OF IT IS ACTUALLY NEW
BUT DO YEAH YEAH
YEAH ONE
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT OR DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING MORE
UM I STARTED FILLING IT IN BUT OF COURSE THESE ARE PROVISIONAL SO WE HAVE TO GO DOWN
NO HAND DYNAMO RIGHT
ONE SIMPLE BATTERY
NO KINETIC ENERGY NO SOLAR
UM SINGLE CURVED SURFACE SO THAT WE CAN FOLD IT
YEAH LET'S LEAVE IT AS ZERO 'CAUSE IT'S EASY
S FOR THE MUTING
SO AS WE CAN SEE THAT'S WAY TOO EXPENSIVE DOWN HERE
WHAT ELSE DOES IT NEED
YEAH 'CAUSE THE SAMPLE SPEAKER WAS I THINK MORE COMPLICATED THEN JUST A BEEPING THING
WE DECIDED 'CAUSE IT'S NOT ON OUR LIST
THE SCROLL WHEEL IS ON THE SIDE
WE'RE POINT THREE OVER AT THE MOMENT
IT'S NOTHING N
OH LOOK WE'RE WAY UNDER BUDGET AND WE'LL MAKE HUGE PROFITS AND WE'LL ALL GET BONUSES
WE WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND THEN I'LL TAKE I CAN SEND IT BACK TO MANAGEMENT AND SAY WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE ABOUT THE COLOUR
SO DID WE LOSE UM ON OUR EVALUATION CRITERIA AS A RESULT OF DOING THAT
THA
UM WE NEED WE'VE JUST GOT ABOUT TEN MINUTES OR SO LEFT OF THE MEETING
SO IT WOULD BE GOOD IF WE COULD JUST HAVE A LITTLE TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT ITSELF AND HOW IT WENT
IDEAS
YEAH YOU COULD TAKE IT TO LECTURES AND JUST WRITE STUFF DOWN AND HAVE IT PRINTED OUT WHEN YOU GOT BACK TO THE OFFICE
DO YOU THINK THEY'D NOTICE IF ONE WENT
'CAUSE THE I FIND THAT THE PROBLEM WITH POWERPOINT OFTEN IS THAT IT'S SO STATIC AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT ONCE YOU'RE IN THERE YEP
BETTER THAN THAT THAN THE BANANA
SAY THEIR BIT
WERE THERE ANY WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU FOUND DIFFICULT OR ANYTHING
WE'RE JUST TOO TOO EFFICIENT AND YOU SHOULD NEVER DRAG A MEETING ON JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE EXTRA TIME
THANK YOU TEAM
OH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
IS IT TO SCALE OR DO YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE IT A BIT SMALLER
AH YOU DID GET THAT IN THEN MM-HMM
OH THE THING WE FORGOT WAS LIKE A MUTE BUTTON
ON THE WHEEL LIKE IF YOU HOLD THE WHEEL DOWN THEN IT WILL MUTE
YEAH OH WE HOLD THE REMOTE
OH BUT IT IT DOES FEEL ALL COLD AND SLIMY
UM SO WE'RE GONNA BE USING A SEVEN POINT SCALE SO ONE IS YOU KNOW YES
IT TOTALLY MEETS WITH THAT REQUIREMENT AND SEVEN IS NO IT REALLY DOESN'T WE NEED TO GO BACK AND START AGAIN
UM YOU KNOW SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE EACH ONE AND LIKE SO IT WAS ABOUT GOING BACK TO THE START AND SAYING OH YEAH
WE DID MANAGE TO DO THAT OR OH NO WE REALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT
OH WE'RE ALL SO PROUD OF THE
COULD OH NO YOU CAN'T WHILST THAT'S UP THERE
OKAY UM UH WHAT I'VE DONE ON THE NEXT PAGE IS I'VE SET IT UP SO WE JUST PUT THE MARKS IN
SO IT WORKS LIKE A MOBILE PHONE FLIPPING BUT Y YOU KNOW AS LONG AS THAT SIDE'S FLAT THAN THAT WILL WORK
ARE ARE WE ADMITTING DEFEAT ON C. OR ARE WE SAYING WE'RE GONNA STICK A LOCATOR ON THE T. V.
COOL SO THAT MEANS YOU NEED A THAT DOES MEAN YOU NEED A LITTLE SPEAKER ON IT THOUGH DOESN'T IT
YEAH AND I MEAN D
SO SHOULD WE MAYBE SAY F A FIVE AND SAY IT IS INTUITIVE BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
SO WE GIVE THAT ONE A FIVE YOU THINK
SORRY IT'S REALLY HARD TO WRITE ON THOSE
I JUST WENT A BIT MAD DIDN'T I
UM I WOULD GUESS THIS COMES BACK FROM THIS WHOLE B. THING LINKS IN HERE SO POSSIBLY FOR LEFT HANDED
I USED TO SEND FIFTY TEXTS A DAY YOU KNOW AND I NEVER GOT REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY FROM THAT
NOT COUNTING ANYTHING WE'D STILL BE IN BUDGET
YEAH THE SAMPLE SENSOR WILL HAVE TO GO 'CAUSE THAT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE THING ON THERE
SEE I WAS GONNA SAY THE SCROLL WHEEL PUSHBUTTON THING 'CAUSE
DIDN'T THAT COME WITH THE L. C.
S SO WE'RE POINT THREE OVER
COULD B STILL PUT THEM ON THE SIDE
WE JUST GOT RID OF A GIMMICK THAT WAS NEVER ANYWAY
AND THE SCROLL WHEEL IS I MEAN ESSENTIALLY THE TWO BUTTONS THAT WAS IT'S NOT A GREAT DIFFERENCE I DON'T THINK
OH THE THE BEEPER THING
YEAH I THINK JEN WANTS IT TO VIBRATE
SO WE CAN HAVE THAT LOT LET'S JUST THROW IT TOGETHER AND DO WHAT WE CAN
IT WASN'T LIKE WE WERE ALONE FOR VERY LONG SO YOU DIDN'T ST GO OFF AND THINK
AND THEN YOU KNOW COME BACK THREE DAYS LATER AND JEN'S GOING LOOK LOOK IT VIBRATES AND IT LOOKS LIKE A BANANA
THAT WOULD JUST BE SO COOL TO D DO ALL YOUR NOTES AND S
THE THING FLEW IN YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE WHOLE WHOOSHING THING 'CAUSE THERE WASN'T TIME FOR THAT SO YEAH
NOT THAT YOU CAN DO THAT ON THE BOARD EITHER
BACK IT THIS IS JUST HAD TO BE CHANGED
YOU WEREN'T LIKE A A DICTATING LEADER SO THAT WAS ALWAYS GOOD
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T GO SHOPPING FOR REMOTE CONTROLS THAT OFTEN MAYBE SOMEBODY'S ALREADY THOUGH OF IT
I'LL BE LOOKING OUT NEXT TIME I NEED TO WRITE AN ESSAY
YEAH BUT THAT WOULD JUST COME UP WITH LIKE OTHER THINGS REALLY WOULDN'T IT
WE COULD DRAW ANIMALS ON THE BOARD AGAIN
YEAH ABOUT FOUR FIFTEEN YEAH
SO YOU SAID UM ARE ARE WE STARTING WITH THE THE SO WILL YOU MAYBE START WITH LIKE THE MM THE SHAPE AND THINGS AND AND THEN I WILL EXPLAIN THE THE USER INTERFACE TH UH THINGS
WELL BUT IT'S IT'S JUST AN A APPROXIMATION
UH YEAH
UM IT COULD BE MADE A BIT SMALLER AND AND OF COURSE IT WOULD BE AND YEAH
SO SO UH THE USER INTERFACE AS AS WE DISCUSSED LAST TIME UH MM ON ON THE ON THE COVER WE JUST HAVE THE VERY BASIC THINGS
SO WE HAVE THAT N UH CHANNELS HERE STARTING FROM UM UH ONE TWO THREE THERE WOULD BE NUMBERS IN IN THE ON THE ACTUAL ONE
SO IT'S FOUR UP TO FOUR UP TO SEVEN UP TO NINE AND ZERO Z ZERO HERE
ON THE SIDE THIS ONE
AND AND AND IT'S IT'S ON THE BACK IS MM COVER OR BACK LID BECAUSE IF YOU FLIP IT OPEN YOU CAN STILL DO THE SCROLLING HERE
SEE
SO THE VOLUME IS YOU JUST SCROLL BUT THEN ONCE YOU FLIP IT OPEN OKAY
WELL WE'LL HAVE THIS ON THE SCREEN ON THE DISPLAY
WELL BUT THE BUT THE MUTE YEAH THE SCROLLING IS KIND OF YOU HAVE TO SCROLL ALL THE WAY TO MAKE IT MUTE RIGHT
AND OKAY SO I SO THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS ALSO JUST PART OF IT
YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT IN THE INTERFACE
YEAH I THINK UM WE COULD DO L THE LOGO IN GREY AS IT IS ON THE WEBSITE
YEAH THE YEAH IT'S DEFINITELY ATTRACTIVE
OH THE LOCATABLE THING WE ACTUALLY FORGOT
IT WILL BE RED TOO
S SEVEN WAS TH THE MAXIMUM YEAH
YEAH SO Y SO WE WE MIGHT DO WE MIGHT WANT TO DO LIKE A UH ANOTHER M MODEL ANOTHER ANOTHER VERSION
OR MAYBE SIX BECAUSE IT'S JUST ONE ONE I ONE AMONG THE ISSUES I MEAN
NO YEAH BUT MM BUT WE HAVE IT NICELY WITH THE HINGES HERE YEAH
S UH SLIGHTLY SMALLER
YEAH BUT IF WE FLIP IT OPEN ONLY AS MUCH AS THAT
YEAH WELL W BUT L BUT THE SPEAK SAMPLE SPEAKER IS INCLUDED
IF UH UH IF THIS MEANS INTUITIVE IF IT MEANS THE WAY PEOPLE KIND OF ARE USED TO FINDING THINGS AND IT'S I TH I THINK IT'S
BUT THEN WHO WOULD BE REALLY PUSHING THE BUTTONS SO MUCH ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL ANYWAY YEAH
SEE
WELL MM WE HAVE WE HAVE THE SAMPLE SPEAKER AS WELL WHICH IS YEAH IT'S KIND OF NEW
OH THREE SIXES OKAY YEAH
S YEAH YEAH WE HAD FOR MUTING YEAH
YEAH BUT WHAT DO WE HA WE HAVE L. C. DISPLAY BUT BUT THE WH BUT THE S SPINNING WHEEL
BUT IT WAS VERY NO INNOVATIVE INNOVATIVENESS
YEAH B NO NO YOU CAN PUSH THIS ONE BUT WE DON'T HAVE A PUSHBUTTON UH WE CA WE DON'T HAVE THIS MUTING MECHANISM FOR THIS SCROLLING THING
IT CAN COME IN THE SAME COLOUR AS THE THE CASE
YEAH MM AS FAR AS CREATIVITY IS CONCERNED YEAH I THINK THERE WAS THERE WAS ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
YEAH THE M THE MEANS WERE VERY VERY GOOD THE MEANS WE USED
YEAH MAYBE W MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A PATENT ON THIS ONE
OH YOU DON'T LIKE ANIM
SO NOW WE WE HAVE THE OKAY SO MA MAARIKA WILL EXPLAIN YOU THE USER INTERFACE THERE
AND IT FLIPS OPEN ON THE SIDE SO IT OPENS LIKE THAT
AND WE HAVE THE USER INTERFACE O IN HERE AND UH THE THE L. C. D. AND AND THE SCROLL ARE INSIDE
WELL EVERYTHING ELSE IS PROBABLY USER INTERFACE SO
IT'S ON THE SIDE
UH NO WE WE'D NOT PUT SO ON ON THE COVER WE HAVE THE THE BARE ESSENTIALS
UH ON THE L. C. D. WE R YOU KNOW THE MAIN MENU WILL HAVE VARIOUS OPTIONS
WE RAN OUT OF RESOURCES HERE SO
YEAH SEE THE BUDGET
BUT WE CAN WE CAN I CAN I CAN TAKE NOTE UH UH
ONE MORE THING IS THAT I
YEAH BUT WE WHICH MAKES IT KIND OF REALLY BIG YEAH
UH THIS THIS KIND OF UH MAKES IT MORE AND TWO IT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THE I. R. CHANNEL
IT'S A IT'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY SO M M MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET USED TO IN THE BEGINNI SO IT IS KIND OF NOT VERY INTUITIVE BUT UH IT'S A GOOD TECHNOLOGY
I'M GONNA GIVE A SEVEN IN EVERYTHING SO
AND MOREOVER IT IT HAS UM L. C. D. AND EVERYTHING SO THAT UH YOU KNOW UH WE MINIMISE THE PRESSING OF THE BUTTONS ANYWAY
ANYWAY IT HA YEAH IT'S THE MOST SOPHISTICATED REMOTE THAT I EVER SEEN
YEAH BUT THEY'VE BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A REMOTE
THREE
AND ONE FIVE
UH
IT'S A SCROLL WHEEL SO WE WE'VE PUT IT'S PUSHBUTTON AND SCROLL WHEEL AND L. C. D. DISPLAY SO THAT'S THAT'S THE THREE KIND OF INTERFACES THAT WE HAVE
UH OKAY
WHEN YOU SAY WHEN YOU PRESS ONE IT SAYS ONE OR IT SAYS HELLO
A ALSO I IN THE CASE I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU WILL EVALUATE THIS AS A CURVED SURFACE
NO W W W BUT HA IT'S IT'S THE SCROLL WHEEL AND I THOUGHT WE WERE REFERRING TO THIS AS A SCROLL SPINNING WHEEL AND PUSHBUTTON THING
OH SO SO THE THE THIS IS
ON THE SIDE
BUT WE LOSE THE LOCATOR
I THINK UH N ONE THING THAT WAS LACKING UH WAS THAT WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE VARIOUS THINGS COST TO BEGIN WITH
YEAH THAT OR NOT YEAH
SO D ALL THE RANDOM DECISIONS AT THE END COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED
I GUESS IT WAS A FAIRLY SMALL GROUP SO ALL OF US GOT TO EXPRESS OUR OPINIONS YEAH
YEAH SAME HERE
IS THAT ALRIGHT
OH ANOTHER ONE
AH
CLIP
AH
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS
A WHAT
ME
AH
AH RIGHT OKAY
EACH
COULDN'T WE HAVE LIKE ONE THAT COMES OUT
LIKE SO YOU HAVE ONE IN LIKE MM IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE REALLY THICK
AND THEN YOU HAVE ONE FOR YOUR D. V. D. AND YOU SORT OF SLIDE IT OUT AND THEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE YOU SLIDE IT OUT
INTO ONE
SO IT'S NOT YOU ACTUALLY JUST PUTTING THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT REMOTES TOGETHER BUT MAKING THEM THINNER AND UM INTO ONE BASICALLY
I THINK A FLIP UP THING 'CAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE THIS PROBLEM OF LIKE IF IT'S ON THIS WELL I DID ANYWAY
LIKE WE HAD FIVE OR SIX REMOTES AND THEY WOULD BE LYING ON THE C ON THE COACH
AND YOU'D COME AND SIT DOWN AND OOH THE TELEPHONE'S THE TELEVISION SWITCHED ON OR SOMETHING
AH RI OKAY
SO DO WE TAKE THESE OFF
ON THE OR
IS THIS A T. V. ONE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE
T
UM HAVE UH ONE VERY COMPLICATED ONE ON ONE SIDE WITH ALL THE D. V. D. AND V. C. R. ACCESS AND STUFF
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE O ONE UH A REMOTE CONTROL THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY SIMPLE WITH JUST THE CHANNEL
I CAN REAL KEEP IT REALLY REALLY SIMPLE ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER SIDE BE VERY COMPLICATED
YEAH 'CAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IF IT SAYS JUST T. V. REMOTE DOESN'T SAY COM COMBINATION WITH ALL ALL THE R
HAR HOW IT WORKS AN
DO YOU THINK OUR TWO KIND OF OVERLAP BECAUSE
OOH
UH
SO IS THE AGENDA
TRY OUT THE WHITEBOARD EVERY PARTICIPANT SHOULD DRAW THEIR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND SUM UP THEIR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
IS IT RUDE
'KAY AND YOU WANT TO WRITE UP ON THERE IT SAYS YOU'VE GOTTA SUM UP YOUR F F YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
DO YOU WANT TO USE THE WIPE THE M THE WIPER AND WIPE IT OFF
OKAY DO Y DO YOU WANNA DO SOME WRITE YOU WANNA JUST WRITE SOME WORDS ABOUT IT
UM I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A FAVOURITE ANIMAL BUT FOR THE FOR TH FOR THIS MEETING I'LL S DRAW A LITTLE
UH
UH
OKAY WELL YOU GOT IT'S A S
OKAY SO I GUESS THAT WAS THE TEST TO SEE IF THIS EQUIPMENT IS ALL WORKING
PRODUCTION COST AH RIGHT IT'S GOTTA BE CAN'T COST ANY MORE THAN TWELVE FIFTY TO MAKE
EXPERIENCE WITH WITH REMOTE CONTROL SO TALK ABOUT WHO WHO'S USED WHAT
OH K SO WE'RE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS DISCUSSION LIKE RIGHT NOW ARE WE OR OH OKAY
I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST T GIVING US INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE RE TO DO NEXT BUT
YOU WANT IT BIG DO YOU WANT IT SMALL
ARE WE ARE WE GOING FOR LIKE LIKE TELEPHONES ARE GOING LITTLE TEENY TINY THINGS OR WE ARE GOING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S BIG AND
WA I MEAN WE 'CAUSE WE THIS IS WHAT WE TH WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE MOMENT IS JUST SAYING WHAT WHAT WE'D LIKE
AND THEN AFTER WE AFTER WE'VE FOUND OUT WHAT WE CAN LIKE
SOME DIFFERENT IDEAS WE CAN THEN GO AND DO THE RESEARCH TO FIND OUT IF THESE ANY OF THESE IDEAS ARE FEASIBLE OR NOT
F FLIP IT OPEN AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THE BUTTONS OR YOU FLIP IT CLOSED AND YOU'VE JUST GOT THE BASIC BUTTONS ON THE OUTSIDE MAYBE
UM OH WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES LEFT
I HAVE GOT I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE A BACK UP PLAN OF I 'CAUSE I I I JUST THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT I MEAN WE DON'T
SEE 'CAUSE I'M JUST THINKING BEARING IN MIND TH WE'VE GOTTA WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S CHEAP TO MAKE
MAY W YOU KNOW MAYBE EVEN
OR MAYBE EVEN SO SOMETHING THAT'S FOR DISABLED PEOPLE OR SO PEOPLE THAT UH B DON'T SEE VERY WELL OR BIG BUTTONS FOR TOUCHY BUTTONS FOR
OTHERWISE WE'LL BE WE'LL BE HERE ALL DAY TALKING ABOUT DO THIS LET'S DO THAT N I THINK WE SH I THINK WE SHOULD
I MEAN I'D LIKE ONE THAT MAKES TEA AS WELL BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN
OKAY LIKE A LOCK F LIKE A LOCK FUNCTS FUNCTION ON IT LIKE YOU HAVE ON YOUR TELEPHONES YEAH
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S YOU SO YOU GOTTA YOU GO YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA BE THE ONE THAT'S WORKING OUT WHAT WHAT BUTTONS WE NEED
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER YOU ARE THE ONE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING OUT KIND OF BOX IT GOES IN I GUESS SO UM
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOTTA GO AND FIND OUT DO TH DO THE RESEARCH
SEE WHAT PEOPLE WANT IN A REMOTE WHAT BUTTONS ARE USED MORE OFTEN AND S STUFF LIKE THAT
IT'S A LIGER A COMBINATION OF A LION AND TIGER
OH IT'S A HILARIOUS MOVIE
YOU HAVE TO SEE IT
BUT YOU HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE TO FULLY APPRECIATE IT
THERE GO
OH A SQUIRREL
SO I THINK BEFORE WE CLOSE UH WE ARE EXPECTED I MEAN THE LAST SLIDE WANTED US TO MAYBE DISCUSS LONGER WHAT OUR
UH
S
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT LIKE AT THE SAME TIME YOU DON'T WANNA REALLY BUSY REMOTE WITH A THOUSAND BUTTONS ON IT OR SOMETHING
BUT THE THE FUNCTIONS THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE WANT ARE THAT IT CAN CONTROL THE T. V.
BUT ALSO DEVICES CONNECTED TO THE TO THE T. V. I MEAN BE ABLE TO OPERATE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST CONCENTRATE ON HAVING A A GOOD T. V. REMOTE AND HAVE IT BE UM
HAVE IT BE LIKE ERGONOMIC SO IT'S COMFORTABLE TO USE UH SIMPLE TO USE AND LOOKS DECENT AND
SORTA FIND A NICHE FOR OUR REMOTE LIKE MARKET IT TO A CERTAIN KIND OF P KIND OF PEOPLE
Y
SO THAT IT'S NOT UH NOT USABLE WHEN YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE USABLE
ALRIGHT SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
R. E. I. S. S. A.
D I MEAN I I'M FINISHING OFF MY PRESENTATION
BUT IF LIKE YOU'RE ON THE PHONE IN THE OTHER ROOM AND YOU NEED TURN TELEVISION OFF OR SOMETHING AND YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO INTO THE PUT THE TELEPHONE DOWN
USE BLUETOOTH
NO OH
AND ALSO GAVE SO THIS IS RESEARCH AND WE ALSO GAVE PARTICIPANTS UM QUESTIONNAIRES TO FILL OUT
SO THEY DON'T LIKE LIKE THE WAY THEY OPERATE IT DOESN'T
UM PER CENT OF THE USERS SAY THAT THEY ONLY USE TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTONS ON A REMOTE SO PROBABLY IF YOU HAVE LIKE ONE
TWO THREE FOUR FIVE THE WHOLE UP TO Z TEN THEY PROBABLY DON'T USE THOSE THEY ONLY USE THE UP AND DOWN CHANNEL
SO MAYBE TRACKING DEVICES IS A GOOD IDEA
SO AND THIS WAS WHAT WE CAME UP WITH
THEN IF YOU LOOK FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE THIS IS AGE SORRY AGE GROUPS
FORTY FIVE POINT SEVEN PER CENT SAY NO SO
MAYBE TH THE BUTTONS NOT SO HIGH UP SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESS SO MUCH OR WE JUST LIKE FLAT BUTTONS SOMETHING
SO THAT IS ME
CAN'T WE HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS IN THE REMOTES SO SOMEBODY CAN CHOOSE DIFFERENT COL LIKE DOES IT HAVE TO BE OF A CERTAIN
WHOA
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE IT ONE COLOUR
THA
YOU WILL AS WELL
I. N. E.
HOW LONG IS THE MEETING
UH
SO THE WORKING DESIGN I'VE GOT A VERY QUICK PRESENTATION ON THIS SO UM I'VE OH NO YOU CAN'T SEE A THING
OH WELL I'M GONNA DRAW IT ON THE BOARD THEN
WE IT'S FINE ON MY SCREEN BUT NEVER MIND
ENERGY SOURCE UM WHICH IN OUR CASE WILL PR OH WELL OKAY NEVER MIND
AND UH THE SENDER WILL SEND TO THE TELLY ITSELF AN INFRA RED SIGNAL TO TELL IT TO SWITCH ON OR SWITCH CHANNELS
SORRY THE PRESENTATION WASN'T VERY UH CLEAR BUT
WELL IT'S JUST YOU DON'T WANT IT PLUGGED IN REALLY S
I DUNNO SWI I TH I TH I THINK CHANGING YOUR BATTERIES ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS IS NOT REALLY A PAIN BUT
WELL THE THING IS UH YOU YOU DON'T
IT'S A FANCY IDEA UH IT'S QUITE NICE BUT THEN I DON'T TH I DUNNO
EITHER YOU IF YOU WANNA WATCH THE TELLY YOU'RE IN THE ROOM YOU ARE GONNA
OH WE CAN WE CAN KEEP THE IDEA IF YOU I
WE CAN SEE AT A LATER STAGE MAYBE I DON'T
SO PROJECT MANAGER IT'S PARTICIPANT ONE AT A. M. I.
I JUST WANNA 'CAUSE BASICALLY I CAN'T RE I'VE REALLY CRAP AT REMEMBERING EVERYONE'S NAME SO I JUST WANNA RATHER THAN GOING UH MISS MARKETING AND MISS THIS AND MISS THAT WANTED TO KNOW YOUR NAMES AGAIN
E. L. IS IT
AND YOU'RE S R R. E. I. S. S.
UH RIGHT
I AM YOUR PROJECT MANAGER AND UH YEAH I'M JUST HERE TO
SORT OF LIAISE BETWEEN THE THREE OF YOU AND GET THINGS GOING
UM RIGHT THIS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS MEETING WHAT THIS MEETING IS ALL ABOUT IS UM I'M GONNA HAVE SOME PRESENTATIONS FROM ALL THREE OF YOU
WE'LL WE'LL UH TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ACTUALLY NEED AS A FINAL COMING TOGETHER OF IT ALL
UM AND THEN WE'LL YEAH WE'LL SORT OF CONCLUDE ANYTHING ELSE COMES UP AT THE END OF IT
UM IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE A POWERPOINT THINGY IT DOESN'T MATTER IT IT JUST IT JUST SAYS THAT YOU IT'S THAT'S JUST ONE PARTICULAR MEDIUM
YOU CAN TALK TO US YOU CAN YOU KNOW HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO YOUR LITTLE PRESENTATION BASICALLY YOU CAN
UH OKAY
YOU OKAY OVER THERE
ARE YOU UH B ARE YOU JOINING IN WITH THIS MEETING HERE OR ARE Y OR ARE Y OR ARE YOU ARE YOU JUST ARE YOU JUST UH DOING SOME INTERNET SHOPPING THERE
AH
I PREFER THE PE I PREFER THE HUMAN TOUCH PERSONALLY
DOESN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A WALL BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE LOOKING THROUGH A WALL
YEAH YEAH I D IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU YOU W DON'T WANNA OVERCOMPLICATE THINGS
YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED IT
UM GAB GABRIEL LET'S UH LET'S HEAR FROM YOU ON ON ON SUCH THINGS
THIS W UM RESEARCH THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING LOOKI LOOKING AT OTHER YOU KNOW EXISTING UNITS STUFF
UM HAVE YOU FOUND THAT ANYONE ELSE HAS DO HAS LOOKED INTO THE LOCKING FUNCTION OR
A F A LIKE A F A PHYSICAL SWITCH OR A PHYSICAL COVER FOR THE REMOTE EVEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
LIKE S YOU SAID EARLIER ON AB AB AB A FLIP THING SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT YOU KNOW BEING PHYSICAL
LOOK INTO
IT'S GOTTA D LOOK LIKE IT'S IN THE R. AND R.
SO IT'S KINDA GOTTA LOOK IT'S GOTTA LOOK NEW AND S YOU KNOW SOMETHING FASHIONABLE
IF IF REMOTE CONTROL WELL IF TELEPHONES CAN BE FASHIONABLE THEN MAYBE REMOTE CONTROL UNITS CAN BE
SO THERE YOU GO YEAH
PEOPLE PEOPLE FROM THE AGE OF THIRTY F THERE'S A BIG DROP OFF THERE
UM BUT NO THEY'RE NOT SORT OF MOST PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE MONEY ARE PEOPLE FROM THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE
UM D AND THA AND THAT'S A THAT'S QUITE A MINORITY THERE SO YEAH IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE FIFTY FIFTY THAT'S TH THIRTY FIVE PER CENT
SO Y SO IT'S SO IT'S SO YOU GOT SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE A LOOK INTO THEN I WHEN DESI WHEN DESIGNING THE ERGONOMICS OF SEE HAVE A LOOK IF UM THERE'S ANY W ANY MEDICAL BACKGROUND WE CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THIS
LET'S JUS WE JUST WANT NEED TO COVER OUR ARSES SO THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA SUE US IN TEN YEARS' TIME
I'LL SEE IF I CAN GET SEE IF I CAN GET HOLD OF THEM FOR THE NEXT MEETING
S UM
NOW GOING BACK TO THE UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN OF IT YOU KNOW WE WERE LOOKING AT WHETHER TO USE MAYBE INFRA RED OR BLUETOOTH
UH MEAN WE WE CAN LOOK INTO USING THE S YOU KNOW THE LITTLE TINY WEENY BATTERIES ALL LIKE SPECIAL LONG LASTING BATTERIES
BUT A IN THERE'S NO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY POINT IN MAKING A REMOTE CONTROL UNIT THAT'S GONNA LAST FOR FIFTY YEARS
DO OH HAVE YOU GUYS FOUND OUT IF WE CAN IF WE CAN E MAIL STUFF TO EACH OTHER
SEND ME YEAH YEAH OKAY
IS IT YELLOW AND BLACK OR IS IT YELLOW AND BLUE
WELL SEE THE THING IS IS WE'VE GOTTA KEEP THE COMPANY IMAGE
NOT NECESSARILY EVEN IF I IT JUST HAS TO YE BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PRODUCT AND INSTANTLY KNOW THAT IT'S ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS AS OPPOSED TO A SONY PRODUCT OR A
IT'S GOT TO SO MAYBE SO YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK AT OUR OUR OTHER PRODUCTS AND SEE IF THEY ALL FOLLOW A S SIMILAR VEIN PERHAPS
AND UM I THINK WE UH STOP FOR LUNCH NOW
IF WE'VE IF WE'VE FINISHED AT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE MEETING'S SUPPOSED TO FINISH THEN THAT MEANS WE GET AN EXTRA FIVE MINUTES FOR LUNCH
TAKE YOUR HEADSETS OFF KICK BACK SMOKE 'EM IF YOU GOT 'EM
OH I THOUGHT WE ALL WERE
YEAH I HAVE ONE TOO OKAY
S
E. L.
AS FAR AS THE INFRA RED SIGNAL DO WE HAVE CONTROL OVER
YOU KNOW HOW FAR AWAY YOU CAN BE FROM THE RECEIVING UNIT THE THE T. V. AND STILL HAVE IT BE OPERATIONAL
UH
UM SO WE CAN IMPROVE WHAT'S OUT THERE AND MAINTAIN THAT
BUT THEN ALSO A NUMERICAL KEY PAD SO THAT THEY CAN JUST KEY DIRECTLY TO THE CHANNEL THAT THEY WANT
AND SO IN THE RESEARCH THAT I WAS DOING
SO THIS IS A ENGINEER CENTRED ONE SO YOU SEE IT'S RATHER BUSY BUT IT ALSO LETS YOU PLAY YOUR MOVIE
STOP YOUR MOVIE FAST FORWARD ALL THIS UM FREEZE FRAME
UH IT'S IT'S EASIER TO G JUST GLANCE AT THIS AND SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE TO DO YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE STARING AT IT FOR FIVE MINUTES
UH OR THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING IN AT LEAST
BUT IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OVERWHELMING SO THE USER CENTRED ONES JUST FOCUS ON EASE OF USE
NO THAT THAT THAT SEEMED LIKE A NOVEL IDEA AS F AS FAR AS I KNOW
UM I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT WITH IN IN ALL MY YEARS IN IN THE REMOTE BUSINESS
I DUNNO WHAT UH DO YOU GUYS HAVE A A YEA OR NAY ON THAT A FEELING ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S REALLY NECESSARY
AND OUR MOTTO IS IS WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
WELL YEAH THESE I THINK
WE CAN SO WE TALKED ABOUT THE LAYOUT IN MY PRESENTATION AND WHAT I DIDN'T MENTION YET REALLY IS IS THE SORT OF LIKE THE ERGONOMIC DESIGN
I T I THINK WE CAN MAKE BIG IMPROVEMENTS OVER THESE TWO THAT YOU SEE HERE I MEAN
UH EVERYTHING IS GOING T ERGONOMIC YOU KNOW
UH YEAH THIS IS GETTING ALL
UH
YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALL ON THE PRETTY MUCH ON THE SAME PAGE
OH IT'S PROBABLY JUST YOU 'CAUSE YOU'RE THE PROJECT MANAGER
UH
OH IT'S JUST PARTICIPANT ONE OH OKAY
WELL IT'S LIKE WHITE ON I WHITE AND BLUE ON A BLACK BACKGROUND WITH WHITE WITH YELLOW BORDERS
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME ON DOWN FROM FROM THE HIGHER UPS SO I MEAN WE ARE SORT OF BEHOLDEN TO THEM
ALRIGHT SEE YOU ALL SOON
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED ONE OF THESE I REALLY HAVE
G THERE THE SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER THING
OH IT JUST GIVES AN ANSWER
OH THEN THEN
OH THEN FORGET ABOUT IT
WE HAVE FOUND THAT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET THESE ARE LIKE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS LIKE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO WHICH WE'VE ALREADY PROBABLY DISCUSSED
UM THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS LOOK AND FEEL
THAT'S NEW
SO NO LOOSE
EVERYBODY'S GONNA LIKE OH 'CAUSE BLUETOOTH IS THE IN THING NOWADAYS
YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT NEW YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT STATE OF THE ART
BUT LIKE IT NEEDS DO SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW IS NEW
IF WE WANT SOMETHING NEW WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE
THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT UH IS IT'S EASY TO USE
AND I THINK WE'VE ALL UM WORKED THAT OUT
NEXT YEAR'S FASHION I VERY MUCH IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE THM ARE LIKE THE THEME FOR CLOTHS SHOES AND FURNITURE
UM AND AS IT'S RUBBER THE FEEL WHICH IS IN THIS YEAR IS SPONGY
SO IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE SPONGY BUT SPONGY I WOULD SAY IS YEAH SO WE'RE IN
SO WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION LIKE
OKAY SOR I SORRY I USED THE WRONG WORD WHAT DO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH THE MATE THE MATERIAL THAT MATERIAL
TOO
BRIGHT BUT TOO NOT YEAH
WANNA MAKE IT DIFFERENT COLOURS SO ANYBODY CAN CHOO LIKE LIKE
AND ON THE BACK OF IT HAVE THE LOGO
AND UH PARENTS WILL SEE THE WILL SEE THE PRO AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S UM
SO SO IT'S REA IT'S QUITE IT'S QUITE LIKE UM USER FRIENDLY AND ALSO FOR DIFFERENT FAMILIES
LIKE LIKE FAMILY USE AS WELL SO FOR LITTLE KIDS AND FOR OLD KI LIKE TEENAGERS WILL LIKE IT I THINK
ESPECIALLY MAYBE YOUNGER GIRLS IF IT'S IN PINK THEY'LL BE LIKE PINK REMOTE CONTROL FOR THEIR ROOM SOMETHING
SO LIKE YOU WALK IN YOU'RE LIKE OH I LIKE THAT REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S SO BRIGHT AND THEN
AND THEN THE SHOP ASSISTANT COMES UP AND SAYS OH WHAT COLOUR WOULD YOU LIKE
AND THEN THEY GO LIKE OH I CAN CHOOSE THE COLOUR WOW
SO IT PUTS I THINK EVEN THE CUSTOMER INTO MORE CONTROL OVER WHAT THEY'RE BUYING INSTEAD OF YOU'VE GOT ALL COLOUR IT'S EITHER THAT OR NOTHING
WELL PERSONALLY I LIKE WALKING INTO A SHOP AND CHOOSING A COLOUR
S
YOU CAN HAVE A KINETIC PROVISION OF ENERGY WHICH IS USED ON SOME WATCHES THESE DAYS
FOR THE CASE OF THE REMOTES ITSELF UM THEY CAN BE A GENERAL CASE WHICH IS JUST A FLAT ONE
YOU CAN HAVE UH A CURVED ONE OR A DOUBLE CURVED ONE IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO
UM THEN THE CASE MATERIAL ITSELF SO IT CAN BE UH UH EITHER PLASTIC OR LATEX
AND TH FOR EACH OF THEM YOU HAVE UH CASES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE TITANIUM
UH S SO IF D OKAY
AND THEN THERE ARE THE PUSH BUTTONS SO YOU CAN HAVE BASIC PUSH BUTTONS OR A SCROLL WHEELS LIKE YOU HAVE ON A MOUSE
UM OR YOU COULD HAVE UM L. C. D. WHICH GIVES YOU A DISPLAY
NO BUT NA LE YOU SEE YOU'VE GOT OKAY THE ENERGY THAT'S ONE THING
AND I'M JUST SAYING IF IT IF WE CHOOSE IT TO BE DOUBLE CURVED THEN WE NEED TO GO I DUNNO WHY
SO EITHER
YES I DO
UM SO THE PUSH BUTTONS THEMSELVES THEY CAN BE JUST SIMPLE OR THEY CAN BE SO THAT'S JUST THE ELECTRONICS BETWEEN THE BUT BEHIND THE PUSH BUTTONS
UM AND THE PRICE THAT GO WITH IT WITH IT SO THE SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS ARE GONNA BE THE CHEAPEST
UH IF WE GET A SCROLL WHEEL THAT'S A HIGHER PRICE RANGE
IF WE GET AN ADVANCED CHIP WHICH IS UM USED FOR THE L. C. D. THE DISPLAY THING THEN THAT'S EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE
TECHNICALLY SPEAKING IT'S NOT AS ADVANCED BUT IT DOES THE JOB TOO
FO
BUT IT'S GONNA BE THE MOST EXPENSIVE OPTION PROBABLY AND
OKAY SO I'LL GO BACK MAYBE TO THE PREVIOUS SLIDE AND WE CAN DECIDE FOR EACH PROBLEM WHAT WE SHOULD CHOOSE
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT
P
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD GIVE AN OPTION OF FLAT BUTTONS OR A
BLUETOOTH WOULD FOR EXAMPLE ENABLE YOU I THINK TO UM UM CONNECT FOR EXAMPLE YOU IF YOU GET A W CALL ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE
BUT YOUR MOBILE PHONE IS DOWNSTAIRS OR SOMETHING YOU WOULD GET ON YOUR TELEVISION YOU'RE BEING CALLED BY THIS PERSON RIGHT NOW
WHA WHAT W WHAT ADVANTAGE WOULD YOU GET FOR THE
YEAH WELL AND IN LITTLE CHARACTERS YOU SAY YEAH BUT NOT TOO MUCH
WELL YEAH BUT APPLE WOULD SUE YOU FOR THAT
SUED THE BEATLES SO
ARE WE TAKING THESE OFF
I FEEL LIKE MADONNA WITH ONE OF THESE ON
I SAID I FEEL LIKE MADONNA WITH ONE OF THESE ON
IS UH EVERYONE READY
I FIGURED WITH THE SPAM THING IF YOU CAN'T BEAT IT JOIN IN
ARE YOU READY
OKAY RIGHT WELL I TAKE IT THAT YOU ARE ALL READY NOW
UM WHICH WAS WE GOT TOGETHER JUST TO BASICALLY DECIDE ON WELL TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY UH SUPPOSED TO BE DOING
THAT'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T HEARD THAT BEFORE SEE I'M LEARNING ALL SORTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGI TERMS IN TECHNOLOGY TODAY
UM YEAH WE'RE GONNA HEAR YOUR UH TH THREE LITTLE PRESENTATIONS WHETHER THEY BE ON COMPUTER OR ON THE WHITEBOARD OR WHATEVER YOU WANT
UM I'D LIKE TO UM HEAR O I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHO'S G WHO'S ON THE UM FROM FROM UH CATHERINE ACTUALLY FIRST
YOU CAN FUZZ IT ACROSS THE ROOM AND IT'LL BOUNCE OFF THE WALL BACK AT YOU
OOH WE LIKE RUBBER OOH
WELL WE'RE GONNA GO WITH I THINK WE'VE DECIDED THAT IT'S GONNA BE A RUBBER CASE SO
PUSH BUTTONS INSTEAD OF THE WHEEL
IS UH OKAY ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
WHICH I PRESUME IS LIKE ONE P. C. B. AND THAT'S GOT ALL THE ELECTRONICS ON ONE BOARD INCLUDING THE UM INFRA RED SENDER
Y UM WHAT ALTERNATIVES DO WE HAVE TO THE CHIP ON PRINT
UM WE WANNA GO FOR AN I I ALL SO LONG AS IT WORKS
S YEAH PUSH BUTTONS
S
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANNA T GO INTO WITH THIS PRODUCT
AND IT'S CHEAPEST ALL ROUND IT SOUNDS KINDA FUNKY
AND WE CAN ALSO MARKET IT AS I 'CAUSE WE WERE S SAYING EARL YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER IN YOUR RESEARCH THAT UM THE THE PEOPLE HAVE THE R. PEOPLE WERE GETTING THE COMPLAINING ABOUT R. S. I.
SO THAT'S ANOTHER MARKETING POINT THAT WE CAN USE
BUT THE FACT THAT THIS THIS RUBBER I IS ACTUALLY USED IN THESE ANTI R. S. I. PS SPECIFIC
AND YOU KNOW YEAH YOU CAN FUZZ IT ACROSS THE ROOM AND THROW IT AT THROW IT AT YOUR CHILDREN YEAH
WELL LET'S UM SO W WHAT ARE OUR DEFINITE DECISIONS ON THIS THEN AS A TEAM
JUST THE SIMPLE S SIMPLE STRAIGHT SET OF BUTTONS
ARE WE GONNA HAV HAV AN ARE WE D HAVE WE DECIDED ON WHETHER
W WE'RE GONNA S SUPPLEMENT IT WITH ANYTHING YOU KNOW COLOURS OR PARTICULAR GIMMICKY BITS TO IT WE'RE NOT WE'RE JUST GONNA GO FOR SOMETHING
LET'S MOVE OVER TO
OKAY NOW THE TROUBLE IS IS WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED THAT WE'RE GOING WITH THE STUFF THAT WORKS ALREADY THAT'S CHEAP
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THAT'S YOUR FIRST THING YOU GO OH I'M NOT GONNA BUY THAT 'CAUSE I DUNNO IF IT WORKS OR NOT
YEAH WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT M
YEAH AND IT THIS IS JUST GONNA ALL THIS IS BEING USED FOR IS YOUR TELEVISION
IT WOULD THAT WOULD MEAN YOU'D NEED A TELEVISION THAT HAS BLUETOOTH IN IT WHICH NO NO TELEVISION DOES DOES IT
AN AND THERE IS NO THERE IS NO SUCH THING
THE FACT THAT IT'S MADE OUT OF THIS RUBBER WE CAN THROW IT ABOUT
TH WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO THROW THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS ABOUT BECAUSE IT CHARGES ITSELF UP BY DOING IT
ALRIGHT YEAH NO THIS I THIS IS GOOD SO THROUGH ALL THAT WE'VE WE GO WE'RE RIGHT
USING THE SPONGY RUBBER THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT ANTI R. S. I. YOU CAN AS YOU SQUEEZE IT YOU ARE NOT ONLY THERAPEUTICISING YOURSELF
WELL OKAY IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY FINALLY UM AGREED ON IS
LIKE YEAH WE'RE WE'RE SAYING NO WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
LIKE THE VOLUME BUTTONS SHOULD BE THE ALL THE SAME COLOUR AND THE D AND THE THE CHANNEL BUTTONS SHOULD BE ONE COLOUR AND STUFF LIKE THAT
THA
YEAH I MEAN WE THAT'S WE WE
IS
BE AB FOR THE NEXT MEETING BE ABLE TO COME IN AND SHOW US SOME SOME I SOME PHYSICAL IDEAS
YOU KNOW S SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL SOMETHING OR OTHER
UH
KEEPING THINGS T WELL UH YOU KNOW HO HOPEFULLY UH KEEPING THINGS TOGETHER
DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE MADE OUT OF THIS STUFF
YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA WE WE'RE GONNA AS A SORT OF EXTRA SOMETHING ON IT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT EXTRA THINGS ARE THERE EXTRA THINGS THIS PRODUCT HAVE
FACILITY ALTHOUGH WHETHER OR NOT IT HAPPENS OR IS POSSIBLE I DON'T KNOW BUT SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO
HOLD HOLD FIRE
UH
IS IT LIKE A CRANK THING OR SOMETHING
UH I THINK IT HAS TO BE ON THE ON THE SOLAR ENERGY BUT I DON'T KNOW
MEAN IT'S COMPLETELY FLEXED I MEAN IT IT FLEXES TO WHATEVER THEY WANT IT TO
MEAN SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NORMAL RUBBER CASE AND A RUBBLE DOUB DOUBLE RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED CASE
I THINK PUSH BUTTONS IS
TH THE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION UM OPTION IS IT DOESN'T SEEM REALLY VERY PROMISING FOR US UH 'CAUSE UH
THE YEAH THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY'RE ALREADY USING IT FOR IS WITH THE COFFEE MACHINE WHERE BASICALLY YOU CAN PROGRAM A SAMPLE WI UM
JUST UH CLIPS OF THA THAT YOU RECORD YOURSELF
SO YOU CAN PROGRAM YOUR COFFEE MAKER THAT WHEN YOU SAY GOOD MORNING TO IT IT SAYS HELLO RICK OR WHATEVER
BUT I MEAN IT'S NOT IT WOULD BE ONE THING IF IT WAS SPEECH RECOGNITION WHERE YOU SAY SOMETHING AND IT TURNS THE T. V. ON LIKE
TURN THE T. V. ON AND I TURNS COMES ON BUT IT'S NOT THAT
YEAH IF YOU'RE REALLY LONELY IT IS IT'S
NO THA THAT W THAT W THAT WOULD BE MORE PROMISING
UH
YEAH SO WE WANT IT RUB RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED
UH I ALSO TOOK UH REISSA'S MARKETING FINDINGS FROM THE LAST MEETING INTO CONSIDERATION UM
UH AND SO THE MANUFACTURING DIVISION UH SENT SOME SOME SAMPLES OF OF UH INTERFACE COMPONENTS THAT WE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN USING THAT HAVE BEEN USED IN OTHER PRODUCTS
THEY THEY ALSO GIVE THE UH THEY THEY SUGGESTED THE IDEA OF USING A SPINNING WHEEL LIKE YOU USE ON THE SIDE OF AN M. P. THREE PLAYER LIKE IPOD
UM SO WE'VE ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT AND I THINK THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE WORSE FOR SOMETHING LIKE R. S. I. I MEAN YOU GOT THAT THUMB MOVEMENT THAT YOU'RE CONSTANTLY DOING
AND I DIDN'T MENTION THAT WE NEED A POWER BUTTON IN OUR LAST I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE HERE OF UH GOOD LAYOUT AND BAD LAYOUT
UH
WHERE YOU HAVE VOLUME UP AND VOLUME DOWN BUT THEY HAVE A V. ON BOTH OF THEM SO UH
YEAH I TH I THINK MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES OF WE'VE ALL KIND OF TALKED ABOUT AND SEEMED TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE UM
UH
I GUESS IT'S TO THE POINT WHERE WE NEED TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT
WELL NOW THAT WE'VE DECIDED ON OUR
UM IT SEEMS LIKE WE WOULDN'T WANNA MAKE IT TOO BUSY AND TOO SORT OF GAUDY BUT UM
I MEAN 'CAUSE UH S SO IF WE WANNA HAVE A LOCK OF SOME SORT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A BUTTON
ACTUALLY I MEAN THESE FIRST TWO POINTS WE'VE ALREADY SORT OF GONE AWAY FROM
'CAUSE OUR RUBBER ONE IS NOT FANCY I MEAN IT'S DIFFERENT BUT I WOULDN'T SAY LIKE A RUBBER REMOTE IS FANCY
IF THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT THEN WE MAYBE WE'RE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
SO IS IS THE ADVANTAGE OF BLUETOOTH THAT YOU CAN JUST LIKE SYNCHRONISE IT WITH OTHER
YEAH THE THAT WOULDN'T BE THE REMOTE SO MUCH I MEAN
YEAH WE CAN MAKE THE SQUEEZING OF THE RUBBER BE THE BE THE GENERATING LIKE THE ENERGY GENERATOR
I HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING LIKE TOO MUCH DOWN A GIMMICKY ROAD OF OF HAVING I MEAN IF SOMEBODY GO GOES INTO THE STORE THEY'RE GONNA SEE LIKE THREE OR FOUR NORMAL REMOTES
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK LIKE AT THE COFFEE MAKER AT THE AT THE CORPORATE WEB PAGE IT'S NOT OBVIOUS
WELL IT IS TO US BECAUSE WE WE WORKED WORKED HERE FOR YEARS AND WE USE THAT COFFEE MACHINE
BUT IT'S DOESN'T HAVE THE COLOUR SCHEME OF OF THE OF THE COMPANY ANYWHERE ON IT OBVIOUSLY IT'S JUST SIL SILVER AND BLACK
RIGHT WELL I GUESS THAT'S US
OH IT'S SO CUTE
BUT THEN YOU CAN LEARN TO USE YOUR RIGHT H LIKE I WAS JUST THINKING IF THERE'S LEFT HANDERS AND RIGHT HANDERS IN THE FAMILY WHAT THEY HAVE TWO REMOTES
AND ALL THE PLAYING AROUND IS UH
PLAY DOH WON'T LAST VERY LONG EVERYBODY'LL GO LIKE OOPS IT'S GONE
WELL THEY'LL BUY MORE OF THEM IF YOU EAT THEM
THIS IS WHERE WE ALL GET TO I GET TO WRITE ON THE OOPS ON THE BOARD
AND WE HAVE TO DO IT ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN ONE BEING TRUE
SO IT'S IT'S MORE LIKE IT'S FITS THE CRITERIA AND SEVEN BEING AS IN IT DOESN'T FIT THE CRITERIA
SO SEVEN'S HERE AND ONE'S HERE AND THEN YOU'VE GOT IN THE MIDDLE
SO THE DOES REMOTE LOOK AND FEEL FASHIONABLE TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT
AS IT IS IT COLOUR WISE AND IS IT SPONGY
SO WHAT MARK SHOULD WE GIVE FOR THAT
AS IN IT'S NOT
A ONE A ONE
SO I'LL JUST WRITE CRITERIA CRITERIA ONE WE GET ONE
AS IN THE NEW HIGH TECH
THREE
THREE
SO CRITERIA THREE IS IS IT EASY TO USE
'KAY CRITERIA FOUR IS COSTS
R. S. I. IS IT GOOD AGAINST
IS IT EASY TO GET LOST
IN FOUR DIFF IN IN FOUR MEETINGS
SEE SUMMARY THERE
WAS IT WAS IT FIFTY OR FIVE
JUST DON'T SH DON'T THROW IT AT ANY OF THE ORNAMENTS AND BREAK THEM
IN PROJECT
I USED TO EAT IT
IMAGINE D ARE YOU RIGHT HANDED
OH HO HO
WELL SO THE UM
YES S YEAH
T
Y
YES S
UH RIGHT
OOH
SPECIAL FORM YEAH THEY'RE A SPECIAL FORM THERE IN SHAPES AND STUFF
THAT'S GONNA COST TEN TEN EURO SEVENTY CENTS A UNIT TO MAKE
AND OUR TARGET WAS IT HAD TO COME IN AT UNDER TWELVE FIFTY
OKAY LET'S JUST SAVE THIS SO I CAN E MAIL IT TO YOU
UH
I COU
OH SORRY ONE D YEAH
GIVE IT A T GIVE IT A TWO
SO IT'S ANTI R. S. I.
LITTLE BIT OF PRAISE FOR EVERYBODY HERE FOR HOW THEY'VE WORKED ON IT YOU KNOW BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A TEAM
YOU KNOW YOU'VE W EVERYONE'S COME UP WITH THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL IDEAS IN THEIR OWN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS UM AND THEN COME TOGETHER AND WORKED IN
I THINK SO I I YOU KNOW AND I THINK WE'VE CO WE HAVE COME WE'VE COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW
YEAH TWO YEARS' TIME THIS WILL BE ON THE MARKET
EX EXACTLY THAT PRODUCT UM THUM WE'LL GO YEAH WE DESIGNED THAT AND NO ONE WILL BELIEVE US
NO I THINK WHEN THIS MEETING'S FINISHED LIKE OFFICIALLY THERE B WE'LL GET A UH QUESTIONNAIRE TO FILL IN
WHAT OUR WHAT OUR PROJECT WAS WAS TO COME UP WITH THE PRODUCT BASICALLY
THE FOR THE AND JUST BASICALLY IS IT IT COME CAN IS IT WITHIN BUDGET
WHEN IT C WHEN IT COMES TO ALL THE OTHER THINGS OF HOW TO SELL IT AND YOU KNOW
THE B THE PROFITS AND ALL THAT THAT'S OTHER DEPARTMENTS IT'S ANOTHER TEAM THAT ACTUALLY WORK OUT THE MAI THE OH YEAH
YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE MADE I WE'VE MADE WE'VE DESIGNED THE PRODUCT WE'VE MA WE'VE GOT THE PROTOTYPE
IT'S WITHIN BUDGET IT'S DOES EVERYTHING THAT WE WANTED IT TO DO
IT'S NEW IT'S IT'S UM
SOMETHING THAT UH THAT ISN'T OUT THERE ALREADY
WELL THIS IS VERY MARKETABLE IN THAT IT IS IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF NEW AND LOOKS A BIT QUIRKY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT THAT
OH NO I THI I PUT IT IN ONE OF MY E MAILS THAT I SENT OFF
OUR ONE DOES THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE YOU KNOW SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NEW
YEAH AND IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH THE T. V. YOU CAN F THROW IT ABOUT YOU KNOW
DRINKS ARE ON THE COMPANY
IN THE CORPORATE BAR THAT'S NEXT TO THE CORPORATE SWIMMING POOL ON THE TOP FLOOR THAT WE'RE THAT'VE ALL JUST GAINED ACCESS TO
WELL AS FAR AS I T AS FAR AS I KNOW
THE SORT OF USING OF THE THE PENS AND WRITING ON THESE SPECIAL PADS AND ALL THAT
I THI YOU KNOW I'D I'D N YEAH AS WE SAID EARLIER I'VE NOT NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE
SOMETHING THAT T THE WHITEBOARD
I MEAN IT'S I OR IN SUCH A NEW IDEA
BUT AS IT'S NOT IT'S LITERALLY THAT'LL COME UP ON A COMPUTER SCREEN AS A PICTURE FILE RATHER THAN ACTUAL TEXT
PEOPL I DUNNO IF MY MOM EVER DID IT BUT I REMEMBER OTHER PEOPLE'S MOMS MAKING LIKE HOME MADE PLAY DOH WHERE YOU JUST LIKE MAKE THE COLOURING AND MAKE SOME SORT OF SORT OF DOUGH
EVERYTHING UH THAT WE WANTED WE WANTED IT TO BE ERGONOMIC AND TO BE MADE OUT OF RUBBER VERY SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE YEAH
DOUBLE CURVED UM BUT ALSO SOMETHING THAT WAS GONNA JUMP OUT AT PEOPLE
IF YOU HOLD IT LIKE THAT THE ONE ON YOUR THUMB YEAH THE THUMB BUTTON IS THE POWER BUTTON
UM AND THEN THEN YOU CAN ALSO THERE'S A NUMERIC KEYPAD ON THE TOP SO YOU CAN KEY DIRECTLY TO THE TO THE CHANNEL IF YOU WANT
SO ALL THE I MEAN THE IMPORTANT KEYS ARE RIGHT AT YOUR F F YOU KNOW RIGHT AT UH AT A CONVENIENT PLACE FOR YOU TO TO ACCESS THEM
AH THAT'S GOOD THINKING YEAH
SO THAT'S THAT'S OUR END OF THINGS WHA UH
BUT IT'S EDIBLE
YEAH I MEAN THESE THESE ONES ON THE SIDE ARE CURVED KIND OF SO
THE BUTTONS ARE RUBBER
AND WE'RE ACTUA ACTUALLY MAKING A BETTER PROFIT THAN WE EXPECTED
THAT WAS OUR MAIN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION W EVERY EVERYTHING ELSE WAS FAIRLY SIMPLE BUT THE FACT THAT WE USED THE KINETIC ENERGY WAS NEW
MAYBE THREE YEAH
UH
YEAH DURING OUR DESIGN I MEAN THERE WAS SOME S SOME HEATED HEATED DISCUSSION BUT WE WE KEPT WE TRIED TO KEEP IT COOL AND AND
SO THERE'S NO WAY TO LIKE PREDICT WHAT OUR 'CAUSE WE HAD A WE ORIGINALLY HAD A
AS FAR AS OUR FINANCIAL UH UM GOALS WE HAD A SPECIFIC NUMBER FOR PROFITS THAT WE WANTED
DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE MAKING ON PROFIT
UH
I THINK ACTUALLY AND ONE ADVANTAGE OF OF THIS IS THAT AFTER THE UH YOU KNOW
IT MAKE WATCHING T. V. HEALTHY
UH
RIGHT YOU TOO
I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY BETTER THAT WE WRAP IT UP THAN HAVE FIVE MINUTES OF
UH RIGHT
RIGHT I THINK THEY DO WANT TO DO HAND WRITING RECOGNITION ON THAT IT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP
I GUESS WE SHOULD END THIS SINCE WE'RE OFF OFF TOPIC
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO START THIS TEAM
FIRST OF ALL OUR PROJECT AIM
I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE ALL THREE OF THOSE
UM INTRODUCE YOURSELF UM SAY ONE THING ABOUT YOURSELF AND THEN DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND TELL US ABOUT IT
MIGHT BE NICE TO HAVE THEM ALL UP THERE AT SAME TIME
EM
S
I LIVE UM I LIVE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM AN OPEN SPACE IN CALIFORNIA
OKAY UM MOVING ON TO
UM IN ORDER TO MAKE A PROFIT OF THIS MAGNITUDE WE NEED TO UM BE ABLE TO PRODUCE EACH ONE AT A MAXIMUM OF TWELVE FIFTY EURO
OKAY UM JUST TO GENERATE A LITTLE BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PROJECT UM I COULD I'D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES USING RO REMOTE CONTROLS
BUT WE COULD BUT IT'S POSSIBLE WE COULD USE LIKE A LITHIUM BATTERY UM THAT WOULD LAST A LOT LONGER THAN LIKE DOUBLE A. S
UM LIKE THO THOSE ARE THE BATTERIES THAT ARE USED IN A LOT OF UM M. P. THREE PLAYERS NOW AND THAT KIND OF THING
SO UM LIKE YOU SAID YOU DON'T LIKE HAVING ALL THE BUTTONS ON ONE ON ONE REMOTE AND YET YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE FIVE REMOTES
SO LIKE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM SOMEWHERE 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA M NEED THOSE SPECIAL FUNCTIONS OCCASIONALLY
UM BUT NOT NECESSARILY ON THE M THE NORMAL REMOTE
I BELIEVE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ONLY WORKING ON THIS THIS ONE FOR ABOUT TWENTY SO WE CAN CONTINUE DISCUSSING MORE NEW IDEAS IF YOU'D LIKE UM
UM USER REQUIREMENTS UM SO YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT DIFFERENT TRENDS UH ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED
UM SO VERY EXITED TO SEE ALL YOUR ANIMALS AND HOW WHAT WONDERFUL UM ARTISTS WE ALL ARE UM
I'M SURE AS WE'LL EACH GET OUR OWN INSTRUCTION AND THEN UM BECAUSE WHAT WE GONNA DO IS FIRST OUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TOGETHER
MM 'KAY UM I'LL TYPE UP MI MINUTES AND PROBABLY EMAIL THOSE OUT TO ALL OF YOU
I'LL JUST ATTACH IT TO AN EMAIL
IS THAT CORRECT
UM I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF THESE I HAVE TO BRING WITH ME
I HAVE NO DRAWING SKILLS WHATSOEVER
UM I'M FROM THE STATE OF MAINE IN THE US
BLAH BLAH BLAH AND I HAVE NO ARTISTIC TALENTS
A. L. I. M. A.
OH AND I GUESS I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER ON THIS PROJECT
OH A CAT
WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME I GUESS IS THAT IT'S EASY TO USE AND THAT THERE'S NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS
THEY ARE NOT TOO SMALL YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO N TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
AND ONE THING I PARTICULARLY LIKE IS IF YOU ARE NOT UM SORT OF MOVING IT AROUND TO GET IT TO WORK WITH THE INFRA RED
BUT I KNOW IN MY RESIDENCE RIGHT NOW THE THE TELEVISION YOU SORT OF HAVE TO WALK ALL AROUND THE ROOM TO GET IT TO TURN ON
COULD WE GET SOMETHING THAT
NO DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE BUTTONS THAT YOU NEED TO PROGRAM THE VIDEO RECORDER OR PROGRAM S OTHER THINGS THAT I'M NOT VERY COHERENT ABOUT
N THAT WAY
IF YOU HAVE OLDER PEOPLE OR PEOPLE LIKE ME THAT AREN'T VERY CO ORDINATED HAND EYE
TAKE MY CONTRAPTIONS WITH ME
AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP THE DEEP SEA SORT OF THEME GOING ON ANIMAL
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW ONE WOULD EXPLAIN THIS
UM I HATE WHEN THERE'S LIKE FOUR DIFFERENT BUTTONS AND YOU HAVE TO PRESS TO ACTUALLY TURN ON THE T. V. LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO ONE FOR THE POWER OF THE T. V. AND THEN LIKE ANOTHER ONE TO GET THE ACTUAL SCREEN ON AND SOMETHING ELSE TO GET IT ALL GOING
DEVICE TO HELP YOU FIND IT
AND MAYBE THAT SPATIALLY DIVIDES IT SO IT'S LIKE IF YOU'RE LOOKI IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THE T. V. ON THAT'S YOU KNOW
LIKE THE TOP THING ON THE REMOTE I DUNNO IF D BE VERTICAL OR HORIZONTAL IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT
ALL THE WHATEVER ELSE WE HAVE PROGRAMMED INTO IT IT'S ALL JUST IN ITS SEPARATE PLACE AND NOT LIKE ALL THE ON BUTTONS TOGETHER
UH OKAY
WELL MY NAME IS IAIN UH
I'LL I SHOULD LEAVE THAT ONE ON THERE SHOULDN'T I BEFORE I CALLOUSLY RUB IT OFF
IS THAT AT LEAST IDENTIFIABLE
SO ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SOMEONE REALLY LAZY LIKE ME THEY THEY'RE PRETTY NICE
LIKE YOU KNOW IF I'M WATCHING T. V. I HAVE HAVE TO HAVE THREE SEPARATE REMOTE CONTROLS OF IN FRONT OF ME
YOU KNOW ONE FOR THE T. V. ONE FOR THE DIGITAL BOX ONE FOR M THE VIDEO RECORDER AS WELL
THEY'VE GOT TOO MANY BUTTONS ON THEM UH TOO TOO SORT OF TOO SORT OF COMPLICATED WHEN ALL I REALLY WANNA DO IS SWITCH ON AND OFF
SO WE SHOULD MAYBE WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT I T IT'S JUST A TELEVISION THAT WE'RE WANTING TO CONTROL
IS THAT POSSIBLE
YES I DO
IS IT PLUGGED IN ALL THE WAY AND YOU SCREWED IT IN AND
IT'S TAKING IT A LITTLE BIT
THERE THAT ONE THERE YOU GO
IT'S FUNNY TO SEE THE DRASTIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO REMOTES
YOU THERE IT IS
THERE ARE THREE THINGY IF IT'S WAY AT THE BOTTOM
UNDER THREE ICONS AND IT'S THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE A DESK
UM YEAH USE THAT THING YOU CAN GO BACK PREVIOUS
OH WELL
YE
AH I CAN NEVER TELL WHICH WAY TO TURN THESE THINGS
UM I HAVE NOTHING ON MY SCREEN
WE HAVE A COUPLE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT I WAS JUST E MAILED RIGHT BEFORE THE MEETING AND THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN IN UM IN MIND AS WE'RE CREATING THIS
WE DIDN'T BRING IT UP YET OR AT ALL IN THE MEETINGS SO FAR
IT NO
W D COULD WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN IT
OKAY UM AND WE'RE ALSO GONNA W LIKE YOUR QUESTION EARLIER UM WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO BE T FOR TELEVISION VIDEO OR ETCETERA
UM OTHERWISE BECOMES TO COMPLEX WE WANNA GET THIS OUT UM VERY QUICKLY
LOOKS LIKE YEAH KIND OF A YELLOW AND BLACK AND WE HAVE THAT THE EMPHASIS ON THE R. S IN UM MM-HMM
YEAH OR HA MAYBE SOME BUTTONS COULD BE YELLOW
YOU UM IN YOUR ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT MARKET UM OF THE MARKETING YOU IDENTIFIED THAT DIFFERENT GROUPS WANTED DIFFERENT THINGS OR HAD CERTAIN PREFERENCES
UM AND SO WHO ARE WE AIMING THIS AT
WELL AT LEAST RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS UM DECIDING ON JUST THE REMOTE ITSELF SO IT WILL PROBABLY BE SOLD SEPARATELY TWENTY FIVE EURO BY ITSELF
ARE WE GONNA USE THAT AS ONE OF OUR FUNCTIONS
AND WE ALSO NEED TO TALK ABOUT IF WE'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE THE VERY SIMPLE ONES OR ALSO HAVE THE OTHER ONES JUST SEPARATE SOMEHOW OR
UM WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T IMPEDE UM THE CHIP TRANSMITTING INFORMATION BUT UM THAT'S GONNA BE MOSTLY TECHNOLOGICAL THING
OKAY THOSE ARE VERY GOOD GOALS I THINK UM THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IN WITH EVERYTHING WE DO
WHICH INCLUDES UM AN EMPHASIS ON MAKING THE INFRA RED VERY FUNCTIONAL SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AROUND A LOT
S VOICE RECOGNITION WHICH I KIND OF I KIND OF FEEL LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT NECESSARY IN A REMOTE CONTROL
SO MAYBE IT'S MORE USEFUL TO D D TO DEFINE OBJECTIVES LIKE FASHION AND SIMPLICITY THAN TO FIND SPECIFIC TARGET GROUP AS FAR AS AGE IS BECAUSE
YEAH THINGS SO DIFFERENT WILL APPEAL TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT
UM OH THERE'RE A COUPLE FUNCTIONS DO WE WANT SOMETHING SO THAT DO WE WANT SOME KIND OF THING TO FIND IT IF IT'S LOST
WE WANT A POSSIBILITY TO UM TO GET UM
UM YEAH HIDDEN WAY
AND WE ALSO WANT IT TO BE FASHIONABLE WHICH I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S A FUNCTION SO MUCH AS A UM YEAH
UM 'KAY WE'RE GONNA CONCLUDE NOW HAS EVERYONE SAID THEIR FUNCTIONS AND 'KAY
AND AS AS PER LAST TIME YOU'LL GET SPECIFIC INCRAT INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR PERSONAL COACH E MAILED TO YOU
BE SURE TO NOTE ANY FRUSTRATIONS OR ANY UM ISSUES THAT COME UP IN YOUR UM IN YOUR UM SUMMARY
YOU DON'T HAVE MINE
S
WELL I'LL FIGURE THAT OUT IN THE MEANTIME
OH GOT IT
AH HA LOOK AT THAT SHOWING UP ALREADY
AH
SO THIS IS OUR WORKING DESIGN PRESENTATION
THOUGH TH THE THING ABOUT WORKING DESIGN IS THE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS A WORKING DESIGN IS FIGURE OUT HOW THE APARATA APPARATUS CAN FULFIL ITS FUNCTION
IT WORKS BECAUSE IT CONVERTS ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO GRINDING THE BEANS AND THEN YOU PUT THE BEAN THROUGH A FILTER AND THAT FILTERS OUT
AND THEN YOU GET COFFEE AT THE END THAT'S NICE AND HOT BECAUSE OF THE COMBINATION OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY AND THEN THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BROUGHT IN TO MAKE IT WORK
DON'T KNOW IF I'M EXPLAINING THAT VERY WELL BUT HOW DO I GET TO THE NEXT S AH
SO H THE METHOD AS UM WORKING DESIGNERS FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE IT FULFIL THIS PRACTICAL FUNCTION
AT WHICH YOU NEED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN
UH
UH
WHICH THEN GOES THROUGH THE INFRA RED SO THE THE CHIP THAT UH I THINK IAN IS DESIGNING IS GONNA BE CRUCIAL
AND REALLY IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THE TO THE USER BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONE THAT'S CONTROLLING MOST OF THE WORKING DESIGN
SO THE COMPONENTS THAT WE FIND HERE ARE THE ENERGY SOURCE YOU KNOW THE BATTERY OR WHATEVER THAT'S GONNA M MAKE IT WORK THEN THE CHIP
WHICH CONVERTS THE DATA THE USER THAT'S CONTROLLING THE CHIP AND THE INFRA RED BULB THAT'S GONNA LET US MOVE THE DATA TO THE RECEIVER
SORRY ABOUT THIS GUYS
AND THE CHIP THROUGH THE USE OF THE USER INTERFACE IS GONNA CONTROL THE SWITCH WHICH WILL WORK YOUR INFRA RED BULB
WHICH WILL THEN BRING THE DATA TO THE RECEIVER
WE NEED A STRAIGHTFORWARD INTERFACE LIKE IAN WAS SAYING SIMPLE NOT OVERWHELMING IT WITH INFORMATION AND WE NEED A RELIABLE AND CLEAR INFRA RED SIGNAL
IT'S GONNA STICK IN YOUR HEAD
OOH NO SIGNAL
S
BUT IF YOU EVER SEE THE T. V. SAYING LIKE GO TO PAGE ONE SIXTY ON CEEFAX NOW THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY WE DON'T HAVE IT BUT
AND IS YELLOW
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY UH A POPULATION W QUITE A LITTLE BIT OF DISPOSABLE INCOME FOR USE ON TECHNOLOGY ANYWAY
EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS EASE OF USE AND SIMPLE AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN MORE TECHNOLOGY IN FACT IT COULD USE IT COULD MEAN NOT
THEY COULD HAVE A CRAP REMOTE THAT CAME WITH THEIR T. V. THAT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO USE OR MAYBE IT BROKE OR MAYBE THEY'RE JUST MISSING IT
OOH
OOH
THE BATTERY AND THAT I THINK THAT THE CHIP TAKES THE DATA AND PRESENTS IT WELL WITHOUT SORT OF SCATTERING
OOH
YEAH T PROBABLY
BATTERY BATTERY USE
YEAH BUT I THINK THAT GOES IN WITH SIMPLICITY AND EASE OF USE REALLY
SO YOU DON'T HA YOU GOT LIKE A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY
I DUNNO THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO LESS PEOPLE LOSING IT TOO IF IT IT STAYS IN ONE PLACE
YES I JUST DID THAT
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I HAVE IN
MM SHALL WE GO IN THE ORDER THAT YOU JUST DID IT
AH WAIT 'S SCREW IN
THEY HAD A HUNDRED SUBJECTS AND THEIR USABILITY LAB AND THEY WATCHED THEM WATCH T. V. AND RECORDED THE FREQUENCY THAT THEY USED PARTICULAR BUTTONS AND THE RELEVANCE THAT THOSE BUTTONS HAD
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING BEYOND WHAT FANCY MEANS BUT THAT'S PARTICULARLY OF USE TO US I THINK
UM ALSO THEY DID SOME QUESTIONS ON VOICE RECOGNITION AND FOUND THAT THE DESIRE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION WAS INVERSELY RELATED TO AGE
IT ALSO MENTIONED SOMETHING CALLED R. S. I. AND I WAS HOPING SOMEONE MIGHT BE ABLE TO INFORM ME AS TO WHAT R. S. I. IS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
AH
SO I GUESS SORT OF THE CARPAL TUNNEL TYPE THING PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THAT UM THE REPETITIVE USE I GUESS CAUSED A STRAIN
PEOPLE ARE ONLY USING TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTONS THAT THEY HAVE OFFERED TO THEM ON THEIR REMOTE
PEOPLE ALSO ZAP LIKE TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL ABOUT UM SIXTY FIVE PER CENT DURING AN HOUR OF USE
SO WE REALLY JUST NEED TO FOCUS IN ON THOSE VOLUMES AND CHANNEL CHANGERS RATHER THAN THINGS LIKE THE AUDIO SETTINGS
YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE AN AUDIO SETTING ISN'T GIVEN AS MUCH IMPORTANCE AND VISIBILITY ON THE REMOTE AS SOMETHING LIKE CHANNEL CHANGING THAT'S USED A LOT MORE OFTEN
OH SO
AFTER THIRTY FIVE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE IF IT HAS VOICE SO IT'S LIKE BASICALLY FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE THAT THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
HOW IS IT I MEAN IT CAN LOOK REALLY GREAT AND STILL HAVE THE SAME UP N DOWN BUTTONS AND WHY'S ANYONE GONNA BUY A NEW REMOTE
EITHER THIS WAY OR THIS WAY THAT HAD LIKE THE MAIN BUTTONS AND THEN YOU COULD LIKE PULL SOMETHING OUT
KIND OF AND LIKE YOU GOT THE REST THE BUTTONS BUT THE REST OF THEM LIKE WENT IN
NEVER EVEN HAVE TO SEE THEM AND IF YOU LIKE GET THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL THAT COMES WITH IT AND YOU JUST DON'T EVEN READ IT THEN YOU'LL NEVER EVEN KNOW THAT THOSE THINGS CAN PULL OUT
AND YOU'RE A HAPPY PERSON AND EVERYONE ELSE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE LIKE TWO REMOTES ONE THAT HAS THE EASY ONES AND ONE THAT HAS
WHAT CAN YOU DO TO LIKE MAKE THE INFRA RED MORE FUNCTIONAL LIKE WHY WOULD IT NOT BE
WELL I DUNNO HOW USEFUL THAT NUMBER IS IF WE'RE NOT DOING
AND IF THE WHOLE IDEA IS YOU'RE USING A REMOTE THEN WHY WOULD YOU HAVE VOICE
MAYBE I MEAN IF I GET M MORE NUMBERS I'LL E MAIL YOU BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING IN TERMS OF AGES
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A HUNDRED SUBJECTS THAT TH THEY THEN CAN SUBDIVIDE INTO AGE GROUPS THAT MEANS THERE'S VERY FEW IN EACH AGE GROUP SO
LIKE H T HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE TO SPEND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE
H
FIFTY PER CENT OF OF THE FRU F LIKE FRUSTRATION SOMEONE CAN HAVE THAT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE AND HALF THE PEOPLE SAID THAT HAPPENED AND WE ALL MENTIONED IT BEFORE WE KNEW ABOUT IT
AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING SOMETHING EASY THAT SORT OF GOES ALONG WITH IT SO IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE A RANDOM THING TO SORT OF ADD IN
ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE IT'S NOT LIKE AN EYE SORE THAT KIND OF THING
I ONLY HAVE THREE I JUST HAVE LIKE OUR THREE
NO BUT THAT'S 'CAUSE I THINK YOURS IS IN THE E MAIL SEPARATE LIKE IT'S NOT ON THE SERVER
OH WAIT NEVER MIND YOU CAN'T SAVE IT TO THE
WELL THERE'S A WEE A WEE PLUG JUST JUST THAT ONE THERE
AH THAT'S IT YEP
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PRESS FUNCTION F. EIGHT I THINK IT IS ON YOUR LAPTOP
WE NEED TO START BY CONSIDERING WHAT A REMOTE CONTROL ACTUALLY IS
FIRST THING TO DO IS TO COME UP WITH THE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT OUR FINAL PRODUCT IS GONNA BE LIKE SO WE NEED A A CLEAR IDEA OF EXACTLY WHAT THIS PRODUCT DOES
OH A WAY I'D SUGGEST THAT WE COULD GO ABOUT THIS IS BY DESIGNING UH SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROTOTYPES OF USER INTERFACES FOR THIS PRODUCT
UM AND THEN UH TRYING TO GET SOME FEEDBACK UH ABOUT
H HOW WELL THESE PARTICULAR PROTOTYPES WORK UH SORTA FIND OUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF 'EM
WHEN A USERS USING A REMOTE CONTROL HE OR SHE EXPECTS THE BUTTONS TO BE IN CERTAIN PLACES
BUT I THINK WITHIN THAT THERE IS ALSO ROOM FOR US TO INTRODUCE NOVEL IDEAS UH AND TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
UH THE FIRST OF THESE IS IS TECHNOLOGICAL YE UH WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF TECHNOLOGY AS IT IS
SO AS YOU MENTIONED THINGS LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD WOULD ADD TO THE PRICE UH BUT IT WOULD ALSO IM IMPROVE THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT
UM ON THE LEFT HERE WE'VE GOT UH AN ENGINEERING BASED DESIGN FOR A REMOTE CONTROL SO IT'S ONE THAT'S GOT LOTS OF BUTTONS
THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS A LOT MORE BASIC
IT'S JUST GOT THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE T. V. CHANGING THE CHANNEL PLAY STOP VOLUME
IT WOULD BE A LOT QUICKER TO LEARN TO USE IT BUT AGAIN TH IT'S IT'S SWINGS AND ROUNDABOUTS
THERE ARE DISADVANTAGES YOU CAN'T USE IT SAY TO TO FREEZE THE TELEVISION PICTURE
UM AS I SAID BEFORE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE SUBJECTIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WANT WANT DIFFERENT THINGS
IT IT DOES EVERYTHING THAT I NEED IT TO UH AS I SAID BEFORE
UH THAT WAS JUST ON THE D ON THE COMPANY WEB SITE YEAH
UH
OH I DIDN'T REALISE
UM YOU HAVE LIKE YOU HAVE UH NUMBERS ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL UH Y AND YOU TYPE IN THE PAGE NUMBER YOU WANT
SO LIKE YOU TYPE A HUNDRED ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL AND THIS THIS KIND OF INDEX APPEARS ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN WITH JUST SOME SOME TEXT AND SOME VERY BLOCKY LOOKING GRAPHICS ON IT
IS IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BE SOLD SEPARATELY FROM THE TELEVISION OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT COMES W WITH A TELEVISION
ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE MARKETING IT AS A SEPARATE PRODUCT PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE PAYING UH
LIKE SOME T. V. S THEY HAVE A SORT OF UH A SLIDING SCREEN ON THE REMOTE CONTROL OF IT THAT HIDES ALL THE COMPLICATED BUTTONS
SO IF YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING COMPLICATED LIKE PROGRAMME YOUR TELEVISION OR RE TUNE IT
SI SIMPLICITY AND FASHION
YEAH AIM FOR A AN INCOME GROUP
UM THESE ARE OUR MINUTES FROM R THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
AND S UM IN SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS ARE SOMETHING TO KEEP THE REMOTE FROM GETTING LOST LARGE BUTTONS FOR THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS
UH JUST A REAL QUICK QUESTION UM THE WEIGHT OF THESE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS HAVE YOU NO IDEA OKAY
UM IF YOU MADE NOTES YOURSELF YOU CAN PUT THOSE ON OUR UM UNDERNEATH OUR OH UH IN YOUR BOOK THEN DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
I DO THINK THAT UM ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FEATURES FOR A REMOTE IS SEEING A MENU AND SEEING WHAT'S ON
BUT I THINK TH THAT YOU DO NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF FUNCTION WHERE IT'S UM YOU HAVE T YOU CAN SEE THE TITLE OF THE SHOW OR POSSIBLY A DESCRIPTION OF IT
LIKE I I KNOW I USE THAT OFTEN ENOUGH
WELL IF IT IF IT WAS A L. L. C. D. ON TH ON THE REMOTE I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD F THAT YOU'D BE ABLE TO SEE A
OOPS IT'S NOT PLUGGED IN QUITE IN WELL ENOUGH
UM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS HOW TO POSSIBLY USE THESE
UM HOW TO HOW TO USE A FRUIT OR VEGETABLE OR UM OR THE SPONGY MATERIAL AT ALL
'CAUSE I THINK THE REASON THEY'RE LONG IS YEAH
BUT I MEAN IN ORDER TO GET TO ALL OF THEM YOU KNOW
IT'S A SCROLL YEAH IT'S A WHEEL
THE ONE I HAVE DOESN'T HAVE THE FOUR ON I LIKE AROUND IT I DON'T THINK
UM I'VE ONE MORE SLIDE BEFORE WE CLOSE BUT IN THAT SLIDE IS WHEN WE NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THIS THESE KINDS OF THINGS
THAT'S TH TH THIS IS THE AGENDA THEY GAVE ME
UM OH BU I GUESS MAYBE IF WE DECIDED ON LIKE A SIMPLE A REGULAR OR AN ADVANCED CHIP MAYBE
F
I THINK W WELL I THINK WHEN WE GO ON TO THE UNE USERFACE
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DECIDE THE INTERFACE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DECIDE UM WHETHER WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SCROLL OR NOT
UM AND PROBABLY IN COLOURS MAYBE FRUITY VEGETABLE COLOURS
OKAY UM LET'S GO TO THE UFE USER INTERFACE THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE CHIP I SUPPOSE
AND IF WE HAD A SC AN ON SCREEN UM KIND OF THING THAT YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH LIKE YOU CAN USE YOUR BUTTONS TO SCROLL THROUGH THINGS
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU
UM I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT ELSE WE'RE GONNA LIKE H HA THE UM THE ADDITIONAL BUTTONS WE CAN USE
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE A MENU BUTTON SO THAT WE CAN ACCESS ON SCREEN THINGS THEN
OKAY UM SO WE'RE DOING AN ON SCREEN MENU THAT WE CAN SCROLL THROUGH
WELL BUT IN ORDER TO PRE SET A CHA OH I GUESS YOU CAN JUST HOLD IT DOWN WHEN YOU GET TO ONE WHEN YOU'RE SCROLLING THROUGH
OH I DI THESE ARE ALREADY IN OUR SHARED FOLDER SO
THAT WOULD BE ME
THIS IS WHERE YOU LOOK AT WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL AND WHAT SHOULD WE MAKE OUR SPECIFIC REMOTE CONTROL OUT OF
SO WE NEED TO EXAMINE EACH ELEMENT SEPARATELY BUT WE'RE DESIGNING A FULL THING SO YOU WANNA KEEP IT INTEGRATED AS A WHOLE
ARE THE CASE THE BUTTONS THE CIRCUIT BOARD WITH THE CHIP AND THE BATTERY
BUT I'M GONNA TAKE EACH ONE A LITTLE BIT SEPARATELY HERE AS WE FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE MADE OF AND WHAT THEY SHOULD LOOK LIKE
BUT THESE ARE THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE FROM MANUFACTURING AND WE CAN MAKE OUR CASE OUT OF PLASTIC
THE M THE MAIN BASE WILL BE PLASTIC BUT WE HAVE ALL THESE SORT OF FASHION AND TECHNOLOGICAL ELEMENTS WE CAN ADD IN
UM CIRCUIT BOARD AND CHIP WE CAN HAVE A SIMPLE ONE A REGULAR ONE OR AN ADVANCED ONE DEPENDING ON WHAT OUR OTHER NEEDS ARE
AND THEN BATTERY I THINK IS WHERE THINGS GET MOST EXCITING
LIKE ARE USED IN HIGH TECH WATCHES WHERE YOU JUST HAVE TO MOVE IT A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT TO POWER UP
OR A SOLAR BATTERY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SLIGHT UM COMPLICATIONS WITH SOLAR BATTERIES AS IN WE CAN'T USE A LATEX CASE IF WE HAVE A SOLAR BATTERY
OR UM SOMETHING THEY ONLY DESCRIBED AS THE TYPE OF BATTERY YOU FIND IN TORCHES FROM ABOUT FIFTY YEARS AGO FLASHLIGHTS
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THAT IS BUT THAT'S THE DESCRIPTION THAT I RECEIVED SO THAT'S WHAT I'M PASSING ON TO YOU
SO THOSE ARE OUR OPTIONS
I THINK THAT THAT M WOULD BE A VERY INTERESTING THING
UH WE REALLY ONLY NEED A REGULAR OR ADVANCED CHIP T IF WE'RE GONNA START USING AN L. C. D.
UM I'D APPRECIATE ANYONE'S INPUT BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEING FOR THE FUTURE OF THE THE LOOK OF THIS THING
I'M NOT SURE BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS I GET ANY PICTURES
I KNOW IF WE DO HAVE A DOUBLE CURVED CASE IT CAN'T HAVE ANY TITANIUM IN IT
BUT THE TITANIUM THEY WERE QUITE THEY'RE MARKETING QUITE HARD TO US AS BEING USED IN THE SPACE PROGRAMME SO THAT COULD BE QUITE INTERESTING
I HOPE I DIDN'T GO THROUGH THAT TOO QUICKLY
YEAH N NO IDEA NO IDEA
UM BUT OTHER THAN THAT'S REALLY BASIC I MEAN THAT'S ALL I HAVE GOTTEN SO FAR
UH
JUST IN MY NOTEBOOK BUT IF ANYONE HAS ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS DON'T HESITATE TO EMAIL ME OR SOMETHING
G OH GEEZ
ARE YOU ARE YOU TAK
NO I THINK I THINK WE'RE TALKING MENU LIKE CONTRAST AND TUNING THE V. C. R. OR SOMETHING IF I'VE UNDERSTOOD YOU CORRECTLY RATHER THAN MENU AS WHAT'S ON
OOP THERE WE GO
UM MEAN
AN UH I IF TH MY UNDERSTANDING OF A LATEX CASE IS THAT IT'S IN FACT HARD TO PROTECT STUFF INSIDE
IT'S THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID I MEAN WE WE GOT THAT THING EARLIER FROM YOU ABOUT UM NOT WANTING IT TO
OH WELL IT'S QUITE EASY TO S SHAPE THING LIKE CARROT ISN'T IT
BE YEAH
IT'D BE HARDER TO F BU UH BUTTONS I THINK
I WHEN I'M WHEN I'M PRESSING BUTTONS ON MY IPOD THAT'S HOW I DO IT HOLD IT AND PRESS THE FOUR
YEAH OR IN AND USE MY THUMB OR MY POINTER FINGER ON THE TOUCH SCROLL WHEEL
SINCE IT'S THE ONE IN THE CENTRE THAT'S NOT MARKED YEAH
UH UH T
YEAH I THINK AN L. C. D. SCREEN MIGHT BE GOOD IN THEORY BUT NOT AS USEFUL IN PRACTICE
OH WE PROBABLY HAVE TO GET GOING DON'T WE
OOH
UH HU OH OH YES
AM I
BUT UM BUT IF WE'RE USING A AN I A CHEAPER CHIP THEN IT'LL EVEN OUT I THINK
THEY'RE THEY'RE THIN FIBREGLASS WITH COPPER WIRES ETCHED ON TO THEM AND DI I THINK THEY'RE QUITE EASILY PRINTED ON BY MACHINE
WELL OKAY HERE'S THE HERE'S THE THING ON THE CHIPS THAT I THAT I GOT
YEAH TH IT'D BE IT'D BE HANDY FOR GOING THROUGH IF THERE WAS AN ON SCREEN MENU OF YOUR CHANNEL CHOICES THAN YOU CAN SCROLL DOWN ON THE SCROLL
F OR FOR ALL THOSE SECRET FUNCTIONS
WHEN YOU GET ON THE ON SCREEN MENU OF ALL YOUR FUNCTIONS THAT YOUR REMOTE COULD DO FOR YOU WITHOUT THE BUTTONS AND YOU COULD HAVE A SCROLL WHEEL TO GO THROUGH THOSE MENUS
UH I'M KINDA LIKING THE IDEA OF LATEX IF IF SPONGY IS THE IN THING
UH YEAH EVERYTHING I'VE
N OH WHA WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE SEEN JUST NOT RELATED TO THIS BUT OF LATEX CASES BEFORE
IS THAT THERE'S UH LIKE A HARD PLASTIC INSIDE AND IT'S JUST COVERED WITH THE LATEX
OH AND WE WANT A CURVED CASE YEAH
I SAY PUSHBUTTONS AT LEAST UNLESS WE GET ANY INFORMATION BUT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE A SCROLL WHEEL IS THAN THAN A PUSHBUTTON
SO WHAT ARE WHAT ARE OUR BUTTONS GONNA BE
SO LIKE ONE THROUGH FIVE OR
OOH
IS DOUBLE CURVED LIKE WOULD BE LIKE TWO HANDS KIND OF THING
SHOULD I PLUG THAT IN
MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT IS IT ON
RI WHAT F. DO YOU HAVE TO PRESS FIVE
IF ANYTHING THE THAT THEY GAVE ME
OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK A LITTLE BIT AT TREND WATCHING
SO FIRST UM THEY HAD PEOPLE THEY RANKED UM THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF R REMOTE CONTROLS
BUT THAT REALLY OVER THE NEXT YEAR IT IT THAT'S GONNA BE SWITCHING TO FANCY LOOK AND FEEL REMOTES SO THAT JUST GOES BACK TO
AND AS THESE ARE RANKED THE TOP ONE IS DOUBLY IMPORTANT TO THE SECOND ONE
WHICH IS DOUBLY IMPORTANT TO THE THIRD ONE SO JUST TO TAKE THAT WEIGHT INTO ACCOUNT
AND THEN EASE OF USE WAS THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT WHI SO REALLY
NO MATTER WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS THE MOST ON FANCY LOOK AND FEEL ACCORDING TO THIS
SHOES AND FURNITURE IS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND THA THAT THERE'S A PREFERENCE FOR SPONGY TIGHT MATERIAL
WHO WANTS A SPONGY REMOTE OR ONE WITH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PADDING
PERSONALLY I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT I WANT ONE THAT'S GONNA GO OUT OF STYLE OR GO STALE EXCUSE THE PUN UM IN A YEAR SO
ALSO CONSIDERING THAT THE D RESEARCH B HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT BY REAL REACTION I'M A LITTLE HESITANT AS TO LIKE
HOW THESE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN WORDED AND IF NECESSARILY THIS WHOLE FASHION TO TECHNOLOGY Y EDAS EASE OF USE IS NECESSARILY THE RIGHT RANKING
LIKE I'M IMAGINING THAT SORT OF THING I DON'T KNOW WHAT TH THAT MATERIAL'S CALLED
OH GOD
INSTEAD OF LIKE A VERTICAL UP AND DOWN ONE
JUST TO TIE IT IN A LITTLE
I LOVE THE IDEA OF THE WHEEL LIKE THE IPOD
'CAUSE TH
IT'S LIKE FIVE 'CAUSE THERE'S ONE IN THE MIDDLE
LIKE JUST THE IDEA OF LIKE THOSE SO FEW BUTTONS FOR MAIN THINGS BUT THEN HOW YOU COULD GO BACK TO THE MENU AND LIKE
I DUNNO IF WE WOULD WANT IT ON THE SCREEN THERE OR ON THE ACTUAL T. V.
I KIND OF AM WANTING TO SAY ON THE T. V. 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE CHANGING THE BRIGHTNESS DON'T YOU WANNA SEE IT HAPPENING KIND OF
IF I GET ANY MORE INFORMATION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES I'LL LET YOU KNOW
THE IPOD PACKAGING IS ME LIKE WAS SO THAT WAS LIKE HALF THE FUN
IT'S LIKE THE WAY IT ALL COMES ALL CUTE
T TOTALLY TAKE CARE OF OUR PROBLEM OF NOT WANTING TO CHANGE BATTERIES
AND THE VOLUME WOULD JUST BE LIKE THE SAME WAY FORWARD AND BACKWARD AS I'M JUST THINKING LIKE IT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH LIKE SLEEKER SORT OF LOOKING
BLACK WITH RED STICKING OUT AND TH NO IT'S GONNA INEVITABLY SORT OF START LOOKING LIKE THOSE GROUP OF SORT OF UGLY ONES THAT WE SAW STACKED UP
OH COULD IT BE HARD AND THEN SOMETHING AROUND IT
AND LET'S LIKE SEE IF WE GET ANYTHING ELSE
I MEAN I'M NOT LIKE HARD SOLD ON THE SCROLL WHEEL IT'S MORE JUST TO GIVE IT A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOOK
JESS
WE WANT IT TO BE SIMPLE AND WE WANT IT TO BE FASHIONABLE
OTHER WE'VE ALSO GOT TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A DEVICE THAT SERVES AS A USEFUL PURPOSE
UH WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT S AS A REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE D OF THE DEVICE ARE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDE THAT WE'VE INCLUDED ALL OF THOSE AND THAT WE ACTUALLY END UP WITH A DEVICE THAT IS GOING TO BE USEFUL TO PEOPLE
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CHOICES FOR A DESIGN CONCEPT UM AND S THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT I'LL SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF UM
MAKING SURE THAT WE GET ALL THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS IN THE DEVICE AND UH THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS AND THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES
M WE DON'T WANT LOTS OF BUTTONS UH COMPLICATED FEATURES
THIS IS AN AN IPOD FROM APPLE
UH YOU USE THESE FOUR BUTTONS TO M TO MOVE AROUND A RANGE OF SETTINGS ON THE SMALL L. C. D. SCREEN
UH YOU CAN JUST ABOUT MAKE OUT UH THAT THE BUTTON THREE BUTTONS ARE UH PREVIOUS TRACK NEXT TRACK AND PLAY PAUSE
THE BUTTONS ARE ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND AND YOU CAN SORT OF YEAH IF YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. IN THE DARK OR WHATEVER
YOU CAN WORK OUT WHICH BUTTON'S WHICH AND BASICALLY YEAH IT'S ITH IT'S FUN
THEY HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY CHANNELS ON THEIR T. V. AND THEY WATCH OF 'BOUT FOUR OF THEM AT THE MOST
UM BUT THESE ARE THESE ARE ALL NECESSARY FUNCTIONS
UH YOU CAN'T HAVE A T THERE'S NO POINT HAVING A TELEVISION THAT YOU CAN'T TUNE OR THAT YOU CAN'T SET THE CONTRAST
UM AND ONE OTHER SUGGESTIONS I'D MAKE IS TO IN IS TO INCLUDE IN A MENU SYSTEM A BIT LIKE ON THE IPOD
OR UH HAVE A DIS A MENU DISPLAY THAT COMES UP ON YOUR TELEVISION AND CAN B BE CONTROLLED THROUGH THE DEVICE
BECAUSE IT'S IT IT LETS YOU JUST SORT OF SIT THERE AND ST AND CONTROL YOUR TELEVISION FROM YOUR ARMCHAIR
'CAUSE WE'RE WE'RE I WELL WE'RE I ASSUME WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING QUITE A SMALL DEVICE
'CAUSE YOU TEN YOU TEND TO WATCH T. V. IN THE DARK BUT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR L. D. D. L. C. D. DISPLAY
THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO HAVE A AN ON SCREEN DISPLAY ON YOUR TELEVISION THAT YOU CONTROL THROUGH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
UH
A BIT LIKE A BIT LIKE HOW THEY HAVE THESE UM DIGITAL BOXES WHERE YOU YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS AND IT COMES UP WITH YOUR THIS THING OF WATCH LO WHAT'S ON EACH CHANNEL
THE C UH COMMUNICATION IS ONE WAY SO YOU CAN'T HAVE THE TELEVISIONS AND INFORMATION BACK TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AT LEAST I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
IS THAT GOING ON
I IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE SHAPED LIKE A VEGETABLE
BUT IF YOU'VE ONLY GOT LIKE FOUR OR FIVE BUTTONS ANYWAY THEN IT'S IT'S NOT SO MUCH A PROBLEM PERHAPS
IS THAT THE BUTTON ON AN IPOD IS IT WHAT IS IT IS IT JUST FOUR BUTTONS OR IS IT LI MORE LIKE A SCROLL THING
OH I SEE RIGHT YEAH
ALSO Z YEAH 'CAUSE YOU WOULD BE Z LOOKING DOWN AT THE L. C. D. SCREEN THAN BACK UP AT YOUR T. V. AND PEOPLE DON'T WANNA DO THAT
I THINK MAYBE TH THE PACKAGING IT SHOULD BE LIKE A LEMON AND THE THE PACKAGING IS LIKE THE PEEL
I DON'T THINK WE NE REALLY NEED THE SCROLL WHE WHEEL
'CAUSE THEN WE CAN HAVE A A SIMPLE CHIP AND IT'S SIMPLER IT'S IT'S CHEAPER TO MAKE PUSHBUTTONS THAN IT IS A SCROLL BUTTON
UM IN
ON OFF UH VOLUME FAVOURITE CHANNELS UH AND MENU
YEAH YEAH ABOUT YEAH LIKE YEAH A BIT LIKE RADIO PRESETS
WE'LL LOOK AT THE FINANCES AND FINALLY A DO A PRODUCTION EVALUATION AND CLOSE
SO STARTING OFF WITH THE UM LAST THE LAST ONE OH I DON'T HAVE IT HERE UM BUT WE TALKED ABOUT ENERGY
WE'RE CHOOSING A LATEX CASE W IN FRUITY COLOURS THAT'S CURVED AND UM WE'RE USING PUSH BUTTONS UH WITH A SUPPLEMENT OF AN ON SCREEN MENU
THE LITTLE LIGHTNING BOLT IN IT VERY CUTE
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU PICKED UP YOUR EMAIL BUT UM THE F THE UM FEATURE THAT WE CONSIDERED FOR IT NOT GETTING LOST
WOULD IT BE VERY DIFFICULT TO UM JUST HAVE AN EXTERNAL DEVICE THAT LIKE I DUNNO
YOU TAPE TO YOUR TO YOUR T. V. UM THAT WHEN YOU PRESS IT YOU HA A LITTLE LIGHT BEEP GOES OFF
OKAY 'CAUSE WELL THE DESIGNS ARE VERY BRIGHT SO YOU'RE RIGHT THEY'RE GONNA STICK OUT BUT UM
COULD WE MAYBE HAVE LIKE AN EXTRA BUTTON ON THE TOP FOR ON OFF
SO THEN W WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE LIKE A DUAL FUNCTION
DO YOU NEED THIS OR JUST WRITE ON THE WHITE BOARD
OH IT DOES IT'S KIND OF LIKE
UM IN THAT LIKE I WITHING MENUS THERE ARE SUBMENUS AND SO HOW DO YOU GET BACK TO THE MAIN MENU
WELL AS LONG AS WE HAVE THAT IN MIND AS WE'RE DESIGNING IT STILL MM 'KAY
I THINK IT'LL GET EVERYTHING DONE I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE CONFUSING AT FIRST UM I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GONNA BE A LATER ONE
THINK I'M GONNA GO WITH THE FOUR AS WELL
WE DIDN'T KEEP THAT IN UM WELL IF WE I KNOW IT WOULD MAKE IT A LITTLE LESS C A LITTLE MORE CONFUSING
THAT'D BE OUR CORPORATE ONE AND WE COULD ALSO HAVE ALTERNATIVE COLOURS ONE A MORE CONSERVATIVE ONE ONE THAT'S MORE FRUITY
FRUITY SO FRUITY
ONE
I THINK I'D GIVE IT A FOUR TOO
WE WE I THINK WE CAN KIND OF SAY WE ADDRESSED IT WITH COLOUR BUT
SMALL TOO
THREE
ONE
I THINK AS LONG IF WE OFFER IN A IN AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT COLOUR ARRANGEMENTS
WELL UM WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T ADDRESS THE FACT THAT IT DOES NEED TO B HAVE A CORPORATE LOGO
SO LET'S LET'S MAKE SURE WE KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT WE HA THAT ONE OF OUR COLOURS CONCEPTS IS CORPORATE AND HAS AN R. R. ON IT
ONE OKAY
SO LET'S Y SAY THREE
THAT I THI I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE UNDER YOURS
MAYBE THE R. R. WILL BE IN COLOUR AS WELL SO YEAH
OH BUTTONS OH SO UM
SO THE CASE MATERIAL WILL JUST HAVE ONE COLOUR RIGHT BUT THEN THE BUTTONS WILL BE IN SPECIAL COLOURS
OKAY SO EACH UNIT WILL ONLY HAVE ONE COLOUR ON THEIR BUT THE CASE IS
COULD HAVE UP TO THR I MEAN THE BUTTONS COULD EA COULD BE UP TO THREE COLOURS 'CAUSE THAT HOW IT'S DESIGNED THERE
UH
OH DO I HAVE TO DO IT PER BUTTON DO I
IT'S ONLY GONNA BRING US DOWN TO THIRTEEN POINT THREE ANYWAY
MAYBE IT'S SINGLE CURVED WE HAVE NO IDEA
I SAVED THAT TO OUR UM OUR BIG SHARED FOLDER SO YOU KNOW
UM ARE THE ARE THE COSTS UNDER TWELVE FIFTY EURO
SO I GUESS WHAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT HERE IS JUST EVALUATING HOW WE CREATED THIS PROJECT THE INFORMATION WE GOT ON THE NEWS
HOW WE USED IT IF WE WERE ABLE TO UM YOU KNOW USE OUR CREATIVITY WITH THE INFORMATION
UM HOW HOW WELL I GUESS I LED IT UM THE HOW WELL WE WORKED TOGETHER AS A TEAM UM THE DIGITAL PENS THE WHITEBOARD
LIKE EACH OF US WAS ABLE TO UM LIKE EACH OF YOU HAD YOUR INFORMATION AND I UH I TRIED TO FACILITATE IT WITHOUT LIKE TAKING OVER UM
I KNOW LET'S THINK OF IT LIKE A LITTLE JINGLE
OH I'M SO EXCITED
I THI YEAH THAT'S AWESOME
ARE THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET
IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED
UM ANYBODY HAVE I GOT MORE MASTER CLASSES ANYBODY ELSE WANNA LIKE TAKE A MASTER'S CLASS
YEAH BUT CHECK IT OUT
SO LIKE THERE ARE ALL THESE LIKE LINKS THEY DON'T GO ANYWHERE
YES DEFINITELY I'M VERY SAD THAT I DIDN'T GET ANY LINKS TO THE CORPORATE WEBSITE
ALTHOUGH I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD HAVE VERY L AT LEAST FOR ME I
AND WITH AND WITH THE POWERPOINT THAT WE CAN ALL LOOK AT
LIKE YOU CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS PRETTY MUCH ON POWERPOINT AS THAT'S NOT AS NECESSARY TO HAVE
YEAH I THINK THE LAST TIME WE HAD A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT QUITE ENOUGH
IT WAS INTERESTING WHAT CAME OUT LIKE LATER LIKE AS I WAS DOING THE WHEN I WAS DOING THE BREAKDOWN ON THE AGENDA THAT THEY GAVE ME UM
ABOUT YEAH
CONSIDERED THE RE YEAH
I KNOW THAT LIKE PEOPLE PEOPLE HAVE LIKE THINGS THEY CAN PUT ON THEIR KEYS THAT YOU PRESS IT AND IT'LL BEEP
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT
IT D YEAH IT DEPENDS ON HOW ORGANISED YOU ARE PERSONALLY BUT
CAN'T GET IN
WELL BUT IF YOU COULD ATTACH THEM TO THE T. V. THEN YOU CAN
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE LIKE INFORMATION TO SLOTH THROUGH EITHER SO
WELL THE THING WAS THEY WOULD PROVIDE Y AN AGENDA WITH S LIKE SEVERAL POINTS BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE A SLIDE FOR EACH POINT
AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I REMEMBER THAT I NEED TO GO OTHER THAT POINT
I KNOW PERSONALLY WHEN I DO POWERPOINT THAT'S WHAT I DO AND SO I HAD IT ONCE
YEAH I WAS JUST KINDA GOING BY THE WEB PAGE 'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME ANY CLEAR LIKE YELLOW GREY OR
UM WE HAVE OUR COLOURS NOT ARE NOT FIXED BUT THIS IS THE GENERAL SHAPE
UM IT'S YOU HOLD IT SORT OF EITHER LIKE LIKE THIS IN YOUR LEFT HAND OR YOU SWITCH IT OVER AND UH IT'S EASILY ADAPTABLE TO EITHER HAND
INDEX FINGER OF YOUR OTHER HAND OR EVEN I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE VARIETY YOU CAN HOLD IT LIKE THIS AND PRESS IT WITH YOUR SAME INDEX FINGER
UH WE HAVE THE ON OFF BUTTON AT THE TIP VERY VISIBLE VERY BIG
WE HAVE OUR UP AND DOWN BUTTONS WHICH ARE ALSO GONNA BE OUR CHANNEL SELECTORS AND WE HAVE OUR LITTLE MENU BUTTON HERE
IF YOU PUSH IF YOU'RE JUST PUSHING THESE NORMALLY THEY'RE THE MENU BUTTONS IF UH THE VOLUME BUTTONS RATHER
UM IF PEOPLE WANNA GRAB HOLD OF THAT SEE HOW IT FEELS IN YOUR HAND
IF YOU PRESSED AND HELD IT MAYBE
WE FIGURED IT COULD STAND UP LIKE THIS ON YOUR TABLE IF YOU WANTED IT TO IF I MADE THE BOT THE BOTTOM FLAT
MIGHT NOT WANT A FRUITY COLOURED REMOTE SO M MAYBE WE'D HAVE ONE VERSION THAT'S A BIT TONED DOWN MAYBE WITH WITH LESS CONTRASTS ON IT
WELL WE WERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE GOT THAT EMAIL AND WE THINK THAT EACH OF THESE ARE SO DISTINCTIVE
SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT THINKING THAT IT'S GONNA BE AS CRITICAL TO HAVE THE LOSS
TO MAKE IT MAKE A NOISE OR SOMETHING BUT IT WOULD TAKE A LOT MORE DEVELOPMENT THAN WE HAVE THIS AFTERNOON
SO D DO PEOPLE HAVE A PREFERENCE AS FAR AS FEEL AND FUNCTIONALITY
HERE STICK IT ON
OOH
OKAY IS THAT WHERE PEOPLE ARE LEANING THEN THE POTATO
WELL THAT ON THE IPOD FOR EXAMPLE YOU JUST EVERY TIME YOU WANNA GO BACK YOU HIT THE MENU BUTTON AGAIN AND IT BRINGS YOU BACK ONE LEVEL
MAYBE YEAH MAYBE IT CAN BE ONE OF THOSE IF YOU PRESS DOWN AND HOLD
I DUNNO IF FANCY IS THE WORD I WOULD USE
YEAH ONE
YEAH LIKE FANCY VERSUS CREATIVE IT'S IT'S
OOH THAT YOU COULDN'T IT'D BE HARDER TO BREAK HARDER TO LOSE
BECAUSE OLDER PEOPLE THAT AREN'T USED TO LIKE TEXTING WITH THE THUMB MIGHT FIND IT A BIT AT FIRST BUT
BUT I THINK IF IT'S ONE IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT IT MIGHT TAKE YOU FIVE MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT BUT YOU'LL HAVE IT AFTERWARDS
I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE AS FASHIONABLE AS MY ROBOT REMOTE
UH WE'RE N USING KINETIC YEAH
YEAH I NEVER DID GET A PICTURE OF THOSE SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW
NO WE WE THE PLASTIC IS THE PLASTIC FOR THE INSIDE IS ASSUMED
OH I GUESS IT WAS RUBBER RATHER THAN LATEX
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SE THE BASIC COLOUR IS THOUGH
WELL ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ON EACH COLOUR COMBINATION OR ARE WE YOU KNOW WE'LL LIKE WE'LL HAVE YELLOW AND BLACK
IS THAT TWO SPECIAL COLOURS
OR OR IS WHITE AND BLACK THEN TWO MORE OR
UH
I GUESS IT'S THREE THREE THREE
OH WE'LL DO WE WA
ARE THE BUTTONS IN SPECIAL COLOUR SPECIAL F
ALRIGHT AND EACH BUTTON S
OH OH
UH
WE HAVE NO IDEA
HOW DID IT GET MORE EXPENSIVE WHAT DID YOU JUST CHANGE
ISH
CAN WE MARKET THIS AS THE MANGO REMOTE
SHOULD WE HAVE THAT SOMEWHERE ON THE PACKAGING
HOPEFULLY NOT WITH JUST MY FINGERNAIL AT SOME POINT BUT UM IT'S QUITE A USEFUL LITTLE GADGET
ALL THANKS TO IAIN FOR THE DESIGN OF THAT ONE
WHAT DID WE FIND FOR NEW IDEAS
I I AM REALLY INTO THE IDEA OF KINETIC BATTERIES NOW AFTER READING ABOUT THEM
I I KNEW YOU CAN GET WATCHES THAT HAD THEM LIKE REALLY QUITE EXPENSIVE WATCHES THAT JUST NEVER NEED A BATTERY 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS MOVING YOUR WRIST
IT STARTED BECAUSE I WANTED TO HAVE IT AS ST AS A STEM AND THEN ALRIGHT SO
IS IT STARTED AS A PEAR BUT THEN IT STARTED LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE A MARTIAN WHEN I PUT THE
TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER
WOW MAYBE I SHOULD MARKET IT TO SOME REMOTE CONTROL COMPANY NOW
IT'S REALLY FUNNY THAT YOU GOT SPAM IN YOUR WORK EMAILS
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED THIS YOU JUST NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE CASE
THAT WAS REALLY NEAT HOW I GOT EMAILS AND
YEAH WE COULD'VE PUT OUR BRAINSTORMING STUFF UP THERE RATHER THAN JUST TALKING ABOUT IT BUT WITH ONLY FOUR PEOPLE IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE
WE IF WE WERE ALL GONNA STAY IN HERE ALL THE TIME THEN HAVING THE NOTES UP ON THE WHITEBOARD WOULD'VE BEEN ALRIGHT
JUST FOOLING AROUND WITH IT AND I CAME UP WITH THAT RHOMBUS SHAPE AND HE CAME UP WITH THE SORT OF POTATOEY
MANGOEY SHAPE AND THEN JUST WENT FROM THERE REALLY
SO WELL DONE WITH THE MANAGEMENT I FELT WELL MANAGED
I'M NOT USUALLY A VERY DECISIVE PERSON SO IT HELPED TO HAVE PEOPLE SAY THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE IN FIVE MINUTES
AND I I FELT THE FIRST TWO MEETINGS THAT I WAS COMING IN WITH NO INFORMATION AND NOT SORT OF
MADE ME REALLY LIKE OOH I DON'T KNOW THROWING TOGETHER POWERPOINT OUT OF NO NO INFORMATION AND THEN LAST TIME IT WAS LIKE THE OPPOSITE
I HAD SO MUCH INFORMATION AND SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT
I THINK WE REALLY GOT INTO IT I MEAN I GOT INTO IT AS THE DAY WENT ON AND I GOT REALLY LIKE
OOH I'M DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL I DUNNO IF THAT'S JUST ME BUT
THERE'S ONLY ABOUT TWO PLACES THAT THE REMOTE IS EVER 'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE T. V. AND
YEAH OR LIKE I GUESS WHAT THE SETUP OF THE HOUSE IS TOO
YOU YOU'RE TAKING STUFF FROM A BAG AND PUTTING THEM IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND THEN GO BACK TO MY ROOM
CAN'T GET IN LOOK ALL AROUND THE KITCHEN
OH A G. P. S. SYSTEM INTERNAL G. P. S.
OR LITTLE
OR JUST JUST A WHEEL YOU KNOW
'CAUSE I WOULD JUST GET SLIDES WITH TITLES ON THEM AND FILL THEM ALL IN W DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT ADDING MORE
AH YEAH
WELL WE'RE NOT SADLY GOING TO ACTUALLY BE PRODUCING THIS SO
I CAN'T BELIEVE A WHOLE DAY IS GONE
COULD THE MIDDLE BUTTON OF THE ON SCREEN MENU FUNCTION AS A POWER BUTTON
IF YOU LIKE HELD IT DOWN THAT WOULD BE ON OFF
SORRY WHAT'S THE YELLOW ONE IN THE MIDDLE I FORGOT
BUT IF IT'S LIKE UNDER COVERS OR LIKE IN A COUCH YOU STILL CAN'T SEE IT
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS SIMIL OR IT'S SORT OF WHAT ALREADY EXISTS SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING SORT OF LIKE NEW AND FUN
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE INIT I'M INITIALLY DRAWN TO JUST 'CAUSE IT'S LIKE COMFORTABLE AND LIKE NOT DIFFERENT
BUT I ALSO LIKE THE B THE SIDE BUTTONS ON THAT ONE LIKE I THINK THAT'S KIND OF NEAT
AH THERE WE GO
WELL DO WE W LIKE I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ONE THAT WE DO IT FOR
OKAY SO WHICH ONE ARE WE SORT OF ROUGHLY LOOKING AT TO ADDRESS WHETHER OR NOT IT MEETS OUR S UM NECESSITIES THE YELLOWY ONE IS THAT
SO WE'LL JUST GO THROUGH THEM ONE AT A TIME AND WE'LL JUST GO AROUND AND EACH OF YOU CAN TELL ME ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN WITH ONE BEING REALLY EXTREMELY TRUE
AND SEVEN BEING NOT TRUE AT ALL OR FALSE IF THE REMOTE THAT WE'VE CREATED CONFORMS TO THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA
OKAY WELL GIVE IT A NUMBER SORRY
ALRIGHT AND SAME SORT OF SCALE FOR FUNCTIONALITY IS IT FUNCTIONAL
ONE
YEAH SHE SAID IT WAS ONE
UM IS IT TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
NOT REALLY I MEAN NOT SO MUCH 'CAUSE WE WE DON'T HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN WE DON'T HAVE FANCY CHIP
I KINETIC BATTERY IS A BIG ONE SO
IAIN WHAT DO YOU GIVE IT
ALRIGHT AND THE NEXT IS DOES IT INTEGRATE SOME NOTION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
WELL IS IT GONNA BE YELLOW
I OKAY I'M GIVING IT A ONE THE MANGO PUT ME OVER
I THINK WE REALLY TOOK THAT INTO ACCOUNT A LOT SO I'M GONNA GIVE IT A ONE
I JUST GOT MINE I STILL HAVEN'T READ THE INSTRUCTION BOOK AND I'M DOING OKAY SO AND I'M NOT GOOD AT LEARNING TECHNOLOGY
OKAY SO IN TERMS OF NOT LOSING IT DO YOU THINK THAT ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN HOW EASY OR HARD IS IT TO LOSE
I'M GONNA I'M GONNA GIVE IT A FOUR 'CAUSE I THINK THAT YOU CAN STILL IF IT'S IN BETWEEN SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE IT
ALRIGHT WE ALSO SAID SIMPLICITY HOW W HOW WELL DOES IT ADDRESS JUST BEING SIMPLE
I THINK OVERALL 'CAUSE WE HAD SAID BEFORE OUR TWO MAIN THINGS WERE SIMPLICITY AND FASHION SO THOSE ARE THE NEXT TWO THINGS WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT
SEPARATE FROM FANCY LIKE THAT SORT OF THING
AND DOES IT MEET OUR LIKE DEMOGRAPHIC NEED SORT OF FOR INTERNATIONAL APPEAL
AND SO WE'RE GONNA DO THAT SO IT WILL ADDRESS IT FINE
WHOA
OH NO FIVE
I KNOW I REALLY DID THE THE WHOLE MANGO IDEA WAS GREAT
THAT WAS THE LAST ONE LIKE I CHOSE NOT TO DO A POWERPOINT 'CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT MADE SENSE TO
I LIKE THE R. R. THAT'S GONNA BE ETCHED IN
OH THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE MY SECOND CHOICE
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A PENGUIN LIKE WITH NO EYE
OH SAD
NO THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU SENT LIKE I DIDN'T REALISE THAT IT WAS A JOKE AND I WAS LIKE WHY DID SHE SEND THIS TO US
OH HERE YOU CAN YOU CAN VIEW
THAT KIND OF THING SEE
THIS ONE WAS COOLER
THAT'S LIKE MINE IT WAS LIKE WOULD YOU PREFER AN L. C. D. SCREEN OR A MULTIFUNCTION REMOTE CONTROL
AND THESE MIGHT'VE MADE US MORE WILLING TO LIKE TAKE NOTES THAN TO
LIKE WRITE UP THEM HERE 'CAUSE WE ALL NEEDED THEM SEPARATELY KIND OF ON THE WHITEBOARDS IN THIS ROOM
THERE WASN'T LIKE A OPTION TO SELECT TO SOMEHOW HAVE IT INCLUDED SO THERE WAS NO WE COULD BE LIKE YEAH IT HAS IT INCLUDED
THERE WAS NO WAY FOR US TO HAVE
YOU'LL LOSE 'EM IN YOUR POCKET LIKE YOU JUST WILL FORGET THAT OR YOU LIKE PUT IT DOWN SOMEWHERE THAT LIKE MADE SENSE AND THEN NOT REMEMBER
I ALWAYS DO THAT LEAVING IT IN MY COAT AND THEN LIKE USING A DIFFERENT COAT
IS IT YELLOW AND BLUE
OH I GUESS IT IS BLACK GREY
IT'S KIND OF AN THEY WERE SO NOT BACKED UP IT WOULD JUST BE A SENTENCE LIKE WE DID A SURVEY THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE SAID
S MM I DUNNO
WE CALL THAT ONE THE RHOMBUS UH THE RHOMBUS
IT'S AN ERGONOMIC SHAPE SO IT IT FITS IN YOUR HAND NICELY
IT'S DESIGNED TO BE USED EITHER IN YOUR LEFT HAND OR OR IN YOUR RIGHT HAND
THE TWO BLUE BUTTONS HERE ARE FOR ADJUSTING THE VOLUME
UH THIS MIDDLE BUTTON HERE BRINGS UP THE ON SCREEN MENU AND WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN THE ON SCREEN MENU YOU USE THE OTHER FOUR BUTTONS TO NAVIGATE AROUND THE MENU SYSTEM AND THE MIDDLE BUTTON UH TO SELECT
UH THAT WOULD BE ONE OF YOUR CHANNELS BASICALLY SO LIKE CHANNEL ZERO WOULD BE T TO SWITCH SWITCH THE MACHINE OFF YEAH
SO THAT'S OUR THREE PROTOTYPES
WHAT WE'D NEED TO DO IS FIRST OF ALL DECIDE ON A FORM UH WHICH OF THE THREE DIFFERENT SHAPES WE WANT
LIKE LABEL ON THE BUTTONS OR PUT A BRAND NAME OR OR A LOGO ON IT OR WHATEVER
BUT WE DON'T WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE A KIDS' TOY
BECAUSE IF YOUR IF YOUR REMOTE'S LOST IT'S PROBABLY UNDER THE SETTEE AND IN THAT CASE YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T SEND AN INFRARED SING SIGNAL TO IT TO FIND IT
S SO IT'S
UH I MEAN HO HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU REALLY SERIOUSLY LOSE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL AND WOULD WOULD A DEVICE LIKE THAT ACTUALLY HELP YOU TO FIND IT
I'D SAY IT'S TECHNOLOGICALLY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT UNIQUE I MEAN IT'S IT'S JUST IT IS JUST PUSHBUTTONS UM SO I I'D GIVE IT A FOUR
I'LL SAY ONE
UH ONE
THREE
OH SIX
SO WE'RE JUST JUST ABOUT THERE
BUT I THINK HERE WE GOT WE GOT CLEAR AND AND DECISIVE DECISIVE POINTS AT THE END OF THE MEETINGS
SO THAT WE WE KNEW WHERE TO GO ON FROM THERE
ARE YOU SURE I GOT IT ALL HEAD'S KINDA SMALL
UH OKAY
I'M SARAH I WENT TO MICHIGAN AND I'M HERE DOING CULTURAL STUDIES AND I'M THE MARKETING MANAGER OR SOMETHING
SO DO WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOU TO WRITE IT DOWN OR ARE YOU GONNA TELL US
UH
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH TOM WILLING ACTUALLY
HE IS A BIG GUY
OH YOU'RE MUCH TALLER THAN ME SO I'M GONNA WRITE DOWN HERE
UH WHAT ELSE DID I BRING WITH ME
PROBABLY CLASSICAL TO TOTALLY GEEK IT OUT YEAH I THINK
ARE YOU GETTING IT ONLINE OR IS IT ON SKY
I DIDN'T EVEN READ THOSE
YEAH OH IT'S SO HORRIBLE
IT REALLY IS
AND I'M GONNA GO HOME NEXT WEEK AND EVERYONE'S GONNA BE LIKE OH MY GOD YOU'RE TURNING INTO ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE NO
OH IT SHOULD BE INTERESTING
THEY'RE GONNA LOVE THAT ONE
OR AT LEAST GET A WORK VISA FOR A WHILE AND THEN DECIDE
OH NOW I CAN THINK OF SO MANY OTHER ONES
ANY THING THAT ARE LIKE FREE
AH
UH
UH
I LIKE THE LITTLE COVER THINGIES
LIKE YOUR MICROWAVE OR YOUR FRONT DOOR OR LIKE TO HAVE EVERYTHING ON ONE THING
WE WANT IT TO BE MUNT MULTIFUNCTIONAL BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU GET IT TO DO TOO MUCH YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TELL THEM APART
KEEPING IT NICE AND SLICK WOULD BE IMPORTANT
JUST SOMETHING LIKE KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE START ACTUALLY DEALING WITH THIS STUFF BUT THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL
FI B LIKE WHAT ARE THEY CALLED THOSE FACE PLATE THINGS
OR IF YOU OUR USERS IN MIND LIKE THESE GRANDMAS ARE NOT GONNA BE INTO THIS WHOLE NEW LET'S DESIGN
NO IT'S THEY'RE USED TO THE BUTTONS SO WE'LL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF EXACTLY WHO WE'RE MARKETING THIS TO
SO JUST TO KICK OFF THE MEETING BASICALLY UM SO WE'RE WORKING NOW FOR A REAL REACTION THIS IS UH SO IT RIGHT
ESSENTIALLY THAT MEANS GETTING USED TO THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAVEN'T TRIED OUT YET THE WHITEBOARD
I WANT TO I'M JUST GONNA YOU GOT OF COURSE YOU CAN DISCUSS THAT
UM SO UM IF YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT MARKETING RIGHT SORTED UM Y IS
UM I MEAN OBVI IF IF YOU GUYS IF IF AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU LIKE LOGICALLY IF SOMETHING DOESN'T LIKE IF I'M LIKE WE'RE GONNA SELL A REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S THE SIZE OF THIS PAPER BOOK YOU KNOW
I'M NOT GONNA ASK DO YOU KNOW THAT OR UH YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE YEAH YEAH EXACTLY SO
'CAUSE WE'RE WHAT WE'RE SORT OF ROLE PLAYING IS Y G YEAH YOU'RE GONNA TAP INTO YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE AS WELL UM
YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU WENT TO UM
UH YOU KNOW MAYBE I YOU'RE LIKE IN MAINE YOU WENT TO U. C. S. B. BUT YOU WANNA SAY YOU WENT TO HARVARD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO I GUESS THAT THAT WE'RE TOTALLY WE'RE MAKING A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS THRILLING UM UH BUT THE IDEA IS THAT WE CAN MAKE SOMETHING BASED ON THE WHOLE CORPORATE MODEL I DUNNO IF YOU GUYS HAD TIME TO CHECK THE IN REAL LIFE I DUNNO IF YOU GUYS UH CHECKED THE UM UH THE CORPORATE WEBSITE
UM WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SOMETHING AS FASHIONABLE AS POSSIBLE
THAT'S KIND OF THE CORPORATE STRATEGY IS WE'RE GONNA TRY TO TAKE ORDINARY STUFF THAT NOBODY REALLY THINKS ABOUT AND TRY TO MAKE IT NICE YOU KNOW LIKE JOHN LEWIS NICE OR YOU KNOW IF YOU GO TO DEBENHAM'S OR SOMETHING
SO UM BASICALLY WE ARE REINVENTING THE WHEEL BUT WE WANNA TRY TO DO IT IN A USER FRIENDLY UM SLICK SLEEK KIND OF WAY
UM WAY WE'RE GONNA GO ABOUT DOING THAT IS BASICALLY AT FIRST WE'RE GONNA START ON THE BASICS
TO GUIDE ME AND GUIDE US ON THIS PROJECT 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE YOU'RE G YOU GUYS ARE THE BOTTOM YOU KNOW YOU'RE LIKE NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE YOU KNOW X. AND Y. UM AT THE SAME TIME
YOU KNOW LIKE UM I I THINK YOU GUYS PROBABLY GOT THE SAME EMAILS I DID BUT THE IDEA OF UM
UM AND SO WE'LL WORK UP FROM THERE AND UM THEN WE'LL MEET ON AND TALK ABOUT IT AND THEN FINALLY WE'LL INCORPORATE AS KIND OF THE LAST STAGE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU GUYS BUILD OR TELL ME TELL US WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND THEN YOU TELL US WHAT WE CAN UM HOPE FOR AND WHAT WAY TO GO TAKE THE THE THE
TAKE THE BASICS AND MAKE IT NICER AND THEN OV OBVIOUSLY UH THE U. I. D. AND THE I. D. YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN KEEP ON THE YOU KNOW SORT OF AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF HOW TO GET ABOUT MAXIMISING WHAT IS POSSIBLE
UM TO TRY T OF SYNC IT ALL UP
UM RIGHT SO FOR NOW JUST FOR TH THE WHITE BOARD UM
OH WE SKIPPED INTRODUCTIONS
I'M MARTY UM I WENT TO UNI AT UH U. C. SANTA BARBARA AND I'M HERE WORKING ON A P. H. D. IN PSYCHOLOGY
WELL I'LL T I NO NO YEAH I'M JUST GONNA WRITE A COUPLE OF 'EM DOWN
SEE I'M A BIG MUSIC FAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE I'M ASSUMING EVERYBODY LIKES MUSIC TO SOME LESSER OR GREATER EXTENT BUT
THERE'S SOME OTHER OPTIONS IF YOU'RE A T. V. SLUT LIKE I AM LIKE SMALLVILLE TERRIBLE TELEVISION SHOW BUT I HAPPEN TO LOVE IT
T THE THE MAIN C THE MAIN CHARACTER
IS HE A WANKER
HE LOOKS REALLY TALL LIKE HE'S GOTTA BE LIKE SIX SIX
UM AND UM OH WELL I MIGHT AS WELL THROW A BRITISH PERSON IN THERE UM YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH RADIOHEAD
RIGHT ON
W
ISN'T H HAS H DO YOU WATCH THE NEW SEASON
THAT'S WHAT A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION IS FOR
I IT'S TH BRILLIANT
AH YES YES YES OKAY I SEE THAT
UH
OH HAVE YOU BEEN HOME YET
RIGHT YOU S YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE
YEAH OH MAN
GOING TO S LIKE NORTH CAROL I'M SORRY YOU YOU JUST CAN'T GET A BETTER BURRITO THAN WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE S IN SAN DIEGO
WELL IT'S IT'S I THERE'S OTHER THINGS TOO THERE'S YOU JUST CAN'T PLACE IT LIKE I WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL IN THE U. IN SANTA BARBARA WHICH IS CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
THE MEXICAN FOOD IS OKAY IT'S JUST NOT GOOD LIKE AND YEAH IT'S LIKE TWO BUCKS
UM JUST LITERALLY JUST METROPOLITAN SAN DIEGO I LIVE LIKE FIVE MINUTES FROM THE ZOO
ON UNIVERSITY YEAH
YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE LITERALLY HALF A MILE FROM MY HOUSE
SMALL WORLD AS WE WERE DISCUSSING BEFORE
UM RIGHT SO MOVING ON TO NOT FUN STUFF UH PROJECT FINANCE
THIS IS WHAT THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT HAS TOLD ME THE C. F. O. BUT I DON'T KNOW
I'M NOT SOLD ON THIS IT'S PRETTY DEAR I MEAN TWENTY F THAT'S LIKE YOU KNOW
UM SO WHAT WE CAN MAYBE WORK ON THAT A LATER BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE A LOT ON IT THE PROFIT AIMS TO MAKE FIFTY MILLION EUROS ON IT
SO UM ONE OF THE THINGS I I WAS GONNA MENTION TO YOU UM YOU GUYS THE DESIGNERS IS THAT UM IT M WE PROBABLY NEED A REVER IT NEEDS TO BE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL PROBABLY
UM SO SOMETHING THAT COULD DO N. T. S. C. AS WELL AS PAL AS WELL AS VARIOUS OTHER FORMATS LIKE IF IT'S GONNA CONTROL D. V. D. S BUT UM YOU KNOW I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU GUYS BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I I IT IS GONNA BE AN INTERNATIONAL SOLD THING
UM S RIGHT SO UM JUST TO CLOSE UP I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH TIME I'VE USED MM NEXT TIME RIGHT PROJECT MANAGER SORTED
IS UH WE'LL MEET IN ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR OR SO UM AND I'D LIKE THE UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TO GET GE THINK ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
UM MM BASIC AND UM SO I NEED YOU TO TELL US WHAT UM WE WHAT THE USER'S GONNA WANT
AND AS MORE THINGS COME UP WE'LL HAVE MEETINGS AND YOU'LL GET EMAILS AND SO FORTH
YOU MEAN TO LIKE
NO I MEAN NO GOOD IDEA GOOD IDEA
WE'LL SEE WHAT SEE WHAT
THAT'S TRUE I GUESS WE WE PROBABLY HAVE SOME TIME MAYBE WE SHOULD BRAINSTORM A BIT LIKE WHAT WE WANNA DO GO BACK TO UM
NOT SO MUCH
ALL RIGHT WE'LL FIND THEM WE'RE ON OUR OWN
YEAH I MEAN OH YEAH RIGHT
I'M ALSO GONNA NOTE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE THIS IDEA OF UM SO YOU LIKE MAYBE LIKE AN L. LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN TYPE OF REMOTE
I LI I'M LIKING THAT IDEA THIS IDEA OF A TOUCH SCREEN REMOTE WITH MULTI FORMAT FEATURES
KINDA LIKE HOW ON A LOT OF UM UH CORDLESS REGULAR PHONES YOU HAVE A PAGE BUTTON AND IT GOES COULD WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE DO HAVE THE MINIMUM AM AMOUNT I MEAN WE WERE TALKING FINANCES I DUNNO SELLING A A FORTY POUND REMOTE WOULD H OR A FORTY DOLLAR REMOTE
THEY SERVE UM RIGHT THEY SA THA S THEY WILL SELL THINGS OVERSEAS SO YOU CAN BUY STUFF IN AMERICA AND HAVE IT SHIPPED OVER FOR LIKE TWENTY THIRTY POUNDS ABOUT
RIGHT SO UM LET'S GO AHEAD AND WRAP THAT UP HERE FOR NOW I'M GONNA PUT THESE INITIAL IDEAS THAT WE'VE GOT IN THE UM PROJECT DOCUMENTS
SO IF YOU GUYS WA NEED A REMINDER ABOUT WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT UM THE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW KIND OF TRADE OFFS THAT WE'VE GOT AND THE OTHER IDEAS
YOU CAN CONSULT THEM AT YOUR LEISURE
LET'S JUST UH HEAD BACK TO WORK ON WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEF UH GOI H H GETTING INTO
GUESS I SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO SIT UP STRAIGHT
OH I THINK MINE'S FALLEN OFF
U. C. L. A.
YEAH MY GRANDPARENTS LIVED ON UM THIRTY SECOND
CLOSE T UH DO YOU KNOW WHERE CLARE DE LUNE COFFEE SHOP IS AND
BECAUSE SO MANY OF THOSE REMOTES THAT YOU SEE THESE UNIVERSAL REMOTES LOOK SO CHEAP AND LOW QUALITY
MAYBE A SIMPLE BUTTON THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR TELEVISION TO HELP YOU FIND YOUR REMOTE
IT FELL
THINK I'M JUST GONNA PUT DOWN ONE UH ONE C. D.
S DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY INITIAL IDEAS
BUT I'M THINKING I'M THINKING KIND OF P. D. A. UH DESIGN SO TOUCH SCREEN DESIGN RATHER THAN BUTTON SO THAT YOU CAN KIND OF FLIP AROUND ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
TOO CONFUSING
I MEAN I I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS A P. D. A. THAT HE JUST POINTS AT HIS TELEV ANY TELEVISION HE WANTS AND IT'LL FIGURE OUT THE THE SPECIFICATIONS OF IT AND WILL CONTROL IT UM SO I TH I ASSUME THAT THAT CAN BE DONE WITH UH KIND OF AROUND THE WORLD
IN IN
WELL IF WE BUNDLE IT AS A PHONE THEN YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL IT
IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT THEN WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING THAT JUST KIND OF RINGS FROM EITHER WELL THERE USED TO BE THOSE WHISTLING DEVICES BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ANNOYING
TH
GOTTA PLUG YOU IN
OH THAT WOULD BE PERFECT
UH
SO THIS IS ME
UM BASICALLY I WAS LOOKING THROUGH SOME MARKETING REPORTS THAT WE'VE GOT AND WE HAD A USABILITY TEST WHERE WE WERE ACTUALLY SORT LIKE WATCHING A HUNDRED PEOPLE USE T. V. REMOTES AND SEE WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE USING AND THEN THEY FILLED OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY DON'T ABOUT THEIR GENERAL T. V. REMOTE CONTROL PRACTICES
M THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME THAT'S ALL THAT'S GOING ON THE OTHER FUNCTIONS HAPPEN
THEY'RE NOT USING A LOT OF IT THEY DON'T NEED IT
THEY EVEN FIND IT FRUSTRATING WHEN THERE ARE ALL THOSE BUTTONS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
AND UM WE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT UH FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR PEOPLE THEIR THE WORST THING ABOUT A REMOTE IS HOW OFTEN THEY LOSE IT
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE READY TO LOOK INTO TECHNICALLY THAT'S UP TO THE DESIGN PEOPLE BUT IT IS S SOMETHING WORTH THINKING ABOUT
UM BUT BASICALLY IT REALLY IS THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS AND GETTING IT TO LOOK NICE WHICH ARE
NEED TO UNPLUG THIS
NEED IT BACK
UH
IS THAT ONLY GONNA BE WITHIN OUR TWO HUNDRED FOOT RANGE THEN
K
THE UH IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS TOUCH PAD SCREEN THING IT WOULD BE STILL DO WE KNOW IF THAT'S AN OPTION TECHNICALLY RIGHT NOW TO THAT
'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE AN INTERESTING OPTION ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEN YOU COULD HAVE LIKE YOUR PRIMARY SCREEN JUST BE THESE YOU KNOW FOUR OR FIVE BASIC FUNCTIONS
THINGS THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE EVERY DAY AND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA USE BUT IT IS AN OPTION THERE FOR THIS HI TECH MARKET THAT SORT OF RE IS THE SLEEK THING WE'RE GOING FOR
WELL IN THE PUBLICITY OF A FACE PLATE ON A PHONE IS YOU HAVE IT OUT AND AROUND
IT IS SORT OF EMBLEMATIC WHEREAS YOU'RE JUST SIT AT HOME SO UNLESS SOMEBODY COMES OVER TO WATCH T. V.
AND OH
WELL BUT IF WE'RE GONNA USE A TOUCH SCREEN WHERE IT'S GONNA COME ON LIKE ON YOUR CELL PHONE IT'LL HAVE YOUR YOUR CARRIER PROVIDER NAME COME UP FIRST LIKE WHILE IT'S LOADING AND THEN IT GOES AWAY
COMES ON EVERY TIME YOU TURN IT ON AND THEN THAT'S IT 'CAUSE IT IS A BIT MUCH TO HAVE IT LIKE ENGRAVED ON THE BACK OR SOMETHING I THINK
Y
SO BASICALLY UH WHAT I'VE JUST FOUND OUT FROM THE BOARD I DUNNO IF YOU GUYS GOT THIS EMAIL AS WELL BUT IT NEEDS TO BE TELEVISION ONLY
MIGHT HAVE TO HIT FUNCTION F. EIGHT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA COME UP
IS IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN USE UM MODERN TYPES OF POLYMERS
OR MO MODERN TYPES OF PLASTICS THAT MAYBE DO HAVE SOME KIND OF AESTHETIC VALUE UM LIKE IF A WHITE LIKE IF WE TALK ABOUT LIKE WELL LIKE ON THE LAPT ON THESE LAPTOPS AND OTHER ONES THEY USE A A PRETTY NICE
YOU CAN DO I IS THERE SOME KIND OF NICE COLO DER QUALITY PLASTIC THAT WE CAN WORK WITH
S PLUG YOURSELF IN HERE
YEAH SORRY I COULDN'T GET THAT G TO USE BEFORE
RIGHT SO I THINK WE'VE COVERED MOST OF THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THROUGH THIS UM THROUGH YOU GUYS'S PRESENTATIONS UM WE'VE GOT UH Y THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SUGGESTS UH OR PRETTY MUCH EMPHATICALLY SUGGESTED THAT WE NEED TO GO WITH PLASTIC
UM SARAH SHE'S RECOMMENDED THAT WE GO FOR SIMPLER FUNCTIONS SO FEWER FUNCTIONS UM BUT WE NEED TO DECIDE WHO ARE WE SELLING THIS TO
YOU S YOUR STATS SUGGESTED THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE UNDER THIRTY FIVE WANTED THOUGHT ABOUT VOICE CONTROL
AND MY THOUGHT IS UM WE'VE GOT W IF WE'RE GONNA GO FOR A SLEEK LOOK I MEAN WE ARE PUTTING THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS UM
UH WE NEED TO WONDER AH H ABOUT HOW WE MAKE IT BETTER AND SMALLER AND FASTER UM THINK WE'RE CONSTRAINED TO PLASTICS VERY WELL WE'VE GOT THIS IDEA
HOW TH THIS VOICE OPERATION THING IS I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA UM ASSUMING THAT IT'S DOABLE
OKAY YOU CAN'T SAY RECORD ALIAS TONIGHT AT SEVEN P. M. BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY UM VOLUME UP
IF IT'S HIDDEN UNDER THE COUCH BUT THEN AGAIN YOU HAVE THIS WEE THIS WEE THING YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A LITTLE CHIP OR WHATEVER THAT HAS THE PAGE BUTTON
MM 'KAY UM SO I'M SEEING THAT WE'RE GONNA JUST BASICALLY FOCUS ON THIS YOUNG DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP AIM IT AT THEM
WE'D MORE OR LESS BE CORNERING THE MARKET ON IT AS WELL WE DON'T HAVE MANY UM
RIGHT UM WE DON'T HAVE MANY PEOPLE OR THERE'S NOT VERY MANY COMPETITORS OUT THERE THAT DO THAT SO COOL
YEAH 'CAUSE THEN HA YOU WOULD HAVE TO WHO ALL IT'S NOT LIKE WITH CELL PHONES LIKE WHERE YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW NOKIA MODEL X. AND THEN TEN PEOPLE MAKE FACE PLATES FOR IT
WE'D BE JUST OUR MODEL OF PHO OF T REMOTE CONTROL
ALRIGHT WELL WE CAN WE CAN DISCUSS THAT ONE FURTHER WHEN WE THINK ABOUT UM WHETHER TH WHEN WE DO COSTS AND SO FORTH UM
IF PLASTIC IS DEAD CHEAP AND IF WE'RE MAKING THE WHOLE THING OUT OF PLASTIC ANYWAY UM YEAH WE'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE LATER UM BUT YEAH WE WILL HAVE TO EVALUATE WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
UM I THINK WE'VE HAD A BIT OF DISCUSSION ALREADY ON THIS THING N S THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THAT CAME UP IN THESE PRESENTATIONS
LET'S BASED ON WHAT SH ON WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE ALL SAID TO ME LET'S GO FOR A PLASTIC
BUILT OR UH B PLASTIC CASED 'CAUSE THA THA THAT'S EASY ON THE COST
AND WE'LL YEAH THA LET'S PROVISIONALLY LET'S GO FOR A TOUCH SCREEN ONE WITH SEVERAL SUBMENUS UM FOR POSSIBLE EXTRA STUFF THAT ONE BASICALLY PUT THE CHANNEL AND THE ON AND OFF SWITCH ON THE TOUCH SCREEN
WELL I I DON'T THINK YEAH I CAN'T SEE ANYBODY BUYING A LAP A REMOTE CONTROL THAT THEY HAVE TO PLUG IN SO WE'D HAVE TO SEE SOME KIND OF NEW BATTERY TECHNOLOGY
YOU KNOW PEOPLE KNOW THE CHANNEL AND VOLUME FUNCTION MAKE THEM LARGE AND EASY TO GET AT AND THEN THE THE OTHER THE OTHER BITS AND BOBS YOU KNOW GO THROUGH MENU UM W WE'LL DO THE AESTHETICS
UM IT'S TH UH WITH THIS VOICE RECOGNITION OPTION AS WELL UM JUST AS FOR THE SIMPLE FUNCTIONS THE UM THE ON OFF CHANNELS VOLUME UM
YEAH I THINK PERHAPS GOOD IDEA BUT YEAH I THINK THAT THAT ONE M MIGHT JUST BE UM
YEAH I KNOW I D IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD SUFFICE TO HAVE JUST THE R. R. ON THERE
UM AND YEAH THAT WOULD HELP THE BATTERY LIFE TOO AND IF IT THE REMOTE THEY DO HAVE TO PRESS A BUTTON FOR THE REMOTE TO TURN ON
OH TO WAKE UP OKAY OR GO INTO LIKE A DORMANT MODE
OH YEAH I LIKE THAT I LIKE THE IDEA OF UM PUTTING THE LOGO IN THE BOOT UP SCREEN NICE
UM COOL SO ANY LAST THINGS BEFORE WE BREAK
I'M GONNA SAVE TH A COPY OF THIS IN CASE YOU GUYS NEED ANY REMINDERS
SO DO I UNPLUG THIS BIT HERE
UM I JUST DID A PRELIMINARY STUDY HERE AND UH I FOUND THAT TOO MUCH METAL IN REMOTE DESIGN COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE INTERFERENCE WITH THE ABILITY OF THE REMOTE TO SEND COMMANDS
UM TOO MUCH METAL IS USED SOMETIMES AND PEOPLE PICK UP RADIO SIGNALS AND THE LIKE
AND THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF THE REMOTE CATCHING ON FIRE AND INJURING THE CUSTOMER JUST THINK OF THOSE LAWSUITS THAT'D BE REALLY BAD
THE COMPANY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD THIS KINDS OF LAWSUITS WHICH ADM ADMITTEDLY IS GONNA COME AT THE COST OF A CERTAIN AESTHETIC VALUE 'CAUSE WE WERE THINKING
UM FOR EXAMPLE THE PLASTIC THEY HAVE ON YOUR LAPTOP THERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO
IS IT PLUGGED IN WELL
OH GO AHEAD
ARE WE STILL GONNA BE ABLE TO MEET OUT TWELVE POU OUR TWELVE FIFTY EURO YOU KNOW GOAL FOR SELLING THESE THINGS
SEE IF THERE IF THERE'S EVEN INTEREST OUT THERE
CAN WE AFFORD TO INCLUDE ONE OF THOSE
OR IS IT JUST GONNA BE ONE TOUCH SCREEN FOR EVERYBODY
WHAT WHAT WOULD BE ON THAT TOUCH SCREEN
THEY JUST WANT IT TO BE ON AND READY TO GO
TH
UM SO A FEW OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE NEED HERE
UM BASICALLY WANNA SEND MESSAGES UH TO A TELEVISION SET
UM NOW SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS I FOUND IS A A COMPLICATED REMOTE CONTROL SORRY THAT WE CAN'T QUITE SEE MY RED THERE VERY WELL BUT UH THIS REMOTE CONTROL HAS MANY FUNCTIONS UM SO IT CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS BUT IT UH IT IS QUITE COMPLICATED AND MOST USERS WILL FIND IT UH FIND THAT THEY WON'T USE MOST OF THE FUNCTIONS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THEM AND DON'T WANNA TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT
AS YOU ALSO NOTICE IT'S QUITE A BORING DESIGN
ANOTHER REMOTE CONTROL SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IT'S A SIMPLER REMOTE CONTROL UH MANY LESS BUTTONS BUT UH HAS MANY FEWER FUNCTIONS
UM M MUCH EASIER FOR THE USER TO MANIPULATE AND USE
UM SO ATTAIN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF A COMPLICATED DEVICE BUT USE A SIMPLE FORMATTED DISPLAY UH FOR THE USER TO TO WORK WITH
I CAN PLUG YOU IN
AND YOU JUST SAY SOMETHING TO INTO THAT AND IT
THE OTHER THING IS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE SIMPLICITY OF A REMOTE CONTROL AND KIND OF PUT THE MORE COMPLICATED THINGS INTO A VOICE CONTROL
WELL HOPEFULLY SOME PEOPLE HAVE PEOPLE COMING T OVER TO W TO HANG OUT AT YOUR HOUSE AND MOST PEOPLE HAVE THEIR TELEVISIONS IN THE LIVING ROOM
UH
SO THESE NEW LITHIUM BATTERIES THEY LAST TWENTY YEARS EVEN WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN
THOSE NEW ONES
UH I I'M I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT I'M WONDERING HOW WE'RE GONNA GET UH WE PUT FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS ONTO THIS DEVICE
I'M HOPING FOR A SUBLIMINAL MAYBE HALF A MILLISECOND AS IT TURNS ON
UH BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S I'VE GOT SOME RESEARCH ALREADY ON LIKE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND TRENDS IN CASING RIGHT NOW WHICH ACTUALLY MIGHT EVEN COME INTO PLAY BEFOREHAND
UM BASICALLY I WAS LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET RIGHT NOW AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN OTHER DESIGN FIELDS
TO SEE SORT OF WHAT'S WHAT'S TRENDY WHAT'S NEW WHAT'S HAPPENING
UM THE CHALLENGE IS THAT CURRENT TRENDS RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE BOARD IN FASHION IN FURNITURE
BUT I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE MAYBE TO USE UM NATURAL COLOURS LIKE IF WOOD IS AN OPTION THAT WHOLE ORGANIC SLEEK CLEAN
A DIFFERENT SHAPE OR OKAY NOT THE EXAMPLE I WOULD CHOOSE
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN TO T SORT OF AND TH APPARENTLY THE FEEL OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IS SPONGY
UH NOT SOMETHING I I'VE COME UP WITH A THOUGH IF WE CAN GET AROUND TO GETTING PILOTING I THOUGHT MAYBE A CASING OPTION LIKE UH
TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE AND THIS FANCY NEW I THINK PERHAPS THE DOUBLE CURVE THING AND MAYBE THIS RUBBER OPTION IS OUR BEST WAY TO GO FOR RIGHT NOW
WELL I D BUT THEN IF THE TOUCH SCREEN THING ISN'T GONNA WORK OUT FOR US THAT'S REALLY A NON ISSUE
AH IT COULD BE IT COULD BE UM
I THINK IT'S OUR MOST MARKETABLE FEATURE JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO NEW AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS SHOWING UP IN OTHER PLACES
THOUGH I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY FOR I MEAN IF YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR AN EXPENSIVE HIGH CLASS REMOTE YOU'RE GONNA EXPECT IT TO DO SOMETHING
SEE IF WE CAN CUT SOME CORNERS
BUT DEFINITELY WE KNOW THE MARKET IS THERE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION SO TO SAY WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND WE'RE NOT GONNA USE IT EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW IT'LL SELL
LIKE REALLY I CAN'T GO IN AND SAY NO WE'RE GONNA JUST IGNORE EVERYTHING WE KNOW
AND WE'RE STILL NOT THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS BATTERY ISSUE NEARLY AS MUCH EITHER WE CAN STICK WITH WHAT WE'VE ALREADY GOT
IN A LOT OTHER WAYS TOO
I THINK IT'S OUR LOWER RISK OPTION WHICH FOR RIGHT NOW WE CAN HAVE IT ON THE MARKET SOONER WHICH IS ALL IN ALL OUR BEST OPTION
WELL WHAT OF PEOPLE WITH LIKE THE T. V. IN THEIR BASEMENT LIKE WHAT IF WHA WE CAN'T GUARANTEE SUNLIGHT EVERYWHERE SO HAVING A SECONDARY SOURCE IS PROBABLY
UH
TRUE AND I PROBABL I THINK WE'RE BANKING ON SELLING IT TO MORE THAN JUST VOICE RECOGNITION PEOPLE
LIKE WE WANT IT TO WORK FUNDAMENTALLY AS A BASIC MANUAL TOO RIGHT
WITH THE BU YEAH
YEAH WHICH IS THE NEXT BIG THING SO THAT'S NOT GONNA HURT US EITHER
WELL WHEN THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE ONLY USING THE MOST PRIMARY FUNCTIONS ON A DAILY BASIS
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULD COMPLETELY RULE OUT MAJOR FUNCTIONS THEY SHOULD BE SECONDARY AT LEAST IF NOT FUNCTIONALLY THEN VISUALLY LIKE THOSE SHOULDN'T BE
WELL AND DO WE WANNA CONSIDER LIKE AN IPOD SCREEN WHICH ISN'T A TOUCH SCREEN BUT YOU'RE STILL SCROLLING THROUGH MENU OPTIONS IN P
TRUE WE'RE STILL NOT MAKING IT EASIER THEN
ARE REALLY VERSATILE AND EVERYBODY'S ALREADY GOT THEM TO SOME EXTENT ON THE REMOTES THEY ALREADY OWN SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE DEALING WITH EVERYBODY RELEARNING THINGS 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING ANYBODY'S GONNA WANNA BUY A NEW FOR
UH
OH IT WASN'T IN THE WAY BUT YEAH WHATEVER
DON'T ASK ME S PRECISELY WHAT CONCEPTUAL DESIGN IS IT'S JUST SOMETHING IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED TO DO
UM THINK OF IT 'S KIND OF UH TURNING THE ABSTRACT INTO SLIGHTLY MORE CONCRETE
IN THIS MEETING IDEALLY WE'LL COME TO SOME FINAL DECISIONS ON WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FOR THE PROTOTYPE
UM SO I WILL ATTEMPT TO DO SO MORE ACCURATELY IN THIS PARTICULAR MEETING
UH WHOEVER WANTS TO GO FIRST IS F FINE BY ME UM AND WE'LL COLLATE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT UM WHAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE LAST MEETING POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS
AND THEN WE'LL MAKE SOME MORE DECISIONS ON UM BASIC UH FIRM UP OUR IDEA ON HOW WE WANT THIS REMOTE CONTROL TO LOOK AND WORK
SO WITHOUT TH FURTHER ADO WHOEVER WANTS TO GO FIRST IS FREE TO
WHAT KIND OF TH THICKNESS ARE WE LOOKING AT
M MAYBE IS THERE AN OPTION THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT OFF OR ON SO A PERSON CAN SELECT LIKE
INTERFACE OH THE INTERFACE GRAPHICS FOR THE UM
LOT OF SINGLE PEOPLE ON THE UM ON THE RE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL RESEARCH TEAM AT THE
THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED IT'S LIKE A LITTLE DONGLE IT JUST STICKS UP THIS FURTHER SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND UP EVERY TIME
JUST CONNECT IT MY KINGDOM
THERE IS IT'S JUST IT IS A QUESTION OF AND HOW MUCH CA O DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO INCREASE THE PRICE TO MAKE MONEY
AND THAT'S TO BE FAIR THE UM THE PER CENT OF THE MARKET WE'RE NOT GOING FOR MASS ANY YOU KNOW
NO WE COULD HAVE A S VERY SIMPLE TOUCH SCREEN YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS THE OPPORTUNITY
IF IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE IPOD OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW W WE YEAH I GUESS WE CAN PLAY AROUND WITH IT A BIT
WHAT DO YOU THINK ON IT NATHAN
ABOUT THE VOICE REC
I CAN'T SEE HOW IT WOULDN'T I MEAN THERE'S YOU KNOW THE OLD APHORISM YOU CAN HAVE IT FAST
YOU CAN HAVE IT CHEAP OR YOU CAN HAVE IT QUALITY PICK TWO OF THREE
OTHERWISE YEAH WE JUST IT JUST BECOMES COST PROHIBITIVE
WHAT WHICH WHICH DO WE SUSPECT WE SHOULD HOLD O WE SHOULD HOLD ON TO
IS IT CHEAPER TO DO THE V. R. OR TO DO THE UH TOUCH SCREEN
WE WILL OMIT THE TOUCH SCREEN IN FAVOUR OF VOICE RECOGNITION
YEAH WELL WE'LL WE'LL SIC WE'LL SORT OUT WHAT IT WHAT F WHAT ELSE WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT FOR THE PROTOTYPE BUT YEAH THAT'S OUR NEXT STEP
WELL WE HAVE TO HAVE BUTTONS ON IT TOO AS WELL
APPLE MAKES THESE REALLY PRETENTIOUS SPEAKERS WITH THE TH SUB WOOFERS YOU KNOW LIKE CLEAR AND GLASS AND YOU KNOW AND THEN THEY GOT THESE LITTLE PYRAMIDAL TYPE OF UM SPEAKERS
YOU KNOW UM USE A CHANNEL BUTTON TO SCROLL THROUGH THE MENU D IF THEY WANT TO RECORD PROGRAMMES OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW I MEAN WE CAN SORT THAT OUT
I MEAN A NICE ALTHOUGH WE DO UM WH UH IS I'M RECALLING THAT SHE MENTIONED THAT WE N NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE SURGICAL WHITE KIND OF BRUSHED ALUMINIUM THING AND GET BACK TO IT BUT YOU COULD HAVE A VERY TASTEFUL UM WOOD COLOURED OR EARTH TONE KIND OF UM
YEAH I LIKE THAT I LIKE THAT IDEA A LOT
UM YOU KNOW LI LIK IF YOU FEEL THE THE TIP ON THIS PEN IT'S A BIT GIVES JUST A BIT
BUT TO BE FAIR YEAH I MEAN
YOU JUST C YOU COULD JUST PUT IT LITERALLY PUT IT ON THE THE NI THE COFFEE TABLE NEXT TO THE TELLY AND SAY VOLUME UP
UM SO WE'VE REVISITED THE TOUCH SCREEN AND MORE OR LESS RULED THAT OUT UM
I THINK SO WE'RE MORE OR LESS CON WE WH WH WE'RE MORE OR LESS IN AGREEMENT THAT WE WANT TO HAVE A UM A SIMPLE KIND OF FUNCTION
LIKE MAYBE HAVE MENU THINGS
YEAH WE'VE ALSO GOT THE THE ME THE THING OF IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A NON REMOTE LOOKING REMOTE HOW DO WE YEAH
B BUT NO I MEAN WE COULD DO A SLIDE OR A COMPARTMENT YOU KNOW
A B A B A A SERIES OF YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR BUTTONS WITH A MENU BUTTON AND THEN A SIDE AN S UP AND DOWN TYPE OF THING
LIKE ON UM LIKE ON A D. V. D. PLAYER
YOU KNOW YOU SEE THE MODERN D. V. D. PLAYERS'LL JUST HAVE UM A MENU BUTTON ON THE SIDE AND THEN FOUR BUTTONS AROUND THEM AND YOU CAN JUST KIND OF MANOEUVRE THROUGH THE MENU LIKE THAT
MORE OR LESS COVERED WHAT WE NEED TO COVER I THINK FI AN AN ANY FINAL THOUGHTS BEFORE WE THINK ABOUT DOING THE PROTOT MOVING ON TO THE PROTOTYPE
I WAS JUST GONNA STEP ON TO UM I WASN'T
THAT WOULDN'T BE SO MUCH OF A PROBLEM TO INCORPORATE INTO THE COLOUR OF THE THING
UM GIVEN THESE PARAMETERS THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA SORT OF HAVE THIS KIND OF UH NON REMOTE REMOTE
UM WHAT ARE OUR BROAD CONSTRAINTS BEFORE WE DEVE DESIGN A PROTOTYPE
FIGURE OUT HOW PROBABLY BEST TO LAY OUT THIS IDEA OF THIS SIMPLE DESIGN WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION BUILT IN AND ALSO THIS KIND OF DROP DOWN OR S ON THE SIDE KIND OF MENU OPTIONS SIMPLE
SOMEHOW WORK OUT HOW WE CAN GET THIS ALL S IN THE SAME PLACE
UM AND IF YOU CAN CHECK PRODUCT EVALUATION WITH M SOME PILOTS AND STUFF
UM I NEED YOU GUYS TO WORK TOGETHER ON MAKING A PROTOTYPE UM USING UM PROTOTYPE BUILDING MATERIALS UM
UH
BASICALLY WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS UM COMPONENT DESIGN AND IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT WE MAY BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED AS TO WHAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE OF WHAT OUR MANUFACTURER OFFERS
BUT TO USE THOSE WE'D HAVE TO USE MORE CHIPS UM AND THAT WOULD COST US MORE
AND IF YOU WERE TO RECORD IF YOU WERE TO MAKE A VIDEO RECORDING YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE LIGHT
UH ONE THING THAT I THOUGHT MIGHT BE INTERESTING WAS TO USE PART USE VISIBLE LIGHT COMING OUT OF THE REMOTE JUST KIND OF AS A FUN GIMMICK
SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE SOMETHING COMING OUT OF THE REMOTE WHEN YOU PUSHED IT
UM AND MY QUESTION TO ALL OF YOU IS SHOULD WE LOOK TO OTHER MANUFACTURIES OR SHOULD WE JUST MAKE DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE
SAY OUR THE ONE IF WE JUST GO WITH ONE AND IT DOESN'T GO OVER WELL THEN WE'RE IN A BAD SITUATION
AS FAR AS THE RUBBER THAT WE CAN USE WE CAN USE A RUBBER AS PART OF THE CASE IT HAS A CONSISTENCY OF THOSE STRESS BALLS
'CAUSE SO MANY YOU GO TO SO MANY HOUSES THESE DAYS AND YOU SEE BROKEN REMOTE CONTROLS
TAPED WITH DUCK TAPE AND WHAT HAVE YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM IF YOU USED RUBBER
IT'S FUN
I THINK IF WE WE DO BOTH THE OBVIOUSLY PRODUCTION COSTS ARE GOING TO GO WAY UP UM BUT IT DOES PUT IT INTO IT'D BECOME THE ROLLS ROYCE OF REMOTE CONTROLS BASICALLY
SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY IN HOUSE FOR THE VOICE RECOGNITION WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO DO AS MUCH DESIGN WORK AND SOMETIMES THE DESIGN WORK IS WHAT PUSH THE COSTS UP
ARE WE GOING TO TALK NOW ABOUT UM THE MATERIALS THAT WE'RE GONNA USE FOR THE CASE AND ALL THOSE THINGS
'CAUSE SOMETIMES SOLAR POWER FAILS AND THERE'S NO WAY ROUND THAT WE SHOULD INSTALL A SMALL BACKUP BATTERY
YEAH IT WORKS ABOUT THE SAME AS A SOLAR POWERED CALCULATOR AND YOU KNOW HOW THOSE THOSE DON'T REALLY REQUIRE THAT MUCH LIGHT
WHAT'S THE UH IDEA
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE THAT ARE PEOPLE THAT BUY A REMOTE ARE THEY ALWAYS GONNA WANNA USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION OR IS IT JUST SOMETHING THAT THEY DO SOMETIMES
I THINK I THINK YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE NEED TO ESCAPE THE TRADITIONAL SHAPE OF A REMOTE
MAYBE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS NICE ON A TABLE IS WOULD BE GOOD EVEN THOUGH AND HAND HELD THE SAME TIME
YEAH THOSE ARE NICE
IF WE'RE NOT GOING THE TOUCH SCREEN ROUTE THEN WE CAN UM JUST INCORPORATE MAYBE SOMETHING THAT FOLDS OUT LIKE WHAT YOU OFTEN SEE ON THESE KINDS OF REMOTES IS THE MOST BASIC FUNCTIONS UP HERE AND SOMETHING THAT SLIDES DOWN TO REVEAL THE YOU KNOW MORE COMPLICATED THINGS
OH EXCELLENT YEAH
SO YUR USER INTERFACE GUYS IS BASICALLY ASPECTS OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT WE CAN SEE OR HEAR OR OTHERWISE UH PERCEIVE
HERE'S A D SERIES OF DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE OUT ON THE MARKET TODAY
UH VOICE RECOGNITION WE WE UM ACTUALLY HAVE SOME NEW UH INFORMATION FROM OUR RESEARCH DESIGN TEAM BUT UH I'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT
UM AND BASICALLY YOU RECORD YOUR OWN VERBAL LABELS C AND CONNECT THEM TO THE REMOTE CONTROL
HAS BEEN ABLE TO UH SET UP A SYSTEM IN WHICH UH YOU CAN TEACH THE REMOTE CONTROL VOICE C RECOGNITION SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO UM WITH STANDARD RESPONSES
ON THE REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT
UM ANOTHER CONCEPT IS WHAT UH APPLE HAS COME UP WITH
THE SPINNING WHEEL WITH UH L. C. DISPLAY LIKE ON THE UH IPOD WHICH I AM SURE MOST OF YOU KNOW ABOUT
AND UH SOME SPECIAL COMPONENTS UH IDEAS LIKE UH BLOCKING
UH THE JUMBO UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MISPLACE OR LOSE
AGAIN PROBABLY NOT WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR SO I I MEAN MY IDEAS HERE AND KIND OF WHERE I THINK WE'RE HEADING IS SOMETHING SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN A REGULAR IPOD UH WITH A HARD CLA C UH PLASTIC CASING ALTHOUGH I THINK SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE'VE COME UP WITH ARE DEFINITELY UH VERY GOOD IDEAS
UH CHANGEABLE CASINGS UH OUR DESIGN TEAM WAS POSSIBLY TALKING ABOUT INCLUDING ONE EXTRA FACE PLATE WITH THE PACKAGE TO KIND OF SET THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN CHANGE IT AND YOU CAN TRY CHANGING IT AND KIND OF GET USED TO THINKING ABOUT MAYBE BUYING ANOTHER ONE WHICH CAN ADD VALUE TO OUR UH BOTTOM LINE
AND OF COURSE OUR VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM WHICH I'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ALREADY AND UH THE USE OF RECOGNISABLE COLOURS AND SHAPES TO AID RECOGNITION OF THE FEATURES UM THAT ARE AROUND SO
AND UH PERHAPS EVEN ADDING IN SOME STUPID LITTLE JOKES WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION IDEA LIKE PERH MM FOR INSTANCE MY TOASTIE MAKER THAT I GOT FROM MY BANK
OH YOU GUYS ARE ALWAYS THE DAMPERS ON THESE PROJECTS
MY MY TEAM IN THE UH ON THE THIRD FLOOR SUGGESTED THAT UH
I CAN PASS YOU ON THAT EMAIL FROM MY UH GUY IN UH GUY DOWN THE HALL
WELL MY P IS
IT'S YOU AND ME OUTSIDE A LITTLE HERE
I'M WILLING TO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID
KIND OF A SLEEK LITTLE UH NEAT THING THAT SITS ON YOUR TABLE OR SOMETHING
I THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT WE HAVE TO STICK WITH UH KIND OF UH A LITTLE BIT TRADITIONAL IN TERMS OF THE BUTTONS AND THEN AND THEN MAKE OUR UNIQUE FEATURE OUR CASING AND WHAT NOT AND OUR VOICE COMMAND
OH I TOTALLY
AH
AH
DO WE HAVE UM OTHER FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD SKINS
IN PLAY NOW OR ARE THOSE ONES GONNA BE DEVELOPED LATER ONCE WE SEE HOW THE COUPLE WE HAVE G GO OR
OH I WASN'T EXPECTING A PROTOTYPE I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAD ANY IN MIND YET
IT'S STILL AN OPTION IF WE NEED IT
M COME IN AT SIXTEEN
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T WANNA GET RID OF THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENTAL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE SOLAR CELL IS A BIG PIECE OF THE WAY WE'RE MARKETING THIS AS LIKE A NATURAL
WHICH IT'S YEAH THAT'S WHAT SETTING US INTO THIS YOUNG MARKET I MEAN THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED FROM SO
AND I MEAN YOU KNOW PERHAPS WHEN THE CELL TECHNOLOGY COMES DOWN IN PRICE WE CAN BRING THAT BACK INTO THE GAME BUT IT LOOKS LIKE AT THIS POINT THAT MAY BE OUT OF OUR LEAGUE
THAT WOULD BE ME
UM CORD
BASICALLY I WAS JUST EVALUATING UM FROM WHAT WE KNOW OF HOW OUR PRODUCT'S WORKING RIGHT NOW WITH THE CRITERIA THAT WE SET AT THE BEGINNING OF THESE ARE THE THINGS WE NEEDED TO DO
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE WE FEEL THEY'RE IMPORTANT
IS THE DESIGN WHAT WE WANTED IT TO DO
AND OVERALL IN GENERAL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COMING UP TO PAR
UM THE ONLY THING IS WITH WITH THE PULL OUT PANEL THAT IS CAN IT TAKE SOME ADJUSTING BECAUSE IT'S A NEW SORT OF INTERFACE
UM THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS COMING UP ROUGH BUT THEN ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT IT DOES MAKE A LOT OF SENSE
BUT FOR NOW WHAT WE'VE GOT IS WORKING IN THE RANGE WE NEED IT FOR SO IT'S ALL GOOD
THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM ME
AS IN WITHIN THE TEAM OR
CONSIDERING THE LITTLE AMOUNT OF INPUT WE HAD GOING IN
UM AND THE TECHNOLOGY HAS DEFINITELY BEEN A HELP IT'S REALLY BEEN INTERESTING TO TRY OUT ALL THIS NEW STUFF
AND EVEN THEN WE DID GET A DECENT PRODUCT TURNED OUT ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT EVERYTHING WE WANTED IT TO BE
AND HIGHLY RESOURCEFUL TEAM MATES MIGHT I ADD WHICH IS ALWAYS A PLUS
ALL FOUR OF THOSE LITTLE CONTAINERS
OH WELL
THOUGH I DID FEEL LIKE TH THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION DROPPED OFF SEVERELY OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY
I MEAN MAYBE IT'S JUST ME BUT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY GET ANY INFORMATION FOR THE LAST PRESENTATION AT ALL
NOTHING I DIDN'T EVEN GET AN EMAIL LIKE THAT WAS IT
SO YEAH I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS SLIGHTLY LACKING BUT THEN YOU KNOW FILL IN THE BLANKS ON YOUR OWN LEVEL OF CREATIVITY UPPED
I EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE MOMENTS WHERE IT JUST GOT OUT OF HAND AND I KNEW WE WERE ALL LYING THROUGH OUR TEETH OTHER THAN THAT
USE THE BOARD WELL AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN SIX MONTHS' WORTH OF WORK NOT LIKE THREE HOURS' WORTH OF MEETINGS
I AM THINKING OUTSIDE THE LITTLE SQUARE BOX THOUGH WITH LITERALLY IN LIKE FORM I DON'T
IT'S STILL GOTTA BE TECHNICALLY CAR SHAPED OR IT WON'T FIT ON THE ROAD YOU KNOW
OH HOW LONG WAS OUR MEETING SUPPOSED TO BE
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE WE ALL SORT OF KNEW WHERE WE WERE HEADED WITH IT SO IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT MATTERED ANYMORE
SEE I ONLY GOT BLANK ONES
I WONDERED WHY YOURS ALWAYS LOOKED SO MORE COMPLICATED
I THINK I ADDED A SLIDE ONE TIME
I WANNA KNOW HOW OUR PRODUCT WOULD FARE
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE IT THERE
WE GOT IT TO BE
KIND OF THOUGH IT WAS REALLY TECHNICALLY AN EVALUATION OF THE PRODUCT NOT THE PROJECT IN GENERAL
WHICH I'M NOT SURE IS THE SAME THING AT THE TIME THAT JUST I MADE MORE SENSE BUT I COULD SEE IF THEY WERE REALLY ASKING ABOUT US
BUT IT'S NOT REGULAR I MEAN MY GRANDPARENTS HAD IT IN THE EIGHTIES AND I GOT IT IN NINETY FOUR BUT STILL
MY UM GRAMMY DOES COMPUTER SCIENCE BACK IN THE STATES AND SO THEY HAD UM AN E. D. U. AND GOV NETWORK
I HAVE NO IDEA
SO IS THAT A CLOSE
ALRIGHT IT IS POWERPOINT TIME
I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT THIS WHOLE SECOND BULLET POINT IS ABOUT IN MY THAT MY COACH WAS SENDING TO ME
S SO JUST TO GO UM JUST REAL BRIEFLY TO GO OVER MINUTES FROM LAST MEETING
WAIT FOR IT WAIT FOR IT
UH OR FROM NATHAN AND RON AND FROM SARAH ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO HERE UM AND WHAT
WHAT KIND OF RISK WE'D BE LOOKING AT WITH SOME OF THE VARIOUS APPROACHES WE WERE DISCUSSING AND WE ESSENTIALLY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WE SHOULD DEVELOP A REMOTE WITH UH VOICE RECOGNITION
I. E. THAT HAD A VAGUELY NON REMOTE LIKE SHAPE UM BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO USE IT AS A REMOTE SINCE YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR VOICE
THAT WOULD INCLUDE SOME MOSTLY JUST THE SIMPLE DESIGN FEATURES FOR A TELEVISION OPERATION BUT WITH A SLIDE OR A FOLD OUT BAY FOR MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS FOR USERS
THAT'S SORTED BACK TO THE MAIN
OH WELL DONE YEAH YEAH OH OK
UM WHAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS NOW IS THE FINANCE OF IT UM I GOT ME YOU'VE GOT YOU PROVIDED A NUMBER THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS QUITE NICE
UM IT'S A SPREADSHEET OF THE PARTS AND I'VE JUST TENTATIVELY PUT IN WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE UM
SO WE'LL JUST IF WE CAN JUST ITEMIZE WHAT'S IN HERE WE'VE GOT THIS IT'S A SOLAR CELL THING RIGHT
WITH THE BA OKAY
IT'S A S A SPEAKER AND A SENSOR AT THE SAME TIME ISN'T IT
UM WITH THIS OTHER DROP DOWN SO MAYBE WE'VE GOT TWO PUSH BUTTON INTERFACES DON'T WE
UH
WHAT'S DIFFICULT WE HAVE ALL THESE THINGS INTEGRAL TO THE UM TO THE DESIGN OF IT THAT WE JUST CAN'T BACK OUT OF NOW
UM IF WE WERE GONNA TRY TO UNDO ONE BIT WE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO UNDO MOST OF IT UM
IT'S EITHER OR
'CAUSE WE CAN'T REMOVE THE PUSH BUTTONS 'CAUSE THEY'RE UM AND WE CAN'T GET RID OF THE UH I MEAN REMOVING THE CHANGING THE CASE WOULDN'T BE SO MUCH OF A
AH OF COURSE SORRY
I GOT THIS SLIDE FROM THE COACH AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CONNECTED TO
BUT I TRUST THAT SHE WOULD JUMP IN IF I WAS SO OKAY FAIR ENOUGH
YEAH I THINK YEAH RE I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE REALLY CREATIVE ACTUALLY I MEAN
INCLUDING THE S THE MULTI COLOURED WAVE PATTERN
SHE SAID I I I SHE ACTUALLY MADE A COMMENT OFF BOY YOU'RE GETTING INTO THIS AND I REALLY I THINK IT'S TRUE I DID GET I I FELT LIKE I GOT WAY TOO INTO IT
BE FUN WITH LEGOS TOO LIKE MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL OR SPACESHIP
COURSE I'M I'M CONSCIOUS OF THE IDEA OF THE PROJECT MANAGER ASKING IF YOU GUYS FEEL LIKE THERE'S A TEAM YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE
IT D
I I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A RI I TH
I WANNA SEE THE OUTPUT FILES FROM THESE UM FROM THE DIGITAL PAPER
T I I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT THE DE BRIEFING IS GONNA BE LIKE
I DUNNO I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE NEW IDEAS FOUND I IS ABOUT
UM CH
W I KINDA LIKE TH
FORTY ISH I I I MM WE SHOULD GO ON A BIT YEAH ABOUT THE PROJECT EVAL UM
I DUNNO ABOUT YOU GUYS BUT I FELT LIKE
I DI
UH YEAH I'D SAY SO
WELL THE ID OKAY THE NOTION OF YEAH I MEAN I IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE A CONCEPT OF A MUG'S MATERIAL IT'S JUST IT IS WHAT IT IS
MAYBE I RATHER THAN CONCEPTS I IT SHOULD BE TH THOUGHT OF WE SH I I THOUGHT OF I THOUGHT OF RATHER THAN IN TERMS OF CONCEPTS I THOUGHT OF IT IN TERMS OF UM LIKE
AND THEN THE FINAL WOULD BE LIKE TH THE ACTUAL SPECIFIED PROTOTYPE OR WHATEVER I DUNNO
NO WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT THE COSTS WEREN'T REALLY WITHIN BUDGET BUT WE COULD S YOU KNOW DO IT
'CAUSE WE DI WE HAD A THU THINK ABOUT IT
OR AS MUCH AS SEEMS LIKE MAYBE NOT LIKE THE ARTICLES AND STUFF
I KNOW IMAGINE WE WENT THE FIRST TEN Y FIFTEEN YEARS OF OUR LIVES WITHOUT THE INTERNET
NO WE HAVE BUT I NOT IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S SO UN YOU KNOW UH UBIQUITOUS
'KAY I GUESS WE CAN PROBABLY CALL THAT MEETING TO AN END FOR THE MOST PART
IS THIS ONE OF THOSE MEDIA PLAYER
W OH
WHAT'S TO BE SAID ABOUT IT
UM WE TOOK INTO ACCOUNT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE WENT OVER IN THE LAST MEETING UM
SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO CONSIDER ARE THAT WE DECIDED NOT TO GO FOR THE TOUCH SCREEN WHICH YOU CAN SEE AND OPTED FOR SOME VERY LARGE BUTTONS FOR THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS
D UH WE DECIDED THOSE WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT UH BUTTONS
AS FAR AS THE UH WHOLE VISIBLE LIGHT THING WE DECIDED TO GO WITH THE MULTIPLE COLOURS COMING OUT WHY NOT
UM AND OF COURSE AS YOU CAN SEE AND IF YOU TOUCH IT IT DOES HAVE THAT NICE SQUISHY FEEL
FACT I DUNNO IF YOU NOTICED BUT I WROTE THE UH THE COMPANY'S NAME ON THE TELEPHONE SCREEN I THOUGHT THAT WAS KINDA NICE
THIS COST WELL TO PUT THIS INTO UM PRODUCTION WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT WHAT WAS OUR GOAL
IT WAS TWELVE FIFTY EURO UM AND THIS ACTUALLY CAME IN AT ABOUT ELEVEN NINETY NINE
ONE THING THAT WE DIDN'T DO UM OBVIOUSLY WE HAD A CHOICE WITH THE BUTTONS WHETHER TO USE SCROLL BUTTONS OR STANDARD RUBBER BUTTONS
UM DO YOU WANNA ANSWER THIS ONE OR DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER IT
UM WELL AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS JUST A MOST SUPERFICIAL LAYER AND UM IT'D BE VERY EASY TO PUT ANOTHER LAYER OF SOMETHING ELSE LIKE
IT'S MORE LIKE A PSEUDO FACE PLATE BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH THAT IN THE FACTORY IT COULD WE COULD VERY EASILY PUT A DIFFERENT ONE ON IT
IF WE WANNA GO THE OTHER WAY IT'S JUST A MATTER OF A COUPLE OF ADJUSTMENTS AND WE COULD GO THE FACE PLATE WAY IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
OOH
AND S I GUESS YOU HAVE TO MARK SPECIAL COLOUR AND SPECIAL FORM AS WELL DON'T YOU
'CAUSE IT I IT IS VERY UNCONVENTIONAL I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS UNCONVENTIONAL
I MEAN WE COULD TAKE WE COULD TAKE THE BATTERY OUT OF IT YOU SEE AND IT'D PROBABLY WORK NINETY NINE PER CENT OF THE TIME BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SET UP A CALL CENTRE FOR THAT ONE PER CENT OF THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE CALLING AND SAYING OH LOOK MY REMOTE ISN'T WORKING WHAT AM I GONNA DO
IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA GET BELOW OUR UH GOAL ISN'T IT
AS YOU WRITE YOUR PERSONAL COACH
WHAT IF YOU GET A RESPONSE TWO OR THREE MONTHS FROM NOW
AND TO PROVE THAT WE WEREN'T WASTEFUL WE DIDN'T WASTE A SINGLE BIT OF PLAY DOH WE USED EVERY BIT
MY ONE MY ONE CRITICISM IS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH COLOURS TO WORK WITH WE ONLY HAD FOUR WASN'T ENOUGH
I THINK IT WAS PRETTY CLEVER 'CAUSE WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO GET TOO FAR OFF TRACK BECAUSE THE INFORMATION CAME IN AT THE RIGHT TIME AND KIND OF FILLED IN THE GAPS ENOUGH
WONDER WHY IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE GOT SO MUCH INFORM WHAT WAS IT THAT KEPT US FROM GOING TO THE THE BOARD
YEAH THAT'S IT 'CAUSE THE MICS ARE LOOSE AND EACH TIME YOU GET UP IT'S S A POSSIBILITY OF TRIPPING OVER SOMETHING OR GETTING TANGLED OR
I GUESS WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
NO NONE
YEAH MAYBE A S A CIRCLE WOULD BE ALRIGHT DIFFERENT
ME TOO
I DON'T WE KIND OF DESIGNED IT TO LOOK LITTLE BIT LIKE A FACE
I WANNA SEE A
IT'D BE SO COOL IF WE GET A COPY OF THE RECORDING
I FIND MYSELF HITTING THE SEND AND RECEIVE BUTTON ON THE EMAIL A LOT JUST OUT OF BOREDOM LIKE C COME ON GIMME SOMETHING
HAS IT BEEN FORTY MINUTES OR WHATEVER
IS THAT THE ONLY SONG YOU HAVE
NO IT'S IMPORTANT TO WE TALKED A QUITE A BIT ABOUT UH YOU KNOW THE THE INTERCHANGEABLE UH FACES AND WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS COME UP WITH A BIT OF A NATURAL LOOK HERE UM F WE CALL IT FRUITY IF YOU WILL
OF COURSE THAT'S UH INTERCHANGEABLE AND UH I THINK IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE FOR THE UH FOR THE REGULAR PRODUCT IN THE IN THE IN THE IN THE FIRST PACKAGING TO BE SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE SUBDUED BUT THIS IS KIND OF SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE UM AND AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE TELEVISION THERE UH WE HAVE THE UH VOICE DETECTOR DEVICE UM ON THE TOP THERE
SO THAT THAT WILL WORK QUITE WELL WITH WITH REGARD TO FINDING THIS UH CONTRAPTION
UM AND UH LET'S SEE WELL CLEARLY THERE'S GONNA BE SOME MORE COLOURS AND WHAT NOT AVAILABLE
IT'S ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE TELEVISION UH YOU KNOW IF THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT I IT ACTUALLY IS EDIBLE INSIDE
UM I DUNNO IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR F WHETHER THAT UH WHETHER WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ANY UH OTHER MARKETING AREAS OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE
SO UH SO UH YEAH ON THE BACK HERE YOU ALL NOTICED THIS AREA HERE WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH UH CONSOLE AND UH I THINK IT'S NICELY DESIGNED INTO THE INTO THE OVERALL LOOK
I THINK THAT UH HAS GIVEN A PROVEN UM EASE OF USE AND WHAT NOT
OH I SEE RIGHT UM
WE ALSO CONTINUED ON WITH THE IDEAS THAT F FOLLOWING UH APPLE'S COLOUR SCHEMES WITH THE KIND OF THE UH LIGHT ORANGE AND THE GREEN
THE VOICE RECOGNITION AREA ACTUALLY DOUBLES AS UH AS THE SOLAR CELL AREA
ALTHOUGH IT DOES STILL HAVE A BATTERY SO I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE SELL IS ON THAT
I MEAN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SWAY ME ON THE IDEA THAT WE OUR MAIN SELLING POINT COULD BE ALREADY THIS VOICE RECOGNITION THING I MEAN THAT'S WHAT SETS US APART RIGHT
AND THE REALITY IS YOU KNOW FOR ME FROM AN IDEOLOGICAL STAND POINT I'D LIKE TO STICK WITH THE UH THE SOLAR CELL
BUT I H KIND OF HAVE TO THROW MYSELF IN THE IN THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE MODEL HERE AND UH YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK THAT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO COME TO A COMPROMISE HERE AND MAYBE MOVE AHEAD WITH THE PROJECT
AND THE PAGING FUNCTION WORKS WELL THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR WE WORKED HARD ON THAT ONE
W WE MIGHT HAVE UH WE MIGHT HAVE LOST THAT GRANOLA MARKET AGAIN THAT WE'RE
UM ALSO HAD I NOT BEEN INTRIGUED ABOUT THE PEN I DON'T THINK I WOULDA USED IT AT ALL I DIDN'T WRITE BARELY ANYTHING
UH
I SO I DON'T N I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
WE COULD DO WHATEVER BASICALLY WHAT WE WANTED UNTIL THE BUDGET CAME DOWN ON US UM
WELL I THINK THAT WAS I THINK THAT WAS AN ISSUE I KEPT FINDING WITH REGARD TO WELL NO BUT ALSO YEAH WHEN I WAS REPORTING ABOUT WHAT EACH OF US WAS DOING I WAS OFTEN CONFUSED AS TO WHAT YOU WERE DOING UM AND THEN I ALSO FELT LIKE YOU KNOW A LOT OF OUR DISCUSSION WOULD CENTRE AROUND N SPECIFICALLY WHAT MY TASK WAS BECAUSE THAT WAS KIND OF THE INTERFACE PORTION WHICH WAS WHAT THE WHOLE PROJECT WAS ABOUT UH BUT AND THEN IN THE END I THINK OUR JOBS KIND OF MELDED TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT MORE
WHICH WAS FINE
AN SO IS THAT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE TAKEN ON THAT KIND OF ROLE
I HAD TO ADMIT AS SOON AS W WE STARTED I MEAN AS SOON AS WE GOT THE PLAY DOH
TH YOU KNOW THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF REALLY TRYING TO STICK WITH REALITY WENT OUT THE WINDOW
I MEAN I THINK HAD THE ISSUE BEEN MORE SERIOUS WE PROBABLY WOULDA BRAINSTORMED MORE DURING OUR MEETINGS AS A TEAM
WELL I DUNNO WHAT I WOULDA SHOWN ON THAT BOARD
STANDARD I JUST USED IT 'CAUSE IT'S LITERALLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
SO IS THIS ALL WE NEED TO GET THROUGH
IS IT
OUR LIMITED ABILITY TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX
THINK IT WAS ALSO REALISATION OF YOU BASICALLY JUST COPY AND PASTE WHAT'S GIVEN TO YOU INTO YOUR PRESENTATION WHICH UH WASN'T SO CLEAR TO ME AT THE BEGINNING
OH I ADDED LIKE FIVE SLIDES TOO BUT I
ACTUALLY THAT LOOKED A LOT MORE LIKE A TONGUE FROM PREVIOUS TO UH FR SOME OTHER DESIGN UH MODIFICATIONS
WHAT THE UHS AND THE
DUDE I THINK WE'VE HAD INTERNET FOR LIKE EIGHTEEN YEARS
HI EVERYBODY AND WELCOME TO OUR KICK OFF MEETING UM FOR OUR NEW PRODUCT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DESIGNING
YEAH OR HOW ABOUT I JUST CLICK
UM TOOL TRAINING WE'RE GOING TO I GUESS FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ON THIS PROJECT WITH OUR INDIVIDUAL ROLES
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO INDIVIDUAL WORK ON THAT AND THEN MEET
AND THE WHITEBOARD THING DO YOU GUYS WANNA GIVE THAT A TRY EVEN THOUGH THE INK WASN'T WORKING OR DO YOU WANNA DO IT ON HERE
EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A GOOD DRAWER LIKE ME
OH DO I
'KAY ABOUT ONE MORE MINUTE
UH
BUT IF SHE WAS AROUND MY CAT FOREVER SHE BECAME USED TO IT YOU KNOW IT'S WEIRD
AND I'M LAST
LOOK AT MY SAD SAD GIRAFFE
I DON'T KNOW EVEN MUCH ABOUT GIRAFFES BUT I JUST LOVE THE WAY THEY LOOK
I I LIKE THAT THEY'RE SO UNIQUE AND INDIVIDUAL I GUESS
YEAH BUT YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE WAY THEY LOOK
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS AN INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT MARKETED IN THE STATES IN EUROPE IN ASIA
'KAY AND UM ANOTHER THING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THE D THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT HOW IT FEELS IN YOUR HAND
IF IT'S JUST FLAT AND KIND OF BORING TH THOSE DON'T NOBODY WANTS TO BUY THOSE ANY MORE
ONES THAT ONES THAT LOOK HIGH TECH TOO
DO SOME OF THEM USE TRIPLE A. S THOUGH
BUT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE SIZE OF IT TOO
WELL W AS LONG AS WE KNOW THAT ISSUE IS
BUT IT'S OKAY WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT IT NOW JUST AS LONG AS WE REMEMBER BATTERY TYPE AND SIZE IS IMPORTANT
OH WE'RE CLOSING THE MEETING
MAKING SURE IT DOES EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED THE REMOTE TO DO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT OPERATING ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS
I DRAW LIKE I'M IN GRADE FIVE
I DREW A KITTY
ARE YOU TRYING TO SUGGEST SOMETHING
SO WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE IT HOW TO COVER ALL THE DIFFERENT VARIANCES IN SIGNALS
JUST DO IT ON THE ARROW
NO I KNE I KNEW
AH
UM I DREW A BADGER
UH
BADGERS ARE COOL IN THAT ONE TOO
BUT IT'S STILL THERE SO
BUT AT THE SAME TIME ARE SIMPLE
D
IF WE NEED TO DO TRIPLE A. WE CAN BUT MOST PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE DOUBLE A. S AROUND
YEAH WE COULD ON HERE
YEAH THEY THEY'RE EASY YOU KNOW
OH YEAH THIS SUMMER I OH I HAD TO LIVE WITH CATS
OH LIKE THIS CAME FROM LAS VEGAS
YEAH SOME USE TRIPLE A. S
YEAH IF WE WANT IT TO BE MORE THIN THEN WE'D PROBABLY WANNA GO WITH A TRIPLE A.
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS ONE FROM EACH OF YOU
WHAT ACTUALLY IS IT SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT DO PEOPLE PICK UP THE REMOTE AND USE IT FOR
AND THEN LASTLY WE'RE GOING TO DETERMINE ITS WORKING DESIGN HOW EXACTLY WILL IT PERFORM ITS FUNCTIONS THAT'S THE WHOLE TECHNICAL SIDE OF
OH WELL LET'S GO AHEAD AND BACK PREVIOUS
SO WHAT I WANNA DO RIGHT NOW IS HEAR FROM ALL THREE OF YOU ON YOUR RESEARCH THAT YOU JUST DID
WHO WOULD LIKE TO UM FOLLOW THAT ONE UP
OKAY WHAT DO YOU M OH I'M SORRY
ANYTHING YOU WANNA ADD FOR PERSONAL PREFERENCES THOUGH YOU F YOU SAID ALREADY THAT WE NEEDED A LARGE ON OFF BUTTON YOU THINK
WE'LL COME TO DECISION LATER ABOUT ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT WE NEED TO INCLUDE LET'S UM WRAP UP THIS ONE AND I'M GONNA GO BACK TO MY POWERPOINT
WE'RE TRYING NOT TO OVER COMPLICATE THINGS
SO NO D. V. D. NO TIVO NO STEREO
AND WE TH NEED TO PROMOTE OUR COMPANY MORE SO WE NEED TO SOMEHOW INCLUDE OUR COLOUR AND OUR COMPANY SLOGAN ON THE REMOTE
IN STATES WE DON'T HAVE IT BUT UM IT'S LIKE THEY JUST HAVE THIS CHANNEL WHERE JUST HAS NEWS AND WEATHER KIND OF SPORTS
AND WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOUR NEWS CHANNELS NOW TOO SO THOSE ARE OUR NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS
ABOUT UM THE TARGET GROUP AND THE FUNCTIONS AND JUST DEFINITE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO AND THEN WE'LL CLOSE UP THE MEETING
SO OUR TARGET GROUP IS YOU MENTIONED UM OLDER PEOPLE
OKAY SO WE WANT UM FOR OUR TARGET GROUP WOULD WE SAY
SO SO THEY NEED NO TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE TO OPERATE
AND WE ALSO NEED TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THIS JUST TO GET IT ALL OUT ON PAPER
SO IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING JUST SAY IT AND WE'LL ADD IT TO MY MEETING MINUTES
UH WE'LL STILL PUT THAT AS A POINT THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS
IS IT GOING TO HAVE A CHARGER OR IS IT GOING TO BE RUN STRICTLY OFF BATTERIES
AND THE SPEECH RECOGNITION COULD BE PART OF THE LOST AND FOUND DEVICE TOO
HOW HOW YEAH HOW WOULD YOU LEAVE THOSE OUT
AND ALSO REMEMBER THAT IN THIS DAY IN AGE WE NEED YOU KNOW LIKE A HUNDRED BUTTON TOO
I GUESS WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS THE PROJECT FINANCING LATER MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN FIT ALL OF THE STUFF THAT WE WANT TO ON OUR BUDGET
SO WE'VE SIMPLIFIED WE DON'T NEED ALL THOSE UM PLAY FAST FORWARD REWIND
OR NO MENU BUTTONS
UM CAN WE GO BACK TO I'M GONNA LOOK REALLY QUICKLY BACK AT THOSE
EXAMPLES AND SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING
WHICH ONE IS YOURS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OR FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS MAYB YOU KNOW
Y RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE THEY'D LIKE TO BRING UP IN THIS MEETING
LET'S GO BACK TO THE MEETING CLOSURE THEN AND SEE WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT
UM I'M GONNA PUT THE MINUTES I PUT THE MINUTES FOR THE FIRST MEETING ALREADY IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER IF YOU'D LIKE TO REVIEW THEM
DO WE REALLY NEED T TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT R. S. I. IS
UH OKAY SO METHOD METHOD OF OUR DESIGN I THINK I JUST START LISTING TH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO PUT INTO THIS
EITHER THAT OR THE SMART CHIP WILL HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY SMART
TYPICALLY A REMOTE HAS EITHER TWO DOUBLE A. S OR FOUR TRIPLE A. S SOMETIMES THREE
UM A LARGE ON OFF BUTTON DEMOGRAPHICALLY WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS AN OLDER GENERATION OF PEOPLE SO A LARGE ON OFF BUTTON WOULD PROBABLY BE GOOD
SELECTION BUTTON FOR VARIOUS ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES SO YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL PERMIT YOU TO SELECT THE D. V. D. PLAYER OR THE T. V. OR THE STEREO SYSTEM
UM EXTRA BULB COULD JUST BE FOR FLASHINESS UM SUBCOMPONENT WHICH WOULD BE LIKE A WAY OF DIVERTING THE POWER TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE THE DEVICE
YEAH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO STARE AT THAT INFRA RED 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN THE BATTERY STARTS DYING IN YOUR REMOTE CURRENTLY
YOU CAN ALSO GET THE KIND OF THE T. V. GUIDE SO
HOW 'BOUT LITTLE TO NO BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY THAT YOU ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT NO
LIKE IF THIS IS GONNA GET LOST UNDERNEATH THE COACH HOW ARE WE GOING TO ACCOMMODATE THE QUICK ABILITY TO FIND IT
WHAT IF WE GAVE IT A CHARGER
AND ON THE CHARGER JUST LIKE A PHONE LIKE YOU GET A PORTABLE PHONE AND IT'S GOT A CHARGER AND IF YOU D LEAVE YOUR PHONE SOMEWHERE
YOU PUSH THE BUTTON TO FIND IT AND IT FINDS TH THE PHONE BEEPS FOR YOU
YEAH 'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY MATERIAL PRICING INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ME AT THE MOMENT SO
YEAH IT'S IN THE SHOULD BE IN THE M PROJECT
UM WELL THE FUNCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL AS WHAT UH WE'VE BEEN INFORMED
IS BASICALLY TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET FOR EXAMPLE
YOU KNOW ZERO TO NINE SO YOU CAN MOVE TO A CHANNEL THE POWER BUTTON ON SLASH OFF
AND WE CAN DECIDE IF THAT'S WHAT WE WANT UM IF WE WANT TO INCLUDE THAT ON THE REMOTE
IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD STAY ON THE T. V. ITSELF FOR EXAMPLE
UM AND YOU CAN SEE ON THE LEFT IT'S GOT A LOT MORE BUTTONS
UM SLOW REPEAT PROGRAM MUTE AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE BUTTONS AND SO IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF S ONE EXAMPLE
REWIND BUT IT'S ALSO WHAT IS FAST FORWARD IS ALSO LIKE NEXT ON A MENU
AND THEN LASTLY IT'S JUST THE QUESTIONS THAT WE WANT TO CONSIDER LIKE WHAT FUNCTIONS DO WE WANT IT TO INCLUDE
BUT WE HAVE TO INCLUDE THE FUNCTIONS THAT CAN ALLOW IT TO SET UP I IN THE FIRST PLACE
S
TO JUST SAY WHERE ARE YOU AND THING BEEPS YOU KNOW
IS THAT GONNA PUSH US OVER OUR PRODUCTION COSTS
IS GOOD TO JUST TO INDICATE I'M DOING SOMETHING IT'S SORT OF LIKE A REASSURANCE
WELL SHOULD IT BE LARGER BUTTONS IN GENERAL YOU KNOW LIKE UH THE EXAMPLES THAT I HAD THEY WERE SWI QUITE SMALL
YEAH IT'S LIKE BLACK BLACK AND WHITE KIND OF
WELL THEN THEN DO YOU PUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION DO YOU PUT THE R LIKE RECEIVER ON THE ACTUAL TELEVISION
WHEREAS IF YOU JUST SPEAK IN GENERAL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE REMOTE IN YOUR HAND AND LIKE TALK AT IT
WELL I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IF YOU CAN LIKE WELL I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S JUST A WAY OF LEAVING THEM OUT
IF YOU HAVE THIS SORT OF STRIP KIND OF DOWN AT THE BOTTOM THE BASE OF IT JUST LIKE YELLOW WITH THE R. R.
OH IT'S A YEAH
WELL THE OTHER OPTION IS SORT OF LIKE DOWN AT THE BOTTOM LIKE FARTHER AWAY
YOU JUST HAVE THIS SORT OF BOX INSET WHERE IT'S LIKE THE BUTTONS THAT YOU DON'T USE AS MUCH BUT OCCASIONALLY YOU WILL USE
WELL THAT COULD BE NO YOU COULD JUST DOUBLE UP WITH LIKE THE CHANNEL OR THE VOLUME BUTTONS
SO WE JUST HAVE IT LIKE ADD A MENU BUTTON THEN FOR THE VARIOUS THINGS NEEDED
AND BASICALLY W WE JUST NEED SOMETHING THAT REALLY I MEAN THERE'S SOME OTHER POINTS UP THERE BUT THEY IT NEEDS TO BE SNAZZY AND IT BUT YET SIMPLE
AND WE NEED WE NEED IT TO BE SIMPLE YET IT NEEDS TO BE HIGH TECH LOOKING
THEY LIKE I GUESS USE THE BUTTONS A LOT
WHEREAS LIKE THE ENGINEERING SHE SHOWED THAT THE ENGINEERING ONES ARE MORE COMPLEX AND USERS DON'T REALLY NEED ALL OF THE BUTTONS THAT ARE CONTAINED ON THERE
UH YEAH THAT'S WHAT MY WEB SITE SAID I
I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW IT AS REMOTE CONTROL EXPERTS
BUT ALSO S SO THE CHANNEL
THE VOLUME AND THE POWER BUTTONS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ON OUR COMPANY WEBSITE YOU CAN FIND LIKE THE SPECIFIC STATISTICS CONCERNING TO HOW MUCH EACH BUTTON IS USED
WHERE THE ENGINEERING ONES THE BOXES TEND TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT REALLY IS
UM THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PRODUCT REALLY NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS TO LIKE WHAT TYPE OF BUTTONS DO WE REALLY NEED ON IT
AND IT NEEDS TO BE OPEN TO A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMERS SO EVEN THOUGH WE NEED A SMALL NUMBER OF BUTTONS
A TIVO WHAT WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE USING IT FOR AS WELL AS THE AGE RANGE
AND ALSO WE FOUND OUR TEAM FOUND THAT SPEECH RECOGNITION IS IT'S LIKE AN UP AND COMING THING THEY REALLY CONSUMERS ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN IT
YEAH I GUESS WE CAN INTERPRET IT LIKE WE CAN JUST TRY OUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPEECH RECOGNITION WITHIN OUR REMOTE PROGRAMME
LIKE I THINK THAT WOULD BE IN A AS IN LIKE IN FOR THE DESIGN SORRY UM
YEAH I THINK WE NEED IT ALL
THOSE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES
I NEED WE WE NEED A LIKE HOMING DEVICE
DO W
WELL WE DEFINITELY NEED THOSE
I FEEL LIKE A YE I FEEL LIKE A YELLOW ONE WOULD BE TOO GARISH
AND LIKE ON TELEVISION LIKE I KNOW F K LIVING IN LOS ANGELES IT'S TONS OF SPANISH NETWORK TELEVISION IF IT HAS ENGLISH SUB TITLES IT'S DEFINITELY HELPFUL
SO WE NEED UP DOWN AND SIDE TO SIDE BUTTONS
SUCH AS YEAH THE ONE THE ONE OVER THERE ON THE LEFT THE ENGINEERING CENTRED ONE
OOH I JUST GOT AN IDEA FOR A DESIGN
HI TEAM
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS ONE FROM EACH OF YOU AGAIN
'KAY AND JUST TO REITERATE UM AFTER THIS MEETING THE TEAM WILL REACH A DECISION ON THE CONCEPTS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
PEOPLE DON'T BUY A NEW REMOTE EVERY SO OFTEN
Y
GOT IT
LET'S GO BACK TO UM NOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS
DO WE WANNA GO FOR BATTERIES OR A STAND LIKE THE ONE THAT WE SAW ILLUSTRATED EARLIER
ALRIGHT SO WHAT DIRECTION DO YOU WANT TO GO IN
I'M KIND OF I'M KIND OF LEANING IN THE DIRECTION OF THIS KIND OF
OH WHAT DID YOU OH SORRY GO AHEAD
I I THINK WE SHOULD JUST FOCUS ON ONE DESIGN AND ONE CONCEPT RIGHT NOW
THEY'RE MORE EXPENSIVE THOUGH TOO
IT MIGHT BE THE FOUR WAY SCROLL TOO
OH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
W
I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD DO IT ON A B BUTTON ITSELF THOUGH
BECAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO CHANGE THE COVERS I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THE ON OFF BUTTON
SOMETHING SOME THE MENU BUTTON I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA PUT OUR COMPANY LOGO ON THERE AND SOMEBODY COULD JUST GET
IF WE WANT IT TO BE VISIBLE AND
UM ARE ALL THOSE THOSE ONE THAT YOU SHOWED WHERE THEY WERE UM S MET SILVER METALLIC LOOKING
I KIND OF LIKE THAT LOOK
ON THE BACK
IT D VISIBLE VISIBILITY THOUGH 'CAUSE IF IT WAS ONLY ON THE BACK REALLY THE ONLY TIME YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT IS WHEN YOU DROP IT OR WHEN YOU'RE CHANGING THE BATTERY
WELL FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T GET IT TO JUST GO TO THAT SLIDE DIRECTLY
WE ALL SEEM TO BE FAIRLY IN AGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT WE WANNA DO WITH THIS PROJECT SO
AND HERE'S WHAT WE'RE EACH OF US GOING TO DO
YEAH TH
MINE WILL ALWAYS READ COPY OF SOMETHING OR OTHER
WHOO
FINDINGS OH WHICH WERE THE REQUIRED MATERIALS FOR THE BASIC INTERNAL CONSTRUCTION SO ALL THE REALLY SIMPLISTIC FUNCTIONS THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED WE NEED RUBBER FOR BUTTONS
RESONATOR RESISTORS AND A CAPACITATOR ALL THOSE BASIC THINGS THAT MAKE A CIRCUIT FUNCTION
UM FIBREGLASS AND THIN COPPER WIRE TO CREATE THE ACTUAL CIRCUIT BOARD ITSELF
AN L. E. D. WHICH IS A LIGHT EMITTING DIODE UM CONTACT DISCS FOR THE BUTTONS
ANY ADDITIONAL MATERIALS WE DECIDE WE REQUIRE AT A LESS EXPENSIVE RATE THAN WE OURSELVES ARE PRODUCING WE SHOULD GO FOR IT
UM JUST TALKING TO THE UM MANUFACTURING DIVISION
AND UH SO YOU FUNCTIONS WHAT FOR THE BUTTONS SCROLLING FUNCTION COULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO US INSTEAD OF ACTUAL BUTTONS THEMSELVES
IN ADDITION TO THAT IF WE'RE OFFERING ALL THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO THE CUSTOMER FOR PRODUCING THEIR REMOTE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MULTIPLES OF EACH TYPE
LIKE A DOUBLE CURVED IN RUBBER UM YOU KNOW EACH OPTION SHOULD HAVE A CERTAIN SELECT NUMBER PRODUCED WITH ALL THOSE OPTIONS
I I THOUGHT OFFERING SOME OF THOSE OPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT MATERIALS THAT IT COULD BE MADE OF DIFFERENT
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IF YOU FORGET TO TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR POCKET AND IT GOES IN WASH
I'VE HAD THREE WATCHES GO THAT WAY TOO
WE COULD DO UH ONE THAT FITS IN WITH THE TRENDS OF THE YEAR SO BECAUSE THIS YEAR IS ALL FRUIT GOD ONLY KNOWS WHY
UM WE COULD DO F A CHERRY COVER FOR THIS YEAR AND THEN I IF NEXT YEAR IS STRIPES OR SOLIDS YOU KNOW
AND BUY THE EXTRA CASE
YEAH SEE THAT WOULD JUST IRRITATE ME
I THINK WELL WE COULD D R DO TWO OR WE COULD DO ONE SMALL LITHIUM
WELL HOW ABOUT A INITIAL YOU GET ONE BATTERY WHEN YOU BUY IT 'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE WE CAN GET THEM PRETTY CHEAP ON BULK
IN THE SAMPLE ONES THAT YOU SHOWED US THERE WAS ONE THAT HAD THE SCROLL BUTTONS ON THE SIDE
SO WE'LL HAVE TO LIKE HAVE A LITTLE SQUARE OR SOMETHING SO THAT THE OUR LOGO'S AVAILABLE
SO I THINK MAYBE PUTTING IT ON A BUTTON IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA
OOH
SEE IF IT'S THERE
IF YOU SEE ON TH ON THE SIDES OF OF THE REMOTE YOU HAVE THE SORT OF SCROLL DOWN SO YOU HAVE THAT OPTION RIGHT THERE
IT'S BECOMING REALLY AND SO YOU HAVE THIS SORT OF VERY VERY SIMPLISTIC MENU SECTION UH WITH THE ROUND BUTTONS
SO IF YOU WANTED TO DO THAT TH IF WE COULD FIND A WAY OF SORT OF LIKE USING THAT IDEA IN A REMOTE CONTROL THEN SORT OF
AND SO YO YOU'RE KIND OF FEELING A V. LIKE VOLUME UP
EITHER THAT OR JUST HAVE IT BY SHAPE FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC TRIANGULAR SHAPE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE UP AND DOWN ARROW
SO IT'S SORT OF LOOKING INTO HOW WE WANTED T TO DO IT BY FEEL
UM IT'S VERY CUTE AND WE COULD PROBABLY CHANGE IT TO YELLOW BRIGHT YELLOW FOR LIKE A THE FOR THE COMPANY LOGO
UM AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IS JUST TO PRO BE AB YOU PROGRAM CERTAIN
SO THAT'S LIKE ANOTHER AR UM I MEAN THESE ARE THREE EXAMPLES SORT OF LOOKING AT IT
ON THE BOTTOM WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T NEED THAT BECAUSE IT'S MORE FOR LIKE A D. V. D. FUNCTION WHICH WE ARE NOT GONNA BE USING
SO AGAIN IT'S SORT OF LIKE JUST GIVE YOU IDEAS AND THEN DOWN AT THE BOTTOM YOU HAVE THE LOGOS AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COULD PUT THE R. R.
AND THEN FINALLY THESE ARE LIKE THE SORT OF SAME EXAMPLES BUT ALSO SOME MORE JUST POSSIBILITIES THAT WE COULD GO WITH
WELL OUT OF THIS ONE WE LIKE YOU KNOW THE ROUND SECTION OF UM B OR WE'D LIKE THE THE BUTTON SIZE ON THIS
UM THERE'S A SAMPLE SENSOR AND THERE'S A SAMPLE SPEAKER UNIT FOR SO
YOU WOULD SAY LIKE GOOD MORNING COFFEEMAKER AND IT WOULD RESPOND GOOD MORNING JILL BUT
OR CAN IT BE ALTERED IN A CERTAIN WAY OR DOES THE ACTUALLY USER PROGRAM IT TO SAY A CHANNEL MEANS THIS
THEN IT'S SORT OF HARDER TO IMAGINE A BASE FOR IT THAT WAS P QUITE A S SUBSTANTIAL SIZE SORT OF STANDING UP
WELL THE OTHER THING IS LIKE EVEN IF IT'S GOT A FEW BUTTONS SO WE WANT IT TO BE BIGGER THAN THIS
ARE YOU GONNA LOSE IT EASIER
BUT LIKE YOU KNOW IF WE GET MORE COMPLICATED THEN IT'S GONNA V BE HAVE TO BE BIGGER TO JUST ACCOMMODATE THE CHIP SIZE
WELL TITANIUM S I WAS SAYING THAT TITANIUM IF WE'RE BEING RESTRICTED THEN
AND THEN SHE WOULD LAUGH AND IT WOULD START GOING OFF IN HER PURSE AND YOU COULDN'T TURN IT OFF
WELL THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE ENERGY IS NEEDED
WELL MY ISSUE WITH THAT IS IF IT GOT TOO BIG THOUGH 'CAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE CIRCLE AND THE BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE
THEN IS IT GONNA GET WIDER THAN YOUR YOUR HANDS ARE BECAUSE W AND THEN WOULD THE BUTTONS BE TOO SMALL IF IT WAS ENOUGH TO FIT ON IT
WELL THE OTHER OPTION IS IN INSTEAD OF A SCROLL YOU JUST HAVE THE BUTTONS UP ON THE SIDE WHICH ARE ON THE SIDE
I'M JUST REALLY WARY OF THE PUTTING ANYTHING ON A BUTTON
WHAT'S THE BUTTON WELL W W THEN WHAT'S THE BUTTON DO AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS WHAT THE BUTTON DOES
JUST LOOKING AT EXAMPLES Y YOU JUST DON'T EVER SEE THE LOGO ON A BUTTON IT'S ALWAYS ON THE ACTUAL CASING
BUT YOU DON'T BUT UH YEAH YOU DON'T SEE IT
THE OTHER OPTION IS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE IT BUT IT'S LIKE IF
YOU SEE AT THE BOTTOM IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO SEE BUT YOU HAVE LIKE A D SORT OF S DIVISION BETWEEN THE BOTTOM LIKE
AND SO THAT STAYS THE SAME WHEN YOU HAVE THE LOGO AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS S SLIP THAT KINDA CLIPS IN AND THAT'S THE BIT THAT CHANGES
OH THAT ONE
HA HANG ON LET ME CATCH UP
FUN
UM BASICALLY ABOUT FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT OF WHAT THEY LIKE OF THE PRODUCT THAT THEY WANT DESCRIBING LIKE THE IN ORDER OF HOW MUCH THEY WANT
FIFTY EIGHT PER CENT OF THE DECISION OF WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE FANCY VERSUS FUNCTIONAL
I MEAN I GUESS THE SPONGY COULD RELATE TO THE BUTTONS IF WE WANT TO RATHER THAN LIKE A HARD CLICKY BUTTON THAT YOU FIND ON LIKE SOME MOBILES AND STUFF
BUT AS FOR THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLE PATTERNS I DON'T KNOW IF WE REALLY WANT TO GO WITH THAT BECAUSE IT IS JUST A TREND
UM AND THAT COULD ALSO TIE IN WITH THE COLOUR SCHEME
SO I MEAN THAT'S JUST AN IDEA IF YOU GUYS LIKE IT
OH THIS THE THING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER
YEAH LIKE USING THE MENU TO BE LIKE ENTER YOUR NAME INTO THE SCREEN LIKE ON THE MENU OPTIONS
THE I MEAN JUST LIKE THE MORE ADVANCED IT IS
OH THE BASE YEAH
W
YEAH 'CAUSE IF IT'S GONNA COST US MORE TO PRODUCE A CHIP TITANIUM WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE
WE COULD DO THAT BECAUSE ALL OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PEOPLE ARE DEFINITELY WILLING TO SPEND MORE IF
THAT'S IN
'CAUSE THAT UH WHAT IT TYPE OF YEAH FOR VOICE ACTIVATION WOULD IT BE LIKE A CERTAIN TERM WHAT WE WOULD SAY LIKE
OOH
UH SEE I'M UH I'M STRANGELY ATTRACTED TO IT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE BIG
OH THEN MAYBE VOICE
YEAH N N NO WE JUST WANT IT TO BE A FINDER
BUT DO CAN YOUR CAN THE DEPARTMENT MAKE
WE COULD THINK ABOUT IT AND COME BACK TO IT NEXT MEETING
THERE'S LIKE THAT JUST LIKE PIECE OF METAL OR LIKE A PICTURE OR SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE
BUT WE DEFINITELY IF WE HAVE SCROLL THINGS ON THE SIDE WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO HAVE 'EM LABELLED
YEAH LIKE ON THE SIDE OF IT
OH IF IT'S JUST UP AND DOWN
BUT WE WANT IT TO BE SEEN
WE NEED IT TO BE SEEN
SOME OF THO
WELL SOME OF THOSE BUTTONS THOUGH ARE BLUE BASED
UM WELL A LOT OF THOSE BUTTONS ARE BLUE BASED
LIKE IF WE LIKE THE ONE ALL THE WAY ON THE LEFT UH YOU CA YOU CAN SEE IT ON YOUR COMPUTER BETTER
ME TOO
AND DID YOU DETERMINE UM THE CURVATURE OF THE BOTTOM PART OF IT FOR THE HAND IS IT GONNA BE A SINGLE OR A DOUBLE
I THINK YOU DID AN AWESOME JOB
ARE WE GOING TO INDI I SAY WE INDIVIDUALLY RATE WHAT DO YOU SAY
JUST ORALLY
OH TWO
ME TOO VERY CHIC
ONE I GIVE IT A ONE
OH AND MA IT'S A PROTOTYPE RIGHT
I THINK SO TOO
IS IT TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
I'D GO FOR A THREE OR FOUR ON THAT ONE SO OKAY LET'S GO FOR A THREE POINT FIVE
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET AND WE'RE GOING TO FILL IT IN TOGETHER BASED ON WHAT COMPONENTS WE'RE INCLUDING IN OUR REMOTE AND SEE IF IT'S UNDER TWELVE FIFTY EURO
'CAUSE TRIPLE A. S WE'RE GONNA HAVE T DO MORE THAN ONE BATTERY
OH LET'S JUST GO FOR A LITHIUM
WE'RE GONNA NEED THIS KIND CORRECT IF WE DO THE VOICE SENSOR SO ONE OF THOSE
IT IS A SINGLE CURVED SO ONE OF THOSE
ISN'T OH THOSE ARE JUST REGULAR BUTTONS
RIGHT I THINK SHE'S I THINK WHAT COURTNEY'S TALKING ABOUT IS DO WE NEED TO PUT TWO HERE
I DON'T KNOW THEY MIGHT PUT US WELL LET'S JUST
TWO OR WOULD IT BE THREE
OKAY AND WE'RE GONNA BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS THE BUTTONS ARE NO UH OKAY
I DUNNO WHAT I JUST DID
DID WE HAVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP UM TEAMWORK AND THE MEANS
FOR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS COOL AND ALSO HAS WHAT I WANT IT TO B DO TECHNOLOGICALLY
AND THAT'S YOUR RIGHT BRAIN TAKING OVER W WANTING THE ARTISTIC THE FASHIONABLE THE HIP YOU KNOW
IF WE ALL JUST WENT OUT AND BOUGHT USEFUL THINGS I DON'T THINK I MEAN THAT'S NOT WHAT TECHNOLOGY
I MEAN HOW MANY PEOPLE WENT OUT AND BOUGH A NOKIA PHONE BACK WHEN WE WERE LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL
ANYWAY SO THAT IS DEFINITELY AT WORK
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG GIANT PARTY APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO THIS SO
ALRIGHT THANK YOU TEAM YOU DID A GREAT JOB IT WAS LOVELY WORKING WITH YOU
Y YOU READ THAT STUFF SINCE YOU WROTE IT
ON OFF SWITCH WILL BE HERE AND AS YOU'VE NOTICED ON OUR PROTOTYPE UM THEY'VE ENDED UP WITH A CURVATURE KIND OF
NICE TO STOCK YOU KNOW STICK YOUR FINGER IN
UM THE TWO SQUARED BUTTONS ARE ARE TWO PROBABLY LEAST USED MENU
MUTE AND THEN THESE ARE THE NUMBERS SO OUR CHANNEL AND OUR VOLUME WILL BE ON EITHER SIDE
I'LL GIVE IT A TWO BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT LOOKING THAT WAY
NEITHER ARE ALL O ALL THE CUSTOMERS WE HAVE EITHER
IT WASN'T WE HAVE NO REFLECTION OF IT ON THE PROTOTYPE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TWO DIMENSIONS REALLY
THREE AND AN HALF
WELL THAT'S THE PUSH BUTTON TOO RIGHT THERE
LET'S CALL IT TH
WELL NO THERE WAS THERE WAS SCRATCHING AND FIGHTING BUT NO
THE USE OF THE LAPTOPS FOR RECEIVING EVERYTHING
IT WAS WIRELESS TOO SO
AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE SEXY DUAL MICROPHONES EVERYONE GETS TO WEAR
NOT ME
WE CAN CREATE A COMMERCIAL WHERE THEY THINK THAT ALL THEIR NEEDS WILL BE MET
AND SO THE SERPENT SAYS USE OUR REMOTE
UM SURE
YOU OR ME
UM THEN THERE'S THE LATEX COVER WHICH IS WHAT YOU SEE AS RED
YEAH I GO FOUR
OH LIKE THE TWENTY NINE MEANS LIKE YOU HAVE BOTH SCROLLS AND
TWO INTERFACES IS THAT WHAT W SHOULD WE S SAY
AND THEN S YEAH
OH I SEE
AND NO INTERNET
AND NO INTERNET
MISSES
I DO
WELL THAT'S WHY I DON'T LIKE UH MACS OR APPLES JUST 'CAUSE I LOOK AT IT AND I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY A VERY GOOD COMPUTER
BUT I LOOK AT IT AND I'M TAKEN BACK TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 'CAUSE THEY LOOK THE SAME
BUT THE MY BUT MY ONE ISSUE IS JUST LIKE THE WHOLE IT'S FOR T. V. ONLY
RI THEY'LL BE SEXY WITH IT
LET YOU LOOSE
I WANNA FIND OUR IF OUR REMOTE WORKS
THOSE ARE REALLY GOOD
IS IT FASHIONABLE UH YEAH I GUESS WE SHOULD WRITE THESE DOWN SO WE CAN REFERENCE THEM
IT FALLS WITHIN THIS RANGE SO FOR EASY TO USE
I THI I WOULD GIVE IT A ONE
AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN REPRESENT IT ON HERE
Y
THEN YES THEN I WOULD WELL IT ISN'T WHAT ELSE WOULD IT NEED FOR IT TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
AND IT DOESN'T COVER ANYTHING OTHER THEN T. V. SO I'D PROBABLY GIVE IT A THREE
EVEN THOUGH IT IS FOR JUST A T. V. REMOTE IT'S UH VERY ADVANCED
OH IT'S VERY CAPABLE OF BEING SQUISHY AND FRUITY
SO UM OUR RE MODEL SLIGHTLY RESEMBLING A GIANT DELICIOUS COOKIE APPEARS TO BE A WINNER AND UH HOPEFULLY WE'LL SELL MILLIONS
WE'RE GON THAT'S GON
UH
YEAH BUT I SO I
BUT WILL WE W ACTUALLY WE'LL NEED TWO WON'T WE
ONE FOR THE TOP AND THEN ONE FOR THE S ONE E FOR EACH SIDE
LIKE BECAUSE THERE'S LIKE ONE INTERFACE RIGHT HERE AND THEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE ON THE SAME PLANE WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTON
SO IS THAT GONNA BE AN EXTRA ONE ON EACH SIDE
OR THREE BECAUSE OF ONE ON EACH SIDE AND ONE ON TOP
I MEAN IT'S FINE 'CAUSE IT COMES OUT THE SAME AS TWENTY NINE
WE GOT TO CHOOSE BASICALLY WE HAD CONTROL OVER MINUS IT BEING JUST MERELY A T. V. REMOTE WE GOT TO CHOOSE WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WITH IT
MINUS THAT ONE FIGHT
I MEAN MINUS YOU GUYS BEING WHA WHAT IS IT THE SURVEY ANNOYING OR WHAT IS IT
YEAH AND NO INTERNET
TA DA
UH YEAH
LOOK AT IT
OH I WILL CREATE DESIRE
YOU TOO
UH 'S HORSES NO PARTICULAR REASON WHY
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS IT'LL ACTUALLY PICK UP THE SIGNALS FROM KIND OF ANYWHERE AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LIKE CONTORT YOURSELF AND TWIST YOUR REMOTE CONTROL TO GET IT THE T. V. TO ACTUALLY PICK UP THE SIGNAL
OH I THINK IT'S IT'S REMOTE CONTROLS ARE KIND OF A UNIQUE OBJECT 'CAUSE IT'S YOU DEPEND ON THEM SO MUCH
YOU DON'T THINK OF THEM AS A COMP LIKE A COMPUTER CAN BREAK DOWN AND YOU'RE KINDA LIKE OH WELL FAIR ENOUGH THERE'S ALL THESE COMPLEX THINGS GOING ON
GOD FORBID YOU ACTUALLY GET UP AND MANUALLY CHANGE THE CHANNEL IT JUST IT NEEDS TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE VERY ALWAYS DEPENDABLE
UH I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT TOO SMALL I 'CAUSE I THINK IT NEEDS TO IT CAN'T BE TOO BIG LIKE YOU WERE SAYING BIG AN AND HUGE AND UM AWKWARD
BUT SO YES DEPENDABLE AND HAVE A GOOD MEDIUM RANGE SIZE
YOU CAN GET LIKE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW SCENES FROM DIFFERENT MOVIES AND STUFF ON THE REMOTE CONTROL AND SORTA STAGGER THE RELEASE OF THEM AND GET PEOPLE LIKE OH I WANT THAT COVER ON IT NOW AND THAT'LL KEEP THEM SPENDING MONEY
I'M KENDRA AND I'M THE US USER INTERFACE DESIGNER AND UM I HAVEN'T HAD A WHOLE LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS KIND OF THING BEFORE BUT I'M M SO I'LL BE
YEP I'M JUST OPEN TO BEING CREATIVE
I THINK SOMETHING THAT'S COMFORTABLE TO HOLD BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU GET THE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE JUST THOSE BIG
RECTANGULAR THINGS AND UH THEY'RE KIND OF AWKWARD TO HOLD ONTO SO SOMETHING THAT'S MORE COMFORTABLE THAT FITS IN A PERSON'S HAND BETTER
WELL MOST I THINK MOST OF THE REMOTE CONTROLS NOW ARE EITHER JUST BLACK OR GREY
HAVE IT KIND OF LOOK HOW THEY WANT TO DIFFERENT COLOURS THINGS LIKE THAT PROBABLY JUST PLASTIC BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS THE LIGHTEST
UH THIS FOLLOWS OUR VERY SUCCESSFUL ENTRY INTO THE THE CONSUMER MARKET OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO UM WHICH WE WANT TO TO BUILD ON
UH ONE THAT EVERYBODY WANTS UH AT A GOOD PRICE FOR THE CONSUMER AND AT A GOOD PRICE FOR THE COMPANY
UH AND TO THAT END WE NEED ALL TO WORK TOGETHER UH TO DO THAT
UM AND UH B IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER BECAUSE EV EVERYBODY IS UH JUST AS VITAL TO THIS PROJECT UM I'LL JUST GO ROUND TH THE TABLE ANDREW
WHAT'S UH THE THE TH TH PROJECT IS IS HERE TO DO IS IS TO TO GET THIS THIS PROJECT UP AND MOVING
EVERYBODY FEEL FREE TO INTERRUPT ME AT ANY TIME TO TO SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY
EVERYBODY'S WORKED FOR THE THE COMPANY FOR A WHILE IF IF AN ANYBODY FEELS THAT THEY NEED TO SAY MORE ABOUT THEMSELVES PLEASE DO
IF IF IF ANYBODY WANTS TO B BRIEFLY GIVE THEIR THEIR BACKGROUND SO THAT EVERYBODY'S QUITE CLEAR WHAT EVERYBODY UH UH EVERYBODY'S EXPERIENCE IS PLEASE DO SO
UH
IN FACT WE WILL DO THAT BY BY GOING ROUND THE TABLE QUICKLY AND AND SAYING WHAT WHAT CONTRIBUTION YOU YOU'RE LOOKING TO MAKE
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT UH OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS DON'T HAVE SO THAT AS SOON AS PEOPLE SEE IT THEY THINK UM YES THAT'S DIFFERENT
UH I WANT ONE UM AND THAT GOES ALONG WITH BEING TRENDY UH UH YOU KNOW THE I WANT IT
USER FRIENDLY AS AS WE ALL KNOW
REMOTE CONTROLS CAN BE UH UH VERY USER UNFRIENDLY SO WE WANT TO MAKE OURS ONE THAT PEOPLE CAN PICK UP AND THINK OH YES THAT'S IT'S OBVIOUS HOW THAT WORKS
UH AND THEY ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THE PRICE AND THINK OH YEAH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I MAY NOT NEED ANOTHER REMOTE CONTROL BUT UH IT'S SUCH A NICE ONE I'M GONNA HAVE ONE
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST OR INDEED FIRST OF ALL IT IT MUST MAKE THE COMPANY MONEY
THE UH THE FURTHER WORK TO BE DONE IS I THE UM THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UH WHAT IT UH WHAT IT MUST ACTUALLY DO
THE UH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN UH HOW WE ACTUALLY PRESENT THAT TO THE CONSUMER AND TH THE THE DETAILED DESIGN I IS UH HOW WE GET THAT INTO PRODUCTION
UH NOW TH THE MAIN DESIGN TOOL THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US AT THE MOMENT IS IS THE WHITE BOARD AND UH UH LET US VERY QUICKLY DO WHAT I WHAT IT SAYS IN THE IN THE IN THE PROMPT SLIDE HERE
SO I I EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT WHITEBOARD IS SO WE'LL UM UH WE'LL DO A VIRTUAL DRAWING ON THE ON ON THE WHITEBOARD OF OF YOUR YOUR OWN UH UH FAVOURITE ANIMAL
BUT LE LET'S GO ROUND THE TABLE YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL
INDEED ABSOLUTELY YES THA THAT'S UM
OKAY AND UH W WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND HERE THAT THE UH WE WANT TO SELL THIS FOR FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO UM
WE WANT TO M MAKE AN OVERALL PROFIT FOR THE THE COMPANY OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT SELLING A LOT OF THESE UM AG ACROSS THE THE ENTIRE PLANET AND AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A GROSS PROFIT OF FIFTY PERCENT
UM SO WE'RE NOT ONLY LOOKING AT A A VERY TRENDY ORIGINAL PRODUCT WE'RE LOOKING AT MAKING IT AT A VERY GOOD PRICE
UM OKAY UM WOULD ANYBODY LIKE T LIKE TO TO START BY GIVING THEIR O UM SORT OF QUICK VIEWS OF OF CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
ARE THERE YOU KNOW BAD ONES THEY'VE USED OR GOOD ONES THEY'VE USED OR ONES THAT THEY'VE LOST AND NEVER FOUND AGAIN
UM WHAT SO WH WHAT'S IN IN WHAT PARTICULAR STYLE FEATURES ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
YEAH D NO I MEAN DO YOU THINK THERE'S A RISK IF IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE REMOTE CONTROL PEOPLE WON'T SEE IT AS A REMOTE CONTROL UM AND UH
ANY OTHER THOUGHTS ABOUT UM TH THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF A OF REMOTE CONTROLS
I MEAN TH THE THING THAT I IMMEDIATELY COMES TO MIND IS COMPUTER MOUSES WHICH UM I MEAN Y YOU GET ALL SORTS OF SHAPES IN THE SHOPS AND S YOU KNOW SOME QUITE FANCY ONES UM THAN THE SOME FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHICH LOOK NICE BUT AREN'T PARTICULARLY COMFORTABLE
FI FIND THE BUTTON BUTTONS EASILY
UM DO WE NEED IT TO UH I CAN'T THINK OF ANY RE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT I KNOW OF THAT ACTUALLY LIGHT UP AT ALL
ANDREW HAVE YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS YET ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT MARKET SOMETHING WHICH THERE ARE ALREADY MILLIONS OUT THERE AND THAT WE WANT TO UH UH UH T TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE
OKAY YEAH YEAH WELL I D I THINK AN ANY UH ANY FACETS THAT WE IDENTIFY W WE AIM NEED TO AIM FOR FOR ALL OF
MIGHT NEED SO
UH ANDREW ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT UH HOW WE MIGHT MARKET INTERCHANGEABLE FRONTS ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
START LOOKING AT THE UM AT THE DESIGN IN MORE DETAIL
UH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIKE AND FROM A FASHION POINT OF VIEW AND THE PRACTICALITY POINT OF VIEW
THINK A LOT OF THE TIME REMOTES THAT COME WITH T. V. PLAYERS AND T. V. S AND D. V. PLAYERS LIKE THEY AREN'T
LIKE AN AREA THAT'S PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THEY'RE VERY BORING VERY PLAIN
EASILY PUT US ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE CURRENT COMPETITION
SO IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE UH SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU THINK OH WHAT'S THIS
LIKE THIS PEN DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE A PEN BUT IT MAKES YOU THINK OH
UH I SUPPOSE SUPPOSE THAT'S UP TO THE MARKETING TO
WELL FROM THE MOUSE IDEA YOU COULD REMOTE IS A PIECE OF PLASTIC WITH THE BIG RUBBER BUTTONS STICKING OUT OF IT WHICH YOU PRESS
I THINK IF W IF WE MARKET IT AS AS NOT AS NOT WELL THIS YOU C YOU COULD EITHER MARKET IT AS THE POINT OF VIEW WE COULD HAVE THE TWO WE COULD HAVE PARALLEL MARKETING S SCHEMES WHERE YOU'VE GOT ONE WHERE IT APPEALS TO PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HAVE THE NEW DEVICE THAT LOOKS COOL
IS FASHIONABLE AND LIKE YOU JUST IT'S IT'S LIKE UH IT'S ONE THAT RATHER THAN RA I WAN I WANT RATHER THAN A KIND OF A NEED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEVICE
BUT THAT MIGHT CONSIDERING THE ACT WHAT THE DEVICE IS FOR AND THE NATURE OF SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE RESPOND TO HAVING A DEVICE THAT THEY JUST LOOKS NICE
THEREFORE THEY WANT IT SO MAKE IT PRACTICAL AT THE SAME TIME
SO UM I DUNNO WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH WHICH ANGLE WE'RE GONNA GO TO OR BOTH
YOU GE YOU GET THE F UH THE FACE PLATES WITH IT WHEN YOU BUY OR AS A SEPARATE THING
MAYBE A SECOND THING LIKE A SECOND CAMPAIGN TO MARKET NEW FACIALS FOR YOUR TO YOUR MIGHT GO A BIT ASTRAY SINCE IT IS THE KIND OF THING WHERE Y YOU GENERALLY GET ONE AND THEN FORGET ABOUT IT
OH IT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
P
WELL THE ONLY PROBLEM I CAN THINK OF WITH THAT IS IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANNA BE BOTHERED LEARNING HOW TO USE NEW REM REMOTE CONTROLS
OH YOU HAVE TO HIT LIKE FUNCTION AND F. SOMETHING
OH YEAH THEY'RE ALL THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED TO ANYTHING ON THE TABLE YOU JUST LEAVE 'EM ON AND WALK AROUND WITH 'EM
I CAN'T DID YOU COULD YOU SEE IT ON YOU SCREEN WHEN IT
OH WELL
OKAY UM JUST AT THE M YEAH THE WHOLE SORT OF METHOD OF HOW THE REMOTE CONTROL WORKS
WHICH CONTROLS THE CHIP AND THUS THE MESSAGES AND UH THE USER INTERFACE IS THAT'S BASICALLY JUST YOU KN THE S SORTA DESIGN OF THE ACTUAL REMOTE WHICH YOU HOLD IN YOUR HANDS AND WHAT BUTTONS WILL BE ON IT
OH SHOOT
UM A CIRCUIT CHIP WITHIN THAT TO UH CONTROL AND SEND THE MESSAGES AND UM A SENDER AND RECEIVER
UH THIS JUST KINDA REPRESENTS THE ENERGY SOURCE WHICH FEEDS INTO THE CIRCUIT CHIP UH WHICH MAYBE THEN WE COULD HAVE THAT FEED INTO A SWITCH WHICH WOULD SEND SIGNALS F TO UM A SUBCOMPONENT AND ON TO A LIGHT BULB BETWEEN SO IT'LL LIGHT UP ONCE WE START ONCE YOU START PRESSING BUTTONS
AND SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES I I JUST THINK WE NEED SORTA BIG UH ENERGY SOURCE THAT WON'T DIE OUT
UH PERHAPS SOME SORT OF RECHARGEABLE BATTERY OR A BATTERY DOCK YOU COULD PLACE IT IN
JUST HAVING ONE THAT'S GUARANTEED TO LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS
BUT YOU WILL HAVE THE BATTERY THERE FOR WHEN YOU NEED IT
OH IT DEPEND IF IT'S UH DEPENDS WHO WHO'S USING IT WHO'S JUST SITTING THERE CLICKING CLICKING CLICKING CLICKING YEAH
IT COULD BE OH UH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY UH MAYBE LIKE THE FLIP PHONES THAT THEY USE
HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW MO MOBILE PHONES THAT FLIP OUT AND THEY HAVE THE LIKE TEXTING AND THEN THE NUMBERS ON ONE SIDE
SO YOU COULD HAVE THE MOST USED BUTTONS ON TOP AND FLIP IT OUT OR SOMETHING
HAVE A BIG KIND OF LIKE THE SATELLITE BOX OR THE CABLE BOX AND HAVE IT JUST GO ON THE T. V. AND THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IN THE ROOM YOU ARE
IS IT DOING
THERE'S A USER CENTRED ONE AND AN ENGINEERING CENTRED ONE WHICH I WILL HAVE PICTURES OF AND THEN WE KINDA HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH ONE THIS SHOULD BE
WHICH HAS A LOT MORE BUTTONS AND PROBABLY THIS IS ONE THAT PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT ABOUT HAVING TOO MANY BUTTONS THAT YOU DON'T USE
SO BASICALLY WHAT A REMOTE CONTROL IS IS YOU IT'S TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET
AND SO FOR THIS PRODUCT IT'S GONNA BE TELEVISION ONLY AND THEN IT HAS TO HAVE THE UH LOGOS
E THE UNIQUE STYLE MAYBE HAVE IT LIGHT UP SO IT'S VISIBLE IN THE DARK
F THEY PROBABLY CLIP TO YOU
HMM I THINK IT'S ALL THERE
H
YEAH PEOPLE ARE PRO I WOULD THINK THAT PEOPLE MIGHT FORGET I MEAN PEOPLE FORGET TO PUT THEIR CORDLESS PHONES BACK ON THERE SO
THOUGH I THINK WITH DIGITAL T. V. LIKE I KNOW ON MY CABLE BOX
UH OH
OH I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION
SO ARE WE DOING JUST THE TELEVISION OR ARE WE DOING SO NOT D. V. D. PLAYERS WE OKAY OKAY
UM WE WE S WE SAW THAT THE THE PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS WERE THE UH B A BORING SHAPE AND BORING COLOUR
UM AND AND WE S WE SAW THAT THE UM WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO WAS TO TO MAKE SURE THE DEVICE UM CONTROLS SEVERAL ITEMS
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T NEED TO POINT THE THING AT UH ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR UM THAT IT NEED TO BE CONTOURED TO MAKE IT INTERESTING
THAT THE KEYS MIGHT BE CONCAVE SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE THAT WE KNOW OF
UM SHOULD HAVE INTERCHANGEABLE FASCIAS SO PEOPLE CAN PERSONALISE IT UM ILLUMINATED SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE IT IN DARK ROOMS
UM AND THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT IT AS AS IN ADDITION TO THEIR EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS
MM UH USE IT
I WILL GO THROUGH SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS THAT UM THE THE MANAGEMENT HAVE PLACED ON US AND UH WILL BE CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED AT THE FIRST MEETING
THE MA THE MANAGEMENT HAS HAD IT'S OWN THOUGHTS ON THIS AND UH THE THEY DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH WITH WHAT WE UH WE THOUGHT
UM AND AND THEN WE'LL AS A RESULT OF THAT WE WILL THEN TALK THROUGH THE THE FUNCTIONS THAT WE SEE THE THE DEVICE UM ACTUALLY B CARRYING OUT
AND WE HAVE UH FORTY MINUTES TO DO THIS IN AND I UH
THE N THE NEW REQUIREMENTS ARE UM THE THE MANAGEMENT TEAM SEE THAT UM TELETEXT IS NO LONGER OF ANY IMPORTANCE GIVEN THE UH THE RISE OF THE INTERNET
UM AND AND THEY WANT IT ONLY TO COVER TELEVISIONS
WHAT IS NOT Q QUITE CLEAR FROM THEIR DIRECTIVE IS WHETHER THEY MEAN TH THEY DON'T WANT IT TO COVER TELETEXT OR WHETHER THEY DON'T WANT IT TO COVER
VIDEOS D. V. D. S UM SATELLITE BOXES WHICH UH I MEAN WE SAW AS BEING FUNDAMENTAL TO THE UH TO THE EXERCISE
UM BUT POSSIBLY UH KEEP AT THE BACKS OF OUR MINDS THAT THE REALITY THAT PEOPLE EVEN WHEN THEY UH NO LONGER THEY DON'T LOOK AT TELETEXT ANYMORE
UM THE THE LOGO UH BEING AT B THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN THERE THE THE THE TWO R. S IN GREY AGAINST UH A YELLOW BACKGROUND
UM NOW THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME OF OUR IDEAS ABOUT MAKING IT ATTRACTIVE TO THE T TO THE MARKET
BUT UH DO DO INTRODUCE SOME SOME CONSTRAINTS AS TO HOW WE MIGHT DO THAT
UM IT ALSO HAS TO BE SIMPLE WHICH TO SOME EXTENT GOES ALONG W WITH THE FIRST ONE
UM BUT THEY ALSO WANT IT TO BE SIMPLE TO GET IT TO THE MARKET QUICKLY WHICH UM
MM UH IS IS IS THEIR CHOICE BUT UH UM WE WE NEED TO TALK THAT THROUGH
UM NOTES SENT OUT AND UH ETCETERA
UM AGAIN I THERE IS NO ORDER OF PRECEDENCE HERE UM SO I I I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU TO WHO WHO WHO THINKS THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO GO FIRST
OH IF YOU CLICK ON THE UM UH THE ONE THAT THAT LOOKS LIKE A PROJECTION SCREEN NO THE ONE TO THE RIGHT OF THAT
YEAH I MUST SAY THAT UM THE UH I C CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT UM F YOU KNOW PHONE SERVICE I WAS USING THE OTHER DAY
BUT THAT HAD SORTA SPEECH RECOGNITION WHICH WORKED UH REMARKABLY WELL SO THAT IS INDEED A UH
A THOUGHT AND IT IT CUTS OUT UH
SHOULD WE ACTUALLY BITE THE BULLET HERE
IF PEOPLE REALLY DON'T USE THOSE BUTTONS TO ANY EXTENT AT ALL UM REMOVE THEM ALTOGETHER
UM NOW THE THE AGE STRUCTURE WE WERE LOOKING AT UM I MEAN W WE HAD USAGE BY AGE STRUCTURE
WHAT WE DIDN'T HAVE WAS WHAT PROPORTION OF PEOPLE USING REMOTES WERE IN THOSE PARTICULAR AGE GROUPS
FORTY NO SORRY FOR FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE AGE GROUP UH TO PUT MYSELF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT UM WELL AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW THE RELATIVE PROPORTION THE RELATIVE NUMBERS IN THE AGE GROUPS
DIFFERENT TRULY DIFFERENT THEN THE BUTTONLESS REMOTE CONTROL W WOULD BE IT
I. T. V. AND YOU'RE WATCHING B. B. C. THEN THEN IT MIGHT UM CHANGE ITSELF SO IT PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE UM POSSIBLY ACTUALLY NEED A BUTTON ON IT
OR OR SOMETHING JUST TO IDENTIFY THAT YOU'VE LIFTED IT UP AND IT'S USE
AND AND THEN JUST SAY OH I DON'T KNOW A THOUGHT AND AND THEN UH I MEAN THAT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE UH TRULY DIFFERENT
VOL VOLUME YES UM TH W WE NEED TO S IDENTIFY THINGS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY NEED AND AND IT'S A FUNCTION OF FREQUENCY AND RELEVANCE
UM THE CHANNEL AND VOLUME AND TH W W GIVEN GIVEN THAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO IGNORE TELETEXT
UH CHANNEL AND VOLUME ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT
AND UH I DUNNO BUTTONS OR OR BUTTONS AS AN OPTION
PRINT ACTUALLY PRINT IT ON THE UH
S TH THIS I TH THAT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A PROBLEM I THINK
UM AND I I I S SO I SUPPOSE ONE UM
S S WE COULD WE COULD MAKE IT DUAL FUNCTION VOICE RECOGNITION AND STILL HAVE BUTTONS ON IT UM 'CAUSE WE'RE
THE I MEAN THE THE ADVANTAGE OF DOING AWAY THE BUTTONS ALTOGETHER IS IT MAKES THE THING CHEAPER
AH THERE WE GO
YES RATHER THAN THE UH THE THE TRADITIONAL IN FACT UM I WON'T EVEN GO THAT FAR
UM THAT YOU YOU SORT OF HOLD IN YOUR HAND UM WELL I'M TRYING TO THINK
UM YOU KNOW COMPROMISE THE OUR OUR NEED FOR UH YOU KNOW IT IT BEING
UH WHETHER WHETHER DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY UM I MEAN TH ALL ALL THESE REMOTES ARE PRESUMABLY INFRARED AND LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME
UH WE WE POSSIBLY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT AT AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT UM YOU KNOW SHORT RANGE
BUT UH UH I THINK BASICALLY I IF WE'RE GOING FOR I IF MINIMUM NUMBER OF BUTTONS IS OUR PRIORITY THEN WE SHOULD AS I SAY
R KNOW REALLY BITE THE BULLETS AND AND REDUCE THE BUTTONS TO ABSOLUTE MINIMUM YOU KNOW POSSIBLY WITH BACKUP CHANNEL AND VOLUME BUTTONS AND ON OFF
UH IT SEEMS SEEMS TO ME THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS TO MAKE BEFORE WE UM I THINK YOUR POINT ABOUT THE THE BIG ENERGY SOURCE IS UH A VERY VALID ONE
YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU BUY THESE DAYS WHICH YOU KNOW HAVE A A A LITHIUM WHATEVER BATTERY IN
UM PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE THE THE DISPOSABLE REMOTE CONTROL UH UM YOU KNOW ONE SOME SORT OF TYPICAL USAGE
YOU KNOW THE THE THE BATTERY WILL LAST
UH SO I TH THINK YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF A RECHARGEABLE ONE IS UM
UH UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY HIGH TECH AND IT SORT OF JUST RECHARGES ITSELF IF IT'S N BY YOU KNOW MAGNETIC WAVES OR WHATEVER IF IF IT
ARE ARE PEOPLE REALLY GONNA USE IT THOUGH
IT'S UM I MEAN I KNOW THAT SOMEI TIMES MY MY WIFE GOES OUT IN THE MORNING AND SAYS OH I SHOULD HAVE PUT THE PHONE ON TO CHARGE AND THEN THEN SHE'S HAD THOSE FOR SO LONG THAT IF SHE HASN'T WORKED THAT OUT BY NOW
YEAH YEAH YEAH SO UH UM WHAT SO WH WHAT WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THE UM THE THE PERMANENT MM BATTERY
IS THE UH YOU KNOW WE WE WE ARE REALLY GOING FOR THE ULTIMATE IN EX UH EXTERNAL SIMPLICITY HERE
YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE A HIGH TECH INTERIOR THEN THEN THAT THAT SH MAY WELL BE COST EFFECTIVE
UM I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING OFF THE S TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY THINGS THAT YOU BUY
SOM WELL SOME DO I MEAN TH TH BUT THERE ARE BATTERY ONES THAT UM ARE YOU KNOW SORT OF PERMANENTLY SEALED
YEAH I I MEAN TH TH THIS NEEDS GOING T INTO THE TECHNOLOGY A BIT
I WOULD THINK IS
I IS IS PROBABLY YOU KNOW NO MORE THAN MINUTES IN ITS ENTIRE LIFE
IF BUT I SAY IF IF PEOPLE ARE GETTING R. S. I. FROM IT THEN UH THEN UH THEN THEN PERHAPS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WRONG MARKET N
OH I MUST ADMIT I HADN'T UM I'D I'D MISSED THAT
AND AND I I DON'T I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER THE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER THE S THE SIGNAL LASTS AS LONG AS YOU ACTUALLY KEEP THE BUTTON PRESSED
POSSIBLY NO BUTTONS AT ALL UM BUT IF YOU CAN INCORPORATE UM
BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHAPE IS NO LONGER AN
BUT WE CLEARLY ONLY NEED TH THE MAIN BUTTONS ALTHOUGH UH IF CLEARLY ONLY NEED THE MAIN FUNCTIONS
UM I DON'T SEE WHY WE SHOULDN'T GO FOR VOICE RECOGNITION UM AND THE THE ONLY BUTTONS THAT I THINK WE NEED ARE CHANNEL CONTROL
UM UH D SO DOES THAT ACCURATELY SUMMARISE WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED
OH YEAH WELL TH THAT'S ONE I S THAT'S ONE I SENT YOU
THAT'S THAT THAT THAT THAT'S THEIR UH THEIR VIEW
OKAY SO UH WE CAN ALL GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO THAT UH FOR FOR THE NEXT MEETING THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
WELL THESE ARE FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS FROM THE OUR OUR GUYS DOWN IN THE THE RESEARCH LAB
TOOK HUNDRED PEOPLE AND COVERED ALL THE ASPECTS OF WHAT UM IS NEEDED BY PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE
UM EVERYTHING KINDA FROM FUNCTIONALITY AND HOW INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONS ARE HOW MU HOW HOW OFTEN THEY'RE USED AND HOW MUCH THEIR NECESSARY AND STUFF
SEE THAT AS WE KINDA NOTICED SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE FIND THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
I CAN EMPL I KINDA TAKE THAT TO MEAN AS UM
THEY ONLY USE THEY ONLY WORK FOR THE TELEVISION OR YEAH LIKE AS IN IN MY FLAT I'VE GOT SIX REMOTE CONTROLS FOR A STEREO SYSTEM
IF IT WAS UH I MEAN TH MY BEHAVIOUR IS TO USE MULTIPLE THINGS AT THE SAME TIME AND MULTIPLE REMOTES AREN'T REALLY MATCHED WELL TO MY BEHAVIOUR
I TOOK TO MEAN THAT THEY JUST THEY USE IT A LOT THEY USE IT REGULARLY RATHER THAN STANDING UP AND
BUT UH OH AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE UH ON THE UH THAT SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS LIKE AUDIO SETTINGS AREN'T H HARDLY EVER USED AND USED VERY AREN'T CONSIDERED RELEVANT BY THE USER
I DUNNO MAYBE SOME KIND OF SYSTEM OF YOU PRESS A BUTTON ON THE T. V. OR MAYBE THAT'S B IT WOULD HAVE TO INCORPORATE
BUT LIKE SOME KIND OF SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN F USE SOMETHING ELSE TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND UM YEP THE UH TIME TAKEN TO LEARN NEW REMOTE CONTROLS IS
AND UH REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD MAKE IT MORE COMFORTABLE AND MAKE MA POSSIBLY EVEN USE HAVE TO MAKE IT
MAYBE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HOLD IT AS SUCH
IT ALSO ASKED UM IF WE WOULD IF PEOPLE WOULD PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION AND YOUNGER PEOPLE SAY THEY WOULD
AND UH THERE WAS ANOTHER SECTION ON OUR ON THE REPORT FOR UH L. C. D. DISPLAYS BUT THE DATA WASN'T THERE SO
YEAH UM OH YEAH SO POSSIBLY THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS POSSIBLY SOMETHING COULD ADD INTO THE DESIGN
OH I'VE GOT SOME OTHER THINGS I COULDN'T FIT ONTO THIS PRESENTATION
YOU SEE THIS OKAY
I'LL READ OUT TO YOU
USING THE USING THE D SWI THE POWER SWITCH TO SWITCH ON T. V. IS A HIGH RELEVANCE OF NINE BUT IT'S NOT FREQUENTLY USED
SO M WE CAN MAYBE EVEN START TO CUT DOWN ON OR I WAS POSSIBLY EVEN THINKING OF A DESIGN THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE BUTTONS ARE HIDDEN FROM EVERYDAY USE
YEAH LIKE THE ONE THAT LIKE SLIDES BACK AND THE BUTTONS ARE CONCEALED UNDERNEATH
UH YEAH
UM NO THIS IS FOR PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
OR EVEN I MEAN YOU COULD EVEN JUST HAVE IT LEFT ON
'CAUSE I'VE SEEN I'VE SEEN THIS USED ON COMPUTERS BEFORE WHERE YOU JUST YOU ADDRESS THE REMOTE YOU ADDRESS THE COMPUTER AND THEN GIVE IT A COMMAND
OH I SEE
I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING OF THE POINT OF VIEW OF PEOP YOU COULD STILL LIKE LOSE THIS REMOTE
WE COULD MAKE THINGS MUCH MORE F I THINK THE THE EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WOULD SPEND MORE ON UH A REMOTE UH THAT LOOKS BETTER
COMBINED WITH UH DECREASE THE OR TAKE OUT THE LIMITED FUNCTIO FUNCTIONS THAT WE DON'T REALLY USE MUCH
ALRIGHT TAKE OUT TELETEXT BUT AS FOR CHANNEL SETTINGS AND STUFF IT MIGHT IT MIGHT UM TURN PEOPLE SOMEWHE PEOP SOME PEOPLE THAT WANT THE WHOLE FUNCTIONALITY AWAY
OH WE COULD YEAH
WE COULD EVEN HAVE IT AS LIKE A YEAH THE BUTTONS CONTROL THIS AND THE VOICE FUNCTIONS CONTROL THE F THINGS THAT YOU WOULD DO ALL THE TIME
UH YEAH YEAH THAT'S EVERYTHING
IT COULD HAVE LIKE UH KNOW LIKE A CORDLESS PHONE IN YOUR HOUSE IT S GOT LIKE A BASE THAT SITS THERE ALL THE TIME
UH
W LIKE LIKE THIS UM THIS UH MARKET RESEARCH THING SAYS NUMBER OF TIMES PER HOUR THAT IT'S USED CHANNEL SELECTION A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT
BUT THEN AGAIN IF YOU THINK IT OF THE AMOUNT OF YOU KNOW AMOUNT OF USE IT'S LIKE
UM P THERE WE GO
UH BASICALLY THEY WAIT FOR YOU TO PRESS A KEY OR GIVE A VOICE COMMAND AND THEN THIS IS TRANSLATED UH INTO UH LIGHT SIGNALS WHICH ARE THEN SEEN BY THE T. V.
UH THE MATERIALS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO LOOK AT UH THE TWO BIG ONES ARE THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIP AND THE BATTERY AND THE IN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIP UH WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A A DIODE TRANSISTOR OR RESONATOR
THIS SIGNAL'S SENT TO THE TRANSISTOR WHICH AMPLIFIES IT AND THEN SENDS IT ON TO THE LIGHT EMITTING DIODE AND UH WHICH IS THEN TRAI CHANGED INTO A INFRARED LIGHT WHICH IS SENT TO THE T. V. AND SORT OF SEEN BY THE T. V. AND WHICH UH CHANGES THE CHANNELS
UH COOL
UH SO AS FOR HOW WE SHOULD END UP UH USING THIS IN OUR REMOTE UH T COUPLE OF MAIN QUESTIONS ARE THE BUTTONS
UH Y THE FEWER BUTTONS YOU HAVE I GUESS THE FEWER INTERNAL CONNECTIONS AND INTERNAL CODES YOU'RE GONNA NEED
HOWEVER UH TO N NOT HAVE BUTTONS OR TO USE A VOICE COMMANDS INSTEAD OF BUTTONS MIGHT MAKE THESE CONNECTIONS MORE DIFFICULT AND UH RAISE THE PRODUCTION COST
UM ALSO WITH BATTERY CONNECTIONS THE COMPANY HAS SOME LIMITS ON THE BATTERIES WE CAN USE
SO I WAS THINKING PERHAPS A COMBINATION OF SOLAR CELLS WITH A BACK UP BASIC BATTERY AND SOMEHOW BETWEEN THE COMBINATION OF THAT TWO WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT UH WILL LAST THE THE LIFETIME OR THE FIVE TO TEN YEARS AND WE COULD STILL KEEP THAT ORIGINAL IDEA
OH YEP SORRY
UM I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY PRICE INFORMATION NO
UM IT A LOT LONGER THAN AN OFF THE SHELF CHIP
OH W YEAH WE DID THE THE PROBLEM IS THE THE THE VOICE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT REALLY HIGHLY DEVELOPED
UH SO IT WOULD UH IT'S HARD TO PREDICT THE TIME
W JUST TO TO INCORPORATE THE VOICE ACTIVATION IN IT IS IS SORTA THE TRICK
ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE VOICE CHIP IN THERE THEN IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE THE WORLD THE THE SKY IS YOUR LIMIT
BUT TO ACTUALLY THE THE BIG STEP IS TO ACTUALLY GET THE VOICE ACTIVATION CHIPS IN THERE AND WORKING
SO I TH I THINK IN IN OUR IN OUR MINDS IT'S IT'S FUNDAMENTAL
YEAH I I WOULD SAY WE DO YEAH
UH
YE YEAH 'CAUSE I'VE DEFINITELY PICKED UP REMOTES AND LIKE MEANT TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL AND TURN THE VOLUME
WELL THAT CAN KINDA TIE INTO OUR CHANGING UH FACE THINGS
MM YEAH THAT WEIRD I DUNNO WHAT THAT IS BUT YEAH
UH YEAH IT'S GOOD AS WELL
I THINK IT'S EASIER SOMETIMES TO HAVE THEM BUY CHANGEABLE COVERS FOR IT THAN TO BUY A WHOLE NEW ONE
UH YEAH
I DUNNO THAT WE SHOULD MAKE THE WHOLE THING YELLOW I KINDA THOUGHT WITH A YOU'D HAVE LIKE A YELLOW CIRCLE WITH THE R. R. IN IT SOMEWHERE ON IT
BUT I'D YELLOW SEEMS A BIT OF A STRONG COLOUR TO MAKE THE ENT LIKE THE THING NO
BUT I MEAN JUST LIKE WHITE OR GREY OR BLACK OR SOME SORT OF BLAH COLOUR
LIKE YOU COULD GET THE ABOUT THE WIDTH OF THAT END OF THE PEN AND THEN IT WIDENS UP TOP AND YOU CAN FIDDLE AN YEAH
I MEAN UH IF THE POWER BUTTON WAS ALSO SOMEHOW LIKE A MENU BUTTON YOU COULD PRESS THAT AND OR DO VOICE COMMANDS
AND EITHER VOLUME THING COULD ALSO BE TO SCROLL THROUGH OTHER OPTIONS LIKE Y AND YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH BRIGHTNESS AND AND SC AND THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN MINIMISE THE BUTTONS AND STILL HAVE THOSE
BUT THE TELEVISION WOULD BE THE DISPLAY THAT THINGS LIKE THAT USUALLY C POP UP ON A TELEVI LIKE YOU HIT MENU AND MENU WILL COME UP ON TELEVISION AND HAVE LIKE TINT BRIGHTNESS
MM OKA YEAH
NINE CHANNELS AND THEN JUST USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO SAY CHANNEL ONE AND THEN YOU'VE PROGRAMMED IN SAY B. B. C. FOUR AS YOUR CHANNEL ONE
AS YOUR FAVOURITE IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FAVOURITES UM AND THAT W
WELL ANOTHER THOUGHT I OH SORRY GO AHEAD
WELL I KINDA THINK IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PART OF IT THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE IT FOR THE WHOLE THING
AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT THE WHOLE TIME
IS IT GONNA WORK
OKAY SO I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND UM WHAT YOU KNOW THE INTERF USER INTERFACE ARE JUST ASPECTS THAT ARE SEEN BY USERS
SO A LOT OF TIMES THEY TEND TO LOOK CLUTTERED AND THESE WERE JUST A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF UM DIFFERENT KINDS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE UNUSUAL
UM DIFFERENT DESIGNS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT N WE NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR IS A V. IN VOLUME BECAUSE PEOPLE SOME
AVOID TOO MANY BUTTONS AND ALSO UM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE USED IS A SLIDE BUTTON LIKE YOU HAVE ON A MOUSE
THAT POSSIBLY WE COULD USE THAT ON THE SIDES FOR VOLUME FOR EXAMPLE HAVE THE SLIDE BUTTON ON THE SIDE
JUST BECAUSE I N FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M USING A MOUSE I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SLIDE IT UP AND DOWN SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR VOLUME TO JUST BE ABLE TO KIND OF ROLL IT AND THEN HAVE THE UP AND DOWN AND THEN THE THIS IS MY GREAT LITTLE DRAWING
THE ONLY ADVANTAGE I WAS THINKING OF TO HAVING THE BUTTONS LIKE THE BUTTONS ON ONE SIDE FOR THE CHANNEL
IT'S EASY TO N S KNOW OKAY THIS IS JUST THE VOLUME AND THIS IS THE CHANNEL
I'M JUST GONNA PASS THIS ALONG
YEAH LIKE THE KIND YOU GET ON LIKE HAND WEIGHTS
WH
JUST THIS AS EXAMPLES
SO F
YEAH LIKE AN
WELL N
WHEN THEY HOLD IT IT'S BECAUSE A MOUSE IS PRETTY COMFORTABLE TO HOLD IN YOUR HAND UM MAYBE WE COULD MAKE IT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SHAPE SO THEY COULD HOLD ON TO IT
SO HAVE FOUR BUTTONS AND THE VOLUME INSTEAD OF THREE BUTTONS AND THE VOLUME
YEAH THAT'S ON THE T. V. YEAH
YEAH AND THEN Y
YEAH PRESS THAT IS T YEAH THAT MIGHT WORK
YEAH AND YOU COULD JUST CLICK THAT TO SO IF YOU HAD LIKE THE MENU THEN YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH AND THEN CLICK IT TO SELECT
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
YEAH AND ESPECIALLY FOR MAKING THEM SO LIKE DIFFERENT AND
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THIS THIRD MEETING OF THE UH UH DESIGN GROUP
UM THAT WE'RE WE SHOULD LOOK AT SPEECH RECOGNITION RATHER THAN R RATHER THAN BUTTONS
AND THAT IF WE HAVE ANY BUTTONS THEY SHOULD BE VERY FEW OF THEM AND ONLY FOR THOSE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED THAT THAT PEOPLE USE
THAT UM WE WANT TO GO FOR UH A LONG LASTING BATTERY THAT WE GUA WE GUARANTEE FOR THE LIFE OF THE UH UH THE PRODUCT AND A SHAPE THAT WILL BE INSTANTLY RECOGNISABLE
A. UM AS UH A TRENDY REMOTE CONTROL AND AND B. AS UH A REAL REACTION PRODUCT
SO THAT W UH WHEN PEOPLE ARE UH HAPPY WITH THAT THEY WILL THEY WILL WANT TO BUY UH EVERYTHING ELSE FROM US
UH
I'LL WE'LL HAVE THE THREE THREE PRESENTATIONS FROM THE THE THE THREE OF YOU AND THEN UH WE'LL WE'LL MAKE A A FINAL A FINAL UH DECISION
ARE UM WHAT ENERGY SOURCE WE WANT TO USE WHETHER I IT IS PRACTICAL TO USE UH UM
THEN BASICALLY IT'S UH SEALED FOR LIFE AND UH IF ANYBODY DOES MANAGE TO RUN ONE DOWN WE'LL WE'LL GIVE THEM ANOTHER ONE
AND UH IT IT'LL BE UH YOU KNOW PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED AS PART OF THE TH THE ADVERTISING LITERATURE THAT IT'S UM UM
UM NOW THE THE THE INTERNAL CHIP UM AND UH THIS IS WHERE I NEED UH UH KATE'S EXPERT ADVICE AND GIVEN THAT TH THIS HAS TO TO GO TO MARKET AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE UM D D DO WE GO FOR A CUSTOM DESIGNED CHIP
OR OR DO WE BUY ONE OFF THE SHELF AND AND PROGRAMME IT OURSELVES
N NOT AN EXPERT ON THESE THINGS BUT PRESUMABLY THERE MUST BE LOADS OF 'EM ALREADY ON THE MARKET THAT WE CAN MODIFY
WE WE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS LAST TIME AS AS TO UH HOW WE MIGHT GO FORWARD AND WE'LL WE'LL FINALISE THOSE
UM AND THI THIS IS ALL LINKED IN WITH THE THE THE USER INTERFACE WHETHER WE P UM
UH
AND THEN UH YOU KNOW F FOR THE NEXT MEETING KATE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE THE THE S THE LOOK
HO HOW THE THE USER ACTUALLY USES IT AND AND ANDREW OF COURSE THE THE PRODUCT EVALUATION
UH SO IF IF WE CAN HAVE THE THE THREE PRESENTATIONS AGAIN PLEASE AND UH UM P PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO START UH K
OH I'M SORRY OH SORRY
AND AND DO WE KNOW HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE TO UH DEVELOP A A CUSTOM CHIP
UH GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WANTS THIS ON THE MARKET QUICKLY AND CHEAPLY
H HAVE ANY HAVE ANYTI HA ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT
CAUSE UH I MUST SAY I FIND IT SLIGHTLY SURPRISING GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW MOBILE PHONES INCORPORATE VOICE ACTIVATED DIALLING
SO UH BU I MEAN THE THIS THIS INFORMATION IS FROM IS THIS IS THE INTERNAL COMPANY INFORMATION IS IT
IT'S LIKE IT'S IT'S YOU CAN'T 'CAUSE MOBILE PHONES ARE EXPENSIVE YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S THE VOICE RECOGNITION BIT THAT IS
I SU I I MEAN IF GIVEN THAT THE UM THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT WELL DEVELOPED AND AND GIVEN THAT IT'S IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE
UM TH TH THE DOUBLE RISK
I MEAN DO W DO WE THINK THAT THE VOICE TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE PROJECT
I IT WILL HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION UM UH IF IF THAT MEANS UH IF THAT MEANS WE CAN'T AFFORD BUTTONS BUT I MEAN B B SECOND QUESTION
SHALL WE MOVE RAPIDLY ON TO UH KENDRA
I MEAN I THINK THE REASON EVERYBODY USES PUSHBUTTONS IS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE SI SIMPLE CHEAP AND RELIABLE
SO THREE THREE THERE'S THREE BUTTONS ON A SLIDER
OR YEAH UH TH TH THE I MEAN THI THIS IS WHAT THE WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH IS THE THE ACTUAL SHAPE THAT PEOPLE CAN INS INSTANTLY PICK IT UP AND AND KNOW KNOW UH KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO
OF ONE SORT
IT YEAH I MEAN IT IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT UH IT UH IT AL ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT IT IT THE TWO ARE CLEARLY DIFFERENT
RIGHT SO UH THAT'S SORRY IS THAT THAT ALL YOU WANT TO SAY AT THE MO OKAY FINE
WELL I I MEAN I TH I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING OUGHT TO ADDRESS ALL THREE OF THOSE
UH
UH
I I MEAN IT ITS UH I THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA IT'S LIKE THE OLD SWATCH WATCH WHERE UH UM ON ONLY BATTERIES EVER GOT CHANGED IN THOSE
'CAUSE PEOPLE JUST BOUGHT A NEW ONE WHEN IT WENT OUT OF FASHION BUT IT'S JUST NEVER BEEN SEEN AS A A FASHION ITEM BEFORE
W I MEAN WE WE CAN UH UH B BUT I MEAN MY FEELING IS THAT CURRENT POWER SOURCES ARE SUCH THAT FOR RELATIVELY LITTLE COST YOU CAN MAKE IT LAST
S
I N I KNOW THE ONLY P I MEAN THE THE THE THE IMMEDIATE THING THAT COMES TO MIND WITH THAT IS THAT IT IT IT Y YOU'VE THEN GOT THE CONNECTION AND YOU'VE IMMEDIATELY GOT A SORT OF UNRELIABILITY
COMPLETELY SOLDERED TOGETHER AND IT IT IT YOU KNOW TOTAL RELIABILITY BUT I MEAN I D I I UH
I TH I S I THINK IF WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN THAT ROUTE THEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UH EVEN IF IT COSTS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THAT
UM JUST BUILDING THE WHOLE THING IN ONE THEN HAVING GETTING CHEAPER PRODUCTION COSTS UM AND
THE ADVANTAGE OF A REPLACEABLE COVER IS THAT EVEN IF THEY DON'T IT DOESN'T HAVE A COVER ON AT ALL IT WILL STILL WORK UM TOTALLY
I MEAN THEY THEY MIGHT BE WELL INCLINED TO GO OUT AND SPEND HOWEVER MANY EUROS ON A ON A NEW ONE UM RATHER THAN A A COMPLETE NEW RE REMOTE
YEAH I MEAN IT IS IT'S UP TO IT'S UP TO
YEAH IT'S IT'S UP TO OUR MARKETING PEOPLE TO TO MA TO MA TURN IT INTO A A FASHION ITEM
UM AND YOU KNOW AS AS EXTERNAL FASHIONS CHANGE THEN WE GET NEW NEW COVERS ON THE MARKET AND YOU KNOW READILY AVAILABLE
SO UH I SO UH OKAY
IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE PROMINENT DIS DISPLAYED ON THEIR UM COFFEE TABLE TO SAY THIS SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT ME
AND YOU KNOW TH THE THE DESIGN THAT I'VE GOT AND AND IT COULD BE A A HOME MADE DESIGN
SO I MEAN THE THE THE BASIC SHAPE I IS IS WHAT WE UH I MEAN GIVEN THAT WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW ONE ONE ON OFF BUTTON PRESUMABLY
TWO BUTTONS FOR UH CHANNEL CHANGE AND ONE SLIDER AND BASICALLY NOTHING ELSE UM W WE NEED TO DECIDE ON THE JUST THE BASIC SHAPE OF THE THING
YOU KNOW CURVED LOOK YOU KNOW T TO DELIBERATELY GET AWAY FROM THE UH UM UH YOU KNOW
MM OR UH 'CAUSE THERE'S CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THE THE CORPORATE LOGO NEEDS TO BE PROMINENTLY UH DISPLAYED SO THAT PEOPLE S TH LOOKED AT IT AND SAY RIGHT
THAT'S A REAL REACTION REMOTE CONTROL I WANT ONE OF THOSE
UH NO I D I I AGREE I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SIMPLY IT'S SIMPLY REQUIRED TO INCORPORATE THE THE THE THE CORPORATE LOGO PROMINENTLY UM
OH NO THAT WELL THERE'S THE SIM MY MY IDEA WAS SOMETHING A B PROBABLY YOU KNOW A BIT FATTER THAN THIS BUT SORT OF THA THAT SORTA SHAPE SO THAT YOU CAN JUST SORT OF HO HOLD IT
I THINK WE D I THINK WE DECIDED THAT W WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING DOWN BOTH ROUTES
THAT UM THE WE N WE NEED THE THE MANUAL CONTROLS AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE OF THAT FORM BUT THAT UH YEAH
THEN YOU JUST BRING IT UP TO YOUR MOUTH AND JUST SPEAK TO IT YEAH YEAH
I TH I TH HONEST UH MY PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT IF IT'S NOT THERE PEOPLE WOULDN'T USE IT ANYWAY UM
IT'S CER IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE I MEAN
BUT THEY WE WE'RE GOING BEYOND W W GIVEN THE STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY WE WANT SOMETHING THAT WE KNO WE KNOW WILL WILL WORK UM
UH
WE ACTUALLY USE THE TELEVISION OKAY
OKAY WE GOT FIVE MINUTES TO GO IN THIS MEETING
SO UM I D I THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY VERY CONVENIENTLY JUST UH COME TO UH A GOOD POINT TO S TO SUM UP UM
WHATEVER IT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC
BUT THAT'S A SLIGHTLY INAPPROPRIATE WORD UM TO SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WE CAN SEE AND UM ANDREW N CAN GO AWAY AND TH TH THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN UH ACTUALLY MARKET THIS AS A CONCEPT AND NOT J NOT JUST A UH UM A A SIMPLE REMOTE CONTROL
I YOU KNOW ON THE BASIS THAT UM THAT YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING FOR MAKING IT A FASHION STATEMENT
THEN UH PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO CHANGE IT ANYWAY UH BEFORE I IT RUNS OUT AND UM MAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT WE WE CAN AIM FOR A BATTERY THAT WILL LAST MOST PEOPLE FOR UH WE'LL SAY AT LEAST FIVE FIVE TEN YEARS AND THAT WE'LL W WE WILL GUARANTEE IT FOR FOR FIVE YEARS UM
BUT GIVEN THAT UM TECHNOL TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS IMPORTANT THEN WE NEED TO I'LL SAY IT AGAIN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATE
THEN UH I MEAN UH UH THIS IS TOTALLY NEW
WE D WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER
THAT TO WHAT EXTENT PEOPLE DO IT OR NOT BUT IF THEY'VE AT LEAST GOT A A GOOD SELECTION OF UM COVERS THAT THEY CAN USE ANYWAY
SO THEY CAN GET THEM IN THE SUPERMARKET WHEN THEY GO DOWN TO UM A ANY OF THE FAMOUS SUPERMARKETS I WON'T MENTION ANY MENTION ANY NAMES
UM THE THAT I MEAN THAT'S NO BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SO FEW BUTTONS THAT IT THAT ACTUALLY MAKES THAT REDUNDANT
AND THE YOU KNOW THAT THAT SOLVES ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF B OF BATTERY LIFE
'CAUSE THAT WOULD WELL THAT WOULD CLOBBER THE BATTERY LIFE SO NO
AS UH AS WIDE CER CERTAINLY WIDER ANGLE THAN THAN CURRENT SO THAT IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT YOU KNOW
NOT LIKE MY MY MUM WHO POINTS IT AT THE CEILING AND WONDERS WHY THE TH TH THE TELEVISION DOESN'T WORK
THE THEY'RE REASONABLY LIKELY TO BE HOLDING IT TO USE IT THEN UH THEN THAT THAT'S THE SORT OF COVERAGE THAT WE WANT
OKAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND I'LL S SEE YOU ALL AGAIN IN THIRTY MINUTES
ALSO LOTS OF MOBILE PHONES HAVE GOT A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THEM NOT JUST THAT SO
OH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY MAYB MAYBE IT SH
UH YEAH IT'S THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT TO USERS THAT THE DEVICE SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
FROM UH MY PRESENTATION SHOW SO
WELL IF YOU G IF YOU IF YOU GOT A CHANNEL UP DOWN WE CAN HAVE A SLIDER IN THAT AS WELL
BECAUSE IF IT IF YOU NO IF YOU NOTICE ON THE THING IT IT KIND OF LIKE HAS GOT KIND OF IF YOU YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF LIKE STICKS
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN UP LIKE ONE UNIT IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
SO IT KINDA GOES UP ONE THEN Y LIKE YOU CAN KEEP ROLLING IT UP BUT IT'S LIKE LIKE LIKE LIKE A COG OR SOMETHING
SO YOU KINDA TAKE IT UP ONE AT A TIME
D
UH YOU COULD YOU COULD AS L AS LIKE A MOUSE YOU COULD
UH YEAH THIS IS MY REPORT ON TREND WATCHING
THE DATA'S COME OFF INTERNET UH FROM EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR US ON THE TOP THREE THINGS WANTED BY THE CONSUMER
THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THE L THE LOOK IT HAS TO LOOK FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
THIS IS A ST WELL I WAS GONNA SAY YEAH TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SECOND ASPECT WHICH IS THE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOV INNOVATIVE UM SIDE OF IT
I S THAT OUT OF SEQUENCE
UH YEAH SORRY
UH YEAH AND UH FROM THE FASHION WATCHERS FROM MILAN AND PARIS HAVE SAID FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE AN IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHES AND FURNITURE AND SHOES
UH SORRY CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE
A SPONGY MATERIAL TO BE USED ON THE ON THE OUTSIDE
UH F LIKE IT'S IN IF IF FASHION IF WE'RE GOING FOR THE IT LOOKS FANCY THEN FASHION IS OBVIOUSLY THE LINE WE GOTTA BE GOING THROUGH
YOU KNOW LIKE TH UH THIS BIT'S THE BIT YOU KEEP AND THIS IS THE EXPENSIVE BIT THIS IS LIKE THE CHIP AND THIS IS THE MICROPHONE
UM OH DON'T WORRY IT'S ALL SAID I WAS JUST GONNA SAY UH YEAH
ARE WE GONNA MAKE THIS AS PART OF LIKE LIKE UH A PART OF THE F LIKE IT IT THE FASHIONS APPLY TO FURNITURE
UM I'M JUST I'M SUDDENLY REALISING THAT YEAH WE'RE DISCUSSING HOW MUCH HOW GOOD IT'S GONNA BE TO CHANGE CHANNELS T WE STILL CAN JUST TELL IT TO
YEAH MAYBE WE COU LIKE W LIKE WE'RE LEAVING OUT THE BUTTONS FOR THE THE F LESS FREQUENTLY USED STUFF
MM I SUPPOSE BUT T THERE IS THE OFF CHANCE THAT YOU KNOW TH THE BRIGHTNESS IS WRONG ON YOUR T. V. OR THE CONTRAST NEEDS CHANGING
WELL I MEAN ON A ONTO LIKE A MOUSE THE RU THE SCROLLING BUTTON
IS ACTUALLY A BUTTON AS WELL YOU COULD PRESS IT YOU COULD PRESS THAT AND HAVE IT AS A MENU BUTTON
UH YEAH
UH CAN I JUST GET SOME THINGS CLEAR JUST FOR MY SAKE
OUR ENERGY SOURCE IS GONNA BE
UH
AND UH ARE WE GONNA HAVE IT IL BEING ILLUMINATED FROM INSIDE ONTO THE BUTTONS OR
ARE WE HAVING IT THAT IT'S ANY ANGLE OR IS IT JUST
AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE
UH OKAY WE BASICALLY HAVE THE SAME KINDA LAY OUT HERE IT'S JUST UM YOU HOLD IT LIKE THIS AND IT GETS KINDA MOULDED TO THE TO THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND
UM ON THE LEFT WE'VE GOT THE SCROLL FOR THE VOLUME
ON THE RIGHT WE HAVE BUTTONS FOR THE CHANNELS UP AND DOWN AND THAT KINDA SO YOU CAN HOLD IT AND SCROLL
UH THAT'S THE LITTLE MENU KEY
UH WE GOT A MICROPHONE THERE WHICH FOR ALL THE VOICE COMMANDS SO YOU CAN YOU KNOW TALK TO IT LIKE THAT AND IT'LL STILL UNDERSTAND
BUT IT'S ALSO E E EASIER TO PUT ON VERSUS LIKE MOBILE COVERS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO SCREW THEM ON AND STUFF AND YOU KINDA SOMETIMES HAVE TO GET SOMEONE TO DO THAT FOR YOU
WELL WE COULD BROADEN THE BROADEN IT OUT A BIT SO IT WOULD STAND LIKE THAT
YEAH WE COULD JUST WIDEN IT OUT UH
HAVE TO IF WE JUST LENGTHEN IT I GUESS SO IT COMES DOWN TO THE BASE OF THE HAND AND THEN FLATTEN IT OUT AND COULD SIT THERE
WE MIGHT HAVE TO LENGTHEN IT SO IT KINDA YOUR HAND STILL HOLDS IT AND HAVE IT THERE YEAH YEAH YEAH LIKE THAT LIKE THAT
WEE
UH
BUT UM I THINK IT SHOULD STILL APPEAL ON A CERTAIN LEVEL TO EVERYBODY YEAH
WELL DONE US
UH
S
JUST KIND OF A LIGHT NON DESCRIPT GREY SO THAT PEOPLE'LL WANNA BUY THE COVERS AND THEN THE COVERS WILL BE THAT SORT OF RUBBERY MATERIAL LIKE THEY MAKE IPOD COVERS
AND IT'LL JUST STAY ON AND THEN THE BUTTONS COME THROUGH AND SO AND THEN THE EACH ONE OF 'EM ON THE VERY END WILL HAVE THE LOGO WITH THE YELLOW CIRCLE AND THE R. R.
I MEAN I THINK WE WORKED WELL TOGETHER AND LOOKED REALLY AT WHAT THE CONSUMERS WANTED AND WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE AND YOU KNOW
WELCOME TO THE WHAT SHOULD BE THE LAST OF THESE MEETINGS AND UH IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE UH DONE A GOOD JOB HERE AND UH
UM OKAY OH THE UM
TH THE THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING UH I THINK WE'LL TAKE THOSE AS READ UM
OKAY THE UM TH THE THE NEXT UH THING WE WE WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THE UH TH HAVE A LOOK AT THE PROTOTYPES AND UH LOOK AT THE UH EVALUATION CRITERIA AND FINANCE AND THEN UH
SO F IF IF YOU'D LIKE TO UH PRESENT YOUR YOUR PROPOSALS
SHOWING ME AGE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I C IPOD COVERS ARE LIKE
I MEAN THA IT'S IT'S A DETAILED POINT I JUST WONDERED I MEAN H HOW WILL PEOPLE PUT THESE DOWN I WONDER
UH NO BECAUSE PARTICULARLY IF THEY'VE DIF IF THEY'RE GONNA HAVE IT AS A YOU KNOW AS A FASHION ITEM UH I MEAN IT IT'S UH IT IT'S JUST I MEAN IT'S JUST A MINOR DETAILED POINT
BUT UM AS YOU SAY YOU CAN JUST MAKE THE BASE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER AND UH
YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S UH BUT UH NO THE THE THE OVERALL UH THE OVERALL CONCEPT IS UH YEAH YEAH NO NO I MEAN THAT'S THESE UH
BUT UH YEAH BUT NO TH BUT THE YEAH THE THE THE
BUT TH TH BUT TH YEAH TH B THE THESE WERE ALL MINOR MINOR UH MINOR DETAILS
I THINK THE UH THE BASIC CONCEPT I I IS IS ABSOLUTELY BANG ON AND THE I IT CERTAINLY MEETS OUR CRITERIA OF BEING UH OF YOU KNOW LOOKING DIFFERENT
WE'RE GIVEN A A CLEAR DESIGN BRIEF UH
IF I GET THE UH SPREADSHEET UP
AH
GOOD THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO MAKE THESE THINGS SIMPLE SO THAT THE UH THE THE THE BOSS CAN UNDERSTAND
NOW I'VE UM THIS IS THE COMPANY'S UH UH COSTING FOR FOR VARIOUS UH UH ASPECTS OF DESIGN AND I I I'VE TREATED SOME OF THESE SLIGHTLY UH LIBERALLY GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS PLACED ON US
UM I WOULDN'T KNOW FOR IN FOR INSTANCE IF IF THEY REQUIRE US TO HAVE IT IN THE CORPORATE COLOURS
UH SO WE'RE JUST SIMPLY ON BATTERIES THE THE ONE TH THE ONE DECISION I'VE HAD TO MAKE IS THAT UM
WE'RE WE WILL HAVE TO FIND A S A REGULAR STANDARD CHIP TO TO DO THIS WITH AND I I UM I'M I'M I'M CERTAIN THAT THEY THEY ARE AROUND SO
THE UH THE THE VOICE SENSOR IS IS EXPENSIVE BUT WE WE MADE A A BASIC DECISION THAT THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL TO THE TO THE DESIGN SO THAT THAT HAS TO STAY
L TO MAKE 'CAUSE OF THE THE TH THE DOUBLE CURVES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE OF OUR OVERALL FASHION CONCEPT UM WE WE SHOULD EXCEED THE THE SALES TARGETS
UM IT'S SIMPLY MADE OF PLASTIC SO TH THAT'S UH THAT'S NO PROBLEM AND UH UM JUST BECAUSE THE WHOLE THE COLOUR OF THE THE WHOLE THING THAT'S UH UH THERE'S SOME COST THERE
WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT A SCROLL WHEEL WE WE WE GOT PUSH BUTTONS AND AND A SIMPLE UH UM
SLIDER SO UM AND THE AND THE THE BUTTONS ARE UH UH WELL I DO DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE SPECIAL COLOUR
ANYWAY THE THE COSTINGS UH COME IN AT EXACTLY ON TARGET AT TWELVE POINT FIVE UH BUT I THI I THINK WE HAVE A A VERY STRONG CASE TO ARGUE THAT UH WHAT WHAT WE'VE GOT IS IS SO IN INNOVATIVE AND UH AND DIFFERENT THAT UM ANY ANY SLIGHT COMPROMISE WE HAVE TO MAKE ON ON COST IS IS OFFSET BY THE UH YOU KNOW THE
UH YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE CONCEPT OF IT BEING A A FASHION ACCESSORY AND AND HAVING THE THE INTERCHANGEABLE COVERS SO UH UM YOU KNOW THE IF IF IF THE MANAGEMENT EXPECT US TO BE TECHNO AGAIN FAIL AGAIN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE UM THAT THEY THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT WE WE CAN'T OPERATE ABSOLUTELY WITHIN UH THE CONSTRAINTS THAT THEY GIVE
SO UH WE WE WE PRESENT THIS AS THE UH THE COMPANY'S UH THE THE COMPANY'S WAY FORWARD AND UH UH I I THINK WE CAN ARGUE THAT WE WE HAVE UH COME IN ON ON BUDGET
THE UH YEAH THE EVALUATION WHERE WHERE YOU KNOW WELL WHERE WHERE WE'RE WHERE WHERE WE'RE AT
THE THE THE WELL THE I MEANT THE PRODUCT
MORE LOUD CLICKS IN THE MICROPHONE
SEVEN BEING A NICE ROUND NUMBER TO WORK TO
TR
ON FOR TRUE AND SEVEN FOR FLASE
I DON'T SEE WE COULD'VE MADE IT ANY EASIER
FOUND EASILY
SO YEAH UM UM
I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE I MEAN UH OLD OLDER PEOPLE WHO CAN'T MANAGE THE BUTTONS ANYWAY WILL ACTUALLY PROBABLY LIKE THE LIKE LIKE THE VOICE BIT SO
IN IN IN IN MY INTERPRETATION OF MANAGEMENT'S INSTRUCTIONS UH IS THAT YES IT IT MEETS THE REQUIREMENT IS T IT'S TELEVISION ONLY IT'S IT'S SIMPLE TO USE
UM IT'S IT'S IT'S WITHIN BUDGET UM I IT'S UH YES AN AN ANY MINOR POINTS WE WE WE ARGUE
NEED A NEED A CALCULATOR FOR THAT
OOH
EITHER OF YOU WANT TO UH SAY ANYTHING
I MEAN I THINK WE'VE ALLOWED OURSELVES UH AS MUCH CREATIVITY AS THE UH THE THE THE PRODUCT UH ALLOWS
IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED
A KINDA A NATURAL KIND OF A IDEA WHERE IT'S LIKE MORE OF A KIND OF LIKE A KINDA MAYBE SLIGHTLY LIKE THINNER
UH YEAH JUST CLICK THERE
SURE UH CAN I GET THE
THERE WE GO OH
METHOD OF EVALUATION TESTING THE PRODUCT WAS TO JUST IF IT MET ALL THE CRITERIA ALL THE CONDITIONS THAT WE SET OUT TO
SET OUT TO SOLVE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE THE CONSUMER AND THE MANAGEMENT
WHAT I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO IS ON THE WHITEBOARD
SO ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN ONE BEING TRUE AND SEVEN BEING BEING FALSE
AND THEN AT THE END JUST TAKE AN AVERAGE
IS THE DEVICE F FLASHY AND FASHIONABLE
UH IS IT COMPLICATED
DOING PRETTY WELL SO FAR AREN'T WE
UM WILL DEVICE APPEAL TO ALL AGE GROUPS
UH YEAH AND WHAT H DID WE MAKE THE MANAGEMENT'S
ELEVEN DIVIDED BY ELEVEN'S ONE SO EQUALS AVERAGE OF ONE
UH YEAH
OH IT'S NOT LIKING US IT WENT THAT A WAY
UH
UH OKAY
AS YOU CAN SEE OUR AGENDA IS TO OPEN UP THE MEETING UM BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER
UM HAVE A LITTLE TRAINING ON TOOLS UH CREATE A PLAN DISCUSS THINGS AND AND WE ONLY HAVE TWENTY MINUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TOTAL
UM THE TRENDINESS WE'LL PROBABLY GO LOOK AT FOR SOME MARKETING RESEARCH INFORMATION FROM YOU SARAH
UM AND WE'LL GET ON WITH IT
OKAY SO WE'LL HAVE A FUNCTIONAL DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK UM WITH MEETING AND THEN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN T AND THEN DETAILED DESIGN
EVERYBODY'S SUPPOSED TO TRY OUT THE WHITEBOARD
KATE WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT FIRST IF YOU CAN EITHER BRING YOUR THINGS WITH YOU I GUESS
AND WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT WE'LL TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOOK THESE THINGS ON AS WELL 'CAUSE WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WALK AROUND
UH I DO NOT THINK SO I THINK IT'S JUST TO TRY OUT THE WHITEBOARD
AH
I THINK IT'S TO GET US USED TO USING THE PEN
UH NO
OH A FISH
BUT I'M AFRAID I TAKE THE COWARD'S WAY OUT AND THE CAT'S LOOKING THE OTHER WAY
THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT HOW MANY UM WE HAVE TO SELL ON AN INTERNATIONAL SCALE
UM WOULD BE AN AWFUL LOT OF THESE WOULD BE LIKE WHAT
UM THE PRODUCTION IS TO ONLY COST TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS PER ITEM
UM AND WE'RE TO MAKE A PROFIT OF FIFTY MILLION THAT'S T UH CAN YOU DO THE MATHS AND HOW MANY ARE WE SELLING
YES 'CAUSE OUR MARKET UM IS INTERNATIONAL AND YOUR PROBLEM IS HAS TO DO WITH MARKETING OF YOU KNOW
TWO FOUR
I'VE SEEN SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE FOR MORE THAN ONE DEVICE AT A TIME
BUT I ALSO HAVE HEARD ABOUT THEM NOT WORKING WELL OR NOT WELL CO ORDINATED AND YOU WIND UP WORKING WITH THIS ONE FOR THI THIS THREE AND THEN THIS ONE OVER HERE FOR ANOTHER
WHAT WOULD IT BE FOR AND WHAT GROUP WOULD BE BE FOR
I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF WE HAVE TO HELP EACH OTHER AND WORK THROUGH THIS AS A GROUP
UH AS IT SAYS WE'RE GONNA GET INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTIONS BUT UH I DON'T THINK THEY ALLOWED A LOT OF EXTRA TIME
SO I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF LESS OF THIS AND MORE AT DO WILL SET US IN GOOD STEAD
UM THEN I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO PROLONG IT AND F WE SHOULD FINISH THIS MEETING AT NI RIGHT NOW AND GO INTO OTHER THINGS
UH YEAH IF I CAN PICK UP WITH ALL THESE BITS AND PIECES HANG ON
UH RIGHT SO YOU WANT AN ANIMAL AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
DO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE WHAT ANIMAL IT IS
ONLY ANIMAL I COULD THIN I COULD DRAW
OH AND THE TAIL
A WHAT
THAT THAT THAT'S THE SORTA PRODUCT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE THAT WILL WORK FOR A IN A HOME ENVIRONMENT FOR A T. V. S AND
I THINK ONE THAT WORKS WOULD BE GOOD
UH FANTASTIC PETS AND VERY FRIENDLY
BUT I PRESUME THIS IS T I PRESUME THIS IS JUST FOR TELEVISION
I THINK ONE IN B BRIGHT COLOURS WOULD BE GOOD
I THINK ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE LOTS OF SUPERFLUOUS FUNCTIONS
YOU KNOW SUBTITLES MUTE THERE'S A LOTTA BUTTONS THAT I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT THEY DO LIKE
IS THIS OKAY
UM I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE SLEEK AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF FREEDOM BUT THEY ALSO DO N UH SWIM IN GROUPS SO
UH YEAH
IF FIFTY PERCENT IS NORMAL
YEAH THAT'S UM
WE TEND TO UM GO TO MENUS AND THEN MAKE CHOICES YOU KNOW
SO IF IT'S LIKE AN UH VOLUME BUTTON YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO IN AND SAY MUTE OR OR VOLUME
THIS IS A MEETING ON FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
UM I DID TOOK THE MINUTES FROM THE FIRST MEETING AND I'LL SHOW THEM TO YOU IN A MOMENT
IS THIS AP EVERYBODY AGREE WITH THIS
UM AND AFTER THE MEETING THERE'LL BE THINGS TO BE DONE AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT SAYS WE GET TO GET LUNCH
UM AS YOU CAN SEE IT WAS THIS EARLIER TODAY
UM KATE STEPH SARAH AND MYSELF IN OUR FOUR CAPACITIES WERE PRESENT
AND WE CLOSED EARLY SO YOU COULD THEN PROCEED WITH YOUR RESEARCH AND GETTING YOUR REPORTS TOGETHER FOR TOD THIS MEETING
ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THOSE MINUTES
AND WE DID A LITTLE BIT OF UH TEAM BUILDING OF UH OF MAKING THE PICTURES BUT I DIDN'T THINK THOSE WERE APPROPRIATE TO THE MINUTES NECESSARILY
NOW IN BETWEEN AS THE PROJECT MANAGER
BUT THAT THEY WANT THIS REMOTE CONTROL TO ONLY BE FOR T. V. UM WITH INCORPORATING THE CORPORATE IMAGE COLOUR AND SLOGAN
IS THAT A LARGE ENOUGH TARGET MARKET TO TARGET IT
IN REAL NUMBERS DOES THE NINETY ONE PERCENT AND THE SEVENTY SIX PERCENT TRANSLATE TO EX IN EXCESS OF THE FOUR MILLION
I THINK SHE SAID WE DON'T NEED TO SCREW IT IN JUST STICK IT IN
NEXT TO THE CONTROL BUTTON ON THE BOTTOM AND THEN F. EIGHT AT THE TOP
AND THEN W BE PATIENT
I THINK THE WHITE THAT ONE ON THE RIGHT IS AS WELL AS LESS CLUTTERED
THE BLOCK THAT THAT RECTANGLE FOR THE USER INTERFACE IS WHERE THE USER COMES IN OF WHAT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
WHAT DO THE BUTTONS LOOK LIKE
THE TECHNICAL END IS WHAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE IN THERE BUT ALSO IT HAS TO BE EASY ENOUGH TO CHANGE OR REPAIR IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
UM IS THERE ANY UM BECAUSE IT MAY BE IN THE SAME AREA WITH SEVERAL OTHER USER INTERFACES LIKE FOR D. V. D. S MOVIES WHATEVER
UH YEAH
M YEAH THAT WOULD BE TOO HEAVY AND IT'D COST TOO MUCH
ARE WE AGREED AS TO WHAT OUR TARGET GROUP IS THOUGH
PRETTY MUCH SO THAT WE'D BE LOOKING FOR THE YOUNGER END
I I S USUALLY PUT MORE MONEY THAN BRAINS
OR DO WE S MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES TO THE MAN THROUGH THE MANUFACTURER
WE SELL TO THE MANUFACTURER AS THE REMOTE THAT GOES WITH IT
OUR FUNCTIONS WE'VE SO FAR DECIDED I THINK THAT POWER CHANNEL VOLUME MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE
IS THAT AGREEABLE TO EVERYONE
AH
ENTER POWER AS A S OH UM A SUM SIMULTANEOUS KEY
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU
THEN YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE AN OFF TE OFF KEY
AS YOU SAID YOU KNOW DON'T MAKE IT TOO HARD FOR THE GRANNY
UM SO ARE WE AGREED THEN OF THOSE THINGS
THIS OUGHTA BE FUN
UH IT LOST IT OFF HERE
UH
NO IT WAS UP THERE BUT I COULDN'T SEE IT DOWN HERE
UM YOU HAVE TO KEEP DOING THE FINANCI THE THE F. N. AND F. EIGHT TO FIVE MINUTES TO FINISH THANK YOU A LOT FOR TELLING ME
AND I HOPE THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER TO TELL HER THAT'S THE END
WELL I THINK I WENT OVER THE FUNCTIONS AND WROTE THEM DOWN AND MARKED THEM
COLOUR AND SLOGAN UM WHICH I THINK IS MORE IN THE USER UH RANGE WITH STEPH
BUT IF WE'RE AIMING TO TO BUILD THIS THING FOR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY UM IS THAT A LOT OR A LITTLE
HE MUST BE W ONE OF A S SMALL POPULATION
AND IF YOU WANT IT TO GO INTO SLIDE SHOW MODE IT'S THAT LITTLE BUTTON THERE
I YOU CAN IF YOU LIKE IT IT THAT THAT JUST SETS IT UP TO DO A P A P NO THAT ONE THAT ONE THERE
AND THEN YOU JUST PRESS THE CLICK WHEN YOU WANNA GO ON
UM OH AND THIS IS THE METHODOLOGY I USED IN PREPARING FOR THIS MEETING
AND THE THE BASIC COMPONENTS WE'VE GOT TO BUILD IN FOR OUR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY ARE UM AN ENERGY SOURCE THE USER INTERFACE AND
WE TURN THAT INTO A MESSAGE UM AND THEN WE NEED A SENDING MECHANISM TO SEND IT TO THE RECEIVER
I WOULD HAVE HAVE HOPED TO UM
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE TECHNOLOGY DEFEATED ME SO IF YOU'LL BEAR WITH ME I'LL DO IT ON THE WHITEBOARD
THE TH THE CHIP THAT ACTUALLY HAS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE MACHINE THAT TRANSLATES BUTTON PRESSES INTO A MESSAGE WHICH IT THEN
SO THOSE ARE THE BASIC THINGS THAT WE'VE GOT TO GET IN FOR OUR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY
WELL I MAY BE WRONG HERE BUT I'D BEEN THINKING OF THIS DEVICE AS BEING A A CHEAP MASS PRODUCED DEVICE
WE'RE TRYING TO SELL FOUR MILLION OF 'EM UM THAT'S THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S ALMOST ONE IN EVERY TENTH HOUSEHOLD OR WHATEVER IT IS
UM AND I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT AS BEING A REPARABLE THING
YOU JUST IF IT GOES WRONG YOU CHUCK IT OUT AND THAT'S WHY I'M A BIT CONCERNED
WELL I UH THINK THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING IDEA BUT UM I'M NOT A VERY GOOD INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHAT THESE THINGS COST
WELL SOLAR MAY NOT BE SO GOOD WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. IN THE NIGHT BUT
SO DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT MAKE THAT A SELLING POINT IF IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND WE COULD AFFORD TO DEVELOP
YEAH I WAS WONDERING THAT BECAUSE I AG I AGREE THAT THERE THERE'RE PEOPLE WITH UH HOW CAN I PUT IT
H HOW DOES THAT WORK
HOW SO SO HOW DOES THAT WORK HOW DO YOU AVOID SWITCHING THE THING OFF WHEN YOU ACTUALLY WANNA PRESS ENTER
COULD GRANNY DO THIS OR ARE WE JUST NOT AIMING AT GRANNY
UH
HOW DO YOU MAKE IT DO BOTH
AH OKAY IT TOGGLES THROUGH YEAH
SO WE'RE STILL IN MEETING AREN'T WE
YEAH I DO
OH IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ON DOES IT
IF WE CAN BUILD ON THIS WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I'D THOUGHT ABOUT AT ALL BUT IT'S ALSO SOMETHING WE CAN DISCUSS
UM AND AND I PRESUME WE CAN MISS OUT THE FUNCTIONS REALLY TO TO A VIDEO OR D. V. D. REMOTE CONTROL
UH THE ONE ON THE LEFT
UH BUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
WHICH HAS IT ALSO HAS PLAY STOP AND PAUSE AND EVERYTHING I DON'T THINK WE NEED THEM AT ALL
I THINK WE JUST NEED CHANNEL SELECTION
I THINK AN AN ENTER FUNCTION WHERE YOU CAN ACCESS IT'S NOT LIKE TELETEXT BUT ALONG THE SAME LINES ACCESS THINGS ON THE SCREEN
UH
NOT RELATED TO THE INTERNET ONE THAT YOU MENTIONED BECAUSE THAT'D BE FAR OUTSIDE OUR BUDGET AND WHAT WE WANT THIS TO DO
IS MORE A TEXT ON THE SCREEN THING THAN UH THAN ACTUAL BUTTONS O I WAS THINKING SOMETHING SOME SMOOTH
THE THE STYLE OF THESE IS TERRIBLE
NOT ONLY POSSIBLY EVEN MATERIALS LIKE THE TYPE OF PLASTIC USED BUT EVERYTHING INCLUDING SIZE AND SHAPE OF BUTTONS
IT DOES IT DOES SEEM AS IF WE'RE JUST TO DO SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE AND MASS PRODUCED
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE UH YOU KNOW LIKE A RECHARGEABLE INTERNAL BATTERY LIKE WELL LIKE AN M. P. THREE PLAYER DOES
YOU'D NEVER NEED UH BATTERIES WOULD Y UH YEAH
NO BUT JUST A RECHARGEABLE INTERNAL BATTERY WOULD PROBABLY I MEAN IT MIGHT COST MORE TO AT FIRST TO DEVELOP AND TO INSTALL
BUT FOR LONG TERM USE IT'LL BE SO MUCH MORE CONVENIENT AND ECONOMIC THAN FIDDLING AROUND TRYING TO REPLACE CHUNKY A. A. BATTERIES AND NOT HAVING ANY IN YOUR KITCHEN DRAWER AND
YOU KNOW F
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY RESOLUTIONS BY THE END OF THE DAY ARE WE
DO THEM ON THE ACTUAL TELEVISION ITSELF LIKE HERE YOU HAVE A
I I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT USING A REMOTE CONTROL SO
SORRY WHAT WHAT ACTUALLY ARE THESE IS THAT THE YELLOW AND BLACK
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY
ONE OF THE THE BIGGEST ISSUES I FOUND ABOUT UM FROM LAST MEETING WAS THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO SELL FOUR MILLION OF THESE UM
OF HANDHELD TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN USED AND ARE USED BY MANY OF US AND TO KIND OF BRING THE REMOTE CONTROL INTO THE SI SAME REALM AS AN ACCESSIBLE UM USEFUL ELECTRONIC DEVICE
MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WHAT KEYS OR OR BUTTONS ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL TO PERHAPS KEEP AND AND WHAT ONES TO DISCARD
THE I GO EVERYWHERE POWER AND THE HIGH DEFINITION D. V. D. PLAYERS ALTHOUGH IT MAKES IMMEDIATE SENSE TO HAVE OUR REMOTE CONTROL INTERACT WITH THESE
I THINK WE CAN ALSO USE THIS AS A PLATFORM TO MAKE IT INTERACT WITH OTHER TOOLS
WELL I THINK WE CAN I I THINK WE CAN REALLY FOCUS ON THIS REMOTE AND AND AGAIN BRING THE REAL REACTION UM BRAND IN IN AND AND GET SOME POSITIVE MARKETING FOR OUR OTHER TOOLS
SO AN INTERESTING UM ELEMENT WAS THE WOULD YOU PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION QUESTION
SO THESE MARKET RESEARCH UH UH QUESTIONNAIRES LOOKED INTO YOUR YOUR UH CONCERN ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND S SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO
VERY INTERESTING I I LEAVE THIS UP TO THE GROUP TO DECIDE IF WE WANNA USE THIS UH IF AND YOU KNOW
I MEAN S THREE QUARTERS OF THE NEXT AGE GROUP TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE ARE INTERESTED
AND UH WITH THE TECHNOLOGIES IMPROVING IF WE CAN GET THESE UH
TO
BUT WOULD YOU PAY MORE AND DOES IT WORK AND IS IT APPROACHABLE AND AND DID I KNOW THAT IT WAS IT WAS AN THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION
I DON'T KNOW IF SPEECH RECOGNITION SHOULD BE UM SHOULD BE INCLUDED BUT I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING I THINK THAT MAYBE SHOWS MORE ABOUT UH
SUSSING OUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING AND WHAT'S IN THE PIPELINE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT
MAYBE AFTERWARDS WE COULD DO A UH WHITEBOARD WITH THAT YOUR THE ONE ON THE RIGHT AS A AS A
BASIS
KI SOME IDEA OF HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO CREATE A DEVICE THAT HAS THESE BASIC ELEMENTS
NO THE CHIP COMPOSER MARKETING
OH NO THE CHIP COMPOSER SENDER
BE BECAUSE THEN WE WOULD HA HA FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH WE HAD TO PLAY WITH IN TERMS OF USER INTERFACE AND THIS LOOK AND FEEL IDEA
WELL THAT HAS ANOTHER ELEMENT WHICH IS IF EVERY TIME YOU'RE DONE USING THE REMOTE YOU PUT IT ON A CHARGER THEN YOU THEN IT HAS A PLACE
YEAH BUT IT ALSO HAS A PLACE SO EXACTLY
LOSS AND BREAKAGE OF UM REMOTES HOW MUCH OF THAT IS IS TO DO WITH IT NOT REALLY HAVING A UH A HOME
SO IF YOU CAN DOCK IT UM YOU KNOW YOU COULD S ARGUE THAT THIS IS
OH OH OH I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF THAT KATE
IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO KNOW UM UH WHO YOU KNOW WHO'S ACTUALLY BUYING TELEVISIONS AND ARE WE IN A UH UH S
REGION WHERE PEOPLE HAVE MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION IN A HOME
TH YEAH TH THOSE ARE
I I MY ONLY COMMENT IS I THINK MAYBE UM WE COULD SOMEHOW INCLUDE AN ENTER KEY IN LIKE A POWER KEY IF POWER POWER WAS ENTER AND POW THAT WAS MY ONLY JUST REALLY IN TERMS OF STREAMLINING
WELL IF YOU'RE PRESSING ENTER THE THE THING WOULD ALREADY BE ON AND SO MAYBE UM WHEN YOU PRESS POWER INITIALLY IT TURNS IT ON
PRESS POWER AGAIN AND USE THAT AS AN ENTER UM SO YOU PRESS POWER AFTER YOU'VE UM WELL I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU TO TURN IT OFF YOU'D HAVE TO PRESS POWER TWICE IN SUCCESSION
OR Y YEAH
OR SOMETHING THAT HAS A A TURNING DIAL WHERE AT THE FAR END IS ON OR OFF
D
UM OUR AGENDA SHOULD BE UM THAT WE'RE OPENING THE MEETING I HAVE THE MINUTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING ARE ON THE SHARED F DRIVE AT THIS POINT
IT'S TWENTY FIVE AFTER TWO AT THE MOMENT SO FORTY MINUTES IS FIVE AFTER THREE UM WHICH I'LL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE CLOCK FOR US
UM THERE ARE THE DECISIONS WE HAVE TO TURN TO BUT WE'LL COME BACK TO THEM IN A MINUTE AFTER I TAKE US TO THE
RIGHT UM AS WE REMEMBER I OPENED THE MEETING THE FOUR OF US WERE PRESENT THE MEETING THE FIRST MEETING'S MINUTES WERE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
AND THEN STEPH DID A SECOND PRESENTATION UM THAT THOSE FUNCTIONS PLUS STREAMLINING THEM WITH BIG USER FRIENDLY KEYS THAT WERE EASY TO USE
I THINK ALL OF US AGREED WITH THOSE THINGS
UM AND THE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT IT FOR BE FOR T. V. ONLY UM AND THAT IT INCLUDE THE L SO SLOGAN AND COLOUR OF THE UH CORPORATE DESIGN BE INCLUDED
UM AT THAT POINT WE AGREED THAT SARAH WOULD LOOK AT THE CURRENT COST OF COMPETITION WHAT WHAT DO THE CURRENT ONES SELL FOR
AND I WAS TO TYPE UP THESE MINUTES AND WORK ON THE FINAL REPORT
IS THIS A FAIR PRESENTATION OF WHAT OUR LAST MEETING WAS
SO WE'RE GOING TO PULL THE PLUG ON ME AND TURN TO SARAH
IS THAT OKAY
IS THAT ALRIGHT WITH EVERYBODY ELSE
ESPECIALLY SINCE KATE ASKED TO BE LAST
SARAH I'M SORRY IF I MISSPELLED YOUR NAME I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS S. A. R. A. OR S. A. R. H.
AH THERE IT IS
TA DA
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE THE UH COVERS THAT THEY USE FOR THE REMOTE YOU KNOW YOUR T YOUR CELL PHONE
IN MOST FAMILIES DON'T ISN'T THE REMOTE IS A REMOTE
WELL ACTUALLY SOME HOUSEHOLDS DO HAVE THREE AND FOUR T. V. S AND THEY WOULD HAVE A REMOTE FOR EACH ONE SO
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE DEVICE ITSELF OR THE C OR A COVER FOR THE DEVICE THAT WOULD BE AN INTERCHANGEABLE COV COVER AS A SEPARATE
PERHAPS PERHAPS THAT DESI THAT PARTICULAR SUGGESTION NEEDS TO GO BACK TO MANAGEMENT AND PERHAPS GO TO ANOTHER GROUP TO ACTUALLY DESIGN AS A SEPARATE PRODUCT
WO WOULD THAT BE AGREEABLE
KEEP DOING IT UNTIL YOU GET IT IN BOTH YOU GET IT THERE YOU GET IT YOURS WITHOUT THAT ONE AND THEN YOU GET IT WITH BOTH
THAT IS YOU JUST HAVE TO MOVE IT SOME AND YOU'D BE ABLE TO USE IT UM AS OPPOSED TO A BATTERY THAT YOU HAVE TO EITHER PUT IT IN A RECHARGER OR UM KEEP REPLACING THE BATTERIES
OR SOLAR THAT YOU'D HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH IT IF IT'S A DARK DAY THAT IT'LL DIE ON YOU AND NO WAY TO DO IT
UM SO WHAT'S OUR PLEASURE HERE WHAT WOULD BE THE COST CONSEQUENCES OF EACH OF THE THREE
WHAT'S THE UH FEELINGS OF THE GROUP ON THE KINETIC
SO THE CONSENSUS SEEMS TO BE USE THE KINETIC IF IT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE
UM THE NEXT THING THAT THEY WANTED US TO DO WAS LOOK AT CHIP ON PRINT AS A DECISION
WHAT ABOUT THE CA YEAH
OH THE WAY WE UH-HUH
I THINK THEY'RE TALKING THERE ABOUT DO WE WANT WOOD PLASTIC TITANIUM OR RUBBER AND I THINK WE'VE DISCUSSED NOT HAVING TITANIUM
ONE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE UM AND SECOND IT WON'T DO THIS DOUBLE UM CURVES
I'M SORRY TO PUSH YOU BUT WE ONLY HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES TO FINISH WITH
AND THEY ACTUALLY WANT A LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN USER INTERFACE DESIGN YOU CAN LOOK AND SEE THIS AS WELL AS I CAN
AH TA DA
YES BECAUSE I CAN'T EVEN SEE MINE
UM THE TWO OF YOU GET TO PLAY WITH A PLA MODELLING CLAY UM TO DO A PROTOTYPE
UH AND EVERYBODY GETS INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTIONS IN THE USUAL WAY
I'M GLAD TO SEE THE MARKETING BUDGET IS BEING SO WELL SPENT ON
YEAH I I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME TROUBLE WHEN WE GET DOWN TO THE COMPONENT DESIGN ON THIS
W W WOULD IT BE HELPFUL IF UM I DESCRIBED THE COMPONENTS A BIT
BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD GIVE YOU UM MAYBE BRING THIS DISCUSSION BACK TO EARTH OF WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY DO
AND I'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MA MANUFACTURING DIVISION WHO HAVE TOLD ME WHAT'S ACTUALLY AVAILABLE
YOU KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART IN COMPONENTS IS AND SOME OF THE EXCITING NEW THINGS THEY'VE GOT
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S QUITE WHAT YOU WANT UM
I REALLY NEED A PEN OR SOMETHING BUT UH DOES MY MOUSE WORK
UM OH YEAH CAN YOU SEE MY LITTLE MOUSE POINTER
AND THIS IS A PUSH BUTTON ONE SO YOU SEE THESE LITTLE LITTLE BUTTONS HERE
UM AND WE THAT'S THE BASIC CONSTRUCTION THAT WE'VE GOT TO GOT TO ACCOMMODATE
WE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT PUSHES THE LITTLE BUTTONS THAT UM TALK TO THE CHIP THAT ENCODES THE MESSAGE THAT SENDS THE THE MESSAGE TO THE RECEIVER
SARAH BUT UM DOING MY PRESENTATION IN THE ORDER I WROTE IT
UM ONE THAT ONE THAT I THINK IS QUITE INTERESTING IS THE KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE
WHERE UM YOU YOU ACTUALLY GET THE ENERGY BY MOVING THE DEVICE WHICH IS QUITE A NI A NICE AND NEAT ONE
OR WE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT SOLAR POWER BUT I THING THAT WE AGREED THAT THAT'S NOT SO GOOD IN THE DARK
NOW I'M AFRAID THIS IS THE OPTIONS WE'VE GOT ON ON THE CASE
IT CAN BE MADE OF PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD O IF YOU LIKE OR TITANIUM
UM AND THE NEAREST WE'VE GOT TO ST TO SPONGY THERE I GUESS IS RUBBER BUT UM
SO YOU CAN HAVE IT LIKE ON A MOUSE WHERE YOU CAN USE IT TO GO UP AND DOWN
CHANGE VOLUME OR CHANNEL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND PUSH TO
UM YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE SCROLL BUTTONS UM THIS IS MAYBE GETTING A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED BUT UM IT'S IT THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE
AND WE CAN ALSO INCORPORATE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY IN THE REMOTE BUT THIS WILL INCREASE THE COST
SIMPLE REGULAR ADVANCED AND THE PRICE GOES UP AS WE CHOOSE EACH OF THIS
IF WE WANT THE NICE CHEAP ONE THE SIMPLE THEN WE CAN ONLY HAVE PUSH BUTTONS
ALL THE OTHER FANCY INTERFACE DESIGNS GO OUT THE WINDOW I'M AFRAID
IF YOU WANT THE ADVANCED CHIP IT OBVIOUSLY COSTS MORE BUT IT THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED IF YOU WANT THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
OR WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS A BIT NICER I THINK IT UM WON'T NECESSARILY L UH LOOK LIKE A PINEAPPLE BUT UM
WE WE COULD WE COULD DO UM A DOUBLE CURVED RUBBER ONE WHICH WOULD ALLOW UM SAY A BANANA
BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY I SEE FROM MY NOTES THAT IF WE DO THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A PUSH BUTTON AS THE INTERFACE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING FANCIER
I THINK IT YEAH YOU YOU WILL DO AN
'CAUSE UM OTHERWISE WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING UP THE PRICE NOT ONLY FOR PUTTING BUILDING THE L. C. D. IN BUT FOR THE ELECTRONICS AS WELL
DO YOU WANT SCROLL BUTTONS IN THAT AS WELL
WE WE COULD ACTUALLY DO IT IN RUBBER INSTEAD OF PLASTIC IF YOU'D RATHER IF YOU FEEL IF YOU LIKE THE SPONGY
I I IT IT'S JUST THE WAY THAT THE THE THE UH TH THE WAY IT'S AC IT'S ACTUALLY BUILT AND YOU YOU PRINT ONTO THE CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE YOU MIGHT PRINT ONTO PAPER
THE THE RUBBER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE SAME AS YOU HAVE IN THOSE LITTLE STRESS BALLS SO IT'S YEAH
I'D I'D NEED TO TALK TO MANUFACTURING AGAIN ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S ACTUALLY POSSIBLE BUT I AGREE IT'S UH SOUNDS LIKE A NICE IDEA IF IT IS
I SHOULD I SHOULD R
WHICH I THINK TECHNICALLY IS JUST PUSH BUTTON AND UH I'D CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT THAT THAT BRINGS THE COST DOWN QUITE A LOT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE AN EX THE COMPANY'S AN EXPERT ON
GOING NO WE'RE GONNA WATCH THIS YOU CAN BRING OUT YOUR OWN REMOTE AND BE LIKE ZAP NO WE'RE GONNA WATCH THIS
AND AS FOR
AS FOR UM WELL BUDGETING AS WELL IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT INTERCHANGEABLE
IS THIS TO THE MARKET
YOU DID SEEM TO INCLUDE JUST IN MORE DETAIL WHAT I'VE GOT THOUGH
WHICH WAS A BIG COLLECTION OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT MODELS OF REMOTE CONTROLS AND OTHER THINGS THAT USE A SIMILAR SORT OF THING INCLUDING M. P. THREE PLAYERS UH
UM WHAT FUNCTIONS WE ACTUALLY NEED AND THEN HOW TO GROUP AND ARRANGE THESE ON THE ACTUAL
UH I'VE BEEN ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THE IPOD STYLE SCROLL WHEEL WHICH
WELL I COULDN'T FIND A THE PICTURE OF THE IPOD W ONLY LINKED TO A WEB BROWSER
SO I COULDN'T COPY AND PASTE IT BUT IT HAD A SIMILAR THING TO THIS THING ON THE RIGHT
A REALLY SIMPLE INTERFACE WITH JUST A COUPLE OF SCROLL THINGS ON IT UM AND THEN INSTEAD OF A DISPLAY THE DISPLAY COULD APPEAR ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN
LIKE YOU KNOW YOU PRESS ENTER AND IT COMES UP WITH WHAT'S SHOWING ON THAT CHANNEL AT THE MOMENT
AND YOU CAN DO YOU CAN SCROLL ALONG AND IT'LL SHOW YOU WHAT'S ON IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR
WHAT SEEMS KIND OF IDEAL FOR ME WOULD BE TO JUST HAVE
BUT THAT WOULD CORRESPOND TO A SCREEN THAT WOULD APPEAR ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN LIKE YOU KNOW
JUST SMALL ALONG THE BOTTOM INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF HAVING THE IPOD STYLE DISPLAY SCREEN ON THE ACTUAL REMOTES WHICH IS FAR TOO EXPENSIVE
AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT A SCREEN SITTING THERE IN FRONT OF YOU YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE IT APPEARING UH ON THE SCREEN IN FRONT OF YOU
AND SO ON THAT YOU CAN JUST MUCH IN THE SAME WAY AS AN EXISTING SKY REMOTE SCROLL ALONG SCROLL UP AND DOWN
AND UH AND I DEFINITELY SUPPORT UH THE USE OF PLASTIC AND OR RUBBER
I MEAN TITANIUM WOULD BE GREAT BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE A BIT TOO EXPENSIVE AND TOO KINDA SPACEY
WHEREAS A PLASTIC'S SO CHEAP AND EASY AND MOULDABLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE
YOU KNOW YOUR INFORMATION ABOUT PROGRAMME THAT'S ON AT THE MOMENT
BUT AS FOR ACTUALLY ARRANGING THEM LET ME GO BACK TO THE
TO THE PICTURE OF THE KIDDIE ONE
ON THE ONE ON THE RIGHT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM IS THE MOUSE
YEAH SEE WHERE THE MOUSE IS LIKE THIS S STYLE THING WHERE YOU C HAVE UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT
AH HERE WE GO
YEAH SO I MEAN EITHER A CHANNEL UP AND DOWN VOLUME UP AND DOWN
SO ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS THESE FOUR BUTTONS WITH THE ENTER IN THE MIDDLE
LOOK AT LOOK AT THIS ONE
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MISPLACE OR L OR LOSE
THAT ALSO IS POSSIBLE
UH JUST SOMETHING ELSE I NEED TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IS HAVE YOU HAVE YOU SEEN THESE ON A REMOTE
YOU EXPECT THAT TO BE THE DOWN BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A DOWNWARD POINTING ARROW BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE V. TO INDICATE THAT IT'S THE VOLUME SO
UH WE DO NEED TO AVOID LITTLE AMBIGUITIES LIKE THESE
IF WE'RE HAVING THE SCROLL WHEEL THEN IT'S GONNA DOUBLE UP AS ALL THE OTHER UP AND DOWN FUNCTIONS
I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS IT BEFORE BUT IT SOUNDS FANTASTIC
YEAH S THICK SPONGY COVER SO IT FEELS LIKE THE WHOLE THING'S SPONGY BUT ACTUALLY YOU'RE NOT DAMAGING ANYTHING BY SQUEEZING IT
JUST COPY THE ONE ON THE LEFT
I RESPOND TO EITHER
SOME OF THEM THAT HAVE A HIGHER BRAND RECOGNITION ARE ON THE MORE EXPENSIVE END
BUT I THINK THAT WITH THE CURRENT UM PRICE THAT WE'RE SEARCHING FOR WE'RE WELL WITHIN EVEN ON THE LOWER END OF THE UH OF THE MARKET
BUT I'M GOING TO MOVE ON TO MORE INTERESTING UM MORE VIBRANT THINGS
I KNOW THAT YOU ALL ARE A DISTANCE FROM CUTTING EDGE MARKETING RESEARCH SO YOU KNOW I'M JUST GONNA TRY TO CLOAK IT IN REALLY PROFESSIONAL TERMS HERE
THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING CHANGE FROM PAST YEARS BECAUSE IT IS MUCH MORE ORGANIC UM SOME WOULD SAY APPROACHABLE
AND SOME OF THE BOLD COLOURS INTO A SIMPLE
WHAT AGAIN ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES IN UH DECISION MAKING ABOUT UH PURCHASING
FUNCTIONAL IS OUT
AND F THE FANCY AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE TERM I'M I'M THINKING POLISHED ELEGANT YOU KNOW KIND OF INNOVATIVE BUT A CUT ABOVE
THIS IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE NEXT FINDING WHICH IS TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
THIS IS INTERESTING 'CAUSE I THINK IN THE LAST MEETING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AS BEING SO IMPORTANT
BUT MAYBE WHAT'S INNOVATIVE IS HAVING IT SIMPLE WITH UM WITH UH TECHNOLOGICALLY SUPERIOR FABRICS OR UH YOU KNOW DESIGNED IN INTERESTING SUBSTANCES
EASE OF USE
AGAIN PRETTY LOW I MEAN IT'S THE TOP THREE BUT EACH OF THE UH FANCY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE ARE FAR MORE IMPORTANT
YOU KNOW IT WOULD HAVE LIKE FRUIT AND VEG IS THAT WE ACTUALLY MAKE THESE SPONGY
SO BANANA PINEAPPLE AND PEAR
EVERYONE HAS A T. V. REMOTE BUT THEN WE ADD IN THE FACT THAT THEY COULD EACH HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL FRUIT
BUT I THINK I THINK WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW IS PERHAPS A PERSON IN THE FAMILY WHO HAD THE MOST OPINION ABOUT IT WE ALL NEED A REMOTE
W AND PLUS I THINK
UH YEAH
I I JUST HAVE MY EAR TO THE MARKET GUYS
I THINK MANY OF US WOULD ASSOCIATE THOSE WITH FANCY
UH WELL I WAS REALLY THINKING A LOT ABOUT THE I. UH THE IMAC KIND OF GEL GEM TONE
ANY IDEA YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WOULD BE A COST DIFFERENCE
UM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA IF IF THIS COULD IF THE FANCY MODEL COULD BE DONE IN TWELVE EUROS FIFTY
OH I THINK UM
TO UH M MAKE IT
OH NICE
AND HAVE IT ABSTRACT
I'M JUST JUST THROWING OUT IDEAS
IT COULD TIE IN WITH THE FANCIFUL DESIGN AS UH YOU KNOW THROW THE BANANA YOU KNOW JUST GOTTA KEEP IT MOVING
BUT I COULD MARKET THAT AS A UM AS A A I WAS THINKING ACTUALLY A A COST SAVER DOWN THE ROAD IN TERMS OF BATTERY YOU KNOW
I SU
THEN I'LL JUST SAY I SUPPORT EITHER FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW I SUPPORT EITHER DECISION THAT THE DESIGNERS MAKE ON THAT
UM ALMOST THERE'S ONE MORE THING I HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ATTACHMENT WILL OPEN
AH HA
DOES IT COME UP TOGETHER OR DISAPPEAR ONE OF THEM OR WHAT
AH WE CAME UP TOGETHER WE'RE GOOD
THIS IS A F ANOTHER FORTY MINUTE ONE SO IT WILL END AT FOUR TWENTY FIVE
OUR AGENDA IS AS BEFORE FOR ME TO OPEN THE MEETING FOR US TO GO OVER THE PREVIOUS MINUTES
THEN FOR THE TWO OF YOU TO PRESENT YOUR PROTOTYPE AND FOR YOU TO G UM SARAH PRESENT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ALL THINKING OF OH MY
UM AND AS YOU CAN SEE THAT'S WHAT WE DO NEXT ON THIS THING
SO THE FIRST THING I HAVE TO DO IS CLOSE THIS SO THAT I CAN GET TO
THAT SHOULD BE THERE MINUTES
UH FROM MEETING THREE IS IT ALRIGHT WITH YOU IF I DON'T SWITCH IT TO SHOW JUST USE IT AS IS
UM WE DISCUSSED THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES BASED ON WHAT WAS PRESENTED IN THOSE PRESENTATIONS
THERE WAS NO DECISION MADE ON THE CURVATURES OR DOUBLE CURVATURE OR STRAIGHT
UM THAT WAS ACTUALLY IN USE
UM AND AS SUGGESTED UM YELLOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS WITH THE COMPANY LOGO
A SLOGAN AND IMAGE MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO US
AND UH WE CLOSED AS IT RAN OUT OF TIME
IS THAT A FAIR PRESENTATION OF WHAT HAPPENED
OOH TWO
AH
OH I SEE THE ON OFF'S IN THE BACK
I COULD SEE THIS THING UNLESS IT'S REINFORCED HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE
THE NEXT ITEM IS EVALUATION
AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT SAYS THE SAME THING IT HAD NOT LOST ITSELF THANK GOODNESS
KINETIC IS UM AND HOW MANY OF THOSE WILL WE NEED PER WE ONLY NEED ONE
ELECTRONIC SIMPLE CHIP ON PRINT AND WE'LL NEED ONE OF THOSE
OKAY AND WE ONLY NEED ONE OF THOSE
IT LOOKS LIKE IT SINGLE CURVE 'CAUSE OF TH THE CHUNKINESS
IT'S THAT'S UH UH ONE
UH THAT'S THE THE ONE THAT GOES LIKE THIS
NO SINGLE CURVE
WE'LL COME BACK IF WE CAN TO THE RUBBER BEING ADDED AT THE MOMENT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE
LET'S PUT THAT RUBBER IN THEN OF THE CASE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENT
WE'RE IN
THAT'S US
AS OUR PROJECT DOCUMENT BIT
THAT'S THE ONLY EXCEL DOCUMENT THAT WILL BE IN THERE SO IT'S THERE FOR ALL OF US
SO WE WENT OVER ALL THOSE THINGS AND WE'RE SATISFIED WITH ALL THE ABOVE
UM DID WE FIND ANY NEW IDEAS
ARE THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET
IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED
TA DA
THE THE CASE CAN BE EITHER UM SPONGY RUBBER OR HARD PLASTIC
WE'RE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE ABOUT A COMBINATION OF THE TWO BUT IT CAN BE EITHER OF THOSE
UM AND AS FOR THE THE ACTUAL COMPONENTS UM UH STEPH JUST SAID THIS IS A QUITE A CHEAP DEVICE TO MANUFACTURE
UM THE UM THE DIODE THAT ACTUALLY DOES THE UM INFRARED IS AT THE END
COLOUR WELL UH STEPH'S THE EXPERT ON COLOUR
BUT IT COULD BE MOVED IF IF MARKETING FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE ON OFF BUTTON IN A DIFFERENT PLACE
WELL WE HAVE GOT S TRENDY FURTHER DOWN BUT
WE HAVE THE WORRY ABOUT HOW ROBUST IT WILL BE IF IT'S IT'S CURVED AS A BANANA BUT SPONGY
I'D PUT IT AT ONE I THINK BUT I DUNNO WHAT DO YOU
YEAH I DO I DON'T THINK WE NEED THAT FOR EITHER OF THEM YOU CAN DO A BANANA IN SINGLE CURVE YEAH
DO WE NEED TO SAY HOW MANY BUTTONS OR
OR D IS IT JUST ONE
ACTUALLY DOES THA DOES SPECIAL MATERIAL MEAN THAT PLASTIC IS NOT A SPECIAL MATERIAL
WHAT WE'RE IN
DO YOU DO YOU NEED TO DOUBLE CLICK ON THAT TO OPEN IT
YEAH WELL YOU SEE EACH MADE ONE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH YELLOW DOUGH
UH THIS IS ON OFF SWITCH 'CAUSE I THINK WE DO NEED THAT AND I THINK IT GIVES IT A NICE BALANCE
UM AS FOR WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY MADE OF WELL THE FUNCTION OF THESE BUTTONS IS UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT IN THE DIFFERENT MENUS
RIGHT RIGHT ON IT EASY TO SEE
FORM
BECAUSE WE DID MAKE A ANOTHER ONE WHICH WA UH IS IN THE SHAPE OF BANANA IT'S JUST IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS AS YELLOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS
CAN I SCROLL DOWN ON THERE AND SEE WHAT ELSE
I THIN AS FOR AS FOR THE FRUIT OR ORGANIC THEME I GUESS THIS ONE IS OBVIOUSLY FRUIT SHAPED
THIS ONE HAS N BANANA YEAH
THIS ONE HAS NO OBVIOUS CONNECTIONS TO FRUIT BUT BECAUSE IT'S ROUND AND MOLDED
YOU'D EXPECT IT TO BE LIKE A CHILD'S SORTA TOY REMOTE CONTROL INSTEAD OF A REAL ONE WHICH I QUITE LIKE THAT SORT OF IMAGE
CURVATURE IS IT TO YOUR LIKING
I MEAN THE THING IS WE DO NEED TO DEVELOP OUR TECHNOLOGY OF I MEAN ACTUALLY HOW TO PROGRAM THE MENUS AND WHAT SORT OF
YOU KNOW TEXT BOX IS GONNA APPEAR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN BUT WE DO DEFINITELY THINK THAT IT'S A VIABLE OPTION
UH YEAH WE'RE FINISHED
YEAH WHAT ABOUT PRICE IS THAT GONNA GO ON THERE AS WELL
I THINK OF IT'S GOT LOTS OF EXTRA SORT OF FRIPPERIES AND YOU KNOW LIKE
I'D CALL THESE QUITE UH MINIMALIST
SIMPLE AND PLAIN BUT I MEAN I DO SEE WHAT IT IS HEAVILY RELIANT ON APPEARANCE INSTEAD OF PURE FUNCTIONALITY SO IN THAT RESPECT IT IS QUITE FANCY
WELL D WE'LL JUST CALL IT FANCY THEN
SO WHAT WE RE REALLY NEED TO DECIDE IS WHETHER WE WANT THE ACTUAL BANANA SHAPE
OH WE ALSO NEED THO THINK ABOUT THE ENERGY
IS IT THE KINETIC ENERGY
I WOULD SAY MAYBE A TWO 'CAUSE WE STILL WE NEED TO UH GET SOMEBODY IN WHO IS GOOD WITH THE PROGRAMMING FOR THE MENUS
I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST LIKE I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE EV YOU KNOW ON A NORMAL CHUNKY REMOTE EVERY BUTTON RES I MEAN MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT
JUST PUTTING NO EXCESS BUTTONS
AS FOR SEE IF WE'RE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE I'D SAY IT IS QUITE INNOVATIVE
BECAUSE THERE AREN'T REALLY MANY THAT HAVE THIS MENU IDEA INSTEAD OF ALL THE EXTRA BUTTONS
GOOD WORK AS A DESIGN TEAM BECAUSE WE
TO KEEP A SIMPLE OLD TECHNOLOGY WHICH IF IT WORKS PERFECTLY WELL I SEE NO POINT IN IMPROVING ON IF IT WORKS SO
SO WE DO COUNT AS I THINK EXCELLENT OR ONE
BRING ON THE ICE SCULPTURES
IS THAT THE END OF THE MEETING
AND THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME UNTIL YOU GET UP CLOSE AND YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW THIS IS REALLY IDENTIFIABLE
SO I'M GOING TO GO AND USE THE WHITEBOARD AND I'VE MADE A LIST OF CRITERIA TO LOOK AT
SO ONE TRUE SEVEN FALSE AND I'M GONNA NOW USE THE UM THE BOARD
AND OTHER
WE'LL PUT PRICE UP AT THE TOP
UH OKAY SO
WHA HOW DO WE FEEL IN TERMS OF IS THIS FANCY
I YEAH SO IN THAT RESPECT I THINK WE'LL GO WITH THAT RESPECT
YEAH NO THESE AREN'T THE EXACT TERMS THAT THE UM
WE'RE GON LET'S USE ELEGANT ALTHOUGH THE THE THE PEOPLE THE WORD ON THE STREET IS IS
N THAT UM
SO LET'S LET'S TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
WE'LL CALL IT E. F. UM DO WE DO WE THINK THAT PERHAPS AND MAYBE WE SHOULD SAY THE YELLOW
AS A BANANA
AND OF THE TWO I REALLY LIKE I M I LIKE THE BANANA BUT I I DO LIKE THE CHUNK
PEOPLE DON'T RESPOND WELL TO UGLY
SELLABLE UH QUIRKY YOU KNOW SOMETHING PEOPLE LIKE OH YEAH
YEAH I DO TOO
OTHER
AND I'M GONNA ACTUALLY CHANGE A COUPLE OF THESE SO THEN I'M GONNA INSTEAD OF UGLY I'M GONNA SAY IT'S ATTRACTIVE AND THEN MAKE THAT TRUE
YEAH BE YOU KNOW SO IT DOESN'T RUIN THE POLARITY
WELL IF YOU G UH LET ME KNOW IF IF ANY OF THESE UM IF YOU IF YOU ALL CAN THINK OF ANY OTHER UM THING TO CHANGE HERE IF YOU TH IF YOU THINK I SHOULD CHANGE THE INNOVATIVE OR ADD OTHER FEATURES
I THINK WITH THE MARKETING ELEMENT OF UH FRUIT SHAPED I I MEAN I THAT REALLY OPENED MY EYES
SO IT MEANS W YOU KNOW I CAN I CAN SPELL IT OUT
THERE WERE SIX TRUE OR ONES FOUR UM PARDON ME
TWO S ALMOST TRUE OR CLOSE TO TRUE SO THAT WAS FOUR POINTS
IN TERMS OF UH HO HOW MUCH WE ADHERE TO THE IDEALS OF THE UH MARKET PLACE
UM I ONE THING I WANT TO DO IS OH I THINK THE MEETING'S DONE
UM ONE THING I WA I WANNA DO IS SAVE EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT FILES BECAUSE I DON'T THINK EVERYTHING IS SAVED
I'M LOUISA
SHALL I RUB THAT OUT ACTUALLY
IS THIS JUST A TELEVISION REMOTE
SYSTEMS ARE KIND OF T. V. VIDEO COMBINED NOW OR T. V. D. V. D. COMBINED
AND ONE OF THE MOST ANNOYING THINGS IS HAVING LIKE FIVE REMOTES IN THE HOUSE
UM IF YOU GRAB THE KIND OF UH SLIDE TO THE LEFT AND PULL IT DOWN
IS THIS A MUN MULTI FUNCTIONAL ONE OR DO WE DECIDE THAT OURSELVES AS WE GO AWAY AND WORK ON IT
UH
WE UH ARE TO GET ACQUAINTED
AS TO THE TOOL TRAINING THAT UH IS REQUIRED
OH I SEE SO WE SHOULDN'T REALLY BE
SO WE HAVE THE PROJECT TEAM WHICH IS TO UM BASICALLY TO COME UP WITH A NEW R REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE
AND UH OUR IDEA IS TO UH
TO MAKE THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE UH MORE USER FRIENDLY THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE AND TO TO BE TRENDIER
SO UM METHOD OF DOING THIS IS UH SPLIT UP AS YOU CAN SEE INTO UH
IN EACH OF THESE UH PHASES WE'LL UH BASICALLY BE HANDING OVER TO YOURSELVES THE DESIGNERS OF THIS UH
AND UH HAVING UH MEETINGS SO THAT WE CAN UH DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY UM COME UP WITH A
BETTER BETTER INST IMPLEMENT THAN WE HAD BEFORE
AND YOU'LL BE DOING UH VARIOUS DESIGNS UH THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO MEET THIS END
UH
RIGHT SO EVERYONE'S TO UH SUPPOSEDLY UH DRAW THEIR FAVOURITE ANIMAL OVER ON THE WHITE BOARD OVER THERE
AH UH
BUT NOW YOU YOU UH YOU'LL MOVE OUT FROM THE MICROPHONE AND THE CAMERA
I TAKE IT THAT
I DON'T SEE AS THERE'S ANY NEED TO
WELL I'VE NOT ACTUALLY HAD TOO MANY PETS UH OVER MY UH TIME 'CAUSE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU UH
SO WHAT MY DAUGHTERS HAVE GOT AT THE MOMENT IS THEY'VE GOT UH A FEW FISH AND SO HOPEFULLY UM WON'T PROVE TOO DIFFICULT TO DRAW
UH
AS YOU CAN SEE THAT MY ARTIST ARTISTIC WORK IS USELESS AS WELL
CHANGE THE WATER EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS AND BUY IN A FEW PLANTS SO
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY KEEP DYING UH FISH ARE UH ARE NOT ARE ARE ARE REASONABLE PETS IN THAT UH THEY'RE LOW MAINTENANCE
WORK HAS BEEN DONE ON UH
WE'RE LOOKING AT UM HAVING OUR PRODUCTION COSTS LIMITED TO UH TWELVE AND AN HALF EURO PER UNIT
AND THEREFORE MAKING A PROFIT MARGIN OF UH WELL NOT ACTUALLY A PROFIT MARGIN IT'S UH BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE OVERHEADS AND VARIOUS OTHER COSTS TO UH TAKE UH FROM UH
SO I GUESS WE'RE LOOKING AT UM HAVING A DISCUSSION AT THIS POINT IN TIME TO HELP UH YOU UM FOLKS DESIGN OUR OUR NEW MODEL AS IT WERE
USE
AND SEE
UH
OH I W UM BASICALLY I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT
SO A DEVICE FOR
BUT IS IT IN A SENSE IT'S R UM MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH THE TH THE ONE DEVICE AND THEN HAVE FEW BUTTONS ON IT TO 'CAUSE YOU WANT YOU WANT SIMPLICITY AS WELL
WHILST AT THE SAME TIME YOU WANT AS YOU RIGHTLY SAID ONE REMOTE FOR ALL
AND SO THESE ARE PROBABLY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE OPTIONS THAT UH HMM YOU COULD ARGUE THAT EXPERIENCE OF USING DEVICES AND SIMILAR DEVICES AS PEOPLE GET MORE AND MORE USED TO USING REMOTES
UM IS THERE NEXT MEETING IN THIRTY MINUTES
OH WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
AND I'LL DO MINUTES AND AND WE'LL SEE YOU IN HALF AND HOUR
RIGHT S
THERE'S ONE
UH
OOH OOH I LOST IT THERE
WE'LL G THEN WE'LL GO FOR A A S SMALL SMALL BEAR
AS THAT IS THE MAIN FUNCTION
UM SORT OF EASY TO USE SO THE BUTTONS ARE ACCESSIBLE
IS EASY TO USE AND SEE
UM I'M GONNA GO FOR THE DOG AND I'M GONNA DRAW ONE BADLY AS WELL
UH
YOU CAN SORTA GET OUT AND THEY THEY SORTA NEVER GET TIRED
WE'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH UM ABOUT SORT OF YOU KNOW WHAT THE CUTTING EDGE SORT OF HAND HELD DEVICES ARE
AND A LOT OF THEM SORT OF USE YOU KNOW THEY'RE LIKE THEY'RE LIKE MINI LAPTOPS
YOUR STEREO AND WHERE YOU KNOW IF YOU BUY A NEW THING THEN IT SORT OF YOU CAN LINK IT TO THAT AS WELL MAYBE
AH THERE IT'S DOING SOMETHING
MINE'S NOT QUITE AS COMPLICATED AS ALL THAT
I'M LOUISA THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER AS YOU KNOW
UM SO THE M BASIC METHOD OF THIS IS TO SEND A SIGNAL FROM THE REMOTE TO THE TELEVISION SET SO THAT A DESIRED FUNCTION IS PERFORMED
UM AN EXAMPLE OF THE FUNCTION COULD BE TO CHANGE THE VOLUME UP OR DOWN UH SO OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TWO DIFFERENT BUTTONS FOR THAT
UM TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL EITHER BY PRESSING THE NUMBER THAT YOU WANT OR BY CHANNEL UP OR DOWN
UM TO SWITCH THE TELEVISION ON OR OFF MAYBE A STANDBY BUTTON
UM HERE ARE TWO EXAMPLE REMOTES
UM BY THE LOOK OF IT THEY BOTH HAVE UM KIND OF PLAY AND FAST FORWARD REWIND FUNCTIONS
UH BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE LEFT REMOTE IS QUITE UM QUITE BUSY LOOKING QUITE COMPLICATED
UM WHEREAS THE RIGHT REMOTE IS MUCH SIMPLER IT LOOKS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY
UM I LIKE THE USE OF THE KIND OF UM SYMBOLS LIKE THE TRIANGLES AND THE SQUARES AND THE ARROWS AS WELL AS THE WORDS ON THE UM KIND OF PLAY FUNCTIONS AND ALL THAT
COULD MAYBE DO WITH SOME MORE COLOUR
DO WE GET TO SEE THAT
WILL YOU BE PRESENTING THAT IN A BIT
I MEAN HOW OFTEN DO YOU USE SEVEN EIGHT AND NINE
BUT I THINK A LOT OF UM LIKE CABLE AND SKY AND STUFF THAT WOULD BE TUNED TO ONE CHANNEL
THERE'S KEY RINGS UM THAT YOU KIND OF WHISTLE AT OR CLAP AT I CAN'T REMEMBER AND THEN THEY WHISTLE BACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IS THAT ONE OF THE
YEAH 'CAUSE YOU DO NEED UM KIND OF BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST AND EVERYTHING AS WELL
SO YOU DON'T USE IT THAT MUCH YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE IT ALL THE TIME
BUT IT'S ALL THERE IF YOU NEED IT
AND THAT'LL BE BETTER FOR THE OLDER GENERATION AS WELL 'CAUSE WELL MY DAD DOESN'T LIKE ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE GOT TO KINDA FLICK THROUGH A MENU
BUT HE CAN PRETTY MUCH READ A BUTTON IF IT'S DISPLAYED PROPERLY
NOT AN ISSUE TO RAISE HERE BUT UM THE WHOLE THING ABOUT NOT USING YOUR STANDBY UH BECAUSE OF THE LIKE WASTE OF ELECTRICITY
UH OH DANGER SIGN
ON MUTE
OH NO I MEAN UM LIKE THERE'S KIND OF INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS FOR THEM LIKE ON THE T. V. REMOTE
THAT'S NICE TO KNOW ONE FROM EACH OF YOU
UM SO DO WE WANT TO DO THE PRESENTATION FIRST OR DO WE WANT TO UM
WE DISCUSSED THAT LAST TIME AND IN ACTUAL FACT THAT WAS PR PRETTY WELL WHAT WE CAME UP WITH ANYWAY
SO IN FACT IT ACTUALLY F WE WON'T BE FORESTALLED IN A SENSE
SO I I GOT THAT IN EMAIL FORM
SO THE BATTERY IS THE IN THE SENDER
THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO HEAR
IS IT CONTROL FUNCTION EI OH TH THERE YOU GO
SO BASICALLY WE'D HAVE TO UH WE'D HAVE TO BE PUTTING THAT ON UM THE THE PRODUCT
BUT UH I GOT UH I GOT AN EMAIL THAT BASICALLY SAID TO UH MAKE SURE THAT UH WHATEVER DEVICE WE COME UP WITH AT THE END OF THE DAY HAD TO INCORPORATE UM THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN
A. P. O. G. E. E. THAT MIGHT BE THE CORPORATE COLOUR SCHEME ALTHOUGH THE ONLY THE ONLY COLOUR I CAN SEE IN THAT IS THE RED
WELL B UH W
WELL TH THE ON THE WELL UH FOR FOR GENERAL TELEVISION PURPOSES OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE CHANNELS ONE TO FIVE AT THIS POINT IN TIME
YOU'VE GOT THE B. B. C. HAVE COME UP WITH A FURTHER SIX AND UH THERE'S UH I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY CHANNELS THERE ARE ON UH WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT UH SKY AND VARIOUS OTHER UM VARIOUS OTHERS
IF THE TIME OF FLICKING FROM ONE TO OTHER BUT PRESUMABLY IT'LL TAKE A SECOND 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STOP IT
MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE A FAST FORWARD ON THE ON THE CHANNELS THAT W AND THEN YOU COULD DISPENSE WITH MORE OTHERWISE
I S I SUPPOSE IN A SENSE YOU COULD HAVE UM IF YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED CHANNELS THEN IF YOU HAD SORT OF AN EASY WAY OF GETTING RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO ONE TO A HUNDRED
YOU COULD GO ONE TO ONE TO TEN
SO W SO WHAT WAS THE CIRCULAR THING THAT YOU WERE
IF IT'S JUST FOR T. V. WHICH IS WHAT IT IS AT THE MOMENT
YEAH I THINK SHE SAID TWENTY SECONDS TO UM
WHAT WAS THAT LAST WEE BIT THERE
WELL IF YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID HAVING A SECOND PRODUCT 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU COULD HAVE A SECOND PRODUCT THAT GAVE YOU THE RIGHT PITCH WHICH WOULD SET THE REMOTE OFF TO SAY HERE I AM SORT OF THING
BUT YOU'VE THEN GOT THE POINT IF IF YOU'RE NOT GOING WITH UH VOICE RECOGNITION THEN
IT'S THAT SIMPLE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT UH TH TH THREE UM PRIMARY UM UH REQUISITES FROM UH
FROM AND EMAIL UH THAT WAS SENT TO ME WHEREBY WE HAD THE DESIGN LOGO WAS ONE WHICH WE'VE ALREADY MENTIONED
WE'VE GOT UM THE REMOTE WAS ONLY FOR THE TELEVISION AND NOT FOR BECAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE IT TOO COMPLEX AND WE HAVE TO GET IT MARKET QUICKLY
SO THAT MEANS THAT UH SO THESE ARE THE SORT OF THREE UM EXTRA PARAMETERS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT ON THIS UH PROJECT
SO WE'RE BEING FOCUSED EFFECTIVELY DIRECTLY AT A TELEVISION AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MANAGEMENT IS UH WANTING US TO GO DOWN A NARROW PATH AND NOT OPENING OUT
S
WE'LL ALSO KNOW W WHEN THE NEXT MEETING IS I UM SO WE'LL KNOW HOW LONG WE'VE GOT TO COMPLETE THAT TASK
AND THEN WE CAN REPORT BACK AT THE NEXT MEETING AND SAY RIGHT OKAY YES
WE'VE ACHIEVED THIS OR WE HAVEN'T ACHIEVED THIS THIS IS HOW FAR WE'VE PROGRESSED
SO WE HAVE TO COME EFFECTIVELY TO THE DECISION ON THE REMOTE FUNCTIONS SO THAT YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING
IF YOU GET ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT UH ONLY YOU HAVE AT THAT POINT IN TIME YOU'D THINK WOULD BE RELEVANT TO OTHER PEOPLE IN TERMS OF THEIR DES DECISION MAKING UM PROCESS
BUT IF YOU GET IT WELL BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING
RIGHT IS THERE
UH IF IF OUR PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IS TO GET IT THERE IN TIME TIME'S SHORT
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO MEET THE MAJOR CONCERNS OF THE CONSUMER SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT AS A SELLING POINT FOR THE PRODUCT SOMETHING THAT'S QUICK AND SIMPLE
WELL SO MAYBE A CLAP RATHER THAN A WHISTLE WOULD BE ON THE BASIS THAT IF WE'VE GOT IF WE'RE CATERING TO THE WHOLE AGE RANGE
UH
EF EFFECTIVELY THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING THAT UH IF UH IF PEOPLE ARE NOW USING THE INTERNET THEN YOU DON'T NEED TELETEXT
BUT THE BUT THAT'S RELYING ON THE TELEVISION MARKET CHANGING TO AN AUTOMATIC AND IF IT IS AT THE MOMENT THAT'S FINE
OR ONLY OPERABLE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE IDEA IS TO HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET WHICH IS AND IT'S ALSO M IT'S THE THE PRODUCT WE'VE GOT IS SOMETHING THAT'S AT THE I WOULD HAVE SAID THE LOWER END OF THE S OF THE COST SCALE
SO Y AH THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA
AH
DATA FUNCTIONS HIDDEN AT BACK
CAN BRING OUT WHEN NEEDED
THAT'S RIGHT SO WE'RE DIS SO YOU'VE GOT WHICH ONES ARE GONNA BE ON THE FRONT AND WHICH ONES ARE GONNA BE ON THE BACK
SO ON FRONT
SO SO ARE YOU HAVING THE STAND BY ON THE FRONT THEN
SO IS THAT IT
AND WE'LL MEET BACK AT I'M NOT SURE
WE HAVE A I GUESS WE HAVE A PRESENTATION EACH 'CAUSE I'VE GOT ONE
I'LL JUST UM I'LL GRAB THE WIRE OUT THE BACK OF THIS ONE
HOPEFULLY THAT SHOULD BE IT THIS TIME
UM I'VE JUST GOT THREE SECTIONS FIRST IS THE RESEARCH I MADE ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF UM
UM SO HAVING RESEARCHED THE EXISTING MODELS WITHIN THE MARKET UM I FOUND MY RESEARCH OFF THE INTERNET
UM I'VE ESTABLISHED WHAT THE COMPONENTS REQUIRED FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO FUNCTION ACTUALLY ARE
AND THEN ALSO THE METHODS IN WHICH THESE COMPONENTS INTERACT TOGETHER FOR THE REMOTE TO ACTUALLY DO WHAT YOU WANT IT TO DO AND HOW IT CONNECTS WITH THE TELEVISION
WHETHER THAT'LL BE SORT OF TWO BATTERIES FOUR BATTERIES UM IT MAY VARY
S UM UM DO WE HAVE A CLOTH TO WIPE THIS DOWN WITH OR
OH I'LL J
OH I SEE
OKAY SO WE START OFF WITH A UM BATTERY SUPPL UH NO A POWER SUPPLY WHICH WE'D PROBABLY GET IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE THE BATTERY
ON THE TELEVISION
AH YES THAT'S THE POWER SOURCE
GOING ON TO PERSONAL PREFERENCES I'VE SAID THAT BATTERY SEEMS THE BEST OPTION FOR THE ACTUAL REMOTE JUST BECAUSE OF THE SIZE
IF THE BATTERY'S ON REASONABLE POWER THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO WORK FAIRLY WELL
J YEAH YEAH YEAH J YEAH JUST THIS LITTLE BIT IS THAT I THINK THAT'S STILL UM A VIDEO REMOTE PART
IT'S JUST PEOPLE ARE USED TO SEEING THAT SO IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THEM THEN THEY MIGHT THINK IT'S
SO WE GET TO HOW MANY BUTTONS HAVE WE GOT
AH YES YES THAT SEEMS GOOD
NO WHAT I MAYBE THINK IS UM
AND POSSIBLY THE THING ABOUT THE ABOUT THE REMOTE BEING LOST WE COULD HAVE YOU KNOW WITH YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU LOSE THAT AND YOU CAN RING IT
SO YOU CAN PRESS A BUTTON WHICH IS ALWAYS KEPT IN ONE PLACE AND THEN IT MAYBE BUZZES TO SOMEWHERE ELSE WHEREVER THE REMOTE ACTUALLY IS
YEAH IF WE IF WE COULD HAVE IT IN THE ACTUAL REMOTE LIKE EVERYTHING IN ONE ONE DEVICE
SO THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE T. V. KIND OF SPEAKING TO THE REMOTE AND CHANGING ITS OWN CHANNELS
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE JUST ON THE WHISTLE BACK FUNCTION AT THE MOMENT AND IF SOMETHING COMES BACK
I'D GO MORE YEAH F MORE FOR CLAP
DID WE DECIDE ON HAVING THE TEN UM THE TEN NUMBERS AND THEN THE THE LITTLE DIGIT NEXT TO IT WHICH KIND OF ENABLED YOU TO PUT THEM TOGETHER
AS IN SETTING THE AUDIO AND TUNING IT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO AND IF FINALLY THE T. V. BREAKS YOU GET A NEW ONE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TUNE IT
SO THAT'LL BE IN
WOULD YOU MAYBE HAVE LIKE ONE MENU BUTTON THEN YOU'D USE THE OTHER BUTTONS MAYBE THE NUMBER BUTTONS TO ACTUALLY DO THE SEPARATE FUNCTIONS
TO GUIDE PRESU UH I THINK IT'D BE QUITE HARD JUST FOR PEOPLE TO GRASP UM JUST OFF LIKE THE MENU USE DIFFERENT BUTTONS YOU MAYBE HAVE TO HAVE LIKE SOME BETTER INSTRUCTIONS OF HOW THAT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK
AND THERE WAS THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE WHICH HAD ALL LIKE THE DOUBLE FUNCTIONS AND STUFF WHICH KIND OF LOOKED TOO BUSY AND HAD TOO MUCH ON IT
SO UM WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE TO WORK OUT WHAT'S GONNA BE ON THESE OTHER FUNCTIONS AS AS WELL
SHOULD WE DECIDE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN
ABOUT THE NUMBER
BUT THEN THEY MIGHT NOT BUY IT IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT ONE
WE CAN SEND OUT A FLIER WITH THE DEVICE SAYING THAT YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE IT ON STAND BY
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
ONE OF US SHOULD COME UP WITH A LIST OF THESE AND THEN GET BACK AT THE NEXT MEETING JUST AT THE START AND SAY WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BE
OH YEAH AND TH AND A ENTER BUTTON JUST TO SELECT
UM I GUESS WE'RE KEEPING S IT SIMPLE
DO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CONTROLS ON THEIR ACTUAL PRODUCTS THEN OR DO YOU HAVE TO DO IT VIA THE REMOTE
YEAH I SUPPOSE IF WE'VE GOT THEIR IF THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN CONTROLS THEN WE CAN AVOID IT FOR OURS JUST TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
YEAH I'VE GOT ONE TOO
THERE'S USUALLY A LITTLE THING IN THE TOP RIGHT FOR THE OH HANG ON IT'S JUST COMING ON
AND FIRST OFF WE SHOULD STATE THAT TH THE REMOTE CONTROL'S FOR CONTROLLING THE T. V.
UM HOW D HOW DOES A REMOTE CONTROL LOOK AND FEEL FOR THEM AND WHAT IMPROVEMENTS WOULD WOULD THEY LIKE TO REMOTE CONTROL
AND THREE QUARTERS OF THEM FOUND THAT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE UGLY AND THAT A SORT OF EVEN HIGHER PROPORTION WOULD SPEND MORE FOR A SORT OF S UH A FANCIER REMOTE CONTROL
BUT AS SOON AS WE GOT SORT OF OVER ABOUT INTO A THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY AGE FORTY FIVE AGE GROUP AND OLDER
THERE'S A LOT MORE TH THERE'S A LOT LOT MORE OLDER PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THEY WANTED IT OR NOT AS WELL
UM WE ALSO ASKED WHAT FRUSTRATED PEOPLE ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS AND THE NUMBER ONE FRUSTRATION WAS THAT THE REMOTE WAS LOST SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE ROOM AND THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND IT
UM AND THAT WE SHOULD COME UP WITH FEWER BUTTONS THAN MOST OF THE CONTROLS ON THE MARKET
AND WE SHOULD SORT OF CONCENTRATE ON THE CHANNELS AND SORT OF POWER AND ALSO VOLUME AND THAT SORT OF THING AS AS LOUISA SAID
PERHAPS THE ONES THAT ARE GONNA BUY BUY OUR NEW PRODUCT IF WE AIM IT AT SORT OF YOU KNOW SORT OF A HIGH TECH DESIGN
AND WE COULD MAYBE THINK ABOUT USING SPEECH RECOGNITI RECOGNITION AS A WAY TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL IF IT'S LOST IN A ROOM
RATHER THAN SORT OF UM HAVING IT TO SPEECH RECOGNITION TO CHANGE THE CHANNELS
'CAUSE THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THAT IN THAT THE TELEVISION MAKES NOISE SO IT COULD END UP TALKING TO ITSELF AND CHANGING ITS CHANNEL
THEY S THEY SAID THAT THEY'D BE INTERESTED IN A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH OFFERED THAT POSSIBILITY AND AS YOU GO UP THROUGH THE AGE GROUPS
PEOPLE GOT LESS AND LESS INTERESTED IN SORT OF A A REMOTE CONTROL THAT YOU COULD TALK TO SO
YEAH WE'D HAVE T THAT WOULD MEAN WE'D HAVE TO PUT TWO PRODUCTS TOGETHER AS WELL WHICH WHICH AGAIN WOULD PROBABLY BE A BIT EXPENSIVE BUT
UM WOULD IT TAKE QUITE A WHILE TO SORT OF DEVELOP THE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE ON THE MARKET THAT DOES THAT SO
UH WE COULD POSSIBLY PUT AN L. A SORT OF A L. C. D. MENU IN BUT THAT AGAIN IS PROBABLY AN EXPENSE THAT
I S I SUPPOSE UM
UH
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THE SORT OF HAVING PEOPLE HAVE A BOOKLET 'CAUSE ONE THE SECOND MOST ANNOYING THING THAT PEOPLE FOUND WAS HAVING TO LEARN THE NEW ONE
YOU KNOW EACH OF THEM COULD HAVE A NUMBER AND THEN ALSO A FUNCTION WRITTEN NEXT TO IT SO YOU'RE BASICALLY PRESSING
SO TH THE
THE DETAILED ONES WOULD BE SORT OF BRIGHTNESS UH SORTA
AND PROBABLY A POWER ONE AS WELL
TWELVE TH YEAH SI ONE UP ONE DOWN
SORT OF S YOU KNOW SAYING THAT YOU WANT THAT PARTICULAR THING TUNED IN
SO YOU GO UP AND DOWN AND THEN IT PICK IT FINDS SOMETHING AND THEN YOU WANNA PRESS ENTER TO SELECT IT YEAH
UNLESS YOU WANT TO PLUG IT BACK IN TO YOURS
BUT THE WAY THAT I INTERPRET THAT UM IT DOESN'T SEEM TO SEND OUT A SIGNAL TO THE TELLY
SO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD EFFECT OUR CIRCUIT BOARD
'CAUSE THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY'VE GIVEN THERE IS GOOD MORNING COFFEE MACHINE GOOD MORNING JO
YEAH JUST AS A FUN WAY TO FIND IT
ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK IT REALLY SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT THE COST BUT IT SAYS THAT IT'S ALREADY IN THE COFFEE MACHINES SO
OH THAT WAS QUICK
UM I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT THE EXAMPLES OF THE SCROLL BUTTON THERE UM BUT THERE'S SOME CURVED CASES THAT YOU CAN SEE UH A RANGE OF SIZES UH
ALL OF THEM HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS THERE UM THEY SEEM TO JUST HAVE THE RUBBER BUTTONS
IT JUST SEEMS TO BE SKIPPING ON WITHOUT US DOING ANYTHING
AH IT'S ALRIGHT
AND UH IT WAS QUITE UH A SWISH MODEL WHERE IT CAN CONTROL UH FOUR DEVICES T. V. CABLE SATELLITE VIDEO D. V. D. AUDIO
I MEAN MAYBE IT'S BETTER NOT TO TRY AND COMPETE WITH THAT SORT OF THING AND JUST TO MARKET IT AS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT UM
UM THE SCROLL BUTTONS AS YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED UM
THERE'S EXAMPLES OF THOSE BUT THEY DON'T LOOK AS SLEEK AS OTHER MODELS
AND THERE'S NO REAL ADVANTAGE AND BECAUSE IT IMPACTS ON OTHER ON THE MATERIALS AND THE PRICE IT'S NOT GREAT
WHERE UM THEY JUST HAD A VERY LIMITED RANGE OF BUTTONS AND THEY WERE B UH BRIGHT AND COLOURFUL AND UM YOU YOU COULD PROGRAM THEM SO THAT THEY COULD ONLY LOOK AT CERTAIN CHANNELS
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S OUT THERE
AND BECAUSE OURS MIGHT NOT COVER THE SAME FUNCTIONS THAT THE LEADING BRANDS DO IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO MARKET IT AS A UM FINDER FUNCTION
UM YEAH I THINK UM I THINK WE'VE DECIDED THAT IT'S GONNA INCREASE THE COST AND GIVE NO REAL KINDA EXTRA BENEFIT AND IT'S GONNA DECREASE FROM THE SLEEKNESS OF IT
HMM UM AND JUST TO BE AWARE THAT THERE ARE KIND OF SPECIALIST FUNCTIONS AND SPECIALIST REMOTES BUT WE PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THOSE LIKE SUCH AS THE CHILDREN'S REMOTE
UM THERE WAS A MENTION JUST AS KIND OF A WARNING ABOUT BUTTON DESIGN
SO IT GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF SAY YOUR VOLUME BUTTONS FOR UP AND DOWN THEY MIGHT BOTH HAVE A V. ON FOR VOLUME
UM SOMEBODY MIGHT LOOK AT THIS ONE AND SAY OH WELL THIS TRIANGULAR BUTTON IS POINTING UP AND THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT THEY SEE
OH WELL NO THEY MIGHT SEE
YEAH THEY MIGHT SEE THIS POINTING DOWN AND THINK RIGHT THAT'S GONNA TURN THE VOLUME DOWN
WHEREAS THE ACTUAL BUTTON'S POINTING UP SO THE FUNCTION IS TO TURN THE BUTTON UP
SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PUT ON THE BUTTONS AND BE CAREFUL OF THE SHAPE THAT YOU MAKE THEM BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE KIND OF TWO UM
S
YEAH AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE OH BUT YOU STILL WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE LOGO ON EVERY NEW CASE
THAT SORT OF THING'D PROBABLY GO DOWN WELL AND THE MARKET RESEARCH HAS BEEN ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS HASN'T IT
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THESE THINGS LOOK LIKE
SEE HOW UH
SEE HOW UH THE ONE OH I'M NOT PLUGGED IN AM I
SHALL I JUST TURN IT ROUND FOR TIME
UM IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR UP THERE BUT YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THEM HAVE GOT KIND OF BULGES
LIKE THE SECOND ONE AND THE END ONE UH WHERE THERE'S A CURVE THERE
I'M NOT EXACTL I DON'T KNOW IF A DOUBLE CURVE IS MAYBE IT COMES UP SLIGHTLY OR
UM AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE COLOUR SCHEME OR LOGO YET DO WE BUT POSSIBLY A STICKER
YEAH AND AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION WE CAN USE THAT CAN'T WE JUST TO FIND IT
AH
AH JUST THE UH SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS
BUT UH IT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL SO MAYBE IN SORT OF UM
UH RIGHT SO
WISHING I HADN'T CLOSED THE DAMN RIGHT SO WE HAD THE FACT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE THE LOGO UH THE COMPANY LOGO IN ITS UH COLOUR SCHEME INCORPORATED ONTO THE THE DEVICE THE REMOTE DEVICE
AND THEN THE UH THE BACKUP FEATURES ON THE SECOND PAGE SO THAT IT COULD UH
AND THE CUSTOMERS WOULDN'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM TOO OFTEN ONLY AS AND WHEN REQUIRED
UH HAVE THERE BEEN ANY UH CHANGES
WHAT WOULD BE THE COST DO DO WE KNOW
SO WOULD IT NOT BE BEST TO RATHER THAN I MEAN ONE WAY IS TO DO EACH OF THE PRESENTATIONS AND THEN MAKE DECISIONS GOING BACK TO THE VARIOUS PRESENTATIONS AS THEY WERE
'CAUSE AT THAT POINT THEN YOU'VE GOT THE DETAILS UP THERE
THEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THAT DOWN THEN WE COULD MAKE THE DECISION AT THAT POINT IN TIME AND THEN THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THAT ISSUE
NO THE SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRED THE REGULAR SO THE
SO WE'RE GOING FOR P OKAY
SO IS UM
SO IF WE GO FOR THE SIMPLE PUSH BUTTON SO EFFECTIVELY WE'RE GOING FOR THE SIMPLE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD ARE WE
AND SO IF THERE IS ONE ELEMENT THAT REQUIRES THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONE
OR SAY THE REGULAR ONE OR THE MORE ADVANCED THEN THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE SAME FOR ALL OF THEM
S
AND HOW DOES IT GET UH CHARGED UP
SPEECH RECOGNITION YOU RECKON THEN IS S SIMPLE
AND SO WE WOULD WANT IT IN AS AN EXTRA BECAUSE IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO COST TOO MUCH
S
WELL WE'RE TO GO FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET RATHER THAN A LOCAL MARKET BUT THAT THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY PRECLUDE THE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN OFTEN DO WITH PRODUCTS IS YOU CAN UH MAKE SMALL MODIFICATIONS
BUT THAT'S REALLY WHERE YOUR FIELD IS
ANYWAY YOU COULD ADD ON FOR AN EXTRA PACKAGE
BUT ON THIS BASIC ONE I'M RECKONING THAT WE'RE GOING FOR THE BASIC MODEL TO BE DISCUSSED HERE AND THAT UH YOU WOULD HAVE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDING IN EXTRA FEATURES AT EXTRA COST TO TAKE CARE OF SPECIALIST MARKET SEGMENTS
IS THAT SO SO WHAT ARE WE DECIDING TO DO HERE
UH THE FI YEAH THE FINDER FUNCTION RATHER THAN AS A SPEECH FUNCTION TO FIND YOUR REMOTE
SO NOT TO BE FOCUSED ON
GOOD IN IN FLIP IT ROUND IN NINETY DEGREE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES AND HAVE IT UP AND DOWN
SO THAT WOULD SHOW THAT VOLUME WAS GOING UP WHEREAS THE ONE UNDERNEATH WOULD SEE THE VOLUME GOING DOWN
NO TH THAT THAT INCORPORATES THE TREND WHILST AT THE SAME TIME NOT CONFUSING PEOPLE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FUNCTIONALITY
BUT BUT TH BUT OKAY BUT YOU YOU CAN INCORPORATE THE TR IF Y IF YOU CHANGE ALL THE BUTTONS THEN YOU'VE GOT THE PROBLEM THAT THIS YEAR'S FRUIT AND VEG
NEXT YEAR'S UH I WAS GONNA SAY ANIMALS OR ELEPHANTS OR W WHATEVER
AH D D BUT IF MM-HMM
THE M THE MAIN PROBLEM IS HOW F HOW FREQUENTLY DO THE FASHIONS CHANGE
THEN IT MEANS THAT YOUR STOCK IS UM IS LAST YEAR'S STOCK AND THEREFORE YOU'RE SELLING IT OR HAVING TO SELL IT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE WHICH YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DO
WHEREAS IF YOU KEPT THE PRODUCT THE SAME BUT YOU COULD HAVE A DIFFERENCE FROM YEAR TO YEAR
UH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU COULD INCORPORATE A FASHION STATEMENT IF YOU LIKE RATHER THAN CHANGING THE WHOLE KIT AND CABOODLE
WELL YOU TWO ARE OBVIOUSLY GONNA FIND THAT OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY WHEN YOU MOVE OVER TO YOUR KIT MODELLING STAGE AS TO UH HOW MUCH PL HOW MUCH HOW MUCH HOW PLIABLE IS PLASTICINE
SO YOU'RE TALKING THERE ABOUT UH CHANGING
SOME IN RED SOME IN RATHER THAN ALL IN BLACK OR YOU KNOW WHICH FOUR DO YOU WANT AS LONG AS IT'S BLACK
YES OH THAT'S TRUE UH THAT MIGHT NO
I MEAN A LOT OF UM COMPUTERS FOR INSTANCE LIKE LIKE ON THE ONE YOU'VE GOT THERE
BUT THAT BADGE WOULD THEN HAVE TO STICK OUT ON TOP OF IT SO THAT UH IN A SENSE
WITH A WITH A LOGO LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S ON A WHITE BACKGROUND
THE ONLY COLOUR THAT IT MIGHT NOT STICK OUT SO WELL ON WOULD BE A WHITE CASING
AND IN FACT THE WAY THEY'VE GOT THAT THERE EVEN IF YOU HAD THAT ON A WHITE WHICH IS THE PREDOMINANT COLOUR OF THE UH THE WINDOWS BADGE
YOU'D STILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT CLEARLY FROM YOU KNOW A WHITE CASING UH PRODUCT
AND WE'RE SORT OF SAYING NO TO THAT
IF YOU'RE GOING FOR FASHION TRENDS LIKE THAT THEY'LL NEED T YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE INTERCHANGEABLE CASES SO THAT YOU COULD OR 'CAUSE OTHERWISE SOMEONE'S GONNA HAVE TO BUY A COMPLETE NEW REMOTE RATHER THAN JUST A CASE
ONE ONE THING TO CONS ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT IN SOME WAYS YOU WANT UM BY HAVING A FAIRLY STANDARD CASE IT MEANS THEY CAN ALL FIT TOGETHER ON TOP OF EACH OTHER THEREFORE FOR STORAGE PURPOSES IN SHOPS AND THE LIKE AND IT MAKES IT EASIER THAT YOU CAN IF YOU CAN STORE THEM UP ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
WHEREAS IF YOU DO UM FANCY THINGS WITH IT YOU THEN GOTTA PUT IT IN A CA A A PACKAGING BOX THAT THAT DOES THAT
S SO DO YOU WANNA GO FOR CURVES MORE CURVES
WE'RE MEANT TO BE F WE'RE MEANT TO BE FINISHING THIS MEETING IN ABOUT A MINUTE OR SO
AS WELL AS OR W OR WAS THAT
OKAY SO WHAT WHAT SHAPE ARE WE MAKING THE STANDBY BUTTON
A APPLE
IS IT
SORRY WHAT WAS THAT LAST THING AGAIN THERE
I GUESS YOU TWO ARE ON PLASTICINE DUTY OR WHATEVER
I THINK WE ALL HAVE A PRESENTATION AGAIN SO IF WE GO THROUGH THOSE AND THEN UM
UM I'LL GO ON TO MY FINDINGS IN EACH OF THESE AREAS
UH FIRST IN THE POWER SUPPLY WE HAVE THE OPTION OF JUST THE STANDARD BATTERY
THERE'S A KINETIC OPTION WHICH IF ANY OF YOU'VE SEEN THOSE NEW WATCHES WHICH YOU KIND OF YOU POWER UP BY WAVING AROUND
UM THAT'S ONE OPTION BUT I THINK THAT WAS GONNA COST A LITTLE MORE
FOR THE BUTTONS WE HAVE UM AN INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTON WHICH IS OH JUST TO SAY ALL ALL THESE ARE UM SUPPLIED BY REAL REACTION
SO I GUESS FOR THE EASE OF FOR QUICKNESS AND EASE WE SHOULD TAKE THEM FROM AT LEAST LIKE ONE OF THESE OPTIONS
UM SO FOR THE BUTTONS THERE'S AN INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTON WHICH I GUESS IS JUST THE SAME AS THE STANDARD ONES
UM ONE ISSUE FOR THE BUTTONS IS DEPENDING ON WHICH MATERIAL WE USE
UM THAT'S ON THE NEXT I TH I THINK THE THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE COST
BASICALLY FOR THE CIRCUIT BOARD WHICH IS THE MIDDLE IT'S JUST SEE IT DOWN THERE THE CHIPS LIKE THE LIKE THE WORKINGS OF THE ACTUAL UM OF THE REMOTE
THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SLIGHTLY MORE ADVANCED CIRCUIT BOARD THAN IF WE JUST HAD A STANDARD UM PUSH BUTTON
UM ONE FINAL THING WE CAME UP WITH WAS SOME INFORMATION ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
UM AND I GUESS THAT WOULD REQUIRE A MORE ADVANCED CIRCUIT BOARD SO THERE IS AN EXTRA PRICE IN THAT SENSE
THERE IS TH SORRY AN EXTRA COST IN THAT SENSE
MAYBE W
IS THERE
AS I SAY IT ONLY SPECIFIED THAT WE NEED A MORE ADVANCED CIRCUIT BOARD FOR THE SCROLL WHEEL
IT'S JUST THIS BIT AT THE BOTTOM WHICH I'VE HIGHLIGHTED
UM BUT THAT BIT
AND NOTE THAT THE PUSH BUTTON JUST REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP SO THAT WOULD KEEP THE PRICE DOWN
DID EVERYONE GET THIS ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
I'M GUESSING IT WOULD BUT GOT LIKE THE DEFINITE INFORMATION
OH THAT MAKES SENSE
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE SO WE'D STICK WITH THE SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD AND THEN THINK OF THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AS AN EXTRA
IT'S UM IT'S SOME ON WATCHES WHICH YOU YOU KIND OF YOU SHAKE TO POWER IT UP
UH YEAH I THINK DID WE DECIDE IT DIDN'T AFFECT THE CIRCUIT BOARD IT JUST AFFECTED
OH NO TH THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT BUT MAYBE MAYBE IT DOESN'T
IT'S IT'S JUST AN ADDITION THING IT'S UM YEAH
'KAY SHALL I PASS ON TO YOU NOW
IF YOU RIGHT CLICK AND THEN GO ONTO A PREVIOUS SLIDE
ON THE PRICE YEAH
SO YOU ALSO SAID FOR GOING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET UM THAT SOME SOME MAYBE OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
S S SO UM
YEAH WE GOT IT DOWN TO NOT TOO MANY
ARE WE ARE WE GONNA GO THROUGH THE DESIGN OF ALL THE BUTTONS AT THE MOMENT OR ARE WE GONNA T
WELL I DUNNO I I GUESS MAYBE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES MAY BE POPULAR AT THE MOMENT BUT AS WE KNOW HOW FICKLE THE FASHION MARKETS ARE MAYBE
I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS REALISTIC THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET ISN'T THE KIND OF THING WHICH TAKES IN
THOSE KINDS OF FASHION TRENDS
TO SOMETHING WHICH IS MAYBE MORE UNIVERSAL
UM OH NO NO NO SORRY IT'S IF YOU USE THE UH RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED CASE THEN YOU MUST USE RUBBER BUTTONS
THAT'S THE WAY ROUND
I SUPPOSE WE MAYBE ARE LIMITED IN THE FACT THAT WE STILL HAVE TO PUT THE LOGO ON THE ACTUAL WOULD OR NOT
YEAH THE A THE ACTUAL THE SORT OF THE LOOK FROM THE OUTSIDE SO WHERE THE BUTTONS WOULD STAY THE SAME
SO THEN TH TH THAT WOULD
MAYB
OH WE CA YEAH YEAH WE'LL STILL HAVE THE ARE WE GONNA GO FOR THE SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD JUST TO KEEP THE COST DOWN
AND SEE WE COULD ALWAYS DECIDE AGAINST IT IF SOMETHING COMES UP THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THAT WE SEEMED TO LEAVE OUT
IS THAT THE END
SO ARE WE GOING FOR THE W ARE WE GOING FOR THE SIMPLE ONE ARE WE
'CAUSE IT'S S IT'S SEPARATE ISN'T IT IT'S NOT PART OF THE
IN IN SORT OF BASICALLY FASHION ON TOP OF DOING THE UM RESEARCH INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET THE THE ONE THAT'S THE ONE I TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME
THAT WE'D SORT OF ASKED PEOPLE ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS AND WHAT WHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THEM WHAT WAS BAD WHAT THEY USED
AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN LOOKING AT SORT OF FA SORT OF FASHIONS AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE WANTING OUT OF CONSUMER GOODS AT THE MOMENT
AND THEN THIRD AND L LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER TWO THERE SHOULD BE AN EASE OF USE AS WELL
WE NEED TO EMPHASISE THE FANCY DESIGN WITH ON ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL ABOVE ALL ELSE
AND THEN WE NEED TO MA SORT OF MAKE IT EASY TO USE THAT'S AS A THIRD PRIORITY
SO PERHAPS UM FEWER FEWER BUTTONS AND FUNCTIONS AS WE'VE AS WE'VE DISCUSSED
RIGHT SO THAT'LL BE IT
I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT WHAT THE SORT OF TIMESCALE WE'RE THINKING OF SELLING THE PRODUCT OVER IS
YEAH I MEAN IT'S PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THE LOOK THEY WANT THE FANCY LOOKING THING BUT I'M
IT'S THE YOU KNOW IT'S A COMMUNICATION DEVICE PEOPLE SEE YOU WITH IT ALL ABOUT AND
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT
THAT'S RU RUBBER BUTTONS YEAH
APPLE
APPLE APPLE A A QU QUITE A BIG ONE AS WELL
UH
UM IT'S ALMOST CURVED LIKE UP TO THE MAIN DISPLAY AS WELL
AND THE LITTLE LINE AT THE BOTTOM INDICATES THE BIT THE PANEL THAT YOU PULL DOWN
AND IT'S KINDA NOT REALLY AT A KIND OF YOU THINK APPLE YOU THINK COMPUTERS LIKE APPLE MAC
AH THAT'S THE MUTE
YEAH AND WE CHOSE A V. PLUS AND V. MINUS
UH THAT'S IT
MAYBE IF YOU JUST MINIMISE THAT ONE IN THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE LITTLE BOX
S
D WOULDN'T YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE SIMPLE CHIP THERE AS WELL
YOU KNOW HOW YOU TURN THAT ONE TO A ZERO WOULDN'T THE CHIP AND THE SAMPLE SPEAKER BE SEPARATE THINGS SO YOU NEED BOTH OF THEM
BUT I DO THINK UH THE V UH VOICE RECOGNITION THING WOULD BE MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THE FACT THAT IT'S GOT NO BATTERY
HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE IF WE MADE THE CASE IN PLASTIC
IF THE BUTTONS ARE RUBBER THAT MIGHT BE SPONGY ENOUGH
WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S RUBBER AS IT IS ISN'T IT
YEAH THAT'S A BIT ROUGH AT THE MINUTE
UH WELL IT'S GOT THE SAME UM SPEECH FEATURE AS THE COFFEE MACHINE
WELL THE LOGO WOULD BE MORE UM RECOGNISABLE ON THE ACTUAL THING
AND IT DOES HAVE ATTRIBUTES THAT OTHER PRODUCTS DO
AYE
AH IT'S ON
NO I JUST WE GOT THE LOGO OFF THE WEB BROWSER
SHOULDN'T WE MAYBE LOSE A POINT ON FASHION GO TO A THREE
ON THE VOLUME ONES
DID WE DECIDE AGAINST THE APPLE BECAUSE OF APPLE MAC
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER EXAMPLE AT THE MINUTE
YOU WERE THE LEADER
AS MUCH AS YOURS
BUT I MEAN I D I DON'T I'M NOT SURE I SEE THE VALUE IN THESE
SO IS WHY NOT SAVE THAT
DO YOU WANT TO REPLACE EXISTING FILE NO
YEAH BUT I'VE TA UH RIGHT I'LL JUST RE DO IT
R RIGHT
AND SO WHEN I DONE MY THING ON COST A I HAD ASSUMED THAT THE ONLY UH BUTTON THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT COLOUR WOULD BE THE UH THE RED APPLE BUTTON
AND UH AS I SUPPOSE THAT SO WHETHER WANTED TO PUT IN ALL THESE COLOURS WOULD BE UH OPEN TO DEBATE I SUPPOSE
SO I GUESS W WE HAVE TO EVALUATE IF THAT MEETS THE VARIOUS UH ASPECTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR UH FROM UM OUR PREVIOUS MEETING
BUT OTHER THAN THAT WE GOT THE RED APPLE
WE GOT THE BUTTONS AND THE ONLY THING THAT HAS REALLY CHANGED IS THE IS THE COLOURATION OF THE BUTTONS
AND THE BIT AFTER THE EVALUATION CRITERIA IS UH IS THE FINANCE
SO UM AND THEN THE PRODUCTION EVALUATION AS TO HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE TO UH TO MANUFACTURE
SO UH AS FAR AS THE THE FINANCE OF IT WOULD BE CONCERN WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COST AYE THE PRODUCTION COST 'CAUSE YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST UH CONSIDERATIONS WAS TO BE IN D UNDER UM UH TWELVE FIFTY OR TWO AND A HALF UH TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
IS QUICKLY FIND THAT UH
WELL ORIGINALLY I THOUGHT THERE WOULD JUST BE UH ONE IN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONE RED APPLE
BUT SO THE SO THE REAL W THE REAL QUESTION THEN WOULD COME IN
WELL SO WE'VE GOT ONE SPECIAL BUTTON FORM WHICH WAS THE APPLE
AND THE R I MEAN EFFECTIVELY WE'VE GOT SIXTEEN BUTTONS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE ON THERE
WHAT'S THE OP THE OPTION WAS MAYBE NOT TO HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS BUT JUST TO HAVE THE ONE THAT WAS SOFT AND SPONGY AND THEREFORE
IF WE JUST HAD ALL THE BUTTONS AS STANDARD EXCEPT FOR THE ONE RED APPLE THEN THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT I GUESS
AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT UM THAT TOOK CARE OF THE UH OF THE VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS
AND IF WHAT HAPPENED
IF WE JUST DID SPECIAL SORRY YOU WERE SAYING THAT IT WOULD BE THAT ONE THAT YOU WOULD PUT IN ONE THERE
SO IT WELL IS IT S IS NO IT'S NINE POINT SEVEN I'VE GOT
THAT WOULD WORK OUT FINE IF UH
UH AS ASSUMING YOUR CORRECTION ARE ARE ASSUMING THAT THAT ONE CHANGE COVERS ALL THE BUTTONS THEN THAT WOULD BE FINE
AND THERE'S NOTHING ELSE AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THAT WE WE HAD UH PLANNED TO PUT ON
BUT REMEMBER THAT THE IDEA WAS TO KEEP IT THE COLOUR OF THE OH I SEE SO JUST TAKE OUT THE SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE APPLE AND
BUT YOU RECKON THAT I I MEAN THE THING IS THAT YOU WANTED TO A APPEAL TO PEOPLE AND NOT HAVE TO REPLACE BATTERIES
BUT WHICH DO YOU THINK OR WHICH DO WE THINK IS THE MORE IMPORTANT OF THE OPTIONS
THE OTHER OPTION IF WE'RE PLANNING ON JUST GOING FOR SOMETHING CHEAP AND CHEERFUL WOULD BE TO UM MAKE IT ORIGINALLY WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT A SIMPLE PRODUCT
OKAY BUT REMEMBER THE MAIN THE ONLY REASON WE WERE PLANNING ON HAVING THE VOICE RECOGNITION WAS SO THAT THEY COULD FIND THE REMOTE IF IT GOT LOST
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT W WE TOOK THAT OUT TOO
IN THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN WE DO HAVE KINETIC
THEN BECAUSE THAT THE OTHER FUNCTIONS WE'VE GOT IN ARE ARE MORE AT THE THE SPECIAL MATERIAL THE RUBBER WOOD TITANIUM ET CETERA
IF YOU GO FOR THAT TH THAT'S AT THE HIGH END 'CAUSE THAT'S POINT SIX WHEREAS DOWN AT UH JUST SPECIAL COLOURS UH IS POINT TWO
NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO LOSE ONE POINT TWO SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU'RE GOING FOR THE SAMPLE SENSORS SPEAKER
YOU'RE BASICALLY THEN HAVING TO GO FOR THE CHEAPER OPTIONS ON EVERYTHING ELSE
AND THEN YOU'RE LOOKING TO UH TAKE OUT UH POINT TWO WHICH WOULD BE COME FROM THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS CATEGORY
YOU COULD EITHER YOU COULD HAVE IT IF YOU HAVE A IN PLASTIC RATHER THAN RUBBER THEN THAT WOULD UH ENABLE YOU TO GET YOU COULD KEEP KINETIC THEN
YOU COULD KEEP YOUR SAMPLE SENSOR AND YOU'D BE LOOKING TO TAKE OUT POINT TWO
YE
IT'S RUBBER AS IT IS YES
THE NEXT ON WELL I CAN JUST SING ABOUT
THE PRODUCT IS A RECOGNISABLE REAL
R UH REACTION PRODUCT
S
SO WE'RE NOW ON TO CHANGING IT TO GET IT TO FIT IN WITH THE BUDGET REQUIREMENTS AND THEN
ABOUT A TWO
WELL YOU CAN LOSE ONE POINT TWO AND STILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS
OKAY WELL I PUT IT BACK ON
OKAY SO WHAT WAS IT CONTROL UH F. EIGHT WASN'T IT
HOW KIND
YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE THERE OF GOING DOWN TO BATTERY WHICH WOULD SAVE YOU ONE
WELL UH W UH THERE WAS DEBATE AS TO HOW YOU WOULD COUNT THEM
'CAUSE OUR PLAN REALLY WAS TO HAVE ONE BUTTON ONLY WITH A SPECIAL SO SO NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SAME
SO SPECIAL COLOUR YOU WANT THREE IN THERE
AND WE'VE GOT SPECIAL FORM IS THE ONE APPLE
I WAS PRESUMING BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES OR WERE YOU
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT R WELL
SO YOU'D MAYBE PUT FASH FAN UH FASHION AT THREE RATHER THAN TWO
YEP I WOULD S
YOU MEAN OF
SO NEXT YEAR YOU COULD MAKE NEXT YEAR'S MODEL THE SAME BUT HAVE IT AS A A YEAH WHATE WHATEVER A LEMON
YEAH WE'VE THE MAIN THING WE'VE CHANGED REALLY IS THE CASING ISN'T IT
WELL EASE HAS CERTAINLY STAYED
HOW IT WOULD PLAY OUT YEAH
WELL BUT YOU'VE GOT THE COMPANY LOGO ON THERE WHICH WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE A STICK ON BADGE
AND THEN Y BUT YOU'VE GOT THE SPACE FOR IT TO STICK IT ON
THERE'S VIRTUALLY N THE WAY THAT YOU FRAME YOU KNOW THE WINDOWS BADGE ON THERE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COLOUR IT IS
SO LONG AS OUR COMPANY'S LOGO IS FRAMED W IN THE SAME WAY AS THAT WITH A LIKE A BLACK OUTLINE
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT EFFECTIVELY A DOUBLE EDGING ON THE UH ON THE LOGO IT MEANS THAT IT SPLITS OFF WHAT YOUR LOGO IS FROM THE FROM THE PRODUCT
M MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE CASE
BU BUT BUT UH WAS THE WAS THERE NOT A BUTTON THAT YOU WERE THINKING OF ON THE UM ON THE OTHER OPT YOU KNOW
ON THE SECOND PAGE AS IT WERE THAT UH YOU WERE THINKING OF MAYBE HAVING AS A DIFFERENT COLOUR
SO WHAT BIT ARE WE ON TO
I TH I TH OH
SO WE'RE NOW ON TO PROJECT PROCESS
ON TO THE EVALUATION OF THE COURSE RATHER THAN THE EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT IS M MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT
IN YOU ON YOUR OWN
MM THE ONLY THING YOU FIND IS IN A MANUFACTURING PROCESS
WHEREAS THIS TIME YOU'RE REALLY GETTING IT FROM A DATABASE SOURCE SO IT'S NOT UH WELL UH ANYWAY
UM UM FLOW OF INFORMATION ON ON ANY GIVEN SUBJECT GIVEN SUBJECT UM SOMETIMES DISJOINTED
YOU HAVE TO DO IT WITHIN A SET TIME FRAME IS THE OTHER THING SO
I TH I UH D
YOU GOT A PROBLEM SO YOU GO TO YOUR TUTOR AND FIND OUT INFORMATION TO SEE HOW TO GET IT FIXED
SO WHAT SHE'S DOING IS SHE'S HAVING TO SPEND A DAY AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL AT ONE END SO THAT ANY STUDENT THAT COMES ALONG CAN UH ASK WHATEVER QUESTION
AND THEN YOU OR THE IDEA IS THAT THE WHICHEVER UH PERSON'S AT THE OTHER END CAN POINT THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
EITHER AT THE LIBRARY OR UH OR OR COME BACK OR GO AND SEE JOE BLOGGS OR WHATEVER
NEW IDEAS FOUND DID WE FIND ANY NO
TO UH GO UH REASONABLY WELL
BIT BIT ARBITRARY
SO WE'RE M WE'RE MEANT TO COMMENT ON LEADERSHIP AND THE MEANS E. G. WHITEBOARD DIGITAL PENS ET CETERA
AND AND NEW I NEW IDEAS FOUND WAS THE THE OTHER THING
NOW I'D MUCH RATHER BE IN MARKETING BUT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET THIS UH COMPUTER TO WORK AS WELL AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED
HOWEVER UM ALRIGHT UH MEANS SO WHITEBOARD UM SO REALLY IT'S UH EQUIPMENT
NEW IDEAS FOUND SO ONE OR TWO
UH WAS IT VOICE ACTIVATED UM
IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED YES
UH SO WE DON'T RE SO REALLY
I TRIED TO SAVE THIS THE LAST TIME AT TWELVE POINT THREE AND IT DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE SAVED ANYWHERE
FOR THE FIRST TIME WELL IT WAS HARD TO GET THE H UM THE ACTUAL LABELLING ON THE INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS
SO YOU'VE GOT THE VOLUME IN ORANGE ON DESIGN THERE AND THE THE CHANNEL IS IN BLUE
COULD WE GET THIS ON THE BOARD JUST SO WE CAN SEE OR DO YOU MEAN DO YOU HAVE THE FIGURES THERE
SO THAT'S NINE POINT ONE THERE SO WE'VE GOT SOME
I SWITCHING AROUND THOSE TH UM ON THE ELECTRONICS WE GOT THE SAMPLE SENSOR
AT THE MOMENT WE'VE JUST GOT THE SIMPLE CHIP WHICH COSTS ONE
AND MAYBE GO WITH THE ONE THE SPECIAL FORM BUTTONS THEN WE COULD HAVE THE SPEECH
SO UH MAYBE IF WE GOT RID OF LIKE THE MAYBE ONE OF THE SPECIAL COLOURS
OH POSSIBLY YEAH YEAH MAYBE
WE SHOULD YEAH THAT WOULD SAVE US ONE THOUGH WE'D STILL BE SLIGHTLY OV
SO YOU GOTTA DECIDE WHICH OF THOSE IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THEM
AND IF WE HAD EITHER OF THOSE FOR OUR BUDGET THEY BOTH SHOW A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF SPEECH RECOGNITION
NO WE C CA YEAH WE CAN'T AFFORD BOTH
NO MAY IS MAYBE ABOUT NEUTRAL PLUS IT IT IT'S GOT SOMETHING BUT IT HASN'T GOT
YEAH M UM YEAH IT WAS JUST DOING IT QUITE WELL
UM I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOSE SOME OF THESE BUT THE MOMENT AS IT STANDS IT'S UM
ALSO IT'S KIND OF SPONGY RUBBERINESS IS MAYBE BIT MORE KINDA COMFORTABLE THAN KINDA SLEEK AND NEW AGE
UH D
SO SHOULD WE GET SO ARE DEFINITE WAS IT THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN WAS THE DEFINITE PRICE RULE IF HAS
YEAH YEAH WE'LL MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS AND THEN SEE HOW ARE RATES ARE GOING
OH ACTUALLY WE JUST HAVE A PLASTIC CASE THEN WE LOSE TWO POINTS WHICH GETS US UM
IN RIGHT WITHIN THE BUDGET RANGE
SO WE'D LOSE A LITTLE BIT ON THE MAYBE KIND OF
OH YEAH AND THAT WOULD NOW BE YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WITHIN THE BUDGET
BUT THE BUT BUT BUT THE
I GUESS WE'D HAVE THE ONES WHICH ARE BLUE AT THE MOMENT WOULD WOULD JUST BE THE STANDARD COLOUR
YEAH WHICH I THINK WE SHOULD YEAH THEY'LL STILL BE FINE FOR THE FOR THE PRICE
NE UH
THEN THERE'S A SPE A SECOND SPECIAL FORM
WELL YOU GOT YOU GOT TWELVE
AND SPECIALLY IT DEFINITELY COULD FITS THE THE REAL PRODUCT WHAT WAS THE WHAT'S THE COMPANY NAME
R YEAH
I MEAN IT STILL SEEMS DEFINITELY FIT THAT P SO THAT'S LIKE IF THAT'S THE NEW AGE KIND OF UM INNO INNOVATIVE
I THINK WE'VE SAVED QUITE A BIT BECAUSE WE'VE JUST GOT THE PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE WHICH IS BY FAR THE CHEAPEST
AND EVERYTHING ELSE HAS STAYED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SO
YEAH PLUS IF ANYTHING THAT IS SPECIAL FORMS MAKES IT SLIGHTLY EASIER TO
TO USE
UM WELL WE'VE STILL GOT THE KINETIC ENERGY
BUT I THINK MORE THE THE FEATURES OF THE ACTUAL CONTROL WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN MAYBE THAN THE THE ACTUAL AESTHETICS BUT
BUT EITHER WAY I THINK WE'VE MADE IT FAIRLY CLOSE TO WHAT
YEAH MAYBE WE'VE M
MAYBE FOR THE THE ONE THEY'RE GONNA SEE ALL THE TIME WE MAKE IT LOOK GOOD AND UM FIT THE KIND OF IDEA OF WHAT THEY WANT
WE DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT AND JUST HAVE THAT AS LIKE A PLUS IT'S HIDDEN AWAY ANYWAY YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE IT AT THE START
UH
AND WE SEEM TO HAVE LEAST SOMETHING IN EACH CRITERIA
WE HAVEN'T COMPLETELY LEFT ANYTHING OUT SO
AS AN OVERALL PRODUCT WHICH HAS TO BE QUITE CHEAP WE'VE JUST ABOUT ACHIEVED
YEAH I SUPPOSE AND THEN BE GOING OUT AND FINDING MORE INFORMATION EACH TIME AND THEN DIFF THINGS WILL BE RELEVANT
IS THIS GO IT KINDA KIS FITS THE PURPOSE THAT IT WAS SOMETHING EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT AND THEN
SOMETHING WE CAN AT LEAST LOOK AT AND THINK HOW WE CAN IMPROVE ON
ONE OF THOSE THINGS
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS BUT I GUESS THAT SOMETHING GOT SENT OUT AND HAVE LIKE A BRIEF TO KIND OF
I THINK THERE'S ONE ONE MORE TO GO
LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MADE IT A LITTLE EASIER
YEAH SO IT'S JUST LIKE THE SAME PRODUCTS BUT JUST PUT TOGETHER IN A DIFFERENT WAY
IS THAT EVERYTHING
'CAUSE THAT'S THE SAVE ONE ISN'T IT SO
AND THEN FIND IT
YOU PASS IT ROUND TO HAVE A LOOK
WHAT'S THAT ONE THERE
SO IF YOU HAD TO DO A PRESENTATION OR WILL YOU JUST WORK IT ON THE PROTOTYPE
THAT'S THE PR
WE COULD DO IT AS WE D GO ALONG THE PRODUCTION COSTS LOOKING AT THE PROTOTYPE
WELL DO WE'LL DO IT ON THE PROTOTYPE SO DO TWO SEE HOW MUCH IT IS
I THINK YOU JUST DO ONE DON'T YOU FOR THE
ELSE
I THI I THINK I THINK THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENT I IS JUST A SUPPLEMENT FOR ALL THE BUTTONS MADE IN A DIFFERENT MATERIAL RATHER THAN PER BUTTON
IT'S ON THE BOTTOM ROW
YEAH WE HAVE TO HAVE IT
SHALL WE SHALL WE EVALUATE THE PROTOTYPE AS WE'VE GOT IT NOW FIRST AND THEN SORT OF MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED AFTER
SO WE'VE ALL GOT A NOTE OF IT'S THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN ISN'T IT WITH EVERYTHING WE WANT ON
YEAH I JUST HAD A PRESENTATION TO
AND THOSE ONES ARE GONNA BE IN RESPONSE TO SORT OF MARKET RESEARCH AND ALSO FINANCE I GUESS
AND DO THAT ON A SCALE FROM SAY TRUE BEING ONE AND FALSE BEING SEVEN SO IF IT'S NEITHER TRUE NOR FALSE THEN THAT'S FOUR
AND I HAVE TO GO UP ONTO THE WHITEBOARD AND DO THIS APPARENTLY SO I'LL GO OVER HERE
OF BUT I THINK WHAT IS ONE FALSE OR IS T ONE TRUE
SO FALSE IS SEVEN TRUE IS ONE AND
OKAY WELL D YOU DO AN AVERAGE AT THE END I DON'T KNOW
YEAH SO THAT SO SH SHOULD WE GO FOR A A TWO ON THAT
SO WHAT ABOUT THE PR THE PROTOTYPE AS IT IS WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION ON IT HAVEN'T WE
SO IT DOESN'T IT'S PRETTY THE PROTOTYPE AS IT IS ISN'T SORT OF UM FULFILLING THE
S
I'M JUST GONNA CHECK EXACTLY WHAT IT SAID IN THE EMAIL FOR UM
I JUST READ THE EMAIL AGAIN AND IT SORT OF SAYS IT'S EVALUATE THE DESIGN SORT OF AS IT IS I THINK
SO I MEAN DOES THIS NEED TO GO UP A BIT OR SOMETHING 'CAUSE WE'VE GOT BOTH THE
AND THE NEXT ONE IS I'LL HAVE TO GET IT BACK UP NOW
IS IT SORT OF A RECOGNISABLE PRODUCT
WHAT DO Y
YEAH WE S YEAH I THINK WE SORT OF ADD THEM UP SO SORT OF AT AN AVERAGE IS GONNA BE I'M JUST GONNA DO THIS IN MY HEAD
ONE POINT EIGHT ISN'T IT OR SOMETHING
DO YOU WANNA PLUG IT INTO YOURS SO WE CAN GET UP THE
LOSE A LITTLE BIT ON THE FASHION YEAH BUT
ONE ORIGINAL COLOUR AND THEN SORT OF TWO SUPPLEMENTS I THINK MAYBE
SO WE ONLY NE WE ONLY NEED TWO FOR THAT
OKAY SO THA
UH
SO IT'S W IF WE'VE IF WE'VE PUT IN FOR ANOTHER SPECIAL FORM ON A BUTTON THEN MAYBE THEY COULD BE A DIFFERENT SHAPE
LIKE WE GOT A CHERRY ONE
SEEING AS WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW WE'VE MADE IT A A SPECIAL FORM
SO AND THAT WOULD SORT OF MAYBE KEEP US CLOSE ON THE SORT OF THE FASHION TYPE ONE
SO WE'VE WHAT HAVE WE WHAT HAVE WE RID OF
WE GOT RID OF
IS IT THE RUBBER
SO I MEAN WE'VE GOT WE GOT RID OF THE RUBBER CASE BUT
WE'VE NOW S WE NOW SORT OF GOT AN EXTRA FORM AND AN EXTRA COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS
WE COU
OR WOULD THAT BE T
SO IT MAY BE SORT OF DIFFERENT COLOUR BUTTONS ISN'T SO IMPORTANT
SAME SORT OF FUNCTION
WELL BUT I THINK WE SAID THAT W
BECAUSE YOU GOT RID OF THE RUBBER WE PUT AN EXTRA AN EXTRA SORT OF FRUIT UM SHAPE ON ONE OF THE BUTTONS
OR WAS IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
WELL WE'RE AIMING FOR UM ONE FOR ALL OF THEM
M BUT IT REALLY HAS TO FIT INTO THE BUDGET SO
IN BE IN BETWEEN THE MEETINGS AND THEY DIDN'T THE ONE MEETING DIDN'T ALWAYS FOLLOW ON FOR THE OTHER ONE
YOU KNOW YOU'D SORT OF YOU'D PROBABLY PRESENT IT AT ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR PRODUCTS ON THEIR WEBSITE HERE REAL REACTION I MEAN IT'S ALL PRETTY HIGH TECH AND CUTTING EDGE
COMPUT COMPUTERS COULD BE A BIT DIFFICULT AT TIMES BUT
I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE THERE'S A LITTLE UM CHI
S
IF EVERYONE COULD GO AROUND AND EXPLAIN THEIR ROLE AND UM AND THEIR NAME
IS ONE THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING TODAY UM UM AS WELL AS PLANNING THE PROJECT HOW WE'RE GOING TO
UM WE WANT THIS TO BE A MARKETABLE PRODUCT THAT CAN BE TRENDY UM A COMPLETELY NEW STYLE SO THAT
UM CAN REALLY APPEAL TO A TO A GENERATION THAT DOESN'T WANT A SIMPLE PLAIN KIND OF UH CHANNEL CHANGER
FOR PEOPLE THAT UM CAN'T SEE THE NUMBERS AS WELL OR UM PERHAPS AN ERGONOMIC DESIGN
I BELIEVE I SHOULD BE TAKING MINUTES ON THIS RIGHT NOW
WE CAN COME TOGETHER IN A MEETING AND AND DISCUSS WHAT WHAT UM WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONAL DESIGN WE WANT TO USE
SAME WITH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DETAILED DESIGN
MAKING SURE THAT IT IT'S USABLE THAT AS A UM
TO COME UP WITH A CONCEPT OF IT WANT WHAT WE WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE
IS IS EVERYONE UM
ONE THING THAT UH WE'RE GOING TO DO IS BECOME MORE ACQUAINTED WITH THE THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO FOR OUR PROJECT
UM ONE OF THEM IS OUR WHITEBOARD
AND UM AS A SORT OF TEAM BUILDING MOMENT UM I I'D LIKE US TO
UM TRY OUT THE WHITEBOARD BY EXPRESSING OUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND THE CHARAC CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
RIGHT NOW IT IS AN ELK
THAT'S A SKETCHING OF MY MY ELK AND IT IT IS MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE IT IS A LARGE BEAUTIFUL MAJESTIC CREATURE
YEA
UM WE'D LIKE TO UM
TO UH MAKE FIFTY MILLION EURO
UM WE WANT IT TO COST UH ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM OF TWELVE EURO AND FIFTY CENTS
SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE SO FAR A UM YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS
SO WHAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD UH DO TO REMEDY THAT
ANY IDEAS WILL DO THAT YOU HAVE AT THIS POINT
I MEAN YOU'RE THE DESIGNERS YOU C YOU CAN UM DECIDE WHAT KIND OF UM DIRECTION YOU WANNA GO IN
BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE IN THE FIRST MEETING IT CAN BE ANY IDEAS THAT WE JUST THROW OUT THERE
UM LIKE YOU CAN GO OVER YOUR IDEAS OF COURSE IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL TIMES
GOT THOSE NOTES
OH TO GO FIRST
OH ARE WE ALL DOING IT INDIVIDUALLY
DO YOU HAVE ELK WHERE YOU COME FROM
SHEEP
BIT MORE CARTOON STYLE
UH I RECKON THEY'RE SORT OF THEY GOT IT SORTED
I'LL RUB THAT OUT
OOH
I ALWAYS FIND THAT IN OUR HOUSE THE REMOTE CONTROL ALWAYS GOES MISSING
I SUPPOSE IF WE'RE HE HEADING TO HAVE IT LIKE MAKE A HUGE PROFIT OUT OF THIS IT NEEDS TO BE QUITE A UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED THING
AN ELK
I THINK MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL WOULD BE A DOG BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW TO DRAW ONE
A S I DON'T EV OH OH WELL
THAT THIS THAT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A DOG
YOUS KNOW WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
UM I LIKE DOGS BECAUSE UM THEY'RE SO GOOD TO HUMANS
CATS DON'T REALLY LIKE ME SO I CAN'T LIKE THEM
BUT THEY'RE JUST SO FRIENDLY AND WARM AND NICE ANIMALS THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT
HI I'M GENEVIEVE
I'M AN EXPERT AT MARKETING
UH OH WE HAVE A GOOD ARTIST
OH VERY SHAPELY
TARA
OR TARA
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY THE PRETTIEST BUTTERFLY I'VE EVER SEEN OUT IN THE WILD AND I THOUGH THAT WAS PRETTY COOL IN SCOTLAND
BUT THIS PART WAS ALL BROWN AND THEN IT HAS THESE BIG BLUE DOTS LIKE THIS
AND THEN IT KINDA THERE WAS A GREEN I THINK IT WAS A GREEN RING AND THERE WAS LIKE RED GOING OUT LIKE THIS
AND IT LANDED BY A WALL AND LET ME LOOK AT IT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES
UH WHAT DO WE OH
YES I DO
I FIND THAT IN THE DARK IT'S OFTEN HARD TO KNOW WHAT BUTTON YOU'RE PUSHING
THERE'S SOME REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE THERE'S KIND OF A HIDDEN PANEL SO ALL THOSE BUTTONS THAT YOU DON'T REALLY USE UNLESS YOU'RE PROGRAMMING OR SOMETHING
OH INDUSTRIAL
AM I STARTING NOW
UM AND UM I'LL BE TAKING MINUTES ON THIS ONE AND UM BEING HOOKED UP TO THE POWERPOINT FOR THIS MEETING ISN'T VERY NECESSARY FOR UH MYSELF
SO THAT UM SOMEONE COULD HAVE THIS PRODUCT FOR AS LONG AS THEY FELT THAT THEY WANTED IT
AND THEN ONCE THEY CONTRIBUTE IT THEN THAT COMPANY CAN BREAK DOWN THE PART THE PARTS BETTER
WOULD WE BE THE COMPANY THAT WOULD BREAK DOWN THESE OR UH METALS
UM WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF THAT CAN MEET OUR FINANCIAL GOALS AS WELL
I'M SORRY COULD YOU THOSE WERE UM
SO THOSE ARE WHAT UM WE'LL C CONSTRUCT THE REMOTE
THOSE ARE ALL THE
AND UM THE NEXT PRESENTER WILL BE TARA
BECAUSE I FIND WITH UM CHANNEL CHANGERS THAT UM A LOT OF THE NUMBERS GET RUBBED DOWN IF THEY'RE PRINTED ON THE BUTTON
I HAVEN'T USED IT BEFORE BUT
UM AGES LIKE FROM THIRTY FIVE TO SIXTY FIVE WHICH SHOW LOWER NUMBERS PROBABLY WON'T BE AS CONCERNED
BECAUSE IF PEOPLE CAN ACTIVATE THE TELEVISION WITH THEIR VOICE THEN THEY WON'T BE USING A THEY WON'T BE TALKING INTO A REMOTE I'M SURE
I HAVE NO IDEA STILL
OH ON THE REMOTE
AND IF ONE OF THE LARGEST UH OR MOST COMPLAINED ABOUT THING IS THAT IT TAKES SO LONG TO GET TO KNOW HOW TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL
I'M SURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN OR REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE JUST FURTHERING THAT PROBLEM
YEAH I DO
SO UM ALL THE REMOTE CONTROLS MUST HAVE OUR UM WE'LL INCORPORATE OUR LOGO AND COLOUR IN IN SOME WAY
UM IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE COLOUR OF OUR UM OF OUR COMPANY BUT ANOTHER THING IS THAT UM
UM I'M ASSUMING THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ONE BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS MEETING I I WASN'T OFFERED A
LIKE A TYPE OF LOGO OR COLOUR SO IF THAT COULD BE UM SOMEWHERE ON THE DESIGN SO THAT WE CAN BE RECOGNISABLE
UM YES THOSE ARE THE CHANGES
BUT UM YOU KNOW WE COULD DISCUSS UM THOSE OTHER OPTIONS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP GENEVIEVE
IS THAT HOW MOST PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THAT
I KNOW FOR ONE THAT IN NORTH AMERICA THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TELETEXT SO IT'D BE REALLY SUPERFLUOUS
DO YOU KNOW IF ANYWHERE ELSE HAS IT
I THINK WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GO AHEAD WITH THE ALARM SYSTEM IDEA THAT YOU HAD
THE BUTTON OH
YEAH IT WOULD HAVE T
THAT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT YOU'LL HAVE TO SORT THAT OUT
UM THE GLOW IN THE DARK FLUORESCENT WHATEVER SYSTEM UM IS A GO AHEAD
IS EVERYONE INTERESTED IN THAT
'CAUSE I D I DON'T THINK THAT GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL UM LIKE THE ACTUAL SOFT PLASTIC UM COSTS THAT MUCH MORE THAN OTHER COLOURS
BETTER FOR PEOPLE WITH UM ELS NO WHAT'S IT CALLED R. S. I. WHAT WAS IT THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
OR WE CAN HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER
IS ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT
THAT COMPLETES MOST OF OUR UM OUR MORE UH PRACTICAL DECISIONS
YOU'D JUST GET ONE MOULD
THROW SOME PLASTIC IN IT YOU KNOW
SO IF IT TAKES OFF THEN WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL TRY THAT OUT
LIKE AS OF YET THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH UM THE WAY IT'LL LOOK
UM DOES IT NEED TO BE REACHED A DE DO WE NEED TO REACH A DECISION ON THAT RIGHT NOW
IS IT DOES IT NEED TO BE UH DECIDED ON NOW
SORRY ABOUT THIS GUYS
IS ON
UH ON A FUNCTIONAL SIDE OF THINGS WE FOUND OUT THAT WH FROM OUR PREVIOUS MEETING
SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE COULD BRING THIS IN UM TECHNICALLY
OR WE COULD USE FLUORESCENT MATERIALS WHICH WOULD JUST UM TAKE IN THE LIGHT DURING THE DAY
UM OOP
UM ANOTHER THING I THINK WE D MISSED OUT ON ON THE LAST MEETING WAS THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OUR DESIGN
SO UM THE BENEFITS OF THIS FOR OUR PRODUCT WOULD BE THAT WHEN IT CAME TO THE END OF ITS PRODUCT LIFE
I MEAN THE USER WOULD RETURN THE P PRODUCT TO THE COMPANY 'CAUSE IT'S THE PRODUCT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO GET RID OF WHAT THEY'VE MADE
UM AND THEN THE COMPANY COULD THEN JUST USE MAKE USE OF THIS SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS TO SPLIT UP THE COMPONENTS
SOMETHING LIKE THE CASE IF IT'S SCRATCHED OR SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT TO REUSE IT
BUT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO MELT IT DOWN AND REUSE IT AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE
NOT EVERY NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT OF EVERYTHING WE PRODUCE BUT
BECAUSE OF THIS THEIR PROPERTIES ARE SMART MATERIAL
SO I SUPPOSE IT DOES NEED LIKE HIGH CONTACT YEAH YOU KNOW HIGH UH QUALITY MACHINERY AND VERY SPECIFIC MACHINERY BUT
THIS'LL BE HOW IT UH WILL ACTUALLY WORK
YEAH IT'S JUST INFORMATION THAT UM LIKE TELEVISION TIMETABLES WHAT'S ON WHAT'S ON NOW WHAT'S ON NEXT ON EVERY CHANNEL AND
OH I'M GUESSING THAT'S WHAT IT IS
WHAT WHAT WOULD APPEAR ON THE SCREEN
LIKE LINKED IN WITH THE TELETEXT OR SORT OF LIKE AN
COMPLICATED JUS COMPLICATING THINGS EVEN FO MM
IF DO YOU MEAN THE THE LINK BETWEEN THE WELL IF THE BUTTON WAS ACTUALLY ON
PR PROBABLY
Y
AND ALSO Y UH HEATHER YOU MENTIONED BEFORE UM LIKE HOW IT SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY
AND AS YOU'RE SAYING LIKE NUMBERS CAN WEAR OFF IF THEY'RE JUST SORT OF LIKE PAINTED ON YOU KNOW PRINTED
LIKE IT COULD BE BLUE OR GREEN OR YELLOW OR LIKE WE'VE JUST LIMITED T WITH THE JUST ORDINARY PHOSPHORESCENT SO
EVERY TIME THE THAT IT LIT UP YOU C THAT COULD LIGHT UP AS WELL
OR OR THE WHATE
IS
UM ALS
IS IT UH FUNCTION EIGHT YEAH
UM MULTIFUNCTIONAL CONTROLS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO USE AS THE MULTITUDE OF BUTTONS CAN BE CONFUSING
A SINGLE FUNCTION REMOTE CONTROL IS SIMPLER TO USE BUT IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS FOR YOUR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES
AND PROBABLY MORE SELLABLE JUST BECAUSE IT'S MORE COMPATIBLE WITH A R A WIDER RANGE OF DEVICES
NO LI YEAH
UH PROBABLY JUST TUNING IN THE CHANNELS WOULD IT BE
YOU KNOW IF YOU GET A NEW T. V. SET YOU TUNE IN ALL THE CHANNELS DO YOU TH DO YOU THINK
COULD IT IT IT WOULD BE GOOD IF IT HAD THE ACTUAL PROGRAMME THAT WAS ON AND WHAT WAS NEXT
BUT IF IT WAS ON YOUR T. V. YOU'D WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT IF
SO IS IT JUST OKAY
YOU'D HA
C 'CAUSE THEN IT WOULD ONLY BE A APPLICABLE TO ONE T. V. SET SO IT WOULD NEED TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD STICK SOMEWHERE OR SOMETHING
WOULD IT NEED A BATTERY THEN
Y COULD BUY EXTRA
IF W
CH OH I SEE
SO AS FAR AS WE KNOW UM A SINGLE FUNCTION TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL IS US USABLE INTERNATIONALLY
YEAH I THINK I AGREE WITH THE SINGLE DESIGN THING FOR NOW BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO MUCH THAT IF WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A UNIQUE
YES I AM
OH I'M NOT HOOKED UP BUT OTHER THAN THAT COMPLETELY READY
UM IF YOU ALL REMEMBER FROM THE EMAIL WE GOT BEFORE OUR VERY FIRST UH KICK OFF MEETING WITH THE COFFEE MACHINE
OH AND FIRSTLY I WANTED TO REMIND YOU ABOUT OUR COMPANY MOTTO AND PURPOSE
UM AND WE SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKING TO TRENDS IN CLOTHING AND INTERIOR DESIGN
NOT JUST IN ELECTRONIC FASHION
ANY TRENDS THAT ARE GOING ON IN IN THE PUBLIC EVEN MEDIA YOU KNOW WHO'S FAMOUS
UM THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DIDN'T SPECIFY IF THEY LOVE THEM OR FOUND THEM YOU KNOW NEUTRAL
SO THE POWER BUTTON OBVIOUSLY IN AN HOUR IS ONLY USED ONCE
CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES ON AVERAGE PER HOUR
UM SO OBVIOUSLY WHEN COMMERCIALS COME ON THEY'RE CHANGING IT SO AS YOU SAID WE WANT A DURABLE BUTTON THAT'S NOT GONNA RUN DOWN
RELEVANCE OF THAT BUTTON OUR USERS FOUND WAS UH TEN TEN OUT OF TEN
UH DITTO FOR VOLUME SELECTION SO TEN OUT OF TEN
AND IT'S USED ON AVERAGE FOUR TIMES AN HOUR
UM AUDIO SETTINGS IS USED ON AVERAGE ZERO POINT EIGHT TIMES AN HOUR
WE'RE GETTING TO SPECIFIC STATISTICS HERE
IS THAT
UM AND HAS A R A HIGH RELEVANCE OF SIX POINT FIVE
SO IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA WANT TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON AND INCLUDE ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL
HOW WE COULD HAVE A AN ALARM SYSTEM SO THAT PEOPLE CAN FIND IT
AH
IS THAT WHAT IT IS
UM MAYBE OUR
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO ALSO AVOID YOU KNOW BUTTONS RESPONDING TO THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH AS WELL
A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE PUBLIC WOULD PAY FOR VOICE RECOGNITION ON THE REMOTE CONTROLS
NINETY ONE POINT TWO PERCENT SAID THAT THEY WOULD PAY EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE VOICE RECOGNI VOICE RECOGNITION INCLUDED ON THEIR REMOTE CONTROL
SO I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AGE GROUP WE'RE WE'RE TARGETING AND IF AND IF VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETHING WE WANNA LOOK INTO
SO IT M IT MAY BE TOO COMPLICATED FOR US BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND ANYWAY
AND TH THE LAST THING HERE WAS A AN L. C. D. SCREEN
UM AN L. C. D. SCREEN THOUGH MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN SHIFT THROUGH PAGES KIND OF LI THE WAY THIS POWERPOINT IS WORKING
S OR LIKE UM
OH JUST LIKE AN ELECTRONIC SCREEN
THERE WOULD BE LIKE A LITTLE LIKE ON YEAH
LIKE ON THE TOP OF A CELLPHONE THE THE LITTLE L. C. D. SCREEN
UM NOW THAT'S I I DUNNO EXACTLY WHAT EXACTLY WE'D PUT ON THERE
I GUESS THE CHANNEL THAT YOU'RE ON THE V THE VOLUME SETTING
EVERY REMOTE CONTROL LOOKS THE SAME SO UH IN MY OPINION IT SHOULD BE UM USER FRIENDLY AND UNIQUE
SO THE OTHER STUFF MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO A LITTLE TOO GADGETY FOR SOME PEOPLE
OH COME BACK SCREEN
SO NO L. C. D. NO TELETEXT AND NO VOICE RECOGNITION
AND THE WHAT WAS THE WORD THEY USED
ON THE BUTTONS
UM RIGHT IF W IF WE'RE MINIMISING BUTTONS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM ACTUALLY LARGER
S YOU KNOW LIKE UP ARROW DOWN ARROW FOR FOR VOLUME
S
BUT THEN THE LIKE UP BUTTON AND DOWN BUTTON FOR THE CHANNEL CHANNEL CHANGING
I JUST THOUGHT THAT IT IT MIGHT BE SUCKING MORE BATTERY POWER IF THERE IF IT IS A LIGHT UP
I GUESS THE OTHER OPTION REFERRING TO THE BATTERY THING IS YOU KNOW HOW CELLPHONES WILL T LIGHT UP FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS OR SOMETHING
UM SO IF YOU TOUCH THE BUTTON IT KIND OF REACTIVATES IT
ON SELF TIMER
OH JUST IF IT WAS KINDA THE SAME WAY THAT A CELL YOU KNOW HOW A CELLPHONE WILL LIGHT UP FOR ABOUT TEN
IT THE IT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS TACKY GLOW IN THE DARK
YOU COULD START OUT WITH THREE AND IF IF WE HIT IT BIG THEN WE CAN ADD SOME ON
IS EVERYONE READY TO START
UM ON THE AGENDA FOR THIS UM FOR THIS PARTICULAR MEETING WE'LL HAVE YOUR THREE PRESENTATIONS ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE SINCE OUR LAST MEETING
AFTER WE CAME UP WITH UM SOME GENERAL IDEAS OF OUR DESIGN
ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPT AND HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT WHAT UH MATERIALS WE'RE GONNA USE AND THAT SORT OF THING
ARE THEY ALL INCLUDED LIKE MANDATORILY OR R ARE THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS
JUST EVERY EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
JUST EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE OR CONSTANTLY
UH
UM ONE CONCERN WITH THE RUBBER CASING IS THAT IT WOULD BE RUBBER ENCAPSULATING ALL OF THESE CHIPS AND DIODES AND DELICATE TECHNOLOGY AS
LIKE AS THE EXTERIOR
ANOTHER THING IS IT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT IF IT'S A RUBBER EXTERIOR TALKING ABOUT PUTTING ON INTERCHANGEABLE PLATES
UM IS IT I DON'T SEE HOW A LIKE A RUBBER PLATE GOING ON TOP IT WOULD STAY THERE
I UM IS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT DESIGNS ONTO THIS TYPE OF RUBBER
IT COULD MAKE AN WE COULD HAVE ANY KIND OF STYLE
YEAH YOU CAN WATCH A T. V. IN THE DARK THEN
THAT'S UM
UM BECAUSE COMMAND INTERFACE REQUIRES YOU TO TYPE TEXTUAL COMMANDS AND INPUT AT A KEYBOARD SO THE NUMBERS ARE SORT OF LIKE A KEYBOARD
YOU'RE PRESSING THE NUMBERS FOR UM FOR WHAT YOU WANT
A BIT MORE TOO YEAH
DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD KEEP ALL THE BUTTONS TO ONE SAME COLOUR JUST TO KEEP IT GIVE IT A SIMPLISTIC LOOK
IF THEY WERE WHITE THEY WOULD GLOW PROBABLY
YEAH AND WELL RUBBER IS A MORE TRANSLUCENT PRODUCT TOO SO WE HAVE THAT TAKEN CARE OF
IF IT'S FLAT THEN LIKE O LIKE ON A CELLPHONE OR A MOBILE PHONE
IF IT'S DO ABLE WE CAN DO
AREA THAT I FIND RATHER JARRING
BUT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SEEMS A VERY STRANGE IDEA FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
BUT THEY STILL NEED TO UM FIT INTO PEOPLE'S DECOR THOUGH
YEAH LIKE MORE LIKE PHOTOS OF FRUIT ON ON OUR PRODUCT
SO ENERGY WE OH
UM DOES THIS IS THIS DEPENDENT ON SHAPE OR WHAT IT'S MADE OF OR WHAT
UM WHAT ARE OUR CHOICES HERE
LIKE WE I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN MAKE A REMOTE THAT WOULD BE UNIVERSAL TO ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF
YEAH I DON'T I IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE INTERNATIONAL UH APPEAL I THINK
IS THAT RIGHT
YEP AND UM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN SO THIS IS WHERE THE TRENDY STUFF COMES IN
OH WHAT DID I JUST DO
OH ALTHOUGH I CAN'T SEE IT ON MY SCREEN
I'VE BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH INTO THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT WE COULD USE UM WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO US F TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL
WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY A BATTERY AS WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE
UH THESE THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT OPTIONS THEY'RE ALL SEPARATE APART FROM THE CHIP
UM ALL THE OTHER THINGS ARE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS THAT WE'D HAVE TO GET IN SEPARATELY AND WORK OUT THE MOST
A BIT OUT OF DATE
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I THINK
UM OR THERE'S SOLAR POWER WHICH WE'VE BEEN CONSIDERING INSIDE A BUILDING WHICH IS WHERE IT'S GONNA BE USED MIGHT NOT BE QUITE SO USEFUL
AND THE SHAPE WAS SO SYMMETRICAL THAT I'D BE PRESSING LIKE A VOLUME BUTTON INSTEAD OF THE ON BUTTON
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE WHICH WAY ROUND IT IS
UM AGAIN STEPPING BACK IN TIME AGAIN THERE
I'M SURE WE'RE ALL QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE ON MOBILES OR COMPUTER LAPTOP PADS
WE'RE GOING ON TO THAT LATER WITH THE ADVANC WITH THE L. C. D. THAT MEANS WE'D NEED A REALLY ADVANCED CHIP
THEN WE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE THE SCROLL AND THE PUSH BUT NO L. C. D. 'CAUSE WE PROBABLY CAN'T AFFORD THAT ONE
I THINK THAT WOULD UH THERE WOULD BE AN IN SORT OF MORE INTERNAL CASING
MAYBE IF THE UM IF IT WAS JUST KIND OF A MORE OF A RUBBER COATING WHICH WAS ON TO A CASE
OR LIKE AN YOU CAN GET SORT OF OUTER CASING FOR IPODS AND SOMETHING THAT'S JUST IT'S PROTECTIVE AS WELL
AS FAR AS I KNOW
I SUPPOSE S BUT SOME
IT CAN BE LIKE YOU CAN HAVE THE SOLAR ENERGY AND THEN IT CAN STORE THAT ENERGY AND USE IT
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE REALLY ANNOYING IF YOU GET TO THINK OH NO I FORGOT TO CHARGE MY REMOTE TODAY
K OKAY
I THINK I JUST I JUST USED THE MOUSE ON THERE
I S I SUPPOSE WHERE UM MM ON SOME BUTTONS YOU WOULD HAVE LIKE THE POWER WOULD BE S SOME KIND OF SYMBOL
THEY HAVE THERE'S A LIKE LITTLE PICTURE WITH A SCREEN WITH LINES ACROSS IT
BUT IF WE'RE HAVING A SIMPLIFIED DISPLAY ANYWAY W THAT WE PROBABLY WON'T HAVE TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON THAT
LI YEAH
'CAUSE IF IT'S JUST LIKE CONSTRUCTED IN THE SAME WAY AS LIKE THE FRONT COVER OF A MOBILE PHONE
YOU CAN LIKE TAKE OFF THE HARD COVER AND THEN THERE'S THE LIKE SAY THE BUTTONS
I'M SURE YOU COULD F WORK IT OUT TO FIT IN THE CASING WITHOUT CAUSING TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY
AND THEN JUST REALLY LIKE STRIP IT DOWN TO LIKE REALLY BASIC SHAPES
I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING IN THE SHAPE OF A STRAWBERRY BUT IT COULD HAVE THE CURVES OF A STRAWBERRY OR SOMETHING
OR A STRAWBERRY SEED OR A LEAF
IT DOESN'T S QUITE FIT IN WITH THE TRENDY WELL OBVIOUSLY IT DOES IF THAT'S THE CURRENT THEME
I THINK NO
IS EVERYONE HAPPY WITH THAT
YEAH IT WAS SO THAT WAS WITHOUT THE L. C. D.
SO IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE WANTED THE SCROLL BUTTONS OR JUST THE PUSH BUTTONS
SO IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE THE REGULAR CHIP THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED
SO TH
MAY YEAH
I THINK MOST OF THAT COMES LIKE ON THE I INDIVIDUAL TELEVISION SET ITSELF DOESN'T IT
I'M SURE IT HAS ITS OWN BUTTONS SO YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO HAVE IT ON REMOTE
ARE WE SEEING AS THAT WAS THE MOST POPULAR THING THAT CAME UP OUT OF YOUR MARKET RESEARCH
I THI I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP TO THAT RATHER THAN MOVING TO ANIMALS OR SOMETHING
BECAUSE EVEN IF THAT MAY NOT SEEM OBVIOUS TO US IF THAT'S WHAT THE SURVEYS BROUGHT OUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO ALONG WITH THAT
WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE IDEAS YEAH
W
YEAH THA
SO MAYBE THAT COULD BE INCORPORATED AS
DO DO THOSE CALCULATORS YEAH
IT'S NOT ON MY SCREEN
IS IT THAT ONE
THERE'S THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE WHICH EMPHASISES THE USE OF PICTURES FOR OUTPUT AND A POINTING DEVICE FOR EXAMPLE A MOUSE FOR INPUT CONTROL
I'M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THE PICTURES THAT MAYBE THAT'S ON AN L. C. D. SCREEN
NO I THINK IT'S TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL SYMBOLS THAT ARE ON THE THAT'S ON THE BUTTONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND PER
BUT THE WE COULD INCORPORATE SOME OF THE GRAPHICAL USER UM POINTS AS IN JUST TO MAKE IT M UM NICER TO LOOK AT MAYBE
YEAH SOMETHING Y
UM THE CO UH WE'VE DECIDED THAT THE COMMAND INTERFACE WOULD BE THE MOST USEFUL FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
AS IT WOULD BE LESS COMPLICATED AND THE CONTROLS WOULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
UM THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE CHEAPER TO DESIGN SO THAT WE'D HAVE MORE MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO
WE WE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE'RE DESIGNING OUR UM MORE USER FRIENDLY REMOTE CONTROL
THAT A LOT OF INTERFACES CONSIST OF A CLUTTER OF BUTTONS THAT UM THAT THEIR FUNCTIONS COLOURS AND FORMS AREN'T ALWAYS HELPFUL
SO UM THAT DOESN'T IMPROVE THE USE OF THE PRODU PRODUCT SO WE NEED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND
IN THE PHONE THAT I WAS THINKING OF AS WELL WHEN YOU CHANGE THE UM COVERS OF IT THE
THE LITTLE BUTTONS THAT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT CONTRO CONTROL STUFF ARE BEHIND THE RUBBER
SO YOU CAN CHANGE THE BUTTONS WHEN YOU'RE CHANGING THE FACES
WHERE DO YOU HAVE TO SAVE IT TO
POWERPOINT THING SO I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CA IT'S THE COMPONENT
I THINK THAT IS WELL WE HAVEN'T REALLY MADE ANY DECISIONS ABOUT
LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE IDEAS TO COMBAT THESE PROBLEMS
WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONS WI SHALL WE HAVE
SO PRETTY JUST JUST THE BASIC BUTTON FUNCTIONS
IT W IT WOULD SEEM SILLY IF WE'D HAVING ANYTHING ELSE JUST HAVE AN AUDIO BUTTON THOUGH
UM HAVING THE NUMBERS KIND OF LIKE NOT A BUNCH OF GRAPES BUT YOU KNOW LIKE PURPLE AND KIND OF IN A TRIANGLE
LIKE THAT'S KIND OF FRUITY OR SOMETHING
AND THE BUTTONS OBVIOUSLY ARE RUBBER
YEAH SO THERE'S THERE IS A ONE BATTERY BECAUSE MOST REMOTES USE TWO BATTERIES I BELIEVE
JUST BECAUSE OF COLOUR CLASHING AND IF WE WANTED TO SO AND
OH I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
WELL Y
OH SO YOU'RE PICTURING THE LIGHT IS COMING FROM THE BACK
I KINDA PICTURED IT AS KIND OF COMING FROM THE SIDES AND LIGHTING IT UP FRONTWARDS
T
OKAY IS THAT MY TURN THEN
UM IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET THIS UH
UH
UM JUST SO C WE CAN WORK OFF OF THEM SEE HOW FASHIONS HAVE CHANGED
UM SO I'LL LIST THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS THAT I'VE COME ACROSS
UM AND THEY THEY'RE EACH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ONE THAT COMES AFTER IT
SO PRETTY BASIC THERE
IS THAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE
UM OF COURSE AS WE WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE PERSONAL FACE PLATES IN THIS MEETING AND I'D LIKE TO STICK TO THAT
MAYBE FOR THE TELEVISION THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR KITCHEN
IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BUT IT IT'S EVERYWHERE
ONE THING I WAS THINKING THOUGH IS I DUNNO IF YOU ALL REMEMBER FROM OUR KICKOFF MEETING WE TALKED ABOUT OUR FAVOURITE ANIMALS
UM THAT MIGHT BE GETTING YOU KNOW TOO SPECIFIC AND WE SHOULD SEE WHAT THE SUCCESS OF THE FIRST FACE PLATES ARE
OH IS REGULAR NOT SIMPLE
ABOUT HOW OFTEN IT WAS USED
SCREEN SETTINGS WAS USED UM ZERO POINT FIVE TIMES AN HOUR
I MEAN I SOMETIMES USE THAT
LIKE ALMOST ONCE AN HOUR
WELL THAT DIDN'T SOME UP ON MINE
SO IT'S A SOMETHING THAT WILL YOU KNOW APPEAL TO THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS
SOMETHING THAT YOUR GRANNY WOULD WANT ON HER REMOTE CONTROL
ALRIGHT THE AGENDA FOR THI OH
AND THEN WE WILL EVALUATE IT GIVEN THE CRITERIA THAT UM THAT WE GAVE
GAVE IT
ON
AH
WOULD YOU HAVE TO GO ZERO PLUS ONE IF YOU WANTED TO GO TO CHANNEL ONE OR TWO
BIT OF A STRESS BALL FEEL
I'M GONNA CHECK THAT OUT FOR A SECOND
EVALUATION CRITERIA IS NEXT IN LINE
ONE MORE TIME
OOH
THE LOOK IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PLAYFUL
OH DEFINITELY DIFFERENT YEAH
OH YOU WERE ONLY GIVEN RED AND BLACK
I'D SAY MAYBE THREE
ONE
TH
MAYBE LIKE AT THE BOTTOM KIND OF
OH IT JUST HAD TO BE ON THERE I GUESS
I LIKE THE APPEAL OF IT BEING LIKE A BIG GLOB IN YOUR HAND
IT'S LIKE RIGHT IN THE
THE POWERPOINT SLIDE THING SAID WOULD BE GOOD FOR R. S. I. SO MAYBE IT IS BUT
SO IT COULD BE GREY ON THE BANANA ONE
HUM
BUT MAYBE MORE LIKE TWO 'CAUSE THERE'S NO LIKE PICTURES OF FRUIT IT'S JUST SORT OF NAMING IT BY A FRUIT
ONE POINT NINE OR SOMETHING
OOH
ALRIGHT NOW WITH THAT OVER AND DONE WITH OUR NEXT STEP IS TO SEE IF WE ARE UNDER BUDGET
IT'S BLINKING AT ME
SO WE NEED TO TALLY UP HOW MUCH OUR W OUR PRODUCT WILL BE COSTING
SO UM IF YOU CAN LOOK UP AT THE SCREEN
UM THE LARGE SCREEN OH I GUESS LOOKING AT YOUR OWN TOO AND TELLING ME WHICH ONE YOU THINK
UM IT'S CUR IT'S DOUBLE CURVED SO ITS CURVED ALL AROUND
UM WE'RE USING PLASTIC AND RUBBER SO
GOOD THING PLASTIC IS FREE WE'RE AT EIGHT
S
WHICH PUTS US JUST BARELY UNDER BUDGET
SO UM OUR OPERATING COST IS TWELVE TWENTY EUROS
NEED MORE TIME AND
I THINK SO AS LIKE BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE CREATIV
IS THIS ME BEING LIKE GUYS DO YOU LIKE ME
I THINK WE WORKED GREAT AS A TEAM
ALRIGHT HOW WERE OUR MEANS
BUT EVER
IS THAT GOOD
THEN WE CELEBRATE IN SUCH A WAY THAT I HAVE NO IDEA
YOU JUST NEED THE NOUGHT
YEAH BECAUSE IF YOU ON YOUR AVERAGE UM REMOTE IF YOU PRESS ONE TWICE YOU JUST GO TO UM OR UH SAY YOU WANTED CHANNEL TWELVE
YOU PRESS ONE AND THEN YOU GO TO CHANNEL ONE AND THEN TWO THEN YOU'D JUST GO TO CHANNEL TWO INSTEAD OF TWELVE
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT'D BE A PROBLEM THAT IT WENT TO CHANNEL SIX FIRST IN LIKE ON THE WAY TO CHANNEL SIXTY FIVE
UM 'CAUSE IT WAS SAID BEFORE IN THE MATERIAL SPECIFICATION THAT THIS THE THIS ANTI R. S. I. UM MATERIAL IS OFTEN USED IN STRESS BALLS SO THIS HAS GOT A YOU KNOW A BIT OF GIVE TO IT
OKAY AS FOR THE COLOURS WE WERE PRESENTED WITH UM A LIMITED RANGE OF COLOURS FOR THIS PROTOTYPE
I MEAN WATERMELON YOU KNOW M PROBABLY APPEALING TO THE YEAH SEASONAL
UM AS WE SAID THE RUBBER'S PROBABLY USED FOR COMFORT AND ANTI R. S. I. AND THAT'S ABOUT IT
I MEAN TH THE COLOURS WE WERE GIVEN FOR MAKING THE PROTOTYPE AREN'T THE COLOURS THAT I THINK WE WOULD'VE NECESSARILY CHOSEN
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF OOH UH AT ALL SLEEK RED BLACK AND YELLOW AND ORANGE
BUT IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IN LIKE A S JUST A MAYBE UH A KIND OF PALE METALLIC Y FINISH OR SOMETHING
I MEAN DIFF IF YOU CAN VISUALISE THIS IN NICE COLOURS I THINK IT WOULD LOOK QUITE FANCY
OH WELL POTATO MANGO FRUIT AND VEG
YEAH AND THE USE OF THE RUBBER
THE L. E. D. USE ISN'T PARTICULARLY INNOVATIVE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY SCROLL BUTTONS IT'S ALL PUSHBUTTONS
THERE'S NO L. C. D. CONTROL SO IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE REST OF THE MARKET IT'S SORT OF PROBABLY HALFWAY
YEAH AND PERHAPS THE TURNING ON BUT
UH YEAH IT'S LESS UM WHAT'S TH HA
H IT'S GOT HIGHER CENTRE OF GRAVITY LIKE THAT
I WOULD DEFINITELY GO FOR THAT RATHER THAN LIKE YOUR AVERAGE PLAIN OLD REMOTE LIKE THAT BUT DEFINITELY IN ANOTHER COLOUR I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THOSE COLOURS
BUT I MEAN IT'S NOT OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUS FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T S PARTICULARLY SEE AN ALARM
YOU COULD S YEAH
WHEN IT WHEN IT LIGHTS UP AS WE I MEAN IT COULD LIGHT UP WHEN THE ALARM WENT
SO YOU CAN'T SEE THE ALARM BUT IT WOULD LIGHT UP
ALARM BUT YOU CAN'T SEE AN ALARM INSIDE UH THE ALARM SYSTEM ITSELF
YEAH I THINK JUST BECAUSE IT'S WE'VE DECIDED TO REDUCE IT DOWN TO THE BASIC BUTTONS I THINK THAT IN ITSELF MAKES IT SO MUCH EASIER TO USE
OOH
WE MAY HAVE TO DO SOME MORE RESEARCH INTO OTHER STRAIN INJURIES THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT
I THINK YEAH I THINK TOO
FOUR I THINK
THE THING IS I THINK IF SOMEBODY SAW THAT AND YOU SAID WHAT WAS THAT INSPIRED FROM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D INSTANTLY SAY MANGO
OOF
IS IS YEAH
SO WH HOW WE ACTUALLY WENT ROUND UH ABOUT DOING IT
WELL WE WERE JUST LIMITED BY RESOURCES REALLY AND LIKE IF WE HAD DECIDED TO USE THE L. C. D. SCREEN
A PRO UM A PRODUCT WITHIN THE BUDGET
I THINK THAT'S A SIGN OF GOOD LEADERSHIP AND ALSO OUR PERSONAL COACH HELPED US ALONG THE WAY SO YOU KNOW
I THINK THE ONLY THING WAS HAVING TO REMEMBER TO YOU KNOW TO TICK THE OKAYS BUT I THINK I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO STRUGGLED WITH THAT
UH ME TOO
WELL I THINK WE'VE ALL LEARNT STUFF FROM EACH OTHER LIKE THE N UM YEAH
GOT NEW IDEAS FROM EACH OTHER
WELL MM DID IT COME INTO THE INTO I DUNNO IF WE COUNTED THAT IN THE COSTS
UH
THIS IS WHAT WE CAME UP WITH
INFRARED HERE AND THIS'LL BE THE POWER POINT THE ON OFF BUTTON KIND YEAH
WE WANTED IT ALL TO BE
OH THAT WAS A MISTAKE WASN'T IT
RIGHT NO THAT'S A ZERO
TAKE THAT ONE OFF
AND THIS IS JUST IF YOU'VE GOT LIKE ELEVEN OR TWELVE OR
YOU CAN GO ONE THREE OR SOMETHING
YOU PRESS THAT FIRST AND THEN YOU GO ONE THREE YEAH
NO NO TH ALL THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ALL THESE NUMBERS
YOU P
I I WELL IT DOESN'T WE HAVEN'T REALLY S I WOULD'VE THOUGHT YOU PRESSED THE PLUS FIRST AND THEN THE SIX FIVE
BUT SHE SAYS PLUS PRESS WHICH WHAT DO YOU THINK IS SIMPLER
YEAH SO NOT VERY SLEEK AND WE DON'T WANNA GO FOR BLACK BECAUSE MOST REMOTE CONTROLS ARE BLACK OR GREY
SO WE WANT IT TO BE STAND OUT THAT WAY ANYWAY
I'LL GO FOR THREE AS WELL
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE JUST THOUGHT OF THERE NOW
WHAT WHERE'S IT GONNA SIT IN YOUR LIVING ROOM
IS IT NOT GONNA FALL OFF THE ARM OF THE SOFA
OH THAT WOULD BE NICE
THREE
YOU WOULD THOUGH 'CAUSE IT'S BIT IT'S MORE INTERESTING THAN OTHER REMOTES
SO PEOPLE DON'T JUST SEE IT AND THINK UH THIS IS SO SIMPLISTIC I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE EUROS
OH NO THE PLUS
YOU'RE USE THE ZERO
UH
YEAH THE BU WHEN YOU PRESS THE ALARM SYSTEM THE LIGHTS BEHIND THE AND IT'LL VIBRA
OH THAT WOULD BE BRILLIANT
YEAH BUT YOU STILL COULDN'T SEE IT
I'D SAY W YEAH ONE
N WE WE CAN'T REALLY DO THAT BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE ON THE BANANA THEME WE CAN'T HAVE IT AS BEING YELLOW
SO N IT'S NOT ALWAYS GONNA BE THE SAME COLOUR
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT WE DIDN'T EVEN REA
I THINK W YEAH I THINK ONE
OH THAT WOULD BE CLASS
YEAH 'CAUSE WE'VE A FOUR TO BRING DOWN
UH AYE
IS THAT THE PROJECT DOCUMENT
THE MA
OH THERE'S NO E OKAY
WELL THE THERE IS A THERE'S A DELAY ON REMOTES I THINK
WAS THERE SO ON THE TOP THERE IS VOLUME AND
OH IT'S NICE
OH I THINK I KILLED THE FIVE
OH GOD
OH IT SMELLS GOOD
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ORDER IT GOES IN
I HAVE ONE
COME ON MY COMPUTER
OKAY NOW I THINK FOR THIS ONE I COULD WOULD YOU GUYS PREFER USE THE WHITEBOARD OR MAYB MAYBE I'LL JUST DO IT ON RIGHT ON THE SCREEN WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT
UM AND LOOKING LOOKING BACK AT MY NOTES FROM OUR BOTH OUR CONCEPTUAL AND OUR FUNCTIONAL MEETINGS
UM AND WE'LL EVALUATE AS TO WHETHER WE'VE S DONE WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO
UM AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT ON A ONE TO SEVEN SCALE WHERE ONE IS TRUE AND SEVEN IS FALSE
OH I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE UM I'LL DO IT ON THE WHITEBOARD
OH SORRY THE MANGO THE MANGO LOOK
OKAY AND P
USE OF THE RUBBER THE USE OF THE L. E. D.
AND I THINK I MEAN IT IT'S TOUGH TO SAY BECAUSE WE WERE WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE ANY MORE INNOVATIVE THAN THIS
SO I MEAN I WE'LL PUT THREE BUT I THINK WE ACTUALLY REACHED OUR GOAL
WE DIDN'T WANT IT ANY MORE THAN THAT
UH WILL IT BE EASY TO USE
S
I MEAN THERE'LL BE S WE HAVE TO WORK OUT THE UH NUMBER THE PLUS SYSTEM
BUT ONCE THAT'S FIGURED OUT IT SHOULD BE FINE
IS THIS A GOOD LOOKING REMOTE
THIS TIME IT'S THE THREE I KILLED
MAYBE IT COULD IT COULD BE ON THE BOTTOM SO YOU WOULDN'T LOO LIKE IF IT'S FLAT HERE SO IT SITS UP
SO IS THIS A GOOD LOOKING REMOTE
I MEAN I GUE YEAH IT'S PERSONAL TASTE BUT
WHAT'S UM WILL PEOPLE BE WILLING TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE EUROS ON THIS PRODUCT
YEAH IT THE MARKETING WILL HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH IT
SO IN THE LONG TERM THIS CAN ACTUALLY SAVE YOU MONEY
SO WE'LL MARKET IT THAT WAY TOO
CAN SOMEONE READ IT OUT
YEAH I GUESS THE I THINK THE KEY WORD THERE IS AVERAGE 'CAUSE THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE THAT USED THE UH VIDEO INPUT AND SOUND AND STUFF
OKAY SO ONE
WILL THIS REMOTE CONTROL BE EASY TO FIND WHEN LOST
NOW IS THERE THE IS THE ALARM SYSTEM STILL WAS IT IMPLEMENTED
HERE I AM
WE OH YOU'RE JUST EXPLAINING WHY IT'S NOT ON THE PROTOTYPE
WILL IT BE EASY TO LEARN HOW TO USE THIS REMOTE WHEN BRAND NEW
REMEMBER THAT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF USERS USUALLY FOUND IT DIFFICULT
DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE FOR THE MIDDLE ONE TO BE AN JUST AN ENTER BUTTON
UM OKAY SO WE CAN WE'LL SAY YES IT'S UH ONE
UH WILL IT MINIMISE THE EFFECTS OF R. S. I. WHICH WAS REPEATED STRAIN INJURY
S
COULD I MEAN YOU COULD HOLD IT IN YOUR LEFT HAND AND D USE YOUR INDEX FINGER
IS THE YELLOW
SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO TALK TO OUR EXECUTIVE MANAGERS AND SEE IF WE CAN GET AWAY WITH JUST THE R. R.
AND THE BUTTONS IN THE MIDDLE
WELL WE HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR IT SO WE BUT WE CAN STILL PUT A
OKAY SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF IN THE MAKING TOO LIKE MAYBE IT'LL BECOME MORE
OKAY SO OUR AVERAGE THERE FIVE SIX EIGHT TEN ELEVEN
IS
YEAH THAT'S VERY GOOD 'CAUSE THE HIGHEST WE COULDA GOT IS ONE
ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT
OH IS IT LOCKED 'CAUSE I'M IN IT
LIKE WE WERE VERY CREATIVE IN IN COMING UP WITH AN IDEA I GUESS BUT M
OH DOES IT HAVE SMART MATERIALS BY THE WAY
I AM CORINNE WHITING AND I WILL BE THE MARKETING EXPERT AND IN EACH OF THE THREE PHASES I WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT ROLE
AND THIS MEANS WHAT NEEDS AND DESIRES ARE TO BE FULFILLED AND I'LL BE DOING RESEARCH TO FIGURE THIS OUT
OURS TOO
CH
THAT'S MORE ON THE RESEARCH END BUT THE MARKETING
MY IDEA WAS JUST TO HAVE IT BE KIND OF LIKE A
WE COULD ALSO TRY TO DO THE HINGE THING SO IT COULD LIKE FLIP OUT THAT WAY
UH AS YOU ALL KNOW WE'RE HERE TO CREATE A BRAND NEW FANTASTIC REMOTE
UM WE WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING ORIGINAL
FASHION UM CONSCIOUS ELECTRONICS COMPANY SO WE WANT IT TO BE TRENDY UM AND WE WANT IT TO BE EASY TO USE
WE'VE GOT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DETAILED DESIGN UM WHICH BASICALLY IS IS THE THREE OF YOU UM
W UH WELL UM FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UM
SO WE WANT IT TO BE UM A T. V. REMOTE OR I I MEAN DO WE WANT IT TO TO DO OTHER THINGS BESIDES JUST BE A A TELEVISION REMOTE
UM THIS IS MY FIRST UH GO ROUND WITH CREATING A REMOTE CONTROL SO I THINK WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT HERE
DO WE WANT SO THEY'RE KINDA LIKE LONG AND RECTANGULAR
A M A MODERN SO OUR REMOTE SHOULD BE
OKAY SO YEAH SO WE WANT IT TO BE STURDY WE WANT IT TO TO HOLD UP TO SOMEBODY'S CHILD YOU KNOW
THROWING IT ACROSS THE ROOM OR AS YOU SAID PEOPLE KINDA THROW IT
UM SO WE WANT IT TO BE MODERN FUN STURDY
UM WE WANT IT TO BE UM
IT WHAT ELSE DO WE WANT IT TO TO DO
SO WE WANT IT TO BE UNIVERSAL
YOU KNOW GOALS FOR PROFITS ARE I THINK SOMEWHERE AROUND UH FIFTY MILLION EUROS WHAT THEY WANNA MAKE ON IT SO
MARKETING YOU COULD S FIND OUT WHAT IS THE MOST UNIVERSALLY UM APPEALING REMOTE CONTROL OUT THERE
WE WANT IT TO BE A B A BALL YOU KNOW WE'LL DRAW UP WE'LL DRAW UP THE BALL AND MAYBE TH UM WHERE THE BUTTONS ARE LOCATED
NOT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT BUT
IT'S NOT NEW IT'S NOT INNOVATIVE IT'S YOU KNOW EVERYBODY DOES LONG REMOTE BECAUSE IT'S EASY IT'S IT'S STABLE UM
SO IF NO GO AHEAD
SOMETHING WITH A GRIP
OKAY SO UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIVE MINUTES HERE TO COME UP WITH OUR UM REMOTE CONTROL IDEA AND START ROLLING WITH IT
BUT MAYBE WE GIVE IT SORT OF GRIPS ALONG THE SIDE S UM TO MAKE IT EASIER TO HOLD ON TO
YOU KNOW UM S SO IT'S EASIER TO HOLD ONTO THAT WAY
SO THE GRIP IS
SO WE DON'T HAVE IT FLIP OPEN
OKAY SO THEN WE FORGET THE BALL
WHAT IF WE FLIPPED IT AROUND HERE SO THAT IT WERE UM
SORRY THAT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE WHAT YOU HAD THERE
IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE IT TO WHERE IT WOULD WORK WITH A LIKE A SENSOR ON EITHER SIDE
SO THAT EITHER WAY YOU'RE POINTING IT IT WOULD WORK
OKAY WELL JUST TO FINISH UP SHOULD WE S GO WITH THIS PLAN START MAKING SOME
UH
MUST FINISH NOW SO
AND THEN MARKETING WILL LOOK AND SEE WHAT UH WHAT PEOPLE WANT
WELL UH S FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS JUST JUST YOU KNOW CHANGE CHANNELS IS ITS MAIN FUNCTION
IS THAT STANDARD
YE YEAH
UM ONE THING I THOUGHT OF WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL IS YOU ALWAYS LOSE 'EM
OH YOU CAN GET THOSE KEY WELL YOU COULD WHISTLE OR MAKE A NOISE AND IT'D BEEP
BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS TEND TO THROW A REMOTE CONTROL ABOUT THE PLACE TO ONE ANOTHER IF IT WAS IN A BALL
IT COULD BE CASED ON THE OUTSIDE AND T EVERYTHING COULD BE INSIDE
YE
THIS IS WHERE IT'S CONNECTED TOGETHER AND THEN WHEN YOU OPEN IT OUT IT COULD FOL IT COULD BE MAYBE FLIP
LIKE A FLIP PHONE AND THEN WHEN YOU FOLD IT OUT THE MIDDLE
IF THAT IF WE DID USE A HINGE OR IF IT WAS JUST TWO PARTS AND THEN YOU'D HAVE
JUST SORTA YOU YOU YOU KNOW YOUR BUTTONS
THING IS INSIDE I THINK SOMETIMES REMOTES HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS SO MAYBE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE UM AS FEW BUTTONS INSIDE AS POSSIBLE
JUST SOMETHING MAYBE IF YOU HA IF IT HAD LIKE IF SOME KIND OF
IT'S LOOKING A BIT LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF STAR WARS AT THE MOMENT THOUGH TO BE FAIR
THAT WAS THAT WAS A SORTA SIMPLE IDEA I HAD AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU COULD ABOUT
THE IDEA IT DIDN'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY BE F A HINGE THAT WAS JUST ONE IDEA THOUGH
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN A LONG RECTANGLE FOR REMOTE MAYBE SMALL SORT OF FATTER ONES
YEAH WITH A GRIP
BUT THEN MAYBE TO GO BACK TO THE TO TH S SOMETHING ALONG THOSE THINGS THEN
SO IF THAT'S YOUR THING AND YOU GOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT INSTEAD AND THERE'S YOUR S YOU KN YOU KNOW WHICH WAY YOU'RE GONNA POINTING IT
DOES IT SAY WHAT DOES IT SAY FOR N IT SAYS ON THERE WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR THE NEXT MEETING I THINK
T
UM WE'LL DISCUSS WHAT THE PROG WHAT FUNCTIONS THE THE PRODUCT HAS TO FULFIL AND SO AND SO ON
UM SO WE'RE PRETTY MUCH WORKING TOGETHER OBVIOUSLY ON THE DESIGN FRONT HERE
WELL THERE ARE OF COURSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BE ANY FORM AND FULFIL ALL FUNCTIONS AT THE SAME TIME
SO THERE ARE ALWAYS THE SOME RESTRICTIONS WE HAVE TO APPLY HERE
DO WE WANT IT TO LAST LONGER OR RATHER HAVE PEOPLE
ONE PROBLEM YOU'D GET WITH THIS DESIGN IS UM THE BALL IS A NICE IDEA BECAUSE OF IT'S STABILITY REALLY BUT OF COURSE
SINCE IT'S A BALL IT'LL ROLL SO WE'D HAVE TO HAVE IT FLAT ON ONE SIDE AT LEAST DOWN HERE SOMEWHERE TAKE AWAY THAT PART
THAT'S THAT'S UM A PROBLEM
N N
AS AS STABLE AS IT IS THERE MUST BE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN UM STABILITY AND DESIGN HERE SO
MAY NOT BE TH AS FUNCTIONAL
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO LIE AROUND OPENED ALL THE TIME ANYWAY SO I DON'T KNOW IF A LID IS A GOOD IDEA
TO THE OTHER DESIGN
SO IT'S A ROUND SHAPE UNDERNEATH THAT MAKES IT COMFY RIGHT MAKES IT NICE SO THAT'S THE ESSENTIAL PART
EXCEPT FOR THAT I THINK WE'LL NOT PROBABLY NOT GET A GET AWAY FROM SOME LONGER DESIGN
BATTERIES GO WEAK AS WELL SO UM AFTER A WHILE YOU HAVE TO POINT IT TOWARDS THE UH
SO HAVE TO M
O OF COURSE THE MORE TECHNOLOGY YOU STICK IN THAT THE MORE IT'LL COST SO
I MEAN OF COURSE IT'LL BE EVIDENT AFTER A WHILE OR IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT'LL IT'LL BE EVIDENT WHICH WAY AROUND TO POINT IT
LIKE YOU JUST GRAB IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO S LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW WHICH WAY AROUND TO POINT IT
WELL THIS IS MY REPORT WHICH IS GOING TO BE BASED PRETTY MUCH ON A SURVEY THAT I WAS SENT
G
TO SEE SOMETHING ELSE ON MY SCREEN
IS THAT POSSIBLE
SO IS THERE NO WAY I CAN GIVE YOU THE SLIDESHOW AND
OH WELL
UM SO FIRST OF ALL THE METHOD THAT I USED WAS BY DOING SOME MARKETING RESEARCH BY UM DOING RESEARCH ON SOME INTERVIEWS THAT WERE CONDUCTED
SO I THINK THAT EARLIER WE WERE ONTO SOMETHING WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVING IT BE A MODERN COOL LOOK I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY IMPORTANT
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE THEY KEPT TRACK OF THE FREQUENCY PER HOUR IN USING CERTAIN BUTTONS
UM THE BIGGEST USER FRUSTRATIONS AS WE SAID FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE FIND THAT THEIR REMOTES ARE LOST SOMEWHERE
THEY SAID IT TAKE THIRTY FOUR PERCENT SAID IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW REMOTE
UM AS FAR AS SPEECH RECOGNITION GOES UM THE YOUNGER GROUP LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL FOR IT
SOME THINGS THAT I DREW FROM THIS ARE THAT I THINK WE WERE CORRECT
SORRY DID YOU GUYS GET TIME TO WRITE EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEEDED
THANKS FOR COMING TO THIS MEETING
S HOW WE DOING ON OUR REMOTE
IDEAS FOR WHAT PEOPLE WANT
SEE IF I CAN'T GET THINGS UH MOVING ALONG HERE A LITTLE BIT BETTER
UM WE DECIDED OUR REMOTE UH WE WANT IT TO BE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE UH THAT EVERYONE WOULD WANT
I'LL HAND IT OFF TO YOU AND UM
YOU WANT IT TO BE ON BOTH SCREENS OR JUST JUST YOURS
I THINK OH GIVE US THE SLIDESHOW AND SOMETHING ON YOUR SCREEN
HAVE THEM BOTH UP AT THE SAME TIME I THINK
UH
FOCUS ON UH THE I
I MYSELF I FIND WHEN YOU H WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE SPEE SPEECH RECOGNITION
SOMETIMES THEY HAVE A A SPEECH RECOGNITION ON THE OTHER END AND YOU SAY ONE FOR THIS
IT'S A IT'S A GIMMICK FACTOR THAT THEY LIKE AT FIRST AND
WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE WE ALREADY DECIDED Y YOUR YOUR RESEARCH SHOWED THAT UH NOT ONLY IS A UNIVERSAL REMOTE MORE COMPLICATED
AND YOUR RE UH RESEARCH SHOWED THAT YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN USE IT
AND OUR CORPORATE COLOURS ARE GREY AND YELLOW
AND WE COULD PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH BLACK TOO BUT
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE UM THE THREE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT I WAS TOLD
UM FROM ALL ALL THREE OF YOUR UH PRESENTATIONS I THINK THAT WE WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK A LOT IN OUR LAST MEETING
S THE YOUNG THE YOUNGER PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY LIKE IT
OR OR WITH YOU KNOW I GUESS WITH ANY FORM THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD
OR YOU KNOW HOWEVER HOWEVER YOU WANTED TO GO ABOUT IT THE HOLDER COULD ALSO BE THE CHARGING UNIT
UM LIKE IF WE STILL HAVE THE HOW TO HOLD ON TO IT AND
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY ON YOUR WAY FOR UH
USER INTERFACE CONCEPT WE WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING SIMPLE
I GUESS OUR I GUESS OUR MAIN UM
MAIN THING THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON UNTIL THEN IS PROBABLY DECIDING ON A CERTAIN LOOK YOU KNOW
IF IT WERE IF WE WERE SHOOTING FOR YOUNG GUYS THEN IT'S UM A CERTAIN LOOK TO THE REMOTE
WOULD THAT YOU THINK THAT WOULD HELP US FIND UM A SPECIFIC FORM
THAT WE WOULD WOULD WANNA PICK OUT
AND OUR SLOGAN PASTED SOMEWHERE ON IT ON THE THE BOTTOM OR THE YOU KNOW
ALL OF OUR REMOTES ALL OF OUR TYPICAL REMOTES NOW ARE JUST KIND OF A RECTANGULAR SORT
UH
BUT THEY ARE ALL YOU KNOW MOBILE PHONES UM THEY'VE KIND OF TAKEN A TURN TO WHERE THEY'RE REALLY SMALL
BUT THEN AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT YOU KNOW LIKE THE FIRST MOBILE PHONE THAT WAS THIS BIG AND YOU HAD A HANDBAG TO CARRY IT AROUND IN
UH YOU'VE GOT
THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL YOU NEED I THINK
LOOK G YEAH
TO THE THUMB
YEAH IS EVERYONE WHO IN HERE'S RIGHT HANDED LEFT HANDED
SO I'M LEFT HANDED BUT I SO I CAN SAY THAT MOST THINGS ARE DESIGNED FOR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE
OW
IT ACTUALLY IS YOUR COFFEE TABLE
SO FOR THE NEXT UM BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING W UH SH SHALL WE WORK ON YOU'RE WATCHING TRENDS TO SEE WHAT WHAT KIND OF NEW INFORMATION WE'VE GOT GOING ON
AND RYAN YOU WORK ON UM HOW HOW WELL THEY'LL WORK WITH THE US WITH THE USER
SEE YOU IN
I GU I GUESS WE'LL TAKE LUNCH
IN ABOUT UH HALF AN HOUR
DU
UH WE YES S I'VE LO I'VE DONE THE ROLE THAT I WAS ASKED TO DO ANYWAY
IS IS IT J JUST JUST JUST USING IT YEAH
UM THE METHOD I USED WAS TO EXPLORE THE UH TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF A REMOTE CONTROL
AND T S SIMPLEST APPROACH THAT I CAME TO IS IS TO CHANGE PROGRAMME AND OPERATE AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE REMOTELY
WHEREAS I THINK THE AIM IS TO TAKE AWAY BUTTONS
MANUFACTURERS COULD USE IT TO SET TO THEIR SPECIFICATIONS IF IF THE AIM IS TO GET SOMETHING THAT'S UNIQUE IN DESIGN
THAT IS THE ONE ON THE LEFT
AND YOU CAN STRAIGHT AWAY SEE THERE'S LESS BUTTONS
WHICH APPEALS MORE TO THE PRODUCT THAT WE WANT AND ON WHAT THE HAVE SAID AND THE MARKET RESEARCH AND STUFF PROBABLY LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE USER CENTRED
FEWER BUTTONS SIMPLER TO USE AND IF TEN PERCENT UM IS HIDDEN AWAY IF TEN PERCENT IS WHAT'S USED
THEY COULD BE HIDDEN MAYBE UNDER SOME REMOTE CONTROLS YOU MIGHT HAVE COME ACROSS HAVE MAYBE A LITTLE FLIP THI THING WHERE THEY'RE HIDDEN AWAY
AND THE MAIN BUTTONS ARE THE ONES YOU OR THE ONES YOU COME ACROSS
LIKE I SAID TO CONCENTRATE ON T. V. REMOTE CONTROL A UNIVERSAL REMOTE MIGHT BE TOO COMPLEX
UM AND AS WHAT IT THE MAJOR FINDINGS MARKET RESEARCHERS HAVE SAID IT'S THE IMAGE AND THE APPEARANCE THAT PEOPLE DI DISLIKE
ON SOMETHING ON THE IMAGE OF IT
UH THE F THE ACTUAL DESIGN
UH ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE UM THEY HAVE TO BE REALLY GOOD FOR THEM TO WORK
'CAUSE SOMETIMES YOU FIND YOURSELF JUST SAYING THINGS OVER AND O IF IT'S ON YOUR PHONE
AND WOU I DON'T KNOW IF WOULD WOULD YOU WANT TO KEEP SAYING STUFF IF YOU WERE WATCHING STUFF
IS THAT IF IT CAME WITH MAYBE A HOLDER
I TH I I DO STILL THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS ULTIMATELY ONE HANDED
ON MAYBE A
A RECT ON A RECTANGLE BUT MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY AS
D I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MIGHT COPE WITH LIKE THE TREND WATCHING
THEY'VE GONE FROM BIG BRICK BLOCK THINGS WHICH IS A REMOTE CONTROL IS TO SORT OF SLINKY SMALL THINGS
YES S
TO THE THUMB YEAH
DECREASE IN S THE BIGGER ONES YOU KNOW THEY COULD ACTUALLY BE BIGGER IN SIZE THAN THE ONES THAT ARE LESS IMPORTANT THE SMALLER HERE
WITH THE SORT OF THAT SORT OF THE SORT OF EARLY IDEA WE HAD WITH THE WAY THAT WAS MORE LIKE THAT
SO YOU'D HAVE YOUR YOU'D PUT YOUR HAND INTO THERE WITH THE THUMB THERE
AND THEN YOUR THUMB WOULD DO YOU'D HAVE ALL THE BUTTONS SORT OF ROUND HERE
ON ANY HAND
IF YOU JUST HAD IT LIKE WRAPPED ROUND THERE
DO THIS LITTLE PRESENTATION FOR ME OBVIOUSLY WERE TOO DRUNK TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH IT SO UM I'M GOING TO DO A LOT OF THE STUFF ON THE BOARD
SO I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT ON THE BOARD RATHER
TO THE WHOLE THING AS WELL SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S WORKING BASICALLY
YOU PRESS SOMETHING YOU GET A RESPONSE
WHICH IS ALSO COMPARATIVELY UM IMPORTANT ON ONE OF THOSE DEVICES
THESE TWO ARE COMPONENTS THAT WE HAVE TO USE AND THESE ARE DICTATED BY THE WHOLE FUNCTION OF THE WHOLE THING
UM THE LAMP CAN BE PUT ONTO THE DESI THE DEVICE
UM AS WE'VE HEARD
OR WE HAVE A TOUCH PAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DISCUSS
OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS A QUESTION WHETHER THESE THESE COMPONENTS ARE IN FACT AVAILABLE CHEAP ENOUGH DEVELOPED ENOUGH
BUT THAT'S LIKE I S I SUPPOSE RATHER UP TO MARKETING AND NOT TO
TO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN DEPARTMENT
YOU S YOU STILL
YOU PUT IT ON T ON THE COUCH TABLE
JUST WHICH MAYBE FROM AN ENGINEERING POINT THIS COULD BE HOLDING THE THE BATTERIES AND SO ON
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT HERE FEL LOOK AT IT FROM THE SIDE
UH
AND MAYBE YOU BRING THE BUTTONS NEARER TO THE OR THE IMP MORE IMPORTANT BUTTONS NEARER TO THE TO THE SIDE
YOU CAN ALSO HAVE IT MAYBE TALKING ABOUT MOBILE PHONES AGAIN SLIDING OPEN
AND OUT
UM OKAY THE MOST IMPORTANT FINDING WAS THAT THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL SEEMS TO BE TWICE AS IMPORTANT TO THE USERS AS THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN
AND AGAIN THESE ARE ALL THINGS WE'VE KIND OF ALREADY COME UP WITH ON OUR OWN BUT THIS JUST BACKS IT UP
AS FAR AS FASHION UPDATE WE'VE LEARNED THAT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHS SHOES AND FURNITURE
UM AND ALSO AS OPPOSED TO LAST YEAR THIS YEAR THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY IN FEEL
OKAY SO FROM THAT UM AS WE'VE ALREADY SAID WE NEED TO FOCUS ON A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE SHAPE OR THE COLOURS OR ALL OF THAT
AND MANUEL HAD SUGGESTED UM THE ENERGY SOURCE AND THE USER INTERFACE DISCUSSING SOME OF THOSE UM THAT WE COULD CHANGE A LITTLE BIT
I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I GUESS THE TWO OPTIONS ARE IF WE HAD OUR REMOTE IN THE SHAPE OF A FRUIT OR VEGETABLE
I GUESS WE COULD LOOK AT MOBILE PHONES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OUT THERE
SO WHEN YOU BUY YOUR REMOTE YOU CAN BUY
Y PROBABLY NOT YEAH
THE WE CAN HAVE THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ON THE SPONGY PARTS SO THEY CAN REMOVE IT
WELL WE KINDA DO YEAH
SO IS THE TWO PIECE IDEA OUT
IS EVERYONE HERE
UM WE DECIDED THAT OR WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO USE COMPANY COLOURS COMPANY LOGO
OUR MARKETING EXPERT UH GAVE US SOME I UH INFORMATION FROM INTERVIEWS WITH A HUNDRED DIFFERENT REMOTE USERS
EITHER A BUTTON OR TRACKING DEVICE
THE YOUNGER PEOPLE SAID THEY WANTED IT OLDER PEOPLE DID NOT
HAVE IT S BE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT
AND FINALLY OUR UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UH GAVE US A RUNDOWN OF HOW THE REMOTE WILL WORK
IF WE WERE TO TO HAVE ONE
UH UM THE USER INTERFACE THEN WOULD CONNECT TO A CHIP WHICH WOULD WORK WITH THE INFRARED CONTROLS UH TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO THE T. V.
I BELIEVE THEN WE CAME UP WITH A COUPLE OF IDEAS FOR WHAT WE THINK THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE WILL BE
OKAY AND I WILL LEAVE THAT LEAVE IT AT THAT
YOU HAVE ONE WITH A FLAG AND ONE WITH A BANANA AND ONE THAT'S A SPONGY
FEEL TO IT
WE COULD LEAVE THAT TO THE COVER DEPARTMENT
IS THAT AN OPTION A PLASTIC SHELL WITH A RUBBERY COATING ON AT CERTAIN SPOTS
WHAT ABOUT A SMELL
T TO THE REMOTE
WE COULD PUT THE GREY STRIPES ON THE BOTTOM SO THAT THAT PERSON COULD TURN IT OVER
A COUPLE OF THESE ITEMS HERE
UM OW
OW
UM AND THEN FOR THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT THE TAPE WHAT WHAT THE TYPE IS
THEN THE CHIP ON PRINT IS STILL KIND OF WE COULD HAVE EITHER OR
BUT DID WE DECIDE THAT THE RUBBERY FEEL WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO US
IT'S MORE OF A SU IT'S MORE OF A SUPPLEMENT MAYBE
I GUESS THAT IS THAT IS THAT ABOUT IT
SO WE HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TO DO ON THIS
AND THE TWO OF YOU GET TO PLAY WITH THE UH MODELLING COMPONENTS AND UH
MAYBE AND AND GET US A PROTOTYPE
OH IT WAS SORT OF BANANA SHAPED
THOSE LIKE YEAH SORT OF SPONGY ONES
UM YEAH I TALKING ABOUT THE INTERFACE CONCEPT AND HOW THE CUSTOMER RELATES TO WILL USE THE CONSUMER WILL USE THE ACTUAL DEVICE
UM SO I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE STUFF I WAS SENT UM TRY AND GET SOME INSPIRATION
THEY GAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A COFFEE MACHINE WHERE YOU PROGRAM A QUESTION YOU PROGRAM THE ANSWER AND THE MACHINE RESPONDS ACCORDINGLY
WELL ON A SCREEN
A COMMAND LINE WHERE YOU OBVIOUSLY TYPE THINGS IN AND YOU GET A RESPONSE
UM AND THEN IT JU THAT'S JUST TO POINT OUT THE SORT OF INCONSISTENT U SORT OF USE OF INTERFACE IN REMOTES
YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THAT PICTURE WELL BUT THERE'S VARIOUS DIFFERENT REMOTES ONCE AGAIN WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS ON MAKING IT MORE COMPLICATED
SO THEN I HAD A LOOK AT NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE ON THE MARKET
STORE UP TO EIGHTY SPEECH SAMPLES CONTROLS FOUR DEVICES T. V. CABLE SATELLITE V. C. R. D. V. D. AND AUDIO
UM THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DREW UP ON THE BOARD IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING
YOU CAN SORT OF JUST MAKE THOSE OUT
AND THEN ON THE RIGHT IS OBVIOUSLY AN IPOD WHICH IS YOU KNOW POSSIBLY ONE OF THE SIMPLEST THINGS TO USE OUT THERE
AND REALLY IS AND ALL THAT IS IS JUST A A NICE BIG SCROLL MENU THAT Y YOU SORT OF GO THROUGH
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL IT O ONLY ALLOWS THEM TO ACCESS THE CHANNELS THAT THEIR PARENTS WANT THEM TO WATCH
AND UM IT MEANS THAT TH CHILDREN HAVE A NOVELTY OF HAVING THEIR OWN REMOTE CONTROL
UM THE POINT MADE AT THE END THERE HERE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SORT OF BE NEED TO BE CLEAR ON YOUR UM DEVICES
AS TO WHAT YOU KNOW THINGS YOU USE
JUST LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH WOULD NEED TO BE MADE CLEAR IN THE DESIGN
UM I THINK D CARRYING ON FROM WHAT I'VE ALREADY SAID A USER FRIENDLY REMOTE WITH MINIMUM BUTTONS
MAYBE WE'VE SO SUGGESTED THIS TWO PART THING
WHERE IF IT WAS TO HAVE A SPEECH RECOGNITION THING YOU COULD MAYBE CONTROL THAT ON THE DO IT OR PROGRAM ALL THAT ON THE CONTROL BIT
THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTR THE ACTUAL CONTROL PORT MAYBE COULD HAVE LIKE AN IPOD WHERE YOU JUST SORT OF CONTROL THROUGH THE MENUS
WHY AM I
UH
M THEY'VE EVEN GOT THINGS LIKE THAT
SEE
WOULD THE SORT OF SPONGY AND THE THE PLASTICKY THING Y YOU CAN GET THOSE MOBILE PHONES THAT INITIALLY HAVE A IT IS PLASTIC BUT THEN THEY HAVE SORT OF A A S A COVER ON IT WHICH IS JUST SORT OF SOFT AND STUFF
SO YOU AS THE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A A GRAPHICAL DISPLAY ON IT LIKE A SCREEN
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY THEY'RE JUST ON THE EXTERIOR
I DON'T SUPPOSE WE HAVE TO STICK TO CO
ON THE THE GR THE RUBBERY GRIPS COULD BE GREY
IT COULD AND THEN YOU COULD ACTUALLY H PUT THE BANANA SHAPED THING ON THE FRUIT BOWL
ON THE COFFEE TABLE AND THEN PEOPLE WOULD ALWAYS KNOW WHERE IT WAS
UH
THE DETAILS OF THE COMPONENTS' DESIGN AS YOU CAN SEE THERE WHAT WE HAVE IS THE BOARD MAIN BOARD OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
THE UNDERSIDE THAT'S PRETTY CHEAP PIECE OF OF TECHNOLOGY REALLY TOP LEFT SIDE YOU CAN SEE THE CHIP
AND IT PASSES IT ON TO A ROW OF UM FURTHER TRANSISTORS AND STUFF LIKE THAT ON THE RIGHT SIDE THAT ACTUALLY AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL
WHICH LATER ON IS BEING IS BEING TRANSFERRED TO A INFRARED LAMP WHICH
THEN UM OF COURSE SHINES INFRARED LIGHT ONTO THE TELEVISION WHICH THEN WILL RECOGNISE WHAT SIGNAL UM IT'S GETTING AND WILL DO WHAT YOU TELL IT
ITS JOB IS TO WAIT FOR YOU TO PRESS A KEY THEN TO TRANSLATE THAT KEY PRESS INTO INFRARED LIGHT SIGNALS UM THAT ARE RECEIVED BY THE TELEVISION
THE SENSOR IN THE T. V. CAN SEE THE INFRARED LIGHT AND SEEING THE SIGNAL REACTS APPROPRIATELY
WITH THE GREEN GREENISH BOARD IS IS WHAT WE WHAT WE SAW IN THE FIRST THE FIRST SLIDE JUST FLIPPED OVER
UM YOU CAN SEE THE CIRCUIT BOARD ITSELF
THAT'S THE CHEAPEST UH WAY TO MAKE ELECTRONIC CONNECTIONS BASICALLY ON THE MARKET
UM WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE DON'T HAVE CABLES BUT YOU HAVE THE CONNECTIONS ACTUALLY IN THESE IN THESE LINES ON THE ON THE BOARD
UM WHICH UH SENDS IT OVER TO THE TRANSISTORS AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT
NOW AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE THE RUBBER BUTTON VERSION OF IT
UM WE ARE ALSO RESTRICTED IN THE USE OF OUR OUTER SHELL OR IN THE MATERIAL THAT WE COULD USE FOR OUR OUTER SHELL
UM RUBBER THAT IS USED IN THESE ANTI STRESS BALLS
HOWEVER OUR COMPANY OBVIOUSLY CAN PROVIDE US WITH UH WITH THE TITANIUM SO I ASSUME I'M I WAS GIVEN AN OKAY TO USE IT
NOW LET'S FIRST GO THROUGH THE LIST WITH THE MATERIALS
SO WE WHAT WE CAN USE IS PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD AND TITANIUM
UM AS FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE UM WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT SHORTLY IN THE OTHER MEETING
UM WHAT WE COULD USE IS OR WHAT I WAS OFFERED OR WHAT WE COULD USE IS A BASIC BATEER BATTERY
MAY FAIL THOUGH EVERY HERE AND THERE
ALWAYS THE YOU
OUR INTERFACE OPTIONS ARE PUSH BUTTONS
IN WHICH UH IN THE PRODUCTION OF WHICH OR IN MANUFACTURE OF WHICH UM OUR COMPANY IS EXPERT
UM THE CHIP HAS TO BE MORE S MORE SOPHISTICATED AND THUS MORE EXPENSIVE AS WELL
UM UM SOLAR CELLS CANNOT BE USED ON A CURVED OR LATEX UM SURFACE OR UM REMOTE CONTROL
BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM UM SINCE WE HAVE DECIDED OR AGAINST SOLAR CELLS I ASSUME RIGHT
UM BUT THEREFORE NO RUBBER WILL BE USED
WITH PLASTIC AS I UNDERSTAND IT YOU CAN USE ANY FORM
IS TRICKY
SO THE WAY TO GO IS IF YOU WANT A SCROLL WHEEL YOU EITHER MAKE IT FLAT AND ANGULAR UH ADD AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND UM
UM IF YOU WANNA MAKE IT A PARTICULAR SHAPE USE PLASTIC
WITH RUBBER WE COULD UH SH PRETTY MUCH SHAPE IT THE WAY WE WANTED IT BUT WE CANNOT ADD SCROLL WHEELS AND WE CANNOT ADD AN L. C. D. SCREEN
S CERTAINLY CAN BE DONE YES
SAY WE DON'T MAKE IT P A PARTICULAR FRUIT SHAPE OBVIOUSLY BUT UH GIVE IT LIKE THE SURFACE OF
WELL WE HAVE IT BANANA SHAPED ALREADY KIND OF
IT COULD BE AN APE
I INFORMED YOU ABOUT THE MATERIALS WHAT THE INTERIOR HAS TO LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THE LIMITATIONS TO CERTAIN MATERIALS ARE ON THERE YOU GO
BUT JUST HAVE IT BE AN OPTIONAL EITHER BIG REMOTE WITH LOTS OF FUNCTIONS OR YOU TAKE OUT THE SMALLER PIECE
LIMIT AGAIN THE THE THE USE OF CERTAIN MATERIALS BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE
SAY LIKE HAVE A SCROLL WHEEL AND UH ON BOTH OF THEM OR HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND SO ON SO ON
A CHEAP ONE
M MORE OF A L LAMINATION PERHAPS
I DO
THREE
FOUR IS FAIR
ONE 'KAY
SO ONE
ARE WE ADDING ONE OF THESE
THREE
WELL I HAVEN'T DONE MATH IN YEARS
HOW DOES THAT LOOK
THEY JUST TOLD ME TO
WE MIGHT HAVE A WHILE THOUGH
THEN WE'LL GO THROUGH THE FINANCE AND SEE IF WE FALL WITHIN THE BUDGET
OR HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WILL FALL RIGHT IN LINE
SO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO INCORPORATE THOSE INTO OUR PROTOTYPE
SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT AT THAT AND LET YOU GUYS TAKE OVER
WHAT BUT WHAT'S THAT BUTTON
UH 'KAY
WOULD YOU LIKE TO UH
SO IF THEY THINK THAT WHAT IS OUT THERE IS UGLY THEN YES I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY MOST DEFINITELY
S SCROLLING THROUGH AND SELECTING A FEW
UH
BUT IF WE DO GO WITH THE WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN IT THEN OUR SCALE GOES UP QUITE A BIT I THINK
UM I WOULD SAY WE'RE PROBABLY AT FOUR
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY GOT WHAT THESE PARTS ARE THE GRIPS AND PERHAPS THE BACK SIDE THE BOTTOM THE UNDERNEATH ON THE BACK
PROBABLY A FOUR AT MOST
IS THERE LIKE A SCALE THAT WE HAVE TO HIT
SO I HAVE HERE AN
OH YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THAT VERY WELL
THE F THE
OH IT WON'T LET ME DO THAT
ALRIGHT SO AT TOP I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS CAN READ THAT OR NOT
'KAY WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE
IS THAT RIGHT OR IS IT JUST ONE
AND THEN IS IT THE INTEGRATED OR IS IT
WELL WE ONLY HAVE ONE BUTTON SO REALLY WE SHOULDN'T BE CHARGED WE SHOULDN'T BE CHARGED ANYTHING FOR THE THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
WHICH I BELIEVE IS
SO THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN UM A BANANA SHAPED REMOTE IS ONE THAT YOU SHAKE
SO WE MAY NOT NEED THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
SO WE JUST REMOVE OUR
BESIDES LOOK AT WHAT THE L. C. D. DOES TO OUR LOVELY REMOTE
I THINK THAT PERHAPS THE PROJECT EVALUATION'S JUST SUPPOSED TO BE COMPLETED BY ME
UH H WHAT DID YOU THINK OF OUR PROJECT PROCESS
OUR LEADERSHIP WAS QUITE WEAK IN THE BEGINNING
BUT AS THE DAY WENT ALONG WE HAD MORE IDEA OF WHAT WE WERE DOING
I THINK IT WAS UM INTERESTING AS YOU GUYS BROUGHT UP MORE UM INFORMATION AND STUDIES THAT WE WERE RIGHT ON WITH A LOT OF THOSE THINGS
UM YOU GUYS WORKED TOGETHER WELL AS A TEAM
AND UM THE MEANS
I HAD SOME PROBLEM WITH THE PEN I THINK BUT MINUS YOUR P
N NEW IDEAS FOUND
MAYBE NO NOT F FOR
THESE WOULD BE LIKE THE RUBBER THE RUBBER GRIPS
UM BUT ALL THE CONTROLLING WOULD BE DONE WITH THIS SCROLL WHEEL
AND THE THE SIMPLEST FUNCTIONS WOULD BE UM ALMOST IDENTICAL TO AN IPOD WHERE THAT ONE WAY CH THROUGH CHANNELS THAT WAY TH OTHER WAY THROUGH CHANNELS
AND THEN TO ACCESS THE MORE COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS YOU'D YOU SORTA GO YOU PRESS THAT AND GO THROUGH THE MENUS
THAT'S A SIMPLE ON AND OFF SWITCH
T THAT BLUE BITS SHOULD BE YELLOW D THAT THAT'D BE WHERE THE BATTERIES WOULD BE I SUPPOSE
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS YOU WE COULD MAKE IT REALLY
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD
T THE ACTUAL THING MIGHT BE SMALLER
JUST THE ON AND OFF
I THINK THAT WAS THE MAIN AIM ONE OF THE MAIN AIMS THAT WE HAD
UH YEAH
BUT UM IF WE WERE TO IF WE WERE THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
THAT WE COULD MAYBE JUST USE THAT SOLELY FOR THE THE FINDING THING
JUST JUST TO USE TO FIND IT WHEN IT WAS LOST
BUT LIKE I SAID LIKE I DON'T THINK YOU'D LOSE SOMETHING SO YELLOW SO EASILY
THAT'S GONNA BE A DIFFICULT SHAPE TO
I MEAN YOU KNOW LOO LOSING THINGS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN LOSE I MEAN A MILLION WAYS
BUT I MEAN D JUST THOSE WHISTLING CLAPPING KEY RINGS YOU HAVE
STICK IT ON THE T. V.
FA
YEAH AS MUCH AS AS NEEDED I THINK
ON THE
BE WHAT WE WERE TOLD AND THEY'D SAY YEAH DEFINITELY
IS THAT SOME LONG DIVISION
IT'S TWO POINT FOUR TWO EIGHT FIVE SE IT JUST KEEPS GOING ON
WE'RE ADVANCED CHIP ARE WE
S
WHAT IF WE COMPLETELY TOOK OUT THE THE ONE SINGLE BUTTON WE'VE GOT ON
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THERE
UH ADD SOME MORE UNDERNEATH HERE
LIKE EITHER PUT EITHER ONE ONE ON EITHER SIDE OR
THAT'S UM
THREE FEET HUGE L. C. D. DIS DISPLAY IN YOUR LIVING ROOM THAT'S HANGING FROM THE WALL TO BE CONTROLLED WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
S GIVE IT A ONE
S
Y YOU COULD ADD AN EXTRA FEATURE ACTUALLY
WE COULD ADD THAT BUT THAT'S NOTHING WE HAVE THOUGHT OF SO FAR
SO THAT CAN ALSO EASILY BE INTEGRATED BECAUSE THESE THINGS ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO TO HIDE
SO YOU HAVE ONE PIECE YOU HAVE TO GLUE SOMEWHERE BEHIND YOUR STICK IT BEHIND YOUR T. V. AND THE OTHER
WELL ALSO YOUR REMOTE WOULD UH ALARM YOU IF SOMEBODY STOLE YOU T YOUR TELEVISION YEAH
RAN OFF WITH IT WITHOUT TAKING THE BEAUTIFUL REMOTE CONTROL
LET'S ADD ONE OF THOSE FEATURES AND SAY YES
UH
SO THAT'S A FOUR AT MOST
WELL THE RECENT FASHION IS RATHER DISPLAYED IN THE IN THE L. C. D. AND THE WAY YOU OPERATE IT THAN THE FORM AND THE COLOUR BUT IT DEFINITELY IS
P
UH
AT FOUR IT'S GONNA BE TOO HEAVY SO THAT THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM
N NO
IT'S JUST ONE MO SINGLE MOULD WE CAN DO THAT
S
SO S YEAH LET'S TAKE AWAY THE
WE MAY NOT NEED IT
TAKE AWAY A HECK OF A LOT OF THE THERE YOU GO
CENTRAL
ONE MORE CRITERIA
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE I WORK FOR UH THAT WORK FOR ME UH THEY'VE JUST YOU KNOW
BASICALLY YOU CAN SEE GISELLA SORT OF THERE IN THE MIDDLE WITH THE FAX MACHINE AND MAGGIE AND SUSAN
AND WE HAVE TWO FIFTY PER CENT PEOPLE WHO ARE HALF TIME IN GENEVA HALF TIME AT THE E. P. F. L. IN LAUSANNE
AND THEY M THEM WE'VE PUT IN THREE PERSON OFFICES SO THAT IN THE THREE PERSON OFFICES IT'S NOT CONSTANTLY THREE PEOPLE
AND THE READING ROOM OR THE LOUNGE AS SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THAT WE HAVE IS IN A CENTRAL POSITION
UM THEY DON'T ACTU THEY WILL BE STARTING A NEW PROJECT TOGETHER IF UM IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
UM MARIANNE AND BRUNO ARE AT THE BOTTOM
SO AS I SAID THE HALF TIMES ARE IN THE THREE PERSON OFFICES
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE MARIA MARTIN AND MYSELF WHO ALL WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT
UM PROFESSORS ON STAFF SO THEY GOT THE THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICES
UM GISELLA PIERRETTE UM AND ALL THE REST ARE EITHER P. H. D. STUDENTS OR MASTER STUDENTS
AND AGAIN MARTIN AND DAVID ARE HALF TIME WITH THE E. P. F. L. SO
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN AS MUCH SPACE AS WE WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE
OTHER THAN THAT NO ONE REALLY HAD ANY TIGHT CONSTRAINTS FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD
NO THEY WERE FINE WITH IT SO
YEAH WELL I MEAN IT DEPENDS IF YOU LIKE LOOKING OUT OVER THE OLD TOWN AND THE CATHEDRAL
SORT OF ON THAT SIDE THAT SIDE AND THEN THE LAST PART LOOKS ON THE OLD TOWN
BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE SIXTH FLOOR YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE EVERYTHING 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK BUILDINGS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN WAS IT SIX OR EIGHT FLOORS
AND THOSE ARE FIXED WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE
UM R
OH IN A WAY IF THAT'S YOUR ARGUMENTATION THEN PUT A VISITING PERSON WITH A SENIOR
WE SORT OF HAVE AN OPEN POLICY WHERE IF THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION THEN THAT'S FINE
WHICH IS SORT OF WHY IN OUR PROPOSAL WE HAD IT COMPLETELY AS A SEPARATE ROOM
SO IF YOU REALLY WANT PEACE AND QUIET YOU SHUT THE DOOR AND WHEN THE DOORS ARE SHUT
I MEAN SUPPOSE IF THE NEED REALLY ARISES AND IT COMES TO A POINT WHERE WE DO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE
NO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IT STARTED OFF SORT OF AS A DISCUSSION AT THE COFFEE TABLE
EVERYONE HAS A BOOKSHELF IN THEIR OFFICE AND WE JUST GO IN AND BORROW BOOKS FROM EVERYONE ELSE
IT'S MORE REALLY ABOUT HAVING A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO SIT UM WHERE IT'S NOT AN OFFICE ENVIRONMENT IT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE AN OFFICE
YEAH YEAH AND PEOPLE CAN COME W IN WITH THEIR STUFF OR LEAVE A NEWSPAPER OR A MAGAZINE LYING AROUND FOR OTHER PEOPLE
WE'VE GOT A BULLETIN BOARD WHERE YOU CAN PASTE UP ARTICLES THAT YOU THINK ARE B INTERESTING FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT
WELL SHE SHARES AN OFFICE SO WHICH IS WHY WE WERE THINKING THAT IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM TO S KEEP HER WITH A SPARE PERSON
AND IF YOU'RE A STAGIEUR AND YOU'RE COMING AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY EXPECT TO HAVE A FULL BLOWN OFFICE IF YOU ARE ONLY THERE FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS
GISELLA HAS A FIXED SCHEDULE FOR WHEN SHE'S THERE BUT DAVID AND MARTIN ARE SORT OF THEY F IT FLUCTUATES
IT'S JUST EITHER THERE'S TWO OR THREE PEOPLE IN THOSE ROOMS AND SOMETIMES THERE'S LESS SOMETIMES THERE'S MORE BECAUSE WE ALSO DON'T WORK FIXED HOURS
THEY SORT OF SEE THE VALUE OF IT AND THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE IT WIPED OUT ENTIRELY DEFINITELY
OKAY WELL SINCE THIS ONE'S UP KEEP THIS ONE IN
OUT
NO BOTH START WITH S. BUT
IN HERE
WELL FOR M MARTIN IF YOU DIDN'T MIND WORKING WITH MARTIN WE CAN SWITCH NANCY AND MARTIN HERE
AH
SO WE CAN SAY THAT THIS IS SORT OF FOR BUT THEN AGAIN YOU GET THE MORE FORMAL VISITOR IN WITH A BUNCH OF STUDENTS IN A CROWDED ROOM
INTO THIS ROOM
AND I AM TOO IN COMMON WITH MARIA
THAT'S GONNA BACK FIRE ON ME
I'LL CIRCULATE IT TO EVERYONE ALONG WITH THE NUMBERS THAT YOU GUYS WANTED TO SEE IN TERMS OF THE SPACE
SO YOU SA SO PIERRETTE IS A PROFESSOR BUT SHE'S ONLY SHE'S ONLY FIFTY PER CENT TIME
IS THAT WHY SHE'S IN A THREE PERSON OFFICE
LIKE BEYOND THIS M B BEYOND THIS CURRENT GROUP OF PEOPLE DO WE DO WE KNOW OF ANY CHANGES COMING
IS THE DEPARTMENT GROWING
AND HAVE YOU HAVE YOU TALKED TO TH ANY OF THESE PEOPLE TO ASK THEM IF THEY HAVE ANY
OF PEOPLE THEY NEEDED TO BE NEAR OR PEOPLE THEY WOULD NEEDED TO AVOID OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
IS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE VIEW
YOU GAVE THE READING ROOM THE BEST VIEW
OH TWO MOUNTAIN VIEWS
OH AND THAT'S OLD TOWN
AND SO I THERE'S NO ARE YOU PLANNING SOME KIND OF PARTITION BETWEEN THE LOUNGE AND THE OFFICES OR AR HOW ARE YOU GONNA KEEP THOSE THINGS I THINK SHOULD ASK THE QUESTION TO YOU
SO IF IF THE THOSE ARE STUDENTS THERE
AS A SEPARATE ROOM
SO THAT'S UM
THAT MAY ALSO THA THAT MAY BE GOOD FOR
UH YEAH I GUESS THAT'S LET'S SEE WHAT IS THAT
YOUR YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS A LOUNGE AND IT GETS USED A LOT
UH SH SHARED
IN TWO CASES
T. V. AT THE LOUNGE THE ADMIN ROOM SEPARATE
SO I GUESS WHAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS HOW IMPORTANT IS THE READING ROOM TO YOUR GROUP REALLY
IS IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S A VERY VALUED THING THAT HAS TO BE PROTECTED UM
OR IS IT OKAY TO L MAKE IT BE KIND OF THIS SPARE SPACE THAT GETS USED UP A LITTLE BIT WHEN YOU NEED WHEN YOU HAVE SOME EXTRA VISITORS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
BUT I SUPPOSE ONCE IT IF IT GETS EATEN AWAY A LITTLE BIT AT ONE SOME POINT IT BECOMES UNUSEFUL AND THEN YEAH
OH I SEE
JUST S. UH SO JUST TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE OKAY
IS YOUR PERSON TO SQUARE METER RATIO WITHIN THE N UNIVERSITY NORMS
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE COMING IN SEEING THIS LAVISH READING ROOM AND AND AND EVERYONE HAVING THEIR OWN OFFICE IF THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE HAVING IN THE OTHER PLACES
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT UM IF FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A SPARE READING ROOM LIKE WE WERE SAYING BEFORE
BUT IF YOU BOTH AGREE WITH THIS PLAN AND YOU THINK YOUR GROUP WILL BE HAPPY THEN UH FINE WITH ME
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK
UH ACTUALLY MARTIN IS FIFTY PER CENT TIME
OH BECAUSE YOU WOULD SAY THAT SHE'S AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE SEE MAYBE WE CAN MOVE A LITTLE BIT AROUND JUST TO GIVE HER UH
WELL ALSO AT LEAST MAYBE NOT A UH AN OFFICE ALONE BUT AT LEAST WITH JUST ONE PERSON NOT TWO
YEAH NO MOUNTAINS ARE JUST IN THE FAR SO THAT'S NOT
UM WELL UH I CAN THINK OF SOME REACTIONS FROM THE PEOPLE WI SO MAYBE I CAN WELL R
SO AS YOU CAN SEE WELL UM SUSAN GETS OBVIOUSLY THE SAME OFFICE WHICH IS QUITE A GOOD THING
BUT THE MOST OBVIOUS CONSTRAINTS THAT UH WE WE FOUND HERE WAS THAT IT WAS PROBABLY VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE A LOUNGE UH JUST A LOUNGE IN ONE ROOM
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S TRUE THAT THE GROUP I AGREE DECIDED TO TO HAD TO HAVE A LOUNGE
WE PROPOSE TO PUT THE LOUNGE UH IN THE ROOM AT THE THE UPPER SIDE ON ON THE RIGHT
PEOPLE ARE NOT THERE TO TALK VERY LOUD BUT THEY CAN SIT AND RELAX AND UH STILL LOOK AT AT THE MOUNTAINS
SO IT APPEARED AT LEAST TO WELL TO OUR GROUP
SHE SHOULD HAVE AN OFFICE BY HER OWN BECAUSE IT WOULD BE QUITE DISTURBING FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO TO WORK IN THE THE SAME OFFICE
IT'S TRUE THAT THIS BLOCKS ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOMS BUT UH ON THE OTHER HAND
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT PIERRETTE SHARING AN OFFICE WITH TWO PERSONS BUT AT LEAST NO PROBLEM IN PIERRETTE SHARING HER OFFICE WITH UH MARIANNE
UH YOU NOTICE A NEW NAME IN THE ROOM UH AT THE CENTRE UPPER UPPER SIDE
AND THE TWO UH VIS ONE AND VIS TWO ARE THE VISITOR PLACES
YOU HAD ONE I THINK CALLED FREE SPACE OR SPARE SPARE PLACE
SO NOT TO HAVE ONE EMPTY ROOM WHEN WE HAVE NO VISITORS UM AND UH THEN A VERY FULL ROOM WHEN EVERYBODY IS IS HERE
EXACTLY SO THE VISITORS ARE UH BASICALLY STAGIEUR AND IT HAPPENS THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TWO OF THEM EVEN IF IT'S ONLY FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTH
IT'S TRUE THAT THESE ONE OR TWO LAST ONE OR TWO YEARS WE DIDN'T HAVE UH A VISITING PROFESSOR
YEAH SO UH I THINK YEAH THESE ARE THE THREE MAIN POINTS
THESE I THINK ARE THE THREE MAIN DIFFERENCES
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S TRUE I THINK YEAH THEY ARE ARE QUITE OPEN TO TO THIS
MARTIN ALSO REMINDED US THAT HE IS QUITE NOISY
HE HAS A LOT OF UH PHONE CALLS TO MAKE EVEN IF IT'S HERE IF HE'S HERE ONLY FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TIME
LIKE SAYING OH I I HAVE TO REDUCE HER T FROM EIGHTY PER CENT TO FIFTY PER CENT
YEAH WE YEAH THAT'S TRUE THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
YEAH WELL IT WAS ACTUALLY THIS PRESSURE FROM FROM MY GROUP THAT LED TO THIS TO SQUEEZE A LITTLE BIT UH THE PLACE OF THE LOUNGE
NOW HOW FOR INSTANCE WOULD THE UNIVERSITY FEEL ABOUT A ROOM THAT WOULD BE ONLY USED AS A LOUNGE
OR W IS THERE NO PROBLEM
THE DO DO YOU SEE A PROBLEM WITH HAVING A L A ROOM JUST FOR A LOUNGE OR NO
SO WE COULD HAVE A SEPARATE ROOM AS A LOUNGE AS LONG AS UH WE PACK THE OTHER OFFICES
UM I THINK IT'S WHAT I TRIED TO TO DO BEFORE IT'S THE SHARED LOUNGE UH TH
AN
UH
BUT THEN WE NEED TO SQUEEZE IN IN ONE OF THE THREE PERSON ROOMS SOME EXTRA VISITOR SPACE AND UH I I THINK SO
I THINK ANOTHER POINT HERE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU YOU FEEL ABOUT IT IS WELL
THE FACT THAT MARTIN IS SAID HE WOULD BE QUITE NOISY FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TIME
OR IF YOU PREFER WORKING FROM MINE AND DOING OTHER CHANGES
DEPENDS HOW HOW EASY YOU CAN WRITE IN IT
UH
WE WE NEVER ASKED THEM IT COULD BE BUT UM ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY HAVE
I THINK NO REAL PROJECT IN COMMON SO I WONDER
WHE I I THINK I WOULD PREFER AND PROBABLY MY GROUP WOULD PREFER
TO SEE THEM WITH THE RESPECTIVE ASSISTANTS AND I THINK PIERRETTE PLUS MARIANNE IS A VERY GOOD COMBINATION
HOW DO YOU FEEL BECAUSE YOUR OFFICE WELL THREE PERSONS AND YOU ARE ALL FULL TIME IN THERE SO YOU WITH NANCY AND MARIA
OR WE COULD GET THAT OFFICE FOR YOU AND NANCY AND PUT NIKOS AND UH YALINA WITH MARIA AND A VISITOR
YEAH BUT A VISITOR ACTUALLY UH DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH PAPER SO FOR INSTANCE MAYBE THEY DON'T NEED UH
BECAUSE REMEMBER THERE IS ALSO THIS PAOLA ARRIVING UM ON THE NEW PROJECT
HA
THAT'S NICE AND HE IS FIFTY PER CENT SO THAT MEANS THE OFFICE IS NOT VERY CROWDED
WELL WHAT WAS SAID IN IN MY GROUP ACTUALLY SUSAN WHO KNOWS PROFESSORS FROM OTHER UM OTHER FACULTIES
IT'S TRUE THAT THE READING ROOM BUT YOU KNOW WE FOUGHT SO MUCH TO HAVE IT SO LET'S UH LET'S TRY TO HAVE IT THERE
SO I THINK WE'RE YEAH ON WELL THE REACTION OF MY GROUP WAS THAT THIS WAS ALMOST FULL ALREADY SO I WELL WE TRIED TO
I THIN
MAR
AH
YEAH HO
BUT YOU NO SPECIFIC UH VIEWS FOR MOUNTAINS OR OLD TOWN OR I MEAN PEOPLE PREFER ANY WINDOWS
OH OH K OKAY OH 'KAY
BUT HOW OFTEN THE LOUNGE IS USED UM
SO YOU HAVE SOME OH
YOU MEAN THESE FIFTY PER CENTS I MEAN THEY'RE ALL SEPARATE OR
N D
MAYBE CAN YOU COMBINE BOTH OR LIKE IN TWO PERSON ROOM PIERRETTE TOO
BUT THEN YOU CAN CREATE ON MORE SPARED PLACE IN THAT BIG THREE PIECE ROOM NO
AND SHE WILL
YEAH AND GIVE THAT ROOM TO F SOME PROFESSOR WITH A STUDENT OR FROM FOR VISITOR WITH THE VISITING PLACE OR
OH MM
MM IT LOOKS LIKE SMALL ROOM COMPARED TO THE OTHER THREE P
YEAH I HAVE ACTUALLY YEAH THE WE CAN SEE THE REPORT HERE AND THE DEMO
AND AS YOU SAW AS YOU SAW IN THE EMAIL I SENT UH OKAY
YEAH HERE ON THE LEFT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS BUT UH AS APPLIED
AND IF YOU CLICK ON UH PLUS BUTTON YOU CAN EXPAND IT AND SEE THE KEY FRAMES THAT ARE IN FACT UH FIVE EXTRACTED FRAMES FROM THE SHOT
BUT I THINK TH UH AS IT IS IT'S T EXTRACTED UH WITHOUT UH USING SUB SHOTS UH IT'S SIMPLY UH FIVE DOWN SAM YEAH DOWN SAMPLING
UM SO I WE CAN SEE THE VIDEO ACTUALLY UH THE ENTIRE VIDEO CAN OPEN WITH REAL PLAYER
UH OKAY
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS ONE IF WE SEE WAS CORRECTLY UH YOU SEE
BUT THERE IS A MOON
AND WE DIDN'T USE MOTION FEATURES AT ALL FOR THAT THAT'S WHY I WE
I DON'T KNOW IF WE C WE WANT TO MAKE UH USE THE WHITEBOARD OR HERE IT'S UH IT WAS UH TO DIS IT'S INFRA ONLY THE THIS PART ABOUT UH SHOT BOUNDARY DETECTION IS IN FRENCH UNFORTUNATELY
BUT UH THE THIS IMAGE SHOWS THE RESULTS USING MOTION WHEN YOU S USE THE MOTION FEATURES AND HERE ON THE RIGHT IS WHEN USING THE HISTOGRAM UH DISTANCE
NO NO NOW IT'S UH WELL FOR THE VIDEO YOU SAW IT WA IT'S BHATTACHARYA
UM WE HAVE ALREADY ALL THE DATA THAT IS ON THE GRAPH
IN FA WE WANT TO DETECT THAT UH THIS POINTS IN THE MIDDLE IS HIGHER THAN UH
TH
BUT IF YOU ARE IN THE MAXIMUM ALREADY AND AT THIS POINT WE CHECK SIMPLY IF UH THIS VALUE IS ALPHA TIMES THE THE MAX OF THE OTHER POINTS
UM I MAYBE FOR CHI IT'S IT SIX BUT UH YEAH BUT UH FOR BHATTACHARYA IT'S FOR THE TESTS I DID IT TWO POINT FOUR
UH I IN THE THE FIRST SHOT
THIS IS IDIAP LAPTOP SO YOU CAN U OKAY
OH THERE IS NO HA HA
I DIDN'T UH HA I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO THE THE REAL MEDIA
AT TWO POINT FOUR
I CAN SEE UH THERE IS ANOTHER PROGRAMME THAT CAN SEE
IT'S I THINK IT'S F THERE THERE ARE FIVE NORMALLY
AND THEN UH SO I USED THE PROGRAMME FROM UH SOFTWARE FROM SEBASTIEN P. P. A. P. M. TO A. V. I.
IT'S UH IT DOESN'T UH COMPILE ANYMORE ON DEBIAN MACHINES AND YEAH SOME MAYBE SOME WORK HAS TO BE DONE ON THIS
I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS UH IMAGE DOESN'T APPEAR THIS IS THE UM UM THE FRAME THAT IS UH UH EXTRACTED TO BE THE SHOT KEY FRAME HERE
THIS ONE IS THIS ONE THE MIDDLE ONE
BUT WHAT I CAN SHOW YOU NOW IS A LITTLE PROGRAMME IF WE WANT TO BE UM VERY PRECISE ABOUT SO IT'S MA GET FRAMES
AND WE WERE INTERESTED IN AROUND WHAT DI DO YOU WANT
THIS IS A FRAME NUMBER THIS IS IN SECOND BUT I I KEPT THE FRAME NUMBER
SO IF WE DO EVERY SECOND UH I D THE MIDDLE FRAME IS UH THIS ONE THOUSAND
DO YOU THI IT'S ANOTHER KIND OF BROWSING PAGE
BUT UH TO BE MORE PRECISE ABOUT UH TO TO CHECK MAYBE THE THIS YEAH EXACTLY YEAH YEAH
ANYWAY YOU GO BACK TO ONE FRAME AROUND F ONE SIXTY FOR INSTANCE I DON'T KNOW
SO THIS WOULD MA BE MADE UH MANUALLY ACTUALLY
WHEN YOU SAY FROM THIS SHOT TO THIS SHOT IS USING A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE SOMEONE WHO WOULD DO MANUALLY FOR EACH VIDEO
AH OKAY
THIS IS THE ONE IN THE D. V. D.
MAYBE OKAY WE CAN UH SEE A LITTLE BIT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE
YEAH UH OKAY
AH OKAY YEAH YEAH YEAH
BECAUSE HE DID THE MOVIE SO HE WANTS T OKAY TO ARCHIVE HE WANTS TO OKAY
TH
IF I GO TO MENU THERE IS SOMETHING
NO OLD MENU UH THERE IS NO MENU IN THE D. V. D.
SO THIS IS THE SAME VIDEO A THE THE A. V. I. NUMBER ONE
AND ON THE ON THE D. V. D. I SAW THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER STUFF
AH OKAY
UH
SO THAT WE'LL USE THE WHITEBOARD
UM FOR INSTANCE YOU SEE UM ON THE UH ON THE U. R. L. I PUT OKAY I I DISCO THERE IS M. M. M. DOT IDIAP DOT C. H. SLASH V. C. G. I. BIN
WHEN YOU LOG INTO M. M. M. AS WITH A C. C. S. S. H. FOR INSTANCE UM SO YOU JUST PUT IT'S WORKING LIKE THIS M. M. M. DATA
UH OKAY SLASH
THIS NAME SO I WILL SAY THIS IS VIDEO NAME SO VIDEO NAME
DOT A. V. I. YOU JUST BECAUSE WE NEED THE A. V. I. SO THAT WE CAN UH
OH UH F AND ALSO FOR THE
YEAH AND THIS IS NO NO NO UH THIS IS DONE ON THE FLY
SO YOU NEED THAT YOU NEED UH THE X. M. L. V SO IT'S VIDEO NAME
AND I COULD DATA DOT X. M. L. BUT IN FACT IT'S JUST A SIMPLE CONVENTION I W COULD HAVE PUT NOTHING BUT I JUST PUT DATA
THE IT'S A CONVENTION
THE NAME IS NO OF IN FACT YEAH IS IS YEAH
YEAH IS THE SAME AS THE DIRECTORY
AND THIS OUTPUT YEAH AS YOUR THIS OUTPUT UH THIS FILE IS AN OUTPUT FROM THE MM THE SOFTWARE THE SHOT BOUNDARY DETECTION SOFTWARE
UH YEAH I DON'T YEAH WE CANNOT SEE
IT'S YEAH IT'S UH THA VIDEO SCENE SHOT
IT'S HIERARCHICAL IN X. M. L. AND KEY FRAME TIME STAMP AND THE AND FROM THE TIME STAMP AND THE VIDEO LOCATION HE KNOWS HOW TO GET THE FRAME
SO THAT UM WHEN UH YOU ASK FOR THIS FRAME IN FACT WE CAN OKAY I JUST VIEW FRAME SOURCE
UP WE GO THERE AND THIS IS UM IN FACT IT'S A PERL PROGRAMME THAT OUTPUTS IN FA INSTEAD OF OUTPUTTING H. T. M. L. OR TEXT IT OUTPUTS UH J. PEG
AND THIS IMAGE IS I THIS IMAGE IS OUTPUT UH OUTPUTTED TO THE CLIENT
I F THERE ARE YEAH THE M. M. M. DEVELOPERS SO I'M PART OF THAT BUT UH WE COULD WE COULD UH YEAH IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
UM I WANTED TO SAW TO SEE TO DO S SAY SOMETHING ELSE
UM OH YEAH AND THE IMAGES ARE SENT TO YOUR BROWSER THE CLIENT TO THIS BROWSER
BUT ALSO KEPT IN UH A DIRECTORY IN UH ON M. M. M.
UM FOR THE CACHE UH
WE HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE ON M. M. M. SO THE THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM AH YEAH FOR A NEW WINDOW
BUT UH YEAH ON M. M. M. F NOW WE DON'T HAVE SUCH MANY VIDEOS SO
BUT IT IT CAN GO IN THE BROWSER CACHE ALSO
WELL HERE IT'S IT WAS CACHE BECAUSE I ALREADY PRESSED PREVIEW BUT NOW IT'S ON THE FLY
AND THEN IF YOU COME YEAH
AND MAYBE THEY ARE ON THE CACHE OF THIS BROWSER THIS COMPUTER
OH THE MOVIES OR
IN FACT UH WE WE WE COULD YOU KNOW OKAY YOU KNOW ALL THESE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE THAT YOU SEE UH OKAY
WE COULD PUT UH CINETIS SLASH HERE AND THEN A CINETIS SLASH IS THE SA YEAH IT WORKS
BUT THE UH TH THE POINT IS THIS INTERFACE IS UH I THINK SIX OR SEVEN FILES ONLY
YEAH WE W WE COPY ALL THE FILES AND THERE IS UH JUST ONE UM ONE PARAMETER ONE UH STRING
Y IT'S UH EX EXTENSIBLE AND UH IS
YEAH BUT I IT'S NOT UH IT WAS UH YOU KNOW THI THIS IS WORKING THE EXPAND ALL BUT UH THIS IS UH
ON A VIDEO ANNOTATION ON A VIDEO STRUCTURE CO CORRECTION
FOR THAT YOU NEED IT'S POSSIBLE MAYBE UH ON INTERFACES LIKE FLASH OR JAVA
ALESSANDRO UH ASKED ME TO DO THE SAME THING AND WE I PUT UH WE HAD UH LIKE A PASSWORD CONVENTION
WELL IF YEAH IT IS THERE IS NO POSSIBLE PRODUCTIONS FOR THESE VIDEOS
BUT UH IF PO YEAH IT'S DEMO AND UH ONE CAN SAY YOU HAVE TO GUESS THE NAME TO BUT UH YEAH
BU Y YEAH A GOOD POINT UH ABOUT PASSWORD PROTECTION ISSUES UH OR THE PRIVACY ISSUES UH
UH HA YEAH ALL THE FRAMEWORK IS READY WITH A T. R. S. T. S. R. VIDEOS SO
A PURELY SECURE DIRECTORY WE P WE WE PUT A CO CODE NUMBER LIKE UH SO THAT IT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS INSTEAD OF VIDEO M UH NAME EQUALS KAYAK THEN WE WOULD HAVE UH ZERO SIX SEVEN UH FIVE OR
BUT ALSO WE SHOULD TAKE CARE THAT IN FACT M. M. M. IT'S IN M. M. M. DATA VIDEO BROWSER AND THIS IS ACCESSIBLE FROM OUTSIDE
YEAH SIMPLE THINGS WITH PRIVACY ISSUES BUT UH I THERE ARE SOME METHODS AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THINGS PRIVATE
I THINK UH WE NEED TO GO A LITTLE BIT THROUGH THE CODE AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TO TO HELP TO TO FOR INSTANCE THE CLASSES ABOUT VIDEO STRUCTURE
YEAH IN FACT IT'S NOT THERE IS NO TOSH I IT WAS CALLED VISION LIB TO READ UH TO TO EXTRACT ONE FRAME EACH FRAME OF A VIDEO
SO IT WA FROM SEBASTIEN IT WAS IN THE TOSH LIBRARY
BUT UH IT'S NOTHING W TO DO WITH TOSH AND IT'S USING UH UH THE OPEN C. V. AND UH SOME CLASSES FROM UH JEAN MARC UH FOR
UM SO IT'S FOUR THIRTY SO WE NEED ONE HOUR IT'S IT'S GOOD
VIDEO IN OKAY
AND ALSO SOME OTHER STUFF S FOR INSTANCE ALPHA THRESHOLD WE TALKED ABOUT IS SET TO TWO POINT FOUR AND UH YEAH
YEAH BUT UH IT DOESN'T W YEAH IT IT'S BETTER TO TO KEEP IT ONE
LEAVE IT TO ONE YEAH
UH YEAH
M UM I'M QUITE HAPPY TO TO TO DO THAT I IT'S GOOD WHEN YOU DO UH SOMETHING THAT THERE IS SOMEONE USING IT
AT LEAST YEAH WITH THE INTERFACE IT'S QUITE FUNNY TO TO SEE UM D THAT THE Q QUICKLY YOU CAN DO SOMETHING IN IN YEAH
IN THIRTY T IF THE VIDEO I TEN IS TEN MINUTES IN THIRTY MINUTES 'CAUSE IT'S NO NOT A LOT OF THINGS TO CHANGE
SO THE REAL MEDIA IS UH YEAH A PARALLEL THING THAT FROM THE A. V. I. YOU CONVERT IT INTO REAL MEDIA AND IT IS DONE ON WINDOWS
UH
MM THERE IS A A THE FREE ONE IS OKAY
YOU CAN USE THE FREE WE HAVE A LICENSE HERE AT IDIAP BUT UH THE IF YOU WANT TO PAY
UH YEAH
WELL THIS IS YOU CAN BUY OR YOU CAN ORDER FOR FREE ON INTERNET
AND UM YOU DIDN'T SEE BUT THE RE THE REAL MEDIA UM IS CALLED VIA A REAL SERVER
SO SO IT'S UH THE STRUCTURE IS SUCH AS UH VI VIDEO SEGMENTATION WITH UH VIDEOS IN BEGIN AND THEN FOR EACH SHOT YOU HAVE AN I. D. WELL THIS IS THE TERMS FROM M. PEG SEVEN CONVENTION
SHOT BEGIN AND END
AND IN FACT THAT'S WHAT I OUTPUT IN UH ON THE YEAH I THINK Y ON THE INTERFACE
BUT WE YEAH EVEN WE SHOULD UH FOR INSTANCE FOR THE VIDEOS UH FOR THE SPECTRAL CLUSTERING FOR THE CLUSTERING
NO NO NO NO THE IN THE THE GAP TO FIND THE THE GOOD NUMBER OF CLUSTERS IS SO SENSITIVE UH
IT'S IT'S A BIT LATER IN THE IN THE REPORT
SO WE ARE HERE TO JUST MAKE THE POINT
TO SO YOU HAVE APPLIED THE SHOT DETECTOR TO SOME OF THE CINETIS VIDEO OR AT LEAST ONE AND UH SO WE CAN BASICALLY MAYBE JUST COMMENT ON ON THIS
I MEAN YOUR REPORT IT'S IT SHOULD BE DESCRIBED THERE OR YEAH YEAH
AH OKAY YES THE KAYAK WI I WAS NOT EVEN WITH THE OTHER ONE OKAY
SO THIS IS HIERARCHICAL NORMALLY SO YOU HAVE SCENES AND SHOTS BUT
LIKE GROUP ALL THE INITIAL ONES INTO ONE SCENE AND MAYBE AFTER WHEN THERE'S SOME THINGS INSIDE IT S SHOULD BE ANOTHER SCENE SO
YEAH THE QUALITY IS THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING THAT
SO HERE WE SEE THAT WE THE SHOT AT EIGHTEENTH AND AFTER TWENTY TWOS AND AFTER AGAIN
UH YEAH OKAY SHOT NINE CURRENTLY SHOT TEN PROBABLY
ELEVEN OR TWELVE
OR NO THIS IS TEN INDEED OKAY
IT'S REALLY A DISSOLVE OR IS IT REALLY LIKE IS YOU HAVE THE FEELING THAT IT'S BOTH
N YEAH YEAH
BUT AS I SAID I MEAN UH WITH EVEN THE MOTION DETECTOR WHEN IT'S BLACK IT'S THERE IS NOT S NO STRUCTURE
BUT IT'S NOT EVEN SURE BECAUSE THE BACKGROUND IS QUITE SIMILAR AND UH IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT THAT SURE
SO THERE IS NO STRUCTURE INDEED SO OF COURSE WHEN YOU LOOK THE HORSE AND THEN YOU CAN SEE AS A COW THE COWS
OF COURSE YOU HAVE A BLACK IN THE TOP AND UH YOU HAVE ALSO UH MAYBE EIGHTY PERCENT OF LIKE GREEN UH
YOU HAVE STONES AND UH SO THERE OF COURSE ARE DIFFERENCES BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE HORSE BUT IT'S BLACK
WHEN THERE IS MOTION YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF THINGS CHANGING SO BY USING AN L. R. T. T. THRESHOLD
IT'S ONLY IF YOU HAVE AN IDENTIFIED PEAK WHICH IS M FIFTY PERCENT OR MAYBE UH TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN THE THE NEXT SECOND VALUE IN THE WINDOW
BUT AN ANYWAY IT'S DIFFICULT I MEAN IN TH IN IN IN GENERAL
RIGHT IF MY IMAGE IS THERE BUT AFTER IT'S THERE AND IT LOOKS AT HOW MANY POINTS C ARE WELL MATCHED
SO BASICALLY YOU WOULD SEE THAT THE NUMBER OF POINTS MAYBE ONLY TEN PERCENT OF THE POINTS YOU CAN MATCH WELL SO IT'S EASY TO DETECT
UH AND HERE YOU BASICALLY HERE WITH A HISTOGRAM UH YOU CAN SEE IT VERY FLAT
YEAH SO YEAH AND YOU HAVE MAYBE A ONE IMAGE WITH A UM ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD I THINK
UH
TWO POINT FOUR YEAH SO IT'S A BIT LESS BECAUSE THE AMPLITUDE IS MUCH SMALLER YEAH
UH YEAH
F BECAUSE F ESPECIALLY WITH CHI TWO SQUARE IT R THE AMPLITUDE IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN WITH BHATTACHARYA RIGHT
WITH BHATTACHARYA IT'S BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE SO YOU HAVE NOT SO MUCH AMPLITUDE
UM BUT UH STILL UH IN SOME OF THE V THESE VIDEOS FOR INSTANCE EVEN IF WE GON GO NOW IF WE WANT TO
IT WAS IT AS A SHOT OKAY
BUT HERE FOR INSTANCE YOU UNDERSTAND SO WE CAN SHOW THIS TOMORROW TO UH TO THE PEOPLE AT THE CI CINETIS MEETING I MEAN TO
AH YOU DIDN'T GENERATE THE OKAY THE REAL MEDIA
I WAS BECAUSE HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MOTION UH HERE IS UH YOU KNOW HE IS UH DOING A ZOOM ON THE TWO KAYAKS HERE
YEAH AND THEN HE'S DOING QUITE A FAST TRANSITION FROM THESE TO ANOTHER ONE
AND I WAS WONDERING WHETHER SO IF YOU WELL THOUGH OF COURSE IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S MAINLY WATER
IT'S WITH THE IMAGES I GAVE YOU OR OKAY
AH TO REGENERATE AN A. V. I. FILE OKAY YEAH YEAH
AH OKAY SO THE OKAY SO THE HERE IS AN IMAGE NUMBER
AH OKAY OKAY YEAH
YEAH IT'S MOTION YEAH IT'S NOT A CUT
BUT IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S MAINLY WATER WHEN WE SEE THINGS SO IT'S YEAH IT'S NOT SUCH A BIG UH BUT YEAH
PEOPLE SAY THIS IS A CUT THIS IS NOT A CUT BUT LIKE FOR DISSOLVE EVEN SOMETIMES
YEAH I MEAN IT'S A SO SOMETIMES VERY DIFFICULT
TOO A BIT WHITER I THINK THIS TYPE OF THINGS SHOULD BE FINE
BUT BY JUST LOOKING AT THE KEY FRAMES AND SO ON THEY MAY SAY OKAY
FROM THIS SHOT TO THIS SHOT WE APPLY LIKE UH SPECIFIC UM COLOUR ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM OR RESTORATION ALGORITHM OR UH TO IMPROVE UH THE BRIGHTNESS AND SOMETHING LIKE THIS RIGHT
WELL MAYBE AFTER I MEAN THEY WOULD SH OKAY UH THEY WOULD GO DIRECTLY AND SAY SELECT THE SHOTS FROM HERE TO HERE
SO OF COURSE WE COULD TRY TO MAKE SCENE CLUSTERING AND SO ON BUT I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT THIS IS NECESSARY FOR THEM AT THIS POINT
FOR THEM IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO LOOK AT FROM HERE TO HERE I APPLY THIS AND THEY CAN DO IT QUITE QUICKLY
AND THEY HAVE TO DO IT AN TO DO IT ANYWAY
SO THIS MIGHT TAKE MORE TIME THAN HAVING TO CLICK TWO TIMES ON TWO SHOTS RATHER THA THA THAN UH HAVING DIRECTLY A SCENE RIGHT
IF THEY WANT TO DO STABILISATION IT MAY NOT BE SURE OF THAT
UH THIS IS THE RIGHT SEGMENTATION FOR SOME OF THESE BUT SO BUT THIS IS ANOTHER POINT WHICH FOR MOTION STABILISATION
AS I SAID SEVERAL TIME WE ARE NOT WE DID NOT COMMIT TO PROVIDE ANYTHING
YEAH BUT AFTER I MEAN IT MAY BE MORE LIKE A GUY UM I INT I IN AN INTERFACE A GUY INTERFACE
UH THIS IS A SAME SEG THEY MAY DO THE GROUPING BY THEMSELVES QUITE BY LOOKING AT THIS IT MAY TAKE W W LESS ONE ONE MINUTES
AND I THINK IT'S ANYWAY IF IT'S TOO SUMMARISED AFTER THEY MAY WANT TO GO INSIDE UH TO SEE WHETHER THERE IS NOT SPECIAL THINGS I MEAN SO
INDEED YOU COULD PROVIDE LIKE THE A. V. I. TO THE CLIENTS
AND HE MAY ASK FOR SPECIAL SERVICES OR UH AND EVEN TO JUST TO WATCH THE MOVIE TO HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO DIFFERENT PARTS AND SO ON
BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE I MEAN HE WE WANTS TO HAVE THIS AND THIS AND UH RIGHT SO
OTHERWISE I MEAN THIS BUT OF BUT OF COURSE IT MIGHT BE EASY TO DO A VERY SIMPLE SOFTWARE
AND AFTER IT WOULD GENERATE AUTOMATICALLY SOME INDEX AND UH AS A I SUPPOSE THE CLIENT MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SUCH A SUCH A THINGS IF HE COULD UH GENERATE AUTOMATICALLY ON THE D. V. D.
YOU COULD ALLOW HIM TO L TO WATCH THIS TYPE OF INTERFACE AND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SELECTION
HE WOULD INDEED UH GET ALREADY THE CHAPTERS THAT HE DECIDED TO PUT THERE
UH YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS UH THIS IS A VERY GOOD UH AND A YEAH
SO THIS IS A KIND OF SERVICE I DON'T KNOW EITHER THEY GIVE IT FOR FREE AND UH
UH YOU I IT COULD BE PROPOSED
BUT FOR INSTANCE HERE IT I WOU IT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC TO HAVE MOTION
AH OKAY SO MAYBE LIKE HERE FOR INSTANCE IT IS A JUST REPRODUCED TWO TIMES UH
AH OKAY SO THIS IS NOT THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN UH
I MEAN TO ESPECIALLY IF UH WE NEED TO INTERFACE NEW UH UM YEAH OR FOR JUST READING
I MEAN THE THE D. V. X. AND THING LIKE THIS SO IT'S UH UH SO TOMOR ANYWAY FOR THIS WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY YET
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SURE WHAT THEY WANT TO WHAT THE USER'S TOOLS FOR READING D. V. D. AND SO ON SO
AND S BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS IS SO DIFFICULT NOW YOU HAVE UM ALREADY LOOKED AT THE HISTOGRAMS AND OPEN C. V. COMPUTING DISTANCES AND SO ON
BUT UH BUT YEAH THE INTERFACE IS VERY SO THE INTERFACE USES THE OUTPUT OF YOUR PROGRAMME
OH NO NO YOU NEED YOU NEED TO GENERATE THESE IMAGES RIGHT
AS A DIRECTORY YEAH YEAH
ON THE SHOT
AND IT'S A SIMPLE FORMAT I SUPPOSE LIKE UH LIKE YOU HAVE SCENES AND SHOTS AND UH KEY S SOME TIME STAMPS
AH OKAY YEAH
YEAH IF YO
SO YOU SEE IT FINE BUT SUDDENLY YOU HAVE ONE OTHER FRAME THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
OH YOU MEAN BAC BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IT'S THE M. M. M. CACHE
SO THIS MEANS THAT WHEN IT'S DONE IF I GO ON MY COMPUTER AND I DO THE SAME IT'S NOT GOING TO ENTER IN MY CACHE
SO IT'S TH IT'S SO IT'S NOT DONE ON IT'S SO IT'S NOT DONE ONLINE
THE FIRST TIME YEAH BUT AFTER IT'S IT TAKE OKAY
YOU TH OKAY
UH
FRO FROM OUTSIDE WE CAN VIEW THEM
YEAH FROM HOME I WAS ABLE TO ACCESS THEM
NOBODY ACTUALLY IT HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED SEVERAL TIMES AND PEOPLE THERE ARE SOME LAWYERS THAT ARE PUTTING NO
Y
AH OKAY YEAH YEAH
YEAH IT WAS THE SAME THE SAME ONES AS THE ONE YOU SAW UH IN MY CODE YEAH
YEAH UH OKAY
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IS THE SH UH THE D THE SHOT
I DON'T KNOW I'M I'M SURE THAT THEY WILL BE WELL I HOPE THEY WILL BE A OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS YEAH
HO HOW DO YOU GENERATE THE REAL MEDIA YEAH
OH O O OH YEAH YOU MEAN THE JAVA FRAMEWORK UH WHAT UH MIKE PRESENTED
OKAY SO I THINK THIS WAS GOOD TO SEE THE THE TOOL AND UH TOMORROW WE ARE GOING TO RE SAY MOST OF THE THINGS
BUT SHORTER I F I BELIEVE RIGHT I MEAN IT'S BAD TO EXPLAIN
YEAH MI THIS MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO SEE TOMORROW
OF COURSE MAYBE THERE WAS THE AH ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SHOTS OR IT'S A LOT
BUT I THINK I THINK IS IT'S TOO IT'S GOING VERY BE VERY TO BE VERY GOOD FOR THEM TO VISUALISE HOW YOU CAN ORGANISE THINGS AND MAYBE WHAT THEY CAN DO
HOW THEY AND SO THIS IS IMPORTANT
AH TH THE GAP YOU MEAN OR NO
SEE THE CUT
I WILL LOOK TO HAVE A CONNECTION
UH OKAY
AH OKAY
FORTY MINUTES AND ABOUT UH
BECAUSE UH THIS WILL MAKE ABOUT UH FIVE SECONDS FOR EACH SHOT SO I THINK IT'S VERY SHORT
I IF THIS IS TO R TO TO TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THE COLOUR LIGHT AND UH THEY HAVE A LOT OF UH SHOTS
AH OKAY
YEAH UH I THINK I THINK THEY MADE SOME UH SPECIAL EFFECT IN THIS D. V. D.
UH THERE IS TWO OR THREE TIME UH YOU SEE YOU SEE THE SAME UH SAME KIND OF UH SCENE UH JUST UH TWO OR THREE SECONDS
THERE IS JUST ONE UH ONE CHAPTER AND NO MENU
UH
NO BUT YES THIS IS THE SAME BUT UH THERE WAS A PROBLEM WHEN DO THE GRAB FROM THE D. V. D. TO THE FILES
BUT NOW I HAVE ONE FILE ALSO IN THE SO YOU CAN PROCESS AGAIN ONE TIME
IS IS A
BUT ON THE ON THE ON THE SERVER THE ORIGINAL IS A F VIDEO FILM
IN THIS ONE OKAY
SO UH WE NEED TO REMOVE THE CACHE FOR THIS VIDEO OR THIS IS AUTOMATIC
YEAH BUT WHAT I MEAN IS I I I I I IF I IF I PUT THE SAME VIDEO WITH THE SAME NAME INSTEAD OF THIS ONE
AH OKAY
ON THE M. M. M. YEAH
OH IT'S GREEK BUT UH OKAY
OKAY BUT NOW YOU HAVE S YOU HAVE BOTH CACHE
YES COMPUTER TOO YES TO UH BUT OKAY
EVERY FOR EXAMPLE IF WE MAKE A LOT OF UH FILM UH FOR CINETIS UH ALL ARE ON THE TOP
I MEAN UH ALL THE FILM ARE Y YOU YOU DON'T HAVE A SEPARATION FOR THE FILM FOR CINETIS OR FOR THE PROJECT AND S
WELL YOU SAY VIDEO NAME EQUAL ALL ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL
IF WE NEED TO MAKE SOME SPECIAL THING ON THE BROWSER IT'S T
AND ALL THESE UH FILE ARE ONLY UH INTERNAL
THIS MEAN UH IF I GO T ON UH C CINTETIS CINETIS UH
UH
BHATTACHARYA OKAY AND SO ON OKAY
SO WE CAN FORGET TOSH AND UH USE UH INPUT SE THE INPUT READER FOR THE THE M. PEG WE CAN RE LO USE UH OPEN C. V.
UH YEAH
AH OKAY
UH SO JUST UH LAST QUESTION MAYBE UH SO THIS MAKES A X. M. L. FILE
THIS IS THE THE PROGRAMME TO TO GENERATING THE X. M. L. FILE AND THE THE SHOT
AND UH WITH THE KAYAK YOU HAVE ONE PROBLEMS YOU DON'T HAVE THE REAL MEDIA SO THIS IS ANOTHER THING
BUT UH ANYWAY YOU NEED YOU NEED TO HAVE WINDOWS TO MAKE THESE
THIS NOT UH IDIAP PROGRAMME
AND UH IN THIS IN THIS THE BEGIN AND END THE NUMBER IS THE FOR EXAMPLE THE END IS ZERO DOT TWELVE TWELVE IS UH THIS FRAME TOO YEAH
UH
UH I WAS JUST UM LET'S TALK ABOUT LITTLE ABOUT THIS PRESENTATION ITSELF THE SLIDE NUMBER SIX
IS IT NOT A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU'RE HAVING LESS CONTEXT
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A FACT THAT WHEN YOU ARE HAVING ONE UTTERANCE
SO IT ONE UTTERANCES LINK UP FULL SENTENCE OR SOMETHING AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE MUCH BREAKS IN IT
SO IN THAT SENSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT YOU ARE GOING TOO MUCH IN THE PAST AND THEN YOU ARE TRYING TO COMPUTE SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT RELATED
KIND OF LET'S SAY IDEA IS USUALLY HUNDRED MILLISECONDS OR ONE SECOND
THAT M THAT MATCH OF CONTEXT TO COMPUTER COMMAS
I DON'T HAVE THE C. FILES ALSO PRESENTLY WITH ME
YEAH AND THEN I THEN I WOULD HAVE TAKEN TWO YEARS EXTENSION
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE FILES THE REAL THE REAL S ONES
YEAH P. L. P. NUMBERS NINETY FIVE DATABASE IS THERE FINE
AND UH IF IF YOU REALLY ASK ME EVEN THE STRUCTURE WHICH WAS THERE REAL EVERY POINT BY POINT HOW P. L. P. IS WELL GENERATED
HOPEFULLY NINETY FIVE PERCENT I KNOW BUT THAT FIVE PERCENT
AND THEN WE WE NEED TO TRAIN THE NEW RATES BECAUSE M. L. P. TRAINING NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THEN ONLY THE NEXT STEP WILL HAPPEN
SO IT'S IT'S PRETTY PRETTY HOL HOLDING IS STUPID
NO NO THOSE THINGS I'M ALSO HAVING BECAUSE THEY WERE DONE TWO YEARS BACK
THE THERE'S ALSO IN COM COM DATABASE YEAH
NO TH THOSE THINGS ARE NOT DISTURBED
MEANS AT L YEAH THAT PART IS LESS UH SCARY
SO YOU THA M. L. P. NEEDS TO BE TRAINED AND UH P. L. P. FEATURES
AND IF I DON'T HAVE TO GENERATE ANY NEW RESULTS I'M ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE THEN
MEANS LOSSES ARE EMOTIONAL AS WELL AS WHATEVER IT IS THERE
BUT IT STILL MEANS ONE THING WHICH IS A MYSTERY TO ME WHE WHY TEMP ONE AND TEMP TWO WERE RESIDING ON THE SAME HARD DISK PHYSICAL
I CHECKED OVER THE NET IT'S NOT THE WAY
YOU D YOU SEND THE THINGS TO THEM THEY WILL SEE IF THEY CAN RECOVER
THE THEY WON'T GO WE HO WITHOUT THAT
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING WHAT THEY SAY THAT SEND US THE THING WE'LL LOOK AT THE THINGS
BUT MEANS F AND UH I IF THEY THEY CANNOT RECOVER IT THEN THEN WHAT THEY WILL THEY WON'T CHARGE ANYTHING FROM YOU FOR THE INSPECTION
SO HOW MUCH IS FOUR TERA FOUR THOUSAND GIGABYTES
IS IT RAID ONE HAS MORE COMPARED TO RAID FIVE
AND THERE IS NO KIND OF OR ANYTHING NOTHING EXISTS THERE
MEANS IF BOTH THE DISK HAVE CRASHED FOR THE SAME DATA YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANYTHING
TO WHAT ARE THE EXPERIMENTS YOU NEED TO DO
AH OKAY
THIS IS RELATED TO YOUR UM M. L. M. I.
AH OKAY MM-HMM
AH OKAY
BUT THOSE GAMMAS WILL BE SAME AS UH S NORMALISED SCALE LIKELIHOODS RIGHT
G. M. M. OH M. L. P. SCALE LIKELIHOODS
AH OKAY
THAT'S ALL BE BECAUSE OF YOU
YOU CAME ON WRONG DAY FROM IRAN
THE DATA ON WHICH WE WANT TO RUN THE SCRIPTS IS NOT THERE
I N I DON'T NEED ALL MY P. FILES JUST THREE OF THEM
AH
THEY WON'T KEEP IT AT ONE PLACE YEAH
C. D. S ARE NOT ENOUGH THAT'S THE PROBLEM
BECAUSE ONE C. D. IS HOW MUCH
IT'S NOT EVEN ONE G. B.
SO THEN C. D. S ARE NOT ENOUGH
NO NO HE WA HE WAS HAVING LOCKED MANY THINGS IN THE PROPER PLACES
UH LOOK WHAT
OKAY THAT WAY IT MIGHT BE BUT THE SITUATION IS THAT UH HE HE WAS GENERATING HIS OWN P. L. P. FEATURES FROM HIS OWN SCRIPTS
SO HE WAS LIKE UH HE WAS SO I'D BORROWED FEW OF THE THINGS FROM HIM
I I KEPT THE BACKUPS BUT THOSE BACKUPS ARE THE THEM'S ALSO ON TEMP
BECAUSE JUST FEW FEW DAYS BACK I TOOK A BACKUP OF MY LAPTOP FEARING THE SAME THING
P. L. P. IS HARDLY ANYTHING YEAH
AH
THEY DIDN'T WRITE IT WITH PEN OR SOMETHING ON A PAPER OR SAYING THAT OKAY THIS IS THE BEST OPTIMISATION
YEAH YOU CAN GO BACK UP TO THE FEATURE YOU KNOW
YEAH YOU CAN THEN YOU KNOW BECAUSE IF MOST DID IT ON WHAT NUMBERS AND ONE OF COUPLE OF C. T. F. EXPERIMENTS RIGHT
UH
NO EVERYTHING WE W IF TH IF THEY SAY THAT WE CANNOT RECOVER IT THEN I CAN QUICKLY GET IT BACK FROM ICSI IN A COUPLE OF DAYS
YEAH A LOT OF TIME NO IT I CAN DOW OBVIOUSLY DOWNLOADING IS ANOTHER THING
THE ONLY THING IS THAT I HAVE TO DO IS THAT THEY HAVE UH DATA IN UH ONE PARTICULAR STRUCTURE
YEAH THAT I CAN GET ALL THOSE THINGS
ALL TH ALL THOSE M YEAH
YEAH BUT THE THOSE FILES CAN BE RECOVERED EASILY ONLY THING IS THAT UH NOW IF THEY HAD TO SAY THAT WE CANNOT RECOVER IT
UH UH ONE UH ONE UH DAY ONE O ONE TWO DAYS LIKE THIS WEEK I CAN WAIT AND SEE
IF THEY CANNOT RECOVER IT THEN I CAN JUST GET ALL THE DATA FROM ICSI AND PUT BACK THE C. T. S. SYSTEM
ONE ONE
NO NO BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE DOWN IN THE DATABASE SECTION
YEAH EXCEPT SWITCHBOARD BUT THE SWITCHBOARD ALSO WE HAVE IT BUT ONLY THING IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE DATA WE NEED YEAH
NO NO IT IS EVEN IN D. V. D. FORM WE HAVE IT THAT THE
THEY ARE THEY'RE IT'S IT'S IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOU GET THREE DISK GONE
THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET IT WELL LIKE FINE IF IT'S ONE DISK IT'S FINE BECAUSE AT LEAST ONE IS HAVING THE UH MIRROR MIRROR
UM BUT UH IF THE THREE DISK ARE GONE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
MAYB YEAH OTHERWISE IT UH IT'LL GO ON DESTROYING OTHER DISKS
SO I SO THE ONE SO THEY I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPEN YOU KNOW SUCH A THING LIKE USUALLY AS SOON AS ONE FAILS
IT ACTUALLY NOTIFIES THE YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR OR MAKES CERTAIN KIND OF UM NOISE
UH YEAH TO TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW IT HAS TO BE REPLACED
SO W UH IF IT THE DISK IS NOT REPLACED THEN IT W IT'LL FAIL
IT UH THEN THEN IT UH THERE'S A INTERNAL RECOVERY IF IT JUST R REPLACE THE DISK THERE
THEN IT ESSENTIALLY WILL HAVE A HUN TWO HUNDRED G. B. ONLY STU VISIBLE DATA F TO YOU
BUT THEN IT CAN WE AS SOON AS THEY REPLACE ONE OF THOSE HARD DISK I IT CAN IT CAN FROM THE OTHER ONE IT CAN RECOVER EVERYTHING ON THAT
INTER INTERNALLY IT CAN DO THAT KIND OF THING BUT IF THE TH IF THE THREE DISKS FAIL
PROBABLY THE MM ONE WAY THAT THEY EXTEND THE HAR THE HARD DISK TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS
UH TH SIMPLE YES THE SIMPLE THING MIGHT COST YOU MINIMUM TEN THOUSAND EUROS FIFTEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
NO IT DOES BECAUSE IT WAS NOT TEMP ONE TEMP TWO BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME MM IT HAS THREE G. B. THREE DISKS HARD DISK CATEGORY
AND SO YOU CAN GO UP TO FOURTEEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT CAN BE ON THE SAME YEAH
BUT SO IT TRIES TO PUT IF YOU IT TRIES TO UH QUICKLY PUT THINGS UH IF THIS WAY THAT SO THAT AND BUT ONLY THING THAT ONLY ONE HAS THE MM UM BACKUP
BUT THEN WHAT ARE THE USE OF RAID THEN
NO BUT THAT IS WHAT THE RAID CAN ALLOW YOU TO HAVE KEEP UP TO FOURTEEN HARD DISK
AND IT CAN STILL WORK AND IT TAKES THE AND THE WAY IT LOOK LIKE IT IT'S STILL TOLERANT YOU KNOW
THE WAY IT IT USUALLY IT DOES IT IF YOU ONE THIS CRASHES BEFORE UH I UH UM IF IT UH REPLACE QUICKLY THEN NO PROBLEMS
BECAUSE TH TH SOME SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THAT EXPERT THERE ARE COUPLE OF EXPERTS SO THEY LEARNED ITSELF
IF THEY CAN EASILY RECOVER IT WELL
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE SMALL HARDWARE THING THEY MIGHT DO IT TO THEN YOU KNOW FIVE THOUSAND EUROS AND ALL
THEY WILL JUST I IT THE SYSTEM THE THE WHOLE THING STARTS LIKE THIS THAT YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND SIGN A FORM AND THEN ONLY THEY WILL START TOUCHING YOUR HARD DISK
NO NO BU NO TH THEY WILL
NO NO THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY LIKE YOU DO IT THEN SEND IT THE HARD DISK THEN THEY WILL SAY OKAY WE CAN DO IT
THEY CAN GO BLOCK BY BLOCK AND LOOK INTO IT AND TRY TO RECOVER BUT UM THAT MATTHEW WILL WANT TO GO OR NOT IS THE QUESTION
YOU DID IT ON ONLY ONE
HE USE THE TRIPHONE M. L. P. AND GET UH
UH YEAH SCALE LIKE UH SCALE LIKELIHOO FROM UH T UH M. L. P.
YEAH WELL YEAH SO I J I D DO I DID TRY IT YEAH TH THAT'S HOW YOU DO THAT
AT LEAST THEY COULD GIVE US TIME TO I THINK THAT UH THE MOST OF THOSE THINGS SHOULD BE THERE
SO DANIEL IS WELL IN ITALY
OH THAT IS FIRE WILL LOSE ALL THE DATA YOU KNOW
THEY MAY NOT HAVE IT IN ONE PLACE
FOR EXAMPLE F PHONEBOOK I CAN RECOVER EVERYTHING ON PHONEBOOK BECAUSE I HAVE IT ON THE C. D.
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I HAD I COPIED ALL THE NUMBERS THAT ARE ON THAT SO
BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE KEPT THOSE LABELS ALL THOSE THINGS IN THE SPEECH DIRECTORY
SO IT'S EASIER TO IT ALL BACK ALL THOSE LABELS AND EVERYTHING YEAH
I RE SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE P. L. P. ALSO SOMEWHERE THA
N MM THE THE EXTRA WORK ON IS LIKE YOU KNOW CONVERTING THE SEGMENTATIONS FROM MONOPHONE TO TRIPHONE THIS KIND OF THING
NO WHAT YOU DO IS LIKE YOU HAVE THE SEGMENTATION TO TRAIN THAT FOR MONOPHONES RIGHT
YOU SAY THE POINT THAT IF YOU LOSE ONE UH SO UH SO THE THING IS THAT I HAVE TO RECOVER MEANS I HAVE TO RECOVER THROUGH THE PHO NO MONOPHONE SEGMENT SEGMENTATION TO TRIPHONE SEGMENTATION
TH THAT UH NUMBERS IT'S VERY FAST SO IT'S NO PROBLEM
HO LET'S HOPE THE BEST
UH YEAH
SO I THINK IT'S BETTER TO FIRST HAVE A PRESENTATION OF MY WORK AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS UH WITH THIS CRASH IN TEMP IN TEMP UH WHAT WE CAN DO UH FOR MY FUTURE TO TO CONTINUE MY RESEARCH
SO IN THIS HIERARCHICAL ARG ARCHITECTURE I WILL BE ABLE TO UH INTEGRATE THE EXTRA KNOWLEDGE AT THE PROPER LEVEL OF HIERARCHY
THEN WE USE THESE PHONE POSTERIORS AS FEATURES OR AS SCORES FOR FOR EITHER JUST DECODING OR D UH UH N D TRAINING AND INFERENCE TRAINING AND THEN DECODING
AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO INTEGRATE THE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE WE CAN HAVE ABOUT PHONE USE OR ABOUT
UH WORDS IN THE POSTERIOR ESTIMATION SO THE MAIN MOTIVATION IS TO SEE IF WE CAN INTEGRATE THIS KIND OF EXTRA KNOWLEDGE IN THE POSTERIOR ESTIMATION
SO WHAT IS PROPOSED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS TO USE A UH WHAT WE FORMALLY USE IN H. M. M. FORMALISM WHICH IS CALLED GAMMA UH STATE POSTERIOR
WHICH IS DEFINED AS THE PROBABILITY OF BEING IN A SPECIFIC H. M. M. STATE AT A SPECIFIC TIME HAVING THE WHOLE OBSERVATION SEQUENCE AND THE MODEL
AND ACTUALLY ONE WAY TO USE THIS UH GAMMA POSTERIORS IS UH USING THESE POSTERIORS AS SOME KIND OF NEWER SCORES FOR DECODING
SO IN THIS CASE IT WILL BE UH SIMILAR TO HYBRID METHOD
WE GET BETTER EVIDENCES THAN WHAT I WE INITIALLY HAD HERE
AND THEN WE DO THE UH DECODING AND THE AND S MORE INFORMATIVE POSTERIORS UH UH INSTEAD OF THIS ONE
HERE YOU SEE UH SOME RESULTS UH AND HOW UH HOW WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF INTRODUCING UH REASONABLE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
POSSIBLE TRANSITION BETWEEN PHONEMES AND SOME KIND SOME UH MORE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE LIKE UH WHICH WO LIKE UH WHICH WORD IS COMPOSED OF WHICH PHONEMES AND UH G UH GRAM GRAMMATICAL KNOWLEDGE AB UH ABOUT TRANSITION BETWEEN WORDS AND THINGS LIKE THIS
SO AS YOU SEE INTRODUCING MORE REASONABLE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE UM WILL H HELP TO HAVE BETTER PERFORMANCE IN ALMO IN ALMOST ALL THE CASES
WHICH IS BASED ON UH DOING DECODING UH USING UH LIKELIHOOD AS THE SCORES
AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT OUR SYSTEM USE UH IS USING POSTERIORS FOR DECODING
SO AS YOU SEE S UH IT'S WORKING UH BETTER THAN THE STANDARD H. M. M. G. M. M. SYSTEM
AND FINALLY THE CONCLUSION IS UH HE HERE WE SAW HOW WE CAN GET UH SOME MORE INFORMATIVE POSTERIORS BY INTRODUCING EXTRA KNOWLEDGE LIKE PRIOR AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION
SO IF YOU WANT NOW WE CAN DISCUSS ABOUT UM UH THE CRASH AND THE LOSS OF DATA
I CANNOT UH STOP MY RESEA I I MAY DO SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW IN FUTURE WITH THIS UH AND WELL I NEED POSTERIORS TO
UH NO NO I DON'T HAVE THEM THERE WERE ALL UNDER TEMP
YOU YOU WE HAVE THAT BECAUSE YOU UH STORED THEM
MAYBE MAYBE SOME OTHER M UH P. H. D. STUDENT SHOULD BE HIRED TO WORK ON YOU KNOW THE GENERATING GAMMA
UH
AH OKAY YOU DO YOU HAVE JUST YOUR NO
N YEAH I UH FOR C. T. S. PETR UH STILL I THINK HAVE HE DIDN'T UH LOSE ANYTHING SO
AH
MM JUST UH PO UH PI UH POSTERIOR ESTIMATED USING P. L. P. FEATURES FOR NUMBER WHICH I THINK WE CAN WE CAN RATE IT
UH P. L. P. THEY'RE ALSO LAST
I I THINK I CAN REMEMBER ALMOST ALL OF THEM BUT F IT'S IT'S A BIT UH UH STRESSFUL
YEAH BUT H HE DOESN'T
UH Y M YES
YEAH SO SO AS THE CONCLUSION THERE IS NO MAJOR PROBLEM EXCEPT REGENERA YEAH WHICH TIME FOR I GUESS
T
AH
WELL I I THINK W AFTER THIS MEETING WE CAN T WE CAN TRY TOGETHER TO REGENERATE THIS
UH MAINLY TH THERE WOULD BE SOME EXPERIMENT TO CHECK HOW THE SYSTEM IS ROBUST AGAINST THESE UH TUNING FACTORS LIKE UH LANGUAGE MOD UH LANGUAGE MODELLING
NO IN THESE CASES BUT
BECAUSE I T UH I TALKED WITH HERVE AND HE SAID OKAY
UH SO I ANYWAY I HAD TO RE TO REDO ALL THE EXPERIMENTS BUT NOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT
OH M I WANTED I WANTED TO EXTEND THIS UH WELL ACTUALLY THE PAPER WE WANTED TO WRITE WAS UH FOR ICAS WAS SOMETHING RELATED TO MULTI STREAM GAMMA
UH WILL I I WILL EXPLAIN
SO THA MY PLAN WAS TO HAVE TWO STREAMS AND I I I WELL
I SO I I THOUGHT THAT OKAY I ONE STREAM WILL BE P. L. P. AND THE OTHER WILL BE DELTA P. L. P. S
SO THIS WAS ONE PART OF EXPERIMENT SO SINGLE STREAM AND THEN I WANTED TO COMBINE DELTAS WITH THIS AND HAVE ANOTHER TABLE SO THAT WAS WHY
BUT JUST TO MAKE THINGS CLEAR IN THE PRESENTATION TO SHOW MORE STEPS
TH
AND WHAT IF WE HAVE SOME DAY A FIRE IN IDIAP WE WILL LOSE ALL THE DATA
MM I MEAN BUT THEY HAVE WELL I I THINK W THEY CAN AND YEAH THEY CAN D YOU KNOW STORE IT SOMEWHERE
BUT YOU KNOW HERE WE CAN EASILY HAVE A FIRE BECAUSE THE EVERYTHING IS MADE OF WOOD I THINK AND IT'S SMALL AND
THANK YOU THANK YOU
YOU TOO
UH YOU GO TO THE TABLE YOU HAVE THERE LIKE THE BIG TABLE YOU TOLD AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS
EVEN YOU HAVE THOSE THREE STATE PERFORM GAMMAS ALSO YOU HAVE ALL THESE
AH OKAY
LIKE IF IT'S REALLY LONG SENTENCE OF TEN SECONDS OR SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT REALLY NEED SO MUCH CON
I KNOW IT'S REALLY COMPUTATIONALLY VERY INTENSIVE ALSO LIKE IF YOU USE
SO PRETTY MUCH ALL THE POSTERIORS ARE FROM YOU ONLY
SK
OH YOU KNOW
BUT AL FOR YOUR CASE YOU DON'T NEED REALLY COMPLICATED POSTERIOR YOU JUST NEED SOME P. L. P. S AND THEN
NO BUT BUT MA HE'S HE MAY BE LINKING TO MATTHEW I GUESS BECAUSE MATTHEW GOT THE WAV FILES
BUT YOU GOT THE ALL THE WAV FILES SO
UH YEAH
BUT YOU SAY DO YOU NEED TO DO SOME SEGMENTATION ALSO ON TOP OF THAT SO
SO IN NUMBERS CASE WHAT DO YOU REALLY NEED LIKE
YEAH BASICALLY YEAH W WE NEED TO GENERATE AGAIN P. L. P. S BUT WAVE FILES ARE THERE
BUT AT LEAST YOU F
SO SO P. L. P. S OR THESE ARE ALL THIRTEEN JUST ONLY P. L. P. S NOT DELTAS AND DEL
BUT IF YOU GOT SOMETHING FROM HEMANT OR MATTHEW THEN I HAVE THOSE NUMBER OF STAGE
AH
I THINK SO YEAH SO THEN I HAVE THOSE NUMBER OF STAGES
AH OKAY
AH
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY P. FOR THESE P. L. P. S NO P. L. P. S OR P. FILES FROM P. L. P.
SO WE HAVE DIRECTLY F WAVE FILES WITH UH PARTICULAR NOISE
AH OK SEE
NO BUT BUT I THINK UH DE
BUT THE PROBLEM IS LIKE ALL THIS I THINK IT MAY NOT BE THERE IN DATABASE I GUESS
AH OKAY
AH OKAY THEN IT'S OKAY
AH
SO Y YOU IT'S NOT THAT YOU ALL THE NO
YEAH SO AT LEAST WE HAVE WAVE FILES SO NOW WE CAN GENERATE ANYTHING IN THE P. L. P. S OR SO AT LEAST
THOSE
NO THE THING IS LIKE YOU CAN'T REALLY WRITE THIS K I SUPPOSE UH THE CODE IS THE REAL PROBLEM SCRIPTS IS OKAY LIKE YEAH
EVEN SCRIPTS ALSO THE CONFIGURATIONS OR YOU DO IF YOU FORGET SOMETHING SOME FACTOR OR SOMETHING IT'S REALLY
IT WILL RI
UH
BUT UH WE WE
YEAH NO TEMP
BUT IS IT REALLY COSTLY THE SYSTEM IS
IT L IT LEVELS
UH AH OKAY
BUT RAID FIVE IS THEN THEN TWENTY PERCENT COPY ONLY
AH
MM THIS IS NOT IN THE PAPER ACTUALLY D
AT LEAST NOW HE CAN KNOW A FULL SYSTEM SETUP FROM
NOT SURE BUT THEN WHY DID THIS FEATURES YOU GAVE ME LIKE THEY'RE THIRTEEN
YOU TRUNCATED THEM TO
NO NO NO NO THESE THESE THESE ONES LIKE THE
AH OKAY
AH
AH OKAY
AH OKAY
YEAH THOSE RESULTS ONLY YOU REPORTED IN INTERSPEECH NO LIKE UH THIRTY NINE P. L. P. RESULTS
UH
UH N NO HE GAVE SCALE TO ME THEN I GENERATED GAMMAS
THE THEY'RE DIFFERENTLY
SO HE GAVE ME SCALE LIKELIHOODS OF TRIPHONES
NO IT WAS THERE ON UH LIKE UH YESTERDAY MORNING ALSO LIKE EVEN
YEAH SO BUT WE DON'T KNOW LIKE WE THOUGHT LIKE I THOUGHT IT'S RECOVERING SO MAYBE BY TOMORROW I'LL GET EVERYTHING SO
BECAUSE LIKE WE WE S HOW MUCH WE CAN COPY BECAUSE IT'S REALLY SO MANY ITERATIONS AND EVEN WE THOUGHT OF REALLY COMPLETING MINIMAL EXPERIMENT ALSO MM
BUT AT LEAST YEAH A SCRIPT ARE THERE EVERY SCRIPTS LIKE AT LEAST SCRIPTS ARE THERE BUT SO IF IF THEY CAN DECODE
YEAH YEAH YOU J JUST ONLY LIKE RECENT P. FILES AT LEAST
BUT THEY HAVE LIKE THREE BACKUPS IN THE UNIVERSITY SO ALL THESE PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T REALLY AFFECT MUCH
NO IT'S THE UNIVERSITY IS MAYBE IT'S REALLY BIG SO THEY CAN AFFORD FOR
NO C. D. S ARE NOT ENOUGH LIKE NO
BUT WHAT ABOUT HOME DIRECTORIES OR HE ALSO KEPT EVERYTHING IN UH TEMP
BUT HE HE DID MOSTLY ON NUMBERS NO
IT IS HOME OR HOME SPEECH OR SOMETHING
LOOK FOR ANY FEATURES OR ANYTHING ARE THERE
NO NO HE HE MAYBE HE MIGHT BE USING SAME P. L. P. FEATURES OR SOMETHING IT THEY ARE DIFFERENT
AH OKAY IS HERE HE GOT UH HIS OWN
UH
OH THEN IT'S GOOD YOU KNOW LIKE WE DON'T REALLY NEE
THEN WE JUST NEED TO RUN YOUR NEURAL NET ONLY YEAH BUT P. P. P. L. P. S ARE LIKE HARDLY FEW MINUTES LI
BUT BUT YOU STILL NEED TO RUN ALL THE NETS NO L
HE
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF HE WANT REPEATED ALL THESE RESULTS THEN HE JU HE NEED TO USE ALL MA HEMANT'S P. L. P. CONFIGURATION THEN THAT'S REALLY
YEAH FOR THIRTY FIVE FORTY MINUTES IT IS
UH UH THANK YOU
WITH THE LINK HERE IN
YOU YOU HAVE TWO REPRESENTATION ONE WHICH COMES FROM THIS LINK UH STUFF AND ONE F THIS ONE IS NOT BASED ON P. L. S. A. TOO
Y
A T. YEAH UH OKAY
AH UH OKAY
OR THEY USE THE PERPLEXITY ON THE THE LIKELIHOOD TO SAY OH GOOD THIS LIKELIHOOD IS UH IS IT'S SMALLER THAN THE OTHER
I IT'S MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT UH THIS HUMAN CATEGORISATION IS RELATED TO THE ONE THAT IS DISCOVERED UH MM
BUT I HAVE THE FEELING I IN
BUT IN THIS CASE YOU YOU HAVE TO USE UH THE LABEL ONE YEAH
YOUR LOS
I I YOU HAVE TO TRAIN YOUR UH
NO BUT W
THE THE THERE IS NOT UH V UH PERFECT UH CLUSTERING CLUS WH WHAT IS THE HOW DO YOU JUDGE UH WHAT IS A GOOD CLUSTERING
AH OKAY OKAY
YOU M YOU STILL NOT COMBI
IN FACT I I HAVE SEEN A PAPER IN I. C. M. L. WHERE THE GUY WAS TRYING TO LEARN WHICH WORD HE UM ASPECTS OF CLUSTERING
AND THEY HAVE TO DIVIDE IT IN FIVE GROUP AND IN THE END IT'S NOT AL IT'S IT'S ALWAYS DIFFERENT TO THE CLUSTERING EACH PEOPLE HAS
BUT IN BUT THERE IS UH SOME CHARACTERISTIC THAT ARE FOR TRANSPARENCY COLOUR
WHAT YOU MEAN THEN DON'T DON'T USE A GOOGLE PAGE BECAUSE IT'S UH TOO UH S ROOT BUT UH ANOTHER PAGE MM
OH IT'S NOT THAT
UM THIS ALPHA I CAN IT BE DEPENDENT OF THE OF THE DOCUMENT
AND HOW MANY TEXT IS IN IT
OH OF COURSE
AH OKAY
IN TWO MONTHS YEAH
YOU NEVER KNOW WHETHER YOU'VE GOT THESE THINGS ON RIGHT OR NOT
YOU NEVER KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE ON RIGHT OR NOT
SO DAVID CAME IN TO ME AND TO SAY UH I SOMETHING WE'D BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A WHILE WAS SOME STUFF I'D BEEN WORKING ON ABOUT USING THESE TOPIC MODELS WITH UH WITH NETWORKS
WITH N THINGS WITH LINKS BETWEEN THEM DOCUMENTS THAT ARE LINKED
UH N UH IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S RELATED TO RAPPLE
BUT UH TH AT THE TIME BASICALLY I'D BEEN TRYING TO USE P. L. S. A. AND THOSE TYPES OF MODELS ON WEB PAGES
BUT YOU CAN TELL WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT BASED ON THE OTHER TEXTS ON THE SITE
THE TEXTS ON THE THINGS THEY'RE LINKED TO SO WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW WAS CAN YOU COMBINE THE TOPIC MODELS THAT THE PAGES
WITH SOMETHING ELSE THAT THAT TELLS YOU WHAT A PAGE THAT HAS NO OR VERY LITTLE TEXT ON IT BASED ON THE LINKS YEAH
SO QUITE SIMPLY IF YOU HAVE A PAGE ONE WHICH IS LIKE A HOME PAGE
THEY SAY IF THIS PAGE IS GOOD IN SOME WAY AND IT LINKS TO THIS OTHER PAGE
SO I WANTED TO COMBINE THE TOPIC MODELS THAT TELL YOU BEFOREHAND WHAT YOU THINK THIS PAGE AND THIS PAGE ARE ABOUT WITH THIS TO MAYBE GET A BETTER IDEA
THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE PICTURE ABOUT WHAT OF WHAT THE PAGE IS REALLY ABOUT AND THE LINKS POINTING TO THAT PAGE ARE ALSO PART OF THE PICTURE
SO I BASICALLY CAME UP WITH AN ALGORITHM THAT'S JUST A I IT PLUGS P. L. S. A. UH PLUGS PAGE RANK INTO P. L. S. A.
RIGHT SO PAGE RANK YOU BASICALLY JUST D UH SAY
UH SUM OVER ALL THE LINKS INTO Z. OF PAGE RANK
YEAH THA IT'S LIKE THAT YEAH
UH IS EQUAL TO AND YOU CAN USE THE SAME SORT OF THING
I YEAH PLUS THAT AND THEN YOU NORMALISE BETWEEN THEM SO YOU SAY ALPHA AND ONE MINUS ALPHA
SO W BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE ONE MINUS ALPHA SAY LINK CONTRIBUTION YOU CAN CALL THIS I GUESS
SO WHAT I DID THEN WAS TRY THIS ON A BIG DATABASE OF WEB PAGES
UH AND I HAD SOME RESULTS FROM THAT BUT THEY WERE ALL ON TEMP TWO SO THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW
UH BUT AS IT IS NOT REALLY IMPORTANT I CAN REGENERATE THAT
SO YOU'VE GOT TWO VECTORS YOU'VE GOT THE ONE THAT YOU'VE JUST GOT FROM P. L. S. A. OR WHATEVER MODEL AND YOU'VE GOT THE ONE THAT YOU GET FROM THIS
I HAD NO WAY TO EVALUATE THIS WELL
WELL YEAH WHAT YOU DO IS YOU'RE TAKING THIS AND ITERATING OVER IT THE PROBABILITY OF THE TOPIC GIVEN THE DOCUMENT
UH SO HAVE I MADE THAT CLEAR I'M I'M NOT SURE IF I'M EXPLAINING THIS WELL
RIGHT SO Y I YOU M
BECAUSE UH I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THAT P. L. S. A. AND ALL THOSE KIND OF MODELS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED
THEY ALWAYS SAY UH WELL LOOK AT THE CLUSTERING THERE'S HERE WE'VE GOT SOME DOCUMENTS THAT ALL APPEAR TO BE ABOUT THE SAME THING
AND HERE'S WHERE WE GET SOME OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT ALL APPEAR TO BE ABOUT THE SAME THING
AND YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL EXACTLY HOW GOOD THAT IS YOU CAN JUST GET AN IDEA THAT IT'S
YEAH SO THA THAT'S THE FIRST THING TH THAT THING WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT THIS
YOU HAVE THE UH OH LET ME THING OF WHAT THIS WAS
CARS AND YOU CAN TELL THAT THAT'S REPRESENTING CARS BY LOOKING AT THIS DISTRIBUTION AND IT'S THE SAME FOR BOTH
AND THAT UH NO F I CAN'T I JUST REMEMBER IT WAS A REALLY CAN YOU IG REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
IS THAT FAIR THOUGH BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WITH THESE TOPIC MODELS IS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW YOU CAN'T MAKE THEM CLUSTER
CAN YOU SAY THAT IF A SET OF DOCUMENTS IF THE CLUSTERING OF THESE DOCUMENTS IS CLOSER TO THE EFFECTI WHAT YOU WHAT YOU'VE GOT THERE IS UH A CLUSTERING OF DOCUMENTS A AS YOUR DEVALUATION
UH THI THIS THESE LABELS THE YAHOO CATEGORIES THAT'S THAT'S A CLUSTERING
MM KAY
WE UH I THINK YOUR POINT WAS THAT YOU YOU TRAIN THIS WITHOUT LABELLING FIRST YEAH
THE THE THING THAT WORRIES ME ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT SAY THE REALLY REALLY REALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF THIS WHERE YOUR DIRECTORY HAD TWO CATEGORIES IN IT
UH GOOD AND BAD
BUT BUT WHAT I WANNA KNOW I IS THAT WHICH OF THEM HAS THE BETTER REPRESENTATION OF A GIVEN PAGE
SO SO GIVEN A RANDOM PAGE UH AND THESE TWO MODELS UH AND THE WO THE WORDS THAT THESE TWO MODELS GIVE WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO
S OKAY
WELL THAT MAYBE NOT IS THE SAME WAY I WAS THINKING
UH
BUT IT IT'S IT YOU YOU COULD SAY THAT IT POSSIBLY DOE IT PROBABLY DOES
UH NO I TH I'M I'M COMING ROUND TO IT ACTUALLY
UH I I TH I THINK IT PROBABLY IS FAIR I'M JUST I I'VE GOTTEN UM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT
BUT I THINK THAT'LL GO IF I THINK ABOUT IT ENOUGH
BUT I THINK THAT'S JUST FROM THE WHOLE POINT THAT YOU CAN'T TELL WHICH CLUSTERING IS B BETTER
UH NOW YOU GIVE PEOPLE FIVE SHEETS UH YOU GIVE UH A T A A USER FIVE SHEETS OF PAPER EACH WITH
AND THEN YOU GET LIKE AN INTUITIVE IDE UH LIKE HOW WOULD A PERSON CLUSTER PAGES GIVEN THE WHAT THESE TOPICS SUPPOSEDLY ARE
SO I WAS TR I WAS HOPING YOU COULD USE THAT TO
SEE
THE THE THING ABOUT WEB PAGES I THOUGHT AS WELL IN THAT GETTING HUMANS TO EVALUATE IT IN SOME WAY IS THAT YOU HAVE MOST OF THE WEB PAGES THAT ARE UH WELL A LOT OF THE WEB PAGES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN SOME WAY ARE ARE ARE HOME PAGES
I MAYBE IT SAYS GO BUT YOU ONLY KNOW IT'S ABOUT SEARCH THROUGH THE THING BUT SOMEONE LOOKING AT IT CAN TELL THAT IT'S A SEARCH ENGINE
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW BUT UH YEAH
BUT IT YEAH THI THIS IS EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE HAVE HERE THOUGH AND TH THAT DIRECTORY IS ONE CLUSTERING OF THE MARBLES
AND YOU'RE HOPING THAT IT IT SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT I HAVE TWO CLUSTERINGS OF MARBLES FOR MY TWO MODELS
IT'S SAYING THAT ONE OF THESE IS MORE CLOSE TO THE TEST T T TO THE THE ONE THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN
IS THAT IT'S SAYING THAT WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY SAY
WHAT WHAT THE ALGORITHMS ARE STILL COMING UP WITH IS IN THIS WAY YOU'RE LOOKING AT A CLUSTERING OF MARBLES YEAH
IF EACH OF THE ALGORITHMS COMES UP WITH A DEFIN
AH OKAY RIGHT THAT MAKES SENSE
UH ALRIGHT WELL THANKS
UM I'M TRYING TO THINK OF ANYTHING I HAVEN'T SAID ABOUT THE STUFF BUT THAT UH FROM LOOKING AT THE RESULTS I GOT IT LOOKED QUITE GOOD
SO WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THE PAGES AROUND IDIAP THERE'S A LOT OF ENGLISH PA SPEAKING PAGES AND A LOT OF FRENCH SPEAKING PAGES
SO OF COURSE THIS UH P. L. S. A. COMPLETELY SEPARATED THOSE OUT INTO INTO CATEGORIES
ONE WAS VERY CLEARLY ENGLISH WORDS THAT MOST LIKELY WORD WAS THE AND ONE WAS VERY CLEARLY FRENCH WORDS MOST LIKELY WORDS WAS DE I THINK AND UH
BUT ANYWAY UH THA THAT'S OFTEN THE CASE
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT YOU CAN TELL VERY CLEARLY THAT ONE OR TWO TOPICS ARE A B NOT THE REST YEAH
THAT W UH ANYWAY THAT WHEN I RUN IT ON THAT UH WHAT I FOUND WAS
THAT WHERE ONE SAID IT WAS PROBABLY AN ENGLISH PHRASE AND THE OTHER SAID IT WAS PROBABLY A FRENCH PHRASE
AND I FOUND A GOOD FEW EXAMPLES WHERE YOU HAD A SITE THAT LOOKED UH WELL ONE THAT I REMEMBER OFF HAND WAS IT WAS A PAGE AND IT WAS A BIG PICTURE
SO YOU COULDN'T THE THE WORDS WERE IN FRENCH AND THE LINKS BUT THERE WERE NO WORDS PICKED UP BY THE WHEN I DID THE CRAWL FOR THE MODEL
BUT IT DIDN'T LOAD UH OR UH B IT WAS MEANT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE
AND IT SAID UH IN ENGLISH IT SAID FOUR O. FOUR THIS PAGE CANNOT BE FOUND
SO ALL THE WORDS ON THIS PAGE WERE ENGLISH BUT IT WAS VERY VERY CLEARLY A FRENCH PAGE
SO THE FIRST MODEL SAID IT WAS AN ENGLISH PAGE 'CAUSE ALL THE WORDS WERE IN ENGLISH
SECOND MODEL SAID VERY DEFINITELY A FRENCH PAGE BECAUSE ALL OF THESE POINTED TO FRENCH SITES AND IT WAS ONLY POINTED TO IT WAS SOMETHING DOT F. R. AS WELL
SO I I FOUND A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THAT WERE KINDA LIKE THAT
MM BUT THE THE PROBLEM THAT I FOUND WHEN I RAN IT
UH THE TH THE THING THAT WAS A BAD POINT WAS THAT IF YOU HAVE UH SAY TRYIN I WAS TRYING TO SAY IF YOU COULD EVALUATE THIS WITH SEARCH GIVEN SOME KEYWORDS LIKE WHICH MODEL WOULD MORE LIKELY FIND YOU A P GOOD DOCUMENT
UH TH THA THAT'S NOT TOO RELEVANT NECESSARILY BUT IF YOU HAVE SAY A TOPIC DISTRIBUTION FOR UH ONE PAGE
AND IT VERY VERY HIGHLY SCORES ON THE P. L. S. A. FOR ONE OF THE THE TOPICS
AND THAT'S RIGHT OKAY THIS MODEL BECAUSE IT'S AVERAGING OUT OVER ALL THE PAGES NEARBY ALL OF THE TOPIC DISTRIBUTIONS BECOME MORE FLAT
EVERY PAGE IS LINKED EVENTUALLY TO EVERYTHING ELSE SO IT EVERY PAGE HAS INFORMATION INCORPORATED IN IT
SO YOU IN EFFECT ARE LOSING INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THAT PAGE IS ABOUT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS POINTING TO IT AND THEY ALL AVERAGE OUT AS
TH THAT'S MY FIRST IDEA W WAS HOW I SET THIS I REMEMBER FOR THE LOTUS THING WASN'T THERE
FOR EXAMPLE THIS PAGE THERE'S NO TEXT IN IT WILL SET IT VERY LOW IN USER INFORMATION FOR THE LINKS
SO YOU CAN'T JUST DO IT BY WORDS BECAUSE THOSE TWO WORDS COMPLETELY SPECIFY INTO SOMETHING OR OTHER
UH SU YOU SUGGESTED DOING LIKELIHOOD BUT AT THAT TIME AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT MY PROBLEM WAS WITH THAT
YEAH THAT THAT IS FAIR
YEAH I SO UH I I THINK THAT THAT'S TOO EASY
YOU CAN DO IT WITH SOME HEURISTICS AND YOU CAN LEARN IT FROM THE TASK RESULTS IN OR COMBINE THE TWO SO THA THAT'S KINDA STRAIGHTFORWARD I THINK
THE THE THE THING ABOUT DOING IT THROUGH CROSS VALIDATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WITH THE TASK IS UH THE PROBLEM WITH DOING A PAGE RANK STYLE ALGORITHM IS THAT IS THAT IT GETS BETTER IT IT CONVERGES BETTER AND IT GIVES YOU BETTER RESULTS
THE CLOSER A NETWORK IS TO BEING A SMALL WORLD NETWORK
THE CLOSER IT'LL BE TO THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE NET N THE INTERNET WHICH IS A SMALL WORLD NETWORK
AND PEOPLE RUNNING THIS STYLE OF ALGORITHM THE PAGE RANK STYLE STUFF GENERALLY RUN IT ON ABOUT TWO MILLION OR TWENTY MILLION PAGES OR WHATEVER
BUT THEY HAVE M MAYBE A BIT OVER A THETA BYTE WORTH OF WEB PAGES IN THIS A BUNCH OF SERVERS
UH
WAS I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WIKIPEDIA THOUGH WAS THAT IT'S WHILE IT HAS A HIGH LEVEL OF INSIDE LINKS THAT HAS A LOT OF DIRECTORY STYLE LINKS AS WELL THAT MIGHT MESS UP IT ACTUALLY BEING A SEE WH WHILE YOU HAVE
AH OKAY THAT'S GOOD
THAT PLUS I GUESS IT'S ACTUALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO SAY TO START WITH IS THIS A SMALL WORLD NETWORK AND THEN RUN IT ON THAT
IS IT AND THAT WAS FOR HALF OF IT
YEAH THAT'S I THINK THA IT'S GONNA BE MORE TRUE IN SOME NETWORKS AND IN SOME TASKS THAN OTHERS
AND I THINK IN THE WIKIPEDIA IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE IT'S A GOOD ONE TO TEST ON
UH THE THERE'S ANOTHER THING UM UH THIS WAS NEW BUT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THIS TOO MUCH
BUT IT'S ON THE SAME LINES IN THAT UH HAVE HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THIS UH CORRELATED TOPIC MODELS WORK
HE'S GOT UH A NEW MODEL THAT'S IT'S PUBLISHED IN NIPS THIS YEAR BUT HIS CO AUTHOR PUT IT ON THEIR WEB SITE A MONTH OR TWO AGO
D YOU ALL KNOW L. D. A. OR YEAH
UH OKAY
SO A L. D. A. YOU BASICALLY DRAW A A DIRICHLET WHICH SAYS LIKE WHAT TYPE OF DOCUMENT THIS IS EFFECTIVELY
ALRIGHT WELL THAT'S FOR FOR EVERY WORD AND THAT'S ONCE FOR THE DOCUMENT AND THAT'S YOU'VE GOT A PARAMETER COMING AT THIS GLOBALLY
AND I THINK P. L. S. A. HAS THIS PROBLEM AS WELL IN IS THAT UH THE MORE TOPICS YOU HAVE
BECAUSE THE TOPICS IT CLUSTER IT IT PUSHES A DOCUMENT IF IT IS PULLING A DOCUMENT INTO ONE TOPIC IT PUSHES ANOTHER TOPIC AWAY FROM THAT
SO THE MORE TOPICS YOU HAVE THE MORE TH THEY'RE SORT OF SQUEEZING INTO THE SPACE OF WHAT THINGS CAN BE ABOUT UH AND THINGS ARE KINDA PUSHED OUT
SO ONCE YOU M GO OVER YOU TRY IT ONE CORPUS
UH ALRIGHT SO WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY THEY THEY STOPPED USING THE DIRICHLET AND UH THEY'RE STARTING TO USE UH A GAUSSIAN THERE
SO IT IT IN TO SPARE THE DETAILS BASICALLY THEY'VE THEY'VE GOT A VARIABLE HERE
I THINK THEY CALL IT ETA UH AND THEY FROM THIS GENERATE A DISTRIBUTION OF TOPICS IN SOME WAY
BUT IT'S GENERATED FROM A GAUSSIAN SPACE FROM A FROM A A SPACE SO IT'S GIVEN A A MEAN AND COVARIANCE UH AND
YEAH UH SO WHAT IT DOES THE THIS IS THE THE BIT THAT TOOK ME FOREVER TO UNDERSTAND ACTUALLY UH SAME MODEL
BUT THIS IS GIVEN A GAUSSIAN SPACE IT MAPS THAT DOWN INTO THE SIMPLEX OF WHAT A TOPIC CAN BE ABOUT
THE SO THE SIMPLEX BASICALLY IF YOU'VE GOT A SAY YOU'VE GOT TWO TOPICS
NOW SAY I I SAY YOU GET THREE TOPICS THAT MAKES MORE EASIER TO DRAW
UH FOR THIS IS THETA ONE THETA TWO THETA THREE
THESE ARE THE PROBABILITIES THAT THAT A DOCUMENT IS ABOUT UH THIS THETA ONE IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS ABOUT TOPIC ONE
THETA TWO IS SO THESE GUYS ALL HAVE TO ADD UP TO ONE YEAH
UH SO THAT BASICALLY MEANS THAT WHAT A DOCUMENT IS ABOUT LIES ON THIS SPACE BETWEEN THEM YEAH
UH SO BASICALLY A DISTRIBUTION GENERATED BY THIS GUY IS BASICALLY A POINT ON THIS SIMPLEX
SO YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY AS YOU LIKE UH AND YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY'RE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
YOU CAN SEE HOW THE DOC T THE DOCUMENT CHANGES FOR EXA STU STUFF BASED ON THAT
WITH THIS IDEA WHAT IF RATHER THAN WORKING WITH THIS P. OF Z. GIVEN D. THING THAT YOU HAD FROM P. L. S. A.
BUT WHAT IF YOU WORKED FROM THESE GAUSSIANS THAT YOU GET FOR EVERY DOCUMENT AND YOU SAID THAT IN SOME SOME FUNCTION THAT SAID UH THAT THE GAUSSIAN REPRESENTING THIS SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE ONES LINKING TO IT
BUT BUT IT SHOULD BE UH STRAIGHTFORWARD I GUESS TO TO FORMULATE A BASIC IN TERMS OF THE MEAN SHOULD BE SIMILAR AND THE COVARIANCE MAYBE SHOULD BE SIMILAR AS WELL
ALRIGHT WELL THAN THANKS FOR HEARING ME OUT AND THE IDEA ESPECIALLY
SO IS IT CORRECT OR NO
OH THIS IS IS FROZEN FROZEN OKAY
OH NO RE NO I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE THE YOU SAID I WOULD TELL YOU THAT EVALUATION SHOULD BE DONE BASED ON LIKELIHOOD OR PERPLEXITY
WELL IT'S BU YEAH IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME BUT
CLEARLY WHA WE WE HAD DONE THESE
AND IF IT SHOULD IMPROVE IT IF YOU SAY THIS FEATURE EXTRACTION PROCESS IS BETTER THAN YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER CLEANER SEPARATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO
IT HAS TO BE RE IT HAS TO BE REALLY TO WITH RESPECT TO THIS THIS CLUSTERING MAKES SENSE OR I DUNNO
YOU CAN E EVEN KEEP THE BAG OF WORDS AND DO THE COSINE COMPARISON OR
JUST SHOWING JUST SHOWING HOW JUST FIRST HOW BETTER THIS IS WITH RESPECT TO BAG OF WORDS AND HOPEFULLY THEN HOW YOU NEW UH REGULARISED P. L. Z. GIVEN D. IS
BUT YEAH IT JUST RE
IS IT JUST IT JUST SOMETIME DANGEROUS TO SAY TH THESE LATENT ASPECTS MEANS THIS
AND IT CONVERGE AND SO YOU HAVE THE BOOST UH INITIAL P. L. S. A. AND P. L. S. A. PLUS THE LINK THING THEN
SO TH YEAH YOU YOU YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO EVALUATE THAT NOW
BUT BUT MAYBE YOU YOU COULD HAVE SOME SOME OTHER LABELLI LI OR THE TASK LIKE IF IF YOU IMAGINE YOU HAVE SOME LABELLING ON OF OF THE WEB PAGES LIKE LIKE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU YOU LOOK AT AT AT AT AT A SET OF PAGES
AND YOU HAVE THE M THE DIRECTORY ENTRIES OF THESE PAGES SO SO F LIKE YAHOO OR ENTRIES
SO YOU HAVE CATEGORIES AND AND ENTRIES SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE I DUNNO CARS S. U. V. ETCETERA
SO WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE WOULD BE THAT TWO PAGES ON IN THE SAME UM CATEGORY SHOULD BE CLOSER THAN THAN TWO PAGES BEING SPREAD ACROSS DIFFERENT CATEGORIES
BUT YOU YOU WOULD NOT USE THIS YOU WILL NOT USE THE YAHOO DIRECTORY OR N THE DIRECTORY IN THE TRAINING STEP OF I OF THE MODEL OKAY
AND THEN FOR EXAMPLE YOU YOU YOUR TASK WOULD BE TO SAY I HAVE SOME PAGE AND AND I KNOW WHERE IT IS IN THE IN THE IN THE DIRECTORY
SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHECK IF IS IS IS THERE SOME SIMILARITY IN THE IN THE IN THE ASPECT DISTRIBUTION
TELLS ME UH SOMETHING ABOUT UH THE SIM THE THE FACT THAT THEY COULD BE ON THE SAME CATEGORY IN THE THE THIS END END LABEL CATEGORIES
AND YOU HAVE SOME PAGE WHICH ARE UNLABELLED BUT YOU HAVE LINKS BETWEEN THOSE TWO
SO WHAT WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS THAT YOU WOULD TRY AND P. L. S. A. AND AND UH AND USE A MODEL OVER THAT
THEN THEN YOU WOULD LIKE TO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT F WHAT COULD BE VERY SIMPLE WOULD BE JUST TO THEN TO MATCH EACH PAGES LIKE THAT
WHAT WHAT'S IF I FROM FROM THIS PAGE WHICH HAVE THE SIMILAR SO SO THE THE CRITERION WOULD BE TO COMPARE THOSE TWO DISTRIBUTION
OKAY AND THEN AND THEN YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASSIGN TO THIS DOCUMENT TOO WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW THE LABELS THE SAME ONE AS THIS ONE
THEN YOU CAN EVALUATE HOW WRONG YOU ARE OR CU HOW CLOSE YOU ARE FROM THE REAL ASSIGNMENT THE RIGHT DIRECTORY CATEGORY
IN THIS WAY I THINK IT'S FAIR IF YOU KN IF YOU KNOW ONLY IF YOU KNOW ONLY THAT AND THAT AND WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DISCOVER IS THIS
THIS IS A R LIKE A REAL TASK
LIKE LIKE IF IF IF THIS DIRECTORY UH UH COMPANY WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND THIS DIRECTORY TO NEW PAGES WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF HAVING HUMAN LABELLING
YEAH YOU HAVE T YOU USE THIS ONE
SO YOU YOU WOULD TRAIN IT YOU THIS IS THIS IS T T ALL ALL THOSE LINKS ARE KNOWN
I D I THINK YOU CAN DO IT AS A TWO STEP PROCESS
FIRST YOU YOU TRAIN UH WELL MAYBE S IT WOU COULD BE BETTER IF IF IF YOU TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT
BUT BUT HERE YOU CAN YOU YOU SAY GIVEN A RANDOM PAGE OF P. U. WHICH OF THOSE TWO MODEL IS MORE LIKELY TO TO TO TO TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THI THE PAGE OF P. L. WHICH IS THE MOST SIMILAR
SO YOU SO SO FROM THIS SO YOU TAKE ANY DISTRIBUTION COMPARISON THINGS
SO SO YOU JUST COMPARE UH THOSE TWO DISTRIBUTIONS SO OF D. ONE AND D. TWO OKAY
AND SO WITH THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN DETERMINE FOR EXAMPLE FOR A DOCUMENT O OF THE SET TWO TO THE MOST SIMILAR
SO YOU YOU YOU YOU SELECT D. ONE SO IN THIS SET WHICH IS THE MOST SIMILAR TO D. TWO ACCORDING TO THE DISTRIBUTION FROM ONE OR THE OTHER MODEL
AND THEN AND THEN FOR THIS DOCUMENT YOU AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGN TO IT THE LABEL OF THE DOCUMENT UH ONE
SO YOU WOULD HAVE A SET OF KEYWORDS THE SET OF IMAGE LABEL WITH KEYWORDS AND HE HAS A SET OF UNLABELLED IMAGE WITH SOME
AND IT WOULD CHECK WHETHER THE THE LABEL HE ASSIGNS SO IN THIS CASE ANNOTATION WORD H ARE CORRECT
AND I THINK IT'S FAIR UH IT'S FAIR UH SETUP
THERE THERE'S SOME MIGHT BE SOME WORK TO DO BUT THE GENERAL IDEA I THINK IT'S IT'S FAIR EVALUATIONS IT'S A TASK
I THINK THE TASK OF THIS LATENT MODEL IS TO DISCOVER SOME SOME SEMANTIC LIKE SOME TOPIC PROXIMITY BETWEEN DOCUMENTS
I COMPARE THOSE TWO LIKE THE P. L. S. A. AND THE ONE OVER THIS SAME TASK OF ASSIGNING GOOD DIRECTORY
I DON'T KNOW IF IF IT IF IT WILL PROVIDE GOOD RESULT RESULT OR NOT BUT IT IS CLEARLY A BENCHMARK FOR THOSE TWO GOALS
ON ON THE INFRA YEAH YEAH
YEAH BASIC COSINE OVER THE P. OF T. GIVEN D. SO OVER ALL THIS UH EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTION
SO THE TWO PERSON COULD COME UP WITH VERY DIFFERENT ONE IS VERY INTERESTING I IN
SOMEONE WOULD SAY IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A WEB PAGE UH WH WHICH HAS VERY FEW UH INFORMATION IN IT OR ANYTHING
AND WHAT'S GOOD WITH THOSE MODEL IS THAT THEY THEY CAN THEY THEY ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE YOU SOME SOME KIND OF WAY TO COMPARE TWO DOCUMENTS RATHER THAN TO GIVE YOU PRE DEFINED SETS OF DOCUMENTS
THE O I I DON'T THINK ONE ONE ONE ASPECT OR ONE LATENT TOPIC HAS ANY SENSE BY HIS OWN
I WOULD SAY AN AN AND THIS IS OH IT IT SHOULD BE EVALUATED
MEANING THAT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE UH THE THE EXAMPLE ABOUT MARBLES IS THAT THE POINT WHAT YOU CAN LEARN FROM ALL THESE SETS MADE BY PEOPLE IS THAT IS THAT THOSE TWO THOSE TWO MARBLE WOULD BE CONSIDER AS MORE LIKELY TO BE IN THE SAME SETS
BECAUSE THEY THEY SHARE SOME COMMON PROPERTIES WHICH ARE NOT SEEN AS THE SAME FOR EVERY ONE
YOU WOULD HAVE SOME MU MUCH MORE AGREEMENT BETWEEN PEOPLE THAN THAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE PREDEFINED SETS PEOPLE WOULD WOULD JUST CUT AT SOME PRECISE UH POINT
WHAT YOU HAVE IS Y IS YOU HAVE IS YOU HAVE ONE CLUSTERING OF MARBLE WHICH IS THIS ONE
AND THEN YOU HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE TELLING YOU I CONSIDER THOSE MARBLES AS VERY UH HAVE TO HAVE VERY SALIENT FEATURE THAT THEY SHARE IN COMMON
AND YOU C AND AND AND THOSE TWO SO AND ONE OF THEM IS LABELLED AND THE OTHER IS NOT LABELLED
SO YOU LOOK AT THAT YOU SAY OH SOMEONE TOLD THIS ONE WAS VERY SIMILAR
AND THIS ONE IS SAID TO BE BLUE FOR EXAMPLE I DUNNO IF IT'S THE LABEL
THE THIS IS THE PLAYERS
THEY MAKE SENSE ONLY SO GLOBAL OPTIMISATION THE LIKELIHOOD IS OPTIMISABLE GLOBALLY OVER THE WHOLE ASPECTS ETCETERA
YOU JUST UH ASK UH IT TO FIND A DISTRIBUTION OVER ASPECTS SUCH THAT A DOCUMENT UH IS MORE LIKELY ACCORDING TO THE RESTRICTION THAT THE NUMBER ASPE ASPECT IS LIMITED
AND AND SO IT THE IT JUST MAKES SENSE ON THE UH LOOKING AT THE WHOLE SET
SO Y I THINK ALL EVALUATION SHOULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND LOOK AT THE WHOLE ASPECT SET
AN ANY ST ANY KIND OF THING YOU WHERE YOU UN UNFOLD THE MODEL AND LOOK AT IT MANUALLY
LOOKS WEIRD LIKE LIKE IN THOSE HOFFMANN PAPERS WHERE SHOW YOU COLUMNS WITH WORDS OR THINGS
BUT ALL THE PAGE LINKING TO IT ARE ACTUALLY ABOUT VERY DIFFERENT TOPICS
BUT I THINK FOR ANY KIND OF WAY YOU HAVE TO SELECT THOSE ALPHA YOU YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE EFFECT ON ON THE RE ON THE T EVALUATION TASK
BUT IF YOU HAVE NO TASK YOU CAN UH BLINDLY SELECT S GOOD ALPHAS
OR TO THE NUMBER OF IMAGE IN THE PAGES OR ANYTHING
AND AND AND AND AT AS A SECOND STEP YOU COULD INFER SOME KIND OF RULE ABOUT HOW TO SELECT ALPHAS WITH RESPECT TO THE TASK
MAYBE IT'S V IT'S VERY SIMPLE RULES BUT SELECT THEM BLINDLY S MIGHT BE ODD
BUT BUT BUT STILL LI LIKE THE THE THE WORK I DID ON ON HYPERLINKS LIKE I USED UH WIKIPEDIA
WELL YOU CAN CATEGORISE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE TH IT'S THERE'S A STRUCTURE ON THE ON THE WEB PAGE
WELL WHAT I DID WITH THE LINK WELL BUT THIS IS NOT TH EXACTLY THE SAME SETUP YOU WOULD HAVE
SO IN THIS SETUP THE WHOLE LINK STRUCTURE COULD BE KNOWN
AND THE ONLY THING YOU WOU DON'T YOU W DON'T KNOW WOULD BE THE ASSIGNATION TO UH TO A CATEGORY
BUT THIS IS THE YEAH THIS IS THE HYPOTHESIS BETWEEN THIS UH IN THIS P. L. S. A. WITH LINK STUFF
OH YEAH I THI
BUT YOU CAN YOU CAN THINK ALSO AT AT OTHER UH TASK LIKE THAT
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN TAKE PROCEEDINGS AND ASSUME THE CATEGORIES ARE THE KEYWORDS OF THE OF THE D OF THE DOCUMENTS
SO YOU YOU YOU CAN FIND EXAMPLES WHICH ARE NOT THE WEB I THINK IT'S GOOD TO WORK IN CLOSED SET
YOU HAVE TO THINK AT AT AT AT AT AT AT DATABASE WHERE THERE'S LOT OF IN LINKS
BUT IT'S DISCRETE UH NO THE
OH WHAT WHAT IS THE TOPIC HERE
MUCH MORE THAN ME
TO THE D. C. D.
OH I CANNOT SAY IT
TO THE HILBERT ENVELOPE YOU MEAN NO
I DIDN'T DO US SO MUCH ON THAT
WELL WE WE TRIED UH MANY KNOBS TO TUNE ON TH ON THAT
WE WANTED TO MAKE AS CLOSE TO TRAP AS IS POSSIBLE WHICH IS SILLY BUT THAT W YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE
Y OKAY
SO SO WHAT WELL LAST TIME WE WE WERE S TALKING ABOUT WHAT ABOUT GAUSSIANS
AND THEN THE TANDEM TRAINING C ALSO SO THE YOU ARE ABLE TO TRAIN THE NET NOW
EH
AH I SEE
YES BUT OLIVIER MAKE IT RUN ON ON THESE MACHINES AND MAKE THE UH CROSS THE TWO G. BARRIER HERE AT IDIAP
BUT HE IS HE IS NO GOOD IN QUICKNET RIGHT I S I GUESS
SO YOU JUST MISS THE BACK END WHICH IS EASY BECAUSE IT'S H. T. K. IT'S EVERYONE KNOWS HERE
SHOU SHOU SHOULD I LIST IT
BECAUSE SEE YOU FEED SOMETHING TO THE M. L. P. WHICH ARE NOT THE WAVES
SO SO WELL AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT
AND THEN THE BACK END
WITH VAR VARIOUS LENGTHS WE WERE TRYING TO TO START THEM FROM FROM ON THE ULTIMATE LENGTH OF ONE ONE UH FRAME UP TO ONE SECOND OR EVEN MORE
ALSO W THEN WE APPLY THE D. C. T. ON THE TRAP ITSELF WHICH IS SOME SOMETHING LIKE THE GAUSSIANS
SO THESE I HAVE SOME RESULTS ON
SO IT'S LIKE FEEDING THE P. L. UH P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. S W WHATEVER TO M. L. P. AND TAKING SOME CONTEXT
BUT MAYBE YOU SOME MORE RESULTS OH IT'S HEMANT WHO HAS THE RESULTS ON TANDEM I GUESS NO
BUT UH I THINK THE UH I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS ARE ALREADY IN THE THESIS HE'S WRITING
SO SO IS THERE SOME SOMEWHERE
BUT THAT YOU JUST DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ANY SUB BAND SO FAR
AH HE'S NEW
SO UM JUST THEY IN TH UM IN THE SPEECH UH RE SYNTHESIS OR CODING WHAT YOU'RE DOING UM DID YOU TRY TO TO PLAY WITH THE KNOBS SOMEWHERE
I M NO NO
LIKE WHAT TO USE SO THAT IT SOUNDS THE BEST
SO SO YOU WON'T SAY THAT THE L. P. C. IS NOT ABLE TO FIT IT SO THAT THE RESIDUAL WAS EASY
WILL BE HERO
ARE NOT SUPPOSED
I THINK YOU HAVE TO PUSH IT PUSH IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT REACTS TO THE
OH WHICH LINES
I WAS THINKING THE RESIDUAL IN L. P. C. FIT OF THE HILBERT ENVELOPE NOT THIS
'CAUSE THERE ARE THREE THINGS
FIRST YOU HAVE TO ENCODE THIS THEN THE L. P. C. COEFFICIENTS AND THE RESIDUAL AFTER L. P. C. FIT IF YOU LIKE
OH YOU DON'T
AND SO SO SO THE SO THE BROADER BANDS DO WHAT ON THIS PICTURE
SO FIFTEEN IS ABOUT OKAY
SO THAT YOU GET SO THAT YOU CAN'T MODEL IT ACTUALLY
OH OH OH COMPRESSION
S
UH
ABOUT THREE PAPERS
I JUST N
ALSO I CAN UM BEFORE MARIUS LEFT HE HE HAS HE HAD ACTUALLY LEFT HIMSELF
AND THERE IS ALSO ONE BIG TABLE THAT HE USED HE USED TO YEAH
AND THERE IS A BIG TABLE IN IN EXCEL WHICH YOU CAN LOOK AT
THIS WA
UH YEAH
BECAUSE IT IT IT TOOK A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME
AND HE BASICALLY HE HE WAS THE FIRST ONE TO REALISE THAT THESE THESE GUYS ARE PRETTY SLOW TO TO DO THESE THINGS
SO HE HE HE JUST UH HE JUST UH PUT HERE THE P. MAKE ENVIRONMENT AND HE DIDN'T STICK TO ANY CLUSTER OR ANYTHING
HE JUST PUT P. MAKE AND RUN IT ON UH ON ALL THE MACHINES HERE
SO AT TH IN THE MORNING ALL THE MACHINES WERE WERE JUST STUCK
D NO ONE COULD EVER M MOVE THE MOUSE
BUT HE DID
HE WROTE IT WELL
BECAUSE I W I IN THE CODE THAT I WROTE I WAS LIKE PLAYING ALSO WITH IF IF THE MAT MATRIX IS PARSE I REALLY DON'T USE IT ALL
I JUST MULTIPLY FROM HERE TO HERE FROM HERE TO HERE
OH WELL WHATEVER
BUT THE T
UH
BUT THERE IS A THE BACK END RECOGNIZER WHICH I WILL GIVE YOU WHICH IS TURN AROUND OF EIGHTEEN MINUTES OR WELL FROM ELEVEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES
NORMALLY IT WOULD TAKE HOUR AND A HALF
NO TODAY IT WAS OVER ONE HOUR
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THESE
UH I JUST TALKED TO ONE GIRL THERE WHICH TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD BE POSSIBLY ABLE TO FIND ME A JOB THERE
YEAH BUT T S BUT YEAH
WE HOPE THAT YOU FIND OUT THAT EVERYTHING WAS WRONG AND THAT THE POTENTIAL IS MUCH BIGGER
YEAH IT ACTUALLY WORK THAT TOO
AND I WILL POINT YOU TO ALL THE CODE WHICH I HAVE
BECAUSE IN THE F WHEN THERE TH WERE THE FLATS IN I LOST ALL MY PAPERS FROM MY SCHOOL
NOTE NOTE YEAH ALL THE NOTEPADS AND EVERYTHING ALL THE NOTES FROM ANY COURSES
SO SO I HAVE IT NOW BACK AT LEAST PARTIALLY
YEAH AND ALSO IN THE IN THE L LAB LABS THE D PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THEY JUST FOLLOW THE PAPERS
UH
NOT TO THIS TOPIC
YEAH BUT ANYWAY AFTER I'M BACK I'LL BE STILL ON SKYPE AND ALL THESE THINGS
SO NO PROBLEM TO CONTACT ME UNTIL I DON'T KNOW MAY NEXT YEAR
WELL I WOULD LIKE TO YEAH
BUT I WOULD HAVE TO STUDY HERE FOR THAT THAT LONG TIME NO
AND I WOULD HAVE TO STAY ONE MORE
AND EVERYTHING IS IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR HER AT LEAST
FOR A GIRL IT'S ALWAYS THE PAIN
YEAH BUT I THINK DEFINITELY YOU ARE THE BEST PERSON HERE TO WITH UH RELATED TO AVAILABILITY OF YOU
HE'S THERE OR AND WHEN I CAN AND I THERE WAS NO OP UH NO EV EVERY TIME I CAME TO YOU YOU WERE AVAILABLE
WE KNOW THE DETAILS AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS TH WHAT IS THE GLOBAL STUFF
S SO JOEL IS GOING TO TALK
WELL MAY FROM DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW
LET ME JUST TELL US SO WHAT YOU KNOW ALREADY ABOUT UH I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR YOU ARE WITH THE S FEATURES
SO YOU KNOW S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT T WHAT CHRISTOS WAS DOING
YEAH BUT I'M USING THAT FOR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT REASON RIGHT
SO UH WHAT IS THE TASK IS USUAL JUST TAKE THE SPEECH OF COURSE SOMEHOW TO ENCODE IT INTO AS AS SMALL NUMBER OF BEAT AS POSSIBLE AND WITH A REASONABLE QUALITY OF COURSE
AND AGAIN TO E UH DECODE IT
SO JUST DIVIDING THE SPEECH INTO ONE S ONE SECOND FRAMES DOING D. C. T.
BUT YOU ARE DOING THE SAME NO
I D I DO
I'M USING THOSE GAUSSIAN FILTERS OR CLASSICAL THOSE THOSE TRAPET TRAPEZOIDAL LIKE IN UH M. F. C. C. S RIGHT
AND THEN PROCESSING EACH F YEAH P. L. P. S
THEN I'M DOING S DOING UH INDEPENDENT PROCESSING OF EACH FREQUENCY BAND
YEAH SO THOSE ARE TWO PARTS OR ITEMS YOU NEED SOMEHOW TO ENCODE IF YOU WANT AGAIN TO GET ORIGINAL SPEECH OR REASONABLE QUALITY
SO IT'S AGAIN COMPRESSION FACTOR SOMETHING LIKE TH AND BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO UNCOMPRESS IT AGAIN OF COURSE TO GET BACK THE SPEECH
AND THERE OTHER OTHER THINGS WHICH I'M DOING
BUT IT'S NOT RELATED TO SPEECH RECOGNITION SO MUCH OR BUT
THERE IS M UH JUST MORE RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
SO OF COURSE I HAVE TO LISTEN IT AND AND S WELL SO NOW WHAT I'M USING ARE FIFTEEN BANDS
OR ALSO THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM
SO THERE IS MORE AND MORE S UH FREQUENCY COMPONENTS LET'S SAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN ONE BROAD BAND
L. P. C. WILL MAYBE
UH
SO WHAT WE CAN SEE IS SOME HILBERT ENVELOPE LIKE THIS
BUT THIS IS THE SIGNAL WHICH WE GET FROM ONE DI ONE FREQUENCY BAND
AND WHAT WE GET FROM THAT IS THIS HILBERT ENVELOPE RIGHT
IT'S JUST REALLY CLOSE TO COSINE WE M WE MIGHT SEE IF WE DO IT DO IT PROPERLY RIGHT
BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK FOR EXAMPLE FOR A S IF YOU HAVE A VERY G GOOD MUSIC SIGNAL
WHICH IS VERY UH PERIODIC YOU CAN REALLY SEE SOMETHING LIKE THERE IS ONE PEAK AND
SO THEN YOU CAN TRANSMIT UH JUST FE
OBJECTIVE MEASURE WELL IT WAS SOME THOSE UH DISTANCES SPECTRAL DISTANCES WELL EDINBURGH SAW PROBABLY
SO WELL I MEAN
I H
ALSO THERE ARE PAPERS ABOUT IT THAT F IF YOU HAVE LIKE TWELVE FREQUENCY BANDS IT'S SOMEHOW OPTIMAL
COMPRESSION IS ONLY TO REALLY TO SOMEHOW FEED THAT UH HILBERT ENVELOPE TO YEAH
THERE IS NO ECHO OR SOMETHING LIKE REVE REVERBERANCE IN THE SIGNAL IF YOU REALLY GO DOWN WITH THAT COMPRESSION FACTOR TO LIKE ZERO POINT ONE SOMETHING THAT
IT'S IT'S S RIGHT
LET'S SAY IN R. S. S.
I THINK HYNEK HAS GOT MA MANY PAPERS OR SOME PAPERS OVER THAT
SO OH
IN I THINK I READ IT
THEY ARE THAT'S REALLY ENOUGH ON
YEAH THEY ARE MORE LESS THEY ARE SAME LIKE
N NOTHING LIKE THAT
MAYBE NO
NOW IT'S NOT SO BAD WITH THAT IF YOU REALLY WRITE IT F WELL
AND HE DID
R RIGHT
UH
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO T TALK OR TO TEACH
OH IT'S GRADUATE FOR GRADUATES
SO YEAH WE PUT THIS STUFF ON SO THAT SO THAT WE HAVE SOME RECORD OF THE WHOLE THING WHAT UH ARE GOING TO SAY
UH THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS MEETING IS THAT IT'S NOT ME WHO WILL BE TALKING ALL THE TIME
SO I SO THE P THE ACTUALLY THE REASON WHY WE GOT TOGETHER IS THAT IT'S AB IT'S ABOUT THE TIME TO A. MAKE SURE THAT WHEN PETR LEAVES US UH I'M AFRAID IT MAY HAPPEN
SO SO THAT WHATEVER HE'S WHATEVER HE'S BEEN DOING UH IS NOT UH FORGOTTEN AND THEN PEOPLE CAN STAY ON HIS SHOULDERS AND UH I HOPE THAT HE WON'T GET OUT ENTIRELY OUT OF UH OUT OF UH THIS PROBLEM
SO I THINK THE JOEL WILL BE IS IS MY MAIN HOPE THAT HE'S UH HE'S GOING TO PICK UP UH THE KEY WORD SPOTTING AND SOME OF THESE IDEAS AND ALSO THE REASON WHY P UH I P UH UH PETR MOTLICEK IS HERE IS THAT JOEL IS ALSO GETTING INTERESTED IN UH OPAL MODELS OF UH TEM TEMPORAL ENVELOPE
SO ABOUT IT BUT PETR MOTLICEK TOO
EH BOTH OF YOU YOU KNOW
SO BUT BUT BUT YOU WILL BE HERE AND FROM DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW EH
SO M I I GUESS THAT REALLY YOU SHOULD BE TALKING MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE ASKING QUESTIONS
OH THIS WERE HO HOW IT STARTED BASICALLY BECAUSE THAT WAS UH MARIOS ATHINEOS YEAH AND DAN ELLIS
SO THEN I THE STORY WAS THAT THEN UH MARIOS PRESENTED THAT AT SO SOME MEETING AND WE REALISED OH
SO SO MARIOS WAS HERE FOR HALF A YEAR MAYBE OR EVEN MORE UH AND UH STARTED WORK WITH PETR WHO ALSO J JUST CAME
MAINLY M MARIOS WAS UH PROGRAMMING IN MATLAB AND PETR WAS PUTTING IT INTO FANCY IS YEAH AND UH BUT UH AND BUT THEN WE WERE HOPING UH UH UH TH TO PICK UP ON THAT LITTLE BIT MORE
YOU DID A LITTLE BIT OF WORK
SO YOU MAY BE THE ONLY ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD NOW
BECAUSE UH BECAUSE CHI FONG IS GONE AND UH AND UH BARRY IS GONE
UH CHI FONG WENT TO T. I. AND UH AND UH UH UH B BARRY IS AT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LAB
HE BASICALLY GOT A JOB
HE HE GRADUATED
HE CAN'T EVEN SAY IT ON A MICROPHONE HERE I HEARD
IT'S AND SO SO JO MORGAN WAS H ONLY HALF JOKING
HE WAS S SOMEBODY WAS ASKING HIM YOU WERE OR SO S OR SOMEBODY WAS ASKING HIM SOMETHING
UH OR THERE WAS UH THERE WAS UH MATTHEW AND HE SAID WELL PROBABLY WE'LL BE COMING TO ASK YOU BECAUSE NOBODY REALLY KNOWS ANYMORE AT ICSI
THEY PICKED UP THE SOFTWARE AND THEY PLAY WITH THE AND NETS
SO THAT MIGHT BE THAT BRNO WILL BE AT THE SOONEST AS UH A ULTIMATE EXPERT ON ON THE WHOLE THING
N N WHERE WHICH SOFTWARE
IS THAT SO
SO WE H HAVE TO TREAT HIM WELL
ON FRAME
HE USED TO HAVE BEFORE HE LOST ALL THE DATA
BUT HE WILL HAVE IT AGAIN
KNOWS MORE THAN THAN THAN I DO
S SO THAT'S GOOD
BUT CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE UH THE THE OPAL MODELLING OF TEMPORAL TRAJECTORIES
UH AS AS I SAY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ARE NOT HERE THAT THAT PETR MOTLICEK KNOWS ENOUGH ABOUT IT TOO
BECAUSE SAME AP YEAH DIFFERENT UH APPLICATION DIFFERENT UH DIFFERENT SOFTWARE OR SOMETHING
YOU MAY ALMOST WANT TO DIS UH UM I B UH UH UH YEAH UH B USE THE WHITE BOARD
I MEAN UH AND UH THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IT HERE RIGHT SO THAT
I THINK NO WE ARE WIRED
BUT SINCE YOU ARE IN A DIFFERENT DOMAIN THIS IS HE HERE WE ARE IN TIME DOMAIN RIGHT
SO IT UH THE LINE'S TURNING TO INTO SINES RIGHT
AND YOU P AND SINCE THIS THIS I MEAN BECAUSE THIS THI THIS THIS SPECTRUM IS AL HAS ALSO LINE SPECTRUM RIGHT
AND IF THE FREQUENCY DOESN'T CHANGE OVER THE WA OVER OVER THE LENGTHS OF THE UH
BUT BUT F F FORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF HE UH BECAUSE OF PROPERTIES OF HEARING MORE OR LESS
FOR THE HIGHER BANDS YOU IF YOU PUT IN JUST S SOME GARBAGE SOME NOISE IT DOESN'T REALLY M W MATTER ALL THAT MUCH
UH WHERE YOU REALLY W IF YOU WANT TO G DO A GOOD VOICE SPEECH UH YOU'LL WANT TO GET THE LOWER BANDS CORRECT
IF MOTOROLA OR NOKIA GETS HOLD OF THIS UH TAPE THEN WE ARE IN TROUBLE
IT'S IT'S UH IT'S BUT LISTEN THIS IS A SCIENCE
BUT WE W WE OF OF COURSE WE WILL
AND UH AND UH BUT UH WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT UH IF QUALCOMM HAS A INTEREST OF WHO'S FUNDING THE WORK THE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO UH TO TO PATENT IT OR SOMETHING
THE ONLY PROBLEM WOULD BE IF BUT YOU KNOW
NOBODY CAN BEAT P PETR UH PETR MOTLICEK ANYMORE IN I MEAN IF EVEN IF IF NOKIA KNOWS EVERYTHING IF YOU IF YOU SELL IT TOMORROW WHO DID YOU WORK FOR TH THE UH UH TEXT NO
T H. P. H. P.
WHEN YOU COMP UH W WHAT YOU COM WHEN YOU COMPRESS THE EFFECTIVELY THEY'LL WANT THE SIGNAL WHICH WE ARE MODELLING
HERE YOU COMPRESS THE THE TH THIS TH THIS I THE WHAT FUL YEAH OF D. C. T. OF OF THE SIGNAL RIGHT
SO YOU CAN ALWAYS EXPAND IT BACK SO THAT YOU GET THE C THAT YOU GET A FIT TO THE TO THE ORIGINAL THING
BECAUSE UH IT HA TH BASICALLY THIS OPAL MODELING HAS A DIFFERENT PROPERTIES
OH THIS IS TERRIBLE
BECAUSE IN THIS UH THI THI THIS SPECTRAL TRANSFORM ALLOWS YOU TO TO FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN HOW WELL IT FITS PEAKS
AND SORT OF THE SO THIS IS G SO I THINK THAT BASICALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I MEAN YOU SHOULD BE ASKING QUESTIONS RIGHT
AND THEN YEAH THIS IS A THIS THEY ARE TWO PAPERS IN UH ONE IS IN SAPA ONE IS IN UH U. INTERSPEECH
AND ONE WAS IN THE A. S. R. U.
SAPA WAS A S I I TELL YOU WHAT IT STANDS FOR STATISTIC AND AD AND SOMETHING AD AND UH PERCEPTUAL APPROACHES
I WAS ON F I WAS ON A F W S ORGANISING COMMITTEE
BUT THEY ARE THE SAME RIGHT AS UH AS UH AND THEN ALSO IS THERE IS SOME MORE WORK ACTUALLY CAN BE TRACED DOWN
I THINK THERE WA UH THE READING LES ATLAS'S PAPERS ARE VERY GOOD
BUT HE USES D. C. T. AND THEN HE P UH SO THE SO SO AND IT AND LES IS EXCELLENT GUY
HE'S VERY GOOD MATHEMAT MM H VERY GOOD THEORETICIAN
AND UH REALLY HE LIKES TO WRITE THINGS WELL
SO HE'S VERY RIGOROUS UH AS OPPOSED TO S TO ME FOR INSTANCE
IS THAT SO
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT
HE HAS ALL KINDS OF SPEECH RECOGNITION RESULTS RIGHT
EVERYBODY HATED HIM FOR T UH TEMPORARILY
I YEAH I REMEMBER FRANK CAME TO ME AND SAYS IS EVERYBODY WAS COMPUTING LIKE MARIUS WE WOULD BE ALL DEAD
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE THIS THAT UH THAT THINGS SPED UP TREMENDOUSLY SINCE I CAME
I MEAN UH OF COURSE PARTIALLY BECAUSE THEY STARTED TO BUY SOME MORE UH MORE HARDWARE
BUT ALSO BE P SOME AT LEAST SOME PEOPLE BASICALLY KNOW HOW TO UH UH WRITE FASTER PROGRAMS
UH
AND THEN DID YOU GET ANYTHING IN F IN FRANCE
OH IT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S THE WOULD BE A PITY RIGHT
YOU YOU CA YOU T SO YOU DON'T DIE OF HUNGER
WE'LL WE'LL UH WE WILL WE'LL TRY SOMETHING LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
SO JOEL YOUR MAIN BASICALLY THING IS AS I TOLD YOU TO T UH WHEN WE WERE WALKING THAT UH THAT WHAT WHATEVER PETR DID
AND OBVIOUSLY UH V WE VERY MUCH HOPE THAT YOU GET INTO THAT AND YOU GET EXCITED AND YOU DO S MORE AND UH OR UH MAYBE EVEN DIFFERENT THINGS
UH
AND I AND THIS AND THIS IS ALL ON THE RECORD
SO IF WE UH IF UH IF WE YOU CAN HOLD HIM TO HIS WORD
J JU YOU REWIND
UH YEAH
UH BUT IT'S CO ACTUALLY COMPILATION OF UH REALLY COMPILATION OF TWO CLASSES I WAS GIVING AT O. G. I. WHICH IS LIKE SPEECH PROCESSING AND AND UH PERCEPTION
I S I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW IF IT NEEDS TO BE FOUR CREDIT OR NOT
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I LIKE PEOPLE WITHOUT UH N NOT TAKING IT FOR CREDIT BECAUSE THEN THEY JUST SIT THERE AND HAVING GOOD TIME
I DIDN'T GET INTO TOO MANY THINGS ACTUALLY
BUT SUDDENLY WE SA S HE SAID WELL SO SO WHERE ARE YOU
SO I THE L. P. C. PART WAS LIKE I HAD TO DO IT IN ONE HOUR
IT WAS AT D. B. F. L. YEAH
OH WE'LL SEE
YOU HAVE TO P YOU HAVE TO BACK THIS UH UH HA H SPECIALLY PETR
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WILL BE DONE BY MAY
IS IT PLAN
I THINK IF I HAD TO DO IT AGAIN AND WE MADE A MISTAKE WE SHOULD HAVE REGISTER YOU HERE AT E. P. F. L.
SORRY YOURS YOU WERE OR YOU WERE HERE T YOU WERE YOU WERE HERE HOW LONG YOU WERE HERE
SO IS SHE GETTING UH UH ANOTHER POSITION THERE
OH I SEE
I MEAN WHEN YOU CAME IT WAS JUST LIKE CRA ONE OF THE CRAZIEST UH UH TIMES OF THIS YEAR
BUT IT JUST LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE WRITING THESIS ALL THE TIME RE WRITING AND CHANGE THE DO MAKE A LITTLE CHANGES AND UH UH AND
YEAH HE'S VER NO HE HAS MANY MORE SP MANY MORE PEOPLE SO TO TAKE CARE OF
WELL I'M TYPICALLY I TRY TO BE BECAUSE UH BECAUSE YOU KNOW I MEAN FOR S THIS IS ALSO MY LIVELIHOOD RIGHT STUDENTS
SO I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT UH THEY NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING THAT UH SO FEEL FREE BASICALLY TO STOP BY ANY TIME AND UM YEAH AND UH IT'S NOT THAT I KNOW EVERYTHING
OH BOY
YEAH S YEAH YEAH
S
IT'S UH THE PAPER BY DAN ELLIS AND CO
A. S. R. U.
SO FOR
SO I JUST MOVING AROUND WITH THAT IDEAS
SO UH MAYBE TO LIST DOWN THE THINGS OTHER THAN THE WHAT I'VE ALREADY TAKEN FROM YOU
BUT UH MAYBE I CAN TAKE THE INTERCEPTOR FROM YOU AND RUN IT ONCE ON MY TO HAVE IT
SO THEN I CAN CAN SHARE WHAT I CA HAVE READ AND UH
SO I'LL USE THIS
LET'S DO THE FEATURE EXTRACTION THAT WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THEN THE BACK END FOR THAT
AH
FRAME
YEAH THAT'S RI
UH YEAH
YEAH USE MAYBE YOU CAN USE THE BOARD FOR THAT YEAH
YEAH IN THE FOR UH FREQUENCY IT IS
UH ONE THING I WANTED TO KNOW IS ANY UM A GOOD LITERATURE ON THESE LINES
YEAH THAT'S ONE YEAH O UH TH OH
UH YEAH
HE DOESN'T SEND
BU THREE I MEAN FOUR CREDITS
AH
BECAUSE S S IN I. S. IT'S FOUR UH CREDITS AND UH GUILLERMO IS TAKING I THINK HE'S G YEAH
IN OKAY
UH YEAH
SO TH
TO THE BORDER BASICALLY SOME DISTANCE
DON'T YOU THINK WITH A BEAM ALSO YOU HAVE LESS PROBLEMS WITH THE SHEETS
OH JUST KIDDING
AH SO YOU HA YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE MULTIPLE COLOURS
I MEAN WILL YOU HAVE A CAMERA
OR ON THE TABLE UH THERE SHOULD BE WELL
HO HOW DOES IT WORK
Y THAT'S ALL
AH OKAY OKAY
BUT MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED IT
Y YOU GET UH THE ANGLE
UM NO
AH THE RADIUS
TH THEN THE R THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE GEOMETRY IT'S THE UM I YOU NEED MORE THAN ONE BASICALLY
AH AH
UH
WELL TH THESE ARE DETAILS
BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN YOU DO F. F. T. Y IF I'M GETTING INTO DETAILS BUT YOU YOU APPLY UM A WINDOW TO AVOID EFFECT
SO THE BEGINNING AND THE END IT IT I IT'S NOT CRAPPY
AND YOU GIVE HIGHER COEFFICIENT TO THE MIDDLE THAN TO THE EXTREME
SO IF YOU DON'T DO OVERLAP Y YOU WILL LOSE INFORMATION AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END
UM C. M. U. NO
IS IT FROM C. M. U.
F. F. T. IS ONLY A TOOL
AND THE END IS UM A NUMBER OF UH FREQUENCY BEAMS WHICH ARE USED BY EACH PERSON TO UH EXPLAIN ROUGHLY
S SO WHEN YOU SPEAK SPEECH IS WIDE BAND
SO UM THE MORE ACTIVE YOU ARE THE MORE BAND WIDTH YOU USE
'CAUSE ONE PROBLEM IF YOU USE ENERGY BASED METHODS WHICH IS PROBABLY MORE UH THE THING YOU'VE BEEN USING SO FAR
IS THAT IT'S NOT UM QUITE RELATED TO LOCATION
SO I WOULD ADVISE TO UM USE MORE UH PHASE DOMAIN METHODS
BUT UM MAYBE I'LL GO T TO THE BOARD
R RIGHT FOR A SINGLE CHANNEL IT'S NOT VERY MEANINGFUL
WITH F. F. T. YOU CAN JUST UH AS I SAID L LOOK AT THE PHASE BETWEEN THE MICROPHONES AT A GIVEN FREQUENCY
IS AN APPROACH WHERE UM TH UH YOU DIVIDE THE SPACE IN SECTORS
AND ON THIS ONE YOU COULD HAVE A LARGE VALUE
ON ON ON THOSE ONES SMALL VALUES
YEAH Y WELL I I USE A VALUE
WELL F YEAH I IT'S NOT UH I IT'S AN INHERENT PROBLEM TO THE GEOMETRY YOU USE
UH
UH UH I W MM I WOULDN'T TRUST IT TOO MUCH
CLASSICALLY WHAT YOU DO IS YOU EXTRACT THE SIGNAL OF THE PERSON
UM ONE INTERESTING THING IS THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE NOT UH ARBITRARY THINGS
YOU KNOW ALREADY WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THIS PROCESSING UH W WHICH PART OF THE FREQUENCIES OF THE SPECTRUM UM BELONGS TO THIS PERSON AND TO THAT PERSON
YOU CAN SPLIT IT AND SAY UH ALL THESE PARTS BELONG TO PERSON ONE HERE
BUT THEN UH YOU CAN LOOK STATISTICALLY IT WI IT WILL BE NEGLIGIBLE UM BECAUSE THE R OF UH OF THE DIFFERENCE LEVEL
IT'S UH YOU CAN LISTEN TO IT YEAH
BUT UH I'VE I'VE SEEN QUITE A FEW PAPERS I I'VE N NOT DONE IT MYSELF
I'M REALLY ON THE LOWEST LEVEL
UM BUT UH ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS AS I SAID
UH
ONE
THEY WILL B YEAH
BUT AGAIN YEAH I THINK ONCE YOU SEE THE SPECTRUM IF IT'S JUST PURE AND STABLE
UH
SO I'VE TO AVOID UH FILTERING AND SMOOTHING
UH NOW IN SPITE OF THAT I KNOW SOME PEOPLE USE MUCH LONGER WINDOWS WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM
YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PLAY WITH IT JUST TO SAVE PROCESSING TIME LIKE USE SLIGHTLY LONGER FRAMES
YEAH AT M AT MOST YEAH
IF THIS IS YOUR ASYMMET AT EACH TIME YOU GET A DIRECTION
NO NO OF THIS IS UH REALLY DIFFERENT
FOR EXAMPLE UH AT TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS
YEAH TH
BUT THEN YOU LOSE A LITTLE BIT ON PRECISION
EIGHT YEAH UH I GET DOWN NOW TO ONE TWO DEGREES UH ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR
UH SO YOU MIGHT NOT NEED THAT
I USE TWENTY DEGREE SECTORS
ON THE SIDE I'VE DONE SOME SINGLE CHANNEL WORK WHICH CAN MAYBE HELP
UM M THIS PART IS QUITE SPECIFIC TO A MICROPHONE ARRAY WHERE LIKE THEY ARE CONCENTRATED IN UH SOME PLACE LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE
R RIGHT
IT HAS TO BE AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE
YOU KNOW NO
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE WAS A DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONE POINTING THERE YOU WOULD GET MOST OF MY ENERGY BUT LESS FROM YOU ET CETERA
UH UM MIGHT NOT BE RELEVANT
UH
M UH I GUESS SO
Y YOU WOULD UH ASSUME
NOW I DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO USE AH IT'S ALMOST OKAY
WELL I GUESS IT'S JUST A RESTRICTION WE TOOK
OTHERWISE WE COULD HAVE UH WE COULD IMAGINE TO HAVE A WHOLE TABLE OF OF UH S WELL OF L. E. D. S
AND THEN Y YOU CAN REALLY START TO TO SOME REGIONS OF THE TABLE
OH LET'S
WELL IT'S ALSO ABOUT TABLES BUT THE IDEA IS IF UH UH THE SEVERAL STUDENTS COME TO A TABLE WITH THEIR LAPTOPS
AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE ABLE TO USE THEIR THEIR MOUSE OF THEIR LAPTOP TO GO TO THE TO THE PROJECT SCREEN THERE AND UH THE PROJECT SCREEN IS JUST ANOTHER WINDOWS MACHINE THAT IS RUNNING
SO YOU JUST HAVE ANOTHER F COMPUTER MORE OR LESS YOU CAN USE BUT YOU CAN USE IT WITH YOUR YOUR OWN MOUSE AND KEYBOARD
BUT UH IN CONTRARY TO TO HAVING AL ANOTHER KEYBOARD AND MOUSE THAT ONLY ONE PERSON CAN USE
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH UH AUDIO PROCESSING AND UH L. E. D.
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT FIRST WE WANT TO TO HAVE SOME EVENTS LIKE TWO PEOPLE ARE TALKING OR ONE ONE STARTED AND ANOTHER STARTED AND UH WELL
MORE OR LESS BROKE INTO THE SPEECH OF THE FIRST PERSON AND SO ON
AND THEN YOU CAN START TO VISUALISE THESE UH DIFFERENT SITUATIONS
WELL THAT'S UH I GUESS IT'S FIRST PROTOTYPE I YOU SEE WE START WITH UH PEOPLE TWO PEOPLE TALK OR AND DON'T AND DON'T THEY
AND WI WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS WITH UH WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS ON ON TABLE YOU COULD UH DISPLAY THIS THIS UH GIVE SOME FEEDBACK
EVERYTHING FROM UM MULTI SWITCH ADMINISTRATION OF UH AUDIO AND HOW YOU CAN UH ANALYSE IT UH WHAT INFORMATION YOU CAN GET OUT OF SPEECH AND SO ON
PROBABLY IT'S UH IT'S F BE A GOOD IDEA IF YOU HAVE S TWO UH WITH UM WITH SOURCE LIKE UH BOOKS OR WEB PAGE CENTRE
AND IS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS IN REAL TIME
WELL UH M WE HAVE
YE
WELL ACTUALLY JUST TO HAVE THE THE ICSLA E UH POSSIBLY TO TO BRANCH ICSLA
YOU SEE NOW YOU YOU HAVE IT QUITE CENTRAL
AND UH WHAT HAPPENS IF IF YOU PUT THEM HERE ON AROUND THE TABLE
WELL THAT'S SOMETHING WITH F. F. T. S
SO THE MAGNITUDE YOU DON'T REALLY USE
WELL UH UH UH I DID A SPEECH PROCESSING UH COURSE AND I'M NOT SURE IF THEY A UH THEY ALSO UM MM LEARNS THAT THAT
AND WHAT HAPPEN UH IF TWO PERSON ARE TALKING AT THE SAME TIME
THIS IT JUST GET TWO SECTORS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN OTHERS NO
OTHERWISE IT COULD ALSO JUST RELY ON THE FREQUENCY BAND SEPARATION AND DETECT THAT WAY THE DIFFERENT PERSONS AND TH THEN YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE AROUND THE TABLE THESE
UH
THAT WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE WHERE WHERE IS THE THE VOICE LOUD WITH UH OR THE LOUDEST
AT THE END IT IT DEPENDS A BIT WHAT YOU WANT
OKAY UH FOR FOR UH THE NOISE SENSITIVE TABLE PROJECT UM WE DECIDED TO UM TO TAKE THE NOISE UH AS INPUT
SO THIS IS UH ONE OF THE THE POSSIBILITIES THAT WERE OFFERED TO US
BUT UH WE DECIDED TO DO TO DO UH IT THIS WAY
BUT UH IN FACT WE HAVE A THERE WAS TH YES
TH THERE WAS THE THE RESTRICTION THAT IF WE COVER THE LE THE TABLE WITH LEDS UH SOME WON'T BE VISIBLE BECAUSE UH YOU HAVE UH YES
SO WE DECIDED TO HAVE IT UH YES THIRTY CENTIMETRE UH AT EACH SIDE
BUT UH TH THERE ARE O OTHER PROBLEMS LIKE UM YES THE THE INFORMATION DISPLAY ON THE SHEETS
AND THERE IS UH A LOT OF PROGRAMMES NOW ABOUT THIS IMPLEMENTATION
IS IT'S NOT UH IT'S NOT OBVIOUS
UH
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TO BEGIN WITH THE THE EXPLANATION ABOUT THE THE RELEASE
SO UM I HAVE ACTUALLY TWO QUESTIONS THAT ARE UH JUST PRACTICAL QUESTION ABO ABOUT MY UM MY IMPLEMENTATION NOW
SO AND THE FIRST INFORMATION IS UM ABOUT THE THE NOISE LEVEL
N NOT THE NOISE LEVEL THE SOUND LEVEL
AND UM A WAY THE WAY UH IT IS IMPLEMENTED NOW UH TO DETECT YES
AND UH ON THESE PACKETS I WANT TO KNOW THE THE SOUND LEVEL THE AVERAGE SOUND LEVEL
BUT I DON'T KNOW UH IF
UH
IS THERE A WAY TO UH TO FROM ONE UH FROM ONE STREAM TO UH TO BUILD TWO STREAMS THAT CORRESPOND TO THE THE VOICE OF ONE PEOPLE AND THE VOICE OF THE SECOND
AND IT IT THIS IS NOT UH
UH YES
THE THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE THE EXTENSION AND IS UH OF THE
UH OKAY
AND THERE IS AN EXTENSION FOR THIS THIS UH THIS DEVICE CONNECTED TO IT UH WITH UH OPTIC FIBRE
UH YES
BE BECAUSE FOR NOW UH I'M JUST SAMPLING THE SOUND THAT UH EIGHT THOUSAND
BUT UH THIS IS JUST TO GET THE THE S THE NOISE THE SOUND LEVEL
BUT UH IF I WANT TO RECORD THE CONVERSATION WITH UH UH A PROCESSING AFTER TH
YES TO TO HAVE A BETTER SOUND QUALITY
BUT UH WHAT IS THE THE GAIN
M UH WHAT YOU GET IS UH THE REAL POSITION OR UH JUST UH THE ANGLE AT WHICH THE THE SOUND COMES
UH BECAUSE UH THERE THERE IS JUST UM FOUR MICROPHONES THAT ARE EIGHT
BECAUSE UH AT AT T. P. F. N. THERE IS A LAB THAT IS UH HAS DONE ALMOST THE SAME THING
BUT THEY HAVE UH EIGHT MICROPHONE THAT ARE UH AT UH YES THE EIGHT UM THE EIGHT UH UH COR CORNER OF UH A CUBE YES
BECAUSE UM BECAUSE I THE UM THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE THE MICROPHONE IS TOO UH IS TOO LOW TO
UH YES THE THE I TAKE THE THE B I G WHEN I GO UP TO THE THE CURVE UH I'M UH ON THE AT THE LOCAL MAXIMUM
DIFFERENCE IS UH IS THAT IF I JUST UH
UH
YES AND THEN I JUST UH BECAUSE UH WE ARE USING UM UH AN OPEN S AN OPEN SOURCE FRAMEWORK TO DO THIS
SO UH THERE IS UH ALREADY UH AN F. F. T. UH MODULE IMPLEMENTED IN IT
Y YOU HAVE TO DETECT UH AN EVENT ON ONE MICROPHONE AND UH KNOW WHEN IT'S HAPPENED ON UH ON THE OTHER ONE
AS AS YOU MENTIONED
AND UH FROM FROM THIS KIND OF IF INFORMATION YOU CAN UH LET'S SAY HAVE UH A FINGER PRINT OF THE USER TO KNOW UH IF THIS IS THE SAME USER SPEAKING
RANGE
BECAUSE UH PERHAPS UH PERSON TWO WILL HAVE UH SOME FREQUENCIES IN THE RANGE OF
THE YES THE FAN
IF SOMEONE UH HAS AN UH SOME NOISE WITH UH PERHAPS PUTTING HIS UH HIS CAP ON THE ON THE TABLE
PERHAPS IF THERE IS A LAPTOP AND UH IN ONE POSITION
AND THE THE LENGTH OF THE TIME FRAME HAS UM AN INFERENCE OF UH ON UH WHICH PARAMETERS
TH THERE I UH LET'S SAY IF YOU USE A ONE SECOND WINDOW
BUT THE THE THE THE LONG UH THE LONGEST FRAME YOU WOULD USE WOULD BE ONE HUNDRED
AT MOST OKAY
UH YES
AND BEFORE I FORG FORGET IT UH I HAVE ONE QUESTION
ONE ONE OR UH BIT LONGER
BECAUSE WE WANT WE REALLY WANT TO DETECT UH IF TH THIS IS THE SAME PERSON THAT IS SPEAKING OR NOT
IF THERE IS UH AN ERROR OF UH LET'S SAY UH TEN FIFTEEN DEGREES AND BUT UH IT IS UM CAPABLE OF UH SEEING IT AS TWO DIFFERENT PERSON
BUT TH UH UH I THINK WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE IS THE SYNCHRONIZATION OF THE MICROPHONES
SO I DON'T KNOW IF UM UH WHAT I'VE SEEN W ON OUR WEBSITE WAS UH THAT THE THIS INSTALLATION WAS UH A BIT EXPENSIVE
UH BUT I'M TRYING TO UH TO TO TO SEE WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND UH WHAT IS NOT UH FOR
OKAY FOR THE OUR WE'LL WE WE'LL UH
SO HE DECIDED TO UM TO MAKE MORE RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC
SO THE GENERAL TOPIC UH IS ABOUT UH INTERACTIVE TABLE UM DISAPPEARING COMPUTER UM WHAT IS THE OTHER ONE
UM UM NA UH IN THE GENERAL FI FIELD OF UH COLLABORATIVE COMPUTER SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING
SO THE IDEA IS WE HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COLLABORATING UH IN A PEDAGOGICAL PURPOSE
SO IF WE MAKE THE COMPUTING UM FUNCTIONALITIES DISAPPEARING ON ON THE IN THE FURNITURE
IN THE WALL OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT WE MAY MORE EFFICIENTLY SUPPORT UH COLLABORATION THAN THE THE LEARNING
UH GUILLAUME AND UH MICHAEL UH ARE TWO STUDENTS THAT ARE WORKING UH FOUR FOUR MONTHS TO THEIR MASTER PROJECT
SO THE IDEA IS UH OKAY W WE HAVE IN THE LAB A NOTION ABOUT UM ROOT MIRRORING
THE IDEA IS IF WE CAN PROVIDE A FEEDBACK TO PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER UH IT MAY HELP THEM SELF REGULATING THEIR ACTIVITY THEIR COLLABORATION
UH AT O. P. F. L. WE ARE UH
AT O. P. F. L. UH THE LEARNING CENTRE WILL BE BUILT IN A COUPLE OF UH YEARS
SO THE IDEA WE WE WILL HAVE PLENTY OF ROOMS UH LIKE IN LIBRARIES OR MEETING ROOMS WHERE STUDENT WILL ARRIVE AND WORK
UH MAYBE THEY WILL JUST BY SEEING AN EXPLICIT UH FEEDBACK OF THAT THEY WILL UM TAKE PROFIT UH OF IT AND UM
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON UH WHAT'S GOING ON UH WHAT ON THE FEEDBACK
UH DANCE
SO UH THE FIRST SHAPE OF THE TABLE THE SHAPE OF THE TABLE OBVIOUSLY IS ONE OF THE FACTOR ON THAT WILL CHANGE THE COLLABORATION
AND THE SO THIS L. E. D. MODULES ARE BEING UH DESIGNED UH NOW
UH SO THE STUDENT WILL BE ASKED TO DESIGN UH A TABLE
SO TO FIND THE SHAPE UH OF THE TABLE TO GET UH WHO THE AND PUT THAT UH ON THE UM ON TABLE UH LEGS
B BUT WE WILL UM RESTRICT IT TO A SMALL UH TO HAVE THE SAME DISPLAY
IT I DON'T KNOW WE'LL WE WE WILL TRY UH WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT UH WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS PROTOTYPE
SO BASED ON THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE P. F. L. STUDENT HAVE THEIR OWN LAPTOP UH THE IDEA IS THE SIMILAR IDEA UH IS TO OKAY
PEOPLE ARE COMING ON A SHOULD BE ABLE TO VERY EASILY UH USE SOME UM RESOURCES OFFERED TO THEM
SO UH MAYBE WE CAN FOCUS A LITTLE UH UH BIT MORE ON THE WHAT WE HAVE DONE ABOUT UH THE NOISE SENSITIVE TABLE
TELL YOU ABOUT UH WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN ON THE SO WE START SO GUILLAUME STARTED BY UH DEVELOPING THE APPLICATION THAT GET THE AUDIO INPUT
SO WE WANT IT TO HAVE A MODULAR ARCHITECTURE TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE EACH UH LAYER SEPARATELY
SO THE AUDIO INPUT UH IS QUITE BASIC NO
WE U WE USE UH SOUND CARDS TO TO GET UH THE SIGNALS AND TO DETECT TO UH ON TO HA AND WE HAVE A THRESHOLD TO DETECT UH WHEN SOMEONE IS TALKING
AT LEAST WHEN THE NOISE IS UH AT UH IS BIGGER THAT UH SPECIFIC LEVELS
SO VERY SIMPLE ONE COULD BE ONE PERSON IS TALKING
SO IT'S UH THE EASY ONE
W WE WILL UH WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE VISUAL GRAMMAR MEANING THAT WHEN WE HAVE AN INTERACTION EVENT THAT IS UH FIRED
THAT COULD BE AN UH INSTANT UH FEEDBACK
AND IF HE HAS BEEN TALKING MAYBE SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE LAST FIVE MINUTES AS ME
UH UH IT IT MAY BE REFLECTED AS THE UM INTENSITY OR SIZE OF A S A CYCLE
AND THEN IF THERE'S TURN TAKING WE CAN SHOW WAVES OF LIGHT GOING FROM UH ME TO YOU UH OR FROM OTHER PEOPLE
OR USING THE CENTRE PART OF THE TABLE TO SHOW SOME SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THE UM UH MORE GENERAL UH DYNAMIC
IN UH WE CAN CHANGE INTE SO WE HAVE UH EIGHT BY EIGHT UH TWO TIMES LEDS
TH UH M. G. B. LED
IT'S UH ONE OBJECT THAT WILL UH G PROVIDE A FEEDBACK TO THE TERMINAL USERS PEOPLE COLLABORATING AROUND UH THE TABLE
BUT IT ALSO A TOOL FOR US AS A RESEARCHER TO TEST UH BOTH THE INTERACTION EVENT WE WANT TO DETECT AND TO TEST THE VISUALISATION
AND UH WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROCESS TO POST PROCESS SOME CONVERSATION JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND TO UH HAVE THESE UM MODELS ON FEEDBACK WORKING WHEN PEOPLE ARE USING THE TABLE
IT'S ABOUT UM BECAUSE WHAT WE CAN UH RECORD IS UH SOUND UH ORIGINS
SO IN PO UH SO NO SONIC POINTS
BUT WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN IS PEOPLE
SO RIGHT NOW OUR PRACTICAL SOLUTION IS TO HAVE ONE UH MICROPHONE CLOSE TO UM EVERY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO SIT
SO WE CAN INFER THAT IF A SOUND IS COMING IN THIS AREA IT'S THE SAME
SO KIND OF TRICK
AND A LAST QUESTION THAT IS RELATED T UH OUR LAST IF I NOT FIND ANOTHER ONE UM
ABOUT PEOPLE IF SOMEONE IS LEAVING OR IF SOMEONE UH MAYBE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING EV UH QUITE COMPLEX EVEN FOR YOU
IF SOMEONE IS STAYING HERE BUT IS QUIET OR LEAVING HOW CAN WE DETECT THAT SOMEONE IS HERE BUT QUIET
UH
OH THE WAIT AND THE SIT
OR PUTTING HIS BAG ON THE OKAY
BUT IT WAS JUST TO IT'S A QUESTION
SO WE HA WE HAVE THE COMPUTER WE HAVE THE THE MAIN BOX WITH THE EIGHT LINE INS
TO HAVE EIGHT MORE X. L. R. IF WE NEED IT
BUT WE ARE NOT SURE TO TO BUY IT NOW
I DON'T KNOW IF IN ANOTHER EXPERIMENT MAYBE IN ANOTHER PROJECT IF WE WANT TO HAVE COMMENTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE OR O ELSEWHERE
UH GETTING UH HAVING THE POSSIBILITY OF USING X. L. R. MICROPHONE COULD BE UH UH COULD BE NEAT
THEY WON'T HAVE NICE LIGHT UH LIGHTING ON IN FRONT OF THEM
SO MAYBE W UH YOU COULD PRESENT A DIFFERENT WORK UH YOU HAVE DONE
SO YOU TOLD US IT WAS DIFFERENT PIECES MORE THAN ONE INTEGRATED DEVICE
OH UH
AN IDEA
SO THE PHASE THE TIME BETWEEN UH AUDIO SIGNALS FOR UM FOR THIS MICROPHONE ON THIS MICROPH
SO IT'S AT ONE GIVEN MOMENT STILL
OKAY SO YOU CAN SAY THAT F THIS FREQUENCY BELONGS MORE TO THIS PERSON AND THIS ONE MORE TO THIS ONE
BUT SOME FREQUENCY MAY MAYBE ARE NOT USED NEITHER BY UH GUY THE GUY ONE OR THE GUY TWO
SO YOU NEED TO S
AND CAN YOU DETECT IF SOMEONE IS LAUGHING OR ANGRY D UH THERE IS KIND OF SIGNATURE UH EVEN IF WE CAN'T REALLY TRUST IT UH UH S ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME
UH
IS IT WHAT YOU SAY
WITH THE ENERGY DISSOLUTION OR WITH UH F. F. T. TOO
SO WHAT ARE THIS MIC FOR INSTANCE THE ELECTRET MIC
SO B MAYBE I'LL GO BACK TO YOUR QUESTIONS
UH
UH
IT'S MAYBE N YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THE WHOLE UH COMPLICATED MODELLING BUT
AND US YEAH YEAH SO THESE MEASURES ARE A WAY TO QUANTIFY THAT
UH P NO
WHAT W W WHAT IS M WHAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE IS TO UM TAKE THE DECISION FINALLY
SO YOUR DECISION CAN BE FOR EXAMPLE UH WHO IS IT OR IF THE PERSON MOVED
S
WELL UNLESS SOMETIMES SOMEBODY GOES THERE OR YEAH
BUT THAT YOU CAN DO WITH LOCATION IF IT'S ONLY ON THE SHORT TERM
ON ON THE OFF LINE YEAH
I WOULD SAY YOU MIGHT USE THESE MEASURES IN A SIMPLE WAY IF YOU DO IT UH ON LINE
BUT UH YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT ANOTHER SIDE OF YOUR PROJECT IS ALSO TO ANALYSE OFF LINE
WE HAD A STUDENT HERE HE FINISHED UH ONE OR TWO YEARS AGO BUT HE LEFT HIS SOFTWARE
AND HIS SOFTWARE IS PRECISELY TO DO THAT TO UM CLUSTER AT UH ANOTHER LEVEL
TO CLUSTER THESE SMALL CLUSTERS OF SPEECH UH GROUP THEM BY PERSON AUTOMATICALLY
Y NO FROM THE THESE MEASURES PITCH ETCETERA
AH YOU WANT TO DO VOICE RECOGNITION
SO THE TYPE OF THINGS I PRESENTED CAN LEAD TO SEPARATION
'CAUSE QUITE OFTEN PEOPLE UH DON'T REALISE THAT THEY TALK AT THE SAME TIME UM INTERRUPT EACH OTHER
UH
UH ONE IM IS ABOUT THIS UM SECTOR BASED STUFF LIKE UH THE LOCALISATION AND DETECTION
IT NO YOU CAN DO THAT
UM THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE QUITE DIFFERENT SO A SINGLE FIXED THRESHOLD VALUE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM
S
SO UH I HAVE ANOTHER PAPER WHICH MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR THAT FOR A SINGLE CHANNEL UH CALIBRATION
AND I'VE CODE ON LINE SO FOR THIS PARTICULAR ONE
AND THE LAST ONE I WOULD SAY IS UM THE CLUSTERING UM TO UM YEAH
THE CLUSTERING OF THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS OVER TIME SO THAT YOU CAN GET SMALL CLUSTERS OF SPEECH
UM THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO IT BUT UH I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IN SPONTANEOUS SPEECH ALL THESE WORDS ARE QUITE SMALL
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU OR NOT
WE HAVE YEAH WE HAVE O. C. R. BUT MAYBE NOT ON THIS COMPUTER
ONCE I I UM CODED THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART IN C. JUST TO SEE SO YOU CAN HAVE A MIX OF BOTH
OR ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE PITCH NO
DON'T ASK ME HOW IT'S DONE I I KNOW THE THEORY SO YEAH
AND IF YOU HAVE BOTH YOU CAN UM WELL YOU CAN COMPARE THIS TO TO ONE STORED AND SO GET OUT UH WHICH PERSON IT IS
AND UH WELL THE THINGS THAT MAKE THE SOU THE VOICE
AND AND THE THE HOLES IN YOUR HEAD EVERYTHING THE THE NOSE AND SO ON
AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY UH UNIQUE FOR EV WELL ALMOST UNIQUE FOR EVERY PERSON SO
UH Y YOU CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO COMPARE TO TO TO THE FRAMES HERE
THAT THAT THAT EVERYTHING IS DONE THROUGH THROUGH THE VOICE HERE YOU TAKE A VOICE OF SOMEONE AND THEN YOU CAN GET OUT THIS INFORMATION
IT'S IT'S NOT P IT'S CLEAR IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT S IT'S ENOUGH TO TO TO USE IT FOR FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES AND UH
UM NOT NOT THAT WELL UH AS FAR AS I KNOW
IS IT CALLED P. C. M.
I THI UM WELL IT'S IT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGY S YEAH
WELL I DID A COURSE ABOUT IT BUT UH I SHOULDN'T SAY IT TOO LOUD BECAUSE UM THE PROFESSOR IS WORKING HERE AT IDIAP
I SHOULD REREAD WHAT I SIGNED THERE SO
WELL UH IT I'M EVEN NOT SURE IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHICH PERSON IS TALKING BECAUSE UH IF UH IF IT I THINK ABOUT A TABLE
OR SO SOMETHING UH PHYSICAL
UH YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW IN IN WHICH CORNER OF THE TABLE UH SPEECH IS COMING AND NOT UH WHICH PERSON PRODUCED THE SPEECH SO
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT REALLY RELATED TO THE AH YEAH I SEE IT'S UH YOU NEED A BIT BOTH UH
YOU CAN START TO DO THIS AND UH ONCE UH PEOPLE HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION OR UH FAR ENOUGH TO T
NO IF IT'S NOT UH I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO INSTALL IT AND SO ON
UH NO NO NO YOU SEE UH I THOUGHT YOU CAN PUT IN HERE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS AND AND JUST UH DO THIS AND THEN IT MAILS ME
OKAY S AND YOU CAN MEASURE MEASURE THAT
AND I IS IT UH EXPENSIVE TO DO
BUT IN FACT IF Y YOU SPEAK OF UH A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT EXPENSIVE AT THE END YOU HAVE UH SOMETHING THAT IS
I IT IT IS IM
Y
HMM UH I I SAID UH WE WANT T TO KNOW TO UM TO DO SEPARATION JUST BECAUSE OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION
YES IT'S NOT UM EVERY IMPORTANT FEATURE FOR NOW BUT
YOU MI YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD UH THIS KIND OF THIS IS NOT IN UH MY PROJECT BUT
PEOPLE ONE SPEAK AND PEOPLE TWO AND PEOPLE THREE AND YOU ARE JUST UH SUBTRACTING THE THE LEVEL THAT YOU YOU KEPT IN THE OTHER MICROPHONES
UH IS THE THE EVENT THAT IS DETECTED IS UM WILL BE UH A SUM OF UH SMALL PARTS
SO YOU YES YOU HAVE TO TO REPROCESS TO UH TO SAY LET'S SAY YES
BECAUSE THIS IS YES THIS IS ONE THIS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ONE INTERV INTERVENTION
YOU HAVE TO CODE IT UH DIRECTLY TO THE MACHINE
AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SAME PEOPLE MOVING WITH THE CLUSTERING
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T REALLY GET THE POINT OF COMPARING THE PITCH THE PITCH IS THE IS THE FREQUENCY THAT IS OKAY
AND THE WAY YOU TRANSFORM IT UH V BY THE MOUTH
IN C. P. U. YOU MEAN
UH
FROM TH FROM THE LOCATION
I DON'T KNOW HOW MU MAYBE WE WOULD BE MORE INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THE SAME PEOPLE MORE THAN KNOWING THAT IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE
AH SOMEONE IS TALKING ABOUT ME LET'S LISTEN
AND LIGHTING A ON HIS OFFICE
IT'S N NO PROBLEM
HOW MUCH SOMEONE SPEAK BUT WHEN WE WILL GO TO FINAL UH DETAILS
IF I'M TALKING AND SOMEONE SAY YES YES YES FROM TIME TO TIME IT SHOW THAT HE'S PARTICIPATING
AND THE APPLICATION YOU ARE USING ALL OF THEM UH Y EVERY TIME YOU ARE USING MATLAB OR YOU ARE PROGRAMMING EVERYTHING IS BASED BASED ON MATLAB
I'M WRITING SO ONLY ME CAN READ
MM-HMM YEAH IN
I LIKED THE INVITED SPEAKER UM ABOUT THE IMPLANT IN THE EAR
IT'S QUITE GOOD NO
A BIT HOT STILL BUT THE BEA THE BEACH NEARBY IS QUITE NICE YEAH
YOU SHOULD TRY IT I DON'T KNOW
DID YOU GO AROUND
BEFORE OR AFTER YEAH
YEAH I STAYED I STAYED TWO DAYS BEFORE SO UH I WENT YOU JU YOU JUST TAKE THE TRAIN MAYBE THAT'S THE SAME I'M NOT SURE
WELL Y
WE CAN TAKE THE TRAM AND A TRAIN
AH
AH SORRY
NO NO NO IT'S UH OR S I'M NOT SURE
ONL ONLY O ONE WHICH SURPRISED ME A BIT IT WAS UH SPEAKER RECOGNITION I THINK BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
SO THEY USE SOME APPROACH WHERE THEY TIE THEM AUTOMATICALLY AND UH AFTER THAT WELL
IT'S MORE LIKE TYING IT IS STILL FULL BUT DIFFERENT UM COMPONENTS ARE TIED DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE MATRIX ARE TIED
UH
INTERESTING THING IS THAT THEY APPLIED IT ON SPEAKER RECOGNITION AND ON THE FEATURES BEFORE THEY HAD THREE DIFFERENT WAYS TO UM DECORRELATE THE FEATURES
IF Y SO
MAYBE I CAN FIND IT
I I IT'S NOT REALLY ANYTHING NEW BUT UH THE MM THEY JUST APPLIED THAT TO SPEAKER I. D.
BUT IT'S NOT UH AN INTRINSIC LIMITATION IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF RI YEAH
SO IT'S NOT N IT'S NOT SYMMETRIC NECESSARILY
SO HE'S MAXIMISING THAT OR MM
YEAH HO YEAH
THAT IF IT'S A VERY LONG SESSION FOR EACH TWELVE POINT FIVE FRAME YOU WILL ACTUALLY GET THE SAME SEGMENT NOW
SO HOW D
AH OKAY
MM UH WHAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT WHAT NIST IS TRYING TO DO NO
YEAH BU
YEAH BUT THEN WE ALL OPTIMISE UH ON THE SAME TASK
HO HOW HOW DO THEY HOW DO THEY EVALUATE
SO THEY ASK PEOP THEY ASK PEOPLE TO SIT AND LISTEN BASICALLY
BUT THEY D THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MEASURE LIKE YOU HAVE AN ORIGINAL SPEECH YOU TRANSCRIBE IT AND
SO MAYBE WELL BUT THEN WELL NO IF SOMEBODY LIKE NIST WILL HAVE ONE RECOGNISER AND YOU JUST PLUG A DIFFERENT FEATURE BUT UH IT'S DANGEROUS
SO I ASKED OTHER QUESTIONS BUT UH IT'S QUITE TOUGH YEAH
THEY HAVE YEAH THEY HAVE TO DO SOME TEST IN THEIR MERCEDES SOME SPEECH RECOGNITION TEST MM BUT IT SEEMS NOW THEY MM AT LEAST DAIMLER
THEY MOSTLY WORK ON DIALOGUE MANAGEMENT UH BUT NOT MUCH ON FEATURES AND RECOGNITION
UH
COHEN
ON A PHONE YEAH
AH OKAY BUT BUT NOT MUCH YEAH
AND IT'S ALWAYS THE OTHER WAY AROUND THAT'S HOW YOU PUT IT ON
I THINK THE THE MOST OF THE BAD WORDS ARE AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THE PEOPLE TRY TO PUT IN ON
WHOO
AH I CANNOT PUT IT
MEET
I REALISED IT WERE THAT THERE WERE PANEL DISCUSSIONS ONLY AT THE PLACE WHERE I COULD SEE THE THE T T YOU KNOW
UH BUT I I COULDN'T GET NO ONE KNEW WHERE IS IT WHAT IT IS WHERE IT HAPPENS AND WHY AND SO FORTH
FINALLY I FOUND BUT
YEAH W WE WENT TO THE COSTA CAPARICA THERE WITH THE BUS
CROSS THE RIVER WHERE WHERE IS THE BRIDGE AND AND THEN OKAY SO THAT WAS A DIFFERENT PLACE
THE MORE SOUTH TO TH THE HOLE THROUGH THE WATER
I WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT EVEN THE TRAMS DID HAVE A A. C. THERE
I COULDN'T SEE IT AT AT ALL
YEAH R RIGHT BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE SOMETHING LIKE IN
UH IT'S A. C.
IT IT WAS MUCH BETTER IF IF IF YOU WOULD HAVE TO SPEND A HOUR AND A HALF THAT UH HEMANT AND THE OTHERS SPENT WHILE GOING WITH A CA UH WITH A BUS TO TO THE CONFERENCE CENTRE FROM FROM THE THE HOTEL THAT WE WERE
THERE WAS A DIRECT BUS AND IT TOOK THEM HOUR AND A HALF THEN
YEAH THAT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE BUT TO TAKE SOMETHING WHICH WHICH WAS UH DIRECT IN QUOTES
IT WAS N NOT THE F DIRECT AS ANYTHING ELSE BUT
UH YEAH BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO STORE THE WHOLE MATRIX AND PLUS SOME EXTRA INFORMATION WHAT IS TIED TO WHAT OR B
BUT OOH THE THE MAIN POINT IS TO TO UH LIKE MAKE IT FASTER THE THE THE DECODING OR WHAT
SO THERE ARE NO RESULTS THERE
LIKE EXTENDED AS AS MORE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE OKAY
WHOO
THIS IS MAYBE BECAUSE OF F. F. T. U. OR THESE THINGS
IT'S NO NOT AS SMALL AS AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT MAYB MAYBE BECAUSE OF OTHER PROCESSING AFTER
UH
NO WELL UH ONCE HE GETS THE FRAME LIKE FROM HERE TO HERE THEN WHERE HE ADVANCES TO TO START WITH C COMPUTATION OF THE NEXT FRAME
OKAY SO YOU HAVE A WINDOW AND THEN YOU SPLIT IT TO S TWO PARTS AND YOU SHIFT THE THE POINT WHERE YOU SPLIT IT OR OKAY
OKAY SO ONCE YOU HAVE SAY ONE HOUR OF SPEECH YOU START AT THE BEGINNING AND FIRST YOU TRY WITH TWENTY MILLISECONDS
UH OKAY BUT WHICH WHICH LIKELIHOOD RATIO
BECAUSE SO IF THE WHOLE SIGNAL WAS UH STEADY SOMEHOW AND IT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE MODELLED BY L. P. MODEL
SO HE'S SUPPOSING THAT THE WHOLE SIGNAL WON'T BE ABLE TO TO BE CAPTURED BY L. P. MODEL AND THAT THE RESIDUE WOULD BE HIGH ENOUGH OR HO WH WHY HE'S COMPARING THE O TO TO THE OVERALL
YOU KNOW I I DON'T SEE THE POINT OF DIVIDING OVER THE THE WHOLE STUFF
Y WELL SOUNDS SOUNDS REASONABLE
SO EVEN IF IT'S VERY STATIONARY BY D UM BY DIVIDING OVER THIS WHOLE STUFF HE IS ABLE TO FIND SOME REASONABLE BOUNDARIES
UM M MA MAKES SENSE UM
THAT HAS TO BE POWER NOT ENERGY DEFINITELY NO
SO BUT THIS SO TWO THINGS I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
THI THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONLY FOR M. F. C. C. S AND THESE EASY FEATURES AH ONE QUESTION I I WANTED TO ASK BEFORE
BECAUSE DOES HE SOMEHOW PUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT WAS THE SIZE ABOUT THE FRAME TO THE FEATURE VECTOR ITSELF OR HE'S THROWING AWAY THIS FRAMING
SO SO IT N UH IT MIGHT BE BAD FOR THEN FOR THE BACK END IT MIGHT SCREW UP THE THE T SPEECH RATE OR NORMALISER
OH PROBABLY I DIDN'T GET IT TOO SO THE FRAMING IS ACTUALLY EQUI DISTANT
JUST THE WINDOWS ARE WIDER OH AH I SEE
OH I SEE SO SO IT'S IT'S LIKE THIS
UH
IF IT WORKS SO WELL
UH
YOU KNOW A ALL THE ALL THE ALL THE SIMILAR PAPERS WITHIN ONE SESSION SAY SP UH FOCUS TO THIS TOPIC
AND THROW AWAY WHAT IS NOT THAT GOOD AND AND TH THE FIRST THREE THREE PAPERS WHICH ARE THE BEST SHOU SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND USED FROM FROM THAT TIME ONWARDS
BECAUSE TO ME IT SEEMS THAT EVERYONE IS STILL COMPARING TO P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. C. S
AND THERE ARE SO MANY NEW SYSTEMS AND EVERYTHING IS NEW BUT IT BASELINE IS STILL UH T TWENTY YEARS OLD AND
UH YEAH
SO IT SHOULD BE EVERY PAPERS THEN SHOULD CONTAIN ALL THE RESULTS FROM NIST EVALUATION OR SOME STANDARD TASK THEN
YEAH BUT CAN FOR FOR EXAMPLE CAN YOU USE FROM SOME DATA FROM FROM THE L. T. WORLD
OH I UH SINCE THIS IS ONLY OKAY
UH
WE ARE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AT IDIAP AND THERE ARE ALREADY TWO S TWO DIFFERENT SETUPS
UH I THINK WE USE DI DISTINCT TRAIN AND TEST SET EVEN SE THE DIFFERENT SETS OF PHONEMES
AH
UH
BECAUSE WHO IS THE ONE WHO MAKES WHO ACTUALLY USES WHAT WE D TRY TO DO HERE
NEW BACK END OR NEW ANYTHING BUT THEY START FROM THE OLD STUFF
SO IT'S NOT RELATED TO ICSI
THEY DON'T USE ANYTHING WHICH IS TO UH TOO NEW WHICH IS NOT THAT SAFE
IT'S LIKE A IT'S LIKE A NASA YOU KNOW THEY USE FOUR EIGHT FOUR EIGHT SIX
MACHINES TO TO TO TO PUT TWO N UH SPACE SHIPS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S KNOWN TO WORK PERFECTLY WELL OR PENTIUM
AND THEN ONLY IT SAFE TO PUT WELL NOT TWENTY BUT IT'S ALWAYS YEAH YEAH OF COURSE
HYNEK ALSO TOLD ABOUT THIS COHEN CE CELL PHONE WHICH HE WAS SHOWING TO TO WORK L UH WITH THE L. V. C. S. R.
HE HE WAS SAYING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY REALLY UH SIMPLE THE DECODER I MEAN NOT THE FEATURES BUT HE WAS MENTIONING SOMETHING TO THE DECODER
THIS IS JUST THERE IS ALMO
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE NO D. T. W. OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT REALLY SURE BUT HE MENTION THAT
YEAH BUT IT'S THAT'S A SIMILAR ONE TO WHAT HERVE HAS FOR EXAMPLE SOME HE WAS SHOWING IT UH LIVE ON M. L. M. I. C LAST M. L. M. I. CONFERENCE
WELL THEY THEY JUST BOUGHT A MOBILE AND BASED ON THE O. S. IT'S USING THEY THEY THEY DEVELOPED THE SOFTWARE
YOU HAD TO GET USED TO THE SYSTEM NOT THE SYSTEM TO YOU
YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE TO ASK IS THERE ANYTHING IF I'M JUST A P PRIVATE PERSON AND I WANT FOR FREE ANY SOFTWARE WHICH IS ABLE TO READ ME A BOOK IN ENGLISH
UH FOR EXAMPLE THAT FESTIVAL AM I ABLE TO PUT THE TEXT TO THE SYSTEM AND TO IN REAL TIME TO LISTEN TO THE OUTPUT
FESTIVAL IS ABLE TO TO TO READ JUST A MM NORMAL PLAIN TEXT IN REASONABLE COMPREHENSIBLE ENGLISH OR SO THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND IT
AND IT'S IN REAL TIME ON A REASONABLE MACHINE
YEAH ON MY ON MY LAPTOP
BUT THERE ARE SOME BUILT IN LIKE EASY VOICES WHICH YOU CAN Y UH THERE IS A DEFAULT ONE COMPLETELY SYNTHETIC
AND TH THEN THERE IS A DIPHONE SYNTHESIS I THINK IT IS THE DIPHONE SYNTHESIS FROM THE SOME LIKE SOMETHING LIKE CAT W VOICE AND SOMETHI THIS IS SO SO
BUT IT'S THIS DOESN'T SOUND VERY NICE AND WE WERE PLAYING AT THE UH SUMMER SCHOOL WITH THEM ACTUALLY WITH THE AUTHORS
SO THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT FOR FREE OR SOMETHING
BUT IT IT'S NOT HERE SO FAR
YEAH I JUST S USE THE DOUGLAS ADAMS UH UH THAT THAT BOOK YOU KNOW THE MM HOW IT'S CALLED
NO THE T. T. X. T.
YOU HAVE TO BUT YOU CAN TAKE A P. D. F. AND CONVERT P. D. F. TO ASCII
THESE ARE THE EDINBURGH PEOPLE NO
N UH
N UH
SO F FOR ANY OF YOU IT'S A FIRST CONFERENCE OR MAYBE FOR
UH OK OK YEAH O OK YEAH SO THEN YOU'RE HIDING A YOU HAVE ATTENDED BEFORE YES
YEAH I SEE SEE
I T I
BECAUSE BECAUSE LIKE POSTERS IS YOU CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME POSTERS LOOKING AT M MANY POSTERS THAN SITTING TWENTY MINUTES FOR ONE ORAL PRESENTATION
SO IN T TWENTY MINUTES YOU CAN SEE AT LEAST TWO THREE POSTERS AND YOU CAN DIRECTLY TALK TO PEOPLE SO
YEAH HOW PRESENTATIONS ARE HARDLY HANDFUL OF LIKE F FIVE OR MORE
AH OKAY
EVEN SOME PANEL DISCUSSIONS ON THAT HUMAN SPEECH RECOGNITION REDUCING GAP BETWEEN THE A. S. R. AND AND H. S. R.
AH OKAY
AH OK WE WENT TO LIKE FAR SOUTH TO LAGOS AND YEAH THAT WA UH HA YEAH
BUT THE WEATHER WAS REALLY HOT THE SOUTH IT'S MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE
UH
LISBON WAS GOOD UM LITTLE BIT BIT MM
UH
NO RE YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT GOOD DIRECT BUS IS NOT GOOD LIKE
YEAH DA
UH WHAT IS THE PLACE UH THE THE CENTRAL I MEAN WHERE WE CHANGE THE BUS TO YEAH IN THE YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN CHECK THE BOOKLET
YEAH IT'S THERE LIKE I USED TO FIND BUS NUMBERS FROM BOOK ONLY
IT'S LIKE UH IN
UH
AH OKAY
IN YOUR TIE IN
NO I THINK THEY GOT GOOD RESULTS WITH JUST USING DIAGONALS OR DEFINITELY YEAH
IT'S REALLY COMPUTATIONALLY REALLY UH YEAH SO SEE SUPPOSE IF THIRTY NINE IN TE THIRTY NINE TO THIRTY NINE FOR EVERY YEAH YEAH SO
UH THERE IS A THING
NE NO PROBLEM BUT IF YOU SEE SO MANY MODELS AND SO MANY MIXTURES YEAH
YEAH THIRTY YOU CAN SEE YOU C YOU CAN'T REALLY LIKE EVEN YOU CAN'T THE MODELS ITSELF IS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT TIMES MORE THAN THAT SO
SO Y IF YOU HAVE LIKE FIVE MEGABYTES OR TEN MEGABYTES OF MODELS THEN YEAH
BUT EVEN I THINK IT'S REALLY BIT LIKE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE REALLY BIG SYSTEMS I GUESS LIKE STORING STORING ITSELF
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH IT'S REALLY TI
SO UH I FOUND ONE PAPER INTERESTING
HERE HE'S PROPOSING VARIABLE SCALE BECAUSE THE FIXED SCALE IS NON OPTIMAL FOR IT'S NON OPTIMUM BECAUSE LIKE FOR VOWELS YOU CAN HAVE M MUCH LONGER
SO IF SO THE MAIN IDEA IS LIKE SUPPOSE YOU HAVE UH ONE SEGMENT SO HE'S TRYING TO FIND THE STATIONALITY CAUTIOUS STATIONALITY OF THAT SEGMENT
YEAH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE LIKE BUT YEAH DEFINITELY YOU HAVE TO ASSUME SOME L UH LIKE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM SIZES OF YOUR OWN
SO HE IS USING MINIMUM OF MINIMUM IS UH I THINK TWE I DON'T TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLISECONDS I THINK
TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLISECONDS IS KIND OF SIFT
TWENTY MILLIS MINIMUM IS NO NO DE BECAUSE OF UH
SO EVEN I I THINK EVEN ST UH HE CAN FIND LESS THAN TWENTY MILLISECOND WINDOWS ALSO ESPECIALLY FOR PLOSIVES UH
HE
W YOU WANT TO
ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM'S AGAIN UH UH YOU SEE THE SHIFT IS THE NYQUIST FREQUENCY IF YOU COMPARED MODULATION SPECTRUM
SO IF YOU WANT TO DO AGAIN ANOTHER HIGH LEVEL FEATURE EXTRACTION AGAIN IT WILL BE PROBLEM SO
SO BUT HE'S UH LIKE HE'S HE DISCUSS I MEAN DESCRIBING THIS BECAUSE EVEN THIS ITSELF IS A PROBLEM
KEEPING THE F UH FIX TO FRAME SIZE BECAUSE YOU'RE ANALYSING YOUR THIS UH SEGMENT MANY TIMES
SO IT'S SO UH SO THE MAIN IDEA IS LIKE FIRST TO TAKE THE SOME SOME WINDOW
SOME SAM SOME SAMPLES THEN HE ASSUME SOMEWHERE SOME VARIABLE AND POINT THERE IS A CHANGE
THEN THEN IT'S NOT SYMMETRIC I YOU CAN CHO UH Y IT'S BASICALLY UH TOO LIKE AGAIN DO FOR ALL THE SAMPLES IN THAT GYRO
SO THEN WHAT HE DOES IS LIKE HE PROPOSED UH LIKE SOME LIKE RATIO TEST BASED ON MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD
SO TH THA THAT IS REALLY SIMPLE LIKE SO WHAT HE DOES IS LIKE SO HE HE COMPUTES THE RESIDUAL
HE FIRST HE DOES THE L. P. ANALYSIS AND THEN HE COMPUTES THE RESIDUAL
AND HE TAKES THE RESIDUAL ENERGY OF F FULL SIGNAL LIKE GY GY GYRO SAMPLES
NO THAT'S THAT LIKE HE ASSUMES YEAH SIXTY MILLISECONDS OR SOMETHING HE START WITH SO SO THEN HE CAN YEAH YEAH
YEAH THEN HE CAN SPLIT THAT WINDOW AT POINT N. SAY POINT N. SO THEN YOU WILL HAVE GYRO TWO NO YOU CAN SEGMENT IT MAYBE
YOU CAN MOVE YOUR POINT SO THAT THEN THIS WILL BE LIKE ONE AND THIS WILL BE SECOND
HE DON'T START WITH THE YEAH HE DON'T S YEAH START WITH GYRO SAMPLE OR SOMETHING
HE'S STARTING WITH UH SO THE L LEFT WINDOW IS STARTS AT TWENTY MILLISECONDS
SO RIGHT WINDOW IS SHOULD END AT TWELVE POINT TWO SO YOU'RE TO SEARCH BASICALLY IN THIS RANGE
IF YOU D
NO THE POINT IS DEPENDING ON THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO
SO HE GOT SO HE SUPPOSED THIS SO THIS IS SUPPOSE SE SEGMENT ONE AND THIS IS SEGMENT TWO
SO AND THEN HE P GIVES SOME KIND OF IN TERMS OF THIS RESIDUAL LETTER
THEN THERE WOULD BE SUPPOSE THIS POINT IS SAY N.
SO THIS THE B BASICALLY THE MAIN HE QUESTIONS OR HERE
YEAH HE'S FOR FINDING THE LIKELIHOOD FOR FULL FRAME AND THEN IT'S BASICALLY LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST
SO RESIDUAL POWER HE CAN COMPARE T SO HE AFTER DO AFTER DOING L. P. HE CAN GET A L RESIDUAL AND THEN HE CAN COMPARE THE POWER OF THE RESIDUAL
YOU JUST NEED TO TAKE THE ERROR OF N UH RESIDUAL OF THIS FULL WINDOW AND THEN RESIDUAL OF ENERGY OF THE SUB WINDOWS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST DIVIDE THEM AND THEN THE ONLY THING IS LIKE AGAIN HE HAS TO USE SOME THRESHOLD TO DECIDE
HE GOT UH HE'S FOUNDING SOMETHING MORE UH AROUND THREE OR THREE POINT FIVE E. S. T. OPTIMUM THRESHOLD
BUT THE AND ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS LIKE IT'S NOT REALLY CHANGING SPEECH RECOGNITION WHATEVER SO NOT REALLY CHANGING BECAUSE OF THE THRESHOLD SO
THIS IS THIS IS THE ACTUALLY BASICALLY SOME THEORETICAL PROOF LIKE MAYBE IF YOU WANT THRESHOLD YOU CAN SEE AND HE'S CODING FROM UH LEVEN LIKE UH
WHAT THEY SAY HERE IS LIKE SUPPOSE IF YOU ANALYSE TWO DISTINCT OR UH THIS L. P. ANALYSIS IN THE SAME STATIONARY ANALYSIS WINDOW
THE CODING WILL ALWAYS BE GREATER THAN THE ONES RESULTING FROM THIS ANALYSIS IN TWO WINDOWS
IT WILL BE ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE MM TH THESE ERRORS OF TWO STATIONARY WINDOWS
ENERGY LIKE BECAUSE C. GYRO COMPONENT LIKE SO HE'S USING M. F. C. C. SO HE'S NORMALISING THE C. GYRO COMPONENT FOR THIS T YEAH
NO N NO YOU VO WHAT YOU MEAN LIKE THE WINDOW LENT
UH BUT I THINK IT'S HE HE DOESN'T USE I GUESS BECAUSE UH UH THEN LIKE YOU JUST YOU TAKE THESE FEATURES AND YOU TRAIN MODEL SO
NO HE WILL GET LIKE EVERY TEN MILLISECONDS HE GET ONE FRA ONE FEATURES
LIKE HE IT DOESN'T REALLY DEPEND BECAUSE SUPPOSE IF YOU TAKE YOUR T CASE
BUT I TELL UH AT EVERY TEN MILLISECONDS WHETHER YOU GIVE SOME FEATURES OR NOT REALLY MATTERS NO
SO IT DOE YOU CAN USE UH THIRTY MILLISECONDS OR FIFTY MILLISECOND WINDOW
SAME
IF YOU USE YEAH THAT BECOMES REALLY
YEAH FIRST THIS IS PROPOSED BY LIKE UH EVEN WE READ ONE PAPER IN OUR READING GROUP YOU REMEMBER THAT
NE HE WAS RE HE WAS QUOTING
YOU'RE TRYING TO SEGMENT YOUR S SIGNAL INTO LIKE DISCREET WINDOWS AND THEN SO BUT HE WAS TELLING LIKE THIS UH RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPTIMATION AND AND THEN CAUTIOUS STATIONALITY IS NOT REALLY OBVIOUS
SO STATIONALITY IS AGAIN DIFFERENT NO
STATIONALITY IS THIS IS OPTIMATION WE WANT TO LIKE SEE SOME SIGNAL
IT TAKES MAYBE YEARS AND AGAIN UH IT DEFINITELY LIKE WHO WILL WHO WILL CHOOSE THE TEN PAPERS LIKE AND IF WE ASKED YEAH
BUT YEAH THOSE THINGS ARE PRACTICALLY KIND OF REALLY BUT I THINK THIS KIND OF THINGS WHAT YOU SHOWED I MEAN WHAT YOU SAID IS REALLY GOOD
LIKE IF PEOPLE START IMPLEMENTING LIKE SOME PEOPLE PROPOSE SOMETHING IN FEATURE LEVEL SOME PROPOSE IN SOMETHING IN MODEL LEVEL BUT THESE TWO ARE REALLY INDEPENDENT NO
YEAH ESPECIALLY FEATURES LIKE SUPPOSE IF SOMEBODY COME WITH DIFFERENT GOOD FEATURES AGAIN PEOPLE ST AGAIN USE M. F. C. C. S
NO NO IT IT'S NOT REALLY SURE ALSO MAKE SUPPOSE UH PEOPLE YOU CAN'T REALLY FORCE PEOPLE TO USE SAME FEATURES
SO SO THEY WO THEY WILL BE HAPPY WITH THEIR OWN FEATURES AND THEIR OWN SCRIPTS SO THEIR BIT RATE LIKE TEND TO CHANGE FEATURES EVERY TIME AND IT'S
SO AT LEA ESPECIALLY L. V. C. S. R. IN REALLY BIG SYSTEMS THEN PEOPLE
WHAT TECHNIQUE T USE IS IT'S YOUR CHOICE LIKE BUT THAT DATABASE AND THEN THE RESULTS ANALYSIS IS THEY DECIDE SO
PEOPLE GIVE SOME DATABASE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DIS YOU CAN USE WHATEVER YOU WANT AND YOU HAVE TO PRODUCE EVEN FOR FEATURES ALSO LIKE FEATURES ALSO I THINK
YEAH YEAH THE THEY THEY DESIGNED THE DATA SUCH A WAY THAT IT'S IT'S REALLY LIKE REALLY REAL UH DATA
AT THE END THEN THEY WILL ASK YOU TO SYNTHESISE SOME SENTENCE AND YOU HAVE TO SYNTHESISE THEM AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SEND THEM
EVALUATE IT'S AGAIN SUBJECT TO S UH BECAUSE FOR SPEECH SYNTHES YEAH
UH
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN UH I THINK EVEN THEY'RE CONTINUING THIS FOR UH NEXT YEAR AND
AND ON THIS FEATURE EXTRACTION STUFF AND SO AT LEAST IF YOU MAKE TASK SIMPLE FOCUS
THEN IT MAY BE GOOD TO COMPARE THESE FEATURES AND BUT IF YOU S USE SOME UH LARGE VOCABULARY SYSTEM
IT TAKES T SIX MONTHS TO BUILD AND AT THE END YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUR FEATURES ARE REALLY UH SO
IT'S IT'S SUCH A B LIKE LOT OF TIME INVOLVED SO YOU CAN'T REALLY CHECK MANY THI
BUT AT LEAST IN IDIAP WE HAVE THIS NUMBERS RECOGNISER IS ALMOST KIND OF FREE SO EVERYBODY IS USING SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING NO
BUT MAYBE YOU ARE USING TWENTY NINE THAT'S FOR YOU IT'S DIFFERENT BUT ONE MORE
HEMANT AND WE'RE ALL USING TWENTY SEVEN SO
NO BUT TEST SET IS DIGITS YOUR M MAIN TASK IS DIGITS K YEAH
THAT'S UH LIKE BUT O. G. I. NUMBERS ARE THERE LIKE NOW WE'RE LITTLE BIT CONVULSED
BUT IT'S BETTER LIKE ONCE YOU HAVE LIKE WHATEVER THE BACK END
YEAH AT LEAST I MEAN WHA THOSE STUDIES I THINK PEOPLE ALREADY DID FOR EVEN IN I. C. I. C. S. L. P. TWO THOUSAND TWO THERE IS SPECIAL SESSION ON FEATURES FOR AURORA
THIS ICSI FEATURES AND THIS UH S UH S UH O. G. I. FEATURES AND ALL THIS
NEW
BUT MAYBE MY HAVE A F FOR PUBLISHING ANOTHER PAPER OR SOMETHING
LIKE UH YOU WORKED I WITH THESE SIEMENS PEOPLE OR NO SIEMENS OR THESE DAIMLER CHRYSTLER
WHAT KIND OF FEATURES DO YOU USE LIKE DO YOU USE UM ANY YOU DON'T YEAH YOU DON'T
YEAH EVEN S YEAH
THESE KIND OF THINGS ARE A BIT YEAH
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY LIKE FEELING THAT WHETHER THEY GO FOR ALL THESE NEW FEATURES OR THEY USUALLY USE ONLY MM
BUT EVEN THEY DON'T BELIEVE LIKE WITH ONE PAPER OR TWO I GUESS BECAUSE AT LEAST FOR THEM NO P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. C. S
THEY KNOW THAT OKAY THESE THINGS WORK ON EVERY TASK SO OKAY WE CAN PU PUT HANDS ON THESE THINGS YEAH
MAYBE LIKE YEAH F BECAUSE SUNIL IS WORKING IN NOKIA HE'S A EXPERT IN KIND OF FEATURES OR YEAH IT L I THINK
NO NO N NO THIS UH COHEN YOU MEAN LIKE UH UH
OH OK
BUT THIS WAS SIGNAL COMPANY NO LIKE
UH THEY HAVE LIKE REALLY S MANY RECOGNISERS I GUESS
YEAH TOO NEW IS REALLY DEFINITELY BECAUSE LIKE WANT TO AT LEAST SEE I AT LEAST FOUR
FIVE YEARS OF RESULTS OF SOME NEW FEATURES AND SOME CONSISTENT RESULTS OR
AH
UH SPACE OR AH OKAY
IF THEY WANT TO MAKE ON MOBILE THEY DON'T WANT REALLY USE SOME FANCY REALLY EXPENSIVE COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE FEATURES OR ALL THESE
BUT MOST OF THE TIME MOBILES THEY USE D D. T. W. KIND OF THING NO LIKE
ALL THESE UH SO VOICE CALLING YEAH VOICE CALLING AND THESE THING BECAUSE THAT'S EASY LIKE
NO THE SOFTWARE IS AGAIN ON TOP OF MOBILE OR LIKE IT COMES WITH YOUR MOBILE
NO THE THING IS USUALLY THESE KIND OF THESE KIND OF FACILITIES ARE LIKE NO NOT NORMAL SO SO THEY MAY CHARGE MORE OR LIKE YEAH YEAH
BECAUSE EVEN IN WHEN I WAS WORKING IN UH LIKE IN EDINBURGH LIKE ONE GUY
HE USE I HE GOT SOME PROBLEM WITH HANDS AND THEN HE WAS ALWAYS USING THIS N UH DICTATION EVEN HE USED TO WRITE LOT OF C. PLUS PLUS CODE WITH THE DICTATION LIKE
LIKE YOU HOW TO SAY ALL THE CALLINGS AND THIS THING SYSTEM HOW T BUT IT'S REALLY FUNNY LIKE
HE IS ABLE TO USE IT FOR LIKE LIKE YEARS I MEAN HE USED TO WRITE A LOT OF CODE AND YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY GREAT
READ THE LIKE
HOW YOU CALL THE FESTIVAL SO YOU CAN JUST GIVE THE FULL THERE IS AN TOO
IF IF YOU WANT TO LIKE READ FULL TEXT THEN YOU CAN SAY LIKE THE FULL TEXT
YEAH IT'S REAL IT'S YEAH
UH FESTIVAL IS GOOD LIKE NOW IT COMES AT ALL THE LINUX BOXES ALSO SO IN SO ALREADY IN THIS
NO THE THERE ARE SO MANY VOICES LIKE AGAIN
NO MOST OF THE THE FESTIVAL UH WHAT YOU GET ON LINUX MACHINES IS DIPHONE BASED ONLY
YEAH THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THAT THA IN VIEWS THIS UNIT SELECTION
UH THOSE VOICES THEY'RE NOT YET RELEASED
SO MAYBE YOU CAN JUST CHECK NO I IT'S IT'S HERE ON THE WEB THEN IT WON'T COME WITH YOUR LINUX SOFTWARE
SO YOU HAVE TO AGAIN DOWNLOAD FROM UH THEIR WEB PAGE
IT THE VOICES ARE CALLED MULTISYN MULTISYN UH SL UH THAT'S SOME VOICE
IT WAS REALLY LARGE DATABASE SO IT THE VOI THE QUALITY WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND SIMILAR YEAH
SO THIS IS AGAIN LIKE UH THAT'S KIND OF MY P. H. D. WORK HOW IN THIS SYSTEM LIKE HOW YOU CHOOSE THE UNITS AND HOW YOU CONCATENATE
TH YOU CAN JUST CHECK MULTISYN AND THEN VOICES
UH YEAH YEAH IT'S REALLY GOOD
BUT THOSE THINGS YOU CAN ADD LIKE IF YOU'RE REALLY FAMILIAR WITH FESTIVAL SO YOU CAN ADD ALWAYS THESE
UH F OH UH THIS MA THIS JOHANN WATERS OR LIKE NO THEY D WHAT THEY DID PORTLAND O. G. I. THEY DID L. P. C. BASED SYNTHESIS
THE FESTIVAL IS ALREA ALREADY LIKE IT'S ONE FIRST YOU START WITH TH
AH OKAY
AH OKAY OKAY
YEAH FIRST THEY STARTED IN C. S. T. R. WITH ALAN BLACK AND PAUL TAYLOR THEN THEN IT EXPAND TO MANY PLACES
BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY IS FIL NO SIMON KING IS HE'S ONE OF THE OTHERS BUT ROB CLARK IS THE MAN THAT YOU MET UM
YEAH WE MET IN ALSO IN I. C. S. L. P. RIGHT
WHEN IN COMPARED TO TO TH THE OTHERS THE PREVIOUS ONE
HE'S THE THE INVENTOR OF THAT IMPLANT AND FOR FOR THE EAR I THINK
S YEAH
SO YOU WENT TO A BEACH
TO A LIKE ATLANTIC SEA COAST OR YEAH
UH IT'S NOT SO FAR FROM LISBON HALF AN HOUR MM-HMM
THOSE NEW ONLY RIGHT
AH IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE IT MAYBE
SOME TIME YES BUT NOT SO MANY DAYS OR
BETTER TO TA
IS IT THERE
OR L. D. A. IS THERE OR
UH NO THERE THERE IS NOT
OH SO THAT'S INTERESTING
WH WHAT IS THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM
LIKE UM NO HOW MANY FRAMES PER PER SECOND YOU DO HAVE
IS IT AGAIN LIKE UH ONE HUNDRED FRAMES OR IT'S LESS OR EVEN IF YOU KEEP VARIABLE LENGTH OF THE FRAMES RIGHT
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THIS WOULD HAVE SENSE FOR I DON'T KNOW SPEECH CODING WHERE YOU WANT TO PRESERVE UH OR YOU WANT TO ENCODE IT INTO LESS FRAMES
YEAH NO WHA WHY TO KEEP VARIABL VARIABILITY IN THE LENGTH OF THE FRAMES
THERE IS NO INFORMATION
HE'S FRENCH UM SOMEWHERE NOW IN TELECONFERENCE LIKE MM I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S WORKING BUT TH WE WERE USING IT FOR UH SPEECH CODING
AND THEN YOU CAN MORE OR LESS UH QUANTISE THOSE SEGMENTS SOMEHOW AND USE IT FOR ENCODING LET'S SAY OR AND IT WORKED PRETT YEAH YEAH
OH WELL IT'S IT HAS BEEN USED FOR SPEECH CODING
THEY SHOW IT WORKS FOR TIMIT BUT THEN YOU TRY TO USE SOME DIFFERENT DATABASES YOU SEE IT DOESN'T WORK
YEAH BUT NOBODY YOU KNOW IT'S THOSE NEW SYSTEMS ARE STILL NOT GENERAL LIKE YOU KNOW
LIKE THOSE P. L. P. AND M. F. C. C. S BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT DI IT WORKED SOMEHOW RIGHT FOR ANY KIND OF DATA
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE COMPARING TO TO THAT SO
ONCE SOMEBODY WILL COME WITH SOMETHING NEW OKAY HE HE'S SHOWING IT WORKS FOR SOME DATAS BUT STILL YEAH YEAH
FIRST IT'S DIFFICULT TO TO SHOW THAT IT WORKS FOR ALL ALL THE DATAS RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY AND
RI I
FOR O. G. I. S
WELL TH THOSE F RECOGNISERS ARE ARE MADE THERE OR JUST YOU JUST USE THEM THAT'S IT
SHE EVEN IS F IT WAS FORBIDDEN IN THE TIME RIGHT SO YOU HAVE RECOGNISER JUST USE IT
RI RIGHT
WE ARE USING THOSE RESULTS MORE OR LESS
WELL MANY PEOPLE PLACE WITH TANDEM RIGHT LIKE M. I. T. OR WHO IS USING THAT SOME NOT M. I. T. BUT SOMEBODY
THERE IS IT'S A RESEARCH GROUP OF I KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S ICSI
SOMEBODY ELSE OR I DON'T KNOW SOMEBODY NEW UH S BUT I THINK SOME T SOMEBODY LIKE A. T. AND A. T. AND T. OR WHAT
YOU ME I DON'T KNOW HE'S EVEN IF QUALCOMM
NOW Y OH YEAH YEAH
I THINK IT'S THERE BUT MORE OR LESS IT'S AGAIN BASED ON M. F. C. C. S OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
EVEN ON THE PHONE
N SOME NEW ONE OR
AND BUT WHICH UH PHONE IT IS
WHERE UH SOME BUT SOME WHICH YOU CAN BUY RIGHT
IT AND YOU CAN TRAIN IT LIKE ONLY YOUR SPEECH OR IT'S GENERAL UH IT'S QUITE INTERESTING YEAH
OR YOU YOU CAN JUST BUY THAT APPLICATION RIGHT
S I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS DONE NOW BUT LIKE
THOSE UH THERE WERE MANY OF THEM
ANY TEXT YOU JUST PUT IN AND
ANYWAY WHO IS THE AUTHOR OF FESTIVAL
AND I THOUGHT IT THAT'S THE GUY FROM C. S. L. U. FROM PORTLAND WHO WAS THERE DURING F
LIKE HE CANNOT HAVE HE JUST CAN SPEAK ONLY THROUGH SOME FESTIVAL SYSTEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
HE WAS THE AUTH NO YEAH H HE WAS WORKING I THINK IN W O. G. I. EVEN
HE'S VERY FAMOUS BUT I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS THE AUTHOR NO
LIKE IT'S NOT T TEXT TO SPEECH IT'S JUST THE UH UH SYNTHESIS WHICH MEANS WHICH IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME BUT I DUNNO
NO OTHER PAPERS IT'S JUST ONE PAPER AND AND FESTIVAL
I I WISH YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE ROOM WOULD JUST DETECT WHEN AN WHEN A MEETING'S STARTED IT STARTING
UM Y MAYBE SHOW US THE GENERAL SORT OF OUTLINE
YOU KEEP W OKAY YOU CAN JUST WRITE IT ON THE PAPER
SO IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL P. L. P. TWO STUFF THEN IS THAT
H HE'S PARAMETERIZING IT BOTH TEMPORALLY AND ACROSS THE SPECTRUM YEP
YEAH TO THAT
OOH UH
W
WHAT SO WHAT SORT OF BIT RATE DO YOU GET FOR THE UM ENCODING OF THE THIS THE HILBERT TRANSFORM
THE S THE SPECTROGRAM
W WHAT SORT OF CODING DO YOU GET SO FAR FOR THE NO NO NO NO F F YEAH
UH WO WELL IT'S NO NO NO BUT WHAT SORT OF BIT RATE DO YOU GET
IS IT IS IT UH ID DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF M IDEA OF WHAT SORT OF BAND WIDTHS
OKAY AND THAT'S IN THAT'S WITH THE FULLY OPTIMISED SORT OF COMPRESSION SCHEME OR THAT'S JUST THE RAW DATA OR
T SO THAT'S ONE POINT OKAY THAT'S WITH THE FULL SPECTRUM BASICALLY BEING USED THEN
AND THAT'S WITHOUT DOING ANY SORT OF UM PREDICTION OF WHAT THE MISSING BANDS MIGHT BE RIGHT
WELL AT DIFFERENT BIT RATES
UH
M
TWEN THAT'S T IT'S TWENTY TIMES FIFTEEN IT'S NOT
F AND JUST USE BASIC L. P. C. TEN STYLE
I S I SAW THAT THEY USED MATRIX QUANTISATION ON THE L. P. UH ON THE L. S. F. PARAMETERS OR WHATEVER
OR BASED AROUND THAT
YOU CAN USE LIKE UH A CODEC SIDED OR YOU COULD USE A
YOU'RE GONNA GET H LOT HIGHER BAND WIDTH AREN'T YOU
YOU KNOW INVERSE FILTERING FOR UM SIGNAL RECONSTRUCTION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT CAN YOU
UH OH OKAY AND THEN YOU JUST THEN YOU JUST DO THE INVERSE F. F. T. OR WHATEVER
OKAY THE OTH I MEAN THE OTHER O
YES BUT I MEAN YOU CAN RECONSTRUCT THE THE F THE TH THE ENTIRE
LIKE IF Y YOU BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS SINUSOIDAL CODING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YE
D IT'S TH
IF IF YOU'RE MM IF I IF THE IF THE EXCI IF THE IF THE ENCODING RATE'S TWO KILO BITS PER SECOND FOR THE THE EXCITATION COMPONENT OF THE SIGNAL
IN STANDARDS AND YEAH
IS IT NOKIA'S BEING SUED IN THE U. S. FOR THEIR TRI BAND USAGE 'CAUSE YOU KNOW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
UH NO NO G G. S. M. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE G. S. M. IN THE U. S.
UH IT'S F UH OKAY
NO NO N
UH WELL THAT'S TRI BAND S YEAH
BUT I MEAN CODING IS A MUCH MORE SORT OF IT'S IT'S IT WELL I MEAN IT'S IT'S UH IT WHEN IT BOILS DOWN TO JUST MATHEMATICS TO A LARGE EXTENT
IT'S IT'S JUST UH SORT OF IT'S YOU KNOW COMMUNICATIONS S SORT OF NO
AND I MEAN AS YOU SAY I MEAN THAT DELAY IS I MEAN YOU CAN SQUASH THAT DELAY TO SOME EXTENT RIGHT
I N I THINK AS FAR AS THE CO YOU KNOW C C DELILAH'S CODING GOES
IF YOU ADD THOSE TOGETHER YOU END UP WITH A THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO I GUESS
YEAH M YEAH TR YEAH IT'S A YEAH
BUT I MEAN THE TH THE THE THING IS YOU'D NEED TI IT PART OF THE PARAMETER SET FOR THAT IS UH THE UM UH THE F UH THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDES
I M H UH HE WAS JUST USING THE FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY
AND EVERYTHING ELSE CAN BE YEAH S YEAH SURE
SO AND THEN BUT THEN THE TRICKY THE ONLY TRICKY THING THAT WE HADN'T FIGURED OUT WAS THE PHASE INFORMATION
UM BUT Y BUT UH YOU CAN STILL GET A LIKE YOU GET TH UM BASICALLY IF YOU DO PHASE UNWRAPPING AND ALL OF THESE OTHER TRICKS
SO I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD CONCEIVABLY REPRESENT IN SOME SORT OF LOW SORT OF R YOU KNOW LOW BIT RATE REPRESENTATION I GUESS
AND THEN MAYBE YOU'D NEED SOME SORT OF CORRECTION TO UM TO CORRECT MINOR PHASE DISCONTINUITIES AT SOME POINT IN TIME
NO AND YOU UH YOU WANNA AVOID HARD CHOICES ON VOICING DECISION YEAH
BUT BUT THAT THAT TWO HUNDRED THIS IS WHAT THEY USE FOR LIKE UM ST THEY THEY DO USE THIS FOR UM FOR UM PITCH MARKING IN SPEECH
DEPENDING ON THE PITCH DEPENDING ON THE PERSON Y YOU'LL GET A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF SMOOTHING AND A CERTAIN SORT OF SO I MEAN
UH N NO
I MEAN MAYBE IF YOU DID SOME SORT OF INITIAL FIRST P GUESS AND THEN AND THEN CHOSE YOUR SMOOTHING FACTOR BASED ON THAT
'CAUSE IT IT YOU KNOW SELECTING AT ANY PARTICULAR POINT OF WHAT THE WHAT THE PITCH IS AT THE MAY BE INACCURATE
THIS CARRIER SIGNAL WHAT WHAT IT REALLY LOOKS L YEAH
C 'CAUSE ANY SORT OF ERROR IN THAT IN THAT LINE IS IS TRANSMITTED IS REALISED IN A NET AS A PHASE ERROR RIGHT
Y Y Y YOU HAVE S FIVE SLICES LIKE N ACROSS THAT WAY I GUESS
UM AND I MEAN UH AND AND IN IN FACT I MEAN IT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS SO DIFFERENT TO MOST APPROACHES TO SPEECH CODING THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT OR HAVEN'T HAD MUCH I IT'S I MEAN IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT TO A LOT OF THE TRADITIONAL SORT UH SO UH VOI UM YOU KNOW
UNVOICED UNVOICED SPEECH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO B SORT OF JUDGE ON QUALITY COMPARED TO VOICED I THINK
WELL I SUPPOSE HAVE TO WAIT TO YOUR I GUESS
OH IT'S A LITTLE WA OH BUGGER
THE THE THE THE UM THE SOURCE FILTER TYPE PARAMETERS AND THEN AND THEN LEARNING THE YOU KNOW TRAINING LIKE A H SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM
BUT UM I MEAN I THINK I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH THE ANALYSIS BY SYNTHESIS BUT THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW WHAT SORT OF BIT RATES YOU'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE OR UM AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DO IT SEPARATELY FOR EACH UM BAND
AND AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE AT SORT OF A POINT WHERE MAYBE YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE A LITTLE BIT
BUT IT'S GOTTA FIT INSIDE THIS THIS SORT OF THIS SORT OF FORMAT
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE V AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DO M. O. S. UM TESTING AND
WELL HO IT
UH NO NO NO
LIKE YOU KNOW NEW LIKE HIGHER BAND WIDTH TRANSMISSION OR UH OR LIKE PACKET PACKETIZED BASED TRANSMISSION
AND THEN ALL TH THAT SORT OF THING
THE WHERE TH WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT SO MUCH LOOKING AT THE ALGORITHM
BUT SO MUCH AS HOW TO INCORPORATE THE ALGORITHM WITHIN A NEW TRANSI MISSION SORT OF S MEDIUM
BASICALLY S LIKE I MEAN IF YOU D IF YOU SEE A LOT OF PAPERS ON LIKE UM ON UH VOICE OVER I. P. OR WHATEVER
BUT EVEN THAT'S LESS OF A BIG DEAL NOW RIGHT BECAUSE ALL THE LITTLE UM I. S YEAH
BUT IT WAS PRETTY HARD TO TELL THAT IT WAS M NOT NOT PERFECT UNLESS YOU HEARD THE SAMPLES SORT OF NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER
WELL TH
I'VE GOT NO IDEA
NO THE MUCH MORE MATHEMATICAL I THINK
YEAH JUST BASICALLY DOING A SEARCH THROUGH OR OR STUFF STUFF LIKE THAT DON'T THEY
BUT TH I THINK I THINK THE I THINK IT WAS TO WAS IT TO DO WITH AURORA OR SOMETHING
THEY WANNA DISPUTE THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SAID BY THE RECOGNITION
HEY VOILA IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU UH UH I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT THAN THAT
OH NO THAT THERE'S A SEPARATE SET OF STANDARDS I THINK FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
WHICH UH I THINK REQUIRES YOU KNOW THAT STATES THE UN THE INFORMATION THEY CAN SEND IS THIS
SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU TACK ON ANY EXTRA PHASE INFORMATION OR WHATEVER
YOU I MEAN MAYBE THAT'S THE BEST APPROACH TO LOOK AT TO BEGIN WITH IS JUST PRETEND ALL YOU HAVE GOT IS
THE PITCH ISN'T THAT BIG A DEAL
I MEAN IT'S WORTH GIVING IT A GO AND THEN MEN MAYBE SEEING WH WHAT INFORMATION YOU CAN ADD TO THE DATA STREAM TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE
MM I THINK W
AH WELL I MEAN HUFFMAN'S EASY ENOUGH
I MEAN I I TH I THINK THEY DO TRY TO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE THE THE TECHNIQUES THEY THEY CHOOSE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LESS
YEAH AT LEAST ON PAPER
UH IS SOME KIND OF D. C. T. OR AGAIN YEAH
YEAH UH OH OKAY
AH OKAY
S
S
S SO
AH
SO AFTER YOU'RE DOING L. S. F. S SO OR LIKE I MEAN HOW YOU'RE FINALLY HAND CODING
AH
SO FIRST YOU APPLY THESE TRIANGLE FILTERS AND THEN DO L. P. C. CODING OR LIKE
YEAH M YEAH OK
AH
UH NO TH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH IS NOISE
OH THAT TWO TWO KILO BITS PER T
AH
BUT THIS IS CODEC CENTRED NO
OH IT'S NOT CODECS CODE BOOK
OH OK
YEAH THAT'S A I THINK EVEN G. S. M. AND ALL THIS G. SEVEN TWO NINE
ON BASED ON CELP
AH OKAY
OH OK
LIKE THE YEAH BECAUSE I WORKED IN A INDUSTRY FOR LIKE A SMALL TIME
BUT THEY'RE THEY USED TO IMPLEMENT ALL THESE CODERS G. S. M. AND I. T. U. STANDARDS
NO NO BUT C. D. M. IS THERE BUT NOW SLOWLY THEY'RE INTRODUCING G. S. M. ALSO NOW IN U. S. LIKE
AH
IN C. D. M. A. OR G. S. M.
THE THEY THEY ARE C DOING ONLY
BUT YOU KNOW REALLY THE THESE LONG LINE TELEPHONES THEY ALREADY HAVE DELAY NO
AH
BUT YOU DON'T DO ANY VOICE UN VOICE DECISION NO
YEAH THE THAT'S EVEN ADVANTAGE I THINK FOR THIS APPROACH
S
SO THAT'S A YOU HAVE TO TUNE LOT OF PARAMETERS LIKE I AM
BUT ANYWAY YOU DON'T REALLY NEED HARD DECISIONS NO
SO M MAYBE IT MAY HELP YOU BUT IT YEAH
BUT DO YOU REALLY REALLY NEED IT OR LIKE VOICED UNVOICED
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY YOU NEED T YOU DON'T NEED TO SPECIFY AT EACH POINT IT'S VOICED OR YEAH
S YEAH
THAT'S WHAT MARIUS DID NO LIKE
NO BUT EVEN THE HIS CODED LIKE HE JUST HE HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING HE JUST TRANSFERRED IT THAT WAY
HE WAS AIMING FOR HE'S NOT REALLY KIND OF DOING SPEECH CODING BUT HE WANT TO DO IT ON MUSIC
SO HE DOESN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE BAND WIDTHS OR HE WANT TO HAVE THE QUALITY NO LIKE
TWENTY KILO BITS ALSO IS OKAY
BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST DOING ON UH YOUR UH YEAH
BUT EVEN YOU CAN USE AS A CAN YOU USE THAT PHASE DIRECTLY
WHEREAS THE D YEAH THIS ONE IS DIRECT
OF YOUR SIGNAL
MAGNITUDE OF UH NO BEFORE D. C. T. YOUR D OH
AH
AH
YEAH MAYBE THE THEN
AH OKAY
YEAH IT'S IN FREQUENCY DOMAIN NO
UH
OH YOU
UH
BUT IT'S MOSTLY LIKE THIS IS UH S CELP AND THESE THING
NO I WAS T UH DOING SOME UH LIKE WRITING SOME CODE FOR TESTING AND THESE THINGS WHERE I'M MAKING SOME T STANDARDS FOR THAT
SO SO TH TH THERE ARE LIKE LI THE THING THESE STANDARDS
HOW IT WORKS IS LIKE THEY GIVE ALL THE PSEUDO CODE KIND OF THING AND THEN THEY PUT SEVERE TEST CONDITIONS
LIKE THEN J YOU CAN SAY OKAY WE IMPLEMENTED D. SEVENTY EIGHT OR D. SE
YOU ARE T YOU CAN'T REALLY DO IT ON WHATEVER DATABASE YOU HAVE
THEY'RE ALSO THEY DEFINE ALL THIS THE SPEECH CONDITION
SO YOU NEED TO FOLLOW ALL THOSE
YEAH I THINK THERE ISN'T ONLY SE MOST YEAH
AH
CELP IS FROM UH A. T. AND T. NO
IT THE ALL THIS L. P. C. STUFF IS
AH OKAY
UH YEAH
SO THEY'RE TO PUT ALL THESE THINGS ON AGAIN D. S. P. S
AND ALSO IT'S MOSTLY LIKE HOW TO HOW MANY L. P. C. S ARE YEAH HOW MANY CO YEAH IT'S OPTIMATION AND THEN IT'S EVEN
SO EVEN I THINK UH THEN YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER BAND WIDTH IS
BUT ONLY TH YEAH YEAH
YEAH IT'S REALLY BUT UH HOW MUCH YOU CAN GET THE COMPRESS THESE LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TELLING IS YOU CAN DO ALL THESE TRICKS LIKE
YEAH THESE YEAH
IN YEAH
WELL YEAH I READ UH I REVIEWED ONE PAPER LIKE YEAH THE THAT'S THAT'S FROM NO
YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK AT DATES FROM UH YOU KNOW EAST OF UH EAST UH YEAH EAST ANGLIA
NO NO THE THOSE THINGS ARE AGAIN BASED ON L. P. C. NO
YEAH AGAIN LIKE UH NO THE PROBLEM IS DIFFERENT FOR EVERYBODY
LIKE THESE GUYS WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR DISTRIBUTOR SPEECH RECOGNITION MAINLY THIS UH SO
UH YEAH M. F. C. C. S
NO IT'S E. T. S. A. OR SOMETHING
EUROPEAN STANDARD YEAH HYNEK REALLY N YEAH EVEN IT'S H KIND OF AURORA FRAMEWORK
NO BUT NOW IT'S BIT
E. UH E. T. S. A. I. YEAH
M YEAH
BUT THE QUALITY AGAIN PROBLEM NO LIKE
BUT IF HAVE M. F. C. C. S THEN LIKE AGAIN YOU HAVE TO GET THE HIGH ORDER M. F. C. C. S AND THEN YEAH THEN YOU'RE HAVE TO
BUT I THINK AGAIN IT'S DIFFERENT NO
MAYBE THEY HAVE THE COMPRESSION STANDARDS AND AGAIN CODING STAND BUT MAYBE UH I I READ AH YEAH
NO SO I THOUGHT THAT WE MIGHT S T SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SPEECH CODING BECAUSE NOBODY IS DOING HERE SPEECH CODING AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME MAYBE FEEDBACK BECAUSE EXCEPT ME
BUT OF COURSE THERE IS THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS WHICH WE STILL DIDN'T SOLVE AND THE BIGGEST ONE IS QUITE SIMILAR TO L. P. C. STUFF WHERE PEOPLE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXACTLY ENCODE A CARRIER OR THE SOURCE SIGNAL
OH YOU MEAN THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO PLOT AT LEAST S
WHAT WE ARE UH WE MIGHT SEE IT UH IN VERY SIMPLE WAY THAT WE ARE USING SOME HILBERT TRANSFORM H AT THE BEGINNING TO CREATE ANALYTIC SIGNAL
AND IF YOU GET IF YOU APPLY HILBERT TRANSFORM ON THIS ON SUCH A SPEECH SIGNAL LIKE A REAL TRAJECTORY
THEN YOU GET A COMPLEX SIGNAL AND IF YOU TAKE JUST THE AMPLITUDE THEN YOU GET HILBERT ENVELOPE CODE
SO I WELL I I DON'T KNOW
YEAH IT'S U IT'S NOT P. L. P. AT ALL D
UH YOU'RE LIT I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN WITH THE PU P. L. P.
LET'S SAY YOU ARE DOING UH FOR EVERY TWENTY MILLISECOND PROCESSING ONE ONE FEATURE VECTOR
SO IT'S DIFFERENT DIRECTION WHICH WE ARE W USING
SO APPLYING THAT UH ABSOLUTE UH ABSOLUTE OPERATION YOU GET A HILBERT ENVELOPE
SO NOW WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW IS HOW TO APPROXIMATE THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE
BUT IT'S UH RIGHT IT'S IN A IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENCE IN NOT APPLIED IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN
SO AGAIN WE KNOW WHAT TO MORE OR LESS WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE HILBERT ENVELOPE
BUT I IF YOU WANT TO REALLY CONSTRUCT THE SPEECH SIGNAL OR THE YOU NEED ALSO THE PHASE SIGNAL
WHICH IS IN UH SOME SENSE QUITE SIMPLE FOR VOICED SPEECH SIGNAL SAY
BUT S UH THE PHASE NO YOU AC IT'S A PHASE OR YOU CAN ENCODE IT LIKE A CARRIER
YOU MAY SEE SOMETHING LIKE THERE IS ONE COSINE WHICH IS UH VERY WOULD HAVE QUITE A F RIGHT
SO THE THIS IS THE SIGNAL WHICH YOU ALSO HAVE TO SOMEHOW ENCODE OR TRANSMIT FROM A CODE OF THE DECODER IN ORDER TO RE SYNTHESIZE IT RIGHT
I MEAN OH OKAY W WELL IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT IN MORE DETAILS I MEAN
OH YOU MEAN UH YEAH BIT BIT RATE YOU MEAN
SO WHEREAS WE ARE WHAT WE ARE NOW IS LET'S SAY SOMETHING LIKE ONE POINT TWO KILO BITS PER SECOND FOR UH THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE
IS
BUT THEY ARE FIRST THEY ARE INTER OH WELL INTEGRATED INTO FIFTEEN BANDS USING OH CLASSICAL WAY LIKE IN M. F. C. C. S OR IN P. L. P.
YOU JUST APPLY SOME THOSE UH TRIANGULAR WINDOWS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN ORDER TO TO GET A LI REALLY LIKE JUST FIFTEEN BANDS RIGHT
SO FOR ONE BAND WE MORE OR LESS HAVE W LIKE W ONE HUNDRED BITS PER SECOND
YOU YEAH YOU CAN JUST RIGHT
UH RIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE DID
THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE WOULD WOULDN'T AT ALL
BUT NOW WHAT I R REALLY TRYING TO DO IS SOMEHOW APPROXIMATE THAT UH CARRIER SIGNAL TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE CARRIER
YOU MEAN SOMETHING LIKE UH F UH THAT CELP CODING SYSTEM WHERE YOU'RE OR WH WH WH WHAT IS NO WHAT IS EXACTLY SCALABLE SYSTEM
YEAH OR MEL MEL SCALE SO IT'S UH IT'S BEING UH MORE WIDER FOR HIGHER FREQUENCIES AND OF COURSE THE S THE SPACES RIGHT
BUT WHAT I W MY SENSE IS THAT IT IS NOT SO MUCH IMPORTANT STILL
I MEAN IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE ALS USE MEL SCALE OR BAR SCALE
UH ACTUALLY WE ARE USING JUST GAUSSIAN WINDOWS HERE INSTEAD OF THOSE TRIANGULARS BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE UH NO
THEY ARE THEY ARE APPROACHING OR IN THEY ARE IN ZERO
SO D YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT SOME ZERO VALUES HERE AND BUT MORE OR LESS IT DOESN'T MATTER YEAH
SO YOU HAVE L. P. C. COEFFICIENTS WHICH YOU CAN TRANSCRIBE INTO L. L. L. S. F. S WHICH ARE RIGHT EXACTLY
AND THEN I SO YOU SPLIT IT IN TWO FREQUENCY SUB BANDS
AND THEN EACH ONE F FREQUENCY SUB BAND IS MORE OR LESS UH
YOU JUST APPLY L. L. P. SO AUTO CORRELATION LET'S SAY OR YOU CAN DO POWER SPECTRUM WHATEVER
YEAH SO YOU FOR EACH ONE YOU GET L. S. F. S HERE
IF I JUST KEEP ALL THEM SO TWENTY L. S. F. S EACH ONE IS UM
OR NO OF COURSE WE DID
SO YOU CAN REALLY USE T LIKE IN UH L. P. C. SYSTEM
IT MI IT MI YEAH
R RIGHT
SO THERE IN THE THERE IS I THINK TWO POINT FOUR KILO BITS PER SECOND THE BIT RATE FOR THAT
THIS IS NO UH I MEAN L. P. C. TEN IS JUST L. P. C.
SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK ON THAT SPECTRUM OF THAT OF THAT CARRIER SIGNAL
RIGHT SO IT'S TH THE FREQUENCY STILL TO BE CHANGING
SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE FOR A ONE SECOND SIGNAL YOU M MORE OR LESS YOU ALREADY MIGHT SEE SOME LIKE ONE
ONE UH IMPULSE THERE OR SPECTRAL LINE FOR
BUT USUALLY THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHICH ARE S QUITE SMALL BUT THEY ARE QUITE IMPORTANT
THE SIGNAL IS AUDIBLE
OR IF YOU'RE ADJUST UH TH FIND ONE ONE LINE
ONE SPEAKER AND DOM DOM DOMINANT ONE IN THE SPECTRUM OF THAT C UH CARRIER HIL HILBERT CARRIER AND YOU JUST TRANSMIT THIS PARAMETER
NO N
SO SO YOU JUST MULTIPLY THAT UH ONE HILBERT CARRIER WHICH IS TRANSCRIBED BY L. S. F. S BY THAT THIS ONE I. F. F. T. SIGNAL
OH F YOU MEAN THE PHASE OF THAT UH OF THAT CARRIER
AND UH I FOUND THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH WHICH WHAT IS THE PHASE BECAUSE WE ARE USING JUST ONE SECOND WINDOW RIGHT
LIKE GREAT KEEP THE PHASE ZERO AND IT WORKS
BUT YOU CAN ALSO GET THE S SHORT TIME FOURIER TRANSFORM UH AND KEEP IT RIGHT
JUST CLASSICAL UH FRAME BY FRAME ALGORITHM TWENTY MILLISECONDS
SO UM HMM M MAYBE IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU T IF YOU TELL US UH WHAT YOU DO WITH THE SPEECH CODING 'CAUSE I D I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF P. H. D. S OF YOU
SO IF YOU DID SOMETHING SO MAYBE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING AT LEAST TO
YOU MEAN USING THAT UH C. D. M. A.
RIGHT IT'S UH KIND OF S NO C. D. M. A. IS UH ANOTHER LEVEL I THINK
I THINK THERE IS A L LOT OF MONEY IN THAT LIKE RIGHT
LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION OF COURSE IT'S VERY INTERESTING BUT PEOPLE DON'T USE IT SO MUCH AS S JUST CODING JUST TELEPHONING RIGHT OR JUST
WELL WHAT WE WERE WHAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT IS OH C. D. M. A. I MEAN THERE IS THE B
WELL THE PROBLEM IS THIS IN WITH THIS APPLICATION
WHAT IF S
WHICH ONE S OH
BUT THE SINUSOIDAL CODING IS USUALLY M WHEN YOU S AT LEAST WHAT I THINK OR UH WHAT I KNOW IS WHEN YOU ARE DOING SINUSOIDAL CODING IT MEANS YOU JUST TAKE THE SPEECH SIGNAL AT THE BEGINNING
AND YOU ARE TRYING TO FIND TO UH YEAH TO FIND THE HARMONICS IN A TEMPORAL DOMAIN RIGHT FOR THAT
BUT TH
BUT YOU KNOW THE THE F THE INTERESTING
AND FOR EXAMPLE WHAT I FOUND I WELL IN THIS CASE UH WE ARE NOT TRYING TO ENCODE THE SPEECH SIGNAL
WE ARE TRYING TO ENCODE SOME CARRIER WHICH IS MUCH EASIER I WOULD SAY BECAUSE YOU CAN REALLY IM YOU CAN SEE THAT EVEN
OR WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO THEN YOU HAVE TO DECREASE THE THE THE SIZE OF NOT ONE SECOND
NOT NOW NO
I WI
THAT THAT ONE WHICH IS TRYING TO APPROXIMATE THAT ENERGY IN SOME LOW BAND
ON THE TRAJECTORY YOU CAN SEE THAT IT WORKS LIKE KIND OF UM VOICE DETECTOR
MAYBE IF YOU WE UH REALLY WANT TO IMPROVE THE THE QUALITY THEN WE WILL NEED IT I DON'T KNOW STILL
N NOT NOW
YEAH UH WELL I'M GONNA T HAVE A TIME NEXT NEXT MONTH OR IN THREE WEEKS SO I'LL TRY TO PLAY SOME EXAMPLES THERE FOR YOU AND
HOW DOES IT LOOK LIKE OR SURE
YEAH WE YEAH YEAH YEAH EXACTLY
BUT ANYWAY WHAT ALSO THE OTHER APPROACH WHICH IS POSSIBLE TO USE
THE OTHER IS ONE TO KEEP THE PHASE LIKE THIS ONE LIKE TWO SPECTROGRAMS ONE THE PHASE AND ONE THE MAGNITUDE
QUITE WHAT UH NO WHAT UH HE WAS DOING HE WAS USING IT FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
M MAYBE
UH THE PHASE OR YOU JUST UH RE CAN AGAIN THE PHASE CAN BE REPLACED BY THE NOISE WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD
OF COURSE THEN IT DOESN'T SOUND AS THE ORIGINAL BECAUSE IT'S MORE WHISPERED OR WHATEVER
OF UNWRAP PHASE RECRE UH I ALSO USE BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT HERE WHEN YOU GET INTO UH THIS DOMAIN WHERE YOU APPLY UH OR YOU'RE TRYING TO COMPUTE UH S POWER SPECTRUM IN IN ORDER T LET'S SAY THAT THIS KIND OF TRAJECTORY
THEN APPLYING UH POWER IN ORDER TO GET UM TO S TO POWER DOMAIN AND THEN I. F. F. T. RIGHT
SO YOU MIGHT SEE IT'S IS MORE LESS LIKE A LINE
I THINK THIS IS IN FREQUENCY DOMAIN THIS IN TIME DOMAIN
RE WELL YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
BUT YOU CAN HERE THAT THERE ARE MANY ARTIFACTS WHICH RIGHT EXACTLY
SO YOU CANNOT SAY THAT THIS PART WILL BE THE JUST THE NOISE WHICH YOU CAN DO IN HERE IN THIS THIS OTHER APPROACH
SO THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T PLAY WITH THAT SO M MORE BECAUSE I FOUND THERE ARE MORE UH DISADVANTAGES THAN THE ADVANTAGES THIS APPROACH
IT'S THE PHASE NO YOU CAN AGAIN PUT THE THAT ENVELOPE WITH THIS PHASE TOGETHER BECAUSE ENVELOPE IS TWE
YOU G NO YOU GET THE F
NO AFTER D. C. T. YOU ARE TRYING THIS IS SO KIND OF AGAIN A REAL TRAJECTORY RIGHT
NO BUT HERE WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS REALLY THAT Y IT'S NOT PART OF HILBERT ENVELOPE IT'S PART OF THE D. C. T. SIGNAL
SO IT'S NOT IT'S ENOUGH IF YOU HAVE JUST THIS PHASE AND F AND THE HILBERT ENVELOPE YOU CAN PUT IT TOGETHER
SO I WHAT I THINK IS THAT WE ALREADY WILL NEED TO APPLY S KIND OF ANALYSIS BY SYNTHESIS APPROACH MM UH IN ORDER TO GET SOMETHING
YOU MEAN YE
SO YOU CAN WHEN I TRIED AND COMPARING WITH L. P. C. TEN ON A UH TWICE BIGGER OR HIGHER BIT RATE THIS WORK WORKS BETTER IT SEEMS TO ME
UH YEAH BUT UH WHEN YOU HEAR AND TRY TO USE SOME EXAMPLES WITH THE MUSIC FOR EXAMPLE
UH OKAY
NO I JUST SWAPPED IT WITH UH MIKE PERROT I THINK 'CAUSE H HE IS NOT GOING TO BE HERE THIS TIME
AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE IT IN UH IN JANUARY
BY
WELL TH MORE LESS THEY DON'T CARE WHAT'S UH WHAT WILL BE THE QUALITY OF THE OF THE OR THE BIT RATE
SO IF YOU GET THE V VERY UH LOW BIT RATE WITH A REASONABLE QUALITY OR REALLY HIGH BIT RATE
SO YOU KNOW ON ONE SIDE IT'S PRETTY GOOD BUT ON THE OTHER YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY YOU SHOULD GO 'CAUSE THERE ARE MANY OF THEM
W UH DO YOU WANT TO MENTION YOUR SPEECH CODING EXPERIMENTS
SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING I IN INDIA WITH UH
YEAH BUT IT'S QUITE INTERESTING WITH THE EVEN WITH TH UH S CURRENT SPEECH CODING UH TECHNOLOGIES
WE ARE THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO USE K ZAP OR THOSE R. P. BASED APPROACHES
AND IF I WHEN I WAS UH LISTENING THE UH THE TALK OF UH MILAN JELINEK UH HE'S THE CZECH GUY BUT HE LIVES IN UH IN CANADA
UM I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS EXACTLY BUT THEY GOT VERY VERY FAMOUS FOR THIS FOR THAT CELP
OR THEY JUST KEEP THOSE PATTERNS OR I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS EXACTLY
BUT UH WHEN I HEARD THOSE THAT PRESENTATION THEY DIDN'T DO SO MUCH NEW
I MEAN YOU KNOW NOT TO MAKE ANY ERRORS LIKE IN BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT
BUT THEN THEY ARE S STILL USING LIKE ERROR SIGNAL WHICH IS GOING TO BE APPROXIMATED BY CODE BOOK RIGHT
AND A LINEAR PREDICTION WHICH IS USE WHICH IS APPROXIMATING JUST THE SPECTRUM OF FOR FOR AND EVERYTHING THAT THAT'S THAT'S ALL
BECAUSE I I TRIED YOU KNOW THOSE TH THOSE PAPERS
BUT S I'M LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT IT
YOU KNOW M BUT THERE ARE SOME ALGORITHMS WHICH WERE QUITE UH
UH IT SEEMS TO ME YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT OF COURSE THEY ARE LI IT'S NOT ORIGINAL AT ALL
FOR N FOR AURORA WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THAT
YOU MEAN WITH THIS PHASE UH SURE
UH YEAH
R RIGHT RIGHT
I DON'T KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT S CHANNEL CODING LIKE THOSE HUFFMAN CODING STUFF AND YOU KNOW
H YEAH
END
IS THE SCALE LINEAR OR IS MEL SCALE LIKE IN M. F. C. C.
IS IT BAR SCALE LIKE IN LIKE IN SP YEAH OKAY
SO THIS IS CODING THEN S YOU CODE THE SPEECH THEN YOU'RE ALSO SUPPOSED TO TRANSMIT THE SPEECH RIGHT
TH LET'S SAY IN G. S. M. OR SOMETHING ELSE
UH
THEN TH THEY SOME YOU KNOW SOURCE
IS IT GOOD
SO WE I THINK WE ORGANISE UH JUST TO TO DISCUSS UH
A ABOUT UH CAPTURING UH AUDIO VIDEO AND SLIDE UH IN A SYNCHRONIZED WAY
UH I THINK OLIVIER PREPARED SOME SLIDES ABOUT UH REVIEWING UH
THE U. U. S. U. UH U. S. B. CORD DOESN'T WORK
AND YOU DIDN'T PUT ON THE
IF IT'S ON YOUR H.
OR IT'S ON UH YOUR D. MACHINE
SO MAYBE WE WI WE WILL BE ABLE TO
AND MAYB MAYBE YOU WE CAN DO THAT AT THE WHITE BOARD
PAS
PAS
FREE
AND THIS THE THREE OF THOSE ARE THE V THE THE VIDEO
AND THEY W THEY UH ALREADY WORKED ON UH A EUROPEAN PROJECT CALLED INDICO WHERE THEY THEY HAVE UH RELEASE
AH NO
EITHER JUST TO UH IN PARENTHESES UH WE DIDN'T CHOOSE THAT UM THAT SOLUTION BECAUSE THEY HAD NO UM THE THE SLIDES WERE NOT CAPTURED VERY UH IN A VERY UH PRECISE WAY
IS IT FULLY AUTOMATIC
BUT I I IT ALL SYNCHRONIZE AND I IS IT DOING ALL WHAT WE WANT BUT WITHOUT THE SLIDE UH PRECISION
AND WE ARE SU AND WE ARE SURE THAT IN THAT UH CONTEXT OF SMAC PROJECT WITH UH UM FRIBOURG WORKING ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS UH THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH PRECISION UN ENOUGH RESOLUTION IN THE SLIDES
TO C TO CAPTURE
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU THEY USE MORE OR LESS IN T. N. O. ALSO
BECAUSE THE SYNCHRONIZATION PROBLEM COMES FROM THE THE GRABBING FROM THE D. V. TAPE IN IN D IN D. VIX
AND H THERE FOUR HOURS THIRTY TWO MINUTES
NO THEY D YEAH YEAH YEAH I'M SURE
WELL IT'S MANUAL TO TO SYNCHRONIZE IT THE FRAME
NO NO BECAUSE UH WE DID THE SOFTWARE HERE AND IT THEY DIDN'T CHOO NO OUR UH SOFTWARE
IT TH WHEN Y UH YOU USE A SYSTEM UM HARDWARE
SO WE NEED UH WELL THIS IS WILL BE DONE TOGETHER T LIKE IN TO TO TRY TO DIVIDE THE TIME UH WHAT DO WE DO
I WAS THINKING UH FOR INSTANCE UH IN TH IN WHAT WE HAVE UM UH BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT UM USING UH LIKE UH D. L. L.
ABOUT UM FRAME GRABBING
SUP I SUPPOSE M. F. C. C. NO UH NOT M. F. C. C. BUT M. E M. F. C.
UM SO THIS IS ONE UH STEP
UM TESTING THE CARD WITH UH ONLY ONE AUDIO FOR INSTANCE AND THEN ONLY ONE VIDEO
AND E EVEN UH TESTING WITH ONLY THE SLIDES UH TO CAPTURE ALL THE UH LIKE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING THE THE S UH THE VIDEO S UH STREAM
THE FRAME
OR IS IT NO IT'S SYNCHRONIZED
AS YOU SAID UH WHAT NOT NOW BUT UH THE NEXT POINT WOULD BE TO USE THAT CARD WITH THE OTHER CARD AND TO MERGE THE SLIDE SIGNAL WITH THE
IT'S UH IT'S IT'S NOT A SYNCHRONIZATION SIGNAL IT'S A SLIDE WITH A T
AND IS IS IT EXTERNAL TO THIS CARD
SO UH T YEAH WE NEED TO DO SOME TESTS
HE WE DON'T KNOW YET WITH FRANK IF WE INSTALL THIS CARD MAYBE HERE
WELL ON MY MACHINE HIS MACHINE OR THIS MACHINE MAYBE
YEAH ALEXANDRE DID NOT CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE WAY UH YOU I NO NO NO BUT UH YOU ARE MORE IN RESEARCH
OKAY I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING THAT MM UH WELL WE'RE NOT D DOING DEADLINES
YE WELL WE WOULD LOOK BOTH AT
UH E H. F. E. S. DATABASE UH WITH J. FERRET UH
YEAH WE YEAH
FROM FRO FOR CHECKING DARREN'S CODE ET CETERA WE CAN EXPECT UNTIL UH
AND YEAH FOR O ONE MONTHS OR SO THEN UH THE UH THE I UH I. V. C. UH W WITH THE PEOPLE AT FRIBOURG HAVE UH YEAH
BUT UH WELL I I WANT THIS TO TO WORK IN THE FOR THE TIME UH IN THE MM-HMM
WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WE CANNOT WAIT UH WE WERE HERE ONE YEAR AGO UH I DON'T KNOW
FIFTY PERCENT ON ON I. M. TWO THAT'S IT
ON I. M. TWO I. P. ONE
OKAY MAYBE IN FIFTY PERCENT UH ON THAT
WHY THIS WAS YEAH MO YEAH W I DON'T WANT TO TALK TOO MUCH MAYBE
Y
W WELL THE LET'S SAY UH APRIL O. SIX AND UH WE DO UH OUR BEST WITH UH TRYING TO KEEP YOU INFORM WITH THE ADVANCEMENTS
UH
WELL I WOULD LIKE TO TO TO WORK ON P KIND OF PART TIME UH UH W O YEAH
MAYBE YOU WON'T LIKE MY ANSWER BUT I WOULD SAY THAT UM WE CH WE WE START BUT WE H WE REALLY HAVE TO START ON WORKING WI UH READING ALL THE CODE FROM DARREN
THEN THIS UM CARD WITH THE CODE I. V. C. CARD AND TO TO TRY THIS
THEN WE TRY A LITTLE BIT DIRECT SHOW TO SEE UM UH TO TO HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW HOW LONG UH THAT COULD BE
WELL W UH LET'S DO THAT
FO
TO
UH WI THAT WOULD BE DONE UH IN LIKE IN COMMON SOFTWARE THAT WE HAVE UH AFTERWARDS
OKAY TH AND THIS POINT IS ABOUT TESTING AND UH YEAH
OKAY OH YEAH YOU ARE YOU CANNOT OR O L UH BY DOING ONE ONE DAY A WEEK MM YOU KNOW JUST I THINK THE CARDS
UH AND UH AND FROM THERE IT WOULD M YEAH
I WOULD SAY UH LET'S LET'S YEAH LET'S TRY TO HAVE ONE UH STUDENTS UH TO HELP US ON THAT
BUT UH UH THE THE STUDENT SHOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT M. F. C. WITH OH OKAY
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE D WE HAVE TO TO STOP TALKING YET
SO THEY'RE ON MY THEY'RE ON A
THE SECOND ONE I IS YOUR SYSTEM
UH I WOULD TO SAY THE CHEAP MEETING ROOM SYSTEM
SHOULD I WRITE
WHICH IS UH I WOULD LIKE TO CHE SAY UH CHEAP UH MEETING ROOM OR I DON'T KNOW
P. A. S.
OKAY P. A. S.
THE THIRD ONE IS CALLED UH THE S UM THIS IS UH THE SMART MEETING ROOM DEVELOP AT FRIBOURG WHICH IS CALLED THE SMART
D. I. V. A. SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH OKAY
E. WHICH IS FIREWIRE
A CARD A VIDEO CARD WHICH IS CALL UM I. V. C. MM YEAH
IN FACT THIS IS A VIDEO CARD WITH FOUR UM INPUTS
ON THESE FOUR INPUTS YOU CAN HAVE ONLY VIDEO
SO ON ONE INPUT THEY PUT UM A CONVERSION BOX A CONVERTER WHICH CONVERTS FROM SLIDE
WE HAVE A HIGH QUALITY IN SLIDE AND WE GO TO LOW QUALITY TO LOWER QUALITY WITH UH VIDEO
D
THESE ONE ARE JUST FOR VIDEO AND AUDIO
AND IN THAT CASE WE USE UM A FRAME GRABBER HERE
AND UM OF COURSE THESE TWO CARDS WILL BE ON THE SAME MACHINE
YEAH THESE ONE NO NO
TH UH THIS ONE IS AND THIS ONE THE VIDEO CARD
AND THIS ONE THIS IS UH THE CARD THAT WE HAVE ALREADY AT IDIAP FOR THE SLI
TO HAVE TWO T UH MM YOU WANTS TO HA DO YOU HAVE TWO QUALITY H HIGH QUALITY AND
IN FA YEAH UH WE JUST REMEMBER THAT HERE WE WE STILL HAVE ONLY ONE MACHINE TO DO UH THE SLIDE VIDEO AND AUDIO ACQUISITION
FACT WE HAVE A MASTER MACHINE THAT'S UM
AND UM BASICALLY ON THE SLAVE MACHINE WE HAVE TWO CARDS ONE FOR AUDIO AND ONE FOR VIDEO
SO THEY DEVELOP SOMETHING TO SYNCHRONIZE THESE TWO CARDS TOGETHER AND TH UH THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH IS IT'S MORE W WHICH IS CALL UH DIRECT SHOW
BUT YOU WANT ALSO THESE TWO STREAMS TO BE SYNCHRONIZED
I WOULD LIKE JUST TO TALK NOW REGARDING UH THE THE FIRE FREE SMART MEETING ROOM AT IDIAP
SO THE FILE IS HUGE AND THEY REALLY NEED UH UM THEY HAVE A LONG POST PROCESSING TO CONVERT RAW FILE TO UH DIVX OR TO OUR OWN FILES
SO MAYBE FIRST I WILL JUST DESCRIBE THE MA THE SMART MEETING ROOM THAT WE HAVE AT IDIAP
WE HAVE THE MASTER P. C. WHICH TAKE KS UH WHICH TAKES CARE ABOUT THE AUDIO
WE RE USE THE UM MIDI SIGNAL
UH WITH UM TO INSERT THE TIME CODE ON EACH FRAME
AND WE SAVE THAT TO D. V. RECORDER
UH WE KNOW THE PROBLEM OF THAT THAT UH THIS IS THAT AFTER EACH MEETING SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE CARE ABOUT THE D. V. TAPES AND TO T CONVERT THEM INTO DIVX
SO MY IDEA IS TO D DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS TO DEVELOP A S UM
MAY I SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH A VIDEO SLAVE MACHINE UH WHICH USE THE MIDI UM WHICH USE ALSO THE MIDI TIME CODE
SO WE TAKE THAT SIGNAL HERE AND WE MOVE TO THIS UH MACHINE HERE WHICH IS IN FACT JUST UH THE I. V. C. VIDEO CARD
AND WE COM AND WE S AND WE CONVERT FILE DIRECTLY TO DIVX
CO YEAH
I AM BUT I AM JUST GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS ONE
UH THIS IS UH I JUST WANT TO TO DESCRIBE HERE THE BUS
AND ANY DEVICE WE WHICH WANTS TO SEND A PACKAGE A P A PACKET SORRY SHOULD ASK UM THERE IS A MANAGER OF THAT BUS
THIS JUST OF THE BUS
ANY DEVICE WHICH WANTS TO SEND A PACKET HAS TO R TO R
UH REQUIRE SOME UH BAND WIDTH ON THE BUS ON THE BUS
AND SO AFTER THAT HE WILL HAVE THAT BAND WIDTH
AND HE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THAT BAND WIDTH
SO UM YEAH HE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THAT BAND WIDTH
UH YEAH
I I AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE HAVE A BUS MANAGER AND THE BUS MANAGER SEND JUST A FLAG TO SAY NOW IT'S TIME TO GIVE ME YOU DATA
THIS IS THIS KIND OF SIGNAL THAT THE TH BUS MANAGER IS SENDING
AND JUST AFTER THAT BUS JUST AFTER THAT UH SIGNAL ALL DEVICE WILL SEND UH THE DATA
SO WE WILL HAVE THE DATA FROM A. FROM B. AND FROM C. AND SO ON
THE DATA FROM A. B. AND C. AND SO ON AND SO ON
AND SO WITH FIRE WIRE WE ARE SURE TO HAVE A UM AN ACQUISITION SYSTEM
NOW THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH FIRE WIRE IS THAT THAT FIRE WIRE IS JUST AN KIND OF INTELLIGENT UH A SMART PIPE
SO WE CAN PUT RAW DATA OR WE CAN SEND A DIVX DATA
OR WE CAN SEND ALSO UH WHAT I UH WAS PRESENTING IN MY TERM PRESENTATION WAS A H. TWO SIX FOUR
BUT IN THAT CASE WE NEED SOMETHING UH HARDWARE HERE TO UNCODE RAW DATA TO A GIVEN FORMAT
BECAUSE UH THIS JUST AN ON AN AUDIO VIDEO CHANNEL
UH AND AFTER THAT AND THE MAJOR POINT IS TO M COMBINE BOTH
THIS NOT ON THE CARD
UM F I THINK DIRECT SHOW YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FOR FREE
M I SHOULD CHECK
YEAH IT M YEAH
BECAUSE I THINK UM THE VIDEO IS DONE THE VIDEO COMPRESSION IS DONE ON THE ON THAT CARD AND UH I'M NOT HUNDRED PERCENT SURE
BUT I THINK THE J. PEG THE J. PEG CONVERSION FOR THE SLIDE CAPTURE IS DONE ALSO ON THE CARD
AH YEAH
MAYBE A FIRST SO SOLUTION WILL BE JUST TO START W WITH
UH NO NO NO
BUT WE START WITH THE I. V. C.
UH I. V. C. I. V. C. SHOULD GO FASTER
I SCHEDULE TO TO WORK ON THAT FROM M
BUT I HAVE ALSO A QUE
MAYB
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY UH THERE IS MANY UNKNOWN IN THAT PROJECT
IF WE DON'T WE WE ASKS FOR MORE PEOPLE MAYBE H. E. V. S. PEOPLE
TO TO TO BE SLIGHTLY INVOLVED IN THAT PROJECT TO BE TO TO RESPECT THE DATE
N
BUT UH AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE SOME OTHER PROJECT I I WANT TO FINISH UH THOSE PROJECT FIRST
I SAID THAT I HAVE NO TIME YET
I SAY I HAVE NO TIME GI NOW CURRENTLY I UM I SAY SOME FOR SOME PROJECT YOU SAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
I I UM WITH I. M. TWO I I I DID UH I MENTION THAT I WILL HAVE FROM JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX I WILL HAVE TIME FOR THAT
NO I WILL WORK FULLY ON THAT ON THIS POINT
FROM JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX I WI
UH Y
YEAH THE YEAH
AND AS SOON AS WE WE WE AS SOON AS WE WE WE ARE NOT IN TIME WE WE WE CON
I WANT TO FINISH ALL THESE PROJECT WHEN EVERYTHING IS FINISHED
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
UH I I DON'T KNOW REGARDING H. E. V. S.
PAS
I MEAN DON'T S I DON'T SEE WHY YOU COULD NOT CAPTURE THE VIDEOS I MEAN WITH A CARD LIKE THIS
I MEAN GIVEN THE SLIDES BUT THEY ARE IN NO CASE THEY ARE EXTRACTING THE TEXT FROM THE SLIDES
SO WITH IN UH IN UH ALL THE CASES WHAT I'VE SEEN
TO THE DOCUMENT
AT LEAST FOR UH BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO WORKING WITH UH MAYBE MORE COMPLEX DOCUMENTS WITH IMAGES AND TEXT AND SO ON
WHICH IS SOMETHING SOMEHOW WE WOULD LIKE TO RELAX UH BECAUSE UH PEOPLE UH LIKE IN IT'S YOU MAY NOT WANT EACH TIME TO ASK THE PERSON
MAYBE THE PERSON HAS A POINT POINT NOT THE NOT A P. D. F. VERSION
TO SOME EXTENT WE WOULD LIKE TO EXTRACT SOME ELEMENTS OF THE LAYOUT TO DISTING TO HAVE A MORE HIGH ANALYSIS
BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS MORE AUTOMATICALLY AND IN PARTICULAR FOR THE TEXT RECOGNITION TO DO TO BE ABLE TO DO RETRIEVAL UH OF SLIDES OR POINTS
WE WOULD LIKE NOT TO HAVE TO RELY YEAH TO A FIRST P. D. F. VERSION OR ANY VERSION OF THE DOCUMENT
BUT I MEAN THIS ONE IS THE I. V. C.
SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS ON THIS CARD THERE ARE FOUR INPUTS RIGHT
NOT N SO ENOUGH UH WELL YEAH YEAH
I MEAN JUST BECAUSE WE CANNOT REC UH WE CAN W SOMETHING WE CANNOT DO WITH UH IT SEEMS FOR WITH THE HIGH Q QUALITY UH CAPTURE UH DEVICE IS TO HAVE A STREAM
SO BASICALLY IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO HAVE STILL UM UH THE S UH THE SLIDE STREAM SO THAT FOR INSTANCE IF WE DETECT THERE IS A NEW VIDEO THAT IS DISPLAYED ALSO ON
TO SOME EXTENT WE COULD JUST CUT THIS VIDEOS TO KEEP IT AND TO BE ABLE TO REPLAY IT UH LATER ON AND SO ON
AND MAYBE INDEED IF FOR INSTANCE THE SLIDE STREAM ON THE ON THE RIGHT IS AUTOMATICALLY SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE OTHER PARTS OF THE VIDEO
IT MAY BE EASIER TO S TO UH SYNCHRONIZE DIRECTLY BY SOME SOME MATCHING PROCESS
BUT YOU WOULD SAY AS A CONTENTS FROM THE CONTENT LEVEL
DOING AN ALIGNMENT FROM THE SLIDE STREAM AND FROM THE SNAP SHOTS WE WOULD HAVE ON THE OTHER SIDE W IS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE
BUT I THINK I COULD SEE I COULD IMAGINE THAT THIS COULD BE A REASONABLE PROCESS TO DO
AND IT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THIS WOULD SOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES REGARDING I MEAN LIKE THE POSSIBILITY OF D OF DISPLAYING VIDEOS AFTER FROM FROM WHAT WE RECORD
AH OKAY
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FRAME DROPPING I MEAN BECAUSE ANYWAY IN EACH IN THE VIDEO SIGNAL IT IS ENCODED THE TIME RIGHT
I MEAN THE TIME STAMP IS I IN THE SIGNAL
SO IF YOU DROP SOME FRAME
WHICH HAPPENS SOMETIMES WHEN YOU DO COMPRESSION OR ACQUISITION UH YOU YOU UH EV YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY FIND THIS IN UH THE SIGNAL RIGHT
I MEAN IT'S ENCODED IN THE IN THE IMAGE
OTHERWISE UH IF THERE IS SOME FRAME DROPPING YOU HAVE TO RELY ON THE NUMBER OF FRAMES YOU ARE COUNTING MORE OR LESS I SUPPOSE TO TO ASSESS IT
S PROBLEM
UH
YEAH I MEAN JUST THAT YOU KNOW IF OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A C OTHER LIBRARIES THAT MAY
AT THE SAME TIME YO SEE IF YOU CRASH A MACHINE I MEAN BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING SOME TEST
YOU MAY NOT WANT TO HAVE WHAT'S ON YOUR MACHINE I MEAN TO UH TO BE TO BE UH DE ERASED OR WHATS WHATEVER
SO I THINK IT'S SO MAYBE THERE IS A MACHINE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER FOR THIS YOU NEED YOU KNOW A VERY POWERFUL MACHINE AND SO ON
BUT STILL I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S DONE ON THE CARD YOU NEED TO BASIC THING YOU NEED TO CHECK IS UM IS A BUS RIGHT
I MEAN THE BUS WRITING I MEAN THE SPEED OF UH THE BUS
UH
BECAUSE I MEAN I MEAN THE I. V. C. SYSTEM
I MEAN IT'S UH I SO MY FEELING IS THAT I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE EXPERTISE IN THIS LIKE IN FRIBOURG ALSO
IS THE I. V. C. BUT USING THE SIGNALS THAT ARE COMING I MEAN SO BASICALLY IT'S USING THE I. V. C. OKAY
BUT OF COURSE IF WE HAVE THIS IN TWO YEARS MAYBE OKAY IT'S GOOD WE HAVE IT
BUT OF COURSE IT'S IT'S ON THE IT'S TOO LONG I MEAN IN TERMS OF IN TERM OF RESEARCH
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE AN INNOVATION
AND THE THE I KNOW I'M WE WE SEE QUITE WELL WHY IS WORKING ON THIS RIGHT
BUT IN TWO YEARS YOU KNOW IF WE WANT TO DO IF WE WANT TO BUILD A C. T. I. OR TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY AND SOMETHING LIKE THIS
BUT THERE IS ALREADY SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO PUT ON THE MARKET AND SO ON
SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY SO THIS IS ONE OF THE POINTS RESPECT TO RESEARCH OF COURSE
BECAUSE WHEN WHEN YOU SAY HERE NOW NO I'M NOT GOING TO START TO WORKING ON THIS BEFORE JANUARY
I MEAN THE POINT IS THAT OLIVIER WILL R YOU HAVE I MEAN S SINCE ONE YEAR UH YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AND SO ON
SO IF YOU HAVE NO TIME TO PUT PRIORITY AT SOME POINTS AND THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE DURING ONE YEAR ON THIS PROJECT
AT LEAST UH SAY THIS TO US AND WE'LL SEE UH WITH FRANCK
SO NOW YOU ARE SAYING YOU HAVE NO TIME
SO NOW YOU SAY TO US
WHEN WE IF WE DISCUSS WITH FRANCK UH FRANCK CRITTIN OR UH UH FRANK UH FORMAZ AND WE'LL SEE OKAY AND GO AND TRY TO SEE
OKAY APPARENTLY UH HE HAS NO TIME TO TO WORK ON THIS
DO WE WANT TO DO WE NEED TO TAKE SOME INTERN TO WORK ON THIS UH AND SO ON AND SO ON
I MEAN BUT SO THIS A POINT
I DON'T KNOW WITH WHO YOU ARE DISCUSSING ABOUT THE TIME YOU ARE YOU CAN S UH S SPEND ON EACH OF THE PROJECT
BUT IF Y BECAUSE NOW YOU ARE JUST TELLING US YOU HAVE NO TIME INDEED TO WORK ON THIS RIGHT
I MEAN I MEAN PEOPLE UH I SUPPOSE AT H. U. V. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE UH WHERE I WAS IN LE MANS IN THE U. B. UH I MEAN THERE UH WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY SOME SOME STUDENTS UH THAT WOULD BE AWARE OF AND THAT COULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS
UH I'M I'M SURE THE S SE
SO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT UH ON YOUR SIDE WHE WHAT'S YOUR YEAH
SYNCHRON SO THIS MEANS THAT TO SOME EXTENT WE COULD HAVE A DEVICE WHICH WOULD NOT YET BE FULLY SYNCHRONIZED AND
I DON'T KNOW WE'VE UH YOU KNOW VERY WELL DONE UH CODE IN TERMS OF SENDING SIGNALS AND SO ON
BUT THAT MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT BECAUSE I MEAN IT SYNCHRONIZE UP TO DON'T KNOW FIVE SECONDS
BUT MAYBE F RESPECT TO SLIDES AND THE REST IS NOT IS SOMETHING THAT MAY BE TOLERABLE
SO STILL WE WOULD BE ABLE TO START DOING SOME RECORDINGS AND MAYBE UH DOING EVEN THE AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENT OR AT LEAST WE WOULD HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT
UH DO DO BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE WITH MICROPHONE ARRAYS WHERE YOU WOULD NEED MICRO SECOND ALIGNMENTS OF COURSE
AND THE GOAL WOULD BE THAT INDEED WE COULD START UH REC DOING SOME OF THE RECORDINGS OF THE TIME SO THAT INDEED WE WOULD ALREADY WE UH WE WOULD HAVE UH SOMETHING WHERE UH WE COULD UH START GETTING THE DATA
I MEAN SO AND UH SO I MEAN THIS IS UH THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUE AS WELL
WHICH IS TO HAVE IT SO THAT WE CAN PLAY AND WE CAN MAKE A NICE DEMO AND SO ON WITH THE FULL UH THING AND SOMETHING
SO F THE OTHER PART IS TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHICH FROM WHICH WE CAN ALREADY RECORD DATA AND WITH SOME APPROXIMATION
THAT TO HAVE SUCH A SYSTEM WOULDN'T REQUIRE A SIX MONTHS OF WORK BECAUSE BASICALLY THEIR OWN CODE IS THERE TO SOME EXTENT AND UH THE I. V. C. IS SOMETHING QUITE STANDARD FROM WHICH WE COULD ASK I MEAN EVEN WE COULD EVEN PAY MAYBE PRO SOME PEOPLE FROM FRIBOURG
I MEAN TO COME HERE AND TO AND TO HELP US WITH THE INSTALLATION ON A COMPUTER AND UH AND UH TO TO TO GET THE SO I HAVE MORE THE FEELING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE ALMOST IN ONE MONTH
AGAIN I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT THE SYNCHRONIZATION I MEAN AS
SO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE IT IT'S MORE TESTING IT DOES NOT REQUIRE SO FOR THIS WE I MEAN IF YOU PUT THE TWO CARDS ON THE COMPUTER
YOU PUT THE TWO THEN YOU YOU BASICALLY YOU SAY PLAY ON THE BOTH SIDES AND YOU LOOK WHETHER AT THE END YOU HAVE UH A RECORDED SIGNALS WHICH IS IS IS UH THE TIME THAT IT SHOULD UH BE AND UH OR WHETHER I MEAN THE FACT THAT WHENEVER I MEAN THE SLIDES IS DOING SOME UH PROCESSING UH IT THERE IS SOME AND THERE IS SOME FRAME DROPS OR THINGS LIKE THIS
UH
BUT L LET BE CAREFUL
THERE'S ONE IMPORTANT POINT
SO IN OUR CASE WE NEED TO HAVE A GOOD PROCESSING OF SLIDES THAT IN OUR CASE IT MEANS TO TRANSCRIBE WITH AN O. C. R. AND THEN MAKE INDEXING
FOR US WE NEED TO HAVE UH THIS SUFFICIENT RESOLUTION IMAGES OF SLIDES TO DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO
AS FAR AS I KNOW SO FAR UH THEY DID SIMILAR WORKS ON MEETINGS DOCUMENT CENTRED MEETINGS
SO THEY NEVER REALLY TOOK INTO ACCOUNT A POSSIBILITY OF ACTUALLY PERFORMING PROCESSING ON THE DOCUMENT THEY TALK ABOUT DURING THE MEETING DURING IN THIS CASE THE UH THE TALK
THE CONFERENCE THE THE TH THE PRESENTATION
AS FAR AS I KNOW
AS FAR AS THEY PUBLISHED I KN I KNOW THE RESULTS THEY PUBLISHED UH SO FAR
SO ESSENTIALLY THEY N NEVER TOOK INTO ACCOUNT I MEAN THE WORK AT THE HIGH LEVEL WHICH MEANS BASICALLY WE HAVE THE INFORMATION COMING FROM HERE AND THERE
AND WE N CREATED TECHNIQUES THAT ALLOW TO STARTS FROM THE TEXT THERE AND THE THINGS THAT ARE SAID AND W IF WE FIND CONTEXT
BUT AS THEY DON'T WORK ON THE LOW LEVEL SO LOW LEVEL IT MEANS BASICALLY OKAY TAKE THE SPEECH AND EXTRACT THE TRANSCRIPTION
AS FAR AS I KNOW
LET'S SAY THAT IT MAKES UH LESS AUTOMATIC IN THE SENSE THAT AT POINT YOU NEED SOMEONE GIVING THE FILE AND PUTTING THE FILE UPLOAD IN SOMEWHERE ET CETERA
I IT'S THE SAME AS AS YOU HAVE IN THE PICTURE YEAH
NOW BASICALLY WE HAVE ALL THIS KIND OF GENERAL VIEW ABOUT ALL THE SYSTEMS MAYBE WE CAN TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK TO OUR SYSTEM
AND MAYBE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK JUST A MOMENT UH AT WHAT POINT WE ARE AND W WHEN WE PLAN BASICALLY TO GET SOMETHING UH DONE AND WORKING
I CAN ADD TO THAT LIST OF PROJECT IS SOMETHING THAT JEAN MARC AND ME WE HAVE FOUND IN THE LITERATURE
SO WELL ESSENTIALLY NOW WE HAVE THE MATERIAL AS FAR I'M AS I'M UNDERSTOOD
OKAY S SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE OTHER MACHINES ACTUALLY YEAH
WHEN WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE
UH
SO IS THIS UH NO THAT'S NOT THAT I DON'T CARE
UH THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM
SO IS FOR SO HALF NEXT YEAR
RE RESULTS WHAT DOES IT MEAN
YOU KNOW FOR FOR ME WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WHEN IT IS READY TO BE USE
BUT POTENTIALLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A STUDENT SUPPOSED TO WORK IN THIS
BUT UH YOU KNOW MM SOME WAY WE WE WE WE CANNOT HAVE A STUDENTS AND MAKE HIM WAIT ONE YEAR BEFORE HE HAS UH THE MATERIAL TO WORK
UH MAKE SOMETHING RE THAT YOU ARE USING VERY VAGUE EXPRESSION
AND IF YOU THINK IT'S IT'S NOT BEFORE UH BUT BUT MUST BE REASONABLE I M I MEAN IF YOU THINK IT WILL BE NOT BEFORE DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX
WELL BUT THERE IS NO DAY TO RESPECT
BUT IS JUST TO KNOW IN THE SENSE THAT REALLY UH THIS P THIS MM THING HAS BEEN STOP NOW FOR QUITE A LONG TIME
UH UH IT N IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL
NOW WE HAVE IT
IT'S SOMETHING THAT UH IS A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
WE SEE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE WORKING ET CETERA
WE ARE GOING TO LOSE IT SOME WAY IF UH IF WE DON'T PUT SOME AND VERY HONESTLY YEAH
UH DON'T THINK THAT OKAY SOMETHING NICE WE WE CAN WAIT OR SOONER OR LATER IT WILL HAPPEN
UH YEAH
SO I THINK IT'S THE MOMENT UH FOR YOU TO REALLY REALISE TRY TO TO HAVE A REALISTIC UH DATE
I LIKE TO DO IT BUT I HAVE NO TIME
BECAUSE AT A CERTAIN POINT IT'S A MATTER OF TIME
UH BUT UH PLEASE JUST DON'T KEEP THIS AS A KIND OF THING
YOU CAN'T SAY I LIKE TO DO IT AND BUT THEN AH BUT I WILL DO IT WHEN I CAN
UH YEAH YEAH YEAH
S S
WE CAN ASK WE CAN TRY TO ASK MAYBE IF SOME PERSON FOR SIX MONTHS SO THAT YOUR ROLE IS SIMPLY TO HELP AND ADVISE
S
CONSIDER THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO FIND THEM ET CETERA AND SO ON
AT EACH
DO YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT UH CAN HELP YOU
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO FIND ON THE WAY
UH W WE DON'T KNOW
UH MAYBE WE WILL S WE WI WILL NOT ABLE TO BE CONTINUOUS
BECAUSE ONE OF THE WRONGEST THING IS TO WORK ONE WEEK THEN ONE MONTH NO ET CETERA
AND IT CAN'T BE HIM IT CAN'T BE ME
YOU KNOW W WE CAN FIND THE TIME WHETHER IT IS YOUR TIME WHETHER IT IS THE TIME OF SOMEONE ELSE
BUT BUT UH OTHERWISE I MEAN AS YOU SAY TO DO IT IN TWO YEARS P
AND THEN WE D MAKE A DECISION IN THE SENSE WHETHER YOU CONTINUE WORKING OR WE TRY TO FIND THE TIME IN A DIFFERENT WAY OR WE TRY TO ELIMINATE YOUR OTHER PRIORITIES YOU'RE UNDER
W EXACTLY IT WI BUT BETTER NO PERSON THAN A BAD PERSON ANYWAY
YEAH SORRY ABOUT THAT MATTHEW IS STILL ON THE WAY
U OH I HATE THESE THINGS
AND IS AND THE R RESULT WAS NO
BUT UH BU BUT THE QUESTION IS IF IS THAT RESULT NO BECAUSE IT'S NO OR IS IT ALSO JUST BECAUSE THERE'S NOT REALLY ENOUGH DATA TO BE SURE ABOUT ANYTHING
THIS IS SO SORT OF A FEELING THAT WE HAD BUT HADN'T SHOWN
I THINK I MEAN I IN UH FROM UH FROM AN APPLICATION POINT OF VIEW IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR VOCABULARY CONTAINS ALL THE WORDS ON THE SLIDES
WELL THIS IS H THIS IS HOW THE DICTIONARY'S CALCULATED
IT CALCULATED SUCH THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE WORD IT DOESN'T AFFECT TO A GREAT DEGREE THE THE THE WORD ERROR RATE
M LIKE YEAH
I MEAN THE IT'S PROBABLY VERY DEPENDENT ON THE SPEAKER AS WELL
OR OR OR QUITE PURPOSEFULLY TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS SO THAT THEY'VE SORT OF GOT MULTI MODALITY OF YOU KNOW
S
WE S GO STRAIGHT TO THE SEMANTICS OF THE YEP
WELL I MEAN UH IT JUST COMES DOWN TO THE TO THE MERE FACT THAT WORD ERROR RATE IS JUST TAKE THE WORDS
I IF YOU HAVE TH SLIDES THEN YEAH
HAVE YOU HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO TO DO IN IN IN PLACE OF THIS
M MEETING ACTION SORT OF FOCUS
W
YE YEAH OKAY
AND WHICH IS SORT OF BUILDING UPON WHAT YOU KNOW DONG AND OTHERS HAVE WORKED ON IN TERMS OF
UH A Y ARE ARE YOU ALSO CONSIDERING THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEETINGS FOR INSTANCE
WELL I MEAN IT IF IF IF THESE SIMILAR SORT OF PHRASES OR WORDS WERE DISCUSSED IN THIS MEETING AND WERE ALSO DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS YOU HAVE TO CHES THE CHECK THE STATISTICS
THIS THIS WON'T OCCUPY AB AB YOU KNOW WON'T OCCUPY YOU FOR THREE YEARS OR WHATEVER JUST ON THIS I GUESS
BUT HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THE FUTURE AND SO JUST A S
OR B OR AS YOU SAY BACK CHANNEL VERSUS YEAH
UH YEAH I WOULDN'T GET TOO DISTRACTED I GUESS ON D D IF YOU'VE GOT TWO TRACKS I'D LIKE TO
AND UH THE K AND THE QUESTION IS ALSO ARE THERE OTHER SORT OF MORE SENSIBLE WAYS OF DOING IT
UH BUT I MEAN FOR INSTANCE IT SHOULD BE LINKED TO THE OTHER STUFF THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING ON UM CALL ROUTING FOR INSTANCE
I MEAN I THINK I MEAN I I THINK THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO DRAW SOME SORT OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO AS WE WERE SAYING
W
WELL W UH W NO IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT IT'S F WHAT IS IT
I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE ONE SORT OF EXTRA HIGHER GOAL ABOVE THAT SO THAT YOU CAN MOTIVATE FUTURE RESEARCH
SPECI
WELL ANOTHER THING YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THESE MODELS HAVE BEEN TUNED TO INCLUDE AMI DATA
YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOU HADN'T SEEN ANY PRIOR DATA THEN YOU MIGHT SEE A BIGGER CONTRIBUTION AS WELL
Y THE AUDIO QUALITY THOUGH
AH
YEAH THEY HAD LIKE UH Y UH Y THEY YOU KNOW THEY HAD THIS SET UP WITH THE UH THE MICROPHONES
SO SOMEONE EVERY IT THERE WAS ONE MICROPHONE SHARED BETWEEN EVERY TWO PEOPLE
UH F IT WAS IT WAS MEANT I THINK THEY THEY CHOSE THAT LECTURE THEATRE POSSIBLY WITH THE IDEA THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR COLLECTING DATA
SO AP
UM IT IS I MEAN IT'S SAME AS US PUTTING ON A THE HEADPHONES AND WHATEVER
I MEAN ANY ANY AUDIO CAPTURED DURING THAT PERIOD IS I IS RUBBISH
BUT THERE'S NO SORT OF SYSTEM THAT'S REALLY BUILT TO D TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHEN YOU'RE YOU'RE CAPTURING THAT
WILL IT INCORPORATE LIKE UH AN S. M. A. AND UH
AS YOU WANT YEP
WH UH THE I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING FROM PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVES
YOU'D YOU'D HAVE TO THE THE AMI RECOGNITION SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW IS EITHER FOR THESE MICROPHONES OR FOR THE MICROPHONE ARRAY
AND EVERY TIME WE D WE GENERATE A NEW CORPUS AND TRY TO CARRY OUT NEW RESEARCH WE DISCOVER SORT OF AREAS THAT ARE TOO CONTROLLED YOU KNOW
I MEAN THE AMI ONES WERE A LOT BETTER IN TERM OF THAT THAN M. FOUR OR WHATEVER
OH WELL
I'M UH I'M JUST CURIOUS DO THE LIKE THE ICSI MEETINGS DO THEY HAVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE AUDIO
OKAY I'M JUST THINKING WHETHER OR NOT THERE AN ARE ANY OTHER SOURCES I MEAN MAYBE CHIL DATA
BUT I MEAN GIVEN THAT IT'S COMING FROM THE SAME BASIS AS AMI
THE ONE THING ABOUT THAT AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP IN THE LAST NIST EVALS WAS THE FACT THAT IT'S ALMOST TOO UNI MODAL
SO ONCE AGAIN YOU DON'T SEE THE THE COMPLEX SORT OF LEVELS OF INTERACTION
I MEAN UH Y UH THERE'S NO WAY OF GETTING AROUND THAT
I MEAN YOU MIGHT FIND NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF YOUR DATA IS DIRECTLY REFERRING TO YOUR SLIDES IN A T IN A TAM
THAT IS UH IS IN TAMS
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE USING OR LEARNING ABOUT THE SAME TECHNIQUES THAT YOU'LL NEED FOR DOING OTHER THINGS ALONG THESE LINES
THIS N
WELL YOU'D UH SURE
AT L AT AT LEAST SPOT IF THEY FORGET TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING AND IT WON'T LET THEM CONTINUE ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE UNTIL THEY'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THE POINTS
AS IN FIVE SIX YOU KNOW NUMBER WHERE WHERE THE GRAPHEMIC YEAH WELL I YEAH
IF UM HE HE ASKED ME ALL YOU KNOW COULD I PRE SEGMENT THE SLIDES FOR HIM UH
YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO S YOU WANTED TO HAVE THE TOPIC SEGMENTATION
IT'S TRUE FOR ME THEN
THAT'S A STYLISTIC THING AS MUCH AS ANYTHING
YE
AFTER THE AFTER THE HARD DRIVE CRASH WE TOOK THE TIME TO ACTUALLY REBUILD THE THE THE SYSTEM AND ACTUALLY TRAIN 'CAUSE ORIGINALLY WE SORT OF HAD THE IDEA OF OH WE'LL USE A RECOGNIZER THAT'S BEEN TRAINED ON A LARGE AMOUNT OF TELEPHONE SPEECH DATA AND THAT SHOULD GIVE US A BETTER RESULT
I JUST AS A CONTRAST I TRAINED ONE SPECIFICALLY ON THIS DATA
RESULTS WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL UM WHICH SAYS TO ME THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE DATA RATHER THAN AND IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS
IN TERMS OF UM YOU CAN HAVE LIKE UH A TWO SECOND UTTERANCE UH CREDIT CARDS AND THEN TWENTY SECONDS OF SILENCE COMING AFTER IT
WHICH IN WHICH WHEN YOU F WHEN YOU FIRST THINK ABOUT IT YOU JUST THINK OH SILENCE WHATEVER NOTHING WILL HAPPEN
UH YEAH C. M. S. C. C. V. N.
UH SO W WE NEED A DECENT END POINT DETECTION SYSTEM RUNNING BEFORE WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN DO THAT
AND WE'RE CONVERGING ON HAVING ONE NOW JUST IN IN SORT OF TANDEM WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT OF THIS WEB BASED RECOGNIZER
UM BUT I I THINK WE SHOULD SEE A DECENT SORT OF IMPROVEMENT THEN
BUT ALSO IT SHOULD ACTUALLY AFFECT THE RECOGNITION ON THE SPEECH SEGMENTS AS WELL
TH
MM THAT'S THE HARD P OH I MIGHT UH GIVEN THE TROUBLE WE'VE HAD WITH THIS CORPUS I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES
WE TRAINED THE SYSTEM JUST ON THIS DATA
SIX T HALF OF THEM ROUGHLY WE'VE THROWN AWAY
SO USE THAT FOR ACOUSTIC TRAINING
BUT ONE CAN IMAGINE A COMMERCIAL SYSTEM UH THAT THAT THAT S STEVEN COX USED FROM NUANCE PROBABLY HAD ALL THESE THINGS
BUILT IN END POINT DETECTION ET CETERA ET CETERA
MM OKAY THIS IS F OKAY
WELL I DON'T MIND RUNNING IT
UH
'CAUSE I MEAN WE'VE UP UNTIL NOW UH YOU HAVEN'T BEEN RUNNING ANY RECOGNITION ON AND NEITHER DID JEAN YVES ON THAT ON THAT DATA
OH SURE BUT I MEAN THE SCRIPTS ARE SO AUTOMATED IT'S JUST A MATTER OF SITTING UH UH SUBMITTING A JOB TO THE CLUSTER AND
I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE POINT OF THAT
I DON'T MIND RUNNING IT
THAT'D IT'D BE LIKE UH HALF AN HOUR'S WORK IN A DAY TO RUN THE RECOGNITION SCRIPTS
ARTEM SHOULD FAMILIARISE HIMSELF WITH THE A. S. R. SYSTEMS OR WHATEVER
BUT I DON'T UH I D I DON'T THINK THIS IS A POINT THAT'S WORTH SORT OF WORRYING ABOUT AT THIS STAGE ANYWAY
WELL 'CAUSE I'M I'M SORT OF ASSUMING THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SO AN END POINT DETECTION REGARDLESS OF THIS WORKING ON THIS NUANCE CORPUS
WE NEED IT FOR AMI
WE NEED IT FOR UM THE ONLINE DEMO
IT'S IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WOULD THINK
AND IS
I MEAN IT'S IT'S IT'S YOU YOU'RE ALMOST ASSURED IT'S ONLY GONNA BE A SINGLE SPEAKER ON THE MICROPHONE
UM YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM I TAKE IT EITHER
UH N NO IT SHOULD BE LOOKING TOWARDS THE START OF NEXT YEAR BASICALLY
THE IS IT SO I MEAN YOU SHOULD
AND IT'S NICE TO GET SOME FEEDBACK ON I MEAN THAT FEEDBACK WILL PROBABLY COME AFTER YOUR PROPOSAL POSSIBLY
N YEAH SORT OUT ANY BUGS OR WHATEVER
GONNA HAVE TO S HAVE THIS AMI CORPUS LINKED IN NO TIME
YE
I MEAN INTUITIVELY OF COURSE YOU TEND TO USE MORE THE WORDS THAT ARE ON THE SLIDE
BUT THE MASS OF THE WORDS ACTUALLY YOU USE ARE WORDS THAT ARE COMMON
OF THE REST UH REMAINING FIFTY PERCENT I MEAN ARE ALL WORDS THAT APPEAR ONE TWO THREE TIMES
SO UH THAT'S THE KIND OF THING UH I MEAN THAT'S THE KIND OF MEASURE THE IND STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE IS NOT ON SINGLE WORDS
EVEN IF ACTUALLY I REMEMBER I JUST MADE SOME MEASURE UH SAYING OKAY L LET'S LOOK AT HOW MANY WORDS I DON'T HAVE IN THE DICTIONARY AND ARE IN THE SLIDES
UH IT IS DIFFERENT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE OTHER TASKS WHERE THE ONLY WORDS THAT ALL ARE WORDS
IN THAT CASE EVEN THE SLIGHT IMPROVEMENTS UH HE GETS AT THAT POINT THEY CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE
BE BE B BE CAREFUL IT'S NOT EXACTLY THIS BECAUSE FOR SURE THERE ARE WORDS THAT TEND TO BE
SO THE POINT IS YOU WANT TO VERIFY WHETHER YOU CAN IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION RATE BY USING AS AN INFORMATION THE WORDS THAT UH ARE CONTAIN IN THE SLIDES
FIRST FOR EXAMPLE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WORDS IN ANY KIND OF TEXT ARE STOP WORDS
AND THE REMAINING A APPEAR SO LITTLE THAT IN THE CASE CANNOT REALLY IMPROVE THAT MUCH
I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN MEASURED ET CETERA BUT STILL IS A BIT QUALITATIVE
TO HAVE A QUANTITATIVE MEASURE MM-HMM WE SIMPLY DID UH A MEASURE OF STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE WORDS IN GENERAL
SO NOT SOME WORDS THE WORDS IN GENERAL
OTHERWISE YOU CAN SEE THAT IF A WORDS APPEAR ONCE BASICALLY IT IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RELATED TO ONE SLIDE HUH
I MEAN WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS NOT THE WORD THAT APPEAR ONCE IT'S THE WORD THAT APPEAR
BUT IS IN GENERAL THE LANGUAGE AND NOT CERTAIN WORDS
IT IS NOT IN TERMS I MEAN FOR ME FOR EXAMPLE IT WAS NOT IN THE SENSE THAT UH AFTER WORKING A LITTLE BIT ON LANGUAGE YOU REALISE THAT THIS KIND OF THING DO NOT HELP SIMPLY BECAUSE MOST OF THE WORDS UH HAVE NOTHING TO DO SPECIFICALLY WITH THE SUBJECT YOU USE
UH MOST OF THE WORDS WE USE UH THAT'S STRANGE BUT ARE SIMPLY NECESSARY TO BUILD A SENTENCE
BUT IT IS TRUE THAT INTUITIVELY UH AS WE ARE DRIVEN IN OUR ATTENTION UH I MEAN IN IN OUR UNDERSTANDING WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DRIVEN BY ATTENTION
AND AND HERE UH ON THE CONTRARY FOR EXAMPLE THE FEW WORDS THAT ARE MM HOW MAY I SAY IT RECOGNIZED MORE CAN REALLY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE
IT ISN'T THE CASE IF YOU WANT TO SEE IF UH I MEAN WHAT IF SEEN IN THE MEETING AND THAT OKAY
OR NOT REALLY OTHER THINGS BUT THE SLIDE IS NO LONGER UH A SUPPORT FOR THE DISCUSSION HUH
THE SLIDE WERE JUST THERE I MEAN BUT THEY WERE NO LONGER USE AS A SUPPORT
SO IN THAT CASE THE PRESENCE OR THE ABSENCE AND ESPECIALLY THE FREQUENCE WITH WHICH YOU OBSERVE THE WORDS THAT ARE ON THE SLIDES CAN BE AN EXCELLENT UH UH CLUE
IT CAN BE SIMPLY INTERPRETED IN THE SENSE OF SAYING UH OKAY I MEAN YOU HAVE THIS CHANNEL OPEN THERE
OR ALSO IN TERMS OF ACTION
YEAH UH WHEN YOU SEE THAT S THE DISCUSSION IS COMPLETELY M DISCONNECTED WITH RESPECT TO THIS SOME WAY UH IT MEANS THAT IT'S HAPPEN IN SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE
SO I MEAN IT'S A KIND OF FEATURE THAT IN MY OPINION CAN BE EASY TO DETECT IT AND UM THAT CAN
OH SO IS THAT MM DOUBLE WAY TO TO SHOW HOW SOME WAY DEPENDENT ON THE TASK
YEAH I KNOW THIS WE ARE S S TALKING ABOUT TODAY SHORT TERM IF YOU WANT
SOME OF THEM YOU CAN DO IT ON A SINGLE MEETING
SO THIS KIND OF FEATURE EXTRACTION BECAUSE BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT IT IS SAYING YES NO THIS CHANNEL IS GOOD
THIS YOU DO IT ON A SINGLE MEETING
I MEAN AT THAT POINT IT BECOMES PRETTY MUCH CRUCIAL THE KIND OF UH DATA YOU HAVE IN THE SENSE THAT FOR THE WAY WE HAVE COLLECTED THE DATA SOME WAY I DON'T KNOW IF IT CAN BE AT THE SAME TIME TOO EASY IN THE SENSE THAT SOME WAY YOU HAVE LITTLE GROUPS OF MEETINGS EXTREMELY CORRELATED
IF YOU WANT UH THIS KIND OF WORDS BECOME INTERESTING WHEN THE CORPUS IS REALLY BIG UH UH WHEN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU CONSIDER EACH MEETING AS A SINGLE ITEM
BUT I MEAN YOU CAN DO OTHER WORK IF YOU CONSIDER IN TERMS OF SPEAKER TURNS OR IN TERMS OF SLIDES AND THAT IS IMMEDIATELY MULTIPLY
SO IT CAN BE ONE MORE FEATURE THAT HELPS IN BUT IT IS VERY SHORT TERM
WHEN THIS UH STATISTICAL TEST IT CAN BE WE HAVE MADE AN EXPERIMENT WE GET A RESULT SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVE WE GIVE AN EXPLANATION
SO WHEN IT GIVES YOU THE KIND OF ANSWER YOU GET IS THAT OKAY TO GO IN THAT IN THAT DIRECTION MAYBE IS NOT THE BEST THING
SO IT GIVES THE POSSIBILITY TO DECIDE TO GO UH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAT CAN BE MORE ON THIS UH LET'S SAY
ONE DOMAIN YEAH
M BUT STILL DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF SAYING WHAT I YEAH YEAH SURE SURE
I MEAN AS HERVE SAID I MEAN BASICALLY IF YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IN FOUR LINES
THAT CAN BE PRESENTATION WHERE YOU HAVE A S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPEECH BETWEEN THINGS THAT ARE SAID AND UH SOME TEXTUAL DOCUMENTS SOME WAY
AND IF YOU WANT FOR EXAMPLE THIS LITTLE WORK UH ABOUT SEEING WHEN THE SLIDE CHANNEL IS BACKGROUND AND FOREGROUND IS NOT BEGINNING OF THIS KIND OF THING
SO A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO CHANNEL THAT PROVIDE SOME KIND OF INFORMATION
FOR THE RECOGNITION IN GENERAL THERE IS NO CORRELATION IN THE SENSE THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS ON THE SLIDE
MOST OF THE WORDS YOU USE MOST OF THE WORDS YOU USE ARE NOT REALLY CORRELATED TO THAT
AND APART OF UH NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED VOCABULARY IN GENERAL
BUT ON AVERAGE YOU KNOW LINGUISTIC RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ON AVERAGE THE PEOPLE USE FIVE HUNDRED WORDS
THEN YOU CAN CHANGE OF TASK AND USE A TASK THE TASK WE WERE MENTIONING ABOUT THE BACK CHANNEL OR FOREGROUND CHANNEL
IN THAT CASE THE ONLY WORDS THAT REALLY ARE IMPORTANT ARE THOSE WORDS THAT APPEAR ON BOTH SLIDES
AT THAT POINT I MEAN A LITTLE IMPROVEMENT OF THAT IT BECOMES A BIG IMPROVEMENT
AH
THE AUDIO IS IS IS VERY BAD
IT WAS IT WAS UH A PERSONAL EFFORT OF MAEL THAT DECIDED TO DO IT
UH THAT'S UH THAT'S THAT IS ONE OF THE REASON FOR EXAMPLE WHY WHICH UH MARK WE POINT PRETTY MUCH ON SLIDES AS A MEAN OF INDEXING
BECAUSE AT THAT POINT THERE IS NO INTERACTION BETWEEN HUMANS AND CAPTURE
I MEAN IS IS IS TAKING TIME FOR THE MATERIAL AND SO ON
ONE UH MICROPHONE
AND TO SLIDES THROUGH THE PROJECTOR
WO
SO SOME WAY YOU CAN ADD AS MANY INPUT AS WE WANT
ALTHOUGH AT THAT POINT WE CAN USE THIS
BUT I DON'T WHY WHY NOT UH SO THERE WILL BE OTHER DATA THEIR TEST DATA
UH AND ESPECIALLY FOR THIS KIND OF PROBLEM I THINK IT CAN BE A MUCH MORE USEFUL KIND OF DATA BECAUSE THERE IS REAL PRESENTATIONS
I MEAN IS IT'S REALITY
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S UH Y N IT IT IT IT'S EXACTLY
IT'S MORE REALISTIC AND UM YEAH PROBABLY IT CAN HELP GO IN THIS DIRECTION OF SAYING WELL LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPEN BETWEEN SPEECH AND SLIDES
UH
UH YEAH YEAH
M
AT LEAST IN NO I'M UH TALKING NOW ABOUT UM THE MEETING
ON PRESENTATION IT IT SHOULD BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT YEAH
AND IT REPRESENT A NICE TASK THAT CAN BE MEASURED THAT IS CLEAR AND
SO IT'S IT'S UH BUT OF COURSE NOT GOING TO BE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A KIND OF THESIS ABOUT THIS
THAT UH IN A SENSE IF YOU WANT I MEAN THAT THAT'S AT LEAST THE WAY I SEE THE THAT LIST I HAVE MADE FOR MY OWN THESIS
AND THEN YOU SEE HOW ALL THESE THINGS THIS TWO LITTLE WORKS OR THE STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE
AND DETECTING WHEN IT IS UH ARE TWO LITTLE WORKS THAT SOME WAY FIT IN THAT VERY GENERAL UH FRAMEWORK
SHOWN FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW IT N THAT THINGS MM THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
FOR EXAMPLE ONE THAT I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO DO WHICH IS KIND OF FUN
THOSE ARE BAD SPEAKERS IN GENERAL
THIS IS ONE
IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WORDS ON YOUR SLIDES YOU NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO READ THEM
THE SPEAKERS THAT TAKE A TIME WHICH IS TOO CLOSE TO THAT THEY ARE NOT GOOD SPEAKER BECAUSE SOME WAY UH UM THEY'RE TALKING TOO FAST
IT'S A BIT UH OF HAVING DIFFICULT AND UH I WOULD NOT UM GO THAT MUCH IN THAT DIRECTION
WELL THAT'S FOR EXAMPLE WITH UH WE SUBMITTED A PROJECT WITH J JEAN MARC UM TO USE THAT THING AS META DATA
BUT BUT UH IF YOU GET THE PROJECT ET CETERA IN ANY CASE IT'S SOMETHING THAT JEAN MARC AND ME WE WANT TO DO
UH
YEAH THAT'S O IT'S ONE OF THE MOST FUNNY THING I MEAN YOU CAN SEE WHEN YOU WORK IN THIS THING
I MEAN S SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE STICK VERY CAREFULLY
IF THE P IF THEY PUT IN THE OUTLINE UH LET'S SAY TITLE ONE TITLE TWO THEN YOU'LL YOU FIND TITLE ONE TITLE TWO
BUT MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE ARE MUCH MORE GENERAL
WE WERE UH FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UM CORPUS OF M. L. M. E. SO THE ONE IS ON THE DEMO
IN THE CORPUS OF THE TAM TWO THOUSAND FOUR TAM PRESENTATION TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PRESENTATION HAVE NO OUTLINE AT ALL
OTHER KIND OF PRESENTATION PROBABLY NO
I MEAN UNFORTUNATELY TH N THERE IS NOTHING TRUE
SO UH THAT WAS ON
ON POSSIBLE WORK
AND SO ESSENTIALLY SAY WELL AS THERE IS THIS SILENCE TIME WHICH TEND TO BE EVEN MORE THAN THAN HOW IT IS
SO BETTER TO HAVE A KIND OF SILENCE DETECTION
THAT'S WHAT IT OF OF COURSE OF COURSE OF COURSE
AND AT THAT POINT EVEN THE UH CALL ROUTER THAT UH JEAN JEAN YVES HAS UH MADE CAN IMPROVE UH ITS PERFORMANCE
UH
THEN OH YEAH YEAH YEAH
I'M LOSI
BASICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT AT UH AT A LEVEL THAT COULD BE ANYWAY
UH
GOING VERY PRA PRAGMATIC UH THERE IS A SUBMISSION UH DEADLINE FOR EXAMPLE THIRTY ONE DECEMBER FOR CONFERENCE ON MULTI MEDIA AND EXPO WHERE I THINK THESE TWO LITTLE WORKS ON
IT'S AS A PROPOSAL
SO THE TAPE IS TA TAPE IS AT THE END
SO WHA FIRST POINT THE FIRST THING YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU TOOK THE SLIDES AND YOU WAS AND YOU HAD A L BIG DICTIONARY AND YOU ARE SEEING UH WHAT WHAT ARE THE INSIDE THE SLIDE
SO WE WHAT'S SO YEAH SO COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME LITTLE BIT MORE IN DETAIL
I I WANT THE NO
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THE WO UH THE TE UH THING LIKE SAYING THAT I TOOK A DICTIONARY AND THEN A WORD FROM THE SLIDE AND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
OKAY BUT DO HOW DO WHY DO YOU WANT CERTAIN WORDS
IT APPEARS IN ALMOST UH UH IT IS IF IT APPEARS IN ALL THE SLIDES IT SAYS A HUNDRED PERCENT CORRELATION FOR ME
ARE LIKE THAT
I'M INTO THE LOOP
BUT IT IS IMPLEMENTED ON THE A. S. R.
ELSE INTERPOLATE EXTRAPOLATE
UH YEAH
SO YOU MEA SO UH YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT UM LIKE WHEN ONE CASE YOU WERE SAYING THAT IF YOU INCLUDE THE CONTEXT AND ALL THOSE THING IT HELPS IN YOUR A. S. R. IMPROVEMENT
SO YOU SO YOU SO OKAY
WHAT ARE THE OTHER SLIDE YEAH
BECAUSE I WANT LIKE KIND OF A UH SO AT FIRST YOU SAID THAT OKAY NOW YOU DID THIS
AND UH UM UH SO UH SO WHAT NEXT IN ON TOP OF IT WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD I MEAN IS THE QUESTION NOW
YEAH SO T I MEAN TO THE DIFFERENT DIRECTION NOW THAT'S WHAT I MEAN TO SAY
UH YEAH
THE THAT'S THAT SHOULD NOT THE PROBLEM
ONE PROBLEM
AND UH SHOULD GO UH IN ONE OR UH ONE D YEAH
UH THE IT MAY BE GOOD AS A C. V. FOR YOU BUT THEN AS A THESIS YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS UH DEFENDING IT AND ALL THOSE THINGS
UH
S SEE THAT IS GOING TO TELL US UH SOMETHING LIKE UH WHA THE THING IS THAT I UH IT IT SEE YOU CAN TOTALLY GO INTO THE TEXT DOMAIN AND BE THERE
BUT IF YOU WANT TO DO WITH UH S LIKE CERTAIN SOMETHING WITH THE SPEED AND ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER THEN IT'S A DIFFERENT SCENARIO
BUT THEN YOU YOU MAKE USE OF THAT TO EXTEND YOUR WORK IN SOME
AND UH AND AS I ALSO T IT DEPENDS LIKE ALSO LIKE I THINK IF UH BOSS IS INTERESTED IN WORKING IN BOTH SPEECH AND TEXT
NO THE BOSS
LIKE HAVE A IT'S LIKE INSTEAD OF SAYING LIKE YOU SHOULD LIKE WORK ON BOTH SIDE YOU KNOW THE TEXT AND THE SPEECH ASPECT OF IT
UH W ONE THING INTERESTING IS WHAT WE CAME UP IN THE DISCUSSION ALSO YOU ABOUT TELLING THAT UH DETECTING SUCH SCENARIOS WHERE THERE IS NO RELATION BETWEEN THE SLIDE AND THE PERSON TALKING
THAT MAY BE ONE GOOD STARTING POINT FOR YOU ACTUALLY
AND THEN AT THAT POINT Y UH YOU DETECT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU SHOW SOMETHING LIKE UH WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT I IF THERE IS UH IF UH THERE I IF IT IS OUT OF DISCUSSION
THE WORDS ARE NO WAY ARE GOING TO HELP YOUR RECOGNITION ANYWAY A. S. R.
THE TH SIDES AND THE TALK
TH YEAH MOST OF THE MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE THE TITLE TO DO NO
THE AMI DAT THE AMI DATA WHAT THAT LIKE THAT ONLY MOST OF THE TIME YOU KNEW THEY HAD THE WORD
WHAT ABOUT M. L. M. I.
AUDIO IS VERY BAD RIGHT
THA THA THA THAT
UH OKAY
SO THEY ARE IS THERE ARE STILL USING THAT UH DESKTOP MICROPHONE OR WHAT OVER THERE
UH
AH
YEAH BUT PROBABLY WE WERE THE F YOU KNOW THE POST UH THE THE THING IS SOMEWHERE PROJECTOR
SO PROBABLY YOU YOU MAY NOT NEED A VERY BIG MICROPHONE EITHER
UH UH YE UH YEAH
UH YEAH
NO THE THEY THE THE THE
YEAH IT'S MORE LIKE TAM
THE THE THEIR COLLECTION IS MUCH UH UH LIKE THEY HAVE UH R. T. N. S AND ALL THOSE THING
PEOPLE SITTING AND UH IT'S A LEC IT'S A LECTURE UH A MEETING COLLECTION
SO SO PROBABLY WE CAN YEAH
S
WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S A FIGURES COMING ON THE SLIDE
ON THE S UH-HUH
IT'S ONE YEAR RIGHT
YOU YOU NEED IT BAD
THAT'S INTE
UH H OH
UH YEAH
UH YE YEAH
YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT TO
MM YE
BUT THE STILL THE REASON WITH THE THE THEY HAD LIKE WHAT ARE THE SYSTEMS WE TRAIN ON DATABASES ARE THEY ARE CHOP NEATLY
OR YOU AND HE CAN UH WE CAN TRY TO USE UH FRANCE TELECOM'S UH APPROACH ACTUALLY
AND THAT UM UH UH THEY THEY HAVE THIS FRONT END WHICH UH UH WHICH WHICH CAN DO A SPECTRAL
PART F PART FROM BASIS IT CAN GIVE
SO SOMETHI WE CAN JUST YEAH WE CAN JUST RUN IT QUICKLY AND SEE
UH NOT RUNNING I MEAN TO SAY P PROBABLY UH HE SHOULD RUN IT OR UH LIKE WE CAN GE HELP HIM TO RUN IT ACTUALLY
UH
BUT PROBABLY UH HE SHOULD RUN IT I MEAN TO SAY
THE ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS PROBABLY
UH THE THEY ARE UH THE SCRI BECAUSE UP TO UH PROBABLY MAYBE WE SHALL DO MM IT YEAH
UH FOR TO MAKE IT FASTER WE SHOULD RU IT RUN MAYBE
IF WE RUN F WE OURSELF IT IT'S VERY FAST
UH YEAH
UH NO
YEAH OH YEAH
NO NO NO NO I THE END POINT SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT THING NO
THAT'S AND WE NEED IT FOR AMI PLUS OTHER THING
AND SO BUT THE I AM TO ALL SAYING YEAH
I I AM
IT'S N IT UH NO NO NO IT'S NOT SPEECH NON SPEECH
ANY ANYTHING NONSENSE OR ELSE IT BEEPED
WHAT DO YOU SAY ALL THI THIS IS OKAY WITH YOU RIGHT
UH YEAH HE STILL YEAH
SO YEAH IT IT'S PRETTY MUCH GOOD TIME ALSO NO
AND HE C HE CAN AND UH WHEN DO YOU INTEND TO START WRITING THE PROPOSAL
S SLOW
UH YES
UH
SEE
AS A RESEARCH REPORT YOU PUT HERE SUBMIT IT FOR THE CONFERENCE
I THINK UH WE WE MAY HAVE TO LIKE IT CAN HAVE A UH IT'S IT'S KIND OF LIKE UH UH MAYBE TAKE LIKE UH UH TWO OR THREE DAYS
YOU KNOW LIKE TO SIT OUT AND SAY UH ONE CONVERGE TO ONE APPROACH AND THEN JUST DO WITHOUT THAT YEAH
WE HAVE TO SORT OUT THE BUG KIND OF THING AND SEE HOW RELIABLE IS THIS END POINT DETECTION FOR US
UH YEAH I THINK UH THEN WE CAN GO BACK TO C. T. S. ACTUALLY
LIKE UH HE WAS TAKING PICTURES PICTURES PICTURES AND IT WAS GOING THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT FORTY EVEN
SO I SAID THERE'S SOME PROBLEM WITH YOURS UH YOUR UH UH THE WAY HE UH PUT THE ROLL INSIDE
FORTY FORTY ONE IS BUT SEE HE HAS ALREADY
UM A LITTLE BIT BUT UH I'M M I'M NOT SURE HE KNOWS UH EVERYTHING
FIRST WE TRIED TO UM EXPLAIN WHY IN THIS UH RESC UH N. BEST LIST RE SCORING UH FROM THE SLIDES TO ENHANCE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION ON THE MEETINGS DATA IS NOT WORKING
AND UH SO WHAT WE DID WITH ALESSANDRO IS UH UM CH T UH PERFORMING SOME STATISTICAL TESTS TO SEE WHATEVER R IF THE IF THE WORDS UH THE THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORDS DURING THE MEETING IS UH IN INDEPENDENT OF THE AP APPEARANCES OF THE DIFFERENT SLIDES
SO THE IN THE CASE IF IT IS DEPENDENT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT CERTAIN WORDS TEND TO APPEAR DURING CERTAIN SLIDES AND THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION AND UH THEN THERE WILL BE UH A REASON LIKE FOR BELIEVING THAT UH THIS WILL WORK
THE RESU THE RESULT WAS NO
IT'S UH WE WERE TALKING THAT WE DID SOME EXPERIMENTS TO SEE IF THE WORD DURING MEETING THE WORDS APPEAR INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SLIDES IN A SENSE THAT UH IF CERTAIN WORDS TEND TO APPEAR DURING CERTAIN SLIDES OR NO
AND I WILL ADD ALSO THAT WE DID THAT ON THE UH W THE WORDS AFTER FILTERING THEM FROM THE REMOVING THE THE STOP WORDS
AND ACTUALLY UH SO WHEN I WAS DOING THE RE SCORING EXPERIMENTS I WAS DOING THAT ON UH ONE MEETING THAT I SELECTED AS BEING LIKE THE BEST LOOKING ONE
UH IT HA IT HAD THE M THE MOST UH SLIDES
AND NOW I DID THE SAME UH ON UH THE OTHER MEETINGS WHICH WERE AVAILABLE WHERE WELL IT'S ONLY THREE MEETINGS BECAUSE WELL HERE THERE ARE FOUR OF THEM WHICH ARE FROM THE TEST SET UH FROM THE AMI RECOGNISER W BUT ONLY THREE OF THEM HAVE UH SLIDES
SO IT'S TOTAL OF THREE MEETINGS AND FOR THE OTHERS THE TENDENCY AND I C 'CAUSE YOU KNOW I WAS WHEN I WAS DOING RE SCORING
AND AS I WAS IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SLIDES WHICH WERE AFFECTING THE THE UTTERANCE I WAS RE SCORING UM THE PERFORMANCE WAS IMPROVING SLI S UH SLIGHTLY
UH THE THE FIRST THING WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EX THE EXPERIMENT TO SEE THE UH IF IT'S DEPENDENT OR INDEPENDENT
UH SO WE USED THE PEARSON UH CHI SQUARE UH TEST NO
AH OKAY
IT WAS TO TO SEE IF UH CERTAIN WORDS HAVE A TENDENCY TO APPEAR DURING UH UH THEY IF THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO APPEAR DURING CERTAIN SLIDES
W
AND S SO WHEN EXTENDING THE THOSE EXPERIMENTS TO THE OTHER MEETINGS UH WHEN WHILE I WAS OBSERVING AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE FIRST MEETING I WAS USING
UH
ON THE ON THE RECOGNITION YEAH
WHILE ON THE OTHER MEETINGS IT'S UM IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY FLUCTUATING AND UH I IT IT UH IT LOOKS MORE LIKE UM UH PS UH WELL
MM WELL FOR NOW THE UH MOST EFFORT WAS UH ON UH UM SHOWING WHY I IT'S I IT'S IT WILL NOT WORK
ESPECIALLY THOSE EXPERIMENTS AND THESE UH STATISTICAL TESTS
BUT UH WE W WERE THINKING FOR EXAMPLE OF A TASK LIKE UM TRYING TO UH SEE IF UH WHERE A SPEAKER IS TALKING I MEAN IF THE SPEECH IS ACTUALLY CORRELATED WITH THE SLIDES UH WHERE THE SLIDES UH WHICH HAPPEN DURING THE NOT CORRELATED
IF THE SPEAKER IS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE SLIDES OR NOT
SO IN THE BEGINNING SO THE MEETING STARTED WITH THE SUMMARY OF WHAT HAPPENED UH PREVIOUS TIME AND THIS WAS NOT RELATED TO WHAT WAS ON THE SLIDES
UH NO
S BUT UH W BUT UH UH BASICALLY JU JUST YOU KNOW IF WE FINISH UH DISCUSSING THIS FIRST
BUT UH UM SOMETHING UM USING THIS RELATIONSHIP UH BETWEEN THE SLIDES UH AND OTHER EVEN OTHER TEK TEXTUAL SUPPORT AND THE UH AND THE SPEECH
UH YEAH
YEAH AND I UM UH
ARE THEY ARE INTERESTED IN THAT OR NO
AMI MEETING
AND WE COULD UH DO AUTOMATICAL UH SPEAKER RATING IF THERE ARE GOOD SPEAKERS OR BAD SPEAKERS DEPENDING IF THEY JUST READ UH
UH ALSO WITH THE TH THINKING MAYBE TURNING THIS UH WORK INTO PUBLICATION THE ONE ABOUT THE FOR SURE
AND UH ALSO UH UH WELL THAT UH DEPENDS A LITTLE ON ON ON YOU
BUT THIS IS BASICALLY DETECTING SPEECH AND NO NON SPEECH
IT'S THIS UH PROBLEM I HEAR EVERY TIME ON THE SPEECH MEETING HOW DO WE DETECT SPEECH AND NOT SPEECH
AH AND UH
OR OH OKAY
BUT WHO REALLY CAN DO UH WHEN SOMEBODY WILL REALLY BE ABLE TO DO THAT
I MEAN DETECT THE SPEECH FROM NON SPEECH IT WILL BE A LITTLE REVOLUTION NO IN THE
AH YEAH YEAH
AH YEAH SURE
BUT UH UH UH SHOULDN'T MAKE IT CLEARER BEFORE ON THE ON THE ON WHAT UH I I WILL WRITE
AND EVEN UH A FIRST UH UH SUBMISSION USING THIS WORK UM WILL MAKE THINGS CLEARER FOR ME UH WRITING THEM DOWN AND F FOR IT WILL HELP I THINK FOR THAT ALSO
YEAH AND I THINK UH THAT WILL BE EXACTLY ONE HOUR AND UH UH FILL THE TAPE
UH THE TAPE IS SIXTY MINUTES
AH SO I WAS RIGHT
AH YEAH
M MY MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL
WEIRD
UH
AH
I TOOK A DOG
AH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS
OH IT'S A SHARK NOW
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE NO
ANNA
OTH YEAH
YOURS IS WELL
THEN PRESS UH AL
OH OH
YOU'RE ON THE KNIFE
UH YEAH
OH A RAT OKAY
AH IT'S A SHARK YEAH
OH WELL
PER PROJECT
OR TH SO YOU ARE THE MARKETING
SO JUST YEAH I WANTED TO TO BE SURE
UH SO YEAH UH JUST UH ON YOUR WEB PAGE BUT UH YEAH NOT UH NOT FACE TO FACE
ACTUALLY YEAH W
UM THEN IF THEY NEED INTERNET THEN WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TO P TO PROPOSE SOMETHING WITH UH UH T. V. OVER I. P.
YEAH BUT W W WE WANT TO DESIGN A NEW ONE
YEAH S YEAH UM
I THIN
UH
LAST
YEAH YOU CAN START IT YOU KNOW
AH YOU FORGET ABOUT IT
MAN THIS WIRES EH
OH THE DOG DOESN'T HAVE A TAIL
AH I THINK YOU CAN PUT THAT
UH
OH Y IT'S NOT FOR THAT
HE HAS ALREADY TO DO CAT
THE CAT IS GOING TO EAT THE FISH OR THE RAT
AH IT'S A BABY SHARK IT LOOKS TO ME YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO EAT THE CAT RATHER THAN THE CAT EATING THE FISH NO
YOU SHOULD GO FOR THE NEXT ONE IT SEEMS TO ME
AH YEAH THE SALE MAN FOUR MILLION
AH WE HAVE TO MAKE WE HAVE TO SELL AT LEAST FOUR MILLION TO MAKE OUR OWN PROFIT
YEAH S AND IT DEPENDS WHAT APPLICATION YOU ARE USING IT FOR
UH
MATTH S UH ANNA
I THI THINK YOU KNOW ME YEAH
YOU'D NEED THE USUAL ONES LIKE THE CHANGING THE VOLUME CHANGING THE THE CHANNEL AND THEN YOU UH TODAY WE HAVE UH UM TELETEXT AND ALL THOSE THINGS
TOMORROW YOU MIGHT HAVE A SOME MORE FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT COME THROUGH THAT SO
YEAH I. P. O. OR
TELEVISION THINGS OR I. P.
AH IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S COMING UP ACTUALLY
THE PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDER AND ALL THOSE THINGS IT IS COMING UP
OH IN THAT CASE YOU CAN YOU ALWAYS HOOK UP WITH UH SOMEONE WHO IS PROVIDING THAT AND YOU KNOW
AH YES
ON THIS NORMAL
DOESN'T APPEAR ON THE SCREEN HERE
UH
YES AND YOU CAN PUT CAN CLIP IT UH ON YOUR
WELCOME AT UH AT THE KICK OFF MEETING OF OUR UH LATEST PROJECT
SO W WE WILL TRY TO STRUCTURE THIS UH MEETING WITH AN A WITH AN AGENDA UH AS PRESENTED HERE
SEE WHAT OUR ROLES ARE IN THIS PROJECT
TO COMMUNICATE AND TO WELL LEARN FROM EACH OTHER'S PLANS UH AS I CAN SAY UM SO W
TO GET ACQUAINTED TO THIS TOOLS SO THEY ARE ALSO NEW TO ME I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU WORKED WITH THEM BEFORE
UM THEN WE WILL COME TO THE UH TO THE TO THE ACTUAL PROJECT PLAN
YOU ALL KNOW I HOPE HOW IT'S ABOUT UH THE UH NEW R REMOTE CONTROL WE ARE GOING GOING TO DESIGN
WH WHAT UH WHAT OUR NEW PRODUCT SHOULD LOOK LITE LIKE
AND UH WELL THEN UH AFTER SOME TWENTY FIVE MINUTES I HOPE UH WE CAN END THIS MEETING
WE WHEN YOU DESIGN A NEW PRODUCT YOU OF UH YOU OF COURSE WANT IT TO BE ORIGINAL
BE UH WE WANT TO BE DISTINGUISHED MM
I MEAN TRENDY IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT SO THEN I W THEY WILL BUY OUR PRODUCT
YOU ALL GET UH UM CERTAIN TASK UH IN THIS UH IN THIS PHASE AND UH
IN ALL IN FRONT OF YOU UH YOU SEE UH THE UH
NOTEBOOKS AND W UH N NOTE BLOCKS AND WE HAVE HERE A
I DIDN'T FIND OUT YET HOW IT WORK BUT MAYBE ONE OF YOU DID SO
YES WELL WE WILL THEN FIND OUT HO HOW IT WORKS
WELL THIS SEEMS TO ME YES SOME COMPUTER PROGRAM BUT I DIDN'T FIND IT YET
SO UH NOW WE WILL TRY OUT THE WHITE BOARD WE HAVE HERE
WELL YES UM WE UH WE SHOULD TRY TO T TO DRAW ON IT AND THEN WELL IT SHOULD BE SMART SOME WAY
THEN HE CAN MAYBE FIND OUT TO GET HIS CORD RIGHT
L WHY DON'T YOU DRAW UH YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL ON ON TH ON THE WHITE BOARD
OH I SEE UH
OH VERY GOOD
MA MATTHEW
I HOPE YOU HAVE SOME SPACE IN YOUR UH THE HORSE OF UH MAEL
LET'S CONTINUE TO UH TO THE REAL STUFF
UH WHEN WE ARE AND WHEN W YOU ARE UH GOING TO DESIGN W UH WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THE SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCT UH WILL BE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
DESIGNING A PROJECT UH I ALSO LOOK AT YOU UH MAEL KEEP IN MIND UH UH UH PEOPLE UH
TO GET AT A INTERNATIONAL MARKET UH SO UM IT WILL BE I THINK MAINLY EUROPE AND UH NORTHERN AMERICA
UM ALSO IMPORTANT FOR YOU ALL IS UM THE THE PRODUCT UH PRODUCTION COST MUST BE MAXIMAL UH TWELVE UH TWELVE EURO AND FIFTY CENTS
UH IN PRINCIPLE IT HAS ENOUGH CUSTOMERS UH SO WHEN WE HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT WE UH WE COULD UH MEET THIS THIS AIM I THINK
WE WER WE WERE THINKING TELEVISION
UH
TH TH THAT'S VERY HANDY I I ALWAYS MISS IT AND ON SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT YOU CAN GO CHANNEL UP OR DOWN INS INSTEAD OF RETYPING THE NUMBER
S
S S
SO THE BROWSE FUNCTION AS YOU M MENTIONED
UH W Y YOU TWO SHOULD SHOULD I THINK THINK THIS OVER UH W ESPEC WHAT WHAT FUNCTIONALITY
KEEP K KEEP IN MIND I IT'S A IT'S A TWENTY FIVE EURO UNIT SO UH UH THE THE VERY FANCY STUFF UH
W WE CAN LEAVE THAT OUT I THINK
SO TWENTY FIVE EURO YOU EXPECT A QUITE WELL NORMAL BUT GOOD FUNCTIONING USER FRIENDLY REMOTE CONTROL
YES BUT BUT BUT AB ABOUT THE SPEC THE BUTTONS THE BUTTONS UH THAT WILL BE ON IT
I I THINK WE CAN DISCUSS THAT IN THE IN THE NEXT MEETING
WELL UH YOU WOR YES WORK ON A DESIGN
KEEP IT GENERAL I MEAN SO W WE WILL BE STILL FLE FLEXIBLE WITH MAYBE ADDING SOME FUNCTIONS
YOU WILL BE WORKING ON ON
AND UH YOU AND YOU AND UH UH UH WELL THINK ABOUT REQUIREMENTS EH
DOES IT NEED INTERNET OR OR DO DO WE STAY AT
WELL I'VE JUST BEEN UM PRESENTED WITH SOME RESEARCH WE'VE DONE IN A SMALL FOCUS GROUP SO A HUNDRED PEOPLE
UH
I HAVE AN A WEB PAGE YES
SO BASICALLY UM THERE'S A BREAKDOWN OF HOW MUCH THEY USE THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ON A REM REMOTE CONTROL
TELETEXT IS USED UM FOURTEEN TIMES IN THE HOUR SO IT IS USED BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED
AN INTERESTING THING THAT THIS REPORT HAS BROUGHT UP IS THAT UM FIFTY FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS REPORT THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL GETS LOST A LOT OF THE TIME IN THE ROOM
THIRTY FOUR PERCENT SAID IT TOOK TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN TO USE A NEW ONE
UH I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY IF I EMAIL IT TO YOU NOW
OH I NEED TO MUCK AROUND WITH THIS
IT'S PROBABLY EASIER IF YOU PUT IT ON YOURS AND THEN I'LL JUST EMAIL IT TO YOU
I THINK EVEN FOR INTERESTI YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD NOT WORK SO WELL
SO THAT'S THE FIGURE THAT I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THERE WITH THE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS
YOU DREW IT A LONG TIME AGO
AH
SO IF THE B T. V. IN THE NEXT APARTMENT'S REALLY LOUD YOU CAN JUST TURN IT OFF
SO YOU ON MY ONE AT HOME I'VE GOT A V. C. R. REMOTE WHICH THEN CHANGES THE CHANNEL ON THE V. C. R. AND DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ON THE T. V.
SO IS IT GONNA BE LIKE A SWITCH ON THE REMOTE THAT SAYS T USE THE T. V. OR USE THE V. C. R.
OR DOES IT KNOW WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO USE
BECAUSE Y
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE MORE FUNCTIONALITY 'CAUSE IT'S ONLY A LOW MARKET IT'S A CHEAP END REMOTE CONTROL
WE CAN'T BEAT MODERN FUNCTIONALITY WE MIGHT WE'LL BE ABLE TO BEAT THEM ON TH THE LOOK OF IT
TH THE DESIGN OF IT BUT THAT'S NOT A BIG SELLER
BUT WHY ARE THEY BUYING ONE IN THE FIRST PLACE
I'VE GOT FRIENDS WHO'VE GOT SO MANY THINGS THEY NEED A UNIVERSAL REMOTE OTHERWISE THEY'RE USING FIVE DIFFERENT REMOTES FOR THEIR ALL THEIR THINGS
IN THAT CASE THEY WOULDN'T BUY OUR PRODUCT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED IN TERMS OF FUNCTIONALITY
AND QUITE COMPLICATED TO USE YES
NOT AS FLEXIBLE MAYBE YEAH BUT S YEAH
BUT IF WE'RE GOING FOR THE SAY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE AGE GROUP THEN NOT MANY OF THEM WOULD ACTUALLY OWN T. V. S TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL ON
I DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT THE THE PRICE RANGE FOR REMOTE CONTROLS IS
SO I GUESS WHAT I'D LIKE FROM A UNIVERSAL REMOTE IS MAYBE CHOOSING BETWEEN THREE DEVICES
AND JUST BE ABLE TO S USE THEM ALL FROM THE SAME REMOTE BUT NOT AT THE SAME TIME
SO Y YOU ARE THE SECRETARY ALSO
OH THE CUSTOMERS OKAY
MAYBE Y Y YOU CANNOT PUT THIS WEBPAGE ONLINE ON THE
AH IT'S IT OKAY IT'S A WEBPAGE ON THE C. IT'S A FILE OKAY
O OTHERWISE YOU YEAH
BECAUSE IF THERE ARE MANY NUMBERS AND WE NEED TO SELECT TO TO CONSTRAINT UH OUR DESIGN BASED ON WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT
SPEECH RECOGNITION IN
AH OKAY
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE STATE OF THE ART OF SPEECH RECOGNITION IS MAYBE YOU KNOW
I THI YOU US YEAH YEAH
SO I THINK AS EVERYBODY KNOWS UH I'M THE UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
AND SO AN ENERGY SOURCE FEEDS AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT THE CHIP THAT CAN COMPOSE MESSAGES
SO MY METHOD FOR UM DESIGNING THE YEAH THE WORK DESIGN UH YEAH FIRST THE THE MAIN POINT IS THAT I WOULD WISH TO TO MAKE A REALLY FUNCTIONAL PRODUCT
SO FOR THAT YEAH AS IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE USER REQUIREMENTS FROM THE MARKETING UH EXPERT UH ANNA AND UM
W TO TO WE SHOULD AGREE ON WHAT ARE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS UH FOR THIS REMOTE CONTROL AND I SHOW YOU THE THE WORKING DESIGN
UH WE WANT AN ON OFF BUTTON IT CAN BE UH IT'S SIMPLE BUT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT
IS THAT IN THIS PART YOU HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL THE THE SENDER AND ON THE OTHER PART THE RECEIVER SO THAT'S MY METHOD IS UM WILL BE TO WELL MY AIM WOULD BE TO UH DESIGN THE AND CHOOSE THE CHIPS AND THE INFRARED UM COMPONENTS TO BUILD THE REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT
THIS IS VERY QUICK UH DESIGN UH YOU STOP ME OR INTERRUPT ME IF UH YOU DON'T AGREE ON IT ON THAT
AND UM SO WHAT I HAVE FOUND AND AFTER A LOT OF WORK ACTUALLY I I DRAW THIS I DRAW FOR YOU THIS UH SCHEMA THAT CAN BE MAYBE TOO TECHNICAL FOR YOU BUT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME YOU KNOW
YEAH TH YOU HAVE ALWAYS A COMPROMISE WITH UH RELIABILITY AND UH I IF IT'S EXPENSIVE
WE WILL USE UH INFRARED PROTOCOL UH USING YEAH INFRARED AND UH
AND OF COURSE WE NEED TO ADAPT TO THAT PROTOCOL THAT ALREADY EXISTS AND BUT WE WHAT WE CAN DO IS UH UH ADAPTING THE THE CHIPS INSIDE UH TO THE BEST UH CHIPS AND UH INFRARED BUBBLES
OF COURSE YEAH IN THE CHIP YOU HAVE IT YEAH
OF COURSE YEAH WE SHOULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT IN THE UH
YEAH WE HAVE YEAH TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS UH PER UH PER R. S R. C. AND I THINK UH WITH THIS NOW YOU KNOW THAT CHIPS ARE VERY UH CHEAPS AND UH WE CAN INCLUDE IT IN OUR CONTROL SOME NEW NEW FEATURES
YE
I DON'T THINK L. C. D. IS NOT NECESSARY WELL TH FOR LONG TERM
YEAH BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT WE ARE GONNA B WE ARE GONNA SELL UH FOUR ARO AROUND FOUR MILLION SO WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT THESE NUMBERS UH THE PRICE OF A CHIP IS UH PRICE OF A CHIP IS VERY CHEAP
SO I'M OKAY FOR DESIGNING UM A NE UH LESS YEAH A A KIND OF UNIVERSAL UH R. C. YEAH
IS THAT OKAY FOR YOU
WELL IT WOULD BE F
IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE LI IT'S NOT GOING TO BE S SO EASY BUT
CASE BUT IT'S BUT I DON'T KNOW WITH TWENTY FI
IT'S A CHANNEL SELECTION A MODULE THIS AND THIS FUNCTION GO TO THE
BUT IS IT UH CAN YOU JUST BUY IT ON THE MARKET AND F PLUG IT IN OR YOU WANT TO MA
WELL IT TO DU IT'S JUST YOU HAD TO CHANGE THE FREQUENCIES
YEAH SO YOU CAN JUST GO ON THE STREET AND THEN SWITCH OFF EVERYONE'S T. V. AND YOU CAN JUST WALK AWAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NEAR THE T. V. AT ALL
HMM I CAN TAKE MINE IT'S OKAY VOILA MM SO MM
IT'S ON THE DESKTOP
I THINK MY LAST PRESENTED WHAT IS GOING INSIDE SO WHAT'S THE USER IS GOING TO SEE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND HOW HE IS GOING TO USE IT
SO WELL THE APPROACH IS THAT UH
AND IT WILL BE DECODED BY THE T. V. AND USUALLY WE IT IS EASIER TO HAVE UH KEYS OR BUTTONS WITH WHICH PEOPLE CAN UH PRESS AND THEN UM CHANGING A BUTTON WILL BASICALLY UH CHANGE THE MESSAGE WHICH IS BEING SENT TO THE T. V. AND UH UM A AND BASICALLY IT SENDS AN INTERNAL SIGNAL AND DECODED BY THE RECEIVER
SO P AS UM ANNA HAS SAID THAT THIS KI PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THINGS WHICH ARE YOU DON'T NEED TO K PRESS THE KEYS
PEOPLE ARE CAN HAVE A SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT THIS IS UH S A QUESTION WHICH WILL WE HAVE TO SEE LATER
AND UM SO GENERALLY MM I DON'T HAVE SOME FIGURES SORRY BUT UM SO THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF UH REMOTE IF YOU POPULARLY IN THE HOUSEHOLD
AND IF YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE RIGH RIGHT NOW UH UH EVEN THE ONE UH ON MORE THAN ONE DIGIT OPTION IS FOR TWO DIGIT CHANNEL WHICH IS LIKE NINETY NINE
BUT IT THEN IT HAS OTHER OPTIONS LIKE STOP UH AND THEN YOU PLAY THE MOVIE OR UH OR FO FAST FORWARD THE MOVIE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO I IT HAS THOSE SO THESE ARE THE STANDARD UH COMMONLY FOUND REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE UH MARKET
AND THEN WELL PERSONAL PREFERENCES I WOULD UH BASICALLY THINK OF HAVING A KIND OF AIM FOR THE NEXT GENERATION THING WHERE THE WE COULD HAVE BOTH THE UH THE F A T. V. AND THE REMOTE VIDEO REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE UH SOME OF THE KEYS IN THE VIDEO'S REMOTE CONTROL AND THE T. V. THEY COULD BE INTEGRATED TOGETHER SO THAT UH WE COULD UM AIM FOR THE LIKE IN THE F COMING FUTURE UM THAT TYPE OF UH APPLICATIONS WITH
UM ACTUALLY UM YOU COULD YOU COULD THINK OF UM HAVING S A Y YOU CAN HAVE A KEY WHICH COULD TELL Y IT COULD GO TO THE VIDEO THING BUT UM UH YO YOU YOU YOU STILL CAN'T UM IN THAT CASE WHEN IT YOU USE THAT THE FUNCTION SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE UP THE V. C. R. OPTION AND YOU COULD PLAY IT OR YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT HAVING LIKE UM
I IN A FEW DAYS YOU WILL BE HA IN IN FEW YE COMING YEARS YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE A SEPARATE UH SITTING SETUP BOX AND UH YOU HAVE UH UM SOMETHING LIKE UH UH YOU DO YOU DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO WATCH SOME PROGRAMME AND ACTUALLY IT DOWNLOADING ALL THE TIME FOR YOU AND UH YOU CAN JUST YOU KNOW UH WHEN YOU COME BACK YOU COULD JUST SWITCH ON THAT THING AND UH WATCH A PROGRAM
IN THAT CASE YOU WANT TO BROWSE FASTER BROWSE SLOW YOU WANT TO HAVE THOSE KIND OF FUNCTIONALITIES
IT'S THE NEXT GENERATION THING BUT IT IS GOING TO COME IN COUPLE OF YEARS
IT'S GOI
SO IT'S GOING TO RECORD YOUR THINGS AND YOU AND YOU YOU NEED BASICALLY THE FUNCTIONALITIES WHAT YOU NEED IN BOTH UH UH VIDEO AS WELL AS IN THE STANDARD T. V. THING
SO WE CAN ALWAYS DISCUSS ABOUT IT FOR EXAMPLE UH THE PRESENTLY THE VIDEO MARKET ACTUALLY UH THIS DEMAND VIDEO OVER DEMAND OR WHAT WE CALL IT AS
IT'S PRESENTLY BOOMING UP ACTUALLY SO IT I LIKE PEOPLE ARE PROVIDING LIKE UH THINGS LIKE UH UH MOVIES
AND IT BASICALLY YOU GO OFF IT DOWNLOADS THE MOVIE IT GIVES FOR YOU AND THEN WHEN YOU COME YOU WANT TO LOO WATCH IT ON YOUR T. V.
AND THI THIS IS GOING TO COME
YEAH IT'S UH WELL YOU YOU CAN FOLLOW THE IDEAS HOW YOU WANT TO KEEP THE KEYS
THREE LIKE A KEYS SEPARATELY BUT SUPPOSE IF YOU TAKE THE THE PRESENT TREND OF MOBILE PHONES THERE ARE LIKE BIG THICK KEYS YOU PRESS ON THE TOP
AND UH BASICALLY UH UH SO THE SPACE COVERED SO THAT YOU DON'T SEE TWO SEPARATE KEYS THERE ACTUALLY SO IT IT IS LIKE UH UM I I IT IS LIKE UH
THREE LIKE THIS ACTUALLY AND UH UH FOUR FIVE SIX LIKE THAT AND UH YOU CAN HAVE KEYS LIKE THIS IN FORM LIKE
YEAH SO YOU YOU YOU CAN HAVE UH KEYS LIKE UH WHICH ARE WHICH ARE LIKE SO
TOO SORRY SO WE BASICALLY DON'T CHANGE THE UH ORIGINAL ORDER OF THEM BUT THEN THE KEYS ARE MORE SPACIOUS
THEY DON'T LOOK UH SO THERE THERE IS A VERY SLIGH THING SO IF YOU PRESS ON THE TOP IT TAKES THE ONE
IT TAKES THE THREE UH FOUR SORRY FOUR HERE UH FIVE AND SIX
SO THE KEYS CAN BE IT LOOKS YOU KNOW NOT VERY MUCH CLUTTERED BUT IT LOOKS NICE FOR YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY KEYS BUT YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS T IF YOU PRESS ON THE TO
WELL I IT'S FINE WITH ME LIKE THE PRICE AS LONG AS IT IS UH NOT TOO EXPENSIVE
UH AND IT D UH
UH YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE NEEDED BASICALLY
UH THAT'S NEEDED RIGHT NOW
AND UH BASICALLY YOU CAN LOOK TO THE STANDARDS OF OTHER
ACTU
OH I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW
YEAH SO WE MEET IN WELL WHAT ARE OUR
SO SEE YOU LATER
THE I WILL UH
TO YOU
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE
I'VE ALSO MADE NOTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING AND UM I WAS ABOUT TO SEND THEM YOU BUT THEN UH I HAD TO GO TO THIS UH MEETING SO YOU WILL GET THEM TOO UH
THEN I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE UH WORKED OUT SOME SOME UH SOME SOME PRESENTATIONS ABOUT UH ABOUT WELL YOU THE THE TASK GIVEN TO YOU IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING
W WE WILL UH IN A MINUTE WE WILL UH START WITH THEM
I TRY TO WORK THEM OUT THEY WERE QUITE ABSTRACT AND WE CAN HAVE MAYBE HAVE COM SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT IT
UH UM ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS AND WELL IN THIS MEETING WE SHOULD REALLY TRY TO REACH A DECISION ABOUT THE TARGET GROUP
YES I MEAN WELL YES W WHO ARE WE GOING TO UH TO WELL TO SELL THIS THE CUSTOMERS INDEED YES
UH
YES YES MAYBE MAYBE YOU CAN UH CAN JUST TALK ABOUT IT OR MAYBE YOU CAN USE THE WHITEBOARD IF NECESSARY UM
YES YES I HAVE THAT TOO
D DO YOU HAVE NUMBERS O O ON THAT
UH I THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IT IS MY WELL IT'S WE SHOULD BE IN RANGE
OR MAYBE IT CAN RESPOND AND PRODUCE SOUND SO SAY WHERE IT IS
BUT THE THESE ARE ALL QUITE FANCY FEATURES I'M NOT SURE WHETHER
OH THIS IS
YOU CAN YOU CAN SA TAKE MY CHAIR
IS HUH
AND AND WHY DO YOU WANT THESE KIND OF COMPONENT
WHAT I W WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT UH THE THE THE SCHEMA UH ABOUT UH THE SENDER AND THE RECEIVER
YEAH UH THE RECEIVER IS OF COURSE ALREADY IN THE TELEVISION AND WE ARE NOT UH ABLE TO CHANGE IT
SO WE WE MUST ADAPT TO THE TO THE RECEIVER
I I FEEL I I I THINK M MAEL WILL WILL CONSIDER THIS UH TH THESE THINGS
UH OKAY
UH SORRY
MM YES BUT I THINK IT'S I I IT'S ALREADY THERE I MEAN THE HARD DISK UH RECORDERS UH I I'VE SEEN THEM IN THE SHOP
W W W W WE NEED TO DECIDE ON ON ON ON IN HOW FAR WE GO TO IN THIS
MEAN YOU CAN GO PRETTY FAR I F I THINK WITH WITH WITH FUNCTIONS AND POSSIBLE UH FUTURE P UH PROSPECTS YES
DO WE INCLUDE IT AND DO WE GIVE IT A PROMINENT UH PROMINENT UH PLACE ON ON ON THE ON WELL HUH
ON THE REMOTE MOT CONTROL ITSELF
UH AS UH A IN ANY CASE IT'S IT'S NOT USED WELL VERY MUCH BUT IT'S IT IS STILL USED
THE TELEVISION AS WE AS WE ALL KNOW IT WITH WITH BROADCASTING SIGNALS AND YOU CAN'T GO BACK UH-HUH
W WE NEED REALLY NEED TO INTEREST UH Y YOUNGER CUSTOMERS AND THEN WITH YOUNGER CUSTOMERS I MEAN PEOPLE UH BELOW THE AGE OF FORTY
AND OUR OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS ARE MAINLY FORTY PLUS UH WHICH WELL FORTY
SO THAT'S TO THAT'S I MEAN THERE'S A MARKET BUT UH THEY WILL GROW OLDER OLDER AND YOU'LL AL ALWAYS NEED TO HAVE THE THE FUTURE WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE
MAKE OUR OUR OUR R. C. AS TRENDY AS POSSIBLE BUT
IT SHOULD ALSO BE UH HAVE A RELIABLE IMAGE SO WHEN IT LOOKS TOO TOO SPACEY OR TOO FANCY PEOPLE WILL THINK WELL DOES IT WORK AT ALL
MA MAYBE MAYBE YOU CAN DRAW IT ON THE ON THE BOARD UH
YES YES MO
UH THANK YOU
UH WE SHOULD NOW UH TRY TO DECIDE UM ON OUR TARGET GROUP
OF COURSE THEY HAVE ALREADY ONE
I WELL I THINK MANY PEOPLE SAID UH IN YOUR IN IN YOUR RESEARCH UH UH
SO THAT WILL BE ABOUT
IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN
I THINK THI THIS COULD BE THIS COULD BE A MARKET BECAUSE UH UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROLS UH TEND TO BE UH QUITE EXPENSIVE
S SO WE CAN TRY TO GO IN BETWEEN AND OFFER A PRODUCT WHICH IS NOT AS EXPENSIVE AND NOT AS
MM YES BUT W WE'RE TARGETING I THINK ON MORE ON THE ON THE TWENTY TO FORTY GROUP
WHO JUST HAVE OR ALREADY HAVE A JOB AND HAVE THE MONEY BUT
MAY NOT WANT TO SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY ON A ON A UNIVERSAL UNIVERSAL CONTROL
I THINK UH WHEN WE THINK IT OVER I THI I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO OFFER THE A KIND OF UNIVERSAL CONTROL FOR FOR LESS MONEY
UH UNIVERSAL TYPE UH M MAYBE IT IS GOOD WHEN YOU TRY TO FIND OUT WHICH COMPONENTS YOU THEREFORE NEED AND Y YOU WILL TRY TO GET MORE SPECIFIC UH USER INTERFACE CONTENT AND UH MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK ON ON WHAT TRENDS ARE IN THIS UH IN THIS TYPE OF MARKET
THEN TH
TH THE NEXT MEETING WILL UH AFTER LUNCH YOU HAVE UH WE HAVE
NU
OKAY IT SHOULD'VE GONE THROUGH TO YOU
UM CAN I JUST PUT THIS ON
SO WE HAVE TO WORK OUT A WAY WHAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR PRODUCT TO MAKE IT STAND OUT AND MAKE IT SO PEOPLE WANNA BUY IT
WE BASICALLY USED UM SOME FOCUS GROUP SURVEYS WHICH I WENT THROUGH WITH YOU LAST TIME THE MAIN RESULTS OF THAT
THAT WAS TWICE AS I IMPORTANT AS THE NEXT ITEM ON HERE WHICH IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE HAS TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
APART FROM JUST THE LOOK OF IT
THIRD ON THE LIST AND AGAIN INNOVATIVE WAS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THIS LAST UM ASPECT IT HAS TO BE EASY TO USE
THIS IS BASICALLY TALKING ABOUT JUST THE THE FEEL OF IT SO PROBABLY NOT THE SMELL OF IT BUT THE BRIGHT COLOURS
UM I HAD A TALK TO THE DESIGN PEOPLE ABOUT THIS BUT HAVING A REMOTE THAT'S TACTILE THAT FEELS DIFFERENT THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL
WELL MA MAKE IT NOT NECESSAR SP SPONGY IS THE CURRENT THING
SPONGY IS THE CURRENT TEXTURE BUT BASICALLY THERE ARE NO REPORTS NO REMOTES AT THE MOMENT WHICH ARE SPONGY OR TACTILE AT ALL
THAT'LL BE SOMETHING THAT SETS IT APART RATHER THAN JUST BARE PLASTIC WHICH THEY ALL ARE AT THE MOMENT
SO AS FAR AS THE DESIGN GOES THE VERY MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT WAS THE DESIGN TO THE CUSTOMERS
SO GOING WITH THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE IDEA WE'VE GOT THE BRIGHT COLOURS SO MAKES IT STAND OUT
THEY'VE ALL GOT THOSE A LOT OF THEM HAVE THE CHANGEABLE COVERS SO THEY CAN CHOOSE WHAT COLOUR THE OUTSIDE IS
SO THEY CAN CHOOSE IT LI AS THEY WANT TO TO MAYBE TO FIT IN WITH THEIR DECOR IN THEIR LIVING ROOM
PEOPLE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THAT SO WE CAN LEVERAGE OFF THAT AND WE CAN START USING SOME OF THEIR IDEAS
UM WE TALKED ABOUT HAVING A WAY OF FINDING A REMOTE CONTROL IF IT'S BEEN LOST UH THAT'S ONE THING WE COULD LOOK AT
USE
I HAD NO REAL SPECIFIC IDEAS FOR THIS MAYBE WE JUST THE BASIC IDEA OF HAVING YOUR CORE FUNCTIONS BIG AND AT THE TOP MAYBE
BY THEMSELVES AND THEN YEAH AND THEN TH TH THE FINER DETAILS OF BUTTONS YOU DON'T USE AS MUCH EITHER HIDDEN AWAY OR COMPLETELY SEPARATE
SO DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR IDEAS ON THAT
I LIKE THE IDEA THOUGH OF HAVING SPEECH RECOGNITION FOR LIKE THE N THE NAME OF A CHANNEL LIKE B. B. C.
RATHER THAN HAVING TO REMEMBER THE THE NUMBER OF IT ON THE KEYPAD
MM B
YOU CAN HAVE IT SO IT'S EASY THEY CAN PICK IT UP AND USE IT STRAIGHT AWAY WITHOUT DOING ANYTHI WITHOUT CUSTOMIZING IT
I LIKE THE IDEA TOO OF BEING ABLE TO USE THE REMOTE IN THE DARK
SO EITHER HAVING THE BUTTONS SO YOU CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM OR IF THEY IF THEY LIGHT UP OR SOMETHING
ACTUALLY DO MAYBE TWO DESIGNS AND THEN COST THEM OUT AND SEE WHICH ONE IS GONNA FIT IN OUR BUDGET BETTER
SO IS THERE ANY OF THESE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT PARTICULARLY OR IS THIS JUST IDEAS
MM WELL ONE I'VE HAD BEFORE
A R R REMOTE CONTROL WE HAVE AT HOME IS ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY GOT A COVER ON THE BOTTOM SO THE BOTTOM BIT IS JUST
UM YEAH I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE TOO
CAN WE HAVE CAN WE THINK ABOUT MAYBE HAVING A A NON RECTA NON NON RECTANGULAR ONE SO WITH NOT JUST THE STRAIGHT LITTLE BOX THAT'S A MAYBE CURVED OR SOMETHING
IS THIS FOR THE NEXT MEETING THOUGH
SO IS THIS IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO DO FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW FOR THE NEXT MEETING
OKAY WELL IS THIS ME DESIGNING A WAY TO EVALUATE IT SO
YEAH I THINK YEAH THE MATTHEW IT IS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT MATTHEW YEAH IS HERE BECAUSE
IT'S REALLY A A TEAM UH PROJECT WITH A TEAM AND IF SOMEONE IS NOT HERE THEN WE CANNOT BUT IT'S OKAY IT'S GOOD
UH ABOUT THE FEELING YEAH UH YO
TO LET THE PEOPLE CHOOSE YOU MEAN
AND YOUR PART IS VERY RELATED TO MINE BECAUSE WHEN YOU SUGGEST SOMETHING THEN IT HAS TO BE INTEGRATED INSIDE
BUT FOR THE A. S. R. SYSTEM UH I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S FEASIBLE TO HAVE THIS OR
EXACTLY YEAH I IF IF IT'S A LOW VOCABULARY IT'S ALREADY IMPLEMENTED AND W HOW MUCH IT'S COST MAYBE WITH A F CHEAP CHIP
SO THE METHOD IS THER THERE IS A A SET OF COMPONENTS IN A IN A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE
AND UH WHAT COST THE THE COMPONENTS IN THEMSELF DO NOT COST A LOT BUT THE THE WAY TO ASSEMBLE EVERYTHING COSTS OBVIOUSLY
UH THE BASIC WAY IS TO USE A AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT AND SOME UH TRANSISTORS WITH AN THAT AIMS AT COMMUNICATING UH UH THE MESSAGE AND TO TO SEND THE MESSAGE TO THE UM TO THE LED THAT WILL UH TRANSMIT TO THE RECEIVER
SO YOU FINDING JUST TO SAY THAT THE CHIP CAN DETECT UH WHEN A KEY IS PRESSED AND THEN IT TRANSLATE TO THE KEY
TO A SEQUENCE SOMETHING LIKE MORSE CODE AS YOU KNOW UH WITH A DIFFERENT SEQUENCE FOR EACH KEY
AND UH UH THAT'S WITH THE COMPONENTS WE WILL USE WE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT UH MESSAGES DIFFERENT SEQUENCES
AND UH SO I THINK FOR OUR DESIGN WE WANT SOME B UH PROGRAMMABLE UH YOU KNOW V. V. L. S. I. OR F. P. G. A. UH HIGH TECHNOLOGY
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT AND ALSO WE'LL USE UH YEAH LIKE IN ANY UH HIGH TECH UH DEVICES A CHIP OF FI FIBREGLASS TO THEM AND CONNECT THEM
SO THEY ALSO EMAILED ME THAT UH THEY HAVE AVAILABLE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS A SCROLL WHEELS INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTONS S SUCH AS A COMPUTER MOUSE
AND THE FINAL POINT OKAY IS UM WE HAVE YEAH THERE ARE SOME UH COMPROMISE TO TO DO
AND THE DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP WHICH IN TURNS IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE REGULAR CHIP
THEN I THINK W WE COULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT
SO TO TO SUM UP UM
AND UH FOR THE DESIGNING OF THE COVE UH UH COVER LAYOUT THEN IT'S BETTER TO TO TO MAYBE SEE THAT WITH UH THE THE U. R. EXP U. R. I. EXPERT SO THAT WE CAN IT'S REALLY A TEAM WORKING UH
EXACTLY YEAH THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA WE COULD HAVE UH ONE MAIN CHIP UH THAT COULD HANDLE UH IT'S CALLED F. P. G. A. CHIP
THAT COULD HANDLE BOTH UH LIKE SCROLLING WHEELS AS WELL AS UH L. C. D. AND YEAH
YEAH ALSO THINKING I THINK BOTH UH IF WE HAD A BUDGET OF TWENTY TWENTY UH EUROS IT WILL BE OKAY BUT UH
AND WE NEED MAYBE TO CENTRE OUR DESCRIPTION ON UH THE THE REALLY THE WHAT BUTTONS WHAT UH FUNCTIONALITY WE WANT TO OFFER TO THE USER
AND MAYBE WITH UH GRAPHS OR I DON'T KNOW UH USER INTERFACE DESIGNER YOU COULD MAYBE UH HELP US ON THAT
I AGREE YEAH AND NOT TOO M TOO MANY KEYS OF COURSE YEAH
THE POINT IS W MAYBE WE NEED TO ALSO TO MAKE A DECISION ON HOW HOW HOW BIG WE WANT TO BE AND HOW MANY BUTTONS LIKE N WE SHOULD DEC DECIDE NUMBERS OR
YEAH S THEN WE COULD DISCUSS LATER LIKE WE CAN PUT ALL IDEAS TOGETHER
OKAY SO M SO THEN THE THE IDEA OF UH HAVING A REMOTE IS GENERALLY YOU HAVE UH DIFFERENT KEYS AND UH DIFFERENT STRUCTURES DIFFERENT FORMS
AND UH THEY COULD BE LIKE BUTTONS OR LIKE AND UM THEY COULD BE OF UH A VARYING SIZES IF YOU WANT TO TO UH BASICALLY EMPHASIZE A PARTICULAR KEY MORE THAN THE OTHER
SO THIS THIS IS THE GENERAL TREND TO HA THE METHOD THEY DO
SO WHAT I HAVE FOUND WAS THAT UH CURRENTLY UH THE THEY ARE MOSTLY THAT THE T. V.
BUT THERE ARE SOME COMMON KEYS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE V. C. R. AND IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE UH G UH S SOME UH SOUNDTRACK ON THE W W SEE THEY HAVE THE COMMON THING ACTUALLY YOU CAN HAVE AND UH
V. C. R. OR SOMETHING I SAY IT TO THE T. V. AND THE T. V.
AND YOU CAN PROGRAMME THE KEYS IF YOU WANT TO CERTAIN KEYS ARE EVEN THE CHANNEL INFORMATION
YEAH YEAH SO YOU YOU YOU CAN JUST UH BECAUSE UH AS MORE AND MORE CHANNELS COME THEN YOU HAVE MORE AND MORE PROBLEMS TO REMEMBER THE V V EXACT CHANNEL NUMBERS EX EXACTLY
EVEN IF YOU ARRANGE IT BY HOWEVER YOU ARRANGE IT YOU STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM TO REMEMBER EXACTLY WHICH CHANNEL YOU WANT TO
EIGHTY WORD WHICH SHOULDN'T BE TH THAT DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT LIKE EIGHTY TO HUNDRED WORD
SO I AM USING THE T. V. SO
EVERY TIME I USE IT IT COULD BE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I CAN USE A SIMPLE TOGGLE SWITCH
AND A DISPLAY SO I PRESS IT SO THE DISPLAY SAYS OKAY I'M IN T. V. OR D. V. D. OR WHATEVER IT IS
INSTEAD OF HAVING THREE KEYS SEPARATELY FOR FOUR KEYS TO MODEL THE FUNCTIONALITIES WILL INCREASE ACTUALLY
AND UH WELL THERE CAN BE CHILDREN FRIENDLY WHERE YOU CAN PROGRAMME YOUR REMOTE SO THAT THEY THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED UH TO BROWSE CERTAIN CHANNELS WHICH YOU CAN BLOCK THEM
I PERSONALLY WOULD LOOK AT THINGS LIKE HAVING A U UNIVERSAL REMOTE IS UH UM IS A GOOD IDEA
I GOT A MAIL FROM THE THE COFFEE MACHINE INTERFACE UNIT THAT UH THEY HAVE UH INTEGRATED THE S SPEECH RECOGNITION INTO A INTO THE COFFEE MACHINE
AND SO IF YOU SAY HELLO COFFEE MACHINE IT SAY HI JOE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AND UH
ON THE DISPLAY FOR THE BROWSING WHICH IS AGAIN AND MAYBE HAVING SOMETHING LIKE A BLINKING THING
LIKE UH IT COULD INDICATE YOU'RE UH IT IT COULD INDICATE WHAT IS CAL LIKE THE UH WHETHER UH YOU YOU HAVE ENOUGH BATTERY IN YOUR IN YOUR UH REMOTE
N NO BUT THE IF YOU GIVE IT D DEPENDS ON THE EASINESS LIKE THE USER HOW MUCH EFFORT HE CAN PUT
SO IF YOU WANT TO GIVE THE FULL FREEDOM TO THE USER OR YOU WANT TO KEEP SOME CONSTRAINTS AND LET THE USER USE IT WITH THAT CONSTRAINT
SO IT DE
WE WELL WE CAN STILL LOOK AT WE CAN TALK WITH THE COFFEE UNIT AND YOU CAN UH CHECK HOW MUCH HOW MUCH THEY YEAH YEAH YEAH
MAYBE WE CAN COME WE WE CAN TALK TO THEM AND WE CAN COME WITH THAT YOU KNOW
LIKE IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY AND ALL THOSE THINGS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE STANDARD REMOTE
WHICH IS HAVING UH WHICH NEED JUST UH SIX SIX VOLT UH TH SORRY THREE VOLTS UM OF D. C.
IT MAY NEED MORE ACTUALLY SO Y YOU YOU MAY NEED TO CHECK YOUR BATTERY USAGE IT AND THEN YOU NEED THAT
AND THEN IF THE BATTERY LIMIT IS INDICATED
IF IT COULD BE IND INDICATED THROUGH A BLINKING SOMETHING AND IT CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR DEPENDING ON YOUR UH HOW MUCH IS THE BATTERY
WELL THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO EVEN LOCATE EVEN IF YOU WANT TO
YEAH SO OF COURSE FOR EXAMPLE UH I WANTED TO KNOW LIKE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A A FO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY OVER THERE
OKAY SO IN THAT CASE YOU CAN EVEN LOOK AT THE TECHNOLOGY WHAT THE MOBILE PHONE IS TRYING TO USE WITH THE CARD
YEAH WHERE THEY DO ALL THE WI WITH WITH THEM ACTUALLY
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL FIT INTO OUR COST OF TWELVE POINT FIVE EURO YOU KNOW
IS IT POSSIBLE TO FIT IN TO THAT
FOR EXAMPLE IF F IF YOU WANT TO PUT WOOD I WOULDN'T SUGGEST FOR WOOD UH 'CAUSE IT'S I THINK IT'S M
BUT IT IS BUT WITH PLASTIC OR THE RUBBER OR WHATEVER IT IS IT'S MUCH BETTER WITH THAT RATHER THAN GOING FOR
YEA
UH
AND EVERY TIME WE HAVE TO BE VERY BUT IF I THE IF WE IF WE GO TO A DIFFERENT WAYS OF DESIGNING THOSE KEYS
THEN YOU CAN MERGE THEM TOGETHER TO
OH YOU CAN ACTUALLY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SEE THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE QUITE SMALL OVER HERE AND UH NOW YOU CAN
FOR EXAMPLE AS I WAS IF YOU MAKE THEM BIG IT MAY CHANGE THE LOOK OF THE THING ALSO TO THE PEOPLE
AT THE SAME TIME IT IS M MORE UH LIKE IT WOULD BE MORE INTERESTING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING THIS R. S. I. AND ALL PROBLEM
YEAH SO IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE MODEL HERE S YOU CAN PUT THE KEYS
YEAH THAT WOULD DEPEND UPON US ACTUALLY
MAYBE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING IF YOU COULD LOOK UM
ONE FOR LIKE COST AND THE ONE WITH LIKE HIGHER END SO THAT THEN WE CAN BE EASILY COMPARING THEM OR YOU KNOW FIND A COMPROMISE BETWEEN BOTH OF THEM
YEAH THAT'S HOW IT IS
UH
UM WE WILL HAVE THE PRESENTATIONS OF Y OF YOU DIFFERENT TEAM MEMBERS AND THEN TRY TO COME TO DECISIONS UH ABOUT THE CONCEPTS UH YOU HAVE PRESENTED
SO AND THAT UH WILL UH WE HAVE SOME UH FORTY MINUTES UH TO COMPLETE THIS UH
AH THERE IS MATTHEW
OKAY MM YES I HAVE IT
UH
MAYBE WE YES WELL WE MAYBE CAN DECIDE LATER ON UM THE L THE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF UH I'VE IT WAS A GOOD IDEA MAYBE TO TO
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MY SUPERIORS WOULD BE SO GLAD WITH IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO INTRODUCE A COMPLETE UH UH NEW L LINE OF UH OF SUPPLIES UH IT WOULD BE UH VERY COMPLICATED UH ORGANISATIONAL
YES AND OF COURSE IT WILL BE A WE WE GET A IF IT WORKS WE CAN GET UH AFTER SALES I MEAN THAT WOULD WOULD BE VERY GOOD I MEAN THOSE COVERS COULD GO FOR FOR THREE
TOGETHER INDEED UH BECAUSE YOU MA MIGHT HAVE SOME SOME INFORMATION ON THE THE EASY TO USE WHAT YOU WERE ALREADY MENTIONING
UM YES BUT BUT I DO MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE A HAND TO US BECAUSE I I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THAT THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THAT FOR TWELVE EURO AND FIFTY CENTS
EVERY TIME I HAVE TO COME DOWN ON THIS PRICE AGAIN TO SO THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE LIMITING FOR YOUR CREATIVITY BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S THE REAL
S SO DO WE THINK THESE IDEAS AN AND MY UH SP SPEECH RECOGNITION
I MEAN MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE FOR FOR TWELVE EURO BUT THEN THEN IT WILL BE AT COST OF OTHER FUNCTIONALITY WE MIGHT IMPLEMENT LIKE THE UH UH THE THE THE FURRY UH UH CASE OF THE
WITH THE CHANGEABLE COVERS TO FANCY IT UP
SO LIKE A NORMAL CHEAP PLASTIC CASE WHICH CAN BE COVERED UP IN FOR INSTANCE A WOODEN CASE
NO OF COURSE
SO I F I THINK WE WE SHOULD COME TO SOME DECISIONS NOW UH A ABOUT THIS
BUT WHEN WE WANT A SCROLLING WHEEL W WE ALSO NEED THE EXPENSIVE CHIP SO CAN WE USE SAME CHIP SO WITH ONE EXPENSIVE CHIP
SO WHEN THE MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP YOU MENTIONED THERE IS IS POSSIBLE IN THE IN THE GIVEN BUDGET UH MAYBE WE SHOULD GO FOR FOR THE MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP
UH
YOU TH YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT W THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA
AND THEN PEOPLE CAN FANCY IT UP WITH WITH MORE EXPENSIVE MATERIALS WHICH WHICH COME WITH A WITH ANOTHER PRICE
MA I I THINK UH FOR NEXT MEETING WE C YOU TWO CAN PRESENT A REAL DESIGN
UH SO DRAWING IT ON THE BOARD
AND THEN WE NOW SH ONLY HAVE TO T TO DECIDE THE GENERAL FUNCTION UH
LET LET'S SAY NEXT MEETING W YOU PRODUCE TWO DESIGNS ONE ONE
ONE LESS ADVANCED AND ONE MORE ADVANCED AND WITH THE COST PRICE
WITH ADDIT UH ADDITIONAL UH HOW DO YOU CALL THEM THESE LIKE LIKE MOBILE TELEPHONES YOU CAN PUT A COVER OVER IT
MM W BUT THEN YOU HAVE STILL HAVE UH WHEN YOU DON'T USE IT YOU HAVE SUCH A A AN EXTENT OF YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WHICH YOU DON'T USE
THAT YOU CAN ELSEWHERE OPEN YOUR REMOTE CONTROL AND ON THE INSIDE ARE UH BUTTONS YOU DON'T USE THAT MUCH
AND THE WE WE CAN DECIDE DECIDE BETWEEN TH THOSE DESIGNS
UM YES I COME TO THAT UH UH
SO UH YOU TWO WILL BE TOGETHER W WORKING ON A O ON TWO PROTOTYPES
OKAY LET'S CALL THIS TO AN END
DID YOU GET MY EMAIL WITH THE SLIDES
AH
MAYBE THEY'RE SUPPOSED THE PEN'S SUPPOSED TO GO OVER THE SEATS
JO'S MAKING FACES AT ME
WELL WE CAN'T NO WE CAN'T DO EVALUATION 'TIL WE HAVE A DESIGN
OKAY SO IT'S IT'S T A VERY BASIC REMOTE THEN IT'S ONLY
AH OKAY
UM WE JUST GO THROUGH THESE AND RATE THEM AS A GROUP AND THEN AT THE END WE'LL MAKE AN EVALUATION BASED ON THAT
UM THE THREE THINGS WERE LOOK AND FEEL INNOVATION AND EASE OF USE
WERE THE THREE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS UM APPEALING TO THE CORRECT DEMOGRAPHIC SO USING THOSE THINGS IN THE RIGHT WAY TO APPEAL TO OUR DEMOGRAPHIC
SO WELL DO YOU WANNA GO THROUGH AND PUT THROUGH THOSE ON THE THE TWO PRODUCTS NOW OR DO WE WANNA DISCUSS THEM FURTHER AND THEN EVALUATE THEM
SO F JUST GO THROUGH ONTO THE WHITEBOARD I GUESS
WOULD YOU WANT TO TAKE THE PRICE DOWN OF THE END PRODUCT ACCORDING TO THAT OR JUST HAVE THE HIGH PROFIT ON IT
OH YOU FOLLOWING THE IDEA OF USING THE UM REMOVABLE COVERS ON THESE
IS THAT PART OF BOTH OF THEM OR
WHERE UM ONE IS I'VE BROKEN THE PEN AGAIN
S YEAH
SO ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN
ON THE SCALE U IT'S BETWEEN FUNCTIONAL AND FANCY BASICALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT SO
IS THAT WORKING
DID IT COME OUT
BECAUSE WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IT STILL EVEN IF IT WASN'T WORKING
'CAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE LEFT HANDED THEY WANT TO USE THE OTHER HAND MAYBE IT WON'T WORK SO WELL
PROBABLY MORE TOWARDS THREE THAN TWO
ARE WE INCLUDING LIKE A LOCATION KIND OF THING LIKE TRYING TO FIND IT
BUT TH IS THERE ANY THERE'S NO ACTUAL INNOVATION IN THAT AT ALL IT'S JUST A STRAIGHT OUT REMOTE CONTROL
GOT THE L. C. D. SCREEN
IS THAT IN THIS ONE THOUGH
IS THIS 'CAUSE THIS IS THE
TH TH THERE WERE DIFFERENT OPTIONS WE DISCUSSED THEN WE DISCUSSED THE ONE THAT WAS IN BUDGET AND THE ONE THAT WAS OUT OF BUDGET
ONE
WELL THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS A VERY GOOD INNOVATION I BELIEVE IT SO
EASE OF USE
SO THAT'S MAYBE A A TWO FOR EASE OF USE
THREE OR FOUR
THREE
SO THREE'S UH HOW WELL IT GOES TO THE TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC
THAT'S IT'S STILL YE
IT'S GOT THE GOT THE THE TOYS IN IT IT'S GOT THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND
I'D PROBABLY GO WITH THREE AGAIN FOR THAT ONE
SO AS IT IS NOT REALLY DOING EITHER OF THEM
I KNOW SOME HAVE YOU TRIED THE MOBILE PHONES THAT HAVE GOT THE KINDA SPONGY BUTTONS AND NOT NOT EXACTLY SPONGY BUT I'M THINKING ONE OF THE NOKIAS THAT'S GOT LIKE YOU CA IT HASN'T GOT INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS IT'S GOT JUST A ONE BIT ON IT AND SO YOU CAN THAT FEELS KINDA SPONGY
SO YOU GOT THE OPTION OF HAVING DIFFERENT COLOURS OR DIFFERENT TEXTURES
IT LETS PEOPLE HAVE THE LATEST FASHION EVEN NEXT YEAR WHEN FRUIT AND VEGETABLES MIGHT BE OUT
THERE'S N YEAH
'CAUSE THAT'S THE THAT'S THE FEATURE THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN EITHER OF THEM
ON THE OTHER ONE
TWO AND THREE OR ONE AND TWO
THREE SIX NINE DIVIDED BY FIVE SO FIVE
NINE BY FIVE ONE POINT S EIGHT
BUT WE STILL GOT A VERY DIFFERENT PRICE FOR THOSE TWO SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY COMPARABLE YET ANYWAY
WELL IT'S EASIER TO JUST MAKE THAT ONE CHEAPER BY JUST TAKING THE SPEECH RECOGNITION OUT
EITHER OF THEM
SO NOW WE'RE EITHER GOING BUTTON OR L. C. D. S L. C. D. DISPLAY
IS THAT PRICE PER UNIT OR FOR THE WHOLE
SO WE'D HAVE A SPECIAL COLOUR SPECIAL FORM AND SPECIAL MATERIAL ON ALL OF THEM
BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE CURVED ON TWO IT'S LIKE IT'S CURVED ON THE SIDES AND CURVED ON THE TOP AND BOTTOM AS WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
WE HAVE MORE WE'VE GOT THOSE THE SCROLL WHEEL ON THE SIDE AND YEAH
THE SC
WE'VE GOT A SCROLL WHEEL FOR THE VOLUME DON'T WE OR IS IT SOME OTHER THING THAT'S NOT ON THERE
THAN THE COST YOU GAVE THE SIXTEEN EUROS
BUT THAT'S SEVEN BASIC BUTTONS RIGHT SEVEN BUTTONS WITHOUT ANY ADDS ON WITHOUT SPECIAL COLOURS OR FORM OR MATERIAL
I TH I'D LIKE T IT TO BE IN BUT I CAN'T SEE IT HAPPENING
I CAN'T SEE IT FITTING IN
BU Y YOU'RE A POWER VOTER UH VETO ANYWAY AS PROJECT MANAGER
I THINK THEN WE WE'RE REALLY LOSING EASE OF USE
SO L. C. D. 'S OUT IS SPEECH REC OUT NOW
WITH THESE NEW COSTINGS
SO JUST LOOK AT FORGET THAT ONE AND LOOK AT THAT ONE NOW
SO W WE CAN GO BACK AND L TALK TO THE SUPPLIERS MAYBE AND SEE IF WE CAN DRIVE THE PRICES DOWN TO ADD A FEW MORE THINGS IN BUT THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO WITH THE RESTRICTIONS WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT
YEAH WE WILL YEAH SO I WILL BE ABLE TO TO SUMMARIZE UH OUR MEETING
BUT STILL I THINK UH IT WOULD BE IN VERY IMPORTANT IF THE UH AS UM MAIN DESIGNER
I THINK WE CAN PUT ON THE HERE
AND UH WELL FIRST FOR BOTH THEY HAVE UM A SPECIAL SHAPE MAYBE THE DESIGNER CAN UH EXPLAIN BETTER THAN ME BUT UH IT'S LIKE A SURF BOARD
AND UH IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING SHAPE BECAUSE UM UNCONSCIOUSLY PEOPLE WANT TO S TO SURF WHEN THEY SEE THIS STUFF
DON'T TAKE CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE COLOUR BECAUSE W YEAH WE DON'T TAKE YEAH
SO HERE WOULD BE BASICALLY THE THE THE INFRARED UH UH LED YEAH L. A. L. A. L. E. D.
ON THE ON THE LEFT OKAY SO EASY TO TURN ON T AND OFF
AND UM SO THIS IS A VERY CHEAP VERSION SO THERE ARE MAYBE YOU CAN CARRY ON UH MATTHEW
TO AUDIO AND TO VIDEO ON DEMAND
AN YEAH
YOU HAVE TO SEE YEAH YEAH THE THE COMPONENTS WE PUT INSIDE IS VERY LOW WEIGHT
AND THEY SAY BASICALLY THAT THE S. R. SYSTEM WOULD BE UH SOMETHING LIKE THREE FRANCS PER ITEM SO THREE EUROS SORRY
WELL I THINK TH TH YEAH WE SHOULD STICK WITH UH A NUMBER OF KEYS BECAUSE IF WE ADD TOO MUCH THEN
FOUR MAYBE
UH
OH YOU CAN PUSH PUSH IT AGAIN YOU CAN PUSH IT
BASICALLY THERE IS NO INNOVATION IN THE FIRST ONE COMPARED TO WHAT EXISTS IN THE MARKET RIGHT
UH COULD PUT IT AT ONE OR TWO I WOULD SAY
UH
W W UN TO BE ONE WHAT WOULD DO WE NEE ACTUALLY YEAH I DON'T SEE OKAY ONE WOULD WOULD BE WITHOUT BUTTONS
SO MAYBE WE CAN PUT ONE
YEAH ONE YEAH
SO THE FIRST ONE IS REALLY STANDARD SO EVERYBODY I INCLUDING OUR GRANDMOTHERS CAN USE IT RIGHT
ONE ME UM WE HOPE MAYBE SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET UH SCARED WITH THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE IT'S N UH IT'S NOT LIKE A BIG ONE WITH UH ONE HUNDRED BUTTONS OR SO
YEAH BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT IT'S I IT WAS WRITTEN THAT IT REALLY SO IMPORTANT
BUT W
EVEN ONE AND TWO
UH THAT MEANS THAT IT GOES IN IN THE WATER
UH OKAY
VERY STANDARD ONE THAT MEETS THE THE REQUIREMENTS OF TH SUCH PEOPLE THAT WANT REALLY STANDARD UH THINGS
YEAH SO A A POINT BETTER FOR THE FOR THE NUMBER TWO
SO I I GIVE YEAH I JUST GIVE A CALL WITH THE MANUFACTURER UH AND UH I EXPLAINED THEM AND THEY TOLD ME THIS COULD BE POSSIBLE FOR SIXTEEN FR EUROS
UH UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T SEE THIS CHIP UH MATTHEW SO MAYBE WE HAVE TO RECAP WITH THIS ONE
SAMPLE YEAH THIS ONE
SO WHICH ONE ARE WE TALKING TO
IS IT ZERO FRANC
L. C. D. IS
BECAUSE IT'S THERE IS NO LIKE
WELL IT'S YOU KNOW THIS CURVE LIKE THIS SO IT'S W THERE IS ONLY
IS IS IS THERE IS NOTHING LIKE Y YOU KNOW IN THE OTHER STUFF THERE ARE YEAH CONCAVE
THE SINGLE CURVED IN THE SIXTEEN
OKAY SO BASED ON THAT YEAH UM WHERE IS THE ES OKAY SAMPLE SPEAKER
YEAH BUT IF YOU HAVE THE NEAR THE L. C. D. YOU CAN UM CHOOSE SELECT BETWEEN UM YOU KNOW LIKE UNI UNIVERSAL BETWEEN AUDIO
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS W THIS U UH ITEM
ON THE MARKET POINT OF VIEW YEAH
BECAUSE ONE YEAH TH SHOW ME THAT UH ACTUALLY WE COULD IN FACT WE MOVE THESE THREE BUTTONS AND HAVE THREE UH POSSIBILITIES FOR EACH OF THE THREE HERE
HERE ONE AT THE MIDDLE AND AT THE
THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS OUT
ACTUALLY YEAH WE WE WE WILL NOT NEED THE REALLY UH EXPERT DESIGNERS UM BECAUSE THE AMOUNT YEAH
THE EXTRA TWO ARE FOR UH HAVING OR GIVING AN OPTION FOR UH HAVING MORE THAN ONE CHANNEL
ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT IT THAT IT I AND WOULD COST US TO BUILD IT ABOUT EIGHT EUROS
SO THAT UH THEN WHAT WE LOOK T YEAH
UH SO WELL THEN THE THIS IS THE A MORE A LITTLE UH SMOOTH AND IT GIVES A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY
UH IN THIS WAY SO ALL WE HAVE UH TH YOU SEE THERE ARE ONLY SIX KEYS
BUT DON'T WORRY THEY ARE MA THEY ARE DOING THE JOB OF TWELVE KEYS ACTUALLY HERE
AND SO THEY HAVE MORE SPACE ACTUALLY AND UH IT'S EASY TO UH USE THIS AND UH YOU HAVE UM SO THIS IS A STANDARD UH UH INFRARED EYE
HERE AND UH Y THIS IS A FUNCTIONAL THING WHICH CAN CHANGE LIKE IT'S A TOGGLE SWITCH WHICH COULD CHANGE THE FUNCTION SAY Y YOU PRESS IT
I REALLY CAN CHANGE IT SO
THE L. C. D. CAN DISPLAY WHAT IS THAT ON THAT AND UH WELL YOU CAN HAVE A INTEGRATED MICROPHONE OVER HERE OR IN THE BUTTON TH HERE
SO WHICH CAN UH BASICALLY YOU WANT TO DO A SPEECH RECOGNITION AND UH THAT CHANNEL A LOT OF INFORMATION CAN BE DI DISPLAYED HERE DIRECTLY ON THE UM ON YOUR ON YOUR DISPLAY
WHEN YOU NEED YOU CAN USE IT AND THIS GIVES ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY THAT TOMORROW YOU WANT YOU CAN ADD A TACTILE THING
TO THIS COVER YOU KNOW
UH YOU WANT TO UH AND THIS GIVES A PROTECTION TO THE L. C. D. ACTUALLY GIVING A COVER TO THAT ACTUALLY
IT IT IS IT IS IS IS IT GIVES A PROTEC IT'S MORE ROBUST THAT WAY
UH YEAH
WELL UH IF YOU WE CAN HAVE IF YOU HAVE NEW MORE IDEAS WE CAN ADD NEW MORE UH SOME MORE KEYS IF YOU WANT TO YOU KNOW
AH THAT'S FOR THE IT'S KIND OF A L. E. D. FOR INDICATING YOUR BATTERY AND AS WELL AS IT'S LIKE A BLINKING ONE YOU KNOW YOU CAN KEEP IT ASIDE
IT THOUGH THE LOOK IS FINE BUT UH STILL I WILL GIVE FOUR IN THAT CASE YOU KNOW
I WILL GI YEAH
C CAN YOU GET THE BATTERIES
IS THERE ANOTHER BATTERY THERE
NO ACTUALLY THIS IS THIS IS NOT GOING TO PROTRUDE ACTUALLY IT IT'S N I IT IS JUS
IT'S A LED ACTUALLY WHICH WHICH 'LL BE COVERING IN A CURVE
IT'S WILL BE EMBEDDED THERE SO IT WON'T BE REALLY YOU KNOW PROTRUDING OR SOMETHING
NO YOU IT IT NOT PROTRUDING ACTUALLY IT WILL GO IN BETTER INTO THAT
MY JUST THAT UM THE FEEL IS THAT UM
YOU RIGHT NOW YOU YOU DON'T SEE THE FEEL BECAUSE RIGHT UH FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PRESS IT QUITE INSIDE NOW LIKE THIS NOW IT'S EMBEDDED ONE
THIS IS HOW EMBEDDED ONE WILL
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A SLIGHT THING FOR TO FORWARD AND
YOU SHOULD BE REA
UH NO I THINK IT'S MORE OF THE FEEL
NO WE HA
UH
HE IS USED TO IT ACT
THEY ARE USED TO IT ACTUALLY
UH THOUGH IT HAS MORE FUNCTIONALITY I THINK IT SHOULDN'T BE FOR THE USER TO LEARN IT ACTUALLY
UH YEAH ACTUALLY IN FACT I THINK IT WILL BE YEAH
YEAH BUT Y
THREE IS FINE WITH ME
YEAH IT'S A ACTUALLY THE USER HAS TO PUT SOME EFFORT TO DO USE THAT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT SO EASY LIKE THIS ONE THE NORMAL
OH NO THIS WOULD I I WOULD I WOULD GIVE THIS MODEL TO THE OLD PEOPLE ACTUALLY
I WELL I THINK
UH YEAH BUT BUT IF YOU SELL IT IN THE MARKET IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAP ACTUALLY
SO IN THAT CASE WELL IT'S FINE THEN
BECAUSE THEN YOU YOU HAVE IT UH D YOU HAVE LOT OF THINGS WHICH YOU CAN INCLUDE FOR THE PEOPLE TO
WE WE WE WE WE YEAH IT'S THE WAY THEY ARE GOING TO BE ACTUALLY
IN THAT UH W IN THE MOD
UH UH Y ARE YOU SURE
ONE POINT SIX ONE POINT
ONE POINT EIGHT YEAH
YEAH IT MIGH IT IT'LL NEED UH MORE THAN A CONVENTIONAL ONE IT WON'T BE UH JUST MAYBE YOU MIGHT USE A A. A. BATTERY ACTUALLY
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS OR THAT
UH
AH GOOD
NO FOR THAT ONE ALSO
UH
S
OH I I IT
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE Y Y YEAH IT'S TH WITH THE REGULAR CHIP YEAH
UH
UH
OR WE COULD EVEN REPLACE THEM BY BUTTONS ACTUALLY
I THINK BUT
SO WELL IT IS IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO BE HERE UH
HE HE HE
UM YES BUT W WE
IT'S UH WELL HE SAID TO ME WELL UH
WHEN YOU STAY IN IT'S GOOD WHEN YOU DON'T STAY IN YOU HAVE TO REDESIGN
THERE IS NO UH NO NEGOTIATION UH POSSIBLE IN THIS MATTER
OH MA MAYBE THEN YOU CAN START NOW WITH MM PRESENTING YOUR UH YOUR DESIGNS
EYE
AH OKAY
LOOK HOW IT FEELS ALL
YEAH BUT BUT BUT BUT UH I IN THERE UH WHEN THIS IS CLOSED WILL IT ALSO UH COVER UP THE L. C. D. SCREEN
BUT W
EVALUA EVALUATION AND ALSO THE EVALUATION CRITERIA SO WHAT WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT
UM N NO WHY NOT WHY NOT DISCUSS UH DISCUSS IT NOW
AND THEN I MEAN W W W YOU MUST JUST SEE IT WE CAN STILL SPEND THIS FOUR AND A HALF EURO AND
TO R BECAUSE TH TH TH THE THE SELLING PRICE IS ALREADY PRITE FIK UH UH QUITE FIXED ON TWENTY FIVE EUROS
SO WE JUST HAVE TO OFFER AS MUCH AS AS WELL VALUE FOR THE FOR THE CUSTOMER UH HE CAN HAVE FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO
UM WELL W W WE CAN STILL DISCUSS THAT
AND TOGETHER WITH EVALUATING THIS UH WE WE MIGHT COME WITH NEW IDEAS I MEAN ADDING THINGS OR UH REMOVING UH OF OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO EXPENSIVE BUT
SO WE CAN UH SEE WHETHER THE THE PRICE IS IS WITHIN THE TWELVE EURO UH FIFTY CENTS UH
UH THERE IS ANOTHER PEN
LOOK AND FEEL
IN I IN MY OPINION
PURELY FEEL IS IS IS VERY GOOD IS VERY GOOD IN YOUR HAND SO I I I WOULD CONSIDER TWO OR OR MAY MAYBE EVEN ONE FOR FEEL
MA MA MA MA MAYBE SAY SAY FIVE
FOUR FOUR
NOW WE TH TH THEN WE SETTLE ON FOUR
MM TRY IT JUST TRY IT
OH IT WILL NOT RI MM MM
AH
WELL R R
I THINK THE LOOK IS BETTER BUT THE FEEL IS IS IS WORSE
SO SO I WOULD ALSO SAY THIS IS FOUR
BUT W W DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK
S SO THAT
WHY IT IS ONE
A MAN W W
THREE I WOULD
THREE
SO SO I THINK TH THREE IS GOOD
TWE TWENTY TO FORTY YES THAT'S
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH WHICH HAS AN APPEAL ON THIS GROUP I THINK BUT
MM W W W WE AFTER THIS WE CAN CAN CONSIDER UH FOR INSTANCE MAKING THIS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO TO THE DEMOGRAPHIC
BUT AS IT IS NOW I W WOULD SAY
TH T T
YEAH THA THA THA THA THA THAT'S I THINK IT'S BETTER BECAUSE OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN WHICH IS REALLY AN APPEAL ON THE ON THE ON THE
ON THE AND ON THE
MM MA MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER YES SO
WH WHAT WHAT
NO S SAY T TWO
WE CAN WE CAN CONSIDER UH UH IS IT POSSIBLE DO YOU THINK TO TO MAKE A COVER
FOR S SUCH A PHONE
O O OR JUST TWO THINGS WHICH CAN BE PUT ON EACH OTHER
MAYBE WE CAN BUT WE HAVE TO DECIDE IT WE CAN PUT THE THE THE FANCY F LOOK OF VEGETABLES FOR INSTANCE
TO TO THESE COVERS AND S NOW TRY TO INVEST IN THE IN IN THE FEATURES
ONE AND TWO
SO D THIS ONE HAS SPONGY BUT BUTTONS
BOTH IN I I OR WE JUST HAVE TO CHOOSE
WHEN WE CHOOSE FOR THIS ONE WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE AND W WHEN WE TO D FOR THIS ONE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT MORE CHEAP
BUT I'M NOW DID Y DID YOU WORK WITH THE SAME PRICES THAT I HAVE HERE
MM THA
SO LET'S LET'S TRY TO TO MODEL THIS THIS PHONE IN THIS SHEET UH WHAT KIND OF ENERGY SOURCE UH I I WE DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT THAT
JUST SO ONE BATTERY
GIVEN SPEECH RECOGNITION I THINK W YOU SHOULD GO FOR THE LESS FANCY CHIP
OH YES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME SHAPE BUT ACTUALLY BU
UH SPECIAL COLOUR NOW WE LEAVE IT TO THE COVERS
YEAH TH NOW THIS IS PER PER UNIT THIS NUMBER OF COMPONENTS
SO ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE T
SO I THINK BUT TH DO YOU AGREE TH THAT THI
UH
W D WE HAVE WE HAVEN'T TALK ABOUT A BUT THAT'S NO A IS VERY EXP INEXPENSIVE I BELIEVE BUT IT IS NOT IN THE LIST
W HO H IS THIS A SCROLL WHEEL OR IS THIS A A A SORT OF BUTTON WHICH CAN BE PRESSED ON TWO SIDES UH SO FOR HIGHER AND LOWER
ONE
SO IS IT POSSIBLE
NO NO HE HE HE I I
OTHERWISE Y YOU HA YOU HAVE A S VE VERY NORMAL UH THING LIKE THIS
I THINK WE HAVE TO COME TO A DECISION NOW JUST I I THINK WE WE WHAT WE JUST DO I IS VOTE
ABOUT THE UH THE L. C. D. UH DISPLAY SO
ONE MAN ONE VOTE
S SO WHO THINKS THE THE L. C. D. DISPLY DISPLAY SHOULD BE I SHOULD BE IN IT
IS THAT ACCEPTABLE
CA CAN I HAVE CAN THE FUNCTIONS BE IMPLEMENT IN AN
SO THAT WOU WOULD BE CUTTING CUTTING SUH SAY ABOUT THESE BUTTONS
OKAY W WE NOW WE CAN JUST UH
I TH I TH I THINK W WE JUST GO FOR THIS ONE AND THAT THAT NOW TWELVE EUROS IS THE
IS IS THE PRICE OKAY
OKAY UH SORRY
SORRY TOO UH
IS IT BEAUTIFUL
YES YES IS IT LIKE THAT
IS IT BETTER
HOW DO YOU WEAR THIS THING
UH
SO GOTTA HAVE ANOTHER MEETING UH SOON SO MAYBE YOU COULD HURRY UP A BIT
CAN I GIVE YOU THE NO
USUALLY ORANGUTANS HAVE RED HAIR SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BUT I DON'T HAVE RED PEN SO
IS IT A MONSTER
AH YEAH
AH HA
HE LOOKS LIKE A BONG
IS IT FOR UH FOR PUTTING A FOR LOGOS NO
I IS THERE A MATTER FOR A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
IS IT UH A SINGLE DEVICE REMOTE CONTROL OR IS IT A MULTI DEVICE REMOTE CONTROL
AH THIS IS NOT DEFINED AT ALL
AH OKAY
WELL UH DO WE SELL OTHER STUFF
ONLY A BUCK
BUT UH IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN WATERPROOF REMOTE CONTROL IT MEANS YOU CAN JUST COVER IT WITH SOME PLASTIC AND YOU CAN SORT OF F
I IT WILL LOOK A BULKY IN THAT CASE
THAT'S THAT'S QUITE COOL BUT UH OF COURSE WE YOU DON'T NORMALLY NEED UH ANY AUDIO UH RECORDING STUFF ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT
SO I IT'S JUST GOING TO ADD T TO THE COST
NO NO N
YOU SHOULD WRITE Y THE NAME I THINK
ME AH YEAH
HE ALSO
AND I I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING MOST OF THE TIME I I LOSE MY REMOTE CONTROL
WE SHOULD HAVE S UH SPECIAL BU BUTTON ON THE T. V. TO MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL BEEPING
AH YEAH
AH
THEN UH WE WILL UH SEE WHAT WILL BE UH OUR PRODUCT AND WHAT WILL BE THE DIFFERENT STEP WE WILL HAVE TO DESIGN IT
AND UH THEN WE WILL UH DISCUSS IF WE HAVE FEW IDEAS AND WE WILL UH END UH BY UH DISPATCHING THE DIFFERENT TASK YOU WILL BE YOU WILL HAVE TO FULFIL TO COMPLETE THIS PROCESS
SO THE THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL SO TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER OUR COMPETITORS WE HAVE TO BE ORIGINAL
SO UH THE DESIGN STEP WILL BE DIVIDED IN THREE UH MAIN POINTS
THIRD IS THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THEN IS THE DESIRED DESIGN
WHAT KIND OF USER INTERF INTERFACE WE WANT AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT UH TREND IN USER INTERFACE AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO I WILL NOW ASK YOU WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE DESIGN OF A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR TO UH EACH OF US TO TO DRAW UH YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL ON THE WHITE BOARD
N N
IS THIS UH
AH OKAY IT'S PRETTY
OLIVIER DO YOU WANT TO
OKAY I GO BUT NEXT TIME YOU'LL DO SOMETHING I'M SURE
I'M A BIT SHORT ON CABLE
LIKE A WHAT
THAT IS TO SAY TO TO HAVE A PRODUCTION COST LOWER THAN TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS AND HAVE A SELLING PRICE OF TWICE THAT PRICE T IN ORDER TO TARGET A PROFE PROFIT OF UH FIFTY UH MILLION EUROS
ON YEAH YOU YOU CAN SUGGEST POINTS LIKE THIS
SO WHAT WHAT SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT CAN CONTROL ONE DEVICE OR MULTIPLE
AND UH DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS UM OF UH DESIGN IDEAS OR ANY UH UH TECHNICAL REQUIREMENT WE WE SHOULD UH FULFIL
AND DO YOU HAVE IT ALSO TO BE TO BE LIGHTED IN ORDER TO BE USED IN THE DARK
AND ALSO IT HAVE I IT MAY BE IT MAY BE IMPORTANT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO BE UH
TO TO RESIST TO VARIOUS SHOCKS THAT CAN HAPPEN IF IT FALL
MAYBE IT IS ORIGINAL BECAUSE YOU CAN UH USE IT IN YOUR UH IN YOUR BATH WHEREAS THE OTHERS CAN'T
HAVIN HAVING A WATER PROOF REMOTE CONTROL SO THAT THE PEOPLE CAN UH USE IT IN THEIR BATH
YEAH MAYB
B
MAYBE WE CAN SELL UH ALL THAT TOGETHER SO SO PLASTIC PROTECTION
I DON'T KNOW WHISTLE ABLE
YEAH BUT S STILL WE HAVE TO MM WE HAVE TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER OUR COMPETITORS
WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUEST OF THAT'S UH DESIGN TO THE UH INDUSTRIAL UM DESIGNER
SO NEXT MEETING IS IN THIRTY MINUTES OR SO UH
SO SO I WILL ASK THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS INDUSTRIAL DESIGN SO ANY WORKING ANY WORKING FUNCTION WE HAVE DISCUSSED
AND THEN UH I WILL UH JUST ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND UH LOOK AT YOUR MAIL BECAUSE YOU WILL RECEIVE UH SOME GOOD ADVICE SOON
YOU EAT IT
UM I DUNNO IF YOU CAN OPEN THE UH M IS NOT HERE
UH IN
IN DOCUMENT
OKAY SO IN OUR USABILITY LAB WE OBSERVED THE REMOTE CONTROL USE AMONG ONE HUNDRED SUBJECTS AND THE SUBJECTS ALSO FILLED A QUESTIONNAIRE OKAY
MORE NICE MORE KIND
EIGHTY HUNDRED PER CENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK OH TO IT'S NOT GOOD
FIFTY F UH SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF USERS SAY THEY S ZAP A LOT
SO MM WE HAVE TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL UH VERY UM OUT FOR THAT
UH THE BUTTONS HAVE ARE TO BE UM UH UH LIKE YOU SAY RESIST RESISTING TO TO SHOCKS
UM AND FIFTY PER CENTS OF USERS SAY THEY ONLY USE UH TEN PER CENTS OF BUT OF THE BUTTONS IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO ALL THE BUTTONS WE WE HAVE TO PUT ARE HAVE TO TO HAVE UM A USE A REAL USE AND NOT ONLY OR
F NOT MANY BUTTONS AND UH AND UH UH U USEABLE BUTTONS
SO THEY SAID UH THEY LOST UH OFTEN THE REMOTE CONTROL IN IN THE ROOM SO THEY WANT TO HAVE A WAY TO TO
TO FIND IT
SO THEY WANT SOMETHING S REALLY VERY SIMPLE AND UH EASY TO USE
UH
WE KNOW THAT UH THE USER USE UH A LOT THEIR UM REMOTE CONTROL UM TO TO CHANGE CHANNEL
SO THEN WE ASKED SOME QUESTIONS TO THEM AND UM WE ASKED THIS QUESTION IF THEY PREFER AN L. C. D. SCREEN OR ON THEIR REMULTIFIC FUNCTION REMOTES CONTROL AND IF THEY MM PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN REMOTE CONTROL AND YOU CAN GO WE HAVE HERE THE RESULTS OF
TO HAVE THE S YES AND SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND UH AND THE OTHERS IS NOT SO IMPORTANT BUT UH WE KNOW THAT UH UH PEOPLE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE ARE PEOPLE WHO WATCH A LOT T. V. AND UH WHO WHO WH CAN USE A LOT THIS UH
SO MAYBE WE WE CAN HAVE A SPEECH RECOGNITION IN
OKAY AND IF THERE IS TH THE CONCLUSION NOW
SO AS WE SAY BEFORE I THINK UH UM A REMOTE CONTROL LIGHTENING IN THE DARK IT'S IT'S A GOOD THING
UH NOT TO MANY MUD BUTTONS LIKE WE WE SAID BEFORE
E EASY TO USE UH A WAY TO FIND IT EASILY IN THE ROOM AND UH UH RESISTANT TO TO SHOCK AND TO TO
AN I S NO YEAH
UH YEAH W I I THINK THEY THEY SAY THAT IT'S UH DIFFICULT TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT BUT I WHEN YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT
UM AT THREE I THINK
DO WE THINK W S IN THE IN THE WRONG FOLDER MAYBE
AND BUT OTHER PEOPLE WANT TH ALSO REMOTES FOR CONTROLLING UH AND TOYS LIKE ROBOTIC PETS AND LITTLE ROBOTS AND STUFF AND OTHER PEOPLE ALSO WANT TO HAVE REMOTES FOR CONTROLLING UM WHOLE HOUSE
SO THERE IS ONE THAT IS ONE THING
THE OTHER IS THE
UH AT THE SAME TIME AS AND GENERAL VOICE COMMANDS IF YOU WANT YEAH
UH SO THE USER INTERFACE WILL CONSIST OF TWO PARTS
ONE IS THE VOICE COMMAND PART AND ON ONE IS THE ACTUAL BUTTONS PART
UH AND TH THE BUTTONS PART WOULD BE UH A SET OF BUTTONS FOR CHOOSING DEVICES A SET OF BUTTONS FOR SPECIAL NAVIGATION IN SPACE
FOR SPECIAL NAVIGATION FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT HAVE A T. V. IN THE MENU AND YOU GOING TO CHANGE YEAH
UH
UH YEAH I THINK SO
NOT SO FAR
AH GOOD
OTHER SIDE YEAH YO WA YOUR WRIST
IF YOU ALSO UP ON A COMPUTER IN A STRANGE POSITION
HAVE TO SAY HA HA
UH YEAH
UH
HOW MUC HOW MUCH DO YOU GET HOW MUCH DO YOU IF YOU BUY ONE MILLION UNITS H NO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS
EH CHIPS
A A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UH IF YOU HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN IF YOU CAN DO IT COMPLETELY THE WAY YOU WANT BECAUSE THE BUTTONS ALSO LOOK THE WAY YOU WANT THEM BUT IT WILL BE HARD TO CONFIGURE I MEAN IMAGINE I UH SO IT'S REALLY SOMETHING FOR THE EXPERT USER
I THINK THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TH UH ARE UH CHRISTINE HERE SAID UH YOU HAVE A UH IT IS YEAH
TH MAYBE THEIR PARENTS WILL NOT BUT THEY WILL CONFIGURE IT
OTHERWISE IF IT'S DIFFERENT THEN OF COURSE EVERYBODY HAS SOMEBODY HAS TO LEARN TO USE IT FIRST
SO WILL YOU ADD WITH THE CHANNEL KEYS RIGHT
I AM
I'M SURE THAT UH IT DON'T LIKE BUT UH I DON'T SEE JUST ONE BUTTON
WELL IF IT'S GOING TO BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE THEN JUST HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL THERE IS NO OTHER FUNCTION THAT I CAN SEE
UH NO YOU WANT TO KEEP TELEVISION ON SO THAT THE ADVERTISING CAN REVENUE CAN COME BACK TO US
SO IF YOU YOU HAVE YOUR TEN BUTTONS FOR THE FOR THE NUMERIC THE NUMERICAL BUTTONS AND YOU HAVE INSTEAD OF HAVING JUST ONE MEMORY
WELL IF IT'S USEFUL LIKE IF IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE BETWEEN THREE CHANNELS FOR EXAMPLE THEN YOU H YOU CANNOT YOU CANNOT CANNOT WORK WITH JUST MEMORY BEING INCREMENTAL
HEY I JUST THOUGHT THIS THING THERE IS A I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE IS ARE SOME WITH A WHEEL LIKE THIS
INSTEAD OF HAVING THE UP DOWN BUTTONS FOR UH YOU CAN HAVE THE WHEEL
ON THE LOWER SIDE I THINK IT YOU HAVE TO TURN IT
SO YOU HAVE TO THE USER HAS TO LIKE TO SHOULD FEEL THE THE THE DISCRETE SENSE A BIT
I THINK IT'S ONLY PUT ON IF COU HAVE MULTI FUNCTION
IF YOU DO NOT MULTI FUNCTION THEN THERE IS NO P POINT IN HAVING L. C. D.
AH YEAH
F DO YOU WANT TO START
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN SHORT CUT
AH
WE WANT TO HAVE A NO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A GOOD IDEA
DO I HAVE OH YEAH
SO I SAY U. C. AND I FEED THAT TO UH L. E. D. WHICH IS UH INFRARED UM WHICH IS A AN INFRARED UM COMPONENT
AND SO FOR US UH THIS IS QUITE EASY
WE JUST NEED TO TAKE TO DEFINE WHAT WE WANT TO DO WHEN THE USER INTERFACE UM WANTS SOMETHING AND AFTER THAT WE JUST DO THE CODING TO S AND SEND THAT TO TO TO THE NOT THE TO THE TELEVISION
SO FOR US THIS IS QUITE EASY
IN THAT CASE THAT MEAN THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE MORE FOR SIMPLE
AND UM BUT FOR A STANDARD ONE THIS IS REALLY EASY
IT'S A QUESTION OF ONE MONTH AND SO ON S
DURING THE KICKOFF MEETING YOU SAY THAT WE WE SHOULDN'T WE SHOULDN'T GO UP TO TWELVE POINT FIVE EURO PER UNIT SO HOW MANY UNITS SHOULD WE SELL TO HAVE A
USUALLY THIS IS LESS THA AT TWO DOLLARS PER CHIP
IS IT
TO TO MAYBE TO KEEP IN MIND MAYBE TO ACCESS TO THAT MENU YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH I KNOW THAT SOM YOU SAY THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE DOING PLENTY OF A LOT OF ZAPPING
I KNOW THA I DISCOVERED THAT WHEN I DID A QUICK LOOK UH THEY DO NOW SOM THEY DO SOMETHING WHICH IS QUITE NICE NOW
TO GO FA TO GO FASTER
OR WE CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOU KNOW SOME REMOTE CONTROL HAVE UH PROTECTION AND SO YOU YOU Y
OR A OR A BALL YEAH NOT A A WHEEL BUT A BALL AND YOU SAY UH TO
YEAH THE YEAH
'S QUITE IT'S QUITE EASY WE DO THAT W WITH BACK LIGHT ON THE ON THE WHEEL
SO WE ARE HERE FOR THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING MM SO FIRST I WILL SHOW THE AGENDA SO
I WILL TRY TO SUMMARISE IT AND PUT THAT SUMMARY IN THE SHARED FOLDER IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT AFTERWARDS
SO THEN UH EACH OF YOU WILL UH LEAD A PRESENTATION ON THE TASK THAT HAS BEEN REQUIRED LAST TIME SO USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
AH YEAH MAYBE THERE
YOU PUT IT ON
OKAY SO SPECIAL NAVIGATION LINEAR ACCESS RANDOM ACCESS AND THERE'S A FOURTH ONE NO
AH YEAH PARAMETER OKAY
MAYBE YOU CAN S
SHORT CUT TO AMI SHARED FOLDER
AT AMI
YEAH BUT IN FACT WE IT IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL ACCORDING TO NEW REQUIREMENTS I RECEIVED FROM THE MANAGEMENT BO I WILL PRESENT THEM IN THE FOLLOWING
TO FIND IT
I DID NOT KNEW THAT
UH SORRY GOT A MESSAGE FROM MICROSOFT
MOREOVER TH MAYBE THOSE UH LIKE THOSE TEENAGER CUSTOMER COULD ADVICE THEIR PARENTS TO BUY THIS EQUIPMENT AND SO WE CAN WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT POINT OF VIEW I THINK OR SO
WE W IT SEEMS THAT WE NO WANT TO HAVE A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL
COS IT WOULD BE COSTLY
BECAUSE I RECEIVED THAT EMAIL FROM MANAGEMENT BOARD AND THEY SEEMS TO TELL THAT THAT IF WE WANT TO BE ON THE MARKET AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE WE SHOULD UH FOCUS ON T. V. MORE WHERE IT SEEMS THAT THE MARKET IS MORE IMPORTANT
ARE YOU OKAY
U. C. IS THE CENTRAL UNIT
TO HAVE A YOU S YOU SPEAK ABOUT WITH VOI VOICE CONTROL
STANDARD BUTTON ONE
BUT ALSO WE WE SEE THAT THAT MOST PEOPLE FIND IT FIND REMOTE CONTROLS TOO COMPLEX BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS AND THEY MAINLY USE ONLY CHANNELS AND VOLUME BUTTONS
SOME LIGHTNING STUFF TOO
THESE THESE ARE THESE TWO POINTS ARE THE MAIN FRUSTRATIONS SO MAYBE IF WE DESIGN SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE AND EASY TO UH FIND WHEN LOST IT WILL UH ADD UH A SERIOUS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
SO BUT LE LET US SEE FIRST THE NEW REQUIREMENT
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO SO THIS THIS UH IS UH IS UM IN THE THIS IS IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS WE WERE SPEAKING SO WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A VERY COMPLEX REMOTE CONTROLS TO ACCESS TELETEXT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO WELL
SO ANYWAY WE DON'T HAVE TO INCLUDE THIS FEATURE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT USED ANY MORE BY USERS THEY PREFER TO S
IF I ONE BUTTON IS STILL ONE MORE BUTTON
IF IF IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE WE HAVE TO REDUCE NUMBER OF BUTTONS COMPARED TO TH TO OUR COMPETITORS
ALSO UM SO AS AS I TOLD BEFORE UH IT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT'S ONLY FOR THE T. V. UM
AND THEN ALSO WE HAVE TO MAKE VERY UH UH CLEAR THAT THIS UH
THIS REMOTE CONTROL IS IS PART OF OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SHOW OUR CORPORATE UH LOGO AND AND COLOURS ON THE ON THE DESIGN AS WELL SO THAT UH THEY IDENTIFY IT AS ONE OF OUR PRODUCT
SO BEFORE UH FINISHING WE CAN UH DEFINE UH WHAT WOULD BE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE O TH OF THE CONTROL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WHICH BUTTON DO WE NEED WHICH FUNCTION DO WE WANT ETCETERA
IT SHOULD BE VERY SIMPLE AND MOST BUTTON ARE NEVER USED ONLY TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTON ARE ARE USED OFTEN SO I THINK WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE ON THAT POINT
UH
BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR PREVIOUS CHANNEL BUTTON IF YOU HAVE INCREMENTAL ONLY IT'S NOT UH IT ISN'T WORTH IT BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL IS EITH EITHER MINUS ONE OR PLUS ONE
SO HAVE A WHEEL FOR INCREMENTAL HAVE THE DIGITS UH ON THE LOWER SIDE THAT CAN BE CLOSED SO AS YOU SAY PROTECTED
AND UH YEAH I THINK THIS IS THE BASI
NO A WHEEL IS BETTER
WELL ALSO WE HAVE TO DECIDE UH SO IT SHOULD BE LIGHTENING IN THE DARK I THINK BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE LOST THEIR REMOTE CONTROL
SO NO L. C. D.
AND SO NO SPEECH AS WELL BECAUSE IT W IT WOULD DELAY TOO MUCH THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
SO UM I I WILL UH I WILL SO I WE WILL MOVE TO NEXT MEETING SO IN AFTER THE LUNCH BREAK UH HERE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL UH ACTION UH YOU ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUT YOU WILL BE UH RECALLED TO THE ACTIONS BY UH EMAIL I THINK BUT YOU CAN TAKE NOTES IF YOU IF YOU WANT BUT WELL THE INSTRUCTION WILL BE SENT
THANK YOU FOR UH YOUR SUGGESTION AND I I WILL MAKE A SUMMARY OF THAT MEETING THAT I WILL PUT IN THE SHARED FOLDER YOU CAN'T SEE AND UH AND THEN YOU WILL UM YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN UH HAS BEEN SAID ON ON THIS MEETING AND AND WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED
UH MAYBE FOR NEXT MEETING UH SEND ME YOUR PRESENTATION BEFORE BY EMAIL SO THAT WE CAN SEE THEM UH ALTOGETHER
SO YEAH I I'M IT'S IN THE FIRST UH EMAIL SO I'M PARTICIPANT ONE AT AMI UH WHERE IS THAT IT'S HERE
PARTICIPANT ONE AT AMI
SO SEE YOU AFTER LUNCH BREAK
SO NOW THE RECENT INVESTIGATION WE WE HAVE DONE FO OF THE REMOTE CONTROL UM
AND THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS TO TO IS THAT THE CO REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
SO MAYBE IF OUR REMOTE CONTROL HAVE TO BE A FRUIT FORM OR VEGETABLE FORM SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR
AN AND AND UH THIS UH YOU CAN YEAH YOU CAN SAY THAT
YOU CA UH YOU CAN GO UH BEFORE BEFORE YES
AND YOU KNOW HERE THE MORE IZ IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL AFTER IS UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE AND AFTER THE EASY TO USE
OH COLOUR YEAH
OH I I
YOU KNOW THE PEAR IS LIKE THAT AND IT'S IT'S EASY TO TO HAVE IN IN HAND AND UH
YOU WE UH AN EMAIL FROM THE MANUFACTURING DIVISION THAT THEY HAVE BASICALLY A VOICE RECOGNITION CHIP ALREADY DEVELOPED
IT SAYS THAT RI RIGHT NOW THEY JUST USE IT TO UH TO RECORD UH ANSWERS TO PARTICULAR QUESTIONS
YEAH YOU RECO RECOGNIZE COMMANDS AND YOU CAN RECORD NEW COMMANDS AND STUFF SO IF THEY ALREADY HAVE IT AS UH AS A CHIP
IS
BUT IN TH IN THE DARK UH
BUT IF YOU MOVE IT THEN YOU HAVE IT YOU DON'T NEED TO FIND IT
YOU CAN SEE THE BUTTONS BETTER OF COURSE
BUT IF YOU MOVE IT THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SENSOR TO WHEN YOU MOVE IT TO DETECT YOUR MOVEMENT
SO UH MY ONE IT UH SHOULD BE IN THE SHARED FOLDER
THAT'S THE MAJOR IDEA AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE
SO I JUST LOOK AT SOME CURRENT DESIGNS UH ON THE WEB OF USUALLY MORE COMPLICATED REMOTE CONTROLS
AND LET'S LOOK AT TWO OF THEM BECAUSE UH TH EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE MANY BUTTONS THEY LOOK QUITE SIMPLE
WELL THIS THESE UH THESE REMOTES ARE QUITE BIG SO GO TO THE NEXT PAGE SO
WE HAVE ALL THESE BUTTONS AS YOU CAN SEE BUT MOST OF THEM WE JUST NEED THE ONES IN THE MIDDLE
UH UNTIL THE TEN ALSO THIS MIDDLE PART AND ON THE LEFT ONE IS EXACTLY THE SAME
FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THAT THE VOLUME AND THE BUTTONS THAT ARE THERE ON THE TOP ARE NOT VERY EASY TO REACH WITH YOUR THUMB
IT COULD BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR EXAMPLE
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THESE INPUT BUTTONS AND THIS OTHER STUFF THAT THEY HAVE
YOU OPEN IT IT CAN BREAK YOU CA YOU CAN DO VARIOUS THINGS
UH AND IT'S EASY TO PRESS THE OTHER THE BIG BUTTONS BUT UH IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO PRESS THE THE CHANNEL BUTTONS EITHER
LIKE BUTTONS FOR T UH TUNING THE CHANNELS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YEAH THIS IS JUST THE THE WHEEL
WE COULD USE THE SOME WHEELS CAN BE PUSHED DOWN COULD USE THE PUSH DOWN OF THE WHEEL FOR THE RECORD IF WE WANT
UH SO WE COULD JUST BASICALLY USE ONE JUST WHEEL AND UH USER COULD USE JUST THE WHEEL TO DO EVERYTHING WITH THE CHANNELS IN THAT CASE
WELL WOU WOU I THINK WE CAN CERTAINLY JUST PUT THE ELECTRONICS IN A SPONGY THING IT IT WOULD WORK RIGHT
YOU CAN THROW IT TO THE TELEVISION
HEY THAT'S A COOL ONE
IS THERE ANY FRUIT THAT IS SPONGY
AND YOU MOVE UH YOUR HAND HERE TO PRESS THE BUTTONS AND THEN YOU MOVE UH ON THE OTHER SIDE
SO YOU CAN HAVE IT ON ON TWO SIDES AND IT'LL BE COOL NO
AH HA
THE ONLY TH
Y YEAH THAT CAN BE IN INSIDE TH IN THE STRUCTURE
BUT UH THE THING IS THAT THE BUTTONS AND THE WHEEL HAVE TO BE I MEAN IF IT'S SPONGY THEN THE BUTTONS AND THE WHEEL HAVE TO I MEAN IF IT'S SPONGY THEN IT'S GOING TO MOVE
SO IF WE TRY TO PUSH THE BUTTONS IT YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
WELL USUALLY HOLD 'KAY WE WANT IT TO BE GOOD ALSO FOR THE LEFT HAND USERS RIGHT
UH
SA LET'S SAY THAT TH O IT HAS TO BE BASICALLY YOU CAN ONLY TAKE TWO SIDES
ONE ON THS THIS SIDE WHERE IS THE THUMB AND THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THERE IS UH YEAH ALSO THE THUMB
OR YOU COULD USE USE THIS ONE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO USE THIS ONE FOR THE WHEEL
THE OP
WHEEL WHEEL BUTTONS
YEAH THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU HAVE BUTTONS AND WHEEL THEN WHEN YOU TURN IT AROUND THE BUTTONS ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE
SO YOU CANNOT SEE THEM
SO THE BUTTONS HAVE TO BE HERE AND THE WHEEL HAS TO BE
Y
YEAH I KNOW BUT UH IF YOU HOLD WITH YOUR LEFT HAND AND THE WHEEL IS HERE
AND THE BUTTONS ARE HERE THEN WHEN YOU TURN IT AROUND THE BUTTONS WILL BE ON THE OTHER SIDE
ON SOME WEB PAGES TO FIND SOME DOCUMENTATION AND I THINK A REMOTE CONTROL IS AS I S MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY
THE PUSH BUTTON ARE USUALLY EXTREMELY CHEAP BUT I JUST HAVE ONE PROBLEM AND THIS IS RELATED WITH THE WHEEL SENSOR WHICH SEEMS TO BE QUITE EXPENSIVE
UM THE I I JUST WANT TO MENTION THE THE PROBLEM OF THE THE R
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY EXPENSIVE BUT AT THE END THIS IS PLENTY OF UNEXPEN EH VERY CHEAP DEVICES BUT UH THE BILL STARTS TO BE
FIRST OF ALL I WAS THINKING TO HAVE A A CONTINUOUS LIGHT AND YOU W WHEN T YOU YOU YOU YOU PRESS THE ON BUTTON YOU HAVE THE LIGHT ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
TO S
ME TOO
AH IT'S OKAY
AND FOR MAYBE LOOK AND FEEL WHAT ABOUT A A PIECE OF ICE
YOU Y YOU DON'T USE THE BANANA WHEN THE BANANA IS CURVING LIKE THAT BUT WHEN THE BANANA IS CURVING LIKE THAT
WITH THE WHEEL ON THE TOP AND TO CONTROL AND HERE YOU HAVE A A PUSH BUTTON TO
IF YOU IF YOU START WITH UH FANCY FRUITS AND FRA S AND THA
SO WE WILL JUST USE A A STANDARD BATTERY
I JUST WANT TO HAVE SO SOMETHING TO PRIN TO TO FIX MY MY COMPONENTS ONTO THAT BOX AND THAT'S IT
UH I WILL TAKE NOTES DURING THIS MEETING SO UH THAT YOU CAN UH LOOK AT MY UH FOLDER TO SEE THE SUMMARY OF THIS MEETING AFTERWARDS
WE'LL THEN T TAKE DECISION IN CONCERT AND THEN UH UH WE WILL UH DEFINE THE NEST NEXT TASK TO HAVE TO BE DONE BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING
WE ALSO DECIDED TO HAVE A WHEEL TO CHANGE CHANNEL PREVIOUS CHANNEL BUTTON
AND FOR FAST DEVELOPMENT AND LOW COST WE HAVE DECIDED TO HAVE NO L. C. D. NO VOICE FEATURES
MAYBE I CAN SWITCH SLIDE UH ON YOUR REQUEST
SO WILL WILL WILL THIS WITH UH INCLUDING ALL POSSIBLE THINGS SO BUTTONS WHEEL AND THE CHIP BE UH LOWER THAN TWELVE EUROS TO PRODUCE
AND COULD IT BE ADAPTED
YOU CAN EASILY FIND THE BUTTON IN THE DARK OR SO
IT WILL BE TURNED ON WHEN THE WHEN THE USER MOVE THE REMOTE CONTROL I THINK NO
THE OTHER PRESENTATIONS
AND ALSO DOES IT UH FIT WELL IN HAND
BECAUSE IT WAS UH TH YOUR WRIST PROBLEM WITH THE USAGE
WITH A MAYBE A MORE ERGONOMIC DESIGN ON ON THE BOTTOM PART
S
MAYBE THE WHEEL WILL BE A GOOD ADVANTAGE OVER OUR COMPETITORS
SO MAYBE IT'S WORSE TO UH TO HAVE MORE EXPENSE ON THAT'S THAT ASPECT
FOR
OR WE CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT PART MAYBE AND DISCUSS AFTERWARDS
YEAH UH SORRY
I THINK IT'S INNOVATIVE TO USE THE MM THE WHEEL BECAUSE I THINK NO ONE ELSE HAS
HAS IT
MAYBE UH UM A COLOUR THAT REMEMBER SOME FRUIT UH THINGS LIKE THAT
D D IS IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD
SO I THINK WE CAN KEEP THE WHEEL
BECAUSE IT'S UH EASY IT'S INNOVATIVE EVEN IF THE COST IS A BIT HIGHER AND WE ALSO HAVE TO FIND A
SO A FRUIT LIKE PEAR OR BANANA WIT UH ANY OTHERS IDEA YOU HAVE
ODI
I THINK IT SO
SO UH SO FOR
SORRY FOR UH COMPONENT SO
NO THE BUTTON WOULD BE IN FACT IT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING ODD SHAPED WITH A SPONGY COVER
SO WE AGREE TO PUT THE WHEEL
SO IT HAVE TO IT HAS TO BE SYMMETRICAL
WELL YOU YOU WILL GET USED TO IT
AND MOREOVER TH THE BUTTON AR ARE LIGHTED SO YOU YOU IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY THE RIGHT SIDE BECAUSE YOU HAVE LIGHT ON BUTTONS
NO YOU YOU I THINK YOU WILL USE IT ONLY ON THE RIGHT OR LEFT HAND WHETHER YOU ARE RIGHTY OR LEFTY
SO FOR INTERFACE WE SAID ALSO THAT WE HAVE UH THIS BANANA SHAPE WITH BUTTON ON THE S ON THE SIDE
YOU FEEL UH FREE TO EXPRESS WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY
SEE YOU
UH YEAH JUST A
AND AFTER WE HA WE HAVE AN AN AVERAGE AND UH WE SEE
F BETWEEN O ONE AND SEVEN
EH
NO I JUST WANT TO SEE SOMETHING
UH I THINK UH AND NEED TO AS WELL
NEED TO UH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WE HA WE HAVE TO PUT UH ONE UH F
OR MAYBE WE CAN SAY S SEVEN IS THE BEST MM
UH S YOU CAN HOW MUCH WHAT
WA CAN
SO WE WE SAID UH WE HAVE UH A NEW TECHNOLOGICAL UH THING WITH A WHEEL
UH
IS IT FASHION
IS IT IS IT ROBUST
S NOW UM SO
UH IF WE SAY THAT SEVEN IT'S UH IT'S THE BETTER AND WHEN UH S SIX SIT SIX ARE GOOD IT'S A GOOD UH P PRODUCT I THINK
S
D ARE WE INCLUDING THE VOICE ARE YOU GLU ARE WE INCLUDING THE VOICE IN THE END OR NOT
THIR
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE TEAM
AH
HI
A FOUR ALSO BECAUSE EXCEPT FOR THE WHEEL WE DON'T HAVE SO MUCH INNOVATION
UH
UH F YEAH IT'S RU IT'S RUBBER
JE CROIX QUE C'EST DOMMAGE DE LE IT WILL BE SAD TO DESTROY THIS PROTOTYPE
HI
UH I'VE I WILL ALSO TAKE NOTES DURING THIS MEETING AND I WILL SEND YOU UH A SUMMARY THEN AS USUAL
WE WILL THEN LOOK AT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA OF THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTED BY UH OUR TWO COLLEAGUES THAT MAKE GOOD WORK
AND UH THEN WE WILL SEE THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS AND THE COST OF THE PRODUCT
AND UH END
SO D LET'S START WITH THE COST ASPECT SO SO I LOOK AT THE ASPECT DISCUSSED LAST TIME THAT IS TO SAY UH TO HAVE A STANDARD BATTERY
SO FOR THE FINANCIAL ASPECT IT'S OKAY WE CAN UH WE CAN CONTINUE WITH THIS PRODUCT UH AS IF
AND WE ARE NOW GOING TO SEE THE PROJECT EVALUATION WITH UH OUR MARKETING EXPERT
SO SO DO NOTE THE GRADE WE HAVE FIVE SIX FOR ME FIVE
YEAH WE HAVE THE WHEEL
NEW ALSO
SO WE HAVE FOUR FOUR F AND FIVE
YEAH FOUR
OH YEAH ITS ITS F ITS FRUIT FRUIT SHAPE
I THINK YOU CAN'T MISS IT
IT'S HARD TO MISS IT
YEAH IT'S RUBBER MADE OF RUBBER I THINK IT'S M IT'S UH MORE RUBBER THAN UH OTHER REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH THE BE
SO HAVING THIS AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS UH QUITE ATTRACTIVE I THINK
SO THE COST IS IN THE BUDGET THE EVALUATION IS OKAY SO I TH I THINK WE CAN NOW UH OPEN CHAMPAGNE AND MAKE A HUGE PARTY
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PROVIDED BY UH BY THE MEETING STAFF
I THINK WE WILL HAVE UM MUCH BIGGER PROJECT NEXT TIME AND A MUCH BIGGER SALARY AS WELL
OKAY SO GOOD GUYS SO SEE YOU FOR NEXT UH SUCCESSFUL PROJECT
I THINK W YEAH
SO I THINK OUR KIND OF OUR TARGET HERE IS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF VERY LIKE SLEEK NICE LOOK REMOTE AND WE WANT IT TO BE FUNCTIONAL AS WELL
WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE CLUNKY LIKE LIKE THIS THING HERE
SO YOU ALL KNOW ME I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
WE NEED SOME KINDA OF POWER D POWER SOURCE
UM WE NEED A PROGRAMMABLE DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSOR TO UM TO TAKE THE INPUT FROM THE USER AND TRANSLATE THAT INTO UH
YOU NEED A ON OFF SWITCH UM I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GOT IN THERE
YOU HA THE V THE POWER SOURCE IS IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER THERE
AND THEN PASSES THAT SIGNAL ON TO THE INFRA RED L. E. D. AND THAT SIGNAL IS THEN EMITTED AND RECEIVED BY THE TELEVISION AT THE PHOTO TRANSISTOR
SO THOSE ARE THE BASIC COMPONENTS THAT NEED TO GO INTO THIS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS PRETTY MUCH UH OPEN TO MOVE AROUND
I THINK ANY DES
YEAH THIS IS JUST THIS IS JUST A BASIC LAYOUT OF EV OF ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT W W ARE GONNA BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY F TO HAVE A WORKING REMOTE
UM WELL THE MOST THE MOST COSTLY COMPONENTS ARE GONNA BE THE CHIP AND THE UH TH IT COULD ALS BASICALLY THE USER INTERFACE AND THE CASING ARE GONNA BE EXPENSIVE AS WELL
UM THE L. E. D. AND THE THE TRANSISTORS AND EVERYTHING ELSE ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY CHEAP
UM DEPENDING ON THE N AMOUNT OF MEMORY WE NEED IN THERE AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND H AND H YOU KNOW HOW MUCH POWER
WE UH WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL WE GET TO A MORE SPECIFIC DESIGN PHASE FOR THAT
RIGHT AS FAR AS I IT'S JUST UH THE COST OF AN EXTRA BUTTON
I THINK I HA
HOW MANY PEOPLE HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE EVERY FEATURE THAT AR YOU KNOW I LIKE THESE TRAINABLE REMOTES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S JUST SO CONFUSING TO DO TO USE ALL THESE FUNCTIONS
I THINK THE MORE BELLS AND WHISTLES WE ADD IT'S JUST GONNA CUT INTO OUR INTO OUR PROFITS
BECAUSE I THINK AS WE AS WE ADD COSTS FOR THINGS LIKE UH FOR LIKE IF WE ADD THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND THINGS LIKE THAT
US US USER INTERFACE
UM WHAT WE CAN DO IS WELL YOU KNOW THAT BATTERIES THROWING A AW REMOTES RUN THROUGH BATTERIES LIKE CRAZY
AND S FOR SOME PEOPLE YEAH
BUT ALSO FOR THE JUST FOR THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE REMOTE AS AS A WHOLE
YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE SOME KIND OF NEAT LITTLE YOU KNOW A SEXY DESIGN FOR D A CRADLE AND THE REMOTE ITSELF
WHAT I CAN DO IS I CAN D LOOK INTO HO WELL PEDRO AND I CAN LOOK INTO HOW MUCH THIS MIGHT INCREASE OUR OUR COSTS AND YOU CAN LOOK INTO WHAT KIND OF EFFECT AN INCREASED COST IS GONNA HAVE ON OUR ON OUR FINAL NUMBERS
BECAUSE IN ORDER TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO PRICE IT AT THAT KIND OF LEVEL I THINK WE'D NEED TO HAVE EVERY FUNCTIONALITY THAT ALL THE OTHER COMPETITORS ARE OFFERING LIKE BEING ABLE TO OPERATE
WHICH IS A PRETTY BASIC FUNCTION THAT W WE'VE OPTED OUT OF
BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME BASIC FEATURES THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT A LOT OF OTHER REMOTES ARE GOING TO HAVE
I THINK OUR MARKET NICHE IS BASICALLY PEOPLE WHO NEED WHO HAVE LOST THEIR REMOTE OR UH WHO'VE BROKEN THEIR REMOTE AND DON'T WANNA SEND BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER
THEY JUST WANNA RUN OUT TO THE STORE AND GET A REMOTE
WE HE WELL HERE'S MY THING ABOUT THAT
IF IT CAN'T CONTROL IF IT CAN'T CONTROL YOUR YOUR D. V. D. PLAYER AND A AL IF Y IF YOU CAN'T GET THAT ALL IN ONE ULTIMATE REMOTE
SO I THINK WHAT WE SO THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING
WELL THE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS WE MAY END UP WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF INVENTORY OF A OF A POOR DESIGN YOU KNOW
HAVE A FEW DESIGNS TO LOOK AT AND THEN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE IS YOU KNOW THE BEST FIT
I THINK I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE LOOK AT IT AN AND FEEL LIKE IT ITS LIKE A QUALITY REMOTE
JUST TO TOUCH ON M MY POINT ONE LAST TIME THAT I HAD BROUGHT UP
UM I REALLY UN UNLESS YOU GUYS ARE DIE HARD AGAINST THE FACT THAT UM IT'S POSSIBLE LIKE IT REDUCES THE USABILITY OF THE REMOTE B AND THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T LOSE IT ON YOUR OWN
BECAUSE I REALLY THINK I IN A CERTAIN SENSE IT ALMOST LIKE FOR ME I WOULD WANT TO HAVE THAT JUST
OH I BETTER GO FIND THE REMOTE AND PUT IT BACK WHERE IT BELONGS
AS A WATCH
NOW HOPEFULLY WE'VE ALL GOT A BETTER IDEA FROM THAN WE DID F LEAVING THE LAST MEETING AS TO WHAT IT IS WE ARE UP TO NOW
AS I WAS STRUGGLING TO OUR LAST TIME UH AND THAT'LL BE EASIER FOR ME NOW BECAUSE I'M NOT ACTUALLY GIVING THE WHOLE PRESENTATION
RIGHT FORTY MINUTES FOR THIS MEETING SO A BIT MORE TIME THAN THE LAST ONE
HERE'S THE ADDITIONAL POINTS I JUST WANTED TO PUT THOSE IN THERE TO SEE IF YOU GUYS HAD ANY COMMENTS
WELL THA THAT FIRST POINT COULD UH ALSO BE AN OP OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IN SEEING THAT TELETEXT IS BECOMING OUTDATED
BUT THERE'S ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR MARK THERE'S A MARKET HERE FOR OUR LOST TELETEXT
FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE THAT JUST GOES TO THE SHOP THAT WANTS A REPLACEMENT WANTS IT AS CHEAP AS POSSIBLE
K YEAH
ON THE PRODUCT YEAH
SO WE HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS AND I THINK WE'LL GO IN
BUT I T I THINK WHAT THE THE MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATION WAS LESS THAT THERE'S A WORRY THAT TELETEXT WILL BECOME OUTDATED RATHER THAN WE SHOULDN'T HAVE IT
IF YOU IF YOU'RE GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN A T A REMOTE WITH TELETEXT OR WITHOUT UH WHEN IT REALLY IF IT I IF IT ISN'T MORE EXPENSIVE FOR US TO K MAKE BECAUSE AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT
WELL THERE THERE IS A FOR EXAMPLE ON DIGITAL T. V. SYSTEMS YOU HAVE YOU CAN PRESS A BUTTON AND YOU CAN BUY THINGS IN ADVERTS
YEAH AND THERE'S OTHER FEATURES FOR EXAMPLE ON OTHER SYSTEMS WHERE YOU CAN PAUSE LIVE T. V. AND THINGS LIKE THAT
SO NOW THE THINGS TO THINK HERE ARE THAT THAT THERE'S GONNA BE MORE FUNCTIONALITY POTENTIALLY THAT WE CAN HANDLE
AN OKAY BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MIGHT MIGHT DO AS WELL IN FUTURE PROOFING IT
BU UH
I'LL COMMUNICATE THAT BACK TO THOSE GUYS THERE A A AND TH THE MESSAGE REALLY WE WANNA BE SENDING TO THEM IS THAT
ALTHOUGH TELETEXT MAY BECOME OUTDATED W THERE'S NO L LOGIC IN NOT HAVING IT IN THERE ANYWAY
SO IF WE'RE KEEPING IT BASIC WE'RE LOO LOO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO SELL IT BASICALLY IS IT'S UH JUST BEING VERY EASY TO USE
BUT I IF DESIGN IF DESIGN IS CHEAP AND FUNCTIONALITY IS BASIC
THEN TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS PROBABLY A HIGH PRICE FOR A COMMONER GARDEN STAN STANDARD T. V. SO THE PLACE UH REMOTE THE THEN THE PLACE WE'RE GOING TO JUSTIFY THAT COST IS THROUGH THROUGH DESIGN THROUGH MAKING IT A A SLEEK ELEGANT HIGH PRICED BASIC REMOTE
SORRY THAT KINDA CUT INTO YOU THERE
IS THAT
UH SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT IN
IS IT
DOES ANY OF THE UM THE FEATURES THAT PEDRO'S SPOKEN ABOUT HERE HAVE ANY IMPLICATIONS WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT ON IN TERMS OF JUST PURE FUNCTIONALITY
IN TERMS OF MAKING IT WORK OR THE COST OF THAT OR
WE WE WELL DO WE NECESSARILY HAVE TO CHANGE THE END COST BECAUSE UH
AND AND TH TO GET TO BACK TO ANOTHER POINT SORRY UH UH FOR CUTTING IN BUT
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TRAIN THEM TO THE INDIVIDUAL ONE ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS IS KNOW THE THE F LIKE SOME FOUR DIGIT CODE
THE THE ONE THING THAT THAT THAT YOU SAID REALLY STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME HERE IN THAT WE'RE WE'RE CARRYING THE CORPORATE IDENTITY WITH THE PRODUCT
WE WANT PEOPLE TO EVENTUALLY SAY OH THAT'S THAT'S REAL REACTION THAT'S A GOOD M MAKE
AND AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT WE'RE GONNA WIN MIND SHARE BY UH EITHER BEING A FANTASTIC PRODUCT OR FOR IT WORKING
IT JUST BEING GOOD REASONABLE PRICED AND SOLID
IS TWENTY FIVE EUROS A MID MARKET PRICE FOR A REMOTE
THE OTHER THE O THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IN MY MIND I JUST THINK OFF HAND AS A AS A CONSUMER WOULD I WANNA BUY THAT
AND I THINK MAYBE NOT BECAUSE I'VE GOT A REMOTE AND I'LL TAKE IT TO DIFFERENT CHAIRS
I'LL TAKE IT TO DIFFERENT I W I DON'T WANNA GO OVER SOMEWHERE AND PUT IT DOWN
AND THAT IMPLIES THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE T. V. USER
SO IT'S VERY GOOD FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT IT'S NOT A LIKE
YOU HAVE TO D SHIFT DOWN THE SIDE OF THE COUCH TO FIND IT AND PUT IT BACK AND
I D I D I D I THINK IT IT IN MY MIND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING THAT OH I'D REALLY WANT UH BECAUSE OF THAT FACT
THIS HASN'T BEEN DONE IN A WHILE I THINK BUT TH AS A AS A WATCH
SO IT MIGHT NOT BE EASY TO MARKET IN IT UH BUT THE THE TECHNOLOGIES CAME ALONG AND IT MIGHT BE CHEAPER TO MAKE NOW
THOSE THINGS MAY HAVE BEEN INEXPENSIVE FOR ALL I KNOW
WHEREAS ACTUALLY JUST PUTTING IT IN A POWER CRADLE MIGHT NOT BE TOO EXPENSIVE AT ALL BECAUSE THAT'S JUST DONE WITH MOBILE PHONES YOU CAN JUST N WE WE HAVE SAID WE HAVE ACTUALLY SIMILAR PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN TAKE FROM AND POTENTIALLY CUT COSTS THERE
UM NEED TO LOOK INTO WHETHER WE CAN DO THAT BUT UH I THINK WE WE HAVE SOME M MOBILE PHONE BASED PRODUCTS UH CHECKING QUICKLY OUR INTERNET
USING THAT TECHNOLOGY
YEAH I THINK SO WITHOUT IT BEING TOO IN FACT WE CAN CUT COSTS THROUGH USING THE MANUFACTURING THAT'S ALREADY GONNA BE IN PLACE HERE
WELL UH WHAT COMES UP FOR ME IS THAT IF WE'RE GONNA IF WE'RE GONNA BE MARKETING A PRODUCT THAT IS GOING TO BE UH HAVING NO TELETEXT
SO THAT'S FROM A MARKETING PERSPECTIVE I I SEE I SEE A LACK
SO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS I SEE THAT ONE SIDE WE'RE ELIMINATING SOMETHING SO WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER SIDE WHICH IS
WHAT ARE WE GONNA BE TARGETING OUR MARKET UH THAT IDENTIFIES OUR PRODUCT AS BETTER THAN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TELETEXT IT HAS TA TA TA TA TA
WHAT ARE WE BRINGING IN TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THIS AND WE HAVE TO D IN MY OPINION WE HAVE TO DOUBLE UP
N OKAY
I IN THE VERY BEGINNING IT SAID WITH THE WITH THE ADVENT OF COMPUTERS THERE'S GONNA BE THE IT'S GONNA BE OUT MODED TELETEXT
I I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE TWO THINGS ARE CONNECTED
HOW DOES HOW DOES COMPUTERS AND TELETEXT H HOW WHY IS ONE ELIMINATING THE NEED OF THE OTHER
YEAH 'CAUSE YEAH I JUST I DON'T SEE THE CROSS OVER BETWEEN COMPUTERS AND TELEVISION
I MEAN I DO SEE THE CROSS OVER IN SOME SENSE BUT BUT BUT BUT WITH THE THE REMOTE IS IS USED FOR TELEVISION OKAY
S
YEAH I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE LOGIC
I I DON'T SEE THE LOGIC IN ELIMINATION OF TELETEXT I JUST I I BUT I'M NOT A TECH MIND EITHER
I JUST DON'T SEE THE CROSS OVER BETWEEN COMPUTERS AND AND AND 'CAUSE WE ARE DESIGNING SOMETHING FOR A TELEVISION OKAY
IT'S WHAT I'M SEEING IS A IS A MID RANGE COST PRODUCT
SO SO W WE CAN'T GO AND PUMP A WHOLE BUNCH OF TECHNOLOGY INTO THIS THING BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE GONNA HAVE COST OVERRUNS
SO IF WE DROP IF WE ARE GONNA CHOOSE TO DROP TELETEXT AGAIN WHAT ARE WE ADDING TO THE PRODUCT THAT MAKES IT MARKETABLE
I DON'T I DON'T SEE IT
AND TO ME IF I'M GONNA MARKET A PRODUCT FOR B FOR BEAUTY FOR FOR DESIGN I'M GONNA I'M GONNA TRY TO MARKET IT AT A MUCH HIGHER PRICE
SO I WOULD MARKET THIS PRODUCT IT AT EIGHTY NINE EUROS AND COME UP WITH SOME REALLY BEAUTIFUL EXTERIOR DESIGN OR SOMETHING TH BUT BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY
NO I NO I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY BUT WHAT I'M WHAT I'M OKAY WE PROBABLY NEED TO MOVE ALONG BUT MY MY CONCERN IS TRYING TO FIND A MARKETING NICHE FOR THIS PRODUCT
OH P PEDRO I JUST WANT TO SAY QUICKLY I I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT WHEN YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOME MORE BELLS AND WHISTLES EH
IS THAT FOR OVER HERE
'CAUSE UH AND I THINK OF VOICE ACTIVATED I THINK OF OF HOW MANY TIMES I'VE I'VE LOST MY MY REMOTE AND I CAN'T FIND IT
THEIR D. V. D. S THEIR THEIR TELEVISIONS AND WE'RE COMING OUT WITH ONE REMOTE FOR TELEVISION ONLY
AND SO TO ME WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS A REALLY SPECIAL PRODUCT I I I DON'T S I REALLY HAVE TO SAY I DON'T SEE THE MARKET NICHE FOR THIS PRODUCT
AT THIS PRICE I DON'T SEE IT YET
I'M I I GO ALONG WITH THIS BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GIVEN TO TRY TO MARKET BUT I I DON'T SEE THE MARKET NICHE FOR THIS PRODUCT
OKAY WELL SO SO THAT'S UP TO YOU THEN TO TO MAKE THIS BOX IN SOMETHING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY
MAYBE MAKE IT IN THE FORM OF A GUN
WELL YOU KNOW FOR MARKETING F MARKETING FOR ME IS UH AND UH HOW DO I GO HERE
GO GO
IS THAT RIGHT
AH HA
OKAY 'TIL YOU SPOKE AND WHEN I WROTE THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M MARKETING
AS A MANUFACTURER AND AS A AS A UM DISTRIBUTOR T TO OTHER WHOLESALERS
AND SO THE TH THE TWENTY FIVE EUROS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS THE SALE PRICE IS A WHOLESALE PRICE RATHER THAN A RETAIL PRICE
UM SO WHAT I DID IS I I DECIDED THAT THAT THIS THIS NEEDS TO BE A PRODUCT IN A IN A SENSE CAN MARKET ITSELF
SO WHAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED HERE AS OUR MAIN MARKETING STRATAGEM IS IS IN DESIGN
WE'RE MAKING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ATTRACTIVE UH WHATEVER WE DECIDE IT IS
SO I SAY INSPIRATION SO HAVING SOMETHING BEAUTY SOMETHING ATTRACTIVE UH SOMETHING THAT IN A SENSE WILL SELL ITSELF
UH I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT UH WHO WE ARE AS A AS A CORPORATION THAT WE'RE NEW WE'RE AGGRESSIVE
SO TO ME IT'S ABOUT SELLING D UH OUR IDENTITY OUR CORPORATE IDENTITY ALONG WITH THE PRODUCT
UH WE'RE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MARKET BUT WHAT I'M SEEING IS THAT THE MARKET IS READY FOR I I IDENTIFIED NEW TECHNOLOGY
BUT AGAIN BECAUSE WHAT I SEE IS BUDGET RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN BRING ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY INTO THIS THING
BUT BOY WE CAN SELL THIS THING BECAUSE THERE'S NO BATTERIES IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE I WE CAN IDENTIFY IT AS A SAFER PRODUCT IN SOME FORM
I REALLY SEE BUT THE COST I
NO NO WE HAVE T WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE END COST
THERE'S UH I MEAN I DON'T SEE IT ANYWAY
WELL SEE I I SEE I I'M AN ADVOCATE TO MAKE THIS AN EXCLUSIVE PRODUCT
EVERY HOME'S GOT TO HAVE IT
OH YOU'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE OH FANTASTIC I WANT ONE OF THOSE TOO
YEP ONE ONE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS H THEY'VE THEY'VE GIVEN US THIS PACKAGE OKAY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF ROLE WE HAVE IN THIS IN THE CORPORATE LADDER UH
BUT TO ME IT'S LIKE OKAY YOU HAVE GOT YOUR HERE'S OUR IDEAS OKAY
AND THEN LET THEM LOOK AT THOSE IDEAS AND THEY SAY YEAH WELL
WE CAN WE CAN RAISE THE PRICE TWENTY PERCENT YOU KNOW WE LIKE THIS IDEA THIS IDEA NO
BUT TO ME IT'S IT'S ABOUT A CHOICE DO WE FOLLOW THEIR DIRECTIVES OR DO WE MAKE UH PRESENTATIONS BACK AND AND THEN AND THEN DISCUSS
BECA I I DO NOT I DO NOT SEE THE MARKET NICHE FOR THE PRODUCT THAT THEY'RE HANDING F HANDING US RIGHT NOW
I DON'T SEE IT
NOPE THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THE PRODUCT AS NOT WORKING FOR ANYTHING BUT TELEVISIONS
THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THIS PRODUCT LIMITA THAT'S WHY I SAY I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE MARKET NICHE FOR THIS
IF WE IF W IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A PRODUCT THAT WORKED FOR D. V. D. S V. C. R. S AND EVERYTHING
THEN I CAN SEE THE MARKET NICHE BUT WE WE'RE ONLY IDENTIFIED AS GOING FOR TELEVISIONS WITHOUT TELETEXT
AND IT'S LIKE WHOA WE HA IN MY OPINION WE HAVE TO GO WITH SOMETHING THAT'S EXTREMELY EXCLUSIVE TO MAKE THIS THING MARKETABLE
W OKAY IF YOU IF YOU DROP THE COST NOW IF YOU MAKE IF YOU MAKE GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COST SCALE
AND YOU MAKE IT LESS EXPENSIVE THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW WE'RE GOING INTO AN A A NEW MARKET AREA
IN A DISCOUNT RIGHT NOW YOU CAN BUY 'EM ON SALE SOMETIMES FOR ABOUT ABOUT UH EIGHTEEN
IT'S GOTTA BE LOW COST OR HIGH COST WITH WITH SPECIAL DESIGN FEATURES
OR MY D
I MEAN I I WELL WE G WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER END NOW
I LIKE THE IDEA BUT WE HAVE T WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA GO IN THIS DIRECTION TO ME WE'RE GOING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COST RANGE
ARE WE GONNA MAKE THIS SELLING SELLING THE COST AS A HIGH HIGH TECH UH UM ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE WHATEVER
AGAIN I DON'T SEE OUR MARKET NICHE IN THE MIDDLE FOR OUR PRODUCT YET
I DON'T SEE IT YET
W A QUESTION I HAVE IN IN A 'CAUSE I I I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU ON WE GOTTA MAKE IT A BOX
HAVE A MODERN HAVE A TRADITIONAL HAVE A YOU KNOW AND SO SO INSTEAD OF THEM ALL LOOKING THE SAME
A REMOTE THAT'S THAT DOESN'T MAYBE LOOK LIKE A REMOTE
JUST JUST OKAY 'CAUSE I MEAN WE ALL KNOW WHAT A REMOTE LOOKS LIKE ON THE OUTSIDE
MAYBE THAT COULD BE PART OF OUR DESIGN EXCLUSIVITY IS WE MAKE A REMOTE THAT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE A REMOTE IT IT OPENS LIKE A TELEPHONE
IS THAT THE P OUR TARGET MARKET IS GONNA BE SOMEONE WHO HAS LOST OR BROKEN WE GOTTA STOP
AND AND THEN AND THEN DESIGN THE PRODUCT MAYBE SOME COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT THAT CAN IDENTIFY THIS AS THE LAST ONE YOU'LL EVER NEED TO BUY
SO WE HAVE THE C WE PROBABLY HAVE HAVE ON LINE IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEM WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
OH LOOK IT HERE
SO THEN THE DOUBLE R. WILL BE OUR OUR
I THO I THO I THOU
UH
WHAT I FOUND IS WE WANT TO DO FASHION AND I THINK HONESTLY WE SHOULD KEEP TECHNOLOGY LOW AND JUST SIMPLE BASICALLY AND TRY TO AIM FOR DESIGN
SO WE MA WE HAVE TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD
THE BIG CHUNKY REMOTES ARE DIED IN THE EIGHTIES
AND UM ALTHOUGH MO MOST PEOPLE WILL BUY S
TELEVISIONS AND EVERYTHING FOR UH THAT HAVE LOADS OF LOADS OF LITTLE FUNCTIONS AND EVERYTHING AND THEY MOSTLY END UP USING SIMPLE FUNCTIONS AND LITTLE THINGS AND MOST THE PEOPLE WON'T WON'T GET TOO MAD OF ACTUALLY HAVING TO GO THE TO THE S TO THE TELEVISION TO
FOR INSTANCE TUNE IN THEIR THE STATIONS
UM AS FOR WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR UH THE THE INTERFACE DESIGN AND UH I WILL CHANGE THE COLOURS ON THE ON THE LOGO
BUT UM WE SHOULD GO FOR THE USER ORIENTED DEVICE SO SIMPLE CONTROLS AND GOOD ERGONOMICS
UM AND UH ALTHOUGH I TH I TH I'M STILL HERE RECOMMENDING THE TELETEXT SO I'LL REMOVE THAT I GUESS BUT UM WE SHOULD GO FOR THE
YEAH THE THEY'RE BASICALLY AIMING AT SAYING THAT YOU WOULD USE YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TELETEXT TO BE THE EASIEST WAY TO CHECK LIKE FOR UH UH THE SCHEDULING AND THE NEXT PROGRAMME AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND NOW
YEAH AND NOW YOU CAN C LOOK IT OVER INTERNET
YEAH BUT WE WOULD INCREASE THE PRICE TO TRY TO MAKE IT A TRAINABLE ONE SO
ONE WAY THE OTHER TELETEXT WAS THERE BUT I GUESS WE CAN REMOVE IT OR YOU KNOW MAKE TWO SEPARATE INTERFACE DESIGNS
NO JUST I I WOULD I WOULD ADVOCATE FOR CONTINUING TELETEXT AND THOSE WOULD BE THE BASIC COMMANDS
UM AS FOR YOU KNOW THE THE CASE DESIGN UH MAYBE I'LL COME UP WITH MORE CONCRETE IDEAS
I THINK TECHNOLOGY WE'D WE WE'RE NOT IN THE PRICE RANGE TO DO IT
WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT TOWARDS T F TECHNOLOGY SO WE SHOULD WE SHOULD AIM AT DESIGN
YEAH Y Y YOU YOU WOULDN'T
UH WE SHOULD KEEP IT SIMPLE MM MEDIUM LOW COST MAR UM COST AREA AND UH MAKE IT LOOK GOOD
AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE BUTTONS WHICH KINDA PRESS DOWN LITTLE RUBBER NUBBIES INTO THESE LITTLE HOLES THAT ACTIVATE
UM YOU'VE GOT THE L. E. D. HERE ON THE END OF THE UH UH ON THE END OF THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD
SO UM WE'VE GOT A I IN THIS IN THIS UH DRAWING HE UH IN THIS EXAMPLE HERE THIS IS A EIGHTEEN PIN UM UH CHIP I DUNNO
UM TH OUR TECH DEPARTMENT ALSO SAID WE HAVE THE OPTION OF DOING SOME KIND OF HAND DYNAMO WHERE MAYBE YOU CRANK IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S REALLY I DON'T KNOW WE GOT SOME QU CRAZY GUYS DOWN THERE IN THAT DEPARTMENT SO
UH WE'VE GOT SOLAR CELLS
M BATTERY VERSUS CRADLE I THINK IS YEAH
IT COULD BE FUN
WELL IT IS IT IS MORE UH I MEAN IT IS MORE ECO FRIENDLY THAN THE THAN THE CRADLE 'CAUSE YOU'RE STILL USING POWER OFF THE GRID WITH THE CRADLE
OUR MATERIAL CHOICES ARE A PLASTIC LATEX UM TY OR PLASTIC A RUBBER LATEX TYPE THING UH WOOD OR TITANIUM
AND WHAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO AND I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST OPTION IS TO COMBINE SOME A COUPLE OF THESE
TO MAKE IT UM TO MAK UH LIKE A THICK PLASTIC INNER SHELL AND A T UM KIND OF A TO HAVE THAT RUBBER OUTER SHELL TO MAKE IT MORE DURABLE
THE ADVANTAGES OF WORKING WITH PLASTIC AND RUBBER IS W WE WE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE UM OPTIONS JUST IN TERMS OF SHAPE BECAUSE YOU CAN EXTRUDE PLASTIC IN BASICALLY ANY SHAPE YOU WANT
IN THEIR UM IN THEIR MESSAGE TO ME THAT THEY WERE REFERRING TO THE NUMBER OF TH CURVES IN THE BOTTOM
I HAVE NO IDEA EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME UNCURVED FLAT CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED
I WOULD GUESS THIS LIKE THIS PEN WOULD BE KINDA LIKE A DOUBLE CURVED WHERE IT'S CURVED ON M M MULTIPLE AXES RIGHT
I THINK CURVED MEANS JUST CURVED IN ONE AXIS AND DOUBLE CURVED IS CURVED IN TWO AXES
I HAVE NO IDEA
OH OKAY OH LIKE A WAVE OKAY
UM SO THESE ARE ALL OPTIONS THAT THE USER INTERFACE GUY CAN UH HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL TO PUT TOGETHER A USER INTERFACE
FOR ELECTRONICS WE HAVE THESE VERY TECHNICAL UM DESCRIPTIONS HERE
A SIMPLE CHIP WHICH IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE BUT I HAVE NO NUMBERS TO GIVE YOU A REGULAR CHIP
YES THE DIFFERENCE IS WITH A SIMPLE CHIP A SIMPLE CHIP WILL OPERATE OH WHY DOESN'T THIS SCROLL UP
IF THE T. V. IS WORKING YEAH
THAT'S JUST I MEAN IT'LL IF SOMEBODY SAYS UP IN THE MIDDLE OF A
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE PICTURE
THAT'S JUST A THAT'S JUST SOMETHING HE A A GRAPHIC HE USED TO SHOW YOU THE LAYOUT OF WHAT THE LAYOUT OF THE BUTTONS MIGHT BE LIKE
WELL RIGHT I THINK THE TWO BIG TH POINTS THAT WE HAVE SO FAR ARE THE HAVING THE CRADLE AND ALSO HAVING UH THE UM THE ACTUAL DESIGN OF THE UH CASE ITSELF HAVING LIKE THIS LIKE RUBBER SHELL MAYBE WITH A PLASTIC INTERIOR
HAVING IT LOOK REALLY NICE UM AND ALSO BE REALLY DURABLE
TH THEY ARE GONNA BE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I MEAN IT
BUT I MEAN I WOULD JUST USE IF I WAS GONNA DO THIS I WOULD JUST USE THE SCROLL WHEEL FOR S CHANNELS UP AND CHANNELS DOWN
WELL NO MA YEAH MAYBE A BIT MORE THEN TH IS ON HERE BUT JU JUST AS A KIND OF AN INSPIRATION
SO THE ONLY INFORMATION YOU CAN DISPLAY ON THIS REMOTE IS WHAT CHANNEL YOU JUST SENT IT AT LAST AND THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION
THERE'S THE SCROLL WHEEL IN OR OUT
WELL I DUNNO ABOUT LIKE THE FLIP PHONE IDEA BECAUSE I THINK AS FAR AS DURABILITY TH IT'S NOT A BIG WELL MAYBE WHEN IT'S CLOSED
UM WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH A LIKE A MEDIUM CHIP S I WOULD IMAGINE
BUT WE I WE WILL NEED A RECEIVER AN ANTENNA
IN OR OUT
FOR ME I THINK THE SCROLL WHEEL ACTUALLY MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD
I IT MIGHT PUSH SOMEBODY OVER THE EDGE WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT OUR AT OUR REMOTE VERSUS SOMETHING ELSE
WHEN THEY SEE THIS ONE HAS A SCROLL WHEEL TO GO UP AND DOWN ON THE CHANNELS
I THINK IT MIGHT BE KINDA NEAT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT LIKE THAT
WELL I THINK WH WHAT IT WOULD BE IS LIKE LIKE THE M LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S MAYBE YOU KNOW A DIGITAL
IT HAS THE SAME EXACT FUNCTIONALITY AS TWO BUTTONS
IS A LOT OF T. V. S WON'T RE THE T. V. S WON'T RESPOND EXACTLY THE SAME
I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU MIGHT BE GETTING AT OR OR
WELL YOU JUST IT'S ONE EXTRA BUTTON
SO PROGRAMME START ZERO ONE ENTER ZERO FIVE ENTER THIRTY EIGHT ENTER PROGRAMME END
OH WELL WE ALSO HAVE TO DETERMINE IN SOME MANNER HOW TO SWITCH BETWEEN MODES BETWEEN GOING THROUGH YOUR FAVOURITES LIST AND JUST HITTING UP ONE UP TWO
TO WHICH AN L. E. AN L. E. D. OKAY
LET'S LET'S TRY AND THINK NOW HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR WITH ALL THESE FEATURES HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY IF YOU WENT TO THE STORE
UH K EXCITING IDEAS
WE'VE ALL BROKE A REMOTE CONTROL RI UM S YEAH
YOU PRESS THIS AND IT DOES TH
WOOD WOOD WOULD GE WOULD GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A MARKETING NICHE WOULDN'T IT
DO YOU GET A GOOD GRIP ON THE RUBBER
D DO WE HAVE ACTUALLY ANY CONCEPT OF WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN A SIMPLE CHIP AND AN ADVANCED CHIP
TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OR INTERFACE CONCEPT
MAN YEAH
UH OKAY
SO ON TO
THE THEN WE HAVE THAT AS WELL BUT WI WITH A SIMILAR
SO OUR BIG QUESTIONS HERE REALLY ARE
OH BUT THAT WAS IN YOUR PRESENTATION SO WH WHAT WOULD YOU IMAGINE IT DOING
WHAT I UNDERSTAND ABOUT SCROLL WHEELS IS THEY'RE THEY'RE QUITE EXPENSIVE TO TO MAKE
WELL I D I LIKE THE IDEA OF BASICALLY FOCUSING THE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS FOCUSING THE P THE PRODUCT ON THE IDEA OF THE UH THE CASE THE THE UH
DOCK TO PUT IT IN TO TO CHARGE IT
IT S I M MAKES IT EASY TO MARKET IT'S EASY TO DIFFERENTIATE THE PRODUCT YEAH SO
AND IF WE WE KEEP THE REST IN A FORMAT THAT IS DURABLE BECAUSE TH TH THE WHOLE PRODUCT'S GONNA NEED TO BE MORE DURABLE TH THUS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE DITCHING IT AS OFTEN
SO OUR BIG DECISION THEN IS LIKE HOW DO WE DO UM LIKE WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE DETAILS AND WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WELL N NOT EXACTLY THE DETAILS
BUT D DO WE HAVE UH
JUST A VERY THIN SORTA SHEET FOR A A GRIP SORTA THING OR FOR
OKAY SO THE QUESTION IS NOW I GUESS WE NEED T TO
YEAH AND I GUESS TH TH THE QUESTION TH TH THAT YOU'RE BEING ASKED RIGHT NOW IS WHETHER IS THE DOCK ENOUGH OF A UNIQUE FEATURE TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND SELL THAT A A AS A A VERY DIFFERENT PRODUCT
BECAUSE THE SCROLL WHEEL COMES AT QUITE A COST
THAT'S GONNA N IS THAT GONNA NEED A BETTER CHIP AS WELL
AND IT'S PRESUMABLY GONNA NEED A LITTLE SPEAKER IN IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS WELL TO BEEP
MM PR MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS OUT
AND I DON'T S THINK IT'S OBVIOUS AND NATURAL HOW IT WOULD BE USED
BUT THEN THAT THAT SURELY D DEPENDS A LITTLE ON THE T. V. BECAUSE SOME T. V. S ARE QUITE SLOW AT CHANGING CHANNELS FROM LIKE SO IF YOU'VE GOT A SCROLL WHEEL AND YOU S YOU HAVE TO SCROLL SCROLL IT REALLY REALLY SLOWLY JUST SO THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY KEEPING IN PACE WITH THE T. V. 'S ABILITY TO TO CHANGE CHANNELS
YOU SCROLL IT A BUNCH OF TIMES AND YOU WAIT FOR IT TO
AH I SEE I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW
YOU COULD BASICALLY MAKE IT SO THAT IT'LL I MEAN IT'S JUST GONNA BE SENDING A SIGNAL TO THE T. V. YEAH THE T. V. 'S GE SO IF YOU SEND ABOUT FIVE FLIP CHANNELS
AND IF WE'RE MARKETING IT AS A HIGH NICHE PRODUCT THEN WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING GOOD T. V. S AS WELL YEAH PRESUMABLY
OH I SEE SO IF MAYBE IF WE HAD AN L. C. D. UP THE TOP THAT JUST DID A NUMBER ON IT RIGHT
YOU'D NEED A DISPLAY ON THE TH THE THING
OKAY AND YEAH AND THAT JUST BASICALLY FLIPS BETWEEN IT AND IT'LL GO IT SENDS OUT ZERO
YOU COULD BASICALLY COME UP WITH A PARTNERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THAT QUITE CHEAPLY
MIGHT BE BUT THA THAT'S NOT GONNA BE SUCH A COSTLY FEATURE
MAKING IT LAST
IS THAT OKAY WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES
SO RIGHT DETAILS TH THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE ARE THAT WE WANT A SCROLL WHEEL
WE WANT BACK LIT BUTTONS
SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE SURE AS TO WHAT WE CAN PUSH THE COST UP TO
THOUGH WE HAVEN'T GOT TO A STAGE WHERE WE'RE READY TO PIN DOWN THE PRICE OF COMPONENTS
YEAH NO I I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY SHOULD BE MORE FLEXIBLE THAN ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE AS WE SAID IN THE LAST MEETING
OUR MANAGEMENT IS REALLY LOOKING FOR US TO PUSH OUR BRAND
WE'RE ENTERING A NEW MARKET HERE SO I THINK THE THE PROFIT EXPECTATION FOR THIS ONE PRODUCT IS MAYBE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS BEING ABLE TO
BUT TH WHAT'S OUR BALLPARK AS TO WHAT WE'D BE ABLE TO SELL SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR
ON THE OTHER HAND I WOULD THINK
IF I HAD A COOL NEW T. V. AND THIS WAS R LOOKING REALLY SLICK AND IT HAD THE DOCK AND IT HAD THE SCROLL WHEEL
I DO I DON'T THINK I'D GO OVER A HUNDRED EURO CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE WAY TOO MUCH
BUT THE I WOULD BE HAPPY PAYING OVER FORTY FOR IT I GUESS BUT NOT MUCH
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WE CA WE MAKE IT FOR
IT STARTS AT THREE TWENTY ONE THE NEXT MEETING
THE THE NE NEXT MEETING IS THREE TWENTY ONE YEAH
OKAY ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO WHAT THIS THING'S GONNA DO LOOK LIKE
OKAY CAN HE GET IT ALL BY HIMSELF THIS TIME
JOSE HE MAN IS
N NAME
I JUST LOVE YOU TECH GUYS HUH
YEAH Y DO JABBER
P
AND THAT'S ON THE CAMERA
UH
UH UH TO ME IN A MARKETING SENSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT RELATIVE
AND IF YOU MAKE IT FROM THAT SUPER RUBBER WHEN YOU DROP IT ON THE FLOOR IT CAN BOUNCE RIGHT BACK UP IN YOUR HAND
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SEE ALSO
OOH
SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BEEN SO LONG
WHEN I S WHEN I SEE THE WHEN I SEE THE PRODUCT I I I I DON'T WANNA BUY IT
AND UH FROM FROM TALKING TO MIKE IS THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE UH WE CAN MARKET A MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCT NOW
AND AND SO YEAH I'M A I'M A LITTLE BIT STUCK RIGHT NOW IN THAT WHAT UH W WHAT IS IT THAT I'M GONNA MARKET
UH WELL I DON'T YEAH IT'S I I JUST SEE IT AS DIFFERENT
UH I SAY THAT IT'S DIFFERENT I WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR AS MARKETING IS M GIVE ME SOMETHING DIFFERENT
I GIVE ME A LOWER PRICE GIVE ME A HIGHER PRICE GIVE ME SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY
DON'T GIVE ME THE SAME THING THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS PUTTING OUT THERE ON THE SHELF IT'S F AT THE SAME PRICE
WE'RE WE'RE A NEW FIRM
THA THAT I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH
IF IT CREATES SOMETHING MORE COMPLEX OR MORE EXPENSIVE THEN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAKES IT UH A MARKETING NECESSITY
BUT AGAIN FROM A MARKETING PERSPECTIVE I WANT AS MUCH NEW AND DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS THING AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE CO IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET
SO YOU KNOW UNLESS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AND INFORMATION STARTS COMING OUT OF THE A CABLE BOX OR SOMETHING THERE'S NO S I DON'T SEE THE
I DON'T SEE THE NECESSITY OF AN L. C. D. EITHER
DON'T SEE IT
WELL I THINK IT'S IT'S THE MORE UNIQUENESS YOU CAN BRING TO THE PRODUCT THE EASIER IT IS I BELIEVE FOR ME TO MARKET
UH AGAIN THE PUSH BUTTONS I I SEE ARE ARE EVERYWHERE
AND SO WE CAN GO WITH THE SAME THING BUT WE'RE GONNA BE COM COMPETING IN A IN A BROADER MARKET THAN IF WE GO WITH SOMETHING UNIQUE
I MEAN WHAT I SEE ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU BROUGHT UP IN AN EARLIER PRESENTATION IS
AND WHAT I KEEP THROWING OUT THERE I JUST KEEP THROWING OUT IDEAS TO TRY TO MAKE THIS THING LOOK OR ACT OR IN SOME WAY IDENTIFY ITSELF AS UNIQUE OR DIFFERENT
I THINK THOSE ARE TWO VERY STRONG FEATURES IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED WITHOUT A BUNCH OF EXTRA COST
OR MAYBE YOU CAN LIKE HAVE A A SMELL O RAMA YOU KNOW YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND IT S PUTS OUT A STINK
INSTEAD OF GOING BUTTON TO BU YOU JUST J YOU'D J J J J J J
WELL THERE'S ANO
NOW THE THE ONLY THING I I ON THE INTERFACE SIDE OF IT IS THAT I I I SEE THE DILEMMA
SO I CAN GO UH PRESUMING I HAVE ON MY TELEVISION
SOMETHING THAT TELLS ME WHAT CHANNEL I'M ON I CAN SCROLL DIRECT FROM CHANNEL FIVE TO CHANNEL THIRTY TWO
I KNOW WHAT BECAUSE IT'S ON THE TELEVISION
THE TELEVISION TELLS ME WHAT CHANNEL IT'S ON WHEN I CHANGE IT
SO CA CAN WE CAN WE CREATE THAT KIND OF INTERFACE WITHIN A SCROLL SYSTEM
WE HAVE ABOUT THREE WE HAVE THREE OR FOUR THINGS HERE
I DUNNO AND AN MAYBE WE MAYBE EVEN HAVE THIS AS IN HOUSE TECHNOLOGY
OR WE GO DIRECTIONAL UP WE GO WE GO THIS WE GO THIS WE GO THIS WAY FOR ONE WE GO THIS WAY FOR THE OTHER
AH HA OKAY
OKAY TO CREATE THIS PRODUCT WE SEE IT'S GONNA COST US THIS MUCH FOR THIS VOLUME
I GUESS WHAT I JUST WANT TO ME THE NEXT STEP IS FOR THESE GUYS TO COME COME IN WITH THE DESIGN PROPOSAL W WITH THE COST ESTIMATE ATTACHED
AND THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT LEVEL
BECAUSE ONE OF TH ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE MARKETING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS THAT THIS IS THE LAST ONE YOU WILL EVER NEED TO BUY FOR YOUR TELEVISION
'CAUSE WE HAVE ABOUT SIX SIX SEVEN FEATURES IN THAT ALONE
IS MY THREE TWENTY ONE IS THE NEXT MEETING
OH WE ALL LEAVE
THINK S
PRO
PREPARE TO DIE
OH INTERFACE CONCEPT
THAT KINDA WOULD R D YEAH
YEAH SO UM TAKING THAT AWAY
OUR UH THE THE THE RUBBER BUT RUBBER BUTTONS ARE THE MORE RELIABLE IT'S THE THE ONES THAT WOULD AL WOULD ALLOW US TO TO MARKET OUR PRODUCT AS BEING YOU KNOW LESS PRONE TO DAMAGE AND MORE RESISTANT TO THINGS LIKE SPILLAGE OF LIQUIDS OVER IT OR YOU KNOW MISTREAT MISUSES
AS IT HAPPENS TO REMOTE CONTROLS
UM AS FOR THE
WELL WE WANNA SMALL R REMOTE CONTROL ONE SIDE BECAUSE UH WE WANT IT TO BE COOL AND UH DESIGNED
BUT UM YEAH I THINK WE WE NEED TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN THOSE TWO AND SOMEHOW WE'LL DO THAT
UM SO THE THE WHAT I WOULD PROPOSE IS SOMETHING MORE OR LESS IN THE UH DIRECTION OF WHAT IS TO YO THE RIGHT OF THAT SLIDE UH BUT WITHOUT WITH A L A LESS COMPLICATED UM DESIGN
UH THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL CAN JUST BECOME THOSE THE THE FOUR BUTTON ARRAY AS IN IF IT WAS A ROUND DIAL
AND UM IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT AS THE ONE TO THE RIGHT BUT WITH THE NUMBERS AND THE FOUR BUTTONS PLUS MAYBE A CENTRE ONE WITH TELETEXT
YE NO IT'S NOT I I IT'S JUST FOUR BUTTONS THAT ARE ON A CROSS
SO THAT YOU BA BASICALLY CAN CONTROL ALL OF THE IMPORTANT TASKS FROM THAT ALONE
YEAH UM YEAH SO I THINK WE W WE GO FOR SOMETHING MID SIZED SO SOMETHING LOOKS GOOD AND UH IS NOT TOO PRONE TO GET LOST
THAT BE IT
I'LL BET FIRST IN VOLUME MAYBE
S
YES I AM
PUT ON YOUR MIC
THREE THREE
PEDRO CAN HAVE IT
SO HERE I'LL GIVE YOU THE SO THIS IS THE CRADLE UNIT AND THIS IS THE ACTUAL REMOTE ITSELF
UM SO THE SCROLL BAR IS OR THE SCROLL WHEEL IS THIS THIS GREEN LITTLE SCROLLY GUY HERE UM AND THEN THE VOLUME CONTROLS ARE HERE AND HERE
UH YOU'VE GOT THE KEYPAD WHICH IS THE NUMBERS UH F FROM ZERO TO NINE AND THEN TEN
SO THIS BL THIS BUTTON WILL BE USED BOTH FOR THE FAVOURITES AND FOR PROGRAMMING YOUR UH THE UM THE TYPE OF TELEVISION YOU WANNA USE
SO UM THE PLASTIC IS THE WHITE AREA OF THIS OF THE MODEL HERE AND THE RED AREA IS LIKE A RUBBER COVERING
A MI UH POSSIBLE PROBLEM BUT IF YOU DROP IT YEAH
YEAH THE THE POWER BUTTON IS A BIT OF A REACH BUT I THINK WE MIGHT SCALE DOWN THE FINAL MODEL A BIT
THESE THIS IS A BIT LARGER THAN IT WOULD BE BUT
EXACTLY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THOSE ARE FOR
AND UM THERE'S ONE OTHER FEATURE THAT WE WERE DEBATING BUT WE DECIDED TO GO AGAINST IT
IS UM YOU COULD BEEP BEEP BEEP WE WERE THINKING THAT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO HAVE A TRIGGER BUTTON HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS FINGER IT IT'S IT KINDA FEELS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING THERE
AND WE WE DON'T WANNA ACCIDENTALLY BE HITTING THE POWER BUTTON LIKE THAT SO
SO MAYBE IN A FINAL DESIGN PHASE WE MIGHT TWEAK THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT
OH NO THIS IS JUST WHAT WE HAD TO WORK WITH AT THE TIME
WE ONLY NEED THE UH THE REGULAR CHIP ON PRINT SO THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A M MISCALCULATION IN THERE
AND WE AND WE HAVE A SINGLE CURVED UH
SEE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN F SINGLE CURVED
SO YEAH IT'S FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT THAT'S WHERE WE CAME UP WITH IT
AH
OH IT'S A THAT'S NOT VERY SPECIAL IT'S PRETTY
IF TH
UH NO WE JUST USE IT AS A SCROLL
S 'S KIND OF S FRIGHTENINGLY ACCURATE
AND THE R UH REMOTE CALL FEATURE
UH 'KAY
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA GIVE US A PRESENTATION OF OUR WONDER PRODUCT THAT I CAN SEE SOME DEMONSTRATIONS OF OVER THERE
THEN WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT FINANCE AND I'VE GOT A LOVELY EXCEL SPREADSHEET THAT I KNOCKED UP IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES FOR THIS
GOT FORTY MINUTES TO DO THIS IN
THING IS IN WHERE IS IT
IS IT IN
WHO WANTS IT
ZAPPING YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS EH
I LIKE THE THE THE THE LOGO ON THERE AS WELL
AH OKAY I SEE
IS THAT COULD THAT BE EASY TO FOR THE SCROLL WHEEL TO BE ROTATED IF IT LANDS ON IT
OH WELL I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON THE STIFFNESS A LITTLE OF IT
I TAKE IT THAT THIS IS GONNA BE SLIGHTLY LIGHTER IN THE FINAL DESIGN AS WELL
AH YEAH THAT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE
SO THE THE TWO BLUE ARE ARE THOSE FOR THE THE IT TO CHARGE OFF OF IN
AH OKAY OKAY
SO IS THAT THE THE FINAL COLOUR SCHEME AS WELL OR
IT CAME OFF
CAN I NOT GET YOUR GET AT STUFF FROM YOUR SHARED FOLDER NOW
OH I SEE I SEE
DO YOU WOULD YOU A ARGUE THAT THAT WE'RE BETTER GOING FOR THE HIGHER COST THAN BRINGING IT DOWN INTO TWENTY F FIVE AS WE PROBABLY COULD
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY QUITE OPEN TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE PRODUCT FOR A LATER VERSION WITH THOSE FEATURES QUITE SIMPLY ANYWAY AREN'T WE
EQUIVALENT TO SOLAR CELLS WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLY FAIR CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE IN HOUSE MANUFACTURING OF POWER ADAPTORS ALREADY
CAN BE MADE FOR IT SOUNDED DIFFERENT THAT TIME UH CAN BE MADE FOR A SIMILAR PRICE TO UH AN L. C. DISPLAY UH AN UH
UH DO YOU THINK THAT'S FAIR COMING FROM A M THE MANUFACTURING
IS THAT A SINGLE CURVED RATHER THAN A DOUBLE CURVED
BUT WE SAVE ONE EURO THAT WAY YEAH
DO DON'T SPEAK SO IT'S IN HERE IN THAT W DO WE HAVE ANY WE HAVE SPECIAL FORM DON'T WE
PUSH BUTTON SCROLL WHEEL WE'RE BASICALLY WE HAVE UH TH IS THIS INTENDED TO BE A BUTTON AS WELL OR JUST A SCROLL
WE'RE ON TO THE
WE'RE ON TO THE PAT ON THE BACK PART OF THE
PRESENTATION WHERE WE HAVE A LOOK AT THE CRITERIAS TH THAT PAUL THE CRITERION CRITERIA THAT PAUL HAS HAS GIVEN US AND WE CAN USE THAT TO TELL
I THINK WE DID PRETTY WELL TOO
OKAY SO TH TH WHAT ABOUT UM ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
IS IT THE
NOT EVERY IDEA NECESSARILY IT'S STILL A REMOTE CONTROL
UH NO YEAH BUT WE DID WE DID BREAK WITH THE SPECS A LITTLE BIT I GUESS BUT THE UH
TEAMWORK YEAH HE IS UH
WHAT DID WE THINK OF THE MEETING ROOM I GUESS IS AN IMPORTANT THING HERE
I'VE BEEN WOR I'VE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THAT ALL DAY BUT SEE THESE LOOK LIKE THEY'RE THAT LOOKS THE OTH THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE THAT WAY AROUND
UH OKAY SO THAT DATA MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY INVALID
YEAH WE CAME UP WITH QUITE A BIT
ARE THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET
IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED
OH I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GOT THERE
THANK
YEAH I'VE GOT A LOT OF PAPERWORK TO CATCH UP ON TOO
BRA
MM THAT'S OH THAT'S OH I LIKE IT
I'M HA
SO YOU CAN TAKE THIS HO TAKE THIS HOME WITH YOU TONIGHT AND YOU CAN PUSH THAT AND HE'LL BE ACROSS TOWN
MY MY S MY SUGGESTION IS WE'RE GONNA GO GO TO THE SILVERS AND BLACKS LIKE MOST OF THE TELEVISIONS
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND MY UH MY FOLDER UP THERE I GOTTA DO MINE UP AT THE BOARD
NO IT'S NOT IN THERE BECAUSE I HAD THE COMPUTER PROBLEM AND I I I COU I COULDN'T CREATE IT
IS THIS ONE OF THE TESTS IS TO SEE HOW WE CAN ADAPT TO S CHANGING SITUATIONS IN THE IN THE MEETING ROOM
SO WHAT WE HAD IS WE HAD THE METHOD
NO A.
SO THIS DOESN'T GO SO FAST THIS WAY
AND UH TO ME WITH THIS PRODUCT WE GOT UH WE GOT BASICALLY THREE THINGS TO MARKET
SO THE FEATURES I THINK WE GOT THE SCROLL WE'VE GOT THE UH THE LOCATOR WE'VE GOT THE DURABILITY
WE'RE WANTING YOU TO UH FIND OUR PRODUCT SO WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU A GOOD PRODUCT AT A FAIR PRICE
ONE THING I WOULD WANT TO TO SEE IS UH IS CAN WE CAN WE GET A LIFETIME UH GUARANTEE ON THIS PRODUCT
A NORMAL USE GUARANTEE WHICH MEANS THAT THIS PRODUCT FOR THE FOR THE LIFE OF OF THE LIFE USE
IF IT SHOULD HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM THAT WE COULD RE REPLACE IT AT NO COST
I BELIEVE TO MAKE IT MARKETABLE I BELIEVE AT A COST OF OF OF THIRTY THIRTY FIVE TO TO FIFTY EUROS
UM W
THAT THAT WOULD BE UH THAT WOULD BE I THINK A DECISION BEST MADE BY CORPORATE UM I I M FOR MY EVALUATION BASED ON WHAT OUR COMPETITION IS
BUT I'M SH I'M SURE OPEN TO TO MARKET THIS IN EITHER DIRECTION
BUT YOU GUYS CAME UP WITH A GREAT PRODUCT AND AT THAT COST I THINK IT UH THERE'S NOBODY ELSE THAT'S PUTTING THIS THIS COMBINATION OF OF INGREDIENTS TOGETHER
THE ONLY LIMITATIONS I SEE TO THIS IS THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON TELEVISION ONLY
UH THAT'S THE ONLY THAT'S THE ONLY DRAWBACK I SEE TO THIS
BUT WITH ALL OF THESE OTHER FEATURES I THINK PEOPLE C ONE THING I'M I'M HOPING FOR IS PEOPLE ARE NOT GONNA EVEN NOTICE
THERE'S GONNA BE SOMEBODY GOING HOME AND SAY OH SH THIS THING DOESN'T WORK FOR MY D. V. D. AND MY BUT I LIKE THESE OTHER THINGS
WELL ONE OF ONE OF THE THOUGHTS THAT I HAD IS CAN CAN THIS UNIT BE BE PRODUCED IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT UPGRADABLE
YOU KNOW UH LIKE LIKE A UM A SIM CARD IN A IN A UM IN A TELEPHONE
YOU KNOW IS THERE A CARD IN TH CAN WE MAKE A CARD AND SO AFTER
MM-HMM BUT YOU FOLLOW WHAT I'M S I'M S
UH TO ME THE ONLY ADDITIONS
OOH
YEAH WELL WE WE WE KINDA BROKE WE KINDA AT LEAST ADJUSTED EVERY EVERY CRITERIA THEY GAVE US BECAUSE WE D WE STILL HAVE THE THE TELETEXT CAPABILITY IN THIS THING RIGHT
SO YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IF THIS THING FLIES THEN WE'VE WE'VE ADJUSTED OR BROKEN EVERY EVERY IDEA THEY GAVE US
BUT I LIKE I MEAN WHEN I SAY WE HAVE WE HAD I BELIEVE WE HAVE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 'CAUSE W THIS IS WE DID IT
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE ON THE RECORDING IN THERE FROM THAT MICROPHONE IS YOUR LUNCH DIGESTING YOU KNOW TH
NEW IDEAS F UH FOR THE PRODUCT OR FOR THE THE THE THE ENVIRONMENT OR WHAT ARE WE TA
WELL I I MEAN CLEARLY REMOTE CONTROL MICROPHONES WOULD BE THE WOULD BE A NICE SOLUTION TO ALL THESE CABLES
BUT I'M SURE THAT THERE'S THERE'S SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE THINGS THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
AND OF COURSE I DID NOT HAVE SO MUCH FUN WITH MY COMPUTER THIS AFTERNOON
S I'VE GOT A LOT OF PAPERWORK TO CATCH UP ON SO LET'S CLOSE THIS AND COME BACK AND 'KAY
THI THIRD THIRD THIRD
PRODUCTION COSTS ESTIMATED BY OUR MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT AND UM THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT WHICH IS US IS UH FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT EUROS
SOMEONE FORGOT THE UNITS THERE YEAH UH UNIT PRICE UNIT PRODUCTION PRICE COST THING
AND UH WE IMPLEMENTED THE F THE THE WAY OF PUTTING THE NEW AND REVOLUTIONARY ZAPPING YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS FUNCTIONALITY IN THE SCROLL
START S THE THE START UH TO TO TO PROGRAMME YEAH
DON'T HAVE NO ONE TO HANDLE THAT
SO YOU HA YOU HAVE LIKE THE THE BASE STATION WITH UM THE LITTLE BUTTON FOR THE WHERE'S MY REMOTE
W WE NEED WE NEED WE NEED S SOME MORE BUTTONS IF IT WOULD TO WORK ON SOME OTHER STUFF BUT
WE WE W YEAH WE COULD GET ANOTHER VERSION OF IT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS
D YOU MUST HAVE VERY LONG SHIRTS
THAT'S WAY FAR DOWN LAPEL MIC
USE THEM LIKE THAT
MM N NO
EH UM
SO I'LL PRESENT MYSELF I'M ADA LONGMUND AND AS YOU MAY KNOW IT I'M THE PR PROJECT MANAGER
UM SPEAK ABOUT M THE PROJECT
OUR PROJECT PROJECT IS TO CREATE UM A NEW REMOTE CONTROL AND AS YOU MAY KNOW THERE'S LOT OF INDUSTRIALS INTERESTING IN CREATING A REMOTE CONTROL
UH
THE TOOL TRAINING IS TO TRY OUT THE WHITE BOARD SO
AN INTERNATIONAL REMOTE CONTROL AS WE WANT TO SELL IT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD AND THE PRODUCT COSTS WILL BE NOT MORE THAN TWELVE EUROS AND FIFTY CENTIMES
SO AS YOU WILL DISCUSS ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU WILL HAVE TO EXPERIENCE YOUR UM WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND UH YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK ON THE DESIGN AND ALSO TO WORK ON THE DESIGN OF TH TECHNICAL FUN FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THINK OF THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO SOMETHING REALLY SPECIFIC AS EVERYBODY EVERYBODY WILL HAVE TO USE IT IT'S SOR THE SAME AS KEYBOARDS
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE QWERTY AZERTY FRENCH AND U. K. KEYBOARD SO REALLY THE REMOTE CONTROL TO BE INTERNATIONAL
AS WE WANT TO MAXIMISE THE BENEFIT
SO IS IT OKAY
YOU LOVE THE EYES
YEAH THAT WAS THE EYES
YOU FORGOT THE CHIPS
OF
AH OKAY
MAYBE SOMEONE HA WE HAVE TO THIS WHITEBOARD YEAH
I IT'S IT'S REASONABLE S QUITE YEAH
IS
I. D. IS FOR THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN YEAH
AMI YEAH PROJECT
I I THINK THE USER THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN IS HE WILL DESIGN HOW THE USER WILL YOU KNOW THE RELATION BETWEEN THE USER AND YOU KNOW THE REMOTE CONTROL SO
BUT I WAS THINKING THAT HE'S A USER 'CAUSE THE USER INTERFACE TO DESIGN FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE BUT BUTTON WILL BE YOU KNOW
THERE WAS A STEP ABOUT DRAWING SOMETHING IN THE IN THE BOARD I DON'T KNOW
IS IT
OH RIGHT IT'S IT'S FROM THE LEFT TO THE RI IT'S
I D I WAS THINKING BUT I N I'M NOT SURE NOW
I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD DO IT SO
WHAT ARE YOU I DON NO IDEA SO
AH IT'S MY TURN
IT'S OK SO WHAT CAN I DRAW SOME MORE
YEAH IT'S IT'S A SE IT'S MY PRIORITY THIS ONE
THOSE THINGS JUST REFER TO EACH OF EACH OF US I THINK
AMI AND OKAY
OKAY AND MARKETING EXPERT IT'S ME
YOU CAN MANAGE ALL THIS YEAH
AH YOU HAVE TO KNOW IT
I'M JUST GO I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU SOME TRENDS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AND WHAT THE USERS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AND THEN THI THIS WOULD I GUESS CONVERGED TO THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER WI AND THEN INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT UNDER TWELVE EUROS AND F FIFTY SO
OH YEAH DOESN'T LOOK SO FINE
OH WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE MINUTES FOR THE MEETING
YOU YOU DE YOU IMPLEMENT THE CORE FUNCTIONS IN THE
USE IT
I DESIGN THE USER F USER INTERFACE YOU DESIGN THE FUNCTION
AH YEAH
OH MAYBE WE SHOULD BRING KEMY HERE
THE ONLY THING I CAN DRAW IS LIKE THIS
SO LET'S START OUR SECOND ME MEETING ON CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
AS THE PREVIOUS MEETING I WILL BE THE SECRETARY AND WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS AND WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPT AND FINALLY WE'LL CLOSE THE DECISION
I'M NOT SURE THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS VERY ATTRACTIVE
WE'LL HAVE BIG DISCUSSION I SUPPOSE AFTER THAT SO
BUT AS THE UM EXPERT TOLD US MOST OF THE PEOPLE WANT TO USE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO ZAP T TO ZAP BETWEEN CHANNELS
YEAH BUT SUPPOSE YOU GOT A COLD
EVERYBODY WANTING TO CHANGE CHANNEL IN THE SAME TIME
SO THEY SAY OH CHANNEL FOUR CHANNEL THREE CHANNEL FOUR CHANNEL THREE ALL THE TIME SO
YEAH BUT ONE OTHER QUESTION
SO YOU THINK IT WON'T COST AN
YEAH BUT THERE IS ONE PROBLEM THAT UH BABA TALKED ABOUT IS THE INTERNATIONAL
AND WITH NO INCREASE IN THE PRI PRODUCTION PRICE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH BUT HOW WILL YOU
BUT HERE YOU SAY YOU WANT TO USE I UH S TECHNOLOGY
YEAH BUT WHA WHAT IS THE USE OF VOICE OR GESTURE RECOGNITION IF YOU HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL LI LIKE THIS IF YOU HAVE AN OBJECT
IF YOU WANT TO USE VOICE OR GESTURE YOU NEED TO BE FREE WITHOUT ANY OBJECT
OKAY YOU SO YOU CAN BUILD A KIND OF BLACK BOX AND PUT IT ON T. V. AND JUST TO RECOGNIZE GESTURES AND VOICE
AH
WHICH KIND OF CONTROLLER WOULD YOU PREFER TO USE YOU AS A REMOTE CONTROL USER
YEAH BUT W WE WE WANT SOMETHING TH THAT WORKS ALL THE TIME EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR FOR EVERYONE
NOT TOO EXPENSIVE TOO
MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE A DECISION AFTER THAT SO
UH
YOU WILL HAD S SOME MORE INFORMATION IN I THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING AFTER YOUR PRESENTATION TO HAVE UM BABA'S PRESENTATION
I THINK IT'S AN ADDED VALUE TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AND MAYBE IT CAN ATTRACT ALL THE ECOLOGICAL K YEAH CONSUMERS AND BUT ABOUT THE THE PRICE OF ADDING THIS SOLAR BATTERY
WOULD IT BE SOMETHING REALLY THAT WILL INCREASE THE PRICE OF PRODUCTION MORE NO
AND WHAT THA WHAT ABOUT THE UH
SO AS YOU SAY YOU WANT SOMETHING TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE MAYBE USING SOLAR ENERGY AND WITH BATTERY WOULD BE SOMETHING INTERESTING MAYBE WILL ATTRACT
UH CHEAP IMPRINT SO YOU S YOU PROPOSE LOW LEVEL CHIPS WOULD BE UH ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING WORKING WELL
TH THE FEELING IS NATURAL SO MAYBE WE CAN STAY WITH WOOD
JUST IN ONE AND DO A REMOTE CONTROL WITH SOLAR ENERGY AND BATTERIES AND WITH LEV LOW LEVEL CHIPS AND WOOD
WITH A MODULE
COMMANDS WORDS AND USE THEM WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO USE YOUR FINGERS
TURNING THE T. V. O ON O OR OFF
SO THE NEXT MEETING WILL START IN THIRTY MEETI MINUTES SO WE'LL YOU WILL ALL HAVE TO WORK IN
ON THE UM SPONGY WAY TO TO ADD SPONGY UM TOUCH TO THE BUTTONS AND TRY TO FIND MAYBE A NICE SHAPE FOR THE WOODEN REMOTE CONTROL
AND I SUP I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO EVALUATE TH THE PRODUCT TOO
AND REMEMBER AS AS I SAID LAST MEETING
SO NO MORE QUESTIONS WE CAN CLOSE THE SESSION
OH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD POINT SO
AND MAYB MAYBE WE CAN HAVE THE SWITCHING MODE TO PASS FROM YOU KNOW VOICE CONTROLLER TO
'CAUSE IT IT HAVE TO BE UNIVERSAL SO
YEAH BUT THE PROBLEM IS HOW TO S YOU KNOW IF THIS IS A PUSH BUTTON CONTROLLER
YOU CAN SEND THIS CON THIS REMOTE CONTROL EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD THE SAME ONE
YEAH BUT FOR EACH COUNTRY YOU HAVE TO DO ONE BECAUSE UH THE FOR EXAMPLE FOR SE
TO TALK TO THE TO THE T. V. MAYBE
I IF YOU SAY ONE HE SWITCH TO CHANNEL YEAH
SO WELL FOR EXAMPLE IF IT IS SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM IF I MAYBE IF IT IS IN THE TABLE THERE YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY S CHANNEL ONE AND THE T THE REMOTE CONTROL GIVES THE ORDER TO THE T. V. TO SWITCH TO CHANNEL ONE
DEVIC
YEAH BUT SO YOU NEED A CAMERA AND YOU KNOW A MICROPHONE INSIDE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW SWITCHING FROM ONE COUNTRY TO TO ANOTHER WILL BE A PROBLEM SO ALTHOUGH Y Y
UH
I THINK HE NEED A CONTROL THAT IS VERY RELIABLE SO
IT'S NOT REALLY THE WE WE CAN ADD FOR EXAMPLE SOME FUNCTION LIKE FOR BROWSING IN INTERNET SO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT UH I THINK A USER NEED
BECAUSE THE P THE PROBLEM I CAN SEE WITH WITH THE VOICE OR THE GESTURE ITSELF WH WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN A FAMILY I I FOR EXAMPLE IF
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEW
YE
IT'S UH OTH THE OTH SO I IT'S THE WORKING DESIGN
SO THIS YEAH SO THIS IS THE DESCRIBED USE WHAT
ARE YOU INST
I CAN SAY IT TO YOU WITHOUT
I S BECAUSE I IN MY PRESENTATION I DON'T HAVE HERE WITH SO IT WAS IN FACT THE DESIGN USE TO SHOW YOU THE DESIGN OF WHAT IS INSIDE A WHAT IS INSIDE AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT COMPONENT OF THE R
SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING SO I COULD SHOW YOU SOME SOME PICTURE OF WHAT IS INSIDE AND SO
SO I IN FACT THE THE F SOMETHING I WANT TO DISCUSS IS WHICH KIND OF MATERIAL ARE WE GOING TO USE
SO WILL IT WILL BE WOODEN WOODEN DI WOODEN REMOTE CONTROL OR A A PLASTIC REMOTE CONTROL LIKE THIS ONE
SO AND IN WHICH WHICH WHICH KIND WILL BE THE THE DIFFERENT BU BUTTON SO IT CAN BE SOME YOU KNOW
THE BUTTON THE BUTTONS ARE UNLIGHTED DURING THE NIGHT OR YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE THEM IN THE DARKNESS
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO DISCUSS ALSO IS WHICH KIND OF ALIMENTATION ELECTRIC ALIMENTATION DO YOU WANT TO HAVE
SO WILL IT BE FOR EXAMPLE UH D UH SOLAR ENERGY ALIMENTATION OR WILL IT BE A BATTERY LIKE THE CLASSICAL BATTERY SO
UH BOTH OF THEM SO SO FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME COUNTRY WHERE YOU ARE IN THE THE COUNTRYSIDE AND YOU ARE FAR FROM YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU WANT TO HAVE RECHARGER OR REMOTE CONTROL POWER YOU JUST PUT IT ON THE SUN AND AFTER ONE HOUR YOU CAN COME AND SO IT CAN BE INTERESTING FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS KIND OF REMOTE CON IT CAN BE SOMETHING INTERESTING TO MAKE PEOPLE BUY IT
IN FACT HAVING THEM BOTH WILL IF WE WANT TO HAVE BATTERY
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WOODEN WILL BE LIKE I DON'T KNOW HIGH CL SO A SPECIAL HIGH CLASS OR YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE SOME
AND SO THE LAST POINT IS Y ALSO WOULD DO YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME VERY CHEAP
INTEGRATED CIR CIRCUITS CHIPS OR DO YOU HAVE LOW LEVEL OR OR VERY VERY EXPENSIVE
YEAH I THINK IT WILL FIT ON THE PRICE WE WANT TWEL TWELVE EUROS SO
IT'S FASHION AND IT'S RELATED TO HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS OR UH IF YOU WANT TO WATCH T. V. IN THE DARKNESS OR IF YOU WANT TO LO FIND YOUR FIND YOUR YOUR REMOTE CONTROL THAT IS LOST
YOU KNOW IN THE DARKNESS IT'S VERY EASY SO RIGHT
WILL BE T AS EXPENSIVE AS THE L. C. D. BUTTONS SO
AH YES
S
WOULD SOME
AND IT CAN BE CORRELATED TO ENERGY SOLAR ENERGY SO FOR THE MARKETING ASPECT YOU KNOW SAYING THAT IT'S ECOL
IT IT IS AN AN INTERESTING CONCEPT TO SEE TO HAVE UH VOICE CONTROL
SO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE T. V. AND YOU DON'T NEED A REMOTE CONTROL ACTUALLY SO
BUT IT WILL BE EMBEDDED ON THE T. V. AND NOT ON THE REMOTE CONTROL SO
AND PF WHAT CAN WE THINK A SUPPLEMENT TO
EVEN IT IS FOR S JUST SOME KIDS YOU KNOW SWITCHING CHANNELS ONE TWO THREE FOUR
NEED IT TO BE OKAY
NO Y YOU DO THE MINUTES FIRST OR
BECAUSE THEN YOU NEED UH
YEAH BUT THEN W
OR IS IT DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE ONLY VOICE RECOGNITION AND GESTURE RECOGNITION
OKAY SO YOU YEAH
NO ONE WOULD WOULD BE INTERESTED
NO BUT YOU NEED YOU NEED NEW REMOTE CONTROLLER THEN
CAUSE FOR EXAMPLE YEAH
YEAH YOU WOU YOU WOULD
I DON'T SEE HOW ADDING SPEECH OR GESTURE RECOGNITION WOULD MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL LOOK MORE LIKE GOOGLE
UH THI THIS
SEE
UH NO TREND WATCHING
YEAH SO JUST TO MEET THE USER REQUIREMENTS I WOULD JUST DO A S SHORT ANAL ANALYSIS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET AND TO KIND OF UM
HAVE A BETTER OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S THE FASHION IN GENERAL I'VE CHECKED MORE THAN ONLY THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET SO NEXT
SO AGAIN IT'S PRETTY MUCH SIMILAR TO WHAT I'VE SAID IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING
SO SECOND POINT IS THEY STILL WANT IT IT TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
SO MAYBE IT'S SORT OF RELATED TO WHAT YOU'VE SAID WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND SO ON
SO THAT WERE THE THREE FIRST POINTS FROM THE REMOTE CONTROL UH ANALYSIS
WHA WHAT WE REALLY SEE THIS YEAR IS THAT UH EVERYTHING FROM CLOTHES TO SHOES AND FURNITURE IS IS INSPIRED BY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
EVEN IF IT'S IN GENERAL FASHION WE WANT IT TO BE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
FANCY LOOK AND FEEL HAS ON A SCORE OF SEVEN WOULD HAVE SIX AS IMPORTANCE
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE IT'S THREE
THEN EASY TO USE UH IT'S NOT SO IMPORTANT ACTUALLY WITH RESPECT TO OTHER Y OTHER ONES
SO WE SEE FANCY LOOK AN LOOK AND FEEL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE AND THEN IF WE COMBINE THIS WITH THE FASHION UH FROM MILAN AND PARIS
AND THE OTHER POINT I HAVEN'T MENTION IS PEOPLE WAN WANT TO HAVE A SPONGY TOUCH OKAY SO THIS IS THIS MAYBE DOESN'T REALLY FIT WITH THE WOODEN DESIGN
YEAH THI THIS IS THIS WOULD BE LIKE UM
OKAY THA THA THAT WAS THE MAIN POINT I THINK FROM THE TREND
IN FASHION
MAYBE NOT NO WOOD BUT I MEAN MA MAYBE NOT THE PART YOU TOUCHING YOU KNOW
BUT STILL Y
UM N NEXT I WILL EXPLAIN ONE BY ONE THE FIRST IS GOOGLE CONTROLLER
SO SO THE U THE USER F THE THE U USER INTERFACE SHOULD BE VERY VERY CUTE VERY VERY G UM
IT'S HARD F I IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO REMEMBER IT
WE WANT UH WE WANT OUR CONTROLLER TO BE SMART SO MAYBE WE SHOULD UH USE UM UH
THERE THIS IS THE THREE CONCEPTS OF OUR CONTROLLER
UH I THINK SOME TIME IT'S VERY UH CONVENIENT TO USE VOICE INTERFACE AND GESTURE INTERFACE THAN USE BUTTON
FOR LIMITED VOCABULARY SPEECH RECOGNITION IS VERY RELIABLE AND FOR S LIMITED VOCABULARY GESTURE RECOGNITION IS ALSO VERY
YEAH THEY CANNOT SPEAK AT THE SAME TIME
EVEN YOU H YOU HAVE THE CONTROLLER I CAN I CAN SAY CHANNEL THREE SO IT'S C COME TO CHANNEL THREE I DON'T HAVE TO
NO NO WE WE D WE WE JUST ARE USE UM
EVEN FOR THE F UM BECAUSE THE THE VOCABULARY THE
YEAH THE KEY THE KEY UM THE KEY OF OUR THE KEY FEATURE OF OUR CONTROLLER IS THAT IT'S IT HAS SOME SOME UM ADAPTATION
IT'S R IF YOU SELL THIS CONTROLLER IN FRANCE IT CAN RECOGNISE FRENCH
OH N YEAH YEAH THA THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO DO LANGUAGE ADAPTATION
EVEN FOR EACH F FOR EVEN FOR DIFFERENT FAMILY WE HAVE TO DO D YEAH WE WOULD WE HAVE TO DO ADAPTATION TO
I THINK THAT'S N THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR A MICROPHONE
YOU USE YOUR COMMAND AND YOU DO S YOUR GESTURE
NO NO IT'S N Y IF YOU LOSE IT
YOU CAN SEE THEY CAN SWITCH FORM ONE MODALITY TO ANOTHER
WELL IF YOU DO LANGUAGE ADAPTATION THERE SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM
YEAH BUT IF IF YOU STICK TO UM
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR CONTROLLER WITH OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET
THERE'S NO K FEATURES OF OUR CONTROLLER SO IS THERE IS THERE ANY NECESSARY TO DESIGN NEW CONTROLLER WITHOUT ANY BREAKTHROUGH FEATURES
WOULD Y WOULD YOU REPLACE YOUR CONTROLLER WITH A CONTROLLER WITH SIMILAR FUNCTION IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SOME SOME FUNCTION INSIDE IT THAT
YEAH YOU Y THAT'S A FUN THAT'S NOT THE FUNCTION OF THE CONTROLLER THAT'S A FUNCTION OF T. V.
YEAH BUT WE DO WE DO WE WE WE CANNOT RELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ON THESE FEATURES TO U TO USE THE CONTROLLER
YEAH IF IF IF IF YOU'RE IF YOU AR IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A PRODUCT IT WORKS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RELIABLE WOULD YOU REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER ONE
OH YES BUT THERE'S NO BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL CONTROLLER
THE THEN NN NO
THA
BUT THE THERE'S THERE'S N THERE'S N NOT ENOUGH MOTIVATION FOR THEM TO REPLACE THEIR OLD CONTROLLER WITH A NEW ONE IF THERE'S NO KEY FEATURE IN THE NEW CONTROLLER
YEAH MAYBE WE CAN FIRST COME TO
SO YOU GOT EMAIL
UH YES
YOUR JUDGEMENT IT'S IS BIASED
SO MAYBE I WILL LET THE OUR TWO DESIGNERS TALK ABOUT SO THEIR YOU HAVE S OH SORRY
GENETICALLY MODIFIED MUSHROOM I WILL SAY BUT KEEP ON SPEAKING
WE WILL HAVE FIRST TO SO MISTER MONEY WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ACCORDING TO THIS REMOTE CONTROL
MAYBE IF YOU CHANGE IF YOU TAKE THE BUTTONS OUT AND MAYBE DO THINGS LIKE THAT
IT WOULD BE BET MORE LIKE A LEMON
WHAT'S THE USE FOR THAT
IS IT BETTER LIKE THAT
IT LOOKS LIKE A NOW YOU TOOK IT
SEVEN IS THE MA THE MAXIMUM
THREE I WILL SAY THREE
YOU SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT YOU THERE'S UM MICROPHONE INSIDE AN
OH OK I UNDERSTAND
YOU TAKE TAKE THE REMOTE SO AND YOU CAN TURN LIKE THAT TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL
I THINK IT'S QUITE EASY TO SO S ZAPPING BUT MAYBE IT WILL BE TOO FAST
YEAH YOU HAVE A LIKE THAT AND SO ON
YEAH BUT Y BUT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS IF YOU WANT TO GO
YEAH TH YOU HAVE THE VOCAL COMMANDS
SO THREE
THREE
YOU CAN'T PUT IT OUT
IT'S JUST YOUR TURNING FROM THE BASE
SO NOBODY W WILL LOST LOSE IT
S MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE FROM TH
EASY TO USE FOUR
THREE
SO TH THE PROJECT IS ACCEPTED
BUT I D M I THINK THAT IT WILL BE GOOD TO DO SOME MORE WORK TO TRANSFORM THIS INTO A PINEAPPLE
IF YOU RE WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE A FRUITFUL REMOTE CONTROL
SO AS WE ALL AGREE TO ACCEPT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THE PROTOTYPE WE'LL HAVE LOOK TO THE FINAL SH FINANCIAL VIEW
AS I SAID IN THE FIRST MEETING WE NEED TO HAVE SO A REMOTE CONTROL THAT WOULD COST NOT MORE THAN TWELVE AND POINT FIFTY EUROS
AND IF NOT IF IT'S NOT THE CASE Y YOU WOULD HAVE TO REDESIGN IT
SHEET SO SO IT HAS THE ENERGY SOURCE
NO WE DON'T USE THAT
KINETIC WE DON'T HAVE IT I SUPPOSE BUT WE HAVE SOLAR CELLS
UM HOW MANY DO Y DO YOU NEED SOLAR CELLS
AS NUMBER OF BRANCHES
THREE
ONE
ONE
AS WE HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION I THINK
OKAY JUST KEEP ON GOING JUST TO HAVE AN IDEA
ONE
Y MAYBE TWO
WE DON NO
SO NO BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
OKAY WE I THINK WE HAVE PROBLEM
I THINK WE S IF WE KEEP ON ADDING THINGS SO WE HAVE TO
MAYBE IF W T IF SUPPOSE IF WE CHANGE AND WE G PUT JUST ONE
HAS IT CHANGED
YEAH BUT WE HAVE YOU THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION NO
AN BUT WE HAVE INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL WITH PUSH DUT BUTTON
AND I THINK THIS IS ONE
S UNCURVED
MAYBE DON'T BAT NO BATTERY ONLY SOLAR CELLS
WE ONLY NEED MAYBE JUST ONE
SO YEAH YOU WILL HAVE SO ONE BUTTON AND S
IT THINK WE WE'VE DONE GOOD JOB AS THE COST IS
BUT IT WOULD I BE INTERESTING FOR OUR MARKETING TEAM TO MAKE A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT CONCERNING THESE SOLAR CELLS TO BE
YEAH BUT IT WILL BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVA INNOVATIVE SO
AND NEW IDEAS ABOUT NEW PRODUCTS MAYBE WI WHICH WOULD BE FASHION AND UH
AH THE LEMON T. V. WITH THE PINEAPPLE REMOTE CONTROL
YOU COULD F WE COULD DO A KIND OF FRUIT COLLECTION OF ELECTRONICS THINGS
AH SUCH YEAH
IT'S INTERESTING MAYBE WE CAN CREATE A A LINE OF UH T. V. WITH UH A A TR
WE'RE JUST AT TWELVE FIFTY EUROS
THE THING NOW IS TO TO SELL IT
SO MAYBE WE CAN JUST INTEGRATE IT ON TH ON ONE SIDE THE DOUBLE R.
SO WE HAVE THE LOGO WE HAVE THE COLOUR AND WE HAVE THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS SO WE HAVE THE SLOGAN TOO
YEAH TH NO IT'S THE IT'S THE PINEAPPLE CONTROL REMOTE CONTROL
WILL YOU BUY ONE
I THINK IT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO JUST TO SEE IF WE CAN IF PEOPLE WILL BUY THIS ONE AND MAYBE ADD SOME FEATURES TO IT AFTER YEAH
SO READY
UH THI THIS REMOTE CONTROL WILL STAY A PROTOTYPE
UH
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT LIKE REALLY MUSHROOM BECAUSE YOU HAVE UH YOU KNOW UH LIKE LEMON SHAPE YOU KNOW CENTRE IS YELLOW AND T D
I DON'T THINK I HOPE NOBODY WILL EAT IT
YOU KNOW TO INTEGRATE THE FRUIT ASPECT YOU KNOW THE THE IN
OH UH I'M NOT SURE
WE CAN IT'S A VEG A KIND OF VEGETABLE BUT YOU KNOW WE WE INTEGRATED THEM WITH DIFFERENT COLOUR
AND INSPIRED COLOUR AND AND VERY SOPHISTICATED MATERIAL SO
SO WHAT WE W WHAT I CAN ADD IS THAT YOU KNOW HE TALK ABOUT WHAT IS OUTSIDE
SO WHAT IS INSIDE IS WHAT WE DIS WHAT WE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT YOU KNOW THE CHIP IT IS A LOW LEVEL CHIP AND
YOU KNOW WI THE LOW LEVEL CHIPS INSIDE AND YOU KNOW THE L. C. D. BUTTON AND THE I
IT IS IN TH IN IN THE BASE YEAH
I DON'T THE SHA THE BOWL SHAPE PEOPLE LIKE
IS IT REALLY FANCY
BUT IT'S YOU HAVE THE LEMON ASPECT OF THIS TH THIS THIS THING
THAT'S UH YEAH IS THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
I HAVE NO IDEA SO
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
SO WE CAN WE CAN SAY T
I'LL GI
THREE IT'S OKAY
THREE THREE
THREE IS FINE FOR ME
IS IT EASY TO USE
YE UH
AND I THINK YOU YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A ROU A ROUND REMOTE CONTROL SO IT IS
EH FOR TH THE VOCAL COMMAND YES IT'S MIGHT BE EASY
AS A PRINCIPLE
I THINK MAYBE IF YOU HE
YEAH BUT Y HOW YOU NEED TO KNOW I
I THINK B BUT THE THE VOCAL COMMAND IS EASY TOO
UH YEAH AND Y THAT'S YEAH
TO SEE UH YEAH UH
IT IS A TURN OFF T TURN OFF BUTTON MAYBE
S BUT I DI I DIDN'T SEE WHERE THE T F THE TURN OFF T TURN ON TURN OFF BUTTON SO MUCH ACTIVATES MAYBE ONE OF THE
EASY TO USE IT'S VERY RELATIVE BUT THREE IT'S FINE I THINK IT'S REASONABLE THREE
THREE F THREE FOR ME IT'S O IT'S OKAY
MAYBE YOU CAN VOTE TO SEE HOW MANY EVERYBODY GIVES AND NO AND JUST TAKE THE MEAN
WILL YOU GIVE
YEAH BUT Y YOU KNOW
IN FACT ON A FLAT PLACE
OH YE YES THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH MAYBE MAYBE MAY IT'S THE NEXT PROTOTYPE MAYBE WE COU
YEAH FOUR IT'S MORE REASONABLE
YOU CAN YOU CAN ERASE WITH THIS ER YEAH
YEAH FOUR IT'S MORE REASONABLE SO
SO IT'S NINE NINE OVER THREE
IT NEED MAYBE SOME WO FURTHER WORK BUT IT'S
YEAH UH S YEAH
UH I THINK IN EACH BALL YOU HAVE THREE THREE UH YEAH THREE YEAH
S S SIMPLE SIMPLE YEAH
ONE MAYBE YEAH
IS IT
IS SH IT
IS YES A WOODEN PL I AND THAT'S THERE'S NO WOOD SO PLASTIC JUST ONLY I THINK
ONE YOU HAVE
Y YOU TU YOU TURN YOU TURN IT SO
SCR
YEAH IT WAS STAGE ONE SO
ONE
I CAN REMOVE MAYBE F YOU HAVE FIVE WITH PUSH BUTTONS SO WE CAN JUST I DUNNO TRY TO MODIFY SOME OF THEM TO HAVE YEAH
F SOME
OH WHAT
IT'S IT'S A BAD IDEA SO
ONE
ONE S ONE SCROLL WHEEL SO AND THE VOCAL CHORD IT'S FINE
THE SOLAR CELLS R IS I IS IT
YEAH TO BE ABLE TO SI TO SELL IT
YEAH WITH MI
YEAH I THINK I FIND IT REALLY FUNNY AND AMAZING AND INTERESTING TO GO THROUGH ALL THE PROCESS TO FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END
YEAH YOU CUSTOMISE IT EVERY TI SO EVERY TI IF PEOPLE CHANGE YOU JUST CHANGE THE APPEARANCE AND Y Y YOU CAN KEEP
THE MOOD OF PERSONS THE FASHIONS UH
WE INT
SO WHAT I AND DO W IS IT OKAY
YEAH THE PR AT
YEAH BUT I THINK F IT'S REALLY A CELEBRATING OBJECT
SO IT'S YELLOW AND VERY A VERY HA IT'S VERY HAPPY SO
UH IT'S IT'S A PR IT'S LIKE YEAH
GOO AND GOOD LUCK SO
S
I I THINK I LIKE THE THE COLOUR A THE COLOUR ARE VERY GOOD SO ACTUALLY SO
I P IS TH Y THE THE YELLOW BALL THING THAT
UH F LIKE Y WE CAN WE CAN PUT SOME UH DOUBLE R.
THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD IDEA SO
OH THAT
OH UNID UH UNIDENTIFIED REMOTE CONTROL SO
I CAN HEL I WILL TRY VERSIONS SO TO SEE HOW EASY EASY TO MANAGE
YEAH I ALWAYS LOSE MY YEAH SO SO I IF IT IS A UNIVERSAL ONE I CAN USE IT WITH MY T. V. SO IT WOULD BE
IT'S WILL ENLIGHT YOUR HOUSE YOUR HOME AND YOUR T. V. SO
FINAL PROTOTYPE YEAH YE YEAH
S SO WHO IS GOING TO TAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL
INSPIRA INSPIRATION IS
BUT WE SAY UH WE SA WE SAID SOLAR
GOOD IT IS INSTEAD OF JUST TALKING ABOUT UH WE HAD THREE KEYS KEY POINTS TO UH FOR THIS REMOTE CONTROL DESIGN AND FIRST ONE WAS UH
LOOK AND FEEL
SO W WE'LL TRY TO JUDGE THIS FEATURE UH WITH A ONE TO SEVEN SCALE ONE BEING UH NO I THINK
ONE ONE BEING TRUE AND SEVEN BEING FALSE
UH I'LL AGREE IT'S UNIQUE BUT IS IT REALLY
YEAH I MEAN FANCY WAS WAS DEFINED BY S FRUIT AND VEGETABLE LOOK
FIRST ONE IS WE HAVE TO JUDGE THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
NO THE COLOUR IS OKAY THAT'S FINE
THREE
THREE
YEAH TH THAT'S ANOTHER REALLY GOOD POINT
IS IT EASY TO USE
YEAH BUT THIS THIS TURNING CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST RE EXPLAIN ME THE
YEAH BUT IMAGINE YOU Y
YEAH I'M I'M NO I'M NOT DEFINITELY CONVINCED IT'S IT'S THE BEST WAY TO IF YOU WANNA JUMP FROM I DUNNO ONE TO TWENTY
YEAH JU JUST IMAGINE YOU HAVE FIFTY FIFTY CHANNELS UH
HOW D HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS ANGLE IS TH IS THE CORRECT ONE
BUT W WE'VE SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TH L THE MAIN
YEAH BUT IT HAS TO BE ON TO RECOGNISE FAS
AH THAT'S NOT THE ECOLOGICAL PART YEAH
SO REASONABLY IS FOUR IS ONE
SO THREE
UH WE WOULDN'T SAY I MEAN THOSE ARE SORT OF AGREED BUT THIS ONE WOULD BE MORE FIVE TO ME
I'M NOT REALLY CONVINCED IT'S SO EASY TO USE BUT I DON'T KNOW
BUT THIS THIS HAS TO STAY ON THE TABLE RIGHT
THIS HAS TO STAY ON THE TABLE
YOU KNOW THA THAT'S THE WEAK POINT BECAUSE WITH A TRADITIONAL ONE YOU JUST HAVE ONE HAND
THREE
YEAH ESPECIALLY ON THE EASY TO USE
UM NO
NO Y I IT DID CHANGE BUT JUST IMAGINE WE HAVE
YEAH BUT THIS ONE ONE OF THE FEATURE WE WERE NOT REALLY
YEAH IF
WE COULD TURN WE COULD TURN EVERYTHING IN EITHER YELLOW OR BLACK
BLACK THEN IS A REGULAR COLOUR SO
YEAH ONE
SO PUSH BUTTON THEN IT'S IT'S THE NEXT EXPENSIVE ONE
YEAH THI THIS MIGHT BE
CLOSE TO
CASE WHAT'S THE CA
ONE WHEEL
YEAH Y ACTUALLY IT'S WRONG
THAT'S NICE ARGUMENT BUT IF IT'S IT'S STILL FOUR OUR OF TWELVE
UH THAT'S WHAT WE'VE JUST DONE
UH THA THAT WAS GOOD BUT WE SHOULD HAVE MORE BRAINSTORMING LIKE MEETINGS MAYBE
T. V. IS MORE LIKE FIFTEEN YEARS MAYBE SO
THA THAT WOULD THAT WOULD MAKE IT
I'M NOT SO HAPPY ABOUT THE FRUIT SHAPE YOU KNOW
NO THE COLOURS ARE UH IT'S PERFECT YEAH
UH YEAH ANOTHER THING IS THE LOGO IS MISSING STILL
UH
CUTE NA
AH THAT IS THREE
SO THIS IS OUR PRODUCT OR PROTOTYPE
SO WE USED TWO BASIC COLOUR YELLOW AND RED
NEXT A MO
SO WE CAN TURN THIS BALL TO T TO SELECT CHANNEL
YEAH S OKAY
UH THIS STA UH THIS TRIANGLE BASE IS VERY STABLE SO
UH SO IT'S IT'S UM IT'S UNLIKELY YOU CANNOT FOUND IT
SO IT'S V UM YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE TABLE SO YOU CAN TURN THE THE BALL TO CHA TO SELECT THE CHANNEL
YOU C CAN CAN YOU CAN SEE THE THE SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS N IS A MUSHROOM SO
YEAH TH THAT'S WHY IF YOU PUT IT IN THE TABLE BE CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL EAT IT
UH NO THIS OUR ONLY TWO SLIDES
SO WE CUT IT TO SEE
SO IT DEPEND ON HOW D DO YOU DEFINE FANCY
UH
UH
AH IT'S EMBEDDED YOUR MICROPHONE
TH THIS TH TH THERE'S TWO TWO FUNCTIONS
THERE FOUR MICROPHONE
YOU JUST TU TURN D D
I IF Y UH IF IT DEPEND ON THE THE ANGLE YOU TURN THE
Y UH FIFTH CHANNEL DIVIDED BY THE NUM BY THE BY THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN DEGREE
SO YOU GOT HOW MANY DEGREE YOU YOU IT
NO NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO Y NO IT'S UH WHEN YOU WHEN YOU STOP T UH WHEN YOU STOP THE
THEN THE ANGLE YOU STOP IS THE ANGLE YOU IS THE CHANNEL YOU
IT'S IT'S VERY EASY BECAUSE YOU KN YOU KNOW HOW MANY CHANNEL ARE THERE IN THE
YOU CA YOU CAN TURN THIS
OR YOU CA YOU CAN YOU CAN ALSO TURN THIS
FOR THIS YOU CAN TUNE IT'S FOR TUNE
IF YOU WANT TO FROM UH SKIP FROM CHANNEL ONE TO CHANNEL TEN YOU TUNE THIS
YEAH IS IS THIS IS FROM ONE CHANNEL TO MAYBE TO TEN CHANNEL
THIS IS FROM ONE CHANNEL TO
UH W W WHAT DO Y WHAT UH YOU COMPARE WITH TRADITIONAL UH UM TR TRADITIONAL CONTROLLER
YEAH YEAH YEAH Y YOU YOU CAN DO IT
BUT YOU CAN ALSO DO IT IN THE B IF YOU YOU DO NOT WA IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BROWSING ALL THE CHANNEL YOU CAN JUST P THERE'S ALSO A BUTTON HERE
YEAH THIS FUNCTION IS JUST FOR YOUR BROWSING FROM ONE CHANNEL TO TH THE NEXT ONE THE NEXT S SN S THE TH THE THIRD ONE
Y ONE TO TEN TEN TO TWELVE UH TEN TO T UH TWENTY
TEN TO TWENTY AND THIS ONE T ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX LIKE THIS
THREE
WE HAVE CHANGE THE ELECTRONICS TO FROM FROM THE THE THE SAMPLE SENSOR TO REGULAR CHIP
YEAH IT'S THE ONE IT'S M MAYBE WE HA WE HAVE TWO VERSIONS THE FIRST VERSION THE BASIC VERSION
PLASTIC IS FREE
HOW ABOUT WE CHANGE THE SALE
AH WE HAVE ONE
COU COULD WE HAVE LOOK
YEAH I THINK IT'S NOT T T
YEAH BUT Y YOU KNOW THE TRADITIONAL T. V. IT'S UM
PA
YEAH YOU TOLD ME YOU H YOU D YOU D YOU LOST YOUR CONTROL YOUR T. V. SO SO YOU NEED TO BUY ONE
SO BUY ONE
AH WELL IF NO ONE ELSE WANTS TO YEAH
WELL I DON'T REALLY HAVE A FAVOURITE ANIMAL BUT UM UH I THINK I HAVE ONE IN MIND SO UH
UNLESS IT'S A THREE DIMENSIONAL WEB WHICH Y THEY HAVE SOMETIMES
AND UH THE OTHER THING IS SOME SPIDERS CAN ACTUALLY UH FLY LIKE UH THEY HAVE UH THEY LET OUT LIKE UH A STREAM OF LIKE THE WEB BUILDING MATERIAL BUT IT'S IT ACTS LIKE A PARACHUTE SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY KIND OF GO AND FIND NEW UH BUILD A NEW WEB SOMEWHERE ELSE
SO I THINK THEY DID THIS IN UH IN CHARLOTTE'S WEB THAT MOVIE THAT LITTLE UH WELL IT'S ACTUALLY A BOOK FIRST BUT UH
UM AT THE END ALL THE THE SPIDERS KINDA FLEW AWAY
SO IS THIS UH AN INDIAN OR AN AFRICAN ELEPHANT 'CAUSE YOU HAVEN'T DRAWN THE EARS
IS THIS A STAND ALONE UNIT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING
A KIND OF A LITTLE STRANGE IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THE PRODUCT IS YET
WHAT PEOPLE AR ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR UM WHAT KIND OF PRODUCT THEY'RE EXPECTING FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO BECAUSE IT SEEMS QUITE A LOT FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TO HAVE OUR FIRST KICK OFF MEETING ABOUT UH THIS NEW PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO TAK TO TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES
UM SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK TO THE THE AGENDA
WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS AGENDA UH AND MAINLY FIRST TO UH TO MAKE TO TO BE USED TO THE TOOLS UH AVAILABLE IN THIS NICE AND SMART MEETING ROOM WE HAVE HERE
SO THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO UH DEVELOPED A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
IT IS IN THREE STEP AS YOU KNOW
DURING EACH STEP UH OF EACH DESIGN WE WI YOU WILL WORK UH S SEPARATELY
INDIVIDUALLY ON UH YOUR SPECIFIC TASKS AND WILL M WE WILL MEET TO UM TO DISCUSS AND TAKE DECISIONS ABOUT UH WHAT YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU DID AND WHAT UH WE WILL DO NEXT
WE HAVE TO TO TRAIN OURSELF WITH ALL THE UM THE TOOLS AVAILABLES IN THE IN THIS NICE MEETING ROOM AND UH PARTICULARLY THE THE WHITE BOARD SO UH WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE WHITE BOARD AND TAKE SOME UM S SOME NOTES OR DO SOME DRAWINGS
YOU HAVE ONE IN MIND
GUILLERMO YOU WANT TO
YEAH WE'LL DISCUSS A F A FLY OR DO WE'LL DO ANOTHER MEETING ABO ON ELEPHANTS
SO SO ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROJECT IS ABOUT MONEY UH AND ABOUT SO ABOUT FINANCES
SHOULD BE SHOULD SHOULD IT BE UM SPECIFIC REMOTE CONTROL TO SOME SPECIFIC DEVICE
SHOULD IT BE A UNIVERSAL ONE
SO IT SHOULD BE THE TOPIC OF MAYBE OF THE NEXT MEETING JUST TO TO HAVE AN OVERVIEW OF THIS AND UH IN WHICH DIRECTION WE SHOULD GO
UH WE'LL HAVE A NEW MEETING SOON AND UH SO THE WORK EVERY EVERY OF YOU HA HAVE T D TO DO
UM SURE
SO NOT THE FAVOURITE ANIMAL BUT I THINK I'LL DRAW ELEPHANT
AT LEAST FEW FEW HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS NO MEANS OF TRANSPORTATIONS OR SOMETHING
OKAY SOME OTHER TIME
HI I'M GUILLERMO
UH YEAH YEAH
HE IT CAN HIDE ITSELF VERY EASILY AND IT'S IT'S IT LOOKS LIKE UM POWERFUL STRONG UH I DUNNO
'CAUSE IT ALSO LIKE IN ENGLISH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU KNOW THE MAN'S TOOL YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW MEN LIKE TO HAVE CONTROL OF THE REMOTE SO IT MIGHT
AND WE COULD HAVE SOME LIKE YOU D YOU COULD HAVE THE FONTS YOU KNOW SPECIAL
SO YOU HAVE MAN IN LIKE IN IN UH IN ONE O IN ONE FONT AND THEN THE O. AS LIKE
WE NEED TO KNOW WHO WE'RE SELLING IT TO BEFORE WE CAN REALLY DECIDE ON A
WELL TH THE ON THE THING IS THOUGH MOST REMOTE CONTROLS ARE USED BY MORE THAN ONE PERSON
UH
THIS REMOTE HERE IS KIND OF IS VERY THIN AND LONG SO INSTEAD OF HAVING YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE IT KIND OF A BIT BIGGER OR
YOU COULD EVEN HAVE SOME BUTTONS LIKE YOU KNOW ON THE SIDES AND EVERYTHING BUT
OH YOU PRESS A PRESS A BUTTON TO TALK AND THE THE T. V. THE T. V. SOUND TURNS OFF
OKAY SO COULD I DESCRIBE THE MOUSE MAYBE BE EASIER TO COULD I USE THE MOUSE OR
OKAY SO UM WHILE UH RESEARCHING THIS THIS TOPIC I FIRST OF ALL JUST THOUGHT OF A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN A REMOTE
AND JUST UH LOOKED TO SEE IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE IN ANY CURRENT REMOTES
SO UM THERE'S A PRETTY WIDE RANGE OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS THESE DAYS AND AND UH THIS REMOTE CONTROL ON THE RIGHT HERE IS IS ONE OF THE MORE EXTRAVAGANT
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY IT'S BY NO MEANS UH
MM YOU KNOW ON IT'S OWN IN BEING SO EXPENSIVE
UM AND IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE UNIVERSAL REMOTES OUT UM ON THE MARKET I KNOW WE'RE WORKING ON TELEVISION REMOTE
BUT A LOT OF THE UNIVERSAL REMOTES OUT THERE HAVE UH HAVE THESE L. C. D. SCREENS WHICH KIND OF HELPS WHEN YOU'RE USING MULTIPLE UH DEVICES I SUPPOSE BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE KIND OF FUNCTIONS D DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ON THE SCREEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES
BUT UM THE THING THAT I FIND MOST INTERESTING ABOUT THIS REMOTE CONTROL
AND IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO UH TO SEE IN THE SLIDE BUT IT HAS A SCROLL WHEEL ON IT
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE UH A MOUSE SCROLL WHEEL WHICH I THINK IS IT'S A REALLY KIND OF IMPORTANT DESIGN ASPECT UM IS IT'S
'CAUSE THE THING IS WHAT A WHAT WE THE PRESEN THIS PRESENTATION WE HAD IS WHAT WE WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO ACTUALLY DO
UH THE I THINK THAT A SCROLL WHEEL IS ACTUALLY PRETTY A PRETTY HANDY WAY OF OF CHANGING THE CHANNEL
'CAUSE I KNOW WHEN I UM WHEN I USE THE REMOTE TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL I VERY RARELY USE THE NUMBERS ON THE ON THE PAD
NOW UM THE THE SCROLL WHEEL IS IS MUCH MORE USEFUL IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN
IF WE NOW WE NEED TO STILL TALK ABOUT THE PRICE POINT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THIS STUFF CAN'T BE DONE FOR TWENTY FIVE EU UH EURO BUT
ONE POSSIBILITY IS TO DOWNLOAD PROGRAM INFORMATION INTO THE L. C. D. SCREEN SO THAT INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY SAYING I WANT TO I WANT TO GO TO CHANNEL THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE I KNOW THIS PROGRAMME'S ON
YOU KNOW OFTEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT CH WHAT CHANNEL IT'S ON OR YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S ON
IF YOU HAVE A LIST OF OF PROGRAMS ON YOUR L. C. D. SCREEN YOU JUST SCROLL TO THAT PROGRAM RATHER THAN TO A CHANNEL
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A YOU KNOW IN MOBILE PHONES NOW YOU DON'T USE YOU DON'T REMEMBER PEOPLE'S PHONE NUMBER
SO THIS WOULD BE PRETTY KIND OF A HANDY THING TO HAVE BUT UM WE WE REALLY NEED T TO DISCUSS THE PRICE
THERE'S ONLY A FEW BUTTONS BUT AL EACH OF THOSE BUTTONS DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT
BUT I THINK ALSO YOU KNOW THE LOCATION AND AND SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS
SO IF YOU HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS IT IT IT INCREASES THE THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING THE ONE YOU WANT
YEAH WELL WE W
UM I THINK MAYBE ONE OPTION IS TO HAVE YOU KNOW A LITTLE FLIP OPEN UM DOOR THAT UH THAT YOU HAVE HIDDEN MOST OF THE TIME
I I WOULD IF I HAD MY PERFECT REMOTE CONTROL I'D PROBABLY JUST HAVE NO NUMBERS AT ALL ON IT BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST IN THE WAY
MAYBE YOU KNOW I ALTHOUGH I DO ALSO FIND FLIP OPEN DOORS A BIT OF A PAIN BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY CAN BREAK OFF OR OR WHATEVER
BUT MAYBE A DOOR THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN PERMANANTLY REMOVE OR PERMANANTLY HAVE ON WOULD BE GOOD
IF YOU IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT ADVERTISEMENT SHOWING HOW HOW HOW EASY IT IS AND HOW YOU CAN
YOU KNOW NAVIGATE TO A PROGRAM WITHOUT THE NUMBERS THEN PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT LOOKS PRETTY EASY
BUT I THINK ONE MAYBE ONE OPTION SINCE THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A KIND OF A FASHIONABLE DEVICE
IS YOU KNOW THERE'S A CERTAIN KIND OF COOL OR WOW FACTOR THAT YOU CAN KIND OF YOU CAN HAVE WITH TECHNOLOGY
YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING MAYBE YOU COULD SELL AS AN EXTRA SO THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PART OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE MAY NEED TO HAVE AS AS AT LEAST AS AN OPTIONAL EXTRA TO TO KINDA MAKE OUR PRODUCT COOL
WELL ONE ONE OTHER THING THAT THAT SPEECH RECOGNITION COULD REALLY BLOW OUT THE PRICE FOR IS UH WHEN YOU WANT TO SELL INTO OTHER MARKETS
SO THEN YOU HAVE TO S YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TRAIN MODELS FOR
YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU COULD ACTUALLY TRAIN THE REMOTE CONTROL AS YOU'RE USING IT BY SAYING YOU KNOW TURN VOLUME UP
AND YOU PRESS THE UH PRESS THE BUTTON LIKE UH S PEOPLE TEACH SIGN LANGUAGE TO KIDS F WELL BY SPEAKING AND DOING
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO YOU KNOW DROWN OUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING BY TALKING YOU KNOW WHEN I'M WHEN I'M INSTEAD OF PRESSING UP ON ON A REMOTE CONTROL
YOU KNOW IF THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME DIALOGUE ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT I CAN'T HEAR
I'M TRYING TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT WHAT'S BEING SAID SO MAYBE SPEECH RECOGNITION GETS IN THE WAY MORE THAN IT HELPS
WELL IT DEPENDS IF IT'S A REMOTE CONTROL TH
MAYBE IF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS SOMETHING THAT Y YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO PICK UP ANYMORE THAT WOULD BE A A USEFUL FEATURE OF THE SPEECH RECOGNTION
WELL TH
YOU COULD HAVE A L EVEN A LITTLE IMAGE OF YOU KNOW THE C YOU KNOW THE THE M THE MAIN ACTORS OR SOMETHING SO YOU CAN QUICKLY JUST KIND OF EVEN WITHOUT READING
UH
WELL I I THINK IF WE'RE GONNA I THINK WE WOULD DEFINITELY NEED THE INTERNET CONNECTION BECAUSE EVEN WITH Y I DON'T THINK YOU COULD EVEN GET TELETEXT INFORMATION FROM THE T. V. ONTO THE REMOTE CONTROL
WE NEED TO FIND THAT OUT
WELL THE THING IS I THINK I THINK THE TYPE OF PEOP
OKAY LET'S HAVE A LOOK TO THE AGENDA TODAY
UM SO FIRST BEFORE STARTING I W JUST GOING TO UH TO GO QUICKLY TO THROUGH THE MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING
SO UH BASICALLY WE WE ARE NOT DECIDED IF W WE SHOULD GO FOR A UNIVERSAL OR SPECIFIC UH UH REMOTE CONTROL
BUT I HAVE NEW UM NEW I INPUTS FOR ABOUT THAT TOPICS
AND UH BASICALLY WE DECIDED TO UM TO UH GO TO INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS FOR EACH OF YOU UH SO UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SHOULD WOR WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK ON TH ON TH ON THE WORKING DESIGN
YOU SHOWED US YOU AR YOU YOU PREPARE SOMETHING FOR US
ALRIGHT SO SO WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THREE OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS
BUT FIRST I WOULD LIKE QUICKLY TO UH TO DECIDE OF TO GIVE A NAME TO THE PROJECT
BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY O OTHER NAMES THAT WE CO COULD DECIDE FOR JUST TO TO KEEP SOMETHING FUN FOR OUR PROJECT WE WE SHOULD WE COULD DISCUSS QUICKLY
M. D. O.
OKAY I THINK THIS IS MORE A QUESTION OF OF I I THINK THIS IS MORE A QUESTION OF OF LOOK AND FEEL
WE SHOULD WE SHOULD GO TO OTHER FOR THE OTHER TOPICS
S THAT'S COMING
UH OKAY
ON THE SIDES
WE HAD THE NEW REQUIREMENTS FROM THE SO UH FROM THE HEAD OFFICES OF THE COMPANY
OKAY SO LET'S KEEP IN MIND ABOUT THA THAT THAT THIS LAST POINT ABOUT L. C. D. AND SPEECH UH RECO
THE WHEEL DOESN'T WORK
OKAY CAN YOU CONTINUE PLEASE MI
OKAY SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE THAT THERE IS A NEW WAY OF INTERACTING THAT USE WHEEL
WELL WH UH I IMAGINE ALSO THAT THE MICROPHONE WILL BE AN AMBIANCE UM A UM AN AMBIENCE MICROPHONES BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SPEAK INTO INTO TH INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO IT COULD BE S A FEW CENTIMETRES
OKAY WE SHOU WE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS LA LATER AFTER AFTER AFTER THIS THIS UH SLIDE
UM SO IF I IF I KIND OF SUMMARISE EVERYTHING WE'VE DE WE WE SAID
UM WE HAVE OR GOOD SHAPE YES
WE SHOULD BRING NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLES AND UH AS WE HAVE UH ALSO REQUIREMENTS TO TO USE UH TO TO PUSH THR TOWARD THE INTERNET
A VERY INTERESTING THINGS I I I'VE SEEN ON ON ON THE ONE OF THE COMP O OUR COMPETITOR IS THIS WHEEL THAT WE CAN USE TO NAVIGATE
SO SO MY FEELING IS THAT RE REGARDING COSTS BUDGET WE HAVE AN AN AN TARGET PRICE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO GO S TO GO TO L. C. D.
UH FIRST M M WHY NOT TO GO TO L. C. D.
BECAUSE UM IN FACT AS WE ARE TARGETING UH T. V. IN FACT WE CAN USE T. V. SCREEN AS A SCREEN TO FEEDBACK TO TO GIVE SOME FEEDBACK INFORMATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE COULD HAVE
DON DON'T YOU HA DON'T WE HAVE CONTACTS WITH UH PEOPLE ON T. V. OR OR WELL SYSTEMS THAT EXIST THAT WE CAN USE
COULD WE FIT THE THE TARGETS UH IN TERMS OF COST UH IF WE GO S TO L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO YOU MEAN YO YOU MEAN WE WE SHOULD TARGET SOMETHING MAYBE WHICH IS WHICH WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT RE REALLY FANCY IN TERMS TO UM IN TERMS TO HAD TO HAVE REALLY AN ADDED VALUE
TH TH YOU HAVE A TELETEXT SIN SIGNAL THAT YOU CAN THAT YOU CAN UH THAT YOU CAN GET THR THROUGH THE CHANNEL
THEY HAVE T MOST OF THEM HAVE TELETEXT
BUT WE WANT TO GET RID WELL ONE OF OUR REQUIREMENTS IS TO UH TO MOVE TO TELETEXT TO UH TO THE USE OF INTERNET
SO TO TO UH
THE TI THE START TIME ALL THE P ALL THE PROGRAMMES YOU COULD HAVE UH O
SO SO THAT MEAN W W WE NEED AN IN AN EXTRA INTERNET CONNECTION TO USE THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND THEY WANT TO GO T FOR UNIVERSAL ONE AND THEY TAKE THE FANCIEST THEY CAN HAVE
THE L. C. D. IS STILL ON DISC IS STILL OPEN TO DISCUSSION
IT IS UP TO YOU TO GO THROUGH THIS UM UH THIS WAY AND TO TO REPORT REPORT ME BACK NEXT MEETING
BUT I'M DEFINITELY NOT KEEN ON TO TO NO NO NO I'M NO I'M DEFINIT DEFINITELY NOT KEEN ON GOING TO SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES
UM UH WE I HOPE THAT NEXT MEETING WE WILL UH WE'LL TAKE SOME UM DECISION THAT DIRECTION
MEANS YOU SAY YOU SHOULD SAY LIKE DOES THAT REMOTE CONTROL BEING ON OR BE ON KIND OF THING
BUT THERE IS ONE PROBLEM THEN THE USER HAS TO UNDERSTAND EACH OF THAT FUNCTIONALITY
SO MOST OF THE THINGS WHICH WE ARE DISCUSSING ABOUT IS SPEECH RECOGNITION UH THAT MEANS ON MY OWN I YEAH IT SHOULD BE
OKAY SO THE WORKING DESIGN IS UH USER I INTERFACE COULD BE OF TWO TYPES
ONE IS THE USUAL PRESS BUTTONS WHICH ARE THERE SO THAT THE USER FEELS THAT HE IS KNOING DOING SOME HE IS KNOWING ABOUT THAT TECHNOLOGY
SO HE IS PRETTY COMFORTABLE IF HE WANTS TO GET THIS
IT CAN BE USEFUL FOR THEM AND THE NEW USERS AS UH OUR MARKETING EXPERT WAS SAYING
SO ANYWAY THAT DIDN'T COME INTO MY MIND SO TH THAT IS A POSSIBILITY
THESE COULD BE OTHER KIND OF INTERFACES
SO SPE BUTTONS ARE SOMETHING WHICH IS VERY EVERYBODY IS FAMILIAR WITH
NOW FOR BUTTONS NORMAL REQUIREMENTS LIKE BIT CODING AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE REQUIRED
AND FOR VOICE LIMITED VOCABULARY AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS REQUIRED AND WE REQUIRE A MICROPHONE ALSO TO BE SITTING THERE ON THE REMOTE
UH THAT'S RIGHT
UH YES IF IT IS LIMITED VOCABULARY USUALLY IT'S ENOUGH
UH IT'S MORE LIKE MEANS THERE ARE DIFFERENT SPEECH TECHNOLOGIES WHICH ARE EXISTING SO D. T. W. COULD BE KIND OF WHICH IS THE EASIEST
ON THE CHIP ITSELF AND IT'S JUST DYNAMIC TIME WARPING WHERE YOU TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS
SO WILL YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
YEAH SO THIS IS THE DESIGN WHICH WE ARE THINKING SO
AND THEN WE ARE HAVING THE WHICH IS TO INDICATE WHETHER THE POWER IS ON OR NOT
AND THEN THERE ARE TWO KIND OF THINGS WHICH CAN BE SO ONE IS THE BUTTON INTERFACE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN BECAUSE BECAUSE OF LACK OF TIME
SO NOW WHERE THE A. S. R. DECODER IS SITTING SIMILARLY THERE ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF INTERFACES WHICH COULD BE THERE
SO THIS IS THE EASIEST DESIGN THE THERE COULD BE
SO TH AN A. S. R. DECODER WE CAN HAVE THINGS IN
SO THIS WAS THE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE WAS THAT WE CAN HAVE A. S. R. SITTING THERE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE YEAH THE REASON IS THAT IF WE GO INTO THE MARKET MEANS THOUGH I DON'T HAVE MUCH IDEA BUT AS HE THE UH MARKETING EXPERT PRESENTATION WAS
ARE
IS IT THAT WE ARE TARGETING THE REPLACEMENT REMOTE MARKET OR WHAT
SO THE REMOTE HAS GONE BAD AND THE PERSON WANTS TO BUY A NEW REMOTE OR BECAUSE THE COST OF L. C. D. THING COULD BE AS HIGH AS THE T. V. ITSELF
BROKE
MEANS TH YEAH TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
UH
YEAH BECAUSE IF THE PRODUCT WILL BE INTERNATIONAL
UH
I PREPARE A MARKETING REPORT AND WE HAVE TO FIND THE WEAKNESSES AND AND THE THE IMPROVEMENTS WE COULD DO TO THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
AND ALSO I DI I DID A STUDY WITH FOR THE INCORPORATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IT SEEMS THAT THE REMOTE CONTROLS HAVE BEEN HAVE REMAINED THE SAME FOR THE LAST FIVE
SO AND THEY THEY ADMIT THAT THE THE THEY SHOULD UH S THEY WOULD UH SPEND MORE MONEY IN A FANCIER REMOTE CONTROL
ALSO THE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT ABOUT THE R. S. I. DISEASE WHICH IS IF YOU REPEAT THE SA THE SAME MOVEMENT
SO S PEOPLE ARE UH ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE THE SHAPE OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD POINT TO TO L TO TO FIND A A SOLUTION TO ANY BEEP ANY ALARM OR SOMETHING INCORPORATED TO WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL EVERY TIME IT IT GET LOST
AND ALSO I FOUND THAT YOUNG PEOPLE THE THE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE THE MORE INTERESTED THEY ARE IN INCORPORATING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
UH PEOPLE ALSO COMPLAIN BECAUSE THEY THEY THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME SIZE OF THE BUTTONS FOR BUTTONS WHO W WHICH ARE NOT VERY USE LIKE F UH MEMORISING CHANNELS OR OR THIS KIND OF ACTIONS WHICH ARE NOT VERY OFTEN BUT
THEY THEY SHOULDN'T THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME IMPORTANCE IN THE IN THE UH IN THE REMOTE CONT IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO IT MAY BE INTERESTING TO TO THINK IN A IN BOTH PROTOTYPES FOR RIGHT AND LEFT HANDED PEOPLE
NO NO I WAS THINKING OF SO LIKE SOMETHING YEAH
H I THINK I THINK THAT THE TR THE TRANSITION TO THIS TO THIS NEW REMOTE CONTROL SHOULDN'T BE VERY VERY ABRUPT VERY HARD BECAUSE W IF PEOPLE SEE A REMO SEE THE SEE A REMOTE CONTROL WITHOUT NUMBERS MM THEY WILL THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO LEARN VERY DIFFICULT TO VERY DIFFERENT BUILD VERY DIFFERENT TO THE TRADITIONAL
IF Y
I'M SURE IF YOU CAN SELL A A SPEECH RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS EVERYO EVERYONE WILL S WILL BUY IT
UH
WHA BUT WHAT WOULD BE ONE QUESTION WHAT WOULD BE THE GOAL OF PUTTING AN L. C. D. IN A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH BUT MO MOST OF THE T. V. S NOWADAYS SHOW THE SHOW THE
THE N
SO WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD APPEAR IN THE IN THE L. C. D.
I THINK THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE CHEAPER THE THAN THE L. C. D.
THE EXPERT UH SAID NINETY FIVE PERCENT
HI
UH YES I HAD SOMETHING SIMILAR
OH THEY'RE OKAY SO THEY'RE NOT LIKE DRESSED AS A CARROT THEY JUST HAVE LIKE PICTURES OF FRUIT ON OKAY
SO WHICH FRUIT ARE YOU THINKING OF
OH SO YOU WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO BE THE SHAPE OF A FRUIT OR YOU WANT JUST SOME KIND OF LIKE FRUIT LOGO ON THE
LIKE MAYBE JUST LIKE A LITTLE BIT N A LITTLE FRUIT PICTURE SOMEWHERE IN THE CORNER
TO FRUIT
IS FRUIT COOL
WELL I GUESS YOU KNOW APPLE HAS THE IPOD SO IMAGI JUST 'CAUSE THEY HAVE AN APPLE ON THEIR
ON THEIR PRODUCT DOESN'T MEAN FRUIT IS COOL
OKAY BUT IT HAS TO BE EASY TO UH TO USE THOUGH AND TO HOLD YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANNA PEAR OR A WATERMELON
TOO GREEN
SO BUT I MEAN YOU ALSO HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO ALSO HAVE FIT R ALL THE BUTTONS AND YOU KNOW
IT'S IT
THE THING IS YOU HAVE T NORMALLY WITH UM WITH BUTTONS
THEY HAVE TO BE AT SOME POINT ATTACHED TO A CIRCUIT BOARD SO IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THINGS LIKE ON A CYLINDRICAL KIND OF DEVICE IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO KIND OF TO BUILD
S NEXT UH SLIDE
SO I RECEIVED AN EMAIL UM AROUND LUNCHTIME LETTING ME KNOW THAT THE BRILLIANT MINDS AT OUR TECHNOLOGY DIVISION HAD DEVELOPED AN INTEGRATED PROGRAMMABLE SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER UNIT
UM WHICH IS A WAY FOR YOU TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOUR COFFEE MACHINE AND OR REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S NO WHAT IT IS IT'S IT'S VERY
IT HAS A HAS A MICROPHONE HAS A SPEAKER IT'S GOT A LITTLE CHIP AND IT ALLOWS YOU T
IT CAN DO LIKE A MATCH ON A ON A CERTAIN PHRASE THAT YOU SPEAK AND THEN CAN PLAY BACK A PHRASE IN RESPONSE TO THAT
BUT UH THERE'S NO KIND OF UM UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHRASE
SO I MEAN YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU COULD BUILD THAT IN
YOU COULD YOU COULD LINK THE THE RECOGNITION OF A CERTAIN PHRASE TO SOME FUNCTION ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
BUT BASICALLY THE THING IS WE HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE
UM BUT THE THING IS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S STILL GONNA BE A COST IF YOU DECIDED TO INTEGRATE THAT BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE C PRODUCTION OF THE COMPONENTS
SO UM IT IT BUT IT BASICALLY MEANS WE C WE CAN KIND OF CONSIDER THIS FROM UH YOU KNOW UH A THEORETICAL OR USABILITY KIND OF VIEWPOINT WITHOUT WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW TO DEVELOP IT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS ALREADY DONE
IT'S IT IT'S NO WELL IT'S IT'LL RECOGNIZE UH I GUESS KEYWORDS BUT YOU KNOW KEYWORDS IN A CERTAIN ORDER LIKE A PHRASE
YOU TRAIN IT FOR A CERTAIN UH FOR A CERTAIN PHRASE
YOU SAY THE THE EXAMPLE THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE UH UP AND RUNNING WITH THEIR PROTOTYPE IS UM WELL THEY'VE ACTUALLY INTEGRATED INTO THE INTO THE THE COFFEE MACHINE THAT UH THAT WE'RE PRODUCING IS
ONLY LIKE ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT IT IT CAN RECOGNIZE A SET A SET TARGET KIND OF WORD AN
IT'S DESIGNED IT'S DESIGNED AS A FUN KIND OF THING BUT I GUESS YOU COULD USE IT AS UH AS A WAY TO IMPLEMENT UH
TO USE AS A SPEECH RECOGNITION ENGINE SO
WELL YOU SEE I WAS I WAS UNAWARE AT THIS POINT OF TH OF THE FRUIT FOCUS
BUT UM I'VE JUST INDICATED HERE WE COULD HAVE ACTUALLY TWO SCROLL WHEELS 'CAUSE I THINK THE SCROLL WHEEL IS A FAIRLY UM KEY PART OF
YOU KNOW I THINK EVERYONE HAS HAS AGREED THAT IT'S THAT IT COULD BE QUITE A USEFUL UM THING SO
SO YOU KNOW THE TH THE PERSON MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A UH
OR THEY MIGHT WANT TO SCROLL AND AND HAVE A QUICK GLIMPSE OF IT EVEN IF IT LAGS BEHIND WHAT THEY'RE DOING
YEAH SO WITH THIS TURBO BUTTON YOU CAN SAY SKIP OVER T CHANNELS IF UH YOU KNOW IF I'M IF I'M GOING IF I'M SCROLLING PAST THEM AND YOU KNOW
SO YEAH THAT'S UM THOSE ARE THE TWO IMPORTANT UH FEATURES I THINK WE NEED ON THE REMOTE
WE COULD EITHER CONSIDER THAT MAYBE WE WANT TO SELL THIS AS A VERY IF IT'S GONNA BE A BANANA YOU KNOW THAT'S A PRETTY GIMMICKY KIND OF
I MEAN WE COULD HAVE WELL I GUESS YOU NEED AN ON AND OFF SWITCH
BUT YOU COULD YOU COULD O YOU COULD TURN IT TURN IT ON BY TAKING THE TOP OFF THE BANANA MAYBE
WELL THAT'S THE THING AS HAVE WE DECIDED THAT WE CAN ONLY SPEND UH TWENTY FIVE EURO
WELL I F I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAN
THAN OUR CAN HANDLE BECAUSE IT'S DESIGNED FOR A COFFEE MACHINE YOU KNOW TO SAY HELLO IN THE MORNING
WELL THAT'S ITS CURRENT APPLICATION I WOULD PRESUME THAT IT'S KIND OF THEY WOULDN'T DESIGN IT TO HANDLE A HUNDRED THINGS TH SO
WELL I JUST I JUST MADE THE POINT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SPEECH RECOGNITION IS YOU KNOW
Y IN THAT CASE MAYBE THE MAYBE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THE SPEECH THING COULD BE USEFUL JUST TO SAY I'M HERE BUT UH IT'S PROBABLY A BIT OF OVERKILL IF YOU COULD JUST HAVE A A BEEPING
IT'S IT'S SPEECH SYNTHESIS AND S IT'S SPEECH KIND OF NOT REALLY SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT KIND OF PATTERN MATCHING YEAH YEAH
YOU RECKON YOU COULD LIKE DRAW US A THING ON THE ON THE WHITEBOARD 'CAUSE I'M NOT SURE
YOU HAVE THE OUTS THE WOOD ITSELF IS NOT GONNA BREAK SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THE CASE BEING BROKEN IT'S THE INSIDE
YEAH BUT INSIDE YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE YOU CAN STILL HAVE SOME KIND OF CUSHIONING THAT'S NOT VISIBLE TO THE TO THE USER
THAT'S TRUE BUT ARE WE SET ON THE BANANA
IDEA
AH YEAH IS IT WHAT'S IT IN FRENCH
SO IS THAT WHEN YOU SAY SPEAKER SUPPORT YOU MEAN IT JUST HAS SOME OUTPUT PINNED WHICH WHICH WHICH KIND OF
OKAY BUT THE SPEAKER IS ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO THE TO THE CHIP IN SOME WAY OR IS JUST THE THE SIGNAL
YEAH BUT THE SPEAKER IF THE SPEAKER IS ACTUALLY ON THE CHIP THEN IF IT'S TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE THE CASING
OR IF THE CASING IS TOO THICK THEN YOU MAY NOT HEAR THE THE SPEAKER
CAUSE THAT YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO COLLECT UM YOU KNOW THINGS THAT OF A SIMILAR TYPE
WELL YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED TO DO FRUIT IN THE FIRST PLACE
IT'S UM IT SEEMED LIKE IT FIRST SEEMS A BIT KIND OF UH NICHE
YOU KNOW RATHER THAN HAVING IT KIND OF YOU KNOW YELLOW AND REALLY LOOKING EXACTLY LIKE A BANANA YOU COULD MAKE IT KIND OF SILVER
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE THING IS IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO MAKE UM TO GIVE LIKE THE TEXTURE OF A BANANA ANYWAY AND TO K TO HAVE THE EXACT SHAPE
I GUESS YOU WANNA HOLD LIKE THE WAY THE END OF THE BANANA YOU WANNA KIND OF HOLD AS MA YOU MAYBE WANNA KINDA HOLD LIKE A GUN RATHER THAN 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT IT TO POINT KIND OF TOWARDS THE FLOOR
SO YEAH YOU NEED ONE ONE HERE AND ONE ON ON THE OTHER SIDE SO YOU GOT VOLUME AN AND CHANNEL
OH WE NEED A WE NEED A POWER UM ON OFF SWITCH AS WELL
Y I MEAN YOU NEED TO KIND OF KEEP IT UM
UH
THAT CAN BE THE T
OUR THIRD MEETING
WE DECIDED NOT TO GO FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE OF SOME REASONS AND WE ARE NOT DECIDED ABOUT U THE USE OF L. C. D. SCREEN ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE OF COSTS
SO MAYBE WE COU WI WILL BE ABLE TO CLARIFY THIS THIS QUESTION TO TODAY
APPLE FOR CHANNEL ONE
YEAH AND YOU YOU YOU WILL NOT HAVE PLA ENOUGH A LOT OF PLACE TO PUT A L. C. D. ON A BANANA ALSO
SO YOU YOU YOU SUGGEST TO GO F
S SO YOU'RE SIMPLY YOU'RE SIMPLY LOOKING S TO A REMOTE CONTROL THAT LOOKS LIKE A BANANA WITH FEW BUTTONS WITH ONLY A FEW BUTTONS
IS THIS A TECHNOLOGY THAT RECOGNIZE KEYWORDS SPEECH KEYWORDS
AND IT'S JUST TO IT'S JUST TO PLAYBACK SOMETHING
SO THIS IS NOT S REALLY TO DO TO TO DO CONTROL
SO IT IT'S C UH IT IT IT IS A UH UH EASY UH A FANCY THING THAT YOU YOU CAN BRING TO WE CAN BRING TO THE REMOTE CONTROL THAT WILL NOT HAVE ANY UH YEAH COMP COMPLETELY POINTLESS FOR THE INTER FOR FROM THE INTERACTION POINT OF V POINT OF VIEW
SO THIS IS SO THIS IS THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN TAK TAKING THIS TECHNOLOGY BRINGING IT TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AND USING IT
SO IF IF IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN WE CAN BRING EASILY AND TO PUT IT INTO THE BANANA REMOTE CONTROL
BUT YOU YOU CAN FIT I YOU'RE SAYING NOW YOU CAN FIT IT TO
NO WE CAN WE CAN'T USE THAT
WE CAN'T USE THAT TO
YOU WANT TO G TO MOVE TO YOUR SLIDES
MM BUT I BUT THERE IS NO ELASTICITY WHICH COULD BE
YEAH BUT IT'S MORE EASIER TO DO A BANANA IN PLASTIC THAN UH IN WOOD
UM UM UM YES I SEE
BUT UM THEY DO D
IT'S NOT RE IT YOU YOU THINK IT'S REALLY FANCY AND FUN
IT'S KIND IT'S KIND OF IT'S MORE UH IT'S REALLY ERGONOMIC IT'S FIT IN THE HAND AND YOU'VE A LOT OF SURFACE TO TO PUT THE CONTROLS
S OBJECTS
YOU S YOU YOU THING
WELL NO NOT NOT YOU YOU CAN FINISH YOUR SLIDES BEFORE
OKAY SO MM SO WELL DONE FOR THE PRESENTATIONS
SO WE NEED TO TAKE SOME DE DECISIONS ABOUT UM ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
UM THE SPEAKER UNIT UM WELL NOT IN ORDER NOT TO LOST THE UM THE DEVICE I DO I DON'T REMEMBER YOU CALL IT
SO TI TIME IS RUNNING WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO TO MOVE FORWARD
WE'LL HAVE A BASE STATION EXTRA UH ON THE SIDE
UH WE HAVE A R. F. FOR UM FOR BEEPING FOR BEEPING
SO WE THAT MEANS WE NEED A BUTTON ON TH ON THE ON THE BASIS
SO WE ARE GOING TO ADD UH ALSO UM YOU AS YOU SUGGESTED THE WHEE SOME WHEELS TO CONTROL THE VOLUMES AND CHANNELS AND YOUR TUR TURBO TURBO UH BUTTON
YEAH ON THE TH YEAH MAYBE HERE
AND THE AND THE WHEEL A A AT THE LEVEL OF THE THUMB FOR INSTANCE
SO NO L. C. D.
OH JUST THE SWITCH NO F NOT FOR THE T. V. FOR THE T. V.
ON THE SIDE
SO OKAY THE NEXT STEP YOU CAN COME BACK TO YOUR SEAT
THE NEXT STEP IS TO GO FOR TO F IS TO GO TO UH
IT'S NOT A POSSI IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT IT FOR THE NEXT PROTOTYPE SO T IT'S IN THE NEXT PROTOTYPE SO LET'S SKIP IT
YEAH MAYBE FOR THE N IF IF IF IT IT WORKS WELL WE'LL GO FOR UH AN ORANGE ONE
WE'LL SEE N NEXT MEETING
SPONGY MEANS IT IT'S LIKE SP
BUT WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION HOW WE CAN HAVE SOME SHAPE LIKE THAT ON THE REMOTE
SO FIRST THING IS WE NEED POWER SOURCE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
THEN UH WE NEED PLASTIC WITH SOME ELASTICITY SO THAT IF YOUR IF THE REMOTE CONTROL FALLS IT'S NOT BROKEN DIRECTLY INTO PIECES
THERE SHOULD BE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN T
DOUBLE CURVE IS YOU HAVE CURVES ON BOTH THE SIDES IF I'M RIGHT
SO IT COULD BE CURVE SO IT COULD BE CONVEX CONVE CONCAVE DEPENDING ON WHAT WHAT WE WANT
THESE ARE THE THREE THINGS AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT MATERIALS WITH PLASTIC YOU CAN HAVE DOUBLE CURVE BUT WITH UH CERTAIN OTHER MATERIALS WE CANNOT HAVE DOUBLE CURVE
SO THERE THERE WAS UH THERE WERE MANY OTHER MATERIALS LIKE WOOD TITANIUM AND ALL THOSE THINGS
BUT PLASTIC IS I THINK IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE ONE IT'LL BRING THE COST DOWN AND ANYWAY IT'S
IS IT AN E APPLE WHICH HAS
BANANA IS MORE HANDIER AS COMPARED TO THIS I THINK AND TO CAPSICUM
OKAY SO PUSH BUTTONS FOR THE TRADITIONAL USERS SO THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THEY ARE ALIENATED
JUST AND A SCROLL BUTTON WITH PUSH TECHNOLOGY FOR CHANNEL SELECTION VOLUME CONTROL AND TELETEXT BROWSING
THESE ARE THE THREE SCROLL BUTTONS WHICH ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE WITH US IN THE COMPANY AND WE WE CAN GO AHEAD WITH THAT
THEN UH THERE ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF CHIPS ONE ONE IS THE BASIC CHIP AND THE REGULAR CHIP AND ONE AN ADVA ADVANCED CHIP
PRICING IS A FACTOR FOR US THAT'S WHY WE'LL GO FOR THE REGULAR CHIP
YES YES THAT'S RIGHT IT'S IT'S ONTO THE CHIP MOST MOST PROBABLY NOT NOT HUNDRED PER CENT SURE ABOUT THAT
UH SO WE CAN HAVE IT AT ONE OF THE BOUNDARIES SO THAT THINGS ARE SLIGHTLY BETTER
AS OR AS HEARING IS CONCERNED WE CAN HAVE SOME GAP AT SOME PLACE SO THAT
AND UH AS WELL AS I COULD SEE ON THE WEB THE SCROLL BUTTON IS BECOMING REALLY UH HOT THING S AND WE SHOULD HAVE IT ON THE REMOTE
YOUR USUALLY YOUR REMOTE SITS ON THAT
SO YOU'RE HAVING THE BASIS STATION AND THERE IS A BUTTON IF YOU PRESS THAT BUTTON WHEREVER THE REMOTE IT'LL START BEEPING SO YOU KNOW WHERE THE REMOTE IS
UH
SO COMPONENT COST IS GOING TO BE THE LEAST
SO IT'S THE BASIC THING BUT VERY TRENDY AND VERY USER FRIENDLY
A YEAH OTHERWISE IT'LL BE MIS MEANS YOU DON'T GET B ANY FEELING THEN
IT'S NEITHER A BANANA NOR A
ANYWAY USERS'LL BE SO THE FINDINGS IS USERS'LL BE VERY INTERESTED IN OUR LOCATOR DEVICE TO FIND THEIR MISPLACED REMOTES
THERE'S LESS SPACE ON THIS TO PUT WITH THE BUTTONS
S NO THAT'LL BE CONTROLLED BY THE THOSE BUTTONS'LL BE THERE ALREADY YEAH
UH FORTY TH FOUR
UH
UH SO THE THE CURRENT INVESTIGATION TH UH TH UH SORRY THE CURRENT
THE N
WHAT I FOUND IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE FROM LESS TO MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT
THE CURRENT TREND WHICH WAS F THE FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL
MA MORE A COOLER ASPECT UH RATHER THAN A DEVICE WITH MANY FUNCTIONS AND MANY BUTTONS WITH INSTEAD OF I INSTEAD OF HA OF A DEVICE WHICH CAN DO MANY THINGS
A DEVICE WHICH IS PLEASANT TO TO WATCH TO SEE
WELL IN IN EURO IN IN PARIS AND AND MILAN THE IN PARIS AND IN PARIS AND MILAN THE THE CURRENT TREND OF UH OF CLOTHES
ALL THIS FASHION IT'S IT'S FRUIT AND THE THE THE THEME IS FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
AND ALSO IN THE IN THE U. S. A. THE THE CURRENT THE MOR THE MOST POPULAR FEELING IT'S IT'S A SPONGY
YEAH I I DIDN'T MISS AN I DIDN'T MISS AND I SAW THAT THE FRUIT THERE ARE MANY FR PICTURES OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THE CLOTHES
VEGETABLE TEXTURES AND ALL THIS KIND
UH YEAH YEAH
UH NO NO IT'S NOT
I HA I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF ANY PARTICULAR FRUIT BUT THE GENERAL ASPECT OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
MAY MAY COULD REMIND SOME KIND OF VEGETABLE SOME KIND OF
NOT TOO MUCH FOCU NOT N NOT TOO S NOT TOO SIMILAR TO A FRUIT BECAUSE NEXT YEAR THE TEN THE TREND THE TREND WILL BE DIFFERENT
SO WE SHOULDN'T BE AT RE REALLY ATTACHED
TO TO THE TREND BUT
AFRICAN OR AS AN ELEPHANT
WELL MA MAYBE WE WE SHOULD FURTHER SPECIFY WHAT TARGET ARE WE FOCUSING
TO BUY A A N A COOLER REMOTE CONTROL
UH
IS THE NEW TREND
OR M
WELL ACCORDING TO THE TO THE REPORT PEOPLE ARE MORE INTERESTED IN IN A FA FANCY LOOK AND FEEL AND IN A TECHNOLOGICAL INNO IN INNOVATION
SO I WILL GIVE MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE LOOK AND FEEL THAN RATHER THAN THE
NEW INPUTS AND ALSO IT'S I'M NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THIS L. C. D. BECAUSE YOU NEED UH INTERNET CONNECTION
YOU NEED MORE THINGS IT'S NOT JUST BUYING A NEW CONTROL RE REMOTE YOU NEED BUYING CONTROL REMOTE BUYING UH
M MANDO
IT CON IT CONTROLS THE SPEED
AH IT'S DESIGNED FOR A COF OKAY
IS IT DESIGN FOR A COFFEE MACHINE
AND YOU PUT IN THE SALAD
AND IT'S AL IT ALSO SUITS WITH THE DOUBLE CURVE FOR EASY OF
I'M SURE IT'S FUN
A POWER FR A POWER M A MANDO A SUPERMANDO FRUIT
I WO WHAT ABOUT ADDING THE THIS WORD SPOTTING KEYWORD SPOTTING RECOGNITION SAYING VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN
UH SCROLL WHEELS HERE WHICH YOU KNOW ONE ON THE THE LEFT FOR THE UH VOLUME AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT FOR FOR THE CHANNEL AND UH UNDERNEATH WE HAVE THE UH THE TURBO BUTTON WHICH IS IN LIKE A NICE UH TRIGGER POSITION FOR YOU KNOW FOR PRESSING QUITE NATURALLY
THIS IS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU UH ARE SCROLLING THE UH THROUGH THE CHANNELS YOU CAN TELL IT TO TO SKIP TH PAST CHANNELS THAT YOU QUICKLY RATHER TH
WELL WHEN YOU STOP SCROLLING THE WHEEL IT STOPS
BUT NORMALLY WITH UH IT WILL JUST UH S STAY ON EACH STATION BRIEFLY SO YOU CAN SEE THE THE PICTURE
THE S THE TURBO BUTTON
SO RATHER THAN HAVING UH AN EXTRA BUTTON FOR UM FOR THE ON OFF SWITCH YOU JUST USE THE TURBO BUTTON
SO ONCE YOU PRESS THAT THEN YOU GET TELETEXT AND YOU CAN USE THE THE CHANNEL SELECTOR SCROLL WHEEL AS UH
YOU PRESS THE THE THE TELETEXT BUTTON UH TO MOVE BETWEEN UH THE FIELDS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SCROLL THE NUMBER BACK AND FORTH SO YOU HAVE S YOU GO YOU SCROLL TO SEVEN AND THEN
WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN PRESS PRESS THE TELETEXT BUTTON AND THEN YOU THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN F
AND THIS IS THE UH THE INFRARED UH PORT
AND THEN WE HAVE IN THE UH IN THE BASE STATION WE HAVE THE THE BUTTON AT THE FRONT FOR UH FOR CALLING THE UH THE BANANA
THAT'S THAT'S YEAH THAT'S UH THAT'S FORM AND FUNCTION IN THE ONE IN THE ONE UH OBJECT
I THINK A CHILD WOULD TRY TO EAT IT ANYWAY SO MAYBE WE SHOULD
IF I WAS GONNA PLACE THEM I'D PUT THEM ON THE ON THE TOP HERE SINCE THAT'S LIKE UH THE BLACK BIT BUT YEAH I DON'T I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE THE SOLAR CELLS ANYMORE
THE WHAT SORRY
AH
AH
YEAH BUT Y PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO PUT IT BACK IN THE BASE STATION ALL THE TIME PEOPLE LEAVE WANNA LEAVE IT ON THE COUCH SO
AH OKAY
OR CAN MOVE BETWEEN POSITIONS IN THE IN THE NUMBER
UH
'CAUSE OF THE SCROLL WHEELS BUT MAYBE LOSES THE POINT FOR NOT HAVING YOU KNOW THE EXTRA BUTTONS WHEN YOU REALL IF YOU DO NEED THEM FOR SOME REASON BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS USE YOUR OTHER
WELL IT DEPENDS WHEN YOU SAY FUNCTIONAL DO YOU MEAN IT DOES WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO
OR D DOES WHAT IT DOES YOU KNOW CAN IT MAKE YOU COFFEE
JUST FOUR
S YEAH
'CAUSE IT'S FIVE FIVE SEVEN SEVEN SO
UH OKAY DEFINITELY EASY TO USE
UH
I DON'T WANT A BANANA ON MY LIVING ROOM TABLE A BANANA REMOTE
YEAH BUT IT SAYS I I WOULD BUY THIS SO
S S
I DON'T THINK I AT ANY STAGE IN MY LIFE I WOULD WANT A BANANA REMOTE CONTROL REALLY
IF I HAD T IF I HAD TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE EURO
AND IT YEAH THIS IS GONNA F YOU KNOW HANDY TO USE
ALTHOUGH IT STILL HAS IT STILL HAS THE WORD OF COURSE AT THE BEGINNING SO I DUNNO
I GIVE IT A FOUR NOW
IS THERE SOME SOME FORMULA YOU'RE USING THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO SUM THEM UP
WELL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT THEN
I THINK IT IT KIND OF YOU JUST LOSE INFORMATION IF YOU SUM IT SO
WELL ACTUALLY THAT THAT NO THAT SAMPLE SPEAKER IS NOT WE WE'RE NOT USING THAT
WE'RE JUST USING THE THE VERY BEEP SIMPLE BEEP THAT S THAT SAMPLE THING IS LIKE THE VOICE RECORDING AND EVERYTHING
WELL WAIT A SECOND NO IT'S IT'S DOUBLE CURVED IT'S GOT A C IT'S UH
ONE ON THIS SIDE ONE ON THAT SIDE BUT THEY'RE OPPOSITE SIDES
WELL WE WE'LL COME BACK WE'LL COME BACK AND SEE IF WE CAN FIT IT IN
THINK ABOUT IT MYSELF BUT I THOUGHT YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU COULD POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE PUSHING IT DOWN AS YOU SCROLL IT FOR A INSTEAD OF A TURBO BUTTON BUT YOU KNOW THE TURBO BUTTON DOES ADD THAT EXTRA CLASS
WE NEEDED SOME OF THESE KIND OF YOUNG TRENDSETTERS TO COME IN AND PLAY WITH THE BANANA AND YOU KNOW SEE IF THEY
SEE IF THEY LIKE IT
TO SEE YOU KNOW HOW TO HOW TO MARKET THIS THING
MIGHT HAVE TO DRAW A FACE ON IT
SO BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO TO WORK ON NEXT TIME IS REALLY FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT THE TARGET
OUR NEEDS ARE
I MEAN ALL WE HAVE IS TWO PUSH BUTTONS AND TWO SCROLLERS DO WE REALLY NEED AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT TO
AND ALSO FO YOU KNOW FOR MOOD LIGHTING AND AND STUFF THAT WOULD BE RATHER COOL
I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IN VERSION TWO
IS THE ABILITY TO YOU KNOW TO CONTROL THINGS OTHER THAN THE T. V. AND NOT JUST ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT BUT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT OF THE ROOM
UH UH JUST GOING TO GO QUICKLY THROUGH THE MINUTES OF THE LAST LAST UH MEETING THEN WE HAVE A P PRESENTATION OF PROTOTYPE OF YOU TWO SOUNDS INTERESTING
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH FINANCE EVALUATION OF THE OF THE COST OF THE THING AND UM HOPEFULLY UH WE SHOULD FIT THE TARGET O TW OF TWELVE POINT FIVE UH UH EURO
SO WE WENT THROUGH TH UH W WE TOOK THIS FOLLOWING DECISIONS
NO L. C. D. NO SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY OKAY WE WENT THROUGH A B TO A BANANA LOOK AND FEEL FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
WE WENT THROUGH THE USE OF WHEELS AND BUT BUTTONS
AND ALSO THE USE OF A BASIS STATION FOR BATTERY CH CHARGING AND UH ALSO TO UM CALL THE TO CALL THE MOT MOTE REMOTE CONTROL WHEN IT IS LOST
YEAH CAN YOU SHOW IT TO THE THE CAMERA MAYBE
WHAT'S THE USE UH OF THE T TURBO BUTTON ALREADY
AH YEAH YEAH AN THEN YOU STOP WHEN YOU STOP IT STOPS
TO NAVIGATE IT THROUGH TH THROUGH TELETEXT
WITH THE WHEEL IT'S EASY
AND THE THE LEAVES PLAYS THE ROLES OF OF ANTENNAS
AH YEAH
SO FOR THE POWER SOURCE APPARENTLY YOU STILL YOU YOU WANT TO USE BOTH SOLAR CELLS AND BATTERIES
UH I MEAN HOW LONG DOES I HOW HOW HOW LONG CAN IT BE HELD OFF A STATION
F WEEKS
THOSE REALLY SOUNDS VERY GOOD
SO YOUR SLIDES ARE READY
UH YOU'RE FOUR I THINK
SO THIS IS ONE WHICH ONE IS THIS ONE
S SEVEN
UH FOR A REMOTE CONTROL DOES HE HAVE ALL THE
SO S UH FOUR
CHEAP
SO THIS IS SELLING COSTS NOT PRODUCTION COSTS
AW SHOULD BE NICE IN YOUR
OKAY SO YOU S YOU GIVE OH YEAH YEAH I KNOW I KNOW
F I D I SAY FIVE
UH YEAH I THINK SO
W WE HAVE SIX FIVE
THREE SO WE ARE
SO AND LAST QUESTION WILL I CHANGE MY REM CHANGE MY REMOTE CONTROL FROM MANDO BANANA
SO ONE
TWO THREE FIVE TWO THREE FI AND TWO
SO IT'S R
NO NO YOU SAY FIVE HE IS THE OUTLIER
OKAY JUST JUST DO A SUM
SO MAYBE MAYBE W WE CAN WE SHOULD STICK TO GENERAL FEELING
SO I ALREADY UH PUT SOME PU SOME NUMBERS HERE OKAY
UH AND ALSO THINGS THAT I UH I D I FORGET TO UH TO PUT LIKE SOLAR CELLS
I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KINETIC AND DYNAMO
AH YOU HAVE TO AH OKAY I SEE SO KINETIC IS REALLY UH SHAKING THE BANANA
SO THOSE BANANA IS FALLING
YEAH SO ONE
OOH YE YE YE THE COST IS INCREASING
S
OH THERE IS NO LISTING FOR R RADIO FREQUENCY THING
OKAY SO IN FOR THE CASE UM
WHAT A WHAT I IF I PUT ONE HERE
YEAH SO LET'S PUT ONE HERE IN THE THEN INSTEAD OF SINGLE OKA ALL RIGHT
NO IT'S TOO NO
OKAY SO I PUT RUBBER ONE
NO IT'S NO CHIP
OKAY W WE DIDN'T THINK A THOUGHT ABOUT UH INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTONS
SO NO L. C. D.
SO FOR WE HAVE NO BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS RIGHT
UH
WELL IN FACT COULD WE COULD NOT WE CONSIDER THIS BUTTON AS A BUTTON SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE OH NO
SO MAYB IN FACT N WE HAVE TO PUT TWO HERE
WHA
SO WELL WE'RE UNDER THE THE THE COST
SO WE CAN GO TO THROUGH TO PROJECT EVALUATION
THIS IS WHAT WE WHICH YOU CAN MM
SHOULD IT BE MORE LIKE UM LIKE A STATUS OF
YEAH MAYBE WE SHOULD GO THROUGH YEAH AN UH EVALUATION
IN THE STREETS LIKE ASKING TO YOUNG PEOPLES WELL DO YOU LIKE TO HAVE A BANANA AS A REMOTE CONTROL
HOME
PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT TO TO MAKE A A REAL PROTOTYPE THAT WE CAN USE AT HOME TO TO EVALUATE
OH NUMBER TWO SORRY
YOU CAN PULL IT OUT FIRST MAYBE
UH
IF YOU TAKE THE BANANA AS SUCH AND UH YOU PRESS THE TURBO BUTTON SO IT SWITCH ONS THE SWITCH ONS THE T. V.
THEY ARE NO MORE FOR CHANNEL OR VOL VOLUME
AND WE HAVE PUT THESE DIFFERENT COLOURS SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T MISTAKE THEM MISTAKE IT AS A BANANA
OH WE DIDN'T THINK OF THAT YET
IT'LL IT'LL BE ALWAYS AT TOP SOMEWHERE AT THERE
N MOST NO MOST OF THE TIME IT'S NOT BEING USED
SO WHEN WHEN YOU ARE MAKING IT ON
PRICING IS WAS A FACTOR SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE GONE FOR A REGULAR CHIP ONLY NOT THE ADVANCED CHIP
SO THAT THIS BUTTON FO IS FOR TELETEXT WHICH IS USUALLY ALSO THE CASE
SO THERE WAS THERE WAS A CONSTRAINT THAT THE SURFACE AREA WHICH WE HAVE ON THIS BANANA ON ONE SIDE BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE
SEVEN BY ME
UH YEAH CRAZY
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS
AND THEY THEY MIGHT NOT BE A AS EASY AS THIS YEAH
S
SOLAR CELLS YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH WE SAID NO TO THAT
SO WE HAVE THE REGULAR CHIP ON THE PRINT WHICH IS ONE
AND WE HAVE SEV
OH IT'S GOT ALL THE DIRECTIONS SO DON'T WORRY
AH OKAY OKAY
SO FIRST THING WHICH WE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IS
SO MIGHT BE NINETY CENTIMES FOR THE THE REMAINING THINGS WHICH THE CORD AND EVERYTHING WHICH'LL GO
S
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST THE OPTIMAL WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR THE COST WHICH WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO
HOME
AH OKAY OKAY
IS IT REALLY WEIGHT
IS IT LIGHT OR
HOW LONG THE HOW LONG THE BIT THE BATTERIES LONG
YOU THE THE B THE BUTTONS CHANGE H H THEIR FUNCTION DEPENDING IF Y IT'S TELETEXT OR NOT
BECAUSE HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT CONFIGURATION AND ALL THIS KIND OF UH STUFF
W WE ARE LIVING IN A WONDERFUL WORLD
S
USERS MUST SAY I IF IT'S TRUE OR IS OR IF IT'S FALSE IN A IN A SCALE RANGING FROM ZERO TO SEVEN
AH YEAH
IS TOO SHORT AND NINE IS TOO LONG
THE VARIANCE IS MI IT'S IS MINIMAL
I THINK I SH I I COULD WRITE THE CRITERIA IN THE ON THE WHITEBOARD
EVERYTHING AR
ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE THE R THE REAL SPECIFICATION OF A OF A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTRO
AH IT'S NOT AN UNIVER BUT IT'S FOR ALL KIND OF T. V. S
SO FOUR
WOULD CHANGE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL FOR A N FOR A NEW ONE
ACTUALLY YEAH I WE
BECAUSE THE THE LAST TWO QUESTIONS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE REST ACTUALLY
UH NO I DIDN'T ANYTHING
S
FO I IT DOES NOTHING ACTUALLY
YEAH BECAUSE TH TH THE EVALUATION PROJECT
AH WOULD BUY YEAH
UH MY NAME'S BOB MOR
MAYBE PUT IT UP PUT IT A MAYBE PUT IT ON THE DESK OR SOMETHING
UH THAT'S BETTER
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY BUTTONS AND YOU KNOW IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE WHICH BUTTONS DO WHAT AND THE BUTTONS ARE VERY SMALL AND VERY HARD TO PRESS
UM AND AND NORMALLY YOU ONLY EVERY USE YOU KNOW ON A T. V. REMOTE YOU ONLY EVER USE
MOSTLY YOU KNOW F FOUR OR F SIX BUTTONS
SO IT'S FRUSTRATED ME IN THE PAST TH THAT
AH OKAY
OKAY N
IS THAT BECAUSE THE OF THE DISCRETE VOLUME LEVELS OR IS THAT
AND THEN LAST ONE'S MARKETING WHICH IS ME
UH I GUESS YOU ALL KNOW WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU ALL RECEIVED THE EMAIL I GUESS
SO UH SO TODAY WE ARE DOING A SHORT MEETING TO PRESENT THE PROJECT SO UM
IS TO DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
SO IT SHOULD BE OF COURSE NEW AND ORIGINAL AND UM IT SHOULD BE TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
UH
SO IT'S MORE LIKE WE ARE GOING TO DO INV INDIVIDUAL WORK ALL IN O IN O OUR SPECIALITIES AND WE ARE GOING TO MEET EACH OTHER QUITE OFTEN TO DISCUSS AND TO FIND A GOOD WAY
UM SO NOW WE ARE GOING TO TO GET USED T TO TO THE TOOLS WE ARE GOING TO USE ALL DURING ALL THIS PROJECT
FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN TRY TO WRITE WHAT IS OUR OUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND WRITE THE F OUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS ABOUT IT
UH
UH WE ARE GOING TO TO SELL WE WANT TO SELL UH THIS REMOTE CONTROL FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO EURO
UH
UM SO WE CAN START TODAY TO HAVE A FIRST IDEA OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO WHAT ARE OUR EXPERIMENTS WITH REMOTE CONTROL AND ANY IDEA
SO IF YOU HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE GOOD OR BAD WITH REMOTE CONTROLS YOU CAN SHARE IT AND SAY WHAT YOU F WHAT IS YOUR IDEA
ARE YOU NOT AFRAID THAT IF YOU TAKE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL YOU CAN MOVE THE SLIDE AND IT COULD THE THE VOLUME CAN GO UP VERY QUICKLY AND IT CAN
YEAH ALSO IF Y WHEN YOU TAKE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE ON THE TABLE
YOU TAKE IT AND YOU PUSH THE BUTTON AND EVERYTHING IS VERY LOUD AND
UH
READ ABOUT YEAH
INDUSTRY AND OH
YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO TO FIND THE USER REQUIREMENTS F UH FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE REMOTE CONTROL WORKING WITH INFRA RED RAYS YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD KEEP IT IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTION AND THEN TRY IT HARD TO TUNE
YOU CAN CALL ME PETRE OR PETER IF YOU LIKE
WELL SH SHOULD I DRAW THE PICTURE OF THE ANIMAL
I WOULD USE THE BIRD
SO I TRIED TO SKETCH IT OUT
I HAD TO FIRST UH WRITE IT DOWN BECAUSE I AM NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE IF I CAN DRAW IT BUT AH
CAN YOU RECOGNISE IT AS A BIRD
OKAY IT'S YOUR TURN TO
OH IT'S OKAY
OH JUST WAIT A LITTLE BIT
C COULD WE PUT IT HERE TO MAKE IT AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE
AH PROBABLY NOT
ARE YOU LEFT HANDED
AH IT'S MAYBE BETTER IF YOU LEAVE IT
IT'S IN IT'S INDEED BEAUTIFUL
Y OH OKAY
UH FIRST WOULD BE THAT IN CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS THERE IS NO BACK LIGHT
SO IF YOU ARE IF YOU ARE UH PLAYING WITH THIS IN THE DARK ROOM IT'S IT'S PROBABLY WORTH TO TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE UH BACK LIGHT
AND MAYBE IT COULD BE ALSO DEPENDANT ON THE THE AMOUNT OF OF LIGHT IN THE ROOM
YEAH BUT I CAN REACH IN UH ONE SECOND I CAN MUTE IT DOWN OR OR MAKE A HIGH VOLUME
AH N
YEAH F IT DEPENDS WHAT WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT
UH
OKAY SO BASICALLY I'M GONNA PRESENT SOME FINDINGS OF A STUDY WE CONDUCTED UH INTO UH WHAT USERS WANT IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL
UM SO FIRST OF ALL WE WHAT WE DID IS WE UM CONDUCTED A AN EXPERIMENT WITH A HUNDRED TEST SUBJECTS
UM WE PUT THEM IN A IN OUR UM USABILITY LABORATORY AND GOT THEM TO YOU KNOW UM PLAY WITH REMOTE CONTROLS AND ALSO TO COMPLETE
AFTER THEY'D DONE THAT TO COMPLETE A QUESTIONNAIRE UH TO TELL US WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE IN REMOTE CONTROLS
SO BASICALLY UM THE MAJOR THINGS WE FOUND OUT WAS THAT UM BASICALLY USERS DON'T LIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF OF MOST REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET
FOUND THAT REM REMOTE THE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT THEY'D USED IN THE PAST WERE UGLY
UM THEY THEY DIDN'T MATCH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER THAT IS YOU KNOW THE THE WAY USERS USE REMOTE CONTROLS WHEN THEY'RE WATCHING T. V.
UM THAT THE LAYOUT OF THE REMOTE CONTROLS DIDN'T MATCH THEY WAY THAT THEY USED IT
THIRDLY THEY SAY THAT W HALF OF THE USERS THAT WE UM TESTED SAID THAT THEY ONLY USED TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS THAT UH ARE ON REMOTE CONTROLS
THE CHANNEL BUTTONS THE CHANNEL SELECTION BUTTONS ARE THE MOST BY FAR THE MOST USED BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM AND YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE USED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES PER HOUR ON AVERAGE UM WHILE THE USER'S WATCHING T. V.
UM THE CLOSEST BUTTON THAT WAS USED WELL THE CL THE BUTTON THAT WAS USED THAT WAS CLOSEST TO THE CHANNEL BUTTON WAS THE TELETEXT BUTTON
AND BASICALLY THEY CAME THEY SAID THE CHANNEL VOLUME AND POWER BUTTONS HAD THE HIGHEST RELEVANCE TO USERS UM NOTE THAT ONLY POWER WAS VERY INFREQUENTLY USED
IT ONLY HAD A B A A FR USAGE FREQUENCY OF ABOUT ONE TIMES PER HOUR BUT USERS RANKED IT AS HAVING A VERY VERY HIGH RELEVANCE
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE USERS SAID THAT UH WHAT FRUSTRATES THEM IS LOSING THE REMOTE CONTROL UM SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND IT
THEY SOME USERS COMMENTED ON THE FACT THAT THE THE YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE TO HOLD AND PRESS BUTTONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL AR ARE BAD AND UM CAUSE U REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
WE ALSO ASKED SOME USERS ABOUT SOME SPECIFIC FEATURES THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE IN THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
IN PARTICULAR DO THEY WANT AN L. C. D. D DISPLAY AND SECONDLY DO THEY THINK SPEECH RECOGNITION UH IS A USEFUL FEATURE TO HAVE ON A REMOTE CONTROL
THEY WANT THESE FEATURES THEY WANT THESE HIGH TECHNOLOGY FEATURES
UM FOR INSTANCE NINETY ONE PERCENT OF PE OF PEOPLE AGED BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE SAID YES THEY WANT THESE FEATURES
WHEREAS UM THE THE TREND WAS AS USERS AS USERS UM BECAME OLDER AND OLDER UH THEY WERE LESS LIKELY TO WANT THESE SORT OF FEATURES IN A UM IN A REMOTE CONTROL
UM AND AS OUR COMPANY MOTTO IS PUTTING FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
ARE WE UM ARE WE PLANNING TO TAKE AN OFF THE SHELF AN O. E. M. COMPONENT FOR THE RADIO WAVE CIRCUIT
OKAY S
BECAUSE I MEAN ALL THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS ON THE MARKET HAVE INFRA RED SO PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING OTHER THAN INFRA RED
BUT I THINK BASED ON MY USABILITY STUDIES I TH I FEEL THAT USERS ARE PRIORITISE THE LOOK AND THE FEEL AND THE TRENDINESS ABOVE
SO I THINK WE'RE BETTER OFF SPENDING MONEY IN THE USABILITY PHASE
AH YEAH
OH I DON'T BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE WE'RE THE ONES
BUT THEN YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY TOO COMPLICATED AT THE SAME TIME
SO I THINK S THE SETTINGS WE TH WE ARE AGREEING ARE AGREED THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED
UH OKAY WHAT ELSE
I MEAN BASED ON OUR USABILITY STUDIES AGAIN UM PE UM PEOPLE SAID THAT THE POWER BUTTON WAS V A VERY RELEVANT BUTTON
B OKAY
I THINK WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON THE YOU KNOW THE MAJOR USAGE OF THE TH OF THE CONTROL WHICH IS YOU SIT DOWN
UM AND ALL THE OTHER F FUNCTIONALITY IS
I THINK IT SHOULD BE A BU
S
UH UM YOU KNOW SOME FUNC SOME FEATURES ON THE CONTROL TO DISPLAY A TIME OR T TO DISPLAY
BUT I DO USE THE I DO USE THE DISPLAY OF THE TIME QUITE OFTEN BUT
OKAY SO NO TIME BUTTON
UH
UH SO WE WILL SEE OUR THREE PRESENTATIONS
OH I DON'T THINK SO
OH MAYBE
OH YOU CAN PUT IT HERE
AH
WELL I OH
ON THE OTHER SIDE WE WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING NEW
WE WANT TO
TO HAVE SOMETHING NEW AND SO WE I THINK WE SHOULD STILL THINKING ABOUT IT
FIRST UM THEY SAY THAT'S UH ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT T TELETEXT
UH APPARENTLY IT BECOMES FROM ACCORDING TO THEM IT BECOMES OUT OF DATE
THEY SUGGEST THAT THAT WE SHOULD UH USE THE REMOTE CONTROL ONLY FOR T. V. NOT FOR D. V. D. AND OTHER DEVICES
IT'S THAT MEAN WE SHOULD USE THE COLOUR OF OUR COMPANY AND MAYBE PUT SOMEWHERE THE S THE SLOGAN OF THE COMPANY
SO WHEN PEOPLE SEE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL THEY SHOULD SAY OH IT'S FROM REAL REACTION AND HE S THEY SHOULD RECOGNISE THE COMPANY
SO NOW WE WE SHOULD TAKE THE DECISION WHAT WE ARE GOING TO WHAT FUNCTION WE WILL HAVE ON THIS UH ON THIS REMOTE CONTROL
UH
ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE MORE AND MORE CHANNELS AND IF YOU WANT TO PASS THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS TO GET THE CHANNEL YOU WANT IT'S
UH
UH
MAYBE OH I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU WANT TO SEE A MOVIE YOU CLICK ON THE MOVIE BUTTON SO YOU HAVE ALL THE MOVIE CHANNELS AND AFTER YOU'VE YOU PLUS PLUS PLUS
IT'S WE NEED IT ANYWAY
BECAUSE SETTINGS IF WE WANT TO DO SETTINGS WE NEED BUTTONS FOR THAT AND WE WANT LESS BUTTONS SO
OH THE
IN THE MENUS OF THE L. C. D. OR IN THE BACK OF THE REMOTE CONTROL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT SHOULD FIT IN THOSE SETTINGS FUNCTIONS
NO I THINK IT'S AFTER AFTER FIVE MINUTES OR SOMETHING A TIMER I I THINK NO
SO S YEAH
ON THE BACK OR
AH OH YEAH YEAH
YEAH WE HAVE STILL ONE OR TWO MINUTES TO TALK YEAH
IF WE IF WE ADD THE TIME WE HAVE TO HAVE MAYBE A BIGGER DISPLAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IS IT VERY USEFUL
I MEAN ARE USERS WANTS TO HAVE THE TIME ON THE ON THE REMOTE
IS IT USEFUL
SOMEBODY BOOKED THE MEETING ROOM JUST FOR AT ONE P. M. AND SO WE SHOULD LEAVE
UH
AND UH YOU WILL RECEIVE AS USUAL YOUR SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION AND SO ON
OH I'M SORRY
I WILL TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AND S OF SYSTEM AND HOW THEY REACT TOGETHER
SIMPLY IT'S A DEVICE AS YOU KNOW FOR UH
AND THE MAIN IDEA WE DON'T USE ANY CABLE AND WE CAN REC REACT SIMPLER WITH THE DEVICE
UH FIRST IS REMOTE CONTROL HAVE SH HA SHOULD HAVE SOME ELECTRIC CIRCUITS UH MAKING INTERFACE WITH UH KEYBOARD AND UH R READING UH KEYBOARD AND READING THE KEYBOARD UH COMMANDS
AND THEN INTER THEN MAKE UH THESE KEYBOARD COMMANDS UH IN INTERPRET THESE INT UH KEYBOARD COMMANDS
AND THEN THERE SHOULD BE UH AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT MAKING UH ELECTRONIC SIGNALS ACCORDING TO THESE COMMANDS AND UH FINALLY THERE IS A TRANSMITTER WHICH IS A CORD OR A A DIODE MAKING UH MAKING UH WAVES TO TRANSMIT THROUGH THE AIR AND UH UH THIS AIR THIS UH WAVE UH WILL BE RECEIVED BY THE BY THE OTHER DEVICE LIKE A TELEVISION OR WHATEVER
TO UH R TO REALISE THE COMMAND
OKAY UH ABOUT WHAT I FOUND ABOUT UH DIFFERENT UH THESE DIFFERENT BLOCKS ARE UH USUALLY THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT METHODS UH TO FOR DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL
THIS IS UH THIS CAN BE UH UH THE THE DIFFERENCES THE TH BETWEEN DIFFERENT KIND OF WAVES INFRA RED OR RADIO WAVES
AND UH ALSO AS UH I UNDERSTOOD AND UH I THINK IT WAS A PART OF UH BOB
WE SHOULD WE SHOULD TRY TO T TRY TO DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROL HAVING UH SOME SOME SIMPLER BUTTONS OR SOME ROLLING BUTTONS TO JUST TO JUST TO SEARCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT OPTIONS
AND SHOWING O SOMETHING ON T. V. AND PUTTING LESS LESSER STUFF ON THE UH ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
UH I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE UH WE CAN MAKE UH WE CA WE CAN MAKE THIS WAVE IN A SPECIFIC FREQUENCY
UH NO BUT AS I KNOW THERE IS A RANGE FOR UH FOR THIS UH F FOR FOR UH FOR THIS STUFF FOR DESIGNING THIS CIRCUIT
WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN TUNE OUR UH TRANSMITTER TO WORK IN THIS RANGE AND FOR THIS RANGE WE DON'T NEED TO ASK ANY PERMISSION
THE PASSWORD MAY SIMPLY UH OR UH I IDENTIFICATION CODE MAY SIMPLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
SO UH WE DON'T HAVE ANY UH WE DON'T HAVE UH WE SHOULD JUST DESIGN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WE SH WE DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO THE TO THE T. V. DESIGN OR WE CAN CHANGE SOME DESIGN
BECAUSE ONE SOLUTION FOR THIS UM UH UH CH CHANGING CHANNELS IS TO SEE A SUMMARY OF ALL CHANNELS
YEAH B NOT ON THE CONTROL ON THE SCREEN ON THE T. V. SCREEN
CLOCK OR
YOU'RE SCARING ME WITH L. C. D. MAN
AND SPEECH RECOGNITION IN REMOTE UNIT IT WILL BE VERY E EXPENSIVE
AT LEAST WE HAVE COUPLE OF MONTHS T TO WORK ON IT SO SO IT WILL BE CHEAPER FINALLY
YOU STILL WANT ME THE PRESENTATION
YEAH F UH I KNOW ABOUT THIS SINCE IT'S MY IT'S EXACTLY MY FIELD SO
SO SO IF TWO TWO DEVICES ARE TRYING TO GO TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE T. V. SET THEN THE THE THE ONE WHICH HAS THE MORE ENERGY IN THE WAVE IS CHOSEN
YEAH BUT WE WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK UH ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I THINK AS A FUNCTION DESIGNER THAT WE WILL USE THE ALREADY MADE UH CIRCUITS WHICH WE PROBABLY BU BUY
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THESE
UH
IN THIS COMPANY
BUT I TRIED TO
TRIED TO BREAK THROUGH THIS TOO I GUESS
AH
OH SO I WILL SPEAK ABOUT WORKING DESIGN
WHAT CIRCUITS TO USE AND STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE UH I DIDN'T WORK UH WITH THESE UH CIRCUITS SO FAR SO I HAVE TO LOOK WHAT WHAT IS A V A V AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET FOR FOR THE COMMUNICATION FOR THE I. R. CIRCUITS AND SO ON
SO I'M CURRENTLY LOOKING WHAT IS AVAILABLE ON THE WEB
SO WHICH CAN REPORT ON WHAT IS GOING ON THERE SO I WOULD BE GLAD IF YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT THEM
UH OKAY FINDINGS THAT'S THE POINT THAT I'M WORKING ON CURRENTLY BUT UH SO FAR I I WAS UH LOOKING WHAT WHAT ARE THE BLUE CIRCUIT
I KNOW THAT UH THE USER INTERFACE PEOPLE AND THESE SPEAK ABOUT RADIO FREQUENCY WAVES BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN UH YOU CAN MAKE THE T. V. DO WHAT YOU WANT EVEN IF YOU ARE IN THE BATHROOM OR SO ON
WHEN YOU ARE NOT CLOSE TO THE T. V. YOU PROBABLY WON'T NEED TO TO CHANGE THE PROGRAM AND SO ON AND SO I AM I AM VOTING FOR S TO STICK TO THE UM INFRA RED CONTROL INSTEAD OF R. W. BUT WE WILL DISCUSS IT LATER MAYBE
UH
COMPONENTS TO USE I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT I WILL USE FOR THE DESIGN OF THE CIRCUIT
THIS WE THIS WE BUY I THINK BECAUSE IT'S RATHER CHEAP NOWADAYS AND IT'S NOT WORTH TO CONSTRUCT OURSELVES
SO SPEECH RECOGNITION WELL L. C. D. IT'S OKAY BECAUSE IT'S COMMON NOWADAYS TO USE L. C. D. SO I AGREE ON USING ANY KIND OF L. C. D.
LESS BUTTONS GOOD FOR ME AS A AS A DESIGNER OF THE CIRCUIT
IT DEPENDS OF YOU IF IF THE M. E. OR U. I. D.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE NAMES I DON'T REALLY KNOW UH WANT TO HAVE IT LIKE IN METAL OR IN PLASTIC
OH THIS IS NOTHING
THIS IS JUST MY NOTES ON WHAT TO USE
BUT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW UH OF THE DESIGN AND PRICE I WOULD STICK TO I. R. S
BECAUSE BECAUSE THE THE RANGE WHERE YOU CAN USE IT IS FAIR
OTHERWISE I DON'T CARE WHAT I PUT THERE BECAUSE IT'S THE CHIP WHICH I BUY OR WHICH WE BUY
WELL THREE TO THREE TO FIVE
N NOT TEN TIMES BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT WHAT WE
TH THEY ARE USED TO USE IT WHEN THEY CAN SEE THE T. V. SO I DON'T KNOW
UH OKAY THAT'S IT FOR ME
UH JUST ONE NOTE TO THE CHAN CHANNEL CHANGING
OR USING THE NAMES AND THE KEYBOARD I DUNNO
OKAY SO S OH SORRY
SO IT REQUIRES THE USE OF L. C. D. PROBABLY TO TO TELL YOU
OKAY SO I'LL MAKE A NOTE ON L. C. D.
SO WE ARE STILL S SPEAKING ABOUT THE COMMON DEVICES OR WE ARE INVITING THE NEW ONE
ON THE SCREEN YOU MEAN
NOT ON THE CONTROL BUT ON THE SCREEN
WELL IT WI IT WILL BE STILL MORE EXPENSIVE BUT FOR THE L. C. D. AND THIS STUFF IS NO PROBLEM IN THE PRICE
LIKE MA
AH I DUNNO
UH
WE COULD MAKE IT LIKE A OPENING OPENING STYLE THAT IF YOU OPEN IT YOU ARE YOU JUST TURN ON THE T. V. AND IF YOU CLOSE IT IT WILL
BECAUSE WELL IT'S MAYBE QUESTION FOR YOU T
YEAH BUT SINCE WE HAVE THE L. C. D. WE DIDN'T NEED TOO MUCH BUTTON TOO MANY BUTTONS
WELL WHAT W WHAT WAS THE QUESTION
AND AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE WORTH TO TO SET THE TIMING ON THE REMOTE NO
BECAUSE IF IF THE T. V. TURNS ON ITSELF IT WELL YOU KNOW IF THE TIME THE TIMER SHOULD BE THERE
AH YEAH
YEAH BUT IT CAN BE ON THE DISPLAY IN IN A CORNER ALL THE TIME ON THE REMOTE
UM SO BASICALLY I JUST WANT TO PRESENTED TO YOU PRESENT TO YOU SOME RECENT RESULTS WE'VE HAD FROM UM LOOKING AT UH UM SOME REMOTE CONTROL MARKET RESEARCH AND SOME FASHION TRENDS AROUND THE WORLD
UM SO THIS IS T NUMBER TWO PRIORITY BUT IT'S TWO TIMES LESS IMPORTANT AS THE FANCY CRITERIA
UM AND THIRD THIRDLY THE EASINESS OF USE IS IS THE UM IS IS IMPORTANT AS WELL
BUT AGAIN TWO TIMES LESS IMPORTANT AS THE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVENESS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
FROM OUR F FASHION PEOPLE IN PARIS AND MILAN
UM SO HOPEFULLY OUR REMOTE CONTROL REFLECTS THAT S IN SOME WAY
UM SO IN CONCLUSION WE NEED A OUR REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY FANCY UM HAS LOTS OF TECHNOLOG TECH TECHNOLOGY IN IT
UM SOMEHOW WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE IT RELATED TO FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WITH A SPONGY FEEL
AND THAT IT'S EASY TO USE AND FROM OUR LAST MEETING OUR YOU KNOW FABIAN TOLD US THAT W YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IS THAT WE HAVE TO REFLECT THE LOOK AND FEEL OF OUR OF TH THE REAL REACTION COMPANY
SO UM FANCINESS FIRST AND THEN TWO TI YOU KNOW HALF AS IMPORTANT AS THAT IS TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY AND HALF IMPORTANT AS TECHNOLOGY IS EASY TO USE
CA
EVEN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SEVEN T SEVEN CENTIMETRES BY SEVEN CENTIMETRES IS STILL
IS IT CAN YOU HOLD THAT OR
SO IF WE USE S SOLAR CELLS UM WHERE IS THE SUN IF SOMEONE'S WATCHING T. V. INSIDE
COULD YOU RE COULD YOU REDESIGN YOUR BOARD
I MEAN WHAT OTHER WHAT OTHER FRUIT AND VEGETABLES DO YOU KNOW OF ANY ANY OTHER FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THAT ARE YELLOW
YOU KNOW TO MANIPULATE THAT TO HAV BE A COVER THAT YOU CAN PULL OFF AND
OR UH MA MAYBE A MAGNETIC
HELLO UH THIS MEETING WE ARE IT'S FO SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM THE GOAL OF THIS MEETING IS TO REACH A DECISION AT THE END ON THE CONCEPT AND I THINK THE LAST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT AN A LOT AND WE HAD A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING TO BE
BUT UH IN TH AT THE END OF THIS MEETING WE HAVE TO TO REACH A DECISION
WE WILL HAVE AGAIN THREE PRESENTATION FROM ALL OF YOU AND UH I HOPE IT WILL BE FAST BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE TIME TO
UH
THREE
FOR EXAMPLE PUT ELECTRONIC CARD ON A SPONGY THING I CAN I CAN IMAGINE IT COULD BE A PROBLEM
I DUNNO I DUN I DUN ONE EACH
A SM
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO DO SOME WORK TO FINALISE OUR IDEA AND TAKE DECISIONS
UH LIKE BUT USING HOW MANY BATTERIES FOR EXAMPLE
ARE ARE WHAT MAYBE WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE BATTERY
AT LEAST IT'S NEW AND MAYBE TECHNOLOGY NEW TECHNOLOGY
UH WHAT WHAT ARE GONNA BE THE SIZE BECAUSE ITS WEIGHT DRIVES THE OTHER WHAT WE ARE GOING TO USE AS FEATURES AND SO ON
I'VE I S I THINK THE EASIEST THING WOULD BE TO TO HAVE A SMALLER L. C. D. IF IT'S POSSIBLE
THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A LIMIT IN A MONTH OF TIME SO WE CANNOT DO SOMETHING VERY NEW
SO FIVE BY S TEN
UM SO WHAT ABOUT SO THE CASE WE TALKED ABOUT
UM SOMETHING EASY TO USE YOU SAID SOMETHING EASY TO USE BUT HOW DOES THAT FIT IN A FASHION WAY LIKE WITH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE
AND ABOUT THE COLOUR AND LOGO OF THE OF THE COMPANY AND SO ON NOW CAN WE DO THAT
OUR COLOUR IS MORE YELLOW AND THE IT SHOULD BE EASY TO TAKE IN A HAND
I DUNNO WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT BUT
YEAH IT SHOULD REMEMBER BANANA BUT IT'S NOT DOESN'T HAVE TO B TO BE UH UH REALLY THE SIZE AND EXACTLY THE SHAPE OF A BANANA
SO IS IT IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO THAT
IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA BUT IS IT POSSIBLE TECHNICALLY
YEAH BUT DO YOU SEE THAT AS A
LIKE THIS AND TO OPEN IT WE HAVE TO ATTACH IT SOMEWHERE I DUNNO HOW TO DO THAT TECHNICALLY OR
MA MAGNETIC OH
LIKES
AND SOMETHING WE FORGOT MAYBE UH ABOUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM ARE WE GOING TO USE IT OR NOT
SO WE HAVE THE DE DESIGN THE A GOOD SHAPE NEW AND SO ON AND WE HAVE ALSO THE TECHNOLOGY THING W WILL BE
AND EVEN THE EASY TO USE THING SO IT WILL BE PERFECT
SO WE ADD ALSO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION DEVICE
AND THINK WE ARE ON A GOOD WAY
UM SO UH THE THE INDUSTRIAL MANAGER UH WILL UH WILL WORK ON THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN
THE USER INTERFACE UH UH MANA UH MANAGER WILL WORK ON THE USER INTERFACE DEVICE
UH I THINK YOU SHOULD WORK TOGETHER S YOU UH HAMED AND PETER TO WORK UH IN A IN A FIRST PROTOTYPE AND UH
SO THANK YOU ALL EVERYBODY AND SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
I S
THREE
UH N N NO IT'S THE FIRST ONE
UH YEAH
AND UH S UH I CAN CONCLUDE LIKE THIS THAT WE SHOULDN'T NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT
IT SHOULD BE WE SHOULDN'T NEED TO ES OPEN A A T BOOK AND UH START READING AND UH LEARNING HOW TO USE THIS UH THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL
SO WHAT I FOUND OUT THAT UH AS I SAID UH I THINK IT'S BETTER TO PUT UH MORE FREQUENT UH UH UH KE UH BUTTONS WHICH ARE USED MORE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND UH ALSO F UH UH M BECAUSE BECAUSE CUSTOMERS DOESN'T LIKE TO BUY LOTS OF BATTERY IT SHOULD NOT UH CONSUME LOTS OF ENERGY
AND MY PERSONAL P UH PREFERENCE IS UH AS I SAID
UH JUST PUTTING THIS BUTTONS IN A SPECIAL PLACES AND COVERED SOME BUTTONS WHICH ARE NOT USED UH THAT MUCH LIKE SETTINGS BUTTON LIKE MOBILE PHONE
AND JUST PUT UH VOLUME CHANGE OR S CH CAN UH CHANNEL CHANGE BUTTONS UH UH IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND IF THE USER NEEDED TO DO SOME MORE COMPLEX TASK UH HE HE CAN OPEN THE COVER AND THEN CHANGE SETTINGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
UH
NOT ON REMOTE CONTROL
BUT IF WE DO IT IN SOME WAY THAT IT ASLEEPS WHEN THERE IS NO SOUND AND WHEN IT DETECTS SOME SOUND IT MAY CONSUME LESS ENERGY
SO IT MAY NOT BE VERY USEFUL BUT BECAUSE IT'S NEW PEOPLE MAY BUY IT
UH
I THINK I THINK THEIR BEING UH LARGE OR SMALL IS NOT IMPORTANT
AND I PREFER TO IS IT SHOULDN'T HAVE A UNIFORM SHAPE SO IN THE MIDDLE IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT THINNER MAYBE MAYBE
UH
SOMETHING LIKE A PLASTIC COVER COVERING UH SOME INTERFACE U. S. B. INTERFACE AS IN THE IN UH DIGITAL CAMERA
IF YOU SEE IT'S LIKE PEELING
YOU OPEN A PLASTIC COVER AND YOU SEE SOME U. S. B. INTERFACES SOME SOME INTERFACES FOR ADAPTOR
YEAH OR A YEAH IT CAN IS IT CAN BE A PLASTIC COVER UH STICKING TO THE TO THE ALL THE STUFF LIKE UH WITH MAGNETIC P UH MAGNETIC UH MAGNETIC UH MATERIALS IN THE BORDER
UH OKAY SO GOOD NEWS FROM ME UH UH FOR ME FROM HAMED BUT BAD NEWS FROM BOB OBVIOUSLY
BECAUSE SPONGY DESIGN I DON'T LIKE IT AS OKAY SO COULD YOU PLEASE FABIEN OPEN IT
I MOST OF THE THINGS I HAVE TO WRITE MYSELF ON THE BOARD BUT YEAH THAT'S IT
THAT OUR COMPANY UH DEVELOPED A S A SEVEN F SEVEN FINGERS OR I'LL JUST YEAH
THIS IS THIS IS THE STUFF THAT I CAN USE TO OKAY
SO THE THIS WILL BE LIKE THE OVERALL SCHEME OR OVERALL REQUIREMENTS FROM THE ENGINEERING POINT OF VIEW
WE MUST USE ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF ENERGY WHICH I FOUND THE BEST IS TO USE THE SOLAR CELLS WHICH CAN WHICH CAN UH SUPPLY EVERYTHING
I WAS COMPUTING ALL THE ALL THE THINGS RELATED TO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND IT'S OKAY TO USE JUST UH TWO BATTERIES AND SOLAR CELLS SO
UM IT'S JUST ONE CORD FROM FROM THE MAIN BOARD TO THE SCREEN WHICH CAN BE ELSEWHERE
AND ON THE MAIN BOARD WE HAVE THE UM INTERFACE TO THE MICROPHONE WHICH IS SOMEWHERE
THEN THE GRAPHICAL CARD UH FOR THE T. F. T. AND THE THIRD UNIT IS THE I. R.
INCLUDING ALL THE STUFF INSIDE SO IT WILL BE VERY CHEAP FOR US
UH FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ABOUT THE MATERIAL USED FOR THE OVERALL DES UH OV ALL THE DEVICE
A ALL THESE THINGS IN IN UH IN THIS BOX ARE OKAY TO PUT IN IN ANY SHAPE BASICALLY
A YEAH THAT'S ALL FROM ME
BUT I I THINK WE CAN WE CAN CUT IT
AH WELL THIS IS LIKE THIS IS ALMOST NOTHING
SEVEN TO SEVEN TO AT LEAST WELL SOME THREE MILLIMETRES OR SOMETHING
BECAUSE IF IT'S T TOO SMALL WE CAN WE CAN LOSE IT AT HOME YOU KNOW
I IF THE ROLLER BUTTONS ARE ON THE SIDE YOU DON'T HAVE TO CATCH IT LIKE THAT BUT JUST LIKE THIS AND YOU KNOW FOLLOW FOLLOW WELL
J UH JUST A POINT TO THE ENERGY TH THINGS
IF WE USE THE BATTERIES AND THE ADDITIONAL SO SOLAR CELL
THEN IT'S OKAY FOR L. UH SPEECH RECOGNITION AND L. C. D. SO NO PROBLEM IN ENERGY I THINK
S
UH D DOESN'T NEED TO BE SUN
YEAH WELL I I SUPPOSE THAT I SUPPOSE THAT UH THAT THIS REMOTE CONTROL WON'T BE IN THE IN THE ROOM LIKE THIS
AH IT'S A IT'S A COMPROMISE NO
UH THE S THE SCREEN IS OKAY BUT THE BOARD UH THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WELL WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU GUESS AS A SHAPE
YEAH I THINK IT'S FEASIB WELL ONE UM UM HOW COULD WE DO IT
UNDER THE L. C. D. AND FOR EXAMPLE MAKE THE L. C. D. BE TOTALLY UNRELATED TO THE THING THAT YOU HOLD IN YOUR HAND
WELL BUT MAYBE LET'S STICK TO THE S SPONGY THING LIKE ONE UNIT
WELL FI FIVE TO TEN IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE
YEAH SO SO JUST JUST GIVE ME THE THE THE FIVE BY TEN NUMBERS THAT YOU FIND THE BEST AND SEND IT ME AND I WILL WORK IT OUT
IF IT'S IF IT IF THE BANANA IS BIG ENOUGH
BUT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN NO
BUT IF IT'S SQUARE THEN WE GET FOUR SCREENS OUT OF ONE BY CUTTING JUST
BUT IF YOU WANT SOME SHAPE THEN WE CAN ONLY GET LIKE TWO SCREENS OUT OF SEVEN TO SEVEN INCHES SO
LIKE LIKE PEELING OF THE BANANA YOU S
WELL IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT SOFT
HONESTLY SPEAKING I CANNOT IMAGINE IT SO FAR BUT IT WILL BE TERRIBLE
KEPT IN THE SHAPE WE CANNOT B UH SO WE NEED THAT THE THAT THE PEELING
UH
I DUNNO HOW TO HOW TO DO IT IF IF T IF TO IF IT'S BETTER TO PUT THE SOLAR CELL TO THE T TO THE PEELING OR OUTSIDE IT
I'M FIRST GOING TO DO AN OPENING THEN WE GET USED TO ONE ANOTHERS AND WE SPEAK ABOUT THIS TOOL WE'RE GOING TO DESIGN AND TRY TO MAKE A PROJECT PLAN
UM I THINK THE IMPORTANT POINTS WE HAVE TO T TALK ABOUT ARE UH IT'S FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IT'S CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DESAIL DETAILED DESIGN
IS THAT A WORM
UH YEAH CHRISTA PAVLOV MM
YEAH MM THAT'S THE PRICE WE WANT TO THAT'S THE AIM FOR THE PRICE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
'CAUSE THEY EAT SHE ATE IT
NO UH NOT TOO MUCH BUTTONS OR MM
THAN BIGGER
SO SOME KIND OF IDEA UH WITH UM UM CELLULAR PHONE WITH A A SCREEN THAT WILL TELL YOU WHAT NO
THREE OPTION
IF IT IF WE WANT A R UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL THAT WE SA LIKE WE SAY BEFORE IT MAY
MAY NEED MORE THAN THREE MM THREE BUTTON THREE MM POSSIBILITIES YE YEAH
I CHANGE CHANNEL LIKE THIS M UH I WANT TO GO TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN TO TEN UH-HUH MM YEAH
UH THE ONES MAKE UM TO DECIDE WHAT WHAT ARE THE ONES IMPORTANT AND WHAT ARE THE ONE THAT WE DON'T WANT
AND UM M MAYBE MORE IN THE TECHNICAL PARTS WHAT UH DO WE WANT TO DO
SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
UH
A WHAT
A R A RABBIT OH OH YEAH WHERE IS THE CARROT
I AM NOT VERY GOOD AT UH THIS KIND OF STUFF
AH A KIND OF UH SNAKE
NOT ME
UH YES WE HAVE PLENTY AT HOME
TO EAT
YEAH MAINLY AND TO BREAK
YE YE YEAH
OH LIKE THE PHONES YEAH IT COULD CHANGE COLOURS YEAH
SHOULD IT BE
Y YOU KNOW THESE UH REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE UM THEY ARE WHAT THEY CALL A UNIVERSAL RET REMOTE CONTROL SO Y YOU CAN DECIDE THAT NOW IT'S THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR THE TELEVISION
I THINK ONE THING IMPORTANT FOR INSTANCE IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN PEOPLE USE IT THEY'RE THEY NEVER FIND A GOOD BUTTON IN THE RIGHT PLACE
AH
I THOUGHT IT COULD BE ONLY A SCREEN WHICH WOULD CHANGE DEPENDING ON UH UH THE USE OR EVEN THE USER
SO MA I PREFER TO HAVE THE OFF BUTTON AT THE TOP RIGHT
SO I WOULD HAVE MY OWN DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S IN FACT JUST A A FULL TOUCH SCREEN REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU IF YOU LIKE
AH
YEAH MORE THAN THREE ACTIONS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DO AT A GIVEN TIME
UH NO
BECAUSE I'M ONLY USING THREE OR FOUR CHANNELS BUT
UH UH WE HAD THAT IN IN OTHER COUNTRIES
YEAH E EVEN THE HISTORY SO YOU COULD LIKE UH UNDO PREVIOUS OF THE PREVIOUS
THEN YOU CAN WATCH WHAT YOUR AH YOU COULD ALSO RECORD YOUR RECORD YOUR SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS
THAT BECOMES MORE COMPLEX BUT YOU COULD LOOK AT WHAT UH THE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE USED THERE OR REMOTE CONTROLS
M. E. THE USER REQUIREMENTS
UH THAT'S ME
OH OF COURSE YEAH THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS UH-HUH YEAH
IT'S CO C QUITE RECOGNISABLE
ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET
TO EAT
BUT HOW GONNA OKAY JUST UH BUT IT'S UH MONOCHROME IT'S N IT'S NOT LIKE
OTHERWISE YOU WILL NEVER FIND IT
CH
AND N MAYBE NOT TOO EXPENSIVE WELL IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM BUT WELL OKAY
ALRIGHT GOOD SO HOW MANY ACTIONS DO WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT IN IT
I ONCE HAD IT
YOU WA
IS THE WHITE OKAY
CHRIS
YEAH PRET
AH
YEAH EVEN WE CAN CHANGE COLOURS NO
UH
YEAH YEAH AT LEAST IT SHOULD HOLD IN YOUR HAND N PROPERLY LIKE
UH MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE THE COLOURS THAT AT LEAST THE FRAME
S SO THEN IT DEPENDS YOU ARE TO
MM I MEAN YOU C YOU CAN EASILY REMOVE THE FRAME
YE YEAH
PEOPLE ARE RIGHT HANDED OR LEFT HANDED SO Y BECAUSE I AM LEFT HANDED I USE LIKE THIS
SAY IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED YOU USE LIKE THIS OR SO THA YOUR SWITCH ON AND OFF SHOULD BE ON YEAH
MAYBE I THINK EVEN WE CAN KEEP TWO SWITCHES AND THEN WE CAN UH ONLY MAKE ONE WORKING
WE CAN ADAPT ONLY ONE SWITCH SUPPOSE HERE LIKE WE CAN MAKE TWO SWITCHES AND IF I'M LEFT HANDER I USE THIS SWITCH TO FOLLOW THE MAIN OPERATIONS
BUT THEY KEEP GENERALLY THEIR T SLASH SLASH UH THIS THING AND THEN THE DASH DASH AND THEN YOU CAN PUT YEAH YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE BIT
UH OKAY
OH UH
UH
UM SO I WILL TAKE THE MINUTES YOU MM YOU THREE ARE GOING TO DO PRESENTATION
UM UH WE WANT TO KNOW TO AT THE END TO KNOW THE NEW PROJECT'S REQUIREMENT SO WE NEED UH TO KNOW THE THE USER UH NEEDS THAT WE WANT TO FULFIL TO FULFIL THE FROM THE TECHNICAL PART WE WANT TO KNOW HOW IT GOING TO WORK AND UM
AH OF COURSE HOW TO TO DESIGN THIS UH THIS YEAH
OKAY UH THA THAT'S LOOK GREAT
SO UM NOW I THINK IT'S THE TURN OF THE
OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION SO
UH
IT'S ON
S
SINCE WE WERE TARGETING A REALLY SOON UH UH DATE FOR THE THE THE UM I ISSUING OF THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL I THINK WE WILL ONLY CONCENTRATE ON T. V. FOR THE MOMENT AND THEN MAYBE M MAKE IT MORE GENERALISED YEAH
UH YOU'RE FINISH
AND FROM FROM THE DISCUSSION WE HAD DO YOU CAN YOU MAKE IT ON THE WHITEBOARD OR MM
ON
UH TRAIN IT OKAY
NO IN NO NOT ONLY SPEECH YEAH
SHO TO TO TRAIN OKAY
AND WELL WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA OF AUTOMATIC ON OFF ON THE BUTTON YEAH
UH
MM I THINK OKAY WE'RE JUST ON TIME
WE WILL UH MEET AGAIN FOR THE NEXT MEETING AND UH IN THIS ONE WANT TO
TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS THE UM ON THE COMPONENTS SO
UH
UH OF COURSE THE U. I. D. MARK WILL BE UH FOCUSED ON THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT AND UH OUR M MARKET EXPERT SAMMY BENJO UH ON THE TREND WATCHING
AND WE HAVE UM MAYBE WE HAVE TO WE SAY ONLY FOR T. V. NOT TELETEXT
UH YEAH THAT'S
MM-HMM SO LET'S TO THINK S SO THAT YEAH
HA
SO AS YOU KNOW YOU I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW ME SAMMY BENJO
I AM THE EXPERT IN MARKETING AND I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE UH S WANT AND UH LIKE AND DISLIKE IN REMOTE CONTROLS
UH OH
WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE AND UM AND WHAT THEY DO WITH THEM BY THE WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE USEFUL
SO WE'VE WE'VE CONDUCTED A A SURVEY ON ON THE USE OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE RESULTS WE FOUND ON THIS SURVEY
YEAH SO BASICALLY WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT UH THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT THE USER DON'T LIKE IN REMOTE CONTROLS
SO I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY SPEND LOTS OF TIME IN AND EFFORT IN THAT UM
AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT UH THE THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE NOT SO EASY TO USE AND IT IT THE THE CURRENT UH FACILITIES THAT THEY OFFER DO NOT MATCH WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO USE THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS
FOR INSTANCE UH WE SEE THAT UH THEY ZAP VERY OFTEN SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY UH IMPORTANT UH FUNCTIONALITY THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY FOR THEM TO TO ZAP UH IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
AND MOST OF THE BUTTONS UH ON UH CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE NOT USED
SO I THINK WE SHOULD DESIGN SOMETHING WHERE SOME OF THE BUTTONS WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE USED SHOULD BE EASIER TO SEE AND USE THAN OTHERS THAT ONLY A COUPLE OF PEOPLE ARE USING
NOW PEOPLE ARE VERY FRUSTRATED W WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS AND THEY FOR INSTANCE UH THEY DON'T EVEN FIND IT IT'S IT'S OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE IN THE IN YOUR HOME AND NOBODY KNOWS WHERE IT IS
LIKE UH SOMETHING TO TO LIKE T I THINK PHONES
SOME OF THE PHONES HAVE SOME OF THIS KIND OF S FUNCTIONALITY
AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY BUTTONS IN THESE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT NOBODY USE IN FACT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE THEM
SO MOST OF THE THE PEOPLE SAY THEY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO THEY TO USE PROPERLY THEIR R REMOTE CONTROLS
OH OKAY I THINK IT'S A TECHNICAL THING WHICH OUR
AH YEAH
S UH FUNCTIONS THAT MAY BE UH USED BY U THE USER IN THE CURRENT UH AVAILABLE UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND UH WELL THE TABLES LOOK VERY NICE TO READ BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE POWER BUTTON IS NOT USED OFTEN BECAUSE IN GENERAL YOU USE IT ONLY ONCE PER SESSION
AH NOW I REMEMBER WHAT IS R. S. I. IT'S REPETITIVITY STRESS INJURY
VOLUME IS NOT OFTEN USED BUT PEOPLE UH WANT TO HAVE CONTROL ON VOLUME AND THAT MAKES SENSE OF COURSE
AND N THEN YOU HAVE THINGS WHICH ARE VERY MUCH LESS OFTEN USED LIKE THE SETTINGS
THEY'RE NOT OFTEN USED AND THEY ARE S MORE OR LESS RELEVANT
WHICH IS NOT AS UH THESE THESE TWO ONE WERE HAD I THINK TEN I THINK
ONE OF THE THING THE TREND UH THAT UH YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE OF IS THE POSSIBILITY THE EVENTUAL POSSIBILITY OF HAVING SPEECH RECOGNITION IN YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO TAP TAP IN YOUR BUTTONS BUT JUST TELL YOUR REMOTE CONTROL OR WHATEVER YOU NEED YOU HAVE WHAT YOU WANT
SO WE'VE CONDUCTED A SURVEY ABOUT UH WHETHER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE OR NOT TO HAVE UH THIS KIND OF UH FUNCTIONALITY IN THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AND AS WE CAN SEE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE AGE
AND UH AS THE AGE GOES UP THE THE RELEVANCE GOES DOWN
SO NOW IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF UH TARGETING UH WHA WHO ARE WE TARGETING WITH THIS REMOTE CONTROL
I THINK IF WE ARE TARGETING YOUNG PEOPLE THEN UH IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CONSIDER
I AM
BUT UH I THINK THEY ARE THEY ARE THOSE UH WHO MIGHT BE MORE INTERESTED IN A IN A NEW DEVICE
BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE OTHER MEANS OF FINDING THEIR INFORMATION
OH SO YOU HAVE A
SENSING SENSOR MACHINE THAT UH KNOWS
TECH
ACCORDING TO YOUR DISTANCE TO AND THE ANGLE MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A STEREO SYSTEM
SO IT GIVES INSTRUCTIONS BUT UH IT HAS TO BE WITH AN BACK LIGHT SOMEHOW
SO FOR INSTANCE IF I WANT TO GO TO DIRECTLY TO CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE HOW WOULD I DO CAN I DO THAT WITH THIS
YEAH MM LET'S SAY I AM UH ON CHANNEL EIGHT NOW
IN FACT IN IN ONE UH REMOTE CONTROL THAT I'VE SEEN INSTEAD OF DOING THAT D YOU COULD JUST SAY THESE ARE THE CHA CH CHANNEL THREE
TWENTY EIGHT FORTY EIGHT AND UH SIXTY FOUR ARE THOSE THAT I WANT TO BY CYCLED WITH MY NEXT BUTTON
ONE THING IS THAT AS I SAID IN MY PRESENTATION PEOPLE REALLY DO LIKE TO Z ZAP
AND HA HA YOU CANNOT USE MY REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S TARGETED TO ME
CHEAP
CHEAP
THE USER UH WILL JUST BE ABLE TO SAY UH PLEASE CAN YOU UH PUMP UP THE VO PUMP UP THE VOLUME OR OR IT WILL BE SOMETHING LIKE VOLUME
UH
OR A CLAP
YOU CAN CLAP
CLAP IS GOOD
TAK
EVERY FOUR SOME OF US KNOWS
I GOT ONE QUESTION UH YOU ARE A MARKET EXPERT SO SHOULD WE AIM AT THE YOUNG PEOPLE OR NOT
THAT'S BUT THIS BUT NUMBER THREE YES
UH AS I'M A MORE AN ARTIST THAT'S GONNA BE LESS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS BUT MORE USER INTERFACE AND CURRENT INTENTIONS AND EVERYTHING WHICH IS LINKED WITH THIS
EASIER DEVICE LIKE AIR CONDITIONING OR SOMETHING
OUR QUESTION OF THE STYLE WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT OUR COMPANY
FOR PERSONAL PREFERENCES I THINK THAT TO MAKE A BABY PROOF REMOTE CONTROL IT GOT TO BE A TITANIUM
IT'S A REALLY GOOD STYLE IT GOING TO BE LOOK LIKE LIKE THIS
W WE'LL HAVE A SCREEN WITH A BACK LIGHT WHICH CAN CHANGE COLOURS
AND ALL THESE BUTTONS SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND AND TO CLICK 'CAUSE WHEN YOU WATCH A MOVIE AND YOU WANT TO CHANGE SOMETHING
WHEN YOU GO TO THE SOFA TAKE YOUR CONTROL AND POINT IT TO THE T. V.
FOR FOR ENOUGH TIME LIKE UH YOU
IT'S A QUESTION TO OUR TECHNICAL DESIGN OUR TWO ENGINEERS
AND ANOTHER NICE FEATURE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT IS UH VOLUME CONTROL
SUPPOSE YOU SET U YOU SET UP SOME VOLUME AND THEN YOU MOVE OUT OR YOU MOVE TO THE OTHER CORNER OF THE ROOM AND TAKE YOUR CONTROL WITH YOU
AND EACH CAN IT CAN RESPOND FOR YOUR VOICE LIKE IT CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT FOR YOU JUST TO F FIND IT EASILY YEAH
YOU GOT SIMPLE DESIGNS Y WE SHOULD PUT IT TO SIMPLE ACTIONS
WE CAN JUST EXTEND IT TO ANY DEVICE
BASICALLY YOU USE JUST FOUR OR FIVE CHANNELS RIGHT
SO UH SET UP YOUR T. V. SET LIKE CHANNELS THAT YOU USE THEY'RE ONE
COULD WE CARRY OUT SOME RESEARCH IF WE W REALLY NEED THIS
'CAUSE NOW I SEE TH THIS THE PICTURE IN FRONT OF MY EYES LIKE A USER TAKING HIS REMOTE CONTROL AND SHOUTING INTO IT
UH SHOULD IT BE EQUIPPED WITH THE
LIKE YOU WANT TO FIND IT YOU SHOUT
CONTROL AND IT ANSWERS IS I'M HERE
YEAH I GOT IT AT MY HOME LIKE
UH
UH
UH
I HAVE TO DO WORKING DESIGN SO UH
MAYBE IT CAN BE YEAH MIDDLE OF LIKE BETWEEN THOSE TWO LI
S YOU SHOULD YEAH
BUT EVEN WE CAN HAVE SOME UH L. C. D. DISPLAY LIKE YOU CAN UH DE YOU CAN JUST BUTTON THE NUMBER AND THEN IT GO T BECAUSE
YEAH BUT SINCE WE ARE FOCUSING ONLY ON T. V. REMOTE CONTROLS SO WE CAN HAVE MORE FUNCTIONS FOR T. V. UH IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR A UNIVERSAL THEN WE OUGHT TO LIMIT FOR FUNCTIONS FOR EACH OF OUR DEVICES
YEAH IF
UH AS YOU KNOW I AM MISTER RAMARO
I AM AN EXPERT IN UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN OF ALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND I PREVIOUSLY DEVISED MANY UH LIKE DIGITAL CALCULATORS AND ELECTRONIC CALCULATORS
SO WE NEED TO HAVE SOME ENERGY SOURCE TO DO WHAT TO DO THE FUNCTIONS WHAT WE WANT ON THIS PORTABLE DEVICE
AND USUALLY THIS SO TO DO THESE FUNCTIONS WE NEED AN INTERFACE WHICH BASICALLY SOME KIND OF PRESSING BUTTONS OR KEYS OR LIKE MOVING JACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THEN WE'LL HAVE SWITCH IN OUR MAIN UH UM DEVICE TO DO PARTICULAR OPERATIONS AND WE OUGHT TO DO DIFFERENT CODES FOR DIFFERENT T. V. S
SO SOME T. V. S WILL HAVE DIFFERENT ENCRYPTION CODES FOR DOING S S UH CHANNEL CHANGING AND THESE THINGS
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE THE PEOPLE DON'T USE ONE PARTICULAR BRAND SO OR AT LEAST WE HAVE MORE MORE THAN FIVE BRANDS WHICH ARE REALLY GOOD
SO WE HAVE THE MAIN UH ENERGY SOURCE AND THEN WE WILL HAVE SOME BUTTONS AND THEN WE WILL HAVE INFRARED UH SOURCE AND THEN WE HAVE SOME INSIDE SOME CHIP IN IN THE DEVICE
UH SINCE I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME SO I'LL INPUT THE CONNECTIONS TO ALL THIS COMPONENTS
SO WE CAN HAVE ANOTHER LIKE UH S SIMPLE SPEECH RECOGNISER ON OUR D. S. B. CHIP
SINCE WE HAVE SOME KIND OF UH ENERGY THIS IS OUR
THIS NORMAL BATTERY SO THIS BATTERY
ONCE YOU S SWITCH ON IT WILL TAKE POWER AND WE CAN HAVE SOME SPEECH RECOGNITION AND IN OUR G GENERALLY SMALL DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING CHIP SO THAT AND WE WILL PUT UH THE SMALL UH SIMPLE SPEECH RECOGNISER AND WE CAN ALSO TRAIN THE SPEECH RECOGNISER FOR PARTICULAR USER SO YOU JUST YEAH
NO EVEN IN YOU CAN FIND EVEN SIMPLE MOBILE DEVICE LIKE ANY MOBILE BRAND YOU CAN HAVE THESE VOICE DIALERS OR THESE THINGS YEAH
YE
NO YEAH A USER CAN USE ANY KIND OF SENDER BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE THIS PROMPT VOLUME AND THEN YEAH VOLUME AND DECREASE OR INCREASE
SO WE TRY TO ONLY RECOGNISE THOSE WORDS AND AND BECAUSE WE CAN'T REALLY SAY USER TO SAY SAME WORDING THEN IT BECOME MORE MECHANICAL AND YEAH
I MEAN THEY DON'T REALLY FOLLOW SAME CHANNELS STRICT UH SO WE JUST WANT CHANNEL NUMBER WE DON'T WANT LIKE B. B. C. OR C. N. N. OR SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE
IT WILL BE COMPLICATED SO WE'LL HAVE ONLY THESE THREE UH MAIN BASIC UH ANYWAY VOLUME IS NOT REALLY SPEECH RECOGNITION PROBLEM
YEAH ACTUALLY WE WE CAN HAVE ONE SWITCH TO LIKE UH SWITCH ON ON AND OFF THIS PROCESSOR AND
LIKE VOLUME AND LIKE THIS KEY
SO IT MAY NOT BE LIKE VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE SINCE WE ARE ONLY FOCUSING ON T. V. REMOTE CONTROL SO AND WE HAVE ONLY FEW THINGS HERE
BECAUSE IT DIFFERENT CRITERIA FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE LIKE SO SUPPOSE PEOPLE ARE REALLY UH THEY JUST UH THEY DON'T TOUCH THE REMOTE AND MM Y YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME YOU NEED TO SWITCH ON OR SWITCH OFF AND
SUPPOSE THEY'RE WATCHING A TENNIS MATCH OR SOMETHING THEN THEY CAN SAY OKAY UH AFTER ONE HOUR I
AH IT'S
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH
OKAY SO NOW WE ARE ON THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
UH Y GETTING CLOSE TO THE LAST IS THE PENULTIM MEETING
SO WHAT WE WANT TO THE DECISION WE WANT TO TAKE ON THIS MEETING ARE ON THE UM FIRST ON THE COMPONENT CONCEPT
AND ALSO ON USER INTERFACE CONCEPT UH WHAT KIND OF INTERFACE WE USE AND IF THERE IS SOME SUPPLEMENTS
AND AT THE END UM SAMMY WILL GIVE UM A TREND WATCHING ON WHAT HE'S HE'S BEEN DOING
WITH RAMA
UM I WANT TO KNOW WHY IT B UH JUST UH SORRY BUT FOR THE POINT BEFORE UH WHY NOT THE RUBBER
UH YEAH SO
OKAY S SO SIMPLE BUTTON AND UH SPEECH RECOGNITION FOR THE MORE COMPLICATED
THREE
BECAUSE APPARENTLY FROM YOUR SURVEY PEOPLE LIKE COLOURS NO
UH-HUH OKAY SO YOU YOU PROPOSE SOMETHING WITH OPTION I THAT INCREASE THE PRICE IF WE IF YOU WANT O MORE COLOURS ON L. C. D. YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT'S MAYBE MO TOO MUCH EXPENSIVE YEAH
BUT UH IT CAN BE IN UH MAYBE IN AN A GRADABLE VERSION BUT
OKAY AND YOU THINK THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE TO MAKE THEM PAY MORE BECAUSE OF UH O OR THIS IS
SO M SO MAYBE THAT'S IF THAT IT'S A SELLING POINT MAYBE IT HAS TO BE THE BASE
AH SORRY
S
UH YOU WILL WORK TOGETHER UH ON A NEW ON ON A PROTOTYPE USING MODELLING CLAY
AND I AS ALWAYS YOUR PERSONAL COACH WILL SEND YOU SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION
SO YOU SAY S
S DO WE AGREE ON THAT
UH FRUITY LIKE
OR OR SPONGY AN YEAH
YEAH I DON'T THINK W I THINK WE HAVE TO CHOOSE
AH YOU CAN PRETEND THAT IT'S UH TITANIUM
YEAH DO DON'T WORRY YOU YOU YOU SPEAK WITH MM MM
SO SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
UH RAMA
AH
AH
I GUESS NO UM
SO THIS DEVICE ON N THAT CAN BE USED FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION COULD ALSO BE USED FOR JUST UH THE FINDING IT BASICALLY
WE HAVE DREAMS AND THE IN THE END WE FIND OUT THAT IT'S NOT FEASIBLE
L. S. D. IS SOMETHING ELSE AND IT'S QUITE NICE AS WELL
OH NO TOO MUCH CONCEPT
AH
AH BACK TODAY
DO YOU THINK IT CAN COME IN SEVERAL COLOURS
I DON'T USE THAT BUT AGAIN UH I MIGHT
THOSE FOR WHICH THE REMOTE CONTROL IS UH
IS TO BE UH SOMETHING USEFUL UH I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS LATER BUT AND THOSE FOR WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT UH IS UH SPECIFIC TO THEM SO IT IT'S LIKE A SIGNATURE
NOBODY ELSE THAN ME HAS A PINK REMOTE CONTROL
THOSE WHO WANTED TO HAVE IT PINK
OH YOU DON'T
YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR REMO
WH YOU YOU KNOW LIKE FOR INSTANCE TAKE THE IPOD
UH IT'S WHITE AND IT'S SO WHITE THAT YOU SEE IT FROM ANY ANYWHERE
IT HAS THIS DISTINCTIVE LOOK AND FEEL AND LOOK WHICH PEOPLE SEEMS TO LIKE JUST BECAUSE IT'S A COLOUR THAT WE DON'T USUALLY SEE IN A REMOTE CONTROL
WHITE
ARE ARE YOU SAYING HERE THAT UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHO IS USING IT
S SINCE IT IT KNOWS WHO IS USING IT
FOUR I THINK
TO GO OFTEN ON THE WEB AND LOOK AT UH WHAT THE OTHERS ARE DOING
WE CAN WE CAN USE THE PHONE AS A AS A GOOD UH UH EXAMPLE OF WHERE TO IN BE INSPIRED
OF COURSE THOSE THA D WHO ARE WATCHING THE TRENDS ARE ALSO HAVE ALSO TO BE INSPIRED BECAUSE IN FACT THEY'RE NOT ONLY WATCHING THE TRENDS
I HOPE I'M GOING TO TRY TO HELP YOU ON THAT
WHICH MEANS EITHER YOU SUCCEED AND YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OR YOU DON'T AND YOU'RE OUT OF BUSINESS
UH TO BE TO BE QUICK THERE'S A LOT OF WORDS HERE BUT UH BASICALLY THERE ARE UH IN IN THE MARKET OF OF REMOTE CONTROLS THERE ARE THREE ASPECTS THAT WE SHOULD VERY PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO
STRANGELY ENOUGH IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO BE FANCY THAN TO BE WI AND NOW THAT'S THE SECOND THING IT HAS TO BE IT HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY I INNOVATIVE
IT HAS TO BE NEW WITH SOME OF UH NEW UH TECHNOLOGY INSIDE AND UH AND THIS IS ALSO UH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LAST THING WHICH WE W MAY THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT
SO AS YOU SEE UH IT FIRST HAVE TO BE VERY NICE
S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE PROUD OF UH UH THAT I UH THEY CAN BE ID IDENTIFIED WITH UH AND AND THEN UH SOMETHING THAT UM CONTAINS VERY NOVEL STUFF THAT THEY CAN TALK ABOUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS
AND FINALLY OF COURSE IT HAS TO BE USEFUL AS A REMOTE CONTROL BUT IT SEEMS THAT IT'S NOT SO IMPORTANT THAT IT'S USEFUL AS A REMOTE CONTROL
UH AND NOW IN A MORE UH GENERAL UH UH BROAD WAY OF SEEING TH UH THE THING
IF WE LOOK BACK AND NOT UH LOOK AT ONLY REMOTE CONTROLS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE THAT THE TRENDS ARE QUITE THE SAME IN MANY AREAS SO CURRENTLY THE THE TRENDS THAT WE SEE IN L IN L BIG CITIES LIKE PARIS AND MILAN
WELL IT SEEMS THAT THIS YEAR THINGS SHOULD HAVE UH A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE UH WAY OF OF LOOK OR FEEL OR SO
AND I THINK OF COURSE UH I IT APPLIES TO EVERYTHING
AND UH IF WE CO WE COMPARE TO LAST YEAR NOW IT HAS TO BE SPONGY YEAH
WELL THIS SO SO I THINK UH UH I
THINK MORE OF UH SOMETHING IN THE COLOURS OF UH LIKE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES AND SPONGY
AS A EVEN IN THE SHAPE IT HAS TO BE MORE ROUND AND UH
AND NOT THOSE FUTURISTIC UH REMOTE CONTROL WITH ANGLES AND UH AND TITANIUM LIKE
THESE I'M SORRY
AS YOU KNOW OUR COMPANY IS QUITE BIG AND UH SO I'M JUST ASKING THEM WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS ACCORDING TO THEM WHEN THEY GO IN THE STORES AND WHEN THEY ASK UH THEIR UH FRIENDS THAT ARE ALSO WELL
WE HAVE TO I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE THE LOOK OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES BUT WE STILL HAVE TO PUT OUR CHIPS INSIDE SO OF COURSE
AGAIN AS I SAID WE CAN ALSO TRY TO MAKE IT TO CREATE THE TREND
WELL THAT'S YOU T CAN TRY TO CONVINCE US
UH
I THINK I YEAH I IT'S AGAIN IN THIS UH WHAT I SAID FIRST IT HAS TO BE FANCY SO I THINK IF NOBODY ELSE PRO PROVIDES CURRENTLY A REMOTE CONTROL WITH THAT KIND OF STUFF AND IF WE CAN PROVIDE IT I THINK IT'S A GOOD SELL FOR US BECAUSE WE HAVE IT AND OTHERS DON'T
WE HAVE A VERY LARGE DEPARTMENT OF PAINT
THE THING IS THAT UH IF WE WANT TO HAVE AS HE SAYS IF WE WANT TO HAVE UH A SMALL NUMBER OF BUTTONS WE NEED TO HAVE A KIND OF OUTPUT THAT SAYS CURRENTLY WHAT THEIR ACTIONS ARE
CLASSICAL WE STAY CLASSICAL IN THAT WE DON'T REINVENT UH THE WHEEL
W WE CAN USE SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE BODY'S TITANIUM BUT THERE ARE SOME RUBBER OR I DUNNO SOME RUBBER PARTS LIKE TO MAKE IT FEEL BETTER AND TO YOU KNOW
OKAY SO LET'S TRY IT LET'S T
UH
MM UH HAVE A LOOK AT THIS NO IT'S YEAH
UH SO THE CONCEPT OF THE INTERFACE
WE GOT OUR PERFECT REMOTE CONTROL WITH A LOT OF BUTTONS AND UH WE GOT EXPLANATION FOR EVERY BUTTON AND YOU CAN USE YOUR TIME AND UH IT WILL TAKE I SOME DAYS TO LEARN ALL THIS BUTTONS AND UM THE L. C. D. IS GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE HERE
AND UH GO BACK BUTTON I DON'T KNOW REALLY WHERE IT IS MAYBE ONE OF THIS BUTTONS
I THOUGHT YOU LIKE IT
AH OKAY JUST PRESS THE BUTTON PLEASE UH
YEAH WE WILL NOT USE THIS
WE WILL NOT USE THIS
DO YOU LIKE IT
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T HAVE IT
OKAY WHAT UH THERE'S ONE MORE DECISI UH ONE MORE SOLUTION IN FACT
UM 'CAUSE THERE ARE SOME SOME PAINTS THAT CAN CHANGE COLOUR ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE LIKE THEY CAN REFLECT DIFFERENT COLOURS
S WELL LET'S GO ON MAYBE WITH THE PRESENTATION
AND UM THE REMOTE CONTROL'S GOING TO BE SMART BUT HOW SMART SHOULD IT BE TO NOT TO COMPLICATE THINGS TOO MUCH
I DUNNO THAT'S A QUESTION TO YOU AND TO MM TO
UH YEAH I JUST WANT TO SAY IT SHOULD BE REAL SMART
TO L TO L LOCK IT
SO WE HAVE TO UH FOR
ON A WHOLE
WELL OKAY W WE'LL SEE
SO WE'RE TO MAINLY DESIGN F MAINLY NEED TO KNOW WHICH COMPONENTS WE'LL USE FOR ENERGY AND THE MATERIAL AND INTERFACE
FIRST ONE WE CAN USE SIMPLE BATTERY OR WE CAN USE TRADITIONAL SOLAR CELLS OR MM AND THE MATERIAL WE CAN HAVE PLASTIC
RUBBER WHICH IS GOOD FOR THIS R. S. A. AND THEN UH TITANIUM
WHICH CAN BE WHICH HAVE VERY GOOD LOOK AN AND THEN INTERFACE WE'RE TO USE PUSH BUTTONS OR LIQUID CRYSTAL D L. C. D. DISPLAY
SO AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE WE NEED TO WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME SPEECH RECOGNITION S CHIP IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL
AND WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT OUR REMOTE CONTROL SO
STILL WE ARE LOOKING FOR POSSIBLE UH TECHNICAL UH SPECIFICATIONS AND HOW W EASY WE CAN DO AND WITHIN OUR PRI RANGE
LIKE WE'RE TO IN OUR TWELVE EUROS OR AROUND THAT
SO UH WE DISCUSSED AN
SO WE WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE BATTERY INSTEAD OF SOLAR CELLS AND IT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC UH TO HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY WITH THE SOLAR CELLS AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO JUST USE SIMPLE BATTERY
WE WANT TO GO FOR SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS BECAUSE IT NEED A SIMPLE CHIP AND IT'S REALLY LESSER UH RE REALLY LESS EXPENSIVE COMPARED TO L. C. D. WHICH ARE UH WHICH NEEDS ADVANCED CHIP TECHNOLOGY AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
UH
UH
AND THIS PUSH BUTTONS WE WE WOULD LIKE TO USE PUSH BUTTONS INSTEAD OF L. C. D. S AND SO WE WANT TO MO I MEAN WE'RE WE WANT TO PUT SPEECH RECOGNITION SO WE WANT TO REDUCE PRICE ON THIS TECHNOLOGY AND SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH SPACE OR ENOUGH MONEY FOR
S S
Y YEAH WE HAVE SIMPLE BUTTONS AND SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SO
YEAH WE'RE TO GO FOR LI AND NOW I THINK WE HAVE MANY OPTIONS IN THE MARKET SO WE CAN GO FOR SMALL NICKEL OR ALKALINE BATTERIES FOR
THAT'S THEN THE THE ONE THING WE WANT TO KNOW IS LIKE BECAUSE REMOTE CONTROL IS USED FOR LIKE IN THE HOUSEHOLD SO IT IT IT WILL BE IT M MAYBE AT LEAST FIVE
SIX PEOPLE WANT TO USE IT SO SO HOW TO UH UH HOW TO DEFINE OUR RE SPEECH RECOGNITION WHETHER WE WANT TO DO S SPEAKER INDEPENDENT OR SPEAKER DEPENDENT
THREE
SO MAYBE YOU CAN USE IN THE END AND
UH
MAYBE WE CAN JUST IF USERS WANT MORE COLOURS THEY CAN PAY MORE MONEY TO GET THIS
TWO EURO
UH
SO LIKE WE CAN THOSE
AH
RADIUM CHIPS OR SOMETHING SO THAT LIKE AT LEAST UM YEAH
IT'S MORE GENERAL TREND IT'S NOT PARTICULAR TO THE REMOTE CONTROL
WE CAN HAVE T COLOURS OR THIS SHAPE OR AT LEAST YEAH
LOOK AND FEEL DE
SO WHAT ABOUT LOCATION AND THESE THINGS PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTING ON THOSE FEATURES
OR THEY REALLY LIKE
FEATURE
UH YEAH AT LEAST LIKE WE CAN MAKE BANANA OR
YEAH IT'S IT'S YEAH THAT'S A WE'RE TO LOOK FOR AND AND S WE'RE TO SEE THE WHETHER RUBBER IS EXPENSIVE AND D
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ASSEMBLY ALSO LIKE ONE SPONGY AND ONE KIND OF TITANIUM
UH
SO UH NOW IT'S THE HI SAMMY
THEN W WE
AND THEN WE GOING TO DO SOME FINANCE TO SEE IF UH IT IS UH FEASIBLE AND UH AT THE END WE WILL WE WILL UM EVALUATE OURSELF AS A TEAM
SEE THE PROTOTYPE
MASA
HE
HO HO
AND W WAIT WH WHAT ARE THE STRAWBERRIES FOR
AH
UH WE'LL SEE IN THE FINANCIAL PART IF UH ALL GETS INTO
W
LET'S UH YEAH LET'S SEE IF UH TH IT'S MEET THE EVALUATION CRITERIUM
I AM NOT THE D THE ONLY ONE CHOOSING YEAH
CHANGE COLOUR OF T
AND YOU CAN UH DO DI TWO SITES
LET ME UNDERSTAND WELL BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT'S FOR THAT THIS ONE ARE B D UH TWO DIR DIRECTIONAL BUTTON
NOW IT'S LOOKS US USEFUL
UH OH
I'M NOT CONVINCE
I WOULD HAVE M UH I FOUND MORE FANCY THAT THE FRUITS ARE USEFUL
BUT THE N YEAH
IT'S N NO IT'S NOT FANCY ANY MORE
OKAY SO YOU YOU YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING UH A PROTECTION FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEA
SO I HAVE AN HERE
OH NUMBER
H
ONE ALSO
OH SEE I I THINK THAT THE THE PRICE IS THIS ONE
DON'T CHIP ON ME
AGAIN I'M SEE IT
SPECIAL COLOUR OR IT'S ONLY ON THE
YEAH BUT THERE IS NO COLOUR HERE
THREE OR TWO
IS THERE THE SCROLL WHEEL OKAY
YOU TRY TO S NO NO NO
BECAUSE HOW DO YOU DO TO Y SELECT
YOU YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE NO
MM MAYBE N NOT THIS ONE BUT
THEY ARE M
BOO HOO
ONE HERE AND HERE
M MAYBE MINUS UH THREE NO
SO OH SORRY
OH WE CAN PUT UH A HAND DYNAMO AND A BATTERY IF YOU WANT
YEAH YEAH Y
UH
YEAH BUT UH IS UH ENGLISH
SEE MM HOW ARE WE A GOOD TEAM
IS THERE ENOUGH ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
I'M THE ONE PROPOSING THE CELEBRATION
AH UM I THINK IT'S FINISH
SO HI CHRISTA
HO HO
IF I IF I NEED SO
HOPEFULLY MY DAUGHTER WILL LIKE IT
OF C COURSE
AH
IT'S IN OPTION
HEY BOB
OH THESE ARE STRAWBERRIES
I DIDN'T KNOW IT EXIST BUT THAT'S GREAT
HA
YOU MEAN WE CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR UH OF TH
UH OKAY
ON THE L. C. D.
IN INTERESTING
LET'S SEE IF THIS YEAH IF YOU MEET
WE NOW NEED ALTOGETHER TO TRY TO EVALUATE IT TO SEE IF IT MAKES SENSE TO DO IT
AS YOU KNOW BEFORE GOING AND UH CREATING AND PRODUCING THESE STRAWBERRY UH REMOTE CONTROL
UH SO WE NEED TO EVALUATE IT UM TRY TO DO IT IN A CONSTATIVE WAY AND AS MUCH AS WE CAN
TO SO WHAT I PROPOSE IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO TO HAVE THIS SCALE FROM ONE TO SEVEN
ONE MEANING THAT YE YES UH IT FULFILS UH THE THE CRITERION WHATEVER IT IS
WITH FOUR IN THE MIDDLE
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS IT FANCY
IS IT
NOW WE'RE WE'RE ON THE FANCINESS NOW
YEAH O ONE MEANS IT'S YES A VERY FANCY AND SEVEN MEAN NO AT ALL
OKAY WE JUST LOST ONE STRAWBERRY
SO NOT AT ALL
I UM UH I WOULD SAY THREE
WELL SO THE QUESTION IS DOES IT HAVE UH THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF RE REMOTE CONTROL
OH IT'S A JOG DIAL OKAY
IS IT THE THE THE EFFECTIVE SIZE AND WEIGHT THAT THE IS IT UH REAL SIZE REAL WEIGHT
UP TO THREE FOR THAT BECAUSE I'M HAVEN'T SEEN THE WEIGHT SO I MUST NOT UH COLOUR AND SHAPE
WELL SO COLOUR IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE THE SEVERAL COLOURS FOR THE L. C. D.
YAHOO
UH I THINK USEFULNESS IS M AS AS I REM UM JUST HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT USEFULNESS IS MUCH LESS IMPORTANT THAN FANCINESS
BECAUSE UH EVERYBODY S DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CONVINCE ALTHOUGH IT'S QUITE YOU HAVE GOOD ARGUMENTS
THIS IS NOT R MAYBE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE OTHER ONE BUT UH CAN WE ADAPT IT TO EACH EACH PERSONAL USE
AH HA
ONE BATTERY
NO NE NEVER INSTALL
TWO BATTERIES OR ONE
ONE
ONE
MAYBE THERE IS A SUPPLEMENT FOR THAT NO
THIS OKAY YOU D WE TRIED WE TRIED
T TITANIUM
OH I THINK NO IT'S UH IS IT A SCROLL WHEEL AND PE PUSH BUTTON TH THIS CENTRE ONE
NO BUT YOU SELECT WITH THE TWO D THE OTHER TWO BUTTONS NO
IT'S ONLY BUTTONS THESE
NO THE COLOUR IS IN THE L. C. D.
SO WHAT IS ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CUT THINGS OUT NOW
UH UNTIL WE GET TWELVE FIFTY
MAYBE PUT MINUS TWO SO IT LOOKS UH MORE REASONABLE
OKAY WE'RE ON TIME
IS IT
I'M JUST CURIOUS TO SEE THIS UH MY ADDRESS CHIP ON PRINT
TRICK
ARE THE COST UNDER TWELVE
WHEN WE SEE THE RESULTS THERE IS NO DOUBT THERE MAYBE A LACK OF LEADERSHIP
AND THERE'S UH ONE VERY IMPORTANT POINT
WE'RE ON TIME
THE FOR MEETING IT'S UH ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
YEAH WE HAVE OTHER UH REMOTE CONTROLS TO CREATE
ARE THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET
IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED
TO THE WHOLE OUR COMPANY
UH
SO WE HAVE TO GO OUT
THIS IS OUR
SO FIRST I PRESENT AS WE CAME TO THIS PERFECT MODEL AND THEN WE'LL GIVE SOME TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
IF YOU CAN SEE THIS AND THE STARS ARE SHOWING THAT
S PLEASE NEXT SLIDE
BUT WE STILL DIDN'T WANT TO GO FAR FROM OUR TITANIUM IDEA 'CAUSE IT'S THE MOST OF THE MODER THE M
AND AS I SAID IT'S PERFECT
EVERYONE IS F REALLY UH REALLY GLAD TO OBTAIN AN
S SUCH A R SUCH A DEVICE
Y AND WE GOT THE ANSWER
NOW IT'S TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION BY OUR
SO R WE'LL START WITH L. C. D.
UH
YOU GO YOU SO THE BASIC MODE YEAH
THE BASIC MODE IS UH YOU GOT JUST TWO BUTTONS AND A JOG DIAL
AND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE TO S TWENTY FIVE YOU PUSH ON THIS
EVEN IF IT IS YOU KNOW IT'S VERY ROUNDED BUT STILL YOU GOT SOME RUBBER FRUIT HERE
WELL N WHY THREE
FOR BUTTONS
AND I PROPOSE TO SO UH ABOUT CHIPS
SO PUT MINUS ONE THERE PLEASE
MINUS
M MAYBE NOT HUH
WHAT WAS THE OH YEAH WHAT WAS GOOD
UH
WE NEED TIME F
SO WE SEE WE CAN EVEN FORECAST
THEY PROPOSE US LIKE CELEBRATION EVERYTHING WE COULD FORECAST IT RIGHT
IN
HIM
SEE THIS
SO AS WE DISCUSSED WE HAVE TO SWITCH ON SWITCH OFF WHENEVER WE WANT
OR LIKE YOU CAN USE THIS JOG WHEEL AND SELECT WHICH EVER OPTION ON THE L. C. D. AND THEN DO ON AND OFF
LIKE M SWITCHING THE L. C. D. DISPLAY IF YOU WANT TO USE L. C. D. OR YOU DON'T WANT YOU CAN JUST USE NORMAL BUTTON
HERE YOU HAVE MICROPHONE AND THEN IT DATE RECORDS YOUR VOICE AND THEN IT TRY TO RECOGNISE
AND THEN IT WILL SAY HI
YEAH HI AND THEN YOU CAN USE IT
SO UM OUR TEAM IS NOW FRUITS
SO YOU CAN HAVE AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THE LOOK L. C. D. AND ALL THE SWITCHES
WE WILL SEND WE WANT TO
YEAH OR S
EVEN YOU CAN CONFIGURE YOUR COLOURS FOR ITS THE DEPENDING ON YOUR MOOD OR S
AH THESE ARE LIKE SENSORS
S
YEAH THEN WE CAN HAVE HOW MUCH FOR HOW MONEY IS LEFT
OH OH
SO OH OKAY
M MAYBE TWO
IT'S SILLY
UH STILL WE NEED TO CHA
THESE ARE THE MAIN
YEAH AND YOU CAN DO ON L. C. D. USING THESE GOING TO SCROLLING ALL THE OPTION
Y YOU NEED TO LIKE PRESS TWO AND FIVE AND YEAH
SO D YEAH WE NEED TO ADDRESS WE WANT WE ONLY ADDRESS TWO MAIN FUNCTIONS HERE AND THE OTHER FUNCTIONS WILL BE ON L. C. D.
UM SEE IN L. C. D. LIKE YOU WILL HAVE BLOCKS AND YOU SELECT WHICH ONE
WE WILL S WE USE TITANIUM
NOT LIKE THIS D WE'RE JUST GIVING THE FRUIT FOR MORE FANCINESS AND MORE ATTRACTION TOO
EVEN WE CAN PROVIDE MANY DIFFERENT COLOURS OR DIFFERENT FRUITS AND
YEAH WE'VE YEAH WE HAVE SENSORS HERE AND SO HERE AND HERE SO WE JUST YEAH SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T PUT IT WORKS
YEAH TWO ONE ONE SEVEN WE HAVE
FINANCI
UH WE USE BAT
ONE BATTERY
OH WE JUST NEED ONE I GUESS
NO NUMBER IS ONE
WE HAVE SAMPLE CHIP
YEAH ONE TO ONE
YEAH ONE
OH IS
NO ONLY ONE NO
YES IN L. C. D. DISPLAY
YEAH AN YEAH
SCRO
ONE SCROLL WHEEL
ONE L. C. D.
AH
Y YE
IS
YEAH JUST REMO
S
UH NO
IT'S NOT CHANGING NO
SO NOW ON WE CAN INCREASE OUR STILL YOU HAVE TWO MORE
IS REALLY STRICT
HO
UH
OH WE STILL I GUESS
AH WE GOT NEW IDEA SPEECH RECOGNITION LOCATION FINDING
NEW MATERIALS NEW S UH THIS FANCY STRAWBERRY DESIGN
AH VERY
UH YE WILL GO TO ITALIAN RESTAURANT OR
AH OKAY
AH IT'S OKAY
YEAH YOU SEE THE EMAIL
THE V VERY NO NO THE FIRST ONE
OH YOU DIDN'T GET ANYTHING
I GOT AN EMAIL ABOUT THE DIS ABOUT THE DISCUSSION
YEAH SO EACH OF US HAS A ROLE TO DO
ARE YOU USING THE YOU ARE DOING THE IN
AH
YOU SEE THE SECOND MAIL
SEE THERE'S A ROLE FOR EVERYBODY
NEED TO COLLECT INFORMATION
UH
UH
I WANT UH TO LIST ALL THE PROGRAMME TONIGHT
Y YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF UH REMOTE CONTROL IT'S DOING THE SOME SEARCHING FOR YOU SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FOR THE CHANNEL YOU WANT
AND THEN YOU LIST A FEW AND I WILL CHOOSE FROM THE LIST
BUT TH THE MAIN IDEA I WANTED TO S I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT UM THERE SHOULD BE A FUNCTION INSTEAD OF CHOOSING THE CH T. V. CHANNEL
THERE'S A OPTION YOU CAN CHOOSE EITHER T. V. CHANNELS OR OR PR OR THE OR THE CONTAIN OR THE CONTENTS OF THE PROGRAMME
NO BECAUSE YOU SEE NOW ALL THE T. V. PROGRAMMES ARE AVAILABLE ON THE WEBS
WE JUST SAY THAT THIS ARE SOME CONTENT
DOWNLOAD IT UH TO THE TO THIS REMOTE CONTROL
AH YES
AH W W WE HAVE SOMETIMES TO USE THE WHITE BOARD
OKAY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONCEPTUAL REMOTE CONTROL THERE OR YOU JUST WANT TO PUT THE FUNCTION IN
AH OKAY
SO SO THE MOST FUNCTIONAL DES MM THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IS TO CH CHOO BUTTONS TO CHOOSE THE CONTENT
UH UH FIRST ONE IS TO UH BUTTONS I OR IT COULD BE ANYTHING WITH BUTTONS
OKAY SO TECHNICALLY HOW THE PROBLEMS THAT HOW TO DO IT IS TO HOW TO GET THE CONTENT
OKAY SO THESE WE HAVE TO WORK IT OUT
SO WE ARE WE'LL DISCUSS IT WE WILL GET SOME INFORMATION IN THE NEXT MEETING SO FOR NOW WE GET UH THE FUNCT THIS IS THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGNER
THANK YOU MIS
UH
S
SO THERE ARE SO WE HAVE THREE F YEAH
YOU ARE DOING TH
NOTHING RELATED HERE TO THE
ABOUT THE DESIGN OR
MAYBE WE'LL DISCUSS THIS LATER NO
WHAT WE WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THE THESE CHARACTERISTICS
ABOUT THE ABOUT WHAT
YEAH OF G OF COURSE
I I THINK IF WE INCLUDE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY ON THE REMOTE CONTROL IT WILL BE VERY COSTLY
S
LIKE S UH YOU YOU YOU SAY WE CAN USE SPEECH
AH YOU CAN Y YOU CAN YOU CAN USE IT IF YOU SO CAN WE
S
IF IF YOU YOU YOU CAN IF YOU WANT YOU CAN USE TH THE
BE BEFORE BEFORE WRITING YOU CAN UH SIT AND THAT SAYS WHAT WE WHAT WE SAID THEN AFTER THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN USE THE
I THINK IT'S FOR YOUR GUYS TO HOW TO DESIGN IT ALL THE ASPECTS SO YOU NEED THAT INFORMATION
UH I'M INTO MARKETING
YEAH NOTHING MUCH IN THE PROJECT
US USER DEFINE
I MEAN THE MAIN UH FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS TO HAVE SOMETHING IN THE HAND AND WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
I'M NOT SURE WITH TRENDY SLIM SIZE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IT WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT A SPEECH RECOG IF YOU WANT TO PUT A SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM F INTERFACE FOR THAT I THINK THE T. V. ITSELF COULD HAVE IT
I NEED NOT HAVE AN
AND ANOTHER INTERESTING IDEA FOR THIS WOULD BE TO HAVE AN LIGHT ADAPTATION SYSTEM DEPENDING UPON THE PICTURE OF
I MEAN WE HAVE A OPTION IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
IF WE WANT TO HAVE THAT OPTION YOU PRESS THAT BUTTON IN THE REMOTE
OH I'M AFRAID YOU FORGOT TO PUT YOUR LAPEL
UH
USER
WELL W WE WANT TO HAVE A NEW RE REMOTE CONTROL FOR FOR T. V. DISTRIBUTION I GUESS
I THINK IF YOU WANT T TO CHOOSE UH FROM A LIST OF PROGRAMME OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU YOU MAY HAVE TO TO USE UH W UH I DUNNO
ON THE CONTENT
THE ONE ON TOP
FOR MEN
TO THE IN
WHAT IS F. P. G. A.
UH
SO THIS ARE THE THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER
IS THE IS THE SOFTWARE PAR ALRI OKAY
YOU CAN PUT IT ON THE CHARGER WHEN UH YOU WHEN YOU DON'T NEED TO USE IT
BECAUSE YOU ARE USING BECAUSE YOU ARE USING BLUETOOTH IF SOME PEOPLE HAVE P. D. A. THEY CAN USE THEIR P. D. A. TO CONTROL THE T. V. IF THEY WANT TO RIGHT
YEAH THIS YOUR
SO YOU CAN OPEN UH THREE
SO THE THE PURPOSE IS TO TO FIND UH THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ASK IS WHAT EFFECT SHOULD THE APPARATUS HAVE
SO SO I FOUND ON A WEBS ON THE INTERNET YEAH
FOR EXAMPLE SWITCH ON SWITCH OFF SWITCH THE NEXT CHANNEL AND SO ON AND SO ON
BUT THEN UH LOO BUT THEN I FOUND IF YOU LOOK AT YOU SEE ON THE LEFT ONE THERE ARE TOO MANY BUTTONS
SO YOU SO YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT THE NEXT ONE
YOU CAN NAVIGATE ON T. V. SCREEN AND WE CAN THE USER'S PREFERENCE AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE T. V. CONNECTED TO INTERNET SO WE END IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE T. V. PROGRAMMES BY X. M. L. AND WE NEED SOME TO DO SOME PREPROCESSING
FROM THE TECHNICAL ASPECT THE PROCESSING SHOULD BE DONE ON THE T. V. SET THAN ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROLLER RIGHT
AND THEN WE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AS UH HARRY SAYS WE MAY JUST PUT IN WE MAY K. I. V.
YEAH ALL THE PROCESSING IS DONE THE T. V. IS A COMPU HAS SOME PROCESSING POWER THE
YEAH BECAUSE ARE YOU JUST WONDERING WHAT CONTROLLER OKAY
SO I THE PROCESSING ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROLLER SO IT CAN U BE USED IN ANY T. V. ANY CONVENTIONAL T. V. SETS
N YEAH THAT'S ALL
SO I COME UP WITH A SIMPLE DESIGN JUST KEEP THE V NAVIGATION BUTTONS
NO BECAUSE YOU CHOOSE BY CHANNEL SO YOU CHOOSE BY T. V. PROGRAM SO YOU DON'T HAVE HUNDRED CHANNELS TO CHOOSE FROM
AH
AH A BIG JUMP
SO IT'LL BEEP IF YOU WANNA FIND IT YOU JUST UH SHOUT Y H JUST IT JUST HAS TO RE RESPOND TO YOU WHEN YOU LOOK FOR THE DEVICE
AND RESPONDS TO YOU AND
SO YOU NEED S SPECIAL T. V. SETS TO DO THAT
TH THE SYSTEM WILL CHANGE AND WE HAVE TO ANTICIPATE FOR THOSE CHANGE
UH FOR THE AIM OF THIS
NOW IS TO
IN THE IN THE DESIGN
OR Y YOU CAN USE THE WHITEBOARD IF YOU WANT
AH
MA
PARTICIPANT ONE NO
OH WE HAVE SO LET'S MOVE TO
TO USER INTERFACE DESIGN
THIS ARE USUAL FUNCTIONALITY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE PA PA PROCESSING WILL BE DONE ON THE T. V.
THAN THE
WE CAN INTEGRATE SMALL MICROPHONE IN THE REMOTE SO IT'S NOT REALLY A PROBLEM
ACCORDING TO THE RE TO THE NEW REQUIREMENTS I THINK WE DON'T NEED THAT
SO WE HAVE I THINK WE HAVE S STILL WE HAVE
IS THE
IN FUTURE
YEAH TO RUN TH TO MAKE IT RUN
INTO THE MORE COMPACT AND UH OKAY
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT TO HAVE TO BUY THE BATTERIES WHEN THEY RUN OUT
G
OH BUT YOU HAVE A CATCH THERE
TOO SMALL THAT IT GOES UNDER THE SOFA AND WE CAN'T FIND IT
THEN WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE PUT A FEEDBACK FORMS IN ALL THE MAGAZINES AND THE USERS SEND THE FEEDBACKS AND BASED ON THAT
AN IT DOES HOW FEASIBLE IT IS
OH WE CAN PUT AN LIMITED VOCABULARY AS IN THE MOBILE PHONES
OR THEY SAY MOVIE NAME OR I DON'T GO FOR MOVIE NAMES BUT ONLY FOR THE NUMBERS ON THE CHANNEL
SO I THINK THIS SHOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO PUT THIS FEATURES
I THINK AS I DISCUSSED TH THAT FOUR POINTS WOULD BE GOOD FOR UM MARKETING
AND REGARDING THE TELETEXT UH THESE ARE THE SUBTITL THESE ARE THE TEXT INFORMATION WHICH YOU GOT ON THE TELEVISIONS
UH OPEN
SO UH CAN YOU GO ONE PAGE DOWN PLEASE
SO UH MM I'M THIN UH I THINK UH I I'LL DO A SURVEY ABOUT WHAT IS UH WHAT IS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET AND WHAT WHAT IS THE THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE THINGS WE HAV WE CAN USE
THEN UH I WILL TRY WITH THE TECHNICAL TEAM TO TO BUILD A PROTOTYPE AND TO SEE UH WITH UH H HOW THIS LITTLE BOX WOULD UH LOOK LOOK LIKE
AND HOW AN AND WE CAN UH START TROUBLESHOOTING FIRST UH COM COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
WHA WHAT I THINK FOR NOW IS WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL W WHICH IS WIRED SO UH I THINK WE U WE CAN USE A BATTERY FOR THE
SO UH THIS IS THE THE SCHEMA OF THE O OF THE FUTURE UH REMOTE CONTROLS SO UH YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE THE COMPONENTS
THE ONE ON TOP IS FOR THE UM WELL THE FUNCTIONALI THE FUNCTIONALITIES AND THE THE TH RED UM SORRY THE GREEN ONE IS IS TO WELL
I THINK WE SHOULD USE A F. P. G. A. FOR FOR THE FUNCTIONALITIES WHICH IS EASY TO TO T
WELL UH A F. P. G. A. IS JUST A CHIP YOU CAN UH YOU CAN PR PROGRAMME IT UH WI WITH WH WHATEVER YOU WANT
WELL TH THE F. P. G. A. WILL PRODUCE THE THE DATA TO SEND
UH NO NO NO NO I THINK UH WE HAVE UH TO TO UH HAVE UH EMBEDDED UH B BATTERIES IN IN THE YEAH INTO THE T
AND UH I I DON'T THINK IT WILL NEED UM VERY UH MUCH POWER TO MAKE IT RUN SO
S OKAY SO CHARGER FOR IS THE
SO WE HAVE TO T
WE HAVE TO SELL A T. V. WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL TOO
I THINK THERE THERE IS THERE IS AL THERE THERE IS A A TECHNOLOGY LIKE SHOW VIEW WHO IS ALREADY AVAILABLE ON MOST OF THE T. V. SET ON RECORDERS OR THING LIKE THAT AND WE CAN TRY T TO GET THIS INFORMATION ON TO THE REMOTE CONTROL TO TO DO THE PROCESSING ON THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE
WE D WE DON'T WE WE DON'T NEED REALLY MUCH BUTTONS TO I IF WE HAVE A SCREEN TO NAVIGATE ON ON THE T. V. SO UH
WELL THEN Y YOU YOU GO TO THE MAIN MENU AND UH YOU HAVE UH GO TO CHANNEL AND THEN UH YOU CAN
BUT UH I I THINK I I IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO TO MAKE UH WELL A A BIG JUMP BUT UH WELL YOU YOU HAVE TO TO HAVE A A A DEVICE WHEN YOU COULD YOU COULD
WELL I I THINK IT WILL BE A YES A BIT COMPLICATED TO UM MAKE A SPEECH RECOGNISERS RUNS ON THE SMALL UH TS
YEAH S S SPEECH IS A IMPORTANT EXTRA FEATURE I THINK
WE ARE WE WE JUST HAVE TO FIND A MEAN HOW TO TO ADD A M A A A MICROPHONE OR UH WELL YES A MICROPHONE INTO THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
I WELL IT WILL BE ALRIGHT
YEAH I THINK IT'S A BIT COMPLEX TOO
I I I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE UP WITH TELETEXT NO
BECAUSE IF
SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA IF I I IF WE I IF IF WE UH THINK ABOUT HOW TO TO TO BUILD UP OUR REMOTE UH CONTROL W WITH THIS FUNCTIONALITY IN A W WHICH WILL C WHICH WILL COME IN A FEW YEARS
YEAH TO DESI WELL NOT NOT TO IMPLEMENT IT BUT TO WELL
TO FIND A WAY TO TO ADD TO ADD THIS FUNCTIONALITY IN A YEAH IN AN IN AN EASY MANNER IF IS POSSIBLE
YO L YEAH
WHA
AH THE DEPARTMENT
UH
IS THAT THE UH WELL YOU'VE SEEN THEM I LE NA MY PRESENTATION THAT UM I POINT OUT SOME WHY BUTTONS ARE NOT THE MM
NOT THE ONLY WAYS YOU CAN USE
YEAH MAYBE N
I IT USES THE ASPECT UH OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM A PROGRAMME WHICH CAN BE SEEN OR HEARD
SO YOU S THIS GIVES YOU THE WAYS TO INPUT DATA AND WE HAVE UH WE ARE MORE WE EMPHASISE MORE ON THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE HERE
SYMBOLS AND ON SO YOU YOU CAN EASILY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SYMBOLS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS DOING
SO AH BY THE WAY I RECEIVE AN EMAIL FROM THE FROM ONE OUR DEPARTMENTS SAYING THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION HAS BEEN USED IN THE COFFEE MACHINE FOR THIS BY A COMPANY WHEN YOU TELL THE YOU SAY GOOD MORNING COFFEE MACHINE AND THE MACHINE ARE REPLY TO YOU
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THIS VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IS READY TO BE USED SO WE MIGHT CONSIDER THAT
MM SO SOMEBODY SOME PEOPLE USE UH SOME PEOPLE USE A SPINNING WHEEL TH WITH THE L. C. DISPLAY SO INSTEAD OF USING THE MM BUTTONS YOU HAVE A L. C. D. SCREEN AND THEN THERE YOU CAN U YOU CAN USE THAT AS BUTTONS
YOU CAN USE THAT AS REAL SO SO THAT COULD BE AN OPTION AS WELL
INTEGRATED WITH PUSH BUTTONS OR YOU MAY HAVE SCROLL BUTTON INSTEAD OF P JUST THE PUSH BUTTON
SO S BASICALLY THIS DEALS WITH SPECIAL USERS CHILDREN HANDICAPPED PEOPLE
AND UH YOU SEE THIS IS THE ONE WHERE YOU HAVE THE PROTECTION COVER
MM MAYBE USEFUL FOR CHILDREN THEY MIGH YOU YOU THEY ONLY SEE THE BUTTONS OUTSIDE
AND FOR ADULTS WH WHERE YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL YOU CAN SEE THE ONE INSIDE
SO THE ADULTS MIGHT WANNA HAVE A KEY TO LOCK THAT TO PR SO CHILDREN WILL NOT TOUCH THE BUTTON INSIDE
AT I SEE THAT THAT IS USEFUL FOR OLD PEOPLE AND THEN YOU DON'T GET IT LOST
BUT FOR OUR PRODUCT WE DON'T NEED A BIG ONE BECAUSE YOU HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION E EVENTUALLY WITH USE
AND THEN HE WILL BEEPS AND TO SAY THAT I AM HERE FOR EXAMPLE
IS IT POSSIBLE
UH
BUT YOU THE SEE THAT IN THE V.
THE V. APPEARS TO BE THE DOWN ARROW ON THE TOP ON THE TOP UP ARROW IF YOU UP ARROW THERE'S A V. LIKE AS AS IF IT'S TURNING DOWN SO IT'S CONFUSING INTERFACE
AND HERE ARE IS UH HERE IS A S SHORT SUMMARY THAT I SUMMARY THAT I COMPILED AFTER THE FINDINGS I FOUND
AND UH USER CUSTOMISABLE IS IMPORTANT AND FINALLY SIMPLICITY SIMPLICITY IS THE KEY
SO WI
IS UH A SMALL DEVICE THAT UH LOOKS LIKE A CUBE AND MAYBE YOU CAN JUST CHANGE THE UM THE BUTTONS
IF YOU CH TURN ONE SIDE YOU GET ONE ONE BUTTONS YOU TURN THE OTHER SIDE YOU GET THE OTHER BUTTONS
IF YOU RE USE THE EXISTING SCREEN WE ELEMENT ELIMINATE THE L. C. D.
FANCY AS FANCY AS THE ONE ON THE L. C. D. MAYBE EVEN BETTER
MORE ON A FANCY DESIGN
SO I IS SO THE THING IS YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW MUCH AN L. C. D. WILL COST AND THEN WE'LL DECIDE AGAIN
IS I IF I
AND HO
SO IF YOU WANNA CONTROL THE SCREEN D SH SHARPNESS YOU JUST SAY SHARPNESS AND THEN YOU T TURN YOU JUST PRESS LEF INCREASE OR DECREASE BUTTON AND THE SAME FOR THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL
JUST TELL YOUR CHANNEL AND THEN YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BUTTO AT THE CONTROLLER SO FINALLY THAT WIL ELIMINATES THE THE NEED FOR L. C. D.
PUT IT BACK AT THE CHARGE
TH YEAH
THAT WE CAN WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN PROGRAM A FUNCTION WHEREBY WHEN YOU PRESS THE SWITCH OFF T. V. BUTTON
THE OFF BUTTON THE REMOTE THERE BE S UH INSTRUCTION ON THE SCREEN PLEASE CHARGE CHARGE ME
YOU NEVER GET IT LOST BECAUSE UH EVERY TIME YOU'RE OFF THE COMPUTER THE T. V. YOU ARE ASKED THE THE COMMAND THE T. V. COM REMOTE CONTROLLER WOULD TELL YOU TO PUT IT BACK TO WHERE TO THE CHARGER
I THINK WE NEED TO DEFINE ALSO A S THE SET OF VOCABULARIES FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNISER
BECAUSE UH IF YOU WANT UH SAY WE CAN SORT BY CHANNELS OR SORT BY T. V. PROGRAMS YOU HAVE TO DECIDE A CATEGORY OF VOCABULARIES FOR THEM
BUT I I I THINK THAT THE USER WOULD LIKE WOU WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE THE CHANNEL OR CALL THE CHANNEL RATHER THAN THAN THE NUMBERS
SO SOME PEOPLE MAY WANT TO SAY I WANT TO SEE THIS CHANNEL
UH
SO NOW WHAT YOU DO IS F LOOKING AT THE ALL THE SIXTEEN CHANNELS AVAILABLE AT ONE TIME
YOU JUST USE THE CONTROL BUTTON UH
SO YOU YOU DON'T USE THE SPEECH RECOGNISER IN THAT WAY
WELL YOU YOU STAY A FIVE MINUTES
UM SO IN THE LAST MEETING WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN AND NOW WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
UH THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE DECIDED IN THE LAST MEETING
WE WILL OKAY
THREE
A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE EMPHASISE THE USE OF PICTURES
OR MAYBE WE CAN INCLUDE THE USER MANUAL IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WE SHOULD HAVE JUST A BUTTON LIKE HELP AND YOU SAY UH AND YOU IK YOU PRESS THE BUTTON HELP AND MAYBE YOU SEE THE THE USER M MIGHT IN THE IN THE T. V.
IF THE IF
NO IN THE CASE WHERE THEY NEED HELP IN THE CASE WHERE THEY NEED HELP
MAYBE FOR KIDS KIDS THEY LIKE UH T NO L THEY LIKE TO
WE IT'S NOT YEAH
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE OTHER BUTTONS ARE NOT NECESSARY OR IMPORTANT
SO IF HE
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO S T UH A CH YEAH BUT YOU HAVE TO TO HAVE ALL THE NAME OF THE CHANNEL IN YOUR VOCABULARY
OF CHANNEL
UH T YOU HAVE TO TRAIN YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE VOCABULARY BY YOURSELF
OR YOU HAVE TO S
OR WE CAN SWITCH ON OR SWITCH OFF THE THE SPECIAL YEAH
BUT PEOPLE ARE OFTEN ENOUGH LOOKING AT THE HELP ONCE THEY SEE THE HELP BUTTON THEY SAY OH THIS IS A COMPLICATED STUFF
AND LET US SEE WHAT THE MARKET DEMANDS
SAME REMOTE WITH SOME
WE JUST MADE AN MARKETING SURVEY OF WHAT PEOPLE NEED FROM OUR REMOTES AND HOW IT COULD BE SPECIAL FROM THE OTHER REMOTES
AND WE GOT THE BEST ON THE RESPONSES FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRES
AND WE FOUND THE FOLLOWING SOLUTIONS WHICH WE COULD WHICH WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR OUR DESIGN
IF THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY
AND FIFTY PERCENT SAY THEY USE ONLY TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS SO THE REST OF THE NINETY PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS THEY'RE NOT USED MOST OF THE TIMES
SO THIS WERE THE FINDINGS WHICH WE FOUND
AND BY THE TIME THEY FOUND THE REMOTE CONTROL THE PROGRAM IS FINISHED
AND UM IF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS TOO COMPLICATED IT TAKES MUCH TIME TO LEARN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT
SO YOU CAN JUST SEE THE PERCENTAGE
I MEAN AS OUR SURVEY SAYS THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE IF THEIR REMOTES ARE FANCY
SO IF WE HAVE A L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE RATHER THAN LOOKING ONTO THE T. V. YOU JUST LOOK INTO A REMOTE AND NAVIGATE IT
IT'S THE SAME MENU AS WE HAVE SAW THAT IPOD REMOTE CONTROL
I MEAN THIS WERE THE POINTS WHICH WE GOT FROM THE MARKET DEMANDS
UH YEAH WE HAVE UH
AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE AN VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE REMOTE CONTROLS
MM THE SCROLL BUTTON FROM THE SURVEY WE NEVER SEE THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME SCROLLING BUTTON
OR IT COULD BE LIKE THIS AS THE PEOPLE SAY IF THEY HAVE A L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE NOT ON THE TELEVISION
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE THE L. C. D. ONTO THE TELEVISION SCREEN YOU MISS THE PICTURE IN THE BACKGROUND WE ARE MOST FOCUSED ON THE COMMANDS
SO IF YOU HAVE THEN L. C. D. IN THE REMOTE YOU JUST HAVE A MENU
IN THE L. C. D. DISPLAYS AS YOU GO ON PRESSING THE MENU IT FASTER DISPLAYS VOLUME THEN THE PROGRAM THEN THE BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST AND ALL THE STUFF
ALWAYS SO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE SAY THEY LOSE THE REMOTES
AND WHEN WE'RE USING THAT T REMOTE AND IF WE MISPLACE SOMEWHERE IN THE CHARGER WE HAVE A SMALL BUTTON
AND JUST BY PRESSING THE BUTTON IN THE CHARGER THE UH REMOTE CONTROL BEEPS WHEREVER IT IS
I MEAN IT DOE IT ALSO DOESN'T REQUIRE A VOICE COMMAND BECAUSE THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH A VOICE COMMAND
IT'S AN GOOD REMINDER YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
AS WE HAVE SEEN EARLIER THE
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING IT
I MEAN UH I MEAN UH I MEAN UH YOU SEE IF IT'S LIKE THAT EVEN A KID WHO WANTS TO HAVE A CONTROL HE COULD JUST PLUG IT AND USE IT
BUT YOU CAN HAVE AN BUTTON FOR CHILD LOCK
SO JUST BY PRESSING THE BUTTON WITH SOME CODE YOU T YOU PUT A LOCK ONTO THE REMOTE SO THAT HE CAN'T USE EVEN
I THINK THESE OTHER FOUR POINTS THEY'RE THE MARKET DEMANDS AND SO IT'S FOR THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGN TO JUST THINK
YEAH I THINK IT SHOULD BE CLEARER FOR US IN THE NEXT MEETING THAT TH UH THESE COULD BE INCLUDED
YOU SEE UH IF YOU HAVE A VOICE COMMANDS AND YOU ARE S YOU ARE WATCHING A SCORE ON UH BASKETBALL SCORE OR SOMETHING
AND IF THE SCORE COMES TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE YOU'VE JUST SAY TWENTY FIVE AND SUDDENLY THE SCREEN THE CHANNEL GOES TO TWENTY FIVE
I DUNNO IT WILL BE ROUND ABOUT ONE OR TWO PERCENT
ALS MIGHT BE YOU JUST FORGOT THE CHANNEL NAME YOU KNO ONLY KNOW THE NUMBER
IF WE ARE USING THE TELEVISION IN THE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS
SAY IN THE FACTORIES OR IN THE SHOPS WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE AND THIS VOICE COMMANDS IF THEY FAIL TO WORK
SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE USED IN AN SILENT HOMELY ENVIRONMENT OR S SOMETHING
OH IT CAME THERE ON THREE MINUTES BACK SO WE ARE I THINK WE CAN JUST PRESS THE OKAY
SEE YOU ANOTHER THIRTY MINUTES
OKAY SO I THINK I WILL DO MY PRESENTATION ON THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT SO CAN YOU PLEASE UH OPEN UH
OKAY SO UH THE FIRST THING UH I HAVE DONE IS TO TO MADE A REVIEW TOGETHER WITH THE UH MANUFACTURAL UH DEPARTMENT AND HAVE WHICH COMPONENTS WAS UH AVAILABLE TO BUILD A REMOTE CONTROL
WE ALSO UM WE ALSO CAN PUT A REGULAR BATTERY IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH B UH F WELL UH I MEANT UH BY BY BATTERY I MEANT UH I WILL NOT HAVE A UH A WIRE BETWEEN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE ENERGY SOURCE BUT UH I DIDN'T FOU WE DIDN'T DECIDE YET WHICH KIND OF BATTERY
IT'S NOT A A RE UH WELL A REAL ISSUE FOR THE FROM THE TECHNICAL UH POINT OF VIEW
SO WHAT I HAVE F FOUND IS THAT I THINK BASIC BATTERY OR KINETIC UH ENERGY UH COLLECTION IS THE IS THE BETTER WAY TO PROVIDE ENERGY BECAUSE I THINK SOLAR ENERGY WI WON'T WORK IN A CLUTTERED UH UH ENVIRONMENT
FOR THE CASE UH WELL UH I THINK THAT UH TITANIUM IS UM IS A GOOD CHOICE BECAUSE IT'S TRENDY AND IT'S UH IT'S UH WELL IT'S MODERN AND UH USER ARE ARE ARE MM WILL BE UH VERY HAPPY TO HAVE A A A NICE REMOTE
FOR THE INTERFACE UH I THINK THAT WE CAN ACH ACHIEVE UH ALL THE DESIRED FUNCTIONALITIES BY S JUST UH USING UH RUBBER BUTTONS
SIMPLE BUTTONS AND TH THUS THIS ALLOW TO USE A REGULAR CHIP THAT ARE UH WELL CHEAPER
AND S SO UH WE CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE
IT'S MORE CONFOG F COMFORTABLE THAT IF THESE UH IT'S COMPLETELY FLAT
YEAH AND BY WELL BY JUST BY MOVING THE AR UH YOUR ARM THE MM WELL THE REMOTE WILL UH ACCUMULATE ENERGY
BUT I D I DON'T KNOW IT'S IF IT IS FEASIBLE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YET IF IF THE USER WILL MOVE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THE REMOTE UM ALL THE NECESSARY ENERGY
SO UH YOU'RE RIGHT WE CAN UH SEE IN OUR UH R. AND D. UH IF THE KINETIC METAL IS SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE ENOUGH ENERGY
S A GOOD IDEA
WELL I I THINK YOU IT'S IT'S IT'S FINE YOU HAVE UH REVIEWED ALL ALL THE POSSIBILITIES BUT UH UH WELL UH I IF WE CONSIDER THAT UH THE USER INTERFACE IS DISPLAYED ON THE T. V. SCREEN I DON'T THINK WE NEE UH WE NEED MUCH BUTTONS IN THE REMOTE SINCE WE WE JUST HAVE TO NAVIGATE AND TO HAVE A OKAY OR ENTER KEY OR THINGS LIKE THAT
ON THE T. V. SCREEN
ON THE T. V. SCREEN THE UH HOW TO USE YOUR REMOTE
UH YEAH
IT'S YEAH OF COURSE IT'S FANCY TRENDY AND SO ON BUT IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE AND IT'S NOT REALLY
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU PLAY WITH THE IPOD YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG SCREEN IN FRONT OF YOU S
SO I TH I I WELL I THINK WE WE CAN FOCUS ON THE UH ON THE FANCY LOOK ON THE UH
ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IF THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE BUT WELL I THINK L. C. D. WILL UH WILL UH MAKE US SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR NOT SO BIG RESULTS
WELL UH COMPARED TO THE TO S THE SIMPL SIMPLER SIMPLEST BUTTON
YEAH I I I THINK THAT UH WELL UH AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE IN THE PRESENTATION UH WELL UH ABOUT UH UH FIFTY PERCENT OF THE OF THE PERCENT N CHOOSE THE BUTTON SO UH I THINK TO HAVE UH FIVE UH SIMPLE BUTTON IS SUFFICIENT FOR OUR FUNCTIONALITY
BUT THE UH THE THING IS IS I IS THAT WE CAN ADD A FUNCTIONALITY ON THE ON THE T. V. SCREEN LIKE UH A A LIST OF FUNCTION AND THEN YOU CHOOSE WITH THE WITH THE BUTTON TO WELL YOU NAVIGATE AND YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TO SWITCH TO A CHANNEL TO ANOTHER UH
YEAH BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE L. C. D. YOU YOU DON'T LOOK AT THE T. V. SCREEN SO I I IT'S NOT REALLY WORTH TO GET TO HAVE THE IMAGE IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT
WELL SO WE WE CAN THINK ABOUT A WELL A A VOCAL COMMAND LIKE UH FIND AND WHEN THE REMOTE CONTROL UH HEARS FINE WELL YEAH JUST UH TO MAKE HIM BEEP OR T
WELL WE CAN THINK ABOUT UH HAVING UH ON THE ON THE ON THE USER INTERFACE WHEN YOU SWITCH ON THE T. V. YOU CAN UH WELL WRITE A CODE OR CHOOSE A CATEGORY
SO FOR MY PART I WILL CHECK THE PRICES THE UM THE PRICES DIFFERENCE UH OF WHAT TO USE WHERE TO USE AND S UH AND SO ON
WELL I THINK WE CAN WE CAN HAVE JUST NUMBERS FOR CHANNELS AND YOU CAN SAY TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL LIKE UH SPORTS AND THEN ON THE T. V. YOU HAVE A LIST WITH WITH UH UH WELL WITH SPORTS PROGRAM PLAYING NOW AND AND UH
WELL BUT WELL E EVERY POSSIBLE WORD UH HAS A PROBABILITY TO COME ABOUT OF THE T. V. SO
IF IF THERE IS UH MORE THAN ONE PERSON WHO IS WATCHING T. V. THE S WELL THE THE SPEECH UH R RECOGNISER SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO
BECAUSE UH I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A YOUNG CHILD WITH MY SISTER WE YEAH WE ALWAYS WANT TO W TO WATCH DIFFERENT EMISSION AT THE AT THE SAME TIME SO IT'S A PR IT COULD BE A PROBLEM IF UH IF WELL IF SOMEONE PASSES BY WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING T. V. AND SAY OH T. V. THIRTY AND JUST RUN
S
SO I SEE YA
ME TOO
IT'S A SHEEP
UH
UH
WELL UH YOU CAN GUESS WHAT IT IS I HOPE
WITH AN E.
YOU CAN TRY OUT THE ERASER NOW
AND WHICH YOU DON'T USE
YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE IT TO
BUT IF IF IT'S IF IT'S INTERNATIONAL YOU SHOULD UH LOOK IN THINK IN BRITAIN THEY HAVE UH DIFFERENT THINGS THEY CAN DO WITH THE T. V.
OR SO UH THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE
I DUNNO IF YOU SHOULD UH TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION OR THAT YOU JUST SHOULD AIM FOR THE NORMAL T. V. S THAT UH
BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE A NEW TELEVISION AND C IF YOU LOOK INTO THE FUTURE THEN THEY WANT WILL WANT THE BUTTON IF THEIR THING IS BROKE
NO THE YEAH
ME TOO
I'D UH LIKE TO WELCOME YOU TO OUR FIRST MEETING
MY NAME IS AND UH I HOPE YOU WILL INTRODUCE YOURSELF UH IN A FEW MINUTES AS WILL I
UH THERE WILL BE TIME FOR DISCUSSION
UM AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE NOTICED THERE ARE LITTLE BLACK UH FIELDS ON THE TABLE
UM YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR LAPTOP EXACTLY IN THAT FIELD SO THE LITTLE CAMERAS CAN SEE YOUR FACE
EVERYWHERE AROUND THE ROOM ESPECIALLY HERE FOR YOUR FACE OF COURSE AND THIS ISN'T A PIE
UM WELL UH I SAID I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER AND UH I'M HOPING UH FOR A GOOD PROJECT AND UH I'D LIKE TO HEAR UH WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOUR FUNCTIONS ARE UH ON THIS PROJECT
LET'S START WITH THE LADIES
UM WELL I SAID UH WE'RE WORKING ON A PROJECT AND THE AIM FOR THE PROJECT IS TO TO CREATE A TO DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL WHICH UH HAS TO BE ORIGINAL
AS YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THESE PHASES CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS NAMELY INDIVIDUAL WORK PART AND A MEETING WHERE WE WILL DISCUSS UH OUR WORK SO FAR
I ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES BUT THEY ARE NOT OF UH MUCH USE TO US
UH
AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN GIVE A PRESENTATION ON THEM
UM AS YOU ALSO NOTICED UH THIS PRESENTATION DOCUMENT IS IN OUR UH PROJECT FOLDER AND EVERY DOCUMENT YOU PUT IN THIS FOLDER UH IS UH IT IS POSSIBLE TO SHOW THAT HERE IN OUR MEETING ROOM
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE SAME TOOL BAR UH AS IS LOCATED HERE
UM THE MOST FUNCTIONS UH WE WILL USE WILL BE TO TO ADD A NEW PAGE
UM UH TO GO BACK AND FORWARD BETWEEN PAGES AND OF COURSE UH TO SAVE IT EVERY NOW AND THEN
LIKE THIS IF EVERYTHING'S OKAY BUT I FIRST HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE PEN YOU SEE I'M NEW TO IT TOO
AS YOU CAN SEE YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT A LITTLE BIT SLOW IT'S NOT SUCH A FAST BOARD IT'S A SMART BOARD BUT ALSO A SLOW BOARD
FOR INSTANCE TAKE A BLUE ONE AND UH CHANGE THE LINE WIDTH LIKE TO FIVE
IT'S ALSO TO GETS TO KNOW EACH OTHER BECAUSE UM I'M ASKING THREE THINGS UH FOR THAT UH DRAWING TO DO IT ON A BLANK SHEET
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD GUESS WHAT I'M DRAWING EH
MAYBE WHEN I PUT ON
AND THOSE ARE SLOW
AND I HOPE OUR PROJECT GROUP WILL NOT BE SLOW BUT WE WILL UH WORK TO A GOOD RESULT AND DO IT UH AS FAST AS WE CAN
AND WE'RE HOPING FOR A AIM OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS AND UH WE ARE HOPING TO ACHIEVE THAT UH BY AIMING FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET
MAYBE FOR WHICH MARKET SEGMENTS SHOULD WE AIM OR SHOULD WE AIM FOR ALL SEGMENTS
WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE IT FUN
SO MAYBE A A MINIMALIST DESIGN THE LEAST UH POSSIBLE AMOUNT UH OF BUTTONS
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY NEED MANY BUTTONS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF THEIR SEAT
UM AS YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENT ROLES HAVE UH DIFFERENT TASKS
IS IT MY LAPTOP
AH WELL THAT'S GOOD FIVE MINUTES AND UH THE MEETING'S OVER UH RIGHT ON SCHEDULE
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER WILL WORK OUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
OKAY WELL I THINK THEN WE HAVE TO HEAD UH BACK TO OUR OFFICES AND UH START WORKING
OKAY WELL UH SEE YOU ALL IN ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES THEN
OKAY UH I'M UH I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND I UH HOPE TO UH LOOK FORWARD TO UH A VERY UH PLEASING UH END OF THIS UH PROJECT
A BE
THE HELL
MAKE THAT CUTE
B
PEN
A LOT OF BUTTONS WHICH YOU DON'T USE OR WHO YOU DON'T USE COMPLEX
UH
UH FOR THE USE OF DIFFERENT UH DEVICES
YEAH BUT YOU COULD UH I THIN UH THERE'S A POSSIBILITY TO G UH TO UH
TO PUT THOSE BUTTONS UH BEHIND SOME UH KIND OF UH PROTECTION SO THAT IF Y Y YOU ONLY GET TO SEE THEM WHEN YOU NEED 'EM
THAT'S POSSIBLE SO THAT YOU ONLY GET THE NO N N NO
JUST UH FOR EXAMPLE YOU GOT TH UH THE SAME SIZE UH REMOTE CONTROL YOU USE EVERYDAY
BUT UM THE USUAL BUTTONS SUCH AS UH UM ZAPPING UH AS YOU CALL IT IN DUTCH
BUT UH NOT UH THE BUTTONS USED TO SEARCH ON THE THE CHANNELS ON YOUR TELEVISION
YOU ONLY USE THOSE UH THE FIRST TIME OR
UH
UH
WHEN I THINK OF IT UH I THINK THE MAIN IDEA UH OF THIS REMOTE REMOTE CONTROL IS UH
YOU DON'T HAVE TO INTEGRATE THE BUTTONS TO SEARCH THE CHANNELS ON YOUR TELEVISION
IN THOSE IN THAT
YEAH BUT I BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UH TO ACCOMMODATE UH ACCOMMODATE UH ALL THE BUTTONS ON THE S ON THE DIFFERENCE DIFFERENT TELEVISIONS SETS ON ONE REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE UH FOR EXAMPLE SONY TELEVISION UH HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO S TO MAKE UH UH TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR TO SEE ON ONE SIDE OF THE SCREEN UH TELETEXT
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE UH JUST N UH REGULAR TELEVISION
UH
YEAH BUT UH THEY DON'T USE THE SAME SIGNAL UH ON REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE A PANASONIC UH REMOTE CONTROL ON A ON A PHILIPS TELEVISION
BUT UH I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE UH TH UH WILL BUY THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE BECAUSE UH THE FIRST THEY LOST THE ONE THEY LOST FIRST ONE OR THE FIRST ONE IS BROKEN
SO UH UH PERHAPS THEY HAVE A GOT A AN OLDER TELEVISION SO THAT OPTION IS NOT UH OPTIONAL FOR THOSE UH PEOPLE
OH MM NO
NO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE WORKING DESIGN AND THE IN UH USABILITY INTERACTION YEAH OKAY
MY JOB IS IN THE COMPANY TO PROMOTE COMPANY OR PROMOTE PRODUCTS TO THE CUSTOMERS
SO I ALSO H HOPE WE HAVE A PLEASANT UH WORKING WITH UH WITH EACH OTHER
S
EASY TO R UH TO
OH UH
ON AND OFF
ELDERLY P EL ELDERLY YOUNG PEOPLE SO
I THINK THE AIM IS BETTER TO USE UH THE WHOLE WORLD AND BRITAIN YEAH
YEAH TH IT IT'S I THINK THAT'S NOT
I THINK N M N MOST TELEVISIONS NOWADAYS DO THIS
YEAH BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE THE THIS ALWAYS WITH R UNIVERSAL REMOTES YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE THE CODE
YOU CAN USE WHICH WHICH TYPE OF TELEVISION YOU HAVE
THERE IS SOMETHING TURNING
YEAH I'VE GOT IT THERE TOO
SHALL I GO UH NEXT
UH I DID THIS BY UH LOOKING AT EXAMPLES OF OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS OF HOW THEY UH THEY LOOK AND INFORMATION FROM THE WEB THAT I FOUND
UM WELL WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT UH TH THE ACTUAL USE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO TELEVISION SET
HOW YOU UH D WHAT YOU DESCRIBED UH JUST EARLY
AND THIS CAN BE ALL SORTS OF MEDSA MESSAGES TURN IT ON TURN IT OFF UH CHANGE THE CHANNEL ADJUST VOLUME THAT KIND OF THING
UH PLAY VIDEO TELETEXT BUT ALSO T UH PLAY C. D. IF YOU USE IT YOUR C. D. PLAYER THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL THAT ONE
THE ONE HAS GOT ALL THE FUNCTIONS THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY NEED AND AN LOT OF UH BUTTONS ETCETERA
AND UH NOT N ALL THE THE THE THE STUFF YOU CAN DO WITH IT BUT UH THE THE ESSENTIAL STUFF IS THERE
A LOT OF BUTTONS THEY MAY THINK FROM I DON'T NEED S AS MUCH AS THAT
UH WELL PERF PERSONAL PREFERENCES IS IS UH A SIMPLE REMOTE WITH UH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS THAT YOU CAN NEED THAT YOU COULD USE
BUT UH KEEP IN MIND THE NEW FUNCTIONS OF T. V. WHAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER SPLIT SCREEN AND UH IS THAT A FUNCTION THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE
AND THEN UH MAKE IT I WOULD MAKE SO THAT YOU CAN COULD UH USE IT ON MORE THAN ONE APPLIANCE
IF YOU HAVE ONE THAT UH UH DOES WITH THE VI THE THE VIDEO
YOU MUST STILL HAVE IT OPEN
OR WITH ONE UH D CHE ONLY THE T. V.
WELL UH UH YES YES S SH A BUTTON WHERE YOU CAN UH CHANGE FROM ONE NUMBER TO TWO NUMBERS
S
YEAH SO YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT ONE ON
AN
SO YOU CAN ADJUST WHICH BUTTONS YOU WANT ON THAT S SCREEN
BUT HE ALSO SAID THAT WE SHOULD NOT ONLY FOCUS ON THE YOUNGER PEOPLE
BUT ALSO ON THE OLDER AND WILL THEY USE IT IF IT ONLY HAS AN L. C. D. SCREEN
OH SO STILL A LITTLE BIT PEOPLE
AN YES
BUT SHOULDN'T YOU PUT A BUTTON OF FOR TELETEXT ON THE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE IT
YEAH THEY ARE LESS IMPORTANT BUT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE THERE OR NOT
THAT YOU HAVE T FIRST YOU HAVE TO TURN THE REMOTE ON AND THEN YOU CAN UH I DON'T KNOW
NEE THAT'S THAT'S UH YEAH
YEAH B WHEN THE BATTERIES ARE LOW
BUT YOU'LL ALSO FORGET TO PUT IT IN BECAUSE YOU THROW IT ON THE COUCH AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER
WELL I THINK THE BATTERIES SHOULD SHOULD W SHOULD WORK A LOT LONGER THAN A COUPLE OF DAYS OR NOT
BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TO S HAVE SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN PUT A REMO RECHARGER NEAR YOUR COUCH BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO WALK A LONG WAY WHEN YOU TWOFT WANT TO TURN ON THE T. V.
I THINK EVERYTHING HAS IT FOR AND I GUESS
BUT THEY WANT TO TALK INTO THE REMO REMOTE CONTROL OR SOMETHING OR
OH BUT DO WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT THAT OR
UH
WELL IF IT COULD BE DONE WE
WELL YOU SH YOU SHOULD TO ADJUST THE THING
AND YOU HAVE TO SPEAK THE SO THAT IT CAN UNDERSTAND
YOU COULD USE THAT N AS AN OPTION IF YOU HAVE MONEY LEFT OR SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT THAT BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT TELETEXT NOT REALLY IMPORTANT BUT YEAH THE SHORTCUT AND YOU CAN'T GO TO SPORT
OR THAT YOU CAN PUT 'EM ON UH ON ON WIDE AND YEAH
BUT THAT SHOULD ALSO BE A SUB THEN A SUB UH MENU THING
YEAH SO THE FIRST YOU SEE THE MAIN AND THE OTHER ONES YOU CAN UH GO TO UH
OH BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTONS
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD YOU'D THROW THEM ON ON IN ONE PILE
ON THE REMOTE
SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY NORMAL BUTTONS THAT UH NO ALRIGHT
YET ON AND OFF IS P IS PERHAPS YOU KNO
OH WELL YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SET WHICH T. V. YOU HAVE
BUT ISN'T IDEA TO USE UH UH WHAT YOU SAID UH NORMAL ON AND OFF BUTTON FOR THE T. V. THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE A
YEAH BUT BUT NOT FOR THE REMOTE BUT FOR THE T. V. THAT YOU USE
BUT A NOT AS NORMAL BUTTON IN THE L. C. D. YEAH
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S HANDY TO HAVE A N A NORMAL ON BUTTON
A R JUST UH RUBBER UH FOR FOR T. V. SO YOU CAN TURN IT ON AND THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE THE CHANNEL
TO TURN IT ON
WELL I I GUESS IF YOU USE THE L. C. D. SCREEN YOU FIRST HAVE TO SEARCH WHERE IS THE ON BUTTON
THEN YOU UH YOU YOU THEN TURN IT AND THEN THE T. V. GOES ON
BUT IF YOU HAVE A NORMAL ON BUTTON ON THE ON THE REMOTE THEN YOU DO THE ON AND THEN YOU SEARCH THE CHANNEL WHICH YOU WANT
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
THE OPENING WHICH WE ARE DOING NOW UM AND THE SPECIAL NOTE I'M PROJECT MANAGER BUT ON THE MEETINGS I'M ALSO THE SECRETARY
WHICH MEANS I WILL MAKE UH MINUTES AS I DID OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING
AND UH I ALSO PUT THESE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE IN THE UH PROJECT FOLDER SO YOU CAN SEE THEM AND REVIEW WHAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED
BUT I THINK WE WILL NEED IT
IS THERE AN ORDER
I. E. E. I. E. OKAY
YEAH IT'S A LITTLE BUG IT'S IN THE IN THE SMART BOARD
THEN I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING THAT I MADE A SEPARATE SLIDE OF THEM SO YOU CAN
OH WELL NOT IN THIS PRESENTATION
WHICH MEANS THAT OUR UH CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEW DESIGN
OKAY SO L. C. D. IT IS
YEAH AND MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE SOMETHING FANCY OUT OF AN L. C. D. REMOTE BECAUSE IT'S NEW AS FAR AS I KNOW
OKAY WHAT ELSE DOES OUR REMOTE NEED
ON THE SCREEN
BUT WOULD IT BE USEFUL TO IMPLE IMPLEMENT BOTH
ON ONE REMOTE
SO NO SPEECH RECOGNITION
WELL I'VE WRITTEN DOWN AN AN ON OR OFF BUTTON VOLUME SELECTION CHANNEL SELECTION UH THE DIGITS FROM ONE TO ZERO HUH
AND UH THE POSSIBILITY TO UH ENLARGE BUTTONS OR TO HAVE LARGE BUTTONS
OKAY BUT NO MORE BUTTONS OR FUNCTIONS OR
AND A SEE THROUGH UH
OKAY BUT WE CAN WORK THAT OUT LATER I GUESS
YEAH BUT ON THE L. C. D. HUH
WELL MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A SEPARATE BUTTON APART FROM THE L. C. D. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TURN IT ON WHEN THE L. C. D. IS OFF
THERE HAS TO BE A ON BUTTON ON THE REMOTE HUH
AND THEN THE TELEVISION IS ON ALSO OR JUST THE REMOTE
POSTPONE FURTHER DISCUSSION TO UH OUR NEXT MEETING BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME
I WILL UH WRITE UH MINUTES IF I CAN CREATE THEM OUT OF THIS
SEND
IT'S POSSIBLY VERY HANDY IF YOU WANT TO UH DESIGN ONE OF THOSE
WELL SO IT BASICALLY WORKS UH AS I UH UH R WROTE DOWN UH IN THIS UH LITTLE UH SUMMARY
ON A LITTLE PRINT PLATE UH WHICH UH MAKES UH UH A CONNECTION THAT UH
UM UH THE THE CHIP UH MAKES A MORSE CODE UH LIKE UH SIGNAL WHICH UH THEN IS SI UH SIGNALLED TO UH SEVERAL TRANSISTORS WHICH MAKES UH WHICH SENDS THE SIGNAL TO A LITTLE LET
YOU KNOW WHAT A LET IS
UH WHICH HAS A SENSOR IN IT TO UH SENSE UH THE SIGNAL OF THE INFRA RED
UH IT IS PIS UH IT'S POSSIBLE TO UH MAKE THEM IN MASS PRODUCTION BECAUSE IT IS AS EAS IT IS AS EASY AS UH PRINTING A PAGE
UH JUST UH FIBREGLASS PLATE UM IS B UH IS UH COVERED WITH UH SOME UH COATINGS AND UH UH
WE DON'T HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW REMOTE CONTROLS UH HAVE TO WORK OR UH HOW THAT HOW UH TO MAKE SOME CHIPS THAT ARE POSSIBLE TO UH TO TO TRANSMIT THOSE UH SIGNALS
UH
UH WELL THE SUB COMPONENT I SUPPOSE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT A SUB COMPONENT IS IS F IN THIS EXAMPLE IT'S THE BUTTON
UH WHEN IT IS PRESSED DOWN UM THE SWITCH IS TER IS UH IS SWITCHED ON
SO WITH UH THE WIRE IS SENT TO THE TO THE CHIP IN UH CO OPERATION WITH THE BATTERY OF COURSE
BECAUSE TO MAKE UH A A SIGNAL POSSIBLE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF UH
LI UH A D AD UH ELECTRONIC UH
UM W AFTER IT'S BEING COMPOSED BY THE CHIP UH THE SIGNAL UH IS TRANSPORTED UH TO THE INFRA RED BULB
AND FROM THERE IT SIGNALS A MORSE CODE LIKE SIGNAL TO THE TO THE B TO THE BULB IN UH IN THE TELEVISION SET
S UH I WROTE DOWN SOME PERSONAL PREFERENCES ABOUT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL
OR JUST IS IT'S IT'S VERY LIGHT TO UH TO MAKE UH TO USE IT
BUT I SUPPOSE THAT THE ONE OF THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS UH UH THOUGHT OF THAT UH TOO
AND IT IS POSSIBLE FOR SEVERAL DESIGNS AND UM EASY TO USE B UH SORRY EASY TO USE BUTTONS
UH SO THE NUMBERS ON THE BUTTONS ARE NOT POSSIBLE UH TO READ ANYMORE
AND UH WELL AS I SAID UH BEFORE TH UH WE CAN UH MAKE SEVERAL DESIGNS
TWO OF THESE THIS MEETING
UH L. C. D. SCREEN AS IN UH TOUCH SCREEN
UH YEAH
TWO S TWO TWO DIGITS OH OKAY
SO D UH WH THE PHILIP'S TELEVISION MAKES IT POSSIBLE IN THAT INDEED TO UH PRESS ONE AND THEN TWO TO MAKE UH THE UH TJ TO REACH CHANNEL TWELVE
BUT UH ALL THE TELEVISION MAKES UH USE OF THOSE BUTTON WHERE YOU FIRST PRESS THAT BUTTON AND THEN PRESS TWO DIGITS TO UH TO GET
UH YEAH THINK SO
WELL UM IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN UH HOW WAS THE INFORMATION
YEAH BUT UH WILL WE NOT UH
IS IT POSSIBLE TO FIND OUT ANYWAY
NO AN L. C. D. SCREEN'S JUST LIKE UH LIKE A DRAWN HERE
UM JUST UH DISPLAYS SEVERAL BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE UM IF YOU WANTED THE MINIMAL UH USE B UH BUTTONS
YOU JUST H UH DISPLAYS FOUR BUTTONS ON THE SCREEN AND IT'S POSSIBLE TO P UH PRESS THEM DOWN JUST LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN
WELL I SUPPOSE WI IF THE MAR IF OUR UM
IF THE I IF THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN L. C. D. SCREENS WE SHOULD MAKE 'EM
AND IF THAT IS OUR D UH MARKET SHARE TO UH AND OUR GOAL TO UH DELIVER THOSE UH REMOTE CONTROLS
I HOPE WE UH H AND LET'S HOPE TO REACH THOSE UH THOSE SALES
YEAH CAN YOU UM UH S I THINK THAT THAT THEY WILL SEND YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT UH THE COST OF L. C. D. UH SCREENS
UH CAN YOU POST IT IN THE OR SHOULDN'T WE POST THAT IN UH OUR PROJECTS MAIL UH FOLDER
TO NOT USE BATTERIES AND USE AC UH BAT UH BATTERIES TO UH TO BE YEAH YEAH SURE
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL TO UM
UH
AND GO TO STANDBY MODE WHEN YOU DON'T USE IT SO THAT
NO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH S UH W UH WATCHING YOUR TELEVISION YOU HAVE TO PUT IT
YEAH JUST JUST A CABLE OR A EVEN A A A A A CHARGER WHERE YOU CAN MOUNT IT ON
SO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO NOT UH DISPLAY UH A BUTTON AT TEN POINTS UH OR
BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK AT UH UH PERHAPS UH FORTY BUTTONS AT A SCREEN BUT THE ELDERLY ONLY LOOK AT TWO BUTTONS
WELL SPREAD IT BY A BIG MARKET
WELL LET'S LEAVE OUT ALL THE REMOTE CONTROLS AND JUST PUT A MICROPHONE ON TOP OF THE TELEVISION TO
OKAY WELL THAT SHOULD IT HAS TO BE REMOTE CONTROL NOT
LET'S HOPE UH TO HAVE SOME UH D
Y IT SHOULD BE DONE
THAT'S NOT SO DIFFICULT AT ALL BECAUSE I ALREADY USE ON SEVERAL VOICE OPERATED SYSTEMS AND THEY ARE ALL POSSIBLE TO UH NOT ALL BUT
UH YEAH
UH
UH
MENU
THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS DEPENDING UH ON WHAT KIND OF TELEVISION YOU GOT
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T GOT A WIDE SCREEN TELEVISION YOU DON'T NEED THE UH THE SCREEN SETTINGS UH FOR UH
YEAH AND IF THE TELEVISION DOES NOT SUPPORT SUCH UH OPERATIONS
I BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT A LOT A DEVI YEAH A DEVICE SELF S G
OKAY SO USE UH VERY UH LOT OF PEO
YEAH SURE OF COURSE YOU NEED UH A SETTINGS BUTTON UH OR A SETTINGS OPTION FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
WH UH WHY WOULD IT BE A A NEED TO HAVE A NORMAL BUTTON
I THINK IT LOOKS A LOT MORE FANCY IF YOU USE UH IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTONS ON THE S ON ON REMOTE CONTROL
E. I. E.
TO THIS MEETING
WE'RE GOING TO J DISCUSS THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE REMOTE THAT M THAT MEANS THAT FUNCTIONS USER N WANT TO HAVE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL OR JUST
THE METHODS I I PREFER IS WE'RE GOING TO LOOK WHICH SECTION OF THE USERS WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS A L ON MORE
ARE THE YOUNGER PEOPLE GOING TO BUY THE REMOTE CONTROL OR THE ELDERLY PEOPLE
AND THEN THO THAT SECTION WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS AND ADJUST THE REMOTE MORE TO THAT SECTION THAN THE WHOLE USER
AND WE POSSESS ABOUT TWO THIRD OF THE MARKET FROM IN THAT RANGE OF AGE
THE ELDERLY PEOPLE FROM FORTY FIVE YEARS TO SIXTY FIVE YEARS ARE NOT THAT MUCH INTERESTED IN FEATURES
AND WE POSSESS LESS THAN TWO THIRD THAT'S TWO FIFTH OF THE MARKET SHARE IN THAT AREA
GOED SO
SO THE BUTTONS SH SHOULD BE THAT SMALL OR SHOULDN'T BE THAT COMPLEX BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THE BUTTONS WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING TO USE
REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO HAVE TO HAVE A LOW POWER USAGE BECAUSE S W
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS ONLY ZAP ONE TIME AN HOUR SO THE POWER USAGE IS ALSO ONE ONE TIME AN HOUR
OR SO WITH A HIGH POWER USAGE WE WOULD
USE A LOT OF BUT BATTERIES
THE VOLUME BUTTON AND THE CHANNEL BUTTONS ARE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL SO THOSE THEY THOSE HAVE TO H BE FIND VERY EASILY
IT HAS ALSO BE HAVE TO FIND EASILY WHEN THE LABEL IS GONE
MY COLLEAGUE ALSO ANNOUNCED IT THAT LABELS SHOULD BE SCRATCHED OFF OR WOULD BE S UH
ON THE REMOTE
OR SHOULD BE COVERED OR IN L. C. D. SCREEN
PUT ONE OPTION AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ALL THE BUTTONS OF THAT OPTIONS SO THE OTHER OPTIONS WOULD BE GONE
AND YOU DON'T SEE THE BUTTONS
AND THE OLDER PEOPLE SPEND MORE MONEY AND EASILY ON A REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND TO TO FOCUS NOT A LOT NOT THAT MUCH ON THE YOUNGER PEP YOUNGER PEOPLE BUT ALSO SOMEWHAT ON THE ELDERLY PEOPLE
AND ON MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES I DON'T HAVE ANY MO MORE TIME TO COME WITH THAT BUT LIKE I SAID
L. C. D. SCREEN IS EASILY TO USE BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOU CAN IMPLEMENT A LOT OF BUTTONS IN ONE REMOTE WITH NOT THAT MUCH BUTTONS
YEAH THE BASICS THEN BY A VOLUME CHANNEL ONE TILL TWO ZERO NUMBERS ON IT OH TELETEXT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT A BUTTON WITH A S S WHAT WHICH ESPECIALLY DO THAT BECAUSE SOME T. V. S
IF YOU PRESS THE T ONE AND THEN THE TWO IT BE BETWEEN FIVE SECS IT MAKE TWELVE AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT RELAXED
TO USER
FORTIES OKAY BECAUSE BECAUSE YOUNGER PEOPLE AS
FROM TWENTY SIX TO THIRTY FIVE HAVE SIXTY SIX PERCENT AND THIRTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE FIFTY FIVE PERCENT SO I THINK TO UM
BECAUSE ON MOST RECOG REMOTE CONTROLS UM THE PRINT PLATE WILL BE BROKEN HOW MUCH TWO YEARS
YOU HAVE TO PRESS H VERY HARD TO GO TO THE NEXT CHANNEL
AND IF THE ONLY F
YOU PRESS AUDIO ON THE TOUCHSCREEN AND YOU GET THE BUTTONS FOR AUDIO SETTINGS SO THE OTHER BUTTONS ARE GONE
UM S FORTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE THIRTY THREE PERCENT AND SIXTY FIFTY SIX TO SIXTY FIVE TWELVE PERCENT
BUT OUR OUR OUR WHAT'S IT PROJECT REQUIREMENTS ARE THE NEW PRODUCTS SHOULD BE REACHED FOR NEW MARKETS TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN FORTY
YEAH I I IF IT YEAH IF IT COSTS GETS TOO MUCH TOO EXPENSIVE THEN YEAH WE SHOULD BE STICKING TO RUBBER BUTTONS
N NOTHING NO COSTS AT ALL
YEAH IN
THA I L I IT'LL LOOK FANCY WITH L. C. D. SCREEN
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ON A F ON AN ON AN UH REMOTE CONTROL ARE CHANNEL SELECTION VOLUME CON SELECTION
OTHER THINGS ARE
YEAH BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANY COSTS NOW SO YEAH
YEAH E E POWER SUPPLY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS
I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT THAT EASY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WILL LIKE IT WHO WHO UH THAT YOU HAVE TO TURN IT ON FIRST AND THEN USE IT
SO I THINK IT'S BETTER WHEN TH THE T. V. SHUTS DOWN THE REMOTE SHUTS DOWN
AND THEN B THAT UH BEFORE AN HOUR WHEN ITS GET AGAIN GETS EMPTY
THEN YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO RECHARGE IT OF PUT IT IN A RECHARGER
UH
OR WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE BATTERIES LAST COUPLE OF DAYS WHEN THEY'RE RECHARGED
YEAH YOU MADE A POINT THERE
PLUG IT IN THAT'S IT
THAT'S AN ALSO NINETY ONE PERCENT SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE
IS THIS ONLY WOULD YOU WOULD YOU PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
NO I THINK I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE L. L. C. D. SCREEN BECAUSE IN THE AREA OF TW THIRTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE
WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET SHARE IN IN OUR HANDS AND FIFTY FIVE OF THOSE PEOPLE WANT L. C. D. SCREEN AND THIRTY FIVE WANT SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH IF THE COSTS AL ALLOW IT
NEE
BECAUSE THEN I THINK IN CHINESE IS DIFFERENT WRITTEN VOLUME IS DIFFERENT WRITTEN THAN UM SWAHILI OR SOMETHING
I THINK WE SHOULD WE COULD THAT WE COULD ALSO IMPLEMENT A AUDIO SETTINGS SCREEN SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS BUT AS SUB MENUS
D MAINLY IF YOU TURN THE UH REMOTE CONTROL ON YOU HAVE TO U YOU HAVE TO SEE FROM ONE TILL ZERO CHANNEL AND VOLUME
AND IF YOU WANT TO USE TELETEXT SCREEN OR AUDIO THEN YOU CAN PRESS IT
YEAH BUT S
UH NO
SO THOSE FOUR AND OF COURSE THE MAIN
YEAH IF UH
NO YOU DON'T YU A NO YOU THEN YOU DON'T NO NI DON'T THEN YOU DON'T USE IT
SO YOU LEAVE IT ALONE
YEAH SEE THROUGH VERSION
PRESS MENU THEN YOU HAVE UH MAIN UH MENU SEARCH UH ALL THE ALL THE SETTINGS
UM I THINK B BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS ON THE ONE SCREEN
I THINK THE BUTTONS YEAH BUT BUT OR LIKE YOU HAVE YOU ONLY HAVE CHANNEL BUTTON OR VOLUME BUTTON
THOSE BUTTONS YOU CAN YOU CAN
YEAH TH
MAYBE ONLY THE ON AND O ON AND OFF BUTTON
TH THAT'S THE I THINK THAT'S A BEST THING IS THAT TO IMPLEMENT THAT ONE IN THE MENU WITH THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL
A TELEVISION DON'T HAVE TO BE ON THAT ONE YOU CAN PRESS ON YEAH STAND BY
THEN PRESS ON REMOTE PRESS ON AND THEN T. V. SHOULD BE AVAILABLE
YEAH BUT I THINK THE RE THE REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU PRESS TAP THE SCREEN
IT ALWAYS SHOULD JUMP TO THE SCREEN WHICH HAS THE VOLUME BUTTON CHANNEL BUTTON AND OF COURSE OF ALSO THE ON AND OFF BUTTON
AND UH UH WE UH DETERMINED THAT WILL NOT BE NO BUTTONS BUT ONLY AN L. C. D. SCREEN SO I HAD TO UH LOOK ON THAT
AND THIS IS THAT UH UM UH UH YOU YOU ASK YOU GIVE A QUESTION THROUGH THROUGH THE DEVICE AND IT ANSWERS YOU
AND THEY ALREADY UH PUT THIS IN AN IN A COFFEE MAKER
AND SO THAT IT YOU SAY UH GOOD MORNING UH COFFEE MAKER AND IT SAYS T SAYS TO YOU BACK GOOD MORNING JOE OR WHAT'S YOUR NAME
UM PERHAPS IT'S USEFUL PERHAPS FOR BECAUSE PEOPLE UM LOSE THE REMOTE THEY CAN YELL UH REMOTE WHERE ARE YOU AND CALLS OR SOMETHING
I THOUGHT I FORGOT SOMETHING BUT UH
AND I THOUGHT THE THE BUTTON FOR TELETEXT APAR UH APART BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY OPTIONS I THINK
AND UH THE L. C. D. UH SOMEWHERE ON THE REMOTE
AND NOT CHOOSE WITH UH THIS KIND OF UH AND YOU COULD PUT IN A AN A REALLY S LITTLE SCROLLING DEVICE ON THE SIDE OF YOUR UH REMOTE
PERHAPS YOU COULD FIND SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE
BIT LIKE THIS KIND OF RUBBER
WHICH UH THEN YOU CAN FIT THE L. C. D. SCREEN IN IT AND CAN DECIDE UH
YEAH IT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BIT S BIT S BIT YEAH
OOH
BUT IF YOU PU NOW YOU CAN PUT YOUR HAND THERE AND THEN YOU WON'T TOUCH THE SCREEN
BUT NOT ON THE SCREEN BECAUSE YEAH THAT'S UH THAT'S AN IDEA
Y YOU COULD INCLUDE A PEN
I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW LARGE THE ACTUAL REMOTE SHOULD BE BUT A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS OR SOMETHING
BUT IT SHOULD BE TH I THINK NORMAL BATTERIES NOT NOT LIKE TWO OR TWO UH
I THINK SO TOO
AT LEAST UH WHAT WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE ON I JUST REMEMBERED UM A MENU TO GO BACK THROUGH THE FIRST UH
I I THOUGHT IT WAS UH EASIER TO HANDLE THIS WAY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY THINK
BUT I THINK I WOU
I THINK THAT'S A MATTER OF WHAT YOU'RE USED TO
I THINK I WOULD PUT A PLUS AND A MIN UH HERE
AND THEN THE P. IN THE MID IN THE MIDDLE AND THE SOUND UH IN THE MIDDLE
YEAH BUT I THINK WHEN YOU ARE HOLDING IT YOU COULD PRESS THE MINUS AND THE PLUS AND WITH THE OTHER FINGER THE MINUS AND THE PLUS
THE 'CAUSE THEY CAN USE THAT BETTER
HERE IS OUR HERE ARE UH
YEAH BUT BUT I MEAN IF IT'S USUALLY PLUS OR MIN ABOVE EACH OTHER OR NEXT TO EACH OTHER ON A NORMAL REMOTE
THAT'S HOW IT'S IS USUALLY WHEN I LOOK HERE
SO IN THE MIDDLE OR SOMETHING
SO IT MAKES MORE SENSE JUST 'CAUSE OTHER REMOTES DON'T HAVE THAT
ABOUT A MICROPHONE THERE IS NO BUTTON
BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT THEN UH
IS IT
OOH
BUT UM I'VE PREPARED A LITTLE PRESENTATION ONCE AGAIN UM OR AT LEAST AN AGENDA I THINK UH THE BIGGEST PART OF THE PRESENTATION WILL BE UH ON YOUR SIDE
AND JUST AS THE LAST TIME WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES TO ACCOMPLISH THAT
WELL TAKE IT AWAY
OH Y
SO FOR THE OLDER PEOPLE A MORE TRADITIONAL UH FORM
YEAH WE THINK SO TOO
YEAH BUT I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO USE A REMOTE WITH WITH THEIR FINGERS BECAUSE TH THEY'RE USED TO THAT AND
OKAY WELL MAYBE IF I CAN INTERRUPT YOU MAYBE I SHOULD UH SHOULD SHOW SOME POINTS ON WHICH WE UH SHOULD TAKE A DECISION
THOSE POINTS UM
HOW HOW SHOULD WE UH SUPPLY THE THING WITH ENERGY AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT WITH SEPARATE DOCKING STATION AND THEN PUT IN IT
THOSE ARE POINTS MY UH COACH ADVISED ME TO DISCUSS HERE BUT I HOPE YOU HAVE IDEAS ABOUT THEM
WE ALREADY DECIDED THAT ON THE PREVIOUS MEETING
EVERYBODY'S SEARCHING IN HIS DATA
BECAUSE I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN A IN AN IMPORTANT POSITION WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE IT
YEAH BECAUSE A MICROPHONE IS VERY SMALL THING BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S BIG SO AS ITS ITS REALLY AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE
SO WELL UH TYPE SUPPLEMENTS
AND I THINK I WOULD IT WOULD MAKE EVEN MORE FANCY BECAUSE YOU HAVE ANOTHER INTERESTING THING ON THE SIDE WHICH YOU CAN TOUCH AND
WELL THERE'S OUR FIVE MINUTES UH WARNING
UM ANY MORE UH QUESTIONS ABOUT ABOUT THE DESIGN OR THE USER INTERFACE OR DIFFERENT COMPONENTS EVERYONE
IS THERE A STANDARD COLOUR
BUT STILL SILVER AND BLACK ARE WELL SILVER IS NEW BUT ALSO TRADITIONAL SO UH
THE NEXT MEETING IS ONCE AGAIN IN THIRTY MINUTES
AND OF COURSE TO ALL FOUR OF US UH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE EMAILED BY OUR PERSONAL COACH
W SURE
UM UH FIRST OF ALL UH I WOULD LIKE TO UH UH ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THOSE UH THINGS I UH UH ELABORATE SOME OF THE THINGS I DID
UH SAID ABOUT UH THE COMPONENTS UH ITS PROPERTIES AND WHAT KIND OF MATERIALS SHOULD WE USE TO UH TO MAKE UH ONE OF THOSE R REMOTE CONTROLS
UH WELL FIRST OF ALL I'VE UH D SUBTRACTED SOME OF THE COMPONENTS THAT IS THAT ARE USED UH ARE W W UM YOU KNOW FROM WHAT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL'S FORMED
I WOULD LIKE TO UH GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF UH HOW I THOUGHT ABOUT
THERE'S ONE OF THE BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE A REMOTE CONTROL A LOT OF PEOPLE UH WILL UH WILL UH DROP THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AND THEY BREAK UH BECAU THE UH TITANIUM WAS ALSO AN OPTION
UH RUBBER IS I THINK UH THE BEST SUITABLE UH MATERIAL UH TO USE UH FOR OUR UH
UH RUBBER L MAKES IT EASY TO UH TO TO IT LETS LETS ITSELF COLOUR
UH TITANIUM UH YOU HAVE TO PAINT IT AND WITH THAT UH IT'S POSSIBLE TO SCRATCH IT OR UH YEAH MAKE IT UGLY
UM I H I HAD AN IDEA SINGLE COVERED UH CURVED SORRY SINGLE CURVED
I THINK IT'S UH IT'S BEST TO DRAW OH GREEN
NEW
OH THAT
SO IT ALSO LOOKS NICE WHEN IT'S ON YOUR TABLE
SIDE VIEW YES IT'S SIDE VIEW SO UH I I'M NOT TECHNICALLY GOOD AT TH THREE D. MODELLING BUT
UM UH IT'S JUST AN IDEA I HAD SO IT'S UH IT'S VERY UH SO ITS ALSO LOOKS NICE WHEN IT'S ON THE TABLE
WELL I ALREADY UH S UH EXPLAINED SOME PROPERTIES OF THAT MATERIAL AND I THINK UH WELL WE ALSO WE ALMOST CONCLUDED ABOUT THAT UH THIS SHOULD UH BE UH OUR UH BUTTON COMPONENT
UH THAT'S ALL ABOUT UH THE BUTTONS
UH WILL BE CHARGEABLE WITH UH UH AN OPTION FOR A MOUNT STATION SO YOU CAN UH PUT THE UH THE REMOTE CONTROL IN A MOUNT STATION SO ITS CHARGES ITSELF UP INSTEAD OF UH PLUGGING IT IN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND THEY SHOULD BE LONG LASTING NOT UH NOT BE EMPTY UH IN ABOUT UH TWO MINUTES OR UH THIRTY MINUTES OR FORTY MINUTES OF USE
AND NEXT STEP IS THE CHIP UH TH THE COMPONENT THAT'S UH MAKES OR TRANSMITS THE SIGNAL TO THE TELEVISION
UH THERE WAS AN OPTION TO USE S A RATHER SIMPLE CHIP BUT I THINK UH BECAUSE UH OF OUR UH HIGHLY UH REQUIRING UH REQUIREMENTS
THERE SHOULD BE AN ADVANCED CHIP IN IT WITH UH ALSO THE ABILITY TO UH FACILITATE SPEAKER SPEECH RECOGNITION UH WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS STILL IN A TEST PHASE
UH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES UH I ALSO OVERHEARD IN THE LAST MEETING THAT THERE SHOU WE SHOULD USE UH OUR OWN BUSINESS COLOURS
I THINK THEY ARE RATHER BORING FOR UM FOR USE WITH RUBBER
OKAY THEY SHOULD BE M SH THEY SHOULD BE IN MIND WASN'T IT
OKAY SO IT D IT DOESN'T SAYS UH TO UH HAVE THE SLOGAN
SO IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE VERY UH FANCY UH REMOTE CONTROLS WHICH PEOPL UH WHO PEOPLE
AND UH WILL BUY UH THEM FASTER WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE SAME OLD GREY OR BLACK UH COLOURS
UH S AS I SAID UH BEFORE RUBBER IS UH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DAMAGE SEVERELY IMP INSTEAD OF UH OF COURSE YOU CAN BREAK IT WHEN YOU YOU WHEN YOU BREAK IT IN S FOR EXAMPLE WITH A PAIR OF SCISSORS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT I IF YOU DROP IT IT'S NOT UH BROKEN UH RIGHT AWAY S INSTEAD OF USING UH PLASTIC HARD PLASTIC OR UH TITANIUM
AH
FRUITY
FRUITY
YEAH S ROUND CORNERS BUT S BUT SQUARE YEAH
WILL RECOGNISE THAT'S AS A REMOTE CONTROL
UH WHEN I SAW YOUR D OH
UH
UH
UM I ALSO S UH CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT YOU UH USED AN YOU HAD A REMOTE CONTROL AND THE L. C. D. SCREEN WAS UH RATHER SMALL
SO UH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT YOUR OH
OR SHOULD IT BE LARGER
BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT YOUR F YEAH BUT IF YO IF YOU MAKE THE THE L. C. D. SCREEN AS LARGE AS THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF
UH YOU'LL YOU'LL ALWAYS GET SOME YOU YEAH
BUT IF YOU WANNA MAKE IT IN INTERNATIONAL JAPANESE UH PEOPLE GOT UH RATHER SMALL HANDS
YOU DON'T WANT UH BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE THE PEN UH IF YOU LOSE THE PEN UH YOU CAN'T USE
W
YEAH YOU GOT SOME UH SOME OF THOSE UH UH WIRELESS UH MICE
KINDA LIKE THOSE KIND OF BATTERIES
UH
WELL UH CHIP ON PRINT I THINK WHAT THEY MEAN UH WITH THE REGULAR RUBBER BUTTONS THAT YOU GOT
UH IT'S ALWAYS CLEAR FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL WHEN YOU PRESS UH A CERTAIN BUTTON
BUT WHEN YOU GOT A L. C. D. SCREEN WITH NO UH WITH NOT THE BUTTONS ARE NOT ALWAYS ON THE SAME PLACE
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ENLARGE A BUTTON OR IF YOU GOT SEVERAL OPTIONS UH APPEARING ON YOUR SCREEN UH THE CO ORDINATIONS AREN'T ALWAYS THE SAME
WHEN YOU GOT A REGULAR BUTTON TH THE BUTTON OF STAND BY IS ALWAYS ON THE SAME PLACE AND YOU GOT ON THE AND ON THE
YEAH BUT IT THE THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE IN A SETTINGS MENU OR JUST UH YOU JUST WANT TO TURN UP THE VOLUME
TO KNOW UH IN WHICH STATE YOU ARE AND UH WHICH BUTTON YOU ARE PRESSING IN AT THE RIGHT MOMENT
AND A TOUCH SCREEN MAKES IT UH POSSIBLE TO UH TO GET THE CO ORDINATION OF YOUR FINGER ON THE SCREEN
THAT'S THE EASY TO HA UH TO TO UH
YEAH SURE LOOK
UH
SO SO YOU GOT UH DID YOU WRITE THAT DOWN
UH GOT A SINGLE CURVED UH RUBBER
F UH FANCY COLOURED REMOTE CONTROL
I SO IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S
UH
W
WE'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE USABILITY ENGINEERING THEN
SO NOT HOW MUCH N NOT HOW OFTEN IT'S USED BUT
UH
UH
LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE
OKAY WELL LE
SO IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO UH JUST PUT IT AROU UH UNDERNEATH IT OR ON THE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE UH REMOTE
BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORT I THINK THAT'S NOT IM VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YEAH IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THE MICROPHONE IS
AH OKAY SURE OKAY WELL THA
YEAH BUT IT DOESN'T MAKES IT UH ANY MORE FANCY BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE UH
UH
THE L. C. D. YEAH UH SUPPLEMENTS WELL THE SUPPLEMENT IS TO YEAH
USE THE SCROLL
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
SO WHY NOT ON ON SIDE
BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE YEAH YOU GET W WHEN YOU USE UH THE SETTINGS MENU FOR EXAMPLE TO LOOK UP SOME UH UH SOME CHANNELS ON YOUR UH ON YOUR TELEVISION
YOU SHOULD SCROLL SCROLL DOWN UH ON A MENU WHICH PROBABLY DOES NOT FIT ON YOUR SCREEN
SO THEN IT'S UH VERY HANDY TO TO SCROLL DOWN YOU MAKE JUST A RUBBER JUST LIKE UH ON YOUR MOUSE OR
JUST PUT IT ON THE SIDE AND IT'S VERY EASY TO USE
I I YOU GOT YOU GOT DIFFERENT COLOURS BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE A STANDARD COLOUR
YOU SEE A LOT OF T UH SILVER TELEVISIONS
BUT IF YOU USE UH SILVER UH RUBBER S SILVER RUBBER ISN'T FANCY
FRUITY
LOOK
THIN I THINK WE SHOULD WORK
YOU HAVE TO GO T
OH IT'S A SIDE VIEW
THE METHOD I USED WAS
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING PEOPLE LIKED LAST YEAR WAS THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE LOOK LOOK FANCY
THE SECOND IMPORTANT THING THAT W SHOULD BE IF INV IN INNOV INNOVATIVE OKAY
I THINK WITH ONLY ONE MENU FOUR BUTTON CHANNEL VOLUME IT SHOULD ALSO BE ENOUGH FOR EASY TO USE
AND SOFT MATERIAL M MATERIALS LIKE THE RUBBER
TH
ELDERLY PEOPLE LIKE AU COLOURS WHICH Y ARE BEING SEEN IN AUTUMN LIKE UM WOODS UM DARK BROWN RED DEEP REDS AND STUFF
INNOVATIVE ALL THE COLOURS YOU SEE THE BLUE THE RED THE WHITE THE YELLOW THAT STUFF
I THINK LIKE MY COLLEAGUE YOU SAID IS THAT'S E BETTER OR FOR THE ELDERLY PEOPLE SOMETHING LIKE LIKE THE IPOD OR SOMETHING WITH ROUND SQUARES
COLOURS TH THE ELDERLY PEOPLE
UH
LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO MAYBE WE COULD GIVE IT LIKE WOODEN LOO LOOK LOOK OR SOMETHING IN THAT COLOUR
THOSE KIND OF YEAH THOSE KIND OF THINGS
SO YOU SEE THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE
YEAH I THINK IT'S IT'S EASIER TO DO IN COLOUR THAN IN SHAPE
IN MATERIAL YEAH RUBBER RUBBER IS LIKE I SAID YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE MORE SOFT MATERIALS AND SPONGY ONES AND THE OLD PEOPLE LIKE PLAIN WOOD
NO NO NO BUT BUT YOU HAVE TO LIKE LIKE LIKE A A ERASER OR SOMETHING
THAT'S THE BIT YOU CAN PRESS IT IN OR SOMETHING HARDER
IT'S FEELS KIND S SPONGY
N N N
ARE YOU GOING TO INVITE SPONGE BOB MAYBE HE CAN
ONE TO ZERO THE TWO DIGIT
YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO BECAUSE SOME FAT PEOPLE WITH D THICK FINGERS WILL PRESS THREE BUTTONS AT SAME TIME
USE A PEN YOU YOU C YOU CAN LOSE THE PEN
YEAH YOU CAN BUY THOSE AT
SO IF THE BADG THE BATTERIES ARE DEAD
THEN YOU CAN RE YOU CAN UH CHANGE THEM
YEAH YEAH YEAH LIKE THOSE
YEAH NORMAL PLAIN YOU NO NORMAL PLAIN BATTERIES YOU CAN BUY AT THE SUPERMARKET OR RETAIL SHOP
ALWAYS SO
I DUNNO WHAT W WHAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT
YEAH YEAH OKAY BUT I D I I DON'T KNOW IF NOR O S IT'S QUITE A SIMPLE L. C. D.
YOU CAN PUT IT ON YOUR TABLE WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT IT GET IT IN YOUR HAND
YOU CAN PUT IT NEXT TO YOU AND THEN DIVE IT IN AND
YOU CAN'T YOU YOU CAN'T OH YOU C YOU CAN DRAW IT ON YOUR PAPER AND THEN LOAD IT ON THE
AND LOAD IT ON THE THE USER THE SERVER
WITH THE MINUS AND THE PLUS
EASIER THAN
I THINK IT'S IT'S EASIER TO HAVE IT SOMETHING LIKE
OH A BUTTON UH MINUS HERE PLUS OVER HERE
AND ON HERE
THE OTHER BUTTONS AND ON HERE THE TOP
MINUS
OH I HAVE THAT THOSE S NUMBERS
B
UH
YEAH IS IT IS USER INTERFACE
I THINK THE LEFT S UNDER CORNER SHOULD BE THE BEST
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO JUST UP WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO DO ON THE SCREEN
Y
YEAH BLACK I THINK IS IS THE STANDARD
I THINK YOU SEE MORE SILVER THAN BLACK
YEAH THE THE SILVER BLACK ARE OUR MAIN COLOURS
I THINK WE HAVE SILVER BLACK AND BETWEEN THOSE IS LIKE I DUNNO S FIVE COLOURS BETWEEN THEM OR SOMETHING
OH IN
OH UH THIS THE SCROLL BUTTON AND THE MICROPHONE ON THE ON THE SIDES HERE UNDER
OH Y YOU PERHAPS YOU SHOULD MAKE IT A BIT BIG SO PEOPLE KNOW IT'S THERE AND UH
UH
AND YOU COULD ALSO TOUCH IT SO THAT IT COMES OUT AND AND USE THE THE THE SCROLL THING AS A WITH YOUR FINGERS
UH WELL THIS IS THE TOTAL INTERFACE UH THAT F OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN
WE PUT ANO AN AN EXTRA BUTTON IN
JUST WHEN YOU ARE ONE AND YOU GO TO TWO YOU CAN OR IF YOU GO TO FIVE YOU CAN GO BACK TO ONE WITH THAT BUTTON
AND UH UH WE PUT THAT IN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HANDY THERE
WELL THIS ABOUT IT I THINK
I WILL PUT IT BACK ON THE ON THE NICE GREEN
IT'S TH TH RIGHT NOW IT'S ONLY R. R. BUT UH
IT UH OH IT'S IN THE BACKGROUND
Y YOU SHOULD MAKE UH A SIDEWAYS UH VIEW
OH WE CAN
OH G I WOULD SMART BOARD
OOH
I IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT GREEN THEN THE ELDER PEOPLE WON'T WON'T LIKE IT
OH IT'S A ONE
THE OPTIONS ARE IT UH LITTLE BIT HARDER BUT IF YOU TOUCH THE OPTIONS THEN IT'S UH
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T HAVE T HAVE TO USE THE BUTTON ON THE RIGHT
YOU SAY YOU SAY UH RECORD TO TO THE TO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN YOU SAY THE QUESTION AND THE ANSWER
THREE
THREE
OH NEE OH SEVEN IS IT
OH WE HAVE TIME
OH BUT NOT IT'S NOT VERY SPONGY BECAUSE IT'S HARD RUBBER
YEAH Y YOU CAN LOSE IT BUT IT ISN'T HARD TO LOSE
IT DOES HAVE AN A BUILT IN FUNCTION
NEE
YEAH SO THEN THIS IS IT IS ALMOST TRUE SO A TWO
OOH
OH WELL IT DOESN'T
YOU COULD CALL TO YOUR UH YEAH AND THE SCREEN YEAH
RIGHT THAT THAT THAT THOSE ARE FEATURES
THOSE ARE FEATURES
ONE D ON I IT'S THE COLOURS AND THE
AND YOU CAN NAVIGATE EASIER BECAUSE WI WITH THE YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE THE THE ARROWS AND WITH A NORMAL T. V. UH REMOTE
MENU
ONE THREE AND A FEW ONES
I THINK SO TOO
IT'S LIKE A BUG OR SOMETHING
NO IT WAS IN MY UH MY INFORMATION SO UH
WE'VE GOT A BATTERY ONE OR T TWO BATTERIES OR NOT
NEE ONE BATTERY WITH TWO SMALL BATTERIES
ONE BATTERY RIGHT
UH WE HA WE HAVE UM SINGLE WHAT
OH THE THE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK UH PEOPLE
IS HE INTEGRATED
NO EH
OH YEAH RIGHT WE WANT IT TO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT NO
FIFTEEN OH TOO BAD
OH BUT WITH SPECIAL COLOUR WE HAVE
OH WE DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTONS SO YEAH WE NEED TO UH
NO UH WE HAVE FIFTEEN AND OH RIGHT
WE COULD LOSE THE CURVE
YEAH I WOULD LOSE THE CURVE
BUT YOU CAN'T PUSH IT SO YOU HAVE TO TAP
AND I THINK WE SHOULD LOSE THE CURVE
NO THE CURVE DOESN'T REALLY
WE WOULD LOSE THIS ONE
YEAH WE COULD S YEAH A BIT
COULD COULD WE DO IT ON A REGULAR CHIP ON PRINT OR SOMETHING
MA Y YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT OR UH
WE CHANGED TH
YEAH BUT IT'S T
YEAH BUT IT IS UH IT IT IS A NEW FEATURE IT IS SOMETHING SPECIAL
UH
OH CAN I ASK SOMETHING
IS THAT THE WOOD UH WOOD UH THIS WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT ONE TOO
SEE A PO THREE
YOU CO YOU COULD MAKE IT ALWAYS BLACK LIKE NORMAL REMOTE
IS IT PER REMOTE
SO THEN IT IS ONE
ONE
SO Y YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE A NICE REMOTE
SHOULD WE CHANGE THAT THA THAT THAT'S A ONE IF NOT OR NOT
OOH
OH YOU YOU MADE THE ENTIRE COULD YOU
OH NOT WELL
ADD IT COPY PAGE
SO WE COULD FIX IT LIKE THA THAT IT'S LIKE THIS
ERASE
WHEN YOU SAW TH LI UH EARLIER WHEN WE SELECTED IT W I COULDN'T ERASE ANYTHING
OH YEAH NO HA HA
YEAH WE TRIED IT EARLIER
OH I ALREADY ERASED HALF OF THE LINE
TOO BAD OH
OH NOW I'M LINE
YOU THINK NO MY PRESENTATION ISN'T READY
I THINK SO TOO
YEAH BUT THEN YOU CAN WORK TOGETHER TOO WHEN
TH THE PEN DOESN'T
I I USED IT IT IT WAS YOU CAN USE IT IT'S QUITE HANDY I THINK
YEAH I USED IT TO Y TO YEAH IT DID WORK PRETTY WELL
OH DID YOU
IS IT ON THERE
IS IT ON THERE
I DIDN'T FIND THE DIDN'T LOOK BUT UH I DIDN'T LOOK BUT
I GOT LIKE ONE EMAIL AFTER TEN MINUTES OR SOMETHING
AND IT NOT A LOT UH
NO THE FIRST ONE
NEE
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR THE FIRST TEN MINUTES BEFORE WE GOT HERE SO I WENT RIGHT
YEAH AN
YEA UH SO THA ACTUALLY YOU COULD MAKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN BUT NO MIC OR IT COULD MAKE MIC BUT NO L. C. D. SCREEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT
DO WE GET ANOTHER EMAIL
YOU CAN JUST YEAH BUT IT'S IT ISN'T A PICTURE OR WELL IS IT
UH OH EXPORT
WELL IT ISN'T ON THE DESKTOP
THREE
SO WELL UH WELCOME EVERYONE
UM AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED I UH
OH NO THIS IS JUST ONE BIG DOCUMENT SO YOU CAN LEAVE THAT WHEREVER IT IS
OH UH YES
I HAVE IT OPEN MYSELF I GUESS
AND UH M DID YOU DO SOMETHING WITH EVALUATION CRITERIA
AND IF WE CAN WE CAN UH COMMENCE THE FINAL PART WHICH IS THE PRODUCTION OR PROJECT EVALUATION
HOW DID WE WORK TOGETHER AND WHAT ARE THE RESULTS AND HOW HAPPY ARE WE WITH THOSE
SO A SEPARATE BUTTON FOR FOR TEXT OKAY
WELL IT MIGHT WORK ONE TIME HUH
WELL I'D SAY TWO ON A SCALE
YEAH M
SO WHICH NUMBER ARE WE GOING TO FILL IN
AND WOULD IT BE EASY FOR THEM TO USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
M MAYBE THAT'S THE MOST USER FRIENDLY AND EASY TO USE
UH
YEAH BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD MAKE IT ONE SCALE WITH WITH ONE BEING GOOD AND SEVEN BEING BAD
YEAH AND I THOUGH W WE HAD ABOUT SINGLE COLOURS BUT YOU CAN ALSO MAKE UH A WOOD COLOUR
YEAH BUT A HAR
OH IT ISN'T WELL OKAY
WELL I THINK IT'S IT'S UH A LOWER NUMBER SO BETTER BECAUSE W WE DESIGNED IT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY DIDN'T WE
OKAY YOU THINK ONE WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'D SAY THREE SO TWO IT IS THEN OR
WELL M TH BUT THE LOGO IS ON ON THE FRONT SO A TWO YEAH THAT'S
OH WELL THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY GOOD HUH
UM LET'S SEE OH IT ISN'T ASKED TO SAVE BUT IT DID ALREADY
IN A GROUP BUT I AM WILLING TO TRY IT
LOOK ON THAT
WE'RE GOOD AND IF THEY'RE NOT WE'RE GOING TO UH RE DESIGN BUT WE HAVE TO DO THAT UH VERY VERY QUICK I THINK YES
N NOT IN THE
UM MAYBE I COULD ASK ONE OF YOU TO UH FILL IT IN SO THAT I CAN ALSO UH TAKE MINUTES
AND UH MAYBE THE OTHER CAN UH USE THAT THING TO COUNT UH NUMEROUS FUNCTIONS
SO OR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SCREENS SO
OH BUT IT'S JUST ONE
POINT SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD SHOULD UH
OR MAKE IT ON A HAND DYNAMO BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WILL WORK
AM I RIGHT
THEY DON'T WORK SO HARD AT THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT
OH YOU CAN ARRANGE
WELL YOU CAN DRAW OVER IT WITH WHITE UH PEN
UH OH
UM AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO THE PROJECT OR PRODUCT EVALUATION
AND FOR ME IT SOMETIMES WAS A SURPRISE WHO WAS GOING TO PRESENT WHAT HUH
YEAH WELL I USE IT AS A A NORMAL PEN AND AND AND ONLY YOU USE IT TO UH GET IT ON THE COMPUTER HUH
YEAH WELL I THINK SO TOO
WHEN WE GET UH WHEN WE HAVE WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN UH MORE INFORMATION
AND SO MORE TIME UH W MIGHT HAVE IMPROVED THE THE QUALITY OF WORK IS WHAT YOU SAY
SO I'LL MOVE ON TO I GUESS MY LAST SLIDE YES WHICH IS THE CLOSING
FOR THE THREE OF YOU BECAUSE UH I HAVE TO WRITE THE FINAL REPORT NOW
BUT UH WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CO OPERATION AND I HAD A VERY NICE DAY SO FAR
YEAH I HAVE T I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO GO TO OUR OWN ROOMS AGAIN BUT UM WELL I AT LEAST
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN TRY UH TO MAKE A SCREEN SHOT OF THIS SO I CAN TRY TO INCLUDE IT IN THE FINAL REPORT
I KNOW WE SHOULD REMOVE THIS BUT IT WON'T H
I HEREBY OFFICIALLY CLOSE THE MEETING AND UH I HOPE TO SEE YOU UH SOON
UH
WHATEVER YOU THINK IS GOOD
YEAH SAVE IN THE FOLDER
JUST EXAMPLE COLOUR SO UH THERE'S ONE OF THE COLOURS WE WOULD LIKE TO UH SEE IN OUR PROTOTYPE
YEAH JUST UH JUST AN IDEA ABOUT HOW TO M TH THAT COULD ALSO BE POSSIBLE
UH WELL IT'S AN IDEA IN A SO
TO FUNCTION IT IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO BE SM UH BIG OF COURSE
THE MICROPHONE COULD BE JUST A MINOR UH HOLE UH ON THE LEFT UH BUTTON
UH USING THE SCROLL BUTTON ON SIDES UH Y UH I UH UM
SO UH YOU CAN SCROLL DOWN TOO WITH THE SCROLL UH BUTTON UH AS YOU CAN SEE OH IT'S HERE JUST PUSH IT IN
UH THE MENU COMES OUT LIKE THIS AND UH I IT ALL BECOMES VISIBLE
OKAY UM IT'S ALSO UH NICE TO SEE THAT UM WE MADE A SMALL UH MENU
WHI WHICH IS USED UH WHICH SHOULD STILL BE USED AND WE THINK THAT IT'S UH VERY HANDY TO PUT IT UH NOT UH UNDER THE OPTIONS MENU
IN AN APART UH
YOU CAN SEE VERY CLEARLY NOW THAT THE UH TELETEXT AND OPTIONS MENU ISN'T UH TAKING UH MUCH UH UH IT'S TAKING MUCH PART OF THE SCREEN
SO IT'S VERY UH WHEN YOU UH WHEN YOU USE IT DOESN'T UH BECOME IRRITATING TO SEE
'CAUSE IF YOU PUT IT ON THE TOP YOU ALWAYS GET SEE THE THE OPTIONS MENU
'CAUSE PEOPLE REGULARLY UH READ FROM LEFT TOP TO RIGHT DOWN SO
SORRY YOU USED THE POWERPOINT
YEAH OKAY YOU GE UM
THE SIDEWAYS VIEW UH THAT THAT THAT MA
HO NOT THAT PEN
AH
THAT'S NOT VERY I IT'S ALSO UH VERY HANDY IF YOU MAKE A SIDE CURVE WAY TO MAKE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL VERY THIN AT THE BOTTOM UH AT A BOTTOM AT A BOTTOM
UH MAKE IT UH RATHER THICK ON THE TOP BECAUSE UH ON THE TOP IT HAS UH THE SCREEN
WHICH TAKES UH IN SOME UH SPACE AND THE BATTERIES CAN BE LOCATED OVER THERE SO UH
YOU GET TH
AND UH UH THE SCROLL IS RUBBER SO S
ENO ENOUGH TO I THINK
THEY ARE A LOT EASIER TO FIND THAN UH TH THAN ON THE REGULAR REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE YOU HAVE TO UH FIND OUT WHAT WHICH SIGN OR ICON MEANS ON UH EVERY BUTTON
SO YOU HAVE T YOU HAVE TO USE THE THE THE MANUAL TO UNDERSTAND MOST YEAH
I THINK IT'S THE MOST USEFUL UH REMOTE CONTROL EVER TO BE MANUFACTURED
YEAH BUT BECAUSE IT HAS THE REGULAR UH CONTROLS LI UH AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE SCREEN NOW AND UH
YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE OTHER OPTIONS UH ALWAYS UH ON YOUR SCREEN
SO IT'S T I THINK IT'S REALLY EASY TO USE
UH SURE
YEAH IS OPTIONAL
TO LIKE
UH
UH
UH YEAH
UH
UH OKAY
SO MA UH MAKE IT MAKE IT A TWO
I THINK IT'S TWO TOO TWO TOO TOO
REMOTE YOUNGER PEOPLE USUALLY USE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO PUT ON THE VOLUME
UH
INSTEAD OF UH JUST FINDING OUT WHAT AN ICON MEANS ON A BUTTON
AND THREE
OH M
WHOA
NO HAND DYNAMO
ON ADVANCED CHIP
SINGLE NEE SINGLE CURVED
DOUBLE CURVED WAS UH UH SEE UH JU THREE DIMENSIONAL
UH THAT'S THE ONLY CURVE YOU MADE NOT TH UH CURVED LIKE THAT
YEAH WE GOTTA INTEGRATE SCROLL WHEEL AND PUSH BUTTON BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUSH IT AND YOU W IT WON'T JUST PU UH MAKES POSSIBLE TO S
WE DON'T GOT THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
WE COULD LOSE THE SCROLL WHEEL
IF YOU CAN'T PUSH IT YOU HAVE TO TAP THE THE OPTIONS WINDOW UH BUTTON HERE AND THEN UH SCROLL DOWN WITH THE D WITH UH WITH UH THE BUTTON
LOSE
OKAY SO WE DON'T EXACTLY NEED THE SINGLE WE DON'T NEED A CURVE
IF YOU MAKE IT A FLAT ONE S N IT'S NO CURVE YOU GOT NO CURVES
NO TWO
IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE
THE SAMPLE SPEAKER IS TWO D WAIT F S FOUR POINTS
NO THAT'S NO
YOU DON'T MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL OF AH
TO KNOCK THE SAMPLE SPEAKER YEAH
BUT M YEAH COURSE BUT WHAT WE'LL HAVE
IF WE LOSE THE SCROLL WHEEL AND MAKE IT TOTALLY UH DEPENDING UH DEPENDENT ON UH THE TOUCH SCREEN
SPECIAL C OKAY IF YOU LOSE UH IF YOU LOSE THE
HOW D UH UH HOW MANY COLOURS
SPECIAL COLOURS ALL THE COLOURS YOU WANT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE P
NEE WE WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE ANO ANOTHER COLOUR
YOU DON'T NEED FOUR OF THOSE UH FOUR OF THOSE SPECIAL COLOURS IN ONE IN ONE REMOTE
UH
UNDO UNDO
UNDO
OKAY SO YOU HAD THIS LIST AT START
AH OKAY
AH OKAY
OKAY SO WE LOSE THE SCROLL WHEEL THE S
UH NO
AH
S DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LINES AND TEXT AND THE PEN
WHY SHOULD WE BE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER IN THOSE DIFFERENCE UH DIFFERENT ROOMS
YEAH PERHAPS IT IS EASIER TO GET ONE OF THOSE UH DIG DIGITAL PENS OR SO AND TO UH AND LAY IT NEXT TO THAT KEYBOARD OVER THERE
SO YOU CAN DRAW UH SEE IT OVER TH ON THE SCREEN
IT'S USEFUL BUT NOT M
BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT THIS PEN ON THE SCREEN UH UH FOR EXAM AND LINE IS D BEING DRAWN AT AT TWO OR THREE CENTIMETRES UH BELOW
SO YOU USED UH THIS
UH THE DIFFERENT POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS UH IN WHICH YOU PUT YOUR UH MATERIAL IN THE
I USED IT TOO BUT OH WELL
YEAH BECAUSE IT SHOU
NOT TOO MUCH NOT TOO TOO TOO TOO
NO W I DIDN'T KNOW
FIRST OF ALL I DIDN'T THINK UH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN UH FIRST POINT BUT UH IT WAS POSSIBLE UH UH YEAH
UH
UH
UH
YOU S UH FILE SAVE AS THE J. PEG J. PEG
IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
AH
WHOO HOO
THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE NOT THE SIZE
MM TH YEAH
ONE MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE SEVEN MEANS TRUE
THE THREE IMPORTANT THINGS OF REFA ARE UH FROM TH OF THIS YEAR IS ARE IS THE REMOTE CONTROL FANCY ENOUGH
IS IT IN INNOVATIVE ENOUGH AND IS IT EASY ENOUGH TO USE
UH
IS THE DESIGN FANCY ENOUGH
WITH TWO BATTERIES THE WHOLE PRINT PLATE AND T AND TOP AND IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT QUITE A LOT I THINK
IS IT FANCY ENOUGH
SO FANCY ENOUGH MEANS DOES IT COMES TO THE YOUNGER PEOPLE AND THE ELDER PEOPLE
YEAH I HAVE TO AGREE ALL THE COLOUR COLOURS DON DON DOESN'T MATTER THAT M THAT MUCH NOW IT'S ONLY DESIGN
YEAH I N USED I WOULDN I SHOULD USE THAT ONE BUT IT DOESN'T
IS IT INNOVATIVE
NOT ONLY THIS BUTTONS ALL THE BUTTONS
EASY T
I THINK TH I THINK THE OPTIONS BUTTONS ARE NOT THE THE EASIEST WAY TO TO
I I THINK IF YOU HAVE THE BUTTON AT THE RIGHT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN FIND THE OPTION BUTTON THAT EASY
YEAH OKAY BUT YOU HAVE Y THEN YOU HAVE HERE S WRITTEN OPTION ON HERE THE TELETEXT BUTTON RIGHT
AND ELDERLY FROM FORTY EIGHT TO THEIR DEATH
YEAH AS WELL AS YOUR IF YOU'RE FIF SIXTY YEARS OLD YOU'RE HOLDING ONE OF THOSE THINGS IN YOUR HAND
NO BUT WE'RE GOING TO TH MAKE THIS F FOR A ALL KIND OF PEOPLE SO IT IT IT HAS TO BE
THA THAT'S A ONE I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY A ONE
THE MATERIAL USED IS SPONGY THAT THAT'S UH THAT'S A ONE THAT'S M RUBBER
Y YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T LOSE IT IF YOU'RE SIXTY YEARS OLD
IF FIRST TIME SEE THE THING YOU DIDN DIDN'T ADJUST UH SET THE MICROPHONE AND THEN YOU LOSE IT THEN YOU HAVE LOST IT
IT ISN'T HARD NO
UM WE HAVE THE BUTTONS IS AREN'T THAT THAT MUCH
BECAUSE YOUNGER PEOPLES ARE CR CRITICAL AND THEY WANTED A LOT OF FEATURES ON THIS THING
IT'S THREE FEATURES BASICALLY THE L. C. D. TOUCH SCREEN IS FEATURE
SO I'VE CHOS I SHOU I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S A ONE
YOU CAN SEE THE REMOTE CONTROL IS R. AND R.
HAS OH YEAH DO DID HAVE NAH Y YOU HAVE THE BLACK ONE
AND THE MENU IS AVAIL THAT IS AVAILABLE IS EASY TO USE
YEAH THA THAT'S SO TRUE
I THINK THAT WOU THAT WOULD BE QUITE HARD TO LEARN TO USE IT
LET'S GO TH FOR I THINK IT WOULD BE A T YEAH TWO
SO OKAY WE HAVE ONE THREE A ONE THAT THAT HAVE TO GOT UP
OOH
F FIFTY FIVE EUROS
AH
AH OKAY COOL
OH YEA YEAH YOU DESIGN IT
OH WE ALREADY ON NINE
OH BUT WE HAVE CURVES LIKE IT AND IT
IT'S FOUR PRI IT FOUR UNITS
BUT W D WHA
WAS THAT DOES THAT MEAN TO IT SINGLE CURVE
YEAH BUT THA THAT THAT ONLY IS ONE
NO ONE
YEAH SO THAT DOES DOESN'T DOESN'T THAT MU I THINK
F YOU HAVE TO WE HAVE TO SCRAP FOUR POINTS
MA MAKE IT WITH WOOD INSTEAD OF RUBBER
YEAH OKAY THREE
IS IT ALSO NO THAT THAT'S JUST NORMAL COLOUR FRUIT COLOURS
YEAH BUT THEN I D I DON'T THINK WE CAN EVER MAKE TO A TWELVE AND HALF
S ADVANCED CHIP
S TOUCH
UM HOW MA UH THE COLOURS LIKE L SHE TOLD
IS THAT ALL THE COLOURS WE ADD OR
AH OKAY
YEAH BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT YELLOW UH RED AND THEN YOU ADD YOU HAVE TWO SPECIAL COLOURS ON TOP OF THE ONE WE HAVE NOW
YEAH BUT M
I THEN I THINK I P I DON I DON'T THINK THEY ME MEAN THEY'RE SPECIAL
NEE ONE POINT
Y YEA THE SCROLL WHEEL IS DROPPED
TAP
AND ERASE THE MIC
I THINK WE IT SHOULD BE B IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE WORKED A LITTLE BIT TOGETHER
SO SOME SOME THINGS I HAD IN MY PRESENTATION THEY ALREADY TOLD SO
SO YEAH THAT I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO WORK AT FOR SUCH PROJECT
YEAH NO OR MAYBE SESSION OF FIVE MINUTES TOGETHER OR SOMETHING AND THEN WORK SEPARATE
YEAH M YEAH LIKE SHE TOLD
THEN YOU CAN WORK TOGETHER TOO BY MAIL OR BY I DUNNO CHAT SOMETHING BUT NOW WE'RE COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
YEAH OKAY BUT I DON I DO I THINK BECAU THAT'S BECAUSE
I DIDN'T USE
FAT DOCUMENT THOSE
AH
LITTLE BIT UH LO YEAH
TOO LATE IT IT IT TOOK A LOT OF TIME BEFORE YOU GOT YOUR EMA YEAH
WHA
NO I I NEVER GOT THAT
N YEAH
SO DOES THIS I THINK LIK OH AND INFORMATION WAS A BIT LOW I THINK
YEAH LIKE I WITH WITH THE REMOTE AND I NEVER NEW WE HAVE T WE HAD TO UH YEAH MADE A MADE A REC A REMOTE CONTROL
UH YEAH
I THINK WE GOT IT ALREADY
IT'S NOW HALF PAST FOUR HALF PAST THREE SO
CAN YOU FIND IT AS A J. PEG
IN UH
UH
ENTREE
SO YOU FOUND YOUR SPOTS
YOU SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION
UH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THEN WE DO SOME IN INDIVIDUAL WORK THEN WE HAVE A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS ETCETERA ETCETERA
YOU SEE IT NEXT
AND WE CAN USE THIS PEN TO PERFORM
UH
AND USE DIFFERENT COLOURS ETCETERA
IN FILE MENU
THAT'S NICE OF YOU
THAT'S THE IDEA SO
YOU WERE SLOW TOO SO
YOU GET IDEA RIGHT
OKAY UM WE HAVE A FINANCIAL ASPECT TO THIS PROJECT
UM WE CAN SELL THEM AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
UH
THE AIM IS TO REACH UH UH TO SELL AS MUCH AS FIFTY MILLION EUROS
UH THAT'S QUITE A BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY
UH
WE EACH HAVE A SPECIFIC TASK AS I SAW IN MY MAIL
I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU RECEIVED THE SAME MAIL
AM I CORRECT
UH DID ANY OF YOU ALREADY DO SOME WORK ON THIS PART OR
AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ABOUT THE PRODUCT UH SO FAR
SAME I BELIEVE
UM BUT HAVE YOU ANY IDEA SO FAR AS WHAT UH THE USER REQUIREMENTS ARE
WELL I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO ADD AT THE MOMENT
UH THE USE OF THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER CAN WORK ON THE WORKING DESIGN ETCETERA ETCETERA
UH
Y YOU DO SOME INDIVIDUAL WORK WE HAVE MEETING INDIVIDUAL WORK MEETING
AS TO WHAT THEY WANT
UH DO THEY WANT ALL THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THAT SMALL
UH
SO WE HAVE A BASIC STARTING POINT AND YOU CAN ALWAYS EXTEND THAT SO MAKE SURE IT'S EXTENDIBLE
TH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF FUNCTIONS POSSIBLE SO IT'S EASIER TO GET TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS ETCETERA
LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT TO DO
HI
ARE YOU SERIOUS
IS THIS PART OF OUR A ACQUAI OR INTRODUCTION TO EACH OTHER
UH
YOUR LINE BROKE
UH OKAY
UH NO
AYE
UH YEAH I DUNNO
SO WE HAVE TO S
'CAUSE WE HAVE THREE DESIGN STEPS AND IN EVERY STEP I HAVE A S SPECIFIC TASK TO PERFORM OR WHATEVER
AND KIND OF LET IT WORK IN TO GET IDEAS ABOUT
WELL HOW I HAVE TO FILL IT
AND WE YE USE BUTTON PRESSES TO ACTIVATE OR DEACTIVATE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS ON THE T. V.
AND THAT'S BASICALLY ALL I HAVE SO FAR
YEAH I KEPT IT GLOBAL 'CAUSE THAT IT ACTIVATES OR DEACTIVATES SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS 'CAUSE I WASN'T THINKING YET ABOUT THAT
UH
WHOA
IS THAT YOU OR ALRIGHT
BUT BUT WE NEED GOOD COMMUNICATION ABOUT THIS STUFF 'CAUSE I HAVE TO F PUT THE COMPONENTS INTO THE DESIGN
AND AND FOR A T UH TELETEXT YOU NEED ADDITIONAL BUTTONS AS WELL SO I KIND OF NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE UH NEED
IN HERE AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS IT WITH THE NEXT UH
SEE YOU LATER
OKAY I'LL WILL GIVE IT AN UH AN EYE
YOU D YOU ALREADY TOLD THAT
AND FOR THE CHANGING UP TO THE TO ALL THE CHANNELS AND CHANGING THE VOLUME
UH REALLY EASY TO USE BUTTONS NOT NOT UH VERY SMALL BUTTONS BUT NOT THE THE ALSO THE BIG BIG BUTTONS BUT JUST NORMAL BUTTONS
SO IT HAS N HAS NOT TO BE L YEAH GIGANTIC UH MACHINE
ARE YOU GOING TO PUT THE THE NOTES ON THE
DO WE ONLY HAVE TO TO DO UH PHASE ONE THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UH
I WOULD FIRST M
MY SCREEN IS GONE
SHOULD IT BE ONE
OR SO Y YOU MUST SAVE IT AT THE END AND THEN
OKAY THEN M MAKE A NEW ONE
UH
SOME LEAF TO EAT
UH
UH
AH SOME EYE
I IT JUST CAME INTO MY MIND
SO THERE ARE A FEW MEANS TO REACH THAT UM BY BY DOING RESEARCH UH TO SEE WHAT EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE THERE OUT IN THE MARKET
SO WE CAN SEE UH WHAT NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED
WHAT W WHAT WOULD THEY LIKE TO SEE UH ON A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
NO N NOT SPECIFICALLY
UH
UNIT
YEAH WELL LIKE L LI LIKE SOME LIKE SOME SOME REMOTES WHO ARE OUT THERE
SO WITH THE SWITCH ONE SINGLE SWITCH
S
YEAH SEE YOU LATER
OR YOU GOT THE SAME MESSAGE
YEAH I RECEIVED AN EMAIL SO I THOUGHT I I CAN'T MAIL YOU SO I THOUGHT I'D JUST DROP IT IN THE FOLDER BUT
IS IT UNLOCKED
UH
N NOT USED ANYMORE
NOT BY MAIL
I RECEIV THE MAIL BUT YOU DON'T
IT'S OPEN ALREADY SO YOU CAN USE TO
SO N IT'S VERY EASY
YEAH AND THE OTHER OTH OTHER UH FUNCTIONALITY IS THE SCREEN
THEY SAID THEY NEEDED IT BUT WHAT DOES IT DO
CONTENT AND FORM
OH WORKING DESIGN I GOT IT
UH
UM FOR THOSE THAT DIDN'T SEE YET UM THE BASIC NEW REQUIREMENTS OF THE MANAGEMENT WERE NO TELETEXT ONLY FOR T. V.
UH IT SHOULD BE DESIGNED FOR A USE G UH GROUP BELOW FORTY
AND UH THE CORPORATE IDENTITY SHOULD BE CLEAR IN THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE FUNCTIONS AND ON THE LET'S SEE WHAT WAS IT UH THE TARGET GROUP
YEAH IT'S BELOW FORTY SO WE CAN DECIDE WHERE TO
SO BELOW FORTY IS OKAY
BUT WE NEED AN LOWER LEVEL WHICH TO S UH FOCUS
SO IS IT FROM SIXTEEN TO FORTY
IS IT FROM TWENTY TO FORTY
IS IT FROM THIRTY
AND MAYBE Y
SO IS YOU SHOULD HAVE A MENU FOR ALL THE THE FUNCTIONS YOU DON'T USE REGULAR AND WHICH ARE
AYE YEAH
NO IT DOESN'T HAVE LINE CONTROL SO
IS ON TOP
T I S SHOULD SAID RIGHT
OR YOU SHOULD SCREEN AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN YOU CAN SEE IT VERY CLEARLY
YOU YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO HOLD IT SO
MAN
UH
AND LEFT TO RIGHT
AND THOSE CAN ALSO BE USED FOR THE MENU
NO THAT'S NOT S SURE SO UH WE NEED A DISPLAY
UH
UH
SO I CAN JUST COPY THOSE
L. S
YEAH SO I'VE G CHANNEL PROGRAM IS AUTOSEEK
OH THEY GET AUTOMATIC NAMES OKAY
YEAH BUT CAN YOU ALSO SAY I WANT F UH VERONICA ON THE CHANNEL NUMBER UH FIVE OR
AND THE WORKING DESIGN WAS TO SPECIFY HOW PH THE PHYSICAL INTERATION BETWEEN THE COMPONENTS WAS AS I BELIEVE
BUT I THINK THE COMMUNICATION WITH THE TELEVISION IS DIFFICULT
FOR ALL THESE FUNCTION I PUT THEM ON THE
I THINK TH I THINK THE YEAH THE LAYOUT OF THE SCREEN AND I THINK YOU CAN CONCENTRATE MORE ON THE BUTTON PLACEMENT AND THE PLACEMENT OF THE UH SCREEN ITSELF ON THE
NO I D I THINK THAT'S MORE IN
FORM FUNCTION OKAY
I THINK I THAT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT YES BECAUSE W HE ALREADY KNOWS WHAT
UP AND DOWN IS
YOU DO WE DO THE EXTRA TWO BUTTONS OR NOT
AND TO OKAY AND BACK ALSO
MENU BUTTON ACCESS THE MENU IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN
THOSE ARE BOTH BOTH YEAH
WELL WE HAVE THOSE BUTTONS
IT'S NOT BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE YOU BUT YH WE HAVE LUNCH BREAK AND THEN WE CAN WORK FOR THIRTY MINUTES
YEAH I GOT IT BY YEAH
I'M GONNA GET KICKED IF I DON'T DO IT SO
I DIDN'T SEE IT YET I THINK
WHERE DO I FIND THIS
NO WHAT WAS IT ABOUT
NO I JUST FLAPPED IT CLOSED IT TOOK IT HERE AND THEN THIS HAPPENED
AH
IN SETTINGS
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT I WAS GONNA DO AND THEN A COUPLE OF MINUTES BEFORE THIS I GET MY FUNCTION YOU KNOW THE INFORMATION THAT I NEED
AH LOOK
WE HAVE YOUR UH OH NEVER MIND
UH NO
I HAVE NO IDEA
THAT W
THOSE WERE MY UH STARTING POINTS
UH I WAS WORKING ON A S YEAH ON A SCHEDULE AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO IT LIKE THIS
IT THE SIGNAL GETS BOOSTED AND THEN SENT TO THE TO THE RECEIVER ON THE T. V. AND THE T. V. WILL TRANSLATE IT INTO A FUNCTION
ACTUALLY ALL I GOT AROUND TO DO
YEAH SO WHAT WE MIGHT WANNA DO IS UH YEAH CUST I HAVE CUSTOMISED THE SCREEN FUNCTIONS IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
THE UH YOUNGER USERS ARE MORE ACQUAINTED WITH THESE KIND OF MACHINES SO THEY CAN USE MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS
BUT MAYBE ELDERLY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT SO WELL SO THEY NEED A SIMPLER REMOTE
AND YEAH THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT THE DESIGN DISPLAYS OR WHA WHATEVER
I THOUGHT BUT THIS IS REALLY YOUR DEPARTMENT THAT WE NEED JUST THE FUNCTIONAL DISPLAY AND FOUR CURSORS
WHY DID WE WANNA PUT THE DISPLAY IN THE BOTTOM
ON ONCE IT'S ON IT'S ON
MAYBE ON THE TOP OR EVEN ON THE SIDE
BUT IF YOU UH IF YOU HOLD THE MA THE REMOTE LIKE THIS IF YOU PUT IT ON THE TOP ON THE SIDE I DUNNO
AH AS
THE FR YEAH THE FREQUENCY OF THE TONES YEAH
NO NO OF THE REMOTE UH DO DO WE WANT UH THE BUTTONS TO MAKE SOUND WHEN YOU PRESS THEM
AS A CONFIRMATION OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW
UNDER THE A YEAH ADVANCED OPTION MENU YOU CAN PUT THOSE THINGS
AND YOU HAVE IN THAT UH THE INDEED THE REMOTE CONTROL OPTIONS
HE ONLY HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT HAS TO LOOK
TO USE
YOU DID YOUR HOMEWORK
SO IF YOU WANNA YOU KNOW THE CHANGING THE CHANNELS KIND OF S THING IS I HAVE TO INTEGRATE THAT IN THE DESIGN
IT'S IN A IN A WAY THAT B IS USER FRIENDLY
SO THAT IF YOU UH PRESS ON THE MENU FUNCTION THAT ONLY THE BUTTONS THAT ARE USED FOR THE MENU ARE LIGH LI LIGHT UP
N
YEAH KEEP IT OPTIONAL 'CAUSE MAYBE YOU CAN YOU KNOW GO LEFT TO RIGHT AND UP AND DOWN IN A IN ONE MENU
THE PR THE PROBLEM WITH THE OKAY BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE IS SORRY
SORRY UH IS UH IF YOU'RE PRESSING UP AND DOWN YOU CAN EASILY PRESS THE OKAY ONCE YOU WHEN YOU'RE NOT ALREADY AT YOUR CHOICE
HOW M HOW LONG IS THE LUNCHBREAK
BRING IT ON
YEAH WA WA YOU ACTUALLY
BUT YOU YOU'VE GOT MORE INFORMATION THAN UH
THIS THE EASY ONE I THINK WE HAVE TO TO COMBINE THEM
UH YEAH THIS THIS ONE WE CAN REMOVE FOR KIDS
IT'S JUST ONLY FOR ADULTS SO UH WE CAN UH USE SOME ADVANCED OPTIONS
YEAH BUT I PREFER WE WE UH USE THE THE BASIC OPTIONS UH YEAH
WE HAVE TO TO MAKE THEM VERY EASY SO FOR JUST UH ZAPPING AROUND THE CHANNELS YOU CAN JUST PUSH ONE BUTTON
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TO USE YOUR YOUR VIDEO RECORDER OR SOMETHING ELSE YOU SHOULD USE USE AN UH AN ADVANCED OPTION
LIKE YOU UH SAID UH BEFORE
UH YEAH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS
UM THE WE HAVE TO TO TO WATCH OUT FOR THE I IF WE MAKE IT F VERY FASHIONABLE IT IT THE FUNCTIONAL FUNCTIONALITY WILL GO DOWN
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE UH A COMPROMISE BETWEEN FUNCTIONALITY AND FASHIONAL FASHIONABLE YEAH CONTENT AND FORM
NA
I W I SHOULD UH PUT UH THE THE YEAH THE EXTRA ADVANCED OPTIONS ON THE ONTO THE ONSCREEN DISPLAY
YEAH BUT IF YOU ARE USING THE THE NORMAL FUNCTIONS THE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS YOU NORMALLY PRESS THEM ON THE U YEAH
YOU BROKE IT
ON THE LEFT UH TOP YEAH
OKAY THE YEAH
YEAH IT IT'S JUST A REMOTE CONTROL SO
ON THE UH YEAH CAN YOU I MAKE A A MAP WITH WITH ALL THE YEAH 'CAUSE IT'S NOW THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF DOCUMENTS
BUT DO I HAVE TO TO UH TO YEAH TO MAKE THE THE MENU LAYOUT ALSO
ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT
Y YOU YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A LIST OF WHAT FUNCTIONS ARE UH ARE GOING TO TO BE ON THE THE SCREEN THE MENU SCREEN
W WE
YEAH OKAY BUT WE WE HAVE A M YEAH BUT MAYBE THAT'S THAT'S NOT UH YEAH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE Z ZAPPING UH WITH YOUR UH YEAH REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH J JUST JUST GROUP GROUP THE YEAH WE MAKE THESE THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS AND THESE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS
F OH YEAH
UH
YEAH I'M I'M NOT S CLEAR ABOUT UH THE THE EXTRA TWO BUTTONS
OKAY SO THAT THAT'S NOT UH YEAH THAT THOSE ARE
SO MAYBE MAKE ONE UH ONE OKAY BUTTON AND AND ONE NAVIGATION BUTTON
YEAH THE WITH WITH THE THE CHANNEL AND THE VOLUME UH YEAH M A MULTIFUNCTIONAL NAVIGATION BUTTON
BUT DO WE HAVE TO WRITE UH TO WRITE DOWN UH THE OUR STUFF NOW
OR FIRST LUNCHBREAK
I'VE EVERYTHING IN MY HEAD NOW SO
YES SIR
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE UH OKAY
OOH
I I HAD A WHOLE IDEA AND THEN JUST WAS TYPING IT AND THEN OH
I HAVE TO DO THAT SO SWITCH
THE FINDINGS WERE UM WELL YOU CAN SEE THEM FOR YOURSELF
SO THEY THEY D THEY DON'T MATCH WHAT THEY WANT TO HAVE ON IT
UM THERE IS ALSO UH WAS ALSO SOME RESEARCH ON UH THE MOST RELEVANT AND AND AND IRRELEVANT UH F FUNCTIONS
YEAH THEY DO NEED TO BE ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH I MEAN W WE CAN'T MY MY T. V. HAS BUT WE WE CAN LEAVE THEM UH AWAY
AND TELETEXT IS SO OUTDATED THAT IT IT'S I SHOULD NOT BE USED UH ANY MORE IN THE FUTURE
YEAH ON ON THE PROJECT UH
NO SO IT'S A TEXT FILE N IN THE PROJECT FOLDER
UM BECAUSE YOU SEE SEE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE AGE GROUPS CONCERNING THE FEATURES
UH BUT BELOW THAT AGE THEY UH THEY PRETTY MUCH ARE
SO I THINK WE CAN BUILD THAT IN
UM AND AND ALSO THERE'S SO NOT ONLY THE DESIGN OF THE BUS UH BUTTONS BUT O HOW YOU CAN PUSH THEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT
AND I THINK AND CERTAINLY FOR FOR THE FOR THE LOWER AGE GROUPS UH NICE DESIGN WHICH UH DOES NOT MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL IN YOUR ROOM
SO IT'S D IT HAS TO LOOK NICE AND FEEL NICE AND AND HAVE ALL THE FUNCTIONS THAT UH
WELL THAT ARE THE THE CONSEQUENCES UH ON A MARKETING UH PART
SO NOT NOT TOO MUCH BUT YEAH
SO W
AND THE AND THE YEAH SCREEN MENU TO TO TO UH TO DO THAT AND THEN THE BASIC FUNCTION JUST ON THE DEVICE ITSELF
UH
WELL I MY GUESS IS IT'S IT'S PRETTY HANDY FOR ADVANCED UH ADVANCED FUNCTIONS
YEAH WE WANT TO INCORPORATE IN UH INTO IT
GROUP OF USERS OR BECAUSE IT SAYS BELOW FORTY I MEAN
I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S THE TAR YEAH UH OR MALE AND FEMALE
UH SIX THE MARKETING RESEARCH STARTED ON S ON THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
SO THEY THEY ADAPT TO IT PRETTY SOON I GUESS
BUT UH ALL INCORPORATED IN THE SCREEN OR OR JUST ON THE REMOTE ITSELF
UH
UH
IF YOU PUT IT LIKE LIKE HERE
UM THEN YOU COULD PUT A SCREEN LIKE ON A MOBILE PHONE ALSO ON TOP I GUESS
OKAY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PUT THE SCREEN HERE IT'S MORE ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS NOW THAN THE THAN THE LAYOUT
DOESN'T WORK TOO WELL
UH FOR EXAMPLE IF Y IF YOU PUT ALL THE
AND YOU YOU HAVE MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE ONE BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE
TO TO CONFIRM A A KIND OF ACTION
THEN OKAY TO CONFIRM AND THEN UH ON ON EACH ON EACH SCREEN THERE'S THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO GO BACK TO A TO A UPPER LEVEL
UH IN ONE TIME I DUNNO THAT'S NOT REALLY MY DEPARTMENT
THAT'S MORE YOUR UH YOUR DEPARTMENT TO TO UH TO
BUT IT SHOULD BE IF THE SCREEN IS HERE THEN THE LOGO SHOULD BE LIKE ON ON TOP YEAH
YEAH I MEAN THE POSITION OF THE SCREEN IS ALSO MORE ESSENTIAL THAN I MEAN WE WE LOOK WHERE WE HAVE SPACE LEFT AND THEN PUT THE LOGO OVER THERE
ALSO BECAUSE PEOPLE USE M MOBILE PHONES AND THEY ALSO HAVE THE SCREEN ON TOP
BUT MOST MOST OF THE TIMES IF A IF IF A T. V. 'S ON STANDBY PEOPLE JUST PRESS A CHANNEL TO PUT IT ON
YEAH MAYBE ON THE SIDE
I MEAN IF THE IF THE MICROPHONE IS GOOD
YEAH JUST OH Y YOU HAVE DIGITAL UH BETTER WRITE IT DOWN OVER THERE YEAH
UH YEAH SOUND AND THEN WITHIN SOUND I GUESS TREBLE AND BASS
BUT PITCH ISN'T THAT YEAH THAT'S THE THE HEIGHT OF THE TONE
YEAH OKAY WH WHY WOULD YOU USE THAT
YEAH THOSE ARE THE MOST USED I GUESS
I WILL LOOK IT UP
UH YEAH
SO YOU YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO TO START SCANNING ALL THE FREQUENCIES AND WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS ONE WELL IT SHOWS ON YOUR T. V.
UH AND THEN YOU CAN SELECT UH A NUMBER IN YOUR REMOTE ON WHICH YOU WANT TO SAVE IT
IT ONLY HAS TO MATCH THE THE CHANNEL FREQUENCY ON YOUR T. V. WITH WITH THE WITH THE POSITION ON YOUR T. V. AND AND SO YOUR REMOTE
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TOO
WAIT YOU YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO BROWSE THROUGH A LIST OR SOMETHING WHICH W DISPLAYS ALL THE ALL THE VALUES ALL THE CHANNELS WHICH ARE POSSIBLE
I MEAN LIKE ONE TO F THIRTY OF OR NINETY OR WHATEVER
JUST BROWSE THROUGH IT AND THEN UM IN SOME KIND OF WAY SEE IF IT IF IT IF IT IS PROGRAMMED
S UH LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE UH R. T. L. FIVE ON ON CHANNEL FIVE
ON THE T. V.
OR OR IS IT TOO HARD TO TO JU TO JUST DO IT ALL ON YOUR REMOTE
UH
I MEAN TH THE AUTOSEEK IS IS NOT A PROBLEM
I MEAN YOU UH YOU UH CURRENT CHANNEL AND THEN THEN IT JUST SAYS UH ON WHICH NUMBER DO YOU WANT TO SAVE THIS
AND YOU JUST PRESS A NUMBER ON YOUR REMOTE AND THEN SAY CONFIRM OKAY AND THEN IT'S IT'S SAVED
WELL I GUESS THIS THIS BUTTON THE THE THE OKAY MENU OKAY
AND THEN ONE TO CONFIRM AND ONE TO GO ONE STEP BACK
OR THE OR THE NO BUTTON
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEN IT BECOMES CLEAR WHICH BUTTONS ARE ACTIVE NOW WHICH YOU CAN USE
THOSE BUTTONS ARE ARE LIT UP
SHOULD WE USE THOSE TWO
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD USE THIS ALSO AS AN OKAY BUTTON STILL
UH
AYE
Y YOU SAVED IT
WHOO
AH
SHE
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FINAL REPORT 'CAUSE I HAVE TO RECORD EVERYTHING WE ARE DECIDING AND SUCH SO I'M TRYING TO WRITE IT DOWN BETWEEN EVERYTHING ELSE
UH WE HAVE AGAIN THREE PRESENTATIONS AND THEN WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WHAT CONCEPTS THE MOBILE PHONE HAS TO UH F THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO SUPPORT
UH I THINK YOU CAN ONLY FIT ONE UH SOURCE OF ENERGY ON THE
S YEAH IT'S SAFE
UH
UH
BUT I DIDN'T SEE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE SO I THINK WHAT WE HAVE IS OKAY
TOO
I DIDN'T GET ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THAT SO
IS THERE A NEW THING
OOH
AH YOU DIDN'T DRAW IT YOURSELF
AH
YEAH BUT THIS THIS THE IS FOR THE
UH
AH YEAH BRIGHT COLOURS
SO TO APPEAL A LITTLE MORE TO THE ALL THE PUBLIC
TO SWITCH FROM BUTTONS TO INTERFACE HMM
BUT YOU CAN HIDE THE OKAY AND THE BACK UH BUTTON
N NO YOU HAVE TO EXIT
Y
WELL I THINK IT'S A BIT TOO MUCH BUT
WHO
AND THEN YOU CAN USE YELLOW OR SEMETHING
AYE
OOH
Y LEFT YEAH LEFT AND THEN UH I HAVE TO KICK YOU OUT
BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE LEDS ARE JUST EXTRA LIGHT
BIT OF LIGHT
BIT OF FEEDBACK
UH
DON'T MEAN TO DISCOURAGE YOU BUT UH BASICALLY
YEAH UH ABOUT
ABOUT
LOOK AND FEEL AND
THEN WE HAVE TO UH SEE SOMETHING WHICH WE CAN UH
SHOW TO THE MANAGEMENT
OH AND SAVE THIS UH BOARD
SO IF YOU'LL RATHER DRAW IN PAINT OR SOMETHING
THEN LOOK
NOT ONLY ON THE FRONT SI UH THE TOP SIDE BUT ALSO THE THE SIDE VIEW
UH
WHAT DO I WRITE DOWN
I DON'T SEE ANY POWER CABLES HERE SO
I JUST PUT IT IN THE IN THE SHARED FOLDER SO IT SHOULD BE YEAH I THINK SO
NO NO NO CAN YOU GO BACK ONE
I DID GET A BIT MORE DONE THAN THE LAST TIME 'CAUSE I KNEW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TIME SO I JUST COPY AND PASTE EVERYTHING INTO THE
SOMETIMES I HAVE THESE POP UPS OR THESE SOUNDS AND THERE'S NOTHING THERE
AND ALSO WITH I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE POWERPOINT SO IT TAKES ME FOREVER TO GET SOMETHING DONE WITH IT
THI
AND I USED UH POSSIBILITIES FROM OUR MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT ABOUT CURRENT COMPONENTS WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE DESIGN
UH I COULD NOT DRAG THE PICTURES INTO THE THE SLIDES SO S SO I DON'T HAVE EXAMPLES OF HOW IT LOOKS LIKE
BUT IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT YOU UH WHAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO WITH THE SPONGEY AND THE FRUITY LOOKING UH TYPE
SO THIS BASICALLY UM YEAH GOES ON TO WHAT YOU WERE MENTIONING EARLIER
UH WE HAVE A HAND DYNAMO WHICH WE YEAH WE DUTCH REFER TO IT AS THE KNEIPGATT
SO UH MY YEAH ALSO ALSO IN YOU KNOW COUNTRIES WHERE THERE'S N ISN'T MUCH LIGHT LIKE IN SCANDINAVIA
THEY WOULDN'T BE Y ABLE TO USE IT HALF OF THE YEAR YOU KNOW
SO THAT'S NOT COOL EITHER
I WOULD DEFINITELY GO FOR RUBBER 'CAUSE IT FITS MOST IN WHAT PEOPLE WANNA SEE NOWADAYS
IS EASIEST TO IMPLEMENT UH FOR THE PRODUCTION 'CAUSE THEY THEY CAN PRINT IT BETTER
I FIRST UH CHOSE FOR THE BATTERY 'CAUSE YEAH I'M TRADITIONAL AND THAT'S THE MOST OBVIOUS EASIEST CHOICE TO GO TO
NO IT MEANS CURVED IN TWO DIMENSIONS
UH LET'S SAY WOULD BE A B SQUARE BOX BUT THEN WITH CURVES ON ONE DIMENSION
YEAH WE NEED THE THE CHIP ON PRINT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE THE SCREEN AND UH AND F AUDIO FUNCTION
I'M JUST THINKING THIS IS NOT MY DEPARTMENT BUT I I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS GONNA COST TO BE ABLE TO M
SO 'CAUSE WE NEED TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO A PIECE
CHILD LABOUR MAN WE LOVE IT
MAYBE IT'S EASIER IF YOU GUYS COME OVER HERE
S SEE THIS IS THE THE THE STANDARD TRADITIONAL TYPE WHERE THE FORM UH YEAH SERVES THE FUNCTION YOU KNOW
BUT THIS M IS MORE APPEALING TO OLD PEOPLE AND WE DON'T WANT THAT
AND TH THAT MEANS CURVED IN BOTH DIRE DIRE UH DIMENSIONS
IT HAS TO BE KIND OF INSTEAD OF THE PLAYSTATION THE MODULE
IT HA
'CAUSE WE WANNA APPEAL TO THE TO THE YOUNG PUBLIC WITH FANCY WITH FLASHY COLOURS AND WITH A LOT OF SHAPE
TO CUSTOMISE IT AND SO I MEAN KIDS CAN MAKE IT LOOK MORE FLASHY WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF COLOURS AND PEOPLE WHO WANT SOMETHING YOU KNOW DIFFERENT
SO THOSE I THINK ARE ALL MY OH
I THINK THE I MEAN OUR AIM IS TO MAKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT RIGHT
WELL THIS IS REALLY YOUR DECISION BUT
AND WE NEED SOMETHING THAT WELL THAT THAT YOU CAN ABLE TO USE IN ONE HAND I THINK
SO W W
ACTIVATE AND TH THE YEAH
WELL YEAH THE THE IDEA OF IT WAS IS THAT BECAUSE YOU CLOSE IT YOU COVER THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND IT WON'T BE VULNERABLE TO SCRATCHES OR WHATEVER
YEAH I WAS THINKING IF IF YOU HAVE YOUR HAND IT THIS IS YOUR TH
SO IT'S EASIER TO HOLD IN YOUR HAND TO Y F
UH YEAH
YEAH THEN W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO TO MAKE IT LIKE THIS
LIKE LIKE YOU DREW HERE
YEAH BUT WE HAVE HARDWARE INSIDE WHICH IS SO IT HAS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF BASIC SHAPE
THOSE BUTTONS
AND THE SIMPLE BUTTONS HERE SO THAT
I UH Y EAH THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
YEAH W WE NEED VERY PRIMARY COLOURS LIKE BRIGHT RED BRIGHT YELLOW
SO IT NOT NOT ONLY IN IN THE COLOURS OF THE LEDS THAT WE WANT SOMETHING TO KEEP IT VISIBLE AT ALL TIMES OR
AS LONG AS YOU LOO USE UH HIGH CONTRAST BETWEEN THE THE BACKGROUND AND THE FOREGROUND COLOUR
SO TH THE TOTAL OF THE THING IS VERY BRIGHT
THOSE THINGS WERE ALL LIKE LIKE BRIGHT RED BRIGHT RED FLASHY
DO YOU GET A POP UP IF WE
NO THAT'S ACTU
RED AND GREEN ARE ACTUALLY THE B THE EASIEST TO DISCRIMINATE
THEY WILL SEE ONE OF EACH AS GREY
BUT IF YOU USE UH GREEN ON BLUE THOSE KIND OF COLOURS WILL LOOK THE SAME
YOU CAN WHAT WE SHOULD DO I THINK IS IS MAKE KIND OF A SEE THROUGH PLASTIC BUTTON WITH UH ONE COLOURED LED BEHIND IT
AS THE COLOUR THE
WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE IT THE SHAPE SO THAT IT'S EASY TO HOLD F FOR BOTH HANDS
AH RIGHT
ON THIS SKETCHBOARD
UH SORRY
AND YOU HAVE TO THINK UH HOW WE'RE GONNA PUT THE SCREEN IN IT AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS
FOR NORMAL SKETCHES
UH
EXACTLY BUT THE UH BUT THE UPPER SIDE HAS TO BE A BIT MORE LIKE THAT I THINK
THE TH
LET ME TRY IT ONE MORE TIME
MAYBE I'VE UH IT'S EASIER IF I DRAW IT IN ONCE
IT'S FUN TO WORK WITH THIS PEN
SO SIDE
UH
YOU CAN ADJUST THE ANGLE TO WHICH IT FLIPS
SO IT CAN ALSO FROM THIS ANGLE IT CAN FLIP ALL THE WAY UP TO THERE
IT DOESN'T AIM SO WELL
UH
YEAH OR J OR ALSO SCROLLING FOR THE M YEAH
WE W KIND OF WANTED TO STICK WITH THE
I I DON'T MI I DON'T MIND
AS AN OPTIONAL UH FEATURE
OR COMBINE UH BOTH WITH A WITH ONE UH
ONE ONE UH VERY IMPORTANT THING I WAS UH YEAH THINKING ABOUT IS THE SPEECH UH OPTION
YEAH UM YEAH THAT'S ONE THING UH WHICH I'M NOT SURE UH OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT UH INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL
BUT DO UH J DO WE UH DO THE SPEECH JUST FOR THE BASIC OPTIONS FOR THE SIMPLE BUTTONS
FOR FOR EVERYTHING ALSO FOR THE ADVANCED OPTIONS
YEAH IN THE IN THE LAST UH MEETING WE UH WE WERE YEAH PUTTING THE THE SIMPLE AND THE ADVANCED OPTIONS SEPARATED
PRESSING THE THE MENU OPTION UH WILL DISABLE UH ALL OTHER OPTIONS ON YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL
UM YEAH DESIGN HAS TO BE VERY ATTRACTIVE BUT THAT'S YOUR YOUR OP YOUR YEAH
UH
A LITTLE BIT I THINK BUT NOT NOT EVERYTHING W
OH I UH DIDN'T READ THAT
BUT THIS IS THE THE BASIC UH DESIGN UH FOR THE FOR THE M YEAH FOR THE BUTTONS
AND UH IF THERE ARE OLDER PEOPLE THEY WANTED MORE UH YEAH MORE UH LUXUROUS SO THAT'S AN A ALSO AN OPTION
THIS IS THE THE MENU I WAS UH LOOKING UH AT
S YEAH
BUT IT HAS ALSO TO IT IT HAS ALSO TO BE UH LUXUROUS UH FOR FOR YEAH RICH PEOPLE
IF YOU HAVE UH IT HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND
YOU YOU YOU ARE NOT ONLY UM YEAH YOU DON'T NEED ONE DIMENSION BUT YOU CAN USE OTHER DIMENSIONS FOR PRESSING THE THE BUTTONS
THE OH
IT'S NOT VERY UH VERY STRONG UH YEAH IF YOU DROP IT ONE TIME
NO THE ARROW'S OVER HERE
YEAH BUT THE PRIMARY COLOURS W WE CAN UH CREATE WITH THE WITH THE LEDS ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
IF YOU WE UH YEAH
UH
YEAH MAYBE A MAYBE A WHITE A WHITE BACKLIGHT
BUT THE BUT THE BUTTONS HAVE THEIR OWN LEDS OR NOT
AH SO THIS IS BASICALLY THE WHAT WHAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT
OH NEXT
UH
YEAH THE DISPLAY WE YEAH WE CAN PUT A DISPLAY
MAY MAYBE IT'S IT'S EASIER TO TO INTEGRATE THE THE THE L. C. D. SCREEN JUST INTO THIS THIS BUBBLE
BECAUSE IT DO DOESN'T HAVE TO FLIP THEN
BECAUSE WE HAVE EN ENOUGH SPACE FOR FOR MAKING A AN L. C. D
I DON'T SEE THE THE YEAH WHY WHY WE SHOULD USE THE THE FLIPPING UH MECHANISM
H HERE WE GOT UH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS THE THE ARROW UH YEAH BUTTON
YEAH AND THEN H WE SH MM
OKAY WI
AH IT'S IT'S OKAY
FOR MENU
YEAH YOU ARE GOING TO DESIGN IT SO
OOH IT WORKS
WHERE ARE ARE ALL THE OTHER PRESENTATIONS
AH
BECAUSE I SEE ONLY MY OWN PRESENTATION YEAH
AH I CAN'T CUT AND PASTE IT INTO THE OTHER FOLDER BUT
ME FIRST AGAIN OR YEAH
AH
AH
UH WELL THERE HAS BEEN INV INVESTIGATION AGAIN IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET
AND THE FEEL OF THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGEY
SO UM THE DEVELOPMENTS I WILL ADDRESS THEM OH YEAH WELL THIS IS THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES LOOKS OF FRESH BRIGHT COLOURS
UM WELL IT STANDS FOR THE USE OF TECHNICAL FEATURES THAT DO NOT EXIST IN CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
I THINK WE PRETTY MUCH COVERED THAT WITH OUR SCREEN AND UM AND SPEECH RECOGNITION SO I DON'T EXPECT THAT TO BE A PROBLEM
AND THE THIRD DEVELOPMENT UM IS THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
WELL THE FIRST ASPECT UH WAS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SECOND WHICH WAS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE THIRD ASPECT
UH SO THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN COMBINATION WITH THE SPONGEY MATERIAL
UM AND EASY TO USE I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE PROBLEM
SO KIND OF THIS
SO A K A SMALL EXAMPLE
KIND OF THIS THIS LOOK
WI AN INDOORS
IT CAN BE DONE I MEAN YOU CAN'T HARM IT SO IT'S A PERFECT COMBINATION I GUESS
SO THAT'S UH IS THAT IS THAT THE ADVANCED CHIP
I GOT MY FRESH AND FYOO FRUITY UH PICTURE UH ALSO UH OVER THERE SO
TOO LESS TIME
YEAH THAT THAT W
SO THAT INDICATES THAT THERE'S AN MENU UNDER THAT MENU
SO S
YEAH THERE'S ONLY IN IN THIS DIMENSION
BUT FROM THE SIDE YOU YOU CAN HAVE IT ALSO IN A KIND OF SHAPE
TOWARDS YOURSELF SO YOU CAN EASILY SEE YOUR SCREEN
SO THIS THIS IS SO THE SCREEN IS POSITIONED OVER HERE
OH THE ADVANCED BUTTONS
SO OKAY B BUT YOU HAVE T YOU NEED SOME BUTTON TO FLIP THIS OPEN
AN ADV AN ADV AND IT WILL BE COVERED IN SOME KIND OF UH THIN RUBBER LAYER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH THE LOWER PART DOESN'T WORK I GUESS SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY IT OVER THERE
YEAH SO OKAY WE SHOULD BETTER CHOOSE ONE SH ONE SHAPE
BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF THE IDEA SO IT LAYS GOOD IN THE HAND AND THEN ON ON THE SIDE WITH WITH YOUR THUMB
SPONGEY
UH BANANAS WIERD SHAPE AND OTHER FRUITS ALSO SO IT'S BETTER TO HAVE UM SOME SORT OF BASIC PRINT AND THEN A FRUIT PRINT IN SOME PRIMARY UH COLOURS
AH WELL I DON'T GUESS IT S HAS TO BE A SIXTY UH SIXTY SIX FIVE THOUSAND UH COLOUR SO YEAH TOO EXPENSIVE
J
I KNOW YOU SH YOU SHOULD TEST IT UNDER UH UNDER A LIGHT CONDITIONS
AND IF THE BACKGROUND IS VERY DARK BLUE
UH
UH
MY COUCH IS IN THAT COLOUR
UH
BUT MAYBE THE BUTTONS ALL BUTTONS IN RED IS MAYBE A BAD CONTRAST FOR COLOURBLIND PEOPLE
YOU BETTER BET BETTER BETTER KEEP THE LED AND THE BUTTON ITSELF IN THE SAME COLOUR I GUESS
BIT OF LIGHT AND ATTENTION
SO WH HOW SHOULD I DO THAT
OR YOU YOU OR YOU SEND IT TO ME
OR JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO DESIGN IT ON THIS BOARD RIGHT
I KN I KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN IN YEAH SO
ON THE LEFT
S SO YEAH
OH WE SKIP THIS I GUESS
SO THE PL THE PLASTIC PLASTIC BUTTONS ALSO HELP UH BECAUSE OF UM THEY ARE ONLY LIT DURING INTERACTION
ERASE
I DON'T SEE A SIGN THAT THE MEETING IS OVER YET BUT
BUT WE WE
I IS IT IF IF THIS IS FROM THE SIDE WOAH
SO THEN IT'S LIKE THIS OR THAT'S NOT CONVENIENT BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE THE SCREEN LIKE THIS AND LOOK LIKE THE IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS
SO W YEAH
AND THEN LIKE I OH TH DOH
SO NO FLIPPING BUT JUST NO
UH THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO HAVE A MOBILE PHONE SO ALSO TO TO DEAL WITH THEIR UH REMOTE UH CONTROL
OOH
WE SHOULD WORK IN OUR OWN ROOM RIGHT
SEE YOU TWO IN HALF AN HOUR UH
AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE FIFTEEN BUTTONS ONE L. C. D. SCREEN ONE ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
AND WE WANTED UH THE BUTTONS IN A SPECIAL COLOUR
UH
SHOULD WE SWITCH TO A HAND DYNAMO
UH THAT'S THE STILL THE SAME IDEA AS THE KINETIC ENERGY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO USE IT AND DO THINGS
UH
UM UH ANOTHER OPTION I SAW WAS TO DROP THE BUTTONS ONE THROUGH NINE
THAT WOULD SKIP NINE BUTTONS AND FOUR AND A HALF EUROS
UH YEAH
UH
UH YEAH
IT'S UH ONE INTEGRATED BUTTON IS FIVE TIMES THE COST OF A NORMAL BUTTON
YOU COULD ALSO DROP J THREE MORE OF THESE WITHOUT LOSING MUCH FUNCTIONALITY
YOU JUST DROP THE OKAY AND THE BACK
S S DROP SPEECH RECOGNITION
S FO FOUR LESS EUROS
OH AND THE POWER BUTTON WE HAVE ALSO
SO THAT'S ONE EURO
THAT WOULD SAVE ZERO POINT TWO EUROS COMPARED TO NO
TO THIS TOGETHER IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OOF IT'S ALMOST THE SAME AS T KEEPING THIS
OKAY TH THAT'S YEAH THAT'S ONE EURO MORE EXPENSIVE
UH
UH
UH THAT'S EASY BECAUSE PLASTIC IS FREE
S
NO I KEEP THE RE YEAH
NO Y YOU WOULD REC
YOU CAN USE THOSE YEAH
THREE
IT WOULD SAVE ENOUGH YEAH YOU CAN CHOOSE THIS DROP THESE THEN WE HAVE A HALF EURO LEFT
OH STILL YEAH
OH THEN I MISCALCULATED
AH I DON'T THINK I CAN S UH PERSUADE THE MANAGEMENT TO SAY THIS IS BETTER FOR THE MARKET SO YOU SELL MORE THAN
THAT'S OH YEAH SINCE WE ONLY HAVE ONE BUTTON
I JUST M I DON'T I THINK UH YEAH IT'S I THINK IT'S GREY REGULAR
SO WOAH WE'RE WITHIN BUDGET
UH
YEAH THIS THE LAST PHASE OF COURSE SO
BUT WELL AS YOU SAW THAT HADN'T MADE NO SENSE BECAUSE WE HAD TO DROP IT
UH
YEAH IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT SO I JUST
UH
UH OF COURSE WE DROPPED A LITTLE BIT OF THOSE UH
UH Y WE SHOULD FILL THIS IN NOW
UH
YEAH IN THE NEW DESIGN I S WOULD SAY IT'S THREE
BUT NOW IN ORIGINAL DESIGN I SAY TWO
HEY YOU'RE MARKETING EH
M MAYBE UNDERLINE
HE TYPES EVERYTHING
YOU DON'T USE ANYTHING ELSE
BECAUSE HE'S NOW HAVE A SCROLL WHEEL THAT YOU CAN PUSH IN
LIKE ON THE THE MOUSE
YEAH IM IN THE MENU
NEW
YOU LIKE BOTH
UM OH YEAH
OOH
SO FOUR AND
BO
YOU CAN OH YEAH
UH
S UH
SO THR T TWO
UH NOT ON THAT BUT
OH AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD A UH INFRARED LED
OTHERWISE IT UH DOESN'T FUNCTION UH SO WELL
WELL I HAVE TO UM UM MAKE AN UH REPORT OF EVERY DECISION WE MADE SO FAR
UH
AH
THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET STARTED WITH SO
UH I JUST TOOK ONE FOR EVERY STEP AND THEN A CONCLUSION
I DON'T THINK SO IF YOU SEE THE OPTIONS
CAN YOU JUST PUSH PEN AND THEN KEEP ON
YEAH JUST ON THE THE M UM THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
I D IT ISN'T INSIDE
AND THE RECALIBRATION IS DONE USING THIS ICON HERE
THEN I HAVE TO UH UH WRITE THIS AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE TO PRESENT BECAUSE I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THAT SO FAR
MAYBE WE GET A A FINAL MAIL
AND YOU CAN UH JUST UH RELAX AND UH HAVE CUP OF COFFEE OR OH NO THEY DON'T HAVE BEER HERE SO YOU CAN'T CELEBRATE
UH
DID YOU WERE YOU ALL PLEASED WITH THE PROCESS AS IT WAS
OR ARE THERE UH
OKAY AND WAS THAT DUE TO MY LEADERSHIP
UH WAS THAT HELPFUL OR
OOH
USE THE PEN
BLINK
OKAY ARE ARE THERE ANY NEW IDEAS ABOUT THIS
UH UH W UH S SORRY UH
AH
UH OKAY
UH
YEAH WE NEED ONE INTEGRATED BUTTON FOR EVERYTHING THEN
Y Y YOU WANNA SEE A BAR ON WHICH YOU CAN ADJUST IT FROM ZERO TO TEN FOR EXAMPLE
SO YOU WANNA CLICK ON IT ACTIVATE IT WHE AND WHEN YOU MOVE IT HEAR THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TREBLE COMING OUT OR GOING INTO THE SOUND
YEAH IF YOU IF YOU GO TO EIGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
YEAH BUT THE UH CAN'T WE F UH FIT ALL THE BUTTONS IN AN INTREG INTEGRATED SCROLL PUSH BUTTON
'CAUSE THAT WILL SAVE US ONE AND A HALF EURO ALREADY
AND THEN IF W
YEAH D AT L YEAH
YEAH IT'S JUST AS EXPENSIVE AS WHAT WE HAVE NOW
I MEAN IT CAN BE A POWER BUTTON AS SOON AS IT POWERED ON
YOU CAN GO INTO YOU IN YOU MAIN MENU YOU CAN CHOOSE UH FLIP CHANNEL UH YOU CAN CHOOSE SOUND OPTIONS ANY OPTIONS
'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MONEY AND W WE WANT THE SCREEN
WE'LL WE'LL BE ON
FOR YEAH
BECAUSE THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE YOUNG USER WAS ALSO DEFINED IN COLOUR AND SHAPE AND THE USE OF L. C. D. RIGHT
YEAH THE NEXT NOT SO MUCH SO
WELL UH WE SHOULD B BUILD IT SO THAT IF YOU DON'T KIND OF PUSH INTO THE MENU OR SOMETHING
IF WHEN IT'S ON YEAH IT'S TURNED ON
BUT AS SOON AS YOU CLICK IT YOU GO INTO THE MENU OR SOME OF YOU OR YOU DOUBLE CLICK IT
SAY
FR OH I MEAN THE OH NEVER MIND
BUT ONLY ON THE ON THE OUTSIDE NOT ON THE BUTTON
YEAH STILL WE WE DROPPED ALSO ON THE THE DOUBLE UH CURVE
S
UH
ACTUALLY WE D WE DIDN'T DO SO WELL ON THIS ONE
YEAH BUT IT BE BECAUSE UH WE COULDN'T HARDLY DRAW ON THE B S ON THE LOWER HALF OF THE SCREEN
WE COULD NOT MAKE IT BIG ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY DRAW IN THE
HELL YEAH
THE ONLY E THE ONLY THING EASY ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE YOUR FINGERS
NO M
I WOULD G I WOULD GO FOR FOUR
BECAUSE WE KIND OF TRIED TO BUT WE KIND OF FAILED WITH THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE
AH WE CAN DO THE MATH
UH
F
OH WHAT
SO IF YOU GIVE A TRUE TO A POSITIVE IT ACTUALLY MEANS THAT THE LOW THE LOWER THE BETTER
ONE SCROLL BUTTON AND
HAVE TO TAKE THIS AWAY ALSO
HORIZONTAL'S EASIER TOO 'CAUSE YOU CAN
IS IT MORE NATURAL THAN THIS
LIKE A OTHER COLOUR THAN THIS ONE
OH NO MY REMOTE HAS ACNE
DOH
IS THAT THAT
THAT DOESN'T RESPOND ALSO TO THE UNDO
I MEAN IT'S NOT TOO UH
ARE YOU DISSING MY DRAWING
AT FOUR YEAH
NO BUT IT I IT'S NOT A BU A BEAMER
B IT'S A NORMAL T. V. SCREEN KIND OF THING
YEAH IT IT MATTERS FOR THE AIM OF THIS THING
I WILL TAKE THIS AWAY 'CAUSE IT LOOKS MESSY
UH TH UH DO YOU MEAN THE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN US
YEAH WELL AT FIRST I WAS REALLY STRESSED
BUT THEN AS I KNEW THE TEMPO THAT I HAD TO BE ON THE SECOND TIME I THINK I DID A BIT BETTER
WELL YOU DID BECOME MORE ASSERTIVE THE THE SECOND TIME ROUND SO THAT YEAH
AND UH AS I SAID UH I UH HAVE NO IDEA HOW POWERPOINT WORKS
BUT ONCE I GET TO KNOW THE PROGRAM PROBABLY I MEAN IT LOOKS BETTER YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW YOU CAN DRAW SOMETHING ON THE SKETCH BOARD AND THEN TAKE IT THERE OR WHATEVER
WELL S SEE YOU IN A SECOND HUH
YEAH WE HAVE TO PULL IT THIS WAY HUH
NO N I I ALREADY DID IT
NO THAT'S THAT'S FOR THE TRENDY UH FEEL AND LOOK
YEAH B BUT
YEAH WE C COULD WE ONLY NEED THE THE THE THE THE MENU ARROW ARROW BUTTON UH THING
SO YOU DO ONE INTE YOU CAN DO ONE INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON
BUT BUT TH THE COST OF ONE INTEGRATED BUTTON IS FAR MORE THAN A FEW EXTRA PUSH BUTTONS
SO WE HAVE TO TO MAKE IT S UH MORE UH IT HAS TO BE
WE WE D
WE LOSE OUR WHOLE CONCEPT
UH SO NO WE JUST WE KEEP THE L. C. D.
IF WE DO UH TWO INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTONS WE CAN DROP ALL THE THE PUSH BUTTONS
WITH WITH ONE UH INTEGRATED BUTTON WE CAN UH DO THE WHOLE MENU THING
SO WE DO ONE ONE S YEAH
NO THE BUTTONS THOSE ARE REALLY NEEDED
OH THAT
WH WHAT WE COULD DO IS UM
JUST SOMETHING ELSE THAN THAN BLACK OR WHITE I THINK
OH JUST OH MA MAKE IT TWO SPECIAL COLOURS BUT WE ONLY HAVE ONE BUTTON
IT'S IN OH YEAH IT WAS INTEGRATEDS
AH I
S
NO WE PUT THE ELECTRONICS INTO THE FASHION
YEAH FOUR IS OKAY
THREE PLUS
NO IT'S IF YOU PRESS TWICE ON THE PLUS BUTTON THEN YOU GET S S
JUST COUNT IT TO YEAH
SOME QUESTIONS ARE YEAH
YEAH WE WE CAN JUST UH USE THIS ONE
AND THEN UH OVER PAINT IT WITH UH UH THE GREEN UH HE ONLY NEEDS ONE BUTTON
OR WE HAVE TO DELETE THIS ONE OR
UH THAT'S THE INFRARED UH THING
UM UH IT'S JUST A SCROLL YEAH IS IT'S HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL
MAYBE THAT'S A S A SPECIAL COLOUR FOR IT
UH
OH WHAT
OH IT'S IT'S JUST ONE COMPUTER
SPECIALLY THE THE R.
DO THEY HAVE A LO OH THE HERE
IS THIS UH THE LAST ASSIGNMENT
BUG
NO IT OH
HEY YOU'VE GOT IT UH READ ONLY
IT'S TOO UH
YOU'VE TO MAKE IT S UH
OH WE'RE ALWAYS LONG
YEAH CAN WE T CAN WE GET TO THAT I
OH IT'S NOT WORKING ANYMORE
I THINK THE POWERPOINT IS IS TOO LIMITED
YOU CAN'T UH DRAW EASY IN IN POWERPOINT
THE DRAWING BOARD HAS TO BE INTEGRATED INTO POWERPOINT SO THAT YOU CAN JUST EASILY
UH YEAH
SO THAT'S KIND OF ON YOUR MOUSE AND THEN YOU CAN CLICK IT ADJUST IT CLICK AGAIN AND THEN YOU'RE OUT OF IT
YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME SOME BUTTON IN THE MENU TO GO BACK
NOT S NOT SOUND I GUESS
I GUESS THE THE SCREEN WAS MORE POPULAR THAN UM THAN THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WHO LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION THAN AN L. C. D. SCREEN
BUT Y Y
AND THEN AND THEN USE UM
AND THE MENU BUTTON DOES ALSO DOES THE OKAY FUNCTION THEN
S SO SO YOU ACTIVATE THE MENU
AND THEN FOR THE MENU UM YOU CAN HAVE A BUTTON THAT ACTIVATES MENU
OR D OR DO WE JUST INTEGRATE AN AN AN SCROLL WHEEL WITH A PUSH BUTTON
AND THEN IF THE MOMENT YOU USE THE SCROLL WHEEL THE THE THE MENU GETS ACTIVATED
AND THEN YOU CAN SCROLL CHOOSE AN OPTION CLICK ON IT IT GOES INTO AN FEATURE
OR OR UNDER EACH OPTION YOU SET A YOU SET AN A SCREEN THING WHAT SAYS BACK
AND IN THAT MENU SCROLL CLICK ONE STEP BACK
SO THAT THEN YOU NEED FIVE BUTTONS AND ONE INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON
THOSE FIVE WHICH I MENTIONED AND THEN MENU AND THEN
F OF THE FOUR THINGS
YEAH TH POWER
TH YEAH THAT'S FIVE
OH WELL OKAY
INSTEAD OF R
AH NO HARD PLASTIC
YOU FORGOT THAT
SO THE ONLY OPTION IS AN HAND DYNAMO
OH NO THA OH THAT'S ONE EURO RIGHT
ON THE SCREEN
IT S IT SAVES US FOUR EUROS AND IT COSTS US TWO AND A HALF
SO THAT'S NO OPTION
S YEAH
SO I RATHER HAVE AN HAND DYNAMO THAN THAN DROP THE COLOUR
OR OR DO WE OR DO WE DO UNCURVED AND FLAT
S WHAT WHAT IS SPECIAL F OH YEAH SPECIAL FORM
SO DO D UH MAKE IT A SPECIAL COLOUR THEN
YEAH MA MAKE IT A SPECIAL COLOUR THEN
OH F FRUSTRATED
TRUE OR FALSE AND THEN ON A SCALE OF SEVEN POINTS A SCALE AS WE ALL KNOW IT
YEAH THE US U
IT IT IT'S IT'S MAINLY CON MAINLY CONCENTRATING ON A LOT OF FUNCTIONS IN THIS QUESTION
YOU CAN YOU CAN MA YEAH YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF EXTENDED MENUS
I MEAN THE THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ALMOST UNLIMITED TO TO BUILD IN MENUS IN THE SCREEN
SO ON A SCALE FROM
YOU SAY THREE AND YOU YOU SAID AL ALSO THREE
THREE
OKAY WELL I SAY STILL TWO BUT IT HAS TO BE THREE THEN
UH
OH IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BOLD ANYMORE
I MEAN IT HIDES ALL THOSE FUNCTION
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THEM YOU DON'T S YOU S JUST SCROLL OVER THEM
F I DON'T KNOW WHERE
DO WE HA STILL HAVE A POWER BUTTON
YOU J YOU JUST PUSH IT IN FOR YEAH JUST JUST PUSH IT IN FOR TH FOR THREE SECONDS OR SOMETHING AND THEN YEAH
YEAH UH ON THE OTHER UH ON ONE SIDE I WOULD SAY YES AND THE OTHER SIDE I WOULD SAY NO
NO WE HAVE N WE HAVE NO BUTTONS LEFT
SO SO YOU HAV SO YOU YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE CLICK I MEAN
BUT BUT EASE OF USE WAS NOT VERY IMPORTANT MAY I REMIND YOU
WELL I THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH IN THE MIDDLE
YOU HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THEM IN IN THE IN THE S IN THE SCREEN IN THE MENU
SO MAYBE IT'S MORE LIKE A F A FIVE
BUT IT HAS AT LEAST ONE INNOVATION
UH THI UH THAT'S THE OTHER QUESTION
OH NOT THE BOLD ONE
YEAH WE HAVE SINGLE CURVE NOW AND NO AND NO MATERIAL
OH RED
SO A SIX MORE
YEAH UH I WOULD GO FOR THE SIX TOO
IN USE BOTH BATTERY AS CASING
THAN
SO A FOUR
IT'S IT G IT G GOES IT'S NOT THE BEST WE COULD DO I GUESS
BUT IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH THE BUDGET BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT THE BAD IDEA WE HAD SO
UH
UH
I ALL MADE IT PO I I ALL MADE IT I ALL MADE IT POSSIBLE UH FOR A POSITIVE QUESTIONS SO WE CAN COUNT IT
OH EASY
YEAH JUST USE OH THERE THO UH THERE'S NO N THERE'S NO NUM PADS
THREE PLUS ONE FOUR
UH YEAH
ARE YOU HERE
TW
THAT'S UH THREE UH OR LE LESS THAN A THREE
DI DIVIDED BY NINE MAKES THREE POINT ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE
RE RELEVANT MOST USED FUNCTION
AND THEN MATCHES THE OPERA OF THE USER WAS ALSO A GOOD THING
BECAU BUT THE PICTURE WOULD BE A LOT DIFFERENT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DROP THOSE UH THOSE THINGS I GUESS
SO TH
YEAH WE WE HAVE TO MAYBE IF WE HAVE TO REDESIGN IT ON THIS
THE PLAYFULNESS WE DECIDED TO USE KINETIC ENERGY AS A POWER SOUR
Y YOU HAVE YOU HAVE DONE THE FIRST TWO
THE ITEMS WE HAD TO DROP
UH
Y Y YOU YOU YOU PUSH THE BUTTON OR SOMETHING
LOOK MORE LOOKS MORE LIKE A CAMPFIRE
NO IT'S ON THE ON THE BEAMER I GUESS
BUT IT'S IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IN THE FRONT THIS KIND OF SHAPE BECAUSE IT LOOKS NICE
I MEAN YOU SEE MORE OF THIS THAN OF THAT
OOH
BUT I DON'T SEE A DETECTOR OVER THERE
OR JUST MESSED IT UP
BUT TH THIS ONE WASN'T GOOD BECAUSE IF I WAS DRAWING HERE I DREW A LINE AND THEN IT CAME OVER HERE
OOH
SILLY
SO IT AFTER THE AFTER AFTER THESE FIVE MINUTES YOU HAVE TO
UH YEAH
AND WE MOVE MORE TO TO WORKING TOGETHER AS TEAM BECAUSE AT FIRST YOU YOU MAKE YOUR INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION
AND THEN COME HERE AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE OTHERS HAVE TO MAKE
YEAH ESPECIALLY IF F F IF YOU SEE UH YOU SE YOU SAW THE LARGEST DIFFERENCE FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND MEETING I GUESS
ALSO NOT ONLY THE DRAWING AND THE THE MAKING OF THE THING ITSELF BUT ALSO IN EXPLAINING IT TO THE OTHER PEOPLE BY MEANS OF UH
AND AND JUST PUT THE PEN IN INTO IT AND THEN IT CAME ONTO MY SCREEN AND IT LOOKED PERFECTLY
THAN THE SCREEN
WELL IT IT'S USE ESPECIALLY USEFUL I GUESS TO TO EVALUATE DESIGNS AND GRAPH GRAPHICAL STUFF
BUT IT IT'S USEFUL TO TO SHOW SOMETHING TO TO AN A SMALL AUDIENCE AND THEN TO
THESE THESE KIND OF SCREENS THIS SIZE ARE USEFUL TO DISCUSS THINGS
WELL SEE YOU SOON
UH BEFORE I START WITH THE WITH THE MEETING I HAVE A FEW THINGS TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE THE SETTING WE'RE IN
AND UH AS I CAN SEE YOU UH YOU HAVE PLACED YOUR LAPTOPS UH EXACTLY ON THE PLACE WHERE IT MUST BE
SO THEY CAN SEE OUR FACES
WELCOME AT THE KICK OFF MEETING
UH THEN UH A LITTLE BIT OF ACQUAINTANCE ACQUAINTANCE TO UH TO TO OURSELVES
UH THAT WILL BE DONE UH WITH A TOOL TRAINING FROM THE HE THESE TWO UH SMART BOARDS
FIRST A LITTLE ABOUT THE PROJECT AIM
UH THE THE THE AIM IS TO MAKE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
UH MAYBE YOU HAVE READ UH READ THE WEBSITE
UH THERE ARE THREE STAGES
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO UH UH MAKE F UH KIND OF FUNCTIONS IN THE REMOTE
UH WE GO UH TO DIG IN UH REALLY ABOUT HOW THE THE TE THE TECHNICAL OF IF IT'S UH IT'S POSSIBLE TECHNICAL WISE
UH EACH STAGE IS UH UH IS BROKEN UP IN TWO UH TWO STAGES INDIVIDUAL WORK AND A MEETING
UM AND AS YOU UH MAY HAVE HEARD THE DOCUMENTS IN THE SHARED FOLDER UH CAN BE UH SHOWED ON THIS SCREEN
NOT IN Y THE THE MY DOCUMENTS
UH
THIS UH IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH THE SAVE THE PRINT THE UNDO THE BLANK THE SELECT THE PEN
UM WE MUST NOT FORGET UH EVERYTHING WE DRAW ON HERE UH ALL MUST BE SAVED
AT UH THE WHITE BOARD ON THE LEFT
EVERY UH EVERY ONE OF US UH MUST DRAW OUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND UH TELL UH TELL US WHY WE UH HAD UH CHOSEN THAT ANIMAL
'CAUSE WE UH REALLY DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER AND UH IT'S KINDA NEW
SO GETTING USED TO EACH OTHER WE CAN UH HAVE A LITTLE FUN THEN BEFORE WE UH DIG IN REALLY TO THE HARD STUFF
IT'S NOT UH FULLY REAL TIME SO UH WATCH IT
WELL I'M GONNA PAINT IN THE RED
WELL UNDO
MAY UH PAINT UH NEXT
YOU DON'T SEE IT UH AT THE EARS
'CAUSE HE LOOKS LIKE THE UH THE THE LION FROM THE LION KING
SO WE UH FOUND IT KINDA COOL TO UH NAME IT AFTER A LION
HE'S HAPPY WITH US SO UH
TIM
OKAY TIM
SO NO RED OR GREEN
AH
SO I THINK YOU CAN SEE IT'S REAL UH REALLY A EASY PROGRAMME TO USE
UH OH
BUT WHAT IS HE UH
IS IT A RABBIT
IS IT A WHITE RABBIT F IT'S THE WHITE RABBIT FROM THE MATRIX
WELL I THINK THE DOG IS THE THE MOST UH ARTISTIC
OKAY NOW WE'RE GONNA DIG INTO THE TO THE SERIOUS STUFF
EURO
WE CAN SELL OUR R REMOTES TO
I'M GONNA JOIN YOU AT THE TABLE
WELL WHAT WHAT'S THE MOST UH IMPORTANT THING AT A REMOTE CONTROL
SO NOT A NOT A REMOTE CONTROL WHO UH UH WHICH CAN UH CAN BE USED FOR TELEVISION AND A D. V. D. AND RADIO AND OR JUST ONLY
IF YOU HAVE THEM ON UH I CAN UH
OH IN CASE YOU WANT IT
YEAH BE THE SCREENS
OH THAT PEN DRAWINGS
UH NO I THINK UH WHEN IT IS UH IN WORD AND YOU HAVE SAVED IT IN THE SHARED DOCUMENTS FOLDER YOU CAN SHOW IT THERE
SO IT BE UH A MULTI PURPOSE UH VERY TECHNICALLY UH HIGH UH
SO WE MUST FOCUS ON THINGS WHO ARE REALLY UH REALLY ADD SOMETHING TO UH TO
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE THAT IT'S UH AT THE BEGINNING OF SUCH A PROJECT
UH BUT WE MUST NOT UH LOSE UH SIGHT OF THE THE USER UH UH FRIENDLY UH
SO UH YOU UH WILL HAVE UH INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS WHERE I PRESUME UH WILL BE SOME FEEDBACK UH VIA THE M THE MAIL
UM WHA
WE UH MUST UH HAVE A LITTLE OR KINDA UH UH UH HOW DO YOU CALL IT
UH
SOME BASIC THINGS WE CO WE WANT TO GOING TO DO
WILL COME IN HANDY
BUT IF YOU SAY UH IS IT UH UH ONE WAY OR MULTI PURPOSE THAT'S A
SO UH EACH INDIVIDUALLY I INDIVIDUALLY UH MUST THINK ON WHAT'S UH AT UH HIS POINT OF VIEW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
HI
HI MY NAME'S UH
BY THE WAY WHY WAS YOUR CAT UH RED
UH
UH THANKS
UH
UH I FIGURED THIS IS A PRETTY B GOOD IMPRESSION OF A RABBIT
I FIGURE WE COULD GET BACK TO IT ON THE NEXT MEETING ACTUALLY
YEAH ACTUALLY IT IS
OR EDIT
HI
ACH
HE DOES HAVE BODY UH
OH IT IS A TURTLE
AND AND IT YEAH WHEN IT DIED WE DIDN'T GET A NEW ONE OR SOMETHING
AH COLOUR
UH OH
OH HE IS THE ARTISTIC DESIGN
WELL WITH THE INTERFACE IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO HA TO DRAW HERE AND DISPLAY THERE UH
THAN ON THE WITH YEAH I M I MEAN LIKE UH LIKE ON HERE DRAWING DRAWING UH
YEAH HOW MUCH IS IT
AND MY OPINION IS YOU SHOULD KEEP IT AS BASIC AS POSSIBLE
UH
IS IT POSSIBLE TO OPEN PEN DRAWINGS IN THIS UH ON THIS SCREEN
UH BUT UM WHICH THE ONES WE MADE ON THE
OH ONLY IN WORD OKAY
UM ONE THING UH WE MUST FIRST AGREE ON UH WHAT WE'RE GOING TO M GOING TO MAKE
AH OKAY
WELL YEAH IF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS HAVE TO BE DESIGNED I I'VE GOTTA KNOW FOR WHAT KIND OF MACHINES THEY WILL BE
OR UH WILL IT BE WITH UH WITH BLUETOOTH OR
I'M UH TIM
YOU G YOU GET ELECTROCUTED OR
THE THE ONE WHO SAYS IT FIRST GETS A RAISE
MM YEAH I HAVE IT AT HOME
AH
NEW
UH
UH
UH IT'S P
THINK YOU UH PICKED THE WRONG UH FUNCTION
WHA
BUT AT THE OTHER HAND UH A PEN LIKE THAT IS EASY TO HOLD IN YOUR HAND AND
W WITH THIS PAPER IT'S TOO MU TOO EXPENSIVE
UH
CAN I SHOW THEM ON THE ON THE BIG SCREEN
UM JUST THE STANDARD THING LI THINGS LIKE UH INTUITIVE UH SMALL FAIRLY CHEAP
AND UH BY MAKING IT MULTI PURPOSE IT UH HAS A NEW FEATURE ADDS A NEW FEATURE TO THE MARKET AND DISTINGUISH FROM UH FROM CURRENT PRODUCTS
WHEN YOU'RE ON A CERTAIN CHANNEL YOU CAN SEE ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN UH WHAT PROGRAMMES ARE COMING UP OR
TO THE CURRENT MARKET
LOOK YOU GOT SOME CHEAP UH REMOTE CONTROLS THERE
BUT IT'S BUT BUT THIS IS JUST FROM MARKETING UH ASPECT
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT USER INTERFACE OR DESIGN
UH
UH THA THAT'S A SAME STEP FURTHER
UH
LIKE WE ALL HAVE A LIST OF UH THINGS THAT HAS TO B THAT HAVE TO BE IN IT OR HOW IT HAS TO BE LIKE
AND THEN IN THE NEXT MEETING WE DECIDE
AND THEN YOU S THEN YOU CAN DELETE UH
THE O THE OBSOLETE UH DETAILS
HI
A MINUTE PLEASE MY UH LAPTOP IS UH OH THERE IT IS THANK YOU
SO NOT ME BUT ONLY YOU UH WILL UH PRESENT UH THE THE THINGS YOU WORKED ON UH THE LAST UH HALF HOUR
FIRST ONE IS UH THEY THINK THAT UH TELETEXT TELETEXT BECOMES OUTDATED UH AND INTERNET WILL BE THE THE MAIN UH FOCUS
SO IT UH NOT GONNA IT'S NOT GONNA BE A MULTI PURPOSE REMOTE CONTROL SO UH THAT'S ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND
BUT WITH THIS UH NEW REMOTE UH THEY UH WILL UH WOULD LIKE TO REACH UH A GROUP UH YOUNGER THAN UH FORTY
BUT NOT REALLY UH FOR NOW IS THAT THEY UH WANT THE THE THE SLOGAN AND THE AND THE LOGO UH TO UH TO BE RECOGNISED MORE IN THE REMOTE
SO WE HAVE UH FORTY MINUTES SO I THINK UH NOT MORE THAN TEN MINUTES UH UH PER PRESENTATION UH EACH
AND PLEASE UH USE UH ALL THE THE THE FACILITIES SO THAT YOU HAVE EITHER SMARTBOARDS THE THE WORD FILES WHAT YOU UH WHATEVER YOU WANT
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TIM AND UH JANUS DON'T UH TALK TO TEN MINUTES SO UH TAKE YOUR TIME
UH YOU YOU JUST SAID UM UH YOU WANTED TO TO COMBINE MORE FUNCTIONS IN ONE SO UH YOU YOU WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
THEN YOU CAN'T ESCAPE THE THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE BUTTONS UH WHICH GIVE S UH MORE OPTIONS THAN ONE
BUT LET'S NOT UH GO TOO WIDE ABOUT THE THOSE THINGS THAT'S THAT WHY WE'RE HERE
IT'S IT'S A NICE IDEA BUT I THINK THAT'S WE WEL LATER IN THE STAGE
THE MORE DIFFICULT FUNCTIONS UH TO BE UH MAYBE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN BUT TO KEEP THIS AS UH NORMAL AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP IT ACCESSIBLE
OKAY AS YOU CAN SEE UH THE MINUTES FROM THE SECOND MEETING THIS ONE ARE UH ARE DONE
UH I'VE UH ADDED THE THIS UH FOUR THINGS FROM THE MANAGEMENT BOARD JUST TO KEEP IN MIND
UH SO THAT CAN BE UH CAN BE READ OUT
UH A F A FEW THINGS I UH I NOTICED UH WERE UM
OOH
UH TH THE THE MAIN POINTS IN UH THIS UH UH IN THIS UH MEETING IS I THINK UH HOW UH IT'S GOING TO LOOK UH WITH UH WE MUST KEEP IT SIMPLE
SO THEY DON'T UH YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG UH THING FULL OF UH BUTTONS OR UH UM AND UH THE POINT THAT UH YOU UH WANNA USE ONE UH CONTROLLER UH FOR UH UH HYPOTHETICALLY EACH TELEVISION
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE UH UH AN YEAH BUT YOU HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET RANGE SO YOU HAVE I THINK A BIG RANGE OF
N YEAH
UH I WILL PUT MY MINUTES UH I HAVE UPDATED THEM SO UH S THEY'RE UPDATED IN THE SHARED FOLDER TOO
SO UH UH WAIT FOR YOUR EMAIL AND UH HOPEFULLY YOU GET IT DONE UH IN THE IN THE THIRTY MINUTES
AND I W WILL SEE YOU AFTER THE LUNCH BREAK AND THE THIRTY MINUTES
UH YEAH
UH THEN WOULD IT BE UH ONE O'CLOCK
OR WE WE ASK OUR PERSONAL COACH
THANK YOU UH THAT WAS A VERY UH GOOD SESSION I THINK WE UH WE
UH YE WELL
YEAH BECAUSE UH ALL UH THINGS ARE UH STORED IN SMART BOARD DOT UH X. D. K. AND THAT'S IN
YOU ALL UH HAVE THE THE QUESTIONNAIRE AGAIN ABOUT UH THE AFTER WORK
UH WELL IT'S IT'S SIMPLY FILLING OH NO IT'S UH IT'S ALSO FILLING OUT NO I'D DO IT AFTER LUNCH I THINK
MY EXECUTIVE UH BIG ROOM WITH THE WITH THE PANTING
HI
NO ONE DRAWING IT
AH OKAY SO FOCUSING MORE ON THE USED BUTTONS
COULD YOU USE PERHAPS UH ONE BUTTON FOR MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS LIKE EXAMPLE PRESSING IT IN LONGER MAKES IT SWITCH TO AN DIFFERENT FUNCTION FOR EXAMPLE
YEAH MA PERHAPS JUST JUST AN IDEA
UH YEAH YEAH I'LL GO SURE
RIGHT UH I'LL BE UH EXPLAINING A BIT ABOUT UH WORKING DESIGN ABOUT UH THE PROJECT
WELL UH WHAT I DID WAS I DISSECTED UH UH CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS AND UM I VIEWED HOW HOW THEY W LOOKED
AND I'LL EXPLAIN A BIT ABOUT UH HOW IT WORKS AND HOW WE COULD UH BUILD ONE AND WHY I THINK SEVERAL POSSIBILITIES UH THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE EARLIER MEETING FALLS OFF
AND THE THING ABOUT THAT IS UM THE REMOTE CONTROLS UH HAVE TO ACT AS A T. V. OR UH A STEREO OR SOMETHING
AND THOSE UH HAVE A TRANSMITTER THAT'S ALSO FOCUSED ON INFRARED
SO IF WE WANT TO UH BUILD UH MM A REMOTE CONTROL UH WITH BLUETOOTH FOR INSTANCE THEN UH THE T. V. SHOULD HAVE BLUETOOTH TOO IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE
SO THAT WOULD MEAN EXTRA COST FOR THE USER AND THUS UH THAT'S THAT WOULDN'T MEAN A A CHEAP UH REMOTE CONTROL FOR US
SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY UH MEAN LOWER COSTS AND UH I THAT COULD MEAN FOR US A GOOD THING UH 'CAUSE UH WELL WE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD A RELATIVELY CHEAP UH A CHEAP UH REMOTE
WELL UH AS I MENTIONED READY WE HAVE SOME BLUETOOTH WELL IT MAY BE POSSIBLE BUT UH I FIGURED IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE IN WITHIN OUR BUDGET
YEAH ACTUALLY I HAVE T
IS WHY NOT UH INTRODUCE A SPEECH FUNCTION LIKE WHERE IS THE REMOTE
I FIGURED THAT WOULD BE BEST 'CAUSE WHEN THE BATTERY UH STOPS FUNCTIONING UH WE COULD JUST UH USE YOU COULD JUST GO OUT AND BUY A NEW ONE
SO WE DIDN'T AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL UH TO BE TOO COMPLICATED ABOUT THAT
BUT UH THE INFRARED BUTTON UH WORKS ONLY VIA THE CHIP AND THE SUBCOMPONENT TO UH THE SWITCH THERE IS A SWITCH UH BETWEEN THESE
WHEN THE SWITCH IS PRESSED IN A W ON THIS THIS CASE IT SWITCHES A BUTTON
AND IN UH IMMEDIATELY A L A BULB LIGHTS UP UH DISPLAYING TO THE USER THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED
THAT'S UH THAT'S SO THE H USER WON'T BE UM THINKING WELL UH DID THE BUTTON BE PRESSED W WHAT HAPPENED UH
OR I PRESS BUTTON BUT NOTHING'S HAPPENING ON THE T. V. SO IS IS SOMETHING WRONG OR SOMETHING
SO THAT'S JUST TO UH TO TO EXPLAIN THE OF TO TO UH MAKE IT CLEARER TO THE USER
AND THOSE UH INTERPRETED BY THE DEVICE WELL IN THIS CASE THE TELEVISION
JUST LIKE YOU SAID UH WELL THE MOST USERS N UH YOU HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS AND YOU U U USE YOU DON'T USE THEM
SO WHY WHY SHOULD WE INVENT UH W SPEND MORE TIME ON THOSE
SO UH NO INPUT FROM THE TELEVISION
YES BUT WHAT SHOULD WE UH S I I I F I AGREE WITH YOU
THESE ALL UH ALL STUFF THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT
LIKE I SAID UH USE ONE BUTTON FOR INSTANCE FOR M MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS
OR WELL UH JUST HIDE THE FEW BUTTONS O OF SWITCHING IT OPEN OR SOMETHING THE USUAL UH STUFF
WELL YOU D YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT UH SEVERAL T. V. S UH DON'T EVEN HAVE A MENU STRUCTURE OR THEY HAVE A VERY SIMPLE MENU STRUCTURE
SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT NOT ALL UH D NOT OUR REMOTE WON'T BE ABLE TO WORK ON ALL TELEVISIONS
UH ONE ONE SMALL UH TOUCH SCREEN UH APPLET AND UH I'LL JUST MAKE UM UH LET'S SAY FIFTEEN BUTTONS ON IT
AND UH WE HAVE THREE OF THOSE UH ACTUALLY JUST UH MENUS WITH SUB MENUS WITH OR SUB ITEMS SUB FUNCTIONS
YOU JUST HAVE A F A FEW SELECTED BUTTONS AND UH A FEW MENUS
AND WITH THIS IDEA YOU COULD ACTUALLY MAKE UH SEVERAL YOU CAN ALSO IMPROVE UH LATER ON
YEAH I WOU I WOULD ACTUALLY GO FOR THE
THAT IS POSSIBLE THAT WELL THAT ACTUALLY DEPENDS ON THE TELEVISION BUT I THINK I FIGURE THAT WOULD BE
WELL Y YOU S YOU SEE THE FI UH THING IS WHEN YOU BUY A REMOTE YOU YOU SET THE UH CHANNELS
THE THE CHANNELS ARE DIFFERENT ON EACH TE TELEVISION THEY AREN'T SET IN A PRESET ORDER
SO UH IF YOU UH LOCK ON A REMOTE UH LET'S SAY CHANNEL FIFTEEN
YEAH THAT WOULD B
UH
I I DO
W WE ARE AIMING FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE AND THEY THEY CHOSE
I ACTUALLY USE ONE OF THOSE WHEN THEY ARE THEY ARE KINDA KINDA TROUBLESOME
BUT BUT THE THING IS WHE WHEN YOU UH START UH BUILDING SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU HAVE TO BUILD A RECEIVER INTO THE UH T INTO THE REMOTES
AH IT IS
IT IS DEFINITELY PO
YEAH MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE SERVICE CEN OR YOU COULD WELL YOU COULD S ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE PLACE HOLDER YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER
WE COULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT INTO IT BUT I DUNNO IT IT WOULD BE UH BRINGING MORE COSTS UH WITH WITH IT AND
YEAH MY VOTE GOES OUT TO THE RIGHT
EXPORT
N OH
TO ROOM
HI
WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE A PRESENTATION ABUT SOME OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THESE DESIGN AND UH USABILITY FUNCTIONS
TECHNICAL POSSIBILITIES AND THE USER FRIENDLINESS IN ONE SO IF YOU UM GOING TO DESIGN A REMOTE THAT LOOKS GOOD
AND ANOTHER ONE IS UM THE USE UM OF MANY FUNCTIONS WILL WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT
SO USE AS AS LITTLE FUNCTIONS AS POSSIBLE OR AT LEAST DON'T DISPLAY THEM ALL AT ONCE ON THE SAME REMOTE
IF YOU HAVE FIFTY FUNCTIONS YOU DON'T WANT FIFTY BUTTONS UH T UH TO BE SHOWN AT THE SAME TIME
'CAUSE WHEN YOU VISIT AN INTERNET UH SITE YOU DON'T WANT FIFTY LINKS UH TO SEE BUT MAYBE USE A HIERARCH HIERARCHY UH STRUCTURE
AND UH WELL ONE OF THE IDEAS WAS MAYBE UH USE TOUCH SCREEN BUT S I DON'T KNOW IN HOW FAR THAT IS POSSIBLE
SINCE WE ARE STICKING TO UH UM INFRARED AND AND THE REMOTE CANNOT RECEIVE ANYTHING BUT UH WE MIGHT UH CONSIDER THAT
MANY FUNCTIONS BUT WELL YOUR THUMB IS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN TH IT THAN THIS
WHERE THE HELL HE HERE I GUESS AND YEAH WHEN YOU HAVE TO UH USE SOMETHING ELSE
N UH NOT TO GIVE TOO MANY OPTIONS AND AND IF POSSIBLE UH THE BUTTONS SHOULD GIVE A DR DIRECT ACTION NOT FIRST SELECT
YEAH THIS SO THAT'S THE THING YOU HAVE TO WEIGH AGAINST EACH OTHER
DO WE WANT TO USE A FEW OPTIONS AND MIGHT NOT BE SO OR ORIGINAL
OR UH MULTI PURPOSE AS WE THOUGHT OR DO WE WANT TO USE UM MANY BUTTONS
OR UM DOES HAVE TO F EVERYTHING UH BE IN REMOTES
UH SO THAT'S MY RECOMMENDATION IF YOU USE MANY OPTIONS IN ONE BUTTLE BUTTON
UM DISPLAY THE MENU ON THE T. V. AND DON'T UM USE COMBINATION OF T OF TWO BUTTONS AT THE SAME TIME OR PRESSING BUTTONS THREE TIMES FOR FIVE SECONDS
IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR MOST USERS
WELL YEAH THE RESTRICTIONS OF WHAT'S UH IS ON THE MARKET TODAY UM YOU SHOULD KEEP IT S AT THIS
USE BIG CLEAR BUTTONS
SO MAYBE WE'LL LOOSE A FEW OPTION UH OPTIONS BUT I THINK I THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT
IT UH IT HAS TO WORK AT ONCE AND MORE ADVANCED OPTIONS MAY BE PUT IT S SOMEWHERE AWAY ON THE REMOTE
AND YEAH IF YOU WANT TO UH UH S PUT ON STAND BY OR CHANGE THE CHANNEL THAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE POSSIBLE TO DO
UM WELL YEAH AS YOU ALREADY TOLD GIVE SOME FEEDBACK
IF THE USER IS PUSHING A BUTTON HE SHOULD KNOW IF THE TELEVISION OR N AT LEAST REMOTE IS REACTING AND NOT JUST THAT THE BATTERIES MAY BE LOW
AND UM WELL MY CONCLUSION IS UH IS UH LESS IS MORE KEEP IT SIMPLE
SO UH MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST EASE DOWN ON THE FUNCTIONALITY TO UH TO KEEP IT ACCESSIBLE ON T BECAUSE YOU ALL KNOW
IF THERE ARE A LOT OF FUNCTION ON THE THE TELEVISION SOME YOU YOU'LL NEVER KNOW UH AND NEVER USE
AND THEREFORE IT'S UH IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE VOLUME OR CHANNEL THAT IS ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE AND EASY AND OTHER FUNCTIONS UM THAT ARE NOT SO IMPORTANT UM WELL YOU WE SHOULD CONSIDER JUST NOT USING THEM OR AT LEAST PUTTING THEM SOMEWHERE ON THE REMOTE WHERE THEY'RE NOT IN THE WAY FOR THE FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS
PUT A LOGO ON IT AND MAYBE USE IT UH IN SOME AESTHETIC UH AESTHETIC FORM
BUT UH TH THE IMPORTANT BUTTONS M MAKE THEM ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE AND PUSHABLE AND CLEAR AND MAYBE USE A TOUCH SCREEN
THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS YOU UH YOU JUST SEE A MENU FROM SYSTEM FUNCTIONS OR TELETEXT FUNCTIONS
AND YOU JUST CHOOSE ONE AND THEN ALL ALL THE OPTIONS WILL BECOME AVAILABLE AND YOU JUST C S YEAH T SCROLL THROUGH THEM
USE THE SAME CONCEPT AS HERE KEEP THE BUTTONS ALWAYS AVAILABLE AND USE THE LOWER PART OF THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR THE REST
OKAY I AGREE BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY ALWAYS UM MAKE THE SAME BUTTONS ACCESSIBLE
SO USE JUST FOR SPECIAL OPTIONS A PART OF THE TOUCH SCREEN
AND SO UM AN ELDER DESIGNER PICKS UP TH THE OF AN ELDER PARENTS OR GRANDPARENT PICKS UP THE REMOTE FROM THE LITTLE CHILD AND WHO'S ALL IN THE SYSTEMS FUNCTIONS
IS THAT POSSIBLE TO USE OR NO
WELL YEAH WELL DOES IT HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE TELEVISION
AND THEN AFTER THAT YOU CAN UM USE SOME S INSERT SOME PASSWORDS AS BEING APPARENT THAT THE CHILDREN CANNOT USE THIS UH CHANGE THE SETTINGS OF THE T. V.
OH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WELL B BUT MAKE IT A SEPARATE OPTION IN THE MENU SO THAT IT'S IT'S DIF DIS DISPLAYED FROM UH DISPLAYED HERE SO UH PARENTS UH
YEAH YOU CAN DE DISPLAY IT ON THE ON THE OLD STYLE
WELL YOU CAN USE UM WHEN YOU UH HOW DO YOU CALL IT S UM SYNCHRONIZED THE UM REMOTE AND THE T. V. THEN THERE'S ALWAYS
THERE ARE ALWAYS UH POSSIBILITIES TO CHANGE THE COLOUR AND THE BRIGHTNESS AND THE VOLUME AND UM WELL MAYBE WE CAN LOOK OUT IF THERE'S OPTIONS THAT THE REMOTE UM IN ITS MEMORY CAN SEE WHAT KINDA T. V. IT IS
FROM AH IT'S A PHILIPS THIS AND THIS AND THAT AND THEN GIVE THE OPTIONS THAT ARE CAPABLE THE CAPABLE FROM THE T
UH SO THIS WOULDN'T BE A EXTRA FEATURE TO INCORPORATE THE MEN MENUS OF THESE
OH UM MO NO YOU CAN JUST SAY UH THE C
IN CODES Y YOU YOU GET A B A BOOK WITH CODES
I HAVE A PHILIPS H. FIFTY FIVE AND IT SAYS PRESS CODE FOUR FIVE FIVE AND YOU PRESS CODE FOUR FIVE FIVE ON THE UH IN THE REMOTE AND IT DISPLAYS ALL YOUR UH MENU OPTIONS
MEMORY IN THE IN THE REMOTE
YEAH WELL UM IF YOU LOOK AT THE UM MANUALS FROM UNIVERSAL UH REMOTES THERE ARE MAYBE UM THREE FOUR HUNDREDS T. V. S AT MAXIMUM
WELL AT UH YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE SHOP AND UH THEY
WELL ALREADY DIGITAL INFORMATION IS SENT T TO THE THE STANDARDS T. V. UH CONNECTIONS
YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S UH PROGRAMME IS ON ON THE NEW UH CHANNELS SO MAYBE J THEY WE CAN SEND THAT INFORMATION ALONG WITH STANDARD T. V. UH
YEAH YEAH UH S I THINK SOME I THINK IT'S GOOD IDEA YEAH
UM M FOR WHICH ONE ARE WE GOING
THAT ONE OR UH
BUT UH YOU'VE CONVINCED ME THAT UH IF YOU DI DISPLAY BUTTONS ABOUT THE SAME AS THEY WOULD LOOK ON A NORMAL UM REMOTE ALL ELDERLY PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO
OPENS UP IS TOO DIFFICULT OR UH
OH SO YEAH
YEAH IS IT POSSIBLE TO STORE THIS ON THE SHARE DOCUMENTS OR WHAT
'KAY SAVE IT AS AN IMAGE ON THE RES
NO AND USE AN IMAGE IF POSSIBLE
TO OUR P. C. S
IT GIVES THE NA OH
THE QUESTIONNAIRE FILL IN UH WE FILL OUT D AFTER LUNCH OR UH
WE CAN LEAVE THE P. C. ON I THINK YEAH AND RETURN TO THE
YEAH BRING TO I GOTTA BRING IT HOME
I HAVE SOME UH NEW FINDINGS ON UH MARKETING EXPERT LEVEL
THE METHOD I USED WAS UM GIVING ORDERS TO OUR USABILITY LAB UH TO DO A QUESTIONNAIRE
UM AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THE MARKET SHARE FOR THE FIRST AUDIENCE IS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT UM SIXTY FIVE
UM AND WHEN YOU SEE UH THE AUDIENCE
UH WHAT THE BUTTONS WERE UH THEY USE MOST HOW MUCH AN HOUR AND UH IN THE SECOND TABLE THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE BUTTONS
UM WHEN YOU MULTIPLY THEM YOU GET THE THESE THREE POINTS
UM I THINK IT'S GOOD UH THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE USER WANT WANTS UH AT LEAST THE THESE THREE POINTS HAVE TO BE UH VERY CLEAR
YEAH TH THE BEST THING YOU CAN GET UH ON T. V. LIKE GETTING INFORMATION
THAT'S A NE I IT IT'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S NOT INCORPORATED RIGHT NOW
YEAH PEOPLE FROM SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE WATCH A LOT OF T. V. MORE THAN UH PEOPLE WHO ARE EL UH ELDER
UM SECOND POINT WE HAVE TO IMPRO IMPROVE THE MOST USED FUNCTIONS AS I SAID HERE SWITCHING CHANNELS TELETEXT AND VOLUME CONTROLS
THIRD POINT UM THAT CAME OUT OF THE UH OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE UH PEOPLE USED TO UH
GET LOST OFF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER SO MAYBE IT'S AN IDEA FOR US UH TO DESIGN EX KIND OF PLACEHOLDER UH ON SIDE OF THE
UH NOT NOT THE R NOT THE FUNCTIONS BUT UH IT CAME OUT THAT A LOT OF BUTTONS WEREN'T EVEN USED UH ON A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH THEY HAVE TO BE ON IT J JUST TO T TO GET IT DONE IF NECESSARY
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH INCORPORATING BLUETOOTH OR A RADIO UH RECEIVER UH IN THE PLACE HOLDER NEXT TO THE T. V. CONNECTED TO THE T. V.
THAT IN THE MIDDLE ARE THE THE MAIN KEYS LIKE DISPLAYED ON THE
UH YEAH
CHANNEL SWITCHING AND THEN UH AT THE TOP OR AT THE BOTTOM SOME MENUS LIKE UH SETTINGS OR THAT YOU CAN DROP DOWN
I THINK SO TOO BUT AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE UM UH A LOT OF T. V. S HAVE DIFFERENT MENUS
AND WHEN YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR MENU UH AT YOUR DEVICE UH IT COULD BE THAT DON'T CORRESPOND TO THE MENU WHAT'S ACTUALLY ON T. V.
UH I THINK THE IDEA UH ABOUT UH TOUCH SCREEN
BECAUSE RECENTLY UH I SAW NEWS ITEM ON T. V. UM ABOUT
UH NEW TELEPHONES UH FOR ELDER PEOPLE
ONE THE ONE HAND UH
YEAH OKAY BUT BUT IF YOU PICK THE THE IDEA THE LEFT IDEA
YEAH BUT L LIKE MENU FUNCTIONS OR
AH OKAY
YEAH I HAD ANOTHER UH IDEA ABOUT MAYBE PARENTAL CONTROL
LIKE BUILDING IN UH SOME KIND OF PIN CODE UH WHICH ALLOWS UH PARENTS TO SWITCH TO ALL CHANNELS
YEAH TH THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT MAYBE UM IF YOU LOG IN FIRST AS A PARENT UM
YOU ADDRESS THE THE CHANNELS AND LIKE UH OH THAT'S CHANNEL FIFTEEN THAT'S UH
THAT'S AN A AN ADDED FEATURE
YEAH TH TH THOSE THINGS ARE NICE
YEAH BUT BUT IF YOU DISPLAY IT ON L. C. D. SCREEN WITH R R REALLY BIG NUMBERS
AND TH THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE YEAH
Y YOU SAW IT IN MY MARKETING REPORT THEY LIKE THE NEW FANCY STUFF SO
I TH I THINK WE CAN DO THAT TOO
THE MENUS UH ARE NOT IDENTICAL FOR ALL TH FOR ALL T. V. S SO YOU HAVE TO DISPLAY IT ON ONE UH T. V.
ADD TH THAT THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY
HE HE HE HE ME HE MEANS JUST JUST ONE OTHER THING
NOW WE UH JUST CONNECT UH THE T. V. TYPE UH TO A SET OF OPTIONS IN JUST JUST IN THE MEMORY
SO THAT IF YOU YEAH LIKE PROFILE SO THAT IF YOU UH TOUCH IN LIKE UH ONE FOUR ONE ZERO KIND OF T. V. UH
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND ON THE OTHER HAND UH IF YOU HAVE A REMOTE AND BUY A NEW T. V. THAT ISN'T INCORPORATED IN THE REMOTE
A FIRMWARE UPGRADE OR SOMETHING BUT FROM WHERE
AH
MAYBE W
NO M MAY NO MAYBE WE CAN INCORPORATE SOME KIND OF UH U. S. B. OR A FIREWIRE CONNECTION
SO THAT YOU CAN UH CONNECT IT TO THE P. C. AND DOWNLOAD THE NEWEST FIRMWARE FROM UH FROM THE INTERNET
MOST CHEAP OR CHEAPEST TO JUST DO THE UPDATES UH AT THE SERVICE CENTRE OR AT THE SHOP
IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT A LOT OF WORK JUST ONE UH DOCKING STATION WHERE YOU PUT IT IN PRESS START BLING BLING UPDATED
YEAH TH TH TH THAT I UH
AH
SAVE AS
SAVE AS
EXPORT
IN THIS DIRECTORY
AYE
AND WE UM MUST UH REACH A DECISION ON UH THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS
UM UH AND AT THE END UH I UH WHEN I FINISH IT OFF I HAVE SOME UH INPUT FROM UH A MASTER CLASS I UH VISITED
THE THE THE THE THE CONCEPTS ON UH WE UH WHERE WE UH MUST REACH A DECISION ON
UM UH OUR FROM UH ARE OF TWO SORTS
WE HAVE DECIDED TO DO A DO THE UH WITH A TOUCH SCREEN THAT MUST BE A CASE AROUND IT SO UH IT WON'T BE UH UH AS BREAKABLE
AT THE END UH I WILL TAKE NOTES UH AND AT THE END OF THE MINUTES UH WILL UH BE AT THE SHARED FOLDER
ONE ONE LITTLE QUESTION
UM ABOUT THE THE MATERIAL
I I UH I WOULD PREFER UH BOTH UH TOO
ME TOO
BRING IT ON
OH A WOODEN LOOK YEAH
MAYBE YOU COULD USE YOUR REMOTE AS A PHONE
THERE ARE NUMBERS ON IT SO UH
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T USE THAT TH GAMES WHEN YOU WATCHING TELEVISION I THINK
UH GREAT
UH
I THINK WE CAN DISCUSS A LITTLE ABOUT THE THE THREE UH KIND OF REVOLUTIONARY THINGS UH TIM UH CAME WITH
UH
THERE'S N NOT UH TOO MUCH DECISION ON UH THAT ONE SO UH I THINK THAT PARENTAL CONTROL IS A GOOD FUNCTION TO UH TO PUT IN THE REMOTE
NO BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE UH FIND IT UH MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT THEIR CHILDREN DON'T WATCH UH SEX OR VIOLENCE UH ON THE TELEVISION
UH
WELL I THINK THAT'S A B THERE'S A BIG MARKET FOR IT BECAUSE UH YOU YEAH
YOU READ MANY TIMES IN MAGAZINES SAME KIND OF STUFF AND YOU HEARD ON THE NEWS THAT UH THAT HE YEAH
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF UH PEOPLE WILL BELOW FORTY WHO HAVE UH CHILDREN IN YOUNG AGE UH WHO WHO WANT UM TO UH NOT WATCH UH VIOLENT OR UH
UH YOU YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR VIDEO RECORDER WITH SHOW VIEW
UH WHEN YOU TICK IN A NUMBER IT WILL UH START AND END UH RECORDING
BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOME OPTION THAT UH THAT T UH THE KIND OF SHOW VIEW NUMBERS ARE VIOLENT AND THAT THEY ARE BLOCKED OUT
IF WE DO IT WE WE MUST DO IT IN A KIND OF WAYS THAT LIKE A PROFILE
AND WHAT DO YOU UH GUYS THINK OF THE GAMES IN THE VOICE RECOGNITION
SO THAT WILL UH THAT THAT THAT MUST BE IN IT YOU THINK
SO THE GAMES UH ARE IN IT
THE VOICE RECOGNITION ARE NOT
AND THE PARENTAL CONTROL ARE
UH BUT UH WILL THERE UH UH LIKE THE FIRST IDEA UH FROM UH YOU CAN BUY IT WITHOUT AND UH WITH PARENTAL CONTR CONTROL
OR ARE WE GOING TO PUT IT IN AND UH JUST UH
YEAH YOU YO YEAH BUT MOST OFTEN NOT
THE CASE WILL BE DOUBLE CURVED AND UH RUBBER IN A FR FLASHY FRUITY COLOUR UH THAT WITH COVER IS REMOVABLE
UH TOO UH TOO MANY LEVELS
AND THE GAMES ARE IN IT
IT'S ALREADY INCORPORATED A LITTLE IN THAT CONCEPT
WE TAKE IT TO THE OTHER MEETING OKAY
I WENT TO UH A MASTER CLASS AND UH UH TWO THINGS UH ARE UH ARE UH CAN COME IN HANDY UH FOR US
FIRST THING UH IS UH WE TALKED ABOUT KNOWLEDGE UH MANAGEMENT
IT'S IT'S UH VERY HOT AT THE MOMENT SO IT'S IT'S MOSTLY FOR THE MANAGEMENT EXPERT TO TO LOOK WHAT OTHER UH MARKETING OR DID I SAID MANAGEMENT
WHAT OTHER COMPANIES UH HAD TO UH ALSO WITH THE THE THE THE MARKETING CAMPAIGN WHEN THEY PUT ON A NEWER REMOTE JUST SOME UH YEAH
UH THEY'RE A HA THEY'RE AT YEAH BENCHMARKING THAT'S THE WORD I SAW
AND UM UH IT CAME OUT THAT UM PEOPLE LIKE TO BUY THINGS FROM A SINGLE LARGE PROVIDER INSTEAD OF THOSE WHO UH ARE PARTNERING UH WITH US
SO WE MUST UH WE MUST BRING IT AS IF UH REAL REACTION IS UH IS BIG COMPANY UH A TRUSTFUL COMPANY AND UH IT HAS M
WHEN YOU UH PUT ON REMOTE YOU SEE A KIND OF A JUST LIKE WHEN YOU TELEPHONE YOU SEE A LITTLE UH ANIMATION
BUT W TH THE IDEA FROM THIS UH THING IS THAT WE MUST PRESENT IT AS A AS WE ARE A A SINGLE LARGE PROVIDER WHO WILL STAND ON OUR OWN
N UH NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES
UH IDEA THAT YOU UH THE THE INDUSTRIAL UH DEVELOPMENT UH CENTRE AND UH USER INTERFACE UH WILL WORK TOGETHER ON A PROTOTYPE
AND UH WILL DRAWING IT ON THE SMARTBOARD
AND UM THE MARKETING EXPERT WILL UH WILL UH KE HE WILL BE KEEPING BUSY WITH THE PRODUCT UH EVALUATION
SEE YOU IN A HALF HOUR
HI
HA
AND UH I JUST UH WATCH WHAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE AND I CHECKED UH WELL WHAT WHAT D DO WE WANT
AND HOW CAN WE UH D AIM A AT UH THE TARGET GROUP
YE AH IT'S IT'S OKAY
UH THEY WELL THEY LIKE MORE THE THEY LIKE THE TRADITIONAL MATERIALS LIKE WOOD AND AND SUCH MORE
UH SO W WELL UH FIRS YES
NO I'LL I'LL GET TO THAT
YOU YOU'LL SEE
WELL WE COULD ALSO USE A BATTERY THAT'S A BIT
AND THEN THEN IT D THEN IT HAS SOME MORE UH ENERGY
BUT UH THE THING IS ABOUT SOLAR PANEL IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE L UH LIGHT
UH FOR UH ULTIMATE B UH N UH USE OF UH SOLAR PANELS YOU COULD ACTUALLY USE UH YOU COULD USE UH SOLAR PANELS
SO UH SO I I IT IT WO WHAT'S ACTUALLY I I C JUST IN F I'VE FIGURED IT OUT THAT WELL
UH SEEING THAT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE UH WITHIN THE L UH DISTANCE OF T. V. AND THE FROM T. V. THERE COMES A A A WHOLE BUNCH OF LIGHT
NO BUT UH D WELL YOU PICK IT UP AND YOU PRESS BUTTONS AND Y WELL YOU
YEAH WELL UH ACTUALLY IT IS
AND IT IT IF IT ISN'T YOU JUST SHAKE IT A BIT AND AND ADD ADD WITH POWER UP AGAIN
BUT WHAT L WHAT JAREK SAID YOU COULD YOU COULD USE A BATTERY THAT YOU'D JUST KEEP IT ON THE RECHARGING WHENEVER IT MOVES
AND SO THAT UH UH WELL F FURTHERMORE YOU YOU WE UH CHECKED UH THE CASES
YOU HA I YOU SIM UH YOU SIMPLY ADD A BASIC UH STANDARD UH MODEL UH IT WAS KIND OF SQUARE AND UH I FIGURED THAT'S A BIT BORING
OR BUT BUT YOU COULD GO IN A IN AN DOUBLE CURVES
THAT GIVES YOU AN WHOLE NEW UH EFFEC
YEAH THAT GIVES YOU A YOUNGER AND UH MORE HIGH TECH LOOK I F I FIGURED
UH YEAH I CA I CA I COULD I COULD SHOW YOU
WELL UH LET'S SAY Y UH YOU UH
SO Y YOU YOU JUST
YEAH THIS IS A THIS BIT UH DIFFICULTY IN I DIDN'T TAKE A MAJOR IN ART
YEAH YOU COULD Y IT LEAVES MORE SPACE FOR CREATIVITY
YEAH YEAH I MEAN UH PLASTIC UH IS PLASTIC ALSO HAS THAT CHEAP FEELING TO IT
UH THAT'S MAYBE JUST ME BUT UH WE COULD UH
UH OH TALK ABOUT IT LATER
AND UH CHIP SET WELL UH IF WE ARE GOING TO USE TRADITIONAL BUTTONS WE COULD GO UH WITH A SIMPLE CHIP SET
BUT UH IF WE DECIDE TO GO ON A N UH UM L. C. D. SCREEN WE WOULD USE AN UH WE HAVE TO USE AN A ADVANCED CHIP SET
IF IT ISN'T UH MANAGEABLE UH BUDGET WISE WE'D HAVE TO GO OVER TO UH TO SIM TO SIMPLE BUTTONS
YEAH YOU YOU YOU SHOULD WE SHOULD A COMBINATION
YEAH I CON EXACTLY
UH WELL THAT WOULD BRING THE M M SOME MORE COSTS BUT I MEAN THE
UH I FIGURED IT WILL BE M RATHER THAN HARD NAH RUBBER C UH THIS IS A CASING YEAH
RUBBER CASING BECAUSE WELL IF YOU USE AN UH D A TOUCH SCREEN UH IT'S JUST A CASING UH AROUND IT
WELL M I DON'T KNOW
YEAH YOU TOO
YOU YOU YOU SEEMED TO HESITATE A BIT
THAT THAT THAT THAT'S GONNA THE THE CHIP SET WILL HOLD IT FIRM IN PLACE AND UH AND AND UH AND A L. C. D. SCREEN ALSO
UH YOU'RE WELCOME
WELL I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE UM FOR THAT TO HAPPEN YOU D YOU WILL HAVE TO RECEIVE A SIGNAL FROM THE UH REMOTE CONTROL
WHAT M WHAT MAY BE BETTER IS TO INCORPORATE AN UH A SEPARATE DEVICE THAT UH THAT YOU CAN PROGRAM WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO THERE'S N THAT'S THERE'S UH BESIDES UH THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU'LL HAVE A SEPARATE UH
AND THOSE PEOPLE WOULDN'T UH NECESSARY WANT IT
I I FIGURE IF YOU HAD TWO DIFFERENT REMOTES YOU COULD BO CHOOSE ONE WITH UH WELL UH UH A RECEIVER IN IT
SO A AND THAT THAT WAY UH YOU COULD MAKE CHEAP MODEL AND A EXPENSIVE MODEL
BUT YOU STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM ABOUT UH THE TELEVISION ITSELF
YOU COULD JUST BLAME IT ON TELEVISION AND UH MAKE IT THEIR PROBLEM
YEAH WHICH BUTTONS DO YOU WANT TO IN IT
YEAH YOU COULD YOU COULD M HAVE PEOPLE WANT UH WANT THAT
AH YEAH SURE
WELL THANK YOU TOO
M AYE
AND UH S S S SO I HAD A LITTLE LESS TIME TO COMPLETE
NO A LITTLE PROBLEM UH BIG PROBLEM
OH HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE OPTION OF USING A SOLAR PANEL
BUY A FIFTY CENTS BATTERY AND UH
UH IS IT POSSIBLE UH OF IS IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A TOUCH SCREEN SQUARE
WELL AS LONG A AS LONG AS IT'S IT'S UH IT'S FIRM
AND YOU DON'T UH IT'S NOT BENDABLE OR SOMETHING I TH I THINK THAT GOES TOO FAR
IT MIGHT EVEN BOUNCE BACK WHEN YOU DROP IT ON THE FLOOR
AH
OOH
IN
WELL THAT'S A JUST SIMPLE POWERPOINT MOCK UP I WANT TO M MAKE IT MORE AS DYNAMIC FOR YOU SO I'LL DRAW THERE
UM ALWAYS DISPLAY THE PRIMARY BUTTONS CLEAR AND VISIBLE
SO IF YOU PRESS UM SYSTEM THAT'S YEAH WELL M MULTIPLE SYSTEM OPTIONS CAN MAYBE FIVE OR TEN OR OR ONE CAN FIT IN
OR MAYBE EVEN A STEP FURTHER WHEN YOU WANT TO UM
T UM HAVE SOME OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE NOT PROGRAMMABLE WITH ONE HORIZONTAL BUTTON
AND UM WELL HOW DO UH DO WE WANT TO LOOK AT UH UH F UM YEAH DOES A REMOTE LOOK WELL
SO YOU CAN MAKE IT S A LITTLE BROADER
ON THE ON THE MAIN BUTTONS
ON THE MENU STRUCTURE
UM I ADDED THIS COULD BE ONE UH BIG L. C. D.
ONE THING YOU'VE GOTTA KEEP IN MIND KEEP THE REMOTE CLEAR OF TOO MUCH FUNCTIONS AT THE SAME TIME
JUST KEEP IT AS SIMPLE AS UH AS POSSIBLE
AND DO NOT USE TOO MANY LEVELS
DO NOT HAVE TO SELECT A SCREEN FIRST AND THEN BRIGHTNESS AND THEN COLOUR AND UN PLUS AND UM PUSH PLUS TWENTY TIMES
BUT JUST THE UM UH JUST IN ONE BUTTON IF POSSIBLE
AND WHEN YOU GET TO N TO UH TO TEN YE AND WANT TO GO BACK UH WELL YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
JUST M MOST MOST MODERN T. V. S YOU YOU PRESS ONE ZERO AND IT GOES TO TEN
AND ELSE TO ONE AND THROUGH AFTER THAT
SO THE S A BUTTON LESS
YEAH YEAH W YEAH I I FIND I MUST TRYING TO UH TELL IT
IS UH VOLUME PLUS AND MINUS
AND THIS IS PROGRAM UH PLUS
UH
OR IF YOU'RE WATCHING STUDIO SPORTS ON UH ON SEVENTEEN AND YOUR WIFE IS WATCHING SOME SOAP ON TWO WELL YES I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY SWITCHING BETWEEN TWO CHANNELS YOU WON'T HAVE TIME UH TO D USE THE OTHER OPTIONS
UM W WELL YEAH
YOU DON'T WANT TO TO GO DOWN AND WATCH THE NEWS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND TURN IT ON AND WAIT TWENTY SECONDS FOR FOR UH THE LOG ON SCREEN AND THEN REMEMBER YOUR CODE AND ALL KINDS OF SETTINGS
YOU C MAY USE LIKE WHEN THERE'S UH X. P. UH A SIMPLE LOG ON D YOU JUST PUSH UH ONE OR TWO OR THREE
TO LOG IN
AND IF YOU PUTS A YE
JUST MAKE THROUGH A REMOTE AS IT IS BUT MAKE AN OPTION TO INSERT PROFILES
'CAUSE IF MY GRANDAD WOULD BUY THIS REMOTE HE WOULDN'T WANT TO BOTHER WITH ALL ALL THE ALL THE UH THINGS TO DO
UM B WELL STILL SOME QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT HOW TO INCORPORATE THOSE ONES
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SOME CHANNELS THEY UH CANNOT SEE BUT WELL I I WHEN I THINK OH YEAH FOR THE F FOR ALL THE STANDARD CHANNELS
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WATCHING UH I DON'T KNOW YOU'RE IN THE AT DAY UH CARTOONS WILL COME UP M ON MAYBE FRIDAY NIGHT
YEAH THE DISADVANTAGE VANTAGE IS THAT SOMEONE WILL HAS TO SEND ALL THE SHOW VIEW NUMBERS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY REMOTES AND EDIT IT ALL
WILL HAVE TO DECIDE UH
YEAH ON A SEPARATE MENU UH OPTION
A MAIL TOO FROM MANAGEMENT THAT IT'S VERY POPULAR TO USE VOICE RECON RECOGNITION
BUT I DON'T THINK WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. UH HEARING LOUD NOISES FROM THE T. V. SOMEONE SCREAMING ONE AND YOU F THE CHANNEL SWITCHES UH YEAH
IS T SOME MENU UH FUNCTION YOU CHOOSE PARENTAL CONTROL AND MAYBE FOUR FILES WILL EMERGE FROM MENU WHERE PUT IT ON
BUT UH HOW HOW IT'S GONNA WORK UH UH WILL F BE A PROBLEM
YE I I THINK BEST WOULD BE UH TO PUT IT IN AND MAKE IT AN MENU OPTION
YOU CAN PUT ON YEAH
AND YOU CAN JUST UH S WHEN YOU BUY IT YOU CAN SELECT UM PERSONAL PREFERENCE PARENTAL CONTROL ON AND THE PASSWORD OR SOMETHING
OH IT'S A P YEAH
WELL MAYBE YOU JUST HAVE TO RESTRICT IT TO WHAT PROGRAMS WHERE THE PARENT SAYS YOU CANNOT WATCH CHANNEL SEVEN
AND THERE'S JUST SOME LITTLE UH CLOCK IN THE REMOTE
THERE UH TH I H I'VE SEEN SOME OF REMOTES WHO HAVE A CLOCK IN IT
AND WHEN YOU PUSH UH SYSTEM PROPERTIES UH ENTIRE LIST POPS UP WITH E EV ALL KIND OF F STUFF YOU CAN PROGRAM
SOM SOME BENCH MARKER
WELL YOU CAN SHOW SOMEBODY A LOGO FOR POINT FIVE SECONDS THEY'LL STILL REMEMBER IT
AND IT IT L LINGER ON EVERY TIME YOU SEE IT
OH FOR THE NEXT MEETING RIGHT
AH NO NEW EMAIL
SEE YOU
IF YOU GOT A NO
HA HA
MASTER
MASTER OF
AND WHEN THE BATTERY DOESN'T WORK I USUALLY SHAKE IT TOO
UH
SO UH I BET A BIG COMPANY IN UH KOREA OR TAIWAN LIKE UH SAMSUNG CAN GIVE US UH A BIG DISCOUNT ON THE CHIPS SO
U USUALLY CHIPS ARE UH AREN'T MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ONE DOLLAR
LIKE AN UH AKU UH
ACU UH YEAH
I WENT TO UH PARIS AND MILAN FOR SOME TREND WATCHING
OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND I WENT TO PARIS AND MILAN
IN PARIS AND MILAN WE UH ASKED DIFFERENT PEOPLE UH DIFFERING IN AGE AND IN INCOME
I THINK HE DID SOME UH
YOU WER YOU WEREN'T IN PARIS
UH
NO N J JUST J JUST A W
NO OKAY BUT JUST JUST A WOODEN UH LOOK
THE THAT ISN'T WOOD ANYWAY BUT OKAY
UH THERE'RE SOME OVERALL THOUGHTS ABOUT NEW REMOTE CONTROLS
WE HAVE TO AIM AT A MU AT THE MAIN AUDIENCE
HERE THINK ABOUT REMOVABLE COVERS AS SEEN IN MOBILE TELEPHON TELEPHONE MARKET
LIKE THE NOKIA UH THE REMOVABLE COVERS UH JUST PUT A RED ON IT AND GO TO THE SHOP AND BUY A GREEN ONE
UH A THIRD MATERIAL BEING USED UH COULD WELL BE STUFF LIKE RUBBER
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP THE COST IN UH IN MIND BUT IT
UH
BUT YOU DON'T USE GAMES WHEN YOU'RE D WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A TELEPHONE CALL
UH NO
YOU AL YOU ALSO TAKE UH T YOU TAKE YOUR IPAC AND GO UH PLAY GAMES
AND THIRD I STICK WITH IT THE LOG IN FUNCTIONALITY UH WITH THE SLOGAN TAKE PARENTAL CONTROL TO A NEW DIMENSION
L LIKE IN UH INTERNET EXPLORER
YEAH OKAY BUT DOES IT THAT IS FOR UH GOING FROM FOUR TO FIVE
BUT IF YOU GO FROM TWO TO EIGHT AND YOU WANT
YEAH AND ON TWO
WHAT I SEE UH HOW I SEE IT IS YOU PUT IT ON THE THE REMOTE AND THEN YOU HAVE LIKE A WINDOWS LOG ON SCREEN WITH PARENTS CHILDREN
PU PUSH PARENTS
THAT THEN THEN THEN YOU HAVE TO UH GO TO THREE DIGIT UH LOG IN
LIKE TWO ONE THREE
AND IT'S IN
V VIOLENT T. V.
ONE UH W WITH PARENT CONTROL AND ONE WITHOUT AND I WOULD WOULD BUY THE ONE WITH
UH CHILDREN CAN STILL GO UP TO THE T. V. P POP OPEN UH THE THING AND AND AND G
AH IT'S YEAH
YEAH LIKE F VOICE RECOGNITION IS TOO MUCH I THINK
THAT THAT DOESN'T C THAT DOESN'T CO
YEAH IT'S IT'S IN IT
BUT TOO MA I I THINK SO BUT
BUT ON THE T. V.
AT LEAST MY T. V. IS A IS A COMPARTMENT WHICH YOU CAN PRESS
AND THERE ARE BUTTONS UH BEHIND IT WHICH YOU CAN USE IF YOU D IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T HAVE A
AH I HAVE TO UH CONSULT MY LEGAL ADVISOR ABOUT IT
LIKE AT IN THE EXPERTS VIEW YOU HAVE A LOT OF MORE BUTTONS
YEAH WH WHICH BUTTONS YOU LIKE OR NOT
R. TH R. TO THE THIRD POWER
YEAH OKAY BUT IT HAS TO BE LIKE A SPLIT SECOND BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUT IN A CODE ALSO AND
WHO UH
WHO WHO GAVE YOU THE MASTER CLASS
AH
ME TOO
SO UM NO PRESENTATION FOR ME
EVAL EVAL EVALU EVALUATION S SORRY
UH IN COMBINATION WITH THE FINANCE I UM UH I RECEIVED UH A AN UH AN EXCEL UH FILE
UH AND THEN WE MUST SEE UH IF WE UH STAY UNDER THE TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
SO THAT'S UH THAT'S A BIG L SO LET'S UH WAIT IT UH UM WE HAVE WE HAVE MUST UH
I WOULD G GIVE THE WORD TO UM G. AND G. FOR THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION
YEAH BUT UH YOU D YOU MUSTN'T FORGET THAT UH OUR TARGET AIM IS YOUNGER PEOPLE
UH WE HAD DECIDED TO UH PUT UH SOME FLASHY FRUITY COLOURS IN IT
UH AND UH IN THE SURVEY FROM UH MILAN AND PARIS UH IT UH IT CAME OUT THAT UH UH THE D THE OLDER PEOPLE ARE UH MORE WILLING TO UH TO SPEND MONEY ON EXTRA FEATURES
AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO UH REALLY WANT UH A MORE SOPHISTICATED MORE TRADITIONAL LOOK THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY UH THAT
THEY WANT UH THEY WANT MORE LUXURY STUFF BUT THEY HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT AND THEY WANT TO B TO BUY THAT
SO MAYBE IT'S AN IDEA TO PUT THAT AS AN EXTRA AND NOT AS A STANDARD
BUT THE MAI I THINK TH UH THE STANDARD MUST BE SOME KIND OF UH UH ATTRACTIVE FLASHY COLOURS
NOT TOO BUT W A LITTLE BECAUSE THAT'S OUR AIM
YEAH ONE I THINK
YEAH BIG AND CLEAR
I WAS THINKING VERY BLACK AND WHITE
FRUITY
SO IF IT'S IN THE DARK PLACE YOU STILL SEE IT GLOWING
I THINK AH YOU MUST SEE IT AS
UH W UH ACCORDING TO UH THE THE OTHER UH REMOTE CONTROLS
ONE
YEAH CAN IT BE ZERO
OKAY WE HAVE NOW TO C UH TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCTION COST
IF IT'S UNDER UH TWELVE AND HALF EURO THEN IT'S UH OK UH OKAY
BUT I IS IT IF IT IS B HUH
YEAH IF THE COSTS ARE UNDER TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
UH THEN WE UH CAN UH RA UH MOVE ON TO THE PROJECT EVALUATION AS WE HAVE UH EXPERIENCED IT
OTHERWISE WE HAVE UH DO UH HAVE TO DO A LITTLE UH REDESIGN UH THINGY
WE HAVE TO UH FIL UH WANT TO UH DO IT IN AND UH SEE UH IF WE STAY UNDER THE TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
NO ADVANCED CHIP
THREE
YEAH UH BUT IT IT'S ONE ONE THING IT'S THREE EURO
BUT IS IT S IT'S NOT MADE FROM A SINGLE UNCURVED THINGY AND THEN UH AND THEN UH NO
YEAH ONE
BUT YEAH IT'S IT'S IT
OKAY THE PUSH BUTTON NO
SCROLL WHEEL NO
UH BUTTON NO
NO THE THE WE DON'T HAVE A S NO
YO
UH B BUT I BUT THE SINGLE CURVED IS JUST OH
SO THAT'S WH THA THAT'S ONE OPTION
AND THEN W YEAH AND THEN WE COULD HAVE IT
NO THO UH THAT THAT CAN BE DONE
SO IF WE DO THIS UH WE'RE ON UH TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
YEAH SINGLE CURVED BUT THERE'S A CURVE IN IT
WHO BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO GO TO KINETIC YOU'RE UH YOU'RE ON THIRTEEN AND A HALF AND YOU MUST GO TO FLAT
AND IF YOU MAKE THE SINGLE CURVE HA JUST A BIG CURVE
WOOD IS M IS IS IS CHEAPER THAN RUBBER
WERE THERE UH ROOM FOR UH WAS THERE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY IN OUR MEETINGS OR IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS
I NOTICE IT TOO
ABOUT THE FIRST MEETING
YEAH AND IT'S WO MORE LIKE PRESENTATION AND SOME POINTS WERE DISCUSSED
M YEAH
AND IT IS STILL YOUR OWN HANDWRITING UH POPPING UP IN UH WORD
BE IT IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO DRAW THINGS AND TO WRITE THINGS AND THAT'S THE
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT TH THE THE YOU WHEN YOU AT A FOREIGN AUDIENCE YOU B DON'T GONNA WR UH WRITE UH SMALL
BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOME FUNCTION WITH NO IT ISN'T
ALL THE MO YEAH ARE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO
BUT THE NEW IDEAS FOUND FOR UH WI WITH WORKING WITH THIS UH SOFTWARE
YOU HAD EXPECTED IT TO TO BE UH MORE MORE UH
IS IT
SO YOU HAVE AS YOU SAW YOU HAVE A LITTLE UH
OH YOU CAN
TO USE
AND WE ARE NOW WITH FOUR PEOPLE BUT IT WELL IMAGINE YOU ARE HERE YOU'RE WITH THE TEN PEOPLE AND EVERYONE UH
YOU MIGHT THINKING WHAT THE HELL WAS HE DOING UH
UH ABOUT ALL THE MEETINGS WHAT WE HAVE DECIDED A R R A REPORT OF THIS DAY
UH THAT MUST BE MADE BUT I DON'T KNOW HERE IS UH STANDING UH WHOA WE CAN CELEBRATE NOW BUT THE END REPORT IS
SO I I S I WILL UH PUT IT ON A STORY BOARD
YOU CAN SEE IT
NO NO NO I'M JUST UH YOU CAN S YOU CAN READ IT AND UH HERE HERE IT IS
WELL THIS NOT NIT IT READ ONLY
I'M UH WHEN I SAID IT I REMEMBER I HAD IT HERE
ABOUT THE THREE FUNCTIONS WHERE UH WHICH ARE MOST USED AND UH WHICH MUST UH IMMEDIATELY BE VISIBLE ON OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL
UM IT MUST BE UH SIMPLE TO USE VERY CLEAR WHAT TO DO AND AT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE
SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WH UH WHAT KIND THINGS UH MUST BE IN IT AND UH YEAH
OKA OKAY OKAY I
I REALLY DIDN'T KNEW THAT
WELL MAYBE I CAN THEN DO IT ONE TWO THREE
IF THE ORDER IS IN UH IS IS UH IMPORTANT THAT'S THE WORD FOR
UH
UH WELL ALL THE THINGS WE HAVE UH DISCUSSED UH THE ENERGY WHICH UH TURN OUT TO BE UH BATTERIES SO THAT'S
UH HE HERE IT IS STILL DOUBLE CURVE THE RUBBER THE FLASHY THE FRUITY THE REMOVABLE
NAY BUT THAT THIS IS WHAT UM
UH IT'S VERY CHEAP YOU YOU MAYBE YOU YOU YOU YOU COME AT UH
WHAT'S IT WHAT'S THE COMPANY CALLED
OKAY SO UH ANYBODY UH MISSES SOMETHING HERE ABOUT UH
YEAH OKAY WELL I GONNA REDESIGN UH SOMETHING NOW
BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL OH FIVE MINUTES FROM TO FINISH MEETING
THAT'S GONNA BE T PROBLEM
HI
YEAH UH WELL AND AS YOU SAW WE WOULD JUST HAVE THE BASIC REMOTE WITH THE PANEL L. C. D. UH SCREEN
WELL THESE WOULD BE THE MAIN BUTTONS H YOU COULD UH CHANGE THEM LATER ON IN YOUR OWN PROFILE IF YOU WANT TO
WE MADE A TOP OH OR A FRONT VIEW
JUST SO LIKE YOU WANNA UH BACK VIEW
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS UH THERE THERE ARE UH TWO UH WEIRD BUMPS IN IT
WELL WHAT WE FIGURED IS UH WE'LL SHOW YOU A PICTURE LATER ON YOU HAVE MORE B A BETTER IDEA AFTER THAT
BUT IDEA IS FOR TO STAY IN BALANCE WITH THESE TWO UH WITH THESE TWO
AND SO WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE TABLE IT WILL JUST LAY DOWN
BUT IT WILL LIE MORE IN YOUR HAND LIKE AN OLD TELEPHONE MAYBE OR LIKE THESE OLD UH PHONES
Y YOU YOU MAY GET THE IDEA
SO THI THIS IS ABOUT UH HOW WE FIGURED IT SHOULD BE
THE S PANEL WE G YOU WOULD HIDE WITH SOME MORE UH RUBBER LAYERS LIKE WE DISCUSSED EARLY ON
UH YOU WOULD S YOU WOULDN'T SEE THE UH STRAIGHT PANEL BUT MORE FLUIDLY AND ROUND
YEAH F UH AS COLOURS DO YOU DO YOU HAVE THE PICTURE IN UH
NOW WELL THIS IS THE IDEA ABOUT UH THE BUMPS
IT UH YOU JUST WANT TO HOLD IT YOU UH YOU ARE YOUNG AND UH DYNAMIC LIKE US
UH BUT SO THIS ACTUALLY BASIC THE IDEA
AND AND FOR COLOURS WE WE FIGURED STARTING WITH BASIC COLOURS LIKE UH WHITE OR METALLIC GREY
THOSE ARE THE TECHNOLOGICAL COLOURS ACTUALLY SO IT D
YEAH LI LIKE LIKE THIS LIKE THIS
THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T TOO MUCH IS IT
I F
UH OH
I HAVE I'VE YEAH TWO OR THREE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST UH THE QU QUESTION IS AIMED AT IS IT DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH AGE BELOW FORTY
YEAH THE THEY ARE BIG AND CLEAR
YEAH YOU CAN CH THAT'S IN A MENU
YEAH IT HAS THESE ALL THESE FRUITY COLOURS AND IT HAS A STRANGE SHAPE
SO IF YOU SO IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE FINDING IT
WELL THEN UH THEN I'LL GO FOR FOUR
BECAUSE UH FOUR IS BETWEEN THREE AND UH UH ALSO BETWEEN BETWEEN TRUE AND FALSE
SO I'LL I'LL GO FOR FOUR
WHA
WELL IF I IF YOU SEE A STRANGE SHAPE LYING SOMEWHERE UH THEN YOU'D UH RECOGNISE IT AS WHOA THAT IS STRANGE
UH
YEAH HE MADE IT
ME TOO
UH N NO
UH WE HAVE ONE
WE HAVE ONE
WELL THAT'S UM YEAH SPEECH RECOGNITION AND S
THAT'S AN ADD ON
WELL WE'RE ONLY FOUR EURO OVER BUDGET
WELL OTHER CASE WE CAN MAKE IT SINGLE CURVED OR UNCURVED
OKAY WELL YOU YOU CAN GO FROM DOUBLE CURVED TO SINGLE CURVED
R IF YOU UH PROMOTE A KINETIC UM I KINETIC REMOTE CONTROL I MEAN THAT WOULD B SELL BETTER THAN AN A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL
NO WELL Y I MEAN UH Y YOU CAN GO INTO YOUR NEIGHBOUR AND TELL HIM HA MY K UH REMOTE CONTROL IS KINETIC
YOU D YOU YOU BOTH HAD UH THE LESS CREATIVE UH ROLES IN THE PROJECT
'CAUSE I THINK M
I THINK JEROEN AND I WE HAD A MORE DESIGN WE COULD HAVE MORE WE HAD MORE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY THAN THAN YOU TWO
HA
NAH THE LEADERSHIP WASN'T CRAPPY IT WAS THE LEADER THAT WAS CRAPPY
NO THE LEADERSHIP WAS OKAY
YEAH BUT US
NO I HAVE IT WORKING
NO IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH ADDED VALUE TO THE
JUST T T TYPE TEXT AND THAT THAT WOULD BE UH EXCELLENT
MEAN
BUT UH PROBLEM IS WELL YOU CAN'T DISCUSS ANYTHING WELL YOU YOU CA UH YOU CAN
WE I MEAN UH W W W ONE ONE PERSON S MAYBE SAID THREE
BUT IF YOU YOU PUT A THREE ON IT UH JUST FIGURE WELL EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT I'M KNOWING SO THEY'LL ALL JUST PUT A TWO ON
BUT THEN UH I THINK THE IDEA OF ONE PERSON ENTERING IT AND THE REST UH DISCUSSING IT THAT UH ISN'T THAT BAD IDEA ACTUALLY
ON THING UH
UH WAS IT INCLUDED IN THE COST
I DON'T THINK SO EH
YO
AND UM WELL WE BEGAN WITH UH WITH A FORM OF SHAPE
IDEA MAYBE UH IS BETTER
AND IT HAS TO BE ACCE ACCESSIBLE WITH YOUR UH OTHER HAND TOO OF COURSE
OH WE ADDED THAT THIS UM CAN BE HELD WITH YOUR HANDS FOR THIS MAXIMUM IS OM YEAH ONE AND A HALF CENTIMETRES
S AND YOU CAN JUST BE THE THE LAYER OF THE TOUCHSCREEN AND SOME HAVE SOME WIRES UNDERNEATH IT TO MAKE IT AS UH THIN AS POSSIBLE IN THE MIDDLE FOR GOOD GRIP
BUT WHEN THE O OLDER PEOPLE UH GO IN THE SHOP AND THEY SEE UH AN ORANGE UM REMOTE CONTROL IT WOULD BE LESS APPEALING THAN A WHITE ONE
AND YOUNG PEOPLE WE THINK ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE THEY THINK AH I'LL BUY FOR A COUPLE OF EUROS SOME NOI NICE HIP UH
WELL YEAH A COLOUR OF A WOOD STYLE A WHITE C AND UH A COUPLE OF H HIP UH FRUITY COLOURS
AND LEA UH L DELIVERED STANDARD WITH A FRUITY COLOUR BUT NOT TOO NOT TOO MUCH
AH
NO NO A LITTLE MORE IN THE MIDDLE
NO UH THREE OR YEAH
YEAH YEAH OH THEY HAVE TO AGREE BUT
YEAH YEAH BIG AND CLEAR
UH
WE HAVE THE BETTER RE I DON'T KNOW
UH
K YEAH
FO FO YEAH FO FIVE IS
UH
UM I WOULD CALL UH CHOOSE TWO 'CAUSE WE DECIDED NOT TO MAKE TWO F UH FRESH COLOURS AS IT WOULD NOT
BUT THEN YOU'RE L YEAH BUT THEN YOU'LL LOSE FUNCTION F YEAH FUNCTIONALITY AND OUR FANCY UH LOOK SO
IT IS R IT IS RATHER EASY TO USE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE PRIMARY BUTTONS ALWAYS VISIBLE
YEAH M MINE TOO
TH DID YOU MAKE THIS OR THE
IT CHANGES IT MAYBE
CAU 'CAUSE SO IT'S OKAY
ONE
ONE YEAH
NO THE ADVANCED CHIP IS UH
YEAH YOU GIVE IT A SAMPLE UH ONE
YOU NO
COULD YOU STEP A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT MA YEAH
UH J MAYBE WE'LL FINISH UH THE THE LIST FIRST AND THEN LOOK BACK AYE
SCROLL WHEEL NO
ONE YEAH
MM IS IT NO
BUT YOU CAN USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES ANYWAY JUST YOU S YOU HAVE TO RECHARGE THEM MANUAL
AH
YEAH SO WE HAVE TO BAKE THE BA BACK FLAT AND THEN
OR ARE THESE TWO CURVES
UH
NO ADVANCED CHIP UH THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF PROBLEM
W
COULD WE JUST MAKE THE BUBBLES UH CUT OFF THE BACK AND THEN WE'RE UH HAS
YOU MA CAN MAKE AN AN ESPECIALISED EXTRA GOLD VERSION
WE SUE
WE YEAH WE'LL START HER ALL O ALL OVER AGAIN
FOR US THERE WAS A LOT OF CREATIVITY
WE COULD JUST SIGN UP AN UH REMOTE IF WE LIKED
UH
CRA
YOU COULD OF SAID SHUT UP YOU FOOL
D UH JUST WRITE YOUR NAME RIGHT NOW
JUST JUST WRITE YOUR NAME IN IN ONE LINE
Y WELL YEAH
TH THE I
NEE
AS UH AS I SAID A M A C FEW MOMENTS AGO IT I WOULD LIKE MYSELF TO WRITE WITH A NORMAL PEN BECAUSE MUST UM
YEAH IT'S ALMOST THE SAME CONCEPT BUT YOU CAN JUST SIM MORE SIMPLY PUT IT ON OUR SCANNER
I IT'S THE SAME CONCEPT AS THE PEN WHERE YOU F HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE OR S UH VERY UH SLOW
NO AND IT DOESN'T GIVE ANY ADDED VALUE
WE'RE TRYING TO M TO
NO A AS YOU SAW ON ON THIS DRAWING JUST OPEN OPEN THIS ONE OR THAT ONE
IT'S UH TH IT IT YEAH UH WE HAD MORE PROBLEMS EVEN HERE WHEN WE TRYING TO DRAW THESE BUTTONS
IT W T IS IS THIS LARGE
AND WHEN YOU TRY TO ERASE THIS LINE Y
M ABO WHAT KIND OF NEW IDEAS
NEW IDEAS ABOUT UH THE WORKING OF THIS SOFTWARE ABOUT ABOUT THE PROJECT ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROLS OR
OR AT LEAST WHEN YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO ADAPT TO THE TECHNOLOGY JUST YOU CAN WRITE IN THE WAY YOU NORMALLY WRITE
IF YOU HAVE UH SOME PRESENTATION AND YOU HAVE SOME F
THERE'S ONE WAY TO UH
TO USE YEAH
AND THAT'S M
THAT'S MOSTLY THE CASE FROM THE OVER HERE WITH THE MANAGEMENTS YOU GET TWO MINUTES TO MAKE YOUR CASE AND IF YOU HAVE TO DO ALL THIS KIND
YOU'LL RATHER USE POWERPOINT AND WORK IT OUT IN ADVANCE
AND TH THE ONE OR TWO THINGS YOU HAVE TO DRAW WHEN YOU'RE THERE JUST USE A FLIP BOARD
WHEN ARE W
UH
WELL OKAY MAYBE YOU CAN ADD IT LATER THAT WE DECIDED IN THE END BECAUSE OF THE COST
AH IT'S VERY CHEAP
HE'LL DO IT IN HIS FREE TIME
ON THE BOTTOM
OKAY THIS N YEAH
OH BEFORE YOU CHANGE ANYTHING MAYBE YOU UM SAVE IT FIRST
YOU CAN'T YOU CAN SELECT FILE AND EXPORT AND THEN THOSE J. PEG FILES
DON'T SAVE IT AYE
UH
AH OKAY
JANE AND JANE
WAIT WHAT I W GOT IN MIND
MAYBE IT'S AN IDEA TO SELL IT WITHOUT A COVER SO THAT YOU CAN PICK A COVER IN THE IN THE SHOP
AN ANOTHER IDEA
NOT NOT TOO UH YEAH
TO THE PAST REQUIREMENTS
ONE OH OKAY UH I HAVE TO EXPLA EXPLAIN SOMETHING
UH
UH
WE YEAH
YEAH SO SO A O ONE IS APPROPRIATE
THREE
AH EXACTLY
THREE
YEAH ACCO ACCORDING TO US IT'S ONE
YEAH P S
OF C OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO BE UH VERY POSITIVE AND UH ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT YOUR OWN PRODUCT
THREE
ONE
BIG AND CLEAR
J
A LI LITTLE BIT MAYBE
FI
AH I I I THINK FIVE
LIKE NO NOT UH NOT SEEING IT BUT LOST IT IN THE HOUSE OR SOMETHING
THREE
ON T
YEAH OKAY BUT EASY N NOT NOT THE MOST EASY TO USE I THINK
WE ALSO HAVE TO COMPARE IT TO THE UH
TO THE REMOTE CONTROLS ON THE MARKET NOWADAYS
YES I DO
SAVE AS
ADVANCED CHIP IS THREE
YES THREE
S
YEAH BUT BUT D BUT DANIEL THA THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER BRAND
A DOCKING STATION JUST APART FROM THE FROM THE THING SO THAT YOU CAN UH PUT UH
HEY THOSE AR ARCS WHY ARE THERE FOR
BUT WHA 'KAY LOOK WHAT IS THE UH IF YOU MAKE IT DOUBLE CURVED IT COSTS ONE EURO MORE
I DON'T KNOW IF TWELVE AND A HALF IS UH A FIXED UH FIXED PRICE
WHAT A WHAT ABOUT ALL THE M THE ENVIRONMENT FREAKS
IT LOOK LIKE THIS ONE
AH NO WE HAVE TO DO ALL THOSE HOURS AGAIN
ONE BACK
BUT THAT'S MAINLY BECAUSE UH OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS DELIVERED TO US
IT WAS JUST FIXED INFORMATION AND GET YOUR STUFF FROM THERE AND I COULDN'T GO ON ON I ON THE INTERNET AND SEARCH MY OWN STUFF
UH YOU COULD HAVE BUT UH IT WAS YOUR FIRST NO UH NO DISRESPECT OR SOMETHING
BUT YOU COULD HAVE UH STRUCTURE IT A L LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT ME
DIGITAL PEN I THOUGHT UH TH THE FIRST TIME I DID INDIVIDUAL WORK I USED IT
BUT A AND THE FIRST TWO MEETINGS I BROUGHT IT WITH ME BUT I DIDN'T USE IT AT ALL AFTER THE FIRST THE FIRST MEETING
OH I HAVE SOME FIGURE
THE EVA THE EVALUATION THE MM THE MEAN UH NUMBER IS UH ONE POINT EIGHT ONE POINT EIGHT SIX
ALL THE REQUIREMENTS UH ARE TRUE OR VERY TRUE RIGHT
MAY MAYBE THE IDEA YOU PROPOSED IS UH A SCREEN HERE
AH VERY BAD
RE REAL REACTION DOT N. L.
YES IS NOW IS OKAY
WHAT I REALLY MISS ALSO IS UH
IS A D IS A TURTLE IS A DECISION UH DECISION SYSTEM LIKE UM
POLLS LIKE WHAT DO YOU WANT A ONE A TWO
MAYBE A A L A LITTLE APPLICATION LIKE UH UH GIVE YOUR OWN NUMBER AND CLICK ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN
YEAH J JU JU YEAH V VOTING APPLICATION
OH YOU HA YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES LEFT I UH READ
YOU YOU ALREADY MADE A BETA VERSION OR
YOU YEAH
S SWITCH YES
WAS INITIAL THE PLAN
NO IT'S IT'S NOT VERY CHEAP BUT THAT NO BUT IT'S A DEVELOPMENT INSIDE CORPORATION
LIKE UH W WE DON'T HAVE TO BUY PARENTAL CONTROL
EXAMPLE OF CHILDREN REMOTE
SO NOW WE ALL KNOW WHAT OUR
UM I OH FORGET I FORGET THE WHOLE ACQUAINTANCE PART BUT WE WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER
EVERY UH LEVEL OF DESIGN CONSISTS OF SOME INDIVIDUAL WORK AND WE UH CLOSE IT WITH A MEETING
YOU ALL RECEIVED AN EMAIL WITH A EXAMPLE OF OUR EXPLANATION OF WHAT UH THE PARTICULAR LEVEL OF DESIGN UH MEANS TO THE DIFFERENT UH FUNCTIONS
SO YOU GET ACQUAINTED WITH THESE UH UM UH MEETING TOOLS
WE HAVE THE SMART BOARDS UH THE THES THOSE TWO BOARDS
UH WE'RE GONNA SKIP THROUGH TH
JUST ON THE ON THE SCREEN OVER THERE
PROBABLY IS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE SOFTWARE IS ON THE LAPTOP
IS IS IF IT'S MAINLY A THING FOR IN THE MEETING SO I DON'T THINK IT'S I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IMPORTANT
UH WE WELL WE USE THE SAME FILE DURING UH THE WHOLE DAY
BUT IT IS PEN
AND YOU CAN MAKE NEW UH FI UH NEW BLANKS
AND YOU CAN CHANGE UH THE LINE WIDTH AND THE COLOUR OF THE PEN BY PRESSING ON FORWARD WHICH Y YOU HAVE TO SELECT PEN FORMAT
RIGHT WE'RE GONNA TRY OUT THE ELECTRONIC WHITE BOARDS
I'LL USE THIS UH SAME SHEET
OH LET ME THINK
UH
SOME A LITTLE WHITE
OH THIS IS JUST UH
DRAWINGS BUT OH TEETH
WHAT WAS UH I HAVE SU TO SUM UP ITS FAVOURITE CHARACTERIS WELL I LIKE ITS UH SHARP RAZOR SHARP TEETH
WELL THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT UH PIRANHA
YOU GO GUIDO
AND UH SO IN THE FORMAT MENU YOU CAN CHOOSE THE DIFFERENT UH COLOURS AND UH PEN WIDTHS
WELL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT UH YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE UH PARTICULAR BIRDS
N NO NO
I'LL DO SO
UH WELL TELL ME ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH THE REMOTE CONTROLS
UH
BUT UH THE D. V. D. PLAYERS AND HOME CINEMA SETS OFTEN DOUBLE AS STEREO HI FI SETS PROBABLY
OH IT IS ONLY FOR TELEVIS
OKAY UH BUT UH WE'VE GONNA PUT SOME A UH IS IS IT SO USER FRIENDLINESS IS A IS A PRI PRIORITY IN THIS CASE OR
WELL THIS THE MAYBE IS UH SOME ASPECT OF THE UH OR OR SOME POINT AT AT WHICH WE CAN EXCEL BY MAKING IT VERY USEFUL
THAT W WELL THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE THE USABILITY UH MAN SO THIS UH GONNA BE A VERY IMPORTANT TASK FOR YOU THEN
DO UH BY JUST SH SHAPE AND THE LOOK OF IT
OR SOMETH SOMETHING SPECIAL LIKE UH M. P. THREE PLAYER INSIDE OF IT OR UH OH WELL THEN THE PRODUCTION COSTS ARE GONNA BE TOO HIGH PROBABLY
MAYBE WITH DIFFERENT TYPE OF FRONTS OR UH WELL M HAS TO BE SOMETHING SPECTACULAR OR UH ONE WHICH MAKES IT WE GONNA SKIP BACK TO THE GOALS PROBABLY
UH
NO WELL SOMETHING TRENDY AND ORIGINAL WELL THAT THAT GOES HAND IN HAND I GUESS
WHEN SOMETHING IS ORIGINAL IT TENDS TO BE TRENDY PROBABLY OR WE SHOULD MAKE IT COMBINATION OF THAT
'KAY SO YOU THE UM TECHNICAL PART OF THE PROCESS IS SOMETHING YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AFTER FOR
WELL AND YOU UH SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR WHAT MAKES IT TRENDY
WELL YOU KNOW Y LIKE SOME SPECIAL FEATURE
THE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WILL W OR THE WORKING DESIGN OF COURSE WE WILL UH
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER IS IT A USER INTER USER INTERFACE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
USER REQUIREMENTS SPECIFI WELL THIS ONE WAS ALREADY CLEAR TO US
OH NOT MANY I GUESS
OH AND WHAT DOES IT SAID
W
AND UH IT'S IT'S CLEAR YOU CAN PUT THE STUFF IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS PRESENTATIONS
YOU CAN ALL OR WE'RE ALL UH
YEAH BUT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH UH UH MICROSOFT POWERPOINT ARE WE
I'M GONNA WRI UH WRITE SOME STUFF DOWN AND THEN WE'RE READY
OR WE CAN LEAVE ALREADY I GUESS
OR UH OR SH OR SHOULD WE UH OR IS IMPORTANT THAT WE LEAVE AT EXACT UH
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER IN UH THIRTY MINUTES
UH
WHICH IS NOT AS THE CASE WITH UH WITH BINGWINGS AND
YE YES YEAH
VERY GOOD DRAWN BUT YOU CAN SEE A CAT FROM IT
AH IT'S NOT SCARED
JOOST YOUR MOUSE
IS
AND JOOST
CAN WE SEE THE WHITE BOARD ON OUR LAPTOPS
NO I SAW I SAW THE FILE THE SMART BOARD THAT X. B. K. BUT
UH
UH
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY UH FAVOURITE UH ANIMAL IS BUT THE EASIEST ANIMAL I CAN THINK IS IS A BIRD
A RED ONE
THREE
ANO UH UH IT'S A YEAH IT'S UH THE MOST SIMPLE UH ANIMAL I KNOW I THINK
MAYBE BECAUSE UH THERE'S THERE'S SOME S UH FREE UH MAYBE IN THE SKY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
M
ORANGE OF COURSE
UH YEAH
UH
UH I TH I THINK YO WE HAVE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE TO GET A WHOLE MARKET
USE FRIENDLY
OH I DON'T
OH THE PROJECT MANAGER
I DON'T THINK OH
I WILL NEED IT
DANG IT
NO MY LAPTOP
I HAVEN'T GOT A FAVOURITE ANIMAL TOO SO
I CAN'T DRAW SO
OH IT'S BETTER THAN YOUR BIRD
AND THEN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROL WITH WITH DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ON DIFFERENT PLACES AND HALF OF THE FUNCTIONS A ARE REMOVED OR WHATEVER
UH SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS IS A CLEAR UH REMOTE CONTROL WITH
ALL TH ALL THE BUTTONS WHICH APPLY TO THE TEXT FUNCTIONS IN IN ONE UH
WELL ONE AREA OR WHATEVER NOT LIKE THE BUTTON TO ENTER TEXT ON TOP OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE BUTTON TO UM
YEAH TO MINIMISE IT TO THIS THIS OR WHATEVER O O OTHER FUNCTIONS TOTALLY SOMEWHERE ELSE
AND SAME FOR THE FOR THE VOLUME BUTTONS AND THE THE T
WELL I WAS I WAS THINKING UH SINCE A T. V. IS UH MOSTLY USED TOGETHER WITH A V. C. R. OR D. V. D. PLAYER OR RECORDER
HI FI SET IS UH NOT OFTEN USED UH AS I KNOW OF IN COMBINATION WITH TELEVISION
HE IS THE WHATEVER
PROJECT JOC PROJECT DOCUMENTS IS FOR SHOWING UH ON THE WHITE BOARD
I WILL NEED IT
WELCOME AT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING AGAIN PRESENTED BY MAARTEN
UH WE'VE GOT THREE PRESENTATIONS
OH WELL THIS IS THE THE CLOSING ALREADY
SO UH WELL WE START OFF WITH THE TH THE FIRST PRESENTATION THEN
UH I THINK UM IN UH WE HAVE TO DO IT IN UH IN RIGHT ORDER
OH THAT
UH OH
UH DUE TO SOME UH TECHNICAL PROBLEMS I HAVEN'T UH DIGITIZED THE LAST UH THE MEETING MINUTES
AND I'LL GET THIS ONE UH IN DIGITAL UH FORM TOO
WELL UH WILL THERE BE SOME UH USER REQUIREMENTS LATER ON
YEAH WELL SOME OF THESE UH YEAH
WELL SOME OF THAT WILL YEAH BUT I BUT IT WILL BE MORE CLEAR WHEN WE COME TO THE UH U UH SOME OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS
WELL NOW I SEE FOUR
SO THE COMPROMISE WE COULD MAKE IS JUST TO MAKE ONE TELETEXT BUTTON YOU KNOW LIKE ON AND OFF
OTHERWISE THE PROJECT BECOMES MORE COMPLEX WHICH ENDANGERS THE TIME T T MA UH THE TIME TO MARKET
SO YOU UH TALKED ABOUT THE ELDERLY WHO WERE WILLING TO SPEND MORE ON A REMOTE CONTROL AND WHO WERE INTERESTED
YEAH BUT IT IS IT'S IS A DIF IT'S A FACT THAT THE TH TH THAT BIGGER MARKET YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WE ALREADY COVER THAT
MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S PRIMARILY INTERESTING FOR THE YOUNGER GROUP BUT ISN'T THAT BAD FOR AN OLDER PERSON EITHER
YEAH YOU WILL HAVE TO LOOK THAT UP
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE OH OKAY
I THOUGHT IT W MIGHT BE LET'S MAKE THINGS BETTER OR SOMETHING BUT
Y WELL THAT
M YEAH THAT'S WHY UM WELL A LOT OF UM THE USE THE REQUIREMENTS THE THE ACCOUNT MANAGER SENT ME
AND NO UH OTHER UH S FUNCTIONS THAN JUST T. V. BUT THEY S DO AIM AT A YOUNGER WELL MA
BUT I THINK UH YOU WE CAN MAKE SOME DISCUSS UH DISTINCTIONS IN UH WHAT KIN IN THE KNOW TH TH IN FUNCTIONS YOU HAVE
YOU YOU CAN MAKE VERY D YOU CAN PUT VERY DETAILED FUNCTIONS REGARDING THE T. V. SET ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL UH WITH THE WITH UH THE
BUT W MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT SOME FUNC UH I KNOW THAT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE A D. V. D. PLAYER THEY WANT TO
NO YEAH TH TH THE USER REQUIREMENTS OF THE THE THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS TOLD US NOT TO BUT MAYBE W YEAH
YEAH WELL WE SHOULD UH PUT SOME FUNCTIONS FOR OTHER MAYBE FOR OTHER EQUIPMENT ON IT
MAYBE LIKE REWIND AND WIND OR N WHAT D WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
YEAH IF AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
DO TH SHOULD WE IMPLEMENT FEATURES THAT UH UH OR FUNCTIONS THAT TO CONTROL OTHER DEVICES
MAYBE IT'S MAYBE THERE THERE THERE IS SOMETHING TH M MOST OF THE TIME THESE FUNCTIONS DON'T SUPPORT THE PARTICULAR DEVICE AS WELL AS THEIR THEIR OWN REMOTE CONTROL
NO NO YOU DON'T NO NO YOU DON'T NEED IT
OKAY BUT WE HAVE TO THINK UH W WE HAVE TO THINK D. V. D. I TH UH I GUESS
UH YOU GET TWO SPEED OR EIGHT SPEED OR SIXTEEN SPEED
MAYBE IF WE JUST LEAVE THE D. V. D. FUNCTIONAL M UH WELL I WAS THINKING ABOUT PUTTING IT IN
BUT CONCERNING THE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT YOU JUST SAID I THINK WE M SHOULD FOCUS ON THE T. V. THEN
IT'S JUST A S IT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS LIKE A GADGET ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE
AND IT'S JUST FOR WHEN YOU YOU YOU JUMP ON THE COUCH
YOU PICK UP THE THE THE NICE REMOTE THE SIMPLE ONE JUST TO PUT ON THE TELEVISION NOTHING MORE
UH
OKAY A T A TELETEXT BUTTON SHOULD BE THERE
YEAH YEAH BUT MAYBE YOU S YEAH YEAH MAYBE Y YOU DO BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
WE HAVE TO WELL T YEAH AND T AND TELETEXT IS BECOMING OUTDATED
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU TH GUYS THINK
OKAY IT GOES YEAH BUT THAT'S KIND OF STUFF WE SHOULD DO ON THE INTERNET RIGHT NOW
THAT'S WHY IT WAS UH SAID IN THE IN THE USE IN THE R NEW REQUIREMENTS
AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SKIP MANUALLY THROUGH THEM USING I THINK WE SHOULD JUST PUT ONE TELETEXT BUTTON ON IT
WE ALSO MEET THE OTHER THIN Y YOU SH YOU JUST RE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FOR THE THE SIMPLE DESIGN I GUESS
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD PLACE THEM ON A UH IN A SPECIAL WAY
YEAH SOMETHING OR UH SOMETHIN SPECIAL WAY TO TO ZAP THROUGH THE IT HAS TO S IT HAS TO BE YEAH AND QUICK
YEAH AND IT THE BUTTONS SHOULD MAKE IT UM POSSIBLE TO TO ZAP THROUGH YOUR CHANNELS IN A RAPID AT A RAPID PACE
OH WHAT SHOULD WE DECIDE ON THEN
THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS WHICH UH WEREN'T WORKED OUT ALREADY BUT IT W SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM THEN
NOT NOT UH THE B THE WATCH KIND TH THE MOST UH WELL IT HAS TO BE SIMPLE AND I WI
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HA WE HAVE LEFT UH
M M M MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES
WELL UH THESE THESE SHOULDN'T
DO YOU UH HAVE YOU HAVE YOU THINK ABOUT THA THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
IT W IT W SHOULD BE LIKE A BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR SOMETHING THAT YOU GIVE SOMEONE AND IT IS I HAS SOMETHING NICE
OR MAYBE IT W SHOULD HAVE A BIG UH LIGHT THAT CAN FLASH OR SOMETHING ON IT
OR MAYBE IT SHOULD OR AN OR THE LIKE THE THE CAN OPENER
MAYBE IT CONTAINS SOME FEATURE THAT YOU DON'T NORMALLY LINK TO A REMOTE CONTROL
SO MAYBE WITH WITH BOUNCING PADS SO THAT YOU CAN JUST THROW IT ON THE FLOOR OR SOMETHING
YOU KNOW Y NOT S PEOPLE WHEN THEY BUY IT THEY HAVE TO THINK WELL THIS ONE LASTS FOR A LONG TIME
NOT SOME THING YOU YOU THROW AWAY NEXT WEEK YOU KNOW
SO MAYBE UH THAT'S I I THINK THAT'S WHEN UH WHEN WE DECIDE ON THESE TYPE OF FUNCTIONS
UH ALSO FOR YOU MAYBE WHEN T YOU IT'S VERY NICE WHEN YOU CAN BE ENTRA WHEN YOU CAN BE TRENDY
AND AND UH AND AL AS IN A FRIEND USE FRIENDLY AS WELL YOU KNOW
IT COULD BE BE YEAH YOU NEVER KNOW BUT
IF YOU WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING YOU KNOW IT'S HA DOESN'T HAVE MUCH FUNCTIONS WANT TO BE YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IT L MAKE IT
AND SHOU AND SHOULD NI LOOK NICE WHEN YOU PUT IT ON A TABLE
YEAH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT ON ITS SO IT'S LIKE A VASE OR UH SOMETHING YOU PUT ON A TABLE
UH THAT'S KIND OF NICE
YEAH THAT W YEAH BUT YEAH THE PRO NO WELL I THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE T P WELL NEE BUT WE DON'T YEAH
THEN THE THEN THE MONEY THERE MUST BE MONEY TO SPEND ON THAT KIND OF ST YOU KNOW RECHARGEABLE UNITS
YEAH BUT WE WOULD D MA WE'D DO IT IN TAIWAN AND SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT EXPEN
S SOME KIND OF BE I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE AND YOU MAKE IT UH UM BE UH YOU SEE IT WITH UH THE MO THE MOUSES NOWADAYS
WELL I WELL IT'S REALLY CH YOU CAN RECHARGE IT SO YOU HA NEVER HAVE THE BATTERY PROBLEM
UH OKAY
BUT YOU WILL YOU DO NEED UH ALSO AN UH ALSO YOU WOULD NEED A BATTERY IN THE THE BASE UNIT AS WELL YOU KNOW
YEAH BUT THEN IT'S VERY EASY TO MAKE IT ALSO A RECHARGEAB I DON'T THINK THAT IS GONNA COST MUCH TO MAKE IT ALSO A RECHARGE FUNCTION IN IT
AND MAKE IT YOU KNOW WE WE UM
WELL WE UH IT'S IT ISN'T A T A MOST UH COSTLY UH REMOTE CONTROL
WE JUST PUT SOME SIMPLE BUTTON IN MAKE IT BIG AND STURDY NOTHING MORE AND JUST MAKE S SURE THERE'S SOME NOISE THAT IT CAN MAKE
OR PROBABLY SOME KIND OF CHEAP LIGHT THING AROUND IT OR THAT IT UH THAT IT LIGHTS UP IT'S ALSO NICE
AND IF YOU PUT IT AWAY I THINK IT'S UH W WE HAVE TO WE UH THAT'S UH IT'S NOT A EASY MARKET
AND WE CAN'T DELIVER THAT IN R WITH UH REGARDS TO THE FUNCTIONS BECAUSE WE AREN'T GONNA PUT
AND THEN UH WHEN MAKE IT YOU KNOW NICE LOOKING SHAPE AND THIS AND THEN YOU ALSO YOU GOT THE STAND UP THING
OH IF IT LET'S WELL WE WILL SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE THE COSTS AND IF IT'S POSSIBLE WE'LL DO THAT
AND WE EVEN TRY TO SAVE UP ON OTHER STUFF TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO SUCH A THING
AND THE FIRST THING WE THE MOST LIKEABLE THING TO TO N TO SKIP IS THEN PROBABLY THE RECHARGE FUNCTION OR SOMETHING
SO Y B BECAUSE IT'S VERY ANNOYING WHEN YOUR BATTERY IS EMPTY
WELL WE WILL WE WILL I THINK WE'LL WORK THAT OUT ZAPPING NUMBERS ON IT BI
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE EVER HAVE THOSE PROBLEMS AND YOU WON'T HAVE IF IF YOU HAVE THE RECHARGEABLE
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THE UNIT YOU CAN ALSO PUT IT ON THE SIDE IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT
UH I I IN THE IN THE MA YEAH BUT IT W I MEAN
IF IF THEY PAY FOR IT BECAUSE THEY THINK OH THAT'S A GREAT IDEA I'M GONNA USE IT
I THINK LAST LONG ENOUGH THEN THEY PUT IT ON SIDE AND THEY CAN USE IT NOW AND THEN
THEN WHEN THEY LOOK GET M I I I KNOW FOR SURE THAT EVERYBODY WHO BUYS THIS REMOTE CONTROL
WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS OF THEY WILL BE IN THE SITUATION THAT THEY THEY'RE SEEKING FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
THEY WANNA SEE SOMETHING QUICK AND UH JUST PUSH THE BUTTON AND TH UH I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT
M MAYBE WE SHOULD REALLY DO THIS
OH NOW I'VE PUT UH WELL IT IS TWENTY P OKAY SO WE HAVE TEN MINUTES OR SOMETHING
WELL THERE IS SOME OH
THE THE S THE NEXT MINUTES WON'T BE A PROBLEM
USE FOR THE OTHER ONES WELL BUT UH I D THINK UH I FORGOT TO DO PUT DONE UNDER THE FIRST ONE
AND WHEN YOU GO WRITE A SECOND UH IT'S GET IT'S NOT WORKING WHEN YOU TRY TO WRITE SECOND UH PAPER OR SOMETHING
THIS KIND OF LOOKS YOU LIKE
OR I THINK SOME MAYBE WE SHOULD NO THAT WILL BE TOO COSTLY
WE SHOU WE COULD ALSO THAT WAS A WOULD ALSO BE AN IDEA BUT I DON'T THINK IT I DON'T KNOW IF IT EXISTS ALREADY
YEAH BUT THEN YOU DON'T HAVE T YEAH IT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I THAT'S IN THE PRODUCTION COST A ONE IT'S A ONE TIME
YOU KNOW S WAS IT'S A SINGLE COST
YEAH M BUT BUT THEN YOU CAN NAH I DON'T THIN I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE
BECAUSE I'VE BOUGHT THE ALESSI STUFF MORE OFTEN AND EVEN SMALL PENCIL HOLDERS OR SOMETHING ARE MORE EXPENSIVE
LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR SO OR SO
AND ON TH AND THEN UH S A BASE UNIT UNDERNEATH IT
IT'S ALSO ROUND
PUT IT IN THERE UH WIRE ON IT
HOW WE'RE G WELL MAYBE UH S A RING OF NO NO YOU HAVE TO MAYBE ON THE SIDE OF IT
WHEN YOU YOU SEE IT FROM THE SIDE THEN IT WOULD LOOK JUST LIKE THAT
HE'S UH WHEN I PUT IT IN IS IS GOING TO BEEP BEEP BEEP
OKAY HOW CAN I GET THIS ON THE WHITEBOARD
'KAY WE'RE GOING TO UM
IT'S A COMMON UH TECHNOLOGY UH LIKE I TOLD UM UH THE CIRCUIT BOARD IT'S THE MOST UM IMPORTANT UH
UH
I HAVEN'T COME TO HERE BUT
UH
BUT IS IT USEFUL TO PUT THEM ON A ON A STANDARD UH REMOTE
BUT HOW WI HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE TO HANDLE A WHOLE MARKET
ON THE Z ON THE ZAP BUTTONS YOU CAN PUT IT TO UH TO UH ACCESS ALL THE SAME PAGES
MAYBE TH M
THAT'S TO BE UH A FORMED FOR YOUR HAND
BUT THAT'S THAT'S FUN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THEN THE SECOND
BUT BUT REMOTE CONTROLS REMOTE CONTROLS NOWADAYS CAN CAN LAST UH TWO YEARS THREE YEARS WITH WITH T TWO BATTERIES
IN PROJECT
NO CAN THAT OPEN
ABOUT THE GET
UH
UM WELL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT THE SAME UH PICTURES AS I GOT BUT UH I GOT THESE TWO
AND I THINK THEY'RE WE HAVE TO FOCUS UH ON UH THE UH ONE HAND THE EXPERT VIEW OR THE NOVICE USER
TH I THINK IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH UH DEPENDING ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS I DON'T S UH KNOW WHO'S DOING T
YEAH WELL Y WE CAN PUT FUNCTIONS IN IT WHEN UH YEAH WHEN WE UH GET THE USER REQUIREMENTS UH AND WE CAN UPDATE IT
WELL YEAH W IF YOU WANT TRY A A A HUGE MARKET IF YOU WANT TO REACH A HUGE MARKET
IT'S IT'S REALLY UM DEPENDING ON HOW HOW HOW FAR THE THE THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE ALREADY IN N UM IN USE
UH WELL THERE ARE L AT LEAST UH BASIC FUNCTIONS UH LIKE JUST TH THE CHANNELS UH ONE TILL NINE
UH ON AND OFF SWITCH WHICH MUST BE CLEAR WITH A RED BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND FROM THAT ON WE CAN USER REQUIREMENTS WHAT WE NEED MORE
UH
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE UH ARE ANY UM UH IF YOU PUT MORE FUNCTIONS MORE BUTTONS MAYBE IT'S COM BECOMING LESS TRENDY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
M YOU CAN JUST YOU CAN K YOU CAN KEEP IT IN MIND THAT
YEAH BUT YOU SAI YOU SAID THAT THAT A LOT OF FUNCTIONS AREN'T USED
YEAH BUT UH YOU SAID YEAH D YEAH BUT TH THE FUNCTIONS ARE NOT IN THE REMOTE CONTROL WE'RE MAKING
IT'S N
I I IF IT'S TOO SIMPLE UH TH THEY WON'T USE THE REMOTE CONTROL THEY USE THEIR OWN TH TH WITH LOT MORE FUNCTIONS
KEEP IT SIMPLE AND LOOK MORE AT TH
WILL YOU LOOK
WELL UH WHEN YOU UH UH WHEN YOU LOOK UH FOR EXAMPLE UM
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I LOOKED AT THE FOR THE FLIGHTS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF FLIGHTS IN ONE PAGE SO IF IF TH
IF YOU USE LARGE BATTERIES OR SMALL BATTER BATTERIES
ON THE TELEVISION
OH LIKE THIS
THAT NOT NOT EVERYTHING IN ONE ONE UH FOLDER
OH UH LOOK UH LOOK AT THE PICTURES
YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE FRONT BUT
OH I GOT A NICE LITTLE SCREEN HERE OVER HERE
I HAVEN'T REALLY FOUND A CONCLUSION LIKE THAT
THE WORKING METHOD UM THERE WERE HUNDRED UH UH W H ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE UH
UH I'VE LINED THEM UP HERE
ABOUT ZAPPING BEHAVIOUR AND UH AND STUFF LIKE THAT
WE DO WE DO GOT A MARKET
UM THREE OUT OF FOUR PEOPLE CLAIM M UH TO FIND REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
UM THREE OUT OF FOUR USERS UH ZAPS A LOT AS I UH QUOTED HERE FROM THE UH RESULTS
OTHER FUNCTIONS LIKE AUDIO SETTINGS VIDEO SETTINGS SOUND SETTINGS ARE NOT SAID TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND UH VERY MUCH USED
IT SURE UM SAYS WE SHOULDN'T MAKE IT TOO UH COMPLICATED
AND UH ELDERLY PEOPLE OUR MARKET ARE LESS INTERESTED IN UH NICE FEATURES BUT MORE WILLINGLY TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON REMOTE CONTROLS
SO WHAT I WAS THINKING OH WRONG SIDE
WE SHOULDN'T IMPLEMENT TOO MUCH FEATURES ON UH ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE ELDERLY PEOPLE WILL GET TH LOST
WE COULD GROUP THEM UH ON ONE BUTTON
AND MAKE THEM ACCESSIBLE UH IN ONE MENU BUTTON OR WHATEVER BECAUSE THEY ARE USED VERY RARELY AND WELL
IT UH THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS THERE SO WE CAN REALLY MAKE UH YEAH HOW DO YOU SAY
AND UM IF YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT V. C. R. AND D. V. D. OPTIONS GROUP THEM IN THE BUTTON NOT TOO UH
NOT TOO MUCH NO
MAYB YEAH
NOT TOO MUCH THEN BU ALRIGHT
OR WE CAN U U WE COULD PUT 'EM BEHIND THE FLIP FLAP OR WHATEVER
SO T
I THINK ON A REMOTE CONTROL FOR TELEVISION YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROGRAMME UH THE V. C. R. TO START RECORDING AT THREE P. M. OR WHATEVER
YEAH I KNOW BUT UH
THEN I THINK IT'S VERY IRRITATING IF THE NEXT PAGE SHOWS UP BUT
WELL I USE IT VERY REGULARLY THE ACTION
I RE I USE IT QUITE OFTEN
I THINK THE PLUS AND THE MINUS BUTTON SHOULD BE UH QUITE PRESENT YEP
I THINK THAT'S N THAT'S MORE FOR A FOR AN AGE RANGE OR UH TEN TO TWELVE OR WHATEVER
YE I THINK THE CAN OPENER I IS A BRILLIANT IDEA ACTUALLY BECAUSE TELEVISION AND BEER IS NOT A RARE COMBINATION
AS I UH AS I SAID DURING MY PRESENTATION FIFTY PERCENT UH O
I IN IN THE BASE WE COULD LIKE MAKE UH A BUTTON AND IF YOU PUSH IT THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF S MAKES NOISE
THAT'S PROBABLY STUPID BUT UH AS I FOUND HERE UH FIFTY PERCENT WAS IT FIFTY
IF AN A BUTTON IN IN THAT UH
WELL Y YOU YOU COULD CONNECT THAT TO TWO HUNDRED TO TWENTY VOLTS OF COURSE
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU DON'T DO IT WE CAN ALSO MAKE A NICE BAY
I MEAN IT LOOKS TRENDY AND STILL STILL PUT A BLEEP FUNCTION IN IT BUT UM I THINK THE BAY IS DEFINITELY UH
ON OUR NICE WHITEBOARD UM A LITTLE UH IDEA OF YEAH
THE SHAPE IS NICE IT'S UM
UH
HALF AND HOUR
UH YEAH
IT UH IT UH STILL SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES SO THE THE FIRST PART OF THE MINUTES ARE VERY HARD TO READ
SO BUT UH FROM NOW ON I WON'T USE MY PEN ANYMORE SO WILL BE P JUST ORDINARY KEYBOARD
WELL IT'S A POSSIBILITY TOO
OH WE DECIDED UPON THAT IN THE LAST MEETING
WELL THA I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY NEW REQUIREMENTS OR SOMETHI JUST NO BUT WE DECIDED TO USE ONLY B BASIC FUNCTIONS ONLY
W JUST THESE ARE THE ONES YOU ALREADY SUMMED UP IN THE
UH I MEAN TH TH THE THE TWO TWO BASIC BUTTONS YOU KNOW THE TO SKIP CHANNELS AND TO UH
I THINK YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I THINK THAT IS THAT'S T TRENDY TOO BECAUSE THAT'S THE MO IT IT YOU KNOW
IT PUTS AN EXTRA ACCENT ON THE THE ON THE SIMPLICITY OF OUR REMOTES TO J TO MAKE THESE TWO MOST BASIC FUNCTIONS EXTRA BIG LIKE T
UH
NO BUT I I I THINK THAT UH OUR DESIGN ALREADY RESEMBLES SO A PIECE OF FRUIT
YEAH BUT IT THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU YOU KNOW LIKE EXPLICITLY OF S OUR F OF A OF A SPECIFIC PIECE OF FRUIT
AND SO Y I I THINK THIS Y IT ALREADY SEM RESEMBLES UH SOMETHING LIKE A PEAR TO ME OR SOMETHING
YOU DO GET THE IDEA EH
OF D DESIGN TEAM YEAH
IT'S PEAR I GUESS
AND UH BUT I DO LIKE THE YEAH I DO LIKE UH THE F UH TO THE IDEA OF MAKING A A Y UH
A CATCHY COLOUR DESIGN AND A D BECAUSE I DO I THINK A DARK COLOUR WOULD BE NICE TOO
BUT I DON'T THINK OUR OUR COMPANY COLOURS ARE THIS FASHIONABLE
YEAH ON UH N UH ON THE BOTTOM OF THE REMOTE YOU CAN DO
SEE WHAT WAS ON THE AGENDA
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THERE UH YEAH UM DO WE WANT TO UM USE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY FOR EXAMPLE
ME NEITHER
I DO I THINK IT'S A BIT REDUNDANT ACTUALLY
AND IT'S ALSO NOT I DON'T TH EVEN THINK IT IT LOOKS S LIKE SEXY OR SOMETHING IT'S
I REALLY UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR JOB MORE EXCITING BY PUTTING AN L. C. D. IN IT
UH IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO USE THESE PLASTIC MATERIALS WITH SOFT RUBBER STUFF ON IT
IT WAS OUR IDEA YOU KNOW TO GIVE IT A MORE STURDY LOOK AND THAT YOU CA LIKE YOU CAN THROW WITH IT
YOU COULD MAKE IT BUT IT'S JUST IT IT DOESN'T I DON'T THINK IT IT'S COHERENT WITH THE DESIGN WE'RE AFTER
WELL YOU YOU Y OKAY WE CAN VOTE FOR IT
I DON'T WANT TO AND HE DOESN'T SO IT'S UP TO HIM
BUT DID WE SKIP THE YEAH YOU COULD DO M BUT WHAT WHAT I SO WHAT I BUT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
OH WELL UH I'VE SEEN IT DONE BEFORE
DO YOU KNOW TH LIKE THE THE BIGGER REM UH UNIVERSAL REMOTES THEY HAVE D L. C. D. DISPLAYS
BUT IT JUST IT J IT DOESN'T DOESN'T MATCH WITH THE OUR WHOLE BASIC CONCEPT
YEAH WELL DO YOU HA DO YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AFTER THE TRENDINESS OF L. C. D. DISPLAYS HAVE YOU
I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL HOW TO WITH YOU GUYS BUT
WE ALREADY WE'RE UH YEAH WE ALREADY HAVE THE THE TH TH TH BASE STATION GADGETS
I J UH AND REALLY I DON'T SEE HOW THE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY IS GONNA ADD ANYTHING YOU KNOW ON A DESIGN LEVEL
UH I THINK IT'S SLICKER TO HAVE NO L. CEDS
Y WE WANT TO IT'S SIMPLICITY
W YOU HAVE TWO BIG BUTTONS AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH THESE TWO BUTTONS SO YOU DON'T NEED AN L. C. D.
UH BUT RE WE REALLY HAVE TO CUT THIS OFF
I RE I KNOW YOU I I I I I GET THE IDEA YOU REALLY LIKE IT YOU KNOW
PROBABLY SO
UH
YOU KNOW TO GIVE IT UH YOU KNOW THE SOFT TOUCH IN YOUR HANDS AND ALSO TO
KNOW LIKE YEAH THAT IS Y THE B AIRBAG KIND OF THING
YOU CAN ST THROW IT AT YOUR LITTLE BROTHER'S HEAD
AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE DARK T COL DARK COLOUR BIT YOU KNOW
IT MUSTN'T BE TOO N YOU KNOW TH TOO OVERWHELMING THEN WHEN YOU PUT IT ON YOUR JUST
MAYBE JUST BRING IT OUT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS BUT NOT AF THAT YOU CAN SWITCH FRONTS AFTERWARDS THAT'S ALSO TOO MUCH
SO WE UH AGREED UPON UH N UH WELL NOT U UNANIMOUSLY OR HOW YOU CALL IT BUT YEAH
O O ONLY ONLY THE LAST POINT YOUR NO TITANIUM'S NOT NOT OUT OF QUESTION I GUESS
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE BOTH THE THE PLASTIC AND SO UH SOFT THINGS AND T P TITANIUM AS WELL
NO BUT UH UH YOU SHOULD MA YEAH
WELL WOULD IT BE MORE TRENDY
MORE CHIC
IS IS IT FITS IN OUR S PHILOSOPHY TO MAKE IT UH STURDY AND SIMPLE AND UH KNOW LIKE UH
OH MAYBE TH MAYBE THIS IS AN
NO I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF MAYBE A T TITANIUM KIND TYPE OF BODY W AND THEN WITH S PLASTIC COLOURATION AROUND IT
MAYBE WE SHOULD UH SHOU
MAYBE WE SH SHOULD WE T I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT UH HOW HOW MUCH TIME HAVE WE GOT LEFT
BUT LET'S THINK ABOUT THE BAS
BUT WHA TH OUR BASIC IDEA Y I MEAN YOU GONNA WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE LIKE TWO TYPE OF MATERIALS
WE HAVE TO INCORPORATE THE LIGHTS TOO
BUT UH DO W GONNA GONNA ARE WE GOING TO GIVE IT A TWO TONE COLOUR LOOK
LIKE THE THE PLASTIC MOULD IS IN IN ONE COLOUR AND THE S THE CUSHION PADS AROUND IT ARE IN ANOTHER COLOUR
IS THAT THE IDEA
IS THAT A GOOD IDEA
HOW MANY COLOURS ARE WE HOW MANY COLOURS ARE WE GONNA WE'RE UH UH F UH F ONLY FIVE MINUTES LEFT BY THE WAY
T
OKAY BUT NOT MORE THAN WELL YEAH IT'S NO
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT ON A L IN A LATER MEETING
UH OH YEAH THE THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE THE BUTTONS
YEAH BUT I THINK YOU HA I REALLY NEED A MENU BUTTON
TH IN THAT WAY WE HAVE LIKE ONLY THE NUMBERS THE POWER BUTTON SKIP AND VOLUME AND THEN UH UH TEN UH REM UH YEAH MUTE
SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT A S UH NO UH WHICH SH UH SHOULD REMIND US OF THE REMOTE ITSELF I GUESS
UH IN ONE COLOUR
I THINK THE SPONGY THING ALREADY UM COMES FORWARD IN THE IN THE IN THE CUSHIONS PADS AND THINGS ON THE S UH SIDE
THE FRUITY THING IS JUST THE SHAPE SHOULD BE FRU I DID I THINK THIS IS KIND OF FRUITY YOU KNOW
BUT AND BUT IT D IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANNOYING THAT WHEN YOU UH KNOW SOME THINGS IS JUST OVER THE TOP
AND WHEN YOU HAVE IT ON YOUR TABLE FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS YOU IT JUST GETS ANNOYING BECAUSE IT'S SO BIG AND FLASHY
TO GET TO THAT
BUT WE I THINK ALSO WE JUST SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH COLOUR BUT ALSO
I THINK THAT'S UH ADDS TO THE TOO MUCH COLOUR MAYBE M UM
BUT OUR DES DESIGN EXPERTS WILL UH WORK THAT OUT
YEAH UH NO FOR SU FOR SURE BECAUSE I'M WILL NOW TYPE THEM OUT
WE HAVE TO CHOOSE TH UH THESE UH WISELY AND IT COULD AFFECT UH UH A KIND OF GROW OF IN UH IN BUYING UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS
UM THE COMPONENTS OF A REMOTE CONTROL ARE OF COURSE UH THE CASE
UM IT HAS TO BE SOLID UH IN HARD MATERIAL LIKE UH HARD PLASTIC UH WITH SOFT RUBBER FOR UH FALLING AND AND UH UH YEAH
MM THE BUTTONS HAS TO BE UH SOLID TOO AND THE MATERIAL IS SOFT RUBBER
UH I'VE GOT A UH EMAIL FROM THE POSSIBILITIES OF REAL REACTION
WE MUST USE A RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS TO UH THE THE RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED CASE IS A IS A T UH THREE DIMENSIONAL UH CURVE IN THE IN THE DESIGN
UH
THE ENERGY SOURCE UH I'VE GOT A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES FOR THAT TOO
UH THE BASIC BATTERY WHICH I THI PREFER BECAUSE OF ITS UH ITS NON UH NON DEPENDING OF OF OF UH UM
ALSO IN UH THIS ONE LIKE IN THE WATCHES BUT A REMOTE CONTROL CAN LIE ON A TABLE FOR A DAY
UH ALSO THE CASE MATERIAL UH I THINK THAT PLASTIC IS THE IS THE BEST WITH RUBBER BECAUSE UH WOOD OR TITANIUM
THE CHIP UH THE CHIP SET UH AND THE BOARD IS UH ALL OFF THE SHELF
ALSO THE SPEAKER IN THE REMOTE CONTROL WHEN WE WANT TO RETRIEVE IT
I'VE TOLD ABOUT UH THE THREE FIRST POINTS
YEAH I LOOKED UP ON WAS UH THE L. C. D. DISPLAYS
AH YEAH
I TH I GOT AN EMAIL WITH UH SOME EXAMPLES AND IT THESE WERE WERE THE MOST TRENDIEST ONE
YOU SEE UH A COVERS WHICH CAN BE
YES MAYBE WE CAN UH BRI UH BRING A COUPLE OF UH COUPLE OF TYPES OF UH MAYBE A KIND OF UH WHOLE UH
UH HOUSE UH STUFF
MAYBE WE CAN BRING T UH UH TELETEXT TO THE T TO THE REMOTE CONTROL
GRAPES
WE HAVE TO MAKE ONE DESIGN I TH I I THINK
MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN MAKE A T. V. GUIDE ON IT FOR THE CHANNEL YOU'RE ON
ON YOUR
NO ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN Y YOU CAN READ TEXT ALSO
SO WHY NOT ON YOUR REMOTE
UH PROGRAMME UH INFORMATION OR OR OR OR G OR A GUIDE
ON T ON TELETEXT YES
ALSO ON THE INTERNET
Y YES YOU CAN USE UH BUTTONS UH UH W THAT ARE ALREADY UH ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR DOUBLE FUNCTIONS
BUT BUT UH YEAH WHAT HE SAID WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE TELEVISIONS THEY HAVE TO BE UH CUSTOMISED TO THE
BUT WHE BUT WHEN YOU PUT A A A TRANSPARENT UH PLASTIC UH
WHEN WHEN YOU PUT UH MAYBE A COLOUR L. C. D. T UH SCREEN ON IT IT'S VERY SPECIAL AND VERY TRENDY TO HAVE UH A REMOTE CONTROL FROM
NO WHEN Y
BUT IT LOOK
THA THE REMOTE CONTROL ON THE DOCKING STATION
YES HE HAVE A PICTURE OF IT
MAYB
MAYBE IT BUT THEN WE HAVE TO LOOK THAT IT UH W UH WILL NOT UM BE TOO CHILDISH TO SEE
ARE THESE DESIGNS
IT THIS A REAL UH YOUNG YOUNG AND DYNAMIC UH UH STYLES
BUT ALSO W
YES B BU BUT WHEN WE USE S SOFT
BUT ALSO ON THE COLOURS THE YOUNG
YES BUT A TITANIUM REMOTE CONTROL WHEN YOU'RE UH WATCHING T. V. UH OR YOUR HANDS ARE A LITTLE BIT SWEATY AND THE
YES W WE CAN DO THAT ON THE ON THE
WE CAN MAKE THIS AS A STYLE TOO
UH
UH I I DIDN'T GOT IT
UH IN A LOT OF OTHER UH
IN A LOT OF OTHER PRODUCT UH CATEGORIES LIKE UH EVEN IN B IN BAGS INDUSTRY
UH THEY BEGAN WITH UH T TYPICAL UH LEATHER BAGS BUT THEN THEY BECAME STYLISH
WITH ALL ALL SI ALL SORT OF COLOURS AND W KIND OF FON OF UH OF FRONTS LIKE WE CAN USE ON THE TELEPHONE AND IT
LIKE EASTPACK UH BEGAN A REVOLUTION WITH IT WITH ALL THIS UH KIND OF BAGS AND AND COLOURS AND AND
THEN WE CAN ALWAYS UH USE THE SAME DESIGN FOR A GREATER RESEMBLANCE BUT WITH NEW UH WITH NEW COLOURS NEW YES
THERE THERE ARE THREE UH COMPONENTS THREE COMPONENTS TYPE
YOU HAVE THE BUTTONS THE THE CASE UH ITSELF AND THE RUBBER AND TH
UH
I WILL MAKE ONE IN THE NEXT UH TWENTY MINUTES
UH OKAY
OH TITANIUM IS
UH
AH
I HA I HA I HAVE THE I HAVE
I DUNNO IF THEY'RE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT
YEAH I I UH WELL I POINTED THEM OUT HERE JUST TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER
ANOTHER FUNCTION UH IS OF COURSE WE ALREADY DISCUSS IT ON THE SIDE
UH I'VE NO IDEA ABOUT IT
UH I WAS ALSO LOOKING FOR WHAT YOU SAID FOR I GOT AN EMAIL UH UH ABOUT UH L. C. D. IN IN IN FRONT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
A LITTLE UH TOO A LITTLE BIT
IT'S IT'S JUST THE BASE THINGS WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT THE NO V. C. R. OR THAT KIND OF UH SO THAT'S VERY EASY
UH
UM OH I I GOT AN EMAIL WITH WITH AN UH A REMOTE CONTROL WITH A BASE
YEAH I'VE NOTHING TO S
UH THAT WAS ALL Y UH PERSONAL PREFERENCE I DIDN'T HAVE
BUT D DON'T WE NEED A CREATIVE ARTIST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO M MAKE IT TO FEEL LIKE A A A A VEGETABLE OR FRUIT
BUT WE WE HAVE TO UM THERE HAVE TO BE THE THE THE THE FIRM COLOURS OUR OWN UH COLOURS HAS TO BE IN IT
UH YEAH
UH YEAH
UH UH I I IF IT'S IT'S A SIMPLE P
ABOUT THAT PROGRAMME
IS IT FASHION
IT'S JUST AN IT'S JUST AN IDEA
WELL IF IF IT'S FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IT HAVE TO BE COLOURFUL
BUT CAN WE GE UH UH
MAKE IT A BEE
A BEE
YEAH IT'S OUR YEAH
YEAH THREE THREE OR FOUR UH FOUR UH COLOURS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THREE TO ONE
AND TITA UH TITANIUM IS UH IS IS IT A NO
IS
IN TRENDY THINGS
IS PLASTIC
YEAH HE IS
HERE HE IS
UH THE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THE M. P. THREE PLAYER OF NIKE
ROUGH
BUT IF YOU WANT TO LA UH YEAH LAST LONGER THAN TWO WEEKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN MAYBE
UH NO NOT TOO MUCH I THINK
IN IN ANOTHER COLOUR
THE FUNCT YEAH I WAS I WAS THINKING ABOUT TH THE ST DO WE STILL WANT A JOYSTICK IDEA
YEAH BUT WHA WHAT KIND OF MENU
IS UH ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM EVERY TELEVISION
OKAY THAT'S NOT MU NOT MUCH FUNCTIONS
TOO MUCH COLOUR I IT UH WHEN YOU GOT IT IN A LIVING ROOM IT'S TOO MUCH MAYBE
YOU SEE A KINDA PROTOTYPE YOU CAN A LITTLE BIT MORE UH
THEN YOU AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A FLAG S VERY BIG R. C.
THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE THE TH
THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE B FOUR MOST MOST USED BUTTONS ON THE TH IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
WELL I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH AGAIN ABOUT TRENDS ON THE INTERNET
I UH GOT SOME INFORMATION FROM FASHION WATCHERS FROM PARIS AND UH MILAN
AND UH THE THIRD POINT THERE IN THIS UH ORDER IF OF IMPORTANCE THE THIRD POINT IS A HIGH EASE OF USE
THE YOUNGER MARKET LIKES UH WELL THE THEMES OF OF THIS YEAR ARE UH SURPRISINGLY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND SPONGY MATERIAL
I DON'T SEE THE SPONGY PART IN IT
UH NO WE DON'T WANT DARK COLOURS
BUT TO
YEAH THE TO IMPLEMENT SOME SPONGY THING MAYBE WE CAN DO IT IN THE IN THE DOCKING STATION
AND UH WE COULD BRING ONE LINE WITH A DARK COLOUR UH TO UM UH P UH YEAH UH UH V HOW DO YOU SAY
BUT IT IT IT DOESN'T COST REALLY MUCH EFFORT TO B TO UH BRING UH LIKE A BLACK R. C. ON THE MARKET OR WHATEVER
WELL THERE THERE'S ALWAYS EMPTY SPACE OF COURSE ON A REMOTE CONTROL
NO OF COURSE NOT
A AND WE COULD USE ONE OF THESE FOR THE UH W WHAT IS IT
UH
WELL W WE CAN UH W WE CAN WE CAN PRODUCE MULTIPLE UH MULTIPLE THINGS
THIS IS THEN THE UH PEAR
I DON'T KNOW THE ENGLISH WORD SO FORGET IT
AND UM MAYBE YEAH A B A BANANA IS UH IS N NOT EASY FOR A REMOTE CONTROL BUT M YEAH
MAYB MAYBE TWO OR THREE
B BUT THAT'S GREAT AND AND AND WHAT I WAS WHAT WHAT I WAS SAYING THE CATCHY COLOURS
ON THE FRONT OF COURSE BECAUSE ELSE YOU CAN'T FIND IT
BUT IT IT HAS TO TO SHOW AN ENTIRE TITLE OF A PROGRAMME OR AT LEAST A Q A QUITE QUITE LARGE PART OF IT AND THEN YOU GET A VERY LARGE L. C. D. SCREEN
BUT THEN WE ALSO UH W NEED TO BRING OUT A LINE OF T. V. S WHICH WE WERE PLANNING TO BUT WHATEVER
AH
BUT I THINK UH WE GOTTA BUILD A B PRETTY CHEAP DESIGN TO TO STAY WITHIN OUR LIMITS
UH DID IT SAY A PRICE ALSO UH FOR FOR UH MONOGRAMME UH L. C. D. OR UH COLOURED L. C. D.
YEAH REALLY IF Y IF YOU C I
I IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR YOU CAN'T UH PUT SOMETHING ON THE MARKET WHICH IS A MONOGRAMME
W WE'VE WE'VE GOTTA FIND A BALANCE OF COURSE
IS THAT SO
EXACTLY I'VE NEVER SEEN IT IN A STORE
YEAH FOR THE SPONGY UH FEEL
IF YOU DROP IT IF YOU DROP IT THE AIRBAG COMES OUT YEAH
YEAH B YEAH THAT'S WHAT W I I WAS POINTING AT
OH A BEE
WELL WE CAN AS AS I
WE CAN PUT THE LOGO ON OUR UH ON OUR BASE STATION
UH YEAH
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE FRUIT FRUITY STUFF WITH UH
YEAH IF IT'S JUST A COLOUR UH WHICH YOU UH WHICH YOU CHANGE THEN I GUESS IT'S IT'S NICE TO HAVE ONE OF THESE
UH
UH YEAH YEAH
TH TH THE UH BASE IN A IN ANOTHER
YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S I WAS THINKING THAT'S GOTTA BE ON THE TELEVISION
YEAH IF IT'S C IF
YEAH I THINK IT'S OKAY TO TO ADD A MENU BUTTON FOR UH AND IF THE T. V. DOESN'T HAVE A MENU THEN
YEAH YOU CAN PUT THAT ON THE TWO EIGHT FOUR AND SIX OR WHATEVER
YEAH IT'S KINDA FRUITY AND WITH TH WITH CATCHY COLOURS UH UH W
YEA YEAH
OH WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION FIRST
OH NO THE THE THE MUTE BUTTON MISSES NOW
DO Y DO YOU DID WE WANT TO HAVE A M MUTE BUTTON
UH THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS FOR REMOTE CONTROLS TO UH DO UH LIKE
UH Y TH TH TH THE TWO NUMBERS
BECAU B L A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS WORK THAT Y WHEN Y THAT YOU WHEN YOU FIR YOU PUSH THE ONE FIRST
NAH I DON'T THINK SO REALLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A I KNOW SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT DON'T HAVE THESE BUTTONS
NO I THINK UH I REALLY THINK IT'S N BECAUSE YOU CAN WHEN WHEN YOU PUT A BUTTON ON IT WITH LIKE ONE AND UH THEN A DASH
IT'S THE SAME THING AS WHEN YOU JUST PUSH THE ONE
I IN TH IN THE FIRST PLACE IT GIVES A SIGNAL WHICH IT WOULD ALSO SEND WHEN YOU PUT A SEPARATE BUTTON ON IT
THE ONE WITH DASH THAT SIGNAL GI AND WHEN Y WHE WHEN YOU DON'T PUSH ANOTHER BUTTON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL WITHIN FIVE SECONDS
YEAH BUT IT'S EXACT THE SAME THAT W WOULD APPEAR WHEN YOU PUT A SEPARATE BUTTON PUSH A SEPARATE BUTTON
I THINK IT'S EXACT THE SAME THING WHEN Y
LISTEN WITH THAT THAT'S THAT SPECIAL BUT BUTTON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EH
THAT'S JUST A SIGNAL TO RECEI JU THEY SEND A T SIGNAL TO THE V TV T. V. THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT A ONE IN ON YOUR SCREEN AND A DASH
WHICH YOU CAN PU SO YOU CAN UH STILL PUT ANOTHER NUMBER ON IT
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THAT SEPARATE BUTTON AND YOU PUSH Y ONE IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING
DO Y YOU THE REMOTE CONTROL GIVES THAT SAME SIGNAL AS IT WOULD GIVE WHEN YOU ONLY HAD
THAT'S THE SAME THING AS THE BUTTON WITH THE ONE AND IT YES IT IT IS
YEAH BUT I M UH BUT IT'S I I KNOW FOR SURE THAT SOME TELEVISIONS THAT W TH TH THE REMOTE CONTROL SUPPLIED
BUT WHEN YOU USE A BU A N REMOTE CONTROL THAT DOESN'T SPORT THESE BUTTONS IT STILL WORKS
BUT I STILL THINK I IT IT ALL T. V. S IN SOME WAYS SUPPORT IT I DON'T KNOW
BUT I THINK THERE'S MORE TO IN THAN WHA THAN WHAT YOU JUST SAID
I DO THINK THAT UH M T. V. S SUPPORT MUR MULTIPLE KIND OF REMOTE CONTROLS
TH WON'T WORK WI WITH UH TO HAVE THAT SPECIAL BUTTON
WELL LET'S HA LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DOCKING STATION LATER BECAUSE UH MAYBE WE HAVE WE HAVE TO UH CONSIDER THE DOCKING STATION ANYWAY
BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK N I DON'T KNOW
I THINK ADDED LIGHTS ARE GONNA BE A PROBLEM TOO
YEAH WHAT WAS UH ON THE
OKAY BUT IN THE OH YEAH THE COLOUR
THEN WE'RE GONNA DO THE BUTTONS IN THE I ARE WE'RE GONNA HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS
AND THEY'RE BE A THEY'LL BE IN THE SAME COLOUR AS THE RUBBER ON THE SIDE
BUT UH AND WE HAVE TO AGREE UH UPON THE EXACT COLOURS BUT MAY I DUNNO IF THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER
UM THE NEXT P Y YOU GONNA GIVE A PRESENTATION TOO
UH I HAVE TO SEE THE AGENDA
YEAH I THINK FOUR MAYBE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT'S
YEAH BUT WE D WE DIDN'T WE'RE WE'RE NOT PLANNING TO USE FRONTS I BELIEVE
WITH A COLOUR A CO A COLOURS
OH MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THREE OR SOMETHING THAT W YOU KNOW OUR
UH I WAS THINKING ABOUT FOUR SO I THINK THREE IS UH
CAME A LONG WAY BUT NOT WE DIDN'T NOT UH
NO W W IT CAN ALSO ALWAYS BE MORE SIMPLISTIC BUT TWO IS YEAH
SO SO I THINK MAYBE IT HAS TO SCORE HIGHER UH ON THIS THAN ON THE
A TH A THREE
YEAH BUT WE HAVE T WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE LIGHTS UH
NO I THINK I THINK ACTUALLY IT'S A SEVEN MAYBE BUT THERE'S NOTHING INNOVATIVE ABOUT IT
N NO NO T
YOU HAVE MUST BE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR REMOTE CONTROLS BUT MORE IN HOW YOU CONTROL STUFF NOT IN HOW YOU FIND YOUR YEAH
YEAH AS A A ONE OR A TWO MA UH AT LEAST
OH YOU SKIPPED ONE UH
AH YEAH JUST MAKE IT WE'LL MAKE IT A TWO
OH THE OH SORRY NO NOT NOT THE SLOGAN
YEAH YOU CAN PUT THAT ON THE SIDE IF IF WE WOULD LIKE TO
YEAH AND THAT'S MOSTLY THE INNO WHEN WE UH SCORE HIGHER ON INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY WE WOULD SCORE TWO
I'M GONNA OPEN THE SPREADSHEET AND WE'RE GONNA WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALLY FIN UH I HAVE A
ONE BATTERY
WHERE DID WE FIND THIS INFORMATION
F YOUR FIRST PRESENTATION TO MAKE THIS CLEAR BUT THEN YOU HAD SOME T TIME PROBLEMS
BUT DO YOU TH YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT CHIP WE NEED
MAYBE YOU CAN UH LOOK IT UP RIGHT NOW
WHAT IS IT M IS THAT THE SPEAKER WE WERE T I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
YEAH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SPECIAL COLOUR BUT I THINK W UH
WELL THAT'S BIT OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE I RE BUT I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I CAN IMAGINE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH FAR MORE PUSH BUTTONS
BECAUSE OH THIS IS OH THIS IS ONE OKAY
TWELVE OKAY THEN IT WOULD BE EIGHTEEN BECAUSE UH I UH RATED THEM AS UH UM
AS UH UH UH SEPARATE BUTTONS
AND PLUS THESE TWO F UH PLUS THE MUTE BUTTON AND IT'S WILL BE UH EIGHTEEN
Y I DO I DON'T GET THE POINT BECAUSE IT'S WOULD BE
S RELATIVELY SO EXPENSIVE JUST THESE M SMALL BUTTONS
HERE NOW IT'S NOW IT'S ALREADY S SHALL WE JUST
THA W LE LET'S SEE TH WE HAVE UH OH YEAH BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
UH I THINK WE SHOULD MARK THE SPECIAL FORM THING BECAUSE IT THIS WILL BE SOME SPECIAL FORMS INCORPORATED IN THESE BIG BUTTONS I GUESS
YEAH SPECIAL MATERIAL R ALSO BECAUSE I HAS RUBBER
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A DOCKING STATION IN THIS LIST BUT WE CAN ALL IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A DOCKING STATION FOR THIRTY CENTS
YEAH BUT I DO LIKE THE IDEA BUT WE YEAH
BUT WE CAN BUT THEN YOU STILL HAVE TO USE WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT CHIP WE U NEED
'CAUSE I THINK WE UH YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHAT WHAT WHAT THEY UH MEAN
BUT CAN WE FIND OUT UH ABOUT UH THIS CHIPS
OH N UH OH STILL OH IT'S GONNA GET MORE EXPENSIVE WITH
YEAH BU BU BUT WHEN WE YEAH BUT WHEN WE SKIP WHEN WE UM WHEN WE DON'T USE THE DO WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE THE DOCKING STATION
IT STILL IS A SPECIAL REMOTE CONTROL CONS UH YOU KNOW WI ITS FORM IS SPECIAL AND MATERIAL
YEAH AND W AND AND WE UH NEED F AND WHAT IS THIS
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FOR S PRESENTATION
OH OH OH
I DON'T THINK HERE IT'S IN HERE ALREADY
IT'S NOTHING ABOUT S YEAH
BUT I IN THE PRESENTATION OF YOURS THERE WAS ALSO SOMETHING ABOUT DIFFERENT COMPONENTS
AH
AH YES IT WAS THE SECOND ONE
UH THIS IS N THIS IS NOT THIS N THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE
I DON'T OH
OR MAYBE SOMETHING IS UH MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING ABO IN IN THESE
YOU KNOW THAT A PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP BUT A SCROLL WHEEL IT IT ME REQUIRES OKAY SO WE ONLY NEED A SIMPLE CHIP
A SCROLL WHEEL IT S UH ONLY STATES THAT A SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRES A REGULAR CHIP AND THAT A DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP
I DON'T I DON'T SEE ANY POSSIBILITY TO DO SO BECAUSE IT WOULD WOULDN'T FIT OUR DEFI DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
BUT WHAT W IS THERE SOME EXTRA MAYBE I THINK MAYBE THE KINETIC THING IS SOMETHING
INSTEAD OF THE RECHARGEABLE THE RECHARGEABLE THING WAS SOMETHING TO UM KNOW SO Y SO PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR BATTERIES ANYMORE
MAYBE WE IF WE PUT THE KINETIC THING IN IT
THE UH IT'S MADE FOR S PEOPLE WELL THE THEY DON'T IF IT WAS UH UH R USELESS TECHNOLOGY THEY WOULDN'T PUT IT UH AS A POSSIBILITY
AND I IT IT TH TH THE THE TARGET THE TARGET UH GROUP ARE PEOPLE WHO ZAP REGULARLY AND THROW WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AS A MATTER OF SPEAKING
BECAUSE I THINK IT WHEN WHEN THERE W WAS A REMOTE CONTROL WHERE IT WAS USEFUL TO HAVE A KINETIC UH UH POWER SOURCE
BECAUSE IT'S ONE IT GETS THROWN AROUND THROWN AROUND A LOT AND IT GETS USED A LOT
YEAH WE CAN ALS OR UH ALSO M WE WE CAN MAKE ONE WE CAN STILL MAKE
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALISTIC FOR YOU TO DO SO
OH BECAUSE WE
WE WELL LOOK AT ALL THE SPECIAL STUFF WE HAVE
COLOUR A THE COLOURS ARE SPECIAL THE FORM IS SPECIAL
IT TH THIS IS WHOLE CONCEPT
UH NO
YEAH I DON MY SUGGESTION IS TO JUST FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE DOCKING STATION THING AND MAKE IT UH LIKE A
BECAUSE OF THE YOU KNOW IT G IT GIVES SOMETHING DYNAMIC TO THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH AND IT IS ALSO NOT A GOOD IT'S NOT YOU HAVE TO REALLY DO IT ONLY KINETIC YOU DON'T WANT IT TO THINK ABOUT BATTERIES ANYMORE
BECAU BE BUT A REMOTE CONTROL GETS WHY DO THEY STATE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED IF IT
YEAH M BUT A W UH UH N UH A CALCULATOR ALSO WORKS ON R ON SOLAR CELLS
WITH THE RUBBER PARTS AND UH STURDINESS OF THE THING AND Y WHEN YOU MOVE IT AROUND A LOT
OKAY THEN WE D OKAY WELL Y WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT BUT WHAT THAT WOULD JUST HAVE A LACK OF KEY FEATURES YOU KNOW
WE CAN REALLY CAN DO THE DOCKING THING UH IT'S NOT YEAH UH WE CAN DO IT BUT IT'S WOULD BE A EASY WAY OUT
OKAY BUT WE HAVE TO GROU TO AGREE UPON SOMETHING BECAUSE UH WE ONLY HAVE A MINUTE LEFT OR SO
OKAY W B WE CAN S WE CAN LEAVE IT ON BE WELL THEN THEN TH IT'S THIS IS THEN THEN OUR CONCEPT IS READY
I MEAN WE'RE GONNA IT'S GONNA EXCEL IN IN ON IN THE THE RANGE IN THE FIELD OF DESIGN AND AND UH LOOKS AND FEEL
YEAH AND I WOULD LI I WOULD HAVE LIKED A KINETIC PART AS WELL TO GIVE IT SOME
BUT UH IT'S IT'S AN THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT PUTTING TECHNOLOGIES ON THIS BUT IF IT IF IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
OKAY PROJECT E UH WELL WE WERE GONNA WHAT LOOK TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAST SHEET
IS UH
IS PRETTY UH OBVIOUS TO SEE ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL BUT
IT IS NECESSARY WHEN YOU WANT TO BUILD YOUR UH COMPANY F TO A LEVEL HIGHER
OUR INTERFACE ELEMENTS THERE ARE SHOWN IN THE IN THE DRAWING
BUT UH THAT IT'S UH HERE THEN IN THE MIDDLE
YES Y THERE THERE WILL BE A P A LITTLE A LITTLE P. ON THAT AND A LITTLE UH YEAH
UH TH WITH THE ONE AND A DOUBLE UH UH YES
NO NO BUT S
NO A REMOTE CAN
YES SO THEY NEED NO THEY NEED
UH REMOTE CONTROL SENDS ONE SIGNAL AT ONE BUTTON UH PRESS
N SOME TELEVISIONS WHEN WHEN YOU WANT TO GO FURTHER THAN UH TEN
WHEN YOU UH PRESS ONE BUTTON YOU GIVE ONE SIGNAL
JUST A BASIC IDEA OF OF OF THE MOST UH MOST Y
IT'S HERE ON THE
SO MAYBE WE CAN UH USE THE DOCKING STATION FOR EXAMPLE UH M. P. THREE PLAYERS OR OR UH
WHEN IT'S O THE SAME AS THE OTHER PRODUCTS YOU CAN PUT IT ALL ON THE SAME UH
WHEN WHEN THE THE RECHARGER HAS A HAS A BIT WHAT POINTS OUT WE CAN PLACE ALL ON TOP OF IT
NO WHEN YOU MAKE IT LARGE ENOUGH NO IT IT WILL NOT
BUT IT'S FLAT IT'S FLAT AS AS THIS SO WE CAN P MAKE ALL THE PRODUCTS AS FLAT AS THIS
THE F THE LOOK AND FEEL WOULD BE GREAT ON THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE UH YOU ALWAYS UH WILL UH PICK UP THE REMOTE CONTROL IN THE IN THE SMALLEST UH AREA
YES UH ON THE SIDE UH THERE WILL BE A STRIP OF RUBBER
BUT IT WILL ALSO UH UH USE BATTERIES AND DO WE WANT TO
YES MAYBE WE CAN USE ON THE ON THE LIGHTS ON THE SIDE WE CAN USE UH UH MULTIPLE UH LIGHTS SO IT WILL UH
I THINK I THINK THE THE FRONTS WILL GIVE IT A MORE UH UH UH LESS UGLIER UH SIDE
ALSO THE THE THE BUTTONS OF THE ONE THE TWO THE THE DIGITS O THEY'RE USED UH UH
WE WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE IT UH THE THE BEST TRENDY LOOK UH EVER
NO NOT L. C. D. SO
WITH THE LIGHTS IT IT'S IT'S KIND OF FUTURE
THE DOCKING STATION IS A IS A LITTLE BIT INNOVATIVE
TO PUT IT ON YOUR HEAD
IN IN AND COMPARING WITH UH PEOPLE OF TH OF THE AGE ABOVE
YES TWO BUT ONLY IN C WHEN YOU COMPARE IT WITH WITH ELDERLY
WHEN IT SUCCEEDS UH IT CAN GET A TWO MU
IS THERE SOMETHING AFTER THIS UH MEETING
UH IT'S IT'S ONE ONE CHIP BUT BUT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE FROM IT
THE SIMPLE CHIP IS E ENOUGH I I THINK BUT WITH THE LIGHTS WITH THE LIGHTS AND THE RETRIEVAL IT CAN BE UH
THE THE EMAIL I GOT SAID UH SIMPLE CHIP BUT WHEN WE PUT IN THE SPEAKER AND THE RETRIEVER UH DEVICE
BEC NO THE THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT A RETRIEVER OR A SPEAKER UH IN IT
YES I I I S I
I DON'T KNOW IT UH EITHER
ST
YOU CAN HAVE F FOUR KIND OF PUSH BUTTONS
WHY IS THAT SO UH EXPENSIVE
WHEN YOU HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF BUTTON YOU HAVE TO PUT IN WI IN YOUR CARTON
BOARD
BUT WHE
I'VE SEEN ONE UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL WITH ONLY THE PU YEAH ONLY WITH UH PAGE UP PAGE DOWN AND VOLUME BUT BUT
YES IT'S FOR IT'S LI UH IT'S JUST FOR A LITTLE
OH PLASTIC
BUT WHAT WE CAN SAY OF CAN UM ALMOST MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BUY A REMOTE CONTROL WITHOUT THE DOCKING STATION
FOR
IT ISN'T IN MY INFORMATION SO I DON'T KNOW IT UH EITHER
UH I'VE GOT HERE IN UH I WILL PUT A I WILL PUT A PAGE ON IT
AH I'VE GOT IT
AH OKAY
MAYBE YOU CAN SAY AGAINST THE REMOTE UH PAGE UH F UH PAGE UP PAGE DOWN
UH SOLAR CELLS ARE USELESS
FO FOR A DOCKING STATION
WITH A CABLE WITH UH BUTTONS ON IT WITH RETRIEVAL UH DEVICE IN IT
WI WITH A BUTTON TO
WI WITH A BUTTON TO RETRIEVE IT SO IT WILL BEEP
MAYBE WE CAN DO IT BOTH UH IN THE IN THE IN THE REMOTE
YOU ASKED FOR THREE D
NO THAT'S N THAT'S NOT TRUE
UH A WATCH IS UH KINETIC BECAUSE YOU WALK ALL THE TIME
THE CASE ALONE FOR UH REMOTE CONTROL IS AT LEAST ONE EURO
IS THIS IT
I DON'T UH HEAR A BELL
JUST FILL THAT ONE IN
UH THEN THE THE THE NINE UH CHANNELS
AND THEN WE HAD UH JUST UH TWO BUTTONS WE PLACE THEM IN THE MIDDLE UH THE MENU AND FOR THE TELETEXT I THOUGHT THAT WAS TH
OH THE MUTE BUTTON
WELL YEAH MO UH MO YEAH WELL MOST OF THEM ARE RIGHT HANDED
UH
IS IT DEPENDING ON TELEVISION
YOU UH YOU CAN WAI WHEN YOU PUSH THE ONE YOU CAN SHOW ON THE TELLY A ONE AND JUST A DASH
ACH
THE THE THERE'S NO FU THERE'S ONE THERE'S ONE BUTTON THAT'S WHA THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S ONE FUNCTION AND THAT'S N THE ONE BUTTON WHEN YOU WANT TO FIND IT
IT'S LEANING BACKWARDS I THINK IN THE IN THE DOCKING STATION
OKAY THREE
ONE
ONE
THREE
SHOOT
IS THAT ONE OR IS THAT NINE BUTTONS
IS IT CENTS THE THE THE FIFTY CENTS A BUTTON
YEAH THAT'S NO OPTION THAT'S NO OPTION
BUT WHA WHAT S WHAT SPECIAL
UH YEAH
SE NO NO NO
REGULAR CHIP AND BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE UH SPECIAL FUNCTIONS TO USE UH IN ADVANCED CHIP FOR EXAMPLE
IF WE DO I DO WE NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP OR IS IT OKAY F
DIED
N ON TOP
WAS IT WORKING DESIGN OR COMPONENTS DESIGN
YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S JUST THE SAME AS THE THE LED
WELL THAT'S NOT TOO WHAT WE WANT
CAN WE DO IT WI WITHIN TWO TWO EURO
WOW W WHY NO LI LOOK AT NOW WE GOT TWO
CA CAN'T WE MAKE A DOCKING STATION OF THAT
NO UH N NO
ALRIGHT AND UH YOU GOTTA POINT OUT WHICH IS THE VOLUME UM UH BUTTON AND WHICH IS THE PROGRAMME BUTTON
YEAH BUT YOU YOU GOTTA MAKE IT CLEAR ON THE ON
YEAH AND A AND A TRIANGLE ON THAT
ALL N NO THAT'S UM KINDA DEPENDENT ON THE TELEVISION
YES BUT UH UH NO UH REMOTE CONTROL NOWADAYS ARE UM THEY COME WITH THE TELEVISION
OR ACTUALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND
YEAH WELL BUT SU IF
LOOK IF UH I I
NO S SOME SOME TELEVISIONS NEED THE INPUT FIRST UH AND AND YOU C
UH
NO REMOTE CONTROL DOESN'T GIVE SIGNAL AFTER FIVE SECONDS
WELL IT IT GOT IT IT HAS GOT TO FIT INTO THE SHAPE OF COURSE
BUT UH I IF YOU ALL MAKE THE M HAVING A BOTTOM LIKE THIS THEN THEY ALL FIT
YES BUT UH I I G
NO BUT IF IF LIKE THIS I'LL I'LL POINT IT OUT
IF YOU GOT UH A A A BASE A BASE LIKE THIS I WON'T DRAW IT REALLY
IF YOU GOT A BASE WHICH IS UH AS BIG AS THIS
YEAH SURE BUT IF YOU GOT IF YOU GOT A TINY PLAYER IT CAN
UH YOU COULD MAKE LIKE A HOLE IN IT YOU KNOW OF UH IN IN THE
UH IN THE SAME COLOUR AS THE SIDE
WE GOTTA DO THAT ON THE RIGHT THE MOST RIGHT MOST SCREEN BECAUSE THE LEFTMOST
I WILL BE NEEDING THAT IMAGE SO LEAVE IT PLEASE
UM WE G THE FOUR OF US ARE GOING TO DO THAT UM TOGETHER
THE POSITIVE THINGS HAS TO BE ON THE LEFT SO I SAID NOT UGLY INSTEAD OF UGLY
UH WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WE WE GOTTA GIVE POINTS TO UH TO ALL OF THESE TO EVALUATE UH THAT DESIGN
NO NOT NOT FRONTS BUT DIFFERENT DESIGNS
AND THAT'S STILL UH UH YEAH IS IS UH IS A LITTLE PERSONAL TOUCH I GUESS
YEAH WHA WHA WHAT WOULD YOU UH GUYS UH THINK
GUIDO
THREE IS UH A BIT UH OH WHAT AM I DOING
THE REMOTE CONTROL'S UH UH THAT N MAKES UH ZAPPING EASY
AND OUR OH YEAH IT'S A B YEAH
THE THE YEAH M WELL YOU D YOU'VE GOT A POINT
NAY THAT THAT THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE
WE PUT IT ON A TWO
MAARTEN
EVER YEAH
GUIDO
I WAS PLANNING TO GIVE IT A TWO UH WHERE I GIVE THE NOT UGLY UH OH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
WELL I G
UH I AGREE M BUT
I THINK MORE M
UH THAT THAT'S N
THAT M F YEAH FOR THE RETRIEVAL FUNCTION
YEAH SURE BUT
I FOUND TWELVE QUESTIONS SO MUCH BUT IT STILL IS TEN
RIGHT THE REM
THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS RECOGNISABLE CORPORATE IMAGE COLOUR LOGO OR SLOGAN
OH THE SLOGAN
CAN WE SEE THE SLOGAN
THREE
WE GOTTA ADD UP THE SCORES NOW TO SEE OUR TOTAL AVERAGE
UM IS THIS YOUR
WE PROBABLY WILL
I HAVEN'T GOT AN IDEA ON ON WHICH WE NEED TO USE REALLY
I MEAN YOU GOT THAT EMAIL
ALRIGHT WELL POINT OUT THE ADVANCED CHIP FOR NOW I GUESS
TO N THAT'S TOTAL OF FOUR BUTTONS
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SI
IS IT
I THINK SO TOO
OH I DON'T KNOW
IT WOULD BE NICE TOO I MEAN UH WE'RE NOT GONNA ADD UH A TRIP TO HAWAII TO IT
WI WI WITHOUT RECHARGE
YEAH BUT BUT WE CAN MAKE A DOCKING STATION FOR TWO EUROS UH IF YOU DON'T PUT THE RECHARGE FUNCTION IN IT
DEAD
OH WHATEVER
IT'S UH AT YOUR TASK BAR
A DISPLAY UH IS OF COURSE UH FOR SHOWING LETTERS
YEAH I GUESS SO TOO
M BU
YEAH BUT BUT IF WE CA
THE POWER DEVICE IS IS I I IS VERY CHEAP
THEN YOU MAKE AS MUCH PROFIT AS YOU WOULD WITH TWELVE AND A HALF PRODUCTION COSTS
YO
OW
UH
UH
UH BUT UH I'LL OPEN IT ON THE SMARTBOARD SO WE CAN ALL SEE IT
SO UH I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER SO I HAD TO FILL IT IN AND UH HMM
AND AN UH A NICE AGENDA
THE TOOLS WE HAVE HERE SO THAT WE CAN ALL USE THEM
AND THEN WE CAN UH INDIVIDUALLY UH DO OUR THINGS AND THEN UH WE'LL GET BACK HERE
UM WE WANT IT TO BE ORIGINAL SO A NICE UH A NICE NEW DESIGN
OTHER UH
THAT'S JUST IT
UM WELL AS I JUST SHOWED THERE'S A PROJECT MANAGEMENT FOLDER A PROJECT DOCUMENT FOLDER ON THE DESKTOP
YOU JUST UH CLICK ON THE ON THE FOLDER AND YOU OPEN THE EVERYTHING YOU YOU PUT IN IT WITH YOUR LAPTOP
UM AND THE W THE R UH THE REST UH ALSO WORKS THE SAME SO UH WHEN YOU OPEN A NOTEPAD YOU UH YOU JUST GET YOUR UH THINGS
YOU HAVE A THESE
YOU CAN SEE THEM THERE
OF COURSE W DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE
PAINT
SO IT'S GONE
WE GOING TO TRY IT
YES OUR YOUR FAVOURITE
SO UM I'M TO GOING TO HAVE TO DRAW A KANGAROO BUT I'M GOING D I'M NOT GOING TO
I'M JUST UH GOING TO UH WELL DRAW A NICE UH
OH UM DOESN'T OH
AH THE FIRST THE FIRST MEETING IS JUST A BIT UH LOOSE LOOSEN UP A BIT UH MEETING EACH OTHER WELL UH UH NICE YEAH
NO SO A A FEW LEGS
I DIDN'T KNEW IT MYSELF
OH UH BUT THIS UH MARKETING DESIGNER
YEAH WELL WE HAVE TO SAVE EVERYTHING SO NOW UM THE NEXT ONE UH
AND THEN SAVE IT AND START AN BLANK DOCUMENT
WELL PEN WIDTHS UH THE LINE THE THE THICKNESS THICKNESS
SO UM WELL YOU SHOULD UH TRY IT BUT UH
IS IT A DUCK
IS IT A PLANE
IT DOESN'T DRAW UH CIRCLES UH THAT EASY UH
UH WILL UH CHOOSE A NEW COLOUR AND A NEW PEN WIDTH SO W WE CAN ALL SEE IT
IT'S NOT LIKE IN PAINT
JUST A WA THAT'S THE WAY WE DO IT'S QUITE EASY
SO THAT'S UH WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE WHEN WE UH NEED IT
WELL THEN UH THE SERIOUS UH STUFF
WE'RE WE WANT TO SELL IT AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS INTERNATIONALLY UM SO UM BUT WE DUNNO WHAT EXACTLY TH I IT IS IN DOLLARS
KEEP UH THAT IN MIND WHEN WE UH TALK ABOUT OUR UH MATERIALS AN F AND STUFF AND UH MARKETING UH RESEARCH
FIRST ABOUT DESIGN UH ABOUT UH AIM IN THE MARKET
WELL UH JUST W WE'RE UH FOUR UH IF WE IF WE WOULD JUST HAVE ONE THEN
YES FIFTY MILLION IS OUR AIM TO A PROFIT SO
YEP AND MAYBE WE DO UH WE EVEN HAVE UH MORE THAN JUST A D. V. D. PLAYER
DON'T WE HAVE UH OTHER UH OU
UH
YEAH BECAUSE WE LOOK AT COMPETITORS AND W IF WE PICK UP THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THAT AND GIVE IT A NICE DESIGN
N WE CAN USE UH IT AS A AS A GAME PAD
SO ONE HAND HAS THE BEER SO THE OTHER HAND UH
WELL THERE HAS BEEN DONE A LOT OF RESEARCHES ABOUT REMOTES UH WE HAVE TO WE CAN IMAGINE UH BECAUSE IT'S A LONG TIME UH ON THE MARKET
SO THE THE FORM WILL HAVE BEEN UH TESTED OUT SO
WELL FOR ME PERSONALLY I HAVE A A LOT OF REMOTES UH AT HOME BUT THOSE ONES THAT HAVE A A ROUND ENDING AND UH WELL UH JUST AN UH SQUARE UH MIDDLE I DON'T LIKE TO USE THEM
IT F IT FITS YOUR HANDS AND THEN YOU JUST PUSH THE BUTTON THAT YOU USE MOST WITH THUMB
THO THO THOSE NEW D. V. D. PLAYERS ON THE MARKET DO HAVE THOSE
A IT H IT HAS IT IT HAS A THAT'S THA TH TH SHAPE THAT IT FITS YOUR HAND
HA
THIS IS ABOUT UH WHAT WE ARE GOING TO UH DO UH
YOU'LL GET SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WHEN YOU'RE BACK IN YOUR ROOM SO UH IT'S UH LOGICAL UH
OH AND UH THAT'S UH THAT'S ALL
SO WE'LL JUST GET A NOTICE THAT THE THE MEETING IS UH OVER
WELL I HAVE HAD REMOTES THAT UM THEY HAD UH THE FUNCTION OF THE BUTTONS WAS ABOUT UH UH A LAYER OVER THE BUTTONS AND WHEN I'VE HAD USE IT MUCH IT WAS GONE
IT HAS TO UH NOT BE LOOSE
IS THERE AN A UNIVERSAL UH UNIVERSAL WAY OF UM TRANSMITTING FROM THE REMOTE TO THE TELEVISION SO IT'S ALL ABOUT UH
BUT Y YOU CAN HAVE UH OF COURSE DIFFERENT BETWEEN D. V. D. S AND TELEVISIONS AND BETWEEN
WELL I THINK UH W WE CAN LOOK INTO THAT IN THE IN THE NEXT UH THIRTY MINUTES
WELL J JUST Y YOU GET A N A NORMAL FRONT WITH IT BUT YOU CAN CHANGE THEM UH WHEN YOU BUY THE
AND WE SHOULD UH DISPATCH THOSE KIND OF FRONTS FRONTS A A AROUND THE WORLD SO UH
YEAH WELL IT HAS TO IT H IT HAS TO FIT THE THE TE TELEVISION AND D. V. D. SET WE ARE GOING TO SELL
BUT UH PROBABLY ABOUT UH THE PRECISION OF THE BUTTONS AND AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND WHAT BUTTONS WILL HAVE TO BE ON THE
AND YOU WILL LOOK INTO THE TECHNICAL DESIGN AND UM FORM I THINK
EURO
OH RIGHT OH
MA
YEAH SEE YOU
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY TO WRITE ON THE ON THE BIG WHITE UH DOES IT
OH I KNOW IT
BUT WE HAVE UH DO WE HAVE TO NAME THE SPECIFIC SPECIES OF THE BIRD
I LIKE UH OH THEY DON'T HAVE PINK
OH B OH THINK THIS IS UH
UH
UH
UH
OH THE LINE WIDTH IS TOO THICK BUT OH WELL
UH
UH ONE
UH YEAH UH BLANK
I FEEL TOTALLY AT EASE
AND STEREO UH S UH AUDIO INSTALLATIONS
I THOUGHT ABOUT UH LIKE MOST UH REMOTE CONTROLS UH ARE UH A LONG BOX SHAPED THING YOU CAN MAKE IT UH TRIANGLE SHAPED
OVAL
OH BUT IT HA IT HAS TO BE M YEAH
OR ELSE UH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ANO ANOTHER SHAPE
YEAH A LO THE LONG BOX SHAPE YEAH
W NO W WHAT ELSE
I DI
IT IT HAS ROUND FORMS BUT IT IN THE END IT'S STILL THE BOX SO THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
BUT IN IN IN AT THE END IT'S STILL THIS LONG
THE BUTTONS SHOULD UH ALSO BE NOT TOO SMALL NOT TOO BIG OF COURSE AND UH N UH UH NOT TOO CLOSE UH TOGETHER
I THINK WE HAVE TO TALK ALSO ABOUT UH THE THE MATERIALS FOR UM
ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING THA
NO N N
IT IT'S A WE WE MAKE AN A UNIVERSAL REMOTE SO IT HA HAS TO WORK WITH UH ALL KINDS OF BRANDS AND THINGS
AND HAVE WELL YEAH I'VE WROTE SOMETHING DOWN ABOUT HOW IT WORKS
WELL BUT TH BUT THE STANDARD FRONT WILL BE UH JUST GREY OR SOMETHING UH B A SIMPLE COLOUR NOT NOT VERY FLASHY
YEAH I UH W WAS WONDERING THAT TOO
Y YOU WENT TO THE COMPANY WEBSITE
RIGHT SEE YOU IN HALF AN HOUR THEN
RIGHT UH SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES THEN
HI THERE
UH NO I DON'T
YEAH WE SHOULD MAKE IT COMPATIBLE PERHAPS WITH EVERYTHING WE USE WE UH WE MAKE
W WELL IT'S A N IT'S A NEW REMOTE AND YOU DON'T BUY A REMOTE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO UH TO CONTROL WITH IT
WELL YEAH IT'S NEW
NO IF Y IF YOU LOOK AT NEW PHILLIPS UH D. V. D. WITH THEIR UH REMOTES PL PLAYERS THEY THEY ARE THE NEW REMOTES AREN'T BOX SHAPED
YEAH YEA
YEAH MAYBE WE CAN UM JUST LIKE ON CELL PHONES THOSE UM WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN PUT ON ON THEM
AND SO YOU CAN CUSTOMISE YOUR UH YOUR OWN REMOTE WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS OR OR SPECIAL PAINT JOBS I DUNNO BUT
NO A COLOUR EVERYONE ACCEPTS
WELL YOUNG PEOPLE S LI
OH OH RIGHT OH WELL I DIDN'T UH USE IT
NEXT MEETING IS IN
S
YES UH RIGHT
YOU'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF IT I CAN'T SEE IT
IT'S A PIG
I THINK IT'S IM IT'S IMPORTANT TO UH LOOK AT UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS OF OUR COMPETITORS
GET THE GOOD POINTS UH TRY TO MERGE THEM INTO ONE UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL
ON OUR CORPORATE SITE I SAW UH A NEW D. V. D. PLAYER UH WE'RE GONNA PRODUCE
SO YOU CAN UH USE YOUR TELEVISION AND YOUR D. V. D. PLAYER WITH THE SAME UH REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH YEAH SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT
WE NEED TO TO KEEP IT CONSISTENT WITH OTHER D UH
I CAN IMAGINE THAT US
RIGHT MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THIS OR AND THEN A BUTTON HERE TO SWITCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS LIKE D. V. D. PLAYER AND SO YOU CAN I'VE
BUT IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO TO UM MAKE IT
AND YOU CAN USE
ARE WE GOING W UH WITH THE FRONT UH FRONTS UH IDEA
WELL I'LL UH START JUST WITH ANOTHER PRESENTATION SO THEN WE CAN UH LOOK AT TH AT THE AGENDA UH FOR THIS MEETING
I'VE PUT SOME UH NEW THINGS IN THE IN THE MAP
UH OH
I DON'T KNOW THE SHORTCUT SO AH F. FIVE
WELL OUR FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING THAT'S THE STAGE WE'RE IN
AND YOU ALSO HA ALL THREE OF YOU HAVE UH PREPARED SOMETHING ABOUT IT
WELL UM IN WE'LL UH JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE AT THE NOTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING WHAT WE UH THOUGHT WE HAD DEC DECIDED
UH THEN WE'LL UH LOOK AT UH THE THREE UH PRESENTATIONS UH FROM YOU
I THINK YOU HAVE PREPARED UH ALL THREE UH
UM WE'LL LOOK AT TH THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS WE UH I DUNNO
Y YOU ALSO HAVE UH RECEIVED THAT MAIL THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS FROM OUR BOSSES
AND I'LL HAVE A LOOK IF WELL I THINK WE SHOULD SHOW THEM BEFORE YOUR PRESENTATIONS BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY UH
WE HAVE TO DEB WE HAVE TO DECIDE IT IN THIS MEETING WHAT OUR FUNCTION WILL BE
UH
UH YEAH I THINK SO
I GAVE A DISC A A PRESENTATION
UH NOT TOO MANY ONE BUTTONS
ONE RECOGNISABLE BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE WHERE YOU DO THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS WITH
YEAH WELL THAT WA IT'S JUST THIRTY MINUTES AGO SO IT'S NOT QUITE UH BUT WELL I HAVE TO DO IT
THE MATERIALS UH WELL SHOULD BE HARD PLASTIC WITH RUBBER FROM AND UH WELL THE LABELLING OF THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE INDESTRUCTIBLE
I GOT THIS MAIL
MAYBE A NEW SORT OF THING BUT N BUT NOT TELETEXT
SH PITY BECAUSE WE JUST SAID WE WANTED TO D INCLUDE THE D. V. D. AND THEY DON'T WANT IT BECAUSE OF OUR TIME WE HAVE FOR THIS PROJECT
BECAUSE UH WE DON'T HAVE THOSE CUSTOMERS A LOT AT TH AT THIS POINT
UM WELL IT'S A BIT PITY BECAUSE IT'S JUST THOSE PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL FOR ALL THOSE TECHNICAL DEVICES THEY CAN UH REACH IT
SO UH WE HAVE TO UH USE UH MAYBE A SLOGAN MAYBE A COLOUR
AND UM YEAH WELL UH ON OUR REMOTE CONTROLS THE DESIGN HAS TO BE UH WELL AS WE ALREADY SAID A ACTUALLY UH FAMILIAR
SO MAYBE THAT'S A SLOGAN WE CAN PUT UH SOMEWHERE ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL OR SOMETHING
OH YOU HAVE TO START
WELL S THEN START
SO IF YOU DELIVER A SMALL UH CLICK ON DEVICE THAT YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR TELEVISION THAT BLEEPS TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL EVERYONE CAN USE IT
NO YOU CAN CLICK IT ON YOUR TELEVISION
WELL THERE SH SHOULD ALWAYS BE A MENU BUT IT C CAN BE VERY SHORT
WELL WE ARE A DESIGN TEAM WE CAN SAY TO SOME UH WRITER UH MAKE A MANUAL POINT
WELL YEAH WELL UH IT'S YOUR YOUR TASK TO UH LOOK INTO THE COSTS UH OF THOSE UH NIGH I KNOW
IT'S NOT YET A STANDARD UH DEVELOPMENT UH THOSE SO
WELL YOU I C I CAN UH STILL SEE YOUR PRESENTATION
YOU UH GOT UH
YIP
BUT IF Y IF YOU WOULD PUT IT AT A DIFFERENT PLACE THEN YOU HAVE TO MOVE YOUR HANDS AND THAT'S ON OF THE THINGS ABOUT R. S. I.
YES I'VE SAW THAT ON M ON MI MOBILE TELEPHONES THEY ALSO HAVE UH THOSE BUTTONS
IF SOMEONE PUTS UP I UH PICKS UP HIS REMOTE AND HE PICKS UP IT HE HE TOUCHES THE SIDE THEN HE'S A ALREADY ON THE NEXT CHANNEL
OH RIGHT NO
HOW LATE IS DID WE START HIS PRESENTATION UH
UH
NO BUT THAT'S TH THE SIDE THEY LOOK UH LOOK AT IS THE FRONT
SO IF Y IF YOU MAKE A A FRONT WITH JUST A A TIGER ON IT THEN UH OUR RECOGNITION IS TOTALLY GONE
OR THE TH THE THE LOWEST PART OF THE REMOTE ISN'T CHANGED BY THE FRONT
THOSE KIND OF THINGS
WELL WHAT IF WE UM I AT I AT HOME HAVE A REMOTE THAT HAS UM THE MOST FAMILIAR UH BUTTONS ON THE TOP
A F A LITTLE UH YOU CAN CLICK AWAY AND THEN YOU HAVE F MUCH MORE FUNCTIONS THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T USE BUT S SOME DO DO
WELL BUT BECAUSE YOU SAY THEY THEIR FEATURES ARE IMPORTANT THEY WANT M UM A LOT BUT NOT
WELL MAYBE W WE COULD UH S ON UM SOME UH CALCULATORS YOU HAVE LO THOSE LITTLE LITTLE L. C. D. TH THAT YOU CAN CLICK ON OR SOMETHING
OR THAT YOU CAN CLICK UH OUT UH OF THE REMOTE
THOSE KIND OF THINGS UH BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE THOSE UH THOSE PROGRAM RECOGNITION FOR YOUR V. V. C. R. S
AND UH WELL IF Y IF YOUR REMOTE PICKS THAT UP ALSO YOU THEY CAN DISPLAY WHICH PROGRAMME YOU'RE CURRENTLY WATCHING
IT IT COULD BE SUCH A LITTLE UH TH THAT YOU CAN CLICK IN AND OUT AND YOU AND YOU HAVE IT
WELL I THINK IT'S YOU GOT IT JUST MEANS IT'S A SCRIPT THAT'S UH KEEPS IT UH ROLLING
UH WE CAN PUT SOME UM DECISIONS ABOUT UM THE CONTROLS WE WANT TH THE ISSUE
UH
UH
THESE I'VE ALREADY GIVEN YOU
UH
BECAUSE UM WHEN WHEN UH WHEN I USE A REMOTE I L I HATE THE BUTTONS BUT BUTTONS AT THE AT THE BOTTOM
ON THE TOP
WE WANT TO LOOK IT LIKE OUR ORIGINAL BUT FAMILIAR
YEA
MAYBE A BIC UH BETTER UH WHITE UH WE WHITE
UH FORMAT YEAH FORMAT
UH
I H LOVE THAT ONE
WELL H HO
APART
BECAUSE I HAVE SOMEONE BUT THE BUTTONS IS WAY
THE POWER BUTTON CAN UH BE UH UH
UM HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT WITH THOSE NUMBERS
WELL I HAVE IT HERE
YEAH WELL THAT'S GOING TO TAKE TOO TOO MUCH TIME
SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO GO TO MIKE
PLUS THE D TH THE DESIGN ROUND IS STILL TO COME HUH
THE NUMBER F WELL YES THAT'S ALRIGHT
HOW DO YOU WANT IT TO DO THEN
IT IT HAS TO R RECOGNISE ONE AS THERE COULD STILL COME MORE
ALRIGHT SO NO BUTTON FOR THAT
OKAY UH ANYONE ANY UH OTH OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES OF OUR UH REMOTE
UM WELL BECAUSE WE CAN'T INTEGRATE IT WITH ANY OTHER UH REMOTES ALL THOSE BUTTONS ON THOSE PICTURES ARE UH IRRELEVANT
SO JUST FOR A TELEVISION IS THAT ALL WE NEED
TELETEXT IS GONE
SO ALL THOSE BUTTONS THAT AR ARE TO DO WITH TELETEXT OH SCREEN PLACING
WE'LL HAVE UH THOSE UH BUTTONS ABOUT UH
THOSE TWO
WELL I THINK THEY SHOULD IN AN IN AN ISOLATED PART OF THE REMOTE
GO TO VIDEO THAT'S ALWAYS ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
TO A. V. UH TO A. V. A. V. A. V.
WELL L N NO NOT AT NOT AT MY REMOTE
YEAH I I THINK THAT ONE BUTTON IS UH I USE IT UH
THESE BUTTONS I DON'T HAVE BUTTONS FOR CHANNEL SETTING UH ESPECIALLY ON MY REMOTE
IT'S IT'S INCORPORATED WITH P M PLUS AND DOWN UH THOSE
SO WE STILL HAVE ONE UH FOUR
OH THE OKAY BUTTON
OH YOU ALWAYS HAVE IN THE CENTRE AN OKAY BUTTON FOR YOUR MENU
YES SEE
WE'RE GOING TO UH GO TO OUR UH ROOMS AND UH WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE S THINGS ON OUR OWN I THINK
WELL SEE YOU UH W W WE HAVE LUNCHTIME BY THE WAY NOW UH SO UH
AH
I I DISAGREE BUT UH IT'S NOT UH T IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO DISAGREE I GUESS
I READ UH I READ IT ON THE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT COMPANY WE WERE BUT WE WE DESIGN UH ESPECIALLY TRENDY UH TRENDY TRENDY STUFF
UH
WELL MAYBE FOR THE IF YOU DON'T RECOGNISE A BUTTON WHO D WHO D WHO DO I CALL UH WH WHEN I DON'T KNOW IT
CONSIDER THE M
WELL WE'LL CONSIDER BOTH AND AND SEE WHAT UH WHAT WHAT WE CAN FIND I THINK
WE DON'T RULE THEM OUT UH YET
WELL UH IT IS MY TASK TO UH EXPLAIN UH OR TO POINT OUT A WORKING DESIGN
OKAY HOW DO YOU ENLARGE IT SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE F. F. FIVE
WELL ALRIGHT UH YOU KNOW WHO I AM AND WHAT I DO
IT WAS ORIGINALLY IN BLACK AND WHITE BUT IT BECAME BLACK AND PURPLE
UH WELL YOU CAN SEE UH
W WHICH IS THE LED THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE BULB THAT SENDS THE THE INFRARED BEAM TO THE NO TO THE SET
AND THE THE USER INTERFACE SENDS UH THE THE DIFFERENT SIGNALS OF THE DIFFERENT BUTTONS TO THE CHIP
AND THE CHIP UH SENDS IT TO THE LED AND THE LED SENDS IT TO THE RECEIVER
UH THE REMOTE UH IS BASICALLY JUST WAITING FOR A USER TO PRESS A KEY
UH AND RECOGNISE THE KEY
SO WELL YOU UNDERSTAND
AND IT USES TRANSISTORS IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL TO AMPLIFY AND TO SEND UH THAT SIGNAL AGAIN TO THE TO THE LED
AH BU YEAH BUT WE DON'T
AND UH IF WE IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD AN UH AN UH L. C. D. SCREEN TO IT IT UH WON'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THIS BUT
IT HAS UH VERY LITTLE BUTTONS AND BUT IT IT UH IT'S IT'S QUITE UM YEAH YOU CAN EASILY RECOGNISE THE BUTTONS
THEY'RE UH FAR ENOUGH APART AND AN ANYTHING
AND THAT UH PROBLEMS LIKE UH R. S. I. AND UH THOSE KINDS OF THING DON'T DON'T OC DON'T OCCUR
WELL YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY UH EVERY BUTTON UNDER THE THUMB OF COURSE
BUT IN E IN ANY CASE THE THE BASIC FUNCTION SHOULD BE UH INDEED AND AS YOU SAY AT THE THUMB
UH THE NUMBERS ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE AS WELL SHOULD BE UH YEAH WELL NOT IN REACH BECAUSE UH THEY DON'T USE IT UH ALL THE TIME
WELL IT'S UH PRETTY PRETTY BASICALLY UH AS YOU SAID
SO YEAH EXACTLY THIS IS UH HOW IT UH LOOKS FROM THE INSIDE
OH I HAD TO DELETE THIS BUT I HAD TO MAKE A SCHEMATIC UH OF THE OF THE NEW BUT I HAD TOO TOO LITTLE TIME
UH
YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE UH THE DIFFER FROM DIFFERENT SIDES
WE CAN PUT IT ON THE ON THE BACK SIDE
MIKE UH CAN YOU PUT UH THAT PICTURE FROM ME ON THE IN THE WORD DOCUMENTS FILE
IN MAP
I THINK UH THE MOST FUNCTIONS UH UNDERNEATH THAT UH UH NO UM MM USUALLY
UH
UH BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE TO S CHANNEL TWO YOU HAVE TWO ON THE SCREEN AND TWO ON YOUR ON YOUR UM ON YOUR L. C. D. SCREEN
UH
I DUNNO WHAT UH YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT
WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S BETTER AT THE BOTTOM
I THINK IT'S STILL IMPORTANT TO HAVE IT AT THE TOP BECAUSE IT'S UH
YOU E YOU ONLY HAVE ONE PEN FOR THAT SCREEN
UH YEAH WE SHOULD UH SUMMON THE THE DIFFERENT UH ASPECTS OF THE THING
UH
BUT TH TH ON THIS REMOTE TH THESE CONTROLS ARE FOR SOMETHING ELSE A D. V. D. PLAYER OR SOMETHING
YEAH IT'S IT'S ALSO NOT GOOD TO COMPLETELY STAY IN ONE POSITION CONSTANTLY WITH ONE HAND
NO BUT NOW Y W WOULD WE HAVE TO CHOOSE A
FAR APART
WELL UH YEAH I I STILL THINK IT'S IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT THOUGH TO UH TO HAVE IT AT THE TOP SO YEAH
AS WE WE WE WE AGREED WE DO HAVE A L. C. D.
OH LIKE THAT
UH THAT'S THAT'S TOO COMPLICATED
YOU CAN JUST PUT IT SOMEWHERE THEY THEY AREN'T USED MUCH NOT AS MUCH AS THOSE OTHER SO YOU CAN PUT IT SOMEWHERE
YEAH S BIT SMALLER AND S WELL UH AND AND I THINK MORE AT THE BOTTOM
WHAT DO YOU THINK UH THOSE THOSE BUTTONS
AND W WHERE
WE HAVE IT AND WE DESIGN LATER WHERE EVERYTHING GOES
BUT IT'S EASY TO GO IF YOU ARE AT UH AT CHANNEL UH FIFTY FIVE AND YOU WANT TO UH GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE VIDEO CHANNEL
YOU DO YOU HAVE TO PUSH A TO TO GET BELOW ZERO
YEAH WELL UH D DIFFERENT SCREEN SETTINGS A YEAH SK YEAH Y YOU YOU YOU YOU HAVE SCREEN WIDTH
YEAH TO UH OH YEAH OF COURSE TO CONFIGURE THE PROGRAMME THE YEAH
TH THE MENU MENU BUTTON IS ALSO IMPORTANT
I DON'T SEE IT
OH MENU ALRIGHT
SEE YOU LATER MATE
YES YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND AND AND KNOW HOW IT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK
NO AND WE HAVE CUSTOMERS IN MULTIPLE UH COUNTRIES I THINK
OH YOU GO
ARE SOME OF THE THE THE UM
LIKE SOME UH LITTLE UH GAMEBOY THINGS OR SOME HMM
WELL I THOUGHT UM EVERYBODY ON THE WEBSITE UH WOULD SEE THE SAME THING BUT
FOR INSTANCE YOU COULDN'T SEE THIS
I USED MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTES TOOK A GOOD L LOOK UH AT THE REMOTES ON THE CORPORATE WEBSITE WHICH ARE THESE TWO
UH SO I THOUGHT WE WE WE WOULD USE MORE OR NEED MORE BUTTONS THAN THIS ONE
I UM I KINDA LIKE THE SHAPE
SO L LIKE ERICSSON DOES EVERY UH
S SOMETHING LIKE THIS
YEAH WE SHOULD KEEP THAT SIMPLE TOO
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE ON UM SOME RADIOS IN CAR
WA YEAH
YEAH Y YOU GOTTA ZAP LIKE THIS OR YOU WANT TO YEAH
IN A FEW MINUTES OH YEAH OH YEAH I TOTALLY AGREE
FOR ALL OF US I THINK
I THINK WE WE SHOULD USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS UM TO UM
AND AND A VOLUME CONTROL ALSO IN IT
YES AS I ALREADY SAID WE COULD DROP SOME OF THESE BUTTONS
I THINK THESE SHOULD BE IN ONE BIG CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE
YEAH BUT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN THEIR BUTTONS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE
THE OTHER THE OTHER TWO UH FRUSTRATIONS ARE FAR MORE IMPORTANT
NO IF YOU ON MOST T. V. S IF YOU UH PRESS TWO NUMBERS SHORTLY AFTER EACH OTHER D IT YEAH
OR AT YEAH ALRIGHT THEN
OH THEY CAN BE SMALL OR ROUND LIKE BUTTONS
YES I THINK TH
I THINK GO TO VIDEO IS
AN IRRELEVANT BUTTON BUT
YEAH YOU YEAH YOU HAVE ONE ONE BUTTON FROM S SET FREQUENCY O OR SOMETHING AND THEN WITH PLUS AND MIN MINUS YOU CAN UH ADJUST THE UH
I THOUGHT WE'D UH LUNCH UH RIGHT NOW OR NOT
I I JUST HAVE TO UH TO THINK WHICH FILE'S MINE 'CAUSE I WAS UH BIT IN A HURRY
S
UH FURTHERMORE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHAT THEY DO LIKE AND WHAT THEY DO USE
SO WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THOSE THREE THING THREE THINGS
AND IN THE END I'LL UM SHOW YOU OUR TARGET AUDIENCE OR OUR TARGET PRODUCT USERS CUSTOMERS
THEY DON'T LIKE IT SO WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT FRONTS IN THAT SECTION
UH ALMOST EVERY USER USES IT D THE THE CONTROL FOR JUST TEN PER CENT OF ITS CAPACITY
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE THE BUTTONS FOR THE COMMON UH TASKS KIND OF BIG OR KIND OF UH FLASHY
THUS IT MIGHT BE UH MIGHT BE SMART TO MAKE A A BIG UH ZAPPING BUTTON OR SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE SO YOU CAN REACH IT WITH YOUR THUMB
A LOT OF LOSERS UM USERS LOSE THEIR CONTROLS IN THEIR IN THEIR LIVING ROOM
YEAH BUT IF SOMEONE D SOMEBODY ELSE USES IT IN ANO OTHER ROOM OR SOMETHING
NEE BUT IT IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS IT'S UH THE THE CONTROL IS LOST IN THE SAME ROOM
WELL A BEEPING DEVICE WOULD BE UH FURTHERMORE THE LEARNING TIME IS A PROBLEM
UH THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR PER CENT UM THINKS IT'S IT'S TOO UH TOO DIFFICULT TO LEARN
I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT MORE TIME IN THE IN THE DESIGN OF UH PICK UP AND USE THAN A MANUAL
SO YOU CAN PICK UP AND USE IT THAN I THINK
UM WE'RE LIKE THE REQUIREMENTS SAID WE'RE GONNA SPECIFY OF WE'RE GONNA TARGET A YOUNGER AUDIENCE
UM RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THEY LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE L. C. D. SCREEN ON THEIR ON THEIR UH ZAPPING UH DEVICE
UH
SO IF WE WANT TO S IF WE HAVE A BIG
IT IT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT FOR THE SALE
UM I HAVE A TABLE HERE ABOUT UH THE L THE RELEVANCE OF THE BUTTONS
WELL TELETEXT IS NOT AN OPTION SO THAT UH BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE UM THE POWER
CHANNEL AND VOLUME BUTTONS UH NEAR TO THE THUMB SO YOU CAN'T HAVE R. S. I. UH CONSEQUENCES
IT'S A F IT'S A NEW FEATURE YOU CAN MAKE MAKE A DOUBLE FEATURE L LIKE A BUTTON ON THE TOP AND UNDER IT
ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AGO
THESE ARE ALREADY IN USE
YEAH THAT'S A MUST
UM THERE ARE TWO TARGET AUDI AUDIENCES AND WE'VE UH CHOSE FOR THE YOUNGER ONE
THEY ARE HIGH HIGH INTERESTED IN FEATURE
FO YEAH CRITICAL
SO WE MUST UM MUST DESIGN UH A CONTROL THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE PEOPLE
THE NEWEST FEATURES ARE LIKE I SAID ARE UH L. C. D. AND UH SPEECH UH CONTROL
OUR AUDIENCE THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY LIKE THESE UH FEATURES
SO WE MUST BUILD IN SOMETHING OR THEY WILL TO UH GO TO THE CONCURRENT
YEAH JUST AT AT THE TOP
SO WHEN YOU S YOU SIT LIKE THIS YOU CAN CAN WATCH
WHEN YOU S HOW DO YOU ZAP
YOU JUST SIT IN YOUR CHAIR
HE THINKS IT'S BETTER TO PUT THE L. C. D. AT THE BOTTOM AND I THINK IT'S BETTER AT THE TOP
THE THE TICKER THE L. C. D. IS LIKE LIKE SMALL
WHEN I DRAW HERE IT OH
AT THE BOT
ALRIGHT LET'S KEEP IT CENTRAL
WAS T KINDA TRUE
THE MOST USED BUTTONS YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING ALL THE TIME AND THAT'S JUST WHAT R. S. I. 'S ALL ABOUT
FREQUENCY OF UH BUTTON USE
UM CHANNELS ARE UH MOST UH IS MOST USED WITHIN THE HOUR
SO THE THE CHANNEL UH CHANNEL BUTTONS SHOULD BE FAR FAR APART I THINK UP AND DOWN
Y LOOK AT UH LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY
NEI NOT TOO MUCH BUT
NEI NEI NEI N I I TOTALLY AGREE
NEI
WE'RE NO WE'RE DECIDING NOW SO
YOU DO NEED THE UH MULTI OR DID UH NO LIKE THIS ONE
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT UH NOW OKAY
WELL IF YOU YOU TAKE THOSE TH IF YOU
YEAH BUT YOU CAN Z YOU CAN ZAP T YOU CAN YOU CAN ZAP TO THE VIDEO CHANNEL FROM ZERO TO UH
AH UH WELL WHATEVER
YEAH BUT IF WE'RE CHOOSING TO UH INCORPORATE THESE BUTTONS YOU HAVE TO HAVE UH CHANNEL SETTING IF YOU WA IF YOU HAVE A NEW T. V.
RIGHT ALL TH THESE UH DIFFERENT BUTTONS YOU HAVE TO
AH I DO
FOR A SCREEN UH FU UH CHANNEL SETTING
UH
AH
AH
UH DOOR IS CLOSED
BECAUSE IF WE HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS THE LAST UH MEETING WE'LL HAVE TO HURRY UP
YO
UH YEAH
IT'S NOT AS UH INTERESTING AS IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE WE JUST UH HAD THE MEETING BUT I'LL SHOW THEM
WE'LL GET YOUR PRESENTATIONS AGAIN ON THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
UH
YO
WELL EASY TO USE UH S IS A BIT UH CONTRADICTIONARY WITH THE FIRST UH FUNCTIONAL IS NOT AN ISSUE AND THEN EASY TO USE
AHA
NICE UH WELL SHOW US
WELL MAYBE IT IT IT IS BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK STRONG
NAI
UH NO
AND IT'S ROUND
WELL YOU CAN MAKE TH TH TH THAT MIDDLE RING CAN YOU YOU CAN MAKE ANOTHER COLOUR
SO UH THOSE KIND OF THINGS YOU CAN YOU CAN COMBINE
SO IF YOU TI
AND THEN UH MIKE
BUT IT HAS NO FUNCTIONALITY FOR OUR REMOTE AT ALL
SO YOU PUT A MENU IN THE L. C. D.
AH
BUT THEN WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE AN UH AN OKAY BUTTON
NO M NEXT YEAR THAT'S OUT
YES WELL BUT BEC BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUSH MENU YOU GET IN AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PUSH OKAY WHEN YOU GET TO A CHOICE
OR YOU CAN PUT IN THE L. C. D. 'S UH WINDOW AN OPTION GET OUT
NO NOT VERY STRANGE
IT STILL HAS T
TH A A KIND OF BRIDGE
WELL I HAVE AT HOME A REMOTE WITH A BRIDGE
UM WHERE NO WELL THAT'S MORE LIKE THE BUTTONS WHERE THEY HAVE TO COME
B A BIT OF YEAH WELL A BIT OF UH DESIGN
YES BUT WE HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THESE NOW
SO AS YOU SAID FRUITY IS IN WELL SELLS GOOD
UH YES
WHAT WHAT KIND OF PROPERTIES SHOULD IT HAVE
UM WELL I AM GOING TO PUT IT IN HERE UH BECAUSE WE CAN UH LOOK
I UM SOLID FEEL AND TRENDY LOOK
SO THAT'S JUST EASY
WELL YOU CAN PUT THAT IN UH INTO THE SHARED FOLDER AND THEN I'LL PUT IT IN OUR END REPORT
WE THING THAT FRUIT AND BRIGHT COLOURS ARE
UH THOSE KIND OF THINGS
WE SHOULD NOT GIVE THEM THE M THE MOST LOVELY FRONT
WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE THOSE FIFTY MILLION YEAH
UM WELL THE BUTTONS ETCETERA WE GET FROM MIKE
UH THIS FRUIT AND BRIGHT COLOURS YEAH WELL I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO IN THE NEXT UH HALF AN HOUR
WE'LL HAVE TO UH S S SPECIFY THE DIFFERENT UH TYPES WE WANT TO LAUNCH WHEN WE UH WELL INTRODUCE OUR REMOTE
WELL I'LL HAVE TO BEFORE I GET ANOTHER WARNING FOR FIVE MINUTES I'M GOING TO GET
ON A PROTOTYPE DRAWING ON THE SMARTBOARD
THAT'S WHAT I GOT UH TO HEAR
YES WELL WE'LL GET IT TO HEAR THAT I THINK
UM SO YOU CAN UH YOU YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A PROTOTYPE AND Y WELL THAT'S INCLUDES UH SPECIFYING THE BUTTONS ETCETERA
SO YOU'LL GET IT ON YOUR EM ON YOUR LAPTOP
UM WELL YOU WILL GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE UH ON THE PROJECT YEAH PROJECT EVALUATION
AH F FUCK YOU
HEH
IT'S A BIT UH BIT A PITY
I AS PROJECT MANAGER HA DON'T HAVE A CLUE
OH WE CAN UH DECIDE HOW WE IMPLEMENT THE FEELING FROM OUR COMPANY INTO THE REMOTE
ON THE
ON THE TOP
AND WELL YOU C ON THE BACK YOU CAN PUT UH H AT THE BOTTOM YOU CAN PUT THE LOGO WITH THE
THE FRONT SIDE NO NO L NO SLOGAN
ON THE BACK
UH
SO A BIT OF TITANIUM BETWEEN
THAT'S A BIT OH THAT THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY COOL
YES THAT ALSO SOUNDS UH PRETTY UH NEAT
AND IT'S ONLY F TWENTY FIVE EUROS
OH WE HAVE A ONE
BECAUSE IT'S LITTLE BIT UH HARD TO WORK WITH THESE UH PLATES
SO WE PUT A TOUCH PAD ON IT AND SAY HA HA
OH HE'S TOTALLY OFF AGAIN
SO IS IT
ALRIGHT NOW WE KNOW WHAT TO DO SO
I THINK THAT'S YOUR TA
YOU YEAH
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN MAKE A VERY COMPLICATED UH UH REMOTE ANYWAY SO EASE OF USE IT'S NOT A VERY COMP COMPLICATED DEVICE
UM I HAVE HEARD SEVERAL THINGS SO I UH I'LL HAVE TO CHANGE THAT ON THE WAY
BUT UH AS YOU INDICATED UH IT SHOULD BE STRONG
Y HARD PLASTIC I IS OF COURSE UH PRETTY PRETTY TOUGH BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A REALLY REALLY TOUGH LOOK
AS YOU SAID UH PARTICULARLY THE TRADITIONAL MATERIALS AS SUCH AS WOOD AND MATERIALS SUCH AS THAT
AND THEN WE HAVE UH YOUNG UH AND DYNAMIC UH PEOPLE WHICH IS OF COURSE OUR UH GROUP THE PEOPLE WE AIM AT
SOFT MATERIALS IS OF COURSE UH AGAI AGAIN A BIT A CONTRADICTION WITH UH OUR UH MATERIAL CHOICE OF WHAT YOU SAID
THAT UH IT SHOULD BE HARD AN AND AND AND AND STRONG LOOKING
SO NOT UH TOO FORMAL LIKE LIKE UH THE OLDER PEOPLE WANT
DISCMANS FOR JOGGING AND THAT THOSE KIND OF DEVICES GAMING DEVICES SHOULD DEFINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEVICE
IT WAS NOT VERY UH INTERESTING UH VERY CLASSICAL LOOKING BUT THAT'S N THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT
WE HAVE THESE KIND OF THINGS
YOU ALSO UH SEE UH THIS DEVICE IT'S NOT VERY ROUND AND FRUITY OF COURSE
YOU CAN SEE IT ALL HERE
I THINK AS YOU KNOW SOMETHING UH SOME DEVICES LIKE THIS
ALTHOUGH IT'S PLASTIC IT'S IT'S GREY TO TO TO GIVE IT IRON LOOK
BECAUSE IF WE MAKE IT GREY OR OR SILVERY LOOKING IT IT DOES MAKE IT A LOT MORE UH DOES MAKE IT LOOKING A LOT MORE STRONGER
'CAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS IT IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY VERY STRONG BECAU BUT THIS IS PLASTIC AND AND THIS TOO BUT
THE FEEL
UH ALRIGHT
AND I THEN I HAVE SOME MORE FINDINGS
I UH GOT SOME OTHER UM UH UH ENERGY SOURCES OF COURSE
BUT SOLAR ENERGY IS NOT VERY PRACTICAL INSIDE A HOUSE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A HAVE A LOT OF UH SUN
FOR UH FOR A SIMPLE REMOTE THAT'S A BIT OH THAT'S A BIT UH
UH THE DISADVANTAGE OF THAT THAT YOU CAN USE NO TITANIUM
UH A MORE MODERN LOOK NOT PLAIN LONG BOX STYLE BUT
AND IT MAKES UH IT GIVES IT A MORE U USER FRIENDLY SHAPE THAN IF YOU HAVE UH
UM F AS UH FOR THE BUTTONS SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS
NO UH OTHERWI UH NO UM DIFFICULT SCROLL THINGS OR SOME UH THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT MAKES MORE COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE
AND UH AS WE AGREED WE DON'T USE A SPEAKER OR A SENSOR OR UM UH SPEAK UH SPEECH UH CONTROLLED DEVICE
BUT WE DO USE AN L. C. D. SCREEN SO WE UH WE DO HAVE TO CONSIDER UH OF WE HAVE TO USE A MORE ADVANCED CHIP
BUT IT IT'S N NICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
CAN YOU DRAW IT NOW OF UH CAN YOU DRAW IT NOW
THOSE ARE THE THE CHA THE CHANNEL BUTTONS OF COURSE
BY PRESSING THE MENU BUTTON AGAIN YOU GO UH OUT
IT'S USUAL THE THE THE D KIND OF THE WAY IT WORKS
BUT YOU CAN MEN YOU CAN PRESS MENU AGAIN TO GET OUT
UH BUT UH WE COULD UH D DO BUT IT'S PERHAPS MORE EXPENSIVE UH THE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OR SOMETHING
THEY DO THEY DON'T LOOK FRUITY ENOUGH
THO YEAH THOSE
BUT IT IT MUST NOT LOOK TOO CHILDISH OF COURSE HUH
WE HAVE T YEAH YEAH
SO WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER I GUESS
OUR SOURCES
SO WE HAVE TO UH PUT IT IN ONE UH DOCUMENT
COPY PASTE UH THIS STORY INTO A INTO A WORD DOCUMENT AND THEN UH PUT THE ANSWERS AFTER THE SUBJECTS
W WE CAN UH OVERRIDE THEM
UH THAT'S ME
YEAH BUT THE NON REMOVABLE ELEMENTS OF THE OF THE REMOTE SO NOT THE FRONT COULD BE TITANIUM TO GIVE THAT UH STRONG LOOK
AND YOU CAN PUT THAT ON AND OFF AND SWITCH IT
NO UH I NEI
AND EVEN IF IT DOES UH DOESN'T MATCH IT WILL UH PEOPLE LIKE MM COLOURS THAT DON'T MATCH
YEAH COPPER I JUST A BA BASIC UH
YEAH IN
FOR THE FOR THE LAUNCH YEAH
SO E TH THEN A C COUPLE OF BASIC COLOURS
NOT NOT VERY UH SIM NOT
UH WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE WE HAVE STILL HAVE TO MAKE THE ES THE THE REAL BASIC DESIGN
BECAUSE YEAH WE HAVE THE SKETCH BUT
UH
UH NO I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING BUT MAYBE UH ANYONE ELSE UH YEAH
TO MAKE IT AS UH AS ROUND AS POSSIBLE
WELL TH TH TH TH TH THAT DEPENDS UH
WE WE J WE'LL JUST GIVE THEM AN UH WE'LL DESIGN IT AND THEN THEY CAN GIVE COMMENTS ON IT
BUT YOU CAN PUT IT ON THE BACK ON THE TITANIUM PART
I L I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE OF THE SLOGAN ON THE ON THE ON THE THING
BUT AM I THE ONLY ONE OR UH
NO NOT ON THE FRONT BUT ON THE BACKSIDE
UH
NOT ON THE ENTIRE BACK BUT UH JUST VERY SMALL
BUT WE'LL UH WE'LL TAKE THAT UH WITH US INTO THE DESIGN
LO UH YEAH
DO YOU DO YOU SEE A BIT OF THE OF THE UM
UH MAYBE IF WE MAKE THIS THIS THIS LOWER PART TITANIUM THE FRONT IS THE THE UPPER PART AND THE THE BIT WITH THE WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN
I LIKE THAT BIT OF UH TITANIUM ALSO ON THE UH
IT ALSO HAS THE THOSE TWO DISTINCT UH
MM BIT LIKE THIS
OF COURSE BECAUSE IT'S MY DESIGN BUT NO OUR D OUR DESIGN ALRIGHT
WELL WE HAVE UH B YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BIT OF HUMOUR IN THE IN THE DISCUSSIONS TOO BECAUSE IT BECOMES TOO TOO TOO TOO STRESSY
BUT UH TH YOUTH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT FUNCTIO FUNCTIONALITY SO
MAYBE W MAYBE WE MAYBE W M CAN WE GET EMAIL HERE
ONLY THE FEEL
WELL UM NAH THE METHOD UM WE WILL UM INCLUDE THE BUTTONS AS WE DISCUSSED UH EARLIER
UM THERE ARE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN SPEECH RECOGNITION UM SYSTEMS UM AND THEY ARE ALREADY BEING UH USED ON UH COFFEE MACHINES
AND UM WELL THEY'RE CHEAP SO WE COULD USE THEM NOW
UH RECORD THE MESSAGE AND RECORD AN ANSWER AND THEN ONCE YOU UH TALK TO THE REMOTE THEN UM HE WILL A ANSWER WITH THE
SO IF I SAY HI MIKE AND YOU HAVE RECORDED UH HI MIKE BACK THEN YOU WILL GET THAT
NO BUT THAT'S THE GADGET THEY WANT OR THE GIMMICKS
WELL AS I SAID UH EARLIER I THINK THE UH L. C. D. SCREEN SHOULD BE UH POSITIONED AT THE LOWER END OF THE REMOTE
I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE AND YEAH W WELL EVERY USER WOULD LIKE THAT
UM THE BUTTONS UM SHOULD BE POSITIONED UH POSITIONED THE SAME WAY AS THEY ARE ON A WELL CONVENTIONAL REMOTE I THINK
AND UH I DREW AN EXAMPLE BUT IT DID NOT WORK QUITE THE WELL UH THE WAY I WANTED IT TO DO
WELL THESE LITTLE BUTTONS ARE A BIT DIFFICULT TO UH DRAW UH
THESE THESE WILL BE BIGGER IN THE THE REAL DESIGN
UM THE VIDEO BUTTON SHOULD BE UH AN APART BUTTON BECAUSE YOU WANT IT TO UH T YEAH TO USE IT FAST WITHIN ONE UH CLICK
AH RIGHT
WELL YOU YOU
NO NO WE WE WE SHOULD UH ADD UH A EXTRA MENU BUTTON AND THIS THE OKAY BUTTON
AH ONCE YOU HAVE AN EXTRA MENU BUTTON YOU DON'T NEED THAT THAT EXTRA OPTION
AND OH I THINK AS YOU CAN SEE SO THE L. C. D. SCREEN DOES LOOK BETTER UH AT THE LOWER END OR AT THE BOTTOM
OH UM I HAD SOME UH EXAMPLES
I DID NOT LIKE IT VERY MUCH BUT
NO WELL TH
UH THIS IS FOR CHILDREN BUT TH
I THINK WE SHOULD IF IT'S UM POSSIBLE UH ONE WITH COLOURS BUT
HA EVEN MORE
N
AH RIGHT
I THINK WE WHY DON'T WE UM USE UH TITANIUM OR OR A HARD
YEAH YOU HAVE THE RE REMOTE IN YOUR HAND LIKE THIS
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN MAKE STEEL JUST ANY WAY YOU WANT IT TO
OUR CUSTOMERS WILL USE THOSE UH FUNKY UH TRENDY COLOURS AND THEY DON'T USE UH WOOD
THE ELECTRICAL CABLE UH DOES
WELL I GOT A BETTER ONE HERE AND I WILL UM
I WILL WORK THIS OUT UH FOR THE UH NEXT MEETING
YEAH RIGHT FOR THE UH INITIATIVE UH LAUNCH
WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN GIVE THEM UH S S THREE OR SO SO THAT THEY CAN UH EXPERIMENT WITH IT AND THAT THEY WANT MORE
BUT BU WE STAY WE STAY HERE OR SOMETHING
AH RIGHT
AH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH
WILL WE USE UH ROUND BUTTONS OR SQUARE ONES FOR THE FOR THE NUMBERS
AND THESE UH THESE S THESE BUTTONS UH ARE MORE UH TRIANGLE ISH SHAPED WITH A SQUARE ONE IN THE MIDDLE
WELL MOST OF THE TIME UH UP AND DOWN IS PROGRAMME AND LEFT AND RIGHT ARE VOLUME I THINK
IF YOU TURN UP THE VOLUME YOU ALWAYS SEE THIS THINGY GO UP
AH THE LOGO SHOULD BE ON THE TOP I THINK
UH YEAH AT THE BACK
YOU CAN THE LOGO CAN BE ON ON EVERY UH FRONT
YEAH ON THE BACKSIDE
WELL N N NOT NOT ON THE FRONT SIDE I THINK
ON THE BACK YES YOU YOU CAN YEAH PUSH THAT IN SO THAT IT IS ALWAYS BE THERE
AH
AHA
WE'VE DONE TOO MUCH IN THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS
WE CAN BETTER UH DRAW A DESIGN ON THIS
UH THIS BECAUSE OF OUR LAST MODEL WAS VERY FUNCTIONAL BUT IT UH PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THAT SO OUR NEW MO MODEL MUST BE VERY GOOD LOOKING
THIS IS UH TWO TIMES AS LESS IMPORTANT AND UH SAME FOR THIS ONE
WELL I THINK THAT UH SPEAKS FOR S FOR ITSELF
SO I SET YOUR MIND TO IT
MAYBE IN A COLOUR OR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS SO F REALLY FLASHY BUT IT IT IS ALSO STRONG
SO IT LOOKS VERY HEAVY BUT YOU CAN STILL UH USE IT VERY EASILY
FRUITY
FRUITY
WELL IT'S GOT A STRONG LOOK THIS
THE FEEL
NAH YEAH THE FEEL
YOUNG PEOPLE LOVE THEM
NEI THEY'RE N THEY'RE NOT TRENDY
BUT ARE WE GOING FOR A STRANGE UH FORM
YOU CAN MAKE THE THE UNDERSIDE YOU CAN MAKE IT MORE ROUND WHERE THE L. C. D. IS
I DUNNO IF YOU KNOW THE NO NOKIA TELEPHONE WITH UH THE ROUND UH THING AT AT THE BOTTOMS S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH BUT PEOPLE LIKE SOMETHING UH NEW YOU KNOW
Y YIS
YOUR BAG
FRONTS ARE ARE CHEAPER THAN WHEN THEY'RE FROM PLAS
WHEN YOU WANT AN OTHER COLOUR ON THE FRONT IT DOESN'T MATCH
NEI
YOU CAN BUY A DIFFERENT KIND OF OF OF MACHINE BUT IT'S THE SAME THING BUT WITH ANOTHER FRONT
YEAH N NOT TOO HEAVY
ELSE IT W WON'T SELL
WE DON'T HAVE PRODU PRODUCT YET SO KIND OF DIFFICULT
UM ROUND
SO YOU CAN SEE YOU HAVE TO UP OR DOWN
ME TOO
IT'S BETTER IF YOU HAVE IT UH
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS TITANIUM TOO
ELSE YOU YOU GET PROBLEMS WITH THE L. C. D.
SOME SOME KIND OF WEI WEIGHT IN IT
NO MAN
THEN UM I GUESS THAT'S YOUR BIT
I I DIDN'T S SEE ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO I ALREADY UH THOUGHT YOU UH YOU WERE TO DO THAT
UM WE'LL UH EVALUATE OUR P OUR UH PRODUCTION
OH NEI
UH NO
WE GE WE WENT THROUGH THE AGENDA AND WELL WE HAD SOME UH SOME PRESENTATIONS FROM YOU THREE
AND UH I SUMMARISED WHAT YOU SAID TO US
AND THEN UH WE CAN WE CAN UH USE THE TIME BETTER
WELL IF I LOOK AT IT THE SIDE THE SIDE VIEW
W
WHEN I LOOK AT UH WHEN I LOOK AT THIS SIDE VIEW I THINK W WHEN I HAVE THAT IN MY HAND IT'S TERRIBLE
IF IF YOU LOOK IF IF THIS THIS IS THICK AND THIS IS THIN TH TH THEN IT THAT IT LIES OVER YOUR HANDS
THEY THE THE THE THE THE SIDE VIEW WE DIDN'T UH
NO NO WHEN I I MY PERSONAL TASTE IS THAT I WANT IT TO FALL OVER MY HANDS WITH A THICK BUT
FOR ME I I WOULDN'T BUY IT
SO LET IT BE LIKE THIS AT UH AT THIS MOMENT
COMES TO THAT LATER
THAN JUST SPEAKING
TO THE CUSTOMERS
NEI
UH
WELL ONE
EASY TO FIND T
WE WE HAVE TO GET GET ON GO THROUGH THIS
Y WELL WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT
ARE THE FUNCTIONS EASY TO LEARN
WELL W I WE DO WANT WE HAVE A L F F LESS OF AN
AH
YEAH BUT JUST DO SOME WE WE
I TH I TH I THINK THIS IS TOO TIME CONSUMING
WE YOU HAVE TO PUT IT TO THE CUSTOMERS
UH WELL WELL A BIT SO FOUR
ONE
AND FEATURES INCLUDED ALSO ONE
UH THOSE UH NINE UH IS THE FANCY LOOKING
IS THE DEVICE EASY TO USE
ARE THE TRENDS ABOUT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IMPLEMENTED
WELL IN OUR COVERS IN OUR FRONTS
IS THE MATERIAL ATTRACTIVE
IS THE MATERIAL ATTRACTIVE
WELL THE TITANIUM IS STRONG AND UH THE REST F UH THE BUTTONS FEEL SOFT
YES BUT WE WE HAVE TO DESIGN MUCH MORE BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME IRRITATING ACCOUNT MANAGER COMING TO ME
UH
KICK IT OUT
THE SPEAKER COSTS FAR BY FAR THE MOST
L. C. THREE
Y T COME ON W A REMOTE CONTROL HAS A BATTERY
WELL BE FOR THE L. C. D. UH YOU HAD SAID
ONE
YEAH THEN YOU S THEN YOU ONLY HAVE ONE HALF LEFT
UH YEAH
NO THE ADVANCED CHIP IS NEEDED TO HAVE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
WELL I I DID SINGLE CURVE TO WELL YOU SAID S DOUBLE CURVED UH HE BECAUSE UH I THOUGHT IT'S A B A BIT CHEAPER ALREADY
COME ON IF WE IF WE IF WE MAKE THIS FIFTY MILLION THEY WON'T HESITATE TO UH CONGRATULATE US SO UH
OH COSTS NOTHING
YES BUT I JUST GOT IT
WHO
AND MAKE ALL PLASTIC THEN WE HA THEN WE'RE THERE
TH THEN YOU HAVE A UGLY STUPID L UGLY LOOKING DUMB REMOTE THAT THAT NO ONE WOULD BUY
AND THE FEEL AND TH THAT IT IS STRONG AND
TITANIUM I THI I THINK THIS THIS IS THIS IS E REALLY GOOD RE REMOTE
AH THOSE THOSE ACCOUNT MANAGERS WHAT DO TH D WHAT DO THEY KNOW
RIOT
ONE AND A HALF EUROS
AS WE HAVE MONEY OVER UH LEFT
Y OH NO
WE HAVE TO DUMP OUR TITANIUM AND WE'LL HATE THE MANAGERS FOR THAT BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE OUR PROJECT OF UH PROJECT PROJECT
I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE THAT WE GOT UH THOSE COSTS AT THE LAST MOMENT
UH YEAH WELL I THINK SO ALSO
I AL I I'VE UH FILLED THAT IN IN A THE QUESTIONNAIRES UH EACH TIME SO WELL THE MANAGERS WERE TERRIBLE
SO WITH THEIR ALL THEIR
NO THEY SAID OH WE WON'T D UH WE WON'T UH USE TELETEXT UH WE WON'T USE THE D. V. D.
WELL WI W WHICH ONE DID YOU LIKE
TH THAT IS SO
OR INSTALL A LAPTOP TO A BEAMER OR HAVE THIS ONE STANDING HERE IN AN I I LIKE IT
DID UH DID YOU LIKE THAT ONE
I USED IT UH JUST TO CHECK IT OUT BUT UH
YOU YOU CAN'T SEND THAT TO ANYONE BECAUSE YOU YOU'VE SCRABBLED SOMETHING ON A PAGE FOR YOURSELF AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEND IT YEAH
IT'S NO IT IT'S USELESS
BUT FOR NOTES IT I YOU YOU HAVE TO PUT THAT IN A STRICT UH YOU HAVE TO PUT A NAME STANDARD DATE AND ALL THOSE THINGS
OTHER UH THINGS WE USED HERE
I HAVEN'T LOOKED W ONE TIME DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA
WHAT KIND OF IDEAS FOR N A FUTURE SCHEDULE WHAT
WE HATE THIS
BUT UH TWO T BUT UH TH THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF DRAWINGS
BECAUSE IF I HAD A COMPANY AND I'M GOING TO UH BUY THOSE EXPENSIVE HUGE EXPENSIVE UH THINGS I AND I HAVE TO W
WELL TH THEN STILL THEY THEY THEY SHOULD HAVE A A NICE GRAPHICS PROGRAMME ON THE LAPTOP
YOU YOU CAN'T DRAW ANYTHING UH NEAT
SE
WELL YEAH IT IS A BIT UH WELL WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE THE END REPORT AND UH ALL THOSE THINGS
I DI DID YOU UM SAVE THIS ONE IN THE FOLDER
OH IT WORKED
UH
S OH
HE SAVED THEM ALL TEN
SHE
OUR MANAGER
THAT THAT'S THE TITLE OF OUR UH END DOCUMENT
YEAH THAT'S IMPORTANT TOO
FROM ME OF COURSE YEAH
ALRIGHT WE BOTH UH WILL
OR ONE OF US WILL
UH
UH IT'S PRETTY UH MUCH UH LIKE UH MIKE DRAW UH DREW UH THE IN THE DURING THE LAST MEETING
TH SO THERE'S THIS PART UM WHICH IS MADE OF HARD PLASTIC THE FRONT
OF COURSE FOR THE LAUNCH WE USE THE BASIC UGLY COLOURS AND LATER WE'LL PUT OUT UH MORE INTERESTING COVERS WITH DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND PICTURES AND EVERYTHING
YOU CAN SEE IT ALSO ON THE ON THE ON THE SIDE VIEW THAT ONLY THIS PART IS THE FRONT
AND THE REST OF IT THE UNDER UH THE UNDER SIDE UH OF IT
UM THEN WE HAVE UH ON BACK ON THE FRONT UH THE LOGO IN THE UPPER CORNER
YEAH THE LOGO UH UH IT'S DIFFICULT TO DRAW SO SMALL BUT IT'S OUR DOUBLE R. UH LOGO IS IN THERE
UM SO THAT'S THE LOGO IN THE UPPER LEF UH RIGHT CORNER
UH IT'S DIFFICULT TO DRAW AGAIN THE LITTLE OVAL OR ROUND I THINK OVAL WILL BE BETTER FOR THE FOR THE D FOR THE DIFFERENT UH CHANNEL BUTTONS
SO UH OVAL N THOSE ARE HERE
AND THEN WE HAVE THE M
THE M
OH NEI WE UH THE OKAY BUTTON'S HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OF THE OPERATORS OF THE CHANNEL AND UH VOLUME UM CHANGERS
MAYBE I I DON'T WANT TO I DON'T WANT TO SUPPRESS YOU BUT N I'LL UH FINISH THIS UH QUICK
WE THOUGHT ABOUT YEAH UH THE BACK IS OF COURSE TOTALLY TITANIUM
WE HAVE THEN THE LOGO ON FRONT AND ON THE BACK
OH AND UH BEFORE I FORGET
AND YOU CAN RECORD IT UH USING YEAH THE THE THE BACK OF THE F W DEVICE
H WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST I MEAN WE DO
THIS WAS MIKE'S PROTOTYPE AND Y YOU SEEMED TO AGREED ON IT
UH OH THE SIDE
W WE WE HE DREW THE S THE SIDE BUT YOU D YOU WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION AS USUAL
YOU YEAH Y HOW DO YOU CALL IT
WELL Y Y Y YOU DON'T HAVE IT LIKE THIS
YOU HAVE IT MORE LIKE THIS
YOU YOU YOU'RE USING BUTTONS THIS WAY OR IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED THIS WAY
SO YOU YEAH
AND MAYBE YOU CAN YOU CAN GRAB IT A BIT HIGHER SO WELL
BUT UH ARE D CAN YOU LIVE WITH IT
UH
BUT D YOU DON'T THINK THIS IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE I GUESS
YEAH BUT OF COURSE Y YOU ARE ALSO HUMAN
MAYBE A THOUSAND PEOPLE OR A MILLION PEOPLE
WELL D WE DESIGNED IT SO OF COURSE WE ARE VERY
SO AND WE HA WE HAVE ANSWER NOW
UH IT'S IT'S NOT F A DEVICE THAT
UH NO
BUT I THINK THEY'LL UH THEY THEY THINK UH THE THE TITANIUM LOOK OF IT IS ALSO UH I THINK IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR THEM
IS IT EASY TO T CHANGE CHANNELS
I THINK IT'S UH AS EASY AS UH CAN BE MADE
UH
D WE D WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE UH THAT S
WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE DEVICE THAT BEEPS UH WHEN YOU LOST IT OR SO BUT UM UM
ONE
AND I THINK FANCY FEELING TOO BECAUSE OF THE TITANIUM BACK
SO WELL MAYBE TWO BECAUSE OF THE VOICE RECORDER
F
I KNEW THINGS UH WERE GOING UH TOO SMOOTHLY
YEAH W THA THAT'S UH THAT'S A BIT AN OPTIONAL OPTION
NO D TH NO
UH
YEAH BUT IT'S ONLY ONE HALF
UH IT D IT DOESN'T
BUT WE D THEN WE HAVE TO LOSE THE L. C. D. SCREEN
I DI I DIDN'T UH PUT UH THE ADVANCED CHIP IN THERE FOR FUN
BUT WHAT WHAT DID WHAT DO N SORRY BUT WHAT DO THEY MEAN WITH THE CURVES
IS TH IS THIS A CURVE
W T WE CAN NEVER GET UH BELOW THE TWELVE AND A HALF
IT'S IT'S VERY UH NOT PRACTICAL TO HA TO CONSIDER THIS AFTER WE HAVE DESIGNED THE ENTIRE THING
N NOT VERY PRACTICAL
BUT I'M N I DON'T AGREE
AND ALSO THE THE OLDER PEOPLE WILL LIKE IT BECAUSE OF THAT
ALL WE WANT IS A IS A FANCY DESIGN BUT WE DON'T REALLY CONSIDER THE COSTS
AND ON PLASTIC TIMES TWO AND THEN WE UH ARE THERE
NO YEAH WELL OH SIX
NO TWO FOR THE TO MAKE IT CLEAR
WE HAVE WE HAVE TO UH FILL
W WE HA NO NO NO BUT TH THAT'S NOT F UM
BUT IT ISN'T BAD TO TO TO STAY AT ELEVEN
WE GET MORE SALARY IF WE MAKE IF CHEAPER THAN TWELVE UH TWELVE AND A HALF
WELL I CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION BUT UH I THINK IT'S UH WELL IN IN IF WE CONSIDER THE COSTS THEN THIS IS THE BEST YEAH
YEAH BUT THEY BASE THAT ON ON THE USER SPECIFICATIONS
NO UH IT IT IT UH IT IS UH
NO IT'S OTHER WAY AROUND
WELL I DIDN'T USE UH
NEI IT IT'S MUCH M
BUT UH YOU CAN UH I I SENT IT ABOUT THREE TIMES NOW
I WROTE THINGS DOWN BUT I DIDN'T IMPORT IT INTO MY LAPTOP
W BUT ALSO Y YOU WRITE THINGS DOWN
SO WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE TH WHAT'S THE POINT OF IMPORTING IT INTO
BUT I THINK UH D THIS OPTION IS ONLY USEFUL IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PAPERWORK
YOU CAN'T IT'S NOT VERY UH NI YEAH WELL A LOT OF DOCUMENTS ARE YEAH
MU YEAH RIGHT
DID YOU REALLY TAKE UH TAKE THOSE IN ACCOUNT
BUT IF W YEAH
BUT SUPPOSE IT WAS WORKING CORRECTLY WHAT UH WOULD IT BE USEFUL THEN IF IT WASN'T OFF ALL THE TIME
L LI LI
WELL IT ISN'T BUT MAYBE THAT THING IS UH IS
SO UH IF WE GET IN UH IF WE GET ANOTHER ONE AND YOU MAKE SURE IT DOES WORK I THINK THEN IT'S PRETTY USEFUL
BECAUSE UH YEAH YOU CAN DRAW T THINGS QUICKLY AND UH CLEARLY FOR ANYONE UH IN THE DISCUSSION ROOM
THEY ALSO WANT TO SEE MY CAT AND HIS RABBIT AND UH
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
OH YOU MEAN OUR UH COACH OUR F PERSONAL COACH
IS SHE ALSO OUR ACCOUNTANT
IS SHE RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING THAT INFORMATION SO LATE
BIT LATE
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TO DRAW THAT IN YEAH
OVAL YEAH
NO THE BACK
THIS THE FRONT WON'T BE AS THICK BUT AGAIN TH THE THE DRAWING TECHNIQUE MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO TO REALLY UH
IF Y
YOU YOU HAVE IT A BIT UH YEAH
THAT WAY IT IT FALLS INTO YOUR HAND
WELL F FOR AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THREE OF US AGREE AND ONLY NILS
WELL I SHOULD I THINK TWO BECAUSE THE VOICE RECORDER IS N NOT SELF LEARNING
T
WELL THREE
WE WE WE WHY
UH WELL WE HAVE TO PUT THAT IN
NO WE OH
YOU YOU WE HAVE AN ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT AND WE HAVE AN L. C. DISPLAY
Y WE DON'T NEED BOTH
AH NO NO
AMEN
BECAUSE YOU Y HAVE THAT CURVE AND YOU HAVE THAT CURVE
WELL Y WE HAVE CURVES IN ALL DIRECTIONS
PRO PROJECT
WELL WE WE WE USED OUR CREATIVITY BUT WE JUST HAD TO ADAPT IT TO THE COSTS
NEI
UH NO
OH THEY'RE BOTH SMARTBOARDS
WELL WE WE USED THAT ONE AND WE NEEDED IT
WELL I I DREW THIS
BUT IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UH USEFUL IF I I COULD SHOW THIS ON THE SCREEN
EMAIL OR CHAT OR SOMETHING
YEAH ALRIGHT BUT THAT'S ONE N NEW IDEA
WELL YOU YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T DRAW ON A LAPTOP LIKE YOU LIKE YOU PAINT OF OR DRAW WITH YOUR HAND
YEAH BUT BUT THEN YOU CAN UH SAVE IT IN INSTANTLY AND AND AND RE USE IT AND UH
I THINK YOU HAVE WE HAVE TO MAKE CLEAR TO HER THAT WE ARE READY
SHE'S ON THE MOVE
AND IF YOU HAVE IT LI IN THE MIDDLE YOUR HAND MIGHT BE OVER IT
I'M GOING TO DO UH THE EV EVALUATION
AND WE HAVE TO LOOK IF OUR UH IF OUR DEVICE UH IS WORKING CORRECTLY
WELL I PUT SOME QUESTIONS IN A WORD FILE
SEE IF I CAN FIND THEM
I UH THINK YOU HAVE ALL SEEN UH THIS KIND OF EVALUATION SO UH I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT
YEAH BUT I CAN'T CAN S
WE DIS WE DI WE DESIGNED IT TO BE PERFECT
'CAUSE TH THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE MIGHT HAVE UH BI MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN
WELL WITH THE UH THREE
NAH F FOUR I THINK
OUT
KICK IT OUT
KICK IT OUT
BATTERIES ARE UH QUITE
UH NO NO NO NO
YEAH BUT NO THAT'S N IT'S NOT RELEVANT
Y
OR YOU SHOU IT'S OR CHANGE THE TITANIUM OR DUMP THE L. C. D. SCREEN
BUT I THINK YOU COULD BETTER CHANGE UH TITANIUM TO HARD A HARD KIND OF PLASTIC LOOKING LIKE TITANIUM THAN LOSE THE L. C. D. SCREEN
BECAUSE YOU HAVE LOTS OF FUNCTIONS IN IT TOO
OSL
SO S IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY YOU CAN'T MAKE IT
IT'S JUST FREE MAN
SHOOT
YEAH THINK SO TOO
B BUT YOU THIS IS JUST A LARGE T LARGE TELEVISION
AND HERE ON THIS ONE YOU CAN UH DRAW THE PICTURES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
YEAH BUT I THINK THERE'S A BIG DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE THESE TH I DON'T NEED A SMARTBOARD
WELL MORE MORE INFORMATION IN THE BEGINNING
YEAH MU
I'M GONNA BUY ONE BUY ONE FOR MY BEDROOM
WE M HAVE TO MAKE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE WILL GET BACK TH ON THAT
YOU CAN PRINT IT
YOU HAVE TO PAINT NOW
THE B UH WE WILL SELL THE T AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
IS THIS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE THAT UH BIG BUTTONS
SO WHAT IDEAS DO YOU HAVE FOR IT FOR THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL
NO BATTERY USE
SO UH WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW IS NEXT MEETING IS IN HALF AN H HOUR
UH
WELL LOOK ON YOUR
SEE YOU LATER IN HALF AN HOUR
WHOO
OH NOT
ISH
HE DID IT BEFORE
UM I HAVE ONE SET AND UH A REMOTE CONTROL WHEN I DROPPED IT UH IT BROKE
AND UH G BIG BUTTONS M UH THAT'S EASIER TO USE THAN UH I THINK
UH IT BETWEEN THE COUCH AND YOU CAN'T FIND IT
WHEN YOU PUSH A BUT A BUTTON ON THE T. V. THEN YOU HEAR SOME UH SOME SORT OF BLEEP
THAT'S UH STRANGE
UH
UH
SO THAT YOU KNOW IT S IT STILL HAS BATTERIES ON IT IN IT
AND THAT IF YOU PUSH THE BUTTON THE LED UH GIVES A LIGHT AND UH AND YOU SEE THAT IT'S WORKING
UH
UH
UH
UH
I'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING UH ON MY SCREEN NOW
AND UM YEAH UH ON OUR WEBSITE WE CAN SEE WHAT PRODUCTS WE ALREADY HAVE
AND IT SHOULD WORK WITH AS MANY UH AS POSSIBLE OF THEM
YEAH ON YOUR COMPUTER OR THE
ON THE DESKTOP
GONE
SAVE AS
OH OH
WHEN YOU USE IT ON THE TELEVISION YOU'VE YOU NEED THE TELEVISION WH WHICH CAN USE IT
I THINK WE HAVE TO USE IT ALSO ON OTHER TELEVISIONS THOUGH
YEAH BUT ARE THEIR
N YEAH BUT
I THINK THAT TOO LESS PEOPLE WOULD CHANGE IT FOR GOOD PROFIT
WE'LL GOT BACK ON THAT LATER
SO I THINK THAT CAN BE AN D GOOD OPTION
SO BUT WE'LL COME BACK ON THAT
OH GO ON
UH WE GO BACK ON THE DECISIONS LATER
SO WE DON'T LOOK AT THE OTHER THINGS LIKE THE RADIO OR SOMETHING
UH NO YOUNGER THAN FORTY
SO YOU CAN SEE IT ON OUR SITE
UM NO
WHO FIRST
WHAT WAS W YOUR ONE
TECHNO
WE HAD W UH NO NO NO NO
HALLO
MENU
UH YES THE N NEWER TELEVISIONS HA DO HAVE MENUS
UH
M MENU
ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN
THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE IT IT HAS TO WORK ON ALL TELEVISIONS
N YES
IS THIS ENOUGH
SO WE CAN GO ON TO
THAT'S FOR THE SO UH NEXT POINT
AFTER THAT WE HAVE T THIRTY MINUTES FOR WORK
UH I'VE
I'VE SAVE IT ON MY COMPUTER MY PRESENTATION
NOT A OF
ONE MORE
I HAD ONE
OKAY HERE IT IS
A LITTLE LATER BUT HERE IT IS
I JUST HAD AN HALF AN HOUR J TO STUDY IT AND I DON'T GET IT
THE WORKING BOUT IT UH OF IT
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SCIENCE UH YOU I WILL SHOW THAT UH IN IN A FEW MINUTES
THE REMOTE CONTROL IS A VERY DIFFICULT UH THING TO UH TO EXPLAIN TO JUST ALL OF YOU WH WHO HAVEN'T SEEN A REMOTE CONTROL UH INSIDE
UH ON TOP OF THIS THERE ARE UH THE NUMBERS
UH YOU HAVE ALL ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
AND THE CHIP WILL UM SEND IT TO ALL KIND OF SUB COMPONENTS
THAT'S A SHORT H UH HOW IT WORKS
UH ALSO FOR THE COST UH WE SHOULD ONLY PUT ONE BATTERY ON IT
UH ALSO FOR THE COST UH USE ONLY PLASTIC
AND THEN UM THAT THAT YOU WILL SEE IT ON THE T. V.
AND ON THE T. V. YOU CAN UH SWITCH INTO THE MENU
AND THE BLEEP SIGNAL Y UH YOU TOLD US
AND YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND THEN YOU HEAR BLEEP BLEEP AND WE WILL FIND IT
IF WE W IF WE USE ONLY JUST ONE UH SMALL PEN LIGHT THEN IT WILL BE CHEAPER THAN WHEN WE USE TWO
MAYBE JUST A MENU BUTTON TO USE IT ON OUR TELEVISIONS
AND ON THE OTHER TELE TELEVISIONS YOU CAN ALSO USE IT BUT THEN WE WON'T USE THE
BUT UH TO HAVE A TRENDY REMOTE CONTROL WE CAN ALSO UM MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THE NOKIA UM MOBILE PHONES
SO IF YOU HAVE UH A TRENDY HALF WITH ALL RED UH YELLOW AND SOMETHING
YEAH BUT THEN WE'LL HAVE TO TO JUST UM PUT FIVE COVERS ON IT AND SEE IF IT WORKS
THEN WE UH WON'T G UH GO FURTHER WITH IT
I WI I WON'T
BUT MAYBE I THINK TRENDY PEOPLE OR LIKE CHILDREN WHERE YOU CAN PAINT ON IT
AND UH THE THE CHILDREN THINK OH THIS IS MY REMOTE CONTROL UH I MADE A PICTURE ON IT
UH
UH THE COST WILL BE A LOT OF H UH A LOT HIGHER
TO CHANGE TO THE NEXT CHANNEL JUST ONE BUTTON
UH
AH
AND UH WELL IT ALL BY PUSHING A BUTTON ON THE REMOTE
UH I FIND SOME UH SOME INTERESTING QUOTES ON THE WEB
AND UH AND AND AND WELL BASIC UH OPERATIONS LIKE ON AND OFF AND UH SWITCHING CHANNELS AND UH AND MAYBE UH TELETEXT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH
WE JUST HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER HOW UH DIFFICULT IT IS
UH A RADIO OR A V A VIDEO RECORDER UH V. C. R.
YEAH WELL THE THAT WAS JUST ON MY MIND
OH MINE
WILL THIS WILL THIS ADD TO THE COST
YES BUT YOU HAVE TO M UH BE ABLE TO CHANGE IT
UH UM M
THIS BIT TOO FAR
SO I'M UH GONNA HAVE A PRESENTATION ABOUT UM THE MARKET ABOUT UM YEAH WHAT PEOPLE THINK
UH AMONG THEM DESIGN UH D D HOW D DID THEY LIKE THE USE OF IT UH WHAT FRUSTRATIONS THEY HAD WHILE USING REMOTE CONTROLS
AND UM TH THEY ALSO FOUND THEM HARD TO TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT
SO A LOT OF UNUSED BUTTONS
UH ON THE BUTTONS
UH NOT IMPORTANT THEY FOUND THE AUDIO UH THAT'S NOT THE VOLUME BUT UH SPECIFIC THE THE PITCH OR THE LEFT OR RIGHT
UH TH AND THEY ALSO ARE NOT USED VERY OFTEN
UH HERE WE CAN SEE WHAT THE MARKET SHARE IS OF UH SEVERAL GROUPS
UM AS YOU CAN SEE MOST USERS ARE UH BETWEEN THIRTY SIX AND FORTY FIVE
AND TO COME BACK ON THE THE SWAPPING UH THINGS UH I DON'T THINK UH I I THINK THE YOUNGER WILL BE MOST INTEREST IN IT
UM IN THE WE ASKED THEM UH HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A S A NEW FEATURE
IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE CONTROL WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF IT
WELL HERE WE SEE THE SAME
UH WELL WE UH FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE TWO SEVERAL MARKETS AT WHICH WE CAN AIM
UH THE FIRST ARE THE YOUNGER THE AGE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND FORTY FIVE
UH THEY ARE HIGHLY INTERESTED IN THE FEATURES AS YOU CAN SEE UH HERE
NOW IF WE LOOK BACK AT THIS GRAPH WE CAN SEE THAT AMONG THE FIRST GROUP IS ABOUT UM SIXTY PERCENT
UH YEAH THE FIRST QUESTION IS UH ALSO WE HAVE TO ASK IS AT THE WHICH MARKET DO WE AIM AT
BUT WHEN USE IT UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UH GOOD THING OF SPEECH RECOGNITION
UM WELL TH UH THAT'S MY SECOND POINT
YOU CAN FIND MOST FUNCTIONS ON A T. V. SET
SO UH YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF AUDIO OPTIONS OR SCREEN OPTIONS TO CHANGE THE BRIGHTNESS
IS THAT A LOT OF USERS ALSO SAID THEN I WOULD UH BUY A GOOD LOOKING UH REMOTE CONTROL IF THERE WILL BE ONE
BUT THEY FOUND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS VERY UGLY
AND UH YEAH IT SHOULD BE VERY ZAP FRIENDLY AS MOST USERS USE IT FOR THAT
YEAH MAYBE WE CAN FIRST HAVE A DISCUSSION UH ON THE THE PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS YOU JUST UH SAID
UH NOT EVERYONE UM WHO IS LOOKING T. V. CAN GO TO INTERNET WHEN THEY WANT TO SEE THE LATEST NEWS
UH
BUT THE THEN TO SCROLL THROUGH THE MENU AND TO CHANGE THE OPTIONS
BUT WELL IF YOU AIM AT THE YOUNGER MARKET UM A AS THEY AS UH S UH AS WE SEEN IN THE USABILITY UH LAB
UH
FOR THE UH MENU WHAT DO WE USE FOR THAT
OR WE MAY HAVE TO USE CHANNEL OF THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL
YOU HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE
S OKAY
BUT THE L. C. D. IS EASY WHEN YOU USE THE SCROLL UH BUTTONS
YEAH BUT LIKE WE SAID BEFORE IT HAS TO BE USED ON EVERY TELEVISION
MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK HOW HOW MUCH IT IS FOR THE L. C. D.
IT'S UH AH LET'S SEE
NOW W WE HAVE TO DECIDE
MAYBE ONE OF YOU CAN PAINT IT ON THE BOARD
I'LL PAINT
SHAPES OR WHAT DO WE NEED
BUT WELL THERE ONE FOR THE SOUND AND ONE FOR THE CHANNELS
THAT'S TH THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT
IT'S BETTER IN
YEAH BUT AGAIN MAYBE TH HOW DO WE KNOW THE T. V. CAN HANDLE IT
OUT
UH ONE WITH A WITH A MENU AND ONE WITHOUT A MENU
UH THAT'S THE MENU
ONE
S ON AND OFF
IS IT BETTER
YEAH BUT ON THE MENU THAT'S NOT UH EASY
DOES THAT BREAK A JOYSTICK
BUT HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS
OH THE SH YEAH BUT THEN YOU CAN YOU HAVE TO USE T WITH ONE HAND
YEAH WE I THINK YOU GET IT
SO DO WE HAVE OTHER CONCEPTS
AND UH WE IF YOU USE THE L. C. D. WE HAVE TO
K YEAH BUT BUT THEN YOU HAVE IT
LIKE TH IF YOU HAVE PISTOL YOU HAVE IT SO
AND THEN YOU CAN Y
N WELL IF YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT
IF TH N WELL
AND THE BUTTONS ARE ON THE NEXT PAGE
CHECK YOUR MAIL
AND YOU WILL SEE IT
OUR UH GROUP W UH W UH WE WANT TO UH SELL OUR REMOTE CONTROLS TO
AND THEN I'LL DISCUSS WHAT MY OPINION IS ABOUT THE COSTS ABOUT UH WHAT BATTERY IS IN IT WHAT KIND OF BUTTONS ALSO
UH I THINK THE BEST OPTION IS TO USE UH THE BASIC BATTERY
OR USE UH A K UH KINETIC BATTERY LIKE UH WITHIN A WATCH
UH THE THE FORM OF THE REMOTE CONTROL I THINK IT'S ALSO NICE HAVE IT CURVED
HARD PLASTIC UH BECAUSE UH IT WON'T HAVE TO BURST UH LIKE IN THE IN ONE TIME
AND ALSO RUBBER BECAUSE THE YOUNGER PEOPLE LIKE THAT WHAT WE SEE IN THE RESEARCH
WE HAVE ONE NEW THING UH DISCOVERED
IF YOU WANNA SEE THE NEXT UH IF YOU WANNA SEE THAT CHANNEL
AND THAT'S ALSO EASY JUST W WHEN YOU HAVE A THING LIKE THIS AND YOU GET IT HERE
AND I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THOSE UH THINGS AND PEOPLE WON'T BUY IT ANY MORE
AND MAYBE IT'S ALSO THEN UH THOUGHTFUL IF WE U UH USE UH AS UM DIFFERENT KIND OF UH SHAPES FOR THE FOR REMOTE CONTROL
LIKE YOU GET A YELLOW UH REMOTE CONTROL RED ONE BLUE ONE ET CETERA
I THINK THE MAIN THING IS WE LOOK AT THE COSTS
TH THEN YOU'LL SEE IT ON THE TELEVISION
YEAH BUT L WHEN YOU SEE A MENU UH ON THE TELEVISION
IT'S LIKE YOU SEE UH ONE TO TWENTY YOU GO UH UH S SCROLL UP AND PUSH NUMBER TW TWENTY
AND THEY GO TO A UH SUPERMARKET AND BUY THEM UH FOR TWO EUROS
UH AND GE AND GET THE MOST CHEAPEST UH THING
I GOT IT ON MY SCREEN AND IT WAS UH HIGHER
I CAN UH LOOK ON MY UH
UH
NOTE THAT THE PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP CHIP
HOW W HOW WE HOW WE MAKE IT
UH
SHOULDN'T WE FIRST DISCUSS ABOUT LIKE WHAT W WE ALL
M LIKE YEAH I CAN'T DR I CAN'T DRAW IT
TH THIS UNDER IT
IT'S LIKE A GUN
AND THEN YOU ALSO CAN SCROLL UH SCROLL IN IT
BECAUSE UH FROM H HUNDRED UH REMOTE CONTROLS NINETY NINE HAVE IT
UH THEN WE HAVE IT ON THE T. V. THE MENU
UH
AH THAT'S NICE
WITH THE SCROLL THING ON LIKE THIS
WHEN YOU HAVE IT ON YOUR LEFT SIDE AND
SEPARATE MORE SEPARATE H YEAH
ON THE LEFT A SCROLL BUTTON AND ON THE RIGHT A SCROLL BUTTON
BUT WOULD IT BE EASY TO USE THEN
OH YOU MEAN LIKE THAT
UH THEN YOU CAN ALSO HAVE LIKE UH TH UM
YEAH LIKE IN A LAPTOP S UH S SOME SORT OF THING
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER WITH EASIER THI
OR NO SCROLL UH THINGS
IN DETAILS
IF WE NO OKAY SCROLL WHEEL
SO IT WILL BE UH THE ADVANCED CHIP OR THE UH REGU UH OR THE REGULAR CHIP
OR SHALL WE JUST PUT IT ON THE PISTOL THING
AND THEN JUST PUT ALSO ON L. C. D. ON IT
I USE MY THUMB
NO IF YOU HAVE LIKE UH AN UH UH A NI A UH PLAYSTATION UH GAME CONTROLLER
UH
UH FIRST I'LL UH I'LL UH DISCUSS THE BUTTONS WE JUST CHOSE UH SHOW YOU SOME SAMPLES UH
WELL WE CHOSE THE POWER BUTTON TO SWITCH THE TELEVISION ON AND OFF
THE BU UH THE MUTE BUTTON TO SWITCH THE VOLUME ON AND O ON AND OFF
THE CHANNELS BUTTONS ONE TO NINE AND UH OFF UH UH ZERO TO NINE AND THE UH BUTTON TO CHOOSE UH HIGHER CHANNELS THAN NINE
AND THE MENU MENU BUTTON TO MAN MANIPULATE THE L. C. D. UH DISPLAY
UM WELL WE SEE THE THE THE SAME UH
LIKE THERE
YEAH WELL ARROW B BUTTONS CAN BE BLUE
SOME BUTTONS HAVE ICONS LIKE THE PLAY AND STOP BUT WE DON'T USE THAT
BUT UH THESE WE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT ICONS OR OR LETTERS
I THOUGHT THAT WAS OUR UH IDEA
UH SO THE
AS WE HAVE TO UH TO TO DESIGN THE THE CASE AND THE WHOLE UH REMOTE CONTROL IN OUR UH OUR OUR CORPORATE UH COMPANY UH UH COLOURS AND THE LOGO
AND UH WELL MAYBE EACH EACH UH SET OF BUTTONS UH HAS UH HAS HIS OWN COLOUR
K SO I THINK
UH NO
UH YEAH SO GOOD UH GOOD ICONS ON THE BUTTONS AND UH AND BIG BUTTONS IS MY UH PERSONAL UH
AND YOU CAN AND YOU CAN UH MAKE THE THE POWER BUTTON AS A TRIGGER
OH LIKE A
AH
AH
NOW I HAVE MY SCREEN BACK TOO
BUT THI I UH THIS IS WITH AN L. C. D.
SO WELL HOW WE DID DO THAT
WELL TH AND THE YOUNG AND TRENDY THEY UH THEY STARTING TO LIKE UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES UH AS A THEME FOR N UH CLOTHES
WE UH AIM AT THE YOUNGER MARKET
IT IT IT MIGHT LAST ONE YEAR AND NEXT YEAR IT BE UH CAN BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT
SO WE M MUST NOT JUST ONLY LOOK AT WHAT THE TREND IS NOW AS IT MIGHT BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT NEXT YEAR
WE HAVE THIS AND WE HAD THE IDEA OF AN UM A MORE UH UH UH LIKE SH IN THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND
BUT IF WE HAVE UH A ME YEAH
M UH YEAH MAYBE IT'S BETTER IF THE UH SCROLL WHEELS ARE UM MORE SEPARATE YEAH
AND ON THE L. C. D. HOW MUCH IT COSTS
UH
UH YEAH BUT
I CAN'T SEE THE
BUT UH THE EASY OF UH TH THE EASE OF USE WASN'T UH THE MOST IMPORTANT UH ASPECT OF IT
UH
ONE
SEE YOU AT THE NEXT MEETING
ONE TIME PLEASE
SO WHAT THEY SAY ON THE SIDE IS PUT FASHION THERE
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TH IT IF IT'S OKAY
OH IT'S OKAY
ME TOO
YOUNGER G GROUP
IT'S NOT FASHION IT'S NEW
WE CAN PUT IT IN IT
I USE MY FEET THOUGH
ME TOO
ONE
SO BUT CAN IT GET LOST IF IT'S SUCH A THING
YEAH ME
SO I THINK S TWO IS BETTER
NO IT'S NEW
ME TOO
THREE
EFFORT IS THREE TEN AND TWELVE
ONE BATTERY
OR ONE
THE BUTTONS ARE REGULAR COLOUR
UH NO
UM THEN WE UH LOSE
HALF A EURO TOO MUCH
THAT'S ONE EURO
UH
OR IT'S THEN A REGULAR
AND WHAT IF WE LOSE THE L. C. D.
IS IT A GOOD DESIGN
OH NO BUT WE THEN WE GET PUSH BUTTONS FROM HALF A EURO
UH YES YES YES YES
NO SPECIAL COLOUR
SO WELL
JUST THAT ONES
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT
UH
ABOUT THE PROJECT
UP IS CHANNEL UP
TO THE RIGHT IS VOLUME UP
TO THE LEFT IS VOLUME DOWN
I THINK THE SCROLL BUTTON IS SOMETHING ALSO UH NEW
I THINK TECHNOLOGICALLY I'LL GIVE IT AN
SI SIX SIX
OH TRUE OR FALSE
OH UH I'LL I'LL GIVE IT UH A T A TWO
MAYBE VERSION UH THREE POINT O. UH HAS OTHER COLOURS
ME TOO A TWO BECAUSE ONLY THE BATTERY IS NOT UH
THREE IS OKAY
OH WE'LL WAIT OUTSIDE
ONE
AH
UH
IT WON'T GET BETWEEN UH THE PILLOWS UH ON THE COUCH
UH
ME TOO
I GAVE THIS A ONE BECAUSE OF THE RUBBER
YEAH F VERY FANCY TRENDY
I GO FOR TWO BECAUSE UH THE THE SHAPES ARE STILL ROUND
UH
SOMETHING WHAT ALSO YOUNGER PEOPLE WANT
ONE
WH
AND IF YOU SAY IT'S JUST A R UH NORMAL COLOUR IT'S A NORMAL COLOUR WH NO ONE WILL SEE IT
UH NO NO NO
UH
IF WE LOSE THE L. C. D. THEN WE HAVE AN UH REGULAR CHIP AND NO L. C. D.
UH YEAH
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO M UH SEE THE MENU ON THE TELEVISION
BUT THEN THE PRINT ON IT WILL G UM CHANGE IT
FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE WHAT BUTTON IT IS
OH WELL THAT'S CLEAR
ABOUT THE
UH
I THINK UH THE CREATIVITY UH WAS GOOD ENOUGH
AND UH NO UH O ONLY THE THE DRAWING UH WAS VERY DIFFICULT
BEER
OH THIS YOU MEAN
AND AND AND THIS TOO
SO YOU CAN STILL OPERATE UH ALL THE THINGS
OF UH YEAH AND THE MUTE AND THE THE OTHER BUTTON
UH YES
UH YES
THREE
OLDER
THEN MAKE IT TH THREE
ONE
MM THREE
I I ESPE I ESPECIALLY UH LIKED THE THE MEANS THE THE SMARTBOARD AND UH
THAT'S ON THE RUB RUBBER PART
THAT'S UH UM THAT CAN BE NONE
UH OH
UH BASED ON UM OUR MARKETING STRATEGY ON UH THE LATEST TRENDS ON USER PREFERENCES
AND ON BASE OF EACH C UH CRITERIA WE NEED TO UM GIVE A RATING
UM SO UH YOU HAVE TO THINK OF IT AS UH THE REMOTE CONTROL IS TECHNO TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
THE FIRST UH ON EACH ITEM
SO NOW I I THINK YOU UH SEE IT UM ITS STATEMENT
AND TRUE IS ONE
THE FIRST ITEM
SO OKAY THE SECOND ITEM
BECAUSE WE UH REALLY AIM UH AT AT YOUNG MARKET AND I THINK THE WAY IT LOOKED UH C UH TOTALLY IN YELLOW
UH OKAY
I UM YEAH
I THINK IF WE DO THIS AS IT'S UH UH C UH IT'S REALLY ORIENTATES ON THE DESIGN
UH OKAY
YES I'LL THINK OF THAT TOO
THE NEXT ELEMENT UM IS THE PRODUCT LOOKS GOOD
SO WELL WE GONNA DO THE NEXT PART
ONE
ONE
OKAY UM WELL WE AIMED FOR THE YOUNGER MARKET
UH YEAH DID WE ACHIEVE THAT
UH YES
I DIDN'T UH SAY IT IN MY PRESENTATION
WELL LET'S ALSO GIVE THIS A TWO
IF WE LOOKED AT THE LATEST TRENDS FOR THE UH YOUNGER PEOPLE AND THEY ATE UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
UM UH OKAY
ONE
WE WOULD HAVE UH N
IF WE HAVE THE N NO BUTTONS IF WE HAVE WE HAVE UH NOT A JOYSTICK BUT BUTTONS WE WOULD HAVE UH WE HAVE THIRTEEN EUROS
YEAH I THINK YOU HAVE TO COMPARE IT TO IF YOU WOULD HAVE A NORMAL UM NORMAL PROJECT WITHOUT LAPTOPS UH AND WITHOUT THESE DEVICES
UH MAYBE IT WILL BE EASIER IF YOU HAVE A SMALLER MONITOR AND UH YOU WOULD ALSO SEE THERE
YEAH I AGREE ON WHAT WAS SAID UH MAINLY
UH YEAH BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE TALKING MORE THAN OTHERS
AND MAYBE IS THEN UM THE TASK OF THE THE PROJECT MANAGER TO ALSO UH ASK MORE TO THE PEOPLE UH LESS TALKING
ARE YOU READY
UM I GUESS I SHOULD CLOSE IT HERE
UH RUUD IS HERE AS THE MARKETING EXPERT ROO IS HERE AS THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER AND SEBASTIAN IS HERE UH IN THE ROLE OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
IS THAT CORRECT
UH THIS MEETING SHOULD TAKE NO MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MINUTES SO WE SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND
THOSE ARE KIND OF EASY UM UH UH GOALS UM AND I'M SURE WE CAN FIND MORE GOALS FOR THE FOR THE PRODUCT WE ARE GOING TO DEVELOP
UH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THE DETAILED DESIGN UM ALL OF THESE STAGES UM UM MEAN THAT WE DO SOME INDIVIDUAL WORK
WELL IN THIS CASE CONTROL T THE THE TELEVISION I THINK
HOW EXACTLY DOES IT WORK IN THE TECHNICAL SENSE
SO WE'LL KOP IT KEEP IT WITH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
UM AS YOU SEE NOW I CAN GIVE A PRESENTATION
YOU CAN UH UH DISPLAY PR UH TWO PRESENTATIONS IF YOU WANT TO
TO UM PRESENTATE
TO SHOW US UH A FILE YOU'LL NEED TO UH PLACE IT IN YOUR PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER WHICH IS ON YOUR DESKTOP AT LEAST IT SHOULD BE
THERE ARE LITTLE UM UH SENSORS SO DO NOT GRAB IT HERE BUT A LIT MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THE UH TO THE END
WELL IT IT'S ON THE UM ERASER NOW SO WE CLICK THE PEN BUTTON
UM ALL OUR UM WHI UM UH SMARTBOARD UM NOTES SHOULD BE KEPT IN THE SAME FILE
UM YOU CAN USE THE ERASER TO
UH
I GUESS IT'S MAYBE BECAUSE I'M NOT S UH PEN SELECTED
UM SO NOW I D HAVE A DIFFERENT
UM TO UM OH WELL I'M I WROTE DOWN THE DOCUMENTS UH SHOULD BE IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER IF YOU WANT TO UH DISCUSS IT WITH US
OKAY SO UM YOU CAN USE THIS AT ANY TIME DURING THE PRESENTATION IF YOU WANT TO
UM ANY QUESTIONS WELL JUST JUST LET ME KNOW
UM WE UH WE WILL FOCUS THIS INTERNATIONALLY SO THE PRODUCT WILL BE SOLD UM
IF THERE IS MARKET UH INTEREST UH IN IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY
SO WE SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND BY UH W W DURING THE DEVELOPMENT UM BECAUSE UH WELL THOSE ARE IMPORTANT NUMBERS
OKAY SO THE THE MAIN POR UH THE MAIN POINTS YOU ARE UH TELLING US ARE FOCUS ON THE INTER UH OPERABILITY AND
UM I I DO THINK IT'S TIME NOW TO TO DISCUSS UH MM SOME THINGS
UM THERE ARE OTHER THINGS LIKE UM HOW TO MAKE IT TRENDY WHICH IS I THINK UH UM MOST UH RU UH RUUD'S UH ROLE
UM THE WAY HOW IT SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE USER WHICH IS UH ROO UH R UH DURING THIS PART
H HOW DO YOU THINK THE REMOTE SHOULD UM FUNCTION FOR THE USER
UH RUUD Y DO YOU AGREE
SO IS THAT EASE OF USE OR UH IS THAT MORE LIKE UM
OKAY GENTLEMEN UM UH JUST A REMINDER WE D WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT FOR THIS MEETING UM OKAY
OKAY S YEAH
IS THA OKAY
YEAH YEAH OKAY BECAUSE BECAUSE WE WA WE WANT TO DEVELOP A TRENDY PRODUCT
OKAY UM I HA I HAVE ONE POINT F UM WHICH WHICH COMES IN MIND NOW
UH
UM NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES AND UM WELL YOU KNOW YOUR O YOUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS OR YOUR PERSONAL COACH WILL PROBABLY EMAIL YOU ABOUT TH IT
SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
IS THERE A SCHEDULE FOR THIS MEETING
UM IS THERE ANY ROOM FOR A LITTLE PRESENTATION
YES UM I HAVE SOME TECHNICAL UH ISSUES WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU UH BEFORE WE START THE DISCUSSION
SO IF SOMEONE OF YOU COMES UP WITH UH IDEAS UH I'LL TRY TO TRANSLATE THEM IN TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS BUT UH THERE MIGHT BE SOME IMPOSSIBILITIES
SO ONE RE UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL FOR ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT
MAYBE BUT THAT'S UH SOMETHING WE SHOULD DISCUSS AND UH ABOUT EVERY EVERYBODY SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT
NO WE'RE JUST DEVELOPING THIS PRODUCT AND WE WANT TO SELL IT TO A VERY BROAD UH PUBLIC SO IT SHOULD FIT TO EVERY DEVICE
AND YOU YOU SEE UH THE BUTTONS AS A AS A MEANS OF DOING THIS
ARE THERE ONLY ANY OTHER CONT
WELL I I'VE SEEN THESE REMOTE CONTROLS WITH UH THIS LITTLE STICK UH WHICH YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD SIDEWORDS
TO TO SWITCH B UH BETWEEN UH CHANNELS OR UH CHANGE UH BETWEEN TRACKS ON A ON A C. D.
ON ON A CHAPTERS YOU KNOW ON A D. V. D. PLAYER
UH IS THAT UH ARE THERE RESTRICTION FOR THE RANGE THE OPERATING RANGE TOO
UM OH YES I REMEMBER
UH WOULD IT BE NICE FOR A USER TO HAVE DISPLAY ON THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL ON WHICH YOU CAN SEE FUNCTIONS
IT'S USE UH A LOT OF UH WELL WELL CELL PHONES HAVE UH INTEGRATED BLUETOOTH ALSO AND WELL IT'S IT SEEMS TO WORK UH QUITE OKAY
RUUD
SO WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON IT WHILE WE'RE OR SHOULD WE ONLY USE IT IN THE IN THE MEETINGS
YEAH I'M THINK ABOUT IT TOO
BUT ALL THE T. V. S ARE UH EQUIPPED WITH INFRARED SO
Y YOU YOU CAN
OR YOU SHOU SH USE A YOU SHOULD EQUIP INFRARED AND BLUETOOTH TOGETHER IN ONE REMOTE
UM WELL THE INTEROPERABILITY JUST LIKE UH SEBASTIAN SAID UM THE REMOTE SHOULD WORK ON DIFFERENT T. V. S OR EVEN DIFFERENT UH UM
UM SO I I I THINK IT'S A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL FOR CUSTOMERS TO BUY JUST NEW IN UH A STORE
IT'S NOT FOR UH FOR UH FOR UH PHILIPS OR WHATEVER TO BUY OUR REMOTE FOR THEIR OWN PRODUCT RIGHT
YEAH I DO I DON'T KNOW THAT
THAT'S JUST THE BASIC F TECHNICAL FUNCTION
WELL THAT'S JUST THE FU THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION IS PURE WHAT SHOULD THE REMOTE CONTROL DO
WH WHAT IS HIS TASK UH AS AN UH AS AN UH DEVICE
UH POINT AT A T. V. I THINK IT'S IT'S QUITE DISTURBING WHEN YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO POINT DIRECTLY TO THE T. V.
YEAH JUST DON'T EVEN POINT IT SO IN THAT CASE INFRARED SHOULD UH MAYBE UH BE RESTRICTION TO THAT
YEAH IF YOU G IF YOU GO TO RADIO OR OR YEAH
FOR T. V. YOU'RE ALWAYS IN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF A T. V. SO I DON'T THINK THINK
THE RANGE SHOULD BE A PROBLEM TO THAT BUT IF YOU WANT TO UH GET IT WORKING WITH A RADIO
AND YOU'RE IN OUTSIDE YOUR GARDEN WITH JUST ONE UH SPEAKER THEN MAYBE THE RANGE SHOULD BE UH
AND OF COURSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHERE ALL BUTTONS ARE SO IT SHOULD BE VISIBLE AL UM IN DARK TOO
THOSE ARE TWO REALLY UH USER INTERFACE
WELL MAYBE I UM BUT IT IT CAN BE QUITE SIMPLE YOU CAN JUST HAVE WHITE BUTTONS WITH A BLACK MARK ON IT
YOU HAVE A M UH
ALWAYS HAVE S THE SOFT BUTTONS ALWAYS UH
CLEAR THE THE THE PAINT ON IT
UH I THINK MOST MOST THINGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SAID LIKE UH CONTROL MULTIPLE DEVICES
THERE HE IS
UH NO
SORRY UH ROO
UM THEN UM THE THREE OF YOU UH PREPARED A PRESENTATION I THINK
ROO
RUUD
THEN WE'LL DO YOUR ONE UH UH AS LA UH THE LAST
UM THE TOP GOAL OF THIS M
UM WE WILL FIGURE THAT OUT
YEAH W WE WILL SEE
ON THE TARGET GROUP UM AND AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL SO KEEP THAT IN MIND
UM THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS FIRST OF ALL UM WE DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT BUT WE SHOULD NOT UM SUPPORT TELETEXT IN THE REMOTE
UM BECAUSE OUR B UM BOARD UH FEELS THAT UH TELETEXT IS OUT OF DATE AND INTERNET IS REPLACING TELETEXT
SO UM WE ARE NOT EVEN GOING TO TRY TO UM IMPLEMENT IT IN OUR PRODUCT
UM THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TELEVISION BECAUSE IT'S NOT UH F UH FEASIBLE
IT'S NOT UH W UH UH WE WE CANNOT MAKE IT BECAUSE OF THE TIME TO MARKET UM THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH
WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU UH RUUD AND AS WELL FOR UH ROO
THEN FOR ROO AS WELL UH IMPORTANT THE CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD BE RECOGNISABLE IN OUR PRODUCT
IS THAT CLEAR
ANY QUESTIONS ON THESE
UM THE INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS I TH UM ROO OR SEBASTIAN WHO OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START
YEAH OKAY W WE WILL S WE ALL UH
OKAY WELL WE AR WE ARE VERY CURIO CURIOUS TO WHAT THE MARKET UM WILL FEEL ABOUT SUCH A PRODUCT
BUT UH TH
UM BECAUSE YOU SE
WELL YOU SEE IT A LOT IN IN LIGHT UH LIGHTNING UH UH
YEAH M MAYBE UM W WE UH WE DO AGREE ON ON THE THING THAT THE REMOTE SHOULD HAVE SUCH A FUNCTION
IT'S AN UNI AN UNIQUE FEATURE AND UM I THINK UM IT'S WORTH UM UH LOOKING AND AND PROBABLY MORE I INTERESTING THAN UH THAN THE LIGHTS
WELL UM ACCORDING TO RUUD UM PEOPLE DO NOT USE UM ALL THE EXTRA FEATURES VERY VERY OFTEN
UH UH UH I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR THE EASIER ONE
BUT BUT ARE WE NOT IN IN THE IN THE MANUAL UH I MEAN IF YOU HAVE FEW BUTTONS NO DISPLAY
BUT BUT HOW DOES HOW DOES THE REMOTE UH REPORT UH R UH GIVE BACK TO THE USER W IN WHAT STATE IT IS
UH AND WE COULD HAVE OTHER BUTTONS FOR THE FOR THE ADVANCED UH FUNCTIONS
YEAH DRAW DRAW IT ON THE BOARD
OKAY BUT W WE STILL WE'RE STILL IN THE QUESTION OF UH UM UH PUTTING IN ADVANCED OPTIONS
UM HOWEVER UH KEEPING IT SIMPLE IS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COSTS AND ALL ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS
FOR EXAMPLE UH TH THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE VOLUME AND UH PROGRAMME SELECTING
OKAY WELL UM M MAYBE I SHOULD WRITE THAT DOWN
MIELSEN BECAUSE I I WAS WRITING IT DOWN IN THE LAST UH MIELSEN
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND IT
UH
AND AND DO WE WANT UM
YOU C YOU CAN D MAKE THEM VERY FANCY BY UM
UH
UH
WE D IT IT'S A BOARD UH DECISION
BUT BUT CAN WE MANAGE IT BU UH FOR THE COSTS
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR UM MAYBE MAYBE YOU ALL HAVE TH UH THINGS NOT UM SPOKEN ABOUT YEAH BUT THAT ARE IMPORTANT
UH RUUD YOU YOU CAME UP WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH DATA
UH ARE THERE OTHER THINGS ABOUT THE MARKET WE SHOULD KNOW
WE WE YEAH WE STILL NEED TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT THE THE BIT OLDER PEOPLE
UM ROO
NO IT'S TH YEAH
UM THE INTERFACE DESIGNER UM I WOULD LIKE TO THE NEXT MEETING I WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE THE UH COMPONENTS CONCEPT
UH ROO UM FROM YOU I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
UH
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER UH ROO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE USER INTERFACE C UH CONCEPT
IT SHOULD BE AN EASY INTERFACE WITH NOT SO MUCH BUTTONS
S JUST A A P A P A VOLUME AND A PROGRAMME ONE
I'M SURE THE MARKETING EXPERT WILL RECEIVE UH T UH YOU WILL DO SOME TREND WATCHING
IS THERE ANY TIME FOR A CUP OF COFFEE
CAN I GET A CUP OF COFFEE
WELL DURING MY WORK I HAVE NO TIME EITHER
I THINK SO TOO
UM WELL THERE ARE SOME CHANGES IN THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS SO THERE ARE SOME CHANGES IN THE METHOD ALSO
CAN YOU SEE IT
AND UM BASICALLY THERE IT'S CONNECTED TO THREE THINGS
USUALLY THESE KIND OF THINGS CONSIST OF A BATTERY INFRARED DIODE BUTTONS CHIPS AND CIRCUIT BOARD
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE W YES
UH THE BUTTONS ARE LIT
UH THERE ARE SPECIALLY UH DESIGNED UM ENERGY FRIENDLY COMPONENTS WHICH CONSUME UH FAR LESS POWER THAN UH CONVENTIONAL COMPONENTS
UM FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS WE SHOULD REALLY USE A VERY LOW COST UH CIRCUIT BOARD
UM BECAUSE MOST OF THE PRODUCTION COST ARE ARE IN THIS UH PART OF THE EQUIPMENT
UH NO THEY'RE UH THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE BUT BY UH UM UM MAKING
WELL IT'S NOT ONE LIGHT IT THERE ARE MORE LIGHTS IN A IN A IN A MOBILE DEVICE
SO WELL THIS UH SHOULD BE IT
WELL THE TECHNICAL UH THERE I THINK THERE ARE NO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES
THERE'S NO UM ELABORATE TECHNIQUE UH USED IN THIS UH KIND OF EQUIPMENT
WE DO NOT CONTROL THE T. V. SET SO WELL
YES M YES
S AND WE B WE WANT TO MAKE SO IT'S IS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS SO WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
WELL IS THERE NOT SOMETHING F SOMETHING MORE EASILY
AND Y THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR PEOPLE IS THAT THERE'S A CENTRAL POINT TO WHICH THEY CAN GO AND UH B UH PERFORM A A SOME KIND OF UH
AND THEN UH THE REMOTE CONTROL UH REPORTS ITSELF SO W WE SHOULD USE HAVE UH WE SHOULD USE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WELL I I THINK SO BECAUSE UM WHEN YOU HAVE A P NEWSPAPER OVER YOUR REMOTE CONTROL YOU CANNOT SEE IT
WELL IS IT MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER POSSIBILITY
W
WHEN YOU MOVE THE STICK TO A TO A POSITION MAYBE UH A LIGHT NEXT TO IT CAN LIT UP
SO YOU KNOW I'VE JUST UH PUSHED THE BUTTON OR I CHANGED THE CHANNEL OR T UH TURNED UP THE VOLUME
UH WHICH UH INCORPORATES ALL FUNCTION AVAILABLE ON THE DEVICE
WELL ARE ARE YOU SURE
WELL THAT'S COMPLICATED BUT IS THAT SO RELEVANT
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK BUT YOU SHOULD UH SHOU YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
BUT I THINK THESE UH TEN UH BUTTONS LOOK A BIT DULL
WELL Y THEN THERE SHOULD BE SHOULD DONE BE DONE SOMETHING SPECIFIC WITH IT
I'LL HAVE TO FIND THAT OUT
IT'S OH IT'S VERY CHEAP
SO THAT'S ONE THE THOSE ARE THE CHOICES WE HAVE TO MAKE
UM IT MAKES IT ALSO MORE UH ATTRACTABLE I THINK TO OUR UH AUDIENCE
UM THERE ARE SOME ADVANTAGES AND SOME DISADVANTAGES AND THE MAIN ADVANTAGE IS THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT UH FANCY TECHNIQUES WHICH UH I THINK OUR CUSTOMERS WILL LIKE
SO THAT'S ANOTHER WELL IT WA IT W IT WAS AN ISSUE BUT WE ALSO THOUGHT THAT WE ALREADY THOUGHT WE SHOULD DO IT AS CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE
YES I AL I I HOPE MY PERSONAL COACH WILL UH HAVE A LO UH LOOK AT IT
OR OH
OR IT IS
OH HOW CAN I UH
UH YES
UM WELL W WE UH WE HAD DISCUSSED THIS ALREADY IN THE FIN IN THE PREVIOUS UH DISCUSSION
THE MAIN UH IMPORTANT THING WHAT A REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD DO
BUT UM YOUR NEW GOAL F WAS FOR UH PEOPLE THAN LESS THAN FORTY YEARS OLD
BUT IT SHOULD B I THINK IT SHOULD BE A COMBINATION BUT TELETEXT BUTTONS ARE NOT UH IN OUR DESIGN
TAKE OUT WELL EIGHT BUTTONS OR SO
BUT MY IN MY OPINION THE THE EASY TO USE R. C. IS UH THE BEST UH POSSI POSSIBILITY FOR US
AND IT'S ALSO I INDEED UH UH RUUD'S UH INSIGHT IN THE IN THE TOPIC
AND WHAT'S THE UM IF WE USE THE LEDS I DOES IT USE MUCH MORE ENERGY OR
FOR THE SAME COSTS IT'S CAN BE UH IN OUR
YEAH I THINK IT'S THE SAME AS IN THE CELL PHONE JUST LIGHT IN IN THE DEVICE THAT THAT SHINES ON ALL THE BUTTONS AND NOT FOR
YEAH BUT NOT FOR EACH BUTTON ONE LED I THINK
COULD YOU STEP A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THE RIGHT
THE PERFECT DESIGN FOR THOSE ONLY THOSE BUTTONS
UH
BUT I BELIEVE YOU WILL HAVE AN
BUT WE CAN HAVE JUST UH UH A HOME STAT UH F A BASE STATION NEXT TO THE T. V.
WELL IF YOU LOST TH I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD BOTHER WALKING TO THE T. V. AND PRESS THAT BUTTON BECAUSE THEY LOST THE THEIR REMOTE
UH THAT'S JUST UH
JUST A BASE STATION NEXT TO THE T. V. IS THE BEST POSSIBILITY
IT WILL BE AN A UNIQUE FEATURE OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL
WHAT SHOULD WE CHOOSE IN IN DESIGN
WELL SO IT JUST TH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS
WE CAN MAKE UH A NICE DESIGN WHEN WHEN THERE'S NOT MU UH MUCH BUTTONS IN IT
BUT DOES IT UH I THEN SHOULD N JUST USE UH I INSTEAD OF THE STICK
UH LIKE MANY CELL PHONES JUST A ROUND M WELL SHOULD WE JUST USE A
UM IT'S ALREADY UH OH WE HAVE A BLANK
AND THE VOL YEAH THE PEN DOESN'T UH REALLY DOES WHAT I WANT
UH WE CAN'T DISCUSS IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE N NO ONE OF US HAVE HAS THE INFORMATION TO DISCUSS ABOUT THAT
'KAY BUT TELETEXT IS SO UH IS JUST SCRAPPED
OH AND JUST ONE FUNCTION
OUR B. S. C. UH W. UH
ON THE DESIGN
BUT THE CHEAPER THE CH UH THE THE CHIP OR TH WHAT WAS IT
THE FEWER BUTTONS YOU CAN USE ON IT
ME NEITHER
ABOUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION
UH OKAY
OH USER FRIENDLY
OF OF WHICH WE SHOULD SELL ABOUT UH FORTY PERCENT TO MAKE THE FIVE MILLION
THE BUTTONS TO ZAP ARE USED THE ABOUT UH FIFTEEN HUNDRED TIMES WHEN UH THE POWER BUTTON IS ONLY USED ONE TIME
AND UH WELL THIS OBVIOUS AND HE ALSO SAID IT
UH THAT'S ABOUT IT YES
UH MO UH ZAP BUTTONS MOST
VOLUME THEY ARE UH USE A LOT
AND B
I HAVE THE NUMBERS R I HAVE THE NUMBERS RIGHT HERE
WELL T UH WE WON'T SUPPORT TELETEXT WHICH WHICH WAS THE THIRD MOST THE SECOND MOST USED FUNCTION
AND IF YOU USE THAT STICK FOR VOLUME CONTROL AND CHANNEL UH SELECTION YOU HAVE THE M TWO MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS IN ONE UH BUTTON
AND IT'S ALSO QUITE EASY TO USE SO IT'LL IT UH ATTRACT YOUNGER PEOPLE BECAUSE WELL NEW AND IT MIGHT ATTRACT OLDER PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO USE
WELL IF YOU WANT TO GO TO CHANNEL NINETY AND YOU HAVE TH THAT BUTTON
AND UM THERE ARE SOME NUMBERS ABOUT UH SPEECH RECOGNITION HERE THAT UH YOUNGER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT
FOR
SO THEN WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT SUCH A BUT
M
WANT TO SELL TO
SO WE WE SHOULD UH FOR LEAST A BIT UH LOOK AT THE UH OLDER PEOPLE
BUT WITH UH BUTTONS LIKE THAT WHICH ARE EASY TO USE WE UH MIGHT ATTRACT THEM TOO
IS IT MUCH CHANGES
OH IT'S THAT ROO AGAIN ALWAYS LATE
UM I HAVE SOME POINTS I WOULD LIKE TO UH SOME SOME ISSUES I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT
UM FIRST OF ALL UM IF YOU MAKE MINUTES YOURSELF AS WELL UH LIKE SEBASTIAN DOES UM COULD YOU PUT THEM ON THE SHARED FOLDER
IF YOU DO NOT MAKE MINUTES NO PROBLEM BUT IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SEE WHAT YOU UH WROTE DOWN
SO I COULD UH CAN UH UM USE THAT IN THE IN THE REPORT
I WAS TH UH S THINKING TO MYSELF I HAVE THIS LITTLE REMOTE CONTROL
AND I'M TALKING TO IT BUT I STILL NEED TO POINT TO THE TELEVISION BECAUSE IT WORKS WITH INFRARED
UM WE WI WE WILL HAVE YOUR INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS UH THEN THE DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPT UM AND UH THE CLOSING
UH W WAIT A SEC WAIT A SE UH COULD YOU GO TO THE PREVIOUS SLIDE
OKAY SO SO YEAH IT MIGHT NOT BE T UH IT IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD
YEAH IT IS IT IS I YEAH
IT'S THE SIEMENS UH C. TWENTY FIVE I BELIEVE IT'S IT'S THE ONE THE POST BANK UH GAVE AWAY THE VERY
ABOUT TH
UM UH OKAY
DO YOU HAVE UH THIT THAT WAS OKAY
OKAY SO THE THE M UH IMPORTANT FINDINGS ARE UH INNOVATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EASE OF USE FOR THE OUR TARGET GROUP
OKAY ROO
AND WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT MAYBE UM WE SHOULD MAKE VERY LIGHT BUT UM UH A GRIP UM I MEAN THIS IS HOW YOU HOLD A REMOTE CONTROL
UM IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO UH GLATT TOO SLIPPERY S BECAUSE UM
I THINK UM IF IF I CAN HOOK ON TO THAT UM THE KINETIC THING IS VERY FUNNY
I MEAN SOLAR IS OF COURSE IT'S NICE BUT IT'S WELL YOUR UH YOUR CALCULATOR HAS A SOLAR PANEL
WELL MAYBE M
AND WHA
THI I I M I GUESS UH TH THIS IS MY VOLUME BUTTON
AND I CAN EITHER ON THIS SIDE OR THIS SIDE UM
AND AND IT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM THE TRADITIONAL UH DEVICES ON THIS MARKET
SO I'M LOOKING FOR A WAY TO
BUT ON THEIR SIDE TH THE THE VOLUME BUTTON IS ON THE SIDE BECAUSE YOU GRI GRAB IT LIKE THIS
FOR YOU TOO YEAH
TO
OKAY TH
THAT'S NO DIFFERENT
NO R RUBBER WITH COLOURS
OKAY WHAT ABOUT UM THE ISSUE I UM ADDRESSED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING
IT DEPENDS ALSO ON YOUR ON YOUR
BUT IF YOU HAVE CARPETS ON THE WALL WHICH OUR NATURAL LOVING FRIENDS PROBABLY DO HAVE
I LIKE THE SCROLL WHEELS UH IDEA
WELL IT LOOKS UH YEAH WELL UM ACCORDING TO RUUD THE THE THE MARKET LIKES UM NEW FLASHY TECHNOLOGY
AND I MEAN L. C. D. IS WELL OK I KNOW BUT IT'S M IT'S LESS UM S STANDARD THAN THAN
WELL WE ARE NOT VERY W WE DO NOT KNOW UH MUCH ABOUT THE THE F THE FINANCIAL PART
I THINK I RUUD DO YOU HAVE ANY UM ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO
UM ADD OR OR MAYBE THOUGHTS OR
SEBAST UH NEE ROO
ROO DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER
SO UM ON THE ENERGY WELL WE DECIDED
THE CASE UH RUBBER WITH UH C ONE ONE UH ONE CURVE
I GUESS THAT IS SOMETHING FOR ROO AND SEBASTIAN
AND UM THE BUTTONS WELL WE TALKED ABOUT IT NOW
THE NEXT PHASE UM SEBASTIAN UM IS UM THE DESIGN OF THE LOOK AND FEEL
UM AND UH THE I. D. AND THE U. I. D. NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE PROTOTYPE DRAWING ON THE SMARTBOARD
UM MAYBE ONE OF YOU COULD WRITE IT DOWN
UH YOU YOU NEED TO HELP ME
UH AL AL I UH
OKAY UM TH
UH I MEAN TH UH I THINK THESE COLOURS ARE REALLY WHAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR
IT SHOULD BE A FULL COLOUR COVER WITH SUCH AN IMAGE OR OR I MEAN THINKING IN TWO COLOURS IS IS TOO BLACK AND WHITE FOR OUR M UH C UH MARKET GROUP
UM MORE F MORE MORE DECISIONS WE MADE
UH IS THAT UH DOES OUR OUR SUPPLIER SAY SO
BUT IT'S INTO THE RUBBER
YEAH BUT THIS IS ON THE PLA YEAH I KNOW
WELL ACTUALLY WE SHOULD HAVE IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND I GUESS
THIS IS UM WHAT'S ON THE EDGE
ON WHICH THE THE BUTTONS ARE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RUBBER
UM I GUESS YOU TWO HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT
AND UM YEAH Y YOU HAVE THE MOST KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SUPPLIERS THE POSSIBILITIES AND UH SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT THE DECISION WITH YOU
YEAH UM IF YOU WRITE WROTE ANYTHING DOWN UH COULD YOU PUT IT ON THE SHARED FOLDER
HAS IT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT UH NATURAL FEELING ALSO DO YOU THINK
OH THAT ONE YES
NOW I KN UH OH I KNOW I KNOW
SO SO EASE OF USE IS IMPORTANT BUT TECHNOLOGY IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT
SO M
AND OF COURSE I USED THE WEB TO UH FIND MY INFORMATION
ABOUT THE CASING WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT CASING POSSIBILITIES
UH THAT'S THE MOST COMMON UH REMOTE CON CONTROL FORM UH WE'RE USED TO IS JUST A IT JU IT'S JUST A BOX
IT'S UH CURVED IN TWO DIMENSIONS
IT'S QUITE DARING TO TO USE I THINK
WE CAN USE PLASTIC WHICH IS UH VERY SLIPPERY AND MAYBE NOT SO NICE
AND THESE LATEX CASES THERE'S THERE'S JUST THE PLASTIC ONES UH WON'T ALLOW THE USE OF SOLAR CELLS AS AN ENERGY SOURCE SOURCE
SO UM WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. UH OR WHEN YOU'RE YOU YOU HAVE TO UM MAKE SOME KIND OF ENERGY KINETIC ENERGY BY SHAKING THE REMOTE OR THROWING IT AGAINST THE WALL
IT HAVE IT IT HAS TO MOVE THAT'S THE THE SENSE OF IT
AND YOU CAN STORE THE ENERGY IN THE IN THE THING
SO I THINK UH YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVIE AND UH YOU HAVEN'T MOVED THE REMOTE UH I REMOTE CONTROL IN A IN AN AMOUNT OF TIME
AND YOU WANT T TO SWITCH UH THE CHANNEL OR SOMETHING WELL M IT MIGHT NOT WORK
SO BUT MAYBE MAYBE THERE'S A POSSIBILITY COM TO COMBINE IT WITH M UH TRADITIONAL BATTERIES
SO WE CAN SAVE ON THE BATTERIES AND UM WHEN THERE'S ENOUGH KINET KINETIC ENERGY USE THE KINETIC ENERGY AND OTHERWISE USE THE BATTERIES
UH YES IT DOES
AND THESE SCROLL WHEELS CAN ALSO BE INTEGRATED WITH BUTTONS
WHICH MEANS UH YOU CAN WATCH UH IN A DISPLAY W WHICH CHANNEL YOU HAVE CHOSEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF THE LI AMOUNT OF VOLUME WHICH IS UH CURRENTLY UH AND WE ALSO HAVE DOUBLE SCROLL BUTTONS
THE THE THING WITH THE THE ROUND WITH THE FOUR
THAT IS POSSIBLE TOO
WELL MAYB UH WELL M ME NEITHER
UH IT'S DO IT'S DONE BEFORE
WELL IT'S IT WELL I WHAT HE MEANS IS THERE'S AN BUTTON INTEGRATED IN THE SCROLL WHEEL
THERE'S NO SCENARIO WHERE YOU USE UH THE BUTTON IN THE SCROLL WHEEL
YOU JUST USE THE WHEEL
ABOUT MUTE
WELL IT'S IT'S BEEN DONE YEARS AGO AND I DON'T SEE IT ANYWHERE NOW
SO MAYBE IT'S NOT NO
UH SOMETHING FOR UH ROO HERE
WI WITHIN REACH
OKAY UM WE HAVE TO KNOW IF YOU WANT TO USE UH THESE RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED C UH CASE UM YOU MUST USE THESE PUSH UH PUSH BUTTONS
THERE'S THERE ARE NO UH FLAT AREAS WHERE YOU CAN INCORPORATE THESE THINGS
ABOUT UM THE COMPONENTS UH JUST THE HARDWARE
WE BASICALLY HAVE UH THREE TYPES OF CHIPS WE CAN USE AND UH THESE CHIPS INCORPORATE ALL THE LOGICA AND UM UM UH HARDWARE THAT IS NEEDED TO SEND UH TO SEND A SIGNAL
NO IT'S NOT IN HERE
AND IF WE DON'T WANT TO USE UH ANY OF THESE UH MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS WE CAN KEEP WITH THE SIMPLE UH CHIP WHICH IS A BIT CHEAPER
UM NO BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING FOR UH ROO HERE
I I DON'T THINK EITHER
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED IT
I THOUGHT UM THE MARKET WOULD LIKE UH A SORT M SORT OF TITANIUM CASING BUT THEY SEEM TO LIKE NATURAL UH STUFF
IT'S IN IN IN SOME WAY IT CAN GIVE US AN ADVANCE BECAUSE YOU WILL SAVE ON YOUR BATTERIES
OKAY UM WELL UM THESE SCROLL WHEELS I THINK UH THEY THEY CAN BE THEY CAN BE HANDY
BUT THEY REALLY NEED THE REGULAR CHIP YOU CANNOT USE THE SA SIMPLE
I DON'T THINK C OUR CUSTOMERS WILL LIKE IT
IT'S IT'S UH I UH I CAN IMAGINE IT'S VERY DULL TO TALK TO A DEVICE W IF YOU HAVE TO POINT TO ANOTHER DEVICE
WELL THE THERE HAS TO BE SOME POINTING AT
SO IT HAS AN IT'S EASIER
IT'S NOT VERY FLASHY AND NEW
UH THE N THE NEXT PHASE WILL BE UM
THE UM NOT THE WHAT IS THE NEXT PHASE F FLORES
SO YOU WILL BE ON THE BAHAMAS
UH
W START WITH THE CASING
OH I THINK IT'S UH IT'S NOT VERY DULL
OKAY BUT UH I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO PRINT A PICTURE ON UH THE DEVICE
BECAUSE UH I AGREE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON THE DEVICE ITSELF
YES BUT OUR MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT IS NOT SO ADVANCED IN ITS UH TECHNIQUES
AND TH THE THEY SHOULD BE SPONGY ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE RUBBER TOO
WELL UH YOU CAN USE WELL WHEN YOU USE THE BUTTONS THEY'LL THEY'LL BE MADE OF RUBBER TOO
SO IT HAS TH THE SPONGY UH FEEL ALSO
SO IF YOU WANT THE SPONGY FEEL YOU NEED UH TO MAKE THESE BUTTONS ALL ALL OF RUBBER
I DO
UH
WELL THEN I SUGGEST THAT THE CORPORATE COLOURS ARE GREY AND YELLOW
OR WE COULD MAKE OH
WELL I DON'T HA REALLY HAVE MUCH TO ADD UM BECAUSE MOST OF THINGS WE ALREADY SAID IN UH
UH THE PREVIOUS IDEAS WERE VOICE RECOGNITION AND UH THE ROUND BUTTON FOR UH THE P CHANNEL PROGRAMMING AND UH VOLUME
WELL A FEW INTERFACE I UH I FOUND ON THE INTERNET ARE ARE THESE
THESE ARE BOTH WITH UH WITH VOICE RECOGNITION BUT THEY'RE VERY ADVANCED AND VERY HIGH TECH AND JUST UM WELL A WEIRD UM
SO I SUGGEST I COULDN'T UH I HAD A SMALL UH MOCK UP UH SIGN ON THE ON PAPER
SO I MADE A REALLY SIMPLE F UH A SHAPE ON UH IN UM
SO IT'S EASY IN YOUR HAND UH INDEED
OH AND UM TO ADD ON UM RUUD'S INFORMATION IN THIS UM INTERFACE WE CAN HAVE UH HIGH TECH WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND UH
WELL THE THE FANCY COLOURS AND UH AND SO ON AND STILL HAVE THE EASE OF USE BECAUSE WE HAVE AN EASY INTERFACE
AND ALL THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS ARE HIGH TECH IN BUTTONS AND UH AND SO ON
BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVIE HOW MANY TIMES UH YOU TAKE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL AND AND IF UH IF YOU HAVE A WATCH
YOU HAVE THE KINETIC UH IDEA IN A WATCH ALSO
YOU YOU WALK AND UH BUT UH YOU YOU'RE SITTING ON A COUCH
OH WE CAN JUST MAKE FOUR PUSH BUTTONS IN A FORM OF A ROUND
BUT I TH I DON'T THINK UH THE SCROLL WHEELS I HAD SOME I HAD SOME INFORMATION ABOUT IT TOO
I D I CAN'T SEE UH ANY UH SCENARIO WHERE YOU WOULD USE A SCROLL WHEEL WITH A BUTTON ON IT
THINK ABOUT A SCENARIO WHERE Y WHERE YOU WOULD USE THE SCROLL BUTTON FOR
YEAH I BELIEVE UH IF YOU HAVE UH WHAT WE'VE EARLIER SAID UM THE GRIP UH PLACES IN IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
YOU HAVE YOUR HAND ON ONE PLACE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL SO YOU HAVE TO PLACE ALL THE BUTTONS IN A RANGE OF YOUR THUMB
SO IN THAT CASE UH THE VOLUME BUTTON ON THE SIDE UH OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE PERFECT
YOU M MUTE AND YOU G YOU GIVE UM AN UH AN ACTION TO IT THAT THAT'S REALLY THE MUTE FUNCTION AND UH WHEN YOU SPEAK IN THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH AND THEN UH HE HE REPEATS ITS ACTION WHAT WHICH HE BELIEVES IT IS
BUT I DON'T THINK INFORMATION UH Y I DON'T THINK YOU NEED IT ON A DISPLAY
UH WANTS COLOURFULS
OKAY BUT WE ALSO UH WE ALREADY NEED THE REGULAR CHIP FOR THE SAMPLE UH SENSOR SPEAKER OH EVALU
WELL IF YOU IF YOU TAKE YOUR HAND BEFORE IT OKAY IT WON'T WORK BUT YOU CAN POINT IT JUST TO THE OTHER WALL
THINK SO TOO
UM NO
UH BUT UH CAN'T SCROLL WHEELS UH WORK WITH ONE UH ONE CURVED CASE
BUT CAN THERE BE UH WOR CAN THEY WORK TOGETHER
BUT YOU HAVE ALREADY UM YOU MUST HAVE A RED UH ON AND OFF BUTTON
WHAT I SAID IN THE IN THE FIRST UH DISCUSSION UH THE DIGIT SIX ON THE BUTTON IT WILL DISAPPEAR WHEN IT'S FROM RUBBER
IT IS NOT UH SOMETHING UH IT'S NO INFORMATION I READ ABOUT IT OR SO BUT IT'S JUST FROM
SO STILL THEN IF YOU FEEL UH LI UH IF YOU FEEL YOUR REMOTE CONTROL YOU JUST RUB ON THE COVER SO YOU RUB ON THE PAINTING
YEAH BUT BUT THE THE PLUS OR THE MINUS
YEAH IT'S ON THE COVER
Y UH CAN YOU SEPARATE THESE UH THESE
I DO
USE WITH
UH YEAH
OOP
UH
EASE OF USE IS IMPORTANT BUT UH INNOVATION IS MORE IMPORTANT AND A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL IS UH EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
WELL UH ONE EXAMPLE GIVEN WAS THIS SO UM I ASSUME THEY JUST WANT SOMETHING COLOURFUL
UH
UH THAT'S ABOUT IT
UH WELL IT'S OBVIOUS OBVIOUSLY NEW
AND YEAH THE YEAH THE OLDER PEOPLE LIKED WOOD
NO THE
NAH UM N NO I DON'T THINK SO
M
UH DIDN'T DID WE INC UH INCLUDE THE DIGI DIGITS OR UH LEAVE THEM TO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
COULD COULD I SEE THE SCROLL BAR AS UH AS AS A SORT OF SHORTCUT
A A AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION AS WELL TH MAYBE YOU COULD UH COULD UH
M UH YEAH
M M BUT MAYBE YOU DO WANT A PROGRAMME BUTTON TO UH FOR EXAMPLE ACTIVATE THE VOICE RECOGNITION OR TRAIN THE VOICE VOICE RECOGNITION
YEAH AL ALTHOUGH BY PRESSING THE BUTTON FOR I N DON'T KNOW TWO THREE SECONDS
YOU COULD ALSO SAY IT YOU'D DISABLE IT WITH A LITTLE BEEP AND AND BUT O OKAY THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
OKAY SO THIS THESE ARE THE CR UH THE CRITERIA
THE THEN WE'LL SWITCH TO MY PRESENTATION
AND WHAT MAKES IT VERY EXPENSIVE IS UH FOR EXAMPLE THE SOLAR CELL
YEAH THE THE PRICE THE THE NUMBER OF ITEMS AND THE THE SUM
UM BY NOT USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE BECAUSE IT'S UH IT'S A FOUR EURO UH ADDITION TO THE PRICE
I I GUESS IF WE LEAVE THE IF WE LEAVE THIS ONE OUT UM OH
AND UH MAYBE NOT USE THE SPECIAL FORM
MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT AN UH FOCUS ON ANOTHER UH
YEAH M UH MAYBE NOT NOT ALL THAT FANCY BUT JUST WAY WAY MORE EASY UH UH UM BASIC AND UH M MAXIMISE THE PROFITS AND UM
BUT WE COULD STILL MAKE UH A REMOTE CONTROL THAT AP UH UM APPLIES UM MORE TO YOUNG PEOPLE UH BY GIVING IT ANOTHER COLOUR ALREADY
DEFINITELY NOT NO
OH THIS IS THE WRONG ONE
WE DO NOT HAVE THE TIME O UH NOW TO TO REDESIGN THE PRODUCT
I D IT IS IT IS
YOU LIKE THE RUBBER UH ROO
THREE
WHA WH WHAT WOULD BE YOUR GUESS
I MEAN EASE OF USE UM DOES NOT ONLY APPLY TO THE MOST BASIC FUNCTIONS
IS THE DEVICE EASY TO USE
UH ROO A THREE
RUUD
ROO
OKAY BUT IF I WOULD SAY A THREE THEN IT'S SIX AND FOUR IS TEN
DIVIDED BY FOUR IS TWO POINT FIVE
DOES IT WILL SO IT WILL BE A TWO POINT FIVE
I HAVE A VETO
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CONTENT IT'S ABOUT OKAY UM IS IT EASY TO F
BECAUSE WE NEED TO GO ON IN FOR THE TIME
SO YOU PLACE A A REGULAR UH REMOTE CONTROL IN FRONT OF THE OTHER ONE HIT THE ONE OR THE TWO OR THE THREE
FOR FOR THE FOR THIS T UH TYPE OF MARKET I THINK IT'S A ONE
THE PRODUCT IS IS IS UH B HIGH QUA UH HAS A HIGH QUALITY AND AND IS UH ADVANCED
WHETHER OR NOT OUR CLIENTS ARE ARE UM WILLING TO PAY TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR THIS KIND OF DEVICE IS DOUB IS WELL IS NOT SURE
D DO YOU AGREE
BU BUT WELL YEAH I KNOW BUT YOU'RE PAYING FOR TH FOR THE BRAND
ABOUT THE PROJECT ITSELF NOT ABOUT THE PRODUCT
RUUD
ANY ANY OTHER UH ROO
ROO
OKAY ROO
RUUD
I THINK SO TOO IT'S IT'S IT'S UH OF COURSE A LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT
I MISSED IT UM TO BE ABLE TO CONTACT YOU IN BETWEEN AND UH SAY UH HEY ROO UH
YEAH BUT BUT SI UH W W W WHEN TAKEN IN ACCOUNT THE THE SITUATION UH I THINK WE PERFORMED PRETTY WELL
UH
UH YEAH
I THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE A HANDY UH THING ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE UM O. C. R.
WHAT W UH RUUD WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE SMARTBOARDS
I MISSED A FEATURE TO EASILY SELECT UH A SLIDE AND UH DISTRIBUTE IT TO THE LAPTOPS
OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND THAT YOU COULD SHOW BUT M
I KNOW BUT WE COULDN'T USE THAT FEATURE SO I MISSED IT
AT LEAST THE UM I WASN'T EXPLAINED HOW TO DO SUCH A TH
OKAY SO Y IT IT'S NOT EVEN AS ADVANCED AS PAINT
UH NO
PRIVATE ROOM ROO
NO LET'S FIND UH THE WAY TO
M YEAH TEN OR FIVE
UH I WOULD LIKE TO
UM NOVICE USERS U USE THIS DEVICE AS UH NORMAL USERS USE UH A C A REMOTE CONTROL
AND AFTER A WHILE THEY START TO DEVELOP UH SOME SKILLS IN THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION FUNCTIONS AND THEN THEY WILL NOT USE THIS DIAL AS OFTEN
BUT OTHER USERS WHO ARE NEW TO THIS DEVICE NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S ANOTHER APPROACH IT'S MORE THAT OUR UM
THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF DOING UH THINGS UH ON SUCH A DEVICE
WHATEVER COST UH COST UH THE LEAST
YES BUT IT BUT THESE ARE TASKS THAT ARE ONLY EXECUTED ONCE I THINK
IS IT SPONGY
I BELIEVE IT'S FANCY TOO
BECAUSE WE USE SPEC UH SPECIC UH SPECIAL MATERIALS THE LAST ITEM
AND YOU HAVE NOT ADDED ONE ITEM THERE
WELL B BASICALLY IT WHEN WHEN THIS IS OUR ONLY OPTION WE SHOULD EVEN CONSIDER CHANGING THE CASING
TYPE OF M MAYBE ANOTHER MARKET SEGMENT
MAYBE WE COULD UH WE SHOULD GO FOR STRAIGHT AND SIMPLE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT UH HAS BEEN ASKED
WELL MAYBE IT'S GOOD TO DO IT ANYWAY BECAUSE IF WE EVALUATE IT WE WE CAN ALSO DETERMINE IF OUR OBJECTIVES ARE GOOD
IS IT FANCY
I THINK UH I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FANCY IF WE USED THE TITANIUM HOUSING THE CASING
IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE OH YOU REALLY LIKE TITANIUM
I'M I'M INTO IT
YOU SHOULD TASTE IT
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE FANCY BUT WE DECIDED NOT TO BECAUSE IF WE USE A DOUBLE CURVED CASE WE COULD NOT USE SOLAR
YES I AGREE TOO
WHEN YOU HAVE A MORE ADVANCED ELABORATE USER WELL SUCH A USER REALLY WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE ALL THESE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS
SO IN THAT IN THAT WAY IT IS ADVANCED
IT'S MAYBE IT'S NOT VERY UH EASY FOR
YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT BUT I I GUESS UH AN ADVANCED USER WILL WILL FIND THE VOICE RECOGNITION FUNCTION EASY TO USE
BECAUSE HE IS ALREADY HE OR SHE IS ALREADY AN ADVANCED USER
SO IT'S TWO TWO AND THREE
NO TWO AND A HALF
SIX AND FOUR
SIX AND FOUR IS TEN
DIVIDED BY FOUR IS TWO AND A HALF
BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO FILL IN SO WE HAVE TO ROUND IT
IT IT MOST DEFINITELY IS IT'S VERY EASY
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO UH PROGRAMME IT ONCE SO TO THAT L RESPOND TO UH A CERTAIN WORD OR A CERTAIN SENTENCE
THERE ARE CASES UM IN WHICH THE OUTSIDE CASING IS UM CAN BE UH HOW D HOW DO YOU PRONO IS IS MOLDABLE
NO IT'S NOT ONE OF OUR OPTION BUT WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MARKET WHEN YOU LOOK
UH YES BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT UH WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT I THINK
AT AT LEAST UH FORTY BUTTONS
SO IT'S IT'S QUITE S COMPLICATED TO GET UH TO GET USED TO
AND THIS IS QUITE S SIMPLE
M ABOUT FIFTY EUROS
AND IT'S EASIER TO USE BECAUSE THOSE UH REMOTE CONTROLS DON'T OFFER VOICE RECOGNITION AND THIS ONE DOES
WE HAD WE HAD TOO LITTLE INFORMATION ACTUALLY
W WAY TOO THE THE CHOICE OF COMPONENTS WAS WAY TOO NARROW
I THINK WE'RE A GOOD TEAM
I THINK SO TOO
UH
I I THINK SO TOO
I ONLY THINK IT'S TH THE THE SHAPE OF THE PEN IS TOO BIG
OH VERY GOOD CELEBRATION
BUT UM HOW MUCH TIME DID WE GET FOR THIS MEETING
IT'S A GIRAFFE EATING A EATING LEAVES FROM A TREE
THAT'S THE SAME AS UH ON THE TOP OF IT UH WITH THE THE ROUND UH BUTTON
BUT UH WE DON'T UH WE DON'T UH WE DO THINK IT'S UM WELL WHAT IF WITH EASE OF USE
SO JUST WALK THROUGH IT STEP BY STEP
WHY DOES THE PRICE AND AND THE S OH ONE UH EXA YEAH
AND A PLASTIC B JUST PLASTIC BUTTONS A PLAS UH INSTEAD OF RUBBER
I'M INTO IT
LOOKING AT THE USER UH NEEDS WE ONLY UH DON'T WE DON'T HAVE THE DOUBLE CURVED CASE
WE W WE DO HAVE UH THE RUBBER WE DO HAVE THE COLOURS
THAT'S TWO OUT OF THREE
SO I BELIEVE UH WE ARE CLOSE UH TO TWO
BUT THAT'S NOT IN IT
AND THE SCROLL UH WHEEL
IF YOU MAKE IT A FOUR IT WILL BE THREE IN GENERAL
IF HE MAKES IT A FOUR
NEE
YEAH YOU HAVE A TWO HE HAS A TWO
THREE
NEE
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE CONCLUSION AS A THREE THREE
YEAH WE HAVEN'T RE UH RE UH REALLY WORKED IT OUT BUT YOU C YOU CAN YOU CAN JUST SAY FIND AND HE REPEATS FIND
ME TOO
SO IN THE IN
YEAH BUT IT HA DOESN'T HAS THE DIGITS
PRODUCTION COST WAS WERE T UH WAS TWENTY TWO
AN ORIGINAL REMOTE CONTROL OF ANY T. V. KIND UH A PHILLIPS REMOTE CONTROL Y YOU PAY UH
BUT W UM WE WEREN'T AWARE OF THE PRICES OF THE COSTS
I IF WE KNEW THAT BEFORE WE C WE COULD HAVE MADE THE THE CHOICE BETWEEN WHAT YEAH
IT'S UH THE DRAWING ON ON THE B ON THE BOARD IS R RIGHT FROM THE PEN
YOU TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT THAT YOUR YOU M YEAH UH
IF IT HAS O. C. R. UH I THINK UH I WOULD USE BUT UH I I JUST UH TOOK NOTES FOR MYSELF AND AND AND THAT'S IT
I TYPE FASTER THAN I WRITE
BUT Y YOU CAN IF YOU SAVE THIS IMAGE YOU CAN OPEN IT IN YOUR SHARED WORK FOLDER
A AND THE FUNCTION OF OF FILLING AN AN UH AN OVAL OR AN AN OBJECT
OH IT LOOKS LIKE PAINT ACTUALLY
BUT YOU SEE THE PROBLEM Y YOU CAN'T CONTINUE YOUR UH YOUR LINE
WELL YOU COULD USE TWO OF THEM TO PROGRAMME THE UM CHANNELS ON THE TWO CHANNEL BUTTON 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO ASSIGN TWO CHANNEL NEW CHANNELS
UH MY NAME IS NOT NAME BUT
UH WELL I USED THE THE UH DOCUMENTS
AND THESE UH
UH
IS IT
IS IT FANCY
SO UH ONE
IS IT UH
AND W YEAH W WHAT THEY WANT WANTED WAS UH COLOURS AND SOFT MATERIALS
SO IN THAT WAY
OKAY AND UH WAS IT
IS IT EASY TO USE
IS IT EASY TO FIND
WELL THE BASIC LAYOUT DOESN'T OFFEM OFFER MUCH BUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION COULD ADD A LOT
SHOULD BE ABOUT ONE POINT S SEVEN YEAH
YE
OH I ONLY USE IT TO DRAW A RABBIT SO CAN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT IT
NO OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND
AND NO ADDED VALUE
IN INTERESTING DESIGN
OH UH IT IT DOES UH HAVE A NATURAL UH FEELING
THIS IS OUR FIRST TEAM MEETING
WELL OF COURSE WE'RE NEW TO EACH OTHER SO I'D LIKE TO GET ACQUAINTED FIRST
OH LET'S KICK IT OFF
SO OUR NEW PROJECT IS ABOUT WE NEED DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROL FOR TELEVISION SET SO WHICH HAS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
I TOOK THIS OFF OUR CORPORATE WEBSITE
SO APPARENTLY WE NEED TO UM BE VERY AT UM VERY OPEN TO WHAT'S CURRENTLY HOT IN THE MARKET
UH
EVERY MEETING WE EVERYBODY CAN PRESENT THEIR UH THEIR VIEWS AND EVERYTHING SO TO HELP WITH THESE YOU HAVE WE HAVE THE SMARTBOARDS HERE
THAT'S IT YOU JUST PUT IT ON THE BOARD
YOU SEE A PEN HERE
SO I'LL TAKE THIS OUT
WE'LL USE THAT LATER
YEAH JUST JUST JUST STUFF THAT YOU WANNA SHARE JUST PUT IT IN THE IN THE PROJECT FOLDER LIKE I PUT MY PRESENTATION NOW
I'LL PUT THE THE MINUTES OF EVERY MEETING I'LL PUT THEM THERE TOO SO EVERYBODY CAN READ UP IF THEY HAVE TO LEAVE EARLY OR WHATEVER
WHAT DO YOU LIKE
OKAY SO IT'S JUST A BEE
SO I SUGGEST YOU MAKE US THE ELEPHANT IN THE MARKET
ON TO THE NEXT ONE
WHAT DOES IT WANT
ANT
DO EVERYTHING TO UH REALLY SMALL BUT TOGETHER THEY'RE REALLY STRONG
THINK IT NEED SHOES
LIKE YOU TAKE JUST TAKE YOUR FREEDOM AND USE A A TRENDY INTERFACE THAT YOU DESIGN FOR US
SEE
WELL I GUESS WE HAVE A LITTLE LITTLE TIME EXTRA BUT JUST A LITTLE QUICK DISCUSSION TO TO OPEN OPEN OUR WORK
WHAT ARE Y WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST IDEAS FOR THE NEW PRODUCT
OH THIS IS IT
SORRY I SKIPPED THIS SHEET
ABOUT UH MARKETING TRANSFER WHATEVER
OKAY WELL THE ANIMAL I'D LIKE TO DRAW IS A TIGER
I'M NOT SURE HOW THE LEGS SHOULD GO BUT
UH WELL BASICALLY UH IT HUNTS FOR PREY BUT IT DOES IT ALWAYS IN A VERY WELL THOUGHT WAY
AND I THINK UH THOSE THINGS WE CAN USE
ONLY ONE THING UH THAT HAS TO BE ADDED ACCORDING TO ME IS UH THE THE MATERIAL IT IS MADE OF IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIGHT
WELL I'M MORE INTO THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF DRAWING SO I'M NOT REALLY GOOD AT DRAWING ANIMALS BUT UH THE ANIMAL WHICH I OH
PEN
UH FORMAT
ELSE MY ANIMAL WILL BE LIKE KING SIZE
BIT LOW RESPONSIVE THOUGH
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE A DOLPHIN BUT THEN AGAIN THIS IS ALL NEW FOR ME
DO THAT IN MY SPARE TIME SO THAT'S BASICALLY AN
YOU PICKED A HARD ONE DIDN'T YOU
GOT IT
IS IT JUST THE T. V. OR DO WE WANT TO IN
OH A BLANK
FREE I LIKE THE ELEPHANT
IT'S BIG IT'S STRONG SO UH UH OH IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OH YOU HAVE TO P PRESS IT PRETTY HARD
I WILL BEAT THE DOLPHIN
UH YEAH
UH
UH
UM ABOUT WHAT
UM NO NOT REALLY YET BUT I'VE SOME IDEAS AND I WILL UH
SAY IT UH
UH
SEE SHALL WE WAIT
UH NO PROBLEM
WE'RE ABOUT TO START SO HAVE A SEAT
OKAY THAT WAS JUST TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER HAVE A LITTLE THOUGHTS ON WHAT YOUR VISION IS AND ON THIS PROJECT SO
I PUT THE MINUTES ON THE I MADE ON THE ON THE P THE THE PROJECT SHARE SO IF YOU WANNA REVIEW THEM THEY'RE THERE
I WILL DO SO AFTER EVERY MEETING SO IF YOU HAVE SOME INFORMATION YOU WANNA TAKE BACK YOU CAN FIND IT THERE
YOU SHOULD CLOSE IT ON YOUR OWN NOTEBOOK I GUESS
IF I CAN CUT IN IS IT PEOPLE OR MEN
IS IT PEOPLE OKAY
SO WE HAVE TO S WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
THAT SOUNDS TOO IT'S POSSIBLE BUT UH I THINK IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT DO CONTINUE
OKAY YOU DON'T SET IT YOURSELF IT JUST REMEMBERS THE CHANNEL THAT YOU ARE ON MOST FOR EXAMPLE
YOU WANT THE YOU WANT IT TO BE PROGRAMMED FOR EXAMPLE Y PROGRAMMED F OR YOU WANT IT TO RECOGNISE YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL
LET'S SEE YOU YOU SPEND TWENTY MINUTES EACH DAY ON THAT CHANNEL SO IT RECOGNISES YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL
OKAY SO HAVE IT MORE MAKE IT MORE DURABLE ACTUALLY
NO OF COURSE UH
SO WE AGREE ON THE THE PART THAT WE NEED TO GET SOMETHING ON THE ON THE REMOTE TO FIND IT SOMEWHERE AND INCREASE IT THE DURABILITY OF OF THE THING
UH
I SO I THINK IT'S THAT'S ALSO GOOD WITH THE FASHION AND EVERYTHING SO YEAH
IF THEY LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS THE WAY IT FUNCTIONS SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA SPEND UH SPEND MONEY ON IT
SEE HOW FAR WE CAN GO WITH IT ANYWAY SO AND ONE THING THAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT IS THAT THE CORPORATE L COLOUR AND SLOGAN ARE RECOGNISABLE
BECAUSE WITH COLOURS YOU CAN UH HAVE A LOT OF UH FASHIONABLE COLOURS AND EVERYTHING ON IT WHICH SUITS EVERYBODY'S TASTE
SO WHY NOT JUST STEAL NOKIA'S IDEA AND JUST MAKE CHANGEABLE COVERS FOR YOUR I MEAN THOSE COST HARDLY ANYTHING I THINK AND PEOPLE COULD EVEN SPEND EXTRA MONEY
ON BUYING A COVER AND SO HAVE AN ENTIRE NEW REMOTE CONTROL THAT THEY LIKE TO SEE
OR WE CAN SH FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT A BASIC DESIGN
I THINK WE SHOULD LOSE THE L. C. D. SCREEN LIKE YOU SAID
I THINK FOR EXAMPLE IT'S IT'S HUGE I THINK THE L. C. D. IS HUGE IT CONSUMES BATTERIES LIKE HELL
WHAT WE COULD DO WHAT COULD BE POSSIBLE IS MAYBE NOT AN L. C. D. SCREEN BUT WITH A PREVIEW BUT Y I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE
LIKE YOU HAVE A LITTLE JUST JUST A TEXT ONLY NOT COLOUR JUST A LITTLE TEXT THING SO YOU CAN USE YOUR REMOTE AS A T. V. GUIDE
I'M NOT SURE IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE BUT MAYBE OKAY MAKE IT YEAH FIND A LITTLE COMPROMISE IN THAT BUT WHAT DID I WRITE DOWN
OH YOU MEAN AS LIKE A SEPARATE THING YOU CAN ATTACH TO YOUR T. V.
I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR UNIVERSAL BECAUSE APPARENTLY WE'RE A SEPARATE COMPANY MAKING SEPARATE C REMOTE CONTROLS TO SELL TO A LOT OF DIVERSE PEOPLE
YEAH I THINK WE'RE TARGETING EVERYONE SO REMOTE
SO I THINK IMPLEMENTING SPEECH RECOGNITION IS SUCH A SMALL UM APPARATUS IT'S VERY HARD TO DO
IT'S NOT A MATURE TECHNOLOGY I THINK IT TAKES A LOT OF MEMORY AND EVERYTHING IN IN A REMOTE CONTROL SO
UM WELL YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO THE IN INTO THE MATERIALS THAT ARE REAL DURABLE
BUT ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT ARE UM THE POPULAR BUTTONS SO THOSE ALWAYS FADE FIRST
YOU ASSUME THAT THAT THEY READ CORRECTLY AND I THINK THEY'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE IS THAT THEY'RE REALLY SENSITIVE TO TO TRENDS THAT ARE PASSING THROUGH THE WORLD
NO OF COURSE
NO I THINK IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU YOU PUT OVER THEM BECAUSE YEAH WE C YEAH YOU CA WELL
THA THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT A BAD THAT'S NOT EVEN IT'S NOT EVEN A BAD IDEA
I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE INTO THE DURABILITY ISSUE
YOU COULD FOR EXAMPLE IF YOUR BUTTONS ARE FADED
EITHER EITHER CHANGE BOTH THE BUTTONS AND AND THE COVER OR JUST THE COVER I'M NOT SURE WHICH WHICH IS EASIER SO
JUST LUNCH BREAK AND HAVE MORE INDIVIDUAL WORK AFTER THAT SO LET'S SEE WHAT WE LET'S SEE WE
IT WAS IT L IT'S LIKE ALL BUTTONS AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT DOES AT FIRST AND I'M TOTAL T. V. NEW ANYWAY
JUST STICK 'EM UNDER ONE MENU AND UH GIVE IT A JUST PUT IT IN IN S IN A SOFTWARE PIECE
YOU CAN MENU AND YOU CAN UH SELECT EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO TO SET ON YOUR T. V.
I'M NOT S YEAH
FOR EX YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A LITTLE DECISION BETWEEN THE PART IF YOU WANT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL THAT IT SHOULD DO WHAT PEOPLE USUALLY DO WITH THEIR T. V. S
NOT NOT THE VERY COMPLICATED SETTINGS THAT YOU CAN USUALLY DO THAT WITH UH EITHER A OLD OLD REMOTE CONTROL IF THEY REALLY HATE THAT THING BUT
I THINK THERE'S I THINK THERE IS A STANDARD FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN UH BECAUSE USUALLY THE THE MENU IS THE MENU BUTTON IS IS USABLE BETWEEN DIFFERENT BRANDS
I THINK SO UH WE NEED TO PUT SOME RESEARCH INTO THAT IF IF WE CAN OPEN THE MENU I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE JUST THE WAY HOW TO
YEAH THEN THEN YOU COULD DO EVERYTHING I SUPPOSE BECAUSE USUALLY THE T. V. S HAVE THA THAT INSIDE IN THIS OTHER LITTLE PIECE OF SOFTWARE SO IT'S OKAY
YEAH I THINK IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE DISTINCT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE IT'S EITHER IT'S BOTH MAYB MAYBE THE SHAPE CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
SO ANYWAY YEAH WE COULD DO SOME I DO SOME WORK NOW ON ON THE DESIGN FOR EXAMPLE
I THINK THAT THE THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE THE CHANNEL BUTTONS SHOULD BE UH ON THEIR OWN
LET'S SEE ONE TWO GOD DAMN IT
YEAH BUT FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S LOST IN YOUR ARMCHAIR WE'LL NOT SEE THE FLASH
UM THAT THING SHOULD BE CENTRAL
YEAH I THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD MOVE THE BUTTONS DOWN AND PUT IT HERE FOR EXAMPLE TO
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YOU SHOULD I THINK THE BU THE POWER BUTTON SHOULD BE ON TOP 'CAUSE IT'S THE FIRST THING YOU DO TURN IT ON
TAKE THIS OUT AND HERE SEE
OKAY SHOULD WE CHAN OKAY THIS TWO CHANNEL
WELL FOR THAT IS IT'S ON ONE PART IT'S UM IT'S A GOOD THING TO RECHARGE IT
YOU HAVE JUST PUT PENLITE BATTERIES THAT ARE RECHARGEABLE BECAUSE IT'S AN IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY ANNOYING
BECAUSE IF IT'S IT'S UH USEFUL TO HAVE IT RECHARGEABLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME
YOU WANNA BE ABLE TO PUT DIFFERENT BATTERIES IN IT USE IT NOW AND NOT IN HALF AN HOUR
I THINK IT'S UH IT'S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA TO HAVE UH LIKE SORT OF A MAYBE A BASE STATION THAT YOU PUT ON THE T. V.
A WHAT
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE WANTED TO INSERT EITHER A BEEP OR A FLASH INTO THE THING WITH A LITTLE SEPARATE SIGNAL OR SO YOU COULD PUT THAT ON A T. V. FOR EXAMPLE
IT'S A VERY SMALL YEAH I'M DRAWING IT BIG NOW BUT SO YOU CAN PUT YOUR REMOTE ON FLAT FOR EXAMPLE
FOR EXAMPLE UM YOU JUST PUT IT DOWN IT RECHARGES FOR EXAMPLE
I'M NOT SURE IF IT COSTS A LOT THAT THAT'S WHAT HE R
WE JUST ASSU WE WE COULD EITHER MAKE A SEPARATE STATION WHICH JUST SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE REMOTE CONTROL TO EITHER BEEP OR FLASH TO FIND IT
YEAH IT'S OH WE CAN SAVE THIS
WE EVEN SAVED THE ANT
SO WHAT WE HAVE IS YOU HAVE I THINK YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT OF WORK ON IF IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THE COST
MAYBE YEAH OR MAYBE YOU CAN FIND OUT I WHAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY
WE COULD LOSE A LITTLE PROFIT AND MAYBE ATTRACT MORE CUSTOMERS UH WE JUST HAVE TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
NO IT WASN'T WASN'T ALLO IT WAS POSSIBLE NOT ALLOWED SO
SO THAT'S UM WHY I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SHARE DOCUMENTS ON THE ON THE DRAFT
YEAH THE OH THEY INC UH THEY INCLUDE THE NEW ONE
YEAH DRAW US UP SOME SOME DESIGNS OF OF POSSIBLE JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THE IMPORTANT BUTTONS SHOULD BE ON TOP AND EITHER BIG
OR JUST PO POST YOUR DESIGNS FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE PRODUCT SHARE
WELL WHAT WE HAD FUNCTION THAT WHAT PEOPLE DO SO
PEOPLE CHANGE CHANNELS PEOPLE THEY CHANGE THE VOLUME AND THEY THEY CHANGE CHANNEL THEY TURN T. V. OFF AND ON FOR EXAMPLE
THAT'S THE BASIC FU THAT'S WHAT YOU DO I'M NOT SURE WHO PRESENT THAT AGAIN
BUT THOSE ARE THE BASIC FUNCTION THAT PEOPLE USE IT FOR SO THOSE SHOULD BE VERY WELL REPRESENTED
EVERYTHING IS YOU SAY IN EVERY T. V. THAT'S CONFIGURED UNDER THE MENU
THE WANT TO PAY FOR OH
ALL THE INTEREST IN FEATURES NOT REALLY THE L. C. OH HERE
OR FIND A COMPROMISE MAYBE JUST A BLACK AND WHITE OR FOR SOME EXTRA INFORMATION ON IT ON YOUR PROGRAMMES
ME TOO
WE SHOULD SEE IF WHAT IT COSTS IF IT'S POSSIBLE
I JUST DREW SOMETHING WHAT WHICH WOULD FIT INTO YOUR HAND EASILY
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE TO J JUST KEEP IN MIND IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HEAVY
LET'S TAKE TAKE THE BASIC DESIGN AGAIN WHAT WE OH CRAP UH CAME UP WITH
SO A TRANSMITTER HERE
UH IF YOU T IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON YOU CAN SEE IT RI I'M NOT SURE WHA I'M TRYING TO IMAGINE MYSELF WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE
YOU WOULD PREFER IT N OKAY
SO WE HAVE THREE PEOPLE SAYING IT SHOULD BE ON TOP
ABOUT THE L. C. D. S THING
WELL IF IT IF IT'S IF IT'S POSSIBLE WI IF IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE WE SHOULD INCLUDE IT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S COOL
OR MAYBE WE SHOULD M WE COULD UH DRAW DRAW SOMETHING A BIT THAT HAS IT ON ON ON THE BOTTOM
FOR UP AND DOWN MA MAKE IT A CIRCLE ON IT BECAUSE IT
YOU CAN MAKE IT AS BIG AS YOU WANT
I DON'T THINK IF WE IF WE EVEN USE AN L. C. D. SCREEN WE NEED TO DEFINITELY
YEAH BUT WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE SI WHAT THE SIZE IS
THE L. C. D. DOESN'T HAVE TO NEE DOESN'T NEED TO BE VERY BIG
SO EITHER
WE EITHER WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT
EITHER THIS ONE THIS THIS COULD BE THE LUXURIOUS ONE
UH
YOU COULD HAVE IT FOR EXAMPLE
WELL YOU CAN JUST NO I'M NOT SURE IF WE CAN DO THAT BUT WE COULD PUT A MICROPHONE IN HERE FOR EXAMPLE
JUST TO DO RESEARCH INTO BOTH W WHAT IT COSTS AND WHAT IT TAKES FOR SPACE
UH OKAY
OKAY AT ANYWAYS THE THE MINUTES WILL BE ON THE ON THE WEB SHORTLY SO THERE WE GO UH
YEAH TO ALL
OKAY NOW WORK A LITTLE WITH ME
WELL LET'S START IT AS IT IS
WHICH BUTTONS ARE WANTED UH IS OUR REMOTE CONTROL UNIVERSAL OR SHOULD IT BE PROGRAMMABLE
BECAUSE THEN THE BUTTONS HAVE TO SEND OUT A DIFFERENT SIGNAL THEN THEY WOULD NORMALLY DO
SO UH UH THAT'S WHY I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SAY UH GO A LITTLE BIT EASY ON THE DESIGNS
UH I HEARD AB UH YOU TALKING ABOUT BEEPS AND ABOUT UH VIDEO SCREENS BUT UH THE MATERIAL INSIDE AND THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS ARE QUITE COMPLEX ALREADY
SO KEEP IN MIND THAT EVERYTHING THAT YOU KEEP UH THINK OF IT HAS TO B TO BE BUILT
SO IT'S THAT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT S MIGHT LOOK LIKE
THIS IS WHAT LOOK LIKE UH LOOKS LIKE IF YOU PRESS ONE BUTTON SO THIS IS NOT THE ENTIRE THING
THAT THINKS OVER A MORSE CODE THAT'S HOW YOU SHOULD SEE IT
YOU HAVE INFRARED AND AN INTERV UM UH HOW TO SAY IT
THAT MAKES IT MUCH MORE COMPLEX SO WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A LOOK DO WE WANT THAT OR NOT
UH I DON'T HAVE ANY PERSONAL P UH PREFERENCES UH SO FAR EXCEPT FOR UH THE MATERIALS TO BE USED UH LIGHT THAT THEY ARE LIGHT
Y
YES I THINK SO TOO
I HAVE TO CHECK THAT OUT I'M NOT SURE
IN TH OKAY BUT THAT RULES OUT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL
NO IT'S FINE WITH ME BUT THEN I KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR
IF WE UH MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH CHANGEABLE COVERS THEN WE CAN ALSO MAKE UH A COVER FOR EVERY LANGUAGE AREA
THAT'S FO IS UH ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN READ IT READ IT IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE
UH OKAY
UH BUT I KNOW THAT THE BUTTONS ARE LIKE A NOKIA TELEPHONE ON UH ONE SLEEVE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR WHOLE COVER
THEN UH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET EVERYTHING OUT OF THE TELEVISION THAT'S IN IT
BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'LL LOSE FUNCTIONS BY BUYING OUR
OKAY I THI I THINK SO TOO
AND I THINK THAT OUR R REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD NOT LOOK LIKE UH ANY OTHER
UH
YEAH IT'S TRUE BUT IT'S IT'S ONLY HAS TO DO SO WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTON THAT IT'S LOST
SHALL WE UH ALSO LOOK IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE A RECHARGEABLE REMOTE
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY NEW BATTERIES IF EVERY
UH
UH YOU COULD MAKE A DEVICE BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT UH IS POSSIBLE WITH THE COSTS THAT YOU CAN PUT IN NORMAL BATTERIES
I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIND THAT OUT
I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THIS BUT
UH
WHAT IT COSTS AND WHAT KIND OF MATERIALS THAT WE CAN UH CHOOSE WHAT WE WANT IN IT AND EXACTLY I NEED IT
I THINK SO TOO
I THINK SO TOO
THOSE TWO THINGS
UH
UH
UH
OH I REALISE IF WE MAKE IT SMALL THEN IT NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE THICKER BECAUSE I NEED TO PUT ALL THE ELECTRONICS IN IT
IF WE MAKE IT S UH SMALLER UH LESS WIDE
ME TOO
AH BUT
M I PERSONALLY WOULD PREFER IT ON THE TOP
THEY WANT IT UH
IT IS RECHARGEABLE SO WE CAN STICK WITH ONE INSTEAD OF TWO
ONE MORE UH THING I'D LIKE TO SAY UH LET'S GIVE THIS UH A NAME
AND NOT LIKE SOME VAGUE SERIAL NUMBER THAT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS LIKE WITH CARS
OH THERE HE IS
IS THAT MANAGEABLE
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS PRETTY EXPENSIVE TOO
IT SOUNDS REALLY EASY WHAT DOES THE USER DO WHAT DOES THE TH REMOTE CONTROL DO BUT THERE ARE QUITE SOME ISSUES
SO THE THINGS I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON ARE THE USER ASPECT BECAUSE THE TECHNICAL ASPECT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH COVERED
I COME TO SOME UH PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FINDINGS POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS LATER
UH SO EITHER WE LOSE THOSE OR WE TRY TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR
THERE'S NOTHING MORE ANNOYING THAN FADED SYMBOLS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH CHANNEL IS THIS BUTTON SO POSSIBLY WE COULD FIND UH SOMETHING FOR THAT YES
SO YOU PRESS MORE ONCE REMOTE CONTROL GOES
KABLOUEY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION NOT TO PUT TOO MUN TOO MANY BUTTONS ON UH THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND POSSIBLY ALSO THE SIZE SO MORE IMPORTANT BUTTONS BIGGER SI
SO THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT I H HAD IN MIND IN THE FADE PROOF SYMBOLS LOCATOR A SOUND UH SO CLEAR WE SHOULD STICK TO EXISTING SYMBOLS
UH
SO WHAT WE WANT TO GO TO IS NOT THIS ONE BUT MORE LESS BUTTONS EASY SOME BIGGER BUTTONS
THIS IS NOT THE FINAL DESIGN THIS IS JUST A GENERAL IDEA OF HOW I'D LIKE TO SEE UH BASICALLY THE GENERAL IDEA
IS IT MANAGEABLE
IS IT EASY
AND IT COSTS TOO MUCH TO FABRICATE SO WE'RE ON A TIGHT BUDGET HERE
IS IT TECHNI TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE TO UH SEND A SIGNAL TO A TELEVISION AND THEN POPS UP A MENU
IT'S AN IN BUILT MENU ISN'T IT
OR WE COULD USE A DOUBLE SIDED FOR LESS USED FUNCTIONS YOU
BECAUSE IF WE USE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MOST BUTTONS ON IT SO
OH WE GET THE GENERAL IDEAS YES
THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SO
WHOA
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND IT
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO
IS THAT SOMEWHERE HERE
IS THAT USED OFTEN
IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT NO
COULD YOU POST SOME OTHER ESSENTIALS OF WHAT PEOPLE WANT SO THAT I CAN WORK WITH SOME BUTTONS WHERE TO PUT IT
SEE SOME OF IT
OH YOUR COMPUTER
OH WHERE WOULD WE
OR MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING FOR THE NEXT MEETING I CAN DRAW OUT SOME IDEAS
I CAN PUT THE OTHER BUTTONS IN
WE NEED TO ADJUST TO THE TECHNOLOGY
NO I THI
OH WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE THEN WITH AN L. C. D. SCREEN
NOW IT'S PRETTY MUCH TUCKED AWAY IN YOUR HAND
DO WE PUT THE VOLUME CONTROL AND THE CHANNEL CONTROL HERE OR DO WE PUT IT ON HE WOULD WE LIKE TO PRESS IT IN THE MIDDLE
YES GO AND FINISH UP AND I'LL SEE YOU AT LUNCH
UH
UM THERE WAS A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH MY COMPUTER SO NOT UH THE WHOLE UH PRESENTATION UH
I WANT TO OPEN THE MY S OH NO
THE THE METHOD WE USED UH IT IT'S NOT M NOT A SLIDE BECAUSE IT WENT WRONG BUT THE METHOD WE USE UH
UM WE TESTED IT W UH WITH UH A HUNDRED UH MEN
AND WE ASKED THEM TO W UH WHAT THE REMOTE UH F FEEL UH LIKE AND UH WHAT WHAT'S UH IMPORTANT
UH
BOTH WOMEN AND MEN YEAH
SO WE CAN DO UH A L A LITTLE UH NICE THINGS WITH IT AND UM THEY USE YEAH
UM OH YEAH NOT ALL OF IT IS IT ON MINE
ON MY POWERPOINT PRESENTATION BUT UM UH THE RELEVANT BUTTONS ARE THE POWER THE CHANNEL SELECTION AND THE VOLUME SELECTION
BUT IT'S NOT UH VERY UH IMPORTANT UH ON THE SCALE OF ZERO TO TEN THEY SIX AND A HALF UH AND BUT NOT IMPORTANT IS THE CHANNEL SELECTION
OH THE THE NO NO NO NO NO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT UH W AND NOT IMPORTANT IN THE AUDIO SETTINGS DISPLAY SETTINGS AND UH
SO UH I THINK IT'S A BEE BEEP TO SOUND IT AND UH YOU CAN FIND IT
AND THEY WANT MAYBE AN UH L. C. D. SCREEN UM TO TO LOOK IT UM WH WHAT'S ON EVERY CHANNEL UH AND UH WHAT DO I WANT WITH IT
UH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES IS UH A BUTTON FOR MY FAVOURITE CHANNEL SO I CAN UH I DUNNO SO I CAN ZAP TO MY UH
F UH QUICK UH TO MY FAVOURITE CHANNEL WH WHAT I UH SO THE REMOTE MU MUST SEE OR UM
MUST UM SEE WHA WHAT MINE PREFERENCES ARE FOR WHICH CHANNEL SO I CAN ZAP T TO
NO ITSELF
IT'S A LITTLE BIT UH I LOST IT THE COMPUTER UH CRASHED SO
BUT OH
UH
EVERYONE UH WANTS TO BUY IT SO WE W YEAH
OR ONE
UH
OH D
BUT YOU R
NO IT'S NO
UH
AROUND UH NOT UH NOT AT TOP AT THE AROUND THE VOLUME SELECTION
WHA
ON THE RIGHT
TH UH THERE WAS NOT A EL ASK ESQUE
BUT F HMM
I LOST MY UH PRESENTATION BUT
HERE I HAVE THE THE S THE HOMEPAGE OF UH OUR
HERE IS MY MARKETING REPORT MAYBE YOU CA YOU CAN LOOK AT UH THAT AND
AH YEAH
BUT IT IT'S ALSO FOR PEOPLE THEY WANT TO LEARN IT FAST NOT UH THEY WANT TO
UM ON MY REPORT I DIDN'T UH ISH I DIDN'T SHOW IT IN MY UH PRESENTATION BECAUSE MY COMPUTER CRASHED
UH
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO USE IT UH BECAUSE IT'S USE IT UH
BUT NEE THE FUNCTION OF IT
IT'S EXPENSIVE TO BUILD IT SO
UH
IT'S ON YOUR COMPUTER
UH
YEAH YEAH BUT OR OR AN L. C. D. OR AN UH SPEECH
SAME
SO ARE YOU D WHAT WERE J YOU GUYS DISCUSSING
WHAT THE F OH YEAH UH
YEAH I HAVE TO START OUR
SO THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE TO D UH HAVE TO GO ON YOU KNOW
THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE MAKE FINAL DECISIONS ON UH ON A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
SAME GOES FOR YOU
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE A MOVE ON THAT AREA I GUESS
S ESPECIALLY S WHEN WHEN THE NEW UH COMPONENT IS APPLICABLE IN OUR UH PRODUCT WE'LL BE FINE
ANYWAYS WELL TELETEXT WASN'T IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHAT I TOOK
AND WELL ACTUALLY WE YEAH WE DID NEED SOME MORE DATA ON FINANCES BUT W YEAH WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT APPARENTLY
YEAH WE NEED TO IM DE WE ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE BEEP AND THE FLASH THING TO RECOVER YOUR REMOTE
ALSO IF IF WE WERE CHOOSE THE THE L. C. D. OPTION WOULD IT GIVE ENOUGH ENERGY OKAY THAT'S THE JUST ASSUME IT TAKES
BUT I'M SURE T I MEAN REMOTES LIE STILL I THINK LIKE NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME
I MEAN EVERYBODY EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO USE THAT
WELL MM IT'S NOT IN THE LIST
OKAY WILL JUST TAKE REGULAR BATTERIES
OKAY WE'LL GET BACK ON THAT LATER
OKAY WE HAVE SO I THINK WE CAN RULE OUT UM I'M NOT SURE WE CAN RULE ANYTHING OUT
WE'LL DO THAT WHEN Y WHEN YOU GET YOUR DESIGN
YEAH IS IT KEEP IN MIND THAT IT IT'S IT'S UH IT FAL UH REMOTE CONTROLS FALL A LOT ON THE GROUND
SO YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BREAK
SO EITHER HAVE RUBBER EDGES OR A RUBBER REMOTE CONTROL IS VERY DURABLE
DON'T HAVE TO BE UN BREAKABLE IT'S P IT'S A IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO JU YEAH BREAK AFTER ONE USE
WELL YOU HAVE FOR IF YOU IF FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU TAKE HARD PLASTIC
AND RUBBER UH KIND OF SOFTENS THE FALL
YOU KNOW WHAT TH WE'RE FOCUSING VERY MUCH ON THE COVERS NOW
I THINK IT'S JUST W NOW WE'RE GOING FOR THE BASIC DESIGN
CHANNEL I THINK THAT WOULD BE ANNOYING BECAUSE IT MIGHT ACCIDENTALLY SCROLL ONTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
BUT WHY DO WE NEED IT
IF WE DON'T NEED IT
WHAT YOU WHAT WHAT'D YOU GET ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN
IS IT EXPENSIVE
AND HOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE IS THAT
OH LET'S GO FOR LET'S SAY BECAUSE IT IS UH VERY HOT IN N OUR TARGET GROUP I THINK
WE SHOULD TAKE IT TAKE IT T TO CONSIDERATION TO BUILD AN L. C. D. SCREEN IN IT
WELL WHAT D WHAT WAS EXACT WHAT YOU GOT ON THE ON THE NEW COMPONENT
YEAH BUT WE GOT SOME DATA ON PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY ARE INT ARE INTERESTED IN THAT AND I DON'T THINK A SCROLL WHEEL OFFERS NEW FUNCTIONALITY
UH I THINK SO BECAUSE IF I THINK WE'RE SPECIALLY W IF YOU'RE GOING MAYBE UH IF YOU HAVE THE TWO EDITIONS YOU WANNA WANNA GIVE OUT
JUST M HAVE A SEAT FOR A SECOND
UH
WHY IS IT S WHY IS IT SQUARED
OR OKAY SO JUST YEAH YOU CAN REST IT ON YOUR FINGER
IT'S ON THE BACK
KEYS ARE PROBABLY THE N THE NUMBER KEYS I SUPPOSE
UH IN THE THE SIMPLE DESIGN YOU HAVE THEM AT A TOP AND THE UH COMPLEX DESIGN YOU HAVE THEM AT THE BOTTOM
JUST AS LONG AS YOU TAK TOOK IT INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT PEOPLE WOULD PREFER
UH OKAY IF YOU ALL AGREE I'M FINE WITH IT
NO YOU SHOULD SEND IT TO THE F TO THE FOLDER FIRST
YEAH W TH APPARENTLY
I'M UH NOT SU
BUT MAYBE JUST TH MAKE UH THE TOP A LITTLE ROUND IT OFF ON THE SIDES
SO I MEAN Y
NOT NOT REALLY THE CURVES ON THE ON THE SIDE OF THE REMOTE
WELL YOU SHOULDN'T FOCUS ON THE MOSTLY ON THE COVERS BECAUSE LOT OF THINGS WE CAME UP WITH
SHOULDN'T BE TOO REALLY TOO MUCH SHOULDN'T BE TOO FOCUSSED ON THE COVERS BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF AN IDEA OF OUR OWN
THAT'S THE ONE THING I'M ALSO AFRAID OF WITH THIS ONE BECAUSE IT THE EDGES ARE REALLY UM THEY MIGHT STICK OUT ON THE ON THE SIDE FOR EXAMPLE
IF YOU HAVE A BASIC DESIGN A LITTLE M A LITTLE SMALLER ON THE ON THE S ON THE EDGES
YOU COULD PUT MORE COVERS ON IT Y ONE ONE WITH SQUARE OR UM SHARP CORNERS IF YOU WANT TO
SO M JUST ROUND IT OFF A LITTLE I GUESS BECAUSE SO WE HAVE MORE OPTIONS I SUPPOSE
ANYWAY YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO MAKE TO MAKE THE FINAL DESIGN IN A MINUTE WITH HIM
SO SO WE COME TO A DECISION
AH
WELL I THINK WE TOOK ALL THE COMPONENTS SEPARATELY WHAT WE WANT
ANYWAY UM APPARENTLY YOU GUYS YOU SHOULD WORK TOGETHER ON THE FINAL DESIGN BOTH ON INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DESIGN
HOW UH WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH THE FINAL DESIGN AS WE HAVE IT NOW
SO WHAT WOULD GIVE US YOUR NE YOUR DESIGN WOULD BE THE LIGHTS WOULD BE ON TOP RIGHT
UH ONE ON EACH ONE ON EACH SIDE
IS IT IS IT THE LIGHTS FOR FOR FINDING THE FINDING REMOTE OR LIGHTS THAT IT THAT
UH SH OH
M I'LL MAKE IT UM ARE WE GONNA USE SQUARE BUTTONS OR ROUND ONES ACTUALLY
SEE THIS WOULD BE GOOD
ARE THESE FOR ANY EXTRA CONTROLS
IF WE GO FOR FOR ROUND BUTTONS IN GENERAL DO WE WANT TO THE MENU KEY IN THE MIDDLE TO BE ROUND
ROUND BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE OR SQUARE ONE
UH OH THE SQUARE BUTTON SORRY
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE IT YOU CAN TAKE THIS AWAY BUT THERE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A HOLE THERE JUST TO MIRROR THE EFFECT
WE COULD PUT A LOGO HERE BECAUSE IT'S VERY ALWAYS IN YOUR FIELD OF VISION
IF YOU'RE WATCHING IT THE L. C. D. SCREEN BLAH BLAH
BUT YOU THINK HERE OR HERE
NO WE COULD PUT THIS ONE AS FAVOURITE CHANNEL FOR EXAM
WHAT ARE THESE FOR
MY UH OKAY HAVE IT YOUR WAY
BUT TH
ANYWAY SO THIS IS THE BASIC DESIGN WE WANNA HAVE UM ON AND OFF WHAT ARE WE MISSING
OKAY SO WE WANT THE REMOTE TO BE THE S THE SIDE VIEW ACTUALLY WHAT I'M GONNA DRAW
PROBABLY THINK YOU WANT THE CURVE TO BE HERE
DO WE WANT SOMETHING INTERESTING WITH IT OR SEE
AND JUST S S
IN
YOU GOT SPONSOR NOW YOU GET A FREE ONE WITH EVERY PACK OF CHIQUITA
ON THE SIDE OR ON THE OR FOR EXAMPLE ON TOP
OKAY I W THOUGHT MAYBE IT'S EITHER BE HERE OR BECAUSE IT'S MI IT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THE TRANSMITTER I'M NOT SURE
WHY UH ONCE AGAIN LIKE YOU SAID THE COMPONENT CAN BE SOMEWHERE AT THE BOTTOM WHILE WE WIRE THE MICROPHONE UP THERE
UM YEAH IT COULD BE EITHER BE HERE OR MAKE A DOUBLE MICROPHONE
YOU CAN JUST NAVIGATE THROUGH TH M YOUR MENU THAT YOU HAVE HERE FOR ADVANCED OPTIONS WITH THIS
SO THAT'S W M WOULD BE MAKING USE OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN
WE COULD YEAH BUT YOU COULD PUT A SPEAKER OR SOMETHING ON ON THE SIDE FOR EXAMPLE
SO WE'RE S SUPPOSED TO BE RUBBER
AND YEAH OF COURSE WE COULD USE YELLOW BUTTONS OR YELLOW NAVIGATION OR WHATEVER
I THINK WE SHOULD TH THEN TAKE IT TAKE YELLOW
SO LET'S SEE IF IF WE CAN DO THE LED ONTO IT
UH OH
AND TH THAT'S JUST SO MUCH THINGS THAT MAKE IT LOOK FLASH
NO R NO SCROLL WHEEL
IT'S I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE GONNA GET FINANCE ANYWAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE COU I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE AN ISSUE AT THE FIRST TIME WE STARTED
SO YOU JUST DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE AND UH DOESN'T CARE WHAT IT COSTS
UH YEAH WE CAN MAKE UH FOR EXAMPLE IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU CAN CLICK ON IT LIKE UH THAT'S BUT IT'S NOT SOM NOT APPARENTLY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING WITH IN THE BASIC DESIGN
AH
I HAVE NO I STILL DON'T HAVE ANY FINANCE INFORMATION BUT AT LEAST WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO GO ON NOW
PRESENTATION IS
THEN WARNING UH THERE HAS TO BE A CHIP IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL
THE AVAILABLE UH COMPONENTS FOR ENERGY ARE WE HAVE A BASIC BATTERY A HAND AN UH DYNAMO LIKE IN UH OLD TORCHES
MY PERSONAL UH FAV FAVOURITE IS THE KINETIC PROVISION BECAUSE UH I HA
OTHER OPTIONS ARE SOLAR CELLS HAND DYNAMO AND BASIC BATTERY
YEAH BUT I THINK THIS RULES OUT OUR UNIT OUR RECHARGEABLE UNIT
AND UH UH TH UH THE SHAPE
AND I BELIEVE EVEN THAT THE R THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS WE HAVE ON PUTTING THINGS IN IT UH GOES DOWN WITH EXACTLY
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT SO FAST
BUT I THINK WOOD IS NOT AN OPTION EITHER
UH
WE HAVE NO MORE THAN THIS
WE HAVE A LARGE HISTORY OUR COMPANY ON PUSH BUTTONS
SCROLL WHEELS UH THOSE CAN BE PUSHED AS WELL ALTHOUGH THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE
WHICH ONE OF THOSE ARE WE GONNA USE
AH SO BUT IT LOOKS COOL
AH
AH WE DON'T NEED IT BUT IT'S UH IT'S DESIGN A DESIGN THING
SO PUSH BUTTONS WE WILL USE
IS THAT S
UH I ONLY KNOW THAT IF WE ARE USING THAT WE NEED ANO UH AN ADVANCED CHIP IN IT
I HAVE NO IDEA
I HAVE NO ABSOLUTE NUMBERS
UH THAT'S NO LONGER AN OPTION IT HAS TO BE AN ADVANCED ONE NOW
OTHERWISE IT'S NOT S A REMOTE CONTROL
ARE WE GONNA DO THAT OR NOT
OH HOW DID YOU
OH THAT'S R
SO IT'S M
IT'S SOME IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT DO THEN
THEN W YEAH BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT
THEY TH THESE WHA ARE WHAT THEY CALL THE CURVES
OF WHAT WE HAVE DECIDED SO FAR
ME TOO
THEN IT WILL BOUNCE AND YOU DON'T DROP IT SO EASILY
UH
OH PERHAPS THEY CAN USE IT
YOU CAN ACTUALLY UH PLACE A CHIP FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND AT THE BOTTOM AND AND WIRE IT
IT IS I BELIEVE ALSO ABLE TO TALK
I HAVE A SAMPLE UH SAMPLE SENSOR AND THE SPEAKER SENSOR
UH THE SPEAKER SENSOR WE ALREADY HAVE BUT S I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY EXACTLY MEAN BY A SAMPLE SENSOR
COULD IT TALK BACK
I THINK IF YOU HAVE A A SPEECH RECOGNITION COMPONENT THEN A S SPEAKING COMPONENT IS NOT THAT HARD TO TO PUT IN EITHER
TO HAVE IT FLASHY TO HAVE IT IT'S FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
NEED DO BE DIFFERENT
OH NO THAT I THINK IT'S GOOD THING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN
UH THAT'S NAH THAT'S TRUE
NO LOOK IT
IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S FUNCTIONAL BUT IT'S JUST TO ADD TO THE DESIGN TO HAVE IT FLASHY
OH SO MANY THINGS HAVE NO FUNCTION JUST DESIGN
IN OR OUT
YOU ARE OKAY CLEAR
WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH UP TO STANDARD SO WE MIGHT USE THAT I PUT THAT IN MY DRAWING BUT AGAIN I DIDN'T NOT HAVE THAT MUCH TIME
UH
OKAY WHAT T
IS THAT ENOUGH
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY SEE PEOPLE SHAKING THEIR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE USING IT
YEAH BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE UNBREAKABLE BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO KEEP SELLING THESE THING
BECAUSE IT WELL RU WILL RUBBER ACTUALLY PROTECT THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF
I HAVE T I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
AND THEN I ALSO HAVE A STANDARD EDITION WHICH WI WE CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO DEVELOP TOO
OH I GOT
WELL THEY B THEY BASICALLY CAN HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION
'CAUSE YOU WANTED TO SEE THEM RIGHT
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE REMOTE CONTROL
UH YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT THAT WELL BUT THIS IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN
SO EXCUSE ME FOR THE UH INCONVENIENCE HERE BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE KEYS MOVED
SO IF WE WERE TO SELECT THE L. C. D. SCREEN THE TRANSMITTER HERE YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT I
BIT
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HA WHICH I HAD IN MIND
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THIS CAN BE SPACED FOR EXTRA KEYS WHICH IS THE DESIGN THINGYS
THEN RUBBER WOULD BE THE BEST AS A MATERIAL INDEED
OUR FOCUS IS THE YOUNG AUDIENCE
YEAH BUT THAT'S JUST MORE A SE A SEASONAL A TREND THING
WELL YOU CAN S
AND WE COULD HAVE ONE HERE
BUT ISN'T THE F THE FRUIT LIKE A COVER THING BECAUSE WE
YOU'D JUST LIKE IT TO GO A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE THIS
THAT WAS BASICALLY WHAT W
WE CAN ALSO USE ONE LIGHT FOR
I DID THAT PRETTY MUCH OVER HERE SO THAT YOU COULD USE IT LIKE THIS
AND THESE TWO BUTTONS ARE OR NOT NECESSARY OR
OH THAT COULD BE THAT B
OH WE STILL NEED AN OKAY BUTTON
OH WE'RE PRETTY MUCH MISSING AN OKAY BUTTON BUT WE HAVE A BUTTON UP THERE WHICH IS STILL FREE
UH
OR THEY CAN DESIGN THEIR OWN COVER
OH BASICALLY THE IDEA THAT I HAD WAS IT TO BE PRETTY MUCH IN COMBINATION WITH THE TRANSMITTER
'CAUSE YOU CAN TALK TO IT LIKE THIS
OH WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PUT IT
BASICALLY OUT
I DON'T SEE THE
UH
I UH NOW WILL SHOW IT
I BET
RE RECHARGEABLE BASI
IT DEP
ARE ARE WE FOCUSSI FOCUSSING ON ON THE
NOT THAT BUT ARE WE FOCUSSING ON THE UH YOUNGER PEOPLE OR THE ELDER PEOPLE
BUT TH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE MY INVESTIGATION TURNS OUT THAT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WANT A LITTLE BIT UH MATERIAL THAT THAT IS UH SPONGY AND UH
A SC
MEAN OF UH SEVENTY PERCENT I THINK
UH I'M I HAVE TO LOOK IT UP
AH
ON THE MOST SPEE
RI
OH IN THE BACK OKAY
NO IT MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO LOOK UH WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT
WHERE IS TH
UH
YEAH HERE IT IS
OKAY UH THE INVESTIGATION TURNS OUT THAT THE MOST APPEAR UH PEOPLE WANT UM UM UH LOOK AND FEEL LIKES IS UH UH THE S THE SAME AS BEFORE
BUT IT MUST BE W A LITTLE BIT FANCIER THAN UH THE THE LOOK OF IT
UM YEAH IT'S UH SHOULD BE EASY TO USE SO NOT NOT TOO MUCH BU BUTTONS AND UH CHANNEL SELECTION
I THINK THAT'S UH WHAT YOU SHOWED IS UH PERFECT
TH THEY YOU S YOU SEE IT IN THE CLOTHES AND EVERYTHING
AND UM THE CONTRAST UH OF IT IT MUST UH THE THE BUTTONS MUST A LITTLE BIT SPONGY MATERIAL
SO WE ARE UH WE WERE FOCUSSING UH ON THE YOUNGER PEOPLE
SO THE ELDER YEAH THEY WANTED A LITTLE BIT OF WOOD IN IT AND UH THAT'S UH TH THAT'S NOT UH IMPORTANT NOW
'CAUSE UH N I I I I THOUGHT UH IT MAKES A YOUNG UH CLASSIC REMOTE WITH UH
UH
YEAH IN IN FORM OF AN UH VEGETABLE OR AN UH FRUIT MAYBE
OH WHERE IS YOUR
ALL UH VEG UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE ROUND
IT'S IT'S NOT FOR THE TRENDY THING OF IT
SO THE NO
WE M
FORM
BUT YOU CAN MAKE UH IF YOU WANT TO USE A FRUIT IN UH IN UH
UH
AS A EXAMPLE
AND WHAT ABOUT OH
UH YEAH
UH
UH ONE ONE SET
NEE UH ONE OF THE FOUR UH
ON THERE
AH THAT'S FINE
WH
BUT THE YOU
SO COLOURFUL UH IS
OH IT'S OKAY
AH MAY
MA
OUT
AH
BUT WE HA W WE DON'T UH USE OUR RECO UH WE UH REMOVABLE COVER
DETAILED DESIGN OH COME ON
WELL AH S FORGOT TO INSERT THE MINUTES BUT IT'S ABOUT THE SAME THING WE DISCUSSED BEFORE
UH
OTHER DESIGN ANYWAY WE TOOK AS WE TOOK W WE TOOK RUBBER AS AS THE MATERIAL LAST TIME
TOOK THE ADVANCED CHIP TO T UH IMPLEMENT THE ADVANCED FEATURES
WELL WE DISCUSSED THE DESIGN NO SHARP CORNERS WE ROUNDED IT OFF LIKE YOU SEE ON THE OTHER SCREEN WHICH IS FINE
SO THEN WE CA YEAH
WE AGREED THAT WE WOULD IMPLEMENT BOTH THE L. C. D. AND SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT I'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT
PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION WELL FIRST YOU GUYS BUILT THE PROTOTYPE
NEE NO YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND PRESENT THE W WE'LL SCRAP IT LATER BECAUSE
I THINK THAT'S MORE I THINK THAT'S MORE DURABLE ANYWAY THAN PRINTED ON TO
FINANCES THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE WHAT YOU DREW
WE HAVE BATTERY POWER WE HAVE ADVANCED CHIPS AND THE SAM THE SENSOR
SO WHICH YOU SEE THE WHICH IS DE O ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PARTS
SO WELL WE HAVE SIN ONE CURVE A DESIGN
SO JUST HALF A EURO FOR YOU HAVE PUSHBUTTONS AND AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
YOU HAVE THE TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN EUROS IN PRODUCTION COST WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE TWELVE AND A HALF THAT WE ARE PERMITTED TO USE
WELL THINK I HAD THE BEST SOLUTION THAT I CAME UP WITH IS JUST TO S TAKE OUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
SO I JU I TOOK THAT OUT
AND YEAH I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE I COULD TAKE OUT
YEAH I COULD TAKE OUT THE PUSH BUTTONS BUT WE NEED THOSE
SO GENERALLY WHAT I CAME UP WITH IN ORDER TO BE COU TO TO HAVE PRODUCTION COST OF TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
SPE SCRAP SPEECH RECOGNITION AND THE SEPARATE COVERS CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE IF PEOPLE WANT IT WE'LL JUST THEN WE'LL DO IT IN BLACK
AND IF YOU WANT IT IF YOU WANT THE CUSTOM DESIGN THEN YOU CAN BUY THE SEPARATE COVERS
UH LET'S JUST LET'S SEE WHAT OKAY LET'S JUST SEE WHAT WE NO WE WE HAVE TO BE UNDER TWELVE AND A HALF
IT IT'S NOT UH THE PROJECT IS A NO GO IF WE GO OVER TWELVE AND A HALF SO
I THINK YOU THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE ASS ASSIGNED TO DO REALLY TO TO SEE HOW B TH BOTH THOSE WORK TOGETHER
SO I THINK YEAH IT'S I THINK IT'S Y ONE OF THE IT'S A GOOD WAY TO UM
TO HELP PEOPLE UH TO MAKE TO KEEP THE PRODUCT TRENDY TOO
BECAUSE THE EXPENSIVE PARTS ARE IN EITHER THE ADVANCED CHIP
B YEAH BUT THOSE GO TOGETHER
IS THAT AN OPTION
I THINK IT'S IT IT DOES RUIN IT BUT THE FACT THAT I T TOOK THAT DECISION OR T
TOOK THIS EXAMPLE ACTUALLY NOT REALLY DECISION BUT THE EXAMPLE IS BECAUSE WE DO OFFER THE UM THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDING YOUR OWN CUSTOM COVERS
SO WHICH IN IN TURN RUBBER WOULD INCREASE DURABILITY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T BREAK
I AL LIKE I SAID I LOST THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND I LOST THE SPECIAL COLOUR WHICH WOULD MAKE THIS BLACK A BLACK AND GREY
SO OH
I THINK THOSE ARE BASIC COL
THEY WANT TO
THAT THAT'S TH THAT'S THE ORDER
WE'RE JUST UH WE'RE THE PROJECT TEAM AND WE GOT OUR OUR ORDERS FROM THE PRO FROM THE BOSS OF OUR COMPANY WHICH SAY WE DON'T WANNA SPEND MORE THAN TWELVE FIFTY FOR THIS
TH I THINK THEY DO LIKE BECAUSE YO WE YOU WE AGREE UPON THAT THE THAT THE THE THE COVER THING WAS A NICE IDEA
BECAUSE P YOU COULD HAVE ALL SORT OF DESIGNS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME JUST MANUFACTURING ONE PRODUCT
ONE BASIC PRODUCT WHICH YOU COULD TURN INTO ANY ANY TASTE YOU WANT
SO I THINK IT'S THE BEST SOLUTION TO MAKE THOSE CU CUSTOM COVERS FOR THE DESIGN ASPECT AND KEEP THE FUNCTIONALITY BETWEEN OF WITHIN THE TH THE BOUNDARIES OF THE YOUR F UH YOUR BUDGET
IS IT WORTH IS IT IS IT DOES IT MEAN ANYTHING TO THE CUSTOMER
MAYBE WE SH THAT SHOULD BE SOLD IN IN THE S IN STORES WITH WITH A STANDARD COVER OR SOMETHING
SO IT'S EITHER ONE FI JUST JUST TO GET IT F JUST TO GET IT THROUGH FINAL IT'S EITHER TURNED INTO PLASTIC
OH THAT'S TRUE WE COULD LOSE THE C YEAH I FORGOT THAT SORRY
SO THAT'S JUST THIS ONE JUST D THIS IS THE BANANA CURVE
NO UH NO THAT WOULD BE A CURVE INSIDE THE THING I GUESS
NO WOULD JU THEN IT WOULD JUST BE A STRAIGHT REMOTE
WHICH WOULD YEAH TURN IT INTO SOMETHING FAR MORE ORDINARY
YOU SECOND THAT YOU SECOND THAT WE LOSE THE CURVE
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP THE CURVE TO SEPARATE IT FROM THE REST OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WORLD SO TO SPEAK
SO THE ONLY ONLY SOLUTION IS EITHER TO USE THE L Y LOSE THE YELLOW OR LOSE THE RUBBER
SO I THINK WE CAN TAKE THAT OPTION AND JUST WITH UH WITH THE IDEA IN THE BACK OF OUR HEAD THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMISE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
I SORT OF EXPECTED THAT EVERYTHING WOULD TURN OUT THIS WAY BUT BECAUSE YOU YEAH EVERYTHING CANNOT BE FOR FREE
BECAUSE THAT WAS I TH IT WAS REALLY ESSENTIAL REALLY TO MA BECAUSE WE SPENT UH UH ENTIRE STAGE DESIGNING A PRODUCT OF WHICH WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WOULD COST
I THINK THOSE ARE TOTALLY MET BECAUSE WE WE REALLY TOOK THEM FOR THE THEY HAVE THE FEEL THEY WANT THEY HAVE THE SIMPLICITY THEY WANT
EITHER TWO OR ONE MAYBE
I THINK WE TOOK THAT EVERYTHING THEY WANTED INTO CONSIDERATION
ONE AND A HALF
BECAUSE IF IT'S STUCK IN YOU COUCH YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT
I'D USE AN REMOTE CONTROL
I THINK BUT WE DIDN'T EVEN THERE WAS NO ISSUE ON MAKING A MANUAL ACTUALLY
I DON'T THINK IT TAKES NO IT REALLY DOES DOESN'T TAKE TIME TO LEARN I THINK
WE TOOK IT S IT'S SO EASY WE HAVE SO LITTLE BUTTON EVERYTHING SPEAKS FOR ITSELF REALLY
SO I THINK THAT'S YEAH WE DIDN'T IT'S EITHER TWO OR ONE I GUESS
MAYBE IT'S A TWO BECAUSE D UH THE L. C. D. IS A LITTLE IS A LITTLE NEW AND THERE IS THERE ARE SOME OPTION HIDDEN UNDER THE MENU BUTTON
NO Y I MEAN IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN THE SMALL SCREEN
THE THEY DIDN'T REALLY DEFINE IN WHAT SHOULD BE USED FOR
BUT I THINK IN FOR EXAMPLE LIKE T. V. GUIDES I THINK THAT'S THAT TH THAT YOU CAN TRANSMIT THROUGH IT AND EVERYTHING
NOW WE GAVE IT ENOUGH THOUGHT THOUGH
UH THE SHAPE I SHAPE IS I
YEAH SPECIAL CO BUT WE TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT IT'S CUSTOMISABLE TO THE FASHI
WE DON'T HAVE IT WE DO HAVE IT IT'S JUST SOLD AS A PACKAGE
BECAUSE YOU HA IT'S JUST NOT AFFORDABLE AT THE MOMENT
IT'S POSSIBLE BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR THE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING IT IN A F A DIFFERENT COLOUR
IT'S OKAY BUT THAT'S YO M MOSTLY IT'S IT'S INFLUENCED BY THE FACT THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT SPEECH RECOGNITION
WE COULD HAVE USED IT MORE EFFICIENTLY WE JUST DIDN'T THINK OF IT THAT WAY
I THINK WE DIV I THINK WE DID VERY WELL UH EV EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THIS SCORE WE DID QUITE WELL
THEY SH THEY SHOULD GET KIDS AND JUST STICK 'EM IN T. V. AND SAY CHANGE THE CHANNEL
UH IT'S JUST NOT IT IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE
OR YOUR SH YOU SHOULD LOSE THE L. C. D. SCREEN PROBABLY BUT I THINK THAT'S I THINK THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS MORE WORTH THAN SPEECH RECOGNITION
LET'S SEE WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE THE ANOTHER ONE
GENERAL PROJECT WHAT'S I IN FOR EXAMPLE I THOU I THOUGHT WE WERE PRETTY CREATIVE IN WHAT WE CREATED
WE TOOK THE WHOLE NEW APPROACH OF MAKING EXCHANGEABLE COVER FOR EXAMPLE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY CREATIVE BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER NEVER EVER LISTED SOMEWHERE
SAY LOOK THIS IS YOU'RE DOING THE WRONG THING YOU'RE S YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME NOW BECAUSE WE'RE IMPLEMENTING STUFF THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD
SO IT WOULD BE BETTER IF Y IF THERE WAS MORE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN UH BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WOULD W YOU WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY DO
IT DIDN'T HAVE OR DIDN'T KNEW WHAT THEY COSTS OR WHATEVER
IT'S A LITTLE LESS IT THE RESPONSE TIME IS LE IT'S VERY BAD
BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO CHECK EITHER ONE OF THOSE TWO
YOU CAN JUST PREVIEW YOUR P YOU CAN JUST PREVIEW YOUR PAGE IN THE IN THE PROGRAMME
OKAY BEFORE STARTING A NE A NEW PAGE
BECAUSE YOU WOULD AVOID MAKING DOING EXTRA WORK BECAUSE YOU WERE DOING EXTRA WORK NOW UH M WORKING ON THE ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
YOU HAVE LIMITATION BOTH ON THE TECHNICAL ON THE D ON THE DESIGN SIDE
BUT THAT'S I THINK IT'S MORE OF A A SETTING HERE THAT YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE THAN UH THAN SOMEWHERE ELSE
I'M NOT SURE I I'M NOT SURE YOU GOT SPAMMED AS WELL
BUT I GET SPAMMED LIKE EVERY T EVERY TWO MINUTES THERE WAS A THERE WAS ANOTHER EMAIL ABOUT MASTER CLASSES OR SOMETHING
SO I'D I HAD NO EXTRA INFORMATION TO GO ON THAT ONE THAN WHAT YOU GIVE ME ACTUALLY
OR IS THAT A 'CAUSE UH YEAH IT'S WELL PROBABLY IS
UH OKAY THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT
UH
I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE SHOULD STILL DO THOUGH UH T LET'S SEE WHAT ALL YOUR TASKS WERE FINISHED RIGHT
WHAT YOU HA FROM YOUR ASSISTANT
JUST OH THINK OF A CATCHY NAME
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO RESEMBLE A BANANA
STEP INTO THE FUTURE OF OF REMOTE CONTROLLING YOUR T. V.
JUST WRITE OUT TRIPLE LIKE A WORD TRIPLE R. C. TRIPLE STRIPE OH
UH I THINK THAT THE THE R. C. TOGETHER TAKES AWAY THE THE THE IMAGE OF IT'S A TRIPLE
AND IT'S ESPECIALLY ON THE TRIPLE R. THAT'S IMPORTANT
I THINK TRIPLE R. IS COOL
SEE
COULD YOU GUYS DRAW ME A PICTURE OF THE FINAL DESIGN TO PUT ON THE COVER OF THE REPORT
NO MUCH S
IF WE TAKE ANOTHER COVER FOR INSTANCE BLACK THEN WE ALSO NEED ANOTHER BUTTON FRAME 'CAUSE BLACK AND BLACK DOESN'T WORK OBVIOUSLY
OR SAY LET'S LOSE RUBBER TAKE PLASTIC
WE CAN PUT THOSE TO THE TO THE OTHER COVERS
PERHAPS WE SHOULD MAKE M
PERHAPS THEY DECIDE THA
PERHAPS THEY UH NO BUT PERHAPS THEY THINK UH OKAY THE COVER IS SUCH A NICE IDEA
WE CA WE UH WE CAN AT LEAST TELL THEM THAT
NO I'M NOT UH TALKING ABOUT THAT COST BUT THE ONE THAT G HAS GIVEN US THE ORDER TO DESIGN THIS
WE COULD AT LEAST M UH MAKE IT LIKE THIS LIKE YOU SAID AND THEN TELL THEM OKAY
ME TOO I FELT A BIT BLIND THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING I HAD NO LIST OF AVAILABLE MATERIALS
ONE
I THINK THE L. C. D. DISPLAY COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT THEN A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL BUT THEN AGAIN IT'S FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
AH
THINGS LIKE BRIGHTNESS AND UH THOSE KIND OF THINGS WE'VE PUT IN THE MENU BECAUSE WE HAVE NO BUTTONS FOR THOSE
M
BUT IF PEP PEOPLE REALLY WANT SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN THEY MUST BE PREPARED TO PU TO PAY MORE BECAUSE IT'S CANNOT BE DONE FOR THIS
AH BUT FOR THIS PRICE UH YOU CANNOT ASK THAT
OH IT'S ALSO MORE ATTRACTIVE
EVERYBODY WAS USING MATERIALS THAT S I DIDN'T HAVE
BUT THERE'S UH ALSO ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS I NOTICED
UH YOU HAVE TO FINISH A PAGE BEFORE GOING TO A N
SO WE CANNOT WORK ON MORE THAN ONE PAGE AT SAME TIME
OKAY BRING OUT THE BEER
I HAVE NO MORE EMAIL
IT'S BETTER THAN THI I THINK THAN A SERIAL NUMBER
UH
NUMBERS ARE SO MEANINGLESS TO THE PEOPLE
SO THAT THE FIRST THREE LETTERS ARE S THE SAME
R. E. A. R. E. A.
AH
I WOULD LOSE THE C. AND JUST NAME IT TRIPLE R.
SEE YOU IN A MINUTE
IS IT OKAY IF I TRY
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU
OKAY IT HAS BEEN SAVING SOMETHING BUT WHERE TO I DON'T KNOW
OH CAN I SAY EXP YES I CAN
THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO GONNA DRAW IT AGAIN
ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT
OH IT'S EXPORT
OH OF COURSE
UH S
BASICALLY IN WHAT WE DISCUSSED COVER AND BUTTONS WILL BE MADE OF RUBBER YELLOW COLOUR BLACK COMPONENTS AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT OVER HERE
WE CHOSE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF COLOUR FOR THE MENU
A BIT DARKER YELLOW SO THAT IT COM REALLY SHOWS IN THIS KEYPAD
THAT'S THE BE
AND IT I GUESS IT'S MORE EASIER TO JUST PAINT IT ON THE RUBBER THAN TO UH
WE CHOSE THE BUTTONS TO BE UH TELETEXT OKAY BUTTON FAVOURITE CHANNEL AND THE MUTE
SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE CHOSE THERE
I'D SAY THAT TOO
WELL I'D I TEND TO DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT BECAUSE THE TREND ISSUE WAS A BIG ISSUE WHEN WE STARTED DESIGNING THIS
WE COULD TAKE OUT A CURVE INDEED
SO WHICH CURVE IS THAT BA THAT'S BASICALLY THAT CURVE
NO THAT IT WOULD TURN OUT TO BE A PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD REMOTE CONTROL
I WOULD SAY I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON THE COLOUR BECAUSE THAT'S AN EXTRA OPTION
ONE I D NO ACTU
OR WE COULD SAY IT
OR WE COULD SAY NEUTRAL WE 'CAUSE WE SCRATCHED THE
YES BUT THE END PRODUCT SO
IS TWO TWO THIRD
YEAH IF WE MAKE IT INTO A FOUR AS IN NEUTRAL BECAUSE WE DIDN'T IMPLEMENT IT
WE COME OUT ON A AVERAGE OF TWO ONE EIGHTH
IT'S AT LEAST ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
THE DIGITAL PEN WAS DEFINITELY BETTER TO DRAW MY IDEAS AND TO
OH CAN YOU
YEAH WELL IT COULD ALSO POSSIBLY BE WELL IS IT A MORE REAL TIME INFORMATION BASE SO WE CAN ALL SEE WHICH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO ONE ANOTHER
IS THAT WE FINISHED UP THE DESIGN AND THEN WE CHECKED THE WEBSITE AND THEN THERE WAS JUST EXTRA INFORMATION
THERE WAS A LITTLE DELAY IN THE BIT OF A C
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE WEBSITE WHICH WILL HELP US OUT
IS THAT A NAME OR A C CAMPAIGN
SO THAT'S ONE OPTION
SHOULD I WRITE THE BANANA DOWN OR
IS IT TRIPLE R. C. S
TRIPLE R. IT IS
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHETHER WE CAN SAVE IT AS A PICTURE OR NO
I WOULDN'T PICK THAT ONE NO
BUT UH THE AND
THE PEOPLE WANT TO PAY FOR FOR IT SO WHY WHY UH DO WE HAVE TO KEEP US UH UH UM ON THE TWELVE AND A HALF
I HOPE THE PEOPLE WILL LIKE IT BUT
LET'S UM SEE UM
UH
OKAY LET'S EVAL EVALUATE UH THE PRODUCT OF US OUR DESIGN
I UH WILL PRE PRESENT UH SOME STATEMENTS AND WE WILL DECIDED TOGETHER WHA WHAT IF IT'S TRUE OR FALSE AND UH THEN WE SEE UH IF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE USER ARE FULFILLED OR NOT
OH THE MENU BUTTON IS IT
HI OH OKAY
S IT'S TRUE
SO D
LOOK AND FEEL IS EVERYBO IT'S TRUE
AND THE NEXT ONE UH YEAH WHEN IT'S LOST UH YOU CAN FIND IT
TO
UH W WE HAD WE DON'T HAVE AN UH
OH SO IT
TAKES NO TI
AND THE L. C. D. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT
