HERE WE GO
WELCOME EVERYBODY
UM I'M ABIGAIL CLAFLIN
YOU CAN CALL ME ABBIE
'S SEE
POWERPOINT THAT'S NOT IT
THERE WE GO
SO THIS IS OUR KICK OFF MEETING
UM
AND I GUESS WE SHOULD ALL GET ACQUAINTED
LET'S SHALL WE ALL INTRODUCE OURSELVES
I THINK WE'LL GET AROUND TO THAT YEAH
SO THIS IS JUST INTRODUCTIONS YEAH
OKAY
I FORGOT TO S SAY I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER BUT I FIGURED YOU ALL KNEW THAT ALREADY UM SO
OKAY
UM SO F HERE'S OUR AGENDA FOR TODAY
UM WE'RE GONNA DO SOME TOOL TRAINING PROJECT PLAN AND DISCUSS
THEN CLOSE
UM SO
SO OUR AIM IS TO PRODUCE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT IS ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
AND TO DO THIS WE HAVE TO UM THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS WE HAVE TO CONSIDER ABOUT FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS AND CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE THING
SO
WE'LL GET TO THAT
OH THERE IT IS
RIGHT
FUNCTIONAL DESIGN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DETAILED DESIGN
SO THROUGHOUT OUR NEXT COUPLE OF MEETINGS WE'LL WE'LL BE COVERING THESE THINGS
UM SO WE'RE GONNA TRY OUT OUR WHITE BOARD
IF WE'LL ALL DRAW OUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL TO SUM UP THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
OKAY
YEAH
BOTH
YEAH
ANY VOLUNTEERS
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THEY WANNA DRAW
I DON'T THINK SO
A DOLPHIN
'S LIKE PLAYING PICTIONARY
SO WHAT CHARACTERISTICS DO YOU LIKE ABOUT YOUR ANIMAL
THEY'RE GRACEFUL
SLEEK
I DON'T KNOW HOW INTELLIGENT THAT ONE LOOKS
YES
DOES ANYBODY ELSE WANNA DRAW THEIR ANIMAL
UH OH THERE GOES THE TEN
IT'S A CAT
DO YOU WANNA ANYTHING
I DUNNO IF THE THE AH
A HORSE
THAT'S VERY GOOD
YEAH
THIS CORD'S
UH
RIGHT
ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF ANYTHING YET
UH
IT'S A PIG
SO I'M THINKING WE SHOULD DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S
WATER RESISTANT STRONG AND FURRY
WHAT DO YOU THINK YEAH
THIS IS YEAH WELL LIKE A CAT YOU KNOW SOFT YEAH
ALTHOUGH UH I'LL JUST PUT THERE
RIGHT
OH MY GOSH THIS IS DISASTROUS
SORRY ABOUT THAT
OKAY
SO MOVING ON
OUR SELLING PRICE GOAL IS TWENTY FIVE EURO AND PROFIT AIM IS FIFTY MILLION EURO
SO I'M GUESSING THAT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY IN SCOTLAND WE'RE IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRY
UM AND WE WILL HOPE TO SELL THIS INTERNATIONALLY
UM SELLING PRICE IS TWENTY FIVE EURO
PROFIT AIM FIFTY MILLION EURO
ANYONE A MATHEMATICIAN
SO F THAT'S A FIFTY PERCENT UM UH
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE MEAN BECAUSE I DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE THE SLIDE SHOW
EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTE CONTROL
SO I GUESS WE HAVE TO REFLECT ON OUR EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS TO DECIDE WHAT UM WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN A CONVENIENT PRACTICAL
NICE REMOTE CONTROL
UM SO DO WE HAVE ANY INITIAL IDEAS FOR UH HOW THIS REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE DESIGNED OR FORMATTED OR THE THE BUTTONS IT SHOULD HAVE
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN YOU HAVE IT FOR THE PORTABLE PHONE SO WHY NOT YEAH
WHAT IF IT HAD SOMETHING LIKE UM
JUST LIKE A MAGNET ON THE BACK OF IT AND YOU COULD I MEAN J JUST TO HAVE SOME PLACE TO PUT IT BESIDES LIKE A BASE
YOU KNOW LIKE A PORTABLE PHONE HAS A BASE LIKE JUST TO HAVE A HOME FOR IT
'CAUSE PEOPLE JUST STICK IT ON TOP OF THEIR T. V. BUT THE POINT OF HAVING A REMOTE IS NOT TO HAVE TO WALK OVER TO THE T. V. SO
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE WE SHOULD DESIGN COUCHES THAT HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL IN THE SIDE ARM
YEAH
DO YOU THINK IT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER TO NOT LOSE OR DOES THAT NOT FACTOR IN
LIKE
HAND HAND HELD SIZE YEAH
NOT NOT HUGE BUT
HUH
LITTLE HOMING DEVICE
UM
OKAY
SO WHAT DO WE THINK THIS REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD
FIVE MINUTES
TILL THE MEETING OH RIGHT
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE LEFT
UM OH WE JUST
YEAH
YOU WHAT IF UM MAY BE A LITTLE FANCY BUT WHAT IF IT HAD LIKE A LITTLE SCREEN
SO IT HAS LESS BUTTONS BUT IT STILL HAS ALL THE FUNCTIONS
LIKE THE WAY A MOBILE PHONE DOES
SO YOU COULD LIKE UM LIKE IF YOU HAVE I DUNNO IF YOU HAVE SATELLITE IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED CHANNELS
YOU CAN THE WAY YOU DO IT ON YOUR RADIO IS THAT YOU UH WHAT DO YOU CALL IT S Y YEAH BUT YOU CAN PROGRAMME
SO YOU CAN PROGRAMME LIKE YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS SO LIKE IF YOU HAD A S
THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD DECIDE
MM
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
I MEAN WE HAVE TO REMEMBER OUR BUDGET IS TWELVE POINT TWELVE FIFTY FOR TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE DEVICE
UM BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT YEAH
I MEAN WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW MUCH THAT WOULD BE
YEAH
OH I WAS JUST
YEAH
MAYBE UM JUST LIKE A SIMPLE THING TO HAVE A CLIP ON IT LIKE SO YOU CAN CLIP IT TO YOUR LIKE THAT'S ANOTHER
UM
WE SHOULD PROBABLY START WRAPPING UP UM WE'VE GOT SOME INITIAL IDEAS THAT WE CAN ALL LOOK INTO
UM AND COME UP WITH SOME NEW ONES FOR THE NEXT MEETING WHICH WILL BE IN ANOTHER THIRTY MINUTES
UM
SO
YEAH
THE
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WHAT DOES THAT STAND FOR I. D. YEAH UM IS GOING TO BE LOOKING MORE INTO THE WORKING DESIGN
SO I GUESS YOU'D BE LOOKING AT LOTS OF THE THINGS WE DISCUSSED ABOUT SCREEN AND UM THAT SORT OF THING
THE
SOMETHING WHAT IS THE U. I.
YEAH WHAT DOES IT STAND FOR AGAIN
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
SO THAT'S GONNA BE
MORE TECHNICAL
I GUESS THAT MAYBE THE WORKING DESIGN HAS ALSO TO DO WITH LIKE THE PHYSICAL FEAT LIKE JUST THE WAY IT LOOKS AND THE WAY IT W
YEAH YEAH
UM I GUESS YOU'D HAVE TO FIND OUT
MM
AND THE M. E. WHAT DOES THAT STAND FOR
M
MARKETING RIGHT
UM
SO WE'LL BE WORKING ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS UM
YEAH
SO I GUESS THAT WRAPS IT UP
I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN THIRTY MINUTES
I JUST DID
I'M KRISTA AND I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
SUPPOSE I CAN DRAW AN ANIMAL YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
THEY SLEEP ALL DAY THEY'RE EASY TO DRAW
I THINK THE PEN IS RUNNING OUT OF
TWO MILLION
OH YEAH
WELL THAT'S WHY IT'S ALWAYS IN THE COUCH
NO IT REALLY WOULDN'T BE
YEAH I AGREE
B. BUTTON AND THE F. BUTTON THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING
YEAH I THINK SO
USER
THE WORKING DESIGN IS THE STRUCTURE
UM
IT WAS IN THE EMAIL
I WROTE DOWN WHAT MINE WERE
MARKETING
I'M STEPHANIE AND I AM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
SO YOU WANT US TO DRAW IT AND THEN TALK ABOUT IT
OR JUST DRAW IT
OKAY
WHY DON'T WE DO BOTH
RIGHT
MM I GOTTA THINK ABOUT IT FOR A SECOND LIKE
UH
DOES IT HAVE TO BE FUNCTIONAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
UM
OKAY I'LL DRAW
I'LL DRAW ONE
MAKE SURE MY THINGS HERE
UH OH
RIGHT
OKAY MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS SEE
OOPS
YEAH IT'S
YEAH I GUESS IT HAS A FIN ON TOP TOO YEAH
IT'S MY DOLPHIN
I LIKE ITS TAIL
UM NO I THINK DOLPHINS ARE REALLY UH I DUNNO
THEY'RE SMART AND THEY THEY'RE CUTE AND THEY LIKE SWIMMING AND THAT'S COOL LIKE THEY'RE GRACEFUL YEAH AND THEY'RE SO
YEAH THEY'RE SLEEK AND THEY LOOK INTELLIGENT AND I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE I GUESS IT'S THE WHOLE LIKE BINOCULAR VISION THING
YEAH HE HE DOESN'T LOOK THAT SMART
HE'S A I DUNNO UM THEY'RE I THINK IT'S COOL THE THE UM THE INTERACTION THAT OR THE TH THINGS THAT THE REASONS PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE YOU KNOW YOU GET EX YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE SITTING ON THE BEACH AND P THEY'RE LIKE OH LOOK THERE'S DOLPHINS AND IT'S KINDA LIKE BUT THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY JUMP AROUND IN THE WATER AND THEY'RE HAPPY AND THEY'RE MAMMALS
BUT THEY SWIM
AND THE PEN'S DYING
HORSE
AND FURRY
TEXTILE TACTILE TACTILE REMOTE CONTROL
YOU'RE DRAGGING A YOU HAVE A TAIL
SORRY CAN YOU JUST SAY THAT WHAT'S THE WHAT ARE OUR PRICE GOALS AGAIN
OKAY
I WAS THINKING THAT TOO
I THINK WE SHOULD DESIGN SOMETHING THAT HAS LIKE A SO YOU CAN LIKE SOMEHOW LIKE YOU I MEAN YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHERE YOUR T. V. IS
SO JUST HAVE A CALL BUTTON I'VE ALWAYS WANTED THAT
SO LIKE YOU CAN PUSH A BUTTON ON YOUR T. V. YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO YOU SHOULD HAVE A CALL BUTTON ON YOUR TELEVISION TO BE ABLE TO FIND YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T YEAH I MEAN IT BUT LIKE I MEAN JUST I MEAN LIKE YOUR PHONE EVEN JUST HAS SO LIKE IT CAN VIBRATE
IT CAN LIGHT UP AND MAKE NOISE AND I DUNNO
YEAH
YEAH OR IF IT HAD A YEAH
YEAH I MEAN
YEAH
YEAH IN IN THE COUCH
I DUNNO IT SEEMS LIKE THOUGH THAT THAT WOULD BE HARD 'CAUSE YOU NOT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE LAZY ANYWAY AND
YEAH SO WE THE PROJECT IS NOW COUCHES AND REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH
YEAH
BIGGER
HAND SIZED
IT CAN'T BE THAT HARD TO PUT SOME KIND OF A NOISE ON IT
OR LIKE OR LIKE A LIGHT THING
YOU KNOW
I DUNNO
YEAH
OR MAKE IT MOBILE SO IT RUNS AROUND AND COMES COME FIND YOU YEAH
THAT WOULD BE REALLY I'M SURE WE COULD DO THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS A POP
YEAH
UH
I ALSO THINK THOUGH THAT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS
'CAUSE I HATE THAT WHEN THEY HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS AND I MEAN I KNOW IT HAS TO HAVE ENOUGH FUNCTIONS BUT LIKE
I DON'T KNOW YOU JUST HAVE LIKE EIGHT THOUSAND BUTTONS AND YOU'RE LIKE NO YOU NEVER USE HALF OF THEM
SO
THAT WOULD BE COOL
YEAH
I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE YEAH
I GUESS THEY WOULD GO TOGETHER SOMEHOW
I DUNNO
I'M THINKING KIND OF
OR LIKE YOU H YOU SEE THOSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE I'M THINKING OF LIKE CELEBRITY CRIBS KIND OF THINGS WHEN LIKE THEY HAVE ALL THOSE THESE THINGS THAT AT THEIR HOUSE YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR ENTIRE HOUSE IS SO ELECTRONIC
AND THEY HAVE LIKE THIS ONE MASTER CONTROL THAT AND IT'S LIKE A HAND HELD LIKE TURNS ON EVERYTHING SORT OF CONTROL AND IT HAS LIKE A SCREEN AND LIKE SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A SCREEN
I DON'T KNOW IF IT MUST BE IT WOULD PROBABLY MUST BE EX TOO EXPENSIVE THOUGH T LIKE I DUNNO
YEAH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
MM
WELL I GUESS WE HAVE TO GET TO THAT LATER YEAH
FURRY
YEAH
MM MM
YEAH
THAT'S ME
UH USER INTERFACE DESIGN
SO TECHNICAL FUNCTION
WHAT IS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS EXACTL I I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT
IT DOES BUT IT I JUST DON'T REALLY
YEAH
WHAT EFFECT SHOULD THE THING HA SHOULD IT HAVE OKAY
ALRIGHT
AND WORKING DESIGN
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
ALRIGHT
AND HOW IT WORKS OKAY
RIGHT
I'M I'M ON TASK
HI I'M CHIARA I'M THE UM MARKETING EXPERT
UM WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TALK ABOUT MY AIMS AT THE MOMENT
OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO JUST SAY MY NAME AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT BUSINESS LATER
WE'LL GET ROUND TO THAT LATER
MY NAME IS CHIARA AND I'M THE MARKETING EXPERT
I THINK BOTH
WHO STARTS
WE OUGHT TO DECIDE WHO STARTS AND ALL THAT
NO
UH-HUH
UH YEAH
WELL I HAD THE CAT AS WELL BUT UH I'VE GOT A SPARE ONE
SO I'LL USE THE SPARE ONE
UM BUT IT'S HARDER TO DRAW UM
UM
UH
UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THE LEGS GO BUT ANYWAY I WILL DO THAT
UM AND THE MAIN REASON IS THEY'RE PRETTY
I THINK THEY'RE VERY PRETTY AND THEY GO WELL WITH THE ENVIRONMENT
AND I LIKE THE WAY THEY RUN AND I USED TO DO HORSE RIDING AND THEY'RE JUST VERY SORT OF STURDY AND NICE ANIMALS
AND I LIKE THE WAY UM THEY FEEL SORT OF UNDER UNDER THE HAND I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
UM
HOW MANY SHOULD WE SELL THEN
UM A LOT TWO TWO TWO MILLION TWO MI NO MORE F FOUR MILLION
FOUR MILLION
AND IT WELL IT'S THE PROFIT SO IF A PROFIT FOR EACH IS TWELVE FIFTY THAT'LL DO FOUR MILLION
IT IS A LOT
UH
UM I THINK ONE THING IS THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND BEC YEAH BEC
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
AND EVEN I THINK A LITTLE LIGHT
UM OR EVEN A MAYBE A VIB A VIBRATING THING
I DUNNO BUT SOMETH BECAUSE IT'S USUALLY UNDER THE SOFA
IN WHICH CASE YOU'RE GOING TO BE L BUT IF IT HAS A SORT OF SIGNAL WHICH ISN'T ANY SOUND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S EXPENSIVE MAYBE TO
MAYBE CALL IS ENOUGH
BUT YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT EVEN JUST A THING TO ATTACH IT TO THE W YOU KNOW IF YOU HAD A THING A PRETTY OBJECT ATTACHED TO THE WALL
BUT THAT WOULD REALLY MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE
BUT IT'S ONLY A PLASTIC THING R REALLY THE THING ON THE WALL
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND THE OTHER THING IS
NOT WELL IT NEEDS TO BE SORT OF
YEAH
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED A
BUT DEFINITELY NOT WELL I DON'T KNOW
NO IT CAN'T BE UH UH
LIKE SPACESHIP
RIGHT
UM
OH DEAR
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SELECT
UH
BUT WOULD YOU HAVE THE SCREEN ON THE THING OR WOULD YOU HAVE IT ON THE TELLY TRANSMITTING THE SCREEN
BECAUSE
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S I THINK IT'S E EXPENSIVE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU USE THE TELLY SCREEN 'CAUSE THE TELLY'S ALREADY A SCREEN
THEN YOU CAN PRO SORT OF HAVE A PROGRAMMING FUNCTION
REALLY EASY SORT OF ARROW UP AND DOWN ON THE REMOTE AND THEN USE THE TELLY AS A SCREEN
BUT UM
BUT YEAH FOR SURE
SOMETHING LIKE NOT IT'S NOT ON THE BUTTON BUT IT'S TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN
RIGHT
MM
YEAH
BUT LIKE MOBILE PHONES HAVE SCREENS AND THEY'RE CHEAP
YEAH
OR SOME IT I WE CAN FIND OUT PROBABLY ON THE INTERNET HOW MUCH IT'S
UM
YEAH AND THE OTHER THING YOU SAID THAT THING ABOUT ROBUST AND WATER UM
WHAT WAS THE WORD
WATER RESISTANT
NO BUT IT'S I THOUGHT AH SPOT ON
GOOD FEEL TACT TACTILE GOOD TACTILE FEEL MAYBE SOMETHING DIDN DOESN'T MAKE YOUR HANDS SWEAT LOT
THAT'S QUITE ANNOYING
YEAH CLIP
OOH
UM
IT SAYS ON THAT EMAIL BUT IT
IT SAID UM
IT SAID
YEAH LIKE
BE A MEDIUM BETWEEN YOU AND THE TELLY I THINK THAT'S UH
MARKETING
OH IT'S WRITTEN HERE BUT UM
OKAY
'KAY SO WE'LL TRY TO ZIP THROUGH THIS SINCE WE'RE SHORT ON TIME
WELCOME EVERYBODY
UM HOPE YOUR SESSIONS WENT WELL
UM SO THIS IS OUR FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER UM USER NEEDS TECHNICAL EFFECTS AND THE WORKING DESIGN OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL
UM I'VE BEEN TAKING MEETINGS ON THE MINUTE MINUTES ON THE MEETINGS
AND I'LL BE PUTTING THEM IN THE SHARED DOCUMENTS FOLDER SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED TO REFER TO YOU CAN FIND THEM IN THERE
UM I I'LL GET THE ONES UP FOR NEXT TIME UM THEY'RE NOT FINISHED YET
RIGHT
UM SO CAN WE HAVE UPDATES FROM EVERYONE FROM WHAT YOU'VE WORKED ON JUST KIND OF A QUICK SUMMARY OF ANYTHING INTERESTING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE OR DISCUSS IN THIS SURE
HM
NO ANY ANY ORDER'S FINE
YEAH
OH YEAH SORRY
IT SH IT TAKES A FEW SECONDS I THINK
UH-HUH AND THEN PRESS FUNCTION
AND F. EIGHT
HERE WE ARE
OH
IS IT ON
OKAY
HM
'KAY
YEAH
JUST MOVE RIGHT ON
UH FUNCTION F. EIGHT
IT'S THE LITTLE BLUE W IT'S THE ONE TH YEAH
YEAH SHOULD BE
IT SHOULD BE YEAH
'KAY
OKAY
WELL THANK YOU EVERYBODY
UM WE HAVE WE'LL DISCUSS THAT AND THEN I JUST WANNA MENTION SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS THAT CAME IN
UM TELETEXT IS APPARENTLY OUTDATED SO DUE TO INTERNET POPULARITY SO THAT'S OFF THE LIST
UM
ALSO OUR REMOTE SHOULD BE USED ONLY FOR TELEVISION UM NO EXTRA INTERNET KINDA FANCY THINGS JUST THE REMOTE AND THE TELEVISION
UM AND ALSO WE NEED TO INCORPORATE OUR CORPORATE IMAGE ONTO THIS SO UM THE
PHRASE IS WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS SO LET'S BE FASHIONABLE I GUESS
UM IF WE HAVE SOMETHING I MEAN SILVER AND AND GOLD OR YELLOW ARE OUR COLOURS
SO IF WE HAD A LIKE A KIND OF SILVER ONE LIKE YOU SAW AND YELLOW WRITING SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OKAY
UM
SO WE NEED TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
UM
YEAH
DO LET'S I GUESS WE SHOULD YEAH MAKE SOME
KIND OF BRAINSTORMING SEE WHAT WE CAN
WHA WHAT UM WELL PROBABLY OUR TARGET GROUP AND HOW IT'S GONNA GOING TO APPEAL TO OUR TARGET GROUP AND I DUNNO THE THE S THE BUTTONS AND WHAT IT DOES AND THAT SORT OF THING
SO
I THINK THAT SEEMS TO YEAH
MM
YEAH TEENAGERS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS
OH UH
YEAH
MM
AND IF IF YOU CONSIDER OUR BUDGET IT PROBABLY IF YOU CONSIDER OUR BUDGET
TO H HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION PROGRAMMED IN EVERY SINGLE REMOTE MIGHT BE A LITTLE PRICEY
YEAH
RIGHT SO UM YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
SO YOU YOU'D NEED LIKE A SEPARATE BASE FOR THAT OR LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
SO DO YOU THINK EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SPEEK SPEECH RECOGNITION OUR TARGET GROUP SHOULD STILL BE TEENAGERS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS
HUH
OKAY
YEAH
WE PROBABLY LEAVE THAT
I MEAN I GUESS ONE TAKES CARE OF THE OTHER LIKE UM IF YOU CAN YEAH IF YOU CAN CALL IT THEN IT'S
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND LIKE IF THE IF THE PHONE'S UNDER THE COUCH YOU MIGHT NOT SEE THE LIGHT SO YEAH
SO I MEAN THE TWO REMOTES THAT YOU HAD SHOWN R I DON'T REMEMBER WHO SHOWED THEM YEAH YOU YOU DID UM
THEY'RE I MEAN ONE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FOR V. C. R. TYPE THING AND THE OTHER LOOKED LIKE JUST TELEVISION
OH REALLY
'CAUSE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHETHER WE WANT TO HAVE V. C. R. CAPABILITIES
THEY'RE NOT NO
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
BUT D. V. D. PROBABLY IS
AND AND IF WE'RE IF WE'RE TARGETING YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AND TEENAGERS I MEAN IT'S GONNA BE D. V. D. TYPE THAT'S THE THE TECHNOLOGY THESE DAYS
YEAH
YEAH
S
HUH
YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN SOME REMOTES THAT WHERE YOU JUST HOLD ONE
LIKE IF YOU HOLD ONE DOWN IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT COLOUR THAN THE OTHER BUTTONS BUT THAT TURNS IT ON
SO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A SEPARATE POWER BUTTON IT'S JUST
BUT
IT MIGHT BE CONFUSING
YEAH
YEAH
BESIDES YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO POWER
I HAVE THE POWER I GUESS
SO WE DEFINITELY WANT A POWER BUTTON AND NUMBERS
RIGHT
MM
MM
YEAH
OH THAT'S GONNA
IS THAT LIKE ON ON A MOUSE PAD WHERE LIKE KIND OF OKAY
I'VE NEVER USED ONE
NO
OKAY
OKAY
WELL I
WE COULD WE COULD EVEN HAVE FOUR BUTTONS LIKE IF THAT'S THE IF THAT'S THE MOUSE
YOU COULD HAVE THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL CHANGERS JUST LIKE ON THAT AS WELL
HUH
SO IT'S LIKE HOLDING
YOU CAN O
AND YOU
YOU IS THERE AN EXTRA ACTUAL BUTTON
OR ARE YOU ACTUALLY YOU'RE JUST USING THE MOUSE TO GO UP AND DOWN
LIKE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
WELL I MEAN IF IF YOU'RE GONNA THIS FOR CHANNELS RIGHT THEN Y WOULDN'T THE VOLUME NEED TO BE SEPARATE SOMEHOW
LIKE YOU COULD JUST HAVE
OH LIKE
OH YOU COULD ACTUALLY
YEAH
IS THAT WHAT MAKES THEM EXPENSI I THINK IT'S ALL OF THEY HAVE SO MUCH MEMORY THOUGH THAT'S IT'S
YEAH
I THINK IT'S THE UH H IT'S THEIR CAPABILI I MEAN THEY IT CAN HOLD WHAT LIKE FIVE THOUSAND SONGS OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
S
MM
UM
YOU KNOW ACTUALLY OUR OUR NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
I'M NOT SURE IF THEY MEANT O ONL USE ONLY FOR TELEVISION AS IN NOT FOR D. V. D. OR JUST NOT INTERNET TYPE THINGS
SO I'LL I'LL CHECK THAT AND UPDATE YOU ON THE NEXT BUT WE'LL HOLD OFF ON THAT 'CAUSE
BUT S YEAH UH
YEAH
MM
MM
YEAH
BUT I
YEAH
UM YEAH LET'S THINK ABOUT IT 'CAUSE WE NEED TO WRAP UP
UM LET'S SEE
UM SO EVERYONE'S GONNA GO FINISH THEIR QUESTIONNAIRE UH THEN WHEN WE COME BACK AFTER LUNCH WE'LL HAVE THIRTY MINUTES OF INDIVIDUAL WORK
UM YEAH SO THINK ABOUT THE THINGS WE'VE DISCUSSED AND BRING SOME NEW IDEAS TO OUR NEXT MEETING
SEE YOU SOON
JUST UH
YOU MAY NEED TO
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO IT IT'S LIKE A THREE SET SETTING CYCLE SO PRESS IT A COUPLE TIMES HOLD DOWN FUNCTION AND THEN PRESS F. EIGHT
ADJUSTING
THE CABLE MIGHT BE A LITTLE LOOSE OR SOMETHING
OH YOU GOT IT
HOW DO I UM
RIGHT
OKAY SO THIS IS ON THE WORKING DESIGN WHICH IS SORT OF THE UH MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE
UM AND THE METHOD I USED WAS TO BASICALLY LOOK AT EXISTING DESIGNS AND INCORPORATE IDEAS FROM OUR LAST MEETING
UM SO I THINK WE NEED TWO BASIC FUNCTIONS WHICH IS JUST THE BASIC REMOTE FUNCTIONS
THE USER CAN INPUT A CHANNEL OR VOLUME SETTING AND IT WILL BE OUTPUT TO THE T. V.
AND ALSO WE TALKED ABOUT UM A LOCATION FUNCTION WHERE MAYBE YOU COULD PRESS A BUTTON ON THE T. V. AND IT WOULD SEND SORT OF SIGNAL TO THE REMOTE WHERE IT WOULD BEEP OR FLASH OR VIBRATE OR WHATEVER TO TELL YOU WHERE THE REMOTE IS
SO THE COMPONENTS WE NEED ARE AN ENERGY SOURCE TO POWER THE REMOTE UM INPUT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE BUTTONS
ALTHOUGH UM WE JUST TALKED ABOUT VOICE RECOGNITION PROCESSOR TO TAKE THE INFORMATION
UM SOMETHING TO TRANSMIT IT TO THE T. V. AND WE ALSO NEED SOMETHING ON THE REMOTE THAT WOULD RECEIVE THE LOCATION SIGNAL AND HAVE AN OUTPUT
LIKE POSSIBLY A BEEP OR A VIBRATION
AND ALSO YOU NEED A SENDER FOR LOCATION SIGNAL
WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE A SEPARATE UM THING THAT WE'D HAVE TO SELL WITH THE REMOTE AND PEOPLE COULD STICK IT ON THEIR T. V. OR STICK IT ON THEIR WALL
AND THIS IS JUST SORT OF AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THE REMOTE WORKS
POWER COMES FROM THE BATTERY GOES TO THE CHIP
UM AND THEN IT IS SENT FROM THERE TO AN INFRARED BULB WHICH IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST WAY TO SEND TO THE T. V.
AND THEN FOR THE LOCATION FUNCTION YOU WOULD HAVE A SENDER ON THE T. V. WHICH WOULD OUTPUT SOME SORT OF SIGNAL
UM WE COULD USE I. R. BUT WE'D PROBABLY WANNA USE RADIO INSTEAD
THAT SIGNAL WOULD GO TO A RECEIVER WHICH IT WOULD PROCESS IT AND IT WOULD BE OUTPUT IN THE FORM OF A BUZZER OR A LIGHT LIGHTING UP
UM SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES FOR HOW TO BUILD THE REMOTE WOULD PROBABLY BE UH BATTERY FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE
THAT WAY YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PLUG IT IN UM A BUTTON PAD FOR INPUT
UM WE CAN PURCHASE A PRE MADE CHIP WHICH WILL HANDLE ALL THE PROCESSING STUFF I. R. TRANSMITTER TO COMMUNICATE TO THE T. V.
THAT'S JUST SORT OF STANDARD UM SO MOST T. V. S HAVE AN I. R. RECEIVER
PROBABLY A RADIO RECEIVER TO SEND OUT LOCATION FUNCTION AND TO RECEIVE IT AND I'D PROBABLY SAY A BUZZER FOR THE LOCATION FUNCTION ON THE REMOTE ITSELF
SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION
MM
YEAH UH I D I WAS AN ENGINEER BEFORE I CAME HERE
IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT
LOCATOR
WELL
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT BUT UH I MEAN SPEECH RECOGNITION IS REALLY HARD TO PROGRAMME
AND ALSO IF THE T. V. IS ON IT'S MAKING SOUND AND THE PEOPLE ON THE T. V. ARE TALKING
AND IF SOMEBODY SAYS LIKE ONE THEN THE T. V. 'S GONNA SWITCH ITSELF TO CHANNEL ONE
OR IT SEEMS LIKE A SILLY I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU WOULD IMPLEMENT IT
IT'S A COOL IDEA BUT
WELL YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A BUTTON ON A T. V. OR ON YOUR WALL OR SOME PLACE SINCE THE T. V. ALREADY HAS POWER
YEAH YOU CLICK THE BUTTON IT'S GONNA SEND OUT A SIGNAL AND I WAS THINKING I. R. IS LINE OF SIGHT
SO UNLESS THE REMOTE IS LIKE ACTUALLY IN FRONT OF THE T. V. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
UM SO PROBABLY LIKE A RADIO SIGNAL LIKE ON A ON A CELL PHONE
SENDS OUT A SIGNAL AND THEN THE THE REMOTE HEARS THE SIGNAL AND SO IT BEEPS PROBABLY
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD SEPARATELY BECAUSE IF THE SENDER'S ON THE REMOTE THEN YOU'D HAVE TO FIND THE REMOTE FIRST TO CLICK THE BUTTON TO FIND THE REMOTE
YEAH IT'D PROBABLY JUST STICK IT ON YOUR T. V. SO IF YOU NEED TO FIND THE REMOTE CLICK THE BUTTON
YEAH SO IT WOULD BE A TWO PART PACKAGE
YEAH I THINK SO
UM ON THE T. V. OR ON THE PHONE
UM IT SEEMED LIKE A A BEEP SEEMED THE MOST REASONABLE TO ME I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE PHONE HAS
I MEAN WHEN YOU NEED TO FIND YOUR PHONE
YOU JUST HAVE SOMEONE CALL IT AND IT STARTS RINGING SOMEWHERE AND THEN YOU CAN FIGURE OUT THAT IT'S IN THE COUCH OR WHEREVER
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF V. C. R. S ARE THE SAME ACROSS INTERNATIONAL
OKAY SO YOU'D NEED LIKE A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF BUTTONS FOR EVERYBODY'S V. C. R. S
YEAH OTHER THAN THAT REGION AND CODING THING
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH I NEVER THINK TO HOLD SOMETHING DOWN
YEAH YOU CAN HAVE THE NUMBER GOING AROUND IN THE CORNER
DOESN'T IT ROTATE THOUGH SO IT'LL BE MOVING AROUND
MM-HMM
IF IT WORKS ON AN IPOD THEN IT WORKS
I DON'T HAVE ONE
OH
YEAH
I DON'T THINK SO
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE WHEEL DEALY
YEAH
AND THEY'RE RE PROGRAMMABLE AREN'T THEY
YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR SONGS AND THEN PUT ON A DIFFERENT SET THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THEY'RE EXPENSIVE THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE COMPUTERS
MM-HMM
I
A D. V. D. IS SIMPLE YOU JUST HAVE PLAY PAUSE EJECT
AND MENU MAYBE
OH YEAH
BUT IT'S COOL TO HAVE IT ALL ON ONE BECAUSE YOU WANNA TURN IT ON THEN YOU WANNA TURN UP THE VOLUME
AND THEN YOU WANNA GO TO THE MENU SO YOU DON'T WANNA SWITCH
WELL BUT D. V. D. IS ONLY LIKE FOUR BUTTONS
OH
BUT I THINK THE CIRCLE ONLY DOES CHANNEL ISN'T APPLICABLE TO D. V. D. REALLY 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANNA BUT VOLUME IS AND VOLUME IS ACTUALLY CONTROLLED ON THE T. V. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SWITCH
YES WE CAN TRY THAT
WHO'S THAT
COULD YOU JUST PLUG IT BACK INTO HERS BECAUSE SHE HAD OH
RIGHT
SO GET THIS
OKAY SO NOW I NEED TO PRESS F. EIGHT WHAT IS IT
'KAY
WHAT'S FUNCTION
OH FUNCTION I SEE IT
THERE WE GO
OKAY
UM
THIS MY PRESENTATION ABOUT THE UH TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN AND I BASICALLY JUST TRIED TO FOCUS ON UM
JUST WHAT WHAT FUNCTIONS WE NEED AND HOW TO MAKE THAT
THE BEST FUNCTION FOR THE USER
SO UH AND I JUST SORT OF LIKE THOUGHT ABOUT IT MYSELF AND LOOKED ON THE INTERNET
AND OKAY SO BASICALLY UM I THINK I UH LIKE IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SORT OF GET THIS DONE IN A USER FRIENDLY AND FASHIONABLE WAY
UM SO I THINK THINGS LIKE UH
YOU KNOW KEEPING BUTTONS TOGETHER THAT LIKE CLOSE TOGETHER THAT UM ARE USED IN THE SAME WAY UH OR UM MAYBE THAT MAKING 'EM THE SAME COLOUR
KEEPING THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS THE UH LEAS YOU KNOW TO A MINIMUM
AND ALSO THINGS LIKE IS IT IS IT UM IS IT UH CAN YOU C Y SMALL ENOUGH LARGE ENOUGH I'M NOT SURE WE C I GUESS WE WOULD NEED TO
DO SOME RESEARCH ABOUT I WOULD ABOUT WHAT SIZE IS APPROPRIATE AND THAT SORT OF THING
UM BUT BASICALLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT TURNS ON AND OFF THE T. V.
DOES IT HAVE LIKE CAPACITY TO CHANGE THE CHANNELS
UM DOES IT DO OR DO WE NEED TO HAVE LIKE FUNCTIONS FOR CABLE OR V. C. R.
AND THEN IS IT FINDABLE AND UH HOW DO WE WANNA DO THAT
AND UM
I JUST THOUGHT THAT THESE TWO REMOTES WERE PRETTY BORING UM I DUNNO IF THIS WILL WORK BUT
AND I THINK WE CAN FIND SOMETHING THAT'S MORE FUN TO LOOK AT AND USE THAN EITHER OF THOSE
JUST I MEAN I LIKE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT BETTER JUST BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE FEWER BUTTONS
UH BUT I MEAN I THINK WE SH CAN SORT OF THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE UM LIKE COLOUR AND YOU KNOW SIZE
SHAPES THAT SORT OF THING TO BEST FIT THE USER
THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION
OKAY
YOU NEED THE LITTLE THINGY
OOH
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT LIKE I DUNNO YOU SEEM LIKE YOU KNOW ABOUT
OKAY
COOL
LIKE IN TERMS OF
HOW IT LOOKS OR LIKE WHAT IT DOES
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
SO
IS OUR TARGET GROUP THEN PEOPLE SO DO WE WANNA GO AHEAD AND DESIGN THIS THING WITH THE FINDER BUTTON
SO
OKAY
SO THE YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO THEN OUR TARGET AGE GROUP WOULD BE THE NINETEEN TO THIRTY FIVE RANGE WHAT WAS IT
OH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HU YEAH
OKAY SO ARE WE GONNA HAVE JUST SOME KIND OF A LIKE WE'LL HAVE THE BUZZER ON THE SOM LIKE ON THE T. V. ITSELF
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT
OKAY
SO IT'S NOW LIKE A TWO PART THING
OKAY
ALRIGHT
SO WE GET TO DESIGN THAT TOO
MAKE IT FASHIONABLE
UM OKAY
YEAH
THEN IT CAN LIVE ANYWHERE
YEAH
SO I YEAH
THAT WAS THAT WAS ME
I THINK W I THINK THEY'RE BOTH SORT OF JUST LIKE GENERAL REMO THEY'RE BOTH GENERAL REMOTES
AND UH
YEAH
S
UM
YEAH
SO
OKAY LET'S SEE IF I CAN I THINK STILL THOUGH IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT HARD TO TAKE LIKE JUST REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS YOU KNOW
LIKE 'CAUSE IF YOU JUST HAVE LIKE ONE MENU BUTTON THAT WORKS LIKE WITH A
YOU KNOW OR YOU CAN JUST KIND OF SCROLL THROUGH THE OPTIONS U THAT COME UP ON THE T. V.
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD BE HARD THOUGH
I MEAN LIKE BECAUSE UNLESS YOU KNOW YEAH
JUST 'CAUSE I WOULDN'T I WOULD PROBABLY PICK IT UP AND JUST BE LIKE UH WHY IS THERE NO ON BUTTON
YEAH
B YEAH
YEAH
THAT SORT OF LIKE JOYSTICK FLAT TOUCH THING YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA 'CAUSE IT'S COOL
IT'S IT'S FUNNY LIKE YOU F LIKE I JUST I DON'T HAVE AN IPOD BUT LIKE I YOU KNOW
I JUST LIKE STARTED MESSING AROUND WITH ONE OF MY FRIEND'S THE OTHER DAY
AND YOU JUST SORT OF AND IT'S FUNNY HOW YOU PICK IT UP AND YOU JUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT QUITE EASILY
LIKE IT'S NOT THAT HARD YOU KNOW
YEAH AND IT IS YEAH
IT IS REALLY BUT DO YOU NEED A SCREEN THEN DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SCREEN THEN
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY SO WE HAVE THIS LIKE SCROLLING SORT OF BUTTON
LIKE A DISC
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S LIKE IT'S JUST LIKE THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AS A MOUSE PAD
YEAH
YEAH AND THEN
OKAY
SO LIKE IT'S LIKE A LITTLE PART OF THE CIRCLE THAT
OR IT OH SO IT'S JUST A REGION OF THE CIRCLE THAT YOU CAN
ZAP
OKAY
YEAH
SO VOLUME COULD BE LIKE THE TOP IT AND THE BOTTOM SO DO YOU NEED TO OKAY
WELL Y YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO LIKE BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE FUNCTION OF IT TO LIKE
I MEAN LIKE OKAY 'CAUSE SO
I DUNNO I GUESS OKAY SO WHEN YOU G SCROLL YOUR THUMB LIKE AROUND IT IT'LL S LIKE SAY YOU'RE GO YOU'RE GOING CLOCKWISE
THAT THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA GO UP THE CHANNELS AND THEN YOU SCROLL THE OTHER WAY AND IT'LL GO DOWN
BUT THEN SO IF YOU WANNA SWITCH TO THE TO U DO YOU HAVE TO SWITCH TO A FUNCTION WHERE
LIKE Y SO YOU'RE EITHER IN THAT MODE OR YOU'RE IN THE MODE WHERE LIKE IT JUST HAS LIKE THE FOUR LIKE YOU KNOW THIS IS CHANNEL THAT WAY
THAT'S THAT WAY AND VOLUME IS UP AND DOWN
IT JUST
IT JUST KNO THE IPOD KNOWS
S
YEAH
SO YOU JUST YOU JUST CAN EITHER DO THIS OR LIKE YOU CAN JUST TOUCH IT IF YOU WANT
OKAY
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
OKAY
OKAY SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE PRESS THIS MIDDLE REGION AND THEN YOU CAN SCROLL UP GO UP AND DOWN
IT'S LIKE A B
LIKE
I THINK WE CAN GO ON THE FACT THAT IT DOES JUST WORK WITH THE IPOD
BUT THE ONLY THING IS LIKE IPODS ARE SO EXPENSIVE LIKE IT HAS TO BE IS THAT PART OF YEAH I DUNNO I DUNNO
YOU DON'T THINK SO
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
I'M THINKING WE COULD IF IF WE'RE HAV SO BA I MEAN BUT AN IPOD JUST HAS THAT CIRCLE THING YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
WELL LIKE SINCE IT JUST HAS THE CIRCLE THING YOU COULD MAKE IT A QUI A KIND OF COOL SHAPE
LIKE IT COULD BE A COOL SORT OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT COULD BE CIRCULAR YOU KNOW OR SOMETHING WEIRD LIKE THAT JUST
YEAH
YEAH
SO OKAY
THIS IS JUST FOR T. V. IT'S NOT FOR OR IT IS DOES NEED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH
YEAH
SO HOW DO YOU SWITCH
OKAY
SO LIKE IF WE HAD THAT
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
SO I KNOW I'M NOT C REALLY CLEAR ON WHAT
YEAH YEAH
SO YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE LIKE I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE LIKE A FUNCTION SWITCH BUTTON
YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE SO LIKE YOU CAN YOU'RE EITHER ON T. V. YOU'RE ON D. V. D. OR YOU'RE ON V. C. R. OR YOU'RE LIKE
SO
YEAH BUT I MEAN LIKE TO SWITCH THE FUN SO LIKE TO SWITCH THE FUNCTION OF THE LITTLE CIRCLE DISC THE TOUCH PAD
YEAH BUT IT IT WOULD BE
SO BUT I'M SAYING LIKE DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE LIKE SOME KIND OF A BUTTON
SO LIKE YOU'RE IF YOU'RE ON T. V. LIKE YOU CAN SWITCH CHANNELS
BUT THEN IF UH IF YOU'RE ON D. V. D. THEN LIKE THE CHANNEL BU LIKE THE THE REGION OF THE DISC THAT WAS FOR CHANNELS IS FOR LIKE SWITCHING TO DIFFERENT TRACKS OR S YOU KNOW
TO DIFFERENT I MEAN DO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT THAT LIKE
OKAY
AND I CAN START IF YOU WANT
MM
IS THERE AN ORDER
NO
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED ON AN ORDER
FIRST
OKAY
UM HOW DO I PUT THIS I'LL JUST PUT THE CABLE IN
IS THAT IT
CAN YOU SEE
OH HERE
OKAY
SO WHAT HAPPENS IT DOESN'T WORK
NO
IS IT IN THE RIGHT THING
OH WAIT UM
UH
YOU NEED TO HELP ME
YEAH
OH WAIT
THAT'S IS THAT IT
RIGHT HERE WE ARE
WE'RE HERE
OKAY UM
IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS WERE TO BE FOUND UM
A HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE TESTED IN A USABILITY LABORATORY THROUGH JUST THEIR HABITS TO N KNOW THEIR HABITS WERE OBSERVED AND QUESTIONNAIRES WERE GIVEN OUT
UM THE FINDINGS IN IN SOME CASES MATCHED WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
CUSTOME CUSTOMERS AND USERS DON'T LIKE THE WAY REMOTE CONTROLS LOOK THEY DON'T LIKE THE WAY THEY FEEL THEY DON'T THINK THEY MATCH THEIR OPERATING BEHAVIOUR
AND AN EXAMPLE IS WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE BUTTONS THEY ONLY USE TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTONS
SO LATER ON THERE'S A STUDY OF THE BUTTONS THAT THEY USE MOST AND I THINK WE SHOULD DESIGN ACCORDING TO THESE BUTTONS
EASY TO LOSE AND R. S. I.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT R. S. I. MEANS
UM THE PERSON THAT DID THE QUESTIONNAIRE OBVIOUSLY DID I DON'T HAVE A CLUE
UM ACCORDING TO THE FREQUENCY OF USE AND THE RELEVANCE OF EACH BUTTONS
I HAVE MADE A LIST OF THE BUTTONS THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS ARE THOSE TO DO WITH CHANNEL SELECTION
THEY'RE USED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TIMES PER HOUR
AND UM
YEAH SO AND AND PEOPLE LIKE TO ZAP A LOT APPARENTLY SO THIS IS THE ORDER
CHANNEL SELECTION TELETEXT VOLUME AND POWER
THE OTHER ONES ARE THE SETTINGS AND THEY'RE USED LESS THAN YOU KNOW ZERO POINT EIGHT TO ZERO POINT FIVE TIMES PER HOUR
AND THIS MEANS THAT I THINK WE CAN WE COULD HAVE LIKE A A BUTTON FOR ALL THE SETTINGS AND THEN JUST ONE
AND THEN FROM THERE GO ON TO THE AUDIO ON THE SCREEN EITHER ON THE REMOTE OR ON THE TELEVISION
UM
ABOUT THE SCREEN AND SPEECH RECOGNITION SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE WILLING THAN OTHERS TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR THAT
AND IF WE LOOK AT THE MARKET F PEOPLE FROM WELL FROM FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD YEAR OLDS I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE THIS
UM NINETY ONE TO SEVENTY SIX PERCENT OF PEOPLE IN THAT AGE RANGE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR THIS SORT OF PRODUCT
WHILE PEOPLE THAT ARE ABOVE THIRTY FIVE YEARS OL UM YEARS OLD GO FROM THIRTY FIVE PERCENT TO EIGHT PERCENT
SO PEOPLE THAT ARE SIXTY FIVE FOR EXAMPLE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY PAY FOR THIS SORT OF THING
UM I DON'T I DON'T KNOW UM WHAT THE DECISION TO BE MADE IS
BUT I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DO BUY REMOTES M MORE ARE THOSE LIKE TEENAGERS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AND UM
MOST LIKELY BUT WE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS TOGETHER
AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE MATTER UM
SHALL I WHAT DO I DO
DO I GIVE THIS TO SOMEONE ELSE
FUNCTION F. EIGHT
S
THAT'S ON VIEW
OH
HOW IT LOOKS OR
THE THE BUZZER YOU MEAN YEAH FOR SURE YEAH
WELL THAT'S FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND SCREEN
THAT'S ONLY FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION AND SCREEN
YEAH YEAH YEAH
I MEAN
I JUST PUT THE VALUES IN
BUT UM THE SCREEN IS THE SAME AS WHAT
YEAH I'M HAPPY WITH THAT
COMPLETELY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
SO DO YOU PLUG IT IN THE T. YOU PLUG IT IN T. V. THIS THING
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
JUST THERE
MM
ARE WE UM SHOULD THAT THING BE ON THE THING TO PUT THE YOU S YOU TALKING ABOUT A HOME FOR IT
DO YOU STILL WANT TO BUILD A LITTLE THING NEXT TO THE TELLY OR TO P HANG ON THE WALL OR SHALL WE LEAVE THAT FOR NOW
OKAY
OKAY
FOR THE SO YOU HAVE THAT BUTTON THAT SO THERE'S IS THERE A LIGHT OR SHALL WE LEAVE JUST HAVE A RADIO
ARE WE JUST HAVING A RADIO
ON THE PHONE
YOU DON'T NEED A LIGHT
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YOU CAN HEAR IT'S UNDER THE COUCH YEAH
UM
SO NEED THE OTHER BUTTONS
SO WE HAVE THIS MM
MM-HMM
THEY'RE NOT NO
IT NOT V. H. S. HERE
BUT V. C. R. S
YEAH
YEAH FOR SURE
WELL FOR SURE WE NEED THE UM I THINK WE CAN JUST DESIGN THE
CHANNELS
I MEAN POWER'S JUST A BUTTON AND IT'S NOT USED THAT MUCH
S AND IT'S USUALLY THAT RED AND I THINK IT'S QUITE NICE TO KEEP IT LIKE RED
OH OKAY YEAH
YEAH
WELL EVEN UM IPOD THING LIKE UM I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER
OF BUTTONS INSTEAD OF HAVING LIKE ONE TO NINE HAVE A SORT OF
SCROLLING I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
BECAUSE PEOPLE LI SEEM NOW THE IPOD'S OUT PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE THIS THING THAT THERE'S NO
KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
YEAH YEAH IT'S JUST AND IT'S ONE THING WHICH HAS EVERYTHING
WELL CAN'T IT TELL THE LIKE CAN'T YOU IF YOU YOU CAN HAVE THE NUMBER ON THE TELLY GOING LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE ONCE YOU SCROLL AND THEN
IT'S LIKE L THIS LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU DO THAT
AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE UM IF YOU ACTUALLY JUST WANT TO ZAP YOU CAN HAVE LIKE A THING
LIKE THAT AND THAT AND THEN IT CAN JUST BE PLUS AND MINUS
YEAH YOU CAN
YEAH CLICK O ACTUALLY CLICK ON TO HAVE
YEAH
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE FUNCTION
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT IT KNOWS FOR SOME REASON
THE IPOD KNOWS
WELL FOR THE VOLUME YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE MIDDLE AND THEN GO UP
AND THEN WELL IF YOU DO THAT IT GOES
BUT IF YOU LIKE THAT MAKES MORE SENSE 'CAUSE THERE'S ALREADY ONES WITH UP AND DOWN HERE THAT I'VE SEEN
WELL WHAT YOU FOR THE IPOD YOU PRESS AN W RIGHT IF YOU'RE ON THE CHANNEL LET'S SAY
THEN YOU PRESS ON THE MIDDLE AND THEN IF YOU DO THAT AGAIN THE VOLUME GOES UP AND IF YOU DO THAT IT GOES DOWN
BUT IF YOU WANNA KEEP IT WITH VOLUME HERE AND HERE I'M PRETTY SURE
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW YOU COULD CLICK AND THEN HAVE IT UP AND DOWN BUT I THINK
YEAH YEAH YEAH
I THINK IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
WELL IT COULD JUST BE SIMPLE INSTEAD OF BEING A L MASS
BECAUSE THE OTHER THING
I DIDN'T TELL YOU ALL MY PRESENTATION IS THAT PEOPLE FIND IT
FIND THAT IT'S A BIG WASTE OF TIME TO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO USE YOUR REMOTE AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT
UM WHAT OTHER BUTTONS WERE THERE
VOLUME OH WE'VE TS JUST SAID THAT
CHANNEL SELECTION
MENU
BUT D. V. D. PLAYERS USUALLY HAVE THEIR OWN REMOTE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT IS ONLY FUN
OKAY
HI EVERYONE HOPE YOU HAD A NICE LUNCH
UM
ALRIGHT WE'RE MOVING ON TO CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
UM I'LL JUST REVIEW WHAT WE DID IN OUR LAST MEETING
UM UNDER MARKETING WE TARGETED OUR AUDIENCE AND
UM YEAH
THAT WAS GENERALLY HOW HELPFUL THAT WAS
UM THEN WE CONSIDERED SOME DESIGN OPTIONS WITH HOW IT SHOULD LOOK UM
WE DISCUSSED AN IPOD LIKE BUTTON SYSTEM WHICH UH WE HAVEN'T CONCLUDED BUT WE'RE
RIGHT UM
SO IF YOU ALL HAVE PRESENTATIONS TO DO WE CAN SEE WHAT WHERE YOU'VE COME FROM OUR LAST TIME
DOES EVERYONE HAVE PRESENTATIONS
OKAY
WOULD ANYBODY LIKE TO GO FIRST
OKAY
AND WHY NOT WOOD
AND WHY NOT WOOD
'S GOOD
HMM
MM
I THINK IT'S THE NEXT IT'S THE BLUE ONE YEAH
YEAH BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA WEAR YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
OH WE S HADN'T DISCUSSED IT LAST TIME
YOU NEED A SCREEN FOR IT
WE'RE UM WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT HAVING D. V. D. THAT WAS ONE OF TH I I WAS SORRY I I MEANT TO UPDATE YOU ON THAT
UM
YEAH
YEAH
YOU'VE YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU HAVE TO
BUT BUT IMAGINE SOMEONE WITH S
BUT I WHAT IF YOU HAVE SATELLITE AND YOU HAVE LIKE TWO HUNDRED CHANNELS
THEN TO GET TO CHANNEL ONE EIGHTY NINE YOU HAVE TO
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
I MEAN WITH THAT MANY OPTIONS YOU'D UH I'D THINK THAT THE SCREEN WOULD BE BETTER BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE THAT MENU OPTION SORT OF
YEAH
YEAH
UH
MM
MM
YEAH
SO THE T. V. IS THE SCREEN THAT YEAH
SO IT WOULD HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF CHANGING
TO
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
UM RIGHT
WHAT IF I MEAN IF YOU'RE THINKING OF THE DESIGN OF IT NOW LIKE THE A YOU KNOW PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES
UM AND YOU JUST HAVE THIS IT'S LIKE JUST A LONG SILVER THING OR WHATEVER WE'RE THINKING
I MEAN ARE YOU YOU GONNA HAVE ANY BUTTONS ON THAT BESIDES POWER AND THIS THING
OR
YEAH
SO CAN WE IMAGINE THAT THIS WOULD BE SMALLER THAN THE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT YOU SHOWED US BEFORE
I MEAN OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I'VE SEEN SOME PEOPLE JUST GOING LIKE THAT WITH THEIR THUMB YEAH
YEAH
BUT WERE THERE BUTTONS ON THERE AS WELL
MM
YEAH
YEAH
WHAT IF UM YOU HAD LIKE A B A COVER THAT WENT OVER BUTTONS THAT YOU DON'T USE VERY MUCH
LIKE YOU SO YOU COULD SLIDE IT UP IF YOU NEEDED TO LIKE CHANGE THE CONTRAST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO THE OPTIONS ARE THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT IN INTERFERING WITH THE DESIGN AND THE PRACTICALITY OF IT
DO DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THOUGH
LIKE UH YEAH JUST SOMETHING
YEAH THAT YOU CAN FLIP OVER YEAH YEAH
YEAH I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S THE THING IS IS IF W I IF WE CAN DO THIS THAT'D PROBABLY BE
YEAH YEAH
SO I GUESS WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THE UM LIKE THE PROGRAMMING HOW THIS HOW THEY ACTUALLY PROGRAMME THESE THINGS AND IF THAT'S YEAH
I MEAN IT WOULD Y WOULD THAT WOULD BE
HUH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH YOU DON'T KNOW THEY MEAN YEAH IT'S LIKE YEAH
MM
AND IT IS TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE IN A WAY SO THAT FITS WITH THE
YEAH
OH GOD
AH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN DEFINITELY THE AREA ROUND IT
YEAH
AN ORANGE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO WHAT IF WHAT THIS IS I'M JUST FORMING THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD OF HOW THIS THING IS LOOKING
IF YOU HAVE LIKE THAT STRESS BALL MATERIAL KIND OF AS WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY HOLDING IN YOUR HAND
SO LIKE WHAT YOU'RE FEELING IS COMFORTABLE AND THEN THERE'S MORE OF A HARD PLASTIC THING WHERE THAT THING IS
AND ON THAT HARD PLASTIC THING YOU CAN CHANGE EITHER THE COLOUR OR THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLE THAT'S ON THERE
IS THAT KIND OF I 'CAUSE I I'M THINKING OF SILVER BECAUSE THOSE ARE OUR COMPANY COLOURS
UM
I MEAN HOW ARE YOU HOW ARE YOU ALL ENVISIONING BY WHAT WE'VE JUST THE FEEDBACK WE'VE JUST GOT ABOUT THE
A BALL
YEAH
THIS IS JUST
OKAY
SAY THAT'S THE S SAY THAT'S THE SQUASHY BIT
SQUASHY
THAT SEE I WAS THINKING THIS S SORRY I WAS THINKING THIS BIT HERE WOULD BE THE COVER AND LIKE THAT'S YOUR ACTUAL THING
AND LIKE THIS YOU COULD HAVE LIKE YOU COULD HAVE LIKE CHERRIES AND THINGS AROUND THERE
UM BUT
I WAS THINKING IF IT WAS LIKE THIS 'CAUSE THE WAY YOU WERE DESCRIBING THE THE IPOD AND THE THI THE ROLL THINGY
IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOUR THUMB IS FARTHER UP SO IF IF YOU COULD SQUISH IT LOWER THEN
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT YEAH
YEAH
MM
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
HMM
WELL THAT'S NOT VERY NEAT BUT
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
IT WAS YEAH SILVER AND YELLOW
IT L IT LOOKS LIKE I DON'T
YEAH
I MEAN THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION WHERE ARE WE GONNA WE WE SHOULD HAVE THE LOGO SOMEWHERE ON IT
YEAH
YEAH TH AND THAT WOULD THAT
MM-HMM
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REST OF MY NOTES MEAN BECAUSE THEY WERE MADE FOR ME
BUT IF SOMEONE COMPONENTS CONCEPT
QUESTION MARK
ENERGY
QUESTION MARK
WAS THAT YOU
OKAY
OH RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH
UM SO WHAT D BUT WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
ENERGY
I MEAN WE'RE GONNA USE BATTERIES RIGHT
AND
I THINK BATTERIES SOUND GOOD
WHAT DOES EVERYONE ELSE THINK
WHAT ABOUT KRYPTONITE
YEAH
WHAT DOES CHIP ON PRINT MEAN
UH-HUH
OKAY
RIGHT
SO CHIP ON PRINT IS JUST MEANS LIKE THAT THEY'RE MASS PRODUCED
OKAY
AND CASE
UH I GUESS THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT YEAH
CASING
YEAH
THINKING OF LIKE SYNTACTIC CASE AND THI UM LET'S SEE
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE NEED TO
TALK ABOUT
OH WHEN WE MOVE ON YOU TWO ARE GOING TO BE PLAYING WITH PLAY DOUGH
UM AND WORKING ON THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE DESIGN AND USER INTERFACE DESIGN
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING PROTU PRODUCT EVALUATION
SO YOU'LL GET MM M MORE INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR PERSONAL COACH
MM
SEE YOU SOON
DOES IT MATTER THAT I END EARLY
HOW HOW EARLY IS IT
I DIDN'T GET A POP UP THING THAT SAID
HMM
YES
SURE
SO I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE COMPONENTS DESIGN
UM
MOSTLY BY CONSULTING REMOTE CONTROL DIAGRAMS FROM THE INTERNET AND ALSO BY INCORPORATING DESIGN IDEAS FROM THE LAST PROJECT MEETING
UM SO WE NEED SOME CUSTOM DESIGN PARTS AND OTHER PARTS WE'LL JUST USE STANDARD
UM I ASSUME WE'LL BE CUSTOM DESIGNING OUR CASE PROBABLY A HARD PLASTIC OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL CASE TO PROTECT THE REMOTE AND THE LOCATOR
AND WE'LL NEED TO CUSTOM DESI DESIGN A CIRCUIT BOARD
BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT BOARD HAS TO TAKE THE BUTTON INPUT AND SEND IT TO THE OUTPUT SO YOU HAVE TO DESIGN THAT EACH TIME
BUT ONCE WE COME UP WITH A DESIGN WE'LL SEND IT TO THE CIRCUIT PEOPLE AND THEY'LL JUST PRINT IT OUT
UM STANDARD PARTS INCLUDE THE BUTTONS AND THE WHEELS UM THE IPOD STYLE WHEEL
THE INFRARED L. E. D. IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE INCLUDED IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT COMES WITH IT
UM WE NEED A RADIO SENDER AND RECEIVER THOSE ARE STANDARD
AND AL WE ALSO NEED A BEEPER OR BUZZER OR OTHER SORT OF NOISE THING FOR LOCATING THE REMOTE
SO WE HAVE SOME MATERIAL OPTIONS
UM WE CAN USE RUBBER PLASTIC WOOD OR TITANIUM
UM I'D RECOMMEND AGAINST TITANIUM BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY BE USED IN THE FLAT CASES AND IT'S REALLY HEAVY
UM AND THE RUBBER CASE REQUIRES RUBBER BUTTONS SO IF WE DEFINITELY WANT PLASTIC BUTTONS WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A RUBBER CASE
AND HMM
UH WELL WE CAN USE WOOD
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'D WANT TO
UM AND ALSO WE SHOULD NOTE THAT IF WE WANT AN IPOD STYLE WHEEL BUTTON IT'S GONNA REQUIRE A M QU SLIGHTLY MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP
WE CAN'T USE THE MINIMAL CHIP WE NEED THE NEXT HIGHER GRADE WHICH IS CALLED REGULAR
I DON'T THINK IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT ON DESIGN
YOU NEED A SCREEN WITH MUSIC BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC SONG LIKE YOU KNOW THAT BAND OR WHATEVER
WITH T. V. CHANNELS IT'S YOU KNOW ONE TWO THREE
SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MY FLATMATES ACTUALLY HAD ONE WITH A WHEEL AND IT IT DID SHOW UP ON THE T. V.
THEY HAVE TO R WHEEL REALLY FAST
BUT I THINK THE WHEEL GOES THROUGH LIKE A HUNDRED CHANNELS AT LEAST ON THEIRS
IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN PEOPLE
YOU HAVE TO GET A AN ADVANCED CHIP IF YOU WANNA HAVE A SCREEN IN
WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE REGULAR CHIP WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE MINIMAL
MM-HMM
YEAH
W WHEN WE HAD THE WHEELY REMOTE CONTROL WE IT WAS ON THE TOP I THINK IF YOU HELD IT LIKE THAT
YEAH WELL IT HAD THE WHEELY THING AND THEN IT HAD THOSE EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT BUTTONS THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO
SO WE JUST USED THE TOP PART
YEAH
YEAH LIKE MAYBE SOMETHING ON THE SIDE WHERE YOU SLIP A PANEL DOWN AND IT'S GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF
YEAH
OH HOW THEY MAKE THE MENU SHOW UP ON THE T. V.
I DON'T KNOW
I BELIEVE IT'S INS IT'S GOTTA BE INSIDE THE T. V. NOT INSIDE THE REMOTE
I'M NOT SURE
WELL THEY USUALLY ARE
WELL
I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT
IT ALWAYS COMES WITH THE T. V.
YEAH IT MOST OF THE ONES WE'VE HAD HAVE HAD THE MENU BUTTON
'CAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU NEED TO HAVE A BUTTON ACCESS TO LIKE CHANGE THE CONTRAST OR SOMETHING
'CAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T COME UP EVERY DAY OR SOMETHING
MM-HMM
YEAH
OR ON THE T. V. TOO
OH I WAS GONNA SAY
YOU SAID UH PEOPLE WANT SPONGY
UM ONE OF YOUR ONE OF THE MATERIAL OPTIONS IS A SORT OF RUBBER THAT'S IN LIKE THOSE STRESS BALL THINGS
SO THAT WOULD BE SPONGY
YEAH I THINK IT COULD WORK
DON'T THINK I'D WANT IT TO FEEL LIKE A BANANA
YOU COULD DO LIKE THE COMPUTERS WHERE THEY HAVE LIKE THE GRAPEFRUIT APPLE MACHINE AND THEY HAVE LIKE THE BLUEBERRY LIKE ALL THE COLOURS ARE NAMED AFTER FRUITS
OH
MM
I WAS THINKING SORT OF A SINGLE BALL SHAPE
SO YOU'RE HOLDING A SQUISHY BALL AND THEN IT HAS A
MM-HMM
YEAH I GUESS SO
YEAH YOU COULD SQUISH IT
I GUESS THEY WOULD BE EITHER IN THE COLOUR OF THAT PLASTIC FACE ON THE FRONT OR IN THE COLOUR OF THE SQUISHY THING UNDERNEATH
I THINK THE BATTERIES WOULD HAVE TO GO RIGHT UNDER THE PLASTIC CASE
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SWITCHING OUT THE SQUISHY PART
THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE THE OTHER PART JUST BE SORT OF A SINGLE UNIT THAT YOU CAN SNAP OFF
WELL I DUNNO
YOU'D SPEND SO MUCH TIME LIKE SQUISHING IT TO YOUR OWN PERSONAL HAND
THEN YOU'D GET A NEW ONE AND YOU'D HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN
THAT WAS ME
YES
UH WE ACTUALLY HAD AN OPTION OF BATTERIES SOLAR POWER AND UM A DYNAMO WHICH IS SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH TORCHES
OH OKAY
YEAH THE OTHER ONE WAS THE OTHER ONE WAS A KINETIC THING WHERE YOU'D BASICALLY HAVE TO WIND IT YOURSELF
SO I SORT OF PICKED BATTERY
WE COULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT DOING A WIND UP OR A DYNAMO OR A SOLAR POWER
UM BUT I THINK SOLAR POWER'S NOT AVAILABLE WITH THE RUBBER CASE ANYWAYS
IT IT SEEMS A LITTLE WEIRD FOR A LIVING ROOM ANYWAYS
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO ACTUALLY
ALL IT SAID WAS IT GAVE SORT OF RELATIVE SOME CHIPS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHERS SORT OF THINGS
IT DIDN'T GIVE ME ANY ACTUAL COST
MOST OF THE STUFF IS PRETTY CHEAP THOUGH BOUGHT IN BULK
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM
LIKE THE CHIP IS PROBABLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART
UM FOR THINGS LIKE REMOTE CONTROLS UM THEY STAMP OUT A CHIP CALCULATORS TOO I THINK
UM SO YOU CAN MASS PRODUCE 'EM PRETTY CHEAP
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE A COMPUTER YOU CAN'T LIKE REPROGRAMME YOUR REMO REMOTE CONTROLS IT'S LIKE STAMPED ONTO THE CHIP
YEAH
CASE IS WHAT WE WERE DISCUSSING YEAH
'SCUSE ME
YES
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO
OH UH THERE WE GO
UH
OKAY
UM
WELL SO THAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THING HUH
I ACTUALLY WASN'T AWARE OF THE NEW TRENDS IN ELECTRONICS AND AND UH
SO SO OKAY LET ME GET THIS RIGHT
OKAY UH
OKAY ALRIGHT ANYWAY
UM HERE WE GO
CONCEPTUAL USER INTERFACE
TRYING WE'RE GONNA TRY TO TALK ABOUT UM WHAT KIND OF UH HOW PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE USING THIS IPOD ISH REMOTE CONTROL
BASED ON FRUIT VEGETABLE DESIGN
AND UM BASICALLY SO THIS IS A TOUCHED BA A TOUCH BASED GRAPHICAL INTERFACE SYSTEM
UH SO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THIS LITTLE SCREEN
UM KIND OF I MEAN I ASSUME ARE WE STILL ON THE SCREEN IDEA
'CAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HA IF WE HAVE THIS IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IN ORDER TO HAVE SOMEONE GOING AROUND AND USING THE UM THE WHEEL
YOU IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WOULD NEED A SCREEN
BUT LIKE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT YEAH BUT IF SO IS IT JUST OKAY
SO B YOU YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SWITCH TO LIKE D. V. D. AND LIKE OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT AREN'T YOU
ARE WE
OKAY
ALRIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO ANYWAY IF WELL WE JUST WE NEED TO OKAY SO IF WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A SCREEN I THINK I WAS THINKING OKAY
SO BASICALLY IT'S JUST GONNA BE A WHEEL THEN
AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A RIGHT
YEAH LIKE YOU'RE G YEAH LIKE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH TO LIKE A MODE WHERE YOU CAN OKAY WE'RE NOT CHOOSING THAT I GUESS
BUT LIKE CHOOSE CHANNEL CONTROL LIKE IF YOU WA BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE LIKE
UM YOU KNOW CHANNELS ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
SO THAT PEOPLE SEEMS TO BE WELL
YOU KNOW
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SCROLL TO GET CHANNELS
SO UM I GUESS THAT'S WH WHY I WAS THINKING YOU MAY NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A SCREEN BECAUSE
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GO AROU GO BACK AND FORTH AND CHOOSE IF OR OR THEN AGAIN IF YOU JUST I GUESS I C I CAN SEE LIKE SOME KIND OF A THING WHERE LIKE YOU SORT OF HAVE LIKE THE NUMBER COME UP ON THE T. V. LIKE WHAT CHANNEL YOU'RE ON
YOU CAN JUST SCROLL AND YOU CAN JUST GET TO LIKE FIVE OR LIKE TWELVE OR
I OH YEAH
'CAUSE YOU'LL HAVE TO LIKE BUT YOU CAN QUICKLY S YOU CAN
YEAH
YEAH IF YOU DO IT W SO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE YOU I MEAN SO YOU BASICALLY JUST KINDA NEED TO FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT KIND OF
YOU KNOW RANGE WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE WHEEL AND UM
SO YOU'RE EITHER YOU'RE YOU KNOW TH YOU'RE EITHER DOING THIS MOTION TO LIKE CONTROL THE CHANNELS OR LIKE ONCE ONCE YOU STOP THAT
YOU KNOW YOU CAN LIKE TAP FOR UM DIFFERENT
UH WHATCHAMACALLITS DIFFERENT UM YOU KNOW FUNCTIONS LIKE VOLUME OR LIKE YOU CAN TAP JUST TO GET TO DIFFERENT CHANNELS
LIKE IF YOU JUST WANTED TO GO TO LIKE FROM FIVE TO SIX YOU COULD TAP OR SOMETH
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE CONCERN ABOUT YOU KNOW UM HOW DO YOU GET TO THE MENU IF YOU WANNA CHANGE THE BRIGHTNESS OF YOUR TELEVISION
OR IF YOU WANT TO UM YOU KNOW SWITCH AROUND I DON'T KNOW
LIKE THESE DIFFERENT MODES LIKE TURN ON THE TIMER OR LIKE SOMETHING SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE
I WOULD THINK SO TOO LIKE
SO I MEAN AND IT SEEMS IT W IT DOES SEEM A LITTLE SILLY TO HAVE THIS SCREEN IF YOU HARDLY ARE EVER USING IT
YOU KNOW BECAUSE BUT THEN AGAIN IT WOULD IT DOES MAKE KIND OF IF THE SCREEN'S SORT OF JUST LIKE AN OPTION THAT
LIKE IS JUST THERE AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY USING IT THAT'S KIND OF M YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THE ONLY THING THOUGH
YEAH
SO THEN BASICALLY IT HAS TO HAVE SOME WAY TO GET TO GET TO A MODE ON THE TELEVISION WHERE YOU'RE DOING UM
YOU CAN GET TO YOU KNOW YOU CAN
LIKE MAYBE IT'LL BE THAT CENTRAL BUTTON THAT LIKE
THEN YOU HIT THAT AND THEN YOU CAN IT BRINGS UP LIKE THE MENU ON THE T. V. AND YOU CAN JUST SCROLL AROUND
LIKE TO DO THE TIMER TO DO THE YEAH YEAH
YEAH
BUT THE REMOTE ITSELF ISN'T REALLY CLUTTERED UP
HMM
YEAH WELL WE DON'T WANT THE SCREEN I GUESS BUT UM 'CAUSE THAT JUST IT DOES SEEM LIKE IT THAT WOULD BE LIKE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE
BUT I DUNNO AND THEN SO IT JUST IM REALLY ALL YOU NEED IS LIKE THIS LITTLE WHEEL THEN AND YOU CAN CONTROL EVERYTHING
SO
YEAH
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT YOU WOULD NEED ANYTHING BESIDES POW I MEAN AND THE POWER BUTTON COULD EVEN BE LIKE HOLD DOWN THE MENU BUTTON FOR LIKE LONGER THAN ONE SECOND AND IT TURNS ON THE T. V.
YEAH
YEAH DEFINITELY
LIKE I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE LIKE
LIKE EVEN MAYBE LIKE A CIR I'M F I'M SEEING ALMOST LIKE A CIRCULAR SORT OF LIKE HANDHELD LIKE THING
I MEAN IT IT NEEDS TO BE EASY TO SOMEHOW IT NEEDS TO BE EASY TO LIKE MANIPULATE AND USE YOUR
I MEAN HOW DO HOW DO I'M NOT REALLY
LIKE WHEN I USE AN IPOD I END UP JUST KIND OF USING MY INDEX FINGER TO LIKE CONTROL IT
SO
YEAH
OR YOUR THUMB OR SOMETHING
SO
YEAH
YEAH SO
MM YEAH
YEAH SO BUT I MEAN I THINK IT COULD BE PRETTY SMALL
LIKE I D I MEAN YOU YOU WANT IT TO BE LARGE ENOUGH THAT
YOU CAN
BUT CAN'T YOU JUST GET
YEAH BUT I MEAN DO YOU NEED THAT
IF IF YOU CAN GET TO YOU KNOW IF SO LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO BRING UP THE MENU ON THE T. V. SCREEN
THAT KEEPS IT
REALLY
YEAH
UH YOU WOULDN'T I DON'T I JUST DON'T THINK YOU WOULD EVEN NEED IT
SO
MEAN
I MEAN YOU CAN DO IT YOU IT'S IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT HARD
I MEAN I'VE NEVER BOUGHT A REMOTE
IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS REMOTE'S GOING TO BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY FROM THE TELEVISION WHICH IS A LITTLE
MY I'VE NEVER BOUGHT JUST A REMOTE LIKE SO I DON'T I DON'T REALLY KNOW
BUT UM
SO UM BUT I MEAN IT'S I'VE NEVER HAD A HARD TIME WITH LIKE MY REMOTES
LIKE BRINGING UP THE MENU SCREEN IF YOU NEED TO LIKE CHANGE THE DATE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW
AND I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD UH THAT SHOULD BE TOO HARD
YEAH
YEAH
WELL SO
SO DO WE NEED I DUNNO
WELL I GUESS WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT BUT I MEAN YOU JUST BASICALLY NEED THE OUTPUT SIGNAL YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO BRING IT UP
THAT'S WHAT IT DOES ANYWAY
YEAH
YEAH
SO BUT OH YOU MEAN IF WE HAVE THIS SCREEN LIKE THE IPOD SCREEN
ON THE TELLY OKAY YEAH
SO YEAH I THINK I MEAN
I THINK I THINK THE TOUCH BASED GRAPHICAL INTERFACE IS A REALLY UH COOL IDEA BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT IS SO OBNOXIOUS TO LIKE HAVE TO PUSH THOSE LIKE OKAY NOW I HIT THIS YOU KNOW
YOU HAVE YOUR LITTLE GUIDE OUT AND YOU'RE LIKE HIT THIS BUTTON TWICE LIKE TO ACTIVATE THE DATE
YEAH
I GUESS
AND IT IS TRENDY THE IPODS ARE REALLY HOT RIGHT NOW SO
UM YEAH BY WEB RESEARCH YEAH SO
OH
YEAH
OH OKAY THAT WOULD BE COOL
MM
YEAH C THAT'S E THAT WOULD BE KIND OF OH YOU KNOW
USUALLY LIKE THE TOUCH PAD THINGS ARE KIND OF A HARD PLASTIC TYP MOUSE TYPE YOU KNOW THING
BUT WHAT IF WE HA WHAT IF WE HAD LIKE A SPONGY SORT OF LIKE STRESS BALLEY KINDA SO YOU'RE LIKE
OR WHAT IF WE INTEGRATED THE THE UH THE F WHAT IF THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WE SOMEHOW MADE IT TACTILELY FASH YOU KNOW
WE C TAPPED INTO THAT SO LIKE IT FEELS LIKE
A VEGETABLE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YOU COULD NAME IT AFTER FRUITS AND VEGETABLES OR
YEAH
SO I THINK YEAH COLOURS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T HAVE SILVER FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
I DO I DUNNO
UM
THAT'S IN THE SHAPE OF A FRUIT LIKE A
YEAH
OH I LIKE THAT SHAPE
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S LIKE IT HAS TO BE S YEAH
YEAH
WHAT IF YEAH WHAT IF THE SQUISHY OH SO SO YOU'RE SAYING THE SQUISHY PART'S LIKE DETACHABLE
AND YOU CAN SO SO MAYBE ONE YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE LIKE THE BROCCOLI SQUISHY THING
AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE LIKE THE BANANA SQUISHY THING AND YOU COULD GET YOU COULD HAVE YOUR CHOICE YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OH
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN I THINK UH AND I THINK THE HANDHE I THINK THE HANDHELD PART IS DEFINITELY
SO YOU COULD MAKE THAT
INTO THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PART
YEAH
SO WHERE ARE THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES NOW
FRUITS AND VEG
YEAH
YEAH
WE COULD PROMOTE THE BANANA ONE
LIKE MM
MM
OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK UM
IT'D BE INTERESTING TO HAVE THE B THE SQUISHY BIT
THE PART THAT YOU YEAH CAN CHANGE INTO THE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW TRENDY VEGETABLES AND FRUITS
BUT UH IT
YEAH
YEAH
THE DYNAMO WOULD BE INTERESTING
OH
HMM
HMM
COOL
BLESS YOU
YEAH
UM CAN I DO NEXT
'CAUSE I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE MATERIAL
WHICH IS QUITE SHOCKING
HA
RIGHT UM I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING THE CURRENT TRENDS UM BOTH ON THE WEB AND VIA FASHION WATCHERS
AND THE FINDINGS ARE THAT THE FIRST THING TO AIM FOR IS A FASHION UH FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
UM
NEXT COMES TECHNOLOGIC TECHNOLOGY AND THE INNOVATIONS TO DO WITH THAT
AND TH LAST THING IS THE
EASY TO USE UM FACTOR
UM FANCY LOOK AND FEEL GOES FAR BEYOND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE THING BUT I SUPPOSE THAT IS INCLUDED IN IN THE EASE OF USE
UM OUR FASHION WATCHERS IN MILAN AND PARIS HAVE DECIDED WELL NOTICED
THAT F THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE THEME IS THE IS THE CURRENT TREND AND AND THEREFORE UM WE NEED TO GO FOR THAT IF WE WANT
YOU KNOW WH WHATEVER OUR MOTTO IS
UM
FOR FASHION WE GO FOR FASHION
THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
SO WE WANT TO PUT THE FASHION ELECTRONICS WE NEED TO GO FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
AND ALSO GO FOR A SPONGY FEEL SO THE THE QUESTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY WHATE IS INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
AS TO THE MATERIAL SHOULD BE LIMITED TO I DON'T KNOW HOW SPONGY IT CAN BE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS TOGETHER
I DON'T KNOW HOW SPONGY CAN BE ACHIEVED BUT APPARENTLY THAT'S THE WAY TO GO
UM
I I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FRUIT AND VEGETABLE THING AND I PREFER FRUITS TO VEGETABLES BUT THAT'S JUST A PERSONAL OPINION
I THINK I THINK PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE A FRUIT INSTEAD OF A VEGETABLES IN THEIR SITTING ROOM
UH THOSE ARE JUST SUGGESTIONS AND ALSO WE NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS SHOULD BE PRINTED
SO THAT STILL HAS TO DO WITH THE MATERIAL DISCUSS SHOULD WE PRINT THE FRUIT STUFF OR SHOULD THE ACTUAL REMOTE LOOK LIKE A FRUIT
UM AND FINALLY AGAIN WITH THE SPONGY
IT HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE SO MAYBE AGAIN OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SHOULD LOOK INTO THAT OR FIND COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT'S BETTER THAN MINE
UM YEAH TO SUMMARISE THESE ARE THE POINTS THAT NEED TO BE
UM TOUCHED IN ORDER TO GET A GOOD DECISION AND HOPEFULLY OUR USER INTERFACE HAS MORE TO SAY ABOUT THE MATTER
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
NEITHER WAS I
WELL IT'S A TREND IN FASHION IN CLOTHING AND UM FABRICS
BUT THE SCREEN CAN COME UP ON THE TELLY THE SHE SAID
THAT CORRECT
GRAPHICAL INTERFACE
UH ON THE YOU CAN HAVE IT ON THE TELLY THOUGH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
LOOK IT EVEN HAS SETTINGS
ON THE YOU CAN JUST TAKE THEIRS AND JUST
YEAH BUT SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE
YEAH I USE IT LIKE THAT
YEAH
UH
WELL YOU CAN HAVE IT ON THE SETTINGS NO
THEY ALREADY DO IT
NO
BUT ALSO IF YOU HAVE IT ON THE SCREEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY WRITE EVERYTHING OUT BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WITH BUTTONS IS YOU LIKE
THEY HAVE THESE SORT OF ABBREVIATIONS AND CODES THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND AND I NEVER GET IT
NEVER EVER
SO
WELL ON THE TELLY
MM
DID YOU DID YOU GET THAT PC PICTURE ON DID THEY PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT PICTURE ON THE WEB
THAT'S QUITE INTERESTING
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS VEGETABLE THING THAT I'M DREADING
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
JUST NICE FEEL BUT I HATE SPONGY
WELL IT COULD BE LIKE MOBILES THAT JUST YOU JUST PUT A COVER
IF IT'S A SMALL THING YOU C INSTEAD OF CREATING AN OBJECT FOR IT THAT LOOKS LIKE A BANANA
WHICH FRANKLY I'M NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF UM YOU COULD JUST HAVE COVERS AND THEN YOUR MOBILE F IT'S LIKE A MOBILE PHONE THING
YOU KNOW YOU HAD THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THEY HAD ALL THESE DIFFERENT COVERS FOR MOBILES
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
AND IT COULD THE COLOUR CAN FIT YOUR SITTING ROOM SO IF YOU HAVE RED SITTING ROOM YOU CAN HAVE STRAWBERRY
AND THEN IF YOU HAVE A GREEN ONE YOU CAN HAVE WELL I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
MAYBE A BALL
KNOW A SQUASHY BALL
A RELAXING SQUASHY BALL
THAT YOU CAN P WELL I SEE YOU'RE THINKING IT'S WEIRD
YOU'RE THINKING THE OPPOSITE OF ME 'CAUSE YOU'RE THINKING YOU CHANGE THE THE HARD BIT AND I'M THINKING HOW DO YOU CHANGE THE HARD WOULD YOU PUT A UM
STICKER SORT OF
BECAUSE I WAS THINKING IF YOU HAVE A COVER FOR THE SQUASHY BIT LIKE A
OH OKAY YEAH
YEAH I WAS THINKING OF GETTING A COVER FOR
WHICH IS CHEAPER
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S CHEAPER ACTUALLY
YEAH
SO IT WOULDN'T BE VERY BIG IN EITHER LIKE HOW BIG
THIS BIG AND THEN YOU JUST DO THAT I SUPPOSE
WELL JUST A LI I CAN'T DES LIKE CONDOM THINGY LIKE A A COVER
BUT WELL THE QUESTION IS WHICH ONE'S EASIEST TO CHANGE AND WE CAN JUST CONTACT OUR RELEVANT DEPARTMENT FOR THAT
AND JUST SEE WHAT THE COST IS FOR COVERING THAT OR COVERING THAT
AND FOR NOW WE CAN DO TWO PROTOTYPES MAYBE AND THEN HI TRY AND ASK USERS WHAT THE BEST IS AND
NO
UM
THAT'S NICER
I THINK IT'S NICER TO HAVE A DRAWING 'CAUSE IT'S NEATER
UM
IF IT'S A BIT LIKE THOSE JUGGLING BALLS YOU CAN CHANGE SHAPE ACCORDING TO YOUR
TO THE WAY YOU HOLD IT
IF IT'S GOT SAND IN IT MAYBE OR SOMETHING YOU IT IT JUST MOULDS TO YOUR HAND
WE WE DON'T KNOW
YEAH
AND THE REST IS THE COMPANY THE COMPANY COLOUR'S SILVER
OKAY
MM-HMM
SHOULD ALSO FIT THE BATTERIES WHICH WE HAVEN'T
OKAY
MM-HMM
NO BUT IT DOES IT AUTOMATICALLY
DOES IT AUTOMATICALLY
I DON'T KNOW
OKAY
OH A DYNAMO IS AH IT'S A BICYCLE
IT'S A BICYCLE MECHANISM
IT'S THE EN IT'S LIKE IF IF SOMETHING MOVES WHEN IT MOVES IT STORES ENERGY
IT'S QUITE SWEET
NO
BUT DYNAMO THE THE FACT WITH DYNAMO IS THE MOMENT YOU MOVE IT IT C IT CREATES ENERGY ON ITS OWN
WHICH IS QUITE COOL
SO IF YOU THROW IT IT'S GONNA STORE LOADS OF ENERGY AND YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY A BATTERY 'CAUSE THEY'RE QUITE F I FIND THEM ANNOYING
BUT WE NEED TO FIND COST
DON'T KNOW THE COST
DOES ANYONE HAVE COSTS ON THE ON THE WEB
OKAY
RIGHT
MM
OH THANK YOU
I IT'S STRANGE BECAUSE
'KAY
HMM
OKAY EVERYBODY
WELCOME TO THE DETAILED DESIGN MEETING
UM
LET'S SEE
OUR AGENDA
LAST TIME WE DISCUSSED THE SQUISHY FRUITINESS OF OUR REMOTE CONTROLS AND HOW WE MIGHT PURSUE THAT
UM AND I THINK LOOKS LIKE WE'VE COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS
UM AND WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT MATERIALS WE'D USE AND WHAT KIND OF CHIP WOULD BE NECESSARY
UM SO FOR LATER IN THE MEETING I'VE DONE A A SPREADSHEET OF PRODUCTION COSTS SO WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT
UM AND SEE IF IT'S CHANGED AT ALL FROM WHEN WE LAST DISCUSSED IT
UM SO ACTUALLY I THINK
YEAH UM F YOU GUYS WANNA GIVE A PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION OF
OH IS THAT BROCCOLI
'S A VERY BRIGHT STRAWBERRY
OH YEAH
YEAH
OH
UM IF YOU WANNA LOOK IN YOUR PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER THERE'S AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET
UM THE ONLY ONE THAT'S IN THERE PRODUCTION COSTS
AND IF YOU OPEN IT UP
UM I'VE JUST STUCK THE NUMBERS IN IT WAS A REAL CHALLENGE THERE
BUT IF I MISSED ANYTHING THAT WE'VE GONE OVER OR IF YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT HAS CHANGED I MEAN WE DECIDED ON BATTERIES
AND THE REGULAR CHIP WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THE MORE ADVANCED IPOD LIKE BUTTON
UM
I SAID UNCURVED OR FLAT
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE THERE IS THAT RIGHT
FOR THE FOR THE PLASTIC PART WOULD BE
OH
OKAY
RIGHT
WELL YEAH
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE AREA JUST OH I D
I DUNNO
I GUESS WE'D HAVE TO CONTACT THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THEM AND SEE
UM SO WHAT ELSE
THERE'S PLASTIC FOR THAT AREA AROUND THE BUTTON
UM AND THEN RUBBER WOULD BE THE SQUISHY LIKE THING RIGHT
UM AND LOTS OF SPECIAL COLOURS ACTUALLY
UH SCROLL WHEEL
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT I'VE MISSED
OKAY SO THAT WOULD MAKE OUR TOTAL OF ELEVEN POINT NINE
WHICH IS EVEN LESS THAN TWELVE POINT FIVE WHICH MEANS WE'D BE MAKING EVEN MORE OF A PROFIT
AND IF WE SOLD A LOT OF SQUISHY THINGS
BOO YEAH
OKAY
S
SO
MM
DID Y WHAT DID YOU WORK ON
THE
OKAY
DO YOU WANNA
OKAY
I THINK THAT'S
HUH THE POWERPOINT ONE
YEAH
UM WE CAN DO IT SEPARATELY AND THEN DISCUSS IT IF IF THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANNA DO
WAIT ONE IS TRUE AND SO THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE'RE ANSWERING
AND ONE IS
ONE RIGHT OKAY
IF IT'S SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN YOU PUT FOUR
OKAY
ARE WE JUST ABOUT READY
I DON'T THINK SO
IT'S YEAH THE THE MARKER THING KINDA STOPPED WORKING LAST TIME WE
OUR ANIMALS WILL FOREVER BE THERE
UN UNLESS YOU FEEL YOU NEED IT T TO OKAY OKAY
WE'LL
FIVE
I I THINK WE SHOULD
YEAH
YEAH
SIX
I WASN'T CHEATING I SWEAR
UH
OH I THOUGHT IT WAS THE OTHER WAY ROUND
SO WE DO HAVE ABOUT THE SAME THING WE JUST HAVE IT THE OTHER WAY
OH GOSH
OKAY
WELL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THREE
TWO
ONE
TWO
TWO POINT I THINK I MISSED TWO
WAIT IS THAT TWO POINT ONE
ONE POINT FOUR ONE POINT FIVE
OKAY RIGHT THAT'S I HAVE TWO OF THEM
ONE
YEAH
YEAH
THREE
THREE
TWO
FIVE
FOUR
TWO
OKAY
UM
NO NO THAT'S UM I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE ONES THAT LIKE WHERE S WHERE PEOPLE SAID FOUR
WHERE UM IT LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT WANNA DISCUSS CHANGING AN ASPECT OF THE REMOTE
THE THAT WAS MATERIAL
MM
UM
MM-HMM
DOES THE SHAPE
SEE I'M HAVING I'M HAVING TROUBLE IMAGINING
THE IS IT UH GONNA BE THE SIZE LIKE THE THE CONTROLLER
IT OR BIGGER
BECAUSE
YEAH
NO BUT I IMAGINE EVEN IF IT WAS BIGGER
LIKE IF IT'S ROUND AND IT'S BIG THEN YOU YOU CAN'T GET THAT'S WHY REMOTE CONTROLS ARE LONG BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT THUMB KIND OF SO C THEY COULD ALL BE BANANAS AND CUCUMBERS
UM BUT I DON'T S I I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS COMFORTABLE TO TO SIT THERE LIKE IT'S AN AWKWARD POSITION
YEAH
AND WOULD IT EVEN RESEMBLE FRUIT THAT WAY
I MEAN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT I I WHEN YOU WERE HOLDING THAT BEFORE IT ACTUALLY LOOKED YEAH
YEAH
WHAT IF UM THE IT WAS JUST PATTERNS ON LIKE WE WE CHOSE THE SHAPE OR THE SH SHAPE COULD BE WHATEVER WE WANTED AND THEN IT WOULD JUST BE LIKE A DESIGN ON THE RUBBER
YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE JUST A PRINTED YEAH OR COLOURED YEAH
OR I MEAN WE COULD EVEN HAVE FRUIT LIKE AROUND I MEAN
BUT IF WE IF WE NEED YEAH
AND IF WE WANNA INCORPORATE THE FRUIT THING SOMEHOW
THERE MIGHT BE I MEAN IF IT IF IT IN IF IT UH CONFLICTS WITH THE COMFORT OF ACTUALLY HOLDI HOLDING THE
MM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL SEE TH THE REASON THE BROCCOLI WORKS IS YOU CAN KINDA HOLD IT LIKE THAT WHICH IS A NICE KIND OF YEAH
BUT
I MEAN IS THERE SOME WAY WE COULD MAKE IT THIS KIND OF SHAPE
'CAUSE LIKE KIND OF
YEAH YEAH
OR LIKE EVEN
OR EVEN LIKE
YEAH LIKE YOU SAID LIKE A JOYSTICK LIKE THAT
YOU KNOW
'CAUSE THAT I THINK
I MEAN THAT FITS THE WHOLE ROUND IPOD IDEA
AND YOU STILL HAVE THE COMFORT OF HOLDING IT LIKE THAT
AND YOU COULD LIKE IF IT'S LIKE THIS YOU COULD PUT FRUIT DESIGNS AND STUFF ON THAT PART
BUT I MEAN IT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS ABOUT THAT
THE BATTERIES ARE GOING IN THE BACK
THE REASON I I GA I DIDN'T GIVE IT A ONE I THINK I GAVE IT A THREE BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE TO LIKE UNC CLIP NO YOU COULD
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER ONE
OKAY
YEAH
RIGHT
OKAY
MM
OKAY
YEAH
AND IT WOULD PROBABLY COST MORE TO PRODUCE 'CAUSE THEY'RE IRREGULAR
YEAH
WHICH IS WHY PRINTING MIGHT BE LIKE JUST PRINTING THE FRUIT ON FRUIT
MM
NOT REALLY
WELL WE'VE DONE FINANCE EVALUATION CRITERIA PRODUCTION EVALUATION
UM SO PROJECT EVALUATION
I GUESS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS UM THE PROD THE PROCESS OF THE PROJECT AND HOW SATISFIED OH OH IT'S ALRIGHT
UH
YEAH
UM
DID YOU FEEL THERE WAS A LOT OF ROOM FOR CREATIVITY IN THE SORT OF
YEAH
I MEAN FRUIT AND SQUISHINESS
HOW C MORE CREATIVE CAN YOU GET
AND HOW WAS OUR LEADERSHIP AND TEAMWORK
WELL I THOUGHT MY LEADERSHIP WAS CRAP PERSONALLY
EXCUSE ME AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THAT
YEAH
UM
YEAH WELL I'M NEVER GONNA DO A MANAGEMENT POSITION I KNOW THAT NOW
UM YEAH I THOUGHT WE ALL WORKED VERY WELL TOGETHER
YEAH
YEAH
VERY DEMOCRATIC
NO SPATS THAT WAS GOOD
UM AND THE MEANS FOR LIKE THE MATERIALS WE USED HOW CONVENIENT WERE THEY
LIKE THE THE PENS THE WHITEBOARD I MEAN WE USED
ARE YOU A MAC PERSON
HUH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
I CAN'T SAY I FOUND EVERYTHING PARTICULARLY HELPFUL
LIKE I
IT
REALLY
I MEAN M MY PROBLEM YEAH YEAH
'CAUSE MY PROBLEM WAS YOU GUYS HAD ACCESS TO LIKE THEY'D PUT SEND YOU TO SITES AND STUFF RIGHT
SEE I COULDN'T DO THAT SO I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS WERE DOING
AND WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IT I WAS JUST LIKE YOU KNOW THAT'S WH THAT'S WHY I SEEMED SO IGNORANT WHEN WHEN YOU WERE J EXPLAINING THINGS
'CAUSE I
YEAH
YEAH
SYSTEM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH HUH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I MEAN WE REALLY GOT INTO TALKING ABOUT LIKE PERSONAL PRACTICALIT LIKE IT WASN'T NECESSARILY WHAT WAS LIKE WE WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF FRUIT OR SPONGINESS YOU KNOW
SO IT'S
OH RIGHT
GIVEN CERTAIN INFORMATION OR
JUST YEAH
MM MM
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK OF THE PENS
IT ASKS ABOUT THAT
MM
YEAH AND I I'VE F FORGOTTEN ONCE OR TWICE TO CHECK THE BOX
MM
AND NEW IDEAS FOUND
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SEEMS KIND OF LIKE AN EXCESSIVE REITERATION
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL DOES ANYONE WANNA TALK ABOUT FRUIT MORE WHILE WE STILL HAVE TIME
ANY OTHER IDEAS FOR
UM WE STILL HAVE TIME IF THERE'S ANY OTHER INPUT
I MEAN THE I THINK WE DID REALLY WELL PERSONALLY WHICH IS WHY WE'VE
YOU KNOW GONE THROUGH THIS SO QUICKLY
'CAUSE I MEAN WE'VE ALL WE ALL KIND OF AGREED OUR PRODUCT IS SATISFACTORY IT FITS THE BUDGET AND IT'S TRENDY
SO
UM
SO I THINK THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY
MEETING ADJOURNED
YEAH
SO I GUESS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WRITE FINAL REPORTS
'CAUSE
I DON'T KNOW
HMM
HMM
OR IS THAT JUST ME
OKAY WELL UM
SO OUR DESIGN LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THIS BEING THE WHEEL THAT YOU USE TO UH CHANGE CHANNELS OR VOLUME OR WHATEVER
THIS IS A BUTTON SERVES AS THE POWER BUTTON IF YOU HOLD IT DOWN AND IF YOU JUST TAP ON IT I THINK IT BRINGS UP THE MENU
AND UH THE BASE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH HAS A SQUISHY SPONGY RUBBERY FEEL IS INTERCHANGEABLE
SO YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR ACCORDING TO YOUR TO SUIT YOUR LIVING ROOM OR WHATEVER
AND IT COMES YEAH I CAN CHANGE THE VEGETABLE
THIS ONE'S BROCCOLI
SO THIS SNAPS OFF AND YOU CAN PUT ON WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT
THIS IS NOT TO SCALE 'CAUSE IT WOULD HAVE THE BATTERY INSIDE IT
THIS IS A MANGO
THE IT'S TRENDY FRUIT IT'S NOT JUST ORDINARY FRUITS
YOU DON'T HAVE ORANGE YOU HAVE MANGO
UM I GUESS STRAWBERRY'S NOT AS TRENDY BUT
SO WE'LL COME UP WITH A VARIETY OF TRENDY AND EXCITING FRUIT DESIGNS FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND THEN PEOPLE WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO BUY THREE OR FIVE OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'LL NEED TO SWITCH 'EM OUT
MM-HMM
WELL THE LOCATOR IS JUST CHIP THAT'S INSIDE THERE
AND THE BEEPER'S ALSO INSIDE THERE TOO SOMEWHERE
YEAH WE DIDN'T DESIGN THAT
BUT IT WOULD BE COORDINATING WITH THAT OF COURSE
MM-HMM
MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT FLAT MEANT LIKE LIKE ONE OF THOSE SQUARE REMOTES
BUT IT'S REALLY NOT VERY CLEAR BECAUSE YOU GOT SINGLE CURVE AND DOUBLE CURVE AND D I DUNNO WHAT THAT MEANS
ONE SIDE IS CURVED AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE IS CURVED
MM-HMM
NO I THINK THAT'S ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
HMM
FEELS LIKE PLAY DOUGH
I'M GONNA SAY YES
I IMAGINE THEY'RE SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONT
WE HAVE A LITTLE CASE THAT YOU SLIP 'EM IN
'KAY
FIVE
FIVE
IT'S FOUR IF YOU WANNA DO THAT
IT ADDS TO SIXTEEN SO THAT'S FOUR
OH I THOUGHT SHE SAID FIVE
SIX
HUH
WAIT A MINUTE
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE OTHER WAY ROUND TOO
SH
YEAH I I WAS THINKING ONE MEANS NO POINTS YOU KNOW ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP
I'LL JUST I'LL JUST REVERSE THEM ALL
IT'S NO PROBLEM
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS HATED IT
OKAY
SAY TWO
TWO
ONE
UH TWO
YEAH I PUT IT DOWN AS ONE POINT FOUR FOR SOME REASON
MINE HAS ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS
UH THREE
WAIT WHY DID I PUT THREE
I MEANT ONE ON MINE TOO
THREE POINT ONE
I HAVE FOUR
THREE
ONE
TWO
THREE
TWO
MM-HMM
I THINK THE WHEEL WOULD PROBABLY BE MM
I THINK THE BASE WOULD DEFINITELY BE LARGER 'CAUSE SOME OF THESE ARE NOT AS EASY TO HOLD
THEY'RE KINDA SMALLISH
YEAH
WELL IF THEY'RE THAT S UH STRESS BALL STUFF THEY WOULD BE PRETTY SQUISHABLE
MM
NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF
RHUBARB
SO IT'S JUST COLOUR AND NOT NECESSARILY THE SHAPE OF A STRAWBERRY
WE COULD MAKE IT THAT SHAPE BUT JUST HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS AND CALL 'EM THE DIFFERENT FRUITS
WE WENT WITH SHAPE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING FUN WITH THE PLAY DOUGH
MM-HMM
THAT EVERYONE GAVE THAT A ONE OR A TWO
YEAH THEY'D PROBABLY BE EITHER ON THE FRONT OR THE SIDE OF THE REMOTE
NO I IMAGINE THERE'D BE SORT OF A HATCH DOOR YEAH UM LIKE ON A NORMAL REMOTE
SO IT WOULD PROBABLY EITHER IN THE F NO IT CAN'T BE IN THE FRONT 'CAUSE THE I. R. 'S RIGHT THERE BUT IT'D BE ON ONE OF THE SIDES PROBABLY
YEAH I'D AGREE WITH CHANGING THE SHAPE
UM I WAS JUST HAVING FUN MAKING STRAWBERRIES AND STUFF
IT MIGHT ALSO SORT OF ANNOY PEOPLE IF WE GET USED TO HAVING THE BUTTONS IN ONE SHAPE
I BET HAVING DIFFERENT COLOURS IS A LOT CHEAPER THAN HAVING DIFFERENT SHAPES TOO
SURE
SPONGINESS
I THINK IT WAS GOOD
WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE DOING
IT WAS A VERY DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND EVERYONE GOT TO CONTRIBUTE
WELL YOU TOLD US WHEN TO START AND WHEN TO END AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS
WELL I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF ANY MICROSOFT POWERPOINT OR ANY OF THIS STUFF
NO NO I NEVER TOUCH MACS EITHER
I JUST USE THE UNIX OR THE OFF MARKET SORT OF WORDPERFECT AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS
YEAH
WELL THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY NEW COMPUTER NEVER HAS WORDPERFECT SO I HAVE TO GO TRACK SOMEONE DOWN WHO HAS AN OLD DISK AND THEN I HAVE TO REINSTALL IT
SO I HAVE ALL THESE DOCUMENTS I CAN'T USE NOW
BUT YEAH I MEAN I GUESS IT'S OKAY
YEAH
I NEVER USE IT
YEAH
MY FIRST BIT OF INFORMATION WAS LIKE THIS CHILD'S DRAWN PICTURE OF HOW A REMOTE WORKS
YEAH IT PROBABLY DOES
YEAH
YEAH WELL MINE WAS MOSTLY MADE UP EXCEPT WHEN THEY TOLD ME LIKE YOU KNOW TITANIUM COSTS MORE THAN WOOD TO MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL
AS IF YOU'D WANTED TO
WELL I THINK IT'S INTERESTING HOW IT ALL WENT TOGETHER
LIKE I HAD THE STUFF ABOUT HOW ME HOW RUBBER'S CHEAP AND YOU HAVE HOW PEOPLE WANT IT TO BE SPONGY AND
IT SEEMS PLANNED YOU KNOW
YEAH
IF I HADN'T BEEN TOLD THAT FRUIT WAS
THEY'RE PRETTY COOL
THEY'RE KINDA HARD TO WRITE WITH THOUGH
THEY'RE NICER THAN THE PEN THAT I'M USING BECAUSE LIKE YOUR STUFF ACTUALLY SHOWS UP HERE RATHER THAN HAVING TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN AND WRITE
BUT EVEN SO I DUNNO
OH YEAH
WELL THEY DROP OFF IF YOU LIKE MOVE TOO MUCH
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TESTING THESE MICROPHONES
MAYBE WE ARE
I DON'T KNOW
WELL THE THING IS LIKE I ACTUALLY WORKED IN A COMPANY AND I HAD A ROLE AND I HAD TO GO TO MEETINGS
AND LIKE THE LAST THING I WOULD HAVE WANTED WOULD BE TO HAVE TO WATCH A VIDEO 'CAUSE I MISSED A MEETING
LIKE USUALLY I MISSED MEETINGS DELIBERATELY
THERE'S JUST THERE'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH INFORMATION THAT ACTUALLY GOES THROUGH A REAL MEETING LIKE WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY AT A REAL MEETING IN A REAL COMPANY
IT'S MOSTLY LIKE REHASHING OLD STUFF
AND YOU'RE SORT OF GOING OVER GENERAL STUFF THAT ANYBODY WHO'S SORT OF ON TASK SHOULD ALREADY KNOW
IT'S LIKE THE THERE'S JUST REALLY NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT GOES THROUGH
IT SEEMS LIKE WAY OVERKILL
LIKE IF I MISSED A MEETING I COULD PROBABLY GET IT SUMMED UP IN LIKE ONE SENTENCE
I WOULDN'T NEED TO HAVE TO WATCH LIKE A T TWO HOUR VIDEO WITH THE SOUND AND THE TRANSCRIPT AND
I THINK I'VE LEARNED NOT TO BRING PLAY DOUGH TO MEETINGS
IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO GET PEOPLE ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE FOOD
ALL OF US
YOU COULD CHANGE THE VEGETABLE OR FRUIT
YEAH
IT'S BEEN A L
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO UM MAKE SURE THAT IT'S HAND HOLDABLE AND THAT THE USER CAN USE IT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TOO BIG
UH BUT WE THINK THAT THIS YOU KNOW THIS SIZE WILL BE OKAY AND WE WILL HAVE TO FIT THE BATTERY CASE IN THERE SOMEHOW
AND I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WAS OR DESIGN YET ACTUALLY WOULD BE THE UM THING THE LOCATOR
HOW HOW SO
OKAY SO THAT'S JUST
SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BUTTON ON YOUR ON YOUR YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THE BUTTON TO THE
YEAH WE HAVE THAT THAT HAS YES YET TO BE DESIGNED
YEAH THAT C HEY THAT THAT COULD YOU KNOW MATCH THE HANDSET
YOU COULD HAVE A BROCCOLI OR YOU COULD HAVE A MANGO
SO
TADA
MM
YEAH
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN BRING THIS UP ON OUR OWN
IS IT MEETING THREE MINUTES
NO IT'S NOT MINUTES
OKAY
OKAY
COOL
TRUE'S ONE AND FALSE IS SEVEN
SO IT'S ACTUALLY A SCALE
OKAY
DOES IT FEEL FANCY
NO
YEAH
OKAY
ONE
HMM
UM THREE
YEAH
SO IT'S A ONE WAS TRUE AND SEVEN WAS FALSE
OKAY SO YOU GUYS REALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT
I WAS LIKE WHY DID YOU GUYS DESIGN IT THAT WAY IF YOU HATED IT
YEAH
ONE
UH THREE
ONE
UH TWO
UH ONE
YEAH
UH ONE
UH
ONE
ONE
ONE
TWO
ONE
WHICH ONE IS THAT AGAIN SORRY
THREE POINT ONE
I THINK
WHAT IF WE JUST SMASH ALL THE VEGETABLES DOWN FLAT
AND LIKE THEN IT YOU COULD HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND BETTER
YEAH
THE FLAT ONE
YEAH
YEAH
I DIDN'T YEAH
BUT LIKE IF IF YOU JUST SQUASH THEM FLAT LIKE AND YOU MADE IT FLAT
BUT IT'S STILL TOO BIG I THINK IN YOUR HAND
YEAH
YEAH LIKE CERTAIN ONES YOU'D HAVE TO LIMIT THE FRUIT SELECTION LIKE YOU COULD PROBABLY DO A STRAWBERRY STILL
I THINK THE BROCCOLI WOULD BE OUT
YOU COULD DO ALTHOUGH THE BROCCOLI IS QUITE COMFORTABLE I HAVE TO SAY LIKE SORTA LIKE A JOYSTICK
I DON'T KNOW
SO
UH
RHUBARB
THESE OBSCURE FRUITS
I THINK WE NEEDN'T
HUH
OH OKAY
YEAH
THAT COULD WORK
YEAH
YEAH
I DUNNO
YEAH
'CAUSE YEAH NO ONE WANTS TO HOLD A REMOTE THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE OBVIOUSLY
OR LIKE I DUNNO SOME OF 'EM YOU CAN KIND OF THINK SEE AS LIKE
LIKE YOU COULD IF IT WAS ONLY THIS YOU KNOW IF IT WAS SHAPED LIKE THAT AND IT JUST HAD THAT
BUT YOU SEE THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THAT AND THIS HAS TO BE DETACHABLE
SO LIKE MAYBE THAT'S JUST TOO BIG BECAUSE
YEAH IT'S SORTA LIKE A JOYSTICK
I DUNNO
I GUESS
YEAH
DIF
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE UH WE COULD DO I'M TRYING TO THINK OF OTHER SHA LIKE FRUITS THAT ARE ODDLY SHAPED
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
WE COULD TR I DON'T KNOW
COOL
WELL
YEAH THE BROCCOLI I GUESS WINS
WE WERE A BIT OFF TASK
UM SO UH I CAN'T THINK OF ANY
SO WE'LL HAVE TO LIKE
MM
YEAH I DUNNO
YOU COULD MAKE THE TOUCH PAD IN TH IN DIFFERENT SHAPES BUT THEN THAT KIND OF RE DESIGNS THE WHOLE PROJECT LIKE BUT YOU COULD DO LIKE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
MM
HMM
I DID
THE PROTOTYPE MAKING WAS VERY CREATIVELY STIMULATING AND I THINK WE'VE COME UP WITH A PRODUCT THAT'S FUN AND MEETS ALL THE CRITERIA
I THINK YOU WERE FINE
YOU DID A GOOD JOB LEADING
YEAH I THINK IT MORE THAN ANYTHING WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE OUR SET ROLES SO MUCH
AS WE JUST WOULD BE LIKE I DON'T KNOW ALL HAD IDEAS ABOUT IT BUT YEAH
NO
HMM
I FELT LIKE MY I DUNNO IF IT WAS JUST MY ROLE
BUT L BUT UH I DI I THOUGHT THAT MY THE INFORMATION THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME WAS KIND OF JUST LIKE OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST THE IDEA THAT WE HAD
BUT THERE'S KINDA IT WAS KINDA LIKE OKAY I DON'T REALLY THINK I DUNNO WHAT I'M DOING HERE
SO I DIDN'T REALLY THINK IT WAS HELPFUL
SO I KIND OF JUST MADE UP MY OWN STUFF AND I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS SO I KIND OF WROTE A LOT OF NOTES INSTEAD
BUT YEAH I D I DON'T REALLY LIKE POWERPOINT PERSONALLY THINK IT'S KINDA STUPID
YEAH BUT UH
YEAH
IT DIDN'T REALLY YEAH
SO LIKE A F
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH I MEAN IT
YEAH I KINDA THOUGHT THAT UM I FELT LIKE I WOULD GO AND LIKE TRY TO USE MY INFORMATION
OR LIKE I'D MAKE THIS STUPID LITTLE PRESENTATION AND THEN LIKE I JUST WOULD END UP TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNRELATED BECAUSE I DUNNO I FELT LIKE I WAS OFF TASK ALL THE TIME
BUT UM
YEAH
I WANNA S
I I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON THE
YEAH I THINK I'D LIKE TO UM
I DUNNO
LIKE IT WAS THE I THINK THE MICROPHONES ARE OKAY WHEN YOU'RE SITTING DOWN
BUT LIKE THEY'RE KINDA CLUMSY I GUESS WHEN YOU'RE LIKE WHEN YOU'RE S GOING UP TO THE WHITEBOARD LIKE
YEAH I DUNNO
BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE OKAY
UH I THINK AND I THINK THAT UH
ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY LIKE I GUESS SOME PEOPLE MUST BE INTERESTED IN USING IT BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE FINDING IT ANY MORE USEFUL THAN LIKE LOOKING AT SOMEONE'S NOTES
OR LIKE I DUNNO
HM
I GUESS IT WOULD BE
IT'S GOTTA BE WORTH IT TO I 'CAUSE I'M JUST MOSTLY CURIOUS ABOUT LIKE WHAT KIND OF PERSON OR LIKE COMPANY WOULD WOULD REALLY FIND IT USEFUL 'CAUSE
CAN'T REALLY IMAGINE DUNNO
HOW ABOUT A P A
UM I DUNNO
YEAH
M MEETING ADJOURNED
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA I LIKE IT
UM EVALUATION CRITERIA
I'VE GOT A PRESENTATION
SO I NEED WHERE'S THE CABLE
RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS IS WE HAVE TO UM DECIDE WHETHER THIS THIS WHOLE
THIS WHOLE PROJECT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON ACTUALLY UM MEETS THE STANDARDS WE WERE SET AT THE START
UM
RIGHT
THIS DOESN'T OKAY
UM THE METHOD IS WE WELL I'VE ANALYSED THE USER REQUIREMENTS AND INTEGRATED THEM TO THE TRENDS FOUND IN MARKETING REPORTS AND IN OUR COMPANY STRATEGY MARKETING
AND UM THE FINDINGS WERE THAT WE NEED IT TO LOOK IN A CERTAIN WAY FEEL IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THIS IS EVERYTHING'S LISTED DOWN
UM LOOK IN A CERTAIN WAY FEEL IN A CERTAIN WAY IT HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE AND IT HAS TO BE EASY TO USE
THESE ARE ALL THINGS WE LOOKED AT AT THE START UM AND CRITERIA THAT HAVE TO BE MET
WE HAVE TO USE A TABLE I'LL SHOW YOU THAT LATER TOGETHER TO DECIDE WHETHER IT MEETS THE STANDARDS
AND WE WE HAVE THEREFORE IN TOTAL UM
WE HAVE FIVE WE HAVE ELEVEN POINTS ACCORDING TO WHICH THIS SHOULD BE EVALUATED
AND UM THE CRI WELL BASICALLY THE FINDINGS ARE THE SAME AS THE EVALUATION CRITERIA
I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU THE TABLE WE HAVE TO USE
UM
NO
THIS IS THE TABLE
CAN YOU SEE THIS HERE
UM SO THE QUE THE QUESTIONS I'VE GIVEN YOU C COULD YOU WRITE THAT DOWN
TRUE IS ONE AND AND FALSE IS SEVEN
AND WE'LL JUST GO THROUGH EACH POINT TOGETHER HOPEFULLY
UM
I THINK IF EACH OF US GIVES AN OPINION THEN THEY CAN BE MIXED SOMEHOW
I DUNNO HOW IT WORKS EXACTLY I HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD
YEAH IT'S IN THE UM
IT'S IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS
IT'S CALLED EVALUATION CRITERIA
AND IT'S
UNDER EVALUATION
YEAH
YOU'VE FOUND IT ALL
SO IT WAS UM
YEAH TRUE'S ONE
DO YOU WANT US TO DISCUSS THIS TOGETHER OR DO YOU WANT US TO DO IT SINGLY
YEAH OKAY
UM
YES IT'S IF IT'S FANCY YOU PUT ONE IF IT'S REALLY UNFANCY IT'S SEVEN
YEAH SOMETHING
THEY SHOULDN'T REALLY BE QUESTIONS
SHOULD BE MORE LIKE
ARE THE BATTERIES EASY TO INSERT
YES
VERY VERY TRUE
OKAY
OKAY
APPARENTLY I'M SUPPOSED TO USE THE WHITEBOARD
DO WE UM IS IT NECESSARY
WE'LL JUST DO UM
YEAH
OKAY
I DON'T FEEL ANY RIGHT UM
RIGHT SO ONE POINT ONE
WE'LL JUST GO IN A CIRCLE
RIGHT
OOH I DON'T KNOW
RIGHT
ONE
FIVE
TWO
OKAY SO DO WE JUST ADD IT UP AND DIVIDE IT BY FOUR
IS THAT WHAT THE COMPANY DOES
YEAH
OH NO
IT ADDS TO THIRTEEN
ONE FIVE FIVE TWO
ONE FIVE FIVE TWO IS THIRTEEN OVER FOUR FOR NOW
I THINK THAT'S UM NEXT
REALLY
TWO
UH OH
RIGHT
ONE POINT THREE IS
YEAH
I REALLY
WELL UH
YEAH YEAH
IT WAS ONE IS TRUE AND FALSE IS SEVEN
I SHOULD'VE KEPT THE TABLE UP
RIGHT WELL I'M GLAD THIS CAME OUT
YEAH
NO
OH THAT'S QUITE FUNNY
OKAY
OKAY
SO STARTING AGAIN ONE POINT ONE
TWO
OKAY ONE POINT TWO
TWO
OKAY
UM ONE POINT THREE
HA
TWO POINT ONE
YEAH
OH DEAR OKAY
SORRY
TWO AND ONE
SORRY ABOUT THAT
T TWO POINT TWO WHICH IS ONE POINT FIVE
OKAY
THREE POINT ONE
IS THAT CORRECT ON MY SLIDE
YEAH
ONE FOUR THREE THREE THREE POINT TWO
THREE POINT THREE
FOUR POINT ONE
TWO
FOUR POINT TWO
TWO AND FOUR POINT THREE
ONE TWO
RIGHT SO I PUT ONE ON THAT
OKAY I'LL UM I'LL JUST DO THE CALCULATIONS NOW IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE
OR IS IT TEDIOUS
I'M I'M SORRY THIS WAS SO TEDIOUS FOR EVERYONE
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO DO IT
OKAY
WELL THE WORST ONES WERE THREE POINT ONE
DO DOES EVERY ONES HAVE THE SLIDE
THREE POINT ONE
SLIDE SHOW
MATERIAL TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE OKAY
UM DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT
WHAT ARE THE SUGGESTIONS
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
YEAH THAT IT'S THREE POINT ONE WAS NOT THAT GOOD
FOUR POINT ONE
THE SHAPE
FOUR POINT TWO
YEAH
THAT LOOKED REALLY GOOD
ARE THERE ANY FRUITS THAT LOOK LIKE BROCCOLI NO
I THINK THAT BROCCOLI IS MY FAVOURITE ACTUALLY
UH DESPITE THE
YEAH
YEAH AND JUST HAVE THE COLOUR MATCH OR SOMETHING
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM
THINK THE CRITICAL ONES CAME OUT TO BE YEAH THAT ONE
BATTERIES EASY TO INSERT FOR SOME REASON WHICH CAN BE EASILY I THINK THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM ANY MORE
NO
I THINK EVERYONE'S UNDER THREE ANYWAY
SO I THINK IT'S YEAH THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO POINTS
YEAH
DO YOU WANT THIS AND WE CAN ALL
NO
IT'S ALRIGHT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WE DIDN'T WE UH IT ALL C SORT OF BLENDED QUITE WELL
WHICH ISN'T VERY USER FRIENDLY THOUGH
I THOUGH IT WAS BRILLIANT NO
NO MINE WAS REALLY HELPFUL AS IN MY STUFF WAS QUITE HELPFUL I THINK
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE ROLE NO
YEAH
BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BUILD A WHOLE UM
A WHOLE SYSTEM 'CAUSE OF COURSE THEY CAN'T GIVE YOU UH UH ANYTHING COMPARABLE TO THE INTERNET FOR THE
YEAH YEAH
NO
BUT I THINK THAT IT IT MIGHT BE TO SEE WHETHER PEOPLE ACTUALLY ALL COME UP WITH THE SAME THING
YEAH LIKE IF EVERYONE'S GIVEN THE SAME INPUT I DON'T HAVE A CLUE ANYWAY
UM WHAT'S NEXT
LOOKS LIKE OH NO THAT'S NOT UM
IT'S QUITE
YEAH
YEAH IT'S ALL VERY NEW NO
IT'S ALL VERY NEW
SORRY
WHAT WHAT'S THE END
ARE WE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO UM YOU SUPPOSED TO WRITE A REPORT
OR WE ENDING
IS THAT THE END
END OF MEETING
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER SHE
OKAY WE HAVE TO FILL IN ALL THIS STUFF
STUFF STUFF STUFF
YEAH
WELL THERE'S AL EIGHT NINE
OOH
OH OOH
OKAY
SO AS YOU GUYS KNOW F ISSCO IS TOO SMALL
WELL THE BUILDING IS TOO SMALL FOR OUR GROUP
SO WE'RE MOVING TO A NEW BUILDING
UH IT'S GONNA BE THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY MOVING IN THREE WEEKS
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO KNOW WHO IS GOING TO BE IN WHAT OFFICE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND WHERE WE'RE G WE'RE GONNA PUT THINGS LIKE THE PRINTER
THE FAX MACHINE ALL THE BIG EQUIPMENT
AND THE CATCH IS THAT THEY HAVE THE FINAL APPROVAL OF WHERE WE PUT PEOPLE AND EQUIPMENT
AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE GONNA DO ALL THIS BY NOVEMBER SECOND
SO THAT MEANS BASICALLY NEXT TUESDAY
AND SINCE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER TIME WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS TODAY
WHAT WE'RE GETTING IS NINE ROOMS FOR A MAXIMUM OF EIGHTEEN PEOPLE WHICH IS OKAY 'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY FIFTEEN OF US
AND ALL THE ROOMS HAVE WINDOWS LUCKILY SO THERE'S NO FIGHTS ABOUT WHO GETS A WINDOW AND WHO DOESN'T
UM THERE'S TWO VIEWS EITHER OF THE OLD TOWN OR THE MOUNTAINS AND THE ROOMS HAVE VARIOUS SIZES
THERE'S TWO THREE PEOPLE ROOMS FIVE TWO PERSON ROOMS WHICH ARE ON THE CORNERS OF THE BUILDING
SO YOU ACTUALLY GET WINDOWS ON TWO WALLS AND TWO ONE PERSON ROOMS
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT THE BUILDING LOOKS LIKE
UM AND THEN YOU HAVE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PER ROOM
THE COURTYARD BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE SIXTH FLOOR YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY GO OUT TO IT BUT IT JUST MEANS THAT THE WINDOWS LOOK OUT ONTO OPEN SPACE
UM YOU CAN SEE THE BATHROOMS THE ELEVATORS ARE SORT OF FURTHER DOWN THE HALL
THE PURPLE BAR AT THE BOTTOM SORT OF ON THE RIGHT IS THE MAIL BOXES
ALL OF THE WINDOWS OPEN YOU CAN GET OUT ONTO THE TERRACE JUST LIKE WE CAN IN OUR NORMAL BUILDING
AND THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE TO PUT SOMEWHERE ARE LIKE I SAID THE PHOTOCOPIER WHICH IS REALLY BIG
THE FAX MACHINE WHICH IS NOT SO BIG AND THE PRINTER WHICH IS RELATIVELY BIG
EACH OFFICE HAS A WHITE BOARD A BULLETIN BOARD AND A COAT RACK
NO CUPBOARDS LIKE WE HAVE IN THE CURRENT OFFICES AND EACH PERSON GETS THEIR OWN CHAIR THEIR OWN CORNER DESK
SO LIKE THE N THE ONES THAT WE HAVE NOW UM A SMALL FILING CABINET WITH THREE DRAWERS
AND BY SMALL I MEAN THEY'RE ABOUT THAT TALL AND ONE SORT OF HANGING SHELF
SO WE DON'T GET THE BOOKCASES LIKE WE HAVE NOW BUT JUST ONE SHELF THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE WALL
AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE TO PLACE UH YOU CAN SEE THE LIST THERE ALONG WITH THEIR POSITION AND THE PROJECT THAT THEY WORK ON
AND I GUESS THE QUESTION THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW WE WANT TO ORGANISE PEOPLE
WHETHER WE WANT TO DO IT BY RANK OR BY PROJECT OR
I DON'T KNOW PUT ALL THE P. H. D. STUDENTS TOGETHER ALL THE PROFESSORS TOGETHER THAT SORT OF THING
SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE COME UP WITH A PLAN
THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP WHO'S GONNA BE WORKING ON THE SAME PLAN LATER THIS WEEK
AND THEN ANDRE AND I HAVE TO DO PRESENTATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS ON THE SECOND
SO WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN POSSIBLY IF WE HAVE TIME A PRESENTATION
A QUICK PRESENTATION WITH ARGUMENTS FOR WHY WE THINK OUR PLAN WORKS BEST
OKAY
SO ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEAS OR
I GUESS
YEAH
UM I THINK IT'S THE SECURITY IS SORT OF THE SAME AS IT IS IN THE CURRENT BUILDING
SO AS LONG AS THE THINGS ARE PHYSICALLY ATTACHED TO THE WALL SO THEY CAN'T BE REMOVED THEN IT SHOULD BE OKAY TO LEAVE THEM IN THE HALL
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU ARE PRINTING SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS OR N WHATEVER
UM WELL WE GET ONE SORT OF NETWORKED PRINTER AND THEN I THINK SOME OF US HAVE PERSONAL PRINTERS
I THINK SUSAN HAS A PERSONAL PRINTER GISELLA HAS ONE MAYBE
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO ELSE
YEAH
BUT NO ONE ELSE GETS THEIR OWN PRINTER
IN TERMS OF EQUIPMENT IT'S SORT OF THE SAME THING AS WE HAVE NOW
UM
SO WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS THAT WE SORT OF DISCUSS VARIOUS CONCEPTS WITHOUT GETTING INTO SPECIFICS
AND THEN GO OFF AND THINK ABOUT IT OVER LUNCH AND THEN COME BACK LATER IN THE DAY WITH SORT OF MORE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS
AS TO EXACTLY WHERE TO PUT PEOPLE
DOES THAT WORK
OH AND ON THE MAP THE LITTLE HALF CIRCULAR WELL QUATER CIRCLES ARE DOORS WHICH I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE FIGURED OUT BUT JUST IN CASE
AND THERE'S JUST THE ONE ROOM THAT ACTUALLY HAS TWO DOORS GOING INTO IT THE THE THREE PERSON ROOM ON THE RIGHT
YEAH
YES YEAH
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE A READING ROOM
SO WE SHOULD LEAVE A SPACE FOR THAT
AND WE CAN BECAUSE LIKE I SAID MAXIMUM EIGHTEEN PEOPLE IN THOSE ROOMS AND THERE IS ONLY FIFTEEN OF US
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED BUT TWO OF US ARE ONLY HERE HALF THE TIME
SO MARTIN AND DAVID UM ARE HALF THE TIME AT THE E. P. F. L. AND HALF THE TIME IN GENEVA
SO
SORT OF KEEP THAT IN MIND I GUESS WHEN
YOU ARE DOING THE ACTUAL PLANNING
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT GISELLA'S REALLY THE ONLY ADMINISTRATOR
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND SHE'S ALWAYS MOVING AROUND
NO
YEAH
WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN ASSUME THAT THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY OVERLAP BETWEEN THEM
YEAH
EITHER THAT OR MAYBE PUT HER IN A TWO PERSON ROOM WITH THE EQUIPMENT OR
LIKE WITH THE THE PHOTOCOPIER OR MAYBE NOT THE PHOTOCOPIER BUT THE PRINTER
YEAH YEAH
AND NOT WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT STAFF YEAH A STAFF WORKER
YEAH
I MEAN THE ROOMS AREN'T TINY IF YOU LOOK AT THE THIS
YEAH YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE TO PUT THE FAX IN THERE
UH
SO
YEAH
YEAH
WELL THE THIRD OPTION IS JUST COMPLETELY MIX EVERYONE UP WHICH SOME PEOPLE SAY IS BETTER SORT OF FOR A GROUP ENVIRONMENT
SO THAT YOU ARE NOT STUCK ONLY WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ON YOUR PROJECT
RIGHT
SO IF YOU SHARE AN OFFICE WITH SOMEONE WHO'S ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROJECT YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THAT PROJECT
BUT YOU ALSO SORT OF INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS
YEAH
I THINK IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF RESERVING IT BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER ROOMS AT THE UNIVERSITY THAT YOU CAN RESERVE FOR A MEETING
BUT IF IT'S EMPTY THEN SURE YOU CAN USE IT FOR A MEETING
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT
BUT I THINK IF SOMEONE'S ALREADY READING IN THERE IT'S NOT FAIR TO GO AND KICK THEM OUT JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE A MEETING 'CAUSE
BUT IF YOU'RE HAVING A SHORT MEETING YOU DON'T REALLY
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR IT
YOU JUST KIND OF GO TO SOMEONE'S OFFICE AND GO DOWN FOR A COFFEE OR WHATEVER
'CAUSE THERE'S STILL THE CAFETERIAS THAT YOU CAN USE FOR INFORMAL
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND THE OTHER MARIANNE TOO
SO THERE'S THREE OF YOU
WELL BUT THEN YOU EITHER SHARE OFFICES WITH EACH OTHER WHICH DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM
BECAUSE CHANCES ARE YOU ARE NOT GONNA HAVE OFFICE HOURS AT THE EXACT SAME TIME
SO YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE
LIKE UNLESS YOU GET INDIVIDUAL OFFICES I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN EASY WAY TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR THAT
'CAUSE EVEN IF EACH OF YOU SHARE WITH A PROFESSOR THEN IT'S THE SAME THING FOR THE PROFESSOR
BUT IT IS SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND
UNLESS YOU END UP SHARING AN OFFICE WITH SOMEONE WHERE YOUR SCHEDULES COMPLETELY DON'T OVERLAP AND THEN YOU CAN SCHEDULE OFFICE HOURS WHEN THE OTHER PERSON ISN'T THERE
SOME PEOPLE COME IN AROUND ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE COME IN AROUND EIGHT
NO
NO BUT YOU SORT OF SEE PEOPLE'S PATTERNS
I MEAN
EVEN IF IT'S NOT ALWAYS LIKE THAT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE THAT YOU KNOW EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE TIME THEN
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT WE CAN'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS TOO MUCH
I THINK
WELL IT'S UP TO US HOW WE DO IT
I CAN SEE BENEFITS OF BOTH
BUT
YEAH
PLUS THE COMPUTERS
AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE FIVE COMPUTERS IN YOUR OFFICE
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT BECAUSE IF WE TAKE THE THREE PERSON ROOM OUT AS A READING ROOM
THEN EVERYONE HAS AN OFFICE RIGHT
'CAUSE IT'S MAXIMUM EIGHTEEN
SO TAKE AWAY THREE SPACES AND YOU'RE DOWN TO YOUR FIFTEEN AND YOU'RE RIGHT IF WE DO HAVE A STAGIEUR WHOEVER
WHO COMES IN THEN WE HAVE NOWHERE WELL WE CAN PUT THEM IN THE READING ROOM BUT THAT KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
OR AGAIN FIND PEOPLE WHO DON'T WORK THE SAME HOURS
IT DOESN'T COMPLETELY SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT
YEAH I THINK SO
A ONE PERSON'LL BE TOO SMALL ANYWAYS
THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM
YEAH
TWO
WELL WHICH W THERE'S THREE TWO PERSON ROOMS
THAT HAS TWO WINDOWS
WHICH IS FINE
AND STILL A BIG ROOM
YEAH SO I SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED THAT
YEAH BUT THEN YOU GET DON'T GET A LOT OF LIGHT
FOR READING
REALLY
THAT'S
I DUNNO I LIKE THE IDEA OF LOOKING OUT OVER
LOTS OF SPACE
WELL I MEAN THAT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT RIGHT
IT'S JUST SOMEWHERE TO GET OUT OF YOUR OFFICE AND GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE FOR A WHILE WHETHER YOU'RE READING OR JUST KIND OF STARING OFF INTO SPACE
YEAH WE COULD DO THAT
YEAH
WE HAVE SOME SHELVES LIKE CABINET TYPE SHELVES FOR THE READING ROOM
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY INTENDED TO BE A LIBRARY
I MEAN WE HAVE
AN I. T. LIBRARY
UM BUT
THE OTHER IDEA IS TO TAKE 'CAUSE RIGHT NOW WE ALL HAVE BOOKSHELVES
SO ONE IDEA MIGHT BE TO TAKE SORT OF THE BOOKS THAT AREN'T FREQUENTLY USED BY PEOPLE PUT THEM ALL INTO THAT ROOM
SO IT BECOMES SORT OF
A MINI LIBRARY BUT NOT LIKE A LIBRARY SYSTEM LIBRARY JUST GO AND BORROW YOUR COLLEGUES' BOOKS
I THINK THE MIDDLE ONE
YEAH
IT'S ALSO SORT OF M CENTRAL TO THE LAYOUT SO EVERYONE SORT OF HAS MORE OR LESS THE SAME DISTANCE TO
IT'S NOT THAT IT MAKES THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BUT
WHY NOT
UH
YEAH
ACTUALLY WHAT I CAN DO IS
YEAH
UM ACTUALLY THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
J JUST PUT IT UP
YEAH
SO
THIS REALLY ISN'T TO SCALE BUT OH WELL
UM
THAT'S REALLY NOT TO SCALE
UM SO WE'VE GOT AN OFFICE THERE
AND THERE'S
TWO AND ONE
IS THAT ALL
OKAY SO THIS IS
THAT
AND THIS BECOMES THE READING ROOM RIGHT
YES
SURE
YEAH
OKAY
BUT IF GISELLA WORKS FIFTY PERCENT AND THEY WORK FIFTY PERCENT
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
BUT
JUST
DOES GISELLA HAVE HER OWN PRINTER
WELL IF YOU PUT HER IN IN THIS ROOM HERE IT'S RELATIVELY CLOSE
TRUE
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE PROXIMITY TO THE MAILBOX MATTERS
BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN SHE'S HERE AND SHE PICKS UP THE MAIL SHE ACTUALLY BRINGS IT TO YOUR OFFICE
IT'S MORE THE I. T. ADMINISTRATION THAT USES OUR MAILBOXES
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH UNLESS YOU PUT IT INTO AN OFFICE WHICH IS JUST AN ANNOYING I THINK
'CAUSE EVEN IF YOU PUT IT INTO GISELLA'S OFFICE IT'S GONNA BE
YEAH
SO
MM
AT THE BEGINNING WE SAID THAT WE WERE GONNA GIVE HER ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOMS
OKAY
YEAH
WELL SHE'S GO AHEAD
STAGIEURS IN THERE
AND THEY ARE NOT REALLY IN A POSITION TO COMPLAIN
YEAH
I THINK IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WORK CONDITIONS LIKE IF YOU ARE A STAGIEUR AND YOU CO ONLY COMING IN FOR TWO MONTHS
THEN YOU CAN PUT UP WITH IT BUT IF YOU'RE THERE YOU KNOW FOR THE FULL YEAR
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH IN THERE IF THEY NEED TO GO
YEAH
YEAH
SOUTH WELL SOUTHWEST IF THAT'S NORTH
SOUTHWEST FOR US
NO THA WELL I'M ASSUMING THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT RIGHT
THAT
BUT THAT'S SOUTHEAST ANYWAYS
THIS OFFICE RIGHT
THAT'S
NO I I'M VERY BAD AT ORIENTING WHERE'S NORTH IN GENEVA I ALWAYS GET IT WRONG
BUT I JUST ASSUMED NIKOS WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ORIENTATION HERE
OH THAT'S TRUE
SO WAIT WE FACE THE OLD TOWN WE FACE THE OLD TOWN NOW AND WE ARE FACING
NORTHEAST
OKAY
SO
THIS IS NORTHEAST
YEAH
MM-HMM
THIS ONE
IT'S THE OVEN
YEAH WE'RE THE TOP FLOOR
YEAH
IT THE BUILDING DESIGN IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE ONE WE HAVE NOW WE'RE JUST GETTING MORE SPACE THIS WAY
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T MOVE IN THE OTHER BUILDING 'CAUSE IT WAS OCCUPIED BY THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS
ACTUALLY WHY DON'T I CHANGE IT ON HERE AS WELL
SO THAT'S GISELLA
PLUS FAX
AND THEN THIS IS THE READING ROOM
OOPS
UM
SO THAT LEAVES US WITH WHAT
SIX EIGHT FOURTEEN PLACES WHICH IS
FOR F YEAH
NO FOR FOURTEEN 'CAUSE GISELLA'S ALREADY GOT A ROOM
EXCUSE ME
OKAY
UM
SO I'M GONNA TAKE GISELLA OFF OF
THAT LIST AS WELL
I'LL PUT HER IN GREY I GUESS
THAT'S BORING
CAN WE
NO
WE HAVE WE HAVE ONE EXTRA ONE PERSON OFFICE AND
TWO THREE PERSON OFFICES YEAH
PLUS WE HAVE THE TWO PEOPLE WHO AREN'T THERE NOW
THAT WE HAVE TO PUT SOMEWHERE
WE CAN KEEP SOME OF THE PEOPLE TOGETHER THAT ARE TOGETHER NOW BUT
NOT EVERYONE DEFINITELY
WELL WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK AND GO OFF AND THINK ABOUT IT
AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE MORE CONCRETE IDEAS WE CAN COME BACK AND FINISH IT
'CAUSE IF WE JUST SIT HERE AND DISCUSS IT'S GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME AND WE'RE GONNA START ARGUING AND GET CRANKY AND
ALRIGHT SO
YEAH
YEP
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
WE CAN PUT IT
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY
'KAY SURE
YEAH
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
AD ADMINISTRATOR
YEAH THAT WOULD BE
MAYBE CONVENIENT
WITH SOMEONE
YEAH AND WITH SOMEONE WHO IS WHO IS FIFTY PRO PERCENT
YEAH OKAY MM-HMM
TYPING MACHINE
YES YEAH
OR UH YEAH PROFESSOR ASSISTENT OR UH
OR UH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
MM MM
BUT STILL I FIND IT'S QUITE EASY IF YOU ARE WITH PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE SAME PROJECT IN THE SAME ROOM
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE MEETINGS OR PEOPLE COME AND ASK YOU DISCUSS THINGS MAYBE
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S UH
FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHO IS NOT WORKING ON THE SAME PROJECT
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YOU CAN U MM-HMM
MEETING ABOUT THE PROJECT
MM-HMM
YEAH
HMM
PEOPLE COMING AND GOING
YEAH WE DON'T
YEP YEAH
MM
YEAH IT CERTAINLY IS
PLUS THE COM MM-HMM
YEAH BUT IF THERE ARE PEOPLE COMING IN I MEAN WE HAVE THESE PEOPLE WORKING FOR UH TWO MONTHS WHO COMES IN THE SUMMERTIME OR SOMETHING
I TH THINK WE SHOULD RESERVE A LITTLE BIT SPACE FOR THEM TOO
SO UH
IT'S QUITE BIG
MM
FOR SOEMTHING YEAH MM
YEAH THAT'S YEAH CERTAINLY IS
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE GOOD
ON THE SIXTH FLOOR I DON'T KNOW
YEAH IF YOU ARE IF YOU ARE READING
DO SO YEAH
WHY NOT
YEAH
A LIBRARY DOWN DOWNSTAIRS
MM
IN THE MIDDLE YEAH
OH IT'S G GOOD ENOUGH
AND UH GISELLA
WE THOUGHT A ONE PERSON ROOM
PERSON ROOM
OR F
YES YES SHE DOES
AND THE PLACE WHERE WE ALL PASS KIND OF
IT SHOULD BE SOME CENTRAL PLACE
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
I IT YEAH
SO FOR EXAMPLE NOW IF UH WE RESERVE
YEAH YEAH
BUT WE CAN UH RESERVE SO IF YOU RESERVE A TWO PEOPLE ROOM WE CAN PUT UH TRAINEES
FURTHER ON IF THEY ARE IN THE SAME ROOM
IN THE CORNER
SOUTH
SOUTHEAST YEAH
THAT'S SOUTHEAST
NORTH
WHEN DO WE HAVE SUN
BUT S
WELL THERE IS A QUITE A LOT OF SUN
Y YES AND NO
IT'S YEAH IT'S REALLY WARM THAT'S
YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY GOOD P SO
AND NEXT
SO WE HAVE RESERVED NOW TWO TWO PERSON ROOMS
MM-HMM
FOR FIFTEEN PEOPLE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MARIANNE MARIANNE
YEAH WHY NOT
YEAH THAT WOULD BE FUN
THAT'S BORING
NO WE DON'T
OKAY
SO WE ONLY GET ONE PRINTER FOR FIFTEEN PEOPLE
THE THREE PERSON ROOM
MM
YEAH I W I WOULD SUGGEST THAT TOO
YEAH
OKAY SO TH THAT'S A ONE PERSON ROOM BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW HOW BIG THEY ARE
OR IT'S HARD TO TELL
I MEAN GISELLA HAS THIS FUNNY UH TYPING UH THING
YEAH
COMPUTER FAX
SO PROBABLY SH SHE SHOULD GET THE FAX RIGHT
'KAY UH WILL IT BE DEDICATED FOR READING AND FOR STUDYING OR CAN WE HAVE MEETINGS THERE
CAN RESERVE IT FOR MEETINGS
WELL
THE THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU HAVE TO GO ACROSS THE BUILDING AND IT ADDS SOME OVERHEAD EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME SHORT MEETING AND DISCUSS SOME ISSUES
OR MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T CALL IT READING ROOM BUT
SO PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE UH THE OFFICE ORGANISED BY UH BY BY RANK LIKE PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS AND
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA YEAH
YEAH
EVERYBODY AGREES ON THAT YEP
HOW ABOUT HOW ABOUT THIS ROOM
YEAH AT THE BOTTOM IN THE MIDDLE
WITH A VIEW TO THE MOUNTAINS YEAH
IT HAS THREE WINDOWS SO I THINK IT'S UH TWO
O ONE TWO
THE THE MIDDLE ONE
TWO
OH THE BIG OH
AH OKAY
ME TOO
YEAH AND YOU CAN LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW IF YOU HAVE A SH QUICK MEETING THERE
YOU KNOW QUICK MEETINGS ALWAYS GET LONGER
I DON'T KNOW
I WAS THINKING OF MAYBE WE SHOULD ASSIGN GISELLA INTO THIS THREE PERSON OFFICE
BECAUSE W WE WILL PROBABLY PLACE THE PRINTER NEXT TO THE MAILBOXES
THEN WE COULD HAVE GISELLA AND THE TWO FIFTY PER CENT PEOPLE SHARING THE THREE
PERSON ROOM
WELL TH
THEY'RE FIFTY PER CENT YEAH
WELL I MEAN IT
W YEAH WE COULD
WE COULD
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW NOISY SHE IS
IT'S UH
CONVENIENT FOR HER YEAH
OKAY
IT'S FINE WITH ME
YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT THE M
YEAH YEAH
Y
OKAY WE SHOULD WRITE THIS DOWN
DO WE AGREE THAT THE THAT THE PHOTOCOPIER AND THE NETWORKED PRINTER GOES NEXT TO THE MAILBOXES
YEAH
WHAT WITH
I MEAN SHE IS SHARING AN OFFICE RIGHT NOW AND I HAS ANYBODY HEARD OF ANY COMPLAINTS THAT SHE'S TOO LOUD OR
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
SHE NEEDS SPACES
OKAY
OKAY SO GISELLA AT THIS SOUTHWEST OFFICE
YEAH YEAH THAT THAT ONE YEAH
OH RIGHT YEAH THAT'S SOUTHEAST YEAH IT'S
YEAH THIS OFFICE YEAH
UH YEAH I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT UH HERE ON THE MAP
THE THREE PEOPLE ROOM OR
YOU GET LOTS OF SUN DURING SUMMER YES
PLUS SPARE YEAH
WE GOT
FOR FOURTEEN PEOPLE
YEAH
SO WE ARE GOOD
ALPHABETICALLY
IS IS ANY IS THERE ANYBODY WHO'S NOT HAPPY WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION SO WE COULD TRY TO JUST KEEP THE SAME ARRANGEMENT JUST ON THE NEW BUILDING
OKAY
SO LET'S START THEN TOP TO BOTTOM MAGGIE
SUSAN
SO HOW LONG IS
MM-HMM
UH DO WE KNOW IF THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING ACROSS THE HALL IN TERMS OF SECURITY STUFF IF WE CAN I MEAN MY IDEA IS TO PUT THE PHOTOCOPIER AND THE FAX IN THE HALL
UM
OKAY
MM
OKAY
OKAY
MM
MM YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND THAT'S IT
MM
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
MM YEAH
MM-HMM OKAY
ROOMS YEAH
AND DO WE NEED A ROOM LIKE A READING ROOM OR YEAH
MM
OKAY
YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM
THE FIRST SPLIT WE CAN DO IS BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND REASEARCH UH
I MEAN IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORK SO WE CAN DEAL WITH ADMINISTRATION AND DECIDE SOMETHING FOR ADMINISTRATION AND THEN
FOR THE OTHER
YEAH
BUT AT LEAST DEAL WITH THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION AND THEN SEE WITH THE OTHER
BECAUSE I WAS THINKING UH GISELLA IS QUITE I MEAN GILE GISELLA'S WORK IS QUITE NOISY BECAUSE IT'S SECRETARY SO
YEAH LOT OF PHONE CALL AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO YEAH
SO YOU WON'T SHARE AN OFFICE WITH GISELLA UNLESS YOU ARE FIFTY PER CENT AND NOT THE FIFTY PER CENT GISELLA IS WORKING WHICH IS ANOTHER CONDITION
YEAH MM
SO I DON'T KNOW MAYBE WE CAN DECIDE THAT GISELLA IS HAVING ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOM
MM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT AT LEAST THE THING WE KNOW THAT GISELLA IS GONNA BE ALONE
OR WITH EQUIPMENT BUT
HUMANLY ALONE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND THEN I THINK THE MAIN DISCUSSION WE SHOULD HAVE IS
UM IF WE WANT TO MAKE GROUP OF AMONG THE SAME PROJECT OR AMONG THE SAME TITLE
OR YEAH
OR YEAH
COUPLE OF PROFESSOR AND ASSISTANT OR
THAT'S MORE A CONCEPTUAL QUESTION THAN A PRACTICAL QUESTION
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM
MM YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT WE WILL HAVE THIS READING ROOM WHICH CAN BE
MM
YEAH FOR A REAL MEETING
MM
YEAH
MM
NO
YEAH
MM YEAH
MM YEAH
THE OTHER THING WE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IS IF YOU RECEIVE STUDENT OR NOT BECAUSE
MARIANNE AND I INTERACT A LOT WITH STUDENT AND WE HAVE RECEPTION HOURS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO IT MEANS YOU GET TIME WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE COME ALONG AND TALK AND SO IT'S MAYBE
YEAH SO MAYBE IT'S NOT REALLY NICE TO HAVE TO SHARE AN OFFICE WITH SOMEBODY LIKE US HAVING A LOT OF SOCIAL LIFE AND
YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
I DUNNO
YEAH MM MM
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN'T REASONABLY ASSUME LIKE THAT AND MAKE PLANS WITH THAT BECAUSE
YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
ONE POINT I CAN SAY BY EXPERIENCE IT'S REALLY HARD TO SHARE AN OFFICE WITH THREE PEOPLE
BECAUSE IT MAKES MUCH MORE NOISE THAT ONLY BEING TWO IN AN OFFICE
PLUS THE COMPUTERS
SO
YEAH
SO WE MIGHT BE IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO FIRST EXCLUDE ONE OF THE THREE PERSON ROOM TO BE THE READING ROOM AND NOT TO BE NECESSARY
A ROOM WITH THREE PEOPLE
A WORKING ROOM
OH YEAH
MM
OH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
SO THE OTHER SOLUTION IS TO SAY OKAY WE USE A THREE PERSON ROOM BUT ONLY WITH TWO PERSON EACH TIME
AND LEAVE A SPARE SPACE FOR OR
BUT AVOIDING
HAVING THREE PERSON FULL TIME IN A SAME ROOM COULD BE A GOOD IDEA I THINK
YEAH
MM
SO FOR THE READING ROOM WE WILL HAVE A TWO PERSON ROOM
OKAY
YEAH
WHICH ONE
WITH THE MOUNTAIN
YEAH IT'S
BIG BLACK STRIPE IS THE WINDOWS
NOT THE THIN ONE BETWEEN THE BIG BUT WHAT ABOUT THE D THE OTHER ONE WHICH HAS ONLY ONE WINDOWS BUT IN THE COURTYARD IT MAYBE MORE QUIET
WE HAVE ELECTRICITY SO
I HOPE
NO IT'S A QUESTION I MEAN IT IT'S QUITE NOISY OUTSIDE WITH THE STREETS AND
YEAH WE ARE ON THE SIXTH FLOOR
YEAH
AND STOP READING
SO IT'S A RELAXING ROOM
YEAH YEAH NO OKAY
YEAH YEAH
MM YEAH YEAH
MM
SO WHAT ABOUT ONE OF THE ROOM IN THE CORNER
SO YOU HAVE THREE WINDOWS
IT'S EVEN BETTER
BUT YOU HAVE LESS WALL TO PUT SHELVES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
IF YOU INTEND THE READING ROOM BEING MORE A LIBRARY OR
MM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
KIND OF YEAH SMALL LIBRARY
NO NO NO NO
NO NO SURE BUT YEAH
MM
SO ARE WE ALL AGREE ABOUT THESE TWO PERSON ROOMS
WHICH ONE
CORNER OR NOT CORNER
THE MIDDLE ONE
OKAY
YEAH
MM
OKAY
MM-HMM
SO WE CAN EXCLUDE THIS ONE TO MAKE AN OFFICE
OR MAYBE WRITE ON THE BOARD I DON'T KNOW
SO WE HAVE THE MAP AND
IT'S ALRIGHT
THREE YEAH
YEAH YEAH MM
SO
OKAY
IS THAT A MOUNTAIN
OKAY
AND THAT AN OLD TOWN
YEAH SHOULD WE DECIDE ALSO THE ADMINISTRATION STUFF
AND
SO WE EXCLUDE THE N THE THING WE ARE QUITE SURE AND THEN WE DISCUSS THE
THAT'S REALLY NOISY TO BE IN THE SAME OFFICE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION
YEAH THAT JUST IMPLY YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO COME WHEN GISELLA IS NOT WORKING AND THAT'S NOT REALLY FAIR IF YOU
SO WE CAN PUT GISELLA IN THE TWO PEOPLE ROOM
WHICH IS NEAR THE MAILBOX
NO
I DON'T KNOW
I IT'S JUST THE QUESTION YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE PHONE RINGING EVEN IF THE AF EVEN WHEN SHE'S NOT WORKING
YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD POINT FROM NIKOS TO SAY THAT SHE NEEDS TO BE N NEAR THE MAIL BOX AND THE PRINTER AND
AND THE PHOTOCOPIER AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YEAH
EXC EXCEPT THE DOOR IS NOT REALLY
CONVENIENT
NO BUT I THINK IF IF THE MAIN UM HOW CAN I PUT THAT THE MM
IF THE MAIN REASON TO PUT TO TO CHOOSE GISELLA'S PLACE
IS THE PROXIMITY OF THE MAILBOX IT SHOULD BE A TWO PE PEOPLE ROOM AND NOT A THREE PEOPLE ROOM
OTHERWISE WE HAVE A ONE PEOPLE ROOM AND
YEAH
YEAH
NO BUT IT'S IT'S ALSO IT'S ALSO THE PLACE OF THE PHOTOCOPIER
YEAH
BECAUSE IF WE PUT THE PHOTOCOPIER NEAR THE MAIL BOX AND IT SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR THAT
YEAH
YEAH OH NO
YEAH NO IT'S TOO
AND IT'S TOO BIG AND
YEAH
OKAY
AND THEN WE CAN FOR THE MOMENT PUT GISELLA IN THIS CORNER ROOM IF YOU AGREE I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
BUT THIS OPTION OF PUTTING GISELLA NEAR THE PHOTOCOPIER
I MEAN SHE IS NOT SHARING AN OFFICE
I MEAN SH WE PUT SOME TRAINEE IN GISELLA'S OFFICE BECAUSE THERE IS A SPARE ROOM AND THAT'S QUITE IMP YEAH
THAT'S QUITE UH I MEAN THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT TO KEEP A SPARE ROOM IN GISELLA'S OFFICE IF WE NEED MORE STAFF BUT
I WOULDN'T WORK IN GISELLA'S OFFICE
YEAH YEAH
MM YEAH
FOR EXAMPLE AND THERE IS NO ROOM IN THE CUPBOARDS FOR ANY PEOPLE EXCEPT GISELLA BECAUSE SHE GOT LOTS OF PAPER ARCHIVES AND FILES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO IT'S REALLY SHE NEEDS
SPACE
MM
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
ARE YOU SURE IT'S SOUTHWEST
I DUNNO IF THI IF THIS MAP IS A
OKAY THE MAP IS NORTH ORIENTED
OKAY
NO
OKAY
I DON'T KNOW
ANYWAYS YEAH BUT
OKAY
YOU KNOW BECAUSE WITH MOUNTAIN MOUNTAINS AND OLD TOWN IT'S NOT NO SORRY UNTIL BUT
OKAY
NO BECAUSE SUNRISE AND SUNSHINE IS QUITE UH SUNSHINE SUNRISE AND SUNSET IS QUITE ALSO A GOOD UM
SOMETHING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
UH NORTHEAST
SUNRISE
IT'S EAST YEAH EAST
NO EAST
WE WE HAVE SUN IN THE MORNING ONLY
SO IT DOES MEAN THAT THE THREE PIECE ROOM WHICH IS IN THE OPPOSITE OF THE NORTHEAST IS THE MOST SUNNY ONE
LET'S SAY THAT
IT'S IT'S THE ONE YOU HAVE OF NOW YOU BOTH
MORE OR LESS
YOU GET THE SUNSET THEN
NO
AND IT'S REALLY WARM AND
DO YOU UH BY THE WAY IS IT A SIX FLOOR BUILDING OR IS THERE MORE
OKAY
SO IT'S WARM
MM
OKAY
MM
SO HOW MANY ROOMS
AND UH HOW MANY PLACE DO WE HAVE
YEAH PLUS ONE SPARE PLACE BUT REALLY THE LAST PLACE TO BE USED
YEAH
OKAY
WE GOT TWO THREE FOUR SIX NINE
FOURTEEN PLACES
FOR FOURTEEN PEOPLE
YEAH
T OKAY
BLESS YOU
SO
CAN WE GROUP PEOPLE BY THEIR NAME
I TO MARIANNE
SO IT'S GONNA BE MARIANNES' OFFICE
YEAH THAT'S GOING THAT CAN BE
THAT'S BORING BUT THAT CAN BE A GOOD IDEA BUT DO DO WE CAN WE DO THAT
BECAUSE THERE IS NO WE CAN'T BECAUSE NO WE CAN'T THERE IS TWO
AND TWO THREE PERSON ROOM
YEAH
SO
MM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
I THINK WE CLEAR THE THINGS A LITTLE BIT UP TOO S YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
SO LET'S HAVE A BREAK
SAVE YOUR FILE
YOU HAVE X. P.

SUZANNE FOR EXAMPLE

IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY HARD TO PUT TWO PEOPLE INSIDE THAT ROOM
YEAH
YEAH
EXCEPT WE YEAH
AND NEAR THE PHOTOCOPIER
YEAH
AND WHAT ABOUT THE READING ROOM
YEAH BUT YOU I MEAN UH I THINK EVERYBODY IS SUPPOSED TO SPEND MORE TIME IN THEIR OFFICE THAN IN THE READING ROOM

OFFICIALLY

AND WE PUT MARIANNE IN FRONT IF SHE WANT TO BE

NANCY MARTIN PIRETTE
NO PIRETTE IS DONE
ANDREI YALINA MARIA AND AGNES
OKAY

YEAH
OKAY
AND WE HAVE UH
NOW
DO YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PUT MARTIN AND ANDREI TOGETHER SINCE THEY ARE WORKING ON THE SAME PROJECT
YEAH
AND WE MIGHT PUT MARTIN AND ANDREI AND SOMEONE ELSE IN THE THREE PERSON ROOM SINCE THE FIFTY PER CENT IT'S A GOOD
OKAY
MARIA AND NANCY
THAT'S REALLY STRANGE
SO WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT
MM-HMM MM YEAH
I THINK THIS PROJECT THING IS NOT GOOD THING
THIS PROJECT SPLITTING I MEAN
SPLITTING BY PROJECT
YEAH
NO BUT IF YOU IF IF YOU SPLIT BY PROJECT YOU PUT ME IN ONE PERSON ROOM
THAT'S HARD
COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
OKAY
OKAY
SO YOU JUST
YOU JUST MOVE HIM OR
THE TWO GROUPS
YOU JUST
YEAH
NO
EXCEPT COFFEE TIME AND THAT'S IMPORTANT PROJECT TOO BUT UH GOSSIPING AND STUFF LIKE THAT YES
MM
YEAH
AND IT'S QUITE FUNNY TO TO TO HEAR OTHER
ACTIVITIES AROUND YOU
AND NOT ALWAYS THE SAME STUFF
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S ACTIVITY THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND OR YEAH
YEAH
NO THAT'S QUITE NICE
OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH OKAY WHY NOT
I'M NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED
I'M NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THIS
I DUNNO
YEAH
FIRST OF ALL NO FROM THE BEGINNING I SAID THE THREE PERSON ROOM IT'S QUITE I MEAN IT'S A DISADVANTAGE
AND UM
TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT THIS DISADVANTAGE WE PUT SOMEBODY FIFTY PER CENT IN
THREE PERSON ROOM SO WE COULD DO THE SAME IN THE THREE PERSON ROOMS BUT THERE IS STILL THIS PROBLEM YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT'S HERE FOR WORKING
NOT NOT US BUT EXACTLY
AND YOU SO THERE IS NO VIEW
AND PIRETTE AS WELL
WE UH ALL HAVE UH RECEPTION HOURS
YEAH
YEAH
YOU CAN MOVE WITH YOUR DESKTOP YEAH
NO
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
OKAY CAN WE SAY THAT DAVID UH IS YEAH
INSTEAD OF
OKAY BUT OKAY
NO BECAUSE I WAS THINKING OF WE CAN UM
HAVING THESE TWO OFFICE WHICH ARE NEAR TO THE LIFT
KEEP THIS OFFICE FOR RECEPTION PEOPLE
IF I CAN CON WE ARE PIRETTE THE TWO MARIANNE AND I ARE RECEIVI AND MAGGIE AND SUSAN ARE RECEIVING A LOT OF STUDENT
SO WE
WITH THE FINNISH FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT ME
YEAH SO THAT'S KI YEAH YEAH OKAY
LOPETA
YEAH YEAH
UH THAT'S NICE TO HAVE A CORNER A STUDENT I MEAN A STUDENT AREA
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
YEAH TO FIND US AND IT'S ALSO QUITE NOISY WHEN YOU HAVE THIS KIND OF
PARADE OF STUDENT BEFORE THE EXAMS
SO IF YOU WORK WITH ME AND YOU HAVE THIS
AGREE WITH THAT
SO AND THE PHOTOCOPIER IS STILL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
NO BUT IT'S TOO FAR FROM
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
THAT'S QUITE GOOD
AND THEN YEAH
SO WE HAVE A THREE WINDOWS' ROOM
WITH VIEW EVERYWHERE
AHA
YEAH
WE CLOSE THE DOOR
YEAH AND
I THINK THAT'S QUITE NICE
AND THEN
AND PUT DAVID
IN A TWO PERSON OFFICE
AND WHY
NO NO THE REASON TO PUT PIRETTE AND MARIANNE MARIANNE AND I TOGETHER IS BECAUSE OF THE NOISE WE MAKE BY RECEIVING STUDENTS
AND THEN THE REASON TO PUT DAVID IN THIS OFFICE IT'S BECAUSE YEAH IT'S FIFTY PER CENT IN A THREE
UM
PLACE OFFICE
UM
THAT SOUNDS NICE NO
AND I THINK WE DO HAVE THE BEST OFFICE UH
IT'S A KIND OF DICTATORSHIP DECISION BUT WE ARE HERE TO MAKE A DECISION SO
AND AGNES YOU'RE GONNA SELL THIS TO THE ADMINISTRATOR
YEAH
SO
THE ARGUMENT OF STUDENT
YEAH
YOU CAN ALSO S OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IS
YEAH
YEAH BUT WE ALL WORK ON DIFFERENT PROJECTS SO WE CAN'T
WHAT IS THE LITTLE SQUARE D YOU PUT OH A PRINTER
AND THE PHOTOCOPIER
OKAY
THAT'S QUITE FINE
STUDENT RECEPTION
YOU
OKAY
NO YEAH THAT'S FINE
SO THE ARGUMENTS ARE UH STUDENT RECEPTION
IN ONE CORNER
YEAH
THE FIFTY PER CENT
STAFF
IN THE THREE
PERSON ROOM
YEAH
YEAH
AND UM THE TWO MM AND THE TWO PROFESSOR IS ONE SINGLE
YEAH
CENTRED
AND SINCE YOU NEE YOU WILL MEET THE ADMINISTRATOR CAN WE ASK FOR A COFFEE MACHINE SOMEWHERE
YEAH OR IN THAT HALL
I MEAN THE SIXTH FLOOR THERE IS NO COFFEE MACHINE ON THE SIXTH FLOOR
NO NO UM A VENDING MACHINE
YEAH BUT TRY
WI WITH GOOD COFFEE
ITALIAN ONE PLEASE
YEAH
AND HERB TEA
FOR THE AFTERNOON
H HERB TEA
FOR THE AFTERNOON YEAH
BECAUSE WITH STRONG COFFEE I DON'T T SLEEP
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
AND DO WE KNOW IF THERE WILL BE AIR CONDITIONING
NO NO NO THERE IS NO TERRACE ON THAT BUILDING
SO NO WE'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE THE PLAN ONLY FOR THE SMOKERS
EXACTLY
AS WELL
I THINK IT'S FINE
OKAY
IS EVERYONE HAPPY WITH THAT
MM
WOW
THAT'S VERY PROFESSIONAL YEAH
HMM
UH CAN
CAN WE THINK OF PUTTING A WHITE BOARD SOMEWHERE IN THE HALL
FOR GENERAL INFORMATION
YEAH
YEAH BUT I MEAN YOU HAVE A NICE POSTER OF THE NEXT CONFERENCE YOU DON'T PUT IT YOU KNOW A A BIG BOARD WITH
ALONG ONE OF THE WALL YEAH
YEAH
MM YEAH
OOH
I THINK IT'S EVERYBODY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND
IF THEY PREFER TO BE IN FRONT OF BACK TO WINDOW OR WHATEVER
I MEAN IF WE START DOING THAT NOT HAPPY
WE ARE ALL ADULTS SO I THINK WE CAN ALL SPEAK AND
UH OKAY
I HOPE YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO NOW THAT WE'VE ALL HAD A BIT OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT UM DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY CONCRETE PROPOSALS OR DO WE WANT TO JUST
GO THROUGH PEOPLE AND START PLACING THEM AND KIND OF DISCUSS AS WE GO ALONG
NOPE
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH GIVE THEM LIKE THE MOST COMFORTABLE OFFICES AND
YEAH
'CAUSE A PROFESSOR BUT HE'S ONLY HERE HALF TIME SO IT'S SORT OF A DIFFERENT SITUATION
AND HE'S A PROFESSOR AT BUT NOT IN GENEVA HE JUST DOES RESEARCH IN GENEVA
YEAH
OKAY SO LET'S
GO THROUGH THAT FIRST
UM
YEAH
AND FOR SUSAN PROBABLY YEAH 'CAUSE I THINK SHE PREFERS TO HAVE HER OWN OFFICE
UM
OKAY
ANY PREFERENCES TO WHICH ONE
'KAY
I PUT SUSAN HERE FOR NOW
AND THEN MAGGIE IN THE OTHER ONE
NO IT'S UP TO US
THEY'RE NOT HERE SO
UM OKAY
AND THEN
YEP
UM
WELL PIERRETTE HAS STUDENTS AND ANDREI AND DON'T
WELL DOES ANDREI
S HE TEACHES BUT OKAY
YEAH
'CAUSE ALSO IF WE'RE GONNA PUT PEOPLE TOGETHER BY PROJECTS THEN THERE'S NO SENSE TO PUT THEM TOGETHER 'CAUSE THEY ALL WORK ON DIFFERENT PROJECTS
RIGHT
MM
YEAH
'CAUSE THEY'LL FIGHT FOR THE WINDOW
WHAT ABOUT MOVING GISELLA IN THERE
IF SHE'S IN THERE HALF THE TIME SHE CAN HAVE HER DESK NEAR THE WINDOW AND OKAY SHE'S NOT NEAR THE MAILBOX BUT
BUT IT MAYBE MORE SORT OF PRACTICAL IN TERMS OF WORKING ENVIRONMENTS FOR PEOPLE
BUT AGAIN ONE OF THE REASONS FOR PUTTING THE READING ROOM WHERE IT IS IS SO THAT YOU HAVE
YOU THINK
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
OR WHAT IF YOU PUT
WHAT IF WE PUT THE TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE FIFTY PER CENT IN THAT ROOM
YEAH
BUT THEY ARE ONLY HERE FIFTY PER CENT
SO EVERYONE HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE
AND YOU ALSO HAVE ONE THREE PERSON ROOM WITH TWO WINDOWS
NIKOS VOLUNTEERS
WHO YOU'RE TAKING WITH YOU
OKAY
WELL 'KAY SO LET'S PUT DAVID IN THERE YEAH
YOU'LL MEET HIM
OKAY
SO I'M JUST GONNA
MAKE A LIST ON HERE OF WHO WE HAVE
KEEP TALKING
WITH PIERRETTE
OKAY SO DAVID NIKOS GISELLA MAGGIE AND SUSAN ARE DONE
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
SHOULD WE BE NICE AND GIVE THEM THREE WINDOWS
OKAY
THAT WON'T GET CONFUSING
WHERE
HERE
OH HERE
WOULD HAVE TO BE HERE OR THE OTHER THREE PERSON ROOM
PICK A ROOM
WELL SHE'S NOT THAT FAR IF SHE'S LIKE LIKE IN THIS ONE HERE
'KAY SO YOU WANT THIS ONE
OKAY
YALINA
YEAH
THAT COULD WORK
IN ROOM YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM
I GUESS I CAN GO IN THERE 'CAUSE MARTIN AND I WOR ARE WORKING ON THE SORT OF THE SAME THING
AND THAT LEAVES
AND NANCY
YEAH THAT'S A WEIRD COMBINATION
NO IT'S NOT THAT
IT'S JUST YOU'VE ALMOST GOT LIKE A PROJECT SPLIT
EXCEPT THAT YOU DON'T BECAUSE
NANCY AND MAGGIE AND I WORK ON PREMINDIA PARMENIDY PARMENIDIES
AND THEN ANDREI MARTIN MARIA AND I ALSO WORK ON
AND SORT OF SUSAN
ALTHOUGH THE SUSAN AND MAGGIE THING WE CAN'T REALLY CHANGE
NO
BUT THEN WE SHOULD SPLIT THE LITTLE PARTY UP
ALL ON YOUR OWN
HMM
SEE I WOULD PUT IT THE OTHER WAY
I WOULD PUT THE ROOM WITH MARTIN IN IT IN THE TWO WINDOW ROOM 'CAUSE HE'S FIFTY PER CENT SO THEN AT LEAST
THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE GET
PUT MARTIN IN THE THREE PERSON ROOM WITH TWO WINDOWS
SINCE HE'S FIFTY PER CENT
EITHER WAY
WELL I DON'T KNOW FOR SPLITTING UP
PEOPLE OR
WELL I'M TRYING TO OPTIMISE
I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY SO IMPORTANT TO BE IN THE SAME OFFICE WITH SOMEONE
IF YOU'RE WORKING ON THE SAME PROJECT
'CAUSE YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO GET UP AND WALK NEXT DOOR
I DON'T KNOW LIKE RIGHT NOW I SHARE AN OFFICE WITH BRUNO
WE DON'T WORK ON ANY PROJECTS TOGETHER
YEAH
OF COURSE
BUT I MEAN THAT'S FINE
LIKE I DON'T NEED TO BE IN THE SAME OFFICE WITH SOMEONE WHO WORKS ON OR
SOMEONE WHO WORKS ON PARMENIDIES
IT'S NOT LIKE YEAH
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YEAH
YOU HEAR THINGS OUT OF CONTEXT
WHAT
OKAY
I JUST CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM SHARING AN OFFICE I DON'T KNOW WHY
OR WE PUT ANDREI AND NANCY TO NANCY TOGETHER 'CAUSE THEY'RE STARTING THAT NEW
PROJECT
AND THEN PUT MARIA WITH
ME AND MARTHA
I CAN SEE THAT WORKING A BIT BETTER
HMM
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING YOU DIDN'T WANNA BE IN A THREE PERSON ROOM
FIRST OF ALL
YEAH
AND PUT DAVID BUT THEN YOU AND NIKOS HAVE THE WINDOW PROBLEM WHICH IS WHY I STILL THINK WE SHOULD PUT GISELLA IN THAT ROOM BECAUSE
IT'S
SHE GETS THE WINDOW THE WHATEVER HE'S THERE FOR TWO MONTHS IT'S THEIR PROBLEM
YEAH
NOT FOR ENJOYING THE VIEW
SO
YEAH BUT IF YOU PUT
SO WHAT IF WE
SWITCH NO
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COMPUTER WITH WIRELESS
NO
WELL MOST OF US FIRST OF ALL HAVE DESKTOP COMPUTERS
PICK UP YOUR DESKTOP AND PLUS YOU CAN'T ASSUME THAT YOU CAN JUST USE THE READING ROOM FOR RECEPTION HOURS
RIGHT
LIKE IF PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY USING IT AS A READING ROOM
YEAH
CAN WE SAY WE'RE GONNA MOVE GISELLA HERE
AND THEN
I THINK THAT GIVES US A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO PLAY WITH MOVING PEOPLE AROUND
GOES HERE
YOU WERE THE FIRST ONE ON THE LIST BUT IF YOU WANNA REMOVE SOMEONE ELSE
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO WHAT IF WE PUT YOU WITH YEAH
WILL YOU HAVE
OKAY SO
I'M JUST PUTTING YALINA IN SO WE DON'T
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OR DO YOU WANNA GO SOMEWHERE ELSE
HERE
YOU JUST DON'T PHOTOCOPY
WELL YOU HAVE THE OTHER
LIFT
THE SWITCH
WITH HERE
SO LIKE THAT AND THEN MOVE YOU TO
THAT'S WHAT THE PLAN WAS
FROM THE BEGINNING
DO YOU GET THE PHOTOCOPYING NOISE
NOW WE ARE ALL GONNA COME PHOTOCOPY JUST TO ANNOY YOU
OKAY
OR DID WAS THE ID
I SHOULD START START MAKING FULL SENTENCES
WHAT ABOUT
I WAS THINKING ABOUT MOVING PIERRETTE AND MARIANNE INTO A TWO PERSON OFFICE RATHER THAN A THREE PERSON OFFICE
BUT
WITH ANDREI AND NANCY FOR EXAMPLE
NO IN A THREE PERSON OFFICE
BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE RECEPTION
I KNOW I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING THAT
PIERRETTE SHOULD HAVE A SMALLER OFFICE
OR BE IN A SMALLER OFFICE BECAUSE OF RECEPTION OR SOMETHING OR DID I JUST COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTAND
OKAY
IS BECAUSE HE'S FIFTY PER CENT OKAY
OKAY THAT WORKS
MM-HMM
I'M GOING TO TRY
YES
'KAY WHAT ARGUMENTS DO I NEED
WELL WE HAVE THE THE GROUP AND STUDENTS HERE
ALTHOUGH YOU STILL HAVE SUSAN AND MAGGIE OVER HERE
YEAH
SO IT IS SORT OF A WELL NO IT'S NOT A PROJECT SPLIT
IT'S WEIRD 'CAUSE IT KIND OF IS AND KIND OF ISN'T
BECAUSE MARIA AND MARTIN AND I WORK ALL WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT AND THEN ANDREI AND NANCY WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT AND PIERRETTE N YEAH
AND YEAH
OKAY LET ME JUST WRITE DOWN THE ARGUMENTS FOR WHY UM
MM-HMM
YOU JUST WANT A BIGGER WINDOW
HAPPY
THAT'S NOISE REDUCTION
OKAY
NOW THEY ARE YEAH
EXCEPT FOR DAVID BUT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
YOU MEAN LIKE
A LITTLE MACHINE OR A VENDING MACHINE
'KAY
THE LITTLE MACHINE I THINK WOULD BE HARDER TO SELL BUT
I WILL
NESPRESSO
WITH THE GOOD STRONG COFFEE
WHAT DID YOU SAY HOT TEA
OH HERB TEA
NOPE
NON SMOKING BUILDING
NO THEY'LL HAVE TO GO DOWN
AND SUSAN MAGGIE CLOSE ENOUGH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH I THINK SO
JUST CHECKING IF ACTUALLY HAVE EVERYONE BUT I THINK WE DO
IN WAS IT WHAT DID I SAY THREE WEEKS
AS FAR AS I KNOW YEAH
AS FAR AS I KNOW BASICALLY WE PACK UP ONE DAY THE MOVERS COME TAKE ALL OUR STUFF PUT INTO THE RED BOXES
SO WHEN YOU GET THERE THE NEXT DAY ALL YOUR STUFF IS ALREADY IN YOUR OFFICE
AND ALL THE I. P. S AND EVERYTHING IS SET UP
THEY'RE TRYING
SO WE'LL SEE
MAKE SURE YOU LABEL YOUR BOXES PROPERLY
UM ESPECIALLY THE MARIANNE'S
YEAH SO THEY WON'T CONFUSE IT GET CONFUSED WITH THE OTHER MARIANNE'S BOXES
UH WE CAN TRY
I CAN ASK THEM
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY
UM WHERE
LIKE ALONG GISELLA'S
OKAY SO
ALONG THAT BOTTOM HALLWAY SOMEWHERE
OKAY
ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO ASK THEM
'KAY
I DON'T ACTUALLY WE MAY NEED TO SORT OUT
THAT'S NOT HEALTHY
UM WHO
I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED TO SORT OUT WHO SITS WHERE 'CAUSE IF THEY'RE GONNA PLUG EVERYTHING AND SET EVERYTHING UP
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH NO NO
YEAH
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA SET EVERYTHING UP FOR US OR NOT BUT WE CAN CHANGE IT I GUESS
OKAY
THAT'S IT THEN
SAVE THIS
YEP
NOT RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE I'M NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET
BUT I WILL
OKAY
GOOD WE'RE DONE THEN
I DON'T THINK THEY ARE CONCRETE PROPOSALS
NO
YEAH THIS MAKES SENSE
YEAH
IT'S UP TO THEM I GUESS UH
UP TO US
WELL I MEAN THEY THEY CAN SWITCH LATER
THEY CAN SWITCH LATER
PIRETTE NEXT
SO I DON'T KNOW WE SPENT QUITE SOME TIME AT THE LAST MEETING AND T TO DECIDE THIS AND NOW WE ARE JUST
OF COURSE BUT EVERYBODY HAD THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE SO YOU COULD HAVE STUDIED THEM
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH M
W I I I DON'T MIND GOING INTO THIS OFFICE
NO
OH WHY NOT
YEAH
NO
MAYBE WE CAN PUT PIERRETTE AND HER T TWO TWO P. H. D. STUDENTS INTO ONE ROOM
UM YEAH MAYB MAYBE THE OTHER ONE WOULD BE MORE CONVENIENT IF WE ARE ALL WORKING ON THE SAME PROJECT
SO WE ARE CLOSE BY
AGNES
YEAH
WHY
OKAY W W WHY DON'T WE MOVE MARIA TO THIS TO WHERE TO THE OFFICE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AND I CAN GO WITH NANCY
IF YOU THINK THAT
BUT IS THIS ABOUT WINDOWS OR IS IT ABOUT IT IT IT MUST BE FUNCTIONAL
IF YOU AND MARTIN WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT THEN
YEAH WE CAN EACH OTHER YEAH
I AGREE BUT THE SETUP IS PRETTY GOOD NOW
SO BRUNO IS NOT ON AND HE'S SHARING UM OFFICE
UH I'M NOT SHARING SOMEBODY WITH I WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT
UH UM YEAH
MARTIN AND YOU YEAH
YEAH WHAT IS IT NOW
BU S SOMEBODY HAS TO BE
WELL WILL THERE BE WIRELESS IN THE BUILDING
I MEAN IF THERE ARE RECEPTION HOURS SO SOMEBODY COULD MOVE TO THE READING ROOM AND HAVE PEOPLE
WELL ISN'T THIS THE CASE
DOESN'T EVERYBODY HAS ONE
NO
MM
NO
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT
UM
YEAH WHO DOES ANYWAY
SO MAYBE YOU AND BRUNO SHOULD TAKE THIS OFFICE
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
AND IT'S NOT VERY HEALTHY EITHER YEAH
MM
SUGGESTION IF POSSIBLE WE COULD MOVE ME AND YALINA TO THE OFFICE WHERE ANDREI AND NANCY ARE NOW
NO I I JUST IT'S JUST MORE CONVENIENT IF I'M CLOSER WITH MY
THE PARTNERS OF MY PROJECT
SHE'S THE HEART OF THE
IT'S NOT KITCHEN
WELL IT'S IT'S IDEAL FOR NANCY SHE IS JUST VERY CLOSE TO THE LIFTS
EXCELLENT YEAH
SO WHEN EXACTLY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO MOVE
THREE WEEKS
SO THEY'VE SET UP EVERYTHING WIRING UH INTERNET OR WHAT'S THE STA THE STATUS RIGHT NOW
S
WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF WALLS WE CAN PUT POSTERS ON
YEAH WE DON'T WANT TO MICRO MANAGE THINGS YEAH
CAN YOU MAIL A COPY OF THAT TO EVERYBODY
AND DON'T FORGET THE
I HAVE A COPY
YEAH
TWO
SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN
DO WE REALLY NEED THAT
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
AND IF WE DON'T GET THIS SPACE THEN WHAT HAPPENS
THESE YEAH
OKAY
YEAH WHY DIDN'T WE HAVE A MEETING TOGETHER
WELL CERTAINLY WE HAVE TO ASK UH PIERRETTE AND UH AND MAGGIE SINCE THEY'RE NOT HERE
BECAUSE THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO SEE AS WE DO AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER CONSIDERATION TOO
OH GREAT
YE MM BEFORE UM TALKING MORE ABOUT INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE UH FACULTY OF LAW FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY ACTUALLY SPLIT ROOMS
AND SO WE WOULD TAKE UH UH ONE OF THE TWO PEOPLE ROOMS AND SPLIT IT
AND YOU WOULD SEE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE SAME SIZE OFFICE BUT THAT WOULD GIVE THE PRIVACY
UM INSOFAR AS IN JUST ABOUT EVERY OTHER FACULTY IN THE BUILDING EVERY PROFESSOR HAS THEIR OWN OFFICE
AND IT'S IT'S REALLY IT GOES A BIT FAR THAT UH WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS UH ALL THIS SHARING UH
SO ONE OPTION AND THAT BUT THAT WE WOULD NEED TO ASK ABOUT IF WE COULD UH SPLIT ONE OF THE ROOMS UH
THAT DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE IT UH
I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S REALLY A DIFFERENCE TO HAVING TO HAVE YOUR OWN YEAH
AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE UH YOU NEED TO HAVE PRIVATE UH DISCUSSIONS WITH SOMEBODY OR WHATEVER SO
WELL I I THINK IT'S UH REALLY A MATTER OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE
AS YOU KNOW UM I PREFER TO HAVE UH MY OWN OFFICE
UM I ALSO HAVE UH A LOT OF PHONE CALLS AND Y YOU KNOW HAVE TO SEE PEOPLE
AND WITH THE OTHER WORK THAT I'M DOING WITH THE RECTORATE UH THAT IS REALLY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT I'M TREATING
SO I THAT I HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT TOO
BUT IT'S A PERSONAL PREFERENCE UH
INSOFAR AS WHAT WE'VE HAD UP UNTIL NOW BOTH MAGGIE AND PIERRETTE HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO SHARE WITH OTHERS
SO I MEAN I THINK THAT WE SHOULD STILL CHECK WITH THEM
WELL NOT SHARING WITH EACH OTHER
THEY EACH SHARE WITH AN ASSISTANT
YEAH
PAID ON THAT
MM-HMM
YEAH AND ALSO SOME OF OUR THE PEOPLE MENTIONED HERE ARE WORKING ON MORE THAN ONE PROJECT TOO
SO
FOR EXAMPLE UH MARIANNE DE UH SHE'S ALSO WORKING WITH ME ON THE VIRTUAL CAMPUS PROJECT SO SHE THAT ONE WASN'T MENTIONED
BUT I'M NOT SAYING THAT I NECESSARILY WANT TO BE WITH HER IN THE OFFICE
BUT UH IT'S JUST TO SAY PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON UH SOMETIMES MORE THAN ONE PROJECT UH
YEP
WELL YEAH WE'LL SKIP THAT FOR NOW
NO I D UM THE LOUNGE OKAY
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO SEE IT AS A OVERFLOW PLACE WHEN WE HAVE UM UH VISITORS FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A PLACE TO WORK
NO YOU WANT TO HAVE VISITORS
YEAH
YEAH
YES BUT WE HAVE MORE SPACE HERE THAN WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE SO IT'S AT LEAST SOME
MM-HMM
NO
NO BECAUSE THEY CAN SHARE THEIR IDEAS ACROSS THE PROJECT YEAH I WOULD SAY
NO AND IF YOU LOOK NOW AT THEIR UH THE THE CURRENT DIVISION OF THE OFFICES FOR EXAMPLE
UH BRUNO AND AGNES ARE SHARING AN OFFICE AND THEY'RE WORKING ON TOTALLY DIFFERENT PROJECTS AND AND THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST FINE WITH THAT
WELL THERE THERE WERE BUT THEY SORT OF DISAPPEARED AS OF OCTOBER WHEN THE NO SMOKING RULE CAME IN
BECAUSE BEFORE WE WERE GROUPING THE SMOKERS AND NOW THAT THERE'S NO SMOKING UH I GUESS THAT'S NOT VERY IMPORTANT OPTION THOUGH
WELL EXCEPT FOR THAT MAYBE YOU DON'T EVEN WANT ANYBODY SMOKING ON YOUR BALCONY SO
NO
NO N IT'S IN IN PRINCIPLE IT'S A IT'S A NO SMOKING BUILDING
YOU CAN SMOKE OUTSIDE
SO YOU CAN GO OUTSIDE ONTO THE BALCONY TO SMOKE
NOT EVEN IN THE CAFETERIA
NO
FULL NO SMOKING BUILDING FOR ALL OF THE SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS
YEAH
YEP
THERE IS THE THERE'S THAT TERRACE
NO
THE OTHER WAY
NO WE WE DO HAVE ONE CONSTRAINT THAT'S DIFFICULT WHICH IS UH GISELLA BECAUSE WHEN SHE'S THERE SHE'S VERY NOISY
SHE'S ON THE PHONE A LOT IT'S JUST IT'S BY YEAH
IT'S BY NAT UH BY THE NATURE OF HER WORK THAT UH A LOT OF IT IS COMMUNICATION
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S A EXCELLENT IDEA
WHY DON'T WE ASK ABOUT THAT
I MEAN THERE IS CERTAINLY ENOUGH SPACE UH DOWN THE HALL
WI IF ALL OF THOSE UH UH OFFICES THAT ARE WHERE HALF OF THEM ARE ALSO HALF TIME AND THEY'RE VERY UNDER USED
SO UM
AND PIERRETTE TOO
YEAH WITH WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE YEAH
NO
SO WE WE INVITE INVITE AND THEN WE SAY OKAY YOU CAN SIT WITH GISELLA
UM
EXCEPT FOR IN EVERY OTHER FACULTY
YES IT IS SO
EVERY OTHER FACULTY AS FAR AS I HAVE SEEN THEIR OFFICES AND THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW AND THAT'S IN UM IN LAW
UH SOCIO ECONOMICS UH OKAY
IT'S A THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN OFFICE
I MEAN IN IN THE IN THE LAW FACULTY THEY'RE AT BEST THERE HALF TIME
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
OKAY I'LL ASK UM UH MAGGIE AND PIERRETTE UH IF THEY HAVE UH ANY PREFERENCES
YEAH
NO
YEAH SINCE THEY'RE NOT AT THE MEETING I THINK IT'S IN OUT OF COURTESY WE SHOULD FIRST ASK THEM
HE MEANS READING ROOM
NO
COFFEE MACHINES
NO THERE'S THE CAFETERIA IS DOWNSTAIRS BUT THEY CLOSE AT FIVE
YEAH BUT THERE'S THE TWO MACHINES AND THEY'RE UH THE VENDING MACHINES WHERE YOU JUST PUT THE MONEY AND AND YOU CAN GET YEAH
YEAH
WAIT
WAIT WAIT
TUESDAY UM
UM WE HAVE THE DON'T FORGET WE HAVE THE OTHER MEETING THE M. D. M. MEETING IN THE MORNING SO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IN THE AFTERNOON
YEAH
EXACTLY
AT NINE THIRTY BUT WE COULD DO WE COULD HAVE THIS MEETING THEN IN THE AFTERNOON
NAH
YEP
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
UM SO HI EVERYONE
THANKS FOR COMING TO THIS MEETING
UM WELL AS YOU ALL KNOW THE TOPIC OF THIS MORNING'S MEETING IS UH THE FACT THAT WE'RE MOVING AND WE ARE GOING TO GET MORE SPACE
SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD PIECE OF NEWS
UH BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW WE USE THIS SPACE
SO UM IF YOU WANT I'LL JUST GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THEN WE CAN UH TALK ABOUT
WELL ARRANGING THESE NEW UH THE NEW OFFICE SPACE
SO UM IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE THE DOCUMENTS UH LET ME JUST UH SHOW YOU VERY BRIEFLY THE THE CONFIGURATION OF THE THE SPACE
SO UM WELL THERE IS NOTHING MUCH TO SAY
WELL YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF US ARE ARE PRESENT AND YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE UM A BIT TIGHT ACTUALLY IN OUR PRESENT LOCATION
UH THAT'S WHY ACTUALLY THE UNIVERSITY FINALLY UM ALLOCATED US THIS UH THIS PART OF UH THE UNIMAIL BUILDING
SO IT'S AT THE SIXTH FLOOR
AND IT'S UH SORT OF CONTIGUOUS ROOMS AS YOU YOU CAN ALL SEE FROM UH FROM HERE
UM SO THE THE THE ONE P. TWO P. THREE P. MEANS THE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS
AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE SEVERAL CORRIDOR UM WITH A NUMBER OF UH OF UH OF ROOMS
OF ONE PERSON ROOMS TWO PERSON ROOM AND AND THREE PERSON ROOMS
UM ACTUALLY I THINK AGNES DID THIS NICE DRAWING SO SHE EVEN PUT THE THE VIEW
SO WE HAVE THE OLD TOWN ON ONE SIDE AND THE MOUNTAINS ON THE OTHER TWO SIDES
UH WE HAVE SOME BATHROOMS FOR US
UH AND A COURTYARD WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS A SORT OF UH SHAFT BECAUSE UH THE COURT IS UH DOWN AT UH THE FIRST FLOOR
WELL IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT TO SAY BECAUSE UM IN FACT WE HAVE SOME CONSTRAINTS IN TERMS OF FURNITURE
UH THEY ARE HERE
SO UM WELL YOUR YOUR PERSON YOUR YOUR QUESTION ACTUALLY IS ANSWERED MAYBE BY THE THIRD ITEM
SO EACH PERSON SHOULD GET UM WELL IT'S A SORT OF DESK IT'S MADE OF TWO PIECES AND IT LOOKS LIKE A CORNER
WITH OF COURSE A CHAIR
UH A FILING CABINET THAT GOES UNDER THE DESK UH AND WELL WE CAN PUT HANGING SHELVES OVER THE THE DESKS
SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET THREE UM THREE DESKS IN A TWO PERSON OFFICE
BUT UM WE COULD TRY
WHAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE SAID HERE I DON'T KNOW IF WELL YOU I I WILL MAYBE DISTRIBUTE NOW DOCUMENTS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM
MAYBE IT'S EASIER
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING MARTIN
UM I CAN KEEP THIS FOR YOU
UH SO IT'S IT'S YEAH YOU HAVE A COPY SUSAN
YOU TOO DAVID I THINK
SO IN FACT THERE ARE MORE PLACES THAN PEOPLE SO WE WON'T BE THAT CONSTRAINED
UH AS YOU KNOW SOME OF US AND SOME OF YOU HERE ACTUALLY MARTIN AND DAVID ARE PART TIME
SO IT IT'S FOR THE MOMENT QUITE COMFORTABLE
NORMALLY WE SHOULD EVEN GET AN EXTRA UH AN EXTRA PLACE FOR YOU KNOW TEMPORARY PEOPLE COMING TO WORK ON UH ON PROJECTS
UH YEAH I UH YEAH I COUNTED SO WE HAVE UM FIFTEEN PERS PHYSICAL PERSONS AND ABOUT UH SIXTEEN
I THINK UH PERSONS OH ACTUALLY EIGHTEEN PERSONS IN THE OFFICES
EXACTLY IT SO ONE OF THE ISSUES UH HERE IT'S PROBABLY NOT ON THE SLIDES IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE UH
UNLIKE WHAT HAD UNTIL NOW A LOUNGE OR READING ROOM UH IN ONE OF THE THE OFFICES
SO IN ONE OF THE ROOMS
UM I THINK QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE E EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR THAT
SO IF WE COULD DO IT THEN I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH NICER
UM LET ME ALSO UH ST SAY SOMETHING YEP
YEAH I I THINK SO
MM-HMM
WELL SIXTEEN SLOTS FOR FIFTEEN PEOPLE
SO IT'S STILL SHOULD BE FEASIBLE
THAT'S
YEAH I THINK THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT TO MANAGE SOME SPACE
MAYBE WE CAN THINK OF YEAH SOME TWO OR THREE YEAH FOR VISITING PEOPLE
CORRECT
MM-HMM
OKAY SO LET ME FINISH WITH THE THE CONSTRAINTS WHICH ARE ALMOST DONE
SO WE ALSO NEED TO TO FIND THE A SPOT FOR THE PHOTOCOPIER THE FAX MACHINE AND THE PRINTER
THE FAX YOU KNOW IS VERY SMALL BUT UM THE PHOTOCOPIER IS QUITE HUGE AND THE PRINTER IS UH WELL AB THIS SIZE
UM OKAY THE OFFICES COMES WITH WHITE BOARDS
NOT VERY UH VERY IMPORTANT
UH THE FURNITURE THAT W EACH EACH PERSON HAS AND UH YOU HAVE A LIST OF PEOPLE
SO THE THING UH YOU YOU OUGHT TO KNOW IS THAT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT W WE'RE THIN THAT THAT ARE THINKING ABOUT UH FOR WELL
ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE I IN THESE ROOMS
UM THERE IS ANOTHER GROUP THAT IS ALSO HAVING DISCUSSIONS
SO THE IDEA IS THAT TODAY WE'LL JUST TRY TO F START SEEING THE MAIN CONSTRAINTS AND THEN YOU HAVE TIME TO TO GO AND THINK ABOUT IT UH ASK THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW
YOUR ASSISTANTS FOR INSTANCE AND AT THE NEXT MEETING WE'LL TRY TO TO COME WITH ONE SOLUTION
UH THE OTHER GROUP WILL ALSO PROPOSE A SOLUTION AND THEN THERE WILL BE ANOTHER NEGOTIATION
SO W
UH IF I IF WE DON'T GET THESE
UM WELL BASICALLY THEY ARE PROMISED TO US SO UH DO DO YOU THINK THERE ARE CHANCES THAT THEY TAKE FROM US ONE OF THE ROOMS OR UH
YEAH I I I THINK IT'S UH UH YEAH
YEAH I YEAH THAT'S ONE OF THE THE PROBLEMS
I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND MAYBE THINK OF SOME OF THE BIGGER ROOMS WITH FOUR PEOPLE ONE BEING TEMPORARY OR OR PART TIME
UM OKAY SO MAYBE WE COULD TRY TO TO SEE NOW WHAT WOULD BE THE MAIN OPTIONS
SAY THE GENERAL UH WELL ARRANGEMENT OPTIONS
DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD PUT PEOPLE SAY ACCORDING TO PROJECTS FOR INSTANCE
IN IN THE TABLE THAT UM THAT WE HAVE UH WE ALSO HAVE THE UH UH THE P THE MAIN PROJECTS ON WHICH THE PEOPLE ARE WORKING
SO HOW YEAH
MM-HMM
OH ACTUALLY WHAT IS FIXED IS THE N THE NUMBER OF ROOMS
THIS WE CANNOT REALLY CHANGE
I MEAN AT LEAST NOT US IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO GET ANOTHER ANOTHER ROOM FOR INSTANCE
BUT WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY N NOT FIXED IS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOMS
SO BASICALLY WE ARE ALL THE PERMUTATIONS ARE POSSIBLE AT THE MOMENT
UM
WELL WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS A SOLUTION THAT SUITS EVERYONE AND THAT MAKES THE MAXIMUM OF PEOPLE HAPPY
SO UH THE OTHER GROUP IS UH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO SEE THEM AS COMPETITORS BUT THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO TO FIND ANOTHER LOCAL OPTIMUM
OR L UH
UH
YEAH
YEAH UH UH WE YEAH
I I THINK THAT'S YEAH THERE IS NO REAL COMPETITION BETWEEN THE TWO
BUT WE'LL JUST TRY TO FIND AT LEAST TWO SOLUTIONS AND SEE HOW HOW CLOSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY
IT'S IT'S I THINK WELL THE M THE PEOPLE WHO WHO DECIDED THIS THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST SOLUTION TO
MM WELL YOU KNOW FIND TWO TWO KINDS OF OPINIONS
YEAH
WELL WE COULD HAVE BEEN EIGHT H SITTING AROUND HERE AND AND TALKING BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S MORE DIFFICULT
MM-HMM
WELL
EXACTLY I THINK SO SO TODAY THE GOAL IS NOT TO TO FIND THE SOLUTION TODAY
BUT TO SET SOME CONSTRAINTS AND THEN GO AND SEE THE PEOPLE AND FIND OUT IF THEY HAVE ANY PREFERENCES
OBVIOUSLY WE WON'T BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THE THE PREFERENCES BUT AT LEAST WE'LL FIND THE MOST UH THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES
P S I THINK
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE STUDENTS
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY IF THEY PREFER FOR INSTANCE TO BE ALONE
OR TO WELL TO BE WITH THEIR ASSISTANT OR EVEN WITH ANOTHER PERSON WORKING ON THE PROJECT
SO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MAYBE YEAH ANOTHER SOLUTION IS TO ASK EVERYONE TO PROVIDE UH AN ARRANGEMENT
BUT UH I THINK THAT'S A BIT UH A BIT HARD THEN TO TO WORK OUT
UM SO SINCE ALL OF YOU HAVE A COPY OF THE UH WELL OF THE DRAWING I THINK FOR THE NEXT TIME
M MAYBE YOU COULD COME WITH A CONCRETE PROPOSAL WITH UH NAMES ON IT
BUT LET US TRY TO SEE TODAY WHETHER WE PREFER TO ORGANISE PEOPLE SAY BY PROJECTS OR JUST PROFESSOR AND ASSISTANT
SO WHAT WOULD BE F SAY FIRST YOUR PREFERENCES SINCE LET'S LET'S START WITH US MAYBE TODAY
UM WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT
WOULD YOU PREFER TO BE ALONE WOULD YOU PREFER TO BE WITH YOUR ASSISTANT
YOU WHO ARE PART TIME DO YOU THINK YOU CAN COME HERE ON A VERY W WELL REGULAR SCHEDULE OR IS IT PART TIME BUT VARIABLE DURING THE WEEK
UH-HUH
AND SINCE YOU'RE COMING ON THE UH HALF TIME
DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GROUP YOUR PRESENCE HERE SAY MONDAY
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY MORNING OR IS IT GOING TO BE M MUCH MORE RANDOM
OKAY
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
UM SO MARTIN YOU ARE ALSO UH HALF TIME AND WELL THE THIRD PERSON IS GISELLA
I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT MM EACH PERSON SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN DESK AND YEAH
IT'S NO NO WAY WE WE COULD PUT TWO PERSONS AT THE SAME DESK
YEAH I THINK GROUPING
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
ARE YOU DISTURBED BY THE PHONE CALLS OF OTHER PEOPLE
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
LIKE CUBICLES
MM-HMM
YEAH I I I WILL TRY TO FIND OUT WHETHER WE CAN SEPARATE
I THINK FOR THE MOMENT THE ANSWER AT LEAST IS NO BECAUSE UM IT'S NOT ONLY
WELL MAKING A WALL BUT ALSO B MM MAKING A NEW DOOR
SO IT'S QUITE A LOT OF UH OF WORK BUT UH I WILL TRY TO FIND THIS OUT FOR THE NEXT TIME
UM SO AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE UH I CAN SHOW THEM HERE ON THE SCREEN
SO THERE ARE THESE TWO ROOMS ON THE LEFT THAT UH ACCOMMODATE ONE PERSON
SO AT LEAST SOME OF THE PROFESSORS SINCE YOU ARE FOUR UH COULD COULD GO UH WELL COULD TAKE THESE UH THESE ROOMS
AND QUITE A LOT OF ROOMS WITH TWO PERSONS
UH HOW DO YOU FEEL SUSAN ABOUT THE PROFESSOR SHARING THE ROOM WITH HER ASSISTANTS OR THE ONE WHICH IS THE MOST INVOLVED IN IN THE TEACHING
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S UM THAT'S TRUE
UM OKAY
UM MAYBE WE COULD S LOOK A BIT AT THE PROJECTS
DO YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PUT TOGETHER IN THE SAME ROOM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE PEOPLE FROM THE SAME PROJECT
SINCE THEY TALK QUITE A LOT OF TO EACH OTHER
MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL YEAH AND SOME OF THE P. H. D. STUDENTS WILL HOPEFULLY FINISH THEIR P. H. D. AT SOME POINT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
OKAY YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL ACTUALLY SO THE LOUNGE COULD SERVE AS SOME KIND OF MEETING ROOM
BUT THERE ARE ALSO MORE FORMAL MEETING ROOMS AVAILABLE IN IN THE BUILDING AS WE NOW KNOW
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO I THINK WE NEED A
YEAH AND AND I THINK ALSO WE NEED A SEPARATE DISCUSSION ON THE FURNISHING OF THE LOUNGE WHICH IS A WHOLE OTHER TOPIC
UH-HUH
UM
YEAH YEAH FOR THE MOMENT ACTUALLY I THINK ONLY ONE SLOT WOULD BE FULLY FREE
UH THAT IS YEAH
YEAH THAT MEANS ONE VISITOR AT A TIME
OR ONE INTERN
YEAH THAT'S MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S ALREADY IN PROGRESS
AND YOU'RE YOU'RE WORKING UH I THINK YEAH W OKAY
SO ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE TO DO FOR THE NEXT TIME IS FIN FIND OUT ABOUT THE SEPARATIONS BETWEEN ROOMS AND
YEAH I THINK IT'S QUITE A HEAVY TRANSFORMATION OF THE BUILDING
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND OKAY I'LL TRY TO FIND OUT
AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS CAN WE SQUEEZE MAYBE FOUR PEOPLE IN THE UH OR AT LEAST FOUR PLACES IN THE THREE THREE P. ROOM
YEAH HOPEFULLY VISITORS DON'T NEED AS MUCH SAY FILING SPACE OR UM YEAH THEY DON'T HAVE THAT MANY PAPERS
UH OKAY
SO THAT'S UH I HAVE TO TO ASK SO YOU DON'T REALLY FEEL UM VERY STRONGLY ATTACHED TO THIS UH GROUPING BY PROJECTS IDEA
MM-HMM
UM
YEAH EXACTLY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH THEY THEY CAN CHANGE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE THE MAIN THINGS WE'LL HAVE TO ASK IS WHETHER PEOPLE HAVE STRONG PREFERENCES EITHER IN STAYING WITH SOMEONE OR IN UH NOT STAYING
UM ARE YOU AWARE F OF ANY STRONG CONSTRAINTS RIGHT NOW
OH
OKAY YEAH THAT'S TRUE
SO SMOKING IS NOW UM NO LONGER A CONSTRAINT
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S THE NEW REGULATION
UH ON THE BALCONY ACTUALLY
YEAH
NORMALLY
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
O ON THE TOILETS OR
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YES MARTIN SAID ALSO FOR HIM AND YEAH ESPECIALLY FOR HER
YEAH THE IN SHE'S THE INTERFACE
SO MM-HMM
YEP
MM-HMM
YEP
YEAH
YEAH I THINK YEAH
MM-HMM
I THINK PUTTING GISELLA WITH THE OTHER ADMIN OF THE SCHOOL IS NOT AN OPTION BECAUSE WE WEREN'T OFFERED YEAH
IT WOULD BE NICE BUT UH OKAY I'LL TRY TO FIND OUT BUT UH
I TH
YEAH
OKAY WE'LL TRY BUT ALL THESE YEAH ARE SAY SORT OF DIFFICULT QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE CHANGING ALSO THE OFFICES OF THE SCHOOL AND
YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANNA CHANGE IN GENERAL
UM LET'S SEE MAYBE WE CAN FIND SOME TEMPORARY WELL AT LEAST A PROPOSAL FOR GISELLA
SO SINCE THE ONE PERSON ROOMS ARE QUITE WELL SORT OF UM DESIRED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE SHE SHOULD PROBABLY NO Y YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH THE THE MIDDLE ONE HERE
OKAY
THIS ONE
OKAY
MM-HMM
WELL
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH WELL
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH BECAUSE IN THIS CASE YEAH
GISELLA COULD TAKE ONE OF THE THE TWO PERSON ROOMS AND THE OTHER PLACE WOULD BE FOR SOME KIND OF VISITOR THAT
I OR
AH
OKAY
UH
YEAH OR AN INTERN
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY SO THIS SETS A BIT THE STAGE FOR UH FOR GISELLA THEN
UH YEAH WE'LL TRY TO TO FIND OUT
UM ACTUALLY YEAH MAYBE WE SHOULD REMIND THAT QUITE A LOT OF PROFESSORS AT THE AT THE SCHOOL ACTUALLY SHARE THEIR OFFICE WITH THEIR ASSISTANT
SO B IT LOOKS LIKE SORT OF AN IMPLICIT TRADITION
MAYBE NOT TO BE FOLLOWED
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
UM OKAY SO I THINK WELL THIS SETS A BIT UH THE STAGE
UH COULD WE TRY SO COULD YOU TRY PLEASE TO UH DO YOU WANT AN EXTRA UH PIECE OF PAPER
MAYBE TRY TO WELL THINK ON YOUR OWN AND THEN TALK A LITTLE BIT JUST TO THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU
MM-HMM
YEAH
NO THE POINT WAS TO TRY TO WELL JUST TALK TO THEM TO DAVID OR
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO W W W WILL YOU ASK PEOPLE JUST FOR THEIR PLACE OR ALSO FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE'S PLACE
BECAUSE UH-HUH
WELL BUT THAT'S
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY TH THEN OKAY THEN FOR THE NEXT TIME UM TRY TO COME UP EITHER WITH YOUR OWN PREFERENCES
THAT'S QUITE EASY PROBABLY TO STATE NOW THAT YOU KNOW THE CONSTRAINTS
OR IF YOU CAN POLL A LITTLE BIT THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU THAT WOULD BE I MEAN EVEN
WELL JUST DISCUSS I YEAH FOR INSTANCE I MEAN NO NO I WAS THINKING JUST ASK PEOPLE AROUND YOU WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THIS
AND I THINK YEAH IT WILL BE NICE TO TO COME WITH MAYBE A SKETCH OF OF THESE
IF YOU CAN DO SLIDES IT'S EVEN BETTER BUT UH DON'T BE THAT FORMAL
AND UH WE'LL TRY TO AT LEAST BUILD UP ONE COHERENT PROPOSAL AND WE'LL MERGE IT WITH THE OTHER ONE WHEN THE OTHER ONE UH IS AVAILABLE
UM
OH GREAT
MM-HMM
PERFECT
YEAH
AND I'LL TRY TO
FINE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CAFETERIA EXACTLY
WHAT
YEAH W WE CAN BRING YOUR COFFEE IN THE READING ROOM BUT
SO SO SINCE MAYBE YOU'RE A PART TIME HERE AND PART TI PART TIME AT E. P. F. L.
THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO UM COFFEE MACHINES IN THE BUILDING ONE AT THE THIRD FLOOR ONE AT THE FIRST FLOOR
AND WE CAN BRING OUR COFFEE
NO UH AUTOMATIC UH COFFEE MACHINES
SO UH YEAH
BUT IN
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
YEAH VENDING MACHINES
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH MAYBE THIS IS NOT A VERY BAD TIMING
COULD WE TRY TO MEET UH NEXT TUESDAY
UM NEXT TUESDAY MAYBE AT T MAYBE A BIT LATER
MAYBE AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK
COME ON TRY TRY TO BE NICE
GI GIVE ME A REASONABLE DATE
YEAH FOR ME IT'S A GOOD TIMING
UH-HUH OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
VERY WELL
SO ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK
WOULD THAT BE OKAY
AFTER LUNCH
IT'S NOT A VERY DEMANDING MEETING SO UM PERFECT
UM THEN LET ME CLOSE THIS
AND UH GOOD LUCK FOR YOUR ARRANGEMENT GAMES
OKAY
OH YEAH
ANDRE JUST YEAH JUST A A CLARIFICATION QUESTION ARE THEY NUMBER OF PEOPLE PER ROOM INDICATED STRICT OR CAN WE PLAY AROUND WITH
I MEAN IF THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE IS IT REALLY THAT YOU CAN'T PUT THREE OR UH TWO AND A HALF OR UH HOW HOW WAS IT CALCULATED
'KAY
MM-HMM
I HAVE EVERYTHING
OKAY SO
ARE YOU SURE OF THAT
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT COUNTING THE REA THE THE READING ROOM
MM-HMM
AND SUSAN DON'T FORGET THE TIME WE SPEND TO FOR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT ROOM SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VALORIZE THIS IF POSSIBLE
BUT I STILL AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE B THE WE ARE NOT SO WE ARE NOT SO LARGE AS FAR AS SPACE IS CONCERNED
UH BECAUSE FIFTEEN PEOPLE TO PUT IN THERE EIGHTEEN POSITIONS
SO UH TO THE BEST UH IF YOU TAKE UH TWO PEOPLE ROOM FOR THE READING ROOM THEN YOU HAVE UH SIXTEEN PLACES
MM
YEAH THAT THAT ALSO MEANS THAT THE GROWTH WILL BE ZERO
VISITING VISITI VISITING RESEARCHERS STUDENTS COMING FOR EXCHANGE STUDENTS ET CETERA
WE J WE STAY WHERE WE ARE
NO THE THE THE CHANCES MIGHT BE THAT THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE TO PUT IN THAT SPACE
ANDRE SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING BUT UH ONE AGAIN CLARIFICATION QUESTION WHAT IS THE REAL MARGIN OF MANOEUVRE THAT WE HAVE FOR THESE DISCUSSIONS
BECAUSE UH AT LEAST WE ARE HALF PER CENT UH FIFTY PER CENT OF FROM E. P. F. L. AND UH SOMETIMES YOU HAVE MEETINGS WHERE W Y THE THE DECISION IS ALREADY TAKEN
SO UH UM YOU CAN SPEND QUITE A LOT OF TIME DISCUSSING THINGS SO WHAT WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT OF WHAT WE WILL COME OUT COME UP WITH
SO ANOTHER WAY OF A
ANOTHER WAY OF ASKING THE QUESTION IS THERE ANY OTHER GROUP ALREADY WORKING ON UH ON THE HOW THIS SHOULD BE UH SHOULD BE ALLOCATED
OR ARE WE THE THE ONE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO THE P THE THE P POSITION FOR IT
BUT WHA WHY WHY DON'T THEY HAVE ANY REPRESENTATIVE HERE
I MEAN
YEAH WHY DO WE DO IT SEPARATELY
OKAY
NO BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A STANDARD THING
IT'S SUPPOSE THAT SOMEBODY FOR SOME STRANGE REASONS WANT TO BE IN THE CORNER AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
WE'LL PUT THEM PUT HER OR HIM SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN WE WILL DO PLENTY OF WORK FOR NOTHING BECAUSE WE'LL NOT HAVE THIS CONSTRAINT
WE'LL NOT BE AWARE OF THIS CONSTRAINT
OH OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
I AGREE WITH THAT
THAT'S
WHE WHE WHERE PART TIME IS IMPORTANT IS THAT IT'S N AN OVERLO LOAD ON A ROOM SO UM FOR SURE IF YOU HAVE A PART TIME PERSON
IT REDUCES THE THE RANGES OF TIME WHERE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I PROBABLY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE A KIND OF A REGULAR PRESENCE HERE
UM THE UH THE THING THAT F IN MY CASE HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IS THAT I WILL HAVE A LOT OF PHONE CALLS
SO I'LL BE TALKING O O O OVER THE PHONE ALL THE TIME
SO THAT'S NOT NECESSARY WELL IT DEPENDS ON I I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST SHARING A A AN OFFICE WITH SOMEBODY
I D ALREADY DID IT BEFORE SO AND IT WAS PERFECTLY FINE
IT JUST HAS TO BE SOMEBODY WHO CAN WORK WHILE SOMEBODY ELSE IS HAVING PHONE CALLS IN THE IN THE ROOM WHICH IS VERY D MUCH DEPENDENT ON PEOPLE
SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT DISTURB AT ALL BY THIS
SOME PEOPLE JUST CAN'T WORK
I'M NOT
BUT UH AND UH WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BUT IT UH IT WILL NOT BE SO HEAVY HERE UH AT ISSCO IS VISITORS
SO THAT I WILL HAVE MORE AT E. P. F. L. UH TYPICALLY STUDENTS COMING IN UM OR ASKING FOR THINGS
AS I'M NOT TEACHING HERE I'M TEACHING AT E. P. F. L. THIS SHOULD SHOULDN'T BE A SUCH A BIG LOAD
SO FOR ME IT IT WILL BE ESSENTIALLY I WILL NOT BE I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE SILENT IN THE ROOM
BECAUSE I WILL BE COMMUNICATING ALSO THROUGH VOCAL MEANS SO
HMM
YEAH
HMM
DO YOU GO FOR BOXES FOR INSTANCE
IN THE IN THE BIGGER ROOMS WHERE YEAH YOU KNOW LIKE UH CUBICLES
YEAH
HMM
YOU MEAN YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE WALLS
FOUR WALLS
YEAH
YEAH SURE SURE
MM-HMM
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
I FULLY AGREE WITH THAT
THAT'S UH IT'S MUCH EASIER TO ME TO UH TO FORESEE HAVING TWO PEOPLE OF THE SAME POSITION SHARING A ROOM THAN UH
OH SHARING WITH THEIR STUDENTS
OH SORRY BECAUSE BUT THAT THAT'S UH IT'S IT'S TRICKY BECAUSE OF CONFIDENTIALITY REASONS AS YOU SAID
YEAH YOU YOU YOU ARE DISCUSSING A BUDGET ON THE ON THE PROJECT
YOU OVER THE PHONE TYPICALLY YOU DON'T NECESSARY WANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THAT BUDGET BEING PART OF THE DISCUSSION SO
NO
NO BECAUSE PRO PROJECT DOESN'T LAST IN TIME
THEY WILL CHANGE
THAT'S WHAT THE ONLY THING THAT WILL NOT OR THAT WILL CHANGE ONLY PROGRESSIVELY IN TIME IS THE STATUS OF THE PEOPLE
MM
YEAH THEY WILL PROMOTE THAT
BUT STILL TH SOME THINGS WELL YEAH
YEAH
IF IF IT IF I IF PROJECTS ARE WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND I THINK THAT UH MEETING ROOM IS THE THE TOOL FOR THAT
IF YOU NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE IN A PROJECTS TALKING TOGETHER
THEY JUST HAVE A MEETING ROOM IF IT'S NOT TOO FAR AWAY THEN THEN IT'S A VERY GOOD GOOD PRACTICE
YES
THAT'S WHY I WAS QUITE RECEPTIVE TO UH SUSAN'S REMARK AT THE BEGINNING IS I WOULDN'T FORMULATE IT IN A SUCH A AN EXTREME WAY AS
DO WE REALLY NEED THE LOUNGE
BUT UH I WOULD P PROBABLY FORMULATE IT IN THE WAY THAT UH
DO WE WANT TO HAVE ONLY A LOUNGE OR S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE USED ONLY AS A READING ROOM
BECAUSE BECAUSE MEETING ROOMS TO ME ARE VERY IMPORTANT TOOLS TO DO UH COLLABORATIVE WORK
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE ALSO HAVE TO RELAX SO THAT'S
YES
YES
YEAH
'CAUSE THAT'S REALLY MY ONE OF MY WORRIES WITH THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE HERE IS THAT IT'S IT PR PROVIDES NO POSSIBLE POSSIBILITIES OF EXPANSION
AND THIS WILL HAPPEN
I MEAN YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T PREVENT HAVING VISITORS
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
WHICH FOR FOR FIFTEEN PEOPLE IT'S NOT ENOUGH
I MEAN UH
YEAH IT'S WE HAVE WE HAVE FOUR PROFESSORS HERE AND AND AND TWO RESEARCHERS
MM
IT'S BAD IT'S BAD
BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY RELATED WITH SECURITY UH REGULATION AS WELL
I MEAN YOU CAN'T JUST PUT WALLS IN IN ROOMS WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC AUTHORIS YEAH
UH IT'S NOT NECESSARY HEAVY IN TERMS OF WORK
IT'S HEAVY IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORISATION
AT LEAST AT E. P. F. L.
I THINK SO
IF YOU ORGANISE THE DESKS IN A IN A INTELLIGENT WAY
YEP
YEAH RIGHT THAT'S THE POINT
NO
COFFEE MACHINES ARE THAT MADE FOR THAT
NO THAT'S THAT'S PROXIMITY DOESN'T PLAY A BIG ROLE THERE
WE CAN DISCUSS WITH PEOPLE THAT THE THE SPACE IS VERY SMALL I MEAN ALTOGETHER IT'S
AND UH YOU DON'T Y YOU DON'T NEED TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE PROJECTS YOU F MORE NEED ABOUT TH TO DISCUSS ABOUT WHERE IS THE PRINTER
HOW DO I GET FURNITURE I'M I DON'T HAVE A A PENCIL WHERE IS THE THE BOX WITH THE PENCILS AND SO ON
THIS IS NOT PROJECT RELATED
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
IT'S NON SMOKING CAMPUS
NOT EVEN IN THE CAFETERIA
DOWNSTAIRS
OKAY
WOW
ON THE ROOF MAYBE
THE BALCONY OKAY
BUT ANDRE UH JUST A
STILL SOME PLACES WHERE SMOKERS CAN SURVIVE
BUT ANDRE JUST A COMMENT ABOU ABOUT YOUR YOUR PREVIOUS UH REQUEST
I I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE WILL PROVIDE YOU INFORMATION SUCH AS WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE WITH WHOM
THAT'S A TYPICAL UH OUTPUT OF EX UH RESEARCH IN EXPERT SYSTEMS
THESE ARE THE RULES THAT YOU NEVER GET
BUT UH YOU CAN GET THEM THROUGH A PROPOSAL
SO YOU PROPOSE A SET UP
WHERE PEOPLE ARE WITH OTHER PEOPLES AND THEY WILL FIND POLITICALLY CORRECT WAYS TO TELL YOU THAT UH THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A VIEW ON THE MOUNTAINS
BUT THEY PREFER TO HAVE VIEW ON THE OLD TOWN SO THEY WOULD BE IN THE TOILETS
THEY WOULD UM P PREFER TO BE IN ANOTHER ROOM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THAT'S A SEC S THAT'S THE ADMIN THAT'S THE ADMIN UH SO IT'S PART OF THE WORK
YEAH
AND THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM YOU'RE RIGHT
BECAUSE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A ONE PERSON WE D WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ONE PERSON ROOMS FOR UH ACCOMMODATING THE UH THE ADMIN PLACE
AND UH IF YOU PUT TWO PERSON PERSONS OR THREE PERSONS FOR THE ADMIN SPACE WHO WHO WHO ELSE WOULD YOU PUT IN THERE
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY ASSISTANT MANAGER OR WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE ONLY ONE HALF PART HALF TIME UH ADMIN AND NO OTHER NON RESEARCHER POSITIONS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
AND THIS IS REALLY A PIECE OF A PROBLEM
MAYBE YOU COULD PUT SOME VISITORS BUT UM
I KNOW
IT'S NOT VERY UH REALISTIC IN A IN A IN AN ADMIN ROOM BUT UH
YEAH BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T PUT A RESEARCHER THERE
THAT'S JUST EITHER YOU LOSE ONE POSITION OR YOU FIND ANOTHER ADMIN OR ASSISTANT MANAGER
YEAH
YEP
NO THAT'S NOT SURE THAT'S NOT SURE
UH THE THERE ARE TO ME THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS POSSIBLE IS EITHER YOU WE CAN TAKE ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOMS FOR THE ADMIN
BECAUSE SOME OF TYPICALLY THE PROFESSORS HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR SHARING
SHARING EITHER WITH A COLLEAGUE OR SHARING UH WITH SOME OF THEIR UH ONE OF THEIR P. H. D. STUDENTS
IN THAT CASE IT'S IT'S REALISTIC
THEN WE COULD VERY VERY SIMPLY UH ALLOCATE THE ONE PERS ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOMS FOR THE ADMIN
AND THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM
THE OTHER THING IS TO TAKE A TWO PERSON ROOM FOR THE ADMIN
THAT COULD BE THE ONE UH CLOSE TO THE UH CLOSE TO THE HERE IN THE CENTRE SO UH THE YEAH
BUT THA NO NO NO THE OTHER ONE THE THE ONE OP YEAH HERE THIS ONE
BUT THEN UH THAT THE THE QUESTION OF WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE SECOND POSITION THERE REMAINS FULLY OPEN
SO I WOULD BE I WOULD BE MORE OF THE OPINION TO TO SEE WHETHER IT'S IT'S SO EVIDENT THAT
LET'S SAY THE AT LEAST THE TWO FULL FULL TIME PROFESSORS THAT ARE HERE ON THE LIST WE HAVE ONE HERE BUT UH MAGGIE IS IS NOT PRESENT
IF THEY REALLY
YEAH AND PIERRETTE
IF IF IF BECAUSE OF PERSONAL PREFERENCES THEY WOULD BE HAPPY WITH A TWO PERSON ROOM WHICH MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE
I MEAN IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY NOT UH SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD IMPOSE BUT WE CAN ASK
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT REALISTIC EITHER
I MEAN YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A FORE FOREIGN RESEARCHER COMING VISITING YOU AND YOU WILL PUT PUT HIM IN THE ADMIN OFFICE
UH YOU'LL NOT DO THAT
I MEAN UH MAYBE YOU CAN DO THAT WITH AN EXCHANGE STUDENT THAT'S
BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE A SENIOR VISITOR AND UH HIM IN THE IN THE SECRETARY
UH YOU'RE HERE
AS SUSAN SAID P
YEAH
IS THAT SO
OH
YEAH
OKAY
NO NO THAT'S IT
AS WE SAID IT'S IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE IT CANNOT BE SOMETHING ELSE
IT CANNOT BE IMPOSED FOR SURE
IT'S UH
JOB
AGAIN UH UH UM ANDRE I THINK THAT THE ONLY REALISTIC WAY WE CAN DO IS TO SPEAK FOR OUR FOR OURSELVES
I CAN TELL YOU ACCORDING TO WHAT I KNOW NOW WHERE I WOULD LIKE OR WOULD BE READY TO BE
BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW I COULD DECIDE FOR UH MAGGIE OR PIERRETTE OR WHOEVER ELSE ON THE LIST THAT THEY SHOULD BE THERE
YEAH B WHY WHY COULDN'T WE DO LIKE COULDN'T WE DO IT LIKE FOR FOR THE THE SET UP OF MEETINGS
YOU YOU EVERYONE RECEIVED THAT AND UH SHOULD PROVIDE YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE
AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE THIS MULTI CONSTRAINT PROBLEM AND UH YOU WORK DURING TWO HOURS AND YOU COME UP WITH THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION
YEAH I WOULD I WOULD ASK FOR THEIR PLACE
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING YOU WANT TO KNOW
UH IT'S A READING ROOM
READING ROOM IT'S NOT A CAFETERIA
BUT THAT THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION WHETHER IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT AT THE ORIGIN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A F PURE READING ROOM FOR RELAXING
UH READING THE NEWSPAPERS ET CETERA ET CETERA
UH THERE HAS BEEN A VERY LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT
I STINCT UH THIS DISCUSSION IS STILL VIVID THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE I BEL BELONG TO THESE PEOPLE
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MIXED ROOM WHERE YOU CAN HAVE A READING ROOM FOR SURE BUT ALSO MEETING ROOM IF NECESSARY
OR AS UH SUSAN SAID A ROOM AN EMERGENCY ROOM WHERE YOU CAN PUT UH SOME VISITORS IN A DECENT ENVIRONMENT FOR FOR FOR FOR WORK
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER PLACE TO DO IT
BUT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY AN OPEN DISCUSSION AND THAT D I THINK NO DECISION NO FINAL DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN ABOUT THAT
YES
YES
THE ONE THAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE IN THE NEXT ROOM
OKAY
OKAY
THAT WOULD BE GREAT
THAT WOULD BE GREAT
C THAT THAT OF COURSE IS ONE OF THE MAIN WELL NOT MAIN BUT ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FEATURES THAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT
YES
YES
WE DON'T HAVE CAFETERIA
NO THERE IS NO COFFEE IN THE READING ROOM
THAT WAS THE WRONG WE WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MONEY FOR BUYING THE COFFEE MACHINES SO
FIVE
AND YOU CAN BRING YOUR COFFEE IN THE READING ROOM
T TO TRY THE COFFEE
WAIT WAI WAI WAI WAIT
NEXT TUESDAY
UH WELL WELL WELL WELL NOT SO EASY EH
NEXT TUESDAY WE HAVE A MEETING YEAH
THAT MIGHT BE WHERE IS THE MEETING
IT'S UNIMAIL
OKAY SO YEAH YEAH THEN IT COULD BE THAT
THAT YEAH
THAT THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD ALLOW US NOT TO MOVE OR NOT TO TRAVEL TWICE
YEAH AFTER LUNCH
RIGHT
YEP
OKAY
THANK YOU
MM-HMM
UH THEY HAVE ANOTHER GROUP AND THEN UH UH UH ANDRE AND AGNES WILL DISCUSS ABOUT IT WITH
YOU ARE THE REP REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS GROUP ACTUALLY
HMM
YEAH UH OKAY UH
ME PERSONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO TO TO SHARE THE OTHER PEOPL N UH THE ROOM WITH ASSISTANTS AS WHEN YOU HAVE PROBLEMS OF NORMAL LIFE
LIKE UH THE PRINTER DOESN'T WORK UH I DON'T WANT TO ASK THIS TO MY SUPERVISOR
SO IT'S BETTER TO TO BE WITH A WITH AN ASSISTANT TO SHARE THE ROOM
MM-HMM
WHAT UH I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SHARE UH T TO HA TO SHARE THE SAME DESK
UH I STILL WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY DRAWERS AND THESE THINGS
IT'S
IT'S FUNNY THAT UH WE MOVE TO ANOTHER BUILDING BECAUSE WE RUN OUT OF UH SPACE AND WE WILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM
AH OKAY
BUT UH USUALLY WHE WHEN NEW ASSISTANTS COME
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THE ROOM WITH SOMEONE THAT KNOWS UH L UH IT'S RELATED WITH THE PROJECT SO HE CAN
MM
NO OKAY
MM-HMM
IS IT ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE AN OFFICE IF IT'S A ONE PERSON NO NOT ANY MORE

THIS IS ALWAYS THE GAME
NO BUT BUT LOOK MARTIN IT'S QUITE A LONG ROOM IT HAS TWO DOORS
YEAH THE OCCUPANCY IS BETTER THAT WAY
BECAUSE THERE IS REGULAR THERE IS REGULAR OCCUPANCY YEAH
WE WON'T BE VERY CREDIBLE
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
I I JUST NEED TO SEE SOMEBODY
SORRY YEAH
NO BECAUSE THERE IS ANOTHER PERSON RIGHT NOW A STUDENT THAT I JUST UH UM HIRED
AND SHE'S JUST WORKING RIGHT NOW FOR UH
FOR NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER YEAH
A SHE UH SHE'S A SHE'S A REAL VISITOR
SHE'S A REAL VISITOR THAT I JUST MADE A CONTRACT FOR HER FOR TWO MONTHS
YEAH
WHAT'S THE TIMELINE ON THIS NOW
SO YOU HAVE A MEETING WHEN
MM-HMM
OH YEAH
HOW MANY CONNECTIONS ARE THERE PER ROOM
NO GET THE UH FOR THE THE BIGGER ROOMS YOU GET DOUBLE FOR EVERY WORKPLACE YOU GET TWO LINES
YEAH
YEAH
NO BECAUSE LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A SUN AND THEY HAVE A A PC SO
WELL WE HAVE TO SAY HOW MANY PLACES THAT WE WANT TO HAVE
YEAH THEY'LL JUST GIVE US A DATE WHEN
THE WELL THERE IS DOWNSTAIRS IN THE BUILDING AND PRETTY SOON THE WHOLE BUILDING WILL BE COVERED
YEAH
YEAH BUT RIGHT NOW IN UH DOWNSTAIRS IT'S FINE
SOME PEOPLE CAN PICK IT UP ON SIXTH FLOOR
BUT PRETTY SOON THE WHOLE BUILDING WILL BE COVERED
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
HEY LOOK THESE ARE MICROPHONES THEY UH THEY'RE FOR WOMEN'S SHIRTS
UM OKAY SO UM LET'S START
UM THANKS FOR COMING AGAIN TO THIS MEETING
I HOPE IT WON'T BE TOO LONG AND ESPECIALLY THAT WE'LL MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON UH THIS UH ON THIS SMALL TASK THAT IS PUTTING PEOPLE IN OUR NEW ROOMS
UH I HOPE YOU HAD FUN IN UH WELL DESIGNING SOMETHING OR UH ASKING THE PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PREFERENCES AND UH THINGS LIKE THIS
SO YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT IT'S FOR WOMEN'S SHIRTS
UM SO UM WELL I THINK YOU REMEMBER ALL THE CONSTRAINTS AND THE NEW SETTINGS
I THINK YOU'LL BE MORE AND MORE USED TO IT AS AS SOON AS WE MOVE
SO WE HAVE THESE ONE PERSON TWO PERSON AND THREE PERSON ROOMS
UM AND SO THAT MAKES I THINK EIGHTEEN PLACES
AND WE HAD ABOUT FIFTEEN PEOPLE AND SOME UH SPARE UH SPARE MM WELL
WORKING PLACES TO TO PUT UM MAY I FIRST UH PROVIDE THE ANSWERS TO THE THE QUESTIONS FROM THE LAST TIME
OH GREAT YEAH
SO THAT WILL BE PART OF THE YOUR UH YOUR SOLUTION OR SUGGESTIONS TO SOLUTION
BUT REGARDING THE CONSTRAINTS UM THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE PLAN TO TO MAKE SEPARATIONS BETWEEN THE ROOMS SO THAT MEANS BASICALLY WELL
WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS SETTING AND UH IT'S IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO MAKE NEW DOORS AND NEW WALLS
SO I THINK WE SHOULDN'T COUNT ON THEM IN THE NEXT UH FOUR YEARS MAYBE
AND THEY DON'T WANT US TO SH I MEAN THEY DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE AN EXTRA WORKING SPACE FOR GISELLA WITH THE OTHER I. T. ADMINS
WHICH WE COULD UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF FULL OVER THERE BUT UH AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID
SO IT SEEMS WE UH YEAH THE WELL WE CANNOT CHANGE THE HABITS OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL JUST FOR US
THOUGH IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD THING MAYBE BUT UH WE'LL SEE
SO REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY TO PUT FOUR PEOPLE IN ONE OF THE TWO UH THREE PERSON ROOMS
UM WELL IT'S NOT VERY EASY WE'LL HAVE TO PLAY UH QUITE UH QUITE WISELY WITH THE FURNISHING
IT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE AT LEAST ON THE ONE THAT IS A BIT UH LONGER ON ON THE RIGHT
SO UH THE ONE UH HERE
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PUT FOUR PERSONS
IF WE COULD AVOID IT IT WOULD MUCH SIMPLIFY THINGS BUT UH WELL WE'LL SEE
NO
NO NO NO
YEAH I THINK YEAH
IT IT'S MORE A MATTER OF HOW TO ARRANGE THE FURNITURE BUT UH SINCE WE ARE EXPERTS AT THIS TASK UH OKAY
SO MAYBE WE COULD COUNT ON ON FOUR PLACES BUT THE FINAL DECISION IS NOT REALLY OURS SO UH WE'LL SEE ACTUALLY THIS
EXACTLY
OR ONE OF THE INTERN POSITIONS THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT COME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UM OKAY SO THESE WERE THE UM THE ANSWERS
SO ACTUALLY I I DID MY UH MY PROPOSAL AS A SLIDE
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO START OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO END
IT'S UH
OH GREAT
BEAUTIFUL
OKAY THEN LET ME UM EXPLAIN VERY BRIEFLY THE THE RATIONALE FOR FOR THIS
SO IT'S THE SAME UH SCHEMA THAT YOU KNOW
IN RED YOU HAVE THE UH UH OH EXCUSE ME THAT'S QUITE UH ANNOYING EXCUSE ME
UM HELLO
OH YEAH UM CAN I CAN I CALL YOU A BIT LATER IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR
I'M JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF A MEETING AND I'M TALKING
OH OKAY THANK YOU
BYE BYE
UM SORRY FOR THIS
FORTUNATELY WE WERE JUST UH THE FOUR OF US
UM
OKAY SO LET ME GET BACK TO INTO THE PROPOSAL AFTER THE BRIEF INTERRUPTION
UM SO THE NAMES ARE IN RED
NOW UM WELL ONE OF THE REASONS AT LEAST FOR ME FOR DOING THIS WAS TO MORE OR LESS GROUP PEOPLE UH WITH WITHIN PROJECTS
BECAUSE I I THINK THAT SOMETIMES THEY JU THEY JUST DISCUSS TOGETHER AND UH IT'S EASIER IF THEY ARE IN THE SAME OFFICE
AND UM WHICH IS QUITE HAPPY ACTUALLY I I ALSO THOUGHT THAT SOME PROFESSORS MIGHT ENJOY
OR AT LEAST UH DON'T DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT BEING WITH THEIR ASSISTANTS
SO I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR SUSAN UH SAYING THAT MAGGIE AND BRUNO COULD WELL TOGETHER AND PIERRETTE AND UH MARIANNE IN IN THE SAME OFFICE
UM SO WHAT I CAN SAY IS UH THAT I ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT SUSAN WOULD BE RATHER IN FAVOUR OF UH
WELL HAVING HER OWN OFFICE SO UH IT'S IT'S IT'S WORKING LIKE THIS
I PUT THE LOUNGE IN THE MIDDLE
IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE ROOMS WITH THE FEWER UH THE FEWEST UH WINDOWS
SO I THINK THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO JUST STAY THERE AND STARE OUTSIDE
UH BUT IT'S IT'S NICER TO HAVE A NICER VIEW FROM YOUR OFFICE I GUESS
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH MAYBE I THOUGHT IN AN ANGLE BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT VERY
YEAH
OKAY AND SO NEXT TO THE PHOTOCOPY MAYBE IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD PLACE
HERE
OKAY
YEAH WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK THA YEAH BUT THE PRINTER IS QUITE SMALL IF WE FI FIND JUST A SMALL TABLE FOR IT
MAYBE ONE DAY WE'LL HAVE A PHOTOCOPY THAT IS ALSO A PRINTER
SO OKAY BUT UH I WOULDN'T WELL INSIST ON THIS I THINK OKAY SO THE PRINTER
WELL WE'LL REMOVE IT IF WE WORK FROM THIS UH THIS SOLUTION
SO UH I. M. TWO IS MORE OR LESS IN THE UPPER LEFT SIDE
UM I SAID MORE OR LESS UM UH UPPER UH LOWER LEFT SIDE UH YOU HAVE SWISSTRA AND SO THE TWO PROJECTS FROM THE LIST
AND THEN ON THE ON THE RIGHT SIDE
MAYBE NOT A VER A VERY GOOD SOLUTION FOR GISELLA
IF YOU CAN SUGGEST SOMETHING UH BETTER BECAUSE SHE'S WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO UH WELL TWO P. H. D. STUDENTS
AND IT'S TRUE THAT SHE HAS YEAH A LOT OF PHONE CALLS TO MAKE BUT UM IT'S SOME WAY TO TO SOLVE SOME CONSTRAINTS
I THINK THIS IS A VERY OPEN THING
UH IF YOU WANT WE CAN USE THIS DOCUMENT OR WE COULD JUST SAY
FIRST LISTEN TO YOUR SUGGESTIONS AND SEE IF WE ERASE EVERYTHING OR JUST DO SOME MODIFICATIONS USING THIS ONE
UM YEAH MAYBE NOT A VERY STRONG ONE
THEN THEY MAYBE YOU ARE YOU HAVE BETTER SUGGESTIONS
UM IT WAS I THINK SORT OF ONE OF THE UH PLACES THEY RE THAT REMAIN AND I I THINK
YEAH THERE IS NO STRONG CONSTRAINT AND UH WELL
SHE'S A SMOKER BUT THE POLICY IS THAT WE DON'T SMOKE SO IT'S EVEN BETTER IF SHE'S UH WITH A SECOND PERSON
UH-HUH
OKAY
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
YEAH MM
YEAH THAT WAS THE CASE AND UH SHE WAS A BIT UH RELUCTANT BUT
MM-HMM
YEAH WE COULD STORE FILES THERE AND THINGS LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
OKAY SO IF YOU WANT I CAN ALREADY DO THIS CHANGE HERE
SORRY YOU'RE
UM
MM-HMM
YEAH TH YEAH TH WHEN THE PRINTER IS YEAH IT'S IT'S THE MAIN ONE
WE HAVE A SECONDARY ONE WHICH WE COULD TRY TO ACCOMMODATE IN ANOTHER ROOM BUT IT'S BASICALLY YEAH THE PEOP THE THE PRINTER WHERE EVERYBODY PRINTS
UM SO I CHANGE THIS
SO MAYBE I WOULD SUGGEST LET ME LE K CAN I HEAR ALSO LET US HEAR FROM YOU
AND THEN IF WE CAN WORK OUT A SOLU A COMMON SOLUTION FROM THIS ONE THEN WE GO BACK TO TO THIS SLIDE
AND IF NOT UM WE'LL JUST WELL START FROM SCRATCH
UM
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH I'LL TRY
I'LL BRING MY WALKMAN AND UH
YEAH
UH DAVID YOU HAD ALSO UH WHAT'S
AH
UH-HUH
OH LET ME PUT THE PLAN SORRY
I WILL DISPLAY UH YEAH THIS IS THE EMPTY ONE
I DON'T WANT TO INFLUENCE YOU
SO SO YOU WOULD PUT UH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YOU CAN YOU CAN EVEN STAND AND JUST SHOW US THERE
OKAY SO WE WOULD PREFER THE NAMES
OKAY I I DON'T WANT TO INFLUENCE YOU TOO MUCH BUT UH MM I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY TO START WITH THIS AS THE BASIS AND THEN CHANGE THINGS
YEAH MAYBE IN DIFFERENT JUST
UH-HUH
OH
MM-HMM
OR ACTUALLY PIERRETTE IS A WOMAN TOO
YEAH IT'S THE FEMININE OF PIERRE
UH-HUH
BAD
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH AND FOR ME IT'S ALSO UH I WOULD PREFER MAYBE NOT TO BE IN A THREE PERSON OFFICE JUST TO BE A BIT CALMER
AND MARTIN SO I'M VERY HAPPY WITH YOU SINCE I PROPOSED IT
BUT I COULD ALSO BE HAPPY WITH MOST OF THE OTHER PEOPLE SO EVEN IN A THREE PERSON ROOM
IT'S IT'S FINE
OKAY SO LET'S KEEP IN MIND MAYBE THIS UH CONSTRAINT OF BALANCING THE THE GENDERS UH WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN UH DO SOMETHING FOR IT
UH I'VE ASKED SOME OF THEM AND I'VE ALSO USED A LITTLE BIT UH WHAT I'VE WELL
I MEAN THE THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENT JUST NOT TO TO SHOCK PEOPLE TOO MUCH
AND IT'S ALSO PEOPLE THAT I KNOW UM GET ON WELL QUITE QUITE WELL TOGETHER AND ALSO WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT LIKE FOR INSTANCE
MARIANNE UH UH THE FINNISH MARIANNE AND UH NIKOS WHO INTERACT QUITE A LOT ON UH ON
UM YEAH MARIA AND YALINA SEEM UH TO GO ON ONE QUITE QUITE WELL
UH NANCY HAD NO STRONG PREFERENCE SPECIALLY SINCE SHE'S NO LONGER ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN IN HER OFFICE
UM YEAH SO I THINK WELL AT LEAST AS FAR AS I I ASKED THERE WAS NO MAJOR OBJECTION
UM
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S TRUE
I UM SO WE COULD PUT NANCY WITH DAVID AND UH PUT AGNES YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S A SMALL ADVANTAGE AND UH I IT'S A BIT MORE UH MORE COMFORTABLE ACTUALLY
UM
MM-HMM
YEAH MAYBE
MM-HMM
YEAH
VERY GOOD
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH PROBABLY
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO AGNES HAS WORKED
MM-HMM

MM YEAH I I DON'T THINK
YEAH SO S S OKAY SO SINCE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO A FINAL PROPOSAL

UH I DON'T THINK WE CAN PUT VISITORS IN THE LOUNGE IT'S UH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
IT'S
MM-HMM
HOW
HOW WOULD IT BE TO PUT THE LOUNGE IN ONE OF THE SMALLER OFFICES
LIKE IN WELL IN IN ONE OF THE ONE PERSON OFFICES
W I I KNOW THEY ARE ACTUALLY QUITE UH QUITE DEMANDED SO UM I TH I THINK
SUSAN YOU ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THIS SOLUTION SO OKAY
IN GISELL
YEAH IT'S PROBABLY TOO SMALL
OKAY YEAH DOESN'T WORK
MM
MM-HMM
OKAY LET'S BE INNOVATIVE
UM
MM-HMM
BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT IT HAS BEEN DECIDED BY EVERYONE AND APPROVED BY THE SCHOOL THAT WE WE NEED THE LOUNGE SO I I THINK IT'S SIMPLY NOT
NO ACTUALLY UH I I'M SORRY IT'S UH YEAH
MM-HMM
OH
OKAY SO SO HOW DO WE SPLIT THE ROOM
THIS ONE
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
SO
YEAH
BUT WHAT ABOUT IF PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE A SMALL DISCUSSION IN THE LOUNGE
WELL NOT THE NEWSPAPERS BECAUSE NO SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES
JOURNALS
UH-HUH

SO YOU WOULD LIKE TO PUT IT YEAH WITHIN YEAH AND THEN WHO WHO YEAH
YEAH
YEAH OKAY BUT THEN THAT MEANS THAT WE'LL PUT THE LOUNGE ON THE RIGHT SIDE UH HERE
AND UH HERE WE'LL PUT TWO PLACES FOR VISITORS
THREE
BUT THAT MEANS THE OFFICE WILL BE AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT EMPTY
THAT LOOKS VERY BAD
OKAY SO THAT COULD TAKE THE THE FREE PLACE OVER THERE
UH I MEAN

OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND AND WHERE IS THE LOUNGE
NO OKAY NO WAY
I'LL I'LL HAVE MY HEAD CUT OFF IF WE DON'T HAVE A LOUNGE
SO UH
NO NO NO NO LET'S DO THE LOUNGE CORNER
OKAY
AT LEAST
I MEAN OTHERWISE I CANNOT REALLY DEFEND IT BECAUSE IT IT WAS AGREED AND WE CANNOT JUST COME BACK ON EVERY EVERY DECISION WE MADE
YEAH I THINK SO YEAH
OKAY
WELL LET'S HAVE THE VISITORS FIRST
OKAY SO WHAT WE NEED IS A NEW AND TWO
SO
I THINK WE CAN PUT WHAT MARIA OR YALINA
I DON'T WANT TO SEPARATE THEM REALLY BUT UH
OH
MYSEL I DON'T LIKE THAT OFFICE ACTUALLY

OKAY LET ME KEEP YOU
OKAY WE'LL PUT PAOLA AND A VISITOR HERE
SO PAOLA IS THE NEW PERSON
AND A VISITOR UH VIS

AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL STILL HAVE PROBABLY SOME WAY TO PUT A SECOND VISITOR HERE
VIS TWO
OOPS

UH-HUH
YEAH

OKAY SO LET'S PUT MARIA IN THE SEPARATE OFFICE
AND WE HAVE PAOLA
OH SORRY WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
SO WHO IS WITH MARIA HERE
OKAY
YEAH
AND NO VISITOR
YEAH BUT THAT MEANS THAT THIS ROOM THE MIDDLE ONE WOULD BE QUITE EMPTY
ALL THE I MEAN TWO VISITORS AND THE FIFTY PER CENT PERS PERSON I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY UH REASONABLE
YEAH BUT LET'S SPLIT THEM A LITTLE BIT SO THAT WHEN THERE ARE NO VISITORS AT LEAST PEOPLE ARE
YEAH I THINK SO
SO THIS GOES HERE GOES VISITOR TWO
PAOLA IS THERE
HERE GOES VISITOR ONE
AND IS THIS BETTER
EXCEPT THAT WE CANNOT READ IT BUT
APART FROM THIS
MM-HMM
YEAH OKAY
LET ME CALL THIS VISITOR ONE WHICH IMPLIES THAT UH IT WILL BE THE FIRST ONE OCCUPIED BY A VISITOR WHEN THEY COME
AND THIS VISITOR TWO WHICH MEANS IT'S LIKE A WELL YOU KNOW SECOND UH SECOND CHANCE
OR WE COULD
WHAT WOULD THIS CHANGE
MM-HMM
OH YEAH VERY GOOD
YEAH SO MAYBE IN THE LONG RUN WE'LL GET A WALL
UH-HUH
AL ALTHOUGH THERE ARE THREE WINDOWS BUT UM OKAY
SO WHERE WOULD WE MOVE DAVID TO MARIA DA WITH MARIA
DO YOU HAVE ANY PREFERENCES DAVID
UM
WELL HE ALREADY IS MIXED
SO YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I WOULDN'T PUT THE TWO VISITORS IN THE SAME ROOM BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS NO ONE IT MAKES A BIG HOLE
AND WHEN THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE SO IT MAKES TOO MANY VARIATIONS BUT
YEAH
MM-HMM

OKAY
OKAY
OOPS

THIS ONE
YEAH MY UH
OKAY
WELL I THINK THAT WAS REALLY DECIDED AND IT'S IT'S NO WE NO BECAUSE

DAVID OR VISITOR ONE OR TWO
IT'S UH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO WE'LL KNOW THAT UH THAT THE REGION ACTUALLY AROUND HERE IS PROBABLY MOVABLE
YEAH EITHER YEAH WE CAN SWITCH MARIA OR PAOLA OR DAVID

YEAH THA THA YEAH THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS TRY TO PUT THE TO SEPARATE THE VISITORS JUST TO BALANCE A LITTLE BIT
BUT OKAY WE'LL UH WE'LL BE OPEN ON ON THAT POINT
YEAH IT WILL BECOME
MM-HMM
OR IT DEPENDS ALSO ON WELL IF YALINA STAYS LONGER OR NOT WHICH IS NOT YET VERY CLEAR BUT UM

WELL WE WE WON'T HAVE ANY EXTRA MEETING WELL THE FOUR OF US
SO YEAH THIS ONE HAS TO TO BE THE THE FINAL ONE
UM SO UM WE'LL WE'LL HAVE ACTUALLY I I'LL PRESENT THIS TO
WELL WITH THE OTHER I'LL COMPARE IT WITH THE OTHER ONE AND UH TRY TO MAKE A DECISION ACTUALLY
I THINK IT'S EVEN UH A BIT LATER OR IN TWO DAYS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS

WE YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
W WE CAN LEAVE IT LIKE THIS AND THEN
UH YEAH THERE WILL BE NAMES ON THE DOORS
SO SHE'LL BE A VISITOR
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH WE'LL WE'LL KEEP IT LIKE THIS
UM OKAY I WELL
I'LL TRY TO TO EXPRESS ALL THESE CONSTRAINTS AND UH AND SAY IN PARTICULAR THAT THE TWO ROOMS OVER HERE ACTUALLY ARE SORT OF UH
WELL S THINGS COULD BE CHANGED OVER THERE BUT ON SOME OTHER SIDES
YEAH THE VISITOR SPACE YEAH I'LL UH
MM-HMM
YEAH UH THAT'S TRUE
AND
WELL
I THINK THIS I I'M NOT VERY SURE BUT I THINK THIS WILL BE DONE AFTER THE MEETING WHEN OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
A AS FAR AS KNOW I THINK AGNES IS ALSO TAKING CARE OF A PROPOSAL SO OKAY YEAH I'LL CIRCULATE THIS
PERFECT
YEAH EXACTLY
OKAY SO MAYBE WE'LL LEARN SOME MORE CONSTRAINTS
UM OKAY
UM YEAH ACTUALLY AS I AS I TOLD UH MARTIN UM WELL THIS IS THE LAST TIME WE MEET
SO UH THIS IS WELL MORE OR LESS OUR PROPOSAL
AND UH WE'LL HAVE A MEETING I THINK IT'S UH IT'S IN TWO DAYS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH TO DISCUSS AND COMPARE WITH THE OTHER PROPOSAL AND UH WELL MAKE A FINAL DECISION
ACTUALLY PROBABLY A PRE FINAL ONE SINCE WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK AGAIN WITH EVERYONE
BUT UH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL SO ACTUALLY I THINK I I'M NOT VERY SURE BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS
WELL FINDING OUT WHEN WE WILL MOVE AND THIS HAPPENS IN PROBABLY
I THINK NEXT MONTH OR DEPENDS ALSO ON HOW WELL THE UH THE FURNISHING AND UH WELL GOES ON
NO
UM
OH NO NO NO
NO THE ROO THE THE BUILDING IS VERY NO ACTUALLY I'VE SEEN IT
UH THE BUILDING IS VERY MODERN AND UH YOU CAN HAVE ACTUALLY WE'LL GET THEM ACTIVATED YEAH
A AND I THINK YOU GET AT LEAST TH YEAH THREE PER ROOM
SO UH OR PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH SOMETIMES HE NEEDS TWO TWO COMPUTERS
YEAH NO THIS THIS
HMM
OH NO UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S DECIDED BY THE UH THE SCHOOL SO THE THE CHAIRS ARE BLUE THE THE DESK IS UH IS BROW WELL LIGHT BROWN
AND UH
UH NORMALLY IT'S DONE AUTOMATICALLY EXCEPT THAT WE'LL HAVE TO THINK
YEAH UH WELL THESE ARE DICTATED BY THE NAMES
UH IT'S PROBABLY MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE LOUNGE
WHAT WE'LL HAVE IS HAVE A BIT LESS FURNITURE IN THE LOUNGE AND THEN BRING ALL THE WELL THE OLD IT'S NOT OLD
BECAUSE WE JUST BOUGHT IT BUT UH ALL THE FURNITURE FROM THE PREVIOUS LOUNGE WE'LL WE'LL BRING IT HERE
UH
WELL IT'S THE FACULTY THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF UH
YEAH YEAH I THINK YEAH I I MEAN IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ISSUE FROM UH YOU KNOW ARRANGING PEOPLE
IT'S JUST UH HOW THE MOVING WILL TAKE PLACE
AND THERE ARE THINGS TO TO TAKE CARE OF BUT UH IT'S UH QUITE UNRELATED WITH THESE THINGS
YEAH WE'LL GET UH WE'LL GET ALL THE INFORMATION
UH THINKING ABOUT INTERNET CONNECTIONS I THINK IT'S QUITE OKAY FOR THE THE FOR THE THE PRINTER TO BE THERE
YEAH I THINK IT'S I IT'S FEASIBLE
WE'LL WE'LL CHECK
SO THE THE VIOLET BOX HERE IS UH UH OUR MAILBOXES ALSO
UM NOT AT THE SIXTH FLOOR
YEAH YEAH NO NOT NOT IN THE BUILDING FOR THE MOMENT
I MEAN NOT AT THIS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL I THINK IT'S A BIT OFF TOPIC ALREADY
SO UM LET'S SAY THAT I IT'S A PROPOSAL
WE'LL TRY IT I'M WELL I'LL TRY TO TO EXPRESS THE THE CONSTRAINTS AND UH YOUR OPINIONS AND UH WELL
I THINK FINALLY EVERYONE CAN VETO SOMETHING IF THERE IS A HUGE PROBLEM BUT I THINK WITH THIS WE WE DON'T RUN INTO HUGE PROBLEMS
YEAH OBVIOUSLY
SO LET ME SAVE THIS
AND THANK YOU FOR SPENDING ALL THIS TIME
HOPE YOU'RE ALL HAPPY
THE THE QUESTION IS IS IT IS IT AGAINST THE REGULATION SECURITY REGULATION OF THE SCHOOL
THAT'S THAT'S THE IMPORTANT POINT
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY OKAY
YES
THAT LOOKS GOOD
PEOPLE SH YEAH THAT'S
LET ME CHECK THAT I I DI I DIDN'T
S
YEAH BUT PUTTING THE PRINTER IN THE LOUNGE IS JUST KILLING THE LOUNGE
IT'S NOT A QUESTION WHERE IT IS IT'S A QUESTION OF YOU ARE PRINTING ALL THE TIME SO
UH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A POSSIBLE
YEAH
WHY NOT
UH I WOULD HAVE I WOULD HAVE A PROVOCATIVE SUGGESTION TO PUT GISELLA TO SWITCH NANCY AND GISELLA
PUT GISELLA THE FAX AND THE PRINTING MACHINE THE PRINTER IN THE ONE PERSON ROOM AS A AS A
OKAY SO THE PRINTER THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE S NOT THE HARD CONSTRAINT BUT UH
'CAUSE I REALLY DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE
AN ADMIN ROOM CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS AN ADMIN ROOM AND ONLY AN ADMIN ROOM WHERE YOU HAVE FILES
WHERE YEAH YOU CAN CLOSE IT YOU HAVE THE PERSONAL FILES OF THE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE OF THE OF THE UNIT ETCETERA ETCETERA
SO FOR INSTANCE I BE FULLY AGAINST THE FACT THAT MY PERSONAL FILES ARE IN F IN A IN A ROOM THAT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED FOR THAT
PRINTER CAN BE IN THE IN THE IN THE CORRIDOR
THAT'S UH THAT'S UH THAT'S PERFECTLY ALRIGHT
I'M PERFECTLY ALRIGHT TO SHARE THE ROOM WITH YOU HAS A VIEW ON THE OLD TOWN
THAT'S UM
YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF WHAT I WAS SAYING LAST TIME WAS THAT YOU HAVE TO SUFFER SOME SUFFER FROM FRO FROM PHONE CALLS
SO IF YOU HAVE A WALKMAN THAT'S THAT'S GOOD
YEAH BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE OKAY SO UH
YEAH BUT FOR PIERRETTE AN AND MAGGIE IT'S UH IT'S
IT'S A WISH OR IT'S UH IT'S BECAUSE THEY
I DIDN'T GET YOUR SOLUTION
WHAT WAS IT AGAIN
SO
AH OKAY
BUT THAT'S NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION OF UH MEN OR WOMEN IT'S MORE THE QUESTION OF AS I SAID THAT'S UH
UM HERE YOU HAVE ONLY P. YOU HAVE P. H. D. STUDENTS THAT ARE A GROUP
THERE YOU HAVE S SENIOR RESEARCHERS THAT ARE A GROUP WHICH IS TO ME MORE
UNLESS IT CORRESPONDS TO SOME SPECIFIC DEMAND LIKE IT IS IN THE CASE IN MAGGIE MAGGIE'S CASE AND PIERRETTE'S CASE
I THINK THAT'S A VERY EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING THINGS BECAUSE
YEAH MM I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH WITH ANDREI SO
SURE BUT UM
BUT ISN'T THERE JUST A A A QUESTION OF PROXIMITY YOU PUT DAVID WITH AGNES
UM BUT ISN'T AGNES WORKING
UM IN A IN A MORE SUBSTANTIAL WAY IN UH WITH PEOPLE LIKE UH EITHER MARIA OR YALINA
'CAUSE
YEAH YEAH I I KNOW
NO THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE
THE OTHER CONSTRAINTS ARE ARE SATISFIED SOMEHOW SO
NO BUT WHAT I MEAN IT WAS WAS THE THREE THE TWO THREE PERSON ROOMS I THINK THAT THEY CAN MIX THEM THE WAY THEY WANT
I MEAN IF THEY PREFER TO BE UH MARIA THA UH YALINA AND NIKOS AND NANCY AND MARIANNE ON THE OTHER SIDE WELL
NO THAT'S NOT COMPLETELY EQUIVALENT BECAUSE NANCY ALL ARE P. H. D. STUDENTS OR MASTERS STUDENTS BUT NANCY
CORRECT
OH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO I WOULD SWITCH DAVID AND NANCY TYPICALLY
WHICH DOESN'T MEAN THAT DAVID SHOULD BE IN THIS ROOM
HE COULD BE IN THE OTHER ONE
FOR ME UH THE TWO THREE PEOPLE ROOMS ARE REALLY THEY HAVE TO BE UH RE SHUFFLED ACCORDING TO PEOPLE PERSONAL PREFERENCES
BUT I DEFINITELY WOULD PUT UH NANCY WITH AGNES IN THE TWO PERSON ROOM
YEAH
BUT AGAIN IT'S ALSO A QUESTION OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE
I MEAN YOU YOU CAN'T BE IN A ROOM WITH PERSON YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WITH
I SEE IF YOU DO IT THIS WAY
YOU MEAN THAT IN THE TWO THREE PEOPLE ROOM THERE WILL BE ONE THAT IS NOT SO OVERLOADED BECAUSE OF DAVID
BECAUSE DAVID WILL BE PART TIME AND THE OTHER ONE NOT SO OVERLOADED BECAUSE THERE IS UH ONE FREE POSITION UH
KNOWING THAT THIS ONE FREE POSITION UH WILL NOT STAY FREE VERY LONG
YES SO
AND THIS IS STILL A WORRY FOR ME BECAUSE WE ARE STILL WE DON'T STILL STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE VISITORS
UNLESS WE PUT THEM IN THE LOUNGE
THEREFORE I W
YEAH
YEAH
WE NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST THREE VISITORS' POSITION BECAUSE POSITIONS BECAUSE
OUTSIDE
YEAH
SO THAT WE KEEP IT YOU MEAN
IT DEPENDS IT DEPENDS ON HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE LOUNGE
IF IT'S THOUGHT AS BEING A READING ROOM
NO
IF IT'S THOUGHT AS THE QUE THAT THAT'S REALLY A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ME
DO WE DO WE PUT PRIORITY ON THE FACT OF BEING ABLE TO READ NEWSPAPERS IN OUR IN OUR OFFICES OR IN OUR UH WORK PLACE
WE CAN READ NEWSPAPERS ELSEWHERE
AND I REALLY DO THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR LAB TO BE ABLE TO DECENTLY UH WELCOME VISITORS THAT COME TO THE LAB THAN TO HAVE A PLACE FOR READING NEWSPAPERS
NEWSPAPERS YOU CAN READ THEM HOME
KNOW WE CAN GO TO THE CAFETERIA OR YOU CAN SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE
YOU CAN GO ON THE BALCONY IF IT'S IF IT'S IN THE SUMMER
SO I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WHY WE SHOULD PUT PRIORITY ON LOUNGES IF WE IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE FOR ACCOMMODATING VISITORS
THAT'S JUST NOT NOT ACCORDING TO MY PRIORITIES
S SO LET'S LET'S PUT THE LOUNGE IN SUSAN'S OFFICE AND SUSAN'S IN SUSAN IN THE LOUNGE WITH THREE VISITORS MM
I WOULD ADVOCATE TO JUST REMOVE THE LOUNGE
WE IT'S A LUXURY FOR US
WE DON'T HAVE SPACE FOR A LOUNGE
IT'S LET'S BE YOU YOU CANNOT YOU CANNOT GO AT THE AT THE AT THE AT THE IN FRONT OF YOUR COLLEAGUES AND SAYING
I P IF I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN UH READING MY NEWSPAPER AND DISC AND HAVING A A DECENTLY WELCOMED UH V UH RESEARCH VISITOR
I PREFER TO READ MY NEWSPAPER
THAT'S JUST NOT THAT'S JUST NOT REALISTIC
I MEAN WE ARE RESEARCHERS
BUT THEN
THEN YOU HAVE THE THREE PEOPLE ROOM THAT POSITIONS
SPLIT IT IN TWO PARTS AS AS SUSAN WAS WAS UH PROPOSING LAST TIME WAS A HA WAS A WALL AND YOU HAVE A LOUNGE THERE CAN READ YOUR NEWSPAPERS AND WE HAVE A FULL TWO ROOM TWO PERSON ROOM WHERE WE CAN CERTAINLY ACCOMMODATE THREE VISITORS
AND AT LEAST WE HAVE SOME UH FREE MARGIN FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS OR THE NEXT YEAR
THE THE THREE PEOPLE OVER THERE
YEAH
AND PUT UH UH MM
THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION IN THE LOUNGE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO READ THEIR NEWSPAPERS
AND TO DRINK THEIR COFFEE
UH SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES
NO THAT'S NOT THAT WASN'T THE GOAL
THE THE GOAL OF THE LOUNGE WAS WAS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN RELAX
YOU CAN DO IT IN YOUR OFFICE
IT'S IT'S IT'S YOU HAVE A GOOD CHAIRS TO READ NEWSPAPERS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK YOU HEART YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR BACK YOUR OFFICE
YES
YES
THREE
NO WE HAVE OUR VISITOR THAT IS ARRIVING
UH WHAT DID YOU SAY SUSAN
UH OKAY
NO NO
THAT COULD TAKE ONE ONE POSITIONS IN THE IN THE LO IN THE
AH OKAY THAT THAT'S AN IDEA
IF IF IF IF YOU FORGET ABOUT THE LOUNGE
WHAT YOU COULD DO IS TO MOVE EITHER MARI MARIA OR YALINA IN THE IN THE MM WHAT IS CURRENTLY THE LOUNGE
THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE ONE PERSON THERE WITH ONE FREE POSITION
WE HAVE ONE FREE POSITION IN THE IN THE ROOM THAT MARIA OR YALINA IS COMING FROM AND ONE FREE POSITION OVER THERE
SO WE HAVE THREE POSITION DISTRIBUTED OVER THE ROOMS WHERE WE CAN ACCOMMODATE
NO LOUNGE
LOUGE
YOU TAKE THE FURNITURE OF THE LOUNGE AND YOU PUT IT IN THE CORRIDOR
YOU YOU WILL EXPLAIN TO YOUR VISITORS THAT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE A POSITION IN THE TOILET BECAUSE THERE IS A READING ROOM WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO RELAX
IT COULD BE NIKOS FOR INSTANCE
COULD PUT YOU CAN SWITCH
BUT IT'S A LOUNGE
YEAH BUT THEN
YEAH YOU COULD YOU COULD PUT ME THERE
I MEAN ANDREI
BECAUSE I WILL BE THERE HALF TIME AND THE VISITORS PROBABLY WILL NOT SO MUCH COMPLAIN ABOUT PHONE CALLS
WELL THERE IS THIS FULL TIME PERSON ARRIVING IN I I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TO PLAN WITH THAT
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE PAOLA IN YOUR OFFICE
'CAUSE THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WE SHOULD BE DECIDING
EITHER YOU WANT TO KEEP ME IN YOUR OFFICE WHICH IS ALRIGHT AND THEN WE HAVE TO FORSEE A PLACE FOR PAOLA SOMEWHERE
I I THINK THAT'S THAT'S NOT REALISTIC TO HAVE A PLANNING
WHY DIDN
YEAH
THAT'S VISITOR ONE
MM
SOMEBODY ELSE
NOT SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO RELAX
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO SEPARATE MA MARIA AND YALINA
WHY
'CAUSE YALINA I IT'S NOT EVEN SURE SHE STAYS
IT'S A MASTER STUDENT SO UH
YEAH
AND WE HAVE YEAH AND WE HAVE TWO VISITORS AND A MASTERS STUDENT AND A P AND A PART TIME PERSON
I WAS THINKING THE OTHER WAY AROUND
TO KEEP PAOLA WITH MARIA IN THE TWO PEOPLE ROOM AND TO HAVE THIS ONE WITH TWO YALINA AND DAVID IN THE THREE PEOPLE ROOM
PAOLA
NO THAT'S A TWO PEOPLE ROOM SO
YEP
NO YALINA IS THERE DAVID IS THERE
BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE TO PUT VISITORS SOMEWHERE I MEAN UH
AH
OH
OKAY
WELL
IT'S A LITTLE BIT CROWDED IN
'CAUSE YOU HAVE WELL NOT YET OF COURSE BECAUSE PAOLA IS NOT HAS NOT ARRIVED BUT UH STARTING FROM JANUARY
YOU WILL HAVE TWO FULL TIME PERSON PLUS ONE PART TIME PERSON PLUS ONE VISITOR THAT'S
'KAY
OKAY
BUT WHY COULDN'T WE BASICALLY
MOVE YOU DAVID IN THIS TWO PEOPLE ROOM WITH MARIA
MARIA PLUS ONE HALF PA UH HALF TIME PERSON
AND YOU HAVE PAOLA YALINA ONE VISITOR POSITION AND I STILL KEEP HOPE THAT UH MARIANNE NIKOS THAT THE LOUNGE WILL ON THE
ON ON THE ON THE LONG TERM DISAPPEAR BECAUSE ANYHOW I DON'T BELIEVE THERE CAN BE A LOUNGE WHERE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE ALREADY TWO PEOPLE WORKING
SO THE LOUNGE WILL JUST DIE AFTER SOME POINT AND IT UH IT
STILL I MEAN
AH OKAY AH IT HAS TWO DOORS
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
AH YEAH BUT THEN THEN YEAH OKAY OKAY
OKAY THAT'S TRUE
'KAY THEN THEN THERE WILL BE A WALL
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S GOOD
UH SHE SHE WA SHE WANTS MIXING PEO UH MEN AND WOMEN SO OR SHE HE
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S TO ME IT'S MORE REALISTIC
YEAH BUT THEN THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN MOVE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU MOVE DAVID TO UH WITH MARIA
THEN
I THINK IT'S IT'S BETTER
FIRST IT'S BETTER
I THINK IT'S UH BECAUSE IT'S MORE IT'S STABLER
'CAUSE VISITORS STAY AND GO
YEAH THAT'S GOOD
TO ME THAT'S THE BEST WE CAN DO
IF YOU IF WE REALISTICALLY CAN PLAN TO HAVE A LOUNGE
OKAY OKAY OKAY
I GO I GOT THE MESSAGE
YES SIR
SO WHO HAS STRONG
STRONG OPPOSITION TO THAT
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY NO
BUT IT'S JUST A DECISION
NO YOU JUST HAVE
OKAY
I THINK WE WE WE ACCOMMODATED MOST OF THE CONSTRAINTS
'CAUSE UH WE ARE SURE THAT MAGGIE AND BRUNO UH MAGGIE IS HAPPY WITH HAVING BRUNO IN HER OFFICE AND PIERRETTE IS HAPPY TO HAVE UH MARIANNE IN HER OFFICE
THAT'S THAT THAT CHECKED
OKAY
AND YES AND NO REASON TO THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE UH UH UH UH AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION
SAME THING FOR MARIANNE AND MARIANNE F. AND NIKOS
UH PAOLA WE DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T ARRIVED YET
AND UH WELL YALINA AHA THAT MEANS FOR A FOR A SHORT TIME YALINA WILL BE JUST ALONE IN THE THREE PERSON ROOM
THAT'S A BIT A PROBLEM
AH BUT THEN THEN WE WHAT WE COULD JUST FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING A DEFENDABLE SOLUTION
UH AS LONG AS PAOLA IS NOT HAS NOT ARRIVED IS TO SWITCH FOR THE PROPOSAL PAOLA AND DAVID
BUT WE WE REALLY PLAN THAT AS SOON AS PAOLA IS HERE OR EVEN EARLIER
DAVID WILL GO TO THE TO THE TWO PEOPLE ROOM
IT'S JUST IT WILL BE SWITCHED
'CAUSE THIS THIS THIS THIS IS DANGEROUS TO PROPOSE
I MEAN YOU HAVE A THREE PER THREE PERSON ROOM WITH ONE MASTERS STUDENT IN IT
OKAY
SO I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T PROPOSE THAT
OKAY
BUT AS SOON AS PAOLA IS HERE
UH IT STARTS TO BE BETTER
AND WE WILL HAVE VISITORS FOR SURE
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
OH YEAH THAT'S A POINT TRUE
AH DO WE HAVE A DO DO WE KNOW DO WE KNOW WHEN WHEN IS SHE SUPPOSED TO FINISH THE HER UH MASTER THESIS
IN JUNE
JUNE NEXT YEAR
OKAY WHA WHEN WHEN DO WE WHEN DO YOU WHEN WHE UH WHEN ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SUB SUMBIT THE PROPOSAL
'KAY THAT'S NOW
OKAY
MM
OKAY
WELL SO AS SOON AS WE HAVE SUSAN WE CAN UH WE CAN UM SO I WOULD I WOULD SWITCH AGAIN
DA BUT THAT AS I SAY IT'S JUST FOR THE SAKE OF THE OF THE PROPOSITION
SO I EVEN I'M EVEN READY TO UH TO INTERNALLY SAY THAT DAVID WILL ACTUALLY BE IN THIS ROOM
WHAT DOES IT WHAT DOES IT CHANGE
NAMES ON THE DOORS
AHA SO IF WE 'CAUSE SUSAN THE THE THE THE PROBLEM THE LET'S SAY THE TECHN NOT THE TECHNICAL
THE PSY PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM WE HAVE IS PRA I'M EXTREMENLY HAPPY WITH THAT SOLUTION
IT WOULD BE A WORKAB WORK WORKING SOLUTION STARTING FROM JANUARY WHEN PAOLA WILL BE HERE
BUT CURRENTLY IF WE PRESENT IT AS IT IS WE HAVE A THREE PERSON ROOM THAT IS ONLY OCCUPIED BY A MASTERS STUDENT
AHA SO SH YOU HAVE A STUDENT
THAT WE THAT'S A REA REAL VISITOR TO SOME EXTENT
AH SO THIS ONE AND THIS TWO ONE ARE JUST AH OKAY OKAY
SO THEN WE WOULD HAVE TWO PEOPLE THERE
OKAY
YEAH THEN THAT WORKS
YEAH BUT YOU YOU REALLY HAVE ALSO TO SAY THAT THAT THAT A A UNIT HAS TO HAS TO HAVE SOME SOME HORIZON
I MEAN UH IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN THE RESEARCH DOMAIN THAT WE CAN HAVE PEOPLE COMING TO VISIT US
UH THE SECOND POINT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT BEFORE YOU GO TO DEFEND IT
YOU SHOULD UH MM CIRCULATE IT UH OVER MAIL TO ALL THE ALL THE CON INVOLVED PEOPLE
TO DOUBLE CHECK SO THAT
I WOULD DO IT BEFORE
'CAUSE YOU IF YOU IF YOU SPEND TIME DEFENDING A THING THEN UM I DON'T KNOW
AGNES COMES TO YOU OR PIERRETTE COMES TO YOU SAYING IT NO I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH MARIANNE
UH WHAT DO YOU DO
SO SO IT DOESN'T
COST ANYTHING IT'S JUST PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT IT SAY OH GREAT
I HAVE A VIEW ON THE MOUNTAIN AND I'M UH WITH A PERSON I LIKE SO I'M HAPPY
BECAUSE
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT COMPLETELY IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE UH I NEED TO KNOW
WHEN I WILL HAVE THE OFFICE DECIDED THE PHONE NUMBER DECIDED
BECAUSE THESE ARE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE TO PROVIDE TO ADMINISTRATION
I'M REACHABLE WHEN I'M AT UH WELL THEY CAN PHONE ME ON THE MOBILE
BUT UH I WOULD DEFINITELY PREFER TO HAVE A CLEAN FILLED ADMINISTRATIVE FORM THAT I CAN GIVE BACK
YES YES
OKAY
AND THEN UH OF COURSE YOU HAVE THESE ALL THESE PRACTICAL ISSUES HOW ABOUT INTERNET CONNECTIONS
WELL UH NETWORK CONNECTIONS I MEAN
YEAH BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING DOUBLE CHECK
YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE IN A ROOM WITH THREE PEOPLE AND ONE NETWORK CONNECTION
WELL NO NO UM
OKAY
BUT ARE THEY ACTIVATED
OKAY
OKAY
AH OKAY
GOOD THAT LOOKS GOOD
AND IF YOU GO BACK TO THE UH TO THE UH OTHER SLI SLIDE WHERE YOU HAVE THE FURNITURE SO WITH THIS UH WE DO WE HAVE ANY M ANY ANY WORD TO SAY AND UH SO THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A RED CHAIR OR A BLUE DESK UH OR A
SO THAT'S THE STANDARD THINGS
BUT DO WE HAVE TO ORDER SOMETHING OR IS IT DONE AUTOMATICALLY SO IT WILL BE IN THE OFFICE WHEN WE MOVE IN
MM-HMM
MM
AND HOW ABOUT THE BOXES BECAUSE AT YOU HAVE TO SAY WHEN YOU WILL BE MOVING THE BOXES SO THAT YOU HAVE UH PEOPLE FOR MOVING THEM
OR HERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MOVE THEM YOURSELF OR
SO WE'LL RECEIVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THAT
OKAY
THAT'S TRUE BUT UH RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
OKAY OKAY
YEAH THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THE THE PRINTER NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED
BY THE WAY UH UH IS THERE ANY UH WIRELESS CONNECTION UH ANTENNAS FOR GETTING 'CAUSE I I'VE I'VE HEARD THAT THERE IS ONE DOWNSTAIRS IN THE
THAT
BUT THAT'S IMPORTANT
I MEAN TYPICALLY FOR THE LAPTOPS IT'S
AH OKAY GOOD
YEAH YEAH
SURE
AT LEAST THE FOUR OF US WILL NOT VETO
AT LEAST
OKAY
THAT WOULD BE FINE IF ONE OF THE PERSON IS FIFTY PER CENT
SO ME FOR EXAMPLE
PLEASE
BECAUSE THE PROFESSORS UH YOU HAVE PERSONAL PRINTER OR THERE IS ONLY ONE PRINTER
BECAUSE IF NOT THE PERSON THE PRINTER CAN GO IN A ROOM OF THREE PEOPLE
THAT'S TYPICAL OF CASE WHERE THERE'S THE LAB AND THERE'S THE PRINTER IS THERE
YEAH OKAY FOR ME UH AS UH I DON'T KNOW L UH THE PEOPLE A LOT
UH YOU SUGGESTED THAT UH THERE'S A LA A LACK OF MEN S SO I WOULD RE CERTAINLY PUT UH NOT TWO MEN IN THE SAME OFFICE
I WOULD TRY TO SHARE THEM WITH THE WOMEN SO UH FOR EXAMPLE IN YOUR SLIDE I COULD UH SWITCH EITHER YOU OR MARTIN WITH UH UH THE OTHER ROOM
THIS ONE
SO
YES PLEASE
YEAH YEAH I WAS WANTING TO CHANGE THIS WA
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT I NEED YOUR UH YOUR SLIDE BECAUSE I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOUR SLIDE
YES SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE THE MEN IS I MEAN THEY ARE ALWAYS SH SHARING THE ROOM WITH A G WITH A WOMAN
I MEAN THERE'S BRUNO ME UH PIERRETTE AND NIKOS IS A GUY ALSO
OH
SORRY FOR THIS
MM-HMM
SO I MEAN THIS IS PERFECTLY FINE I WILL JUST SEND MARTIN AND ANDREI FOR MARIA OR OR YALINA OR NANCY MAYBE
SO
YEAH HERE THERE ARE TWO MEN
SO I MEA YEAH
I IT'S NICE
I DON'T THINK I MEAN THERE'S A LACK OF MEN HERE IN IN IN THIS IN THIS LAB
SO I WOULD CHANGE ONE SWITCH ONE
BUT WE AGREE THAT IT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO TO SHARE THE ROOM WITH SOMEONE THAT HAS THE SAME PROJECT
QUITE HAPPY TO HAVE THE THE FULL ROOM SOME FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TIME
IS THERE ANYONE THAT IS GOING TO FINISH P. H. D. OR OR LEAVE OR
NO BUT A LOUNGE IN A ONE PERSON ROOM IS REALLY TOO SMALL
NO NO I DON'T THINK WE CAN CHOOSE
NO
LET'S PUT M MARIA OR YALINA IN THE IN THE IN THIS PLACE
NO LOUNGE
WELL THE THE LOUNGE CAN NOT BE IN HERE T WITH TWO PEOPLE
I MEAN YOU CANNOT GO THERE AND DISCUSS AND AND TWO PEOPLE WORKING THERE IN THE ROOM
SURE NOT ME
THAT'S TRUE
UH IT'S COMPLETELY FINE
THEN UH THE TWO VISITORS WILL BE IN ONE ROOM BUT DOESN'T THAT'S FINE BECAUSE MAYBE THERE ARE NOT TWO VISITORS AT THE SAME TIME
UH WE'LL SEE
ONE
YEAH YEAH YOU NEED BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU NEED A LAPTOP AND
SO YOU AGREE WITH A LOUNGE
HELLO
YEAH
YEP
UM I'VE GOT A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
SURE
IT'S NOT VERY LONG IN ANY CASE
YEP
YEAH
OKAY SO WHAT I WAS THINKING IS BASICALLY THE PREVIOUS MOVIES THAT WE HAD WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA D UM LAWRENCE OF ARABIA
APOCALYPSE NOW AND AMADEUS WERE FAIRLY HISTORICAL SERIOUS DRAMATIC AND ALSO ACTION EY MOVIES EXCEPT FOR MAYBE AMADEUS
UM THIS MONTH I WAS THINKING OF SELECTING SOMETHING THAT'S MORE IN THE PRESENT TIME STILL DRAMATIC BUT SLIGHTLY LESS SERIOUS
AND WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS SOMETHING OF A THRILLER OR MYSTERY
AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND MYSTERY IS NOT REALLY MYSTERIOUS IN THE MOVIES THESE DAYS THEY KIND OF CAN PREDICT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
UM BUT IN THE NINETIES THERE WERE SOME MOVIES THAT DID HAVE SURPRISE ENDINGS AND THAT PEOPLE CAME OUT SAYING OKAY
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING SO I THOUGHT WE COULD MAYBE SHOW ONE OF THOSE
AND EVEN IF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE A LOT OF THE TIMES YOU GO BACK AND WATCH THE MOVIE AGAIN
AND YOU PICK UP ON THINGS THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE THE FIRST TIME AROUND
OR YOU SEE WHERE THE CLUES WERE AND MM WHAT LED UP TO THE END SO THAT'S MORE ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT I WAS THINKING
AND THE TWO IN PARTICULAR THAT I WOULD PROPOSE ARE
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE THE USUAL SUSPECTS AND THE SIXTH SENSE
UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN ANY OF THEM
UH THE USUAL SUSPECTS WAS DIRECTED BY BRYAN SINGER AND WRITTEN BY CHRISTOPHER MCQUARRIE
IT HAS A FAIRLY LARGE CAST SO I'M NOT GONNA READ ALL OF THEM BUT THE MAIN CHARACTERS ARE KEVIN SPACEY AND GABRIEL BYRNE
AND IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT FIVE CRIMINALS WHO GET SET UP
UM THEY'RE ARRESTED THEY'RE RELEASED FROM PRISON AND THE GET TOGETHER UM AND PLAN A CRIME
AND BASICALLY THE STORY IS TOLD THROUGH THE VIEWS OF ONE OF THE SUSPECTS
UM THE TAG LINE IS KIND OF NEAT FIVE CRIMINALS ONE LINEUP
NO COINCIDENCE AND YOU GET TOLD THE STORY UM AS UH THAT THESE F CHARACTERS ARE BEING CONTROLLED UM BY ONE SORT OF UBER VILLAIN
AND IN THE END YOU FIND WHO THE UBER VILLAIN WAS
AND I KIND OF LIKE THE THE QUOTE FROM ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE THE USUAL SUSPECTS IS THE FRESHEST FUNNIEST
WELL THEY HA HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THE MOVIE
SO I'M NOT GONNA GIVE AWAY YOU WANT ME TO GIVE AWAY THE MOVIE
THAT'LL SPOIL IT
I'LL TELL YOU LATER
BUT THE THE QUOTE FROM ROLLING STONE IS FAIRLY ACCURATE I THINK
IT'S ONE OF THE FRESHEST FUNNIEST AND SCARIEST CRIME THRILLERS TO COME ALONG SINCE PULP FICTION
AND THE OTHER MOVIE IS THE SIXTH SENSE WITH THE FAMOUS LINE I SEE DEAD PEOPLE WHICH THE LITTLE BOY SAYS
UM IT WAS WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY M. NIGHT UH SHYAMALAN AND STARS BRUCE WILLIS
HALEY JOEL OSMENT AND TONI COLLETTE AND AGAIN HAS A NEAT TWIST THAT YOU FIND OUT RIGHT AT THE END
YEAH
YEAH THE SIXTH SENSE WAS VERY COMMERCIAL BUT
ANYWAYS
IT'S THE POSTER FOR THE SIXTH SENSE BUT UNFORTUNATELY I COULDN'T FIND A CLEAR BIG ENOUGH ONE
YEAH
YEAH I TH I THINK IT'S ONLY PART OF A FULL YEAH IT GOES TH THE ALL OF THE SE ALL OF THE SENSES
UM IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE THERE'S SLIGHTLY MORE DETAILED THINGS ABOUT THE MOVIES
SO THE USUAL SUSPECTS IS A HUNDRED AND FIVE MINUTES LONG SO IT'S A DECENT LENGTH OF TIME
IT HAS AN R. RATING SO I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT TYPE OF AUDIENCE WE HAD AT THE LAST
UH SHOWS BUT IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE SUITABLE FOR KIDS
R. IS SORT OF IF YOU'RE EIGHTEEN AND UNDER YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ADULT WITH YOU
IT'S MOSTLY FOR VIOLENCE YEAH IT'S RESTRICTED
UM IT GOT AN EIGHT POINT SEVEN OUT OF TEN ON THE INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE
IT'S THE SIXTEENTH IN THE TOP F TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MOVIES AND FOURTH IN THE TOP MOVIES OF THE NINETIES
IT WON UM A COUPLE OF ACADEMY AWARDS NOTABLY FOR BEST WRITING UM SO THAT'S FOR THE SCRIPT UM AND BEST ACTOR FOR KEVIN SPACEY
MM-HMM
YEAH FOURTH IN THE TOP MOVIES OF THE NINETIES
SIXTEENTH IN THE TOP TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY I THINK OF ALL TIME
YEAH
SO IT WON LOTS OF AWARDS UM IT WON BEST FILM FROM THE BRITISH UM BRITISH FILM ASSOCIATION OR THE BRITISH EQUIVALENT OF THE ACADEMY AWARDS
UM IT WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST FOREIGN FILM FOR THE CESAR
PLENTY OF AWARDS YEAH
I THINK OF ALL TIME YEAH
YEAH
SO
YEAH
YEAH IT'S RATINGS BY VIEWERS AND
YEAH LIKE MEMORIES
YEAH AND FORTY FOUR AS WELL WHICH HAS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SOMETHING VOTES
YEAH SO
YEAH UM
YEAH
NO IT'S A GOOD MOVIE I I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AND I WOULDN'T MIND SEEING IT AGAIN
BECAUSE I DO KNOW THE ENDING AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WATCH IT AGAIN TO SEE WHERE THE HINTS WERE THAT WERE SCATTERED ACROSS THE MOVIE
'CAUSE APPARENTLY THERE ARE HINTS AS TO WHO IT IS
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
AND HE'S THE ONE TELLING THE STORY YEAH
THERE'S HIM AND THE THE GUY IN THE BURN UNIT
THE SECOND MOVIE IS THE SIXTH SENSE
AGAIN IT'S FAIRLY SHORT
IT HAS AN EASIER RATING IT'S P. G. THIRTEEN UM IT'S MUCH LESS VIOLENT
IT GOT AN EIGHT POINT ONE OUT OF TEN
IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIRST IN THE TOP TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND IT'S NINETEENTH ON YOUR LIST I THINK IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
YEAH IT'S NINETEENTH
UM GOT A FAIR NUMBER OF VOTES TOO NINETY SIX THOUSAND
UM AGAIN IT WAS NOMINATED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT ACADEMY AWARDS UM IT DIDN'T WIN ANY
BUT IT GOT A LOT OF BUZZ AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKED IT SO
THOSE ARE MY TWO SELECTIONS AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE PLOT IS A BOY WHO COMMUNICATES WITH SPIRITS THAT DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'RE DEAD
SEEKS THE HELP OF A DISHEARTENED CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST TO FIGURE OUT WHY HE'S SEEING WHAT HE'S SEEING AND
WHAT IT MEANS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S ONLY RIGHT RIGHT AT THE END WHERE YOU FIND OUT REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON AND IT MAKES YOU RETHINK EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED BEFOREHAND
SO THOSE WOULD BE MY TWO SUGGESTIONS AND Y THEY AR THEY ARE SLIGHTLY MORE COMMERCIAL
OR AT LEAS THE SIXTH SENSE IS THAN THE OTHER ONES WE'VE SEEN BUT
YEAH
YEAH THEY WERE THEY WERE NOMINATED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT AWARDS THEY DIDN'T WIN
BUT I GUESS THE COMP I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE COMPETITION WAS THAT YEAR BUT
AND THEY WERE NOMINATED FOR A LOT OF THEM AND UM
YEAH
SO I THINK THAT'S IT UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
YEAH THAT'S IT
YOU SENT YOUR SLIDES AROUND RIGHT
YEAH
NO I HAVEN'T
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT I'VE HEARD IT'S A REALLY POWERFUL MOVIE BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN IT
YEAH IT'S SET IN A JAIL
YEAH
ME
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IT'S A FAIRLY EMOTIONAL MOVIE THOUGH
THAT'S ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT IT'S
YEAH BUT AMADEUS ISN'T REALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EIGHTIES EITHER
YEAH AND ACCORDING TO YOUR THING IT'S NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR SO
NO
IT IS A GOOD MOVIE YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT GETS UPDATED DAILY
YEAH
MM
NO
WAIT HOW MANY OF US SAW SCHINDLER'S LIST
THREE OF US
DID YOU SEE IT
I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY OF US HAVE SEEN
YOU HAVE
YOU HAVE
YOU HAVEN'T
I CAN'T REMEMBER
I THINK ALSO IT'S OLD ENOUGH THAT EVEN IF PEOPLE SAW IT THE FIRST TIME AROUND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
'CAUSE I REMEMBER SEEING IT WHEN IT CAME OUT BUT I DON'T PARTICULARLY REMEMBER
SO WE'VE ALL SEEN IT
IS WHAT
I HAVEN'T I DON'T REMEMBER THE SOUNDTRACK
YEAH I MEAN IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT NONE OF US LIKE WE CAN JUST ELIMINATE IT BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE EVERYTHING 'TILL THE END
NO
YEAH
YEAH IT'S A GANGSTER MOVIE
RAY LIOTTA AND
JOE PESCI I THINK MAYBE
I THINK YEAH ON THE RIGHT AND THE GUY ON THE LEFT IS RAY LIOTTA
I RECOGNISE THEM
I'M A MOVIE BUFF I KNOW WAY TOO MUCH ABOUT MOVIES AND ACTORS AND EVERYTHING
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT
VERY DESCRIPTIVE
NO
A LITTLE BIT
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO THE OTHER KILLER IS HANNIBAL LECTER WHO
YEAH HE'S IN JAIL AND HE'S REAL NO H
HE TRIES TO HELP THE F. B. I. AGENT BUT HE PLAYS HEAD GAMES WITH THE F. B. I. AGENT AT THE SAME TIME
AND SO
WITH HER
HE MANAGES TO FREAK HER OUT
SO
HANNIBAL LECTER IS A VERY
THE MOTH
WHICH THE ONE WHO'S IN JAIL OR THE ONE WHO ANTHONY HOPKINS
I DON'T EITHER
YEAH HE'S SCARY IN THAT MOVIE
YEAH I VAGUELY REMEMBER WHAT IT IS BUT
HOW MANY OF US HAVE SEEN IT
I'M GUESSING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT OR H OKAY
SO HAVE WE ALL SEEN IT
OKAY SO WE'VE ALL SEEN IT
I CAN'T EITHER 'CAUSE I SAW IT RIGHT WHEN IT CAME OUT
IT CAME OUT WHEN NINETY ONE YEAH
SO
YEAH ME TOO
AND AT THAT AGE I WAS LIKE MM
YEAH
THAT WAS VERY GOOD YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SUBURBAN LIFE
THERE'S A LOT OF VERY TRUE THINGS IN IT
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S MUCH LESS DARK THAN THE OTHER MOVIES WE HAVE ON THAT LIST
IT'S NOT WELL IT'S DARK BUT NO
NO
BUT NOT LIKE VIOLENT CUTTING PEOPLE TO PIECES PSYCHOPATHS THEY'RE JUST EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN ISSUES AND
NO
WELL
WITH HI HIS DAUGHTER HIS LIKE TEENAGE DAUGHTER
SO THAT'S THE BEST FRIEND AND HE FANTASISES ABOUT HER AND
MM-HMM
SEE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS MAINSTREAM IN EUROPE LIKE ALL OF THESE MOVIES ARE VERY MAINSTREAM FOR ME
BUT
IT HAS OTHER MOVIES BUT I THINK IT'S PREDOMINANTLY
NO THERE'S MOVIES FROM EVERYWHERE BUT
MM-HMM
YEAH
NO I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT
OH OKAY
THANK YOU
MM-HMM
IT'S V VERY VERY VIOLENT
THE LANDING YEAH
YEAH
THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR KIDS LIKE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THE REDUX VERSION IS LONGER
YEAH
I THINK JUST ONCE FOR THIS
OH MAYBE HE DID
NO FOR E. T. HE DIDN'T
IT WASN'T UNTIL HE STARTED DOING THINGS LIKE SCHINDLER'S LIST AND SAVING PRIVATE RYAN THAT HE ACTUALLY STARTED WINNING AWARDS FOR THEM
DID HE
OH OKAY YEAH
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
THEY RE ENHANCED THE COLOUR YEAH
THAT IT WAS THEIR T. V. S AND NOT
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE 'CAUSE MOST OF THE MOVIE IS THEM FIND TRYING TO FIND HIM ON THE FRONT RIGHT
NO NO
YEAH HE'S TRYING TO FIND HIM
PRIVATE RYAN WAS MATT DAMON I THINK YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IS IT HIM AT THE BEGIN IT'S HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE AT THE AT THE THE GRAVEYARD RIGHT
YEAH WITH HIS FAMILY
YEAH
I HAVE
I DON'T THINK SO
NO IT WAS AN ITALIAN
MM-HMM
YEAH
NO
MM-HMM
MM IT'S JULIANNE MOORE ISN'T IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
I QUITE LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
LOOKS LIKE A C. D. COVER
YEAH
MM-HMM
OH OKAY
I ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE IT
IT LOOKS LIKE TWO YEAH
IT'S IT LOOKS LIKE TWO SEPARATE POSTERS
ALTHOUGH I THINK YOU CAN MIX I WOULD KEEP THE FORMAT OF THE FIRST ONE ADD THE QUOTES AND THE CONTENT INFORMATION FROM THE SECOND ONE
SO TAKE THOSE TAKE THOSE QUOTES GET RID OF THAT SECTION OF TEXT PUT THOSE QUOTES IN THERE
PUT THE THE INFORMATION YOU HAD IN THE SECOND POSTER ABOUT THE MOVIE CLUB
HOW TO JOIN KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE AND KEEP THIS TITLE AND EVERYTHING JUST SLIGHTLY HIGHER UP
I THINK IT DOES
I THINK THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE THE THE STRIP OF FILM AND OR THE STRIP OF PICTURES AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS
YEAH
YEAH SO TAKE ALL OF THAT CONTENT THROW IT UP INTO THE FIRST ONE
AND THEN MAYBE ADD THE QUOTES THAT YOU HAD FROM THE FROM THE FAMOUS DIRECTORS SORT OF AT THE BOTTOM OR SOMETHING
YEAH
USUAL SUSPECTS
MAINLY BECAUSE ONLY TWO OF US HAVE SEEN IT AND IT'S NOT A MAINSTREAM MOVIE
SO I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SEEN IT TO BEGIN WITH
MM-HMM
SO YOU REDUCED THAT BY WHAT TWO
AMERICAN BEAUTY AND
WAIT I'M MISSING ONE
WHAT AM I MISSING PULP FICTION
WAS THAT ONE OF THEM
OKAY
I HAVE SEVEN
OKAY
PULP FICTION
I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF QUENTIN TARANTINO
AND IT DIDN'T MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION
REALLY ELIMINATE PULP FICTION
IT'S GONE
WE'RE ALL GONNA VOTE FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT
I I STILL LIKE THE USUAL SUSPECTS BUT I LIKE AMERICAN BEAUTY TOO
SO
USUAL SUSPECTS
YOU HAVE THE DECIDING VOTE
YEAH
THAT'S FINE
IT'LL MAKE A GOOD CHANGE FROM THE OTHER ONES
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT IT'S YOUR PROBLEM
YEAH
YEAH
ASCENSION
MM 'KAY
OKAY
NINTH NINTH
YEAH TWENTY NINTH
HI
HI EVERYONE
I HAVEN'T
MM-HMM
YES
SO WHO WHO HAS WHAT
ACTUALLY MAYBE UM
UH-HUH
WHAT DO YOU HAVE MIREK
UH-HUH
AND I HAVE A UH WELL JUST A A PIECE OF PAPER WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS
WHAT ABOUT YOU DENIS
UH-HUH
SHOULD WE START WITH THE TWO PRESENTATIONS MAYBE
YEAH
MM-HMM

MM-HMM
SO W WHAT WHAT IS THIS S THE SECOND IMAGE ON THE SLIDE

MM-HMM
SO IT MEANS RESTRICTED
UH-HUH
YEAH BECAUSE YOUR TABLE IS ONLY THE NINETIES YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL
W W
NO NO ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR TABLES
I THINK IT'S A SORT OF UH WELL AVERAGE BETWEEN NUMBER OF VOTES AND AND AND UH YEAH THE THE RATING OR TH THE MARKS
BECAUSE THERE ARE IN YOU TABLE YOU HAVE UH THINGS THAT HAVE VERY FEW VOTES BUT STILL ARE RANKED QUITE HIGH
FOR INSTANCE NUMBER TWENTY FOUR WHICH HAS ONLY FOUR THOUSAND VOTES
BUT UM YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE IT'S JUST THE SEARCH IS COMPENSATED A BIT FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE I I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE JUST TEN VOTES AND YEAH PROBABLY ARE NOT IN THE DATABASE
BUT YEAH ANYWAY IT HAS EXCELLENT VOTES
HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT
MM-HMM
OH
YEP
MM-HMM
THE LAST SENTENCE FROM THE MOVIE OR OH
W
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO THESE GUYS WERE ACTUALLY NOMINATED SO THE THE BOTTOM PART OF YOUR SLIDE ACTUALLY IT SAYS YEAH SO THESE ARE THE BEST AWARDS THEY HAD
OKAY
TOO BAD
WELL THERE IS JUST ONE WINNER SO
UH-HUH
OKAY
YEAH I THINK YOUR TABLE IS VERY CLEAR DENIS
NO I HAVEN'T
YEAH
W WHAT IS THE NAME IN FRENCH 'CAUSE
UH-HUH
UH YEAH
YEAH
WELL ACTUALLY YOUR THIRD SLIDE HAS THE PLOT SO UH
YEAH
OH YEAH EXACTLY YEAH
SO YEAH THIS GUY IS JAILED OKAY UH-HUH
WOW
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH I HAVEN'T SEEN I HEARD ABOUT IT BUT
MM-HMM
YEP
YEAH
UM I THINK THERE WAS A CELEBRATION OF UH SIXTY YEARS FROM THE LIBERATION OF THE CAMPS ACTUALLY
BECAUSE THEY WERE LIBERATED BEGINNING FORTY FIVE AND UH YEAH IT'S NOT BAD
AND IT'S ALSO I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA AT AT LEAST FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IT'S COHERENT WITH THE PREVIOUS FILMS LIKE HISTORY IM MAJOR EVENTS
I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO KEEP THIS COHERENCE OR CHANGE RADICALLY BUT MAYBE YEAH THAT'S YEAH I THINK IT'S A DRAWBACK UH
WELL OF THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTIES
YEAH
MAYBE IT'S REPRESENTATIVE OF A STYLE OF THE EIGHTIES I DON'T KNOW
AS FOR AMADEUS BUT UH THAT'S I DON'T KNOW
BUT
YEAH HARD TO TELL
MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S FUNNY ACTUALLY UM BECAUSE ON YOUR ON YOUR SLIDES ACTUALLY THE RATINGS ARE EIGHT POINT SEVEN FOR BOTH
NO THEY HAVE THE SAME USUAL SUSPECTS AND PULP FICTION BOTH ARE AT EIGHT POINT SEVEN
BUT ON DENIS'S TABLE UH THIS ONE IS AT EIGHT POINT SIX
WHO KNOWS MAYBE PEOPLE VOTED FOR IT YEAH
COULD HAVE CHANGED IN THE MEANWHILE
THOUGH WITH ONE HUNDRED AND THOUSAND VOTES IT SHOULDN'T CHANGE TOO MUCH
I MEAN GIVEN THE NUMBER OF VOTES I WONDER BUT ANYWAY IT'S M IT MAY CHANGE I THINK YEAH
OKAY
WOW
THAT'S ENCOURAGING
NO
HAVEN'T
UH I I'VE SEEN VERY FEW MOVIES FROM THE LIST ABOUT TEN OUT OF THE FIRST FIFTY
OKAY YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH I'VE SEEN IT THIS ONE
I I LIKE IT VERY MUCH
I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN IT
WELL IT'S PLENTY OF WELL KNOWN SONGS AND YOU KNOW THE TWIST THING AND
OH I WOULD KEEP IT AS A CANDIDATE BUT I DON'T KNOW
I THINK FOR THE MOMENT M M GUESS MOST OF THESE ARE CANDIDATES SO WE'LL TRY TO
YEAH WE SHOULD PROBABLY VOTE AFTER EVERYONE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
NO
I YOU YOU RECOGNISE THEM OR YOU CAN READ THE THE TEXT ON THE IMAGES
OH OKAY
HUH
VERY WELL
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
OKAY
NO YEAH SO PROBABLY NOT UH
SO
WHO IS IN PRISON ACTUALLY
YEAH
NO NO
HE TRIES TO DECRYPT THE THE THE OTHER KILLERS' BEHAVIOUR
YEAH
WELL NOT VERY NASTY ONES
OR DOES HE I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S BASICALLY THE POINT YEAH
MM-HMM
SO ON THE PICTURE YOU CAN SEE UH JODIE FOSTER AND UH HA HA
TH TH THE MOTH
ANTHONY HOPKINS
THE OTHER ONE I DON'T REMEMBER
WE DON'T SEE ANY H SEE HIM VERY OFTEN
BUT IT'S
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT THE PLOT IS QUITE HORRIBLE
I MEAN THE NOT THE PLOT BUT THE WHAT THE THE ACTIVE KILLER WANTS TO DO IS QUITE HORRIBLE AND
MM
OKAY
YEAH I'VE SEEN IT
I THINK I'VE SEEN IT A SECOND TIME ON T. V. BUT MAYBE NOT ENTIRELY
THEY'RE MUCH TOO YOUNG
INDEED
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT SO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO IT'S NOT VERY VIOLENT REALLY
AH OKAY GREAT
MM-HMM
OKAY YEAH
UH-HUH
AND WHAT ABOUT THE WELL THAT PICTURE WITH THE THE GIRL AND DO YOU SEE NAKED PEOPLE IN THE MOVIE OR IS IT ABOUT SEX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AH OKAY
SUPPOSEDLY
OKAY
UH-HUH
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE OF BRINGING NEW THINGS TO THEM BUT ALSO MAKING THEM ENJOY THE SHOW
SO THAT THEY COME TO OUR MOVIE CLUB SO YEAH
I THINK WE SHOULDN'T MAYBE DO VERY MAINSTREAM MOVIES BUT WELL OKAY THE LIST HERE IS QUITE UH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF VOTES HERE
UH
YEAH
UH REGARDING THE DENIS'S TABLE I WOULD SAY GIVEN THAT THIS SITE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MAINLY AMERICAN BUT UH I WOULD SAY THAT
YEAH I THINK MM YEAH IT'S ENGLISH SPEAKING ANYWAY SO UH THOUGH SO
YEAH BUT IF YOU LOOK AT
YEAH BUT I WOULD SAY MAINSTREAM ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE MORE THAN WHATEVER SIXTY THOUSAND VOTES
AND YOU CAN SEE SOME MORE WELL CONFIDENTIAL FILMS THAT HAVE LIKE TEN THOUSAND
TWENTY THOUSAND LIKE MM PRINCESS MONONOKE TWENTY THOUSAND AND UH WHATEVER THE THE KIESLOWSKI AT ELEVEN THOUSAND THE TROIS COLEURS ROUGE
YEAH IT'S NOT BAD AT ALL YEAH
SO YEAH ANYWAY IF YOU WANT A DEFINITION OF MAINSTREAM OR WHATEVER
MM-HMM
YEP
D UH DANISH I THINK IT'S THE DOGMA MOVEMENT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH LET'S UH
YEAH SO IT'S UH ACTUALLY I HAVE MADE I HAVE MADE PHOTOCOPIES
I HAVE THEM DENIS SO IT'S ALL FOR YOU
ACTUALLY I I TRIED TO PROPOSE JUST ONE MOVIE WITH SOME ALTERNATES
UH YOU WANT ONE
UM SO MY PROPOSAL WHICH IS ONLY A PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON UM UH MORE OR LESS HISTORY AND ACTION
SO LAWRENCE OF ARABIA WAS OKAY ABOUT THIS GUY DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR SO IT HAPPENS
OKAY OUTSIDE EUROPE AND THE STATES BUT UH IT'S A PIECE OF HISTORY
UH APOCALYPSE NOW IT'S UH VIETNAM IF I'M UM CORRECT AND OKAY AMADEUS
THAT'S MUCH UH MUCH EARLIER AND IT'S NOT ABOUT IT'S NOT VIOLENT WHICH IS A NICE THING I THINK
BUT UM GIVEN THAT WE WOULD LIKE A MOVIE FROM THE NINETIES I THOUGHT THE SAVING PRIVATE RYAN OH THANKS FOR PROJECTING THE DOCUMENT
UM WOULD KEEP THIS MORE OR LESS THIS THEME OF UH HISTORY AND WAR AND ACTION DRAMA
WHILE SHOWING ACTUALLY A VERY NEW AND I WOULD SAY HUMANISTIC VIEW ON ON WAR
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE THE SORT OF GLORIFICATION OF UH YOU KNOW THE GOOD GUYS THAT THAT UH WELL GO AGAINST THE NAZIS
BUT UH IT'S UH IT'S WELL THE PLOT ACTUALLY IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE LOOKING FOR JUST ONE SOLDIER IN FACT IT'S UM IT'S ABOUT A A FAMILY OF FOUR BROTHERS
WHO ACTUALLY THREE OF THEM GET KILLED DURING THE WAR IN THESE DAYS OF FORTY WELL
I GUESS SUMMER FORTY FOUR AND THE UH WELL THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES THAT THEY NEED TO GET BACK THE FOURTH BROTHER JUST TO SAVE ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
AND THIS THIS GUY IS PRIVATE RYAN
SO THE MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT KILLING THE GERMANS OR WHATEVER IT'S ABOUT SAVING AT LEAST ONE GUY FROM A FAMILY
SO BUT OF COURSE THE THE SETTING IS DURING THE WAR AND UM IT'S VERY REALISTIC AND UH VERY DRAMATIC IN FACT
IT'S UM IT'S NOT AT ALL A GLORIFICATION OF WAR BUT IT'S JUST UH IT SHOWS A BIT UH THE VIOLENCE OF UM OF THE THINGS
AND ESPECIALLY THE THE BEGINNING IS UH I THINK IT'S GREAT IT'S IT'S VERY VIOLENT BUT IT'S IT'S AN IMAGE OF OF WAR
IT'S UH
YEAH BUT I THINK IF MM WELL IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH
IT YEAH IT'S THE LANDING AND ACTUALLY EVERY MORE OR LESS EVERYONE GETS KILLED AND
OH I I DIDN'T KNOW BUT YEAH ACTUALLY IT'S VERY WELL FILMED AND IT'S VERY REALISTIC
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COMPARE WITH I DON'T KNOW IN LAWRENCE OF ARABIA I THINK THEY HAVE SOME BATTLES AND CAMELS
I KNOW IT'S VERY NICE SOMEONE FALLS SOMEWHERE THERE AND WELL YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE BATTLES THAT LOOK NICE BUT THIS ONE DOESN'T LOOK NICE
AND I THINK IT'S UH IT'S ALSO MAYBE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NINETIES YOU KNOW PEOPLE STARTING TO GET THE MORE UH REALISTIC VIEW OF UH OF OF WAR
BUT IT'S TRUE IT'S IT'S A BIT VIOLENT AND SO WHAT I PUT HERE IT'S A BIT LONG TOO IT'S NEARLY THREE HOURS
BUT UH I DON'T KNOW APOCALYPSE NOW IS QUITE LONG TOO I THINK
I DON'T REMEMBER
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO IT WON UH FIVE OSCAR PRIZES UH BEST DIRECTOR FOR STEVEN SPIELBERG UM BEST CIMENA CINEMATOGRAPHY ETCETERA
UH
I DON'T KNOW
OH
HMM
MM-HMM
UM OKAY SO UM YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE POINT IT'S IT'S A BIT GREY AND ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT MY SECOND PAGE
UH IN THE TRIVIA I FOUND OUT THAT IN FACT THEY UH ACTUALLY REDUCED THE THE COLOUR SATURATION OF THE MOVIE
JUST TO MAKE IT LOOK MAYBE A BIT LIKE THE DOCUMENTARIES FROM THE TIME
YEAH I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO FIND THIS UH IT'S
THEY THEY TURNED BACK THE COLOURS FOR UH
YEAH
YEAH
SO THIS UH FACT NUMBER TWO I THINK OBVIOUSLY FOR I MEAN TECHNICAL PEOPLE LIKE US IS UH IS IS IS QUITE FUNNY
SO YEAH
SO I I MEAN THESE FOUR POINTS COULD SERVE ALSO AS AN INTRODUCTION IF YOU WANT TO TALK F FO FOR FI FIVE OR TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE MOVIE
I DON'T KNOW IN IN THE ROOM
SO UH YEAH MM SO THA THIS WOULD BE MY CANDIDATE BUT I'M VERY MUCH OPEN TO
MM-HMM
YEAH ON TH ON YEAH ON THE PICTURE ACTUALLY YEAH IT'S TOM HANKS
IN FACT YOU YOU DON'T SEE UH PRIVATE RYAN UNTIL THE END MORE OR LESS OR YOU SEE MM BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR HIM YEAH
MM-HMM
NO TOM TOM
YEAH
WELL THE CAPTION SAYS CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER SO
SO I IF YOU LOOK AT THE CAPTION UM YEP
SO HE'S UH HE'S
YEAH SO THE PRIVATE IS JUST A SIMPLE SOLDIER ACTUALLY
YEAH
UH WHO PRIVATE RYAN OR NO NO THEY FIND HIM ACTUALLY AND THEY SEND HIM BACK TO THE FAMILY BUT THE CAPTAIN DIES ACTUALLY TOM HAN
L
OH YEAH IT'S PRIVATE RYAN YEAH REMEMBERING AT THE BEGINNING
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH HE DIES UNFORTUNATELY
SO YEAH THERE IS SACRIFICES AND
MM-HMM
OH
MM-HMM

YEAH
OKAY SO YEAH SO I HAVE SOME OTHER CANDIDATES UM IT'S ON FIRST PAGE AT THE BOTTOM
UH I ALSO PUT PULP FICTION UH THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS AND I ALSO WELL SORT OF INCLUDED LA VITA E BELLA
BUT I KNOW WE'RE AN ENGISH MOVIE CLUB SO I GUESS IT'S UM IT'S A BIT OUT OF PURPOSE
BUT IT
OH IT'S UH IT'S ABOUT AGAIN ABOUT THE CAMPS AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR
SO IT'S ABOUT UH A FAMILY OF ITALIANS WHICH UH G ARRIVES INTO A A DEATH CAMP AND IN FACT IT'S TREATED IN A MORE OR LESS HUMOROUS MODE
SO UM THE FATHER TRIES TO HIDE FROM I FROM HIS BOY THAT THEY ARE IN A DEATH CAMP
AND IT'S THIS VERY STRANGE MM WELL NOT REALLY HUMOUR BUT RELATION BETWEEN THE UH HOW
WELL THE BOY GETS SAVED BUT THE FATHER DIES
YEAH
SO I DON'T KNOW I IT CREATED SOME CONTROVERSIES I THINK BECAUSE PEOPLE SAID YOU SHOULDN'T DO ANY FORM OF HUMOUR RELATED TO THE CAMPS
BUT IT'S VERY VERY MOVING SO I THINK IT'S ANYWAY UM ITALIAN SO

IT'S THE IT'S THE SECOND ONE OR
UH-HUH
AH OKAY OKAY
UH-HUH
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I THINK THIS IS NOT BAD BECAUSE THEY SAY SOMETHING LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR UH MOVIE CLUB AND UH YEAH
THE BIG LEBOWSKI IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S A MOVIE AND UH I GUESS THE PEOPLE CAN REMEMBER THAT IT WAS A MOVIE AT LEAST
EVEN IF THEY HAVEN'T SEE IT
CD COVER
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT I ON THE CONTRARY I WOULD SAY THERE IS TOO MANY COLOURS AND UH IT'S DIFFICULT TO READ AND UH
YEAH THAT WOULD BE THE BEST
YEAH ALL THIS INFORMATION AND PUT INTO THE FIRST ONE
MM-HMM
IF IF THEY FIT THERE IF THEY FIT THERE YOU WILL SEE
MM-HMM
SO BIG LEBOWSKI
MM-HMM
OKAY GOOD IDEA
SO I'M REALLY CONVINCED BY THE BIG LEBOWSKI
I YES YEAH I I WOULD LIKE TO UH YEAH AT LEAST TO HAVE IT UH IN THE
IN THE NOMINEES EXACTLY AND UH I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER ALL OF THEM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
AND THEN I'M STILL HESITATING BETWEEN THE SCHINDLER'S LIST AND THE S UH SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
MAY I NOMINATE UH THESE ALL THESE THREE MOVIES BIG LEBOWSKI SCHINDLER'S LIST AND THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
MM-HMM
SO ELIMINATE FIRST ELIMINATE FIRST
MM-HMM
I'M SORRY COULD YOU GO T UH UH UH ONCE AGAIN THROUGH UH THE LIST OF THE MOVIES
BECAUSE I DON'T OR I IS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT THEM ON THE ON THE ON THE UH WHITEBOARD

SAVING PRIVATE RYAN

PULP FICTION OKAY

HOW MANY
OKAY WE AMERICAN BEAUTY
OKAY
YEAH AND I WOULD ELIMINATE
YEAH
AND I WOULD ELIMINATE PULP FICTION ACTUALLY AS WELL IF SO
ANOTHER ONE
BECAUSE IT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
MM
I VOTE FOR BIG LEBOWSKI
MAKE A DECISION
ALREADY READY YEAH
SO
SO IT'S GONNA TO BE BIG LEBOWSKI
OKAY
NO NO NO NO NO I I LIKE IT I LIKE IT
OKAY BEGINNING OF MAY BUT THERE ARE THERE IS PLENTY OF HOLIDAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF MAY NO
ASCENSION
MM-HMM
OKAY OKAY NO PROBLEM
GOOD
TWENTY NINE
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
I WANT TO SEE IT
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE THE MINUTES
GOOD
HELLO
UM I DON'T DO YOU HAVE AN EXTRA COPY
THANKS
OKAY
SURE
OKAY SO THE PREVIOUS MOVIES THAT WE'VE DONE THIS YEAR WERE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA APOP APOCALYPSE NOW AND AMADEUS
WHICH WERE ALL HISTORICAL SERIOUS DRAMATIC AND SOMEWHAT ACTIONY MOVIES
SO FOR THIS MONTH I PROPOSE DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT PREFERABLY SOMETHING SET IN THE PRESENT UM SOMETHING MAYBE DRAMATIC BUT SLIGHTLY LESS SERIOUS
SO WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS ACTUALLY A THRILLER OR A MYSTERY
AND WHILE THESE DAYS PEOPLE ARE SO JADED BY GENERAL MOVIES THAT THEY TEND NOT TO BE SURPRISED BY THE ENDINGS IN MYSTERIES
SOME MOVIES IN THE NINETIES DID ACTUALLY HAVE TWISTS THAT PEOPLE CAME OUT SAYING NEVER SAW THAT COMING I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN
AND SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS PRESENT YOU TWO OF THOSE MOVIES AND BEFORE ANYONE SAYS THAT WELL
IF YOU KNOW TH HOW THE MOVIE ENDS YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANNA SEE IT AGAIN THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO RE WATCH MOVIES UM TO SEE WHERE THE CLUES WERE
WHAT THEY MISSED THINGS THEY DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE FIRST TIME AROUND
UM SO IF YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS EITHER THE USUAL SUSPECTS OR THE SIXTH SENSE
UM THE USUAL SUSPECTS IS SLIGHTLY LESS MAINSTREAM
UM IS HAS A FAIRLY LARGE CAST NOTABLY KEVIN SPACEY GABRIEL BYRNE
UM AND IT WAS DIRECTED BY BRYAN SINGER IT'S ONE OF HIS EARLIER MOVIES I THINK
IT WAS WRITTEN BY QUIST CHRISTOPHER MCQUARRIE
UM AND ACCORDING TO ROLLING STONE IT'S THE FRESHEST FUNNIEST AND SCARIEST CRIME THRIL THRILLER TO COME ALONG SINCE PULP FICTION
UH THE SIXTH SENSE ON THE OTHER HAND IS A MORE COMMERCIAL MOVIE WITH ITS FAMOUS LINE I SEE DEAD PEOPLE
UM IT WAS WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY M. NIGHT UH SHYAMALAN AND STARS BRUCE WILLIS HALEY JOEL OSMENT AND TONI COLLETTE
AND IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO SEES DEAD PEOPLE AND I HE SEES A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST TO TRY TO GET HIM TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE SEES THE DEAD PEOPLE
WHAT IT MEANS
NOW THAT YOU'VE GIVEN AWAY THE TWIST YES
UM
YEAH
SEND YOUR COMPLAINTS TO ROLLING STONE
SO ON THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES I'LL JUST GO THROUGH SOME OF UM MORE DETAILED STUFF THAT WE MIGHT NEED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES
UM THE LENGTH FOR THE USUAL SUSPECTS UM IS A HUNDRED AND FIVE MINUTES
UH AS YOU CAN S WELL AS ANDREI ALREADY SAID IT'S N NINETEEN NINETY FIVE
IT HAS AN R. RATING WHICH MEANS THAT AT LEAST IN THE IN NORTH AMERICA IT WAS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE UNDER EIGHTEEN
'CAUSE IT'S FAIRLY VIOLENT BUT NOT SO VIOLENT AS OTHER MOVIES
UM PLOT OUTLINE UH FIVE VILLAINS IN NEW YORK ARE ROUNDED UP BY THE POLICE IN AN UNCONVENTIONAL MANNER THAT WORRIES THEM
AFTER RELEASE THEY GET TOGETHER FOR A SPOT OF REVENGE BUT SOMEONE ELSE IS CONTROLLING EVENTS
AND THE BIG MYSTERY OF THE MOVIE IS WHO'S CONTROLLING THE EVENTS
UM IT GOT AN EIGHT POINT SEVEN OUT OF TEN USER RATING ON THE INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE
IT'S SIXTEENTH IN THE TOP TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MOVIES OF ALL TIME
FORTH IN DENIS'S LIST OF THE TOP MOVIES OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHICH I THINK WAS ALSO TAKEN FROM I. M. D. B.
UM IT WON SEVERAL ACADEMY AWARDS INCLUDING BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR AND BEST WRITING
UM BEST FILM FOR THE BRITISH EQUIVALENT OF THE ACADEMY AWARDS IT WAS NOMINATED FOR A CESAR FOR BEST FOREIGN FILM
SO IT GOT A FAIR BIT OF RECOGNITION DESPITE NOT BEING
UM A VERY MAINSTREAM HIGH BUDGET MOVIE OR MAYBE BECAUSE IT WASN'T A MAINSTREAM HIGH BUDGET MOVIE
I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT IN FACT OTHER THAN
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU'VE SEEN IT
AND DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT IT'S NOT A VERY VERY WELL KNOWN MOVIE
WHAT
IS IT
SEE
REALLY
THAT SURPRISES ME I ALWAYS GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS
YEAH
WELL IT'S A GOOD MOVIE
YEAH
YEAH
SO BUT I THINK THE MAIN THING IS IT'S GOT A GOOD TWIST AT THE END AND
IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING MOVIE TO WATCH
UM SO IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
MORE OR LESS THE SAME THING FOR THE SIXTH SENSE
IT'S SLIGHTLY NEWER NINETEEN NINETY NINE MORE OR LESS THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
IT HAS A LOWER RATING 'CAUSE IT'S LESS VIOLENT BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT AUDIENCE WE ARE GONNA HAVE AT THE SHOWINGS
IT HAS IT'S SCARY AND I THINK IT HAS SOME SORT OF SLIGHT VIOLENCE BUT
YEAH BUT THEY'RE NOT VIOLENTLY DEAD
IT'S IT'S MORBID AND IT'S CREEPY BUT IT'S NOT VIOLENT AS IN PEOPLE BEING SLICED IN HALF OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
UM UM IT'S NINETEENTH IN THE TOP MOVIES OF THE NINETIES
HUNDRED FIRST IN THE TOP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY IT WAS NOMINATED FOR A LOT OF AWARDS IT DIDN'T WIN
AS MANY
MIGHT HAVE WON MORE SORT OF MINOR AWARDS BUT AT LEAST THE ACADEMY AWARDS IT WAS NOMINATED FOR FIVE OF THEM UM BUT DIDN'T WIN
NEVERTHELESS STILL A GOOD MOVIE STILL A GOOD TWIST AT THE END WHICH DENIS ALREADY GAVE AWAY
GOOD
UM SO THOSE WOULD BE MY TWO CHOICES
LET IT'S A SORT OF DIFFERENT STYLE FROM THE OTHER MOVIES WE'VE SEEN AND THEY HAVE A TWIST
SO IT'S NOT YOUR GENERAL MOVIE WHERE YOU JUST KIND OF SIT THROUGH IT AND GO OH OKAY GET UP AND LEAVE
IT'S AT LEAST OUT OF THOSE TWO MOVIES I CAME OUT THINKING OH COOL OKAY
YEAH BUT
I MEAN THAT'S A GOOD THING RIGHT
YES
YEAH
WHICH IS A GOOD MARKETING PLOY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
YEAH BRUCE WILLIS IS AND THE KID IS REALLY GOOD WHO PLAYS THE THE MAIN CHARACTER
YEAH YEAH
SAME GUY
NO
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT BUT
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK IT'S ABOUT THREE HOURS LONG SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND IT'S A HEAVY MOVIE I IT'S EMOTIONAL IT'S
I THINK IT DID
EITHER FOR DIRECTOR IF NOT FOR BEST PICTURE
YEAH
MM
YEAH I'VE SEEN IT
YEAH YEAH THAT WAS HIS COMEBACK MOVIE YEAH
YEAH
IT'S UMA THURMAN YEAH
UH MAYBE 'CAUSE I. M. D. B. IS UPDATED DAILY SO IF IT HAPPENS THAT PEOPLE HAD VOTED FOR IT
MM-HMM
HAVE YOU
BUT IT IS THIS MOVIE
AH OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
NO IT'S LATER THAN THAT ISN'T IT
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW BUT IT WAS A GOOD PERFORMANCE CREEPY
YEAH
I THINK SO YEAH
WHEN DID IT COME OUT
YEAH
AS ARE WE ALL
YEAH ME TOO
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN IT SINCE THEN
AH
NO ON THE SECO UH SECOND ONE
YEAH
IT WASN'T THAT GOOD BUT I THINK IT WAS ALMOST MORE DISGUSTING IN A WAY
THERE WERE SOME SCENES IN IT WHERE NORMALLY I DON'T GET QUEASY WATCHING MOVIES BUT THAT WAS JUST TOO MUCH
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT TOO VIOLENT
FOR I DUNNO
YEAH
THAT'S A GOOD MOVIE
YEAH IT'S KEVIN SPACEY
QUITE POSSIBLY YEAH
YEAH
THEORETICALLY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MORGAN FREEMAN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL LET'S GO THROUGH THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS
I DO
YEAH
MM-HMM
UP CLOSE
YEAH
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN COMPARE THEM
ALSO SETS THE MOOD A LITTLE BIT
DARKER AND
YEAH BUT YOU'D GET A DIFFERENT IMPRESSION IF YOU HAD BRIGHT BLUE SKY AND BRIGHT SUNSHINE BEHIND IT
MM-HMM
YEAH HE'S PRIVATE RYAN
WELL
THEY'RE BEING SENT TO THE FRONT BEHIND ENEMY LINES TO RETRIEVE ONE SOLDIER ONLY BECAUSE ALL OF HIS OTHER BROTHERS DIED
MOST OF THEM GET KILLED DON'T THEY
YEAH
YEAH
MM MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
I TRIED TO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OR IS THAT THE OTHER LEBOWSKI
OH OKAY
BUSCEMI YEAH
REALLY
MM-HMM YEAH
I THINK IT LOOKS TOO MUCH LIKE A C. D. COVER THOUGH
I LIKE THE LAYOUT OF THE FIRST ONE AND THE CONTENT OF THIS ONE
IT LOOKS LIKE TWO DIFFERENT POSTERS THOUGH
IT'S HARD TO READ
THE PARAGRAPH I THINK WAS A LITTLE BIT LONG
I WOULD AND CONTENT OF THE SECOND ONE
YEAH
YEAH LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE THERE
AND THEN MAYBE REPLACE THE PARAGRAPH THAT YOU HAD ON THE FIRST POSTER WITH EITHER SHORTER SORT OF DESCRIPTIONS
NOT EVEN OF THE WHOLE PLOT BUT JUST DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MOVIE OR 'CAUSE I THINK THAT PARAGRAPH IS TOO LONG
PEOPLE DON'T R GENERALLY JUST STAND THERE AND THEN READ THE WHOLE THING
MM-HMM
IT'S HERE FORTY EIGHT
I HOPE MORE PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT
MM-HMM
UM I'D GO FOR SIXTH SENSE JUST BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHER ONES AND
MAYBE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION JUST BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY UM
OKAY
OKAY UM
SO I'LL
I'LL GIVE TWO TO AMERICAN BEAUTY AND
MM
ONE TO THE BIG LEBOWSKI
OKAY SO IT'S PRETTY CLEAR
AMERICAN BEAUTY

OKAY

MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT

SO THAT'S YOUR IMPRESSION

WELL
MM-HMM
YEAH I'VE SEEN IT TOO
YEAH IT'S IT'S VERY GOOD AND IT'S A BIT VIOLENT BUT IT'S ALSO QUITE FUNNY I THINK
IT'S A
MM-HMM
YEAH
THE BOXER
PARDON
YEAH AS THE BOXER
UH UMA THURMAN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S STRANGE WITH SO MANY VOTES THAT THEY CAN P SHIFT
I MEAN STATISTICALLY SPEAKING IT'S STRANGE
MM-HMM
WOW
MM
BUT IT WAS THAT MOVIE
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
NOT REALLY IN FAVOUR OF THIS BUT
AH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK YEAH WHEN YEAH I SAW THIS MOVIE SOME TIME AGO AND YEAH SHE LOOKED QUITE YOUNG I THOUGHT
NINETY ONE
MM-HMM
OKAY
OH YEAH I'VE SEEN IT YEAH
YEAH IT'S A GOOD MOVIE I UM I DON'T KNOW MAYBE TOO WELL KNOWN BUT SINCE IT'S FIFTEEN YEARS OLD MAYBE PEOPLE WOULD LI
YEAH
MM-HMM
OH AGAIN
MM-HMM
I SEE
S MM-HMM MM-HMM
AH THAT'S THE GIRL WHO IS REPRESENTED ON THE THE PICTURE
YOU RECOGNISE HER BELLY
UH
OH SO YOU RECOGNISE THE ROSE
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH BUT DIDN'T I MEAN I SEE THIS NAME OF THE THE DIRECTOR ON THE SLIDE BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW HIM
FRANK DARABONT
NEVER HEARD OF THIS GUY
MM-HMM
YEAH I'M NOT SURE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH MAYBE
BUT IT'S TRUE YEAH WE SHOULDN'T STICK TO ONLY VERY HIGHLY RATED MOVIES ON THIS TABLE
THOUGH IT'S A VERY USEFUL TABLE BUT UM OKAY DO YOU WANT ME TO YEAH
SO YEAH UH I WROTE SOME NOTES ON UM ON SAVING PRIVATE RYAN WHICH IS MY CANDIDATE
IF YOU CAN DISPLAY THEM IT'S PERFECT
UH DO YOU ALL HAVE A COPY OF THEM
I HAVE SOME PAPER COPIES
UH YOU'RE WELCOME
SO ACTUALLY GIVEN THAT MORE OR LESS OUR THEME SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WAS UM HISTORY DRAMA ACTION AND GIVEN ALSO THAT WELL
WE DECIDED TO TO PRESENT THIS MONTH A MOVIE FROM THE THE NINETIES
UM I THOUGHT THAT AMONG THESE MOVIES WHO LOOK QUITE POPULAR UH SAVING PRIVATE RYAN WOULD BE A VERY GOOD CANDIDATE
UM
ACTUALLY IT'S A MOVIE I'VE SEEN
HAVE YOU SEEN IT BEFORE
OKAY SO YOU'VE ALL SEEN IT SO MAYBE EVERYONE HAS SEEN IT I'M NOT VERY SURE
UM BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY NOVEL TREATMENT OF OF WAR
IT'S UH IT'S NO LONGER THE B GLORIFICATION OF UH WHATEVER COMBAT AND VICTORY BUT THE PLOT IS QUITE DIFFERENT
IT'S ABOUT SAVING ONE PERSON WHO HAS A SPECIAL SPECIAL VALUE IN THE IN THE MOVIE UM IF ONLY BECAUSE HIS BROTHERS ACTUALLY WERE ALL KILLED
SO UH THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THEY SHOULD SAVE AT LEAST ONE PERSON FROM THE FAMILY
AND SAVING MEANS ACTUALLY REMOVING FROM THE THE FRONT IF YOU IF RE IF YOU REMEMBER THE PLOT
SO IN FACT THIS GUY THE PRIVATE RYAN IS NOT AT ALL THE MAIN ACTOR THE THE MAIN A WELL
THE MAIN CHARACTER IS UH PLAYED BY TOM HANKS AND IT'S ACTUALLY YOU CAN SEE HIS PICTURE ON THE SECOND PAGE OF MY MY NOTES UH CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER
SO HE IS SENT WITH THIS RATHER STRANGE MISSION WHICH IS NOT A COMBAT MISSION BUT THEY UH THEY WANT JUST TO TO GET THIS GUY BACK
WHICH IS IN FACT THIS GUY IS I THINK BEHIND ENEMY LINES OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
SO IT HAPPENS IN IN EUROPE JUST AFTER THE THE NORMANDY LANDING
AND IT'S VERY VERY STRIKING THE WAY THEY THEY FILMED ALL THE THE COMBAT SCENES AND UH IT'S IT'S VERY DRAMATIC
IT'S UH IT'S NOT YOU KNOW LIKE IN THE MOVIES FROM THE FIFTIES OR THE SIXTIES WHERE PEOPLE JUST FALL AND DIE ANONYMOUSLY
BUT HERE THEY WELL YOU SEE EVERYTHING AND YOU SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE ON THAT DAY
IT'S ACTUALLY
WELL IT'S VERY STRANGE YOU COULD S ASK THIS FOR ANY SAD MOVIE DID YOU ENJOY IT
WELL I DIDN'T REALLY ENJOY TO SEE BAD THINGS BUT UH I THINK IT WAS SATISFYING TO SEE THAT WELL HOW DRAMATIC THINGS ARE
YEAH
EXACTLY YEAH
I IT'S VERY MOVING I IT'S TRUE IT'S NOT VERY IT'S NOT VERY WELL HAPPY
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD COMPARE WITH APOCALYPSE NOW IF IT'S DARKER OR MAYBE
YEAH
SO YEAH SO I THINK THIS WOULD CONTINUE A BIT OUR OUR THEME
SO THE THE MOVIE IS RANKED QUITE HIGH IF I IF I REFER BACK TO YOUR TABLE IT'S NUMBER UH WHAT ACTUALLY UM FOURTEEN
QUITE A LOT OF VOTES SO UM ALSO ONE OF THE THE MAINSTREAM MOVIES
UM ON THE SECOND PAGE UH OF MY NOTES I WELL I QUOTED SOME UH WELL SOME FACTS ABOUT THE MOVIE THAT I FOUND INTERESTING
WE WE COULD USE THEM FOR EITHER A POSTER OR UH OR A PRESENTATION
UM ESPECIALLY I ENJOYED THE STORY ABOUT THE THE COLOUR SATURATION
IT'S TRUE THAT THE MOVIE IS NOT REALLY BLACK AND WHITE
UH BUT UH THE COLOURS ARE GREY ISH DARK ISH IT IT PROV IT MAKES A VERY MOVING EFFECT
YEAH I THINK ALSO TO SHOW THE UM YEAH
I THINK IT'S THE REFERENCE TO HISTORY AND ALSO THIS DARK YEAH THE MOOD AND UH THINGS ARE ACTUALLY WELL MOST OF THE THINGS ARE QUITE GREY
YOU KNOW THE UNIFORMS WEAPONS THINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
EXACTLY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL I THINK MATT DAMON IS THE GUY WHO MUST BE SAVED IF I REMEMBER WELL AND IN FACT THE DIE
WELL YEAH THE PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SHOULD SAVE ONE PERSON
SO AND THEY ARE QUITE RESENTFUL BECAUSE THEY I MEAN THEY FEEL THEY SHOULD FIGHT THEY SHOULDN'T JUST GO THERE AND UH JUST GET SOMEONE AND GET BACK
AND IN FACT SOME OF THEM D GET KILLED FOR THIS GUY
ACTUALLY MOST OF THEM YEAH I THINK SO
SO
YEAH YEAH
IT'S A VERY I THINK SOME PEOPLE COMPARE IT WITH UH WHATEVER CHRISTIAN MESSAGE OR I DUNNO
BUT UM I THINK IT'S QUITE QUITE UNIVERSAL AND IT'S UH I THINK IT'S A MODERN VERY MODERN
WELL THIS UH VALUE OF ONE INDIVIDUAL IT LOOKS LIKE A CHRISTIAN MESSAGE YOU KNOW
THE VALUE OF ONE IS COMPARED TO OTHERS I I DON'T KNOW I TH I THINK I HEARD THIS AT THAT POINT BUT MAYBE I'M JUST WRONG
SO YEAH I I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A COHERENT CHOICE
IT'S PROBABLY A BIT LONG AND WE MIGHT WANT SOMETHING THAT IS LIGHTER AND FUNNIER
BUT UH IF WE WANT TO KEEP THIS THIS IDEA OF HISTORY AND CONFLICT AND ALSO TO SHOW SOME SOME KIND OF MODERN TREATMENT OF IT
IT IT WOULD MAKE FOR A GOOD CHOICE
BUT IF YOU SEE IN MY NOTES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FIRST PAGE I PUT SOME OTHER CANDIDATE MOVIES
UH LA VITA E BELLA IS AN ITALIAN ONE BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT HISTORY AND IT HAPPENS AT T THE SAME PERIOD AS SCHINDLER'S LIST
AND I ALSO QUOTED PULP FICTION AND SILENCE OF THE LAMBS UM A BIT MORE REMOTE FROM THE THEMES
BUT QUITE WELL KNOWN MOVIES AND ENJOYABLE I WOULD SAY
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS OR SHOULD WE JUST MOVE TO THE NEXT CANDIDATE MAYBE
OKAY
IT'S JUST BELOW THE TABLE SO SINCE WE ALL REFER TO THE TABLE
MM-HMM
YEAH
NO I THINK THE SUMMARY IS I IS QUITE GOOD
AND ESPECIALLY I THINK IT UH WELL MM WHEN YOU READ IT YOU JUST WANT TO GO TO SEE THE MOVIE
I THINK IT LOOKS FUNNY FOR ME
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE BUT UH THE SUMMARY LOOKS FUNNY
MM-HMM

UM
THE PLOT IS QUITE HARD TO TO MAKE BUT MAYBE YOU YOU READ IT AL ALREADY YOU UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING FROM THE PLOT OR
I AM
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S A BIT LIKE THE F IN MY OPINION LIKE UM AMERICAN BEAUTY
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A FUNNY MOVIE BUT UH IT CRITIQUES A LOT THE AMERICAN SOCIETY
AND THE THE THE HERO THE THE DUDE THE MM BIG LEBOWKSI IT'S ACTUALLY HIS NAME IS A A KIND OF NON HERO
BUT HE'S REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OF UH A NORMAL UH L. A. L. A. GUY
AND UH HE HAS A FRIEND COMI VETER VETERAN FROM VIETNAM AND UH ANOTHER FRIEND WHO IS NEVER SPEAKING
AND THEY ALL ARE TOGETHER IN A BOWLING CLUB WHERE THEY MEET AND THEY DISCUSS ABOUT UH EVERYTHING
THEY SEEMS TO HAVE NO JOB I NOT KNOW WE NEVER SEEN I THEM WORKING
YEAH
AND ACTUALLY HE'S UH TAKING PART TO A KIND OF UM UH
UH S SOME SOME KILLERS COME TO HIS APARTMENT UH BECAUSE THEY THINK HE'S SOMEONE ELSE
AND UH THE WHOLE STORY IS ABOUT UH HE WANTS TO TO TO GET SOME MONEY OUT OF THIS STORY
AND HE'S GOING TO SEE THE OTHER LEBOWSKI TO ASK HIM MONEY BECAUSE HE HE BECAUSE THE KILLERS ACTUALLY UH DAMAGE SOME STUFF IN HIS APARTMENT
IT'S UH JEFF BRIDGES AND UH JOHN GOODMAN
JOHN GOODMAN YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN HIM IN IN A SERIES

AFTERWARD IT'S UH UH A GUY WHO JOHN TURTURRO THEY ARE COMPETING WITH HIM ON A BOWLING UH CONTEST
AND UM JULIANNE MOORE AND THE LAST ONE IS BUSCEMI OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUSCEMI
HE'S NEVER SPEAKING IN THE MOVIE
EACH TIME HE'S TRYING TO SPEAK THE OTHER ONE ARE ARE STOPPING HIM
SO IT'S QU
NO HE'S NOT ON THE ON THE PICTURE THE SECOND LEBOWSKI
SO UH MY PROPOSITION WAS TO ADD UM THE TITLE OF COURSE SOME INFORMATION ABO ABOUT THE PRICING ON THE RIGHT
UH YEAH BUT WHEN IT WILL BE PRINTED IT WILL BE OKAY I THINK
AH YOU MEAN
OKAY SO I PREPARED A SECOND ONE
WHERE TH TH TH THERE'S THERE IS SOME INFORMATION
AT THE BOTTOM WE CAN SEE THAT UM DO YOU KNOW MONDRE MONTREUX ENGLISH MOVIE CLUB

SO UM
OKAY
BUT THERE IS A TH THERE IS A THIRD ONE
UM ACTUALLY I I PREFER IT BECAUSE IT'S MORE COLOURFUL ALSO
BUT IT'S IT CAN CATCH THE EYES ACTUALLY BUT UM

AND ON THE BOTTOM IT'S UH HE IS HE KEEPS DREAMING IN TH IN THIS MOVIE
BECAUSE UH UH THE KILLER'S UM UH PUT IT D PUT IT OR HE IS DRINKING TOO MUCH ALSO

SILENCE OF THE LAMBS THAT'S A GODFATHER OF ALL THRILLERS I WOULD SAY

THE PLOT OUTLINE SAYS THAT THE UH CLARICE STARLING
THE YOUNG F. B. I. AGENT IS ASSIGNED TO HELP A F TO HELP FIND A MI UH MISSING WOMAN AND SAVE HER FROM THE PS PSYCHOPATHIC KILLER WITH THE HELP OF ANOTHER KILLER

BUT IF I READ YOUR FIRST POINT IN THE IN THIS UH TRIVIAS
I AM JUST SURPRISED BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT ALL THE PRINCIPLE ACTORS UH UNDERWENT SEVERAL DAYS OF UH CRUEL ARMY TRAINING EXCEPT FOR THE MAN MATT DAMON

MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND THIS ONE IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SECOND LEBOWSKI
OR WHO
OKAY OKAY
BUT ACTUALLY I'M I'M LITTLE BIT MISSING TH SOME INFORMATION ABOUT OUR MOVIE CLUB I THINK UH THERE SHOULD BE SOME MORE INFORMATION
YEAH I LIKE THIS MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO PERHAPS WE CAN SOMEHOW COMBINE THEM
I THINK THERE IS TOO MANY COLOURS TOO MANY COLOURS
NOWADAYS YOU KNOW IF YOU SEE SOME ADVERTISEMENTS ON THE S YEAH BUT NOWADAYS IF YOU SEE SOME ADVERTISEMENT ON THE ON THE STREET
THIS IS TYPICAL TYPICAL UH POSTER I WOULDN'T WOULDN'T LOOK AT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM

MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
HOW IS IT ACTUALLY R RANKED BECAUSE I CANNOT SEE IT HERE IN YOUR TABLE
I SOMEHOW CAN'T FIND IT

VOTED YEAH
MM-HMM
LET'S NOMINATE OKAY
SO I WILL TAKE BASICALLY TWO EXTREMES I WILL TAKE SCHINDLER'S LIST AND I WILL TAKE UH THE BIG LEBOWSKI
ONE OF THE ONE OF THEM IS REALLY JUST FUNNY AND FROM THE NINETIES UH I MEAN THE STORY IS FROM THE NINETIES
WHILE THE SECOND ONE IS ABOUT THE SECOND WAR AND IS UH SERIOUS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM

MM-HMM OKAY
SIXTH SENSE
'KAY
SECONDS

AMERICAN BEAUTY
UH THREE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT I WOULD SAY THESE IMAGES ARE VERY NICE AND THEY ARE REALLY REPRESENTATIVE PERHAPS
MM-HMM
I'M YEAH SURE SORRY
SORRY
I WAS SLEEPI SLEEPING FOR A WHILE
MM-HMM
IT SHOULD BE FROM THIS PERIOD BECAUSE NINETIES
WOULD BE FINISHED
MM
TWO THOUSAND
MM-HMM
YEAH
WHATEVER
FIRST MONDAY OF MAY YEAH SO IT'S AFTER THE PROJECTION
AND WE WILL SEE WHAT ARE THE REACTIONS OF THE PEOPLE AND SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE ARE YES YES YES
AND PERHAPS WE WILL HAVE SOME NEW MEMBERS
UM
AMERICAN BEAUTY FINALLY
OKAY
UH SURE MY NAME IS AGNES AND I'M AN USER USABILITY USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
UM I WAS WONDERING
MM-HMM
MM
MM
WELL NO NOT EXACTLY
I MEAN MY JOB FROM WHAT I UNDERSTOOD WAS TO LOOK AT THE USABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCT IS USABLE
IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA USE IT AND LOOK AT THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT
SO I THINK I'LL HAVE TO INTERACT WITH CHRISTINE AND DISCUSS WITH HER
SO THAT SHE'S NOT DESIGNING SOMETHING THAT MY STUDIES WILL SHOW RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK
AND SO IT'S SORT OF IT'S A LOOP THAT FEEDS IN BUT I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY THAT I'M IN A COORDINATING POSITION FOR IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
WHICH WILL ALSO FEED INTO THE MARKETING BECAUSE DEPENDING ON WHAT USERS WANT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU SELL IT
WHAT TAG LINES YOU ATTACH TO IT HOW YOU TRY TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO USERS
SO I THINK ALL THREE GROUPS WILL NEED TO INTERACT QUITE A BIT
UM AND THEN I GUESS BUILD THE PLAN BASED ON ALL OF THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU NEED TO TAKE ALL THE FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT
YEAH OF COURSE
YEAH WE CAN C. C. HIM ON ANY DISCUSSIONS OR DOCUMENTS THAT ARE PASSED AROUND
SURE
NO PROBLEM
SO THE IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP IS TO START DETERMINING THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OR OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM YEAH THAT WOULD BE USEFUL
SURE
OKAY
THANKS
THANK YOU
OOPS
THAT'S AS FAR AS IT GOES
DO YOU ALSO DO MARKETING
AND I'M CHRISTINE AND MY ROLE IN THIS UH SCENARIO IS TO BE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
BUT I'M NOT REALLY ONE
WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT
UM NO I I HAVE NOT BEGUN WORKING ON THE DESIGN
AND UM I UH I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL I THOUGHT WE WERE DESIGNING A NEW MONITOR
UM THE WEBSITE I WENT TO LOOK AT HAD SOME ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT AN INTRODUCTION OF A UM UH SOME SORT OF A SEVEN INCH UM MONITOR
AND UM I UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT WAS THE PROJECT GOAL
SO UM I'M GLAD I DIDN'T D DO ANY WORK UM AHEAD OF TIME BECAUSE UH I CLEARLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT GOAL
UM I JUST DID S SEE THAT WE WERE STARTING A NEW PROJECT TOGETHER AND THERE WAS GOING TO BE A FOUR MEMBER TEAM COMPOSED OF THESE PEOPLE
AND UM THAT'S ABOUT UH THAT'S AND I I READ THROUGH THE DIFFERENT STEPS AND WHAT MY RESPONSIBILITIES WERE RELATIVE TO THE STEPS
UH FOR THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN
UM WELL I WOULD TH THINK THAT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GIVE US
UM BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW YOU CAN UH YOU CAN MAKE IT UH YOU HAVE DIFFERENT CHOICES WITH DIFFERENT FINANCIAL MODELS
WELL YOU KNOW UM I KIND OF THINK THAT IN GENERAL YOU HAVE TO DO UH UM Y YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY FASHIONABLE
THAT'S UH VERY ATTRACTIVE THAT UM PEOPLE SEE AND RECOGNIZE UH ITS GOAL AND UH THEY IMMEDIATELY WANNA HAVE IT UH HAVE ONE OF THEIR OWN
SO IT WOULD REALLY WOULD NEED TO UM SOMETHING LIKE THE IPOD WOULD BE GOOD
SEEMS TO HAVE CAUGHT ON FAIRLY WELL SO UM D UH YOU KNOW I DON'T CARE WHAT IT DOES JUST SO IT LOOKS COOL
WELL UH I'VE GOT A LOT OF OTHER PROJECTS I'M DOING RIGHT NOW UM AND SO I'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW THOSE UH HOW THOSE GO
IF THEY UH GO QUICKLY THEN UH IT COULD BE A MONTH
IF UM IF I RUN INTO ANY PROBLEMS IN MY OTHER PROJECTS IT MIGHT BE SIX MONTHS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE THAT
UH WELL IF UH IF WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME UH THEN D DO YOU THINK UM TWO WEEKS IS A IS CLOSE ENOUGH
UH ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WILL BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE PLAN
OKAY I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT
WOULD YOU MIND UM AT THE CONCLUSION OF OUR MEETING COULD COULD YOU SEND US A COPY OF YOUR SLIDES
THANK YOU
MY NAME IS ED AND I DO ACCOUNTING
E. D.
MM
NO
ACCOUNTING YES
MARKETING IS UH IS ME
WELL I THINK THAT WE'LL SEE THAT THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN HOW WE'RE GOING TO PUT THIS TOGETHER AS A MARKETING TO TO MARKET THE PRODUCT
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE ON A THROUGH DISCUSSION ON WHERE WE'RE GONNA GO FROM HERE AND FROM WITH THIS
UH FOR THE MOMENT NOT YET
GOOD QUESTION
NO THIS IS LIKE I SAID THAT WE HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED BETWEEN ALL OF US AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE

WE HAVE TO DEFINE EXACTLY WHAT OUR PRODUCT IS FROM UH
FROM WHAT I HAD IN MIND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MARKETING COFFEE IS THAT RIGHT
REMOTE CONTROLS 'CAUSE I HAD TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
I HAD A FIRST PART OF MINE WAS TO MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL FOR A NEW F REMOTE CONTROL FOR TELEVISION
AND AFTERWARD I HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT COFFEE SO WE'LL START WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR TELEVISION THEN
SO WE'RE HAVE TO DESIGN SOMETHING THAT IS VERY USER FRIENDLY
SOMETHING UH VISUAL THAT HAS SOMETHING THAT WILL WILL DRAW PEOPLE TO BUY THE PRODUCT
BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY'S EXPERIENCED WITH UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND SOME REMOTE CONTROLS ARE ARE WORTH UH THROWING OUT THE WINDOW
UH TH MOST OF THEM AR I DON'T KNOW WE'RE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A NEW IDEA ON HOW TO MAKE IT A LOT EASIER TO USE
'CAUSE A LOT OF TIMES UH SPEND UH HALF A DAY THROUGH THE INSTRUCTION BOOK TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT
WELL NOT YET OTHER THAN UH DOING RESEARCH AND TAKING REMOTE CONTROLS AND LOOKING WHAT OTHER COMPANIES HAVE TO DO UH
WHAT THEY'RE BUILDING THEIR DESIGNS THEIR IDEAS UH ALSO HAVE TO PINPOINT WHICH MARKET WE'RE GONNA GO INTO
IT SHOULD BE A FAIRLY LARGE MARKET BECAUSE UH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT UH THE COMPETITION
UH TH I AGREE IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING NEW
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT THAT DRAWS PEOPLE SAYING EH I LIKE THIS
WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT THEY HAVE TO FIRST SAY I LIKE THIS I LIKE THE DESIGN AND THEN IT'S GOTTA BE SIMPLE TO USE
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM

THAT THAT'S
YES THAT'S YOU HAVE TO DECIDE OKAY SO THE BEST THING IS YOU UH BOTH OF UH THE CHRISTINE AND YOU DISCUSS WITH YOURSELF OKAY
AND COME UP WITH THE COST AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET OKAY
IN THE THE TECHNICALLY OR IN THE SALES WISE OKAY THE COMMERCIAL WISE OKAY
THEN UH WE HAVE TO DESIGN OKAY HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE THE WHOLE PROJECT
OKAY HOW MUCH IS GOING TO COST US AND HOW MUCH WE ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FOR THE COMPANY
OKAY OF COURSE IT'S IT'S UH OF BENEFIT FOR EVERYBODY INDIVIDUALLY
OKAY SO I THINK IT'S UH MAYBE IF WE CAN UH GIVE ME SOME KIND OF YOUR UH THE SALES PLAN
OKAY INCLUDING THE TECHNICAL WHAT UH SHE'S GOING TO TALK TO YOU WITHIN THE TEAM
OKAY THEN IT WILL HELP ME TO DISCUSS WITH THE MANAGEMENT FOR FURTHER OKAY AND PUT IT IN THE THE PROPER PROJECT PLAN
OKAY AND IF YOU NEED UH ANY COORDINATION IN BETWEEN UH COMPARED TO THE MAYBE THE SOME TECHNICAL VENDORS OR COMMERCIAL VENDORS
OKAY DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME UH UH MARKETING PLAN OR TECHNICAL PLAN OKAY SO YOU LET ME KNOW
OKAY I CAN COORDINATE OR MAYBE UH YOU ARE MY COORDINATOR AM I RIGHT
BETWEEN UH ALL THE COOR
YEAH
TH CHRISTINE YEAH
WHICH IS
YES
YEAH SO BASICALLY YOU NEED TO INTERACT WITH CHRISTINE MORE OKAY FOR THE USER ACCEPTABILITY OKAY AND THE TESTING OKAY THEN YOU WILL
YES
YES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
BUT WHAT I REQUEST OKAY KEEP ED IN THE LOOP OKAY
IN BETWEEN YOUR UH MEETING AND CHRISTINE MEETING BECAUSE UH HE SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING
YES
OKAY AND PLEASE PLEASE COPY ALL THE MAILS OKAY ALL THE DISCUSSIONS TO ME OKAY SO I NEED TO SUBMIT TO THE MANAGEMENT
SO ANY QUESTIONS FOR UH TIME BEING
YES
OKAY
TO COME UP WITH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN AND UH TO DISCUSS WITH ED OKAY
AND HOW IT'S GOING TO BE WORK AND UH FIRST OF ALL WITH YOUR USER ACCEPTANCE
OKAY HOW IT LOOKS LIKE AND HOW IT'S GOING TO BE WORK IN THE MARKET OKAY SO THEN WE CAN DISCUSS ABOUT UH FURTHER THINGS
SO WE'LL MEET WHEN THE WE'LL DISCUSS ON THE FURTHER MEETING
IT'S OKAY
THANKS FOR COMING
YES I WILL
YES
I'LL COPY UH LE LET US KEEP ALL THE EMAILS AND ALL THE COPIES OKAY

OR UH JUST COME AND UH KNOCK MY DOOR OKAY SO I'M AVAILABLE HERE
IT'S GOOD
OKAY THANKS FOR COMING AND UH I WISH YOU A NICE TIME THEN
OKAY SEE YOU LATER
BYE
YEP
SURE
NO THIS IS THE THIRD SLIDE
SURE
UM
YOU'RE PARTICIPANT S
TWO
DO YOU WANT THE MOUSE OR DO YOU WANT ME TO
MM-HMM
DO YOU HAVE ANY PRECONCEIVED IDEAS IN TERMS OF MATERIALS
'CAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNBREAKABLE THING DOING SOMETHING PLASTIC WOULD BE HARDER WHEREAS HAVING SOMETHING LIKE
I DUNNO STEEL OR TITANIUM ISN'T REALLY ECONOMICALLY VIABLE
YEAH
YEAH
SURE YEAH
NO I JUST WONDERING WHETHER THAT YOU HAD ANY SORT OF
YEAH
THE MARKETING COMES OUT
THAT'S CHRISTINE'S
AND THAT'S MINE I THINK
IN MODIFIED
S 'SCUSE ME FOR ONE SEC
HMM
IT SEEMS ALSO LIKE WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION YEAH IT'S A GREAT FEATURE
BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. THERE'S A LOT OF AMBIENT SOUND AND IT'S WORDS
IT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW NOISES LIKE SOMETHING HITTING
IT'S ACTUAL SPEECH SO THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNIZER IS GOOD ENOUGH TO FILTER OUT THE T. V. SPEECH AND THE THE USER'S SPEECH
OTHERWISE YOU CAN SAY REMOTE
BUT IF SOMEONE ON THE SCREEN IS SAYING THE SAME THING ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN A MOVIE SAYING OFF AND YOUR SCREEN DIES
BECAUSE THEY'VE TRIGGERED THE REMOTE CONTROL AND IT'S TURNED OFF YOUR T. V.
SO I THINK IF WE CAN FIND A SPEECH RECOGNIZER THAT CAN HANDLE THOSE TYPES OF PROBLEMS THEN YEAH IT'D BE A REALLY GOOD MARKETING GIMMICK
BUT I THINK WE SERIOUSLY NEED TO CONSIDER HOW THAT WOULD IMPACT
THE SITUATION
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH YEAH
YEAH
NO I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA IF WE CAN DESIGN IT TO TO SUIT THOSE REQUIREMENTS
YEAH
UM WELL I MEAN MAYBE IF I GO THROUGH MY PRESENTATION
YOU CAN SORT OF SEE WHAT THE USER PERSPECTIVE IS AND HOW IT TIES INTO THE OTHER TWO COMMENTS
MM PARTICIPANT THREE
NOPE HERE
GOOD
THANKS
YEAH AND THAT'S FINE
OKAY
SO BASICALLY
THE METHOD THAT WE USUALLY USE IN THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN IS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE LIKE AND WHAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ABOUT EXISTING PRODUCTS
SO IN OUR CASE EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS
AND THEN WHAT THE GOOD IDEAS ARE AND WHAT THE BAD IDEAS ARE AND WHY THEY'RE BAD AND GOOD WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS AS OBVIOUS
WE SEEM TO HAVE INTUITIONS ABOUT WHY THINGS ARE GOOD OR THINGS ARE BAD
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK TECHNICALLY AT HOW IT WORKS SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THEN WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT FUNCTIONALITIES WE REALLY WANT TO KEEP 'CAUSE THAT'LL FEED INTO BOTH ED'S WORK AND CHRISTINE'S WORK
UM AND THEN WHAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD LOOK LIKE OBVIOUSLY ONCE WE'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE FUNCTIONALITIES ARE
SO IN TERMS OF THE FUNCTIONALITIES THAT WE NEED YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF
YOU NEED TO CHANGE CHANNELS BOTH BY DIRECTLY GOING TO A SPECIFIC CHANNEL OR BY CHANNEL SURFING
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE VOLUME AND THEN CONTROL ANY MENUS ON THE T. V. TO REGULATE CONTRAST OR WHATEVER
SO THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED IS THAT THERE'S TOO MANY BUTTONS ON REMOTE CONTROLS IN GENERAL
THE BUTTONS IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
UM OFTEN YOU NEED TO KNOW SPECIFIC BUTTON SEQUENCES TO GET CERTAIN FUNCTIONALITIES DONE
UM WHICH YOU DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS REMEMBER ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A FUNCTIONALITY THAT YOU DON'T USE VERY OFTEN
AND THAT THE BUTTONS ARE TOO SMALL
SO HERE WE'VE GOT TWO EXAMPLES WHERE HERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU CAN SEE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT HAS LOTS AND LOTS OF BUTTONS
THE BUTTONS IN A LOT OF CASES ARE TINY
UM THEY'RE HARD TO SEE AND OKAY THEY'RE LABELLED BUT THE LABELS DON'T NECESSARILY TELL YOU TOO MUCH
WHEREAS ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE A MUCH SIMPLER REMOTE CONTROL THAT I THINK BASICALLY HAS THE MINIMUM FUNCTIONALITIES THAT ARE NEEDED
AND IT SORT OF LOOKS SIMPLER AND JUST LESS IMPOSING WHEN YOU FIRST LOOK AT IT
SO I WOULD BE INCLINED TO GO SORT OF TOWARDS THIS IN TERMS OF DESIGN RATHER THAN THIS
AND IF THERE'S SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITIES THAT REQUIRE MORE BUTTONS THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT WITH EXISTING UM BUTTONS
SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES ARE TO KEEP THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS TO A LIMIT OR TO A MINIMUM
SORRY MAKE FREQUENTLY USED BUTTONS BIGGER AND MORE STRATEGICALLY PLACED
SO LIKE THE ON BUTTON BEING REALLY OBVIOUS ONE THE CHANNEL CHANGING AND THE VOLUME AND TO KEEP THE DESIGN BASICALLY SLEEK AND SIMPLE
WHICH I THINK TIES INTO WHAT CHRISTINE AND ED HAVE BOTH SAID FAIRLY REASONABLY
UM SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT AN
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR
YEP
YES THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
OH THAT'S DEFINITELY A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR
ESPECIALLY TO USERS WHO ARE GONNA BE BUYING THE THING AND THEN USING IT ALMOST ON AN DAILY BASIS IN A LOT OF CASES I THINK
OH
SHOULD WE MAYBE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT FEATURES WE ACTUALLY WANT TO INCLUDE 'CAUSE WE'VE THROWN A LOT OF FEATURES ONTO THE TABLE BUT
DO WE ACTUALLY WANT TO INCORPORATE ALL OF THEM OR HAVE WE MISSED ANYTHING
SURE
MM-HMM
I THOUGHT
NO I I'M JUST THINKING IN TERMS OF TIME LIKE IF
YES NOW I'M OBJECTING
NO I MEAN I WAS JUST THINKING IS IT REALLY PRACTICAL TO START DESIGNING SOMETHING WITH FEATURES THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA END UP THROWING AWAY
I MEAN IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT FOR EVERYONE TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT FEATURES UM
AND S IF WE SPEND THAT TIME AND EFFORT ON FEATURES THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA USE
MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO SPEND IT ON THE F THINKING MORE ABOUT FEATURES THAT WE ACTUALLY DO WANT BUT
I GUESS
SURE
YEAH
YEAH
SURE
OKAY
'KAY DO YOU WANNA OPEN THE
I'M NUMBER TWO
THAT'S IT
I'LL DO THE NOTES
YEAH THANKS
SO UM WELL I I FIGURED UH WE SHOULD UM IDENTIFY SOME USER REQUIREMENTS AND FROM MY EXPERIENCE I WANNA UH
AND FROM RESEARCH I DID UH THE THE DEVICE HAS TO TURN THE TELEVISION ON AND OFF THE FIRST TIME YOU PRESS ON THE BIG BUTTON
YOU CAN'T UH CAN'T HAVE LIKE UH WAFFLING ON THIS POINT YOU KNOW
REALLY HAVE
IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE Y Y HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIND IT
BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH REMOTE CONTROLS IS FINDING THEM
SO UH I ALSO SINCE WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH OUR CORPORATE IMAGE ON THE BASIS OF THIS NEW PRODUCT
THOUGHT WE BETTER LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE POPULAR AND UM EX GO BEYOND THOSE AND AS I SAID IN THE FIRST MEETING
UM AND THEN UH WE MIGHT WANNA TALK EVENTUALLY ABOUT THE MATERIALS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO USE IN UH IN THE CONSTRUCTION
ESPECIALLY IN THE THE UH THE OUTSIDE OF THE PRODUCT SO THAT IT GIVES THE APPEARANCE AND IT IS RELIABLE AND SO FORTH
I DID A LITTLE HISTORY ON UH THE THE UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND WHEN THEY WERE INVENTED AND SO FORTH
SO I GUESS THIS GUY ZENITH UH CREATED THE FLASHMATIC
WHICH I KINDA LIKE THE IDEA
'CAUSE IT MADE ME THINK OF UM UM MAYBE THE REMOTE CONTROL MADE A BIG FLASH WHEN UH YOU TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING
AND UM SO IT WAS HIGHLY DIRECTIONAL FLASH LIGHT THAT UH YOU COULD TURN THE PICTURE ON AND OFF
AND THE SOUND ON AND OFF AND CHANGE CHANNELS C SO I THINK UM THOSE ARE STILL REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE TODAY UH FIFTY YEARS LATER
AND UH IT WAS REALLY A PIONEERING INNOVATION BUT IT WAS UH SENSITIVE TO THE SUN
SO THAT UH IT WOULD GET WOULD START OFF BY THE YOU'D GET IT WOULD EASILY CAUSE UM PROBLEMS
SO UH
I IN ADDITION TO UH LOOKING AT THE UM UH THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIR SO ALL THESE DEVICES ARE EXAMPLES OF WHERE UH MM THEY REPRESENT EXAMPLES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY
WHICH I THINK THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE
IS R UM REALLY UH SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND
IT'D BE EASY TO FIND
AND UM IT WOULD UH Y YOU'D YOU COULD THROW IT AT THINGS IF IF THE T. V. DIDN'T TURN ON AND OFF YOU COULD USE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE
AND SINCE I'M NOT REALLY UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS SLIDE
BUT UM
I JUST TOOK SOME DIFFERENT UH SCHEMATICS AND I PUT THEM INTO THIS
AND I GUESS THIS IS WHAT A SLIDE MIGHT LOOK LIKE IF YOU WERE DRAWING A CIRCUIT BOARD
I DON'T KNOW WHY UM WE WERE ASKED TO DO THIS
SO
UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES UM
I THINK WE COULD UH I I'M REALLY THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX HERE
AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER PERHAPS HAVING AN AN AN A A SIZE UH A REMOTE CONTROL THAT CHANGES IN SIZE DEPENDING ON THE USER PREFERENCE
SO SOMETHING THAT'S VERY VERY FLEXIBLE AND INFLATABLE AND THEN YOU COULD SHRINK IT
I THINK UM IT COULD EITHER BE YOU COULD GO EITHER ONE EXTREME BE VERY COLOURFUL
OR YOU COULD MAKE IT CLEAR AND UM KIND OF BLEND IN WITH THINGS
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO UM UH HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE TH THE DECORATION OF THE OF THE USER'S HOME
UM I THINK UH IT NEEDS TO BE WATERPROOF
BECAUSE UH SOMETIMES THEY FALL INTO CUPS AND YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE OUT BY THE SWIMMING POOL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UM IF YOU UH MI ONE OF ONE OF MY REQUIREMENTS WAS ABOUT NEEDS T TO TELL YOU WHEN IT'S DONE ITS JOB OR NOT BECAUSE HALF THE TIME
I KEEP PUSHING ON THE REMOTE CONTROL AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD MY MESSAGE
SO I THINK IT SHOULD GIVE YOU SOME SORT OF AN ORAL CUE
AND UH COURSE I NEVER WANNA REPLACE THE BATTERY
SO THAT'S THOSE ARE MY F PREFERENCES AND THAT'S MY PRESENTATION
YES
RUN OVER IT WITH A CAR
GOOD IDEA
GOOD IDEA I'LL I'LL UH UM
YES VERY GOOD
HMM
TITANIUM
TITANIUM WOULD BE BE HEAVY TOO WOULDN'T IT
NO I HAVEN'T REALLY UM I WANTED FEEDBACK I THINK WE NEED TO RATE RANK THESE
BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT YOUR UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES ARE AND YOUR THOUGHTS
I LIKE TITANIUM
IT'S LIGHT
UH YEAH BUT UH WHO WHO SAID WHO SAID WE WERE YOU KNOW NOBODY TOLD ME HOW MU WHAT OUR FINANCIAL OBJECTIVE IS SO UM
IT'D BE HARD TO INFLATE SOMETHING OU MADE OUT OF TITANIUM THOUGH
NOT FAT
NOT FAT HUH
MIGHT BE HARD TO FIND THOUGH
OH OKAY
SPEECH RECOGNITION
D UH I'M SORRY
WELL UH TRAINING IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE WITH UH COMMANDS
SO UM MIGHT UH WE CAN PERHAPS UM DO IT IF THE USER IS WILLING TO SPEND SOME TIME IN THE TRAINING PROCESS
UH IT COULD REDUCE TH TH UH THE OVERALL UM COST
NOT SURE HOW
BUT UM ANYWAY UM I I THINK ALSO THAT UH THIS MIGHT IMPACT THE BATTERY LIFE
AND UM SO MAYBE WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO IS UM ADD SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN UM RECHARGE IT WIRELESSLY
SO THAT UH Y YOU KNOW SEN SEND POWER TO IT
SO UH OR MAYBE UH SET IT OUT IN THE SUN AND IT UH YOU KNOW GETS UH FROM THE LIGHT
UM A A SOLAR CELL INSIDE THERE SO THAT UH YOU HAVE ENOUGH UH JUICE TO DO ALL THESE FANCY THINGS
OFF
VERY GOOD POINT
OKAY WE'LL FIND THAT OUT
OH IT'S UM SEEMS VERY UNDERSTANDABLE
CLEARLY YOUR RESEARCH AND UH AND OURS UH HEADING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND UM UH
THE ONLY THING THAT I SAW MISSING FROM UH YOUR YOUR RESEARCH THAT WE FOUND WAS THIS UH ABILITY TO FIND THE DOGGONE THING WHEN YOU NEED IT
SO UH YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S OKAY
THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE AT THE TABLE SO THAT IF WE THINK OF IT AND OUR RESEARCH INDICATES CERTAIN THINGS AND UM W WE IT'S COMPLEMENTARY
I ALSO THINK THAT UM UH TH F THE THE FEEL OF IT IS UH WHEN YOU HOLD IT
IS SOMETHING THAT UM UH WAS EXPRESSED MORE IN IN IN IN MY UH DESIGN
AND THAT'S LOGICAL AND NORMAL 'CAUSE THOSE ARE THE PARAMETERS THAT AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER'S MORE THINKING ABOUT TH TH THE LOOK AND THE FEEL AND UH YOU'RE
FIRST
YEP
MM-HMM
OKAY SO I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
SOUNDS GOOD
DO YOU WANNA GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE CLOSING SLIDE MAYBE THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE
DOESN'T REALLY TELL US
WELL IT SAYS INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS IT SAYS USER INTERF SO I'M SUPPOSED TO DO THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT
SUPPOSED TO WORK ON THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP WATCHING THE TRENDS
UM AND SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT BY OUR OUR COACH
I THINK WE SHOULD DO AS MANY FEATURES AS UH START WITH ALL OF THEM RIGHT NOW AND ELIMINATE THEM LATER IN THE PROCESS THAT'S MY SUGGESTION
YOU CAN OBJECT IF YOU WANT TO
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THAT AS AN ACTION ITEM FOR AFTER THE MEETING 'CAUSE W OUR MEETING TIME HAS RUN OUT
SOMEBODY ELSE HAS GO TO USE THIS ROOM AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T HANG OUT HERE AND TALK ABOUT THIS SO
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FANTASTIC
TITANIUM
EXPENSIVE
I DON'T KNOW I THINK VERBALLY WE CAN WE CAN PRETTY MUCH SELL
HMM
UH FROM HER SIDE I DON'T THINK UH THERE'S TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS
IF YOU CAN COME TO THE
OKAY FROM THE MARKETING YEAH FROM THE MARKETING SIDE JUST TO TO GIVE AN IDEA WHAT THE MANAGEMENT IS LOOKING FOR
I WAS LOOKING FOR A A REMOTE CONTROL TO HAVE A S
I HAVE A SALES PRICE OF TWENTY FIVE EURO WITH A PRODUCTION PRICE OF UH TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
FOR WHAT UH I THINK FROM WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND WE'RE TR WE'RE LOOKING FOR I DON'T THINK THAT PRICE IS EXACTLY IN THE MARKET
OKAY
I'LL EXPLAIN MYSELF HERE NOW IN THE SENSE THAT UH
IN A IN THE RECENT SURVEYS UH FROM THE AGES FR FROM FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE
EIGHTY PERCENT ARE WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY FOR SOMETHING AS FANCY AS TRENDY
TWENTY FIVE EUROS UH THAT'S THAT'S A PRESON REASONABLE PRICE
THAT'S A MARKET PRICE RIGHT NOW
NOW IF WE'RE GONNA TAKE A RISK AND PUSH THIS UP A BIT MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE
BUT GIVE THEM ADDED THINGS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE NOW THEN IT W IT COULD POSSIBLY SELL
OBVIOUSLY THE RISK IS THERE
TOO EXPENSIVE THEY'RE NOT GONNA BUY
BUT I THINK UH THERE'S ONE OTHER THING INTERESTING TWO THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING IS THAT UH FROM THE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD GROUP
WHICH ALWAYS SPENDS MORE MONEY ON TRENDY NEW THINGS SPEECH RECOGNITION IS REQUESTED
AND WE'RE TALKING BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE TO NINETY PERCENT OF THIS GROUP IS WILLING TO PAY FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION ON A REMOTE
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T MAKE A REMOTE INTO A COMPUTER BUT MAYBE SIMPLE COMMANDS
I DUNNO LOUDER SOFTER ON OFF
THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY EVEN THOUGH IT COSTS MORE TO BE THE FIRST ON THE MARKET TO PRODUCE THIS
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT SAY THEY'RE TOO DIFFICULT TO USE
SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY OF MAKING IT UM MORE USER FRIENDLY
UH FIFTY PERCENT SAY THEY CAN'T FIND THE REMOTE HALF THE TIME
SO MAYBE ONE WORD SPEECH RECOGNITION COMMANDS SAY REMOTE AND THERE'S A BEEP BEEP BEEP
AND THEY CAN FIND IT THROUGH YOU KNOW TEN TONS OF NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES WHATEVER YOU HAVE AT HOME
BUT IN THE COST THAT UH THE MANAGEMENT IS LOOKING FOR THAT'S NOT GONNA BE POSSIBLE
BUT IF IT'S TRENDY IF IT'S FANCY IT'S GOT SOME COLOUR TO IT IF IT'S VERY EASY EASY TO USE
IF IT'S GOT SIMPLE REMOTE SPEECH REMOTE UH CONTROL LIKE I SAID
LOUDER SOFTER CHANGE CHANNEL ON OFF REMOTE IT GOES BEEP BEEP
I CAN FIND MY MY REMOTE WITHOUT SPENDING HALF A DAY LOOKING FOR IT AND GETTING ALL UPSET 'CAUSE I CAN'T TURN THE T. V. ON
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN A IN THIS GLOBAL IDEA WITH THE IDEAS OF THE INDUSTRIAL UH DESIGN
BUT PRICE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
SPEECH RECOGNITION
MM
BECAUSE THA W WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION UH TH I'M NOT THAT GOOD AT THAT IDEA BUT TH
IF IT'S A ONE WORD RECOGNITION 'CAUSE I KNOW WITH TELEPHONES AND CARS AND THINGS I'VE SEEN IN THE STATES
A FRIEND OF MINE SAYS CALL MOM AND IT CALLS UP MOM
'KAY THE RADIO CAN BE ON AND EVERYTHING
BECAUSE I THINK S WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION IF UH THE THE REMOTE OR LIKE THE TELEPHONE IT HAS A EXACT WORD THAT IT HAS TO HEAR
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD COME THROUGH A SENTENCE IN A TELEVISION
IF SOMEBODY'S SPEAKING ON THE SE THE TELEVISION THEY'RE NOT GONNA STOP AND SAY REMOTE OKAY
SO I THINK THAT UH SOMETHING COULD BE DESIGNED TO RECOGNISE SINGLE WORD
LIKE THE T LIKE THE TELEPHONE
NO BECAUSE I THIS IS THIS IS YEARS AGO IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE'RE DRIVING DOWN AND HE SAID CALL HOME
AND THE TELEPHONE CALLED IMMEDIATELY SO WELL THAT'S KINDA CUTE
FROM FROM YOUR SIDE UH YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK THE MANAGEMENT AND S BE MORE S PRECISE
WHAT DO THEY WANT
UH A RISK TAKE A RISK ON THE MARKET
SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA COST MORE BUT COULD VERY EASILY S MAKE A BOOM IN THE MARKET
BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT HAS TO BE TOTAL TOTALLY NEW
SOMETHING THAT NOBODY HAS RIGHT NOW
AND IT'S GONNA COST
MM-HMM
SURE
SURE
OBVIOUSLY
IF THE BOTTOM LINE IS POSITIVE
MM
MM
YES
MM
HMM
INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
SHE'S OBJECTING
OH TH WE S WE STILL HAVE
YEAH
RIGHT
AGREED
OKAY UH AGNES YOU CAN HELP ME FOR THE SLIDE WHEN OKAY
OKAY WELCOME BACK
I HOPE UH YOU HAVE A FRESH HEAD AND A FRESH TIME
HOW T NOW THE MEETING ACTUALLY WE GATHERING HERE TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING
OKAY AND UH WE'LL ISSUE SOME INFORMATION FROM UH ALL OF YOU
AND IT'S IN THE I THINK UH IN THE SHARING FOLDER
AND UH I WILL INVITE UH THE CHRISTINE AND THE ED AND UH AGNES TO DISCUSS ABOUT ON THE VARIOUS SUBJECTS
SO CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
YEAH UH THE AGENDA OF THE MEETING IS OPENING
THEN UH I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT UH THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO AND UH OF COURSE I'M DOING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND SECRETARY BOTH
OKAY TO TAKE THE MINUTES OF THE MEETING
AND THERE ARE THREE PRESENTATIONS
ONE IS UH NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
AND THE SECOND ONE ABOUT UH DECISION ON REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
AND UH FINALLY WE ARE CLOSING
UH AND THE MEETING TIME WILL BE UH FORTY MINUTES SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY QUICK
AND I HAVE COME UP WITH THE MANAGEMENT COME WITH THE NEW PROPOSAL OKAY AND I HAVE TO DISCUSS A FEW POINTS ON THIS
UH BOTH SAYS NEW INSIGHTS IN THE AIM OF YOUR PROJECT
UH THE ONE IS UH THE TELETEXT BECOMES UH OUTMODED OKAY BECAUSE IF UH BECAUSE OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND THE NEW TECHNOLOGY
SO WE DON'T NEED TO CONSIDER REALLY ABOUT THE TELETEXT ALL IN OUR NEW PROJECT DESIGN
AND THE SECOND ONE IS ABOUT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL
SHOULD BE USED ONLY FOR THE T. V.
THAT'S WHAT OUR UH MANAGEMENT SAYS
AND THE THIRD POINT IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH OUR UH MARKETING OR UH CORPORATE IMAGE OKAY WITH THIS NEW PROJECT OR NEW PRODUCT
OKAY
SO I WILL INVITE UH
AGNES CAN YOU GO TO THE THIRD SLIDE
OKAY
SO I'LL INVITE UH CHRISTINE TO DISCUSS ABOUT UH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
YEAH LET ME UH INTERRUPT YOU UH
IF YOU CAN ADD OTHER FACILITY OTHER FEATURE LIKE UH UNBREAKABLE
OKAY BECAUSE UH ESPECIALLY TODAY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE FAMILY AND THE KIDS
OKAY AND THE KIDS THROW IT AND THEY THEY PLAY WITH THEIR REMOTES AND
YES
OKAY SO IF YOU CAN ADD THE FEATURE OKAY FOR YOUR UH FABRIC WHATEVER IN YOUR OUTLINE DESIGN
OKAY WITH UNBREAKABLE OKAY I THINK THAT WILL GIVE A LOT OF ADVANTAGE FOR OUR PRODUCT
IF I'M NOT WRONG
MAYBE YOU CAN UH ADD IT IN THAT
OKAY UH THANK YOU CHRISTINE AND UH UH ANY QUESTIONS OR UH CLARIFICATIONS OR ANY DISCUSSION ON THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
YES
YEAH SO
YEAH THE THE I'M SORRY BECAUSE UH THE LAST MEETING WE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL THING
UH LET ME GO QUICKLY MAYBE IF I CAN GO BACK
I KNOW THE PROJECT PLAN AND THE BUDGET
SO I CAN CLOSE THIS NOT SURE
WAS IN UH
S
THIS
SO LET ME SEE WHERE IS THIS FILE
THIS IS CHRISTINE
THAT'S YOURS OKAY
SAVING
OKAY UH I WILL I WILL SEND YOU A MAIL OKAY
THE PROJECT MAY BE THE THE PROJECT AIM OKAY
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE COMPANY UH WANTS TO MAKE AT LEAST UH THE FIFTY MILLION EURO
OKAY AND UH OF COURSE THE PRICE WILL BE VERY REASONABLE ON THE THE SALES SIDE
OKAY
THAT MAYBE EDDIE WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT UH HOW MUCH UH THE PRICE AND UH WHAT'S UH HOW MUCH ITS COST FOR THE MANUFACTURING AND HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE WE SELL IN THE MARKET
OKAY
THEN UH YOU CAN COME BACK WITH YOUR FEEDBACK
AND I I HAVE ONE MAYBE THE SUGGESTION OR OPINION
THIS REMOTE CONTROL OKAY IT CAN BE FOR LIKE UNIVERSAL TO USE FOR ANY T. V.
OKAY AND IT WILL BE SLIM OKAY AND UH
NOT FAT
OKAY
YEP
BUT LET'S TRY IT OKAY WITH THE DIFFERENT UH THE DESIGNS OKAY THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGNS
OKAY
SO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS
OKAY
THANK YOU CHRISTINE FOR UH TIME BEING SO THEN UH
ED SO CAN YOU TELL ABOUT
MM-HMM
YEP
YEP
MM-HMM
YEP
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH THE DESIGN
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE IT OR UH
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH THE DESIGN UH WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT OF THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
MM-HMM
YEP
WELL WHAT I CAN UH SUGGEST TO YOU CHRISTINE OKAY UH IF YOU NEED SOME UH THE TECHNICAL FEEDBACK
OR SOME TRAINING OKAY ABOUT UH THIS FACILITY ESPECIALLY FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
I CAN RECOMMEND YOU SOME COMPANIES LIKE UH INTEL OR I. B. M. OKAY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY IN THIS UH SPEECH RECOGNITION PART OKAY
AND UH YOU CAN MAYBE HAVE SOME UH TECHNICAL BACKUP FROM THEM SOME KIND OF A TECHNICAL TIE UP
OKAY AND UH IF YOU WANT I CAN COORDINATE OKAY TO GET SOME INFORMATION OKAY AND UH YOU CAN UH LET ME KNOW
OKAY SO WHAT KIND OF UH THE DETAILS YOU REQUIRE
OKAY TO ADD THIS FEATURE
IN THIS PROJECT
I DON'T THINK IT'S UH THE DIFFICULT
AND UH WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH IS THE TIMEFRAME YOU NEED TO DEVELOP
APART FROM UH WHAT TODAY
YEP
YES
YES
YES
YEP
YEAH BUT BUT END OF THE DAY YOU'RE THE SALES GUY
SO I WILL COME BACK AND SIT ON YOUR HEAD BECAUSE UH YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE YOUR SALES PROJECTION OKAY

THE MONEY FROM THIS PROJECT
YES OKAY I DON'T MIND TO CONVINCE THE THE MANAGEMENT OKAY
THE MANAGEMENT SAYS OKAY SO THEY THEY DON'T WANT CERTAIN FACILITIES WHICH IT'S ALREADY WORKED OKAY THEY WANT SOMETHING UH NEW OKAY
I THINK UH LIKE UH SPEECH RECOGNIT DEFINITELY THEY WILL AGREE I DON'T THINK THEY'LL SAY NO FOR THAT OKAY
AND UH I HOPE I CAN CONVINCE THE MANAGEMENT ON THAT OKAY
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY UH NEW IDEAS OKAY
FOR UH YOUR YOU CAN ALWAYS COME UP AND UH YOU CAN TELL ME IF YOU NEED ANY UH S SPECIAL
OKAY COORDINATION OKAY BETWEEN ANY UH TECHNICAL COMPANIES WHICH YOU CAN UH HIDE THEIR TECHNOLOGY BACKUP
OKAY FOR YOUR UH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OR TECHNICAL DESIGN OKAY THEN I AM READY TO DO THAT
AND UH WHAT'S YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT UH
YEAH SO YOU ARE FINISH ED UH SO I CAN UH
OKAY I'LL UH HAND OVER TO AGNES
JUST GONNA CLOSE THIS
T
UH WHERE ARE YOU HERE
PARTICIPANT THREE
OKAY SO I'LL YEP
OKAY
IS IT OKAY
ALRI
CLICK MM
SO FOR ANYBODY NEED UH ANY HELP FOR TIME BEING ON THIS UH SUBJECTS OKAY SO PLEASE COME BACK TO ME AND UH CHRISTINE
MAYBE I CAN UH TRY TO HELP YOU TO GET SOME UH THE TECHNICAL UH THE COMPANIES TO HELP YOU FOR UH MAKE A DESIGN UH SLIM
OKAY AND TO ADD SOME FEATURES LIKE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND ALL
YEAH
SO NOT REALLY THIS ONE WE ARE TALK AB
OKAY THAT WILL BE GREAT
AND UH I'LL SEND YOU THE THE MINUTES OF MEET
YEAH
OKAY WHAT WE'LL DO IS NOW WE'LL TAKE FOR LUNCH BREAK OKAY THEN UH WE CAN DISCUSS FURTHERMORE
OKAY WITH OUR AREAS AND UH THEN WE WILL COME BACK AGAIN IN THE IN THE NEXT MEETING
SO THANKS FOR COMING AND UH I'LL SEND YOU MINUTES OF MEETING AND UH PLEASE PUT YOUR ALL INFORMATION IN THE SHARING FOLDER SO EVERYBODY CAN SHARE THE INFORMATION
OKAY
SO LET'S GO FOR LUNCH THEN
THANK YOU
MM-HMM
AT LEAST IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
THANK YOU
YEAH
WHY WAS THE PLASTIC ELIMINATED AS A POSSIBLE MATERIAL
MM-HMM
WHIC
WHICH
ALTHOUGH I THINK
I THINK WITH WOOD THOUGH YOU'D RUN INTO THE SAME TYPES OF PROBLEMS WOULDN'T YOU I MEAN IT CHIPS
IT IF YOU DROP IT UH IT'S I'M NOT SU
I THINK IF YOU RE IF YOU USE REALLY GOOD QUALITY WOOD THEN IT MIGHT WORK BUT YOU CAN'T JUST USE
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH
THE STAIN
UM IN TERMS OF COMMENTS ON THIS OR IN TERMS OF MY OWN
Y YEAH
I THINK WE CAN GET THE QUALITY MATERIALS THEN IT SHOULDN'T INFLUENCE THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES TOO MUCH WHICH YOU'LL SEE WITH MY PRESENTATION
ONE THING WE'D HAVE TO CHECK THOUGH IS WHAT THE USERS WHETHER HOW QUICKLY THE NOVELTY WEARS OFF OF HAVING UH YEAH FOR EXAMPLE
SO HAVE TO SEE HOW KID FRIENDLY IT IS AND AND ALL THAT BUT
SURE
ONE POINT THREE YEAH
UH YEAH
I THINK SO YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THE ONE
SO IT'S A VERY SHORT PRESENTATION
'CAUSE I'M ACTUALLY GONNA DRAW YOU THE LAYOUT ON THE BOARD SO IF YOU WANT TO JUST GO STRAIGHT TO THE SECOND SLIDE
UM WHICH BASICALLY SHOWS
SORT OF I TOOK THE IDEAS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LAST TIME UM AND TRIED TO PUT THAT INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL SO THE THINGS THAT Y YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE ON IT ARE THE ON OFF SWITCH
VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL THE MENU ACCESS BUTTON ERGONOMIC SHAPE WHICH I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH CHRISTINE'S IDEA TO HAVE IT SORT OF MOLDED
SO IT'S SLIGHTLY MORE ERGONOMIC AND COMFORTABLE TO HOLD THAN THE R STANDARD VERY STRAIGHT REMOTE CONTROLS
AND ACTUALLY THE OTHER THING WITH THE WOOD IF WE TAKE YOUR CUSTOMISING IDEA IS THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY DO SORT OF QUASI MEASUREMENTS ON THEIR HAND SIZE
SO IF SOMEONE HAS LARGER HANDS YOU HAVE A WIDER REMOTE CONTROL
SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD IDEA FOR CUSTOMI CUSTOMISABILITY
UM ONE THING I THOUGHT MIGHT BE KIND OF INTERESTING IS TO PUT A FLIP SCREEN ON IT JUST LIKE YOU HAVE ON FLIP PHONES
SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CASE WHERE SOMEONE SITS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL OR ACCIDENTALLY PUTS THEIR HAND ON IT
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS AROUND THEY'RE NOT PRESSING THE BUTTONS WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO WATCH A T. V. SHOW AND ACCIDENTALLY CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR TURN IT OFF
AND ALSO UM YOU HAD ISSUES WITH THE BATTERIES RUNNING OUT
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD PUT A LITTLE BATTERY LIFE LIGHT ON IT THAT KIND OF GOES DIMMER AND DIMMER AND DIMMER AS YOUR BATTERY IS STARTS TO DIE
AND IN TERMS OF INVISIBLE FEATURES AUDIO AND UM TACTILE FEEDBACK ON BUTTON PRESSES AND LIKE YOU SAID SPEECH RECOGNITION
SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS THING WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE
DESPITE WORKING IN INTERFACE DESIGN I'M NOT THE GREATEST ARTIST IN THE WORLD SO YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME
YOU'D HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH AN ON OFF SWITCH FAIRLY BIG SORT OF IN THE CORNER AND BY ITSELF
SO YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALLY TURN YOUR T. V. OFF WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO MANOEUVRE OTHER BUTTONS
AND THEN YOU HAVE SORT OF ONE OF THOSE TOGGLE DISPLAYS FOR OOPS
CHANNELS AND VOLUME SORT OF FOR SURFING CHANNELS AND THEN VOLUME
SO THE VOLUME WOULD BE THE UP AND DOWN 'CAUSE VOLUME GOES UP AND DOWN AND THEN CHANNELS LEFT TO RIGHT
AND THEN HERE YOU'D HAVE YOUR SORT OF STANDARD TELEPHONISH
NUMBER PAD
AND THEN ON ONE SIDE YOU WOULD HAVE AN ACCESS TO THE MENU ON YOUR T. V. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE A WAY TO TURN OFF THE VOICE CONTROL
SO THAT IF THE USER DOESN'T WANT TO USE THEIR VOICE THEY CAN JUST TURN IT OFF AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL ACCIDENTALLY CHANGING THINGS ON YOU
UM SO AGAIN YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE L. C. D. LIGHT SOMEWHERE THE FLIP
THING AND HAVE I FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
I DON'T THINK SO
SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S A VERY VERY SIMPLE DESIGN WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY WANTED TO KEEP
IS KEEP IT SIMPLE NOT HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS NOT HAVE TOO MANY FUNCTIONALITIES THROWN INTO IT
THINK THE DESIGN CAN PRETTY MUCH CARRY OVER TO EVERYTHING ALTHOUGH WITH THE WOOD THE FLIP SCREEN MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
YEAH
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO D START WATCHING OUT FOR THE WEIGHT
'CAUSE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THE THE FLIP SCREEN WILL ADD TO THE WEIGHT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO START GETTING TOO HEAVY
BUT THAT'S THE GENERAL LAYOUT WITH THE GENERAL FUNCTIONALITIES IF WE COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S STILL LOTS OF SPACE ON THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTROL AND IF YOU DO IT CUSTOMISABLY
YOU CAN MAKE THIS THING FAIRLY SMALL OR FAIRLY O LARGE DEPENDING ON PERSONAL PREFERENCES
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL I HAD TO SAY I MEAN EVERYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF DESIGN ISSUES
UM THE CENTERING OF THE KEY PAD AND
THE CHANNEL IS JUST DEPENDING ON WHERE YOUR THUMB IS AND YOU TEND TO USE THE THE VOLUME CONTROL AND UH THE BROWSING MORE THAN THE ACTUAL NUMBER PAD
SO THAT WOULD BE SORT OF IN DIRECT LINE OF WHERE YOUR THUMB GOES WHEN YOU ARE HOLDING THE REMOTE CONTROL
THE NUMBER PAD A LITTLE BIT LOWER 'CAUSE IT'S USED LESS FREQUENTLY
SO ONCE WE DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE EXACT POSITIONING BUT MORE OR LESS I THINK IT SHOULD GO ALONG THOSE LINES
MM-HMM
YEAH
NO NO
MM-HMM
YEAH
RIGHT
ESPECIALLY YOU MIGHT NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR TRAINING THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH YEAH
YEAH SO IT'S REALLY MOLDED TO TO YOUR SPECIFIC
BUT TH FOR THAT YOU'D ALSO HAVE TO DO SORT OF AN AVERAGE ACROSS FAMILIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT IF UNLESS EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN PERSONAL REMOTE
THE SALES YEAH
YEAH
WELL ALREADY THE CUSTOMISABILITY IS A REALLY GOOD SORT OF NEW GIMMICK
YEAH
YEAH
AND THAT TOOK OFF YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I THINK IT DEPENDS I MEAN I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
BUT WE NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW USEFUL IT'S GONNA BE BECAUSE THEORETICALLY WITH THE T. V. YOU ALREADY HAVE A BIG DISPLAY RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP COSTS DOWN THEN MAYBE SACRIFICING THE DISPLAY
IS A WAY TO GO
I MEAN IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH PUTTING A DISPLAY COSTS AND WHAT IT WOULD BE USED FOR VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT WOULD BE USED FOR
'CAUSE IF IT'S ONLY USED FOR ONE LITTLE THING THEN PUTTING IN A BIG DISPLAY CASE OR A BIG DISPLAY THAT'S
PROBABLY EXPENSIVE JUST TO DO THE TRAINING ON THE CHIP FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION OR WHATEVER MAY NOT BE THE MOST COST EFFICIENT WAY TO GO BUT
THAT'S JUST SORT OF SPECULATION I MEAN
MM-HMM
WHAT ABOUT THE BUTTONS WOULD
WOULD THE BUTTONS BE WOOD TOO OR
MM-HMM
OKAY
SURE
NO
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
SO UH IF YOU COULD OPEN THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
I'M NUMBER TWO
COMPONENTS DESIGN THERE WE GO
SO UH CAN WE PUT IT IN SLIDE SHOW MODE
YEAH
RIGHT HERE IS THAT LITTLE THAT ONE YES PLEASE
THANK YOU
I'LL TAKE THE MOUSE
SO UH
WE WERE LOOKING HE SPECIFICALLY AT THE COMPONENTS UH THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS UH THE CASE THE POWER SUPPLY UH THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE TELEVISION SET
IN INSTANCE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT USING SOME SORT OF SPEECH RECOGNITION
YOU HAVE TO HAVE MICROPHONE WELL NO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T HAVE TO HAVE MICROPHONE IN THE DEVICE
BUT UM MAYBE YOU DO HAVE IT A A WAY IT HAS TO IT HAS TO HEAR THE SPEAKER AND UM
SO IT COULD BE IN THE TELEVISION SET COULD BE IN THE DEVICE BUT SOMEWHERE YOU HAVE TO PUT THE MICROPHONE
UM AND A W A WAY OF MAKING BEEPS OR SOUNDS SO YOU CAN FIND IT WHEN IT'S GETS LOST
UM SO THE OTHER W THING THAT WE SO
OUR METHOD FOR GOING ABOUT THIS IS WE'VE LOOKED AT UH THE HISTO HI HISTORICAL RECORD WHAT'S WORKED
WHAT HASN'T AND THEN WE ALSO UM WE WANTED TO EVALUATE SOME NEW MATERIALS AND WE CONTACTED MANUFACTURING FOR THEIR INPUT BECAUSE
COURSE WE M MIGHT COME UP AND CHOOSE THE MATERIAL THAT THEN MANUFACTURING DIDN'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGIES OR CAPABILITIES TO OFFER US
SO UH THIS IS THE APPROACH THAT WE TOOK DURING OUR UM OUR RESEARCH
SO UM FOR THE CASE UM WE TOLD WE WERE MAKING A SPECIFICA SPECIFIC ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD BE CURVED IN DESIGN
COURSE YOU KNOW I WANTED IT TO BE EXPANDABLE AND SHRINKABLE
BUT UM THAT UH DOESN'T SEEM TO B BE ONE OF THE CHOIC NON OPTION WE CAN UH WE CAN REALLY SERIOUSLY EXPLORE
SO THEN WE WERE THINKING ABOUT UM RUBBER
BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S BEEN ELIMINATED BECAUSE OF THE HEAT UH FACTOR AND TH UM THERE MIGHT BE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE M UH HOW IT'S
UH GOES WITH THE BOARD
UH AND UH THEN TH PLASTIC ALSO HAS THIS PROBLEM OF MELTING AND IT'S BRITTLE IT GETS BRITTLE AFTER A WHILE
SO UM WE STILL HAD TITANIUM AND AND WOOD AVAILABLE BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY UH UH TITANIUM'S ALSO BEEN ELIMINATED UH
THE M PEOPLE IN MANUFACTURING SAID THAT YOU COULDN'T MAKE D CURVED CASES OUT OF TITANIUM
ALTHOUGH HOW APPLE DID IT WITH TH POWERBOOK I'M NOT SU QUITE SURE BUT UH NEVERTHELESS UM THEY'VE ELIMINATED ALL OF OUR OPTIONS EXCEPT WOOD
SO THIS IS OUR FINDING
AND A AS SHE SAID IT'S AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY UH MATERIAL
SO WE'RE WE'RE CURRENTLY UH PROPOSING UH WE'LL GET TO ALL MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES IN JUST A SECOND
SO THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER MATTER OF THE CHIPS AND UM WELL WE COULD USE A SIMPLE DESIGN ON THE BOARD
BUT UH THESE SIMPLE CHIPS BUT THAT'S ONLY WORKS FOR THE BU YOU DON'T GET VERY MUCH UM INTELLIGENCE WITH THIS SIMPLE ONE
AND UM THEN THERE WAS THE REGULAR WHICH I REGRET THAT I'VE FORGOTTEN EXACTLY WHY I'M ELIMINATING THAT ONE
UH THE OTHER OPTION WAS THIS ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
AND UH WE LIKED TH WE WE FOUND THAT IT IT INCLUDES THIS INFRARED SENDER
WHICH W 'MEMBER THE BEAM WAS THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF FINDING THE RIGHT CHIP
AND UH MANUFACTURING HAS TOLD US THAT THEY'VE UM UH RECENTLY DEVELOPED A UH A SENSOR AND A SPEAKER THAT WOULD UH BE INTEGRATED INTO THIS ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
SO UH WE WE UH NOW JUMPING RIGHT TO OUR PERSONAL PREFERENCES UM I I'D REALLY THINK WE SHOULD
YOU KNOW USE SOME OF UH SOME REALLY EXOTIC WOODS LIKE UM YOU KNOW UH
WELL YOU GUYS COME FROM TROPICAL COUNTRIES SO YOU CAN KINDA THINK OF SOME TREES AND SOME NICE WOODS
I THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL MIGHT REALLY WANT TO DESIGN THEIR OWN CASES YOU SEE
THEY COULD DO SORT OF A THIS UM THREE DIMENSIONAL DESIGN ON THE INTERNET
AND THEN THEY COULD SUBMIT THEIR ORDERS KINDA LIKE YOU SUBMIT A CUSTOM CAR ORDER YOU KNOW
AND YOU CAN CHOOSE THE COLOUR AND THE SIZE OF THE WHEELS AND THE COLOURS OF THE LEATHER AND THINGS LIKE THAT
AND THEN I UH THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH THE SOLAR CELLS AS WELL AS THE UM MICROPHONE AND SPEAKER ON THE ADVANCED CHIP
SO THIS IS THE FINDINGS OF OUR RESEARCH AND MY RECOMMENDATIONS UM FOR THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL W UM WOULD BE TO HAVE UM HAVE IT BE MADE OUT OF WOOD
DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT
I'M NOT SURE HOW DO I OH I KNOW LET'S SEE
LET'S GO BACK UP HERE
I THINK IT'S UM UM A MULTIPLE UH CHIP DESIGN UM AND IT'S UH MAYBE PRINTED ON TO THE CIRCUIT BOARD
UH I COULD FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THAT UH BEFORE THE NEXT FI NEXT MEETING
I DON'T KNOW BUT I'LL FIND OUT MORE AT OUR NEXT MEETING
SOUNDS GOOD
BECAUSE UM IT GETS BRITTLE
CRACKS
UM
WE WANT WE EXPECT THESE UM UH THESE REMOTE CONTROLS TO BE AROUND FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS
SO
GOOD EX GOOD EXPRESSION
I DON'T KNOW SPEAK FOR YOURSELF I'M PLANNING TO BE AROUND FOR A WHILE
YOU'RE WHAT
YOU THINK
AND YOU COULD YOU COULD SELL OILS WITH IT TO TAKE CARE OF IT
WELL I'M GLAD YOU
OKAY GOOD
SORR HAVING A HARD TIME KEEPING WI CONTROL OVER MY FACE
MM-HMM
MM
SHE WORKS IN THE CUBICLE NEXT TO ME SO SHE'S UH SHE WAS ALREADY A LITTLE BIT PREPARED FOR THIS
LUCKILY ED WAS NOT
MM-HMM
YEAH YOU WOULDN'T WANNA HAVE TO HAVE SPLINTERS IN YOUR HAND WHILE YOU'RE USING YOUR
IT'S REALLY GOOD IF YOUR DOG GETS AHOLD OF IT THEY CAN USE IT FOR TEETHING
YEAH THEY DO IT WITH OTHER MATERIALS AS WELL YEAH
OH I'M SORRY
RIGHT MY HAND IS UH DIFFERENT SIZE THAN YOURS FOR EXAMPLE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
A HINGE
BE LIKE A COPPER HINGE OR YOU KNOW
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
SURE
NO F GO TO FINDINGS
CONTEXT SENSITIVE INSTRUCTIONS DEPENDING ON WHAT THE TEL WHAT MODE THE T. V. OR THE D. V. D. OR SOMETHING ELSE IS IN
YOU KNOW
MAYBE WHAT YOU COULD DO IS WHEN SOMEBODY ORDERS THE DEVICE ID YOU COULD SEND THEM LIKE UM A UH UH B SOME SORT OF A FOAM RUBBER UM BALL
AND THEN THEY WOULD SQUEEZE IT AND IT WOULD TAKE THE SHAPE OF THEIR HAND
TO T AN AND THEN YOU WOULD KNOW LIKE UM WHAT THE GEOMETRY OF THEIR HANDS WOULD BE AND UH
YES YOU'D KNOW WHAT KIND OF WOOD TO GET
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT YOU WOULDN'T WANNA GO TOO FAR DOWN THAT
OH THAT THAT ACTUALLY WOULD UH INCREASE THE UM THE REVENUES WE COULD EXPECT YEAH
MM-HMM
RIGHT MM
WE'D ALSO HAVE TO WOR UM CONSIDER THAT UH WHO WE WERE GONNA GET TO MAKE THESE CUSTOM CASES IN TERMS OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
WE MIGHT WANNA UM LEARN ABOUT UM LABOUR LAWS
YOU KNOW IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND STUFF WHER SO WE CAN DO IT CHEAP BUT YOU DON'T WANNA EXPLOIT UH LABOUR IN UM THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES
SO ACTUALLY YOU COULD TURN IT Y TURN AROUND AND SAY THAT YOU'RE UH PAR THE REASON THE COST IS HIGH FOR THE DEVICE IS BECAUSE UM YOU'RE PAYING A A WORKING WAGE TO THE PERSON WHO MADE THE DEVICE
COST OF LIVING IS LOW
GOOD WELL TH THAT'D BE SOMETHING THAT MANUFACTURING WOULD HAVE TO UM EXPLORE MORE AND TO WHERE MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
WHAT DO YOU THINK ED
DO YOU HE LIKED THE DISPLAY IN ONE OF THE CONCEPTS THAT YOU SHOWED UM
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS UM TO TO ADD A LITTLE DISPLAY LIKE THIS UH
DO YOU WANNA TAKE AN ACTION ITEM TO GO FIND OUT
OKAY
SORRY ABOUT THAT
SO THE THE ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT IS WHAT UM WHAT WE'VE
WE'VE DECI WE'VE DETERMINED AND THE UH ENGINEERING INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IS THE RECOMMENDATION
AND UM I THINK WE'VE KINDA COME TO SOME AGREEMENT REGARDING UM THIS CONCEPT OF A WOODEN CASE
A CUSTOMISABLE AND
UH I DON'T THINK SO NO I THINK THEY COULD BE RUBBER LIKE THEY ARE NOW SO YOU HAVE THAT TACTILE EXPERIENCE OF
SO UM ARE WE DONE WITH THIS MEETING
AND A MARKETING STRATEGY
WOW GOOD EXPRESSION
WELL AFTER US
ACTUALLY I'M READY TO SELL IT
I'M READY TO SELL IT
NO Y NO NO NO THE O THE ONLY W THE ONLY WOOD YOU CAN USE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE HARD
EXTREMELY HARD WOOD BUT THERE ARE SOME VERY PRETTY WOODS OUT THERE
THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY INNOVATIVE IDEA
WELL IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY INNOVATIVE N DIFFERENT IDEA THAT UH YOU KNOW YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR COLOUR OF WOOD YOUR TYPE OF WOOD
I MEAN IT'S EACH PERSON IS GONNA HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONALISED INDIVIDUALISED SPEECH RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL IN WOOD THAT'S NOT ON THE MARKET
IN TURNS OF WOW
WOOD
THEY DO THAT ANYWAY WITH THE RUBBER AND PLASTIC SO AND CHEW 'EM UP
AND CHEW 'EM UP
NO
HMM
SIMPLE DESIGN
IT'S WHAT CONSUMERS WANT
IT'S ALMOST LIKE HOUSTON WE HAVE A PRODUCT HERE
PROBLEM IS OBVIOUSLY GONNA BE COST
OKAY I ALSO HAVE A F VERY SIMPLE PRESENTATION BECAUSE FOR THE MARKETING POINT YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE CONSUMERS WANT
I ALSO HAVE UH COPIED A
DIFFERENT TYPE OF REMOTE
IF YOU CAN FIND ME WHERE I'M AT
THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE IN HERE
TREND WATCH
IT'S BEING MODIFIED
THEY'RE STEALING OUR PRODUCT
WE'VE BEEN GIVING SIMPLE QUESTIONNAIRES IN DIFFERENT AREAS BECAUSE TH OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE COM CONSUMERS ARE LOOKING FOR TODAY
'CAUSE UH TRENDS CHANGE VERY VERY QUICKLY
IN SIX MONTHS MAYBE THIS IDEA IS ALREADY GONE OUT THE WINDOW SO IT'S GONNA BE A QUESTION HOW FAST WE CAN ACT
UH THEY ALREADY ERASED THE REST OF MINE HUH
NO NO NO NO
'CAUSE I HAD ANOTHER COMMENT THERE
UH THE MARKET TREND
THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE LAST UH FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRES FROM THE THE ALL THE P SURVEYS WE'VE DONE
FANCY AND FEEL GOOD THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT FEELS GOOD IN THE HAND THAT'S EASY TO USE
LOOKING FOR NEXT GENERATION OF INNOVATION BECAUSE ALL THE REMOTES OUT THERE NOW THEY'RE ALL VERY SIMILAR
THEY ALL DO THE SAME THING WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
OKAY
EASY TO USE HAS ALWAYS HAS BECOME HAS BECOME ANOTHER MAJOR INTEREST THAT UH WITH THE WHITEBOARD WE CAN SEE THAT IT'S A REMOTE THAT'S EASY TO USE
AND I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER THING THAT'S INTERESTING IS THE CONSUMERS ACTUALLY WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE FOR EXCITING TEL TECHNOLOGY
SO EVEN IF WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE IF IT COMES OUT RIGHT IF THEY LOOK IT LOOKS AND FEELS GOOD AND HAS TECHNOLOGY
THE SECOND TWO YOU CAN SEE THE LAST ONE IS A VERY EASY SIMPLE DESIGN
THE SECOND ONE THERE IS ABOUT UH FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DIFFERENT BUTTONS ON IT WHICH MAKES IT FAIRLY HARD TO READ UH VERY HARD TO USE
THE FIRST ONE I SEE THAT THEY PUT IN A DISPLAY
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE UH WITH THE LITTLE FLIP UP NOW WE'RE ADDING ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN BUT WITH THE LITTLE FLIP UP
IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE DISPLAY ON THE FLIP UP THAT WHEN YOU CLOSE IT EVERYTHING IS LOCKED
MAYBE THE DISPLAY ALSO MAKES IT EASIER TO USE BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUTTONS MAYBE IF YOU SEE A DISPLAY
OKAY
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN MOSTLY THE STANDARD ONES YEAH
NOW YOU HAVE IT NOW YOU HAVE ONE WITH THE VERY SIMPLE ALSO
THE IDEA IS SIMPLE BUT WITH A DISPLAY SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
SO MAYBE IF WE CAN INCORPORATE THE EASINESS OF USE
TRENDY FANCY FEELS GOOD
UH WITH A DISPLAY
WOOD DESIGNER WOOD DESIGNER COLOURS WE MIGHT'VE
MM-HMM
HOW HARD THEY SQUEEZE
RESISTANCE RESISTANCE RIGHT
NO BUT INCORPORATING THE THREE UH OBVIOUSLY IT'D BE SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW ON THE MARKET TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND FROM
ALTHOUGH WHAT IT WAS IT UH IT WAS UH NOKIA THAT CAME OUT WITH THIS CHANGEABLE COLOURS
RIGHT YOU TAKE IT APART AND PUT ON ANOTHER FACE TAKE IT OFF AND PUT ON ANOTHER FACE AND THEN THEY SOLD MILLIONS MILLIONS
SO
SO SAY WITH THE F WITH THE FINDINGS WITH THE RESEARCH EASY TO USE SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW THAT IS NOT ON THE MARKET
WHERE W WHERE IT WOULD BE MANUFACTURED IS IS
ANOTHER STEP
WE'RE HERE TO DESIGN
COME UP WITH A NICE PRODUCT
NO
NO NO P SPEC IT'S 'CAUSE WE HAVE TO FIND OUT COST ON IT
UM NO THAT'S NO PROBLEM
I'M HERE FOR THE PUSHING IT AFTER IT'S MADE
I WILL MARKET IT
ONCE WE GET A PRICE ON IT THEN WE CAN MARKET IT
NICE BEAUTIFUL MAHOGANY RED WOODEN CASE
AND MARKETING STRATEGY THANK YOU
FIRED
UH WELCOME BACK AFTER LUNCH I HOPE UH YOU HAD A GOOD LUNCH
TOGETHER
FOR UH THIS MEETING THE MAIN AGENDA OKAY UH TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
OKAY AND THE AGENDA WILL BE
THE OPENING AND UH THAT'S UH THE PRODUCT MANAGER OR SECRETARY THAT'S ME AND UH THE PRESENTATIONS FROM THE CHRISTINE AND UH
AGNES AND FROM MISTER ED
AND FINALLY IN THIS MEETING WE HAVE TO DECIDE
AND WE ARE TO TAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
CONCEPT AND UH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
SO WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES I THINK IT'S UH
LITTLE BIT UH LOW BUT I I HOPE WE CAN FINISH IT UP SO I'LL HANDLE TO THE
THE FUNCTIONAL TEAM TO THE CHRISTINE OKAY TO DISCUSS ABOUT UH THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT
YOU'RE NUMBER TWO
'KAY
THE NEXT ONE
CAN YOU GO BACK UH ONE SLIDE
YES UH QUESTION UH WHAT'S MEAN EXACTLY ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THAT
MM-HMM
YEAH IS IT MEANS IT'S ON THE YEAH IS IT ON A MICRO PROC MICRO PROCESSOR BASED OR UH
OKAY THA THAT WOULD BE GREAT SO IF YOU FIND OUT FROM THE TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE GOOD
SO SO YOU'RE NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THE THE WOOD YES
YEAH SO IT IT'S LOOKS GOOD THE THE DESIGN THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UH WHAT ABOUT YO YOU
YES IN T YES IN TERM IN TERMS OF COMMENTS FIRST
OKAY THEN UH LET'S MOVE TO AGNES
S YOU'RE
YOU ARE IN PARTICIPANT THREE
THIS ONE
SO WHAT'S YOUR UH THE COMMENTS OR UH
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
THE
YEAH
I HOPE SO
YEAH BUT WE CAN GET A PRODUCTION IN UH COUNTRIES LIKE UH INDIA YES YES
COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA OR CHINA OR MALAYSIA SO YOU CAN GO A BETTER FEATURES AND BETTER PRICE AND YOU CAN SELL MORE
SO
YEAH YEAH SO
YES
SO
YEAH SO
YES UH BUT UH THAT THAT WE CAN THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCTION LATER OKAY DEPENDS ON THE THE QUANTITY OKAY
SO WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE OUR OWN UH FABRIC FACTORY OR SOMETHING SO WE CAN HAVE A TIE UP WITH WHO THE DO THE FABRIC OKAY
FOR THE DIFFERENT UH ELECTRONICS ITEMS THEN WE CAN HAVE A BUSINESS TIE UP AND TO GET TO CUT THE COST OKAY TO SELL MORE
SO BUT UH LE LET'S DECIDE FIRST ABOUT THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT AND UH INTERFACE CONCEPT
OKAY IF IS ACCEPTABLE FOR BOTH OF YOU WHAT UH ED WAS TALKING
AND YOUR DESIGN WHETHER YOU WANT WITH THE DISPLAY OR WITHOUT DISPLAY OR JUST A SIMPLE SO
YES
I DON'T THINK SO
YES
YES
DON'T LOOKS NICE UH
YEAH SO UH WHAT WE'LL DO IS UH
WE WILL STICK WITH THE THE SIMPLE DESIGN FOR TIME BEING UNTIL UH TH ED FIND OUTS ABOUT THE HOW MUCH IT'S COST TO THE EXTRA
IN CASE WE GO FOR THE DISPLAY
OKAY
SO MAYBE WHAT YOU CAN DO IS UH BOTH OF YOU YOU CAN COME UP WITH THE THE PROTOTYPE OKAY THE MODEL
OKAY
YEAH I HOPE IF IS IT OKAY IF UH THEY WILL COME UP WITH THE PROTOTYPE DESIGN OKAY
THEN THEY CAN SHOW YOU HOW IT LOOKS LIKE AND THEN WE CAN UH SUBMIT TO THE I WILL SUBMIT TO THE MANAGEMENT
OKAY
THEN MEANTIME YOU CAN COME UP WITH THE PRICE HOW MUCH IT'S COST AS EXTRA FOR UH THE DISPLAY
AN AND THE MARKETING STRATEGY THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT OKAY
YES
HOW MUCH YOU CAN
HOW MU HOW MUCH HOW MUCH YOU CAN SELL EXTRA
OF COURSE YOU'LL MAKE MONEY TOO SO IT
IT'S NOT ONLY PAY OUT YOU MAKE MONEY TOO YOUR COMMISSION
OKAY SO ANY QUESTIONS
SO BY NEXT MEETING SO PLEASE COME UP WITH THE THE PROTOTYPE OKAY THEN UH THEN WE CAN PROCEED FROM THERE
IT'S OKAY
SO THANKS FOR ALL YOUR UH EFFORTS AND COMING FOR THE MEETING AGAIN AND SEE YOU SOON THEN
OKAY
THANK YOU
YEAH
THANKS
MM OKAY
I'VE DONE A PRESENTATION BUT IT PRETTY MUCH COVERS WORK THAT WE'VE BOTH DONE SO IF I'M MISSING ANYTHING CHRISTINE CAN JUST CORRECT ME
IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST POWERPOINT PRESENTATION IN THE WORLD BUT
THREE
UM
NO IT'S THINK IT'S THE LAST ONE
NO THEN THIS IS THE LA YEAH THAT ONE FINAL DESIGN
IT IS NAMED APPROPRIATELY YOU JUST COULDN'T SEE THE NAME
UM OKAY CAN I HAVE THE MOUSE
THANKS
ALRIGHT SO
FROM WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING SPECIFYING THE CASE IN THE LAST MEETING WE DECIDED THAT WE WANTED AN ERGONOMIC SHAPE
THE MATERIAL THAT WE CHOSE WAS WOOD AND UH THE COLOUR WOULD BE CUSTOMISABLE 'CAUSE YOU CAN STAIN THE WOOD WHATEVER COLOUR
UM SO IN TERMS OF FUNCTION YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF
VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL MENU CONTROL VOICE RECOGNITION CONTROL
AND WE'VE INCORPORATED THE L. C. D. SCREEN ON THE FLIP PANEL AS PART OF THE DESIGN
IF WE FIGURE OUT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE WELL THEN YOU JUST TAKE IT OFF
UM SO
TO UNVEIL OUR LOVELY PRODUCT
THIS IS OUR REMOTE CONTROL WITH THE FLIP PANEL AS YOU CAN SEE
SO IF YOU LIFT UP THE PANEL YOU CAN SEE THE LOVELY YELLOW L. C. D. DISPLAY
UM THIS IS ACTUALLY HARD TO DO
THE YELLOW BUTTON YOU HAVE IS THE ON OFF BUTTON SO IT'S REALLY BIG HARD TO MISS
YOU HAVE THE THE RED UM TRIANGLES ARE THE TOGGLES FOR CHANGING THE VOLUME
SO UP VOLUME UP DOWN VOLUME DOWN
THE GREEN ARE THE CHANNEL CHANGING
S AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE VERY LIGHT VERY TOUCHABLE DISPLAYS
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE NUMERIC PAD IN THE DARK BLUE AT THE BOTTOM AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU HAVE THE ACCESS TO THE MENU ON THE T. V.
AND ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU HAVE THE THE THE ABILITY TO TURN OFF THE VOICE RECOGNITION
SO THIS IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE HAD ON THE WHITE BOARD THE LAST TIME
SO
OH YES
ADDITIONAL FEATURE ON THE BACK IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN CUSTOMISED BACKING AND I SUPPOSE YOU COULD DO THE SAME THING ON THE FLIP CASE ON THE FRONT
SO THAT YOU CAN REALLY MAKE THIS A HIGHLY HIGHLY CUSTOMISABLE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE UNDER THE FLIP EITHER BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL CLOSED BUT YOU STILL MIGHT WANT TO ACTIVATE IT BY VOICE
BUT IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THE REMOTE CONTROL IN YOUR HAND YOU NEED TO OPEN THE FLIP TO USE THE VOICE
WHY USE THE VOICE WHY NOT JUST USE YOUR HAND
I MEAN THE WHOLE POINT OF THE VOICE IS THAT IF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS SITTING THERE AND I'M TOO LAZY TO REACH OVER AND PICK IT UP
I CAN JUST USE MY VOICE
YEAH
AND YOU DON'T WANNA LET GO OF EITHER ONE
I MEAN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ON THE FLIP IT CAN BE ON THE SIDE SOMEWHERE
YEAH
SO I MEAN I CAN PASS THIS AROUND IF ANYONE WANTS TO
YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
YES
AND MAYBE THE SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS THE LITTLE EGG SHAPES AREN'T THE MOST ECONOMICAL BUT
YEAH
I MEAN THIS IS PLASTICENE
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO
WE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY MADE IT A LOT THINNER AS WELL
BUT
AND PART OF THE THING IS M A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY DON'T LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S TOO LIGHT
BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE ENOUGH CONTROL OVER IT
SO I MEAN MAYBE THIS IS EXCESSIVELY HEAVY BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO HAVE SOME WEIGHT IT NEEDS TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE STILL HOLDING SOMETHING
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR OUR PRESENTATION ACTUALLY
YEAH
NO WE DO BUT IT'S NOT FILLED IN
IT'S NUMBER THIRTY
OH YEAH YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT SORRY YES
UM HMM
YES
THAT'S NO I THINK IT'S THE SAME ONE
FUNCTIONAL
IT LOOKS LIKE IT THERE'S
S YEAH
UM HMM
MM
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING YEAH
DIRECTLY
UM HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YOU CAN DO A SHIPPING CENTRE SOMEWHERE OR STRATEGICALLY PLACE SHIPPING CENTRES TO MINIMISE DISTANCE COSTS
YEAH
THAT ACTUALLY MAKES MORE SENSE IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT SO HIGHLY CUSTOMISABLE 'CAUSE ON THE WEB PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THEY HAVE
SEE MAYBE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE WHAT THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITY AS
WHEREAS IF YOU'RE IN A STORE YOU CAN'T UNLESS YOU'RE A HIGHLY IMAGINATIVE PERSON
YOU MAY NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU WANT
WHEREAS ON THE WEB IF YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PICTURES IT CAN SORT OF TRIGGER IDEAS AND
YEAH
THE WEIGHT AND FEEL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YES
MM-HMM
WHAT TURNAROUND TIME DO WE HAVE
'CAUSE I MEAN PRODUCTION EVALUATION CAN BE VERY VERY QUICK OR VERY VERY LONG
YEAH
MM-HMM
THINK MINIMUM TWO WEEKS IF WE'RE GONNA DEVELOP PROTOTYPES AND THEN TRY TO TAKE THEM TO DIFFERENT PLACES AND SEE HOW PEOPLE USE IT'S NOT A TRIVIAL TASK
NO NO
WE DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T DO IT IN OUR FACTORY
WHAT AB
WELL I WAS JUST WONDERING ABOUT IF WE'RE GONNA DO A PRODUCT EVALUATION THEN WHAT ABOUT TIME FOR REDESIGN IF THE USERS COME BACK AND TELL US NO THIS IS BAD
THIS IS BAD WE WANT THIS DONE DIFFERENTLY
THE PROBLEM IS THERE MIGHT NOT BE A SECOND GENERATION IF THE FIRST GENERATION FLOPS FOR SOME SILLY REASON THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF
NO
BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELEASING A PRODUCT THAT HAS BEEN MINIMALLY TESTED AND FINE TUNED TO SUIT A GENERAL RANGE OF REQUIREMENTS VERSUS RELEASING A PRODUCT THAT WE THINK WILL WORK BUT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO BACK IT UP
YES BUT I'M NOT EVERYBODY
I MEAN THE WHOLE POINT OF USER EVALUATION IS TO SEE WHAT REAL PEOPLE NEED
WE HAVE OUR OWN MOTIVATIONS IN MIND WE HAVE OUR OWN IDEAS IN MIND BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA SELL
YEAH OF COURSE
I'M JUST TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT I THINK THAT YOUR EVALUATION AND REDESIGN TURNAROUND TIME IS TOO SHORT WELL YOU HAVE NO REDESIGN NOT YOU PERSONALLY
BUT IN THE PROJECT WE HAVE NO REDESIGN TIME AND
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD PLACE TO ADVERTISE IT TOO
YEAH
MM-HMM
IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO TO KEEP IN MIND 'CAUSE IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
A LOT OF PRODUCTS HAVE GONE OUT THERE WITHOUT BEING PROPERLY USER TESTED AND COMPLETELY FLOPPED
WHEN IN FACT IT GETS RE RELEASED A FEW YEARS DOWN THE LINE WITH PROPER TESTING AND IT TAKES OFF LIKE CRAZY
REALLY
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
EXACTLY
OKAY
THANKS
BYE
I'M SORRY TO BE LATE
AGNES YES
UH THANK YOU SO YOU DID A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION GOOD FOR YOU
UM AND UH I COULD
YEAH THE D
WE HAVEN'T UM UH SPECIFIED WHERE THE SPEAKER OR THE MICROPHONE WILL BE PLACED
THAT DEPENDS ON THE UH S DESIGN OF THE CIRCUIT BOARD INSIDE AND UH WHAT ROOM IS LEFT UM
YES OKAY
UH-HUH
NO I MEAN IT DEPENDS ON THE DESIGN OF THE CIRCUIT BOARD
MAYBE I'VE GOT MY HAND IN THE POPCORN BOWL AND I'M HOLDING MY CUP OF COCA COLA IN THE OTHER HAND
MM-HMM
YEAH Y BETTER YOU PASS IT AROUND WITH A NAPKIN
IT'S UM
IT'S UM
YOU NEED TO WORK ON THE WEIGHT A LITTLE BIT
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE SATISFIED
MM-HMM
YES GREAT I I'M SURPRISED
CONGRATULATIONS
OH OKAY
IT'S GONNA COST A LONG WAY TO C YOU KNOW COST A LOT OF MONEY TO MARKET IT IS IT
THIRTY
SO THAT MEANS WE CAN PUT THE UH
THE L. C. D. IN YEAH
ALTHOUGH CUSTOMISATION BECAUSE THIS IS BEING DONE YOU KNOW THE ON ON ORDER BASIS
IT MIGHT BE UH THE THE QUANTITY WON'T M WON'T UH THE CIRCUIT BOARD WILL B YOU'RE RIGHT
WOULD BE IN PRODUCING QUANTITY BUT THE COST OF THE CASE WOULD UH BE FIXED AT THE
UH YOU GOT SOME PRETTY CHEAP LABOUR THAT CAN DO THIS CASE FOR ONE EURO
THAT'S REALLY THAT'S THE COST OF THE MATERIAL AND LAB WOW THAT'S REALLY OUTSTANDING
IS THIS THE SAME ONE YOU DID BEFORE
OKAY
YEAH NO KIDDING
MAYB MAYBE THEY ALREADY EXPECTED SOMETHING
COULD COULD I GO TO FINDINGS
UH UH UM I WOULD UH LIKE TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF USING UM ALTERNATIVE UM DELIVERY AND SALES CHANNEL WHICH WOULD BE UM TO USE THE INTERNET FOR PROMOTION AND ORDERING AND THEN TO DROP SHIP THE P PRODUCT TO THE CUSTOMER'S RESIDENCE
THAT WAY YOU HAVE NO STORAGE YOU HAVE NO UM YOU DO HAVE TRANSPORTATION STILL HAVE THE LABOUR COST
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE TRANSPORT TO THE UH POINT OF SALE
THE POINT OF SALE IS ONLINE
RIGHT LIKE AMAZON
IN FACT WE SHOULD SELL THROUGH AMAZON DON'T YOU THINK
OR EBAY YEAH
THERE'S AN IDEA
GOING WITH UM
AH WE WE'RE DO YOU KNOW SELLING A UNIQUE PRODUCT UH
MM
MM
MM-HMM
AND YOU CAN EVEN HAVE AN A MOVIE THAT YOU CAN ROTATE THE OBJECT AND LOOK AT THE DI THE ONLY THING THAT YOU'RE MISSING REALLY IS THE WEIGHT
MM
WE'RE GETTING USED TO THAT
IT'S NOT QUITE LIKE TRYING ON A SHOE BUT
PEOPLE ARE GETTING USED TO BUYING THINGS ONLINE THAT THEY CAN'T TOUCH BEFORE BUYING
UH-HUH
GREAT
WORKS FOR ME
PROTOTYPES YOU MEAN
IN UM
WE PROBABLY SHOULD DO SOME MARKET TESTS UH ONCE WE HAVE THE PROTOTYPES AND DO SOME ORDERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND TEST MARKET IT
ANY OUTSTANDING
NO I'M GO AHEAD
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING
SECOND GENERATION
OUR PROJECT DOESN'T UM
ED D DO YOU KNOW WHAT SEASON OF THE YEAR OR TIME OF THE YEAR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR T. V. REMOTE CONTROL SALES
WOULD IT BE THE CHRISTMAS SEASON BY ANY CHANCE
SPORTS SEASON
WHICH SPORT SEASON
SO SO
MAYBE WHAT
SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS PERHAPS TO SYNCHRONISE THE FINAL THE THE LAUNCH OF A USER TESTED DEVICE WITH SOME SPECIAL EVENT
AND AND THEN UM SO THAT GIVES US A LITTLE MORE TIME PERHAPS THEN WE ANTICIPATED
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WORLD CUP IS BUT I'M SURE THERE'S GONNA BE ONE
OR ANOTHER M MAJOR SPORTS EVENT
PROBABLY NOT THE UM THE FOOTBALL GAMES COMING UP THE END OF JANUARY
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVE UM BUT SO
I'M JUST IG UH POINTING OUT A UH A STRATEGY TO UH DO SOME ADDITIONAL USER TESTING PRI AND THEN TO LAUNCH UM AT A A MAJOR SPORTS EVENT OR UH PERHAPS TO UH ALSO
AND TO WORK WITH MOTION PICTURES
THERE MIGHT BE SOME MOTION PICTURES THAT ARE COMING OUT UM THAT ARE COMING OUT ON D. V. D. THAT UH THEY NEED TO HAVE A M SPECIAL REMOTE CONTROL TO WORK WITH IT
SO WE COULD MAYBE WORK OUT A CAMPAIGN WITH UH WITH SONY PICTURES FOR EXAMPLE
MAYBE SOME MANAGEMENT HAS GOT UH RELATIONSHIPS THERE WE CAN LEVERAGE
THAT'S GREAT
DISPOSABLE DIAPERS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IN FACT
YES IT IS ONE OF THE FIRST CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT WAS LAUNCHED ABOUT THIRTY YEARS THAT WAS A DISPOSABLE CONSUMER PRODUCT
AND UH PEOPLE THE MARKET HADN'T REALLY GOTTEN ON TO THE CONCEPT THAT YOU COULD USE SOMETHING AND THEN THROW IT AWAY
'CAUSE IT WASN'T UH BUT THEN WHEN THEY RE LAUNCHED THEM THIRTY YEARS LATER THEY WERE VIRTUALLY THE SAME DESIGN BUT PEOPLE HAD GOTTEN THE THROW AWAY YOU KNOW
PAPER CUPS AND NAPKI Y ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY HADN'T UM SO
YOU'RE RIGHT TIMING IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT A GOOD PRODUCT
THAT'S RIGHT
IT'S GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY
GOOD LUCK ED
YOU LOOK VERY RELAXED CONSIDERING H YOU KNOW THE UH THE WEIGHT ON YOUR SHOULDERS YEAH
SOUNDS GOOD
THANK YOU
NICE WORKING WITH YOU
PROBABLY
TECHNICAL PA I WOULD THINK
HA
I DON'T WANNA SAY
LOUDER
YEAH
CAN ALSO BE ON THE SIDE
NO
BECAUSE Y YOU CAN EASILY PUT A MICROPHONE ON THE SIDE THAT WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WOULD HAVEN'T BEEN NOT BE DAMAGED OR ANYTHING
AND IT'D BE ACCESSIBLE ALL THE TIME TO VOICE
YEAH
COMPLIMENTS TO THE ARTIST
UH
WELL THE PROTOTYPE IS IS VERY WELL WITHIN THE DESIGN AND IDEAS THAT WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS
NOW IT GOES INTO THIS NEXT PHASE AS THE FINANCIAL UH MARKETING UH
WELL WE HAVEN'T COME TO MINE YET SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION YES
WELL IT JUST DEPENDS ON IF WE'RE GONNA ADD A O ON THIS PR
PROVISIONARY COST ANALYSIS WE DO NOT HAVE A L. C. DISPLAY
L. C. DISPLAY IS GONNA BE VERY EXPENSIVE IT'S GONNA BE
IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T SAY
WE DON'T HAVE THE PRICE UP THERE OKAY SO IF WE ADD APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE EURO PER
REMOTE NOW WE'RE UP AROUND ABOUT TWELVE TWELVE AND A HALF AS TO WHAT UH THE COMPANY HAD INITIALLY UH REQUESTED
UM
DISPLAY IN
BUT AS FAR AS PRODUCTION UM I'M PUTTING UP A QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROFIT ALSO AND IN MINE YOU'LL SEE UH
THE PROBLEM WITH UH OUR SURVEY THE P THE POSSIBILITY THAT HOW MANY UNITS CAN BE SOLD
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET ETCETERA ETCETERA BECAUSE THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN IN INTO CONSIDERATION
UH THIS IS JUST PRODUCTION COST IT IS NOT UH ADVERTISING COST IT'S NOT TRANSPORTATION COST UH
AND THAT WILL INFLATE QUITE A BIT THE COST OF THE UH THE COST OF THE UNIT FOR THE COMPANY
SO TO COME UP WITH WHAT THE COMPANY WANTS IS A FIFTY MILLION POUND PROFIT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO A LONG WAYS
YES
SLIGHTLY
IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD TO REDUCE
THAT'S NOT BAD
IF WE CAN GO TO TO MY DISPLAY
AND WE'LL COME BACK TO YOURS JUST TO GIVE EVERYBODY AN IDEA OF THE MARKET
SO NOW I'M GONNA SCARE EVERYBODY OUT OF THIS PROJECT
IF I'M STILL HERE
YEP
THE FOUR GIVES ME IT'S GOTTA BE UH TRENDWATCH
NO
IT SHOULDN'T BE IF IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE
NO NO WE G NO THAT'S THE SAME ONE
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND FIND ANOTHER ONE
WHATEVER NAME IT POPPED UP UNDER
UH FUNCTIONAL TRY FUNCTIONAL IT MIGHT NOT BE IT EITHER BUT WE'LL SEE
YEP THAT'S IT
SO WE'LL GO SCREEN BY SCREEN
ALTHOUGH SINCE UH WE NEED TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF IDEA ON A MARKET UH WE HAD INDEPENDENT STUDY THAT SAYS IT THIS THIS MARKET HAS AN AVAILABILITY TO ABSORB EIGHT MI EIGHT MILLION UNITS PER YEAR
OKAY
OUR INTERNAL COMPANY EVALUATION PUTS IT BETWEEN EIGHT TO NINE MILLION WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AS THE INDEPENDENT STUDY
SO IF WE CONTINUE WE'LL LOOK AT THE FINDINGS
NEXT SCREEN
WHICH MEANS THAT UH IF WE HAVE A TARGET OF TWO MILLION WOULD THE COMPANY HAS TO TAKE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MARKET IN THE FIRST YEAR
WHICH IS ACTUALLY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
NO KIDDING YEAH
SO IF WE PUT AN INFLATED PRICE OF FIFTY EURO AT A PRODUCTION COST THAT CANNOT EXCEED TWENTY FIVE EURO
OKAY WE'RE ALREADY IN THAT THAT PRICE OKAY WITH TRANSPORT
PROMOTION LABOUR BECAUSE WE HAV GI INCLUDED THE PROMOTION IN THE COST
TRANSPORT FOR THE MATERIAL TO THE STORES OR WHATEVER HOW HOWEVER WE'RE GONNA BREAK THIS DOWN BETWEEN OUR OUR RETAILERS
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MARKET TO GET TO TWO MILLION UNITS
AT TWO MILLION UNITS WE HAVE TO HAVE A PROFIT OF TWENTY FIVE EURO PER UNIT TO GET TO THE FIFTY MILLION UNIT EU EURO PROFIT
OKAY
SO OBVIOUSLY WE W W I JUST DID A RUN DOWN THE EVALUATION OF THE FORM
THE FAN UH THE FANCY STYLISHNESS OF THE OF THE UNIT THE EASE OF USE SPEECH RECOGNITION COST WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE
NOW THE COMPANY MUST EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE ENOUGH OF THE MARKET TO JUSTIFY IN PRODUCTION
OR WE PROJECT THIS OVER TWO YEARS BUT BEING THAT THE MARKET CHANGES VERY VERY QUICKLY
MAYBE THERE'S NO MORE INTEREST IN BUYING THIS THING IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS FROM NOW
SO NOW WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A DECISION
CAN THE COMPANY SELL TWO MILLION UNITS
CAN IT SELL IT FOR FIFTY EUROS
S UPSCALE TECHNOLOGY
WELL
THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE GONE THAT WAY
WEIGHT THE FEEL OF THE PRODUCT BUT
THERE ARE SEVERAL THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH WITH THE WATCHES TOO
YOU CAN CUSTOMISE A WATCH YOU CAN SEE HOW IT IS AT THE F AT THE END OF THE PRODUCTION YOU CAN CHANGE IT UH
THERE'S A LOT OF ONLINE THAT'S THAT IS DOING THIS NOW
AND WHEN YOU'RE ROTATING YOU'LL LOOK BEHIND AND LOOK THIS WAY UH IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO WITH THIS
MAYBE THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF SELLING MORE THAN TWO MILLION UNITS IN ONE YEAR
WHICH COULD YOU KNOW FEASIBILI FEASIBILITY UH LOWER THE PRICE OF THE UNIT
WELL OBVIOUSLY
MM THAT'D HAVE TO BE THROWN OUT ON THE MARKET FOR PEOPLE TO GET AN IDEA TO SEE GET GET THEIR
I THINK WE PRETTY MUCH COVERED EVERYTHING
WELL THEN IT MAY NOT BE
LIKE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WOOD
VERY SPECIFIC

IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO BIG BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN MAKE IT TOO SMALL 'CAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE A LOT OF FUNCTIONS SO
WE CAN'T MAKE IT SMALLER THAN THE THINGS WE SEE NOW I THINK
YEAH
OR WE HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING UH
LIKE UH MOBILE PHONES THAT YOU CAN UH FOLD IT OPEM
MAYBE THEN YOU CAN MAKE IT S SMALLER AND UNIQUER
MAYBE MORE TRENDY
FOLD OPEN WHERE YOU CAN SEE UH MORE OPTIONS
I THINK
YEAH SOMETHING UH ON TOP JUST DREN GENERAL THINGS LIKE VOLUME AND T. V. CHANNELS AND INSIDE THINGS YOU DON'T USE THAT OFTEN
YEAH B I WANTED
NO YOU CAN MAKE AN UH MANUAL IN IT
BUT THAT'S YEAH I THINK IT'S MUCH UH TOO EXPENSIVE
YEAH TOO FRAGILE
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT YEAH WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PRICE NOW I THINK
WELL UH HOW MUCH IS YOUR UH STANDARDS UH MOBILE PHONE RECHARGER
MAYBE HAVE UH
YEAH 'CAUSE WELL
YEAH
MAYBE UH USE IT AS A SEPARATE OPTION
SELL IT UH SEPARATELY
RECHARGEABLE
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT 'CAUSE WELL YOU CAN DO THE STANDARD WAY BUT THEN YOU WON'T
WELL YOU CAN UM
HAVE UH THE BASIC THINGS ON THE SAME PLACE LIKE ON OFF BUTTON ON TOP AND THE T. V. CHANNELS ONE TWO THREE FOUR AS A BLOCK
AND THEN THE VOLUME UH OBVIOUSLY ON T ON TOP SO YOU CAN SEE
BUT THE REST IS UH YOU DON'T USE THAT OFTEN
SO IF YOU HAVE A CLEAR BUTTON WITH AN GOOD ICON ON IT IT SHOULD BE CLEAR AS WELL
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PLACE IT IS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL I THINK SO YOU CAN DO SOMETHING UNIQUE WITH THAT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT
UH
OKAY BUT YEAH
NO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH IT
YEAH I ALSO WROTE DOWN SOME STUFF THAT YOU WANT ON A
TECHNICAL FUN FU

WE DON'T HAVE UH THE SAME TELEVISION UH ALL THE TIME SO UH THAT'S NO MATTER
UM IF WE UH CONTROL THE V. C. R. AND THE D. V. D. PLAYER PLAYER WITH IT
UH IT HAS TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE UH KIDS AND UH ELDERLY ARE GONNA USE IT SO UH IT'S NOT ONLY FOR THE UH TECHNICAL PERSONS

YES
AH THAT'S THAT'S
AH RIGHT RIGHT
OH THAT'S GOOD YEAH
YEAH

YEAH AND A LOTS UH UH LOTS OF KIDS USE IT AND TOUCHSCREEN IS NOT UH KIDS UH
UM
MA MAYBE A HOME STATION
YEAH
AH YEAH
YEAH BUT A HOME STATION IS UH A REALLY GOOD IDEA
BECAUSE UH LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE UH LOSE THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AND DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS AND NOW YOU CAN PUT IT ALWAYS AT THE SAME PLACE
MAYBE IT'S
THEREFORE IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT MAYBE IT'S EXPENSIVE
YEAH
YOU CAN YEAH YOU CAN BUY IT WITH IT

NORMALLY YOU CAN PRESS ONE ZERO OR
A TEN PLUS OR
OKAY
BUT DO WE STILL NEED A TWO LEVEL REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE IF WE ONLY HAVE THAT L ONLY F NO
YEAH
MAYBE IT'S STILL STILL A GOOD IDEA I'M NOT SURE
YOU'LL ALSO HAVE TO USE A MUTE BUTTON TO TO
MAYBE NOT I DON'T KNOW WHERE WHERE YOU HAVE TO PUT IT
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
DOES IT HAVE TO BE UH IT HAS TO BE UH WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS OR
IT'S LIKE A IMAC OR SOMETHING
JUST TO MAKE IT
BUT IT LOOKS CHEAP AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL THING
IT'S ONLY TWENTY FIVE EUROS
IT LOOKS VERY CHEAP IF YOU MAKE IT
OH YOU JUST I DUNNO WHAT HAPPENED

UH THAT'S COOL
NO WE HAVE A RECHARGER IN IT SO
IF WE CAN STILL MAKE THAT THEN
BUT IT'S COOL IF IT WAS GREEN
GREEN OR RED OR WHATEVER IT IS COOL
I JUST SAY CAN YOU S JUST SAY IT AGAIN BECAUSE I WAS JUST LOOKING THERE'S JUST A SHORT
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
SO THAT'S THE LED L. E. D.
YEAH OKAY
SO WE CAN MAKE THE NORMAL ONE ALSO A NORMAL LIGHT
NOT A LED LIGHT BUT AS A NORMAL ONE
TO FLASH UP YOUR
YEAH
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO UH PUT UH A SMALL LIGHT AROUND THE BUTTON YOU PUSH
SO YOU SEE GREEN IF YOU PUSH THAT BUTTON
YEAH BUT IF YOU U IF YOU DO THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE UH SENDING A SIGNAL
AND IT'S YOU ALSO KNOW WHICH BUTTON YOU P
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
BUT IT
BUT DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE FOR THE ENERGY YOU USE
YOU GOT STILL ONE LED
THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT YEAH
THE SAME AS A TELEPHONE OR A MOBILE PHONE OR WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IF YOU PUSH
IT LIGHTS UP
EVERYTHING LIGHTS UP
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
IT IT ONLY TAKES A L A LITTLE ENERGY AND IT'S NOT THAT MUCH
IT'S F YEAH
MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR OLD PEOPLE AS WELL
IT'S ONLY FEW LEDS
ONLY FOUR OR SOMETHING
FOUR LED
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA OKAY
EVERYTHING AGRE EVERYONE AGREES WITH THAT OR OKAY
YEAH AND THEN YOU
OKAY YEAH
BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SOUND DEVICE IN IT THEN
BUT YEAH
OKAY
ARE YOU ALMOST FINISHED OR JUST
OKAY
OKAY
NO WORRY
YEAH I JUST WANT TO TALK SOME ABOUT SOME MORE
SO MAYBE YOU HAVE TO YEAH
OKAY
SO THIS OH SORRY
WH WHAT'S THAT
SO UH OH SORRY
WE HAVE SOME NEW UH PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
WE HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK WHAT THEY ARE
THEY'RE STILL IN UM
UH TELETEXT HAS BECOME OUTDATED SINCE THE POPULARITY OF INTERNET
SO A TELETEXT OPTION MAYBE WE HAVE TO SKIP THAT ONE
I'M NOT SURE
I DON'T THINK SO BUT
YEAH AND IT'S IT'S ON YOUR COMP IT'S ON YOUR TELEVISION
IT'S ONLY ONE BUTTON
SO I DON'T THINK IT IS WE DEFINITELY SHOULD USE IT
UM
YEAH THAT'S UH WHAT I TOLD YOU
THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR A TELEVISION
SO THAT'S MAYBE EASIER
AND UM THE THE FORTY PLUS PEOPLE I ALREADY TOLD YOU
OH NO SORRY
OH THIS IS A PROBLEM
OH SORRY ABOUT THAT
THE NEW PRODUCT SHOULD REACH A NEW MARKET WITH CUSTOMERS ARE THE YOUNGER THAN FORTY
SO IT SHOULD BE FLASHY OR JUST MORE INTERESTING
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT
I JUST I JUST DIDN'T READ IT WELL
SO DOES IT MAKE SOME DECISION ABOUT THAT
THAT STILL STAYS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE WE HAVE TO INTEGRATE THAT AS WELL
IF IT'S POSSIBLE
BUT
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE ACTUALLY
WHY SHOULD IT
YOU ONLY HAVE A MICROPHONE IN IT
NAH MAYBE
MAYBE MAYBE IT'S TOO HARD TO UH TO REALISE THAT
IT WE HAVE SHORT TIME TO TO PUT IT ON THE MARKET SO THAT
WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF TESTING BEFORE WE CAN DO THAT
WE MAKE UH MAKE UH WE CAN MAKE TH TH THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL VERY FLASHY
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK SO
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS
SO YOU CAN SEE ON THE UH SO WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT ON
DO WE DO WE MAKE UH A LIGHT UNDER THE UNDER THE N UNDER THE NUMBERS AND EVERYTHING
DO IF YOU PRESS SOMETHING IT LIGHTS UP FOR A FEW SECONDS SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT OTHER BUT BUTTONS THERE ARE OKAY
OKAY WE JUST TAKE THAT ONE
AND WHAT ELSE WE HAVE
YEAH BUT IT'S OH TH I THOUGHT WOULD THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SAME
IF YOU PUSH SOMETHING IT IT ALL LIGHTS UP
OR YOU CAN SWITCH IT ON OR SOMETHING
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YOU HAVE TO YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S WHAT I SAID
IT'S THE SAME AS THE TELEPHONE
YEAH
AND DO WE USE A A UH WHAT'S IT CALLED
LIKE A IMAC IF YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH IT
OR JUST A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
DIFFERENT COLOURS
OKAY SO Y YOU JUST MAKE IT TH THROUGH YOU LOOK THROUGH IT
OKAY
AND SO THE BUTTONS WE HAVE THIS IS YEAH THIS IS NORMAL
WE PUT IN THE THE SIMPLE BUTTONS ON THE TOP AND PROBABLY THE THE THE MORE COMPLICATED BUTTONS DOWN THERE
YEAH MAYBE YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO UH WHEN YOU USE TELETEC TELETEXT
YOU CAN PRESS A GREEN OR A RED BUTTON TO GO TO THE NEXT ONE OR TO GO TO THE PREVIOUS ONE
O BUT MAYBE YOU CAN PUT UM THE G THE OPTIONS OF TELETEXT ON THE SECOND LEVEL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE YOU NE ALMOST NEVER USE IT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
FOR ME TOO IT IS
SO WE JUST KEEP IT ONE LEVEL THEN
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
SO THAT'S IT FOR TODA FOR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LUNCH LUNCH BREAK
UM
SO YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
THIS IS UH THIS IS IT
YOU GET YOUR MEAL AND EVERYTHING SO
YEAH
SO WE'RE FINISHED FOR T FOR THIS TIME
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME LUNCH
YEAH
UH MARTIJN
WHAT
UH ABBING
A. B. B. I. N. G.
I WAS A LITTLE SHORT ON TIME BUT
WHAT
UH
JUST YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THE MAIN THING IS THE USABILITY THAT'S WHERE WE CAN UH MAKE IT A SPECIAL PRODUCT
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT FAVOURITE IS WHAT CHANNEL
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL REMEMBER THE NUMBER
OR NOT
YEAH OKAY
BUT UM HOW CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT UH CHANNEL UH CONNECTS TO WHAT FAVOURITE BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
BUT UH UH FOR A USER TO TO REMEMBER IF I PRESS THAT BUTTON IT GOES TO THAT CHANNEL
YEAH BUT ISN'T IT HARD TO REMEMBER
LIKE FAVOURITE ONE AND
MM AS AS HARD AS
NO NEITHER DO I
YEAH I DUNNO
UH UH THE P UH NEXT AND PREVIOUS
PREVIOUS I KNOW BUT NEXT CHANNEL
I DON'T THI
LI LIKE A WEB BROWSER SO OH OKAY
BUT UH UM THERE'S ALSO A BUTTON TO UH GO TO THE CHANNEL YOU'VE BEEN BEFORE
LIKE A WEB BROWSER BACK BUTTON
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH W WOULDN'T IT BE A PROBLEM TO UH BECAUSE YOU H HAVE TO BE FAST ENOUGH
MAYBE THE ELDERLY PEOPLE
OH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT'S TH MM
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I I THINK YOU HA REALLY HAVE TO DIVIDE BETWEEN FUNCTIONS YOU OFTEN USE
LIKE UM UH M MAYBE UH SWITCH CHANNELS AND UH VOLUME AND K THAT KIND OF THINGS AND UH THE MENU BUTTON
BECAUSE YOU N ALMOST NEVER USE MENU BUTTON
SO
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL THE WORKING DESIGN
THE METHOD I USED IS UH SEARCH THE WEB
JUST THE WEB PAGE PROVIDED
UM
BASICALLY I'M I'M NOT VERY TECHNICAL UH UH EDUCATED BUT UH I COULD FIGURE IT OUT
UM BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU PRESS A BUTTON UH THEN A CIRCUIT GETS CLOSED BY PRESSING THE BUTTON UH LIKE A SWITCH
AND BY CLOSING THAT CERTAIN CIRCUIT THE CHIP KNOWS UH WHAT BU BUTTON IS PRESSED
SO LIKE YOU PRESS A ONE THAT CIRCUIT IS CLOSED AND UH THEN THE CHIP PRODUCES A PATTERN
LIKE A MORSE CODE TO UH AND AND SENDS THAT TO THE UH L. E. D.
THAT'S THE UH LIGHT EMITTING DIODE I THINK
UM AND THE LIGHT EMITTING DIODE IS UH PRODUCING INFRARED LIGHT
THAT'S UN UH INVISIBLE
TO THE HUMAN EYE
AND UH TRANSMIT THAT UH TO THE T. V.
HOWEVER IT HAS ALSO AN UH A VISIBLE UH DIODE THAT'S UH BLINKING RED IF YOU LOOK IN IT
AND THAT'S UH ANOTHER DIODE I BELIEVE
BECAUSE INFRARED IS NOT VISIBLE
SO THAT'S ER UH DO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BUT
YEAH
I I THINK SO
I I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S THE SAME THING
YEAH
YEAH WHEN YOU PRESS IT
SO
TWO
YEAH I DUNNO
MA ON ON MOST ON MOST UH UH REMOTE CONTROLS IT'S RED
SO
SO I KNOW
I I THINK UH THE BATTERIES WILL BE UH A LITTLE YEAH OKAY
UH MAYBE
YEAH
THAT IT'S WORKING
THAT IT'S NOT NOT THE BATTERIES ARE LOW
YEAH I KNOW
JUST TO INDICATE IT'S WORKING
AND UH THE RECEPTOR IN THE T. V. SENSES THE PATTERN
SO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PATTERNS ARE USED TO YOU KNOW TO MAKE IT UNIVERSAL
SO THAT IT CAN BE USED WITH ALL THE T. V. S
WE HAVE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT PATTERNS ARE USED SO WE CAN UH O ON THE OTHERWISE IT WON'T WORK
NO
I I UH THE CHIP UM UH IS PRODUCING THE PATTERN
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHIP THAT PRODUCES PATTERNS TO Y YOU KNOW TO YEAH
THAT ARE WORKING
YEAH OR I DUNNO HOW IT'S UH EXACTLY HOW IT WORKS
IT WASN'T EXPLAINED THERE
YEAH
OKAY
AH OKAY
OKAY
OKAY YEAH
SO IT UH WE HAVE TO MAKE A A S A BIT MORE INTELLIGENT CHIP THAN THE STANDARD ONE
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO YEAH
UH OKAY
WELL UH Y YOU HAVE THIS CHIP
THAT'S UH WHEN THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED IT PRODUCES THE PATTERN
BUT UH MA BASICALLY FOR UH BRANDS OF T. V. THESE PATTERNS ARE DIFFERENT
SO LIKE WHEN YOU PRESS A ONE ON ONE T. V. IT GO GO TO ONE
AND ON THE OTHER T. V. IT WON'T WORK BASICALLY
SO UH BASICALLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS UH GET THESE PATTERNS RIGHT
AND UH BY D UH THAT CAN BE DONE BY UH JUST UH CHA YEAH CHANGING THIS PATTERN ALL THE TIME
AND UM
WHAT HE'S DOING WHEN HE'S CONFIGURING THIS PATTERN THIS CHIP UH IS TRYING TO SWITCH OFF THE TELEVISION
AND WHEN IT'S UH SWITCHED OFF YOU CAN PUSH A BUTTON AS UH IT'S WORKING NOW SO AND THEN HE SAVES THAT SETTING AND THEN UM IT'S WORKING
OKAY
WELL UH THE COMPONENTS
YEAH THAT'S A BIT TECHNICAL AND I HADN'T I W I WAS A LITTLE SHORT ON TIME
UM BUT I THINK I UNDERSTAND IT
UM THE ENERGY SOURCE IS UH THE BATTERY BASICALLY
UM THAT'S CONNECTING TO ALL THE COMPONENTS
BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE FED WITH ENERGY
OKAY
UH THE SUBCOMPONENT IS UH W
I I THINK IT IS UH THE BUTTON PRESSED
SO BASICALLY WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON A SWITCH GET CLOSED
UM THAT'S CONNECTING TO A CHIP
SO THE CHIP KNOWS WHAT BUTTON YOU PRESSED
AND THE CHIP SENDS OUT UH THE PATTERN TO THE INFRARED BULB
I DIDN DIDN'T PUT THE DESCRIPTION BY THIS ONE
TH THIS IS A NORMAL BULB
SO THE NORMAL FLASHING LIGHT
YEAH
YEAH AND THIS IS A LED TOO
BUT THIS ONE IS PRODUCING INFRARED LIGHT THAT'S INVISIBLE
AND THIS ONE IS PRODUCING NORMAL LIGHT
YEAH
YEAH PRESU YEAH YEAH YEAH
BECAUSE UH WHEN YOU BUTTON PRESS A BUTTON AND IT DOESN'T WORK IT CAN BASICALLY IF THE BATTERY IS LOW IT WON'T WORK
SO YOU HAVE TO INDICATE THAT IT'S
HUH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
HMM
YEAH BUT MM LIKE WHEN YOU PUSH IT N N YEAH
YOU HAVE YOUR FINGER OVER THE BUTTON
SO YOU CAN SEE YEAH
OR OR M MAYBE ON TOP OF THE A GREEN LIGHT IS FLASHING OR
YEAH
THERE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
B MAYBE IT'S THAT THAT'S A LITTLE TOO HARD TO MAKE
ESPECIALLY FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY
BECAUSE IT'S I IT HAS TO BE YEAH
PRODUCTION COST IS UH T UH TWELVE AND A HALF
YEAH OKAY
YEAH OKAY
YEAH THE THE PERSONAL PREFERENCE I DIDN'T FILL IT OUT
BECAUSE I WAS SHORT ON TIME
BUT UM
BASICALLY WHAT WE COULD DO TOO IS UH HAVE A BLUETOOTH UH INTEGRATION
YEAH
OKAY
NO AND I I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE USE UH TELETEXT STILL USE
HMM
OH
MM
YEAH
THAT KINDA CHANGES THE WHOLE SITUATION
YEAH
MM AH I I DON'T Y YOU'LL USE IT OFTEN BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE ON THE TELEVISION WH WHAT CHANNEL YOU
NO
YEAH
I THINK YOU YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A BIT FLASHY AND AND POPULAR
AND UH THEN THE USABILITY IS NOT THAT REQUIRED BECAUSE THE LIKE IN THE MOBILE PHONES USABILITY IS NOT THAT GOOD I THINK
I DIDN'T READ
I DIDN'T READ ANY B YEAH
YEAH OKAY
I I KNOW
MM
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
BUT IT HAS TO WORK
AND AND AND DOES IT HAVE TO WORK ONLY IN ENGLISH OR IN DUTCH TOO OR
AND AND UH W YEAH
YEAH IT'S PROBABLY MY JOB TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT
AND AND DO YOU HAVE TO SPEAK IN IN LIKE IN A THING OR
YEAH I DUNNO
YEAH I THINK SO
AND AND
YEAH AND ALSO IF IF YOU HAVE A GOOD SPEECH UH SPEECH RECOGNITION YOU CAN JUST THROW THE UH
THE REMOTE AWAY
MM
HMM
MM
YEAH OKAY
BUT
HMM YEAH
T. V. ONE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S GOOD
MM MAYBE IT'S A GOOD IDEA
HMM
HMM
YEAH BUT YOUNGER PEOPLE I THINK UM MORE OFTEN USE THE INTERNET AND ELDERLY PEOPLE OFTEN USE TELETEXT
SO UH
HMM
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
PAUL WIEZER
PAUL WIEZER
A. E. Z. ZEE ZEE
E. R.
UH
YEAH SAME HERE
UH LET'S SEE
WHICH ONE WAS MINE
GOOD
UH LEFT
SO
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
WHICH ONE FIRST
OKAY
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS YEAH
NO I DIDN DON'T THING WE GOT IT
YES
UH
MAYBE JUST A BUTTON ON THE HOME STATION
SO REMOTE CONTROL BEEPS WHEN YOU CLICK THAT BUTTON ON THE HOME STATION
YEAH
YEAH BUT GOOD USABILITY SO YOU CAN USE IT
UNIQUE
YEAH I RECKON
UH I THINK MM
UH
YEAH
BUT UH WE ALSO HAVE TO STAND OUT 'CAUSE THERE ARE ALREADY LIKE YOU SAID SO MANY CONTROLS OUT THAT SUPPORT LOT OF STUFF
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BETTER USABILITY AND STAND OUT BY JUST LOOKS OF IT
SO MAKE IT JUST A DIFFERENT COLOUR OR DIFFERENT SHAPE SO
OKAY
YEAH WELL
UH
THERE IT IS
OKAY
TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
OKAY WELL SO WE HAVE S MM UH BROAD AUDIENCE
ISN'T THAT ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
BUT UM WE HAVE ELDERLY PEOPLE SO WE NEED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
UH THE WAY I WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE IS TO USE THE SEN UH STANDARD
SO STANDARDISED UH METHODS LIKE UH ON ALL UH REMOTE CONTROLS
NOT TOO FULL LIKE UH JENS ALREADY SAID ONLY TEN PERCENT IS BEING USED
YEAH I HAVE IT ON THE NEXT PAGE
BUT YES UH BASIC FUNCTIONS LIKE NUMBERS AND THAT SORT OF STUFF
UM SO THE OPTIONS THAT WE PUT ON THERE SHOULD BE EASY TO USE AND 'CAUSE YOU HAVE MORE ROOM THEN AND FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE BIG BUTTONS
UH AN ICON ON IT OR TEXT ON IT SO IT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT THAT BUTTONS DOES
SO IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TIME TO FIGURE OUT UH HOW TO USE IT
UM A WAY TO FIND OUT UH WHAT PEOPLE USE IS MAYBE JUST TO USE UH QUESTIONNAIRES ON THE INTERNET OR
JUST ASK SOME RANDOM PEOPLE ELDERLY PEOPLE WHAT THEY USE WHAT THEY WANT ON A REMOTE CONTROL
TO FIND OUT
BUT THERE IS ALREADY IN A
ONE DONE
OF FUNCTIONS I COULD THINK OF
UH VOLUME CHANNELS THE THE BASIC ACCORDING TO
JUST ONE TWO THREE ETCETERA
UH TEXT SERVICE OPTIONS
UM BASIC ON OFF
AND I FOUND AN UH COULD I THINK OF FAVOURITES
I ALWAYS LOOK UP THE SAME UM PAGES ON TEXT AND ALWAYS HAVE TO CLICK THE NUMBER
BUT IF YOU COULD MAKE A NEW OPTION THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO PRESS ONE BUTTON AND YOU GET ON YOUR
NO Y
WELL IT'S IT WAS JUST A THOUGHT
SO I'M I U I WOULD FIND IT HANDY I THINK WHEN YOU JUST PRESS ONE BUTTON AND YOU GET ON SIX SIX SIX
WELL UH WHAT I WAS READING ON THE PAGE
UH A REMOTE CONTROL JUST SENDS COMMANDS BASICS COMMANDS TO UH THE TELEVISION
SO SWITCH TO CHANNEL SIX
SO UH BUTTON SIX SAYS SAYS SIX
AND IF YOU MAKE FAVOURITES IT CAN SAY SIX SIX SIX IN A ROW
JUST NUMBERS
THAT CAN BE IN THE IN THE
WELL IF YOU SAID A FAVOURITE
WELL I
NEVER
OH
OH ARE YOU
OKAY NOW M MAYBE NOT
NO MAYBE ELDERLY PEOPLE UH
RIGHT
THEY DON'T LIKE NEW FEATURES
SO MAYBE NOT
UM WELL PLAY PAUSE
I DUNNO IF THAT'S USABLE WHEN
NOT ANYMORE FOR T. V.
RIGHT ON OFF
I DUNNO MISS DID I MISS ANY OTHER BUTTONS BASIC BUTTONS
I COULDN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER 'SPECIALLY NOT FOR T. V.
IS
JUST THE CHANNEL UM UH WHAT I MEAN IS UH
SIX SEVEN EIGHT OR FIVE
UM I DUNNO
I DON'T HAVE UH I DID
YEAH I DON'T THINK YOU USE THAT
Y ONLY WHEN YOU WANT TO GO TO
YEAH JUST USE UH WHEN YOU WANNA SWITCH BETWEEN CHANNELS ALL THE TIME
YEAH I THINK UM F ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER PEO ELDERLY PEOPLE USE STANDARD BUTTONS
SO YOU HAVE THAT UH
YEAH THE TEN PLUS BUTTON
JUST UH ONE ONE PRESSING OR QUICKLY AFTER EACH OTHER
TO JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE AND STANDARD UH FEATURES
UH YEAH MAYB BUT I THINK THAT'S IN THE T. V. AS WELL
THAT'S HOW THE UH THE T. V. T. V. HANDLES IT
BUT YOU CAN HAVE A BUTTON THAT SAYS UM
TWO TWO ST TWO STRIPES
SO YOU HAVE UH LIKE A FIVE SECONDS PERIOD TO PRESS THOSE TWO BUTTONS
SO IF YOU HAVE A UNIVERSAL T. V. CONTROLLER YOU NEEDED ONE BUTTON THAT HAS TWO UH STRIPES
SO WE HAVE A A PERIOD OF I DUNNO FIVE SECONDS TO PRESS THOSE BUTTONS
AND THAT AND NOT FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE TO LOOK ONE TWO UH PRESS AND AIM AND
SO I I DON'T THINK SO
UH I JUST THOUGHT OF ANOTHER ONE
MOST THINGS IN MODERN T. V. S ARE ALSO ON THE MENU
SO YOU ALSO NEED A MENU BUTTON
AND THEN UH NAVIGATION UH
BUT WE CAN INTEGRATE THAT WITH VOLUME AND PREVIOUS AND NEXT SO YOU HAVE
FOUR ARROWS
YEAH OKAY BUT UM
YEAH A MUTE BUTTON
YES
DON'T THINK SO
YEAH WELL THAT'S THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE LAYERS THAT PRODUCE
NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S UH WHAT TO PUT ON
WHAT WE'RE GONNA USE
AND LATER WE CAN D UH DO THE DESIGN
OKAY UH NOW MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES
UH USING THE STANDARDS BASIC
UM I THINK THAT WE SHOULD STAND OUT UH UNIQUE BEING UNIQUE WITH THE DESIGN
SO WE HAVE TO I DUNNO UH MAKE A DIFFERENT SHAPE THAN USUAL
SO WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SHOP AND YOU SEE OUR T. V. CONTROLLER HANGING THAT IT STANDS OUT
NOT JUST IN IN THE ROW WHEN YOU SEE
ALL THE SAME UH REMOTE CONTROLS
UM
I DUNNO
DIFFERENT COLOURS UM
YEAH
WELL WHY NOT
OR YEAH
WELL MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK AT UH MOBILE PHONES
OH
WHO
THEY THEY'RE UH DESIGNED VERY WELL
AND WELL BASICALLY ARE THE SAME JUST A BIT SMALLER
YOU THINK YOU CAN'T MAKE A T. V. CONTROLLER TOO SMALL 'CAUSE THEN YOU WILL ALWAYS LO ALWAYS LOSE IT
BUT UH WELL I THINK THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE
OKAY SORRY
WELL UH YEAH I I'M FINISHED
I THINK WE DISCUSSED EVERYTHING
UH J IS AIN'T IT JUST TO TO INDICATE THAT IT'S TRANSMITTING
SO
YEAH
MAYBE UH
MAYBE DEPENDS ON UH
YES
BUT MAYBE WELL WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT RED
MAYBE INTEGRATE IT IN THE DESIGN AS WELL
UH OH MAYBE IT'S IT IS WOULD AN E NO
JUST UH
OH
YEAH BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RED
IT'S JUST TO INDICATE SOMETHING'S ON
YEAH
IT'S IT'S NOT VERY IMPORTANT SO YEAH
SO MM
SO WE HAVE TO UH MAKE BUTTONS FOR THAT AS WELL TO MAKE IT UH
OKAY
WELL I I USE A UNIVERSAL UH REMOTE CONTROL AND LIST OF ALL THE T. V. S YOU HAVE ETCETERA
AND YOU HAVE TO PUT IN A NUMBER SO IT WORKS ON YOUR T. V.
OKAY SO WE USE THAT
YEP
NO Y YEAH
NO I DON'T THINK SO BUT YEAH I IT IT WILL LOOK DIFFERENT AND I THINK WE NEED TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE
YEAH
'CAUSE OTHERWISE WE WILL JUST MAKE ANOTHER STANDARD AND OUR UH MOTTO ALSO IS
YEAH W AROUND THE BUTTONS OR IN THE BUTTONS EVEN
YEAH THEN THEN WON'T THEN YOU WON'T SEE IT
YEAH WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT
UH ON A MOBILE PHONE IN THE DARK UH
EVERYTHING LIGHTS UP
WHY AIN'T THAT ON A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH IF UH A MOBILE PHONE A PHONE CAN DO IT IT'S
YEAH I IF YOU'RE IN THE DARK YOU CAN'T SEE THE REMOTE
NO I DUNNO
BUT IF WE USE A BATTERY STATION WHICH I THINK WE WILL USE
YEP
AND ALSO IT'S
OKAY IT SHOULDN'T TAKE MUCH
UH I TH
I THINK UH YOU ALSO HAVE UH REMOTE CONTROLS WITH A LOT OF OPTIONS
BUT WE LOSE ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THOSE OPTIONS
SO I THINK YOU CAN UH
YEAH
I THINK WE WILL SAVE MONEY WITH THAT
YEAH
OKAY THAT'S IT CHANGES THINGS
UM
WELL YEAH THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME NICE FEATURES
I THINK UH THE THING IN THE DARK IS A GOOD WAY TO MAKE IT MORE LIKE A MOBILE PHONE
MORE MODERN
THAT'S IMPORTANT I THINK AND
AND I D I DON'T DON'T THINK IT'S VERY USABLE IN A REMOTE CONTROL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE T. V. FUNCTIONS ON IT
SO
YEAH I THO I THINK THAT'S NOT USABLE
SO BUT UH YEAH
WHAT OTHER FEATURES CAN WE PUT IN
IT'S VERY FASHION
MM
YEAH I THINK IT'S
WHAT BUT UH I DUNNO HOW THAT WORKS THEN
UH DOES YOUR UH DOES IT LIE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM AND CAN YOU SCREAM FROM WHEREVER
UH ONE TO HAVE IN CHANNEL ONE
YEAH I DUNNO
SO IS IT VERY USABLE
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING AT
IS
MM YEAH WELL
IT'S
I D YEAH
I DON'T THINK IT'S UH USEFUL ENOUGH TO TAKE THE EFFORT TO DESIGN SOMETHING WITH UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH
WELL YEAH THAT'S THE RIGHT COMMAND
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SAY UH T. V. CHANNEL ONE OR SOMETHING
NOT JUST ONE BUT
WELL I DUNNO
BUT I DON'T THINK IT JUST AIN'T USEFUL ENOUGH
YEAH I THINK SO
YEP
ALSO THE ONE IN THE DARK
SO UH
IT LIGHTS UP WHEN IT'S DARK
I DIDN'T
OKAY
YEAH BUT UM
YES THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
OR MAYBE WHEN YOU YEAH
IT LIGHTS UP ALL
OKAY YEAH
D YEAH ALRIGHT
YEAH
MAYBE JUST AS AN OPTION W LIKE WE DISCUSSED LIKE IPOD
DIFFERENT COLOURS UH MAYBE USE EVEN DIFFERENT FONTS
LIKE UH PHONES
YEAH
UH AS AN OPTION MAYBE
IT'S THE STANDARD
YEAH UH
YEAH WE BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY COMPLICATED BUTTONS
YEAH OKAY BUT
YEAH WELL W I THINK THE BUTTONS ARE VERY EASY
WITH JUST UH STANDARD BUTTONS WE JUST HAVE SO LITTLE
NO I DON'T NEED DON'T NEED UH TELETEXT OPTIONS ARE ONLY FOUR BUTTONS OR SOMETHING
I USE TELETEXT AS WELL
YEAH YEAH ONE LEVEL
AND I THINK UH 'CAUSE UM WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY BUTTONS I THINK THE DESIGN IS MOST IMPORTANT
YOU CAN D UH INTEGRATE THE BUTTONS IN THE DESIGN VERY MUCH
'CAUSE SIMPLE BUTTONS
IF YOU PUT ONE ABOVE IT IT'S CLEAR
HOW LONG IS LUNCH BREAK
OKAY
BYE
OKAY
FINE
THE NAMES
FOR FOR FOR MY SUR UM JENS
UH DAMMAN
D. A. W.
UH UH M. M.
I MEAN M.
DOUBLE M.
OH
SORRY
OKAY
OKAY
MM
UH
OKAY
WELL MY NAME IS JENS DAMMAN BUT WE'RE IN A GROUP AND I I WILL START IT
WAIT
UM I'VE
USED A MARKETING REPORT ON UH THE SITE
UH I THINK YOU'VE UH READ IT TOO
UH AND UH F AND FURTHERMORE I UH SURFED THE O THE OTHER SITE
YOU DIDN'T READ IT
OH OKAY I I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO GET IT
OKAY IT WAS UH UH UH UM UM A REPORT ABOUT UH AN EXPERIMENT WITH UH A LOT OF USERS
AND UH THEY HAD A LOT OF FINDINGS IN THEIR REPORT UH WITH STATISTICAL UH UH UH THING UH WITH STATISTICAL UH PROOF
SO I UM I HAD THREE PAGES WITH FINDINGS AND SEV A LOT OF UH A LOT OF FINDINGS
SO WE CAN USE THIS UH TO UH CREATE OUR OWN REMOTE CONTROL
UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS FIND UH MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
YEAH I THINK UH UH THAT'S A LOT SO WE HAVE TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL REMOTE CONTROL
UH EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND WHEN UH A REMOTE CONTROL WILL L UH LOOK FANCY
I THINK THIS FITS UH AT THE UH WHAT WHAT UH MICHAEL SAID ABOUT UH OLDER PEOPLE
OLDER PEOPLE WILL UH SPEND MORE MONEY UH FOR UH SOMETHING UH UH WHAT'S GOOD
BECAUSE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE MORE CRITICAL UH ABOUT UH UH WHERE THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY MONEY AT
UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS SAY THEY ZAP A LOT
WELL OKAY THAT'S UH NORMAL
I THINK UH WE WE HAVE TO MAKE UH GOOD ZAP BUTTONS
BUT THAT'S ONE OF OUR REQUIREMENTS
YES FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS SAY THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
UM MARTIJN ALR ALREADY SAID IT
AND UH MAYBE OUR UH FOLD OPEN SYSTEM IS IS A GOOD ONE BUT
I DON'T THINK IT'S UH
REACHABLE
YEAH THE TEN PERCENT ON THE TOP YEAH
THAT THAT'S A GOOD ONE
UM UH PAGE TWO
REMOTE CONTROLS ARE OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SAID ABOUT UM MAYBE A HOME STATION FOR UH FOR IT UH TO UH RECHARGE THE BATTERIES OR SOMETHING
UH I THOUGHT MO MAYBE WE COULD MAKE A CLAP SYSTEM SO WHEN YOU CLAP YOUR HANDS IT WILL BEEP OR SOMETHING
UH YOU MUST FIND IT UH QUICKLY
OKAY YEAH
YEAH WE CAN UH COMBINE THAT
UH IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A R NEW REMOTE CONTROL
UH I THINK WE MUST T UH TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
IT'S ONLY UH TH THIRTY FOUR OF THE THIRTY FOUR PERCENT
BUT IT'S UH A TOUGH ONE
BECAUSE IF WE MAKE A HA WHOLE NEW PRODUCT OUR OWN STYLE WE WE C UH THIS IS SO DIFFICULT UH A DIFFICULTY I THINK
UH NEXT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE BAD FOR R. S. I.
YEAH BUT ONLY IF THEY ZAP A LOT AND THEY WATCH OVER FIVE HOURS T. V. OR SOMETHING
I DON'T WE WE HAVEN'T UH WE MUSTN'T LOOK TOO MUCH AT UH THE LAST POINT
OKAY LAST PAGE
UH THE LAST UH EXPERIMENT UH WAS ABOUT GADGETS LIKE UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
WE DIDN'T UH THINK ABOUT THAT ALREADY
AND UH AN L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
WE ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
UM UH THEY FINALLY HAD A CONCLUSION THAT YOUNGER PEOPLE UM UH UNDER AN AGE OF F FORTY FIVE ARE UH MORE INTERESTED IN NEW FEATURES
AND BUT THEY'RE MORE CRITICAL
AND OLDER PEOPLE UH WANT TO SPEND UH MORE MONEY
BUT UH THEY UH THEY DON'T WANT TO UH HAVE A LOT OF UH NEW FEATURES BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THEIR OLD UH THINKING WAY
AND THEY WANT TO KEEP THE OLD UH THINGS THE OLD THINGS
BUT Y BUT YOU BUT YOU ALREADY SAID THAT THE UH COMPANY WAS ABOUT UH FORTY PLUS UH CLIENTS
I I THINK WE CAN SPEAK UH WE CAN SKIP SPEECH RECOGNITION UH DIRECTLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT REACHABLE FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS
UM THEN
I HAVE MY PERSONAL UH PREFERENCE
OKAY THAT'S NOT VERY GOOD BECAUSE I THOUGHT ABOUT TELEVISION D. V. D. PLAYER STEREO AND V. C. R.
I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT
BUT IT'S ALREADY OUT OF THE QUESTION THIS
UM MY POINT IS WELL I IF WE MA UH MAKE A A REMOTE UH CONTROL FOR ONLY TELEVISION
I THINK IT'S HARD TO UH SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS
BUT IT'S THE EXERCISE
YEAH ONLY ONLY FOR TELEVISION UH ON THE MARKET YOU CAN NOW BUY FOR TWENTY EUROS A REMOTE CONTROL FOR EVERYTHING
AND WE ONLY MAKE IT FOR TELEVISION SO WE MI MM WE M MUST MADE IT MAKE IT UH VERY SPECIAL
OKAY I TOLD ABOUT THE HOME STATION
UH IT MUST BE SIMPLE BECAUSE UH OUR THE THE ELDERLY PEOPLE UH NEEDS TO USE IT
AND I I FOUND A MOTTO
AND WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
AND THAT'S UH THE MOTTO WE ARE UH REFERENCED TO UH FOR OUR UH OUR STYLE
WE WE HAVE TO MAKE A A NEW PRODUCT
WE HAVE TO BE UM YEAH
ONE OF A KIND I THINK
THE COMPANY IS ABOUT OUR UH TH TH THEIR OWN FASHION THEIR OWN STYLE
YEAH TO K TO KEEP IT SIMPLE WHEN YOU SORRY I THOUGHT ABOUT IT YES
OKAY THIS WAS UH MY PRESENTATION
I DON'T YEAH
YOU CAN ASK SOME QUESTIONS OR SOMETHING
MM-HMM
UM
FORWARD
NO
UH
IT GETS SOME SECONDS
YEAH IT'S IT'S NO IT'S NOT A
IT'S WHAT PAUL SAYS
IT'S NOT A REMOTE CONTROL UH UH THAT UM UH MAKES THE T. V. UM DO ONE TWO
IT'S THE T. V. WHO DEPENDS THAT IT MUST BE TWO SECONDS OR THREE SECONDS OR ONE SECOND THAT YOU MUST UH TYPE ONE OR TWO
IT'S ONLY FOR TELEVISION NOW
NO
MAYBE WE CAN GIVE IT OUT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS
YOU CAN CHOOSE BLUE OR YELLOW OR
THAT'S FA THAT'S FANCY
THAT'S UH FASHION
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S ACTIVE
I I THINK IT'S IN THE CASE THAT IT'S ACTIVE
IT'S NOT UH
I IT'S IT'S JUST UH THE THE
MM
YEAH
EMPTY
YEAH
AN AUTOMATICALLY SEARCH FUNCTION FOR EACH TELEVISION OR SOMETHING
UH I KNO
OH I HAVE A MODERN ONE
AND THE MODERN ONE YOU YOU UH YOU TYPE UH SEARCH AND THE LED BEGAN TO BLINK BLINK BLINK
AND UH UH UH AFTER UH A SHORT TIME THE TELEVISION TURNS OFF
AND THEN YOU KNOW OH IT IT'S THE RIGHT ONE
AND YOU CAN STOP IT AND THEN IT'S OKAY
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEARCH FOR YOUR TELEVISION OR YOUR CODE
IT UH SEARCH UH THE PATTERN FOR ITSELF
YES
CHANGING THE SIGNAL
YEAH THAT'S THE RIGHT UH OPTION
UH IF YOU IF YOU USE THE BUTTONS UH BOTH OF THEM WORKS
BUT ONE YOU CAN'T SEE AND ONE INDICATES THAT YOU USE A BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH AND
MM I THINK IT'S UNNECESSARY POWER UH YOU USE THEN
OKAY
BUT THEN HAVE TO BE ON THE IN THE ALL UH REMOTE CONTROL HAVE TO BE LEDS
EVERYWHERE IN THE R
IS LEDS UH BENEATH THE THE BUTTONS
YEAH OKAY
IT MUST BE AROUND IT THEN
YEAH THEN YEAH
NOT NOT NOT NOT HERE BUT HERE
MAYBE UH
OKAY
YEAH I UH
YEAH
MAYBE WHAT PAUL SAID UH UNDER THE ON THE ON THE HOME STATION UH A BUTTON TO UH TO CALL YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL THAT IT BEEPS
YEAH THERE MUST BE SOUND IN IT
I DUNNO
MM UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT
BEC
TWELVE AND A HALF OKAY
BUT BUT WE ONLY HAVE TO MAKE IT FOR TELEVISION AND UM WE MUST HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL
SO
UH
WE HAVE TO GIVE OUR CUSTOMERS SOME EXTRAS
NO
UH
OKAY
CHANGES
UH
L. C. D. DOESN'T WORK FOR UH TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS I THINK
OH
OH I'M WATCHING UH THE CHANNEL ONE
OKAY
NO IT'S NOT
BUT UH SOME OF YOU HAD UH SOMETHING TO READ ABOUT UM UH SPEECH UH RECOGNITION
ABOUT YOU SAID ONE AND THE TELEVISION TURNS ON ONE
IS THAT REACHABLE MAYBE
THAT'S VERY THAT'S FANCY
THAT'S COOL
TWELVE AND YOU'VE GOT TWELVE
ONLY THE NUMBERS ONLY NUMBERS
UH FURTHERMORE NOTHING
BUT ONLY THE NUMBERS ONE TO TWENTY OR SOMETHING
THAT SHOULD BE COOL
IF IT'S POSSIBLE I DUNNO
I DIDN'T READ IT
UH IF I IF I I DIDN'T HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT
AH THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT
UH ONLY IN ENGLISH
ONLY IN ENGLISH I THINK
NO THAT
YEAH THEN TH WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT
BUT DO DO WE DO IT
IT'S MORE IF WE IF WE DO IT
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH AND UH AND UH
IN UH INDEED UH THE LANGUAGES ARE A DIFFICULT THING
UH BECAUSE WE WE HAVE A LOT OF LANGUAGES
YEAH
A UH SOMEONE SAYS THAT UH GIVE ME ONE COKE AND THE T. V. TURNS UH TO ONE
YEAH IT'S NOT UH
OKAY BUT TH THAT BECOMES YOUR F UH UH BECAUSE THAT'S VERY HARD FOR UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
MM-HMM
OKAY NO SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH
YEAH YEAH IT IT MUSTN'T WORK ALL THE TIME
IT UH UH IT HAVE TO WORK ONLY WHEN YOU USE IT
SO IF YOU NO IF YOU USE ONE BUTTON IT MUST TURN UH ON FOR TWENTY SECONDS AND THEN IT MUST TURN OFF
OH YEAH
A SEE THROUGH
MM THAT'S COOL
BUT YOU HAVE YOU HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS
NO I USE TE TELETEXT EVERY DAY I THINK
MM
TRENDWATCHING
OKAY
THAT'S FINE
YO
MM
UH
HELLO
OOP
OKAY
OKAY WE'RE JUST GOING TO THE LATER
SO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL
SO THAT'S ME
UH OKAY
SO UH OKAY
OKAY SO I JUST SHOW YOU THE M THE NO MM MM THE THE THE THE THE THE MINUTES MINUTE
WHAT'S IT CALLED I DUNNO
WHATEVER
OKAY SO WE JUST TALKED ABOUT UH OH YOU WANT ME TO SHOW THAT THERE OR
OKAY WE JUST TALKED ABOUT IT LOOKS
HAS TO LOOK NICE
USABILITY IS VERY IMPORTANT
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT'S SIMILAR TO CHEAPER ONES
UM
IT HAS TO BE VERY BASIC NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS
LIGHT SWITCHES ON IF YOU USE A BUTTON
UH TEXT T. V. STILL HAS TO BE A POSSIBILITY
AND IT HAS TO BE EASY TO LEARN
THAT WERE THE THINGS I UH MAKE MINUTES OF
AND THE FUNCTIONS ARE VOLUME CHANNEL TO CHOOSE CHANNELS AN ON OFF A MUTE UH BUTTON AND A TEXT T. V. BUTTON
THAT ARE THE FUNCTIONS
THAT RIGHT
OKAY
SO I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU UH MIKE AGAIN THE FIRST UH
PRESENTATION OF YOUR
YEAH
BUT WE ALREADY HAVE THE FLASHING FLASHING LIGHT ON THE
OKAY
YEAH
HMM
BUT MAYBE TH THAT'S AL DEFINITELY A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE YOU'VE YOU'RE YOU DROP Y YOUR REMOTE CONTROL VERY OFTEN ON THE GROUND
SO IT HAS TO BE FLEXIBLE
THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
IF IT'S DE LIKE THAT
THAT'S GOOD A GOOD IDEA
IS IT A BIT LIKE LIKE THE THE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
R. SOFT
OKAY
YEAH
IT'S VERY UH DIFFICULT TO TO TO DO IT
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS YOU HAVE TO SPEND ON EVERY REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN
YEAH BUT A TELEPHONE OKAY YEAH
BUT A TELEPHONE ALSO HAVE A L. C. D. AND AND IT'S ABOUT T TWO HUNDRED EUROS
SO UH
YEAH JUST MODERN MODERN BUT STILL UH BASIC
YEAH MAYBE THE TELETEXT TEL
NO
YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT SOUNDS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE
BECAUSE UM THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL IS ON THE ON THE THE BOTTOM OF IT
SO YOU CAN'T USE YOUR THUMB FOR IT
YEAH DOWN THERE
BUT IT'S NOT NOT THE BEST BEST
YEAH FOR VOLUME
FOR VOLUME OR A CHANNEL
YEAH WHY NOT
AND THE CHANNELS AS WELL
OH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S BETTER
YEAH JUST TH TH TH OTHER BUTTONS LIKE TEXT T. V.
PUT THAT ON THE BUTTON BOTTOM
MM-HMM
YEAH
EXCEPT FROM THE ON OFF BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S COOL
OKAY
WE HAVE TO DECIDE THIS THIS LECTURE OR THIS THIS THIS UH FIFTY MINUTES YEAH HOW IT IS GONNA LOOK
OKAY SO HMM OKAY
YEAH WE HAVE TO PUT OUR REAL REACTION LOGO AS WELL ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO THE COLOURS ALSO
SO WE HAVE HA TO MA MAKE IT IN BLACK BLACK YELLOW
MAYBE THE SIDES IN YELLOW AND THE THE THE TOP IN BLACK
WE MAKE I MAYBE YOU CAN PUT YELLOW ON THE SIDE AND BLACK ON THE ON THE FRONT
YEAH IT'S COOL
YEP
AND STILL TRANS
STILL STILL TRANSPARENT
OKAY
YEAH WE MAKE IT SOM MAYBE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT FROM SOFT MATERIAL
UH I'M NOT SURE
YEAH
JUST GIVE FIVE WITH THEM JUST IN A BOX
FIVE DIFFERENT
YEAH
COOL
YEAH
IT IT COULD BE LIKE A NOKIA LIKE PLASTIC
THAT'S BETTER PROB YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S COOL
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN M MAKE A UH ROUND FLUFF OR SOFT MATERIAL
JUST ONLY THE BASIC UH
BASIC REMOTE CONTROL FROM NORMAL PLASTIC AND
THE ROUNDS OF IT FROM SOFTER S
I DUNNO
Y
COOL
YEAH
Y I IF YOU THE NUMBERS COULD BE CAN BE YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
THEY CAN CHOOSE
BLUE
YEAH BUT YOU CAN'T CHOO YOU CAN'T CHOOSE IT WHEN YOU BUY IT
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE
IS IT OKAY
YEAH OKAY
MAYBE PUT SOME DIFFERENT ONES IN IT
DOESN'T MATTER
IT'S JUST NO JUST SOME LED
OKAY COOL
JUST MAKE IT SOME DIFFERENT COLOURS
BLUE RED AND GREEN OR SOMETHING
YEAH WE HAVE TO HURRY UP A BIT SO
OKAY
YEAH A RECHARGER MAYBE
WE STILL WANT TO HAVE A RECHARGER DON'T WE
IS THAT STILL THE
A RECHA OH NO
UH BATTERY
IT'S JUST A BATTERY
YEAH
NO JUST RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
BUT NORMALLY YOU PUT A REMOTE CONTROL ON THE TABLE OR ON THE COUCH
IT'S DARK IN THE ROOM
NO
IT'S JUST BATTERIES THAT'S CHEAPER
YEAH
YEAH
DEFINITELY
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WE JUST MAKE IT PLASTIC
THE SCROLL WHEELS THAT'S COOL
THAT'S FOR THE VOLUME
YEAH
OKAY
I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY
JUST SKIP IT
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT TO TO PUT IT IN
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
OH JUST SK MAYBE YOU HAVE TO SKIP THAT ONE AS WELL
IT'S
NO
NO
YEAH
BUT MAYBE THE FORM HAS TO BE A BIT DIFFERENT
NOT THE SH THE SQUARE FORM
JUST A BIT
MORE ROUNDED
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
SO
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH ONE WE'RE GOING TO CHOOSE FROM THESE
WHAT EXACTLY
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO KNOW IT
SO THE ENERGY UH IS THE RECHARGER
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT
JUST A NORMAL BATTERY
OKAY
THE CHIP ON PRINT IS A NORMAL ONE
OKAY THE CASE IS JUST A PLASTIC ONE
YEAH RE YEAH REGULAR
YEAH OKAY
YEAH REGULAR
OKAY
AND WE NEED A PLASTIC CASE WITH A SCROLL WHEEL
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
AND A FLASHY LIGHT
SO UH I'M NOT SURE
BUT WE DO I DON'T KNOW IF WE EXPECTED TO DRAW ON THIS ONE AT THIS MOMENT
BUT
YEAH
THAT'S FOR THE NEXT ONE
THAT'S FOR TH
UH THAT I THINK THAT'S THE NEXT NEXT MEETING
BUT YOU DEFINITELY GET A SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION
BUT TH THINK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S MORE ROUNDED
JUST AND MORE
IT HAS TO BE
UH A BIT
JUST JUST ON THE TOP OR ON THE BOTTOM
MAYBE THE WHEEL CAN BE UH LIKE UH LIKE THIS
O UM IF YOU DRAW IT LIKE THIS YOU GET A
WHAT THE FUCK IS IT
OKAY
MM
DOESN'T WORK
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
IF I DRAW HERE
IT DRAWS ABOUT FOUR CENTIMETRES LOWER THAN NAH OKAY
JUST
MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE IT LIKE THIS
AND THIS IS ALL THE WHEEL FOR VOLUME
SO THAT YOU JUST UM IT'S ALL ROUNDED SO YOU CAN DO UH TURN THIS ONE
YEAH BUT JUST NOT ON THE TOP BUT UH ON THE SIDE OF IT
MAYBE I DUNNO
OKAY SO WE HAVE THIS AT THE MOMENT
OKAY SO WE'D HAVE THIS
IS THAT OKAY
AND
LIKE THIS
AND UH WHAT'S THE CHANNEL CHOOSE
WHERE DO WE UH PUT THAT
STILL ON THE BOTTOM OR
THAT'S THE NUMBERS
IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF YOU PUT THE S UH THE SWITCH CHANNELS ON SIDE OF EACH OTHER OR ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
BECAUSE YOU ALREADY HAVE THE VOLUME HERE SO YOU CAN ALSO PUT IT HERE ONE BUTT AND THE OTHER ONE THERE
NEXT TO EACH OTHER
BACK AND FORTH
SO YOU CAN ALSO CAN PUT IT ALL ON THE TOP AND THIS YOU KEEP THIS EMPTY
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT AS WELL
BUT THAT'S NOT WANT TO ZAP VERY QUICK SO
YEAH
IS THIS A OPPORTUNITY OR YOU DON'T WANT A DIFFERENT
WHY
BUT STILL THE NEXT IT'S STILL THE NEXT ONE
DOESN'T MAKE
YEAH BUT FO FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IS EXACTLY THE SAME
IT MA IT DOESN'T MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
BUT IT'S EXACTLY TH
I DUNNO
I YOU ALREADY HAVE THE VOLUME ON THE SIDE SO YOU CAN'T MAKE IT YOU CAN'T MA MAKE A MISTAKE
SO IT'S UH
SO BUT THAT'S FOR THAT'S FOR YOU 'CAUSE IT'S
OKAY SO HMM
WHAT DID WHAT ELSE WE HAVE TO DISCUSS ABOUT
I DUNNO
YEAH
AND THE LED
UH YEAH
YEAH
UH THE LOGO WAS HAS TO BE ON THERE
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH FIVE
LET'S GIVE FIVE
SO Y YOU CAN PUT THE BOTTOM OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IN RECHARGER
IS THAT IS THAT A GOOD GOOD OPPORTUNITY
SO YOU COULD PUT IT LIKE THAT OKAY
UH I'M NOT SURE
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN JUST ROUND UP THE CORNERS A BIT
THAT'S ALL
YEAH
JUST ROUND IT UP
NO
YEAH
YEAH
NO JUST JUST THE CORNERS
OKAY
SHAPES
IT'S A BIT ANNOYING ISN'T IT
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION WHAT KIND OF FORM IT'S GONNA HAVE T GOING TO HAVE
AND YOU HAVE THE SCROLL BUTTON INSIDE
OKAY
BUT WHY DO WE HAVE TO ROUND IT ON THE T BOTTOM THEN
OF SKIP THAT ONE AS WELL
OKAY
YEAH IT'S COOL
RUBBER SPONGY
OKAY SO WE HAVE S STILL ONE MINUTE LEFT
SO JUST I THINK IT'S OKAY IF YOU JUST KEEP IT A BIT SQUARE
NO
BUT I I THINK IT'S STILL FOR OLDER PEOPLE
YOU J STILL HAVE OLDER PEOPLE
IT'S ONLY ANNOYING IF IT IF IT'S LIKE THAT F FORMED LIKE THAT LIKE F WHATEVER
JUST YOU HAVE A NORMAL
BUT I IT IS IT IS IT IS ALREADY FANCY
BECAUSE OF THE LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM OF IT
THAT'S ALREADY FANCY
UH MAYBE MAYBE MAKE THE THE MM THE WHA WHAT'S IT CALLED UH SCROLL WHEEL
MAKE IT IN IN YELLOW OR SOMETHING
JUST LIKE THE COLOURS OF REAL REACTION
YEAH
IT'S RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE THE ONES WE ARE GOING TO DRAW THERE
MAYBE WE HAVE TO ASK UH TO THE THE MM TO HER IF IT HAS IF IT CAN WORK BETTER THAN THIS
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY
SO MAYBE YOU HAVE TO ASK HER
OKAY
YEAH
THAT'S PROBABLY
OKAY SO JUST FINISH IT
SO WE MAKE IT A BIT LIKE M THAT ONE PROBABLY
YEAH
IS THAT OKAY
OKAY ONLY THE COLOUR AND THE FLASHY LIGHT AND THE WE JUST WE JUST SKIP THE THE THE VOCA OR WAS IT THE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
OR KEEP THAT
IT'S OKAY
BUT YOU'D DEFINITELY NEED A
ADVANCED CHIP
SO
CAN WE JUST PUT IT SPEECH RECOGNITION IN IT AS WELL OKAY
YEAH
THE FUNCTION OF THAT IN THERE
YEAH
AND WE NEED A PROBABLY WE NEED A UH ADVANCED CHIP THEN
BUT IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT DOES IT
IT DOESN'T HAS TO SAY ANYTHING
JUST YOU HAVE TO JUST TALK TO
OKAY WE HAVE TO STOP IT NOW
SO JUST
OKAY THAT'S A R THAT'S THAT'S A ADVANCED
YEAH WE JUST DECIDE NOT TO PUT IT IN BECAUSE IT'S TOO DIFFICULT
OKAY WE JUST PUT IT IN BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD FEATURE
WE HAVE TO STOP NOW
OKAY JUST WE HAVE TO STOP IT NOW
OKAY
I RECEIVED AN EMAIL WITH UH A FEW POSSIBILITIES ON UH THE MATERIALS
SO I'LL DISCUSS THEM WITH YOU
YEAH
MM NO
YEAH
HMM
SPONGY
SO RUBBER KIND OF
YEAH
IT'S LIKE A SPONGE
YEAH SOMEWHAT LIKE
YEAH I'VE SOME UH MATERIAL UH INFORMATION BUT I'LL GIVE YOU IT LATER IN MY PRESENTATION
HMM
HMM
YEAH WELL ACTUALLY WE HAVE DON'T HAVE AN IDEA HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COST
BUT MAYBE IT'S CHEAP AND IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT
OH I GOT AN EMAIL UH
AND IT SAYS UH THE CHIP CAN BE UH SIMPLE REGULAR OR ADVANCED
AND
UM
THEY SAY UH A DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP
AND THIS IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ALL THE OTHER CHIPS
SO IT'S M THE MOST EXPENSIVE
YEAH IT SAYS IN THE EMAIL
THE DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP
YEAH PROBABLY TOO
I I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT
WELL IT D THAT'S THAT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE CHIP WE NEED
IF WE'RE DOING UH IF WE'RE DOING A DISPLAY
HMM
HMM
BUT IT THAT'S ON ON THE DISPLAY
I THINK IT IS ON UH ON THE BOTTOM TOO
YEAH OKAY
YEAH I'VE I'VE GOT SOMETHING OF THAT UH TOO
SCROLL
YEAH OR UH MAYBE UH THE CHANNEL BUTTONS ARE OFTEN USED
AND YOU CAN'T USE THEM NOW WITH YOUR THUMB BECAUSE THE THING IS NOT IT'S NOT EASY TO CONTROL
YEAH OKAY M MAYBE WE CHO SHOULD PUT THAT ON TOP AND BUTTONS WE WE DON'T USE ON IN THE BOTTOM
BECAUSE UH YOU CAN'T HOLD IT
YOU CAN'T HOLD IT TH THE CONTROL AND PUSH THE BUTTONS
BUT I I THINK W YOU'LL USE UH THE SWITCH CHANNELS BUTTONS UH MORE OFTEN THAN THE NORMAL UH CHANNEL BUTTONS LIKE ONE TWO THREE
SO MAYBE WE CAN PUT THAT ON THE BOTTOM
LIKE ZAPPING IS JUST SWITCHING ONE CHANNEL AT A TIME
YEAH OKAY
THAT'S THAT'S GOOD BUT
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
HMM
NO I THINK TH THE THE TOP BUTTONS ARE OKAY
THEY SH THOSE SHOULD BE ON TOP
BUT UH WE WE CAN SWITCH THOSE TWO YEAH
YEAH
NO
YEAH WE HAVE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
OKAY THE COMPONENT DESIGN
I LOOKED AT UH SOME SIMILAR DEVICES AND UH MY OWN COMMON KNOWLEDGE
SO UH THIS WAS ON THE WEB SITE
IF YOU AIM AT A YOUNG PUBLIC YOU SHOULD USE MATERIALS THAT ARE SOFT WITH PRIMARY COLOURS LIKE GREEN BLUE RED
SO
FLASHY KINDA COLOURS
UH SHAPES SHOULD BE CURVED SO ROUND SHAPES
NOT NOTHING SQUARE LIKE
YEAH
YEAH BUT MM IS UH HAS ROUND CORNERS I THINK
SO WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TOO SQUARE CORNERS AND THAT KIND OF THING
YEAH
AND UM SPORTS AND GAMING DEVICE STYLE CHARACTERISTICS
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS BUT IT SHOULD BE WELL YEAH POPULAR KIND OF
LOOKING I THINK
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH MM N
NOT THAT WEIRD BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE IT KIND OF FLASHY TO ATTRACT A YOUNG PUBLIC
NO OKAY
THAT'S A THAT'S A SEN
THAT'S JUST A MATTER OF TASTES BUT
WE HAVE TO USE UH KIND OF FLASHY COLOURS I THINK
YEAH
LIKE FRONTS IN IN RED AND YELLOW AND BLUE AND
OKAY
WELL THIS IS A REMOTE CONTROL A VERY OLD ONE
UM THEN THE COMPONENTS
THE CASE HAS JUST A HERE'S BLACK
BUT WE ARE MAKING IT UH
YEAH I DUNNO
MAYBE
BUT ANYWAYS UH IT SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT
WE DECIDED THAT HUH
S
OKAY
YEAH WE COULD DO THAT
YEAH BUT Y YOU COULD YOU COULD MAKE 'EM UH UH LIKE BLUE AND TRANSPARENT
SO YOU CAN STILL TH LOOK THROUGH IT
UM THE BUTTONS
NORMAL RUBBER I THINK
LIKE NORMAL ORDINARY BUTTONS
SOFT
WITH THE HARD HARD BUTTONS
OKAY
YEAH IT'S IT'S ALL ON ONE LEVEL
YEAH ON ONE LEVEL
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP IT ON THE ONE LEVEL
LIKE TH THE TOP IT'S YEAH
YEAH OKAY
OKAY IT'S CHOS SO THAT SHOULD BE HARD PLASTIC
THEN THE BUTTONS
I THINK
OR MAYBE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
AND UM THEN THE L. E. D.
THE NORMAL INFRARED L. E. D. I THINK S SUFFICIENT
AND BACK LIGHT L. E. D. S
SO BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE THE CASE TRANSPARENT OTHERWISE THE BACK LIGHT WON'T WORK
SO IF YOU PUT
OKAY
YEAH BUT WE CAN STILL MAKE IT TRANSPARENT
SO OR NO
YEAH OKAY
GOOD
AND IN GREEN COLOUR THE BACK LIGHTS OR
YEAH
NO BUT I THINK THERE ARE MULTIPLE COLOUR LEDS
SO
I I KNOW I DUNNO
IS
MAYBE IT'S IT'S MORE IMPOR MORE EXPENSIVE
I THINK IT'S
YEAH I DUNNO
MAYBE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE BUT IT I TH I DON'T THINK SO
THEN UH SOME MORE TECHNICAL THINGS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT IT SHOULD BE THERE I THINK
UM THIS IS THE NORMAL CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE A CHIP BOARD IN IN A LOT OF UH THINGS
W SO WE D WE JUST NEED THIS AND THIS TRANSISTORS AND RESONATORS
THERE'S ALL THESE KIND OF THINGS
UM THEY THEY BASICALLY SAID THAT THAT'S ALMOST THE SAME ON ANY UH REMOTE CONTROLS
SO I GUESS WE J WE JUST NEED THAT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO OR
NAH BUT THEY JUST SAID WE NEED IT
UH THE BATTERY CONTACTS LIKE NORMAL BATTERIES CA YOU CAN PUT IN
YEAH OKAY
YEAH BUT
YEAH BUT IT I WE DON'T WANNA HAVE A AR AN HOW DO YOU CALL IT
ACCU
Y UH JUST JUST BATTERIES RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
OKAY
NOT A SEPARATE OKAY
AND UH A CHIP THAT'S THIS ONE
THEN UH I RECEIVED SOME POSSIBILITIES
UM FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE WE CAN USE BATTERIES OR A KINETIC UH LIKE WITH THE PULSE WATCH
SO IT OPERATES ON YOUR WRIST KINDA
IF YOU HOLD IT
YEAH I DON'T THINK IT WILL WORK AND OR WE CAN ALSO USE SOLAR CELLS
BUT YOU MOSTLY USE IT INDOORS SO
YEAH AND AND WE CAN USE THE HOME STATION KIND OF THING
UM CASES FLAT SO UNCURVED
UH TWO D. CURVED IS UM LIKE FRONT TO THE BACK
AND THREE D. CURVED IS ALSO IN DEPTH
SO THAT'S POSSIBLE
UH BUT WITH THREE D. UH CURVED UH REMOTE CONTROLS WE MUST USE RUBBER BUTTONS
SO WE CAN'T USE THE FLAT BUTTONS
YEAH I THINK
UM THESE KINDA MATERIALS CAN BE USED
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
YEAH SCROLL WHEELS UM
YEAH THAT'S GOOD
WE CAN USE MULTIPLE SCROLL WHEELS W IF WE WANT TO
BUT I THINK JUST THE VOLUME IS ENOUGH
AND UH THE L. C. D.
SO WE NEED UH THE EXPENSIVE MOST EXPENSIVE CHIP IF WE USE AN L. C. D.
OKAY THEN WE WE USE M MUST USE THE SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE CHIP
SO TH SO THE REGULAR CHIP
BECAUSE WE USE SCROLL WHEELS
AND UM
YEAH THAT WAS IT I GUESS
UH ARE ARE WE USING A A RUBBER CASE OR WE HAVEN'T DECIDED YET
L YEAH I IT IT SHOULD BE SOFT
YOU SAID SO
SO JUST HARD PLASTIC
OKAY
TITANIUM UH I THINK IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
YEAH YOU CAN MAKE IT CURVED OR MM ROUND
BUT JUST IN TWO D. NOT IN DEPTH
YEAH
YEAH TH YEAH THE CHIP IS THE THE REGULAR ONE
YOU HAVE THE SIMPLE ONE REGULAR AND ADVANCED
SO IT'S B SHOULD BE REGULAR UH THE SECOND
I THINK I'LL JUST CHECK IT
YEAH
MM
OR SHOULD WE DO IT IN THE NEXT MEETING
SO WE SHOULD DID IT HERE
OR SHOULD WE DO IT IN THE NEXT MEETING
OKAY
YEAH
WHAT
OH
OKAY
LIKE A VERY BIG SCROLL WHEEL
OKAY
HMM
I THINK UH YOU'LL GET A A LOT OF UH VOLUME CHANGING WHEN IT'S NOT WANTED
YEAH
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
YEAH BUT MAYBE WE CAN MAKE A A PLASTIC SO THAT YOU I IF YOU LIKE DROP IT IT WON'T CHANGE THE VOLUME
ONLY IF YOU USE YOUR FINGER
I THINK IN MIDDLE
UH I THINK TH THE NUMBERS SHOULD BE IN THE BOTTOM AND AND THE SWITCH CHANNEL IN THE MIDDLE
OR YOU COULD DO THE SWITCH CHANNEL UP BUTTON ABOVE THE THE NUMBERS AND SWITCH CHANNEL DOWN BUTTON BELOW
YEAH OKAY
UH BUT I THINK WE WE SHOULD BU UH PUT 'EM ON TOP OF EACH OTHER SO
BECAUSE THEN IT'S IT'S EASY TO KNOW M IF I PUSH THE THE THE UP
YEAH BUT THE TOP THE TOP BUTTON IS IS LIKE YOU SWITCH CHANNEL UP AND DOWN BUTTON IS IF YOU PUT THEM
BUT UH BUT I I THINK UH LEFT TO RIGHT IS MORE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH VOLUME AND TOP DOWN IS MORE WITH UH CHANNEL CHANGING
IN UH ON MOST ON MOST REMOTE CONTROLS
SO SO IF WE USE THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY HAVE A LONG LEARNING UH TIME
I DUNNO
OKAY
YEAH BUT I I IT SHOULD BE ROUND IN IN SHAPE
SO
NO THA THAT WILL BE
YEAH SO TOP DOWN
HMM
DO WE HAVE TO DESIGN THAT W AS WELL
THE DOCKING STATION
HMM
YEAH JUST A RECHARGER
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE CONTACTS ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE RECHARGER AS WELL
OH YEAH OKAY
OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH YEAH
YEAH BUT WE CAN WE CAN DO ALL KINDS OF UH AS LONG AS IT ISN IS IN TWO D. WE CAN USE ALL KIND OF ROUND SHAPES
NOT IN DEPTH
YEAH BUT YEAH IF IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT
KIND OF YEAH NEW
YEAH BUT WE COULD DO A LOT OF LOT MORE CURVING
I WOULD DO IT
LIKE IN THIS KIND OF SHAPE OR
I DUNNO
I DUNNO IF IT'S HANDY
THIS
THE OLDEN THE OLDEN ONES HAD LOOKED LIKE JUST A SQUARE THING
MM
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH THOUGH THAT'S A TREND
IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT
BUT YEAH I'M NOT A TRENDWATCHER YOU ARE
SO
SPONGEBALL KINDA
OKAY
YEAH I D I DON'T KNOW N SOMETHING ABOUT ERGONOMIC KIND OF FITS IN THE HAND UH STUFF
YEAH BUT WE'RE WE'RE AIMING AT A YOUNG PUBLIC
HMM
YEAH WE COULD DO THAT
YEAH
S UH YEAH I DON'T KNOW
YEAH I THINK SO
AND WE WE HAVE TO BUILD IN A MICROPHONE AND
YEAH AND I DO I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
I D I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION ON SPEECH RECOGNITION SO
FINE
YEAH WE PROBABLY DO
NO
YEAH UH I HAVE I HAVE SOME SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE COST
BUT JUST A ABOUT THE CHIP
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH BUT
JUST IN INEXPENSIVE OR
BUT I IT'S A SEPARATE CHIP
YEAH I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BUT NAH
I DUNNO
IT'S IT WON'T WAKE UP
YEAH
I WAS A BIT EARLY
LIKE
WHAT
NO I JUST CAME IN
UH NORMALLY I WAS ONE OF THEM
COME ON
WHY WON'T IT WAKE UP
IS IT ON
BUT HOW
AH THERE IT IS
UH
YEAH I RECEIVED AN EMAIL AS WELL
WHICH ONE WAS MINE
THE MINUTES
NO JUST TELL US
YES
HMM
YEAH MORE
WELL I'LL I'LL GET BACK ON IT
SPONGY
SPONGY LIKE SPONGE
UH SOFT MATERIALS
YEAH BUT YEAH
SOFT SPONGE
YEAH BUT YEAH
HOW ARE YOU GONNA MAKE IT
YEAH
YEAH I'LL GET BACK ON THAT
WELL I GOT F ALSO AN EMAIL FROM
THE THE TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT
THEY HAVE DONE UH RESEARCH ABOUT IT AND UH EVEN MORE POSSIBILITIES NOW WITH SPEECH
SO THEY RECOMMENDED USING IT
WELL
I'LL CHECK WHAT THEY EXACT MEAN
SO UH
YEAH TH THAT'S THE ONLY PROBLEM
I D THEY DON'T SAY HOW MUCH IT WILL COST SO UM BUT UH IF WE IMPLEMENT UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO IMPLEMENT L. C. D. AS WELL
SINCE YOU HAVE TO UH CONFIGURE SPEECH THING
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING I DUNNO
YEAH SO UH WE GOTTA DE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THAT
MM UH
L. D. C. DOESN'T REQUIRE
OKAY
AND SPEECH RECOGNITION
ADVANCED
YEAH
I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU MY DESIGN
YEAH OKAY
SO WE WELL WE CAN
I HAD UH
TO MAKE A SORT OF A DESIGN
SO I DID SOME SEARCHING ON THE INTERNET
I WATCHED THE OLD REMOTE CONTROLS AND NEWS COM REMOTE COMO UH REMOTE CONTROLS
I THINK WE SHOULD UM THIS IS ONE OF THE MODERN REMOTE CONTROLS OF THE MOMENT
I THINK WE SHOULD GO MORE TO THE IPOD AND M. P. THREE PLAYERS
MOBILE PHONES
MORE MODERN
Y YES
UM YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE IT A BIT BIGGER AND A BIT SMALLER
'CAUSE REMOTE CON CONTROL YOU CAN SEE IT HERE YOU HAVE TO BO REACH BOTH OUT BOTH SIDES
AND HERE YOU JUST HAVE ONE FEW BUTTONS
SO THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN DIFFERENCE
BUT LOOKS UH I DEFINITELY THINK WE SHOULD GO LIKE THIS
AND THEN CHANGEABLE FONTS SO
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART I THINK
BUT AND THE HOME BASE IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOMETHING SIMPLE
WELL AND THEN I JUST ORDERED THE THE BUTTONS A BIT
UH BASIC BUTTONS
ON OFF MUTE
AND TH MAYBE TWO OTHERS I DUNNO
TEXT BUTTONS
YEAH TEXT BUTTON MAYBE THERE AND THERE
AND THEN THE COLOUR BUTTONS IF WE WANT IT ON
I DON'T FIND IT VERY USABLE BUT IT'S UH I DON'T THINK IT'S FITS IN THE THE MODERN THEME AS WELL
SO AND THEN YEAH WE SAW THE THE PLA DISPLAY IN THE THE IPOD
THEY CAN PUT THE BASIC BUTTONS ONE TWO THREE FOUR
AND UH F ABOVE TEN
AND I THINK
NO NO
THAT TH THERE IS NO DISPLAY THERE
BUT IT'S ON THE PLACE OF THE DISPLAY
AND I THINK WE SHOULD UH LIGHT THIS UP
MUCH MORE THAN THAT PART
SO THE FOCUS IS ON THESE TWO PARTS
SO YOU DON'T SEE ALL THE BUTTONS YOU ELSE NEED
UH WELL UM
THIS IS HOW IT IS NOW
UM
HERE UH WELL WE HAVE VOLUME
YEAH
WELL HERE WE HAVE ALSO SIDE SCROLLS
I DUNNO IF WE CAN USE THAT
DO WE WANT TO USE
FOR VOLUME
WELL THEN WE CAN EVEN SIMPLIFY IT MORE
BY JUST PUTTING THE VOLUME ON THE SIDE
AND AND JUST CHANNEL BUTTONS HERE
BUT I THINK UH
WELL
YEAH WELL IT'S
BASICALLY IT'S IT'S HERE
THEY'RE ON TOP
YOU MEAN UH THESE TO THE LOW
OH OKAY
WELL YEAH
MM
MAYBE
I DUNNO BUT YEAH WE'LL
YEAH MAYBE IT'S NOT EASY IF IT'S BELOW
IT'S HARDER TO ZAP
SO I THINK UH IT SHOULD BE
SHOULD BE EASY TO
I THINK IT'S PRETTY STANDARD THESE RUBBER BUTTONS ON THE TOP
AND UH IF YOU DON'T LIGHT 'EM UP THEY DON'T UH YOU DON'T SEE 'EM VERY GOOD
I THINK IT'S MODERN TO LIGHT THIS AREA UP AND TO LIGHT THIS AREA UP
SO THE FOCUS GETS ON THESE PARTS AND NOT ON THERE
BUT UH THE POSITION OF COURSE CAN BE DIFFERENT
IT'S S WE HAVE TO LOOK UH WHAT'S EASY TO USE AND HOW IT'S EASIER TO USE
SO WE CAN UH SWITCH THESE TO I DUNNO IF IT L WILL LOOK GOOD IF YOU PUT THOSE ON T ON THE BOTTOM HALF
OKAY
YEAH MAYBE THOSE TWO YEAH
AND UH YEAH YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S EASY TO UH YES IT HAS TO BE BIG ENOUGH SO YOU CAN HOLD IT RIGHT
WELL THAT'S THAT'S MY FINDINGS
SO UH MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT WE SHOULD GO MORE MODERN LOOK
M. P. THREE PLAYER
AND UH WELL UM IF WE WANT TO PUT IN SPEECH REC RECOGNITION OR SOMETHING WE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD PUT IT ON TOP THEN
I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GONNA PUT IN MORE TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO UH SWITCH IT OPEN
TO USE
SO IF YOU PUT IN UH SPEECH RECOGNITION YOU NEED SO MORE UH MANY MORE BUTTONS
WHICH WON'T LOOK GOOD ON THE FRONT SIDE I THINK
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON
YEAH
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
OKAY
YEAH WELL UH IPOD IS TRENDY
AND IT IS WELL CURVED SQUARE
OKAY
SO NOT
YEAH OKAY
NOT UH THE OLD UH BOX LOOK
MM YEAH IT'S
BLACK YELLOW CONTROL
YEAH BUT UH I DON'T THINK THE THE COLOURS BLACK AND YELLOW GO WELL TOGETHER
BUT
YEAH OKAY
UH CAN'T WE USE UM DIFFERENT UH FRON UH FRONTS WITH ALL WITH THE THE LOGO ON IT
CAN WE DO THAT
SO
YES
SO
YEAH
BUT WITH ALL WITH LOGO ON IT
YEAH
WELL ONE OF THE OPTIONS
YOU CAN JUST LIKE A MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN MAKE UM DIFFERENT FRONTS ON IT
SO YOU CAN JUST REPLACE THEM I THINK
THAT WAS THE IDEA OR JUST UH RELEASE ONE
YEAH UH OR JUST UH SELL DIFFERENT ONES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I UH I DUNNO
A MORE
YEAH JUST UH
I THINK UH RUBBER REALLY HAS AN ODD LOOK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH LIKE MOBILE PHONES
LIKE UH THE IPOD
UH JUST
I DUNNO WHAT UH KIND OF MATERIAL IT IS
BUT
OOPS
YEAH
YEAH
UH YOU CAN JUST MAKE THEM AROUND THE BUTTONS UH YEAH
OR IT RUNS THE WHOLE
YEAH YOU CAN HALFS TRANSPARENT OR JUST THAT IT'S COMES OUT A BIT
DIFFERENT I THINK ALSO
BLUE OR RED
WHATEVER YOU WANT IT I THINK
UH DEPENDS ON THE COLOUR OF THE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
BUT
YEAH IT CAN
'CAUSE THIS A MO MIB UH MOBILE PHONE AS WELL
I HAVE THE MO MI I HAVE A BLINKING LIGHT ON MY PHONE
AND I CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR OF IT
WELL WE DON'T PUT PUT IN ANY FANCIER TECHNOLOGY YET
SO
I'M SURE WE CAN FIT IN
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
WE JUST
YEAH WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE TO UH
YES
YES
RE RECHARGER
BASE STATION
YEAH BATTERIES
YES RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES I THINK'S BEST
SO IF YOU HOLD IT IT GETS POWERED
MM
SO WE NEED UH TWO D.
YEAH
YEAH
UH FOR CHANNELS IT'S NOT HANDY BECAUSE YOU SCROLL TOO FAST
OKAY
UH I DON'T THINK A RUBBER CASE LOOKS
YEAH OKAY
THAT UH FRUIT AND VEG OR
YEAH FRUIT AND VEG CAN BE JUST THE COVERS
SO YOU CAN THE THE SPONGY YEAH I DUNNO
I CAN'T IMAGINE A SOFT REMOTE CONTROL
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE IT
YEAH I THINK
TITANIUM
IT'S MENTIONED HERE UH
OKAY
YEAH
WE HAVE BATTERIES
REGULAR
YES
USER INTERFACE CONCEPT
I DUNNO EITHER
UH I. D. AND U. I. D. WORK TOGETHER ON PROTOTYPE DRAWING ON SMART BOARD
SO WE'RE STAYING HERE
OKAY SO NOW WE'RE KA THIRTY MINUTES ALONE AGAIN
YEAH UH I DUNNO
BUT THE IPOD AND ETCETERA M. P. THREE PLAYERS MOBILE PHONES
JUST A BIT CUR OKAY I'LL SEE IF I CAN SEE ANY OF THOSE
YEAH YOU YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A LITTLE PROBLEM OF COURSE AS WELL
YEAH MAYBE YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE IT UH
THAT'S NOT SCROLLABLE TOO EASY
UH WH WHAT IS THE MIDDLE PART
NUMBERS OKAY
YEAH I AGREE AS WELL
USE THE DZ
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH I THINK UH ZAPPING IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY
AND THEN YOU USE THOSE UH
YEAH OF COURSE UH
YEAH
I I THINK IT'S
IT'S IT'S OBVIOUS I THINK
YEAH I THINK
NO UH I THINK
YEAH
I THINK IT'S S SO SIMPLE YOU JUST
YEAH OKAY I'LL D I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
THINK WE NEED TO WORK UH THIRTY MINUTES AGAIN
NO YOU HAVE UH IT IS UH THE CURRENT UH CONTROLLERS ARE ALL BLACK AND PLASTIC
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT IMAGE OF THE IPOD
MORE THAT UH KIND OF STYLE
NOT NOT THE OLD GREY BLACK
WHERE YOU CAN PUT A VE UH WE HAVE IF WE DO IT LIKE THAT WE HAVE BELOW HAVE WE UH A LOT OF ROOM TO PUT A NICE LOGO
MAYBE YOU CAN BUY SEPARATE ONES AND UH
YEAH
UM I THINK YEAH
THAT'S YOUR CHOICE I THINK HUH
YES
YEAH I THINK SO
BUT TH YEAH THAT CAN BE VERY SIMPLE
LEAST
YEAH JUST WHERE YOU'RE AROUND SOMETHING
LI YEAH WE HAD ONE EXAMPLE
MM
MM
WHICH W
HERE YOU SEE ONE THAT'S VERY ROUND
SO I THINK THAT CAN BE ALL KIND OF SHAPES
YEAH SO Y YOU DON'T WANT UH THIS UH LIKE THE IPOD
BUT
MORE ROUNDED
YEAH I THINK IT WILL JUST LOOK LIKE MORE LIKE THIS ONE
SINCE IT'S THIS IS ALSO ROUNDED
I THINK I
YEAH OKAY THO THOSE ARE AL ALREADY A BIT CORNERED
MM
YEAH OKAY BUT THEN WE HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW
I'VE UH I HAD A LOT OF PICTURE OF OLD ONES
AND ALL CURVES HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE
YEAH OKAY YEAH WELL
YEAH
I KNOW WE CAN DO A LOT MORE BUT
I THINK IT WILL ONLY LOOK MORE LIKE THE OLD REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
BUT UH I HAD A LOT OF PICTURES OH I CAN SHOW YOU HERE
WHAT THE OLD ONES LOOK LIKE
CURVES CURVES
YOU'VE MORE THERE AS WELL
IT WASN'T VERY SMALL ONE
VERY SIMPLE
THAT IS FOR ELDERLY
I THINK IF W MY OPINION
IF WE JUST UH TAKE THE IPOD AND THE SAME LOOK
SO UH LIGHT OR JUST WHATEVER COLOUR BUT THE SAME LIGHT COLOURS
AND UH JUST WITH UH TOGETHER WITH UH THE BACK LIGHTS B LOOK WILL LOOK VERY NEW
NO RUBBER BUTTONS OR SOMETHING
JUST TOGETHER WITH THE BACK LIGHTS YOU'LL GET A TOTALLY NEW LOOK
MORE LIKE THE M. P. THREE PLAYER M. UM P. M. P. THREE PLAYER
YES
JUST A SIMPLE SCROLLB
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
YEAH
NO
SPONGY AND
MM
YEAH IDEA
BUT YOU'RE IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY REMOTE CONTROLS ARE NOW
AND IF YOU MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE IPOD
YEAH OKAY
SO THAT'S ALREADY A VERY BIG CHANGE COMPARED TO
YE YEAH
WELL UH
COULD
NO I THINK OH
THINK THE SCROLL WHEEL WON'T BE VERY BIG
SINCE IF YOU PUT IT UH SOMEWHERE THE CHANCES THAT IT WILL SCROLL ARE TOO BIG
SO IT WILL JUST BE A SMALL
SMALL SCROLL WHEEL
SO IT WON'T UH STICK OUT MUCH
YEAH OKAY
WELL MAYBE WE CAN JUST OPEN IMAGES THERE AND I'LL PAINT AND PAINT
I'LL BE ABLE TO DO A BETTER JOB
BU YEAH I AGREE MORE LIKE IPOD
YES
JUST A
SPEECH
YEAH DO WE S KEEP THAT
YEAH I THINK
WELL UH THEN IT W
WELL THAT'S VERY EASY
WE ALREADY HAVE UH THE BEEPING OF THE HOME STATION SO
UH STRANGE THAT I RECEIVED THE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT
SO SHALL WE IT OPEN THEN
SO WE CAN PUT ALL THE
OKAY
YEAH
OH YEAH I
NO
I JUST I JUST RECEIVED THE
YEAH
YEAH OUR DIVISION HAS DEVELOPED A NEW SPEECH RECOGNITION FEATURE THE INTEGRATED PROGRAMMABLE SAMPLE SENSOR SIMPLE SPEAKER U UNIT
THIS IS A VERY SMALL ELECTRONIC UNIT WILL GIVE A STANDARD ANSWER AFTER IT RECOGNISE A QUESTION
DOESN'T SAY
JUST YOU SAY RECORD FOLLOWED BY YOUR QUESTION SAMPLE AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS THE ANSWER UH SAMPLE
BECAUSE UH
SO IT WORKS LIKE UH GOOD MORNING REMOTE CONTROL AND THEN THE REMOTE CONTROL SAYS GOOD MORNING
YEAH UH TH THAT'S JUST IT'S A NO
YEAH IT WELL THAT'S INTEGRATED IN THE CHIP SO IF YOU USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THAT'S IN IT
I DUNNO BUT IF WE USE SPEECH RECOGNITION THAT WILL BE IN IT AS WELL
WELL IT IT WOULD BE WOULD BE A GOOD FEATURE FEATURE
OKAY
NO NO WORRIES ABOUT THE COST ETCETERA
AND THERE'S A CHIP IN IT THAT WILL OKAY
BONJOUR
WHY
OKAY
CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK
THE POWER LIGHT DOESN'T WORK
YOU TURNED IT OFF
OKAY
OH
HMM
UH
SHALL I START
NO
OKAY WELL
I RECEIVED AN EMAIL
OKAY
I SEARCHED THE WEB UH AND UH I SEARCHED UH ON THIS D DOCUMENT RECENT INVESTIGATION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET
IT HAS BEEN DONE IN ITALY UH ITALY AND IN
UH ANOTHER COUNTRY IN EUROPE I FORGET IT
UH BUT UH THEY FOUND OUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR REMOTE CONTROLS HAPPENS TO BE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO CREATE SOMETHING NEW
SO WHAT MICHAEL JUST SAID IT MUST BE UH SOME VERY DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY UH REMOTE CONTROLS
FANCY STANDS FOR AN ORIGINAL LOOK AND FEEL OF THE CASE AND INTERFACE
UH THIS UH ASPECT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE
UH IT CAME OUT OF THE RESEARCH
IT UH IS TWICE IMPORTANT AS THE FOLLOWING
THE SECOND UH MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT A REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD IT UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE
UH THAT STANDS FOR UH UH NEW TECHNICAL UH FEATURES
AND THEN UH THAT UH THIS IS A POINT OF DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE JUST DECIDED THAT WE DON'T MAKE USE OF UH L. C. D. OR UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
BUT UM THIS IS THE SECOND UH IMPORTANT UH ASPECT AND I THINK UH WE MUST USE SOME OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO BE UH INNOVATIVE
UH MAYBE MAYBE SOMETHING NEW
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS ABOUT IT S UH OKAY UH FEATURES NOT UH DO NOT EXIST IN CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
AND THAT'S VERY HARD I THINK
UH THE THIRD ONE IS THE ASPECT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
BUT UH THAT WAS AN OVERALL UH POINT
WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT
UM I'VE GOT ONE PICTURE
UH D OUR OUR TARGET GROUP UH WE THOUGHT ABOUT WAS YOUNG AND TRENDY
SO I TOOK UH THAT PART OF THE WEBPAGE
AND IT SAYS UH FASHION WATCHERS OF UH UH PARI UH FRANCE AND UH ITALY YEAH UH HAVE DETECTED THE FOLLOWING TRENDS
THIS TRENDS I TH UH TREND I THINK IT'S NOT UM THAT MEANINGFUL FOR US MAYBE
BUT IT'S ABOUT UH CLOTHES AND SHOES
BUT THE UH THE NEXT UH ASPECT ALSO IN CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR THE FEEL OF MATERIAL IS EXPE UH UH IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY
BUT SPONGY WHAT WHAT DOES SPONGY SAYS
SPONGY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH IT'S SOMETHING THAT UH IT STAND THERE
BUT I DIDN'T KNEW UH KNEW WHAT IT MEANS
SO SPONGY MEANS Y YEAH
SO IT'S ALSO A STRESS BALL
UH
OKAY
WHAT DO I THINK
UH BECAUSE A FANCY LOOK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING UH FOR REMOTE CONTROL UH CONTROL I THINK ABOUT CHANGEABLE FRONTS
UH MAYBE A SEE THROUGH ONE IN A A FRUIT FRONT
BECAUSE IT'S UH IT'S HOT
AND UH SOME BASIC UH COLOUR FRONTS
UH SO WE CAN MAKE UH FIVE DIFFERENT FRONTS TO START WITH OR SOMETHING
UH MAYBE AN EXTRAORDINARY SHAPE LIKE A SPONGE
UH OR UH YEAH JUST ANOTHER SHAPE THAN A NORMAL UH REMOTE CONTROL HA UH HAS
JUST UH SOMETHING ROUND IN IT OR UH MAYBE NOT UH NOT UH YEAH I DUN DUNNO
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS ABOUT THAT
UH Y YEAH
MAIN POINT UH STILL UH IS THE TECHNOLO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE
YEAH HOW DO WE DO THAT
MAYBE SPEECH
WE MA MUST HAVE SOME KIND OF GADGET
SO
INTRO YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THE PROBLEM
THAT'S THE MAIN PROBLEM
SO
MAYBE WE WATCH THE FIRST UH THE NEXT TWO PRESENTATIONS
OKAY
UH LET'S FIRST WATCH PAUL'S PRESENTATION FIRST THEN
OH
IT'S MASS PRODUCTION
SO YOU CAN SAY YOU CAN
YEAH
BUT HOW UH WE WE'RE GONNA MAKE MANY OF THOSE
SO WE CAN START A MASS PRODUCTION AND THEN THE COST WILL STILL WILL BE
YEAH
OKAY
THAT WAS THIS
NO I DON'T UH I DON'T LIKE IT
OKAY
SQUARE
LIKE
MM
OH YEAH
UH UH
YEAH
THE THE THE NEW UH NEW MODERN UH REMOTE CONTROLS
UH THE BUTTONS ARE PART OF THE UH THE STYLE I THINK IS PART OF THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF
IT IT'S ONE UH A ONE UH OUT OF ONE SHAPE
UH IT'S N DOESN'T IS UH A BUTTON UH UM HOW DO YOU SAY IT
IT IT DIDN'T IT I IT DON'T COME OUT OF THE ON THE BACKGROUND
IT IS IN UH THE C A REMOTE CONTROL UH
YEAH
YEAH
UH I
YEAH BUT CAN YOU CHANGE IT IF YOU ALREADY BOUGHT THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
YOU
HMM
OKAY YEAH YOU CAN YOU CAN CHANGE YEAH
NO
AH COOL
OKAY
OKAY
MM
UH BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE TREND
THE TREND IS UH SPONG SPONGY UH AND UH FRUIT OR FRESH FRESH
AND UH NOW WE HAVE NOTHING ABOUT UH ABOUT THOSE THOSE TWO
UH YEAH I JUST JUST ON FRONT
NEITH UH I DON'T LIKE IT UH NEITHER
YEAH THAT'S NOT NOT IT'S NOT AL UH ALWAYS THE SAME
EVERY REMOTE CONTROL'S UH DIFFERENT
YEAH WE HAVE TO CARE THAT IT R UH LOOKS REALLY NEW
BECAUSE UH WE STILL HOLD ON TO THE UH ORDINARY UH
UH SQUARE UH REMOTE CONTROL
'CAUSE WHA WHAT I SEE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE I I I IN FACT IS THAT WE USE A SCROLL WHEEL ON THE OUTSIDE
YES
OKAY
AND A BIT UH
SOME SOME KIND OF BLING BLING UH MM CAN WE HAVE
UH AND HOW MANY UH FRONTS UH FRONTS DO WE PUT ON THE MARKET THEN
UH FIVE OR SOMETHING
OR MORE OR
AND UM UH UH BUY THE PRODUCT
YOU BUY YOU GET ONE
AND UH BASIC
OR YOU CAN CHOOSE ONE UH IF YOU BUY THE PROJECT
YEAH YOU SL UH YOU LET IT SLIDE IN THE DOCKING STATION
YEAH
YEAH WE CAN B
IT C IT COULD BE JUST JUST A SQUARE JUST A PACKET
YEAH BUT THAT'S A ROUND ONE
MAYBE WE CAN CHOOSE THEN
YEAH
YEAH
WHAT DO WE DO WRONG
HMM
JUST JUST MORE LIKE THIS AND NOT UH A SQUARE
OKAY
YEAH IT
UH IT'S VERY ANNOYING
OKAY
UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH THE T THE TREND IS
SPONGY AND FRUITY
BUT YEAH
IT'S NOT NOT A LOT OF TRENDS I UH I FOUND UH
UH
IT THE TH TH
YEAH
THERE IS ONE
THERE'S JUST ONE OVERALL IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT WE MUST MAKE IT FANCY AND IT LOOKS ORIGINAL
AND I HOPE WE CAN UH MAKE IT LOOK NOT LIKE THE IPOD ITSELF
IT MUST HAVE UH UH UH A VERY DIFFERENT
YEAH THEY'RE ALL THE SAME
UH YEAH BUT UH IF YOU THE F UH FRONT THE SCROLL WHEEL WILL STILL UH BE YELLOW
NO
IF YOU SET THE PEN YEAH HE WILL DRAW HERE
DOESN'T WORK
YEAH I'LL SEE IT
UH
NO
OH THAT'S HARD
BUT
UH THE MA THE MAIN POINTS I I I UH JUST SAID
WE HAVE TO BE ORIGINAL AND UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE
BECAU YEAH
BUT
MA
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY F INFORMATION ABOUT THE COST
WE STARTED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE COST WAS NOW TH
AND HOW MUCH IS THE CHIP
THE THE THE
AND HOW HOW DOES IT WORK
IS IT
NO
DOES IT SAY DOES IT SAY SOMETHING BACK
OKAY
UM
YEAH
FINE
OH
OKAY
SO JUST F UM
SO THIS IS OUR AGENDA
YOU'RE F YOU'RE GOING TO SHOW YOUR PR PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION AFTER ME
UH I DIDN'T OH YEAH
SO THESE ARE THE
SO THESE ARE THE UM LAST NOTES WE I MADE
IF ANYTHING DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT JUST SAY IT TO ME THEN
I DON'T HAVE TO PUT IT IN THE REPORT
OKAY BUT IT'S STILL POSSIBLE UH UH FINANCIALLY
SO IF YOU WANT TO IT'S OKAY
OKAY JUST
SLIDE OPEN IS UH QUITE USABLE FOR REMOTE CONTROLS
MAYBE THAT'S BETTER
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT
YEAH
OKAY
SO THIS IS OKAY
OKAY SO THAT'S UH I'LL JUST HAVE A LOOK HOW MUCH THAT IS
BUT UM OKAY FOR THE OKAY
NO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT CHIP FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
SO
SO I ALREADY CALCULATED THAT AND IT'S STILL IN THE BUDGET
SO IT'S OKAY
SO YOU CAN SHOW YOUR PROTOTYPE IF YOU WANT TO
OKAY COOL
OKAY
MM
SO HOW MANY FUNCTIONS DO YOU NEED FOR FOR UH THE MICROPHONE
YEAH SPEECH RECOGNITION
JUST ONLY ONE BUTTON TO SAY IT'S ON OR OFF
SO YOU CAN PUT IT ON THE BACK AS WELL IF YOU WANT TO
OKAY
YEAH YOU CAN PUT IT SEPARATE
OKAY
AND DO YOU STILL CAN DO YOU STILL CAN CHOOSE WHAT COLOUR KIND OF COLOUR YOU WANT
HOW DO YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT THAT
JUST ON THE MAYBE ON THE SECOND LEVEL AS WELL
OKAY JUST DRAW DRAW THE SECOND LEVEL BECAUSE WE NEED THAT AS WELL
YEAH AS WELL
JUST MAKE MAKE A JUST JUST DRAW A SECOND LEVEL ONE AND SAY ALL OPTIONS THAT ARE STILL LEFT OR SOMETHING
YEAH
NO NO JUST ON DOWN THERE
SO UH
JUST UH IF YOU S
YEAH Y MAYBE YEAH
FOR THE BOTTOM
NO YOU GOTTA SLIDE IT
YEAH IT'S RIGHT
YEAH
YOU WANT TO SAVE THAT FILE AS WELL
THE DRAWING
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
JUST JUST UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OR WE JUST MAKE IT THREE BUTTONS ALL THE COLOURS ON IT

OH JUST THREE STAGES YOU YEAH THAT'S OKAY
YES THAT'S TO REMEMBER
YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S UH
THAT'S A FUNCTIONALITY FOR THE TELEVISION
OKAY
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE TO SEARCH EVERY TIME AGAIN
THAT'S WHAT WHAT HAPPENING IF YOU DO IT LIKE THAT
BUT IT'S STILL THE TELEVISION THAT HAS TO DO THAT
NO THAT'S WHAT THE TELEVISION DOES
OKAY IT'S COOL
YEAH THAT'S FINE
IS THIS PRICH PRETTY MUCH IT YEAH
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE TO MAKE IT FROM A DIFFERENT MATERIAL ANYWAY
YEAH
OKAY COOL
MM MM MM MM MM
YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS
BUT I THINK WE JUST EVELA EVALUATED THIS ONE
OH OKAY YOU MADE SOME CRITERIA
OKAY COOL
OKAY
YOU HAVE SOME USABILITY CRITERIA OR OKAY
LOOK AND FEEL
OKAY
OKAY
UH I THINK UH IF YOU HAVE A KIND OF IPOD IDEA
IT QUITE BEAUTIFUL
IT'S
WE ARE ACTU WE ARE THE
FLASHY
BUT UH
IT'S BLACK

THAT AS WELL YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT'S UNNECESSARY
YEAH
IT DOESN'T MAKE
NO
YEAH
BUT YEAH
MAYB OKAY
YEAH JUST ONLY YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
SO
YEAH THAT'S HOW I THINK
YE
YEAH THIS IT IS A ONE
IT'S OKAY
IT'S COOL
THIS IS A DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE WE WE DON'T YEAH WE DON'T KNOW IT ABOUT THE
UH IT'S IT'S VERY EASY TO USE BUT UH THE SECOND LAYER IS NOT EASY TO USE
IT'S THAT'S
NO
BUT THE REST OF IT IS VERY EASY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO SO N
SO IT IS LEARNABLE UM F I I IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S VERY EASY TO USE
AND I THINK ITS SCROLLWHEEL IS U EASY TO USE AS WELL IF YOU HAVE EVER USED UH A DIFFERENT KIND OF UH OF UH DEVICE
BUT YEAH
OKAY JUST EASY TO USE IS VERY COOL SO JUST GIVE IT A TWO
NO BUT DEFINITELY BETTER MUCH BETTER THAN UH THAN UH THAN AVERA AVERAGE YEAH
OKAY
SLIDE IS NOT N IS IS NOT NEW
NO
I ALREADY HAVE A
UH I ALREADY HAVE A V. C. R. AND IT'S ABOUT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
AND THEY ALL HAVE A SLIDE IN IT
SO THAT'S NOT NEW
YEAH
THAT'S COOL
YEAH FOR A UH FOR A F
THERE ARE NO GAMES ON IT THAT'S THAT'S IT'S NOT A ONE IT'S A TWO AGAIN
BUT
IF YOU HAVE
YEAH
OH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
RECHARGEABLE
YEAH JUST DRAW IT AFTERWARDS
IF YOU CAN YOU SAVE IT ON THE SAME IN THE SAME MAP AS THE OTHER ONES
IN THE THE PROJECT UH MAP
YEAH
MM-HMM
UH SAVE AS
NO THAT'S NOT IN THE PROJECT
OH YEAH OKAY
SMART BOARD
YEAH BUT THIS ONE
THIS ONE IS NOT YET IN THE OH OH
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO DRAW THE RESI THE RECHARGER
OKAY
AND NEW FEATURES SO WE GIVE IT A TWO OR ALSO AGAIN A ONE
NO I THINK I IF YOU HAVE GAMES ON IT THEN THEN YOU GIVE YOU HAVE A ONE
BUT NOT
NO JUST SO IT'S STILL A TWO
TARGETED AUDIENCE
UH WE ARE THE TARGETED AUDIENCE
DO WE LIKE IT

SO WE WE ARE EXACTLY THE TARGETED GROUP
I THINK SO YEAH
YOU GET THE FANCY THINGS FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE
AND YOU GET THE THE AESTHETIC THINGS FOR OLDER PEOPLE
SO YOU WANT
YEAH YOU GET DIFFERENT COLOURS
SO
OH
SO THAT'S ELEVEN
IT'S YEAH IT IS ONE POINT EIGHT THREE
OH YEAH THAT'S STILL
YEAH MAYBE WE HAVE TO SKIP THAT ONE
OKAY
SO I JUST GOT A FINANCIAL UM
YOU S SAVED IT OR
NO
OKAY LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THIS ONE HERE THE PRODUCTION COST OF IT
IF I FORGOT ANYTHING JUST SAY IT TO ME
IT JUST IS A BATTERY
YEAH THERE ARE SOME THAT THEY DIDN'T MENTION BECAUSE RECHARGE IS NOT ON THE LIST
BUT OKAY
SO I THINK WE ARE PRETTY MUCH IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE IT'S TWELVE POINT THREE EUROS
SO THIS IS A REGULAR CHIP INCL AND AND A SAMPLE SPEAKER
SO THAT'S BOTH
YEAH AND SINGLE CURVED CURVED
NO THAT'S NOT ON THE LIST
BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE
PROBABLY
I JUST THE B THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS I DIDN'T I D I WAS WONDERING IF THIS SPECIAL COLOUR MAYBE WAS I'M NOT SURE
SEE IT'S I THINK IT'S OKAY LIKE THIS
IT'S HARD TO SAY
BUT MAYBE WE HAVE TO UM YEAH OKAY
SPECIAL COLOUR YOU CAN SKIP THIS ONE BECAUSE IT'S ALL QUITE NORMAL
WE GET DIFFERENT ONES THAT'S ALL
SO YOU CAN PUT A RECHARGER IN IT AS WELL
BUT THIS IS EXPENSIVE THE SAMPLE SPEAKER
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S INCLUDED
YEAH NO
OKAY SO THIS IS UH PRETTY MUCH IT THIS
SO I JUST WANT YOU YEAH WE JUST MADE IT
SO WE CAN DO THE PROJECT EVALU EVALUATION NOW FOR UH
FOR EVERYTHING TOGETHER
OKAY
WE CAN DO SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS
WAS THERE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
PAUL WAS THERE ROOM FOR CREA CREATIVITY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY SO THE LEADERSHIP
WAS THERE A LEADERSHIP AND
OKAY
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT
I DUNNO
YEAH I KNOW
OKAY NEXT ONE
UH TEAM WORK UM THE THE THIRD MEETING I THINK THAT ONE WAS PRETTY HARD
WE WERE NOT ALL WE WERE NOT UM AGREE WITH EVERY NOT AGREE WITH
WE'RE NOT FINISHED
YEAH
YEAH FINANCE
BUT THE TEAMWORK WAS OKAY
YEAH
'KAY
YEAH WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT UH MEANS
THE SMART BOARD IS OKAY
DIGITAL PEN IS HORRIBLE
I DUNNO IF YOU USE IT
BUT IF YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD IT TO YOUR COMPUTER IT'S DOESN'T WORK
NO
YEAH
IT'S THE SAME FOR THE PRESENTA FOR THE PRESENTATIONS
YOU CAN DO IT FROM HERE
THAT'S MUCH EASIER THAN STANDING THERE
AND SO YOU'VE
YEAH
YEAH LIKE
OKAY
I THINK YEAH OKAY
SO WE MADE IT IN TIME
AND WE MADE A REMOTE CONTROL
IN THE BUDGET YEAH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEAN
JUST
FOR REMOTE CONTROL PROBABLY
NO FOR THE PROJECT
YEAH
BUT IT'S FOR THE NEXT TEAM
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT
YES I THINK JUST I JUST WRITE A FINAL REPORT
NO WE HAVE ONLY
FOUR MINUTES LEFT
UH IT'S OKAY
OKAY
YOU HAVE TO SAVE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW THAT HUH
OKAY YEAH
OKAY
OH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH AND OR ARE WE MAKING A SLIDE OPEN LIKE UNDERNEATH
OR FOLD OPEN
I DON'T KNOW
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
YEAH S LIKE UNDERNEATH UH YOU CAN SLIDE IT OPEN AND YOU OTHER FUNCTIONS
YEAH
THINK THAT'S BETTER
THE
YEAH I I THINK SO
I DON'T KNOW
AH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH IT'S LET'S DO IT TOGETHER
OKAY
YEAH WE JUST MADE A WORD FILE
WITH THE BASIC
ELEMENTS
UH THE LOOK AND FEEL MODEL
UH WELL THE FORM THE CASE UM AS DRAWN THERE
SIMPLY A SQUARE WITH UH ROUND CORNERS
SO THAT'S BASICALLY IT
UH THE MATERIAL SHOULD BE HARD PLASTIC
UH COLOUR CHANGEABLE AND ALSO TRANSPARENT
AND COLOUR AND TRANSPARENT OR JUST TRANSPARENT I DON'T KNOW
UM THEN THE ELEMENTS
UH WE HAVE
THE FUNCTIONS ARE JUST BASIC
LIKE UH I'VE POINTED THEM HERE
MUTE FUNCTION ON OFF FUNCTION TEXT FUNCTIONS
THIS UH SWITCH CHANNEL
AND THIS IS THE
THE NUM PAD
AND THE LOGO IS OVER HERE AND THE MIC
AND THE SCROLLWHEEL NO
YOU OPERATE THAT WITH YOUR POINTING FINGER
SO YOU HOLD IT LIKE THIS IN YOUR RIGHT HAND AND
UH I DUNNO
YEAH MAYBE MAYBE UH YOU HAVE TO CONFIGURE IT
YEAH OR OR ON THE SLIDE FUNCTION I DON'T KNOW
WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO DESIGN THAT THE SLIDE PAD
YEAH
UM THE POSITION
YEAH YOU WRITE UH YOU WROTE THIS SO
YEAH
BUT IT'S NOT UH IMPOSSIBLE TO USE IT IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED
SO Y BECAUSE YOU CAN USE YOUR THUMB THEN
MM YEAH
YEAH OKAY
JUST SO YOU GET THAT
YEAH
YEAH THESE ARE JUST BASIC FUNCTIONS SO ALL THE NON BASIC ARE IN
OKAY
UM
OKAY MAYBE WE USE THIS BUTTON FOR THE
YEAH
A SECOND LEVEL
LIKE A A NEW BLANK ONE OR OR JUST HERE
OKAY
YEAH
SO WHAT DO WE NEED
YEAH JUST
GOD DAMN IT
SO THIS IS THE
EXTERN OR SOMETHING
SO HERE ARE MULTIPLE SPEECH BUTTONS I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
I DON'T KNOW THE FUNCTIONS
OKAY
WHAT ELSE
WHAT ELSE
UH MENU
UH WITH ARROWS
LIKE A NORMAL UM
YEAH WITH IN THE MIDDLE UM A MENU BUTTON
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
WE CAN PUT THOSE HERE
SO DID WE MISS ANYTHING
OKAY
OH WH HERE
OKAY
YEAH OR TH OR THE
YEAH
YEP
YEAH BUT THEN YOU CAN SWITCH BACK TO NORMAL TELETE TELETEXT
YOU JUST SWITCH IT OFF AND THEN
WELL W WE THOUGHT OF A TEXT BUTTON
AND IF YOU PRESS IT AGAIN YOU GET THE THE THE
THROUGH VIEW
YEAH B BUT BUT IF YOU'RE IN THE SECOND STAGE THE THIRD STAGE IS SWITCH TELETEXT OFF
SO YOU CAN SWITCH BACK FROM SECOND TO W FIRST
OKAY OKAY
YEAH MM NEE UH NO IF I UH THE REMOTE CAN SEND LIKE THE THE CODE FOR SEVEN HUNDRED PAGE SEVEN HUNDRED TO THE TELEVISION
TH TH TH IF YOU SWITCH IT ON
TH I
YEAH I DUNNO
OKAY
YEAH THOSE MEMORY FUNCTIONS
YEAH
WAS UH THIS LOGO FOR UH VOLUME
OKAY
SO THAT'S IT
MM
NO NO YEAH
JUST HARD PLASTIC
SO
UH I THINK JUST UM
YEAH BUT
I THINK UH YOU HAVE THAT PROBLEM MORE OFTEN WITH RUBBER BUTTONS
IN THE BOTTOM
NO EVALUATION IS
YEAH BEAUTIFUL'S IS ALSO A MATTER OF TASTE
AND WHAT COLOURS SHOULD THE BUTTONS BE
BUT CAN YOU CHANGE THOSE TOO WITH UH THE SWITCH
OKAY
YEAH
IT'S JU SO SUBJECTIVE
ONE MORE THING
ARE W ARE WE CHANGING UH OR ARE THEY THERE UH BACKLIGHTS ON THE SLIDE PANEL TOO
OR N NO BACK LIGHT
YEAH
AND AND THE SWITCH CHANNEL IS UH THERE IS A BACK LIGHT TOO
YEAH
HMM
YEAH JUST BACKLIGHT
NOT NOT THE BUTTONS
AND TH AND THE THE NORMAL BACKLIGHTS ALSO NOT THE BUTTONS BUT BEHIND THE BUTTONS
SO THE BUTTONS ARE JUST GREY
OKAY
NO BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THAT
AND YOU ON DON'T HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT SECOND LAYER
THAT'S TH THAT'S THE MAIN THING THAT'S SO GOOD ABOUT IT
WELL I THINK IT IS
SO SO FEW INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN EASILY DECIDE WHAT BUTTONS W FOR WHAT FUNCTION
MM UH
THE NORMAL
AND THE ONE YOU SHOWED IS JUST ALL BUTTONS AND YOU DON'T KNOW
YEAH
THE SPEECH FUNCTION AND THE COLOUR
COLOUR
MM IT'S PRETTY NEW I THINK
SPEECH IS NEW
YEAH
YEAH WE DIDN'T DRAW THAT TOO BUT
YEAH THAT'S JUST A NORMAL TH S SIMPLE THING
WELL IT'S A ALREADY IN THE FOLDER
L LIKE NUMBER SEVEN
I THINK IT IS
NO I THINK IT IS
OKAY
MM TWO I THINK
YEAH
WE'VE GOT A ONE FOR FANCY LOOK AND FEEL AND THAT'S WHAT ATTRACTS THE YOUNG AUDIENCE
SO
THINK THAT'S A TWO OR A ONE
YEAH BUT S IT THAT'S BASICALLY NOT NOT HANDY
AND I DON'T THI I DON'T SEE
YEAH
YEAH
NO
YEAH YOU COULD MAKE A A FRONT
A FRONT THAT'S THAT'S LIKE UH LIKE A BANANA OR SOMETHING
LIKE A A F BANANA KIND OF FRONT
NO
YEAH
ELEVEN DIVIDED BY SIX
WE'RE NOT TOO HARD ON OURSELVES
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH BUT UH WE HAVE TO MAKE A SPEAKER THEN TOO
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT BEEP
BUT WE CAN WE CAN DO IT UH UNDERNEATH THE LOGO
IF YOU DO UH
YEAH OKAY
MM OKAY
BUT UH IS UH UH
OKAY
BUT BUT IS IT INC DOES IT INCLUDE A A HOMESTATION OR
CAN WE MAKE THAT FOR UH H TWENTY CENTS
YEAH
YEAH IT'S FOUR
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD THAT WE WE GET THIS INFORMATION NOW AFTERWARDS
BECAUSE
SURE
BEAUTIFUL
YEAH M IF WE GOT A HIGH MARK FOR UM
UH INNOVATIVENESS OR INNOVATIVITY
THEN THERE WE PROBABLY HAVE BEEN CREATIVE
YEAH
HUH
NO I THINK YEAH
JUST NORMAL DISCUSSION I THINK
NOT
ONE LEADER OR SOMETHING
YEAH
AND MAKE NOTES
YEAH
YEAH W WE HAD SO MUCH INFORMATION THAT WE GET THROUGH EMAIL AND JUST
YEAH
YEAH TH THAT'S WEIRD
HMM-HMM YEAH
SO WE'RE BACAL BASICALLY JUST LUCKY TO UH GET THE PRICE RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I IF IF IT WOULD BE FASTER IT WOULD BE GREAT
YEAH
YEAH AND P JUST POINT WITH A MOUSE
YEAH
JUST OLD FASHIONED KINDA BLACKBOARD STYLE
BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL DO IT IN NORMAL COMPUTER STYLE
YEAH
YEAH
AND IT'S FAR TOO SLOW THIS WAY
NO
WHAT'S THAT
HMM
YEAH BUT STILL YOU COULDN'T MAKE A FANCY A F YOU COULDN'T MAKE A A PROTOTYPE OUT OF THIS
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY SIZES AND
YEAH BUT IT YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY DO THAT IN SUCH A SHORT TIME I THINK
YEAH JUST BRAINSTORMING BASICALLY
SO ARE WE FINISHED
OKAY
YEAH
OH OKAY
IT'S NOW QUARTER PAST THREE
SO
YEAH
NOW WE CAN LOOK AT THIS
WE'RE PROBABLY NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT THIS BUT
YEAH FROM THE PREVIOUS GROUP
THE TOUCHSCREEN YEAH
YEAH
HMM
HERE ARE THE
BASIC FUNCTIONS IN HERE THE SELECTING DEV DEVICES
HMM
NO
YEAH THIS ONE
HMM
THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING DESIGN
WELL IT HAS A L. C. D. I THINK
AND WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE
YEAH EVERYTHING
IT WANTS TO KNOW WHAT WE DO IN OUR SPARE TIME
WARNING
FINISH MEETING NOW
WARNING
WARNING
OKAY
BOOM BOA RING BING
FILL IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE
WHAT NOW
OKAY
NO MORE CHIT CHAT
YEAH
OKAY
IT'S NOT SAVED YET
SO
OUR BEAUTIFUL DRAWING
ARE WE DOING THE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO UH DE UM DESIGN THE INSIDE AS WELL
OKAY YEAH
WELL THEN THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT IT IN
YEAH JUST UH WE HAVE TO DESIGN THE INSIDE THEN BUT IT SHOULD BE UH
IT'S MAY MAYBE UH A BIT STRONGER AS WELL
OKAY SO WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF ROOM INSIDE
SO YOU CAN MAKE IT VERY EASY TO USE
'CAUSE YOU CAN WRITE A LOT OF COMMENTS BESIDES IT
NO
YEAH WE'RE GONNA USE THE ADVANCED CHIP THEN
ADVANCED CHIP WAS FOR UH SPEE YEAH
OKAY
GOOD
TOGETHER
I'LL GIVE COMMENTS
SPEECH RECOGNITION
UM I DIDN'T HAVE A SPECIFICATION OF THAT
BUT UM I CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE TO INPUT YOUR VOICE OR SOMETHING
UM SO I'VE
YES YOU NEED OPTIONS TO CONFIGURE IT AND AFTER THAT YOU DON'T NEED 'EM ANYMORE
YEAH YOU CAN PUT 'EM ALL ON THE BACK
THAT'S FOR SURE
THAT'S UH
WE ALSO DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BUTTONS ARE REQUIRED OR WHAT KIND OF BUTTONS
BUT
YOU HAVE A LOT OF ROOM IF YOU CAN SLIDE IT OPEN
YOU YEAH I KNOW
I CAN IMAGINE YOU NEED AT LEAST FOUR BUTTONS OR SOMETHING
SO BUT IT'S ENOUGH ROOM
UH WELL WELL THE MAIN THE MAIN ZAP BUTTONS ARE MOST CENTRAL
THAT WAS THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
SO UH THE BEST PLACE THE BEST REACH PLACE UM ON OFF BUTTONS
TEXT BUTTONS MUTE BUTTONS ARE TOGETHER AND AT A PLACE THEY EASILY ARE EASY TO FIND
UM THE ON OFF BUTTON IS A BIT BIGGER UH SO IT STANDS OUT
THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT RED 'CAUSE IT'S
WILL UH WILL SHOW UP
UH SCROLLWHEEL IS ON THE LEFT SIDE
IT'S BASICALLY THE BE STANDARD PLACE FOR SCROLLWHEEL AS FAR AS I KNOW
YEAH
OKAY YEAH THEY
YEAH OKAY
THAT'S THAT'S BELOW THAT THEN
IT'S UH TWELVE BUTTONS
YEAH OKAY JUST WE JUST MISSED THAT
BUT UM I'LL JUST UH
I'LL GET BACK TO LATER
F THE FORM WELL WE'VE TAKEN THAT FROM THE IPOD OTHER POPULAR TECHNICAL DEVICE
SO UM SHOULD BE POPULAR
UM
THE F UH THE BUTTONS CREATING
UH IF YOU
THAT OR ALL ROUND SHAPES NOT UH ROUNDED CORNERS
SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU GET A BIT ROUND FEELING
UM WE'LL USE HARD PLASTIC
SINCE THAT ALLOWS US TO USE UH TWO D. BUTTONS UH NON RUBBER BUTTONS
COLOUR CHANGEABLE
WELL AND UM THE BACKLIGHT THING THE THING THAT LIGHTS UP
WE HAVE DECIDED UH IN THE THE CHANNEL BUTTONS THERE'S A LITTLE UH COLOUR AROUND IT
AND ALSO IN THE NUM PADS THERE'S ALSO COLOUR LIGHT BEHIND IT
SO WHEN YOU PRE
YEAH
WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT
YEAH
MM JUST A LITTLE
YEAH
YEAH I UM TO YOUR VIDEO DEVICE
YEAH
IS I AH OKAY
UM SLIDES I THINK
IT'S
YOU CAN DO IT THAT IT CLAPS OPEN BUT I THINK THAT'S NOT SOLID ENOUGH
IF THAT BREAKS THEN YOU'RE SCREWED
SO IT DO DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO SLIDE ALL THE WAY OPEN
UM
UH I THE THE SPEECH FUNCTIONS BUTTONS
MENU BUTTON
WITH UH MAYBE UH ARROWS
SO YOU CAN UH
SCROLL IN THE NAVIGATE THE MENU
UM
I THINK WE CAN EVEN PUT A WE HAVE ONE FOR THE ZERO AND ONE FOR THE FOR THE MORE DIGIT UH CHANNELS
SO YOU HAVE ONE LEFT FOR THE RIGHT THE VIDEO CHANNEL PLAY STATION ETCETERA
THAT'S USED PRETTY OFTEN
IF YOU HAVE A PLAY STATION MM YOU USE IT EVERY DAY
THAT WAS IT
UH
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
THAT'S YEAH WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY UH HMM
WHAT ELSE
UH MENU BUTTONS WITH ARROWS
S JUST UH LIKE UM I THINK IT'S BEST IF WE DO
MM WHERE DO WE HAVE
OR THERE
LIKE ON THE NORMAL UH LIKE THIS
THE MENU BUTTON YES
WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANYTHING ON HOW MANY BUTTONS SPEECH REQUIRES
SO YOU CAN'T REDESIGN IT
YEP
JUST PRESS IT ONCE THE COLOUR SHOULD UH SWITCH
PRESS AGAIN THE COLOUR SWITCH AGAIN MAYBE
YEP
YEAH MAYBE SOME UH SOME TEXT NEXT TO THE SCROLL WHEEL THAT IT IS VOLUME
I JUST UH THE VOLUME LOGO
YEAH
YEAH WE HAVE THAT ON THE THE TEXT BUTTON
UH WHY NOT
NO WHOA
I THINK UM YEAH THE THREE STAGES
YES
NO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TURN IT OFF
JUST DON'T

AND UM WE HAVE TO DISCUSS ABOUT IF WE GIVE IT A ONE OR A SEVEN
UH
YES
YEAH THE THE THE DIFFERENCE BE BETWEEN UH BEAUTIFUL AND FANCY UH LOOK AND FEEL IS UH THE THE THE OUTSIDE UH BEAUTIFUL UH LIKE THE IPOD OR SOMETHING
